remember and the vice chair went
over the agenda and actually
identified the order.
So we could see what could go
quickly.
And so we're starting first with
Senator J. Block on the State
Park Day passes for veterans.
And
Representative Doo also spoke to
me about this yesterday, so.
Uh, please, I bill 161.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and uh
thank you uh committee.
Uh, basically what this bill
does for, for veterans, it
eliminates a three-day pass for
unlimited use of camping areas,
um, across the state.
It also expands the definition
of veteran.
Uh, in the new definition of
that means uh that you're
enlisted, drafted, inducted, or
commissioned.
Not just in the armed forces,
but also the Army Reserve Navy
uh reserve, Marine Corps
Reserve, Air Force Reserve,
Coast Guard Reserve, and now,
uh, the Space Force is well to
include our army and the
National Guard uh partners here.
It also includes Madam Chair,
uh, our public health commission
corps, uh, which provides a
valuable service to the country
as well as the national Oceanic
atmospheric Administration
Commission Officer Corps.
So that is basically it and you
obviously, um, to have this
benefit.
Uh, you are separated under
honorable conditions general
other than honorable, but um if
you were just probably
discharged, you are, uh, not
eligible and um
Madam Chair, uh, this paster
also I want to thank my
co-sponsor, Representative uh
Rebecca Dow.
Um, for, um, really pushing this
forward in the house. He went to
the labor vets and Military
Affairs Committee passed 100,
went to the rural Development
land grants and cultural Affairs
Committee passed 60 and then
went to the house floor, Madam
Chair and in past 59 0, so I'm
really hoping um Senator
Townsend doesn't, isn't the
first one to vote against this.
And uh with that, Madam Chair,
I'll uh I'll stand for
questions.
Thank you very much. Let's go to
the room. How many people are
here to support this bill?
We got one. Anybody here to
oppose this bill.
Is there anybody online?
And one in support online, you
need to speak, sir.
If so, come on up. Well, wait
till you get the mic.
Well, introduce yourself for the
record.
And please go ahead, Madam
Chair, committee, um, just very
briefly, um, I am a veteran, so
I do support this bill. Thank
you.
Thank you, and if my father was
alive, he would support it as
well.
With the person online is Walt.
Let's have Walt speak.
Uh, good morning, Madam Chair
and members of the committee. My
name is Walt Barton. I'm a US
Navy vet and member of the
Veterans and Military Families
Caucus.
We've got more than 150 members,
and we strongly support this
bill.
Um, there are lots of reasons
you've heard them all. I walk
regularly in my own Villanueva
State Park.
And being in nature at 78.
And safe out there.
Helps keep me sharp.
So we do hope that you will join
the uh committees in the House
and the membership of the House
in support of this spell, and I
would like to thank the sponsors
for bringing it forward. Thank
you very much for allowing me to
testify.
Thank you very much for being
here with us this morning.
Committee members' comments,
questions, uh, Senator then
Senator, um,
The of
Madam Chair, I'd like to move
for a dueest when it's
appropriate.
Uh, thank you, Senator Sah
Lopez.
Um, of course, I support this
bill. I just have a couple of
technical questions. Um, why
doesn't the Department of
Veteran Services managed this
program rather um
Rather than um SPD the
Um
The State Parks division just
because they have the
information.
So cause it just practically, I
think, well.
I'll just ask that question.
Madam Chair, uh, Senator, uh,
it's a good question because
they are in collaboration
because the Department of
Veterans Services will go out
and um they will pull the
records of where they are,
they'll send out the passes and
things like that. Uh, they've
done in the past, uh, one of the
issues that the Department of
Veteran Services has had is, is
finding some of these veterans,
uh, because they, they move
around and things like that, but
the veterans will have their VA
card, uh, veteran card, they'll
have either
There,
um, active duty or National
Guard or reserve card as well
and the dependence, uh, will
also have their uh
identification cards.
So Madam, this would be issued
not automatically but upon
request of the veteran and they
they would prove their veteran
status.
So that I'm sure senator, that's
correct, uh, in order to uh
prove your veteran status,
there's one veteran on the, on
the um um committee here with
Senator Pope, it's very easy to
go and get your DD 214 and show
proof of your service and on
that DD 214 it has your uh
discharge.
Uh, category as well.
They, uh, thank you, Madam
President. Um,
Thank you, Senator Pope, would
you like to second?
Uh, yes, ma'am Charles. OK,
thank you. Would the secretary
please call the vote.
responses,
excuse Senator Charlie Charlie,
yes, Sanel. Yes, yes, Senator
Hamlin.
Excuse, Senator Pope.
Yes. And our Pope, yes, and ours
Scott.
And Scott, yes, Senator
Townsend.
Yeah
Senator Townsend, yes, Senator
Dia Lopez, yes, Anna the old
office yes San Stephonics, yes,
Esophonics, yes.
You have a unanimous vote and
unanimous due pass from this
committee. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, committee members.
Uh, committee members, I'm
presenting the next one. It is a
geothermal fund and uh the vice
chair will chair.
Madam Chair just begin when
you're ready.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. This is uh the
geothermal projects development
fund.
Uh, last year or the year
before, we passed the geothermal
built. It was Senator uh Jerry
Ortizino, and I believe
Representative Patricia Royal
Caballero. This year it's uh the
fund that would assist these
projects and this bill includes
A definition for other entities.
It also includes um
clarification that it will be a
competitive process.
And the funds would be um the
grants would only be up to
$250,000.
And uh this this is strictly a
fund, the appropriation has been
stripped, and there is
approximately $10 million.
And House Bill 2.
On this fund.
And I have an expert witness who
will introduce herself.
Uh, chair senators, my name is
Rebecca Puer and I'm the
director of the Energy
Conservation and Management
Division over at Emner, and it
would be our office, uh, who
would be overseeing this fund in
the competitive process.
So we would stand for support,
opposition questions. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Is there
anyone in the audience in
support of this bill? Is there
anyone in the audience in, in
opposed to this bill?
OK, if you, we could have the
people who wish to speak stand
in support.
Um, come up to the front.
And please, if you brief and try
not to repeat each other. Thank
you.
Good morning.
Good morning, ma'am sure,
members of the committee. My
name is Travis Kellerman. I'm
the senior climate advisor for
the governor. I mean, stand in
support of this bill. Last year,
we took a big step towards
supporting this industry.
New Mexico is 6th in the nation
for our geothermal potential and
capacity.
We
Really want to support the early
stages of this industry as it
promises to produce clean, firm
power for the state.
The goal is to de-risk and
support development activities.
We want to avoid the expensive
trial and error that happened
once seen in oil and gas
development in this state. And
this industry does use existing
oil and gas assets and workers,
and that goes all the way from
those who know how to drill to
petroleum engineers who can be
upskilled for work in this
sector. We have a robust and
robust and diverse coalition
behind the geothermal industry
here. We want to expand
eligibility to developers and
and tribes. I urge your support
of HB 289. It's time to develop
this new economy and support
clean, firm power in New Mexico.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
Sayeri Yamadam, the registered
lobbyist for clean air task
force, um, CATF supports this
bill because it will provide
funding for early stage
geothermal technologies,
including next generation
geothermal and allows private
sector entities to qualify for
the funding, and this will help
attract new investments and
create new jobs. Thank you very
much. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Jared
Najar on behalf of Interspace
Action, um, we echo the comments
of the prior two speakers, and
we thank the sponsor for
bringing this bill forward and
we stand in strong support.
Thank you. Thank you.
Uh, good morning again,
committee, um, Madam Chair, my
name is uh Jim McKenzie. I'm
with 350 New Mexico. Uh, we
stand in strong support of this
bill. We were involved with
Senator Jerry Ortizipino in
drafting the original bill, this
bill. We were involved with
Senator Jerry Ortizipino in
drafting the original bill, uh
this is um an important
technology for us to develop and
to incentivize in this state. I
know that lots of people come.
Before this committee with new
technology promising the the
sky, the world. This is the real
deal. This is real. This is not
a huge reach, but it does need
some incentive to get going, uh,
New Mexico is a very good place
for thermal, uh, geothermal
energy, and we hope you'll
support this bill. Thank you.
Thank you.
Is there anyone online in
support or in opposition?
OK, we have um Tom Solomon
online as an expert witness.
OK, Mr. Solomon, do you want to
make a comment?
Yes, uh, I'd be pleased to.
Thank you very much.
Um, yes, I'm actually a
facilitator of the Mexico
Geothermal Working Group and of
course we fully support this
bill, which actually rose out of
discussions with them and our
team, uh, advances in, uh,
geothermal advanced geothermal
energy are being reported nearly
every month, and we see so many
opportunities to develop our
subsurface heat resources to add
clean baseload power to the
grid, for example, for new data
centers, um, inside the fence
line and military bases and
more.
Our focus is to get the first
enhanced geothermal power plant,
started up in our state, but we
saw a need to expand the
geothermal grant and loan
program passed last year, um,
and that's what this bill does,
and we are of course are in
strong support. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Solomon.
Um
I
Are you, is that it? Or do you
have anything else to say? OK.
We're ready, Madam Chair, for
questions and comments.
OK, committee members, um, any
questions or comments?
Senator Scott.
Oh
Thank you.
Madam Chair, madam chair.
250K chump change on it.
utility scale geothermal
project.
So the question is,
Would any of these monies be
utilized or could they be
utilized?
Or much smaller scale projects.
That is
geothermal heating and cooling
for.
School or small business.
That would be
Very far removed.
What's required
that utility scale.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator Scott. I'm gonna
refer to my expert, Rebecca
Puckste, because the, the, um,
Apartment well established the
process and the rules and uh she
also goes by the name Puck. So
it is a mista or puck.
Uh, chair members of the
committee. Thank you for the
question. The short answer is
yes. The way that the statute is
written, uh, geothermal project
could include as what we call
shallow surface geothermal for
heating and cooling. Um,
however, it will also unlock the
major barrier right now, which
is the knowledge of the
subsurface and the need for more
mapping in the state to de-risk
as you speak of the utility
scale, uh, drilling.
But
Yes. So, Madam Chair, Madam
Chair, Miss Puck.
I mean, I can support this bill.
It
If
For research.
And
Perhaps very.
Early stage funding for
commercial utility scale
projects.
But the technology to build
these smaller systems.
shallow
Geothermal
is already well established and
probably almost economic.
So
If the primary, if the
representation is.
primary utilization of this is
gonna be for those.
For research in the bigger scale
projects.
One thing
If
Putting geothermal in schools,
that's something else.
Can you
Can you address what the
Primary objective of this will
be.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator. I'm gonna refer to the
department.
Chair and members of the
committee, uh, yes, well, the
statute is written in such a way
that it could fund schools.
Obviously the interests of the
department and the interests of
the state, and when we go to
write it administrative program
is in the big utility scale
projects that you mentioned. So
that would be in promulgating
the rules and doing the
competitive procurement, we
would prefer to lean towards.
The competitive utility scale.
And we had done our um
Department has administered
something similar with wind a
few years ago, there were some
seed money to literally put up
windmills around the state at a
certain height and assess where
the wind speeds were, and you
can see how that has helped
kickstart our industry, so we
would follow a pattern similar
to what we did with Win.
Thank you, Miss Park. Thank you.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much, Madam Chair. I appreciate
being here.
Whenever the money was stripped
from the bill, it was $20
million going to go into the
geothermal project Development
Fund.
Is there a fund already in
place. I'm assuming that there
is.
Madam Chair Singer, there is a
fun established and as I
mentioned, approximately for
right now, 10 million is in
house Bill 2, whether it stays
in.
You know, we don't know yet.
OK, and because right now in
current language in here.
It does save money in the
geothermal project Development
Fund may be used to make grants
of up to $250,000 for the
purpose of blah blah blah.
Has any of that money been used,
Madam Chair, Madam Charuck.
I'll defer to the department.
Chair members of the committee,
thank you for the question. Yes,
some of the initial seed money
has been used uh in hiring
staff, beginning to promulgate
the rules for the program and
beginning to do some of the
mapping of the subsurface.
OK, thank you for that
information right there.
I uh, I, I've kind of got
concerns over this for the
And if we are looking at
Grants up to $250,000.
There is a problem I'm having
with this because it also says
it may be used to provide grants
for financing a geothermal
development project.
And I've been hearing about a
certain company that has been
coming into our state.
And it's kind of scamming some
people, and I've got concerns
about that.
Um,
How will y'all make sure
That the financial aspect of
what we're doing by helping
certain people out isn't going
to be a violation of the
anti-donation was because if
they are.
Discovering
Geothermal in a certain area and
then turning around and charging
somebody else out.
To participate in whatever the
production of it is, I have a
problem there. Am I seeing this
totally wrong?
Chair, members of the committee,
I believe they, I heard you
correctly, Senator, there might
be 3 different questions in
there, so.
They can't fall into me, Madam
Chair, so I'll try to take them
at a time, so I believe you
asked about, uh, companies, bad
actors, shall we call them.
Uh, my department he'll rep.
There you go,
um, so my division is also the
division who has been entrusted
with uh permitting in the
regulatory oversight, um, and so
we will be both carrot and stick
in setting up those permits and
making sure that the folk.
Um, follow all the rules. Also,
typically the way the second
question, typically the way we
administer grants is on a
reimbursement basis. So in the
competitive process, we would
set up the criteria for being
eligible, go through a
competitive process and then
companies would have to hit
markers along the way, um,
before they would be reimbursed
for their expenses. So there's
several checkpoints in the
process.
OK, well, Madam Chair, I guess
my concern here is
One particular company that I
have heard the most about, they
have.
started projects like this and
then filed for bankruptcy.
Hm
They've done it quite a few
times and therefore I do have a
problem with it.
Uh, but I also want to ask
another question, Madam Chair,
Madam Chair, but.
About how deep does a person
have to go to?
Reached the the necessary.
depth in the ground
be able to have
Geothermal energy.
Chair, members of the committee,
that's a great question,
Senator. We have some of the
answer, uh, which is
The heat gets good starting in
some places around 5000 ft.
We've had drills in New Mexico
as deep as 18,000, and that's
the new emerging technology that
we'd like to really explore
developing because the deeper
you go, the hotter it gets, the
more efficient your turbines can
run, the cheaper the
electricity, essentially, um,
but where to drill, those are
expensive drills to drill that
deep and when you are in hot
rock, you need different drill
bits, slightly different from
what we are currently using with
oil and gas, for example, um,
So this, this fund would allow
us to partner with, for example,
our labs that have got some
different
Uh, drill heads to really get
good at drilling as deep as
possible to be efficient.
Madam Chair, madam chair, and
Puck I also know that they are
very efficient.
That there's a company I
remember if it's over in the
Silver City or the Lordsburg
area that does have greenhouses.
They
Eat those
geothermal energy.
But I, I didn't realize that
their wells were that deep.
Uh, chair members of the
committee herein is the
opportunity of geothermal is
there's lots of different things
you can do with it. So what
you're referring to is uh
geothermal use for heating and
cooling, which is not that deep.
It tends to be in the hundreds
of feet depending on the
temperature of the Earth, um,
the utility scale that the other
senator referred to is when you
go very deep down to the 18,000
or 20,000 ft, enough to boil
water and create steam to run a
steam turbine and create
electricity for the state.
sort of two different types of
geothermal with bundled in that
same word.
OK, so we're drilling down.
Madam Chair, madam chair, and
Puck.
Uh, basically the same depth
that oil well might.
Uh, chair members of the
committee deeper.
And herein lies the need for,
uh, and the potential for New
Mexico to be a first mover and
really refine that
deeper technology, madam.
This may be a silly question. I
know, the boy said, to my right.
will know this answer, but I
don't, so I'm gonna go ahead and
ask you.
What is injection depth for
produced water.
Madam Chair, we can't answer
that. It might be one of your
colleagues.
13 or 14,000 ft.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you.
Just real quick.
What is the tinter gradient.
That you guys need.
Well, in the central part of the
state.
In order to make
These deep wells.
Um
I think our expert Tom Solomon,
who's online would be the better
person to answer that. Did you
hear the question, Tom, Mister
Solomon.
Did you hear the question?
Yes, I'muting now. Yes, um, so
the temperature, for example,
that was reached in that 18,000
ft test well, the director Sta
referred to was uh about 250, I
think that's about 450 °F and
that temperature was quite
sufficient to generate usable
electric power.
And mistress Solomon.
Yes, madam chair and Mr.
Solomon.
Where does that gradient of the
gradient east of the mountains,
southeast New Mexico is.
About 1:10.
Of a degree per 100 ft. Um,
So where does that gradient
start to shift? Is that uh
Is that along the Rio Grande
corridor.
Or
Can you tell me where these
Resources would be.
most appropriately.
Developed
Mr. Solomon.
Yes, thank you, uh, Madam Chair.
um, Senator, the, um, I don't
know if you have in front of you
the fact sheet uh that we
generated for the uh from the
working group, but there is a
nice map of the um estimated
subsurface temperature, you
know, best zones in the state
and yes, along the Rio Grande
Rift, which is essentially the
Rio Grande River, um, is some of
the prime.
best subsurface heat, the Rio
Grande Rift is a geological
feature where the Earth's crust
has been pulling apart for the
last 30 million years and
therefore the uh hot uh mantle
rock on the subsurface is closer
to the surface in that area.
Therefore, um, don't have to
drill as deep to reach it, and
so, uh, for example, in in and
around um uh Los Alamos, uh
very good resources in around
Socorro and our one geothermal
power plant that is operating
today is in Hidalgo County,
about 20 miles south of
Lordsburg, um, much of the
western part of the state has
excellent geothermal resource
potential and we have some
information about where it is
and as the directors there said
what we really want to do is do
some additional.
mapping of the subsurface heat
so we can establish with more
precision those best locations
so that we don't waste time and
resources drilling in the wrong
spots and can nail it on the
first try.
Madam Chair, approximately the
department says approximately 25
counties out of the 33 have some
possibilities.
And
That dear Mister Solomon.
What technology do we use?
To map these resources.
That is, I am unfamiliar.
any way to measure temperatures
at depth.
From the surface.
Are we going to be drilling.
Multiple wells through
Yes temperature gradient or how
is that going to work?
Um, Madam Chair, uh, Senator.
We are in the process of doing
that right now. And in fact, um,
our center of expertise, New
Mexico Tech Socorro has some
funding in last year's bill and
and recurring to basically
establish our best database of
subsurface heat, and they are
basically compiling information
from disparate resources,
different sources right now. A
lot of it from um subsurface
drilling from the
Oil and gas industry, as you
probably know, Senator, as some
of those oil and gas wells are
drilled. They
Um, they map and report on the
temperature as they go down to
depth, and we have that data
from um
Past drilling experiences
throughout the state, and that
is being compiled right now.
That is probably the basis of a
lot of it. Um, I can't say that
I am an expert much beyond that
to establish and answer your
question how we're going to put
that in, but we have some very
good people, including Dr.
Sherry Kelly, geophysicist with
New Mexico Tech who is doing
that right now.
OK.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Solomon, for
your answers. Thank you, madam.
Senator Townsend.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
And I
And you
Not tap into this geothermal
process much shallower using it
for.
Cooling versus heating or
electrical generation.
Uh, chair members of the
committee, you can, but it's in
a fashion inefficient and makes
it more expensive, so, uh,
again, the deeper the rock, the
hotter you're looking for ways
to boil water, the more water
you can boil, the more gallons
per minute that you can boil,
the more efficient your
electricity. So it's more cost
effective to, to drill deeper to
higher growth.
I'm sure, I'm sure I, I
completely understand that, but
I was thinking about buildings
using for passive cooling
systems versus.
Electrical generation and does
that not fall under the
geothermal.
view.
Um, chair members of the
committee, yes, both would.
They're both fairly distinct and
I I personally, I think they
need different words to describe
someone as you call it passive
or, or close to passive heating,
cooling, which is, would be very
efficient and effective for all
the buildings in the state and,
and as has been pointed out here
is a little bit of more mature
technology, um, and then there's
the new emerging technology of
generating clean, firm, cheap
electricity for New Mexicans.
Mature mentor.
kind of got a vested interest in
this. I passed the geothermal
app, I think it was in 20016 or
2017, I can't remember.
Who it was before Ken McQueen, I
can't remember who the partner.
Older gentleman I can see him,
but I can't say his name right
now, but anyway.
It is a good technology.
Got some viability and and
Yeah.
I'm a little
I mean $250,000 is
Trump changed the
But
really be required to get
something of scale, but it's a
place to start, so I appreciate
it. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Townsend.
Anyone else?
Madam Chair, I move a do pass on
House Bill 289.
Madam Chair, would you like to
second that?
OK.
Um, with that, uh, Madam
Secretary, we call the roll.
Senator Cervantes, excused
Senator Charlie.
Charlie, yes, and hersel.
Yes, and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Ozel, yes, Senator Hamblin.
Senator Pope, yes, Senator Pope,
yes, Senator Scott.
And Scott, yes, Senator
Townsend.
Senator Xenia. There's a de
Lopez. Yes, turns to Lopez, yes,
San Stephonics.
Fox, yes.
Senator Eel to explain her vote.
Yes, ma'am, thank you very much.
I do see the potential with this
Madam Chair and Madame Chair. My
problem is that it's gonna be
pri private contracts.
That will benefit private
companies who build
infrastructure that they can
turn around and sell that energy
to.
I want the state to be very
careful that we are not.
To me that is
Unconscionable that we would
even be doing that where we are.
Helping one to help the same
person to help the same person.
I hope you understand what I'm
trying to say here. Thank you
very much.
Thank you, Senator, with a, a
vote of 7 yes, 0 no, 2 excused.
You have a do pass.
Our next is uh HP 175 forest and
watershed buffer projects and
Senator Campos is here for
Vincent.
Or um
For Representative Vincent.
Oh, Vincent is here. OK. Well,
I'm not sure who he's here for,
but he's
Here. Senator Campos is a
co-sponsor in the bill.
HP 175.
Whenever you're ready to go,
senator.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
uh, if I may, what I'd like to
do is to go ahead and start to
defer to Representative Vincent,
uh, as he presents this measure
and then from there I'll have a
few remarks and then we also
have an expert, uh, who will
also uh make a few remarks if uh
if you would allow, and then
from there we'll be able to uh
uh
Be here for questioning.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, members of the committee,
uh, before you today is House
Bill 175, which is the forest
and watershed restoration Act
amendment.
And um what this bill does is
it, it establishes buffer zones,
um, these buffer zones will
significantly slow the spread of
wildfires by creating strategic
barriers between natural
vegetation and residential
areas, providing critical time
for emergency response and
evacuations.
Firefighters will have safer,
more defensible operational
areas.
From which to combat approaching
wildfires, improving their
ability to protect communities
and minimize uh potential
damage.
The strategic
placement of these buffers will
dramatically increase the
likelihood of suppressing, um,
Fires before they can reach
residential structures,
potentially preventing
catastrophic community wildfire
events.
By creating intentional
separation between natural fuel
sources and human settlements.
The bill offers a scientifically
informed approach to wildfire
and risk management.
The devastating South Fork fire
that swept through the village
of Rioso in Lincy County on June
18, 2024 revealed the extreme
vulnerability of communities
that live near natural
landscapes.
Unmanaged vegetation and lack of
strategic buffer zones, creating
dangerous environment where
wildfires can rapidly spread
from natural areas into resident
residential neighborhoods
putting homes, lives, and
communities at critical risk.
HB 1756.
To comprehensively addressed
wild wildfire prevention by
making strategic amendments to
Section 68-4-2 NMSA 1978 by
introducing precise legal
definitions for buffer zones.
In high risk areas, providing
clear guidance for implementing.
Protective measures around
communities vulnerable to
wildfire threats, expanding the
definition of eligible product,
uh, projects to explicitly
include the creation and
maintenance of protective
buffers around wildland urban
interface.
Interfaces ensuring that
preventative measures can be
legally and financially
supported.
Enabling funds in the forest
land protection revolving fund
to be used for these critical
preventative infrastructure
projects transforming potential
vulnerability into proactive and
community protection.
And
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair. Thank you very much
Representative Vincent as we go
forward, uh, I really appreciate
the explanation and of course
the concern that continues to be
raised as we deal with the
forest fires that occur
throughout New Mexico and
particularly the uh the fires
that have occurred in
northeastern New Mexico and of
course uh in the Riodoso area.
So with the South Fork Fire with
the Hermit's peak Caf Canyon
fires what we have seen, uh, is
ongoing devastation and if you
will,
I
And we're just getting to the
point to where the resources are
becoming more readily available
to help us to restore, if you
will, uh, some of these public
lands and more importantly, as
Uh, forest firefighters as they
get out there, uh, we really
need to also be very concerned
about their lives and so within
this House Bill 175 continues to
bring forth, if you will, the
resources to help with the
mitigation and more importantly,
as we go forward to ensure that
as we prepare for the next fire
season, uh, that we're better
prepared and uh hopefully
continue to go ahead and save,
of course, lives, the lives of
animals, and then of course the
uh public property and the
property.
of uh private residence as we
move forward and so with that,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, if I may, I would
also like to defer it to our
expert witness, Laura McCarthy,
who is a state forester and
allowed her to make a few
remarks, if I may.
Madam Chair and committee
members, I'm only gonna add one
thing
Definition and the ability to
use the forest land protection
revolving fund to put buffers in
is part of our mitigation
strategy to keep our communities
safe.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, and we're available for
questions. Thank you.
Is there anyone in the audience
in support of this bill?
Is there anyone opposed?
Let's go ahead and have the
supporters come in and speak in
favor of the bill, and please
try not to repeat points that
are made by by earlier uh
speakers.
So
Got to hold this mic down.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee,
Bernard Treat, uh, from Roswell,
New Mexico, registered lobbyist
for XL Energy SPS.
And the reason uh I wanted to
speak to Bill today is because I
think the premise of this bill
is showing uh proactive measures
and instead of reactive.
It, it coincides today in our
company because of forecasted
winds the next couple of days in
our company, we're doing what we
call PSPS, um, public safety.
Proactive uh shutoffs and so
that's how we
are
working as a part of a team to
keep our communities safe. So
with that, we turn your support.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Conroy Chino, and I
represent the public of Taos and
Achema, and we are in support of
the legislation before you, um,
a good section of um the Carson
National Forest lies within the
boundaries of Taos Pueblo. It's
also surrounded by forest land
and state lands, and the concern
for the pueblo is that with lack
of consistent rainfall during
the monsoon season, and also the
lack of heavy snowfall has
created a rather
They are dangerous environment
for human life and structures
and communities, both tribal and
non-tribal. So with this
legislation and access to
funding, they're hoping to
create what's been described as
buffer zones around the
community as well as watersheds,
uh, a watershed in particular,
that's a source of fresh water
for the pueblo. So we are in
support of the legislation,
Madam Chair, and we urge the
committee's support as well. So
thank you very much.
Thank you.
Is there anyone online for in
sport or no one online in
support or in opposition. So
with that, I'll turn it over to
the committee, um.
We have questions from the
committee, Senator Townsend.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator, for bringing this
bill forward.
Um
I have more of a comment than
I'm, I support this
wholeheartedly.
I think one thing that was
telling
a few minutes ago this
kind of thing that drives me
crazy up here sometimes. We just
passed a bill.
this committee.
had $20 million expenditure for
$250,000.
Small feel thermal units.
And I supported that bill.
I'm, I, I did, and I think it's
good, but this bill.
can immediately touch almost.
Every life in the Mexico by
reducing insurance costs,
reducing power costs.
Um, enhancing the watershed.
Reduced in risk, I mean, and
we're spending $2 million a year
on it.
It is, it's enough to drive.
The sane man crazy thinking are
you deploy your capital.
Where it makes the most sense.
This bill ought to have.
I would vote for this bill if it
had $50 million on it.
Because
It affects all of New Mexico,
and it can do it quickly. It
employs people, it does lots of
good things. So I'm gonna, I'm
gonna support your bill,
absolutely.
But my goodness, um, you're
talking about chump change. This
is chump change to a great big
problem. So thank you both for
bringing Bill forward.
Thank you, Senator Townsend.
Anyone else?
I, I have a comment or a
question. Oh,
Oh, I'm sorry. Before I go, I'll
ask uh Senator Eel.
Thank you very, very much, Madam
Chair. I was reading, uh,
Under one of the analysis, the
comments made by the Attorney
General's office.
And he says unclearance section
2 under 68-4-5B1 and 2.
Like, uh, it's an
He is the Attorney general
stating why is it unclear, and I
go back and reference of that.
And it said it includes
treatment of private lands in
the division makes written
determination that the
incidental benefit to a private
landowner is outweighed by the
fired reduction in watershed
restoration benefits to the
state in you expound on that
just a little bit for me.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator.
So we do have that particular uh
letter from the opinion from the
Attorney General as well as um
the New Mexico Supreme Court has
repeatedly ruled that projects
that are undertaken for public
purpose, including projects on
private property that involve
only incident or non-incident.
In sequential benefit to private
entities don't violate the
anti-donation clause because
they are not donations at all.
And Madam Chair and or uh
Senator, this bill proposes to
authorize projects creating
buffer zones around
neighborhoods and vulnerable
community infrastructure, these
are, are public projects that
serve the very public purpose of
reducing wildfire risk to the
entire neighborhood.
OK, I just wanted that cleared
up, Mr. Madam Chairman, and
Representative of senator, one
other thing I'd like to point
out.
E.
I can't remember the
appropriation or how much money
is going to put in that fund.
me out here, I think I saw
something once upon a time.
For this bill is just making a
statement. OK.
Where they can get money from
the
Forest land Project protection
revolving fund.
And I do have to point out we
uh.
I have quite a lot of money to
spare out of that fund because
the poor US Forest Service has
tried to burn down our entire
state. Thank you very much.
That's all, Madam Chair.
Senator Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Mm
to what extent, if any?
Well, we'd be able to engage the
private sector.
To make beneficial from, I
presume.
These buffer zones are going to
be
Largely cleared of
tall vegetation.
To what extent, if any, can we
engage the private sector to
make beneficial use of this.
Material
Madam Speaker and Senator Scott,
so.
A lot of the theme that I have
with legislation this year is
one of the things we're really
proud of is the timber grading
bill.
So we are trying to stand up the
sawmill and Mescalero.
We have a lot of timber in
Lincoln County, and I, I don't
like to just focus on Linky
County. I hope we stand this up
in New Mexico wide and
With this timber grading bill
and with putting the sawmills
together and in this particular
legislation that we're talking
about now, we're gonna be able
to utilize and be able to take
that timber hopefully to our
local sawmills, get it graded
and instead of it going for
things like uh chicken pins and
panels and stuff, we're gonna be
able to
Get graded to where we can start
building houses and things of
that nature.
Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, and Senator Scott,
if I can uh further elaborate as
an example with Mori San Miguel
County Co op, uh electric uh uh
group there in in the mora Las
Vegas area. As an example,
there's a need to go ahead and
remove about 160,000 trees that
are right now, uh, creating, if
you will, uh, imminent danger
when it comes to the uh electric
lines that are in a lot of the,
the rural forest areas, and so
again, there's the need, if you
will, for not only the
g ation but also, if you will,
the restoration and we're trying
to keep these things separate as
we move forward, but the whole
key is, uh, as has already been
mentioned by several of you and
not only this committee, but uh
in your conversations with
others, uh, this definitely is
an issue and we want to try to
find ways to help to remedy the
uh the ongoing dangers that we
have. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
And
Madam Chair
Senator and representative do we
have any estimate?
Of how many potential jobs are
out there.
As a consequence of some of this
coming together. Madam Chair,
Senator Scott, if I can defer to
our expert to help us to to uh.
Identifying to respond to that.
Madam Chair and Senator Scott
based on some research that was
conducted a few years ago in
northern New Mexico for every $1
million we spend on tree
thinning and forest treatments,
uh, we are generating 22 jobs.
And Madam chair.
And sooner, that, that's if we.
If we are thinning.
To be thinning
Without the beneficial use of
what we've thinned. Is that
correct? Does, does that
include?
Not just the logging operations,
but the
Oh
Salt mill
Love the processing also.
That are just declaring.
Madam Chair and Senator, it's
been a while since I've read
that study, but I can certainly
follow up with you and um let
you know. I remembered the top
line number. There is an
indirect number associated with
it.
But I can't recall what that is
at this moment.
OK.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, gentlemen and ladies for
your answer.
Thank you, Senator Scott. I, I
have a question, and that is
what is a buffer zone look like
after it's turned into a buffer
zone.
Madam Chair and senator.
Ah
Typically, it's not entirely
cleared of trees. It is um
thinned, substantially.
And typically using a feathered
pattern so that um the
You have a greater clearance
around what firefighters call
values at risk, uh, general term
for a house, a power line, a
road.
Uh, or other infrastructure,
maybe um a mutual domestic water
supply well box, for example,
uh, but it's not, um, don't.
Don't think of it as like a
clear cut.
of the New York clearcut. That's
not what we're talking about.
Thank you. That's exactly my
question because I've seen
horrific linear clear cuts, um,
and so this would protect the
soil enough brush to prevent
runoff and and secure a healthy
area.
Is that correct, Madam Chair and
Senator, that is correct. And
often what we see
When we do the thinning is that
you have a tremendous, um, flush
of diverse herbaceous vegetation
on, on the forest floor that has
been, hasn't had sunlight
actually hit it for a long time,
but there's seed source there
and those um grasses and forbes
are uh creating a positive
diversity for wildlife, uh, and
also forage.
for livestock and elk.
Thank you. I think um
Of course, it's it given where
the bill is, I'm not gonna ask
for an amendment that would
suggest that this, uh, that the
area treated um.
I don't know, um, be healthy or
or or something like that, um,
because I expect that there's um
That there's compliance with
local laws and state laws and
regulation about not clear
cutting and not just bulldozing
the area.
Is that correct, Madam Chair,
Senator, yes. OK. Thank you. Um,
with that, if anyone, if no one
has any further questions, I'll,
I'll look for a motion. I make
it do that.
And I'll second.
OK, um,
Cha Stephonics, uh, with the
Dupas motion and Senator Pope
with the 2nd. Madam Secretary,
we call the roll.
San Cervantes. Cervantes, yes,
Senator Charlie.
Charlie, yes, and a.
And, yes, Senator Hamblin.
Senator Pope. Yes. Senator Pope,
yes, Senator Scott.
Now Scott, yes, Senator
Townsend.
Townsend, yes, Senator Di Lopez.
Yes, Senator Lopez, yes, San
Stephonics, yes, phonics, yes.
I believe you have a unanimous
due pass.
Congratulations, Senator
Representative. Thank you, Madam
Chair and members of the
committee, appreciate it.
Chas small.
Uh, HP 191.
Which is wildfire suppression
and preparedness funds.
And uh I'd like to ask, uh, Cha
Small is center compos your
sponsor in the in the Senate?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the uh
the committee, uh, if I may, I'd
like to go ahead and defer it
this time to uh representative
Small to go ahead and make the
opening remarks. I may have a
few, and then from there, of
course, uh also introduce uh or
have our experts introduce
themselves as uh we prepare
them, if you will, for
additional questions or
questions that might refer to
this specific piece of
legislation. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, members of the
committee, representative small,
please.
Uh, thank you, uh, Madam Chair.
Uh, thank you very much to
Senator Campos and Senator
Campos's leadership and so many
others in this body, uh, for,
uh, moving us forward, uh, Madam
Chair, committee.
House Corporations of Finance
Committee substitute for House
Bill 191, um, creates two funds,
uh, that are, uh, administered
by the Energy, Minerals and
Natural Resource department. I
wanna uh thank Director
McCarthy, um, uh, Mr. Davidson
from LSC, many others for
working closely to get the final
product.
There's 2, the two funds are the
post wildfire fund, uh, Madam
Chair, committee, and then the
wildfire suppression fund, Madam
Chair, really simply, we want to
make it um easier.
And more transparent, uh, with
the better ability to track all
funds and provide more funding
to fight fires and then also to
clean up after in the after
effects. This combined Madam
Chair committee with all the
other uh bipartisan efforts
around watershed health, forest
management, and others uh are
very needed for our state and uh
that's what our bill does again
after some really good work from
Director McCarthy, L.
and others, um, we're pleased to
be here today after coming over
from the house.
Madam Chair, if I may just, uh,
again, I want to go ahead and
thank uh Chairman Small for his
leadership. He's been to these
communities as an example of the
Las Vegas area, so he
understands if he will uh what
this has done to the
environment, he understands also
as we move forward in the area
of transparency, the resources
are definitely needed and this
is a uh clean way for uh in
terms of uh what we can do to
continue to help to mitigate and
if you will, also continue with
some of the other.
uh preventive issues as we deal
with the forest fires and what
it's done to our lands, to our
people, and to our animals.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
and uh with your indulgence just
uh briefly would like to have
the experts make a short
statement in terms of the work
that's gone into this bill, if
we may.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Madam Charon senators, I'm Laura
McCarthy, the state forester.
What I will add is that the
origins of this bill date back
to
The summer of 2023 and an
interim committee meeting that
was held at New Mexico Highlands
University in Las Vegas, where
in the Pew Charitable Trust was
invited to give a presentation
on how other states are dealing
with escalating wildfire costs,
and putting those costs on
budget and uh house Bill 191
does uh very closely mirror the
recommendations of the Pew
Charitable Trust.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Austin
Davidson. I work for the
Legislative finance committee
relating to natural resources,
and I would just add on
everything that the different
experts and representatives and
senators have said is that the
different definitions that exist
with both of these funds are in
line with the federal
reimbursements that would be
going into these funds, and that
was one of the main
conversations we had with uh
Steve Forrester. Thank you.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
the audience in support of this
bill?
Anyone in opposition.
You'd like to speak, um, please
come to the front.
Good morning, madam chair
members of the committee and
Madam Chair. Uh, my name is
Conrad Chino and I represent the
Pueblos Hotel and Acoma as I
indicated earlier, um,
We are in full support of the
legislation before you, um,
we're extremely concerned about
um the need for fire mitigation,
as well as suppression in the
event of a wildland fire, as I
mentioned earlier as well, with
the lack of moisture it's really
created a very threatening
situation, a threat to both
environment and human life as
well as natural resources, um,
Tas Pueblo does receive some
funding from the federal
government for suppression
efforts, uh, thinning.
projects and other activity like
that. Um, but unfortunately,
with lack of moisture again,
rainfall, snowfall has created a
good deal of amount of fuel and
vegetation again, adding to the
threat. Um, Tabubble does have a
fire preparedness plan in
conjunction with the state's
forestry division and has worked
out through consultation and
collaboration, this plan, so,
uh, certainly the funds that are
created by the
by this uh
legislation will work towards uh
assisting the Pueblo, which is
um very small, but, but, uh, you
know, it's surrounded by a good
deal of forest land, so, um,
with those uh um um with that
information, I'm, I'm sure we'll
be asked for your support. Thank
you.
Thank you, Mr. Chino.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is Eddie B.
Hill, registered lobbyist for
the New Mexico Soil and Water
Conservation Districts. We have
47 districts in the state and
there are numerous uh
Agent, you know, agents that
they come through our districts
through our soil and water
districts.
To be able to get this money on
the ground, we can work across.
All types of boundaries, sports,
BLM, um, state and private lands
so we do support this thing and
urge your support as well.
Thank you, Mr. Vi.
OK, and no one is online?
One person. Oh yes, Senator, or
no, send ronajoy or Ronnajoyson?
Run a joy. Thank you, Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
My name is Ronna Joyen from the
Pew Chatable Trusts, nonpartisan
nonprofit research and public
policy organization, and I'm
here to express Pew's support
for HP 191.
Our research has found that
state wildfire budging practices
are in need of reform as these
events have grown in severity,
frequency, and cost. HB 191
makes some important changes to
New Mexico's approach that
aligned with Pew's research and
recommendations, and many of
those benefits have already been
mentioned today.
Uh, with this bell, we see the
opportunity for New Mexico to
simultaneously enhance its
ability to manage wildfires, as
well as its long term fiscal
stability. Thank you. Thank you.
Do you have anything else,
Senator, Representative?
No, Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
All right, I'll turn it over to
the committee. Do we have any
questions? Senator Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't
see.
A prevention.
Component
In this so much.
Not an over
Uh, thank you very much, Madam
Chair, Senator Scott, I'm going
to defer to one of the experts
to help us respond. Madam Chair,
and Senator, um,
Let me get to the exact page one
of the allowable uses of the
suppression fund is to do the uh
prevention communications uh in
advance and during the fire
season, um, let's see where, I
guess that's section one.
B
I'm sorry, I have the wrong
version in front of me. I know
it's in there because we, it's
part of the committee
substitute.
Madam chair, Senator, that's a
great question. So I think the
definition that I think the
state forester is referring to,
it's going to be on that 2nd
page.
And it's going to be the
wildfire control and
suppression, so that was a
pretty broad scope and it can be
used for prevention measures.
Uh
OK.
Madam Chair.
Yeah,
that's right, page 2, Madam
Chair.
Oh
Oh, I representatives small.
Senator Miss McCarthy.
It looks like our
The Ma like our efforts.
Award mitigating.
effects of past wildfires.
should at least be matched.
My efforts to prevent future
war.
And what I would.
But I would very much like to
see.
Is the
development of an economy.
That does a couple of things.
Provides useful material.
build things with.
And simultaneously provides jobs
and simultaneously.
Mth Gates
The potential for
These wildfires to occur.
I
Is this piece of legislation
accomplish all three of those
goals, Madame Charon, if I may
like to, uh, Senator Scott
deferred to Chairman Small for
the response.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Uh, thank you, Senator
Scott, and thank you, um.
Senator,
uh, Madam chair, Senator, this
legislation is very much focused
on uh the suppression, the
fighting of fires, and the after
effects, but Madam Chair,
Senator, this legislature is
squarely focused exactly where
you stay in the budget that the
House sent over colleagues in
the Senate are working on now.
There's funding to restart a
sawmill in Lincoln County.
Excuse me, why did you chase
them up? We have a rule alone.
That somebody just chased it,
the cameraman out.
And we have a rule allowing
them.
Uh, Lucy, did somebody.
that
Oh, OK, OK, I just, I have post
traumatic stress about.
Either side
Right
OK.
I, I, uh.
I have post-traumatic stress. So
when I saw him being chased out,
it, it.
Raise that for me. So I
apologize. Um.
Would you please proceed,
Representative. Thank you, um,
I, I would just, um, really
thank you, Madam Chair.
Emphasize that there are active
efforts to restore forest to
manage forests in a more active
way, including thinning,
logging, and others. The purpose
of this bill is very squarely
focused on suppression, on
fighting fires in the
aftereffects and aligning with
best practices there.
I can turn it over to the
senator and Director McCarthy to
add a bit more.
Uh, Madam Chair. Thank you very
much, Madam Chair. Thank you,
Senator Scott. I'm gonna go
ahead and defer to uh to
McCarthy to go ahead and further
respond and then from there, if
there's something that's
missing, I'm gonna go ahead and
add that as well. Thank you,
Madam Chair, and Senator, the
Pew Charitable Trust gave us a
very useful framing to think of
it as mitigation, suppression,
and post-fire. House Bill 191
deals with
Parts 2 and 3, suppression and
post-fire, the bill you
discussed earlier, House Bill
175 is part of our mitigation
toolbox and as was previously
mentioned, we have many other
tools in our mitigation toolbox
and Madam Chair, uh, Senator
Scott, if I may just quickly as
we continue to go ahead and
develop, if you will, our
firefighting crews, uh, to go
ahead and also be very strategic
in terms of uh the work that's
going on with the Aseass with
land grants, with other
organizations.
This is a collaborative effort,
we realized the intensity and
the immensity of what we're
dealing with and so this again
is going to be one of those
additional pieces that has
already been discussed uh and
mentioned as part of the toolbox
that we're going to be using as
we go forward to help to
mitigate and hopefully uh save
lives, property, and of course
the lives of our animals as
well. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
And Madam Chair sent Rep and
Miss McCarthy.
much money is in this bill.
Uh, ma'am, sure, thank you,
Senator, uh, Senator with $12
million.
same question.
For the prevention portion on
one side.
Madam Chair, uh, Senator, of
course, the budget is, is here
with our colleagues as I recall,
we sent that over with over $20
million.
Uh, in different sort of forest
management focused
appropriations in addition to
that was, that those were
special non-recurring
appropriations on top of sort of
the base funding.
That I nerd in particular gets.
Right. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen. Thank you,
ma'am.
That's it for now.
Senator Ezel.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much.
Representative small and
senator, I do have a question.
Uh, my, my concern right now,
you've given us the
Mountain figures that's in this
band and what was in the in the
bill prior to this one.
That's an awful lot of money.
What are we doing so far as far
as erosion because it's also
talking about post wildfire
cost.
Uh, thank you very much, Madam
Chair, and of course, uh Senator
is, I'm gonna go and defer again
to uh
The expert who is dealing
directly with these issues there
on the ground. Thank you very
much.
Madam Chair, prior to
Um, this, this bill and
referring back to the special
session and House Bill 1 that
was passed, there was a $10
million appropriation to MED for
the post-fire work and about 8.5
million of that is going into
erosion control measures, uh,
in, uh, follow up to the South
Fork and salt fires. OK, well,
madam chair, I guess my question
is, what are we doing?
I want to know how this money's
being spent because what I've
seen so far is nothing.
So I do want an answer.
Madam Chair and Senator.
We have uh
completed a request for
proposals to develop a
contractor list of uh
contractors that can first
secure the landowner right of
entry and secondly, uh conduct
the erosion and um slow
stabilization measures that are
in the scope of work and the
first set of projects are
happening literally today as
we're here speaking.
These fires happened in June,
Madam here and here it is, the
getting close to, well, it is
the middle part of March.
Um
That the measures that will be
taking place.
Starting today or
That's my
Madam Chair and I'm not putting
all of this on your shoulders.
I'm not, I just want to know
what is happening because in
pastfiers such as the little
bear fire, the whatever they
call it the.
Blew to fire, I believe, up in
that particular area, all that
is growing back now is scrub
brush and cedar.
And we know what that's gonna do
whenever it ignites, it's gonna
be gone again. There's no
vegetation right now for, for
the wildlife team.
We know what cedars do. All they
do is drink up water, so I want
to know what measures are going
to be.
place
close by.
Madam Chair, I'll, I'll share,
and Senator, I'll share what I
know and I can follow up, uh, in
writing, uh, with, um, the
precise scope of work that, um,
the contractors are responsible
for carrying out, but in
general, it consists of
identifying the hazard trees,
uh, cutting them down, laying
them across the slope and then
using smaller pieces of wood to
anchor them in place, so that
they can serve a slope
stabilization purpose where
erosion control is the primary
objective.
Madam Chair, I guess there's a
lot, lots of areas to fill in
right there, isn't there?
Uh
I
I just really have a problem
with this, madam Chair, because
in some areas where some of
these trees are being laid down
to stop the erosion. I get it.
But unless we have something to
hold that dirt in place, there's
still going to be a problem.
As we've had
Pretty good.
That was right up there in
certain areas since that fires
have.
taken place
And uh
Some of those logs that were
laid down.
Perpendicular to the bottom of
the creek, uh.
Or parallel to the bottom of the
creek, they've already washed
and now they're back this way.
They are perpendicular now, so I
just, I have a problem with
We have that much money in there
representative small and.
My opinion, especially up in the
northern part of the state down
there in Reddo area.
The money needs to be spent.
And we need to have better
control of our force. We need to
have healthy force. Healthy
forest has.
co-chair was stating a while ago
a healthy forest has 50 trees or
less on it per acre.
Not 350 degrees on it.
We've seen what it's done to
people's lives and businesses
and wildlife and.
Livestock in the whole gamut of
it what watersheds in
particular.
And it's time that we started
moving some money to beneficial
use for those areas. Thank you
very much, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator, Madam Chair.
Uh, thank you, uh, Madam Chair.
Senator Campos, this is
specifically for you and maybe
the state forest or, uh, both
Highlands University and Luna
Community College.
As a project uh being led to
educate students, but also
hiring individuals to work after
the fire. Is this fun going to
assist those projects?
Madam Chair, what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna first say yes, but
then from there I want to also
ask uh our uh our expert to go
and elaborate, and then I would
like to follow up on that.
Madam Chair, we don't have uh
that work in place right now,
but there's absolutely no reason
that that can't happen as the
students develop the skill sets
and, um, as there is funding to
put them to work doing the post
fire restoration.
Uh, activities.
So, uh, before Senator compass
responses.
There are projects ongoing.
They've been going on for a year
or two now. We've heard this at
the water and Natural Resources
Interim Committee. So,
Where is that funding coming
from?
Madam Chair, I'm not sure which
projects specifically and
there's a number of uh,
Funding sources, including um a
variety of them through FEMA,
but I can certainly follow up
and let you know. Thank you,
Senator. Thank you very much,
Madam Chair, and thank you very
much for your ongoing commitment
to assist with so many of these
events that have occurred,
particularly in the Pecos area
of the Las Vegas area dealing
with our watersheds, and you
continue to go ahead and be a
fighter, if you will, for uh
helping us to uh mitigate and of
course to continue to improve,
if you will, our, our forest
lands. So a few of
things that have been ongoing
number one there at New Mexico
Highlands University, we do have
afforestation project and a
program there as we go forward,
we have the forestation projects
and uh we are gonna be setting
up, if you will, uh, one of
those forest projects there in
the Mora area where they'll be
seedlings that'll be grown and
then from there, of course,
replanted up in our uh our hills
and mountains in the areas where
the forests are, uh, there's
ongoing efforts, if you will, to
develop uh the uh hotshot.
Dorenes, and we have one there
scheduled for Secorro as well as
for the Las Vegas area. So
again, there is a lot of work
that is ongoing and I realized
that when we start talking about
the funds that help to mitigate
and if you will, the uh people
that are involved, there's a lot
of efforts, but I'm gonna go
back, Madam Chair, and again,
thank you very much, Senator
Reel. As we move forward, we
want these resources to be
there. We want them to be
available. We might be behind in
some areas, but
doing everything possible again
thanks to the legislature to go
ahead and catch up and to stay
ahead and again, thank you very
much to Chairman Small for the
ongoing efforts through HAFC and
what he has been doing to help
to bring together, if you will,
a lot of these efforts. The last
thing that I would mention.
Madam chair as we go forward
when we start talking about our
energy natural resources, and if
you will, our water, there's
still a lot of work to be done.
In fact, they're in the Las
Vegas area right now. We're
continuing to deal with, if you
will, some of these aftermaths
uh regarding the the water
situation, it's not only, if you
will, with our dams with surface
water, with the water that that
flows if you will, because of uh
erosion that goes through our se
we're dealing with all these
issues.
issues, but we need to have the
concerted effort in order for us
to be able to go forward,
otherwise, as a state we're not
going to be successful,
particularly when it comes to
the uh fire season that is
ahead. Thank you very much,
Madam Chair.
Anyone else?
All right, um.
Do your motion.
Madam chair, I move a do pass on
how appropriations and Finance
Committee substitute for House
Bill 191.
OK with that, madam chair, would
you call the rope?
Cervantes, I'm sorry we didn't,
yeah, never mind, go ahead.
You did it.
I want to see a Senator Charley.
Senator Charlie, yes, Sanel.
Yes. There, yes, Senator Hamlin.
Excuse sinner Pope. Yes, and a
Pope, yes, Senator Scott.
Scott, yes, Senator Townsend.

Lopez, yes, Lopez, yes, and
Stephonics, yes, Sanophonics,

OK, our next bill is H oh, I'm
sorry, uh.
Thank you.
I in a hurry. So I'm, um, so
with a vote of 8 to 0, you have
received a depress.
Congratulations, Senator
Representative Thank you, Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
Thank you.
So our next bill is HB 308,
which was a committee
substitute.
And I noticed
Sara.
You'll be appearing for
Armstrong?
And is
OK.
Perfect.
So, Senator Azel, whenever
you're ready.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee today we are
here presenting.
Oh, let me look at this right
real fast. Pass your judiciary
Committee substitute for House
Bill 308.
And it does contain an emergency
clause.
Madam Chair members of the
committee what HB 308 does is
remove conservancy districts
from the local election Act.
And joining me today is.
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Jason
Kosuga and I'm the CEO and chief
engineer for the Midd Rio Grande
Conservancy District.
Adams here
Conservancy districts are
statutorily special districts.
Since the passage of the local
Election Act in 2018, no
conservancy district has held an
election under the Election Act.
There are only 2 conservancy
districts in existence, and this
bill gives administration of
these elections back to the
Conservancy districts, but that
we will stand for questions.
I think my members of the
audience and oh.
Mr.
OK, Kusaga, you said?
Thesuga
Massuga. Thank you. And again,
on behalf of the board of
directors of the Rio Grande
Conservancy District. Thank you,
um, for the opportunity to be
here. Thank you for the bill's
sponsors. Um, again, the
This is the process that the
MRGCD has worked on faithfully
um with the Secretary of State's
office to seek on how to
implement the Local Elections
Act that was passed in 20018, uh
this was worked on and an
extension was needed in 2023,
um, and we have continued to
work on that with the Secretary
of State's office in conjunction
with the 6 Mid Rio Grande
Pueblos, um, and we are here
before you again today because
um
Our elections as a special
district are not compatible with
the local Elections Act.
So with that, I'm, I'm happy to
stand for questions as well.
Thank you. Is it all?
Madame Che what this basically
does its standards, standardizes
the election governance by
defining key terms, creating the
role of election director and
outlining new requirements for
compiling qualified electoral
lists. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
the audience in support of this
bill?
Oh. Is there anyone opposed?
OK, if you can come up and speak
briefly in support of the bill,
and please try not to repeat
points that have been made by
prior speakers.
Thank you, Madam Chair members
of the committee, Larry Harran
registered lobbyist for the
Pueblo of Sandilla. We
appreciate the sponsors bringing
this measure forward. What this
does is it put the the elections
for the conservancy districts
back to what they used to be,
which is for property owners
within the district, so those
who have um rights and, and
interests in the water in these
elections for the um election of
conservacy district directors,
so we appreciate the efforts
over the years. This is a high
priority for the Pueblo of San
Di. In fact, it's our highest
priority this session, so we
and urge your support. Thank
you, Madam Chairman of this
committee.
Madam Chair and members of the
committee, I'm Mark Duran. I
represent Santo Domingo Pueblo,
and on behalf of Governor
Mochino and our tribal council,
we, uh, support this piece of
legislation, Madam Chair, in
2018 when we consolidated
elections, uh, we then soon
realized that one size didn't
fit all and especially when it
came to conservancy districts
where the electorate is private
property owners as opposed to
what the county clerk.
and the Secretary of State
office traditionally used, which
are voter registration rules,
hence us needing to have
separate elections, hence us
supporting this legislation, and
we hope you will too. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chairman,
members of the Committee. Mickey
Barnett appearing on the behalf
of Pueblo of Santa Ana and
Governor Armijo strongly support
this act.
This, as was just described,
it's extraordinarily difficult
to try to maintain a voter role
that includes electors to vote
in the New Mexico elections,
local elections, and one that's
only private property owners
within the district. It proved
to be untenable and unworkable,
and I cannot see any way it
could be done, so I urge you to
pass this bill. Thank you.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, committee members,
my name is Kathy Elliott and I
am the registered lobbyist for
Arch Hurley Conservancy
District, Arch Hurley is the um
amendment on this um bill and we
appreciate them adding us to it
because we are the 2nd
conservancy district in the
state. Um, we are located in
Quay County and as much as um
we'd like to work with our
county clerk, Ellen White there.
She is unable to do these
elections. These elections
actually also have
ballots and everything else that
you would like to be included in
a regular election act, but they
are unable to do that for us. So
for these reasons, we stand in
support of this bill. Thank you
very much. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, John Thompson,
registered lobbyist for the
Little Rio Grande Conservancy
District. I won't repeat all the
things that were said covers
everything I was going to say,
but we would strongly, uh,
strongly request your support in
this legislation. Thank you very
much.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, members of the
committee. My name is John
Martinez. I'm here representing
conservation V voters in New
Mexico, and for all of the
reasons people have already
stated in the name of good
governance and better
representation, we ask you to
support this.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Lindsay
Bachman. I'm the director of
legislative and executive
affairs for the Secretary of
State's office. We thank the
sponsors for bringing this bill
forward. It does represent years
of conversations with our office
and we believe the existing law
is administratively unworkable
at this time and encourage a do
pass.
Thank you. And we have one
person uh in support of this
bill, Melina.
Ortiz.
Melina, Melena Ortiz.
Good morning, Chair and
committee members. My name is
Malena Ortiz and I am a
registered lobbyist for the
Pueblo of Isleta and the Pueblo
of San Felipe, and for the
reasons stated previously, the
Pueblo support House Bill 308
and urge your support. Thank
you.
Thank you, Ms. Ortiz.
All right, so we have heard
nothing but support for this
bill, uh, no one in opposition.
Let's go ahead and turn it over
to the committee.
Madam Chair
Uh, thank you, um, Madam Chair
and thank you for everyone for
being here and welcome
Representative Lunte and
Senator.
Mr. Fasuga, um,
We heard this in the Senate
rules and Senator Townsend and
I, and we understand the need
and I wanted to clarify, uh, I
live.
Totally South and of Santa Fe,
and yet I'm in a soil and water
conservation district its way
north.
So every time it appears on the
ballot, it confuses.
So I think that having the
conservation uh districts.
do their own thing would be
great.
That's the only time I have.
Thank you Madam Chair.
All right, um, there's a motion
on the floor and senator
Cervantes, do you have
questions? Questions. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you.
observed.
Rio, the um
And reading through this real
quickly, the vote of an elector
in a conservancy district is
based on property ownership. If
I understand this, is that
right?
Mr. Cham and Madam Chairman,
Senator Cervantes said is
correct and so anybody who owns
any acreage at all get a boat?
Miss Madam Chair.
Which one of y'all are must best
be addressing said Dia Lopez. Is
that correct, as chair, Madam
Chair, and Senator, yes. Right.
To.
Yeah, I, that's right. Excuse
me, it is 2 or more acres, more
acres and, and anyone with two
or more acres gets a single
vote.
Yes.
And I heard a number of
representatives here for various
uh pueblos and such, do, do
members of the Pueblo uh own the
property that is on the pueblo
itself and so that do they then
get a vote?
Representative Viente uh Lente,
welcome to the committee and uh
please apologize for being late.
Madam Chairwoman and, and
senator, yes, they do get a
vote. All members of the tribe
over the age of 18 are property
majority owners of the, of
tribal land as community
property, so they would all get
a vote.
So the, so the tribal lines own
ask to community property. Yeah,
dude since nobody owns property
per se in any one of the Pueblo
communities, uh, it's owned as a
tribal nation, so anyone over
the age of majority, which is
18, uh, is considered a property
owner in the Pueblo, and so
therefore they would get a vote
in this election.
And so going back to Senator
Townsend's point, you, you, you
have to have 2 acres of
ownership. So how do you then
remember of the pueblo have two
owner, 2 acres of ownership that
I tell you to about, yeah, and,
and Madam chairwoman and and
senator.
Sure, sure. So, so in currently.
I'm being directed to page
number 3, but large and in part,
uh, this, this goes even further
into more of a sovereign
immunity or a sovereignty issue
where uh
leaders of those respective
publics have the authority to
determine, uh, land ownership
and or uh membership in their
tribes. And so therefore they
provided qualified electors
list, uh, at the beginning of
every election, therefore
identifying those members who
are age of 18 and over, uh, that
are qualified electors for this
election.
Well I appreciate the fact that
the
Pueblo can designate a list and
I'm just trying to make sure
that, that we're not doing
things that are inconsistent
within the law. So if the law I
heard Senator Townsend's point
earlier, and he, he was making
the point perhaps to help you
all on the panel. He said you
have to have 2 acres of
ownership for a vote, and so if
you don't have 2 acres of
ownership.
And your equivalent member, how
do you
Reconcile the fact you gotta
have 2 acres to vote and, and
that.
How do you get, how do you get a
vote? I'm still trying to figure
that out. I mean, I understand
the, the problem may say, here's
our list of people that are
qualified electors, but it does,
does that um conflict with the
statute itself, which says you
have to own the two acres.
Or, or where, where's this,
where's the, where's the
authority of the public in this
year that it clarifies that
voting right.
Madam Chair, um, members of the
committee, um,
I do wanna make sure I clarify
the Rio Grande Conservancy
District is part of um
conservancy Districts created
under the Conservancy Act and
the qualified um elector.
Means, and this is current law,
an individual who owns real
property within the benefited
area of the conservancy District
and who has provided proof of an
ownership interest to one of the
sources specified in subsection
B of subsection 73, 14, 20.1, um
NMSA 197, 1978 within the
required time period or who
resides on and owns legal or
equitable title in tribal lands
and who is over the age of
majority, uh, Madam Chair,
members of the
um,
there are soil and water
conservation districts and then
there are actually conservancy
districts, and those are two
separate sections of state law,
um, that I think oftentimes get
conflicted, uh, and so in this
instance, I do want to make sure
I, I, um, draw your attention to
the current legal definition of
a qualified elector for
conservancy districts, um, that
were created by conservancy, by
the Conservancy Act.
Madam Chair, so, uh, so that was
the definition you were just
reading was from the conservancy
definition of a qualified
elector.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh, members of
the committee, that is correct.
That is the current law as it
sits today.
I am.
have mixed feelings about this,
but I, I guess I understand from
the, from the presentation, I
can understand how it would be
very difficult to run an
election when it's based on
those qualifications and put
that in a.
a regular local election, I
think that the um local Election
Act was designed to try and
encourage more and more
participation in elections and
to try and put the
Some of these special elections
within the framework of all of
our other elections, but I can
see where it would be difficult
to do that when it's based again
on the, the definitions you just
went through and and trying to
understand.
Um
I think that's all the questions
I have.
Um, I have Senator Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
to
Uh.
How do we run these paper
ballots, mail in.
So
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, um, the Grand
Conservancy District has
administered our elections, as I
understand Arturley has
administered their elections in
the Middle Rio Grande
Conservancy District has
administer administered ours
since 1976. Um, that current
process is um by ballot, uh,
that there is an absentee
process that existed in 2023.
The current law as it sits
today, um, if this uh substitute
is passed that would require an.
updated rulemaking process, um,
that would include, um, having
to re go through and identify uh
voting methods, which did not
Rio Grande Conservancy District,
passed a resolution prior to the
introduction of this bill, um,
committed to, um, when we have
to do that updating.
Rulemaking process to implement
election procedures that promote
voter participation, including
but not limited to early voting,
absentee ballot, mail in voting,
um, and any other voting method
that's legal under state law.
And
Madam Chair, Jason, there's no
component.
In the selection of
Um,
how many acres?
The
Prospective voter might.
Hold within the.
Insurgency District. It's one
vote per
How many acres?
Madam Chair members of the
committee, um, that is correct.
It's one vote.
landowner. So, um, for example,
Madam Chairman of the committee,
if you owned two separate
properties within the same, um,
County, you do not get to vote
twice. It is one vote per.
Um.
Per per qualified elector.
OK.
Madam Chair.
Hey Jason, did I hear you say
one vote per acre?
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, one vote per
qualified elector.
And it doesn't matter how many
acres that collector may control
within the conservancy.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, that is correct.
Thank
Thank you. um.
I just want to clarify and it's
nobody else asking questions. I
just want to clarify there are
only 2 conservancy districts
that were affected by the two
that happened in 2018.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I'm only aware of two
conservancy districts formed
under the Conservancy Act that
were affected by um this one.
Of the Middle Rio Grande
Conservancy District and Arch
Hurley Conservancy District. And
so, uh, just to clarify what has
happened since 2018 because it's
shocking that there has not been
an election, so the existing
board governing board has just
continued with no new election.
What has happened? Madam Chair,
members of the committee.
In 2023, an emergency bill was
passed to um
To defer and allow MRGCD to
conduct its own election in
2023, uh, while the Secretary of
State's office in the Rio Grande
Conservancy District continued
to work on this issue together
with the six metal Rio Grande
Pueblos. So the middle Rio
Grande Conservancy District
again in 2023, administered its
own election, uh, but that, um,
bill was for the 2023 election
only. Um, and there was a new
deadline set to work with the
Secretary of State's office and
that deadline passed.
Uh, and so as the law sits today
of the Middle Rio Grande
Conservancy District, um,
without this would have to try
to administer an election,
actually, it wouldn't be the
middle Rio Grande Conservancy
District. It would be the
counties under the guidance of
the Secretary of State to
administer the conservancy Act,
or sorry, the Middle Rio Grande
Conservancy District and
Archurley Conservancy District
elections.
So there, and, and what has
happened with the, with the, the
other conservancy district. The
2nd conservancy just.
Do we know what happened with
him, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I, I am not up to
speed on exactly what our truly
conservancy District did in
2023.
And I, I just received a note
from Madam Cheer saying that
there are 13 conservancy
districts with the question
mark.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee in terms of
conservancy districts affected
by this law. And again, I want
to draw your, the word
conservation and conservancy, so
you, there are conservancy
districts like the um Pagos
artesian Conservancy District
that is different than the
Middle Rio Grande Conservancy
District and the Arch-Hurley
Conservancy District.
So in terms of conservancy
districts affected by this law,
by the Conservancy Act itself
and the the sections that are
cited in.
This bill substitute, um, we are
only knowledgeable of 2, and
that is in coordination with the
Secretary of State's office as
well, Madam Chair, and that is
because these two require
property ownership.
For the election process, is
that why?
Madam Chair, um,
I believe that is one of the
issues is property ownership for
the Middle Rio Grande
Conservancy District, it is
also, um, the significance of um
tribal participation within the
Middle Rio Grande Conservancy
District, the Middle Rio Grande
Conservancy District spans 4
counties, um, and across those
four counties there are 6
separate pueblos, um, that are
affected by this, so the uh
That's the that's what makes
them the middle Rio Grande
Conservancy District, a special
district, um, in that sense.
But this act provided to all
conservancy districts if they
choose to do it this way.
Madam Chair, um, members of the
committee, it only provides for
conservancy districts that were
created, um, within.
And organized on page 8, on page
2 line 8 organized pursuant to
the Conservancy Act of New
Mexico.
That's correct and then Madam
Chair, um, the reason why the
bill is is quite a bit longer is
within that section. There's two
types of conservancy or
conservancy districts, a
conservancy district greater
than 100,000 acres and then a
conservancy district less than
100,000 acres. Um, and so the
first, I believe 70 from um
73, 1418 through 30 something
deals with uh conservancy
districts greater than 100,000
acres, and then the remaining
section back half deals with
conservancy districts less than
less than 100,000 acres.
OK, that explains some of my
confusion with, with, OK, then
that actually answers a couple
more questions that, that I had.
Um, and I see on page 5 that it
defers to to sovereignty by by
having the pueblo compile the
list.
Within the area, so that the
state doesn't identify who the
electors are, the Pueblo does,
is that correct?
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, that is correct and
that has been ongoing um since
um MRGC has been administering
it selection since 1976.
And it does have an emergency
clause. Madam Chair, members of
the committee, that is correct.
Thank you. I, I better
understand the bill, um, and I
thought I was the last person
with questions unless anybody
has anybody else, anything else,
I'm happy to know it and Senator
Charlie made a motion.
OK, Senator Pope, for a second,
um, Madam Secretary, will you
call the roll?
Sano Cervantes Senator
Cervantes, yes, Senator Charlie.
And Charlie, yes, send herself,
yes,
yes, Senator Hamlin.
Excused Senner Pole.
Yes. And our Pope, yes, and
Scott.
Scott, yes, Cenator Townsend.
Townsend, yes, Senator to Dia
Lopez. Yes, there's I Lopez and
Stephonics. Stephonics, yes.
Senator Charlie, you wanted to
explain your vote.
Madam Terror, um, Senator
Representative, thank you for
bringing this forward. Not only
is this important for the 6
pueblos in the Middle Rio
Grande, but if we did not pass
this, it would have likely been
a violation of the Native
American Voting Rights Act, um,
that was worked on, um, several
sessions ago and I just wanted
to take the opportunity to
remind, um,
The committee that in the United
States, there are 3 sovereigns
with the federal government as a
sovereign, the state as a
sovereign and tribal nations are
uh a sovereign in and of
themselves. And so when it comes
to land and land issues,
particularly for this um um
amendment or this bill that's
moving it, moving forward, um,
land that it's held in trust as
it was established through our
trust in Treaty responsibilities
with the federal government
needs to be recognized.
and um I applaud you for
bringing this for. I wish that
Federal Indian government was
taught in all law schools across
the country so that we could
mitigate these issues from the
onset. Thank you, mountain
chair.
Thank, thank you, you with a
vote of 8 yes, 0 no, when
excused, you received a due
pass. Congratulations. And now
it's onto the floor, right?
All right.
So, um, members of the
committee, we are meeting on
Saturday at 9 a.m. We have 7
bills that we will hear and we
are at the point of time when
other items might get added to
our agenda.
So we will try to stay ahead of
any analysis, but uh right now
we're scheduled for 7 bills on
Saturday morning, there will be
another burrito breakfast
provided. Thank you very much.
