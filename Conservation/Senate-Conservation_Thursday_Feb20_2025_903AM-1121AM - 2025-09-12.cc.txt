um the committee sub, but before
we get started, I'd like to uh
thank again all the egg groups
that provided breakfast
yesterday morning.
We had the cattle growers, the
wool growers, the farm and
livestock Bureau, the dairy
producers.
Uh, the chili producers, the
pecan growers, the egg truss,
the egg credit outfitters and
guides, wine growers.
The Association of Conservation
Districts in the Department of
Agriculture, and we thank you
all, uh, for putting together
our breakfast yesterday morning.
Yes.
May I make a comment?
Folks, uh.
Our median ages now for farmers
and ranchers is up into the 60s
of production has skyrocketed
tractor right now just a basic
tractor is over.
I'm thinking it's around
$200,000 combine is.
In excess of $700,000 and that
might be run two months out of
the year.
Madam, cheer whenever I see the
people out there.
Actually working the land.
I call it boots on the ground.
Trying to provide food for all
of its citizens, if not, and
we're at less than 1.8% that
total population that does feed
the world.
kind of scary to me.
Uh, the innovations that these
folks do make to.
Make to ensure that we do have a
safe food product out there.
Oh
It's, it's astounding what has
happened. One thing I don't
here.
Oh
The dairy producers provided us
with.
Certain type of milk that was
developed here in this and I
hope everybody got a bottle of
it. It was, uh, help me out
here.
Yeah, Fairla is just these
processes that we have to go
through.
Along with all the rules and
regulations that have come out
that is making it harder and
harder.
And uh
Whenever our children grow up in
that environment.
But they know that they can't
stay there any longer.
They can't afford to buy the
land, they can't afford, they
don't have the capital to get
the job done anymore.
And to me, we're sitting on.
Seesaw that is not in our favor,
OK? Um.
It makes me real sad whenever I
drive down through my valley.
And see all the
Fallow farmland that's down
there now.
That's due to.
Some issues that came up earlier
on in my life, uh, where we had
to be in compliance with other
states as far as delivery of
water whenever I see a.
Interstate stream commission
that has bought up all these
farm lands whenever I see the
game and fish here we go, boys,
y'all hang on now. Whenever I
see game and fish buying up land
that has now been taken off the
tax basis for that particular
county.
Whenever I see.
The mini
We don't have to go to Las Vegas
to gamble, folks. We do it every
day.
And I'll tell you what,
sometimes that roll of the dice
is just hitting us harder than
we have to.
We've seen farm agencies uh from
the federal level that have come
in after devastating floods or
fires.
That have hit
crop lands.
Esterlands
And they're saying you can't do
anything to these lands until we
come out and get it surveyed.
Till we assess the damage folks
in my area they have yet to be
to come out and see those lands
and the way they've been
affected.
They have told us if you've lost
a fence during any of the
floods, don't build it back
until we come out and take a
look. Well, you know what,
folks?
I want my animals to be
protected and I can't get them
gathered up until we do get
fences rebuilt. So that's what I
get to go home and do.
But if we move the fence we have
to have an archaeological
survey, and we get to pay for
that.
Folks,
We can't even find help anymore
that wants to work in the
agricultural sector.
It's a shame that we still don't
have.
Madam, I'm gonna preface this
with say whenever I was growing
up we had the bracero program
that was in effect.
And that was a good program.
These people came up from Mexico
to help farmers and ranchers on
their, on their places.
And it was a thriving industry
then as far as farmers went.
It's a good way to grow up.
But whenever
All that went away they these
these men that did come over.
My dad and all the farmers down
there on cottonwood, uh.
They took care of those people
that did come over to work,
saved up their money or sent it
home so their family could come
over here and get legal.
Have a better way of life.
We don't have that option
anymore, unfortunately, we have
lazy Americans.
And if you think I'm stepping on
toes.
I probably am.
I still have to work for a
living and I'm in my 70s now.
I'm tired of paying for
everybody else.
I've worked hard.
Along with my husband.
Pay for what we have.
And it hasn't been an easy job.
And this goes on to what we're
seeing right now in the grocery
stores we've got flu uh bird flu
epidemic that is affecting the
price of eggs whenever they're
over $8 a dozen.
That hits people hard in their
pocketbook.
Whenever we've got special
interest groups that are out
there telling us we cannot
protect our livestock.
Because
We don't want you shooting our
coyotes folks.
That's my private property out
there, that is my way of making
a living.
And I do a damn good job of it.
And yes, I'm kind of uh.
I'm no, I'm not kind of, I'm
passionate about this, about
this way of life that we have.
We've got companies coming in
that uh are not always taken
into account the best interests
of all the people of the state
of New Mexico. We've got
agencies that.
I basically put the cotton
business.
Out of business in the state of
New Mexico.
Right now there's only 2 cotton
gins left in the state of New
Mexico. One of them is an
artesian in Mexico, the other
one is um.
Environment Department just
keeps layering on layers and
layers of.
more red tape that we have to go
through.
And you know what, whenever I
need to be out there working,
but I have to take care of.
business over here that I've
gotten a letter on that says you
must respond to this next number
of days.
Folks, there's a problem out
there.
Our life has become so calm and
I'm not just saying farmers and
ranchers, I'm saying everybody
out there.
We've seen industries that have
literally left our state because
of the rules and regulations
that have come, Madam Chair,
what I'm saying here is what
future do we have for our kids
if we keep imposing more
stringent rules and regulations
on our kids.
On the, on their madam chair.
I just want people to
understand.
That we're not the bad guys in
this game.
We are not the bad guys.
I have a sign up at the entrance
of my ranch.
That says to protect and care
for all of this creation, God.
And God bless my farmers and
ranchers.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator.
Um
And one other piece of business,
I forgot to mention is that
Senate Bill 342.
Will be rolled over, that's the
brackish water because uh it
looks like there is one coming
from the house. They'll set a
bill 342.
So, Senator Woods, uh, you're
ready to go?
Yes, ma'am. I'm ready to go and
I think
Senator for her comments
couldn't have said it better.
Today we take up
Senate Bill 56 1 more time.
And this bill has been
rewritten.
And just for, just for a brief
recount.
This is related to livestock.
And dancing a new section of the
livestock code restricting
access to certain information
regarding livestock owners.
They're animals and their
operations during
investigation and responses to
the animal healthy.
That is just the pre-emblem of.
This particular bill
And I'm going to let the uh.
vet
Um
Samantha.
Talk just a minute. Describe the
bill more fully now the
amendments that we made in this
bill, madam Chair, I know that
you want to rush as much as
possible.
rush we don't have that many
bills this morning. Uh, I need a
motion.
Uh, for a do not pass and a do
pass for De Lopez.
Uh, Madam Chair, I, I, uh, move
a do not pass for SB
and I have a 2,
please? Just a minute.
There is a 2nd. Now, Senator
Woods would be 230087.5. Yes.
Thank you. So please proceed.
morning, Madam Chair and members
of the committee. I really
appreciate the opportunity and
the feedback that we received at
the last committee, uh.
Member meeting and uh I did take
into account the feedback that
we received in the revision of
this bill, and that is what is
proposed to you.
Um, one of the, the changes of
course is to expand it.
Oh, OK.
Um, so from the very beginning
I'm expanding it um to go beyond
disease investigations, I think,
um, Senator Stefanis made a
really great point about PAS and
um other animal health events
that do, um, affect our
livestock industry that could be
encompassed in this.
I, I also incorporated Senator
Cio Lopez's comments about sort
of redirecting the purpose um to
encourage participation of
producers.
In those investigations.
Um, likewise, I um I did address
some of Senator Cervantes's
concerns, um.
And specifically um.
I did
Correct the language about the
veterinary client patient
relationship to bring it in line
with what is in statute.
So veterinary client patient
relationship itself is defined
in statute and then further um
defined as to how that.
Veterinary client patient
relationship is established in
rural and the confidentiality
associated with that, which is
also unreal, I understand rule
is not statute, but those are
the references that we have
available to us.
Um
I tried to more explicitly list
the things that we are
requesting to have protected.
As far as this information.
And also, um, explicitly
described the the collaboration
that we would have with state
and federal agencies for that
protecting information would
still be available during active
investigations to those
agencies.
Um, further removed the very
last paragraph, um, because of
the, the, the risk of broad
interpretation there and so um.
In further reviewing that
decided that the very final.
Um, paragraph which I believe
was D3 in the most recent
substitute, um.
That language has been
completely. Thank you, Belinda,
did you want to send?
Uh, please introduce yourself
for the record and then go
ahead.
Thank you Madam Chair, member of
the committee. I'm Belinda
Garland. I am the executive
director for the New Mexico
Livestock org. I just want to
thank you for your time again
this morning on this bill. We
think this is very, very
important for the preservation
of just.
The farm in the ranch lifestyle
as well as the food stores, not
only for the state of New
Mexico, but also the world and
so uh we just think that.
Preserving, identifiable
information in any type of uh
request is just crucial to us
containing any type of health
condition within our livestock
industry.
we stand for question. Thank you
very much. So there is a
substitute and it was.
So, uh, has anybody in the
audience see.
OK, you have, Mr. Patterson. Is
anybody else? OK.
Is there anybody here to?
OK, is there anybody here to
oppose is there anybody online
for this film one in support
online. OK, so let's have a few
comments from the audience, uh,
we actually have 10 minutes set
aside for comments, support, and
opposition. Uh, let's
No, thank you.
Introduce yourself for the
record and then you have a
minute or so. Great. Thank you,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. I'm Beverly Itzinga,
executive director of Dairy
Producers of New Mexico. I won't
belabor you with the same
comments that I gave in the
previous committee on this bill
about the timeline when it hit
the dairy industry and
everything and later to be
discovered to be avian
influenza. I do want to add on
to there that I talked to uh
Doctor Robert Hagavot about this
piece of legislation. He's a
dairy extension specialist out
of New Mexico State University,
and he said if we had
something like this in place
before avian influenza hit New
Mexico that we would have had
better access to dairies, um,
for additional testing if they
had um anonymity. All of our
producers were willing to
participate, go above and beyond
to find out what this was and
after it was to find out any
answers to questions they might
have had, but they wanted more
anonymity, so they wouldn't be
targeted for various reasons. If
you have any other questions
about the timeline, I'm willing
to answer those as well, but I
think the sponsor for bringing
this forward, and I think Doctor
Ho.
I think Belinda, the Livestock
Board, the Department of
Agriculture, the Department of
Health, everybody that was on
several calls a day dealing with
this since the spring of last
year. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Gillian Joyce. I am the
government relations advocate
for Rocky Mountain Farmers
Union, representing farmers and
ranchers from across New Mexico.
We believe this legislation
strikes a necessary balance
between protecting legitimate
privacy interests of livestock
producers, maintaining essential
disease tracking and control
measures, and ensuring
appropriate transparency when
public health is at stake. If we
fail to protect these privacy
interests, producers may
hesitate to report disease
outbreaks promptly. This
acceptances would hamper our
ability to track outbreaks
effectively, compromise food
system safety and ultimately
increase the risk of animal
suffering, threats to rural
livelihoods, supply chain
issues, and potential health
emergencies. I hope you will
vote in support of the committee
substitute for Senate Bill 56.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. I'm Larry
Reagan, president of New Mexico
Farm and Livestock Bureau, Farm
Bureau supports this bill for
all the reasons already stated.
If farmers.
They're not gonna come forward
and that endangers public
safety. Thank you. Please
support this bill.
Madam Chairwoman, committee
members Tom Patterson, New
Mexico cattle growers.
You've heard from the dairy
producers.
You've heard from the farmers.
And the cattlemen agree.
This is important.
It's important to protect
integrity of our food system in
New Mexico.
Please, we urge you to vote in
favor of it and give a due pass
to SB 56 as amended. Thank you.
Thank you. Online I have.
I don't know if it's Marston
Wilson.
Marshall Wilson.
Go ahead, please.
Good morning, Madam Cur. Can you
hear me?
Hello?
Yes, we can hear you. Go ahead.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. uh,
thank you for this opportunity
to comment on this proposed
legislation. My name is Marshall
Wilson, and I serve as the
co-director of the Southwest
Border Food Protection and
Emergency Preparedness Center.
In this role, I helped plan for
and respond to emergencies
affecting agriculture.
Which includes animal health
events.
Senate Bill 56 addresses
critical challenges identified
during past emergencies, most
recently the H5N1 outbreak in
dairy cattle that was spoken by
by previous presenters.
At its core, the bill
strengthens strengthens the New
Mexico Livestock Board's ability
to protect the food supply chain
while promoting business
continuity for our farms and
ranches. It achieves this by
safeguarding biosecurity details
and personally identifiable
information.
Timely and accurate information
sharing is essential for an
effective crisis response.
Senate Bill 56 encourages this
by protecting shared information
while ensuring the New Mexico
Livestock Board can continue.
To effectively coordinate with
other state and federal
partners. Madam Chair, I thank
the sponsor for bringing forward
this legislation, and I thank
the committee for bringing it
under consideration. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Is there,
was there any opposition? OK, we
are now to questions, comments
from committee members.
Senator Dio Lopez.
Uh
Thank you, Madam Chair. I really
appreciate this, this like.
Rewrites about the last bill,
um, and I wanted to just say
with regard to Ira, I can't
remember how much we talked
about it, but there's a
provision in IPRA that says his
otherwise provided by law and
what this does is otherwise
provides by law, and so I, I
just think it's a really good
rewrite. I have a question and
perhaps the chair of judiciary
uh will answer it cause I can't.
I don't the regulations.
So specifically cause
regulations. Um, and so I just,
but I think the Senate, the, uh,
parents, it might be that you
want to cite the provisions in
regulation because there will
always probably be, um, but they
might get renumbered, uh, but I
think it's really good and one
of the things I like best about
it is you start with everything
being protected to encourage
that at the and so I think
that's a, that's so I, I just
think this is a really good.
Thank you, Senator Cervantes.
Yeah, so
First of all, address the
question you're right, we would
never do this, um, it's bad form
to cite a regulation for the
reason you cited the regulations
changed.
Pretty frequently, and they,
they change out of sequence with
our work here, so they may
change in the middle of the year
or any point in time.
In our cycle, so it makes it
hard to keep statutes chasing
regulations, so we don't do that
for one. I'll also just speak in
opposition. I've spoken before.
I'm a big believer in
transparency and sunshine laws.
I, I understand the farmers and
others would say, well, uh, uh,
we, we want to have this
confidentially, so would we as
chili producers, so would a lot
of industries would love to
have.
Uh, the government records not
accessible to lawyers to
subpoenas, to lawsuits.
Um, this would this would turn
all of that on its head. We
have.
rules for discovery that allow
uh lawyers and others to the
public at large, the newspaper
concerning their government,
this would put all of that
under.
Under a cloak and again I, I'm a
farmer, you all know that many
generations, many generations of
rancher.
Um, and I, I kind of reject the
notion that farmers and ranchers
have to have some special
transparency to the way they
conduct their operations,
particularly here because this,
this uh has some pretty big
implications to the district I
represent. We move a lot of
cattle, of course, from Mexico
at the Santa Teresa area and
this would make all of that
subject to somebody just saying,
we're not gonna tell you how
many cattle, where the cattle,
where they moved, who owns them.
All of that would be uh
protected. I, I again, I
appreciate the concern here, but
I think the consequences of
Of beginning to try and seek
make our, our government records
and access information and
secrets of bad precedent. And
again, I can see lots of other
people would think that they're
potentially entitled to the same
except just by all farmers, um,
so we, we want the same
protection I'm sure too, and not
let the Department of Health,
but we'd love to not have the
Department of Health inspecting
our chili plant and, and coming
in and, and doing all those kind
of things, not that, not that we
don't, not healthy, not we don't
like the standards and so forth,
but we've got to shut down and
we got to clean, and we
to make our records available,
all that to them, and I think
that's probably a good thing for
people who want to have really
good Southern New Mexico chili
and and know that it's a good
and safe, so I'm sure I, I've
posed this before. I'll continue
to do so.
But I do, I do appreciate the
suggestion. You should probably,
if you're gonna advance this did
not be cross referencing
regulations which are gonna flop
around a lot. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Senator Ruzel.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much. The need for this is very
important to me.
Oh
a
An operation on the side of
Rossel where there was an
outbreak and it was.
Arming lots and lots of horses,
in fact, the horses were dying
and known cause.
And there were people out there
that had no business being out
there whenever they heard about
this because they wanted to take
pictures they wanted.
Uh, made people that were
boarding their horses out there
for.
Bowing purposes, uh.
They were very
Concerned about what was
happening down there. None of
the veterinarians do that this
nationwide and then it went
global on what this virus was
that was going around.
So yes, it did affect the
operation. It did infect affect
the livestock board whenever
they got involved with it, it
affected.
Every veterinarian that was
trying to figure out what the
cause was, and it was causing
lots of lots of damage there.
We've also had outbreaks of
Crops
But whenever this almost.
Reminds me a lot of agritourism.
I mean, I, I'm sorry, not
agritourism, absolutely not, um,
um.
What's the word I'm looking for
here? I'm sorry.
Terrorism, thank you very much.
Whenever there is some sort of
outbreak that has the
possibility of being major.
We've we've experienced several
of those.
The process of anonymity is of
utmost importance.
That needs to be confined.
Lots of this stuff can be.
Bacteria, whatever else you want
to call it through manure,
whatever the case may be, that
might be transported.
By way of people just walking
through a field, walking through
a barnyard.
That's a very distinct
possibility that's out there.
So whenever my farm or ranch may
be at risk.
I am fully in favor of this. I
know that every other farmer and
rancher that has heard about
this bill feels the same way.
And I appreciate what you're
trying to do here to get
whatever concern there is out
there contained with the help of
the livestock board.
With the help of anonymity for
people not being able to go out
there and just.
What's going on? What's
happening here right at that
point, it's none of their
business until there is a
determination made on what the
actual problem is so madam
Chair, I will be supporting this
bill. I think it's a very
effective bill.
But not only the health of the
livestock industry, but for
people's health as well. Thank
you very much.
Thank you. Is there anyone else
for the first time?
Senator Charlie.
And then I have thank you Madam
Chair.
Um
To Senator Cervantes' appointed.
I think there's some information
in here that could be released
like location like movement.
And then my issue last time
around was operational protocols
in that here. All you did was
add language to say including.
Um, I would rather see.
The specificity around
biosecurity details because the
way this reads right now, it's
still all up.
Um
And so I think there's, there's
a little bit more work than
Madam Cha. That was just a
comment.
Thank you.
Um
Anyone else
OK, so, uh, I would like to ask
you to, and I'm gonna come back
to writing out an amendment.
quickly
Because we're um
Could you talk about the comment
that Senator Isel brought up
about Senator Cervantes about
uh.
Cattle coming across the border.
And so my question is really, is
there a way to protect.
are
Oh
New Mexico.
farmer or ranchers versus.
Outside entities.
Is there some
Dividing line.
You know, thank you for that
question, Madam Chair.
Because a lot of things have
been said today.
That it's just simply.
I'm not going to use the word
uh.
Ignorance because there's no
such thing as uh.
Ignorance if you just don't
know, you know, what do we know
and what do we not know?
So let me turn it over to the.
that
And let her describe.
What happens when someone wants
to cross cattle.
On the border.
They
Mountain share members of the
committee so cattle that are
presented at the international
port for crossing into New
Mexico have undergone several
rounds of inspection before they
cross, including testing.
And um USDA is responsible for
allowing those cattle to to
enter our state once those
cattle are on US soil, then it's
our responsibility for the
health and welfare of those
animals and overseeing how those
animals are distributed from New
Mexico to the rest of the United
States and so they do cross from
that international soil um and
uh a livestock market at the
border where they are then uh
redistributed, um, they're
examined.
by a US veterinarian who then
issues those um health
certificates or certificates of
veterinary inspection and
ensures that those animals then
um can legally be transported
and and that they're healthy to
do so, um.
In regards to the movement
question and the location
question, what we're again
trying to.
Previa is the risk of an aro
terrorist event.
Um, there are some diseases such
as foot and mouth disease that
can be easily transmitted just
through saliva. I mean,
something as simple as taking a
a handkerchief and wiping.
Some cow slopper off the the
inside of a of a truck that's
transporting cattle.
Infected with that virus and
then be easily taken into a
dairy, dropped into a pen, and
because of the curious nature of
cattle they've now exposed that
entire pen.
And because that's an airborne
virus, it can then spread very
rapidly and so that that's the
worst case scenario example, but
that's certainly one that we
don't want to.
Have happened here in this
country. It can go undetected,
unfortunately for a period of
time.
Um, especially if people are.
Afraid to report abnormal
symptoms in their cattle.
And so that's.
Maybe I'm sorry, uh, center,
maybe I didn't make myself
clear.
I want to know how this bill.
Pertains to cattle coming over
and the cattle own or horses or
sheep or goats, etc.
I was trying to give to you.
Is that
It was indicated that the reason
this bill was bad.
is because we would not know
what's coming across the border,
and it would not be identified.
Livestock is very well inspected
in the process of crossing those
livestock has got many hoops,
not.
That so much.
For other agriculture crops
coming across the border.
They may or may not be inspected
it's more of a.
A random sample.
And the protections given to
some of the crops coming across
is not the same as livestock.
This is a livestock bill.
What this is
It's not a general crossing of
all products coming from out of
state.
So
What happens?
You, you
Let's take for an example.
Mad cow
I don't know if any of you
remember the mad cow disease.
What happened? The whole theory
behind the mad cow disease was
how do we trace that?
We found one case in the United
States.
One case
It crater
livestock.
Price.
For about 3 months.
You could not buy a futures
contract, you couldn't do
nothing.
You was just out of luck. If you
had market cattle.
You couldn't sell them
It cratered it
What happened when the food and
when the livestock industry
heard of the disease happen in
Mexico.
We immediately shut down the
border.
We've protected you by shutting
down the border.
Trays the is what we're trying
to do here.
How do we trace movement of
animals.
And is it to the public interest
to know exactly where that
traceability is at the point
we're trying to investigate.
That's what this pill is about.
It can be said, well, the public
needs to know all.
The public never knows it all.
So
I
I'm hoping
I don't want to
Get on a soapbox here, madam
chair.
But this is a livestock bill.
And you might say it's a
traceability bill.
But how do we confine enough
information.
To make an investigation.
Without scaring all the rabbits
to go in.
Thank you, Senator, but I don't
think my question was answered.
And Belinda, you wanted to
respond.
Thank you Madam Chair, members
of the committee, I, I think I
maybe I'm I'm on track with you
here.
Cattle crossing out of Mexico in
across Santa Teresa or Columbus
border, they are all required to
have electronic ear tags.
They are scanned and monitored
by the USDA. Those cattle are
inspected by USDA vets on the
Mexico side they cross those,
um, I identifying tags or
scanned again. We have an
inspector that stands at every
port, we track where the
movement and where those cattle
are going to.
That is not going to affect in
any way from this bill because
if those cattle are sick,
they're going to remain in
Mexico.
Our, our hope is that they're
caught by the USDA
veterinarians, and if they have
a condition, then they're caught
there. There has been a couple
of instances in my tenure in
this position that there was
something recognized once they
come into the United States and
we quarantined, we shut that
court down, we don't allow any
cattle to leave until we know
exactly what's happening there.
So
Our, our concern in this bill
for movement is just like moving
prisoners, for example, let's
just use that as an example. The
state police don't really
publicize where they're moving
prisoners because of the risk of
losing that prisoner or having
something happen.
Our concern is agri-terrorism.
Can somebody walk up to a
cattle, uh, pot load of cattle
that we know are sick.
And swipe that saliva as Doctor
Holle mentioned and moved that
disease to a dairy facility to
feed lots of facility. I don't
know, um, if any of you have
ever heard of Montfort feeders,
they are probably the most um
large size lifestyle feeding
facility. They're located in
Colorado, there's miles and
miles of steer on one side of
the interstate and miles and
miles of heifers on the other
side. Imagine what would happen
at that facility of foot and
mouth.
introduced, it's just a swipe of
a handkerchief.
So that is our concern is that
we don't really want to
publicize movement of these
animals that are possibly sick.
That's, that's our concern is
that gonna help?
That explains more, but I was
looking more.
My question really had more to
do with protections for people.
In the state, raising livestock
versus livestock coming from
outside of the country. But I'll
listen to the rest of the
conversation. Uh, is there
anybody else for the first time?
Senator Townsend.
And then we'll go to um Senator
Sidilia Lopez for the 2nd time.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um,
senator.
I
I, I think you ought to have
another chance.
Try to explain cause I think
that's that's an interesting,
um, topic. It's a chairwoman has
brought forward, and I, and I
think your bill covers it, but
How does this bill protect
Americans,
New Mexicans.
Madam Chair, um, Senator
Townsend.
What we think this does is it
encouraging, let's let's just
say it's my operation.
And I have sick cattle.
And I'm not sure exactly what's
happening with my cattle.
So I go to my veterinarian and I
say, OK, I've got some sick cows
here, and then we find out that
it's foot and mouth disease.
Well, I'm scared to scared to
death to go tell the New Mexico
livestock Board.
I've not put mouth in my herd
now.
Because I'm fearful that people
will have my identifiable
information.
And start showing up at my
facility.
And I'm not only scared because
of agritourism that they could
be spreading that disease to
other um producers around the
state or even within the United
States.
Or they're they're coming there
to.
Terrorize myself or my family.
Let me, let me stop you just
right there because Madam Chair,
I think from my perspective,
coming from an egg family. What
this does,
Is it allows
The opportunity for
I mean, what, what is the
alternative for that producer
that has
I heard that he might think
might have some problems. He
doesn't want to bring it up, so,
um, you may be in quarantine.
If he's, if he's not, um, if
he's in a jam financially,
what's he gonna do?
of discussion here.
We had a dairyman in Curry
County.
That found out that his
Wells were infected with EOS,
remember?
That dairyman
Ended up after many, many.
Discussions or times or in order
to protect the food in quit
shipping milk.
He quit
He didn't take his cows to
slaughter.
He did nothing
He, he, he contained the
problem.
where it was.
Now what he could have done.
If he had been an unscrupulous
hawk.
Operator
It could have just sent those
cows to slaughter.
He could have just said the heck
with all of you.
But there's a case.
Where if he
Had this protection, he could
have come to uh to the livestock
board.
And notified them.
And let them make sure the herd
was safe to go to slaughter.
Make sure to isolate the.
Now he was a good operator. He,
he actually
Did what a good operator should
do.
But what happens when the
operator is not that, or what
happens when the bank is gonna
call your note.
As senator Eel those cattle
mortgaged.
Thank you. Maybe you don't
understand that.
Those cattle are collateral to a
mortgage.
The banker says, wait a minute.
You can't, you can't, you've got
to, we're gonna come and get
those cattle.
And we're gonna sell them
because.
If you don't pay your mortgage,
there are property.
And
what does a livestock operator
have on some of these.
Exactly, but I think
Uh, the chairwoman was
was trying to
To distinguishes does this.
By means of of allowing an
operator to have
A
A different path.
Does it protect the public
because it allows the operator
to have
Path
That might give him relief.
That he might not otherwise
have.
I mean
If it's a law on the books that
that then is
I don't see it as is shielding
the public from
From information.
That they don't already have.
I mean, they don't, they don't
know this. There's many things
that happen in Santa Fe every
day but.
I wish the public did know.
I really do wish they knew.
But
process
I in in our hands in the
legislators' hands to try to
address them and make laws.
This particular one allows the
Livestock Board.
To do what they're hard to do
and what they have the capacity
to do. And so for that reason,
I, uh
I can see both sides of it. I I
understand, but I think it,
thank you.
Thank you. Anyone else for the
first time.
Lopez.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. Um.
I was
So I was just gonna make a
little fix, uh, insert board
regulations instead of
subsection S sub section blah
blah blah, uh, to make the the
the the correction that
judiciary is likely to make.
But then I realized and this,
it's when I was listening to
Senator Charlie about um the
breadth of this, and so I
thought um and and B is a little
bit confusing on page 3, line 5,
if the board or any of its
authorized representatives
restrict access. Well, you just
told them they shall restrict
access. I think that this should
be, if they don't restrict
access, you will, it should be
redacted.
But the way you've written the
bill, I don't think that's
necessary anymore because um.
You've given the authority to
the livestock for board about
what to restrict.
So I think to fix that on page
2, if you could put specific
details of life livestock
operations related to the
investigation of disease or
animal health events may
include, and then that gives the
board discretion about what it's
going to protect or what it's
not in a gift in a in a.
In a certain case, and the board
would have.
Uh, you know, it would, it would
understand.
What is necessary to get people
to come forward and what in a
given case is not necessary to
get people to come forward. So
these I hope are friendly
amendments to make the bill
stronger and clearer because it
is confusing, uh, on page 3, if
you read, if you read B line 5,
if the board restrict.
You shall redact. Well, you just
restricted, so why did you have
to redact? So, so that's
confusing. Um, I hope you think
these are, are friendly. They're
offered in the spirit of trying
to uh make this bill stronger.
I think it's very important. I
know that when you don't.
Restrict sensitive data.
People will not come forward. My
my father ran a farm, my brother
is continuing that tradition
and, um, you know, it would be.
You know
If the board acting on their on
the best interests of of
ranchers and and and farmers,
um, weren't protecting them.
So I, I, I'm in favor of this
bill and I'm offering this just
to make it stronger, not to
Senator, is this a friendly
amendment?
It's a friendly amendment.
Thank you. Uh, would you move it
for adoption.
OK, madam Chair, I moved the uh
this amendment.
One, for adoption, is there a
second?
There is a motion in a second on
this amendment. Could we have
discussion on the amendment?
Is there any opposition to this
amendment?
With the Secretary please uh.
Not seeing any opposition, OK,
we're back on the amended bill.
Madam Chair,
may I? Yes. Do you have anything
else
in our city a local issue, uh,
no, I, I support this bill, and
we are now back on the amended,
yes, 70 something.
Neither
Sorry, Senator, please go ahead.
Madam Chair, I moved the Senate
Conservation Committee
substitute for Senate Bill 56.
Thank you. We have a motion, uh,
from senator and the second from
Senator Townsend.
Or do pass on a committee
substitute as amended.
If a pasty goes on, please call
the roll.
Yes.
Certainly, certainly we have
time.
I'm sorry, deleting lines 5
through 11.
Um, but you've already deleted.
Lines 1 through 4 so you really
you you would just do, you're
deleting 1 through 4 and then 5
to 11 you're really deleting 1
through 11 at the substitute.
Oh, maybe I'm not.
That could help me right.
Well then they backtrack and
think you maybe I maybe I'm in
error. Thank you. So, um, I'll
Back off and let's say we'll
we'll see how it works out
judicial, but you're right,
that's what my mistake was.
Um
OK
So we have a motion or a due
pass as amended.
And any further discussion?
If it passes.
OK, the secretary
Senator Cervantes?
I want to know, Senator Charlie,
yes, and to explain, Senator
Charlie,
yes, Senator. Yes, yes, Senator
Hamlet.
Senator Hamblin, yes, Senator
Pope.
No.
Pope, no, Senator Scott.
Scott, yes, Senator Townsend.
Senator Townsend, yes, Senator
Di Lopez, yes.
And Lopez, yes, Santhonics.
Sanhonics, yes.
I a vote of 7 to 2, you have a
due pass.
Oh, I am, I apologize, uh,
Senator Charlie first to explain
her vote. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Very quickly, um, I do
appreciate the opportunity to
learn.
And to understand this a little
bit more deeply and what I came
to realize in your explanation,
director, and senator, is that
you're asking for the same
protections that many of us
advocate for abortion providers.
And in that, in that vein and in
that understanding, I come to
support. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you very much. Was there
anybody else I failed to
recognize to explain their vote.
OK, Senator, you have a 7 to 2
do pass.
Now we're gonna take your 2nd
bill right away.
On the Curry County uh
appropriation.
So we are on Senate Bill 339.
Madam Chair.
Senate bill 339.
Uh
Quickly on this bill, this is an
appropriation bill.
And let me just tell you what's
happening here. We've had, I, I
mentioned the POS a few minutes
ago.
And the FIFOS is this particular
area.
Right here
by private wells.
And
We have opportunity to serve
that.
That those people
Through a
Another source of water.
Now I shows that this money goes
to the environment department.
Ah
What we're trying and there's a
particular reason for that.
There's a method to my madness,
madam chair. The Environment
Department has a lawsuit going
right now.
Against
The actual contaminator of this,
which is the.
Air Force Base just put it
bluntly.
And
They have a suit against them
they believe that in that suit
they can recover the cost of
this.
This pipeline
So the reason that I'm doing it
this way is for that reason.
So that it won't cost to state
anything when the deal's done.
And the reason for the pipeline
is uh the well-being of people.
The mental stress that these are
private properties that I'm
trying to serve.
The property value goes to 0
without water.
The concern of the property
values, the tax base for the
county.
It will help prevent the
movement of FIFAs towards Clovis
by not depleting that water, not
sucking.
I won't go any further, madam
chair thank you very much.
Is there anybody here in the
audience to support this bill.
One person, is there anybody in
the audience to to oppose this
bill.
Is there anybody
At the Senate, the chair of
finance was gonna oppose it.
Um
Anybody online. OK, Secretary,
you wanna come up and make your
comment?
Yeah,
Madam chair, just standing in
support, the Environment
department is focusing heavily
on trying to remediate, clean up
and hold accountable, uh, the
Department of Defense in Curry
County, anything we can do to
protect the residents there who
are on private water moving them
to public water. We see as an
investment that's good for New
Mexico. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Questions,
comments from committee members.
There is a motion for due pass,
is there a second?
There is a motion.
by Senator Hamlin and a second
by Senator Townsend.
Is there anybody opposed?
That's present. Is there anybody
opposed to this film?
showing those present.
Voting in yes and the other's
excused.
Thank you very much, Senator
Woods.
Yes.
We have ruled that.
That's rolled till next week
there's a, a similar bill in the
House that's having its hearings
this weekend if that occurs,
then it'll come over here and
that's uh I texted the
Senator.
The 3:42 for anybody who did not
hear at the beginning, Senate
Bill 342, which is the brackish
Water Projects funding is being
rolled over until next week if
we need it.
So,
Senator Munoz's fees.
Bill 264
implements increase for the game
fish department first time since
2006.
Increases residents licenses by
an average of $14.85 and holds 9
unchanged.
Increases non-reticent residence
by an average of 8420.
I'll, I'll talk louder. The fees
may be increased in the next 10
years based upon the CPI amount
for inflation, and it provides a
25% discount for Snap. Inside
this fees bill, the workers'
compensation fee, the bill.
for workers' compensation
Administration or fees for the
first time since 1990.
Agency is self funded through
quarterly assessment fees and
the current revenue is slightly
above 13 million while the
operating expenses have reached
over 14 million and the gap
continues to grow each year.
Funds from the agency's
reversed.
Reserves have been depleted.
Through an interagency transfer
and will drop to nearly 300,000
by the end of the modest
increase over a 10-year period
will provide for current and
future operational needs and
help sustain the reserve
balances.
Under the other fees under the
environment department, the bill
allows the department to raise 3
through public rulemaking and
programs listed below, many of
which not have been implement a
new food has not been
implemented in 20 years.
This was girl, uh, eliminates
the 10,000 cap for petroleum
storage tank bureaus. The
environmental Health Bureau.
Uh, food program amends the food
service sanitation and the
mental health board and spa
program amends the water
recreation facility fees in
office.
Radiation control.
And medical imaging regulation
therapy program amends a medical
imaging and radiation therapy,
health, Safe Act.
Clarifies the EI board would be
able to set reasonable fees and
costs.
The drinking water bureau
utility operation certificate
program amends the drinking
water and wastewater operation
fee and allows fees to be set by
the water quality Control
Commission through rulemaking.
Cannabis and hemp bureaus the
hemp manufacturing Act allows
the fees to carry out the
administration for the for many
of hemp and edible.
Permitting fees, which would be
determined by the amendment.
To amends the food service
sanitation alloweds EIB board to
set reasonable fees and costs.
I'm sure there's a lot of,
there's a lot of views inside
this bill.
Um, but if you look at the dates
of some of them, 35 years since
we've increased fees, uh, me and
the Environment secretary always
have this debate over bees and
how the transfers are going and
where they're needed, um, and we
fund that agency. We've had 100%
the only agency that's reached
that level.
But sometimes we have to raise
fees in order to offset
operating costs and not draw a
general fund ever share with
that.
John is my attorney from Senate
Finance. He's going to help me
through this.
And so we'll stand for
questions.
Would you like to say a few
words? No.
OK.
So we go to the audience.
Oh, I'm sorry, we have an
amendment.
Do you still want to put this
amendment on? Uh yes, ma'am. OK,
so the amendment is 0.231040.1.
And the amendment, uh, on page 1
lines 20 and 21 strike extending
the sunset date of the spay and
neuter program fee.
And number 2 on pages 18 through
20 strike section 10.
Which is related to that program
and renumber of the succeeding
sections.
Is there a motion uh for
discussion purposes on the
amendment.
There is a motion of.
On the amendment for discussion.
Is there a second?
OK, Senator Townsend made the
2nd.
So this is for discussion, so
let's uh
have a brief comment about that.
The real brief comment is that
that fee sunsets in the next
year in 2026, I believe.
And so, um, in talking to
people, we wanted to not sunset
that earlier. We understand
there's a lawsuit over the fees
and so uh we're gonna pull. OK.
Thank you. Uh, we also have,
have a handout set up.
Um, even though we have this
amendment.
OK. Other discussion on the
amendment.
Yes, Senator
Senator Cervantes, did you want
to respond please for the
record?
That's one of the parts of the
Constitution we just pretend
doesn't exist.
Sometimes, and sometimes we
invoke it and we don't, we don't
like a law we don't want to pass
it, we'll say you can't do it
because it's relating to
litigation and when we when we
like the law we pass it.
It's, we, we do it arbitrarily
and capriciously.
discussion on the amendment.
OK, could I have the.
I move the amendment.
Mm
And the second, there is a
motion.
And the 2nd on the amendment
with the Secretary please call
the vote on the amendment.
Senator Cervantes, Senator
Cervantes, yes, Senator Charlie.
Excuse
Senorelenorel, yes, Senator
Hamblin, Senator Hamblin, yeah,
Senator Pope.
Senator Pope, yes, Senator
Scott.
Nurse Scott, yes, Senator
Townsend.
Senator Townsend, no, Senator
Dia Lopez.
Yes, Senator Cilla Lopez, yes,
Senator Stephonics.
Yes.ophonics, yes. By a vote of
71, the amendment has been
adopted. So now we go back to
the audience. How many people
are here to support.
This bill
345. How many people are here to
oppose this bill.
Nobody online. OK, could we have
some of the supporters stand to
say why they support this bill,
please.
Madam Chair, Mike Sloan,
directors, Department of Game
and Fish and um as the senator
pointed out, the sponsor pointed
out, we haven't had a fee
increase since 2006, our
operational fund is in need of
replenishment, and we very much
appreciate the
The sponsor bringing forward the
bill and fully support it. Thank
you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
senators. My name is Heather
Jordan. I'm the director of the
Workers' Compensation
Administration.
I think Senator Munoz for
sponsoring this bill, and um I'd
like to point out that
Again, our agency is
self-funded. We have not asked
for general fund money to
support our agency, and we have
not increased our base
assessment fee since 1990, um,
and our agency is.
At that critical point where we
are not solvent, and we do not
want to have to ask for general
fund money.
So I respectfully request that
you Madam Chairwoman, committee
members. My name is Tom
Patterson. I serve as
president-elect of the New
Mexico Cattle Growers
Association during our joint
Stockman's meeting in December,
our membership approved a
resolution supporting an
increase in game and fish
license fees.
There hasn't been a license fee
increase since 2006, as the
director said.
License fees account for about
2/3.
Of the game in fish budget.
Without a fee increase they've
told us that they project that
they will not have the necessary
funding to conduct even their
current level of service.
We have continuing concerns with
the department, primarily over
Mexican wolves and elk
management, with that said,
It's time to get this license
fee increase done.
Cattle growers supports section
one of SB 264. We have no
position at this time on the
balance of the bill. Thank you.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair,
members of the committee
appreciate being here. I think,
uh, Chairman for bringing this
bill forward on behalf of the
administration and for our
agencies for the Environment
department, the uh legislature
has been very kind and increased
our general fund. We're trying
to increase the fees that we can
successfully run our programs,
um, number of our programs that
you that haven't been addressed,
have not been addressed in over
20 years, we're still uh
Behind in terms of collecting
the fees in order to pay those
individuals to properly service
the New Mexico businesses that
rely on us. I also note, Madam
Chair, um, that in our fiscal
impact analysis, uh, I know
you'll all be excited that I
said that if this bill were to
pass that we wouldn't be seeking
a FY 27 increase just like we uh
did not seek an FY 26 general
fund increase. Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is TJ
Trujillo. I'm a registered
lobbyist for the pet Food
Institute. Uh, my comments are
going to be limited to section,
the former section 10 of the
bill, and I want to thank the
spot uh deleting that section of
the bill.
As I've talked about over the
years, I'm one of the, I'm the
attorney, one of the matter.
An overall comment I just want
to make is that, um,
There's been a continuous
pattern of the legislature.
Uh, basically.
Uh
Claiming a fee, but it's really
a tax, and there's a legal
distinction between the two, and
that continues somewhat in this,
the rest of this bill and other
statutes, and so this is a
continual problem of when it's
when they label a fee when the
legislature labels it as a fee,
there's certain rights and and
remedies that are different than
what a tax is and the tax
operates very differently. But
anyway, again, I, I think the
sponsor and the member.
Thank you very much and there
was nobody online for this. Is
there anybody in the audience to
oppose? OK, we are now going to
questions, comments from
committee members. Yes, Senator
Cervantes.
So I had a chance to talk to the
sponsor a little bit. I'm gonna
give him a hard time. Um, we're
spending a lot of time this last
year and in this session talking
about the need we need to
professionalize and modernize
the legislature and
I'm looking over my Senate
colleague who's frequently and I
par back and forth because
she'll say that we're a weak
legislature. She's right, we're
a weak legislature.
Uh, we're weakening ourselves
once again here.
Uh, if you look at this bill,
We have all kinds of fees that
are fixed in here, we specify
the fee and the amount. I'm not
gonna look so much at the game
fish, and I appreciate all these
agencies coming forward and
saying we haven't had a fee
increase in, in case it's close
to 20 years.
Um, I don't know whether that's
good or bad.
Maybe you've been underfunding
yourself and under utilizing
yourself. Maybe you should have
asked for a fee, but suggest to
me that you didn't need it, uh,
for 20 years and you've been
able to operate within a certain
budget without that need. I
don't, I don't get the sense
from anybody that.
You senator chairing the finance
committee's turned him down.
Uh, so that, that's a little
puzzling to me, but, but for
example, where I say we're,
we're kind of just
Taking ourselves out of the ball
game, we ought to just stay
home, um, page 4 on the game and
fish, you're increasing uh
penalties and then you're gonna
add a CPI multiplier, right? So
every year the fee is gonna go
up based on the CPI.
That means that your committee
won't be in this legislature
won't be determining those fees.
We're just it's gonna happen
automatically and we get to stay
home.
Um, if you go to section 2.
Of the bill, same thing, you're
um
You're taking, if you look on
section 2 pages 5 and 6, right
now,
There are fees for grading food
service establishments and we
specify the fee amount.
not less than $100 not more than
$200 annually. We got all those
things in here.
And we're gonna change that.
We're gonna change that on page
6 to whatever the agency
determines is necessary.
That's the language whenever
it's necessary to carry out
their, their functions. So we're
out of the picture now, no
hearings, no committee.
No vote.
They'll just decide whatever
they think is necessary for
them.
Um, and if you go to section 3.
Same kind of deal this is really
kind of consistent throughout
the whole bill.
We're going from laws where
we've specified what that fee is
over the years and historically,
and then we're just changing it
to language where we're gonna
say whatever the agency decides.
So, if you look at Section 4 on
page 8,
I guess a question for you
there. First of all, I tried to
figure out.
Senator, just a question for you
in that section 4 on page 8,
this is.
Raising fees for somebody.
But I can't figure out
Oh
What, what, what program are
agencies in that in Section 4
and pages 8 and 8 and 9.
OK.
And so right now we've got.
Uh, in the existing law we have
an application fee for $10 and
examinations biannual license
fee not to exceed $100.
You have a temporary license
fee, not to exceed $50. I can go
on these, these are all the
schedule of fees we have in our
existing law. We're gonna change
that to
Whatever fees are, are to
recover the reasonable cost.
To administer and operate the
program.
We're gonna leave it up to them
to decide uh what fees they need
to collect.
As they wish to, to make their
own budget happen.
Same thing happens in section 5.
I'm not sure what um
But this area of the law is
either, but I'm, I'm not gonna
try and
Go through all of the areas of
law, just it's it's just a
general observation, right? But
it's really the whole bill.
Uh, if you look at section 5.
We've got whatever this area
lies, we've got a
Examination fee of $100 or
renewal certificate fee for $40.
This is all on page 10.
issuance of certificate fee of
$100. We're gonna change all
that to whatever the agency
determines a reasonable costs
are.
That's on the new language on
page 10.
Um, I, I can keep going, but I,
I think I probably made the
point.
It's true with storage tank fees
here, fuel tanks fees.
Um, really all of these things,
and I, I, I do appreciate your
role as the Senate Finance
chair, but um,
I want, I want you to have the
authority, Senator, and you're
committed to have the authority
over um our state budget and not
leaving it to the agencies to
decide what they're gonna
charge.
All of these industries and all
these professions and all these
areas of, of
of our, of our state and I'm I'm
looking at this bill captures
hemp manufacturers, it's got the
pet food, spay and neuter
component, although you know
we've we've modified that some.
Solid waste fees, petroleum
storage tank fees.
public swimming pool and spa
fees, public water.
Medical radiation, you talked
about workers' comp, food
services. We, we can go all down
the list, but we're essentially
taking ourselves off the field.
We're saying we're not gonna
determine those anymore. We're
gonna take all these fees and
schedules that we've decided are
what you should have and what
you need to operate, and we're
gonna leave it up to you, the
agency to decide. I think that's
uh I think that's a delegation.
Again, I'm increasingly thinking
I'm gonna get to spend more and
more time at home and we, we
should be here less and less.
And, and be less and less
important to the process.
By some perspectives, not when I
share, I'm not advocating for
that. But I think that's what.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't
think it's a good idea.
Thank you, Senator, Senator
Cedillo, thank you, Madam Chair,
and to, to, I'm sure it's to no
surprise of uh the Senate
Judiciary chair that I disagree.
Um, we are a weak legislator,
legislature, we meet so
minimally, um, once a year.
And agencies have needs, um,
beyond that.
And the agencies do a lot of the
work that if we would be able to
do.
But
They're not. And so the agencies
um and agencies have really
specific, um, all of these
agencies have really specific
missions they've been authorized
by us to do this work, um.
And
I know distinctions, but the
bottom line is, um,
Agencies should be able to
adjust, and these are small
adjustments cause there's there
are guardrails on this, um,
should be able to adjust in
order to meet their missions and
to meet the the authority that
we have given them in through
legislation. So I support this,
um.
I also
Um, I think that the CPI is
important.
Because of all of the political
Hassles about um.
Raising taxes or or whatever,
um.
Just as an example, and you all
know, um, and that just seems
cheaper and cheaper.
And the same thing is happening,
the, the ability of the agency
to do, to function is just
eroded and eroded and eroded if
they're not able to make
adjustments. So I think I think
that
Well, I thank you, Senator
Scott, and Senator Townsend.
Uh, thank you, madam Fair
senator.
One of the big pieces of this
appears to be the
Oh
Tafish hunting and fishing
license fees.
Uh, can you tell me what the
total budget of Cayman fishes.
Today
Madam Chair and Senator, I don't
know off the top of my head,
but.
grab a chair.
Madam Chair, Senator, including
legacy funding about
So increases, Madam Chair,
Senator of
$10 million would be a
Mm
percentage of that total chair,
Adam chair, excuse me, Senator,
um, these are fees that go into
the game protection fund, the
authority to set our budget at
appropriate, so these are just
fees that are collected.
Years ago, I had to subsidize
your budget to the tune of 5 or
7 million just to make them
operational.
For the next 2 years and
We're right on the border.
And then
And then indexing this stuff to
the CPI.
I chair and senator.
Well
The issuance of a fishing
license may or may not have.
Any relationship to the price of
gasoline.
So
This
Somewhat puts these fees.
On autopilot, I think.
the
Uh, to the comments that Senator
Cervantes made.
And I, I guess I would question
whether
That's a wise thing to do when
CPI may or may not.
Reflect
The expenses that came and
fishes actually, you know, uh, I
don't know how many years ago I
tried just for the vendors.
To do a $2 increase so the
vendors could write licenses
back when the olden days when
you could get a written one.
And I couldn't get a $2 increase
for vendors, and they're the
ones selling the licenses.
Every time I'll use the gas tax
as the perfect example, right?
We have not raised the gas tax,
and I've been here 16 years and
I think it talked about or been
tried every single year, right?
And the legislature does not
have the wherewithal to like,
you got to go home to our voters
and and and they think, you
know, a penny for a better road
when their front end hits a
pothole is costing more than the
$800 in repairs.
And, and so at some point we
have to set these agencies up
and say, you know.
You can't come to us every
single time, right? Make
adjustments, find a base point.
And then make those adjustment
hunting and fishing is not a
cheap sport. You never want to
add the total cost.
What a
Trout caution in the quality
waters by the time you drive
across the state and buy
everything for it, um.
So it's not cheap anyway, but
everybody should enjoy the
outdoors and outdoor rec, but
there is a cost to it.
There's a cost to
For the game wardens to go, uh,
there's a cost for vehicles.
Um, there's a lot of costs that
have to be absorbed. We aren't
allowed to get into the game
protection fund.
Right. And and so we budget for
only things like dams, needs.
And so they're just relying on.
What their sales are and
licenses and you heard on the
floor the other day, which
Might be a good amendment in
here is the, the big horn sheep
tag for sold for $1.3 million.
Out of state residents in
Bighorn sheep are probably the
most prized.
Animals, I don't know why I'm
not a sheep hunter, but I have a
lot of friends that do it.
And so there's certain species
that are really prized.
But I, I, I like legislature is
not gonna do this every single
year. The department falls and,
and we know that.
mean it, the cost to keep
workers.
The, the cost of, of trucks. I
mean, nowadays, well, you and I
both know.
Are your windows fixed yet? Mine
aren't.
It might have been 3 weeks and,
and so, uh, maybe I'll see that
truck again in in a month maybe
I won't, right? And and so those
costs when vehicles go down and
and there's a fine bill for the
state police coming too. We got
to make some adjustments.
And we got to figure out how to
do this. Some of these other
ones that senators want to
mention, you know.
We'll have to tune them up a
little bit if we come out here
and send it finance and make
sure that
Boards don't go overboard when
they do this and set some more
quality regulations to control
costs because we know that we
know what happens when sometimes
the EIB gets to determine stuff
and sometimes they are uh
Or are methodical in what they
do and sometimes they aren't,
but
To send a guy to go check a
swimming pool.
Uh, you know, he's making at
least 20 bucks an hour by the
time, right? Maybe 20 with, with
all the benefits maybe and he
tries to the swimming pool and.
The nursevanus' district in
Texas swimming pool.
We're lost
We're a loss for that fee and
the cost of that employee, and
so there's some adjustments that
need to happen, but we need to
control them. I agree with that
and and CPI may be one of the
best controls.
Uh, setting the cap on CPI, I
think last year, I don't
remember what the other day.
And, and so that taking the
average over the.
The base point year in setting
that, I mean it keeps your leas
everybody understands this, to
make this very easy because
is not gonna do this every year
for the game and fish.
Nonetheless, Madam Chair and
Senator, I find myself troubled.
Because
The cost to issue a fishing
license.
Would not necessarily be
Reflected in the sepia.
Because
Yeah, but the cost of stalking
the fish is.
OK, that's the cost of raising
the visions.
And then I believe I heard some
additional concerns about
letting some of these
Agencies
set their own fates.
And
Do you have any concern that
that might be problem I do have
a concern if this comes out, I
mean, we're gonna look really
hard on how to, how to calculate
those and, and see what they
currently have and where the
shortfalls are and what the
actual costs are gonna, you
know.
To manage a dump.
is a very big cost.
And and so I think in the FIR I
read there there's a breakdown
of how Arizona, Utah, and some
of them do it. Some of those are
tipping fees, some of those are
flat fees, um, but we're gonna
have to figure this out because
I mean, we only have one dump in
McKinley County, and it serves
the Navajo Reservation.
And San Juan County.
And ibola County, so.
We're going to have to give them
the time to manage that.
Thank you, sir, for your
answers. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Townson.
Thank you. Thank you, Senator.
Um.
Of these agencies that might be
benefit from
this new because they weren't
able to, I mean, they didn't
spend the money we gave him last
year.
I, I don't know any, I mean, the
environment department hasn't
reverted money. He's here. I
know the game and fish hasn't.
You know workers' comp.
Where's Jeff if they have or
not, but they make they're
they're the only ones I made
CPI adjustment that as well as
upward. It could, there's a
downturn in the economy and
inflation goes down, CPI could
actually go down.
Addition allow it to be adjusted
downward as well. Um, it's gonna
follow the CPI, Madam Chair, I'm
sorry, Madam Chair and Senator.
It it will follow the CPI.
You know what?
One of my concerns is
Having served um house of pros,
not Senate Finance, but on House
pros.
Trying to control
The budget is a
I
and what controls.
we have in the legislature.
Madam Chair and senator, when
they
They're determined in statute
where the fees can be used.
We can't control exactly where
fees are, I mean.
Uh,
the secretary and I the
environment department have been
in this debate, you know, we've
always had this agreement with
with state government that they
will not do bars during the
legislature to let us focus on
the session.
Well bar came through a little
bit earlier, uh.
The bar was completely legal, we
know that, but
Why don't you come ask for it in
your budget before you make a
transfer.
to an agency for operational
side. I mean that.
And so
We'll make sure that these fees
are non-transferable, that they
stay in the fund because we
rated funds before.
The well clean up fun, right?
Um, prior.
Before I ran a bill for 3 or 4
years so that you couldn't pay
the FTEs out, had to come back
and backfill some of that in the
budget.
That's the way we have to do it
in.
Um, you know,
have to watch carefully that,
that and my chair is one of my
big concerns. I
I've seen
Um
I've seen some things happen.
In departments that caused me
great concern. I mean,
weeks on a ton of time up here
and almost every committee.
Trying to protect the
environment and then at times
we've had people that
Uh uh self-reported.
Tried to do the right thing and
still got.
$45 million fine, and I don't
know what the hell that money is
being used, and I don't know,
you know, I just, I don't think
we ought to get a
apartments that are
Quit relying on you for their
funding and start relying on
their own ability to go collect
these.
That is just troubling as heck
to me.
Because I think what you're
gonna wind up is
You know, catch and release
deal, it's just gonna, gonna.
I'll be very troubling.
Madam Chair, and Senator, a most
fine so completely different,
right? That company had
purchased another company.
Who underreported or misreported
and that company went to
straighten it out.
then got fined.
That's the short story of that
one, that that was kind of an
unfair.
Deal, but I mean, um, but all
fines go into special school
fund.
And so those fines are
collected.
And then distributed to from the
general.
And I, I, I understand that.
Um, Madam Chair, and I
appreciate your answer. I think
you know my concern. I
I
Oh, I feel much better.
When I know somebody.
That is part of the
legislature's controlling the
strings.
An absolute
Needed budgets are met.
And, and that we don't have
apartments and then
That's my concern with the bill.
I, I, uh,
I think the
It's not so much what's in this
bill that bothers me. It's what
it opens the door to that causes
me great concern. So, thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, seeing no more uh
discussions, Senator Cervantes.
I'm sure, I'm sorry, I do have a
bit more discussion,
um, and I'm sure I think it's
important, you know, the
committee made the right point.
We haven't raised the alcohol
tax. And, and we're saying that
with some dismay.
Um, but we don't then delegate
to the Department of Health to
raise the alcohol tax
themselves. We don't say, hey,
and that's what you're doing.
You just say, hey, we'll take
out the alcohol tax and you guys
Department of Health, you decide
what the tax is.
And, and because
We have the courage, at least
there, to at least debate it and
discuss it and take a vote on
it.
Uh, and it'd be really nice to
say your agency determined it
when it comes on the gas tax, we
haven't raised the gas tax
because maybe we don't want to
incur the wrath of our
constituents or defended or
debate it. So, but we don't
delegate it to the Department of
Transportation, so you guys
raised the gas tax, um, and
determine how much you need to
do the roads. We don't, we don't
do it that way. And I, I, I
respect Senator, you're, you're
telling us if it gets through
the committee, you're gonna fix
this in finance, but there's no
fix.
I mean, this is a, this is a
philosophical principle. You
can't, there's no middle ground
here.
Uh, we're either gonna determine
these fees ourselves and take
the responsibility and
accountability for that. Well,
we're not, we're going to
delegate it to somebody else to
determine how much they need,
and they'll decide how much they
need and how much they want, and
they'll change the fees as they
wish and um this is where I I
had a quick whisper with my
colleague Senator Lopez. We, we
have this long standing debate
and discussion, but I agree with
her and, and I want to say it. I
agree with her, we're a weak
legislature.
But we're a weak legislature
because we choose to be a weak
legislature and it's easy
because then we're not
accountable.
Right, so when we're not
accountable for poverty and
education and crime, because
we're weak, and we say we're
weak, and so here we're just
weakening ourselves yet again,
and that means we're not
accountable offering this, so I
didn't raise the game fees. Uh,
the agency did.
I didn't raise the inspection
fees, the Department of Health
did. I didn't raise any of these
things I didn't do it.
Uh, they did it because they
needed more money. We're taking
ourselves off the playing field.
That's just not.
way to do this. We should be
accountable for our actions so
thank you for a second chance.
Thank you, ma'am. Sure, let me
just respond real quickly. He's
got to understand the difference
between fees and taxes.
This is something that someone
wants to use, right, and the
taxes, everybody's going to pay
it when you consume it.
And so, when you have a gas tax.
That's a tax at the pump, you
try to choose to not drive a
vehicle, you don't pay the tax.
Uh, if you choose not to have a
swimming pool inspection.
And choose not to go in that
business or have a public park,
and it's a fee.
rather than attacks. And so
there's a complete distinction
between fees and taxes.
Thank you, Senator, uh, other
questions, comments?
I think we're ready for a
motion.
Senator Cervantes, I moved the
table.
Tabling motion is non-debatable.
And
Senor Svantes, yes,
Senator Charley.
So I tried to excuse and her
zeal.
And, yes, Senator Hamlet.
And
And Hamlin, yes. Senator Pope.
No. Senator Pope, no, Senator
Scott, Senator Scott, yes,
Senator Townsend.
Senator Townsend, yes, Senator
Sail Lopez.
No the table.
Since the De Lopez, no San
Stepanics, yes.
And so phonics, yes.
I don't think anybody has to
explain their vote, so, uh,
senator, your bill has been
tabled. um, thank you very much
for your time.
OK, uh, as I mentioned, Senate
Bill 342 has been rolled.
And we are now at set of Bill
358.
Go ahead.
Senator, please go ahead. Thank
you, Madam Chair and committee.
I appreciate the opportunity to
come and speak with you today.
Um, folks might be curious as to
why I'm supporting the equine
shelter rescue and welfare Trust
Fund because I.
Certainly I'm not somebody who
is around horses, uh, quite a
bit, and I'm pretty sure I am
nowhere near as graceful on a
horse as Senator Ael might be.
You can hear me from a mile away
if I'm sitting on a horse, just
cause I just don't know how to
ride them.
But my closest association with
horses was through an ex-partner
who was an avid writer and
caretaker of horses.
And it was meeting a beautiful
horse named Shiloh that had a
white star between her eyes, uh,
that showed her, showed me what
a majestic creature she was and
Shiloh was ignored by her owner.
So every time I went to the
stables with my partner, I
mucked her stall. I brushed her
coat. I fed her with hay and
carrots, and she was gorgeous
and sweet, and it saddened me
that she was ignored and
neglected by her owner.
So the reason why I'm here today
is to share with you that equine
shelters in the state are at
capacity and underfunded.
The problem here is that New
Mexico's equine shelters do not
have adequate and reliable
funding to cover the costs of
the services they provide to the
state and build capacity to meet
the need at the level of current
demand.
Without a strong statewide
equine shelter network, the
responsibility to care, humanely
place or euthanize these animals
falls to the state.
There are no government run or
funded equine shelters, so the
New Mexico livestock Board is
responsible for impounding
abandoned equines.
that have been treated cruelly
or abused, and this has led to
the livestock board to work with
nonprofit shelters to absorb
those animals that would
otherwise be placed for auction
or euthanized.
And since the nonprofits are not
directly supported by state or
municipal tax dollars. Like many
nonprofits, they rely on
donations or private grants or
occasional funding from the
state.
And this is through the equine
shelter rescue fund, which
covers some of the costs that
shelters incur but has never had
reliable sustainable funding
system. Many of us see this on
our pay stub that we can check a
box that would put money into
this. And so what this bill does
is establish an equine welfare
trust fund to earn funding for
the equine shelter rescue fund,
and this is what we are seeing
we are doing throughout is to
establish these funds where the
interest will go into um
something for long term
sustainability, and this would
do this.
by appropriating $20 million
into an investment fund that
would grow over time. And should
this bill pass out of this
committee, our next stop would
be the Senate Finance Committee.
Ultimately, what this would do
is create sustainable funding in
order to support the equine
shelter of rescue fund and the
numerous nonprofits that we have
throughout the state that are
working to rehabilitate and take
care of these animals. I'm going
to introduce my experts to make
a statement, a brief statement,
and then we certainly look
forward to the discussion, Madam
Chair, first I have Stacy Sutton
Kirby, who is chief government
affairs officer for animal
protection of New Mexico, and
then she will be followed by
Nina Edelman, who is the
director of Animal Protection
voters equine.
wildlife. So if you'd like to go
for Stacy for a short statement.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
Um
Animal protection voters and
Kirby.
Chief Government Affairs officer
at Animal Protection voters. Uh,
we support Senate Bill 358
because as the senator so
eloquently explained New Mexico
desperately needs sustainable
funding for the equine
sheltering system that we rely
on to absorb abused, abandoned,
and when the New Mexico
Livestock Board impounds and
abandoned equines or their go to
is a network of 12 registered
nonprofit shelters in 2013, the
legislature created the ESRF to
pay the
shelters for.
Disbursements from the ESRF to
the shelters are not donations.
The ESRF funds are dispersed and
exchanged for labor intensive
and highly skilled services that
the shelters provide in
rehabilitating, training, and
adopting out equines that would
otherwise remained the burden of
the state.
But the ESRF has never had
reliable funding since it was
established, it's received only
the minimal tax refund donations
and sporadic modest.
One time legislative
appropriations in 2024, the
shelter spent $2.5 million to
care for surrendered, abandoned,
and abused equines with a
substantial portion of those
animals coming from the NMLB and
law enforcement, but they
received 0 funding through ESRF
in 2024.
But we do have the solution,
Senate Bill 358 will grow money
for the ESRF.
Excuse me, in face of the
current budget surplus, we
simply cannot miss out on this
opportunity.
responsibly invest and grow
money for our state's needs. We
urge you to support Senate Bill
358.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Nina Edelman, and I'm with
Animal Protection New Mexico.
And we work closely with equine
shelters to understand their
needs, provide a direct
financial assistance and
advocate for state policies that
support their work.
I've also served on the
livestock board equine shelter
rescue fund advisory Committee
that provides recommendations
for the disbursements of the
ESRF funding.
All of our 12 licensed equine
shelters are nonprofits run by
minimal staff and are heavily
reliant on volunteers. They
exist largely at the whims of
private donors and grants with
no certainty of funding year to
year.
Yet the services that they
provide our state are
immeasurable.
About half of shelter intakes
each year come from the
livestock board from situations
of abuse, neglect, abandonment,
or astray.
The shelters provide feed,
veterinary inferior care,
training and rehabilitation and
rehoming or sanctuary for these
equines.
The state should invest in
shelters because there are
currently no state-run shelters
and without places for these uh
homeless equines to go, they can
end up abandoned on public lands
or risk entering the slaughter
pipeline, which is on Mexicans.
This bill would provide a
reliable source of government
funding for shelters and
exchange for the necessities
and
into the future. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. At this
point, I'm open for public
testimony and discussion.
Thank you very much.
So I have a.
a prepared list.
And how many people are here in
the audience to support this
bill. How many are here to
oppose this bill. We got some
opposition, we got 3.
OK, so let's in online we have
how many to we have 2.
OK, 2 online to support.
So with the supporter, please
come up.
Good morning. Thank you, Madam
Chair, committee members, uh, my
name is Katherine Brock. I'm at
Sandoval County commissioner in
District one. we have been for
many years dealing with um wild
horses or free roaming as we
like to refer to them, um, to
the tune of about 174, uh, in my
community there are at least 5
nonprofits that are not part of
this 12-member network that are
unsustainable, many of the
individual.
s that run these nonprofits or
elderly, and if they have a
situation where they no longer
exist. I'm afraid that we're
gonna have even more horses fall
into this network of elderly or
abused animals that will need a
home, um, as I've said, I think
these nonprofits are
unsustainable, and the current
nonprofits in our systems with
the unreliable funding source
that they've had to deal with or
also unsustainable.
I support this, uh, bill, and I
hope that you will.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
And uh via Zoom we have Susan
Hemmerly.
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, members of the
committee for this opportunity
to speak on this proposed bill.
My name is Susan Hemmerly. I am
the executive director of the
horse shelter in Surios, New
Mexico, and I am also co-chair
of the New Mexico Eine Rescue
Alliance, which consists of all
of the registered equine rescues
in New Mexico. We do want to, I
do want to express our support
of creating a welfare trust fund
for equines. There is a
increase in need to take in a
stray horses from the state of
New Mexico and having a reliable
source of income will help
rescues expand their capacity to
feed and house these horses,
rehabilitate them and find them
good new homes. The horse
shelter in Surio is currently
has 94 horses in rescue. We have
a capacity of 100 with a total
possible capacity of 200 given
by the county. And in the last
two years, we have increased
our capacity by 25 horses due to
the high volume of horses being
picked up by the New Mexico
Livestock Board and needing
placements so they wouldn't go
to slaughter.
These are often I want to, I
want to highlight this. These
are often very young horses. We
get a lot of yearlings, 2 year
old, 3 year old horses, um, that
have a life ahead of them up to
or over 30 years of age, they
can become.
So, um, helping capacity
increase, which does, of course,
when we increase our capacity to
increase our expenses, but these
monies also really flow back
into the New Mexico local
economy, um, to pay for feed
supplies, professional
contractors, veterinarians, and
also by creating new jobs and,
and uh for payroll.
So, I also want to say the
support from the local community
that we receive as rescues,
which is how we are funded so
far, really does show how much
New Mexicans care for these
horses and and care for finding
dignified solutions for these
horses that need homes and
rescue.
Also, horses are really a vital
part of New Mexico's history.
Yes, and deserve our attention,
so that then please do support
the equine welfare Trust Fund.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Next is uh Laurie Michael.
Thank you, Senator Hamlin for
sponsoring this bill. I am
Laurie Michael. I am board
president of New Mexico Horse
Rescue at walking in circles
Ranch, one of 12 equine rescues
across New Mexico, licensed by
the New Mexico Livestock Board.
Collectively, these 12 rescues
are carrying for 4042 horses,
donkeys, and mules that have
been neglected, starved, or
abused. We work hard to restore
the physical health of these
animals.
And train them to trust humans
again so they can eventually be
adopted or live out their lives
in comfort and safety.
Each New Mexico nonprofit rescue
must spend nearly $4000 annually
per horse to feed and provide
medical care and training. These
funds come from the private
sector through grants and
donations, and because of this,
our funding is highly
unpredictable and has seen
decreases in the past year.
Senate Bill 358 would create a
certain and reliable source of
funding, so our shelters can
continue to provide this
life-saving care and vital
community service. Thank you for
your consideration, and we urge
you to support.
this bill.
Thank you. And do we have a, a
Tina Kleckner online?
Those kids sound like they're.
Tina
You're unmuted. Could you please
speak, Tina.
OK, so, uh,
The next person I had was Doctor
Hillary.
She's not online.
OK, so now we go to the
opposition of the opposition
would come.
And line up to
Madam Chairwoman, committee
members, my name is Tom
Patterson. I'm a cattle rancher.
Catron County, where at this
very moment, I'm feeding and
caring for 10 head of ranch
horses.
I also serve as president-elect
of the New Mexico categories
Association, most respectfully
cattle growers must oppose SB
358.
Even, even putting philosophical
issues about repurposing the
fund to one side, SB 358
authorizes payment for shelter
operations.
We question why that doesn't
violate the anti-donation clause
of our Constitution.
Second, SB 358 imposes a host of
new responsibilities on the
livestock board.
They can be found in sections
1B, 1 C, D, and G in section 2B.
It's clear even without reading
the agency bill analysis that
the approximately $16,000 a year
or so in funding.
is going to be way short of the
likely cost of performing those
duties.
Cattlemen are stepping up this
session to pay increased
inspection fees that said, we
don't want the increased fees we
pay to subsidize running the
shelter program in SB 358. We
oppose that bill. Good morning,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. My name is James
Rivera.
I stand here as a
tribal member from the
Pueblouake.
And also a former
Lobbyists for the new uh
American Wild Horse Association.
I just like to um make note of
some of the.
Uh, highlights on the fiscal
impact report, the New Mexico
Attorney General highlights that
funding private horse rescues
could be deemed unconstitutional
donation unless there is a
measureable benefit that the
state receives.
The uh state investment council
notes that equine we for trust
fund distribution methodology
deviates from the standard
practice.
Of the state investment.
Council uh managed funds.
And also the uh New Mexico.
Uh, livestock Board raises their
concerns and its role in a and I
know that they're behind me and
I'll, I'll just a presentation,
Madam Chair and and members.
Of the conservation committee,
let's be honest with ourselves.
On this bill
This bill is part of the
equation of House bill.
284 and House Bill 284
ultimately, ultimately.
Is a a termination bill of
Wild horses now I know that in
the legislation, it's they're
they're deemed free.
Uh, or a free roaming horses.
And I, I think that
You know, to
Give them a nomenclature
different than what they are is
a misrepresentation of the wild
horse.
And we need to observe the wild
horses for
Um, for who they are and, and
what the value of New Mexico is.
Now some folks may think that
they're not valuable because of
uh the herds that they are, but
in particular,
A lot of this legislation.
has been written because of the
Placita's basin.
Which holds a herd of about less
than 200.
And if we take a look at that
Plato's basin.
The, the, the homes are being
built into the horse, the
horse's home.
The horses aren't
Um, doing anything but trying to
live their life in their domain
that they have for centuries,
not decades, not years, but
centuries.
You know, um, the horses were,
were the first, the first engine
of America. That's why we call
it horsepower in cars.
You know, we've got cars named
after them. We've got uh.
professional sports teams named
after them.
you know, and we did that
because they're the spirit of
America.
Now
Some, you know, legislation like
this, you know, with, with the,
with some other attachment to it
with other legislation.
Uh, I, you know, the, the wild
horse population
will be eradicated.
Euthanized or moved beyond the
borders of New Mexico for
termination. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. I'm Belinda
Garland. I'm the executive
director for the New Mexico
Livestock Board. With all due
respect to Senator Hamlin, on
the Mexico Livestock Board has a
lot of issues with this bill,
and I don't know if you want me
to go through all of our issues.
We tried to outline everything
in the fur that was given to all
of you, I can kind of go over
the main points of it if you
would allow me the time to do
so. You're here to make
comments, so, uh.
If you want to just summarize
your comments, not go section by
section if it's in the FIR.
Yes, ma'am. Madam Chair.
So, um, we have some financial
concerns about this bill,
there's a lot of um obligations
that the Mexico Livestock Board
will have to fill it will have
to have FTEs for and contracts
for, there's no really funding
in this bill to cover that. Um,
there's also a lot of job duties
in this bill that's in the
Mexico Life. board has not the
capacity to fulfill.
And there's also um we believe
on page 2, the bottom part where
it puts us into contract, that
puts us into the Twomey factors,
which is applicable and if for
lawsuits.
Those are our main concerns.
Thank
Thank you, Belinda, we will read
uh carefully your other
comments.
Uh, anybody else in opposition.
And there was nobody online. OK,
committee members.
Questions, comments.
Senator Cia Lopez.
Um, Madam Chair, I did read the
FIR um.
And I feel like this bill needs
goes on. I really support the
idea. Um, I think these, these
horses, but the, the fact, you
know, that it might, it might
make the nonprofits subject to
IPRA, the, the fact that the
prudent investor, it's not
consistent with the
With a prudent investor rule,
um, that is being developed in
one of the bills, the fact that
it only relies on one year
average instead of 3 to 5
average, they're, there's so
many um
issues in the FIR that I think
should, it should be fixed
before it goes to um finance.
Um, because otherwise I don't
know whether finance takes a lot
of time to rewrite bills, but I
would suggest, if this is
amenable to the sponsor to go
back and fix the problems and
also have a conversation with
the New Mexico livestock Board,
uh, because they're saying that
it would take 4 FTEs, which the
first distribution is $400,000.
So, I know it it's only giving
them a $10 but it's actually
only raising what it costs the
board.
To implement it. And so I think
that there should be
conversations about, about maybe
a better way to structure it.
Maybe they're just a pass
through.
For the money or something, and
I don't believe in, in my
opinion, there is a benefit to
the state, so
I don't see it violating the
anti-donation clause, but I know
the anti-donation is almost in
the eyes of the beholder.
Um, but I think it would be good
to um.
To kind of think about that, um.
I think that the lifestyle and
talk about the talk about it
with the livestock board because
it is taking work.
that they have off their plate.
And, and that's a benefit.
Um, and so anyway, that would be
my suggestion, Madam Chair, is,
is go back and make these fixes.
I do support it, um, but.
It does need work. Thank you.
Sure, go ahead. Thank you, Madam
Chair and thank you, Senator Sid
Lopez for this. Um, you know,
we've started those
conversations. I had a good
conversation with Director
Garland in my office yesterday,
um, you know, from the
conversations that I've had, uh,
this doesn't violate the
anti-donation clause, um, but I
also understand about and I
express this with uh director
Garland about the capacity to do
this. Um, and certainly I think
the intent of the bill is there
is to take care of these horses,
but it's also to make sure that
we go through the correct
channels.
To make sure that that is done
efficiently, that it doesn't put
extra extra burden on the New
Mexico Livestock Board, but then
it also provides those resources
for those nonprofits who are uh
beyond capacity in terms of
their ability to take care of
the number of horses. So I do
appreciate that, that
conversation and um I have
committed to Director Garland as
well as my advocates that we
would have those conversations
to talk about the capacity, um,
because I think there is a, a
common agreement that this needs
to be addressed and when we're
talking about
Developing
Resources, financial resources
for long term sustainability
that we understand and that's
what we're doing all over. Um,
and so I do feel that that is
something that we can, we can
continue to work on. So I do
appreciate that comment.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
So senator, she also asked about
the um
Note that's in the FIR for the
state investment council and,
and the distribution.
That came up as an issue that
could be fixed.
Now in another
Yes, madam Chair, we, um, that
is, that is certainly something
that we can do and I don't know
if either one of you want to go
ahead and address that as well.
Um
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator, um.
We would be open to change.
To amending, um.
Happy to amend the bill to base
distributions on the calendar
year in valuations if that's
what you're regarding or
senator, would you be ready if
we we'll take further comments
today, but would you be ready
for um
A change on Saturday or next
Tuesday.
I would say next Tuesday, Madam
Chair. OK, so let's take further
comments on this bill before so
they can take everything back.
Is there any other, yes, center.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much.
I am a horse owner. I don't know
if any of y'all out there
recognize the fact that I do
raise horses.
Uh, my great grandparents
settled in New Mexico and
whenever they, they breed and
sold draft horses, so it's been
a long history.
Um
My, on my mother's side, uh.
My granddad was also a horse
trainer.
Uh, he was also part Native
American, many of y'all don't
know that either, that I am part
Native American.
Um
I raised performance horses.
That doesn't mean just graceful.
A raised rope horses we trade
them ourselves so we train them
for ranch work.
The list goes on and on and on.
And I care for my horses unlike
lots of other people out there.
I take care of my horses. That
is my duty.
And Madam Chair,
There was a time during the
COVID outbreak.
Our neighboring ranch has not
had horses on their property for
over 50 years.
For 50 years they have not had
horses on their ranch.
During the COVID outbreak,
whenever everything was shut
down, there was a time whenever
people could no longer afford to
feed their horses, so instead
of, and there is nothing that I
know of right now.
That prevents
A horse owner from being able to
sell the horses, is that
correct, Madam Chair and
senator?
Hamlin
Opportunity was there for these
people that do own horses that
can no longer care for them,
they don't want them anymore,
whatever the case may be. They
have the opportunity to sell for
somebody else.
That might want them, that would
take care of him, that we have
them as a pet. I don't care
what, but they have.
Have that opportunity to sell
their.
Unfortunately, on my night.
7 horses showed up in a pasture
that where the water lines had
been turned off because they
were resting that pasture.
They had not checked that
pasture in quite a while.
They were out checking fences
one day and one of the hired
hands spotted these horses.
People that did that should be
pardon my language here, horse
whipped for that. That's like
somebody bringing their dogs
that they no longer want out to
my property and dumping them for
me to take care of when in
essence all those animals are
doing are trying to kill my
property and my property is also
raising cattle.
Madam Chair
Thank goodness for the livestock
board.
In New Mexico, our horses do not
have to be branded.
You're having a performance
horse on the racetrack.
Right now those horses have to
be chipped.
If they are older than 2 years
old right now.
They are tattooed on the madam
cheer, I don't know how many of
y'all Cervantes was here
whenever Kiki Sabara was still
alive and he was telling about
some of, OK, uh, telling about
some of the problems they were
having up in the South Valley
whenever there was a big
economic turndown, people could
no longer afford.
There were instances he told me
about of uh
Several horses that were found
along the in the bar ditches in
the South Valley.
But those horse's head.
severed.
So the horses could not be
identified.
Those people could have sold
their horses if they wanted to.
Right now, I, whenever I was
reading in your bill there are.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
read this and I have it marked
here.
That there are 12 rescue.
Organizations.
And Madame Chair.
And Senator Hamlin, those are
all.
Let me see if I can find that
exact language here, and I
probably 501c3 so there are 12
of them, you say that they're
all full right now, is that
correct?
Did I hear that right, Madam
Chair Senator Hamlin, Madam
Chair and Senator Isel, they're
all at capacity, and those are
12 that are registered to work
with the livestock board, as we
heard from one of the public
testimony, there are several
madam chair, would there be any?
There would be no.
If a person decided they wanted
to become one of these New
Mexico equine shelters.
Uh, what would be the
Steps that they would have to go
to to become one of these
shelters.
Well, first and foremost to be
designated as a 501c3, so there
are articles of incorporation,
Madam Chair, also getting the
board of directors, making sure
they file with the state, the
Secretary of State's office, uh,
you know, the standard
procedures for a nonprofit to
become a registered nonprofit.
And then, Madam Chair, I believe
that they would work with the
livestock Board to be part of
this program, but right now
there are the 12 that are
working in partnership with the
Livestock Board.
OK, but
So people, other people can do
that. They have to set up their
corporation, they have to do
filing with Secretary of State,
set up the board, all of this
type of stuff.
But Madam chair, I could also
see.
Some problems with that. I
really do.
I, I'm, I'm gonna backtrack just
a little bit. I have done some
figuring on what it costs to to.
Maintain a horse for a year,
madam chair.
And Senator
And these ladies right here I'm
sure can correct me if I'm wrong
in my figure.
As far as feed costs go, it runs
about $3500 a year. Yes, ma'am,
it is. I've already put that is
not cost including the cost of a
ferrier.
That is not including the cost
of a veterinarian that is not
including the cost of having
that horse's teeth worked on. I
can show you a picture right now
on my phone of horse's mouth.
That this the horse was not able
to eat.
Because of the amount of
Problems, this horse was having
with their teeth.
An equine dentist had to come
and work on that horse's teeth
so the horse.
But that still did not prevent
those people from being able to
sell that horse.
Instead of letting it
stand there to starve to death.
Madam chair.
As a a horse owner, a
responsible horse owner and most
people throughout the state are
responsible horse owners. I've
had the opportunity to see one
of these.
Eine shelters at work and what
they were doing to get these
horses.
Where they could be sold.
What is the opportunity right
now with these shelters? Are
they allowed to sell these
horses?
Madam Chair and Senator, um, we,
we do have, if you remember a
couple of years ago, we did the
writer first refusal that
allowed nonprofits to have
access to those horses before
they went to auction. And so
there certainly is that
opportunity to do that so that
they don't go immediately into a
slaughter, uh, line or for uh
abuse across the border.
Madam chair,
That's the problem with the
United States right now, there
is no.
slaughter plant for horses in
the United States and the.
A trustees that do happen across
the border are sickening if it,
if there was still a facility in
the United States with.
Government oversight.
We are doing those horses a
disservice whenever they do
cross the border. I have seen
sickening. It really is.
But what we've created in the
United States because we can't
kill our horses to help another
country that might believe in
eating horse meat. That it is
not our right to determine one
another.
country can eat.
We have cut that off right now.
But what I have a problem with,
we are taking taxpayers'
dollars.
To uh if if there's a gift, if
there's a foundation, if there's
a.
Whatever the case may be for
these shelters, I don't have a
problem with it that's that.
Individuals
Purview to be able to fund
these, and I do not have a
problem with that, but to take.
Taxpayers' dollars out of.
Our coffers up here to say we
are going to help these horses.
To help these
Facilities, the 12 facilities
that you're talking about.
I have a problem with that.
Whenever the New Mexico
livestock Board does take in
horses, Madam Chair and Senator
Hamlin.
They have to hold them for a
certain amount of time.
They have to put notice out
there as anybody, you know, are
you miss Russell, uh.
Did it get out of the pin and
run off. They do have to take
that into consideration. They
have to hold it.
Right now
Just west of me in the Ridosa
area.
We have
I'm not gonna call them wild
horses because they're not. I'll
call them what they are, they're
feral horses.
These horses
have been
At one time belonged to
somebody.
Evidently the people didn't want
them anymore. They could not
take care of him anymore,
whatever the case may be.
That herd is growing
incrementally.
And we have
Stallions that are breeding
their daughters, we have grand
stallions breeding their
granddaughters.
We are going to have somebody
killed very soon whenever these
horses do cross the road because
I was behind a pickup that was
going around a curve and a herd
of horses ran down the hill, ran
it, it injured the wife.
It
Totaled the pickup.
We had to call in a veterinarian
that I know personally to come
up there because.
Law enforcement. I'm not gonna
say which agency. The law
enforcement was afraid to shoot
this horse that had broken his
leg right up here. There was no
fixing that horse at all.
Because they did not want to be
sued by a special interest group
that was involved in that area.
Whenever there is death of a
human being due to these herds
that are growing.
Bigger and bigger all the time,
there is a problem there.
The Livestock Board has their
hands tied whenever they do take
in these horses.
Madam Chair, I, I know that.
A Director Garland and all of
her staff has.
Taking a lot of heat over the
years.
Regarding the feral horses that
are up there.
Uh, they even
Put a posting up there and I
can't remember how long it ran,
like 2 weeks, I believe, or if
these are your horses, let us
know horses were trespassing on
private property.
They were endangering other
horses that were on that
property, yet the livestock
board got.
Chastised for doing what the reg
rules and regulations of their
agency is, madam chair.
We don't need.
For taxpayers to take up the
role of funding.
These horses whenever these a
lot of these horses are old.
What did these, uh,
Certain
Facilities do whenever the horse
does.
Madam, that is my question
there.
And I'm sure if I can just go
ahead and, and make sure that we
understand. You're asking what
do the the animal shelters, the
rescues do when a, when a horse
passes and usually a horse that
has been abused or neglected,
does have a shorter life
lifetime than a horse that has
been taken care of all of its
life.
I had to put down my 28 year old
gelding that I wrote for.
Ever never, and my daughter took
it, rode that horse to the
national finals, madam chair,
Senator Hamlin, and it broke my
heart.
Have to put that horse down.
I was not going to turn him over
to somebody else to go down
south.
And we had him euthanized.
But what does uh facility do
whenever a horse dies.
Mm
Senator
Um
I
They dispose of the horse just
like a private individual, what
if a horse is suffering that the
shelter will euthanize, provide
humane euthanasia.
OK, and madam chair.
Uh
Whenever you say that you might
have them euthanize, some of
them just die on their own, and
I'm no, they do.
Oh
Where do these horses go? She
said, you meaning after they
passing what
what happens to their bodies.
By a disposal company, where did
they go?
You can't put them in a
landfill, I know that, so what
did, what are they doing with
the carcasses?
And uh Madam Chair, Senator, I
don't have the um a specific
answer, I know that uh they do
use disposal services as in
private individuals do. I think
they have access to the same.
Disposal services. OK, and Madam
Chair, I know that there might
be a fee incurred on this as
well, Madam Cheer.
I also raised alfalfa.
And I know what the cost of
alfalfa is right now, it's um um
right now with this being
February, it's running about.
$280 a ton.
Forces to once they reach a
certain weight to maintain that
weight.
They should be given free Choice
alfalfa.
Usually about 2 gallons of grain
a day.
Does Kaska are getting higher
and higher.
Madam Cheer
It's not up to the state of New
Mexico to pick up the tab for
these horses.
Whenever these horses could have
been sold for somebody else's
shoes.
Madam Chair
I think that this bill.
While it is in essence.
It is a feel-good bill. I feel
sorry for these horses that have
been neglected.
It really pisses me off whenever
we have irresponsible people out
there that say, oh, we'll get
this horse, it'll be fun for the
kids to ride, we can keep it in
the backyard.
And then they realized that they
can't afford to do that because
his horse is starving to death.
The horse is not getting ridden.
The horse is neglected.
Those are the people that we
need to go after to pick up
where they left off on not being
madam chair.
I have read every one of these
analysis that's come in. I've
read the one from the State
Investment council.
Um
They have a conflict with it.
There's technical issues with
this bill.
Um
It bothers me that the
veterinarian board has the same
problems with it, the livestock
Board has big problems with it.
Um
It's not gonna stop anybody
from.
Let's say going over to.
Hobbs, New Mexico.
I'm gonna start.
A facility here for rescue
horses.
And I'm gonna get all these
horses off the racetrack that
are no longer racing at this
time, and I'm gonna see if I
have.
A means of being able to pay for
these horses while they're
resting here.
And that is a distinct
possibility.
I see, I can see where.
There could be a lot of mischief
that would take place.
Madam Chair.
This is not the way we need to
go to put this on the back of.
I do see that there is an uh we
will be in violation of the
anti-donation clause in the
state's constitution.
And, well, I
do have that soft spot in my
heart.
I know that we cannot do this to
all the taxpayers. So, Madam
Chair, thank you for letting me
go on and on about this.
Thank you.
Thank you. So, um, Senator,
we've asked you to look at the
SIC's comments revised, bring
back.
Yes ma'am. Sure. OK, thank you
very much for being here today
and I appreciate the comments
from the committee, but we will
come back to this item on
Tuesday morning. It will
probably be the first thing
Tuesday, thank you. Thank you,
madams,
we go to the floor at 11:30. We
have a little extra time. I just
want to remind you that uh
Saturday morning we have a 4.
Bills or more uh scheduled.
We have some uh again breakfast
you tired of them, yeah.
And um
We will see you Saturday
morning.
And the Senate is going onto the
floor Saturday afternoon.
So we will, uh, I believe we're
going on it.
1:30, but Senator Worz will
challenge and all that.
