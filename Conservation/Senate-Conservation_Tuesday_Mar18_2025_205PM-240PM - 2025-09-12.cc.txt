I know I am.
OK, y'all let that one slide,
madam chair.
What I'm seeing here with this
particular bill.
This is something I bought,
brought up many, many years ago.
This is gonna be a nightmare for
any title attorium.
Are y'all not disagreeing with
me?
I'm sure you will be because
it'll be, it won't be easy.
And whenever I'm looking at page
6 of your bill.
And let me make, let me make
sure that we are on the same
page on this bill, ending in
897.3.
OK.
Because a while ago we were
working and it was two different
fields going on, so I wanted to
make sure we were all working
off the same bill.
On page 6 of the bill starting
on line 10, we have the name and
address what this is going to
do. Do you have to get your
description and everything else.
Then you have to find the names
and addresses of the owners of
the service estate within the
sequestration unit.
And land and a lance within one
half mile of the exterior
boundary of that unit.
You drop on down, you have to go
to the county county assessor's
office.
With respect to the privately
owned land, then you have to
check with, and if it's not
privately, only check with the
Bureau of Land Management in
respect to federal lands, the
commission.
with respect to state trust
lands and the applicable state
agency only the surface state
with respect to lands owned by
the state but not subject to the
jurisdiction of the commissioner
public land.
You also have to make sure that
within a half mile uh exterior
boundary of the proposed
sequestration unit, you have to
get the names and addresses of
Owners of the poor space estate
within the proposed
sequestration unit.
And for all lands within 10 mile
of the exterior boundary of the
sequestration unit.
That's gonna be a nightmare.
So a person could actually
Oh.
What's up for me.
A person could actually own.
At one time owned the land.
On the poor space and on the
mineral rights and until each
one of those separately. Is that
not correct?
Um, Madam Chair, senators.
Um
That part of the the the
notification part is model
exactly after oil and gas is how
we do it right now. So we, we
know how to do that kind of
noticing.
But you're
You're right. They would have to
sell the minerals and the poor
before they sold the servants,
but they could sell all three in
theory.
A separate entities, yes.
Madam Chair, I'm gonna stop for
right now. Thank you.
Senator Scott.
Maximum injection.
Right.
Ma Senator Scott, he's asking
about what the maximum injection
pressure of the surfaces.
That's that's a uh.
calculation basically just like
SWD based on the weight of the
water column, it's gonna go by
something very similar to that
in the.
And, and, and the injection
permit. So that's a safety
concern.
Uh, and to mitigate a little bit
because you have to use
compressible whereas water is
not.
You don't see the same kind of
water how back in the reservoir
with CO2 usually do with water.
But uh
There's gonna be a statutory
limit on health.
High blood pressure is gonna be,
it's going to be set by
Either formula like uh for
saltwater disposal or.
Or by
whatever modeling is available
that gives you an idea of how
fast you can inject.
And the
No establishment of radiant, for
example.
And will be somewhere below that
with uh
factor
Mount G and Senator Scott, yeah,
that's exactly right, you're
gonna, you're gonna be well
below.
What could break the road.
At the injection.
Not just the rock, but the rock
layer above it that's sealing
the CO2 from going up.
Even more important
But yeah, and no one, no one's
gonna let you inject to create
fractures unless you have a
fracture.
Oh thank you
Senator Pope.
Madam Chair, Representative
Senator, Senator, thank you for
being a conservation. I have a
few questions.
It was mentioned about
believe carbon capture.
Just if you could talk to me a
little bit about it, I don't
wanna take too long, but
Um, how efficient is that from
the information I have.
Um
Not really getting a high
percentage of carbon capture
from.
Facilities with the fans of you
with a little bit.
Ianer Senator Pope.
In the North see what they're
doing is they are not emitting
CO2 from natural gas production.
two fields and um I can't
remember the name of the other
one at the moment.
They were told by the Norwegian
government that in the 1990s
they would pay $100 per ton if
they emitted CO2, and CO2.
So they take the CO2 to the
shore, and they do their gas
processing, they ship the CO2
back to the
the field and injected at the
bottom of the reservoir.
provide some reservoir support
to the keep producing the gas,
but they have to keep that CO2
in the loop where they face that
penalty.
All the CO2 projects, especially
in the US, uh, if they're going
to benefit from 45 tax credit,
have to do the same thing, or
else they will have the IRS come
after them.
to get that CO2 back.
See efficiency like anything
else, the, the efficiency is, is
based upon
Uh
On how much you want to catch at
what purity.
You want to catch that, uh,
direct air capture if you use
green energy, uh, it's around
94%.
Um
Effective in capturing CO2.
versus the CO2 that emits so
it'll 99.
Uh, uh, 4%.
Uh
Captured in 0.6% remitted.
if you look at coal plants, that
number comes down to maybe about
20% loss of efficiency, but the
end result is.
Unless you two going to the
atmosphere.
And that's uh that's the win for
the environment.
Madam Chair, thank you,
Representative Senator experts.
Um, you know, I had a chance to
listen to you with the.
about 458 and yesterday as well.
And, and I apologize if
I'm asking a question of that
bill, um.
Disregard or say this isn't. I
get frustrated.
So
Um, I apologize.
But
The question I have is that
We're seeing here on this one
pager. Thanks for doing this.
Um
And you'd have a
direct air capture facility.
Near well and set this up. I'd
also assume.
Maybe industry would maybe set
up something similar.
could possibly.
to capture their carbon with
win.
They're producing. Is that the
thought here that could happen.
Senator.
Uh, absolutely. So director of
Capture is actually an outgrowth
of carbon capture.
Uh, the carbon capture is a very
old technology, basically you
have a
Chemically sensitive solution
called an amine which will
preferentially absorb CO2 a one
temperature and release it in a
different temperature.
Director capture does exactly
the same thing. There's a lot of
different.
Formula for this, some of them,
um.
Make water and use a little bit
of water.
Generally speaking, we're
talking about an outgrowth from
the existing technology.
So, when you're talking about a
point source. If you have a uh
coal plant or if you have a
natural gas switching plant or
if you have a cement plant or an
ethanol plant or a fertilizer
plant, anything like that.
You, you would put that
equipment right there on site.
And then you would move
The CO2 from there to the place
that you're going to inject it,
maybe through a very short
pipeline, maybe through a longer
pipeline.
But in general, uh, for direct
air capture, you're going to be
I
your facility where the
injection is going to go to
minimize that, that transport
distance.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for that response.
Um
You know, I will say in the
presentation.
Yesterday on the other bill in
this bill, I'm really
Not hearing much about.
The importance of this uh
standpoint of
Climate change.
I'm hearing more about
Jobs, economic development.
Um
You know, what we need to do
with this.
So that concerns me a little
bit, because I think
If this is part of one of those
tools to
Deal with this, um.
I think we should talk about
that.
And so, um, I just want to give
you an opportunity to settle.
Thank you so much, uh, Madam
Chair and Senator, um.
This is a huge component.
Climate change is a huge
component, um, and I think that
there are two factors, um, in
particular that, that are
relevant. Um, number one, and,
and Doctor Balch can actually
speak to exactly how much carbon
dioxide, we have to remove from
the atmosphere.
The world we have already
exceeded.
Our CO2 emissions. So even if we
stop everything today, this
planet already has too many, too
much CO2. We have to remove it
and we have to store it. And we
don't, we can't plant enough
trees, um.
To do that. That's why we're
doing carbon dioxide removal
through direct air capture and
point source carbon capture. So
that is one thing that every
international agency, uh, with
scientists, rep like all of the
reports are very clear that we
have to remove carbon dioxide.
The second thing, you know, as I
talked about in the.
Introduction is in order to
continue a clean energy
transition.
We have to, we're gonna be
emitting carbon dioxide, and
that's because of the high
temperatures to make steel, to
make carbon fiber, to make
glass, all of the things that
are required for renewable
energy.
We have to, we're gonna keep
doing that, um, and so in order
to offset the emissions that are
a result of that.
We need to capture those. Um, so
I would say that, you know, for
me,
The fact that we have to do it.
In order to even come close to
our climate goals.
Um, and then in order to build
the things that we need to
build.
For the transition, we wanna um
capture that, that carbon.
I'm madam chair.
And
This is the, that's a very good
question.
Uh, you know, you have to speak
a little bit to your audience so
you're talking to finance about
financial things, but if you're
regarding conservation, you
should be talking about one of
the positives of events positive
benefits for the environment.
I'm gonna this system and the
geophysicist after that, my PhD.
studying her science for my
whole adult life.
Um, years ago I was asked to do
a paper on the path to Net Zero.
worldwide.
And there was not a path, and
I'm not the only person that has
observed this.
All these international agencies
tell us we need to capture 6 to
8 billion tons a year.
2050 starting about 3 years ago.
To meet the Paris accord goals
and that Paris Accord goal is a
60% reduction, not 100%
reduction.
about 100% you need to increase
that even more.
The real problem, I know it's
hard to see there, but the
The left hand side there that is
the rest of the world, they are
growing their hydrocarbon use
dramatically.
over the next 25 years.
part of the world that's
interested in cutting their
emissions.
We're doing a much better job if
you look at California, if you
look at Germany, if you look at
New Mexico.
We can meet our specific goals,
but we don't live.
In a vacuum. There's the whole
world around us and the whole
world around us is uh screaming
at us and we need these
technologies to make a
difference. Doesn't mean that
you're trying to
We need lots of renewables too.
Doesn't mean you don't need a
lot of anything. You basically
need a lot of everything.
Including carbon capture, and I
think that this is a
A real key component.
That needs to be considered by
anybody that wants to meet those
kind of goals.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative Senator.
So
I know in the discussion we're
talking about that we already
have these wells.
Talking about
If you just tell me how
Wells right now are
Helping us deal with climate,
but what is the
Madam chair, Senator.
I, I did, um, a little bit of a
Research and that research
showed that in 22,000.
2% of world power was made by
solar.
In 2023 that had grown to 5.5%.
So that's an example of a
technology that once it's been
taken seriously, once it's been
incubated, once it's being
applied in application starts to
grow.
I need to grow a lot more.
That's going to, but it can't
probably get to 100% by 2050.
Same thing with this. You have,
uh, in the North Sea since 1996,
around a million tons a year of
CO2 that's going into storage.
That's the longest operating
project on the planet.
US, there are 276 projects in
the pipeline, 132 of those are
in advanced development in 19
are operating today.
In the Permian Basin.
Just an acid gas wells, which
are mainly CO2 storage wells.
They're they are storing a
couple of million tons a year.
In 2023, which is the last year
you have complete numbers for
6.75 million tons were stored in
the US.
Almost all that
In New Mexico and West Texas.
I mean, it's, it's one of those
things where
Technology is there. It's
mature.
You can go buy this equipment
from Mitsubishi Heavy
Technologies, if you want to
attach capture onto your.
whatever industrial source you
have.
Now it needs to have the room to
grow. It needs to have the
regulatory space to grow and it
needs to have a regulations
around it so that companies
We will pursue these.
Four years ago, there were
3 dock companies. Now there's
over 4000.
Same exact thing. You're gonna
see an acceleration where you go
from that 6.75 to hopefully that
6.75 gigatons.
Uh, you know, 1,000% growth over
the next 20 years.
That's what we need.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you Representative Senator, um.
If, if we could kind of keep on
short.
Do we have any
Yeah uh
in
On
The impacts of.
George
Um, I turned with
Some of the chemical reactions.
talking about.
you know, carbon dioxide.
But do we know about the law?
attacks of.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, I
apologize for my long answers.
Oh, you're good.
I don't
And
Um
I think that that things deserve
an explanation.
That's why I probably spent too
much time in, in answering
questions, but
A lot has been studied about CO2
and what happens when you put it
into the ground. The very first
thing that happens is the CO2
absorbs in water.
around 30% of it over just a few
days or weeks. That's how we
make carbonated water, beer,
things like that. You put CO2
into the liquid.
Um, that makes that CO2 hard to
move unless you also move that
water molecule.
Over the next 10s of years and
hundreds of years, another 1/3
of that season will turn into
rocks.
still in that poor basin becomes
solid.
That's why I said earlier that
over time these projects become
safer.
Rather than more dangerous. The
other thing is the pressure that
you apply to push that down, you
have to have an equal pressure
at a release point for it to
come back out.
And that means you have to
deliberately try to extract it,
and even then.
If you look at enhanced
recovery, and they'll probably
not popular.
some people, but
Uh, if they could get all back,
they'd be happy to. They can get
about 20%.
On a single pass.
They lose CO2.
And over a long periods of time
they lose all of the seeds. It
gets stuck in the rocks. It's
hard to move.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative. Thank you,
Senator.
You know, I, I'm just kind of
struggling with this.
And what you're trying to do.
I understand we're not gonna be
able to plant enough trees.
But
It also means that we have to
stop doing what we're doing.
the
Maybe this is
part of the mix.
I just don't know if I'm there
yet.
The other question about the
primacy and question.
We do that and then we kind of
control this.
But
Once again, struggle with.
Where we are
Really going down this road, so
my last question, Madam Chair.
Representative senator and
expert is.
I'm being told this is already
being done. Why, why do we need
a house built for people?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. The reason that we
want House Bill 457 is because
we want as a legislature, uh, to
be able to set forth the
standards that we want, New
Mexico operators to follow.
We, you know.
This is our opportunity to say
to Energy Minerals Natural
Resources. These are the things
that have to be in place before
you're allowed to grant a
permit. Right now, we, you know,
that's all happening with the
EPA.
But this is our opportunity to
say.
We are gonna take the EPA
standards and we are gonna add
to them. We're gonna say you
have to have tribal
consultation. You have to do
community engagement in X, Y, Z
ways, and you have to have a
community benefits agreement.
That this is our opportunity to
make sure that this works for
New Mexicans and works for our
communities.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative. Thank you,
Senator, and
So, uh, Madam Chair and senator,
I think that
What we're, what we're really
trying to get out here is
multiple wins.
So this is a win for the climb.
Um, you're gonna pull billions
if we do this on, on a large
scale, billions of tons of CO2
out of the air that otherwise we
can't.
So we can't pull it out now.
So when
Uh, it's going to be a win.
For the economy of New Mexico,
it's going to create economic
base industries.
Where people will put money into
New Mexico as opposed to people
just taking money out of New
Mexico. And I want to share with
you Lu Lufthansa, a German
airline.
Uh, pace.
For carbon, um.
Credits
OK. So now Lufthansa can pay New
Mexico or New Mexico company,
uh, because they would get that
carbon credit because we would
be taking
CO2 out of the air.
So economic base uh win, uh, I
think it's a win for people, not
only do you get jobs, but if we
in fact pull those billions of
tons out of the air, then
folks here that were concerned
about the climate. Well, they
win too, because now we've,
we've done something real.
And finally, New Mexico wins
because New Mexico gets to
decide what the rules are.
Not somebody in Washington, not
somebody in Dallas who's
currently making those rules. I
think it's win, win, win, win.
that perspective.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative Senator, not
a big fan of the carbon credits,
but thank you friendly. If I
could ask you one more question,
Senator.
Um
telling me you believe in
Senator, the
climate always changes.
That's what I thought that I'm
sure that's a lot.
All right. Not seeing any other
Any other questions or comments?
Do I have a motion?
OK, we have a motion for uh do
pass motion from Senator Scott.
Do we have a second
Senator Charlie's got a second.
OK, uh, Madam Secretary, go
ahead and call the roll, please.
Santa Cervantes, his excused
Senator Charley.
Charlie No, Senorel.
I passes, Senator Hamlin.
I have an excuse, Senator Pope.
No.
the Pope, no, Senator Scott.
It's got, yes, Senator Townsend.
In Townsend, yes.
There's the onus is excused.
Thennocia Lopez, I mean, excuse
me, Senator el.
Oh, yes, Sania Lopez.
No, and I will explain my vote
after Senator Charlie.
Um
Let, let's get through this.
Senator Charlie to explain her
vote.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator and Representative
and experts, um.
Several questions, but chose to
forego them.
Um, because we've heard a lot
this.
Session about
Heeding the federal government's
warning about
Listening to them or the sky
will fall.
The rug will get pulled.
Funding will dry up if we do not
align with
Federal
Directive.
And today, Madam Cha, I choose
to keep that warning. Thank you.
Thank you. And I, I just want to
say, um, I think this industry
needs subsidization in order to
work, and I know this bill
doesn't require that, but I
think it's gonna need a lot of
subsidization. This is very
expensive industry. What I'm
worried about, it's just gonna
be a, a carbon credit kind of
kind of deal.
I also, and this is gonna sound
weird at this time, but I over
the last two decades have had
enormous respect for the EPA. I
think it is what a jewel.
In federal government, I am
worried about what's going to
happen to it, but those, they
have, I just looked it up, uh,
on the EPA website, which is
Which is just
Incredible, uh, and they have a
manual that is about 90 some
pages on regulations for this
industry. I think what we need
to do is to start this or to
really give uh people's security
is to pass a law identifying who
owns the the port space. I think
that's, that's crucial, exactly,
and then leave it alone and let
EPA.
Uh, you know, that cause then
contracts can happen, things,
things can move forward.
I just, you know, I thought a
lot about the primacy thing
cause that had attraction at
first. I was like,
Yeah, yeah, we should do it. But
then I look at how strained our
agencies are.
And how underfunded they have
been.
And the fact that they haven't
Really done a great job of
enforcing
The regulations we have on the
books. And so I started
thinking, well,
The EPA has this incredible
manual. If they're they're
giving the permits and
everything else. There was
another.
Smaller thing, I didn't see the
state land office here, but it
does cut her out.
Um
I think it does cause it says
that the.
That the um
Um
And uh Ener is going to be the
agency that deals with it, so I
was like, well, where's the
state land office? Well, anyway,
that, that also was a concern,
not the major concern, but a
concern about this bill.
And so, um, that, those are my
concerns. I understand that
Senator Townsend may have a
substitute motion.
OK, there's a motion for a no
wreck.
Um
Do I have a second?
OK, uh, that are no
recommendation motion from
Senator Townsend, seconded by um
Senator Azel.
Um, Madam Secretary, will you
call the roll?
Cervantes.
Excuse Senator Charlie.
Charlie No, send herself.
And so, yes, Senator Hamlin is
excused Senator Pope.
Nope, no. Senator Scott.
It's got, yes. Senator Townsend.
The Townsend yes send to Fonics
is excuses, Senator Dia Lopez.
Nope,
no.
That's the problem with having a
tie a committee an even numbered
committee, um, OK, with the
With a 33 motion for a do pass
and a 33 uh.
The 3-3 results in uh no wreck.
Um, I'm sorry, your, your bill
does not proceed from me.
Thank you.
Next on the agenda, we have um
HB 295, another easy is easy
peasy bill.
Um
The tax on property owned by New
Mexico Rita.
And I believe we have um
Representative Small.
And repent is start coming,
she might be, uh, chair, but I
know we're on the floor and
there's a bunch of different
buildings we're, we're no longer
on the floor, but we uh do have
tax committees starting soon,
so. Um, so far we've got a
corum, so we're good to go.
OK, great. Thank you very much,
Madam Chair. Uh, Madam Chair,
uh, House Bill 295 clarifies uh
the portion of the property tax
code to align with the current
practice and the historical
expectations around the New
Mexico Rita renewable energy
Transmission Authority, uh,
standing as a governmental
entity, uh, Madam Chair,
committee, since Rita was
created in 2007 as a
governmental entity.
Uh, it's been intended and
represented to all project
partners that um
That the land used for renewable
energy transmission, uh,
projects and energy projects was
tax exempt, uh, both to Rita and
also to project partners who
leased portions uh back from
Rita. Since that time, Madam
Chair, we've seen billions of
dollars of investment in our
state, the largest clean energy
transmission line, uh, in North
America and the uh therefore the
largest onshore wind farm in
North America.
all because of the renewable
energy transmission Authority
because of Rita and it's clear
understanding that the um
Uh
The governmental entity standing
ensured the development of those
transmission lines was not
subject to property tax.
It's critical that we pass House
Bill 295, uh, also Cenel 555. I
know it's been, which is a
mirror bell.
If we don't pass these, Madam
Chair committee, it will be a
serious impediment to
development, and it would send a
signal at the exact wrong time,
uh, around transmission and
therefore development of
renewable energy, and it would
mean that we would not be
honoring our long-standing
commitments as a state.
Madam Chair, committee, this
bill does not, uh,
Uh, impact existing revenue from
counties. Again, I want very
much stress this is the current
practice, uh, where in um
counties are receiving revenue
through community benefit
agreements and other things, not
through uh the property tax, uh,
property taxes, Madam Chair.
Further our own taxation and
revenue Department has confirmed
that they ultimately assess
property taxes on a property
owner.
In this case, Rita renewable
energy Transmission Authority is
the property owner and as a
governmental entity is not
subject to that tax. So
therefore, these, uh, those
taxes can be collected.
Ultimately man committee, this
is a cleanup bill to align with
uh current practice, long
standing uh expectation and
forward expectation that is
critical to continuing to
develop transmission, uh, and
develop our world-class.
energy resources, um.
Lynne Mosteller from uh
renewable Energy Transmission
Authority, who is the executive
director, uh, also Jeremy
Turner, a former Rita executive
director now is patterned New
Mexico or here as experts.
Uh, with that, I turn it over to
Lyn for any brief comments. I
know it's been a very long day,
Madam Chair committee, so we'll
work to be very brief and
appreciate you hearing us. Thank
you.
Good afternoon, chair and
committee members. um, good
afternoon. I'm here today as
Rita's executive director to
speak in favor of HB 295.
Um, it's a technical fix to the
property tax code for Rita-owned
projects. This clarification is
based on the constitutional and
other statutory provisions that
exempt Rita-owned properties
from property tax.
In 2007, the Rita Act was passed
to incentivize private
investment in transmission lines
to unlock renewable energy
projects, Rita has been
incredibly successful and other
Western states regularly seek
our advice as they design their
own Rita type programs.
Rita serves as a key part of
putting together comprehensive
private, public-private
structures to enable tens of
billions of dollars.
And renewable energy investments
in New Mexico along with the
jobs and local growth receipts
tax that come from these
projects.
Uh, reads a state entity has
tax-exempt status established in
the New Mexico Constitution,
Rita is able to leverage that
status with developers to lower
the cost of transmission
operations through an
acquisition lease back
structure.
This structure allows a tax
exemption just for Rita on
projects.
Re-owned property, including the
transmission lines and related
structures, not for wind farms
that use the transmission. Um.
I stand for questions. Thank
you.
Who in the audience is in favor
of this legislation.
Who, who in the audience as
opposed to this legislation.
OK, just in the entrance of
time, could we have like 2 or 3
