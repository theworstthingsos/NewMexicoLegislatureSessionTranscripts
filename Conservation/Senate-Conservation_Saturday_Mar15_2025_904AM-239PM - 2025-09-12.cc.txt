had a meal.
Madam Chair, uh, senators, this
bill is aimed at providing
adequate funding for land grant
verseds and assea infrastructure
project needs both the land
grams and asseias have
infrastructure projects that
total in the tens of millions of
dollars. Now what we've been
doing, Madam Chair and senators,
as we've been providing capital
outlay that are small band-aids
for a major projects and needs
uh in the areas in the state of
New Mexico when it's land grants
and A.
This bill will address those
unmet needs by creating a
funding mechanism to fully fund
land grab Meds and
infrastructure projects. This
bill accomplishes this by
creating two separate
infrastructure project ones, one
for land grants and the others
for assass. Those projects will,
will be funded in two possible
ways, one immediate and the
other long term. With that, we'd
like to introduce our two expert
witnesses to our left is Paula
Garcia, and to the right are
Turo Archileta, and we'll start
with Paula Garcia for a few.
works.
And in the audience, madam
chair, is representative Susan
Eta, who's also assisting with
this bill who will not be
speaking but is here in support.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
Paula Garcia, the executive
director of the New Mexicoe
Association. The purpose of this
bill is to have a reliable
Recurring funding sources for a
second line infrastructure.
Our purpose is to make sure that
these projects are administered
in a manner that ensures project
completion in a timely manner.
The needs for a second
infrastructure are tremendous.
There are over 700 Asecas and 23
counties across the state.
A second support.
The agricultural economy and
livelihoods of thousands of
families, in addition in
addition to supporting aquifer
recharge.
We have compiled a list of unmet
needs that totals over 70
million in just the past two
years, for federal cost share,
as well as for um um funded ICIP
priorities.
The second infrastructure
project fund that would be
created under this bill would be
managed by the Maseca Bureau of
the Interstate Stream
Commission. They have been
administering a second project
since the 1980s. They recently
formalized the Sea bureau and
expanded staff.
They operate in accordance with
agency guidelines, with two
funding cycles for engineering
design, as well as construction.
Uh, this ensures project
completion than in their last
fiscal year, they had a 90%
completion rate for projects,
and that is our, uh, the goal
that we're trying to achieve
with this, uh, this legislation
man. um, thank you and uh oh
yeah.
One of the Madam Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Arleta. I'm with the New Mexico
Land Grant Council. Um, I'll
keep my comments brief. I think
the um sponsors have done a good
job of of presenting uh what the
purpose of the bill is, um, what
I will share with the committee
is that uh the type of projects
that land grant communities
engage in in terms of
infrastructure and project needs
and they include community
multi-purpose center
constructions and improvements,
um, affordable housing
infrastructure for those
affordable housing developments,
a community park.
playground construction and
improvements.
Community Fire Department
construction and improvements,
economic development, uh, in
those, those communities, um,
community drinking water systems
as well as community wastewater
systems, preservation of
historic community buildings and
culture museums, as well as dam
repairs and improvements, and
then also heavy equipment
purchases to maintain the common
roads that they have that allow
the community to sort of access
areas around the community as
well as the common lands, and
with that surely.
Thank you. Um, let's see how
many people in the audience are
here to support this.
OK, how many people are here to
oppose it.
In the audience, I mean online,
how many people to support?
Spice. OK, so, um, I'm gonna
take 2 from the audience to
speak to for online. We have a
packed agenda this morning. So
could two people come up to
speak, uh, please?
Madam Chair, before
yes, wait a minute, sorry, we're
not going to the bill yet, so
take a seat. Wait a minute,
senator just a minute.
Uh, you're gonna need to take a
seat. We're gonna deal with the
amendment first.
That's what we do in here.
So I'm sorry, I jumped the gun
to go to the bill.
So Senator Hemi.
Madam, we do have an amendment
that we would like to have moved
for the purpose of discussion.
OK. So do I have a motion for
discussion?
I will.
For purposes of discussion, for
purposes of discussion. So,
Senator, please proceed. Thank
you, Madam Chair, and I'm going
to yield to either Artu or
Paula. I've been asked to head
to the tax committee as soon as
I can.
Uh, no, I need a senator who
wants the amendment to explain
the amendment before we adopt it
this amendment does is we had
excluded the colonials from the
bill, and typically when we ran
a bill that dealt with the tiff
with um landgrat Mercedraseas,
the Colonias Down south were
also included when there was an
increase. What this would do was
instead of giving the tiff the
2% that the original bill
requested.
But then asked that the tiff be
increased by 1%, and we bring
the colonials in, and they would
get that 1%. So we're not
increasing the capacity what
we're doing is we're, we're
going down by 1% with the tiff
and giving that 1% to the
colonials to include them, and
that's with this amendment does.
OK, Senator, I'm gonna start the
discussion.
Senator, there is a colonious
fund.
So why would they be included in
this bill?
Madam Chair, we're just
increasing the amount that the
colonials would be getting in
that fund. Representative, did
you want to say something?
chair, um,
The original bill upon the
request of Senator Shandel.
Um, at a 2% increase on the
infrastructure fund.
And as a fellow land base.
community
people's
We
Went along with the request.
And what we realized man and
chair when we crossed over to
the Senate.
Is that the Senate has a long
standing tradition.
In equalizing.
tribal infrastructure fund and
colonial's infrastructure fund.
So the
The
Senators that have colonials
kind of came to us.
and asked if we could.
do what we're doing with the
amendment.
Which is keeping with the
tradition of the Senate in
keeping those two infrastructure
funds equal.
That's what the amendment does,
man.
Thank you. OK, so now quick.
Senator Townsend, anybody else?
Senator Townsend. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you.
Represented
We need with this amendment
raising.
Adding colonia
What has been the effect of the
FI.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh,
representative, uh, Townsend. So
the um
The
Inclusion of the of the First
Amendment with the tribal
infrastructure fund increasing
that to 2%. Um, that was a
approximately 34 million in
terms of additional, um,
capacity for bonding capacity
for that fund. So with this
amendment because it's just
gonna now be one and one, that
will remain the same, the 34
million will be the, the um
impact in terms of the uh
bonding capacity.
Madam Chair and
representative, the impact of
the colonists then is.
half of what it was, I mean, is
he a psych it's, it's has to be
less, how much less.
Um
Madam Chair, representative, or
Senator Townsend, um, it
actually increases it by 1%, so
it's um roughly 17 to 18
million, it'll increase,
correct.
So it will go from currently at
4.5%, um, to 5.5%.
sure. OK, ma'am, the thing I
was.
The Asia and the Clonias are fed
funds from more than one source.
What is a total amount?
that flows into
Either one or both of the
individually and and together.
And named the sources of the
income streams from different
ones, if you would please.
venture and Senator Townsend,
the, the colonials and um
Uh, Tai infrastructure funds
were established uh many years
ago, and they each have a 4.5%.
That they're getting in in the
bonding capacity.
Um, that's currently, so those
funds that were created, um,
they used to have, um, 5% and
then it was reduced to 4.5%.
In about 2015, and in that 4.5
um results in about $68 million.
That's what the tribal Fund and
the Colonial Fund gap.
Um, you ask for what the
executive sources are, um,
currently, there, there isn't um
a bonding capacity please for a
sec. So this creates a new
infrastructure fund, but the,
the other finding that it does
exist for a sec, is um the
seconddic infrastructure fund at
the Interstate Stream Commission
and that gets 2.5 million per
year from the irrigation works
construction fund, and that's
administered by the Asea Bureau.
Oh, madam chair and.
I um
The increase in this bill from
4.56.
is the $19 million.
Increase
that correct or was it 34, which
one is? There's a little
difference because the madam
chair and, and Senator Townsend,
the, the Asea.
But it's, that's what this bill
would create a new stream for
the seconds of 1.1% and for the
land grants of 1.1%, and each of
those generates approximately,
uh, you know, under the current
conditions, 19 million.
Um, so that's 1.1 each for a
total of 2.2.
Uh, the 1% generates about 15
million, we understood.
17th, 1715 to 17, so it's a
little less, so that's my 35,
the, the 2% ends up being 35,
the 2.2% ends up being 39.
More or less.
OK.
I'll just, and I need to read
that.
I want to come back, but I thank
you both very much.
And I also want to let the
committee know um this is going
on to finance after us.
So it's the next person, anybody
else prepared to talk to Senator
Scott.
And then Senator Cervantes.
OK.
Mountain term I'm looking at the
FIR.
And it looks like
Bonding capacity will take it
if, if.
If
So, and I don't know.
The effects of the amendment
bar.
home.
So, Madam Chair the
representatives and
And Hicks, what is the total?
Oh
Bond incapacity that will be
will be in effect.
With this amendment.
Doctor
In dollars, please.
OK
Madam chair and
Senator Scott
Um
The amendment
Basically, um, equalizes.
The bonding capacity.
For the tribal infrastructure
fund.
And
Colonia Infrastructure Fund.
Why
When the president is 4.5% and
we're upping that.
Oh
Uh, 5.5%.
Colonials
5.5%.
Tribal.
Based on the fact that when this
bill crossed over.
You all have a tradition of
keeping those infrastructure
funds equal.
So we accommodated negotiations
between.
Uh, I think the, the tribal
folks and the colonial folks.
In terms of coming to the
agreement that we have in the
Amendment.
Now, the other impact is the 1.1
that we're putting in for our
brand new.
a brand new infrastructure fund.
1.1 for the land grants.
So the impact on
The 1% increase from 45 to 5.5.
tribal and Colonnas.
combined is 38 million.
The impact or I mean is, is uh
38 million for Aseka and land
grants.
And 34 million.
Or tribal and
for a total of 72 million total
impact.
In terms of body capacity.
additional bonding capacity.
OK, and historically,
can you break that down for me
in terms of
Just strictly tribal
infrastructure.
And
Strictly.
35 million, OK.
Percy.
Please proceed.
Of
Adam Chair, uh, Senator Scott.
Um
In terms of the land grant
communities, there's never been
uh an infrastructure fund for
the land grants, so
historically, the way that um
projects are the attempts to
fund projects is through capital
outlay from individual
legislators and it's, it's never
enough to sort of complete a
full project, um, in terms of
the
tribal infrastructure fund. My
understanding is historically it
was uh at 5% and then it um was
increased to 6.5%, uh, and then
it was reduced to 4.5% in 2015.
Uh, and so this would uh
increase it, uh, to 5.5%, which
is uh less than what that sort
of last full increase that it
had received was.
Um, but in terms of the dollar
amounts for this bill, uh, it
for the
Tribal infrastructure fund, it
would be approximately 17
million, uh.
So, OK, so $17 million to
travel.
Let's get all the way through to
70 million.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, so
it would be uh 17 million for
the tribal infrastructure fund
in additional new funding 17
million for the colonia
Infrastructure Fund in
additional new funding.
Approximately 19 million for the
Aseka infrastructure fund and
approximately 19 million for the
And Grant.
said assistants or or uh
infrastructure fund.
OK.
And can you describe
give me a comparison.
With respect to those four
entities.
What that increase would be for
each one of those 4.
Madam Chair, uh, Senator Sky, I
think if I understand your
question correctly for
For the land grants, um, this
would be
The 19 million would be brand
new. Um, they've never received
any infrastructure fund
historically, so it would be
brand new um funding, um, first
time.
For the Aseass, uh, Madam Chair,
Senator Scott, the Aseass
currently um have access to the
fund that um Ms. Paula Garcia
described, which has
approximately 2.5 million in
this current year.
Um, so it would be the
additional, um, about $17.5
million.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
uh, and then in terms of the
the tribal and the colonial
infrastructure fund. I'm not
sure what the current fund
amount is at, I, I believe, um.
uh, 6, what I heard was 68
million um in this current year,
so it would be an additional 19
or 17 million in addition to
that 68.
in both of those points.
OK, that's, that's a lot of
money. Do we have
We have projects waiting on the
dollars.
is it
we, we're gonna be able to spend
that.
Efectively and efficiently.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, so,
uh, in terms of the land grant
and the secia funds, um.
There's a process in the bill
that there's gonna be some
little promulgations that has to
happen so it won't take effect
immediately. There'll probably
be like a year delay. Um, we do
currently for the land grants
have um uh
Over 19 million in funding, we
do have uh projects that lined
up, um.
In terms of uh needs as for the
sick kids as well, they have uh
projects in the tens of millions
of dollars, um, like the a
little bit probably more than
than this some amount, um.
allocates in this bill, uh, and
then my understanding is both
the tribal and the colonial
infrastructure Fund are always
um underfunded in terms of the
amount of need that's actually
out there for some of these
communities.
I'm sorry to interrupt, so we're
gonna
They'll recognize everybody, but
we're gonna try to
keep it moving quickly because
we're only on the amendment of
the very first bill.
Thank you.
OK, Madam Chair, that's, that's
all for me for now.
Let me digest.
Thank you, Senator Cervantes is
next.
Madam Chair, I'm sorry to have
joined you a little bit late,
but I assume somebody who's
already sponsored moved the
adoption of the amendment, Madam
Chair.
Oh, OK, good. And I don't know
who did that, whoever who did
it, thank you.
I was working with the others
who for a very long time it's
good to see you, Representative
Garcia. Um, Representative
Garcia has probably been the
longest one here, I think of
anyone, and he knows the history
of this, which is at the time we
enacted the tribal
infrastructure fund. We reached
the agreement as I'm sure you've
pointed out, representative,
that there would be parity at
all times with the colonia's
infrastructure fund and so the
purpose of this amendment quite
simply made sure it hasn't
already been explained. Forgive
me if I'm repeating, but this is
simply to assuring that
continuing parity.
tribal infrastructure fun and
colonial infrastructure fund and
that's been the, the agreement
reached for now decades, I guess
probably right representative
and, and I hear you supporting
that in my understanding is the
amendment so.
something constructive.
Current manager, and it was
Senator Leo Ramillo that
On the amendment. Oh good, well
I'll, I'll appreciate it. Thank
you, I won't go back over again
again. I'm sorry for joining
you.
OK. Anyone else before we vote
on the amendment, strictly the
amendment, yes, Senator
Thompson.
Just a quick question.
more
Educational me and not.
Are the two equal in the amount
of water rights that they have,
um.
Administered in both of the.
in the colonia.
You know,
Uh, Madam Chair and senator,
Senator Johnson.
Are you to Paula to kind of.
So.
Madam Chair and Senator
Townsend, if I understand
correctly, you're asking about
water rights and how they're
administered between Colombias
and I, I understand this as
well.
A
Long-standing tradition, my
question was.
Do the two have the same amount
of water rights.
Infrastructure to take care of.
Oh
So is it equal in application.
Uh, I understand. Thank you for
the question, uh, Madam Chair,
and Senator Townsend, uh, the
needs are, are somewhat
different because the colonials
fun.
Um, provide funding for a range
of of infrastructure priorities,
um, and so they're dealing with
mutual domestics, um, municipal.
Tony, of course, the, the
unincorporated communities
within counties. Uh, so the need
is, um, it's substantial. I'm
not an expert in those needs in
that part of the state, um, I
can speak to a second needs and
for a second it's, um, uh, first
seconds are statewide, so
they're, they're in 23 different
counties. There are 700 Osekis
and um the type of
infrastructure is uh limited in
scope compared to the colonials,
but the number and the volume
of.
and then the uh the seconds that
would need infrastructure
assistance is greater, um, and
so in terms of the, the initial
analysis done to identify needs
across the state. Uh, we've
looked at, um,
The ICIP priorities and uh for,
for just one year alone, the
ICIP totals were 40 40 million.
Um, we have an estimate on the
cost share that's required just
for the redoo disaster, the um
recent salt forks uh saltork
salt pork, sorry.
Um, South Park soft fire and
that the total disaster uh costs
for a second in that area was 80
million, but this we would
anticipate using state funds to
match 25% of that. So the
uh, the needs are, are
substantial. Oh madam chair.
Thank you, ma'am.
What is the um
pleasure of the Committee on the
amendment.
Mm
There's a motion for a do passes
through a second.
I second.
OK, there's a motion in the
second, could the secretary
please call the vote on the
amendment to House Bill 330.
Senator Cervantes,
Senator Charlie.
And yes, and.
And no, Senator Hamlin.
excuses, Senator Pope. Yes. And
a pope, yes, Senator Scott.
Scott, no, Senator Townsend.
Senator Townsend, yes, centers
Dia Lopez.
yes, yes, Santoponics, yes,
onics, yes.
By a vote of 6 in the
affirmative, 2 in the negative,
the amendment has been placed on
the, the bill. I was going to
the audience for support on the
bill. So I indicate most of the
room was in support. I indicated
I hear from two people in the
room, 2 people online, so if the
two people would line up,
please.
And let's give them a mic, uh,
here, he's coming with the mic.
Uh, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I'm Harold Trujillo,
president of the Mexicose
Association and also President
Aliyasekela Isla. I have over 15
years of experience trying to
get capital outlay for projects.
There was one project that took
me 10 years of requests to
finally get it complete.
I currently have a project I'm
trying to complete where I've
received something like 15,000,
10,000, 30,000 and uh it's just
really hard to complete this
project, you know, following the
current procedures that we have.
So I think this would be an
improvement to the capital like
process and actually get
projects completed more quickly
and in a proper way. I would
like to also point out that
these projects are sometimes
double and triple autos.
it
You know, cause uh you do have
to do an audit with 50% or when
you complete it, and then of
course, the agency that handles
this funding is also audited,
and this audits really the cost
of them has to be
Bad by the Asecas themselves and
for example, you could get a
$10,000 cap to O Lake project
and it probably would cost you
$2000 to audit it.
So it, it's a real difficult.
Process currently and I hope uh
that you can support this
projects. I would like to point
out that these communities are
the backbone to our rural
communities in the state. So I
would appreciate your support.
Thank you.
Committee chair, um, committee
members, my name's Athena
Christodoulou, and I'm a, I'm
actually a civil engineer by
training, and so this is, this
is amazing that you're finally
going to be paying attention and
engineering these projects so
that they will withstand the
future.
Oh, I'm sorry. OK, sorry. Um,
that, that we are bringing
forward the proper funds so that
they can be engineered and they
can be properly done because
it's going to be getting even
worse than what has happened in
the past because of climate
change and the climate crisis,
and I will point out this is an
indirect subsidy of the fossil
fuel industry, but I think this
is good. I am anticipating
though that this is going to be
falling well short of what was
going to be needed.
Sorry, thank you, thank you very
much. Go to the um
Uh
Internet, uh, we have, uh, Brian
Martinez, let's take first.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, um, uh, committee. My name
is Brian Martinez. I am the, uh,
Vice chair of the Rio Camado Rio
Frijoles, Rio and Medio, Rio
Santa Cruz Community Ditch
Association representing 66 the
seques and the Santa Cruz Basin.
I'm also the secretary of the
Santa Cruz de la Cannada land
grant, and I stand in support of
the bill.
Thank you. Thank you very much
and um
Let's have
Whoever Mced del Pueblo is.
Please introduce yourself and go
ahead.
You might have your mute button
on.
OK, moving on, uh, we'll have
Anna Hansen, and that's it for
the uh
them
Um,
good morning, Madam Chair. Um,
and committee members, I hope
you can hear me. Um, I am the
registered lobbyist, um, for the
Pueblo of Paake, and I apologize
for not being in person, but I
have got the roundhouse crud,
um,
So we are a stand in support of
this, the Pueblorauake, uh, we
encourage you all to vote a due
path, and thank you for allowing
me to speak. It is important to
increase the fund for the tribal
infrastructure. Every time it is
completely spent Pawaki itself
has at the moment over $14
million in requests for capital
outlay. So, um, like there are
23 tribes and
across New Mexico who need this
funding, so please give this a
due pass.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. OK, we are
now on the bill committee.
Uh, any discussion, comments on
this bill, Senator Scott.
Oh, madam chair.
of course they uh are these
trouble infrastructure funds.
Mm
Early dedicated to water
projects, or can they do?
What
Uh, manager and representative
Scott, I'm not.
Really immersed in terms of the
specifics of the tribal
infrastructure fund, but it's
across the board needs.
Ah
And uh
You know, and those entail.
Pretty much what the some of the
land grant needs are.
In terms of kind of new fire
stations, uh, wastewater
systems, potable water systems.
Um, early childhood facilities,
um.
Uh, infrastructure for housing
projects. I don't know if you've
seen San Palipo Pueblo. They got
an outstanding housing project
going on there, uh, drainage.
Or a road systems and
Uh, asphalt overlay for the
existing dirt roads.
Community center facilities and
I know that uh land grants just
like, like uh pueblos. We have
traditional plazas.
In fact, we have an outstanding
class of manager there and uh.
In Santa Cruz de la Canna and
Chimayo Valley.
that
Just 300 years old and needs
renovation.
So those are just some things
that kind of cross over in terms
of Pueblos and land grants, Mr.
Chaff, a man.
under her spot.
OK, so, Madam Chair, rep the
pretty much any infrastructure
needs.
might come up
Within
Boland grants.
And
infrastructure would be.
Unable expenditure for these
projects. That's correct, Madam
Chair.
Yeah
Mountain Chato to the various
entities.
have to have any skin in the
game is that.
Is there any requirement that
these funds be matched or
partially.
partially matched or
And they, and they go out
without any.
A local support.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
these are shovel-ready projects.
That's standalone.
And whatever matching comes
around is what other entities
are willing to pitch in.
But these are
Shovel-ready projects, man.
That are ready to go
based on that bonding capacity
that the different
infrastructure funds will be
getting off the sale of those
bonds.
Another shovel ready just based
on
Total amount coming from that
bonding capacity.
Those funds that are coming off
the sale of the severance tax
bonds.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you. Anything else on the
bill?
A amend a bill, Senator.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much, Representative Garciaduja.
Questions
Ah, let's see.
In any way, shape, or form can
any this money since it has been
abandoned, would we be in
violation of the anti-donation
restrictions.
Man
And senator is out.
We're talking about
Units of government here.
I'm sorry. We're talking about
units of government.
Aseas are political subdivisions
of the state.
Uh, entitled to
Seeking
Capital outlay funds from the
state legislature because of
their status as a unit of
government.
Land grant's manager as of.
Even though there are hundreds
of years old.
As of
20 as of 2004 were granted
political subdivision status. So
these are government to
government.
entities or
Government to government in
terms of the bonding capacity.
That is being
Revenues being generated by the
sale of a severance tax bonds
that are going for a
governmental entity.
In this case, the land grants
and the Aseki's manager.
There is no violation of the
anti-donation.
Madam Chair in.
Representative, I guess my.
I just don't want there to be
any violation.
There's
Anyway, I'm gonna leave it alone
like that. You're at because we
have this adopted the amendment.
I do have a question regarding
the colonius, and land grants.
And are we, how are we going to
be insured in a may assist of
Miss Garcia.
Uh, how are we going to ensure
that Rick can keeping is
appropriate for all three of
these entities.
So that the
Audit standards can be met.
Madame Chair and Senator.
The Asea funds would be
administered through the Asseki
Bureau of the Interstate Stream
Commission. Uh, they have a, a
long standing azeki construction
program, um, in recent years,
they formalized the bureau and
increased their staff.
Uh, they currently uh administer
capital outlay projects, as well
as the Asse and community ditch
infrastructure fund. Uh, they
have, uh, vigorous policies
around the management of these
funds, uh, they require that um
aseki have uh follow all the
procedures for, for expenditure
of capital outlaying, um, in
addition to that, it likes are
required to um be in financial
compliance with the requirements
of the state auditor's office,
um, for the, the
I
Me and uh Senator, I'd like to
yield to Arturo to reflect on
the land grant.
Madam Chair, Senator Isel, the,
um, and the land grants, uh,
likewise, the, the council
actually now provides land
grants, uh, technical support
with completion of not only
their uh audits on an annual
basis. We also provide them
support with their budgeting,
um, in recent years we've been
able to pull um I think.
18 of the 27 land grants are
currently using uh QuickBooks
online system and we have a
staff member that provides them
support to ensure they're able
to manage their finances within
that system and make it simpler
for them to then be able to turn
those over uh when it comes time
to do their auditing and so we
are providing that support and
um we also have some land grants
that uh
higher um bookkeepers, uh,
either through a contract or
they have a staff person on and
that works as an administrator
to uh to keep on top of those
things as well, and we provide
some direct support to it.
Uh, and then Madam Chair, uh,
senator, we also have uh land
grants of secs, all the entities
are subject to the audit act,
um, also subject to inspection
of Public Records Act, subject
to Open Meetings Act, so they
are like any other unit of
government, uh, and so there is
a transparency as well as
accountability built into those
processes.
Madam Chair, thank you very much
for that explanation right
there.
Oh, Madam chair.
And Representative Miss Garcia,
I, I do have a question.
Tell me, can you tell me the
entities where the assa which
entities.
Help a psyche is with.
The needs that they, they are
expressing.
I know that the New Mexico
irrigation works construction
fund is part of a.
What else?
Um, uh, Madam Chair and Senator
so the, the only fund currently
is the one that you mentioned.
It's the I see yeah, yeah, it's
funded through the irrigation
works construction fund, the
primary source of uh assistance
is the interstate stream
commission, um, and their staff
of the execute bureau, um, the
New Mexicote Association, which
is the entity that uh that I
represent also provides
technical assistance to a with
funding applications.
OK, Madam Chair and Miss Garcia,
can you tell me how much money
the psych you do receive from
the irrigation works
construction.
Madam Chair and and uh 2
senator, the irrigation works
construction fund, uh.
Uh, provides 2.5 million per
year to the community
infrastructure fund at the ISC.
OK, and who does manage that
money py Miss Garcia, Madam
Chair represents all of the
Inner Cream Commission of Thank
you Bureau. OK, that brings me
to my next question according to
what I've been reading about all
this Interstate mission
going through the state
engineer's office, State
Engineer's office has reported
that they will need to hire 4
new full-time employees. Does
that sound about right, Madam
Chair, Miss Garcia?
Madam Chair, uh, senators,
that's in the empire.
That's correct.
And DFA is also reporting they
will need 2 to hire 2 full of.
Or need 2 full-time employees to
Uh, administer all this. Are you
in agreeance with that?
Meal representative senator
that's uh that's what they've
indicated in the FIR and 11
thing that's important about the
ISC is that the ACTIF can be
used for our staff.
OK, madam chair, Miss Garcia.
I note that the state auditor
has raised some concerns about
what could be small local
governments will able to be in
compliance with the audits.
Do you have a concern there?
Madam Chair, Senator Russo, we
were very um closely with the
seconds to ensure that they're
uh achieving financial
compliance.
The the way that the ISC program
works is that the cyclists have
to be in compliance before they
apply for funding, and the the
the office of the state auditor
has a program where they're
helping to um provide assistance
to a second that uh can't afford
to do their own audits, uh, but
we're very committed to ensuring
that they, they stay in
compliance and uh there's a, a,
an effort, collaborative effort
across different agencies to
make sure that are compliant and
they
are required to be compliant
before they can apply. They,
they will not be eligible for
the funds unless they are
compliant.
Madam Chair and Miss Garcia
representative Miss Garcia, I
appreciate that, but you also
stated earlier that there were
over 700 assaks. Is that
correct? I would just want to
make sure.
Madam Chair, Senator, that's
correct. How many colonists
would be involved in this, Madam
Chair and Miss Garcia.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator, I'm
not familiar with the number of
colonials. OK,
madam representative,
you know the answer to that? Uh,
Madam Chair, uh, and Senator,
I'm not.
I'm not real uh uh clear in
terms of the specific amount.
All right, I was just kind of
curious and, and if, if
Since we have amended the bill
since colonius are now added
down to that.
Oh, I know that they're
Are not all that many colonists.
But who would be overseeing the
money that does go to.
Madam Chair, Arturo.
can respond to that.
Thank you.
In terms of the I'm sorry, Madam
Chair and Senator, we're not
real familiar with the the
colonial's infrastructure fund
in terms of the internal.
Uh, the
are dealings.
Uh, so we're, we don't have
real.
I see if you can kind of
OK. Thank you. Um, I didn't
share senators out and
unfortunately, I'm, I'm not
familiar with um how those work.
I know that the colonial
infrastructures fund has a uh
infrastructure board that awards
the projects, um, because a lot
of the colonials are
unincorporated areas, uh, my, my
assumption is that it may go
through some of the local
governments such as the
counties, um, or maybe
municipalities that have
adjacent colonials, um, in order
to utilize those funds, but I,
I'm not familiar enough to be
able to explain it.
how that process works.
OK, so, madam chair and
Representative and your expert
witnesses there, and you may not
be able to answer this one
either. I know that uh.
The project falls under the
colonists infrastructure. I do
know that.
But whenever you're asking for
this.
sum of money it's like fun.
Oh
Who makes the decision on how I
know that.
The Asay Association.
Made their requests for the 700
psychias, I'm assuming, I'm
assuming that whenever that
request was made that includes
all 700 of those safely that
correct.
Madam Chair. Madam Chair,
Senators, 700 exist, but the
only seconds that would receive
funding are those that would
apply for the program.
OK, so, madam too, that brings
me to another question then how
were they notified that they do
have to make application and how
were they to know?
If they are going to be eligible
to receive for the sake of
association.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator.
We would conduct outreach, um.
The New Mexicote Association has
a list of over 600 Asekis that
would would receive information
about this programs. Um, the
information is also posted
publicly on the ISC website and
that information is readily
available to to a seconds across
the state.
Madam Chair
Once your request for the sa
association is taken out of the
picture right here.
How is the money going to be
split up between the tas and the
colonials.
I mean, not the, not the
colonists and the psychists, the
uh.
The tribal entities of the
colonies.
Madam Chair and senator,
the, the tribal infrastructure
fund already exists, and they're
currently getting 4.5% of the
tax bond capacity in the
colonials similarly.
Uh, so they're, they're being,
they're operated by existing
programs, the colonia's
Infrastructure Fund has a board
and the tribal infrastructure
Fund has its own board. They
make the decisions on their, on,
on their respective funds, and
this bill would create a new
fund for Ezekis and a new fund
for migrants with 1.1%.
Each
Me and the senator result,
the colonial infrastructure Fund
has been in existence since
2010. The tribal infrastructure
has been in existence since
2005.
And the water trust fund has
been in existence since 2001.
These are the
The existing infrastructure
funds that are in the bonding
capacity scheme of things.
And with this House Bill 330,
we're just adding brand new
the Asea and the land grant
infrastructure funds.
And then, I appreciate that
representative Garcia.
Senator, could you wrap up? I
have a couple more people on the
list.
I'm through.
Thank you, Senator Charlie and
then Senator Townsend.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, and
you representative.
Uh
With you, could you give us a
little bit of history here where
the land grounds, the particular
to the grass that they exist
before New Mexico became a
state.
Madam Chair, um,
Uh, and Senator Charlie.
The land grants, um,
We developed uh in terms of a
land tenure structure.
After the Pueblo revolt.
Uh
And uh before the Pueblo revolt,
the land tenure structure in New
Mexico.
Under the Spanish was very
oppressive.
It operated under an encomienda
system.
In a repartamento system.
That counted on Indian labor.
Kind of uh
produce
Agricultural products for the
most part.
And forced labor
And what happened after the Feb
revolt is that the Spanish
colony created a brand new land
tenure structure.
called the Spanish land grant.
that was based on communal
ownership.
And democratic processes in
terms of
Uh
Making determination in terms of
how that acreage of these land
grants was to be utilized and,
and for what purposes do their
specific errors.
So land grants were created, the
first one in 1692, and for their
from then on followed.
hundreds of other land grants.
Of which we still have today.
Uh, we have
28 as of this legislature.
will have 28 units of government
that are land grants.
We still have 6 land grants that
are outside the loop of a
political unit of government.
And, uh, but yes.
We are in existence long before
1776, Madam chair.
Madam chair and representative,
thank you. I appreciate that and
I think it's important for those
of us who maybe don't
understand,
um.
The, the structures that existed
before.
The state became a state.
And, and, and our state
obligation to those communities
as stewards of the land.
Of the water. Um, so, Madam
Chair, what is the state's
obligation or.
Muslim.
In the communities you're hurt.
Oh
OK.
Um, Madam Chair, what is the
relationship between the state,
um, in terms of obligation to
our land grant or Athea.
I.
Madam Chair, uh, Senator, thank
you for the question. Um,
I think that it's actually
evolved, um, over time, um,
initially, I think for Seas were
actually recognized by the state
as political subdivisions in the
1950s.
65.
Um, and then land grants were
recognized in 2004, uh, prior to
that, for the language
communities anyway, there was uh
the actual um
Supports or obligations that the
state had um weren't really
there. It was actually uh
partially at the state that had
actually taxed the common lands
in these communities that had
not privately previously been
taxed on those that were
successful at being able to
actually adjudicate lands
through the federal process, um,
and that was the cause of a loss
of a lot of the common lands was
seizure for delinquent taxes uh
for these communities that had
land but didn't have um a system
of paying taxes that we prior um
and then in 2004 with the
unvent.
Of recognizing land grants
divisions, um, they became, uh,
the state has increased its uh.
ability to support land grants
as political subdivisions of the
state and provide them with
resources in order to invest in
those communities and overall
benefit the state.
You know, the longer everybody
talks, the less you're gonna
have people here to vote.
So keep that in mind.
We're at a quorum right now. We
lose one more person, you won't
have a bump.
Madam Cha center uh
representative, uh, I, I
appreciate that history, and
it's important for, for us as
legislatures and the states to
fulfill those obligations to our
rural communities. More often
than not.
Those of us up here are talking
about investing in our rural
community.
Um, we're up here solving the
problems of Albuquerque, but the
truth is,
These systems of government,
land grants, tribal
infrastructure that are all
different. They're not the same
thing. Um, there are a way to
invest in rural New Mexico, and
invest in the people who care
for the land, who care for the
water, who care for our natural
resources and so I'm proud to
support this. I have 2 land
grants in my district, Cobero
and Seboea. I spent a lot of
time in those communities
growing up and um and understand
that the people that are
That make up those communities,
um, are, are the part of the
backbone.
honored to support this chair,
you um you
People advocating for deserve
this, this funding, um.
Thank you, manager.
Thank you, Senator Townsend.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
A representative.
if somebody, what was the saca
available dollars to a stakes.
Last year
Or funding
Man Senator Townsend.
In terms of of capital outlay
asse uh received about $7
million.
Um, and that came from
individual legislators, the, the
irrigation works construction
fund made uh made available $2.5
million to the Interstate
remission, and there was a
special appropriation of $5
million to the Interstate stream
commission.
So that would, that would total
about $14 million.
OK. And if I'm looking at this,
Madam Chair, you have about $6
million of projects queued up.
Is that correct on the FIR.
Madam Cher, I'd have to.
Um, see where that's located on
the FIR on, on the last page of
the FIR on the back on the back
sheet.
English, right?
says there's $5.925 million.
925 on the last page.
Oh, I can, I can explain that.
Um, Madam Chair and Senator
Townsend in the, the page that
you're referring to as part of
the stream commission work plan,
and the interstate stream
commission combined.
Funding from the irrigation
works construction Fund, which
was the 2.5 million plus part of
the 5 million and that's where
the 5.95 million came from.
So they, they didn't use all of
the special appropriation, uh,
in this work plan, um, but they,
they used the combination of the
two.
So my point that I chairs I'm
trying to figure out, are we
going from
789.
to 18 million, is that the bump
that we're taking in in
available funding to affect.
In this bill.
Madam, senator, it would
increase that by that amount.
That's, that's correct.
OK.
Madam chair.
Um
Representative Pollock, uh,
Our historic preservation
dollars also.
Used out of this sun to.
To preserve any of the existing.
Historic facilities that
That uh
Representative Garcia has
mentioned.
Uh, Madam Chair, in, in
restoring and Senator Townsend
and restoring his second as it's
a, it's a form of historic
preservation, but it's not
necessarily formally a historic
preservation project in, in
accord and as defined say by the
state historic Preservation
Office, but there we are
restoring historic structures
that in some cases are hundreds
of years old and, and, in many
cases they haven't been upgraded
since, uh, for, for over 50
years and madam chair and
representative in the case of
those restorations, are they?
Do they go through the chipo and
are they?
qualified in their
The ro constructs them in their.
Reconfiguration.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator,
Senator Townsend, when there is
a requirement to go through
Shipo, uh, they do follow the
Shier rules.
But they don't, they don't don't
necessarily have to go through
shipping.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Pauly. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Pope.
Madam Char I move a do pass on
House Bill 3:30 at Eton.
There's a motion in a second,
because the secretary of police
call the boat.
Yes, I'm sorry.
OK, we'll take center's question
before we go to the vote.
Madam Cheer and representative
from Paula.
How many of the psychias have
been adjudicated.
Madam Chair and Senator, um, out
Hundreds of them have perhaps 40
500 of them have gone through
adjudication or in some phase of
an adjudication, not necessarily
a final decree, in some cases
it's a partial final decree.
OK, so Madam Chair, I guess my
concern there is.
With the
sit up around 500 of them have
been.
Um, 500
have to get back to you on an
exact number, but it's, it's um
I, I would estimate that more
than half of them have been
adjudicated.
OK, and so, Madam Chair.
What we're seeing then is with
the
engineer's office saying they're
gonna need more full-time
employees because I know one of
their
Goals is to get the entire.
Everybody's water rights and
adjudicate so I'm assuming that.
In addition to helping with the
administrative part of it.
That they would also be working
on getting the rest of those.
Adjudicator.
Madame Chair and Senator, the
Office of the State Engineer
handles adjudication, and they
are working diligently on that,
and the interstate commission
operates separately in terms
especially of this
infrastructure program.
And
I'll just leave them.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Mm
Very quick, Senator.
Who's taking the hit?
Madam Chair
course.
from the servants to work the
money coming out of that
severance tax bonding.
is going to be reduced, who is
taking the reduction.
uh
Uh
I don't know if, if it's
considered a hit.
Mainly because the estimation.
Uh, the calculation that the
State Board of Finance, um,
Calculates in terms of the the
uh.
In terms of the body capacity.
To the infrastructure funds and
to local projects.
I kind of volatile.
So maybe in an off year.
Uh, we might get less capital
outlay.
But in other years, we might get
the same or more.
in the preceding year than the
prior year.
So I don't, I don't see this as
kind of a hip-like thing because
of the volatility of.
The price of oil and gas that
makes basically the
determination in terms of what
that bonding capacity will be.
You said one question.
We need, we need to go to the
vote, please, regardless of how
you vote, we need to go to the
vote. Thank you, madam. Thank
you. Would the secretary please
call the vote.
Cervantesvanti, yes, Senator
Charlie. Senator Charlie, yes,
Senzel.
I know Senator Halin is excused
Senator Pope. Yes. Pope, yes,
and Scott.
Scott, no, Senator Townsend.
Townsend no, Senator Dia Lopez
is excused Senator Stephonics.
Yes, there's the bars, yes.
Uh, before I call the vote, uh,
this bill looks like a bypassed
house appropriations.
And it is going to set up
finance, but there is a major
fiscal implication here.
So, um, it'll be interesting to
see what finance says about it.
a boat of 4 in the affirmative,
3 in the negative, you have a
due pass. Thank you very much.
Madam Chair.
On your point, um, again, I
support this initiative and it
benefits a lot of people in my
district and want to see its
support, but are you suggesting
that it appropriately should be
reviewed by finance, or you're
not willing to go?
It's uh they're going next to
financing
and they did not have finance in
the house. Ah, OK, I understand
what you're saying that's what
I'm saying. Thank you, thank
you.
I'm still uh waking up I guess.
And
No, thanks. I was busy yesterday
on the floor a little bit.
And the day before, I think I've
done 2 days in a row with about
3 or 4 hours, so.
Um, Senator Steinborn is in um
finance Senator Sua Lopez was
gonna put his bill on, so she is
presenting a bill somewhere
else, so we're going on to
representative Herrera.
Would you and your experts
please come forward.
This is the strategic water
supply Act.
Ha.
OK.
Good morning. Good morning. So
as you can see, we took about 1
hour and 10 minutes on the last
one. And I know that um
Uh, people are very interested
in what this bill has to say. We
did have a little orientation.
The cleaning brackish water this
past Tuesday. So everybody's
familiar with the process. So,
please go ahead.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh, good
to be here, um, thank you,
members of the committee.
Um, there is no snow in the
mountains. I continue to remind
members of this body that this
is one of the greatest dangers
confronting our state. In the
north, we look to the Hammes
Mountains to the west. We looked
to the sunre de Cristo Mountains
to the east and the north.
And uh at this time of year,
It's not about skiing.
It's about the survival of uh
agriculture and flowing streams
and rivers in the spring and the
summers. Was that nourish our
crops and provide a living for
our farmers and ranchers in the
long hot summer months ahead.
It's about drinking water, Madam
Chair.
It's about wells drying up and
I'll just say for my own
personal experience. We had
water at 20 ft for 30 years, and
right before COVID, our well
went dry.
Um, I just want to tell you
that, uh, we had to haul water,
my hus my husband and I actually
it was my husband, not me, for a
year and a half before we could
get a driller out there. Uh, the
cost of drilling a well, we had
to go down to 200 ft, uh, was
30,000. I can tell you that most
people in my district, and I
don't think most people in New
Mexico can afford that kind of
hit.
Henria Riba
According to the USDA annual
report, we have about 1.4
million acres of farming and
ranching that provides about 15
million to our local economy.
In the north, Madam Madam Chair,
our wells are drying up. The
watersheds and forests have no
rain, and the drought has
created a dangerous scenario for
water, for wildfires.
We have heard several bills
about water, wildfire protection
zones and buffers, many
legislators have worked with
state agencies over the interim
to protect water resources, and
this is one of those bills.
We as a state collectively are
going to have to guard and use
water resources in the most
effective way possible. We're
going to have to use new
technologies to strengthen our
freshwater reserves.
In the coming years, we will
have 25% less water in New
Mexico.
Um, Madam Chair, has be 137, the
strategic water supply helps New
Mexico on a new path for the
future. It basically does 5
things. We took out all the
produced water in this bill that
did not, and that was taken out
before we went to energy and and
and um that was the number one
important part of the bill. #2,
it gives a clear definition of
brackish water and allows for
$40 million to help local
communities create.
water treatment facilities for
much needed water resources in
their communities. 3, it
provides the New Mexico text uh
Department of Mineral uh
geology,
19 million is steady and monitor
the aquifers in our state and
just so the, the members
understand, uh, this, the annual
recurring money for that fund
for the aquifer studies used to
be $600,000 a year.
It also gives enemy 4 million to
do research on brackish water
and systems used to refine a
brackish water resources and um
the 5th part, it provides public
disclosure, public comment, and
public protests when these
whales are proposed in their
communities and with that, Madam
Chair, I would like to introduce
my uh expert and I should have
began with that. I'm sorry,
Tanya, Tanya Trujillo is, uh,
the deputy uh secretary
engineer.
And uh with that I sound
questions, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Um, I just wanted to
point out, if anybody, uh, any
sponsors are here.
We are happy to text you, uh,
when your time comes up if you
don't want to sit through the
whole thing, because this might
be an hour or so.
The last bill was an hour and 10
minutes.
OK, Tanya, um,
Our deputy state engineer, would
you like to say a few words? Oh,
yes, ma'am. Thank you, Madam
Chair, and I am looking forward
to the state engineer being here
in just a few minutes, she's
running, there she is and
Rebecca Rus. So we are here to
answer your questions as you
noted, we had a excellent
information session on Tuesday
where we heard from uh experts
on the availability of brackets
and the treatment process. So
we're happy to follow up with
any questions, but look forward.
to explaining how this fits into
the suite of actions that we're
working on, including
Planning projects, water
conservation projects, water.
Quality projects and um a whole
suite of things that we need to
do to take care of our resources
as uh Representative Herrera
commented on from the start.
Thank you.
Thank you. How many people in
the audience are here to support
this bill.
1234.
How many people are here to
oppose this bill.
1234.
How many people on, OK, online,
we have 2 people in support and
one against.
So let's have the 4 supporters
stand up to speak, and then
we'll go to the uh online and
then we'll do this opposition.
And let's keep it to a minute
apiece, please.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Marla Shoz registered
lobbies for the
Albuquerque-Burnelio County
Water Utility Authority. We
stand in strong support of this
collaboration and appreciate all
the work that the sponsor in the
office of the state engineer
have done on this. Uh, this bill
makes available new water
supplies to open up
opportunities for industry and
economic development in New
Mexico.un would benefit from
diversified water resources
supported by brackish water,
particularly in times of
drought. The strategic
water supply is an important
part of the governor's forward
thinking 50-year water action
plan in preparing New Mexico for
a hotter, drier future. Thank
you.
Thank you. Next, please.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, uh, Debbie Hughes,
executive director with the New
Mexico Association of Soil and
Water Districts, and we strong
stand in strong support, um, the
state has got to uh get uh the
technology that we need, we've
got to start uh using bracket
water and we're gonna run out of
the of the potable water, and so
this program is very important
and we're happy to support it.
Thank you.
Thank you. Next, please.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, good morning, John
Thompson, registered lobbyist
for the Rio Grande Conservancy
District. I think Ms. Sho said
it very well. Uh, anything we
can do to alleviate pressure on
surface water, particularly for
industrial purposes in the
Middle valley, we support, we
ask that you support the
legislation. Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you. And was there, uh,
secretary, did you want to say
anything?
Madam chair, uh, just, you know,
to everything that was said, Jim
Kenney Environment secretary,
and ditto to everything that was
said by the other presenters and
uh this fine panel will make all
the important points. Thank you.
Thank you. Online, let's hear
from John D'Antonio.
You need to unmute, John.
And you, um, Madam Chair, can
you hear me? Yes, we can.
Thank you, uh, members of the
committee. My name is John
D'Antonio, former state engineer
for New Mexico for 12 years, uh,
former secretary of the New
Mexico Environment Department
and currently president of New
Mexico DA, um, I want to stress
the support for House Bill 137.
It's uh, it's critical for New
Mexico to put that in place. You
know, we've got good water in
upper aquifers that's gradually
being replaced with water of
higher total dissolved solids
and just want to stress the
point that there's
the testing that's done before
full-scale projects are in
place, uh, typically evaporative
ponds are used where, where
there's a groundwater discharge
permit by the New Mexico
Environment Department surface
water quality Bureau and the
deep ra aquifers if they're
attained, there's, there's
provisions in there for the
state engine engineer's office
to stay involved in monitoring
the quantity and quality of
water that's uh done on a
quarterly basis, so I urge your
support uh for this uh
legislation. Thank you.
Thank you and uh Arthur
Eichwald.
In support
Yes, I'm in support, uh, as a
native Cubano, uh, I see that,
that, uh, this, this bill would
help the the village of Cuba,
New Mexico, uh, as they have run
out of their water supply, their
water supply is totally
brackish, and it needs to be
fixed, and um it will help with
growth in that area as Cuba is
kind of dying.
Uh, I, I think that this would
be a, a great incentive and also
it would produce uh
Uh
Opportunities to to um to help
the the the village of Cuba.
Thank you very much. So I'm
gonna go to the opponent online
but in the room, I'll take 4
opponents to line up.
To speak
And be ready as soon as we
finish online. Alejandria Lyons.
Online against.
Please go ahead, Alejandria.
Thank you, chair, members of the
committee. My name is Alejandria
Lyons and I represent the New
Mexico no false Solutions
Coalition. Um, we've been
against 137 since it had
produced water, but we still
stand in firm opposition with
the continued proposition to try
to use brackish water and
desalination to fix our drought,
um.
In house energy, you know, there
was a comment that there was a
lot of young people, um, we do
represent a lot of young people,
but multigenerationally.
Um, I am come from an Osea
community down in Peralta. We
are part of the Middle Rio
Grande Conservancy District, and
we fully understand drought, but
we also understand that going
and harvesting produced or this
brackish water, this ancient
seawater is not going to resolve
our issues. We need to address
our climate change issues at the
heart of the issue.
And we know why we have drought,
and we cannot ignore the fact
that the governor's 50 year
water plan strategically came
out after she was in Dubai, and
we, we note this because our
coalition has been in strong
opposition against the hydrogen
economy and for a long time,
this has been the, the way to
try to get water availability
and we are in opposition because
context matters, and we hope
that people look at the context
of how this bill is being
brought, we
understand that Snowpack has
been low. It's been low my
entire lifetime and we keep
getting our water cut off down
in the middle of Rio Grande, and
I feel like this is an issue um
that we are trying to use
agriculture and our cultural
needs as a way to pull in the
Trojan horse that is brackish
water. That is water that
belongs to the public. We should
not be using and harvesting this
sort of water to try to address
issues that are systemic issues
of our climate, our
economy and all that encompasses
that. So please protect our
waters, um, and please protect
our soils because the other
thing is, is that this requires
desalination. We have a lot of
questions about what we're gonna
do with the waste used from
desalination. Thank you very
much.
We appreciate you being on. OK,
going to the 4 in the room,
please go ahead, Norm.
Thank you, ma'am, uh, Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
I'm Norm Com. I'm a retired
licensed water engineer. I've
spent my career on the Mexico
water.
I was born and raised a rural
New Mexican grandson of two New
Mexican subsistence families.
That ranched, farmed, and
prospect. If this bill were part
of an all do everything we can.
Um, approach, I would support
it.
But it's not. It's coming at the
expense of rural New Mexico.
This bill and this legislature
will not help r New Mexicans.
Dirty water salvaged for a few
has been favored.
No funds
0
Are in the budget to prevent a
little Rio Grande compact
delivery violation that's
pending.
There's no funding for regions
to do regional water planning.
There's insufficient investment
in state engineer water data,
and these are chronic problems.
Madam Chair and members.
I think you're making a big
mistake funding a 1 or 2%
solution.
While you neglect the basics.
Of water governance.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Marion Lanassi and I represent
New Energy economy.
Um, there are 3 outstanding
problems with this bill, and
these are the amendments that
are needed. The brackish water
desalination plants are hugely
energy intensive. Proponents of
the strategic water supply have
opined that natural gas plants
should be employed to power
these projects. A pro a prospect
that could result in significant
increases in climate warming
emissions. Amendments needed
include to only power.
these plants with renewables and
battery storage. Another
amendment that's needed, the
brackish water desalination
plants are hugely expensive.
Amendment needed to include
economic feasibility study
before construction before
construction to demonstrate
whether a plant is
cost-effective compared to other
feasible alternatives. Third,
the brackish water desal plants
create highly toxic toxic resi
residual waste. What
will happen to that waste? How
will the residual waste be
transported, handled, disposed
of, who oversees that? Will it
be disposed of in a hazardous
waste site near you or me is is
proper disposal and
environmental justice concern.
Please vote no on HB 137. Thank
you.
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Sharon
Argen Bright. I'm a registered
nurse, Masters of Science
prepared.
Retired Air Force nurse Corps
officer, please consider all the
sources of water before New
Mexico goes to deep brackish
water aquifers. This should be
studied before investing good
money after bad. Please consider
ways New Mexicans are already
reclaiming and recycling in a
less aggressive, less expensive
way.
I'm on a well at my house.
The water comes into my home. It
returns to my septic tank, and
then it's processed in a aerator
called a multi-flow.
This water is used a second time
when pumped from a 1000 gallon
holding tank, I use it to water
my trees. I use my water twice.
I plant trees to cool the earth
and suck up CO2. I know how
serious our water scarcity is.
I've lost over 300 pinon trees.
I do all I can to combat the
effects of climate change, and
I'm asking you to do the same.
Please vote no on HB 137.
Thank you, and there was no one
else to round it out before.
OK, uh thank you very much.
Committee members, questions,
comments.
Senator Townsend
chairs
Representative, good to see you,
um.
We've heard.
Points of view this morning.
But
What other alternatives do we
have?
Logically
Try to address.
The shortage that you
You said that we got, we argue
about that for an hour or two,
but
I mean
What other choices do we have?
of chair in Senator Townsend. I
I, I think we had to use every
resource we have in this state
and, and, uh, but I would, I
would like to defer to my
experts. We have Rebecca Rus who
is with the uh in charge of
infrastructure programs with the
Office of the Governor, as well
as our newly designated first
women state engineer. Thank you,
senators. Uh, uh, heading the,
uh, state engineer's office.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, um,
good morning, uh, Senator
Townsend. Uh, there's
yes. Thank you. um
Yes, madam chair, absolutely.
Rebecca Roo, infrastructure
advisor in the office of the
governor, and, uh, Senator
Townsend, your question about
what other choices do we have,
what other options do we have
is, is an excellent one, they
need for us to move forward on
brackish water treatment and use
in the state is uh in, in our
view, a critical piece of a
complex puzzle, um, it's ready
to go. The technology is there
where we have.
The data, um, we have
communities that are ready to
make use of that technology,
like Cuba, who we heard from
this morning. Um, and that's in
addition to the work we need to
be doing to increase recharge of
our aquifers. It is in addition
to work that we need to be doing
to increase um smart and
sustainable reuse of treated
wastewater. Um, it's, it, it's
in addition to investments in
our water infrastructure that
will save water that is
currently being.
Um, all of these things are part
of the puzzle and this bill in
front of you is um specifically
targeted at moving us forward as
a state on brackish water
treatment. Thank you.
Madam Chair and Mr. Ridge.
Representative
Um
Are there provisions?
With
process, not necessarily
designed but within the process
of reclamation of
brackish water.
view.
about it
provisions in that process to
ensure public safety.
There certainly are both in
terms of water quality. Oh.
Madam Chair, Senator Townsend,
thank you. There, um, my name is
Elizabeth Anderson. I'm the
state engineer. Um, there are
definitely provisions for
protecting public safety, um, I
can speak to the water quantity
aspects of that, we look at the
impairment or potential
impairment to other water rights
and um and make sure that the,
the waters that's going to be
used or proposed to be used for
brackish development would not
impair, and if there
an impairment found and there
would be conditions placed on
the permit, there would be, um,
if it was an impairment against
the surface water body, there
would be uh requirements for
offsets.
Madam chair and uh state
engineer.
I noticed that the
This, um, impact of this has
been
Zeroed out because it lost
funding.
Can you speak to that a little
bit and, and
where we go from here without
funding.
Um, um.
Madam Chair and uh Senator
Townsend, you should know this
money is already included in
House Bill 2, and it was
reported out of the uh house
with $40 million to do the um uh
to help communities do brackish
water systems, we had 190
million for the aquifer mapping,
and we had 4 million for ESU to
do more study on brackish water
treatment and systems. So, so
you had a all of that uh was is
in house bill.
And you should know, uh, my, um,
uh, the lead sponsor on this is
Senator Munoz. He couldn't make
it this morning, so I'm
presenting this bill, but, but
the, the money is there.
It might have a better chance.
with you here.
kidding you. Um, Madam Chair,
um,
The other day we had the
opportunity to sit through a uh
Presentation by um
The Mexico Tech, which I
appreciated it was very good.
Yeah, but it, in that
presentation, if my memory's
right, um, the system that was
this coral, I believe, was
Cost $10 million for one.
One deep south
Unit.
And it produced
Half a million gallons.
500,000 gallons a day, 500,000
gallons a day.
You have $40 million in this. So
that's 4.
Seems like we're still short, if
we're going to really address.
Um
Mediate which in my missing
something.
Um, Madam Cha in Townsend,
absolutely not. I, I would have
liked to get more, I would have
liked to have more money in it,
but this is a good start. Uh, we
have communities that are, are
kind of ready to go and you
have, you certainly have private
entities uh involved in this,
but I'd like to turn this so
that answer over to Rebecca Rus,
who's really worked with a lot
of these international and local
companies and national companies
on these projects.
Madam Chair, Senator Tomsin, uh,
I'll just add briefly that um
yes, we think the need is
greater than $40 million for
Brackfish water projects in New
Mexico, um, but this is a, a
good start for us as a state and
uh well, your numbers from the
presentations the other day give
you a benchmark for thinking
about how these funds might be
used, um, the there's also the
ability through the program that
would be created in this bill to
uh administer grants to
communities that are
still in the study phase. Maybe
they want to use the funding to
do the plan and design of the
treatment plant, uh, maybe they
want to do a pilot or
demonstration project. The cost
analysis for each of those types
of projects is going to be
different and so um what our
hope is that um with an passage
of this bill with support of
this committee and um enactment
of the budget, we will be able
to get some rafish water
projects moving in New Mexico
over the next year and better
ascertain the real need and
demand out there in communities
and.
in the state for future funding.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
So, Madam Cha representative, do
you believe this?
of legislation.
Um, and, and the product of
this.
Mace fur.
3rd
partying
Um
Investment
Trying to help
Some of these communities that
disappropriation may or may not.
Yes.
Absolutely, Madam Chair, and,
uh, Senator Townsend.
Um, Madam Chair, is, is the
technology, you know, brackish
water is not.
You tell me if I'm wrong, but
Brackish water availability and
And um
New Mexico varies in.
Quality. Um,
Don't take much. Some will take
much more. So,
is part of the
study.
going to try to help how to most
economically addressed.
Those different
inputs.
But maintaining a consistent
output.
public safety is that.
Is that part of the issue.
Um, Madam Chair, uh, Senator
Townsend, it's always about the
cost of water and, and that's
what these studies will do and
Rebecca can take another stab at
this.
Yes, um, Madam Chair and Senator
Townsend, the, uh, every
individual brackish project is
going to require its own cost
analysis and economic
considerations based on all the,
the characteristics that are
specific to the water at that
site, um, and, uh, and what's in
it, how hard it's gonna be to
treat, what that means for waste
disposal, uh, including what
kinds of contaminants are going
to be pulled out that are going
to have to be disposed of
properly according to the state
solid Waste Act.
and hazardous waste act and all
of the other requirements that
would apply to these projects.
One of those
Um, well
You to a site-specific study and
cost analysis that the project
partners and proponents um will
evaluate and consider what what
that means in terms of
developing a BRC water treatment
facility at that site.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I think
that's important, Madam Chair,
and, and
Representative because.
The categorically say these
every one of these projects is
going to be a high energy user
is not necessarily correct
because with a different inputs,
you'll have different but.
Um
I would tell you.
Madam Chair, if we have
An energy source now that won't
power.
Clean water projects. Maybe we
ought to look at.
But energy source for using
cause it might be a problem in
itself.
Me, I know there's other people
that.
I don't have any questions. I'll
uh.
right here.
Thank you. Next, I have uh
Senator Cervantes. Anyone else
like to be on the list?
OK. And
Oh, OK, so let's go to Senator
Scott. Oh wait, Senator
Shamontes, you're next.
OK, and then we'll go to Senator
Scott, Senator Pope, Senator.
OK, thank you. So Senator Scott,
you're next. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
I looked at that $10 million
number for
Or, uh
500,000 gallons, about 1.5
acres.
Of water
Very expensive.
Or any utilization that we have.
Do we have any idea who's going
to be willing to pay.
These numbers.
For this
quantity of water
Again, uh, Madam Chair and
Senator Scott, I defer to
Rebecca on this.
chairs under Scott. Good
morning. Um, last year in 2024,
the Environment Department
conducted a feasibility study of
the strategic water supply
program, and that feasibility
study was published uh final in
November after some public
comment and part of what's
encompassing that feasibility
study is a lot of information
from end users, potential end
users of treated brackish water
and what they're willing to pay
for that treated brackish water,
um, so some of the end users.
That have participated in
dialogue with our um executive
agencies and partners over the
last year include um companies
that uh make the cement for
footers of wind turbines across
the state, um, maybe treated
brackish water is an alternative
water supply to make that
cement, um, that they'd be
willing to pay a little bit of a
higher cost, uh, manufacturing
facilities. Some of those
manufacturing facilities
have, uh, the willingness to pay
a little bit more for this type
of water that is treated
specifically to meet their needs
as opposed to hooking into the
local water utility, um, because
they can partner with the BRCish
Water Treatment Company to make
sure that that company's needs
on volume, on flexibility, and
on quality are met specific for
their project. So there are
multiple factors that can come
into play and willingness to pay
for this type of
water source. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair, Miss Rus.
And once you're rigged up to
desalinate water.
It doesn't make a lot of sense.
Not to take it all the way down.
You can get a little more.
Fixing concentrate in with.
The first
volume was, but
Most of the energy is expended.
all of the energy is expended,
pushing that water through the
RO membranes so
Once you get them, once you get
it through the membrane, you've
got to
The
Constituents that you won't go
and removed.
So
I mean these are going to have
to be
Kind of unique circumstances
which I believe you just
described.
For people that
Or putting projects together
where they don't care.
But the water costs because it's
such.
A small part of the total
expenditure.
Or
for drinking and irrigation and,
and general consumption.
I guess I would still have a
question as to how this.
Then people will basically
Madam chair
Representative Mr. Ros basically
will have to be desperate.
To be willing to pay.
But these
operations
Miss Anderson, I see you with
your hand up.
I, Madam Chair, um, Senator
Scott, I think it's important to
note that whenever you have a
development coming in or any end
user, the, the water quality can
really be fine tuned for the
need of that end user, for
example, a company like Intel
would already be treating even
if they're using drinking water,
they'd be treating that through
our own membranes to give it
additional treatment to get it
to where it needs to be. Some
other end uses like cement, they
might be able to use a more
salty water and so treating it
less for
that end use would cost less.
And they would factor that into
their business model.
Oh, Madam Chair, Miss Anderson
of mixed.
Salt water and cement for years
in the oil field.
And as long as the temperatures
right, it'll still set up.
But you have to have all of
those constituents in the right
proportions.
That's all I had. Thank you.
Thank you. We'll go back to
Sumner Cervantes.
Oh thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
sponsors. Nice to see you
represented. The bill as it was
originally drafted, had a $75
million appropriation for uh
contracts and grants.
brackish water.
Why, why was the $75 or $75
million where, where did that
number come from?
Madam Chair and Senator Sa said
they were really we're gonna put
a tax on produced water at that
time produced water was still in
it and it was about, uh, I think
it was got down to about 2 or 3
cents per barrel on produced
water, but when we took the
produced water out, we
eliminated that we kept 4 40
million in for brackish waters.
So $75 million was was based on
the original bill was $75
million was uh based on the
expectation of the act that was
going to be put on produced
water. Exactly. OK, and I
remember seeing that here too.
Although
Uh, my recollection was that
that bill.
And the tax on brackish water
didn't specify that the tax was
going to be used for this at
all, that tax was going to be
used for remediation projects
and so
Was that that was your bill?
Um, so, but, but I think it's
the same thing it was a tax on a
brackish water and that tax was
gonna be used for remediation
and I hear you say that the $75
million was projected and here
was based on the expectation of
that tax being generated, so
I'm, I'm trying to reconcile
that, um, in my mind a little
bit, but, but I appreciate at
least there was some, some
thinking on the 75 million and
now, as I understand it, House
Bill 2 as it comes over has $40
million.
And then the original version of
the bill had $28.75 million in
it to be spent over 3 years and
now it's down to $19 million.
I'm kind of glad that I'm, I'm,
I'm, I'm disappointed that
Senator Munoz is not here with
the Senate Finance chair, but I
see the House Appropriation
chair. I got to tell you, you
know, if I, I'm, I'm in business
and know a little bit about
finance and economics. If I go
to my bank or a lender and says
I want to borrow $75 million for
a project or investment.
Um, and the banker says, um,
Maybe not, and I go, yeah, but
40 million will do it. Uh, a
banker's gonna think that I
don't know what the hell I'm
doing or talking about, right?
Uh, which is what it sounds like
to me is going on here a little
bit, um, and well, and I'll,
I'll give you the chance to
respond, but same thing with
the, in the, the money going to
New Mexico mining, uh, well, the
bill had $28.75 million 28.75
million dollars. That's what we
want you need to do this, but,
uh, 19 million.
do it. Again, suggest to me not
very well thought out planned or
budgeted uh uh plans for
expectation and funding,
particularly with that 28.75
million because by the bill
that's supposed to be spent in 3
years.
Right, so that's got a, a narrow
window.
And you wanted to respond, but
I, I'm I'm really concerned by
this notion that we've got so
much money in the state of New
Mexico, we don't know what to do
with it. We don't know how to
spend it. And this is like an
insult to a drunken sailors. I
mean, uh, you know, I mean, how,
how, how do you reconcile the
fact that we thought
We need 75, 40, we'll do it. We
thought we needed 28, 19, we'll
do it.
I understand negotiation. I
understand, I understand the
notion that agencies in the
state ask for more than they
need, but when we say we're
gonna spend 28.75 million in
three years, but, uh, 19 will do
it. Are, are we just throwing
darts at the wall. Madam Chair
and Senator Cervantes, thank you
for that question. Um,
Uh, and I can speak to the uh I,
I will speak to the uh uh the
mapping, the monitor mapping,
uh, we.
It, it's also a matter of uh
scale and how many people you,
you know, you can train to do
this. It's an expensive
proposition before this, the uh
the uh um New Mexico Tech was
just getting $600,000 a year to
do aquifer mapping in our state,
so it is a vast improvement and
I'm, I'm gonna let Rebecca Roo
clarify the 75 million because
there are some other things
involved in that and I, I need
to have her clarify that.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
Senator Cervantes. So the
appropriations in the original
version of HB 137 were directly
aligned with the governor's
executive budget request for
this fiscal year, um, coming
into the session. Um, the
executive requested a $75
million appropriation to the
strategic water supply fund to
launch the strategic water
supply program in its initial
inception in this bill as a
programmed to find.
both brackish water and produce
water treatment projects. Um,
and that the proposed fee, which
was on produced water just to
clarify, never a proposed to be
on brackish water, um, was
intended to create a recurring
funding source to the strategic
water supply fund. When we made
the decision with our sponsors
to remove produced water
projects from the scope of the
strategic water supply program.
We also removed that proposed
produced water fee as a
recurring revenue source and
focused instead on
reading a strategic water supply
program to support raish
projects in New Mexico with our
requests still being from the
executive $75 million for that
fund. Um, we have been working
closely with our legislative
partners and appropriators on
that, on that throughout the
process. On the 28.75 million
initial request for New Mexico
Tech. That is the number that
was calculated by the experts at
New Mexico Tech, including Stacy
Timmons, who spoke to the
committee on Tuesday morning
about what they think they're.
Spend rate would be over a
three-year period of utilizing
increased non-recurring funds to
ramp up that aquifer mapping
program from what it's been, um,
we would still as the executive,
like to see 28.75 million for
three years for that program
come out of this legislature,
this session.
If 19 million is the
appropriation at the end of the
day. New Mexico Tech will scale
the, the size and scope of their
program and their spend rate
according to the funding that
they're appropriated. So like
the the like our sponsor said,
it is about scale, both with
respect to the strategic water
supply fund, infusion, and
however large that is, as well
as the appropriation
non-recurring to New Mexico
Tech. Thank you, Madam Chair.
In me has, has there been
anything like a written budget
and the plan that says we're
going to spend the $40 million
on uh which city?
What county, what project?
Um, what about the, the, you
said the 28.75 million to New
Mexico mining. It's now down to
19 and you're saying they're,
they're giving you these numbers
based on the spend rate, they
again back to the drunken
sailors, um, they just made me
to drink a little bit more cause
they could probably spend a much
higher rate, I mean, give
anybody in government and say,
how much can you spend, how
fast, and that doesn't seem to
me like a very logical way of
really making the highest and
best use of our taxpayer
dollars. It to sound too much
like a Republican sometimes, but
um.
You know, if we're, if we're
saying the taxpayers are
expecting us to be responsible.
How do I know that this uh
funding, especially with the
state is more important than
water conveyances than any
number of other water projects
and initiatives that will
deliver the maximum return on
the money we're putting into
that is there, I guess all
that's a long way of saying, is
there a list of budget of, of
projects and plans where this
money is gonna be spent or we
just again, we just kind of
throwing darts at the wall and
saying, hey, this looks like
this hits and we've got so much
money, we can spend whatever,
whatever's around.
Um
I guess, uh, Madam Chair and
senator, I'd, I'd like to answer
that in, in, in a
At a local level and then let
Rebecca take the statewide
answer as, as far as a for
mapping, unlike your district,
unlike the EBID and the middle
Rio Grande Conservancy in the
north. We have, we have no one
that's doing a for mapping. I
mean, I spent, uh, let me see, I
spent about when we got that
grow money I spent 300,000 with
uh Stacy Timmons at, at, uh, at
New Mexico Tech to come out and
to do aquifer mapping in our
region.
Because we have no idea how deep
our aquifers are, what's in
them, what they are, and what
we're finding out as she's done
this over a two-year period,
and, and you have to work with
volunteers. I mean, we had to
round up all these wells in
different areas like El Rito and
Dixon and Chama and Metanolis
and that we, we had about 7
different little communities in
our, in my district and we got,
we got people with wells and and
we went out and they studied the
wells and go down to each
individual.
owners well and check that water
and then they would get a a comp
you know, a composite of what
what the aquifer situation was
in that particular district in
my district, uh, senator and,
um, uh, Madam Chair, what we are
finding is because because
families are dividing up small
properties that we have a lot of
septic systems that are starting
to leak into our our our
aquifers. Next year we'll be
able to go to the water trusts
for.
it didn't get money for
wastewater treatment, which this
uh this legislature created that
path forward last year and so
that can be part of the solution
and we also have 360 million
more in the water trust board
than we had last year, so that's
gonna open up a lot of uh local
uh development projects that we
haven't been done before. So
that's just from a local level
and I'm gonna let Rebecca take
it from the state. And before
you do that, I know at some
point in time want to move on to
other.
Bills, but I, but I, I, so I'm
gonna try and maybe if you'll
allow me to catch you all short
on some of your answers, she'll
ask me to do that here in a
minute, I know.
So,
um, so, uh, my question was very
uh specific, which is what are
the, is there a budget or a plan
for the spending. So, so, so to
your point, representative, you
said, well, we need uh for
mapping in your part of the
state. Obviously, we need it
everywhere. For the $19 million
that we're putting into this,
what is the what is the planned
and promised scope of the
aquifer mapping that's gonna be
completed with that $19 million.
Where's it gonna happen? And,
and how far are we gonna get
with that? Are we gonna get it
all? Are we gonna get the state?
We're gonna get certain
counties.
We're gonna get certain areas.
How do I know that $190 million
what am I buying?
Madam Chair, Senator Cervantes,
uh, the, we can get you more
specifics from the New Mexico
tech team that manages that
program. They do have a long
term plan in place for
systematically, how do they work
their way across the whole
state. Multiple aquifers at the
same time, um, and building on
the data that's already been
collected, so happy to get some
materials to you as a follow up
as specifically what the next
two years looks like for them to
ramp up this program, um, the,
uh, target that.
The team that maps our aquifers
at New Mexico Tech has has given
is that to fully characterize
all our aquifers in the state.
It will take 10 to 12 years at
the funding rate that we
proposed a roughly 28.75% over
three years, so they would need
additional infusions in out
years over a 10 to 12-year
period of time to fully
characterize all the aquifers in
the state, deep, shallow, fresh,
brackish. So this is a a
infusion into that longer term
process. And again, we can get
you specifics on what their near
term projects would be on the um
strategic water supply fund, the
40 million.
that's in the budget right now,
um, we do not have pre-selected
projects. We know where some of
the need and interest in the
state is, and we would have our
agencies that are authorized
through the bill to manage the
program, um, do request for
proposals and solicitations for
grant applications, um, to
ultimately determine which
projects get that funding. The
last thing I wanted to know for
you, um, Madam Chair and
Senator, uh, Cervantes is that
in House Bill 2 as it came
across to the Senate from
in the house, there was nearly
$200 million of non-recurring
funding into water programs, not
including a $200 million
infusion into the water project
fund, so.
Setting aside water project
fund, nearly 200 million,
including the 4019 and 5 million
appropriations that are tied
into this bill, um, and also the
Austin State engineer got the
3rd largest recurring increase
of any agency in House Bill 2 as
it came over for the house. So I
just wanted to provide that
broader context that we're
talking about one sliver of a
much bigger uh conversation
around water funding in the 60.
OK. Thank you. OK, but stay with
me for a moment with the, with
the way I'm thinking, which is
you're saying, OK, we need $28
million initially anyway, that
was the original plan. We need
$20 million in a 3-year period
of time to make the progress
that we want to make and it's
gonna take 10 to 12 years to do
that.
In the, in the world of our
environmental crisis and water
demands and so for 10 to 12
years.
I
Astronom, it's a lifetime, um.
And so in my mind, I'm thinking,
well, maybe instead of using 10
to 12 years at New Mexico mining
at $10 million a year to a map.
Why don't we use NMSU to do some
of the aquifer mapping someplace
else and why don't we put money
someplace else and get done in 3
years or 4 years as opposed to
10 to 12 years. It, it just does
not, it's this really sounds
pretty half-baked, to be honest
with you, because again, we're
trying to, if the goal is to
aquifer map, we should want that
as soon as possible. We clearly
have
More money than we know what to
do with, um, and so why wouldn't
we be trying to do the aquifer
mapping sooner, um, with to us
your where's a faster burn rate,
um, and, and spread the project
or task around more places than
New Mexico mining if that's
really the goal. Uh, help, help
me to realize why aren't we
doing that? Why aren't we going
to other places and get this
done in 3 years and do what
needs to be done because my
concern is the 10 to 12 years is
number one too long, and number
2, you're assuming.
that we're going to continue
this rate of funding perpetually
and instead what we typically
see around here is like we do
with Kali, we get started with
the project, uh, right now
because we're flush, and then
when the economy turns down and
it's headed that way, let's be
honest, and, and oil and gas
prices invariably come down.
Then what happens is we start
cutting, and then we don't
finish, so we've got 2 or 3
years into this project and then
we stopped for a few years and
then we start back again. Uh, it
just, again, I, I'd like for a
more uh a sense.
That we're more strategic and
thoughtful about how we're doing
this and I'm not there yet, but
But if I can ask you a specific
question, do we, do we have any,
is there a plan already in place
for what we're gonna get done
with the, uh, at least the $19
million. What, what amount of
aquifer mapping is gonna be done
with that 19 million.
Senator Cervantes, um, again,
the specific projects that would
that the team at the Mexico Tech
would advance with the $19
million. We will follow up with
you on that. Um, and in terms of
your, your broader question
about how these different things
fit together in a strategic way.
We all, we have the same
concerns, um, as you've raised
about the pace of the work and
the reliance on um in in future
infusions that are uncertain,
um, and so
of really quick points. One, the
10 to 12 year fully um
characterized uh timeline that
we got from New Mexico Tech
about a year ago when we were
finalizing the 50 year plan was
it was crafted without the
strategic water supply program
in place without other sorts of
programs and initiatives in
place. If this bill passes and
we get some of the projects
going through the strategic
water supply that does uh
complement the work in New
Mexico Tech, the
will be um used together will be
shared across partners, the same
with the, the appropriation to
New Mexico State University here
and so the timeline will change,
we'll revisit that timeline and
approach and um and project plan
with the team at the Mexico Tech
so that we're leveraging every
possible program and partner and
funding a source to get where we
need to go sooner and in the
most strategic way possible. So
everything that was sort of
into your question is very much
in the conversations that we're
having around this program
broadly and aquifer mapping
specifically.
Well, I appreciate the answer,
but I'm still hope you can
understand I'm still perplexed,
right? What, what, what are we
spending the money on?
I wish we could go. Let me just
come to specifics, uh, and I'm
sure we're gonna have just a
little bit more time on, on page
two, you've got a a new
materials, all new materials in
section 3 strategic water supply
program, and if I'm reading the
definition here, it says that
this, this uh 75 million now $40
million is gonna go to the
Department of Environment and
Office of the state engineer and
it says each may may each enter
into contracts. Uh, who decides
how much of the 40 million goes
to the same engineer how much
goes to the environment.
department. How's that
allocated?
Mate, um, if you, uh, look at
section 4 of the bill, that is
the fund creation section and in
there, uh, it provides that the
fund will ultimately be uh
managed by the Environment
department cause we have to
place it in one agency's um
portfolio and budget, but both
OSE and New Mexico Environment
Department can voucher for that
fund fund to to draw out.
Of the strategic water supply
fund through DFA, but they have
to agree with each other first.
So one agency can't go to DFA to
pull money out of the fund
without first talking to and
getting signed off by the other
agency, so it, it forces them to
talk to each other, work
together, not overdraw the fund
and also ensure that each agency
knows what the other is doing
with respect to um advancing any
grant or contract projects
through the program.
Thank you, I'm looking at that
language on page two that says
each of those two the
environment department and the
state each enter right.
So are you telling me that they
can enter into them separately,
but they have to do them
collaboratively.
Man senator, that's correct.
Uh, just a few other thoughts
and, and unfortunately, you all
sometimes get subjected to
judiciary treatment because we
just don't have the opportunity
to send all these bills to
judiciary, um.
Uh, we're just starting on page
3 subsection 8 says contract
shall be in accordance with the
procurement code. I don't know,
but it says accept that the
contract duration shall not
exceed 20 years. Is there
something in the procurement
code that limits the amount of
time.
The requirement that we have
this language in here.
Cervantes, yes, there are term
maximum term limits for
different types of contracts in
the procurement code. And is
there anything in the
procurement code that allows the
contract to exceed 20 years?
Nothing in the procurement code
that allows it to exceed. OK, so
that, so really there's um
there's no need for that
paragraph. If you're saying that
you have to comply with the
procurement code, but you cannot
exceed 2 years, the procurement
code doesn't let you exceed 20
years, so there wouldn't be any
need for that language, would
there?
Madam Chair, Senator, just to
clarify, I think the general um
term maximum in the procurement
code is 4 years for typically
for most types of contracts. So
what we're doing with this
provision is saying strategic
water supply projects, uh,
contracts.
can be longer than if they were
limited to the procurement code
as it's as it exists. Thank you
much.
I'm sure I know you're gonna
want to move. I'll try and round
up my, my fundamental concern
here is one that I expressed a
bit ago, which is this the best
highest use of our resources,
right? Uh, or, or ample funds
right now to address our water
scarcity problems, um, and
that's always gonna be my
question, and, and I'm, I gotta
tell you I'm not really
persuaded here that this is the
best use of this what will now
be $59 million.
Uh, that would be in House Bill
2.
And I've heard some of the
opponents with their concerns
about other environmental
consequences, energy demands,
and others uh that are part of
that, but, but my, my
fundamental concern really here
is we continue this session and
over the last several years, I
see the trend. I'm gladen Anto
that uh Sao Lopez is here too
because her and I have this
ongoing uh dialogue which is,
which we, we charm each other
cause she's fond of talking
about how we're weak
legislature, and I agree with
her, but I, my difference with
her is we choose to
a weak legislature because it
avoids accountability and
responsibility. So here, what
we're doing is instead of doing
what we have done historically,
which has put money into the
water trusts board, water
project fund come to the
legislature and evaluate
projects and appropriate
projects ourselves,
specifically, what we're
essentially doing is we're
saying, uh, at least by the
original bill, take $100
million.75 and 28, a little bit
more than $100 million. You all
take this money and say engineer
and environment department, you
all decide who to give grants
to, who do
give contracts to to do the,
where to do the projects and how
much to spend on them, and I
think we're taking ourselves off
the playing field increasingly,
we could do the same thing by
doing this in the, in the
budgeting process. I I don't see
representative small still here
mosts not here, but it still
seems to me that we should be
legislature should still have
some relevance. Um, and as we
increasingly do this, put large
sums of money into agencies and
said, you all go do your
contracts, you decide, uh, you
set the criteria, you decide.
part of the state you're going
to do it in, then some of the
comments, I think Mr. Gong made
them earlier resonate with me,
which is the rural parts of the
state are gonna be the ones who
are gonna be left holding the
bag, right? We're, I don't have
any assurance he's probably just
gonna go to your district
representative or mine or
northern or southern or anything
cause we're, we're delegating
ourselves out of the, of the
appropriating process and out of
our role of legislators and I, I
think that's a bad idea. I, I
really would like to see what
we've done historically water
project.
Water Trust Fund oversight
bills, projects, capital outlay,
all of these kind of things we
used to do, and now we're kind
of like I said, more inclined to
need to stay home.
Do some gardening or
Thank you. I know Senator Cio
Lopez will probably
Enjoy and retort. I thank you
very much. I, I'm gonna go to
the Senator next, then Senator
Pope.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much. Just to lighten things up,
I have.
I usually read what's going on
up there and I think it was
whenever senator.
first started talking.
All of a sudden, it stayed at
raw fish projects.
And I got really concerned
there.
I didn't know what that was
referencing.
That's tilapia. That's, that's,
that was
that was the Richardson
administrations of years
agoapia, yeah,
And uh that is something I do
need to bring up from a long
time ago. I'm glad Senator
Sas brought that up because
I am wanting to believe that
whenever we were all in still in
the house that there was some
water mapping of money that did
go to New Mexico Tech and that
was, I know that senator.
Cervantes, myself and Senator
Worth were all involved in that,
and we were at a meeting over in
Socorro, so my concern is what
has happened to thou that
brought to the money for that
project because I know that was
done.
Because people that were in
charge, there you go, thank you
very much.
I don't have that paper.
Manner of Mister F.
Miss, Miss, Miss Chairwoman, uh,
that was a handout, excuse me,
Tanya. That was a handout from
Tuesday when uh Stacy Simmons
and Mr. Foley were here. Go
ahead. OK.
All right.
Madam Chair, I guess I have left
it in my other book whenever I
took those particular
Bills out to make room for all
of these that we have now.
So Madame Chair and
presenters, I'm just gonna lay
this all out here.
Senator Cervante stated that on
page 3, starting on line 2, that
that would be that that
paragraph doesn't need, really
need to be in there because it
does not serve a purpose.
Madam Chair, I guess my question
is for the presenter.
Is on page 2.
Section 2B. Why is the
definition of produced water
still in there if produced water
has been taken out.
Madam Chair, Senator, thank you.
Um, good question. The term
produced water is used right
above in the definition of
brackish water.
And so, in order, the drafter
advised that since we were using
produced water in the definition
of brackish water, uh, we should
keep the definition of produced
water in this bill, and that
definition of produced water
there in paragraph B is
identical to a definition of
produced water that exists
elsewhere in our statutes, um,
based on the produce Water Act
that was enacted in 2019. Thank
you, Ma.
Thank you very much. I was just
handed this.
Hand out. So thank you very much
for that.
Oh, madam chair.
See here on page 6 of your bill.
I, I really do like that new
language that has been added in
its states until the state
engineers determined that the
use of water stated.
In the not will not impair
existing water rights be
contrary to the conservation of
water rights within the state or
be detrimental to the public
welfare of the state to meet the
use of water.
Uh, will not impair existing
water rights is should be the
star of this right there.
I will not have anybody's water
right interfered with Madam
Chair.
I, I do have questions for the
presenter.
Um
And Section 2 of this bill under
definition.
Treated produced water, OK?
It takes it from deep brackish
water down to brackish water and
then
Removes also deep from treated
brackish water.
So I, I'd like an explanation
there. Why is that language been
changed in section 2 under
definitions.
Madam Chair and Senator Gel.
The original version of the bill
only related to deep brackish
water. We have listened to
members and have expanded the
definition to include any
sources of brackish water.
OK, so
And you're considering deep
brackish water at 2500 ft.
Or deeper, is that correct?
Madam Chair.
And Senator, yes, that's by
existing statute that's a
separate section. OK, and also
determinate upon the TDS, is
that correct?
Madam Charon and uh Senator,
absolutely yes. Thank you.
And Madam Chair, let's see what
was that.
Madam Chair, I do have a
question for the representative.
He said the funding for this was
struck in HIV HAFC.
Then I evidently I don't have a
current bill in here.
Where will this bill be going
next?
Madam Charitz goes to Senate
Finance after this. Senate
Finance, but you are stating
that the majority because
whenever I was pulling at the
figures and I'm not gonna be
redundant, uh.
Senator Cervantes was talking
about the finding and we both
agreed on the figure of $107.5
million.
In the original bill.
So
As far as the water project
funds go.
If, if extra money is needed,
will you be able to make
application for the empty.
to be able to help with what
you've got.
Um, Madam Chair, uh, Senator
Isel, so you're asking if people
can go to the water project to
do these projects, um, I, I,
yeah, I think they can go to any
source of money we have. We have
the next year $360 million in
that one.
Man, that's all I've got. Well,
one other thing I was going to
say, I wish.
Senator Cervantes was still in
the in here.
Because he said, uh,
He was starting to sound like a
Republican and I don't mind him
sounding like a Republican as
long as he votes like one. Thank
you very much.
Thank you. I'm sure you'll hear
that some if not at this moment,
another time. Senator Pup your
next.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, sponsors and experts, um, I
will try to be as quick as
possible so I please ask for a
short responses as well.
Um, I have some of the same
concerns as Senator Front has
brought up about the amounts and
what it's actually gonna be
spent on.
You know, I was in the Air
Force, I worked on satellite
programs.
and space and sometimes that
technology you didn't know what
it was actually gonna cost.
Um, but I just don't feel
comfortable with what we're
talking about really getting.
Assurances on what we're getting
for this summer.
Uh, when I served, we would get
questions on amount of money and
The term used as we would send
off and we'd call it a wag. It
was a wild, you could assume
with the, the A and stood for
and then the G was a guess.
And um
I understand
This money and it's not accusing
anyone of wasting this money. I
just feel like, OK, here's some
money, we'll move on to you and
go and.
Make this happen.
And so the question I have is,
We talked about the 10 to 12
year plan.
napping and the data.
Why aren't we just throwing
A lot of this money.
For that first.
To get that done.
before we move on to talking
about
spending money on the.
Uh, Madam Chair, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna turn this over to Rebecca
too, but I would just say some
communities are really water,
really ready for brackishwater
project right now. I'm I'm just
gonna say that and um the uh the
aquifer mapping, I think that
case has been laid out, whether
you agree with it or not is, is
kind of what we did, but I'll
let Rebecca take that.
Yeah, Senator, uh, Madam Chair
and Senator Pope really
appreciate the question and um
I, I
I want to convey as quickly and
and effectively as possible that
the the separate appropriations
included in this initial
legislation are very intentional
and very complimentary to each
other. Um, we know that we have
not yet characterized all the
aquifers in the state. So and I,
and I hear from you, you, you
understand the importance of
funding that program, um, the
reason why we're asking the
legislature to fund
multiple things simultaneously
is because there are communities
like the village of Cuba, um,
Donana County and Santa Teresa,
um, Alamogordo, Rio Rancho,
these are communities that have
um information, enough
information to know that there
is a uh brackish water solution.
For sure or likely in their
community. The funding for the
strategic water supply program
helps those communities out
right away while we continue to
supersize our aquifer mapping
program with increased recurring
and non-recurring investments in
that program. So we really see
the time is now. Other states in
this country, there are hundreds
of brackish water desalination
plants inland desalination
plants, not seawater, um, in
the, in the United States.
And around the country were
behind in doing this and we have
communities ready to go, and
this creates a dedicated funding
source to help them out. So
that's, uh, Madam Chair, uh,
Senator Pope, where we're coming
from. Thank you. Thank you,
Madam Chair, and thank you for
the, the quick response. I try
to get through this as soon as
possible. I agree this is the
direction we're going. I just
want to make sure that we have
everything in place as far as
The characterization and before
we just make an investment, I
don't know what we're dealing
with.
So Madame Chair, a
representative experts.
Um, do you feel right now, you
mentioned what we have as far as
Regulations as far as moving any
type of
Hazardous or toxic waste from
the waste that would come about
from desalination.
Um, I don't see any of that in
the bill. Would that be done in
rulemaking or do the current
regulations that we have
actually protect.
Our water and protect our
landfills and protect our
environment from waste products
that would be.
Madam Chair, Senator Pope, you
don't see that in the bill
because this is not a regulatory
bill, um, and so there's
language in here that says every
contract, every grant is subject
to all applicable federal,
state, local, and tribal
requirements and and permitting
requirements that apply and so
the answer is our existing
regulatory programs to protect
our groundwater and surface
water from pollution and to
ensure that solid waste and
hazardous waste is managed
safely and effectively in.
New Mexico, all of those
existing regulatory programs and
requirements and permitting
provisions attached to every
single one of these projects,
and so it's, it's hardwired into
an existing regulatory
framework, essentially. Thank
you. Thank you, Madam Chair. I
think it's important everyone
knows that.
most of you do know that, you
know, there are some
radiological materials and
actually occurring, to make sure
those are removed and
Like I said, New Mexico has been
a sacrifice film.
And we have other things that
they clean up and I just want to
make sure that we're protecting
our water once we go down this
route.
We inject this into our
freshwater and aquifers, you
know, I just don't want us
contaminated.
The water that we do have. We
did get a presentation as well
on how energy intensive some of
these projects can be, some of
that can be avoided with, I
heard about one project where
the elevation was different, so
you're kind of using gravity to
go through.
You know
The system to help.
Um, has there been any thought
to um using renewable energy
sources.
Battery storage, um, and I say
that not only um because of the
technology and the way the
energy and the prices coming
down.
But also the fact of what we're
dealing with is because of
climate change and how do we
make sure we're not contributing
to that further.
Madam Chair, Senator Pope, um,
that's been a key consideration
both in the feasibility study
that was developed in 2024 and
in crafting this legislation and
in um subsection H of section 3,
there is a provision that
requires the office of State
Engineer and Environment
department when they review um
grant or contract proposals for
strategic water supply projects,
they have to um consider how the
projects and the proposal will
limit greenhouse gas emissions.
That essentially means if it's
the environment department
putting out an RFP for strategic
water supply contracts that RFP
is going to require every
proposal to explain how are they
going to limit greenhouse gas
emissions with their project. So
the consideration of energy
source and um climate change
contributions is built in to the
program. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Representative and
experts. One final question, I,
I have more, but, um, just for
the sake of time.
Um
Do we have any data and
Do we have any data or
information what the impact
would be to
Um, drilling and removing this
brackish water as far as
The geology will be experiencing
any sinkholes or other
effects.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator Pope.
The Office of the State
Engineers responsibility will
continue in terms of evaluating
exactly those impacts with
respect to any treatment of
existing brackish wells, and we
heard from, from Stacy Timmins
on Tuesday there already we know
about 8000 existing brackish
wells that may be eligible to
participate.
Or any new wells that are
drilled, our office will
evaluate the impacts associated
with those projects. Thank you,
sir.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you for representing experts.
I'll just uh
all ended there. I have more,
but we got.
Thank you. I think we're gonna
do uh Center Cila Lopez and then
myself, and then we're gonna go
to a boat.
Thank, thank you, Madam Chair.
This bill is a lot better than
last year's bill. Um, I really
love that the produced water is
out of here because
When Senator Cervantes was
talking about half-baked. I, I
didn't think that was fully
baked.
Um, and I, so I think those are
good. Um, I just have a couple
of
Of the
Questions with regard to the
issue of the relationship that
we've got to find more water.
With climate change, we just
don't have
Enough water in this state, so I
recognize that that need.
Um
But in doing so, and I love uh
uh section I that was inserted
or uh well, I'm using this, so
it's probably not the same
place, um, about making sure
that the notice of intention and
filing requirements and that the
state and engineer is involved,
and I saw that at the end of the
bill too that the state engineer
is involved. I think that's
really important, um, because
this water.
It's gonna eventually,
hopefully.
In to the the stream system, our
system.
And either become aquifer or, or
be a surface water at some point
because that's what water does,
um, and so I think that there
are a lot of strengths about the
bill.
My concern and
And I don't, I know that when
they're all this far, you don't
wanna amend them. Um, I
recognize that, but my concern
is about the the relationship of
this project to other
environmental projects. So we
have the ETA, right?
So what would happen if this
plan required um
If, if this, if the
And I don't know, I, I did hear
a little bit about the
desalination programs, and I've
toured some desalination plants,
and they're very impressive, but
the most impressive are the ones
that use solar and wind, and
they're just like perfect.
Um, things, and there's no
limitation really on, on how
this desalination would work,
um, and we had a great
presentation, I think from, but
there was one, it's just one
Provider of this service, um, or
Uh
forgot the name of the company,
but the and and he had um he
talked about what what existed,
but they were not necessarily
used with renewable energy.
Um, and so what can you tell me
a little bit, Madam Chair, about
the plans, what kind of
companies you've been talking
to, are there, what kind of
plans do they have with regard
to the abundant renewable energy
that we have in this state and
whether they're just gonna
either hook onto the grid or if
they're going to use diesel or
natural gas or whatever to, to
run these uh.
These plants.
Mountain Center City Lopez,
thank you for the question. Um,
the, there's some greater detail
in the feasibility study around
possible energy sources, clean
energy sources, um, I wanna know
that one of the big policy
drivers from the governor and
supporting the strategic water
supply is to support our clean
energy transition, which is in
and of itself water intensive,
um, without putting greater
demands on our freshwater, um,
and as we diversify.
Our economy, um, away from oil
and gas revenues. We need more
industries to come into the
state that are going to generate
revenue for the state, um,
through, through other means and
those um activities can also be
very water intensive, so the um
clean energy transition is a key
driver for doing the strategic
water supply in the first place,
really, um, because we know we
need water for these other
things and we know we don't have
enough water already. Um, in
terms of a project by project
analysis.
And one the strategic water
supply program is implemented
the agencies, the two agencies
involved, um NBD and OSE will
require any applicant for
funding, added strategic water
supply to explain how they're
what their energy sources are
for their project and how
they're planning to limit
greenhouse gas emissions. Um, so
that consideration will be
included in the program and and
there's a provision in the bill
that that requires that and um.
And the last thing that I wanna
say is that we've seen a lot of
interest from the types of
companies that have uh reached
out to us to talk about the
strategic water supply, like the
potential end users of the water
as well as the treatment
companies. These are companies
that are engaged in new and
cutting edge technologies as
well as tried and true renewable
resources, um, and so the, the
goal here is to have sustainable
projects that are augmenting
our.
water supplies while also um
supporting our clean energy
transition. Thanks, man.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. It's
just that the whole thing about
what's required is clearly
demonstrating how the project
will advance state tribal, and
local government economic
development, um.
I like that it is broadly shared
benefits to members of the
public public who may or may not
be, who may
Or may not be impacted by the
who are or may be impacted by
the strategic water plan. Um,
they must be a public entity,
um, and that's good, they must
be approved by the states and
engineer is advancing the
exploration production or
treatment of brackish water. I,
I like all that, but it's well
then clearly demonstrate how the
project will event state,
tribal, or local government
again, economic development
goals. There's a very
economically focused, and it
would be really nice, and I'm
not going to try to amend it
cause I
He thought it would be concur
concurred with easily, um, to
add sustainable, sustainability
or to add something, something
that would give guidance to when
they're considering these plans
that they be sustainable, that
they be um the kind of project
you described, because what you
describe is fantastic. A bill
just doesn't require it that I
can see. I love the changes that
it had that about adding public
notice, hearing, I mean, there's
so many things I love that you
changed in the bill.
Um
If I had been on an early
committee, I would have asked
for that.
You know, some language of
sustainability or
In this bill, um,
I understand that we've got to,
as you know, um, and I, if I
were
Um
I guess this is to Senator
Cervantes's point is, um, I
would have liked to prioritize
to have the water mapping first.
And then go from there, cause
even the water mapping will help
industry figure out whether
they're gonna come, um, and use
any of this water and desalinate
it because that's what we have
to do first. Um, as you may
recall, I was a co-sponsor of
the Water Data Act, and it was a
small, it was a small step we
funded it with, with a little
junior money and whatever, and
now it's become very
significant, very important, um,
and I think I, I would love to
see that influx, so
we can have a really good map of
where that is. I think that
would be a, a real big step in
In industry, but these other
projects, I'm not sure, you
know, uh, there's a lot of
discretion in this, and I do
have a lot of confidence with
the ED department here with, you
know, what we've got in place
now.
But they're not gonna be in
place forever. Um, and that's
why I just wish, if you thought
it would be easily concurred
with, I would recommend putting
sustainability.
In those in the evaluation
criteria.
I guess I'll ask for a response
to that.
Yeah
of question.
I've talked that over with
Senator Minnos, and if we can do
it in finance, I, I see no
problem with that.
Not interested in doing it here?
Not interested. Oh, you want to
talk to Munoz first?
That's what you said. I, I just
clicked that that.
That's what she said. He is the
co-sponsor. Yes, OK, thank you.
OK. That, thank you. That,
that's all. But those, those are
my concerns, um, and I really
love that you addressed so many
of my concerns last time. I
think it's a much better bill.
Thank you.
Thank you. So, uh, my questions
uh were around the funding, and
that was answered, um.
Also, uh, the renewable power,
uh, we've, uh, and the
sustainability we've discussed.
But uh I see this as a research
bill.
And as a step moving ahead. So I
out
to see nods of head.
So I don't see this as full
blown.
OK. Any further questions before
we go to a motion.
What is the pleasure of the
committee on this bill.
I move a Du pass.
There is a motion for Dupe. Is
there a second? There is a 2nd
from Senator Hamlin.
Could the
Committee secretary, please call
the vote.
Lieutenant Cervantes.
I want to know, Senator Charlie.
Charlie, no, San Joel.
I know, Senator Hamblin.
And I have one, yes, and Pope.
No. The Pope, no, Senators.
Uh, yes, and I would like to
explain my vote,
Senator Townsend.
Townsend, yes, Senator Dia
Lopez.
Yes.
There's Lopez, yes, Stephonics.
Yes.
The upon yes.
So, Senator Scott to explain his
photo.
Take you madam chair.
While I would much rather have
seen all of these resources.
Directed toward pure research.
I recognize.
And have long advocated.
For the need to adapt.
Whatever climate change.
We're going to be facing.
And before brackish water can
come into wide use, there will
be required.
Some sort of technological
breakthrough.
To make this economic for our
constituents.
I believe the research effort is
worth it.
That's what I'm supporting.
Thank you.
Thank you. Oh, by a vote of 5 to
4, you have a bipartisan due
pass.
Thank you very much.
We are going back to the 2nd
item on the agenda and
Senator Steinborn has asked
senatorio Lopez to present
committee substitute for House
Bill 140 as amended.
Now these bills were were
Uh, put on the agenda with uh
the ranking member and the vice
chair collaborating on this. So
that is why we are hearing the
bills in this.
Uh manner.
Oh
Senator, please proceed.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um.
And thank you for the
opportunity to present this bill
this morning until the the US
Department of Defense Defense
challenged the law of PAS. There
really was no confusion. For
decades, businesses and
regulators work together under
the existing law and generally
agreed that toxic chemicals like
those that cause cancer must be
cleaned up before being released
into the environment.
Interestingly, even the US EPA
found the arguments by the US
Department of Defense to be so
out of line with federal law,
they issued a proposed national
rulemaking to ensure states have
the right to address hazardous
wastes in their constituents.
That rulemaking was proposed a
year ago today, but has not been
finalized.
Approximately 21 other states
have adopted similar laws in the
US Department of Defense, uh, is
working with those states to
clean up their bases, and we
remain the only state that the
US Department of Defense is in
litigation with over PAS and and
with HB 140 does is it tries to
bring us to equal footing with
other states where the military,
not the state taxpayers are
funding the assessment and clean
up.
Um
The department is not seeking
any recurring or general fund if
this bill passes. However, the
department continues to seek
funding from this body in
addition to draining its
permanent emergency funds to
defend our state from the US
Department of Defense's lawsuit.
Um, I would like to introduce a
of course everybody knows him,
um, our secretary of, of uh
environmental, what is the
Secretary of Environmental
department? Environment
department, um, Jim Kenny Kenny
is here to answer any questions
about the bill, and you may
recall that Senator Steinborn
had a similar bill, um.
This one has been.
It's mean to say it, but watered
down a little bit.
But
Uh, but I'll go ahead and let
him.
Uh, speak.
Uh, Madam Chair and members of
the committee, thank you for
hearing this bill. Uh, this has
been a slog on the House side,
and I know it's just coming over
here to the Senate, uh, the bill
has had made it out of its first
committee on a on a um party
basis then to House Judiciary
again on a party basis, we took
it to the floor, uh, continued
to work with the, with the
minority, got a really good
build together, uh, brought it
back to House Judiciary a past,
you know, um.
With both parties will vote and
then it passed the floor, uh
unanimously as well. So, um,
Madam Char and members of the
committee, what we did basically
was instead of opening the door,
you know, full and wide to
letting the Environment
Department decide what
hazardous, what a hazardous
waste is or isn't in the state
of New Mexico. We opened it to
tailor it to the point that
we're looking at discarded uh
firefighting foams that contain
POS. So we're really just trying
to solve the
problem instead of picking the
problem and opening a wide door
we're, we're tailoring the the
legislative ask to the problem
that we have, which is again,
uh, uh, discarded firefighting
foams, so there are 3 changes in
the committee so that is before
you that came off the floor that
I would just highlight for you.
There's a lot of number changes
and wording changes in in the
sense of
Uh, cleaning things up, but
substantively there's 3 changes,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. Uh first, we, we say
that, uh, and this is on page.
Um,
This is on page 7 of the
committee sub. Uh, we added the
definition or we added that uh
discarded aqueous foam forming
foams, uh, containing
intentionally added PAs are a
hazardous waste in the state of
New Mexico, an affirmative
statement saying that.
Uh, 2 on page 8, we added um uh
recognition that came from one
of the communities, uh, the
agricultural community saying
that they didn't want to be a
passive receivers of
firefighting foam wastes when,
when those biosollids are
spread, uh, that's consistent
with what we're seeing
federally. um, and we gave the
agricultural community a um out,
if you will, that their waste
are not hazardous.
waste in state law that's
already recognized in federal
regulation as well. Now we would
be re recognizing it in state
law. And third, Madam Chair,
members of the community.
Community Committee, um,
We are, uh, Madam chair members
of the committee and community,
um, the last thing we did is at
the very end of the bill, uh,
we, uh, affirmed that the
Environment Department has the
ability to bring a limited
amount of rulemaking related to
discarded triple Ale F for
firefighting films with PAs, uh,
to the environmental improvement
board so we can work on
destruction and disposal uh
rules in the event the federal
government does not do that. So
in conclusion, Madam.
it's all about discarded
firefighting bones. It gives the
uh ag sector, some assurance
that they're not going to be
collateral damage and what's
happening in Clovis, um, and it
will allow us to have a um a
better legal footing for our
continued efforts to hold the
Department of Defense
accountable. And that's, that's
all Me and chair.
Thank you. Let's go to the
audience. Can I see by a show of
hands, people who support this
bill, which is substitute for
House Bill 140 as amended.
1234567. Is there anybody here
that's opposing this?
Is there anybody online?
One in support. OK, so we're
gonna forego uh testimony
because of the time, and let's
go to committee questions.
comments.
And we'll start with Senator
Townsend. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you.
Secretary
And
Of you say this only addresses
PFOS, correct?
Where do we know we have POS
issues.
Where do we suspect we have the.
Um,
Madam Chair and Senator.
GA is a huge topic, as you know,
but this is only addressing
people when it is from discarded
firefighting foams. OK, let me
turn that around.
I'm sure.
Secretary Senator.
Where do we
No, we have
Pho foam
is where do we suspect we have
POs home issues, now the one
step farther, what are we going
to do to define
areas that we have PFOS or we
suspect we have people.
Um, Madam Chair, and, uh,
Senator, uh, so we know we have
TAs are discarded AFLF
firefighting films containing
PAs around our military bases,
so Cannon Holleman,
Kurt uh Kirtland, uh, we, we
know we have POS issues that may
not be from firefighting foams
around our national labs, uh,
Um, and then other, uh,
Um, the Army National Guard in
Santa Fe, down in Roswell as
well. Um, so I
Those are areas we know we have
PAS issues that may or may not
be related to discarded
firefighting foams. Um,
Madam Chair, Senator Townsend,
we also have
PAS issues that are
Uh, around, uh, La Cienega, La
Cenagua that are um
likely related to my opinion,
uh, likely related to cleaning
products, consumer products, and
things like that that got into
septic systems and well water. I
don't believe at the moment
they're related to AFLF.
Um, so the
And Madam Chair and senators I'm
also thinking this through, you
may be also asking about the oil
and gas industry or maybe about
refineries, um, the refineries
again.
tend to use things like
fluorinated foams that would be
caught into this bill once
they're deployed and discarded,
uh, but I know HF Sinclair and
talking to them have replaced
two fluorine free foams, which
are not Phosfoam.
I hope that's comprehensive
enough.
Yeah, that
That's um,
Thank you.
secretary.
And
My, my issue is
Can you determine?
That, that
That
The PFOS that you're looking at
originated in firefighting foam.
Is there a way to determine once
you have identified PFOS, where
it came from.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator,
once you have P5s, then you look
at the, you know, you do some
gas chromatography, mass
spectrome spectrometry to figure
out what those particular PAs
chemicals are not the family,
but the specific constituents,
and then you can start to see,
you know, of the dozen or so
that are in a triple F versus
the
TAs that would be in a different
type of chem uh different type
of product, you know, you can
start to resolve whether the
fingerprint is that of AFF or
the fingerprint is not. So that
is possible, which is when you
have 19,000 fingerprints to look
at, if you will. It takes a
little bit of time to figure all
that out.
But made me my I'm sure it made
me start seeing him because
I can remember one time when I
was involved in a project.
kind of fingerprint.
cruel issues, and we spent a lot
of time and a lot of dollars my
graphing different um crudes
trying to trace of chloride.
And although we could identify
the chloride.
Identifying
What type and where it came
from.
was
was more black magic than
science.
And I think, Madam Chair, and
you're gonna be faced with the
same black magic.
Um
And I can imagine the trial
lawyer.
You know, defense of saying
prove to me.
Based on the science that you
have today.
And you're looking at that
degradation of that.
that constituent over X amount
of years.
How can you prove that?
That's where it came from, uh.
It's
I, you know, if you're around
some installations, I mean the
that the
the science of probability,
probably starts.
Weighing in one way or the
other, but
I can see a lot of money being
made defending and
And um
Composing a big fence that
It will be hard to
trying to get through. It does
not take away from the fact that
we need to identify the POs
areas and address those. Um, I,
I get that. I'm just telling you
that.
I think you're gonna be
challenged in more than one way,
trying to defend.
My graph analysis.
And say
I, I know for a fact this came
from DuPont.
Uh, a triple app that was used
in 1960 something. Most coal and
gas industry.
Chad away from
Phos type phones.
years ago, decades ago.
So
I think you're
I don't know about military
bases where they, I don't know
but.
Yeah, but in the quantities that
they use are probably
Madam Char just really quickly
and Senator Townsend, you know,
the multi-district litigation
which New Mexico's involved in
where there's close to 500 cases
in South Carolina where I've
been going to that with our
general counsels at Goga, uh, in
our outside council, um, they
are doing exactly what you're
saying. They're looking at the
3M Dow DuPont, they're looking
at where it was shipped, they're
looking at what base had it and
their fingerprinting all those
chemicals to your point,
probably Senator Cervantes.
litigation over the.
and we're involved in it, um,
and we're at the point now that
those we are able to start to
discern what was shipped to New
Mexico bases with those
fingerprints are, uh, the
chemicals that are in those,
those POA PA uh family starts
being manufactured in the late
90s, early 2000s. That's what
we're seeing around our bases,
uh, not the things that are more
um
You know, might be in a cleaning
supply product which we
You know, the, the ones we're
seeing in La Cienega don't
necessarily resemble what we're
seeing around the bases. So, so
that what you're saying is, is
absolutely true and absolutely
happening.
OK, Madam Chair, I know.
And you to listen, but.
I appreciate the changes that
have been made to the field,
appreciate the effort.
I think
Unfortunate that we
take this.
Effort
In order to clean the
Um
started this was
Probably Kirtland Haldeman, I
don't know which one was the
driver, but it can.
It's unfortunate that we got to
get to this point to do this.
Thank you, madam chair, thank
you.
Victory.
Thank you, Senator Scott. Anyone
else to be on the list, Senator
Cervantes, go ahead, center,
madam Chair, Mr. Secretary, of
any of these plumes been
characterized?
and
Yes.
So
You have uh
Perspective clean up plans and
development.
Um, Madam Chair and Senator, yes
to your first question, we've
spent close to $12 million and
thank you to this body for
appropriating that both in in uh
to the department and uh
severance tax in uh in I should
say in bonds, as well as
allowing us to use our permit
fees to be able to do that. But
uh we've characterized the, the
plume around Holloman.
And Clovis around Hollyman and
Cannon Air Force bases, uh, we
can see what chemical is moving
at what speed, at what part in
the groundwater, etc. It's, it's
very well mapped at this point,
um, and Madam Chair and Senator,
we are developing cleanup plans
both as injunctive relief, which
uh the
The um federal judge just
denied, uh, but we are
developing cleanup plans with um
with respect to the bases and
hopefully the bases will rise to
the occasion as Senator Townsend
indicated it's a shame we're at
the point that we're being
litigated against uh for the
cleanup and having to do this on
our own and pay for it on our
own. Uh, but those pump and
treat cleanup plans are under
development now but not
implemented in the Curry County
area.
And mountain chair Mr.
Secretary.
I guess this is just a comment
those Air Force bases.
are hugely important.
To theconomies of the various
communities.
So it would be significantly to
our advantage to work out.
Some sort of
Compensation agreements.
That everybody seemed.
Fair and reasonable.
And
Oh
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, Senator Cervantes.
Madam Chair, the, I'm trying to
track the uh various House
amendments and the secretary
said you guys went through a
slog over there, so it looks
like it wasn't slo including the
floor amendments, you've got
pretty extensive amendments that
were done on the floor of the
house. So if, if I'm off base
with where I'm trying to track
all these through, please let me
know, but it looks like the
original version of the bill had
a definition for hazardous waste
constituents.
Or hazardous constituent in page
5 subsection L, and I don't see
that was ever removed. So is
that still in the bill?
Uh
Uh, Madam Chair, um, and
senator, I believe hazardous
waste constituent definition was
removed from the bill.
Um
Looking at the floor. I don't
see it there.
And I don't see.
Uh, it looks like if I'm looking
at the house Energy Committee
substitute, which we have in our
folder as 33.2. I still see that
definition there on page 5, and
then I'm looking at the floor
memo which I assume was the last
amendment after this committee
substitute, um.
Madam Chair and Senator, so our,
our course of action here was
Oh wait, I'm getting my bills
confused. Um,
We all do that.
I think it's still in there
unless.
I'm, I'm looking at the, the
amendments in context, where do
you think it is? I I I don't
have the amendments in context
document, but I have, I have
what I have is the
I'm sorry, Madam Chair. So I
have the House Energy Committee
substitute. I assume that was
the last version of the bill
that came to the floor.
Then I have the floor
amendments.
the house energy, Natural
Resource substitute as on page 5
that definition.
As L's on pages 5 and 6, and I
don't see any changes to page 5.
Um, so, Madam Chair and Senator,
so I have the amendments in
context here, and I don't have
hazardous waste constituent, uh,
it should be out of the bill
completely, um, but it's not, is
it?
It should be, but it's not in
context,
um.
On, on page 6 starts the
definitions of hazardous waste,
and it's not there.
And then, yeah, hazardous waste.
I'm sorry, uh, an L, I guess
it's L.
Uh, was stricken out hazardous
waste constituent or hazardous
constituent means a chemical
blah blah blah, uh, remember
when I described it was watered
down.
They watered it down by crossing
the south but who did that? I'm
looking at the committee
substitute bill and it has that
definition.
And then I'm looking at the
floor amendments and they didn't
take it out.
So, so when, when and where did
that definition get taken out.
Um
Madam Chair and Senator, we took
that out.
Uh, in
As it
I believe as a committee sub or
amendment in House Judiciary
before we came back to the
floor.
integral back and forth.
That's why I'm getting confused.
Uh.
I dreamed up Madam chair and
Senator, I will double check
that as far as we know in, in
the bill that was presented on
the floor that got everybody to
vote unanimously hazardous waste
constituent was removed.
But I, I hear that, but I can't
see how that ever happened. I
mean, I'm looking again, I'm
looking at the floor amendment.
The Flo Amendment says it's uh
an amendment to the committee
substitute by House Energy and
Environment and Natural
Resources.
That's what I'm looking at here
at the floor amendment.
That committee sub, and I'm
looking, then I'm looking at the
committee sub committee sub has
that definition.
Subsection pages 5 and 6, and
that didn't get taken out on the
floor, so still help help me to
understand you're telling me you
got taken out. I can't see where
and how it ever did.
Um
I, I'm not the bill sponsor, so
I can't really make any kind of
commitment about it, but I
understood that it was taken out
that's by one of the reasons
that I
identified this as a watered
down bill, um.
I will just share with the
sponsor the concern, and of
course, if you
If somebody made the amendment
on the floor, since it was a
creed agreed to.
Um
I imagine we could fix that.
to do it here because
We think it's already gone and I
don't know where you put it.
Madam Chair and Senator at the
risk of being a little naive
here. Isn't the version of the
bill that we're before you
today, the amendments in context
bill.
It's the Henrick committee sub.
and then the amendments in
context. It is 230433.2 and that
has paid in line numbers and
although amendments in context
are very helpful. It doesn't get
us to the page in the line.
So in
Definitions.
So, um, Madam Chair and senator,
then the moving of the apologies
again for being naive or not
understanding the process at the
point we're at then in the, in
the committee sub or the
amendments in context version,
um.
I, um, I, I think it's on page 5
of the bill.
L
Um
And that was removed.
Madam Chair, I may be able to
expire things if you don't mind,
can I just take a look at their
Context
Agree.
Well it's taken in
for Amendment number 1
and how doesn't one doesn't it.
But this, but look at this, Mr.
Secretary, you need to tell us
from the yellow amendment.
The answer to the question in
the bill with the line items,
page numbers for all of us.
And Madam Cheer by me, I, I
looked over their shoulder real
quick at the amendments in
context, and it says that was
struck on the House floor
amendment number one, but I've
got house forendment number one
and it wasn't.
So I think the, I think your
amendments in context.
That's pretty unusual, so that's
maybe a bit arrogant of me to
say that that that's wrong
because I, I don't usually see
them doing that, but I think
they're.
At least
I'm, I'm looking at the house
for my number one.
I don't see it here.
So, Madam Chair, where in the
bill are you seeing it?
In the
In the H E NRC.
Committee substitute 230433.2
pages 5 and 6 is new language.
committee sub, but has it on
pages 5 and 6, Madam Chair,
subsection L.
H56 has that definition of
hazardous waste constituent.
as its constituent,
So
That's the committee sub and the
floor movement doesn't show it
taken out.
Yeah
I, I see that now.
I, again, I'm not the sponsor of
the bill, but we can bring it to
attention, to the attention of
the sponsored the bill.
Because my understanding is that
the intention was to strike it
out.
I don't think anybody's trying
to be
I'm just, I'm just.
I'm suggesting the committee may
need to do that here.
So and Senator is,
you know.
I'm trying to reconcile, do we
have a drafting error.
Or is there some kind of uh
legislative council problem that
This is still here, but because
we have the amendments.
Uh, sponsored by Representative
Reed.
And that was taken out in the
house for amendment.
House right in front of you,
yeah, that's why.
I to give you a copy, man. I'm
sure if you need to see it. It's
not.
OK.
Um
Would it be a friendly?
Yeah
Madam Chair, it would be a
friendly amendment if um
senator.
wanted to do it here.
Just to be clear.
Senator, you have the floor. Um
thank you Madam Chair, my
understanding, again, I, I don't
wanna get this wrong.
Cause I don't think this goes
anywhere after here.
But they're they're telling me
they think it's out, but they're
telling me they think it got
taken out on the floor
amendment, and we all have the
floor amendment right in front
of us and
Not in number one.
Again, I want to make absolutely
sure I'm getting this right
before I am mend it.
They just need to be amended.
Um, Mr. Secretary, do you need
to roll this over to
Uh, clarify. Yeah, madam, I
think that would be good.
OK, so we will schedule you for
Tuesday morning.
we do that, go ahead,
since they're gonna maybe need
to do some additional
amendments. I would suggest one
other one too on the floor
amendment that we have.
You will redefine hazardous
waste of in small part, most of
that language is all existing
language, but you did and I
support it and I'm glad Senators
back with us. You, you added an
exception to the definition of
hazardous waste by including on
the, what's the
3rd page of the 4th Amendment,
which reads subparagraph age and
want her and other ones to on
the committee to pay attention
here, but you're exempting from
the definition of hazardous
waste, what would be solid waste
generated by the growing and
harvesting of agricultural
crops, you see that, which I
think is good.
I, I would like for you to amend
that to add the not just the
growing and harvesting, but also
the processing of agricultural
products because that's what we
do. And again, I'll be upfront
with you about that, but I, a
lot of farmers do that. Um, we
don't just grow and harvest
pecans, we process them. We
don't just grow and harvest
chili, we process it, we don't,
we, so we don't just grow and
harvest onions, we process it,
so I, I'd like for you to um add
the processing byproducts from
the
Within the exemption number one.
Number 2, you've got the raising
of animals, the waste generated
from the raising of animals. I
don't know, and it says
including animal manures. I
don't know whether that's gonna
include dairy, um, but I think
it should. Now, Barry has solid
waste produced obviously manure
so you're exempting that. But,
but you may want to include not
just the raising of, of animals
but includes some kind of a
dairy, um.
Conclusion because I think
that's what you're trying to do.
You're not trying to capture.
Yeah
The, the other thought that I
have for you if you're gonna
work on this sum is on page 2.
Right now that subparagraph B,
it's kind of interesting what
you're doing there, uh, which
is, you're saying that you're,
again, you're defining what is
hazardous waste.
And what we're saying here is
that
hazardous waste is what
includes, among other things,
hazardous waste includes with
the EPA says is hazardous waste,
but after July 1st of 2025, the
EPA says it's not hazardous
waste anymore, we're not gonna
accept their determination.
Which I think I know what's
going on here. We're, we're,
we're not sure EPA it's
Saturday, so I don't know if the
EPA still exists, um, and, and,
and I don't know if there's
anybody working there anymore,
but you're, what you're saying
is, uh, after July 1, we're not
gonna rely on the EPA to define
hazardous waste for us, which I
think is a good thing, but I
wouldn't wait till July 1st
because I think a lot's going to
happen in DC between today and
July 1st. I, I think they're
gonna cut.
They're pretty much gutting the
EPA now, and they're gonna get
uh any definitions of hazardous
waste.
So if you wait till July 1st,
God only knows.
What they're going to do, and
you're saying by this language
here, you're gonna allow them up
to July 1st to whatever they
call hazardous waste, uh, you're
using that as kind of the
determinate date if you will,
for what is hazardous waste or
not, and I.
And I, I'd, I'd make that now.
I mean if it if if if it's EPA
hazardous waste today, we should
keep it as hazardous waste
because I think they're gonna
take a lot of things off the
hazardous waste list tomorrow.
Next week, God only knows what
Elon's up to today, so.
I, I would move that date really
would.
Not not to get too political. I
had you there for a minute,
Senator, Senator. I know, I know
for a moment I had your heart,
and then I probably lost it,
once I started attacking, once I
started attack attacking uh
you of voting
as a talking and voting as a
Republican. Well said, yeah, she
said you should vote as a
Republican,
you know, Madam Chair, I like to
keep them on their toes because
when I give him half of, half of
it sounding like a good Democrat
and the other half sounding
like, you know, maybe a little
more conservative type. It just
really messes with their head.
It just makes it, but, but yeah,
I, I, I, I think Elon's gonna do
his thing to the EPA and, and
they're certainly gonna do it
with hazardous waste
definitions.
I'd move that data up. We're
gonna, it sounds like they're
gonna work on the bill, madam
Chair, so I, I'm not gonna try
and, and, but I'll, you know,
I'll take the debate and
discussion. I just thought that
if they're gonna go work on it,
I'd give you some additional
thoughts in doing so. Thank you.
I appreciate that. So before
you, we
Uh, let go of this bill. Are
there any more recommendations
that you want to pass on.
to the secretary in revising
Senator.
Madam Chair, thank you very much
and yes, I, I am in agreement
with.
I hate saying this with what
Senator Cervantes just said,
Hey now.
Hey now. I'm gonna record this
part of the video.
But madam chair and
Well, now
Senator
And Mr. Secretary, I think that
this needs to be
Re-evaluate it.
And make sure that we do have
the right deals that we should
be looking at because
Mine are totally different than
this gentleman sitting right
here next to me is, is that are
in context are different than
mine, and that does give me a
lot of concern.
I also am concerned about just
what senator Savante said about
it.
Farmer rancher, whenever we're
talking about that, that is
totally different than a dairy
operation.
And I, I want all of these
aspects looked at.
As far as I can tell, everybody
does still like tea, you know
where I'm going with this, but
yeah, there are some problems
here, but I
Before there's a boat taken on
this Madam Chair, I think it'd
be beneficial to all of the
members here and to the public
that's out there listening and
watching.
That we all are on the same.
Pardon the penage here.
So that's all I have, Madam
Chair. Thank you very much.
Thank you. OK, thank you for the
presentation, secretary and
Senator to the Olympus for
sitting in. Uh, we are moving on
to the next bill. Uh, the floor
has been moved to 12:30, so
we're gonna start House Bill 13
as amended representative uh
Dehaenejo.
Go ahead.
Good morning and welcome to
Senate Conservation. Please go
ahead. Thank you very much, uh,
and I understand, uh,
After you do your introduction,
we have an amendment that was
forgotten to be put on. It was.
Reported out.
House Committee without the
amendment, even though it said
it was amended.
So we, you have, it's being
distributed. You have a copy of
an amendment that the House
thinks they adopted.
But it did not get put onto the
bill.
So anyway, uh, representative,
please proceed.
This bill.
This film.
And uh
Lopez will carry on for a
minute.
Good question,
Senator. When you're ready, you
may proceed. Do you want to, do
you want to offer the amendment?
Well, why don't you explain the
bill first and then then the
amendment. Sure, thank you, um,
on my, so, uh, we're here to
talk about what we're, we've
been calling power up New Mexico
and essentially uh what power up
New Mexico does, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, well,
it does two things. So first,
I'm going to talk generally
about just how electricity is
generated and how it gets to our
homes. I think that'll help put
everything in and.
Context, so.
3 different parts. First, the
power is generated, uh, then it
is transmitted over those big
power lines that you see
throughout the state, and then
it is distributed to our
Billings, businesses and homes.
And so uh let's make it clear,
man uh power of only deals with
the distribution part of that
process, so from the power
transmission lines to our
businesses and homes.
So, um, Madam Chair, members of
the committee, power up, um, it,
it, it.
Firstly
Utilities, and we're only
talking about utilities that are
um that are
Public utilities under the
utility Act, the New Mexico
Public Utility Act, um, they
have to file reports. Um, they
are called integrated resources
reports at this time, and they
give us a lot of information
about the power generation and
the transmission part of the
equation, but we know very
little about what happens with
distribution. So the first thing
that Power Up in Mexico does is
it creates the requirement for
these utilities.
To, um, file, they already file
a distribution system plan which
talks a little bit about how the
utilities plants you get
electricity to our businesses,
businesses and homes, but power
up would creates new
requirements and disclosure of
that information publicly, um,
to help us better understand
one, where we have power right
now and create maps of where
that power exists, where we do
not have power and where those
utilities intend to extend,
extend power. So that's the
first thing that the uh
distribution system plan
requirement would do. Um, the
other thing that um the bill
requires is it would extend the
planning horizon for our
utilities to a 10-year planning
horizon with a five-year budget
horizon, and so what that would
do, Madam Chair, currently
utilities, um, they build and
they expand infrastructure
again, very little information
on distri
planning and then they go back
to the PRC and they request
either tariff writers or a base
rate increase to pay for those
upgrades. What Power Up would do
is, um, it would allow the
utilities to what we call right
size, so plan for a 10 year
horizon, which would allow them
to take into consideration all
of the future economic
development plans, um, that are
in the pipe, these utilities
would need to um support and it
also
allow them to pre-order any
infrastructure equipment needed
to um allow for those
expansions. So right now I'm
sure a lot of you heard um that
there's a 3 year waiting list
for Transformers, um, right now,
and so this bill would allow
utilities to pre-order those
transformers and get the
infrastructure ready so that
when we need to connect, we can
connect. Currently, another
issue that this bill would fix,
Madam Chair, is if you have a a
potential customer who wants to
connect to the grid, but the
grid either is not available in
that area or cannot um
accommodate that additional
capacity. We basically tell
those potential customers. To be
so sad. Wait until the grid gets
to where it needs to be, and
then you can connect. One
problem that this bill solves,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, is it would allow uh
those potential customers
through a um a a connection
interconnection fee and
utilization.
Uh, new technologies to connect
to the grid right away. So, um,
I'll talk a little bit about how
I got involved with this
project, Madam Chair. It was
through the um Bernalillo County
Economic Development Office,
talking about the trade ports
that we're planning out in I-40
and Gallop and uh we realized
that we did not.
capacity and the ability to
connect them to the power they
need to accommodate um all of
the extra stuff that they are
planning to build out there, so
this bill would allow for
immediate connection, uh, we're
currently there would be none.
The second requirement that this
bill um has uh madam chair, and
it's and it's being
In consideration at the same
time that the PRC is
promulgating a grid expansion
rule, um, is it would allow for
the filing of beneficial, what
we call beneficial
electrification plans and what
those do, um, Madam Chair, is
they would allow the utilities
to report to the PRC,
uh, progress on how they intend
to meet the carbon emission
reduction goals that have
already been codified into law,
um, this bill has nothing.
To do with further codification
of those standards or lowering
lowering of those standards. It
simply would require a report to
tell us how the utilities plan
to meet those standards, and it
would also allow um utilities to
offer voluntary programming to
customers who want to switch
over to more energy efficient,
uh, say appliances that would
allow them to again um help
reach those um emission
reduction goals, and it also
would change
a current problem we have with
our uh rules and that right now,
utilities are disincentivized
from um using electricity. And
so some of our uh more current
technologies or new technologies
like heat pumps that do use a
lot of electricity, utilities
are currently disincentivized
from allowing customers to use
such technology because even
though they use a lot of
electricity, they're actually
quite efficient. They're more
efficient than say an air
conditioner would be otherwise,
so power up with uh
Fix that um issue in the rule as
well and um I, from there, I
think it's good to um talk about
the amendment that needs to be
put on, so in that uh process
with the new grid mod rule, um,
being promulgated by the PRC.
We had asked that the beneficial
electrification plans once
submitted to the PRC be
considered um and either
approved or uh rejected within
180 days after several
conversations with the PRC, uh,
we have decided to eliminate
that requirement, um, as it
would be too onerous for them to
meet, and that was the amendment
that was supposed to be put on
the House Judiciary, um, so all
that amendment does, Madam
Chair, is take out that 180 day
requirements.
Um, and, um, so, yeah, in
addition to that, uh, Power Up
would also allow for expansion
of workforces, um, so that in
part of the 10 planning, a 10
year planning horizons, we can,
um, homegrow.
New workers who could be uh
working in this area for many
years to come, and these are
good high paying jobs that would
um only be more necessary as the
grid continues to expand, um,
and I will finish, Madam Chair
members Committee with um
emphasizing that this is an
economic development bill. This
bill is designed to, um, through
the process already mandated uh
with the PRC allow our utilities
to uh better plan for the.
future, better plan to hit a
mission carbon carbon emissions
reduction goals that we already
have in law, and it would uh
help us bring the price of
electricity down because the
only way to bring electricity
prices down is to add more of
that.
And uh with that, I'm sure I'd
like to introduce my expert
sending to my left, this is
Michael Kinney from Western
Resource Advocates, and with
that, uh, I also want to
introduce my co-sponsor in the
Senate, Senator Linda Trujillo,
and we will stand for questions.
Um, is there anyone in the
audience in support of this
bill?
So the amendment, that's right.
I'm sorry, I was texting
somebody else, so I, um, so.
Um, do we have anybody who wants
to move the amendment for
discussion purposes?
Madam Chair, I'll move the
amendment to House Bill.
13 amended and the amendment is
0.231897.1.
Do we have any discussion on the
amendment?
Committee discussion on the
amendment. Oh, actually, do we
have any support in the audience
for the amendment.
Do we have any opposition to the
amendment.
Since we don't have any
opposition, um, let's just move
it to the committee and we are
in such a big, big uh rush to
get to the floor. Um, do we have
any committee concerns about the
amendment?
Senator, um,
I think Senators Scott, who was
first? I don't, I was looking
this way.
OK, Senator Scott.
Oh
Madam chair had had an
opportunity to study this
thoroughly, but
in search of he were.
The tariff rider proposed.
They're going to check 30 days
after filing.
Unless defended by the
commission.
And how long might that be
before.
Those plans are actually
implemented.
Um, Madam Chair, uh, Senator
Scott, so I'm, I'm confused. Are
you talking just within the
context of the amendment after
the 180 day.
Um, deadline is eliminated.
Yes, in section E.
It's, it's uh in number 6 of
your amendments.
in front of me.
Um, Madam Chair, uh, members of
the committee, I'm going to
defer my, defer to my expert who
Can answer that.
Thank you, Madam Vice Chair,
Senator.
Um, so that provision there was
at the request of the public
regulation commission, which is
standard language they add, um,
whenever a utility has the
option of requesting a tariff.
That's kind of their standard
language that the commission has
the authority.
To
Say when it can go into effect.
These plans would be filed at
the discretion of the
commission, ideally, every 3
years when they file their
energy efficiency plans. So
those go into effect. OK. Thank
you. Essentially, as soon as
they're approved for the, the
year that they take effect, so
if it's a 2025 to 2027 plan, it
would go into effect once that
year takes over.
OK, that chair.
Representative and expert with
the question would be.
If these are going to take.
2 years to implement would
Would consumers be paying?
Or
Upgrades to the system.
2 years before their act.
Implemented and providing a
benefit.
I do want to remind everyone
that this was actually an
amendment that was adopted on
the floor. Is that correct?
Madam Chair was actually adopted
in the House Judiciary. OK, so
this was an amendment that has
been adopted, so I don't think
we should have a big discussion
about it since we, we should
talk about it as part of the
bill, but I think we need to
fix.
Fix the bill because the bill
doesn't currently have this.
So does everybody, so I'll just
ask if everybody, we shouldn't
have had a big old deal about
the amendment. We should just
say, do we agree to adopt what
the house did, the House
Judiciary Committee did.
Um
Is everybody OK with adopting
what House Judiciary Committee
already did.
Madam Chair, that is not.
231-897.1.
That my understanding and please
correct me if I'm wrong. My
understanding is this this
amendment was adopted in House
Judiciary and for some reason,
oh, so did the house not vote on
this amendment?
Madam Chair members of the
committee, so the amendment was
brought in House Judiciary, it
was discussed at length in House
Judiciary, it was voted upon and
adopted as part of the bill and
House Judiciary, unfortunately,
the chief analyst and committee
secretary for the House
Judiciary was out that day sick
and so for whatever reason, even
though the amendment was
adopted, it was not read out
correctly with the bill. So, um,
when the bill then went on to
the floor discussion.
It did not contain this
amendment, even though it was
everybody's understanding that
the amendment had already been
adopted as part of the bill.
Well, if the House floor did not
adopt it, then I think it is
appropriate to correct it here,
and I think it is subject to
discussion. So I, I, OK.
I, I had a different
understanding. I thought the
horse, the, the house floor had
actually voted on it, so please
continue, Senator Scott, I'm
sorry.
Yes.
I'm concerned about this if it
was not reported out as what the
committee actually did, it needs
to go back to the house.
Be corrected there first.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator after
extensive um
conversation and um uh
Looking to legislative council
services and uh conversation
with the director of the bill
adopting the amendment here in
conservation was uh decisively
the best way to go, and it, it
would be allowed under the
rules. OK, but I, I
misunderstood. I thought that
the house floor had voted with
this in it since it did not, I
think it's appropriate. It's
we're going to fix it to have a
comprehensive discussion of it.
So I apologize, Senator Scott, I
had a different understanding.
Please continue.
Madam Chair
Do, do I have a copy.
Of the amendment that is in fact
under discussion. Yes, it's,
it's 0.231897.1. You do. That's
the one I have and it is now
open to us to decide whether to
fix this bill, um, and
It's because the house floor
didn't vote on it.
Madam Chair, I think I what's
not quite true. I apologize. It
took me a little while. I was a
little slow on the uptake. Madam
Chair and senators, I mean, uh,
to, to be, uh, we admit this is
incredibly confusing. Um, we're
all trying to just figure out
the best way to to
Go about this, so you're not the
only one, Senator Scott. OK.
Battle chairs representative, I
have the original bill and your
proposed amendment.
In hand, would you please
explain to me what you want to
do with the amendment.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator
Scott. So the original bill had
proposed for the bene the
beneficial electrification plans
for submission to the PRC that
the PRC had to rule, had to
decide whether or not to accept
or reject the BE plans within a
100, 180 days of receipt of
those plans. And so what this
amendment does is take out that
180 day.
deadline.
That's all it does.
OK.
Now back to my
All right, back
to my original question.
In paragraph 8.
The tariff rider proposed by a
public utility to fund.
The beneficial electoral
electrification plan shall go
into effect.
30 days after filing.
So, the plan is filed.
The proposed rate riders are
are approved
And now those great riders are
going on to next month's bill,
how long will it be before the
actual improvements or changes
are made to the system that
would benefit the customers that
are paying for them now.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator Scott, so that would be
up to that particular utility.
So if the uh tariff rider or the
base rate increase is adopted as
part of that, um, that plan of
the build out, let's say Excel
Energy submits a plan to provide
additional augmentation of the
grid and the Permian Basin and
they decide that they want to um
order 10 transformers, right, as
one of the first things that
they do as part of their
expansion then that would be one
of the things that these the
tariff writer or the base rate
increase could go to, but really
it's up to the utility as to how
they would be utilizing these
additional funds, but it would
be, it would be a part of the
plan that would be submitted to
the PRC that would be under
review by the PRC and would have
to either be accepted or
rejected by the PRC.
But my ex would like to add one
other thing.
Thank you. Um, thank you, Madam
Chair, Senator.
So this is for the beneficial
electrification plans. So these
Our discrete budgets that they
request this is separate from
the distribution system plans.
And those budgets would be
Allocated to a given year.
So they aren't going to
immediately start collecting
that money, and they have to
wait until that budget year
occurs. So if
In the case here Excel requested
$5 million as their budget for
2026.
They don't start collecting that
money to spend for that year
until 2026. These are similar to
the energy efficiency programs
where there, there's discrete
programs, discrete allocation of
rebate money to specific
equipment so that
Budget is there to draw from,
but it's not, you know, a
guarantee that they would spend
all of it. And if they don't
spend, then it gets rolled back
to the customer. It's not kept.
OK, so Madam chair.
Representative and expert.
This tariff rider would apply.
To the planned purchases.
Whether they ultimately get made
or not.
Is that
Right
So this, this would be for
equipment incentives or
programs, not for like
Transformers, we're talking.
For the BE part we're talking
more about heat pumps or maybe
insulation to your home. And so
those only happen on a voluntary
basis. So the utility can
collect the approved budget.
That then customers can
voluntarily draw from if they
install that equipment.
But if they don't reach their
budget cap, they don't keep that
money.
There is a separate budget
request for distribution system
planning equipment.
That is outside of the scope of
what that language is is
amending.
OK.
But
There is a bit of conflict,
Madam Chair.
An expert with plain reading of
Section E and what you just
described.
Because of the use of the word
shall.
Madam Chair, um, Senator Scott.
So, are you talking? I think I
understand your concern.
So looking at the language in
that.
And beneficial electrification
plan filed in conjunction with
other plans filed with the
commission shall be acted upon
within the time provided for the
companion plan with which the
beneficial electrification plan
is filed. Is that the language
that you were, you are
specifically referencing of the
paragraph and start with a
tariff rider tariff rider
proposed by a public utility to
fund a beneficial
electrification plan shall go
into effect 30 days after
filing, unless suspended.
by the commission.
The commission may suspend the
effective date or the time
provided for suspension of the
tariff associated with the
companion plan with which the
beneficial electrification plan
is filed. So, going back to the
language of a tariff writer
proposed by a public utility to
fund a beneficial
electrification plan shall go
into effect 30 days after filing
unless suspended. So it's
basically stating that the BE
plan shall go into effect unless
it is specifically suspended by
the PR.
If the PRC steps in here and
says, wait, we're not happy with
this plan. We want you to go
back and more detail whatnot.
So, um, it, this is, this is a
directive to the PRC
specifically. Um, and so it,
the, the plan will go into
effect unless the PRC expressly
states that it does not want it
to.
And with that we'll also
become tariff writers and
increases in base rates.
Madam Chair, representative, the
plan was approved.
And the plan says that
That we will need a tariff
rider.
And 2 years down the road.
We will
expect these improvements.
As a consequence.
Oh
The approval of the plane.
That terrier can go in effect.
30 days after the filing.
Yeah, but it may be 2 years
before.
The consumer actually receives
any benefit.
From whatever the plan proposed.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, I
think I understand now. So I
think it's really, really
important for us to keep the two
different parts that we're
talking about with regards to
this bill, separate. So the
first part is the distribution
system planning, think of that
as the pre-ordering of the
transformers, how we're gonna
get that electricity from the uh
transmission line to the home.
That's all distribution system
planning. This is beneficial
electrification planning.
So what this has to do with
specifically, manager, senator
is, um,
Uh, utility can offer voluntary
incentive plans that a customer
can.
Opt into.
As part of the um energy
efficiency standards, right? So
if someone wants to uh replace
their gas stove with a lot more
efficient electric stove and the
utility wants to offer a rebate
for that. That's what we're
talking about within the scope
of beneficial of the beneficial
electrification. We're not
talking about the scope of
distribution system planning,
which would be
Which would be building out the
infrastructure. So even if a
tariff rider were to go into
effect, let's say that it's
approved within that 30 days,
um, that.
The customer could see the
availability of a rebate or
another program as as decided
upon and set forth by the
utility.
Right away within that year.
That
I, I, I think that's where
we're.
Miscommunicating, so it's the
customer chooses not to
participate.
What is the circle.
Well, I'm sorry, the the
customer chooses not to
participate.
In whatever energy.
Efficiency program might be out
there.
What does, what is the, what are
the consequences then to that
customer with respect to this
character.
Madam Chair and senator and I'll
I'll let my expert, um, correct
me if I'm, if I'm wrong, the all
the customers of that utility
would be subject to the tariff
writer or the base rate
increase.
Regardless of whether or not
they opt in to the program, but
whether or not they opt into the
program is entirely voluntary
and up to them.
Am I correct?
Mm
OK.
That's all the questions I have
for now. Thank you.
Thank you. I know.
Who else? I'm sorry, who she had
on the list.
Um
Yes, we are.
We're still on the amendment to
this bill.
Is there any further discussion
on
I'm sorry the amendment.
There is a motion and a second
for the amendment.
And from the committee, any
further discussion on the
amendment, Senator Cervantes.
I'm sure, I'm looking at the
amendment paragraph 6, and this
would be new language that would
be inserted and says uh talks
about a beneficial electrical
plan filed.
with other plans shall be acted
upon.
Within the time provided for the
companion plan.
With which the beneficial
electrification plan as well.
What is the companion plan?
Um, Madam Chair, Senator
Cervante, So in this case, it
would be the energy efficiency
plan that the that the utility
is already required to file with
the PRC. All the information
that would be submitted as part
of the beneficial
electrification plan would just.
Uh, supplement.
We just supplement that, that
plan that already needs to be
filed with the PRC. OK, so, so
is there a clear understanding
that that's what that would be
is when it says a companion
plan, that is the energy
efficiency plan, Madam Chair,
Senatorante is correct.
And, and how do we know that
from the bill?
the amendment.
It's just as it's follow with a
companion plan.
So I'm trying to figure out what
is, what do we know what the
companion? You're telling me you
know what it is.
Curious how do, how do I do it?
Madam Chair, Senator, so the
The, I think the original
language in the bill cited the
statute where the energy
efficiency plans are described,
the PRC in our multiple
discussions we had with them
requested that we be a little
less.
Uh, prescriptive in our language
there and say uh and that's, and
you know how that goes over with
me. I just love.
prescriptive, uh,
to, to put in language that
So at the discretion of the
direction of the commission.
Um, and then with those
companion plans.
It's our understanding that that
does not
Remove the intention that it is
our expectation they would go
with the energy efficiency
plans. Um.
To, to limit the kind of
Uh, casework that the PRC has to
do um to streamline that effort.
And if I may, Madam Chair, uh,
Senator Savante, so I'm looking
at the amendments in context,
page 12, subsection B.
Um, at least every 3 years or as
directed by the Commission on
Electric Public Utility shall
file an application with the
commission for a beneficial
electrification plan in
conjunction with other plans
filed with the commission
pursuant to rules adopted
pursuant to Section 6217-5, uh,
and I believe that is the
efficient use of Energy Act.
In Mount however that you disend
would strike out that three-year
requirement, is that right?
Leave that up to the uh
rulemaking authority of the
commission.
you're taking out that 3-year
requirement?
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator
Cervantes. Now my understanding
is that in the original bill,
there was a 180 day requirement
for the PRC to act, um, after
submission of the beneficial
electrification plans, so this
amendment just struck that.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm stand
corrected, Madam Chair, a
senator. It also removes the 3
year.
see your second paragraph of the
amendment, you're taking out
that 3 years.
And you're saying, you're
essentially saying as the as the
commission determines
effectively. So what it says um
your second paragraph of this
amendment we're considering
right now says on page 12 line
1, striking at least every 3
years, right?
isn't that what we're talking
about?
Mr. Chairman, Madam Chairman,
Senator Cervantes would help if
I was looking at the original
copy of the bill with line line
numbers.
So we were we were to adopt the
amendment in paragraph 2
specifically.
On page 12, it would instead of
reading at least every 3 years.
It would just say as directed by
the commission shall file
application.
That is man.
Madam Chair, Senator Chante,
that is correct, pursuant to the
rules of the beneficial
electrification of the, the um
efficient use of Energy Act. And
that's where it reads it in
conjunction with other plans.
Madam Chair, Senator, yes.
Aren't you striking that out
also.
Isn't that in your amendment as
well too, I think you on page
12.
Striking
In paragraph 3 you're striking
line 5, you're striking
everything from pursuant after
pursuant to striking all of that
line and through line 60 you're
striking out the reference to
that sexually you're saying
you're relying upon, aren't you?
This month.
It's not, it's not what uh
Paragraph 3 of your amendment
does.
Madam Chair, Senator Santisa,
forgive me the way my binder is
organized. I'm trying to find
the original.
Bill with my, with my numbers,
which would really help me out
here.
I think I have it here, man.
OK, so going to number 3, Madam
Chair, Senatorvante, page 12,
line 5.
After the first occurrence of 2.
Strike the remainder of the line
and strike lines 6 through 1978.
So it's the original language
was other plans filed with the
commission pursuant to rules
adopted pursuant to Section
6217-5.
Um
And a certain and lie thereof
rule.
So it now should read with other
plans filed with the commission
for pursuant to rule, period.
So it would mentor, Senator, you
are correct, it would strike
reference to that particular
efficient use of energy act.
citation. Right, so earlier when
I was asking what is the
definition of the submitted
plan, you're saying it is the
energy efficient uh statute, and
then you said the reason that we
would know that is because of
this language that's in there
that refers to that section,
you're striking out that
section, and now we don't have
that reference.
Man, uh Senator, you are
correct, but there is another
reference. My expert is
prepared, has a key keyed up.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator.
So I just want to point out that
we're, we're adding this section
into the efficient use of Energy
Act.
So
Referring
to the rules pursuant.
to the
A were in to the statue we're
in, I think is what the PRC was
trying to do, right, this isn't
a separate.
part of New Mexico statute where
where amending the efficient use
of Energy Act itself.
So we're, we're staying within
the rules filed pursuant.
The the the reason I'm trying to
focus on this one part of your
amendments representative and
senator is
That, that there's a reference
here then in that some same
paragraph 6 it says a tariff
writer.
proposed by a public utility to
fund a beneficial
electrification plans. You'll
see, you'll see where I'm
reading along there too. So what
I'm reading here is a public
utility can.
Propose a rider to pay for the
beneficial electrification plan,
and it says it shall go into
effect.
Within 30 days after filing.
unless suspended by the
commission.
So all the utility, public
utility has to do is file.
This beneficial plan writer and
that writer then becomes imposed
on the ratepayers.
Automatically
Unless the commission acts
affirmatively to stop it.
Unless the PRC does specifically
Stop the process or ask the
utility to
Go back and refile the plan for
any reason. The language is,
yes, automatically the proposed
writer, um, shall go into effect
30 days after filing.
Yeah, that seems, uh, not the
way we ever do things with the
commission. Usually with the
commission, you go to the
commission and say we'd like
permission to charge the
ratepayers more money.
For the utility services.
And here you're saying, all the
utility has to do is ask for it
and they get it unless the
commission stops them and it's
kind of a reverse burden here
whereas right now the burdens on
utility to prove up and get the
commission to approve it here,
it's approved unless the
commission stops it, which it
seems to me like I'm kind of a
reverse way of of doing things.
Try not to look at Mario out in
the back, nodding her head, but
I'm checking to see if I'm
reading this thing, right?
Sometimes I agree with you,
Meryl, uh, but, but, but in this
one, I look, I think, I think
I'm reading this right and I
think I'm not.
Affirmatively. That's what this
does, so I, I'm, I think I've
got the answer to my question. I
couldn't support the amendment
for that reason.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator
Cervantes, if my expert may just
very quickly.
Could your expert tell me who he
is again? I've missed the
beginning because of other
business.
Um, Madam Chair, this is Michael
Kenny from Western Resource
Advocates. OK, and your first
name and last name?
Michael Kenny.
OK, thank you. Yeah.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator.
So this is language.
That is standard in
Most PRC.
Kind of cost collection when
we're talking about tariffs.
terror fighters don't
immediately go into effect their
suspended until the plan is
approved.
So
This was language we got
directly from the PRC. This is
not something we
tried to negotiate with them.
This was, this was their request
for the standard language they
use for tariff writers.
And I'm sorry, man, I'm sure
you, you just introduced your
last name again to me, sir.
What's your last name, please?
Kenny.
Your last name is Ken. Kenny.
Like Secretary Kenny,
no, no relation.
Yeah, so, what you just said is
you said that the PRC language
that you borrowed this from
typically says that a, a writer.
proposed is suspended so the
plan is approved, but that's not
what this says.
You're saying you borrowed that
from PRC language, but that's
not this. This, this doesn't say
the, the tariff was suspended
until approved. It says the
opposite. It says it's effective
unless suspended, whole
different thing.
entirely different bird.
Madam Chair Senator Cervantes,
um,
I agree with you, but just to
reiterate what Mr. Kinney has
stated, I mean, this is, this is
foreign language that we had
negotiated directly with the
PRC.
So, um,
I mean, I, I'm.
I'm just an airplane lawyer, uh,
Madam Chair, Senator Cervantes,
they've learned more about
public utilities law than I'd
ever care to in the last 10
months as a result of this bill,
but again, um, the, this
specific term, these terms in
this language was negotiated
with the PRC and it is my
understanding Maam chair
Senator, that, um, it is foreign
language. There is nothing
particularly different, odd or
strange with.
With what is included in this
bill, yeah, and I don't know how
to address that because they're
not here, right? PRC here?
Yeah
And I don't know what would be.
is pulling from. But again, I'm,
I'm, I think I'm right about
this. I think the burden is
usually on the utility to prove
up a basis for a rate increase
or a tariff or a rider, and here
this says all they do is they
apply for it with their utility
plan and it goes into effect
unless the commission stops it.
And I think that's a
Never heard of that burden
shifting before.
In connection with the writer,
you, you, you may tell me that.
Standard that was negotiated.
They don't, to be honest, and,
and if, and if, and if it, if if
that was something that
negotiated, I would be shocked
because then the PRC is not
doing their job. They're
essentially saying, we're gonna
let these raiders and tariffs
take effect automatically, we do
nothing.
And it should, it should never
work that way. The government
sometimes slow, sometimes they
make mistakes, sometimes they
forget, sometimes whatever. And
here the default is if the, if
the commission doesn't do
something affirmatively, becomes
effective automatically.
distance the right way
government they should, they
should have to do their job.
Let things happen.
Without their, their rules.
Anyway, I'm sure I think I'd be
labored long. I couldn't support
the amendment.
Thank you. Uh, would somebody
please, uh, go out and ask
Senator Lopez and sinners out if
they want to come in for a vote
on the amendment. They're doing
some business for the committee.
Madam Cha should be clear.
Parts of your amendment that I
do think are good and would
agree with, but that one section
of the of the amendment I I
couldn't, I, I, I think I
I do like the paragraph 2, which
is
Right now
You're striking that at least
every 3 years.
as and you're, you're just
replacing that with ads. That's
Probably a good idea because
you've already kind of got that
language in, in the bill at page
12 anyway, so you really just
kind of taking out superfluous
language, right? You're, it says
right now it says at least every
3 years or as directed by the
commission, you're taking out
the every 3 years. I'm just
saying as directed by the
commission. So you, I love
getting rid of words and
statutes cause the lawyer have
to know all that stuff.
Less language, the better.
Thank you, Madam chair and
Senator, uh, not to be believe
belabor the point, um, I mean.
Uh, this, I mean, again, the
point of this was negotiated
with the PRC to allow them the
flexibility they needed to
ensure that we had a rule that
they that they could um
effectively carry out, but also
within the etho the ethos of
this bill, which is to get
things moving quicker for grid
modernization, because one of
the reasons why we have had
access to power issues is
because of some of the
regulatory burdens that a lot of
our utilities have had to face.
So.
Thank you. So, uh, Senator,
we're gonna go to the vote on
the amendment.
The amendment is 0.231897.1, we
have a motion by
Senator Charlie and a 2 by
Senator Pope.
And I'm asking the committee
secretary to take the vote on
the amendment only.
San Cervantes.
Oh, I'm gonna vote yes, but I'm
sure, but I'd like to explain my
vote.
Senator Charlie,
yes.
And Charlie, yes, Sanzel.
Oh, yes, and I have been.
excuse and our Pope.
No.
Pope, no, Senator Scott.
There's got, no, Senator
Townsend.
Sanya Lopez.
Yes
Well, it's back to the truth.
Senator Townsend.
So a deal. I mean, Senator
Townsend, no.
Townsend, no, said Dea Lopez.
Yes, explained my vote.
And the lupus, yes, centers of
phonics. Uh, no.
That's the phonics, no.
OK, so Senator Cervantes to
explain his vote.
so as I said, uh representative
senators, some parts of the
amendment are good things for
people and some are not. So the
first paragraph extends the
deadline from December of 25 to
June of 26. That's probably
better. There's more time to
stand up this if you're gonna do
it. And so I think that that's
probably a good thing.
Um, and then you've striking out
some superfluous language,
that's probably a good thing
too, but the, the idea of
enacting a tariff automatically,
um, it's a bad thing and so, uh,
yeah, again, when you give me an
amendment that's got good things
and bad things. It's really hard
for me to reconcile that. I hope
you'll come around and, and get
rid of that uh subsection 6 or
maybe consider a motion to
consider your amendment without
that, so.
Uh, Senator Sua Lopez to explain
her vote. The reason I voted for
it is because it was adopted by
House Judiciary. I, I have some
problems with some of this, but
They adopted it, so I wanted to
support them.
Thank you. So the amendment lays
on the table. It was a 44, so
back to the bill.
Uh, senator Savia Lopez, you
were running the committee, did
we go to support from the
audience
on the OK, not on the bill just
how many people in the audience
are here to support this bill.
I'm gonna count hands, please
keep them up. 123456789.
10.
How many people are here to
oppose this bill in the room.
123.
OK, how many people online?
Two people in support. OK, so
let's have um
uh
How many opponents were there?
How many did I say? I already
forgot this, OK.
So let's have uh 3 supporters
and whatever opponents there are
in the room. The supporters,
please.
On the bill.
A cured this
Uh, it is not amended by us.
That's correct.
Thank
Before.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, John Lipshutz
with the New Mexico Federation
of Labor. Uh, we do stand in
support of this bill. We thank
the sponsor for bringing it up,
uh, as explained in the
presentation, we view this as a
great opportunity to provide
very good high paying jobs, uh,
to a sector that really could
use that, um, not to mention it
will also help modernize a grid
that is desperately needed
during this, uh, transition of
energy. So for those reasons, we
urge your support.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, uh, Madam
Chairman, members of the
committee. My name is Jim
Dejardin. I'm the executive
director of the renewable Energy
Industries Association. Thank
you to the sponsor for leading a
diverse stakeholder group over
months called Power Up New
Mexico. This bill does many
things to upgrade our electrical
distribution system, including
requiring utilities to file
electrical distribution plans to
the PRC measuring the capacity
of their lines and provide
updated interconnection
procedures. But what this still,
what I'm sorry
What this bill does for everyone
is it directs the Percy to put
in measures so we can have
needed modern and robust
electrical distribution system
to better enable economic
development in our great state.
Thank you very much. I do.
Thank you.
Good morning, uh, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Justin Garroot. I'm the
climate and energy advocate with
Conservation Voterss New Mexico
and we stand in strong support
of this bill. Thank you.
Thank you. And as I mentioned,
there were 2 people online will
note their support. Now let's go
to opposition in the room. If
there's 3 people, we'll hear
from 3 people.
Good afternoon, um, Madam Chair
and committee members. My name
is Marilyn Lanai and on behalf
of 5000 new energy economy
members. I think that there's
the intention of this bill is
good, but there's lots of real
problems, including the fact
that basically section 1 F for
instance, the commission shall
approve a distribution system
plan and then make ratepayers
pay for it without, without
analysis.
Section 3, which I think should
be complete. It's section 3F
should be completely eliminated.
It's duplicative, it's
unnecessary and like the FIR
says this could, and this is a
quote from FIR HB 13 allows
public utilities to recover
reasonable costs associated with
distribution system upgrades and
beneficial electrification
programs to tariff riders, base
rates, or a combination of both
approved by the PRC, while it's
hard to determine the.
actual cost, Peary may have to
approve plans that while
increasing grid reliability
could cost millions of dollars
to utility companies, which will
increase rates to ratepayers. So
what this is a big problem
because it encourages and
incentivizes overbuild and
potentially unnecessary capital
expenditure spending because it
guarantees cost recovery. Uh,
just so you know, and it, it, it
EPE about 50
of the uh energy efficiency
programs goes to administration.
This is an unacceptably wasteful
use of ratepayer funds. The
beneficial electricity,
electrification plan follows a
similar structure to the EE
programs. Parameters are
necessary to prevent waste.
Thank you.
Thank you. Next, please, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
my name is Gerald Wain. I'm vice
president at New Mexico Gas
Company. I'm also a registered
lobbyist for the company. We do
agree with the sponsor that
electric grid modernization is a
priority, but that's only one
aspect of this bill.
I'm here to oppose HB 13 because
a major focus in sections 2 and
3 is beneficial electrification,
defined as converting the energy
source of a customer's end use
from a non-electric fuel source
to a high efficiency electric
source. HB 13 directs
investor-owned electric
utilities power plants with the
PRC to achieve that beneficial
electrification. It further
directs the PRC to improve such
plans as well as the recovery of
costs for what's described as
voluntary adoption, inducing
people to
and natural gas service means
those who continue to count on
us for reliable, affordable
energy, we'll pay more because
NMGC still has the obligation to
maintain for them the system we
operate. Taken as a whole HB 13
will increase electric bills and
also cause higher natural gas
bills for our customers. Thank
you.
Thank you. Any other opposition?
OK, we're going to
Questions, comments from
committee members, Senator
Townsend told me he had a lot of
questions.
The morning representative.
I
More than one.
But what can you explain to me
in your title.
You were establishing virtual
power.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator
Townsend, I believe that was
struck with the amendment that
took out what was section, I
believe, 4, which is the virtual
power plant portion of the pill
that is completely removed.
Did you remove it out of it?
Um, madam chair, uh, Senator.
Yes, it is. It was uh removed in
the House Energy and Natural
Resources Committee amendment.
Yeah.
helped so much.
Um
It causes me to ask.
is not pertaining to the bill
more the world is virtual power.
Madam Chair, Senator, we can
skip that whole discussion,
which I'm sure will make your
chairwoman very happy.
That probably would make you
very happy.
Um
We heard testimony, um,
That I believe is correct based
on what I've heard or that.
The driver.
this
Bill.
His great modernization.
And
And a tool that utilities use.
Um
To
Recover those costs, is that
correct?
Madam Chair, Senator, that is
correct.
And
Madam Chair
Um
Can you
Describe those things that you
probably don't want to.
Now what types of charges could
take company.
Add to a
Bill
Um
That may be outside of grid.
Uh, madam chair, Senator, I'm
gonna defer to my expert because
I.
Oh.
Madam Chair, Senator, so
These distribution system plans
would not be generally things
beyond what you're already.
Probably paying for as part of
your utility bill, your're
paying for transformers, you're
paying for lines and poles.
Um
What it would do is place
requirements that the utility
forecast.
Where they have deficiencies and
where they need to invest.
ly out of budget to make those
investments. So as opposed to
Here where there, today they're
being reactive to those needs,
this kind of
Flips it and they have to be a
little more proactive about
showing where there is a need.
And how they're going to address
it.
Madam Chair Representative
Senator.
skinny.
Doesn't it also
Oh
the
to recover costs that they
currently can't.
And if that's not the truth, if
that's not true, then what are
we doing here?
Thank you Madam chair, senator.
So,
It does allow for
Uh, pre-purchasing, which are a
little more flexibility to
pre-purchase equipment, which
they currently
can't do, but that charge
doesn't go into effect until
that equipment is useful.
So, giving the utility
discretion to make a purchase
gets out in front of these wait
times that they currently face.
But Madam chair.
I bet you, um, I'd cover a bed
with you that if you go down to
I use PMEM. I don't know if
they're in the room or not. I go
down to PNM's office and look in
their utility yard where they
store equipment. I bet they got
a rack of transformers already
set down there.
They, I mean, they don't need
anymore.
Transformers, I mean.
They, they normally keep
Transformers.
wire into their on staff.
Controlled, I mean, that's part
of their normal.
B. I mean, everybody does.
Nobody but
have a huge utility of the
largest utility.
Company in New Mexico without.
parts
Madam Chair, Senator Townsend,
um, where I agree with you
that's correct to a certain
point. What is different with
this bill is having
Enough infrastructure on hand to
um fix a part of the grid or to
maintain the grid as to its
current state, that's one thing,
but what this bill is
specifically asking.
For the utilities to do is to
plan increase
The, um,
The amount of time and the
foresight that they normally
would be looking to to allow.
For grid modernization over a
longer period of time. So more
expansion and greater
augmentation to allow for more
connection to the grid than just
simply maintaining the status
quo. So where you're correct,
I'm sure they do have some
transformers.
tucked away in a closet
somewhere, that's not going to
get you to the point of grid
modernization and augmentation
that we're asking for in this
bill.
But man, excuse me one second.
For the audience, this is the
last bill. We will go through
this bill and the rest will be
rolled over to Tuesday, so if
you're here for another bill, I
just wanted to let you know, and
it is our everybody here has
been excused from the floor and
um we're gonna go out through
this one, however long.
Yeah
Madam chair, thank you for that.
Um,
Representative, I, I was
It was
Interested when I had organized
labor stand up.
support like utility bill
seemed.
Unusual, and I got to looking
through the field and I now see
why they are doing that. This
requires prevailing wage for
those projects, doesn't it?
Man, uh, Senator Townsend, yes,
it does.
Madam Chair and representative.
What do you think that does to
the end user cost of
electricity.
Uh, Madam Chairman, uh, Senator
Townsend, a lot of these jobs
are already very technical and
require a high level of skill
training to begin with. And so,
um, it's, it's not like uh we're
requiring huge increases in
salary or benefits or payments.
It's just simply um ensuring
that those workers who would be
retained for these projects are
paid.
What they're worth.
And get access to the benefits
that that that.
They should have access to
because again, these are very
highly technical jobs. So, Madam
Chair and representative, I take
from that that you don't think
they're being paid like that.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, I
don't know if they're being paid
like that currently, um, it's,
that's not really quite the
question. The question is
whether or not they're
guaranteed to be paid that
amount.
Madam Chair and Representative,
do you believe that?
I
more efficient grid
modernization to occur.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, I know
that that would be one part of
attracting a workforce that
already needs to be greatly
grown, um, as I, Madam Chair,
senator, you've been serving in
this body for quite some time,
and I know that you know that
one of the biggest issues we
face in this state is workforce
and human capital. So this would
just be one tool in the toolbox
to um attract people to um come
in to this area of work and
ensure that they can make a good
living from it.
and make a uh entire um career
out of it, because this is what
it's going to necessitate in
order to get the grid to where
we need it.
I, um,
Representative that's probably
conversation.
Or some day goes that far.
I look forward to that, but
Um, Madam Chan representative.
With these.
Provisions
Just like preventing, being able
to order equipment or late that
they.
recover.
As
Because the FIR.
Or have you
Um
looked at the impact on the
A price to the consumer.
Um, Madam chair Senator, um, if
that is in the FIR I don't
recall seeing it, but I think
it's important to bring into
this conversation that we need
to be looking at both sides of
the ledger when considering this
bill and considering the
projects that would be
specifically funded through this
bill. So we're not just talking
about huge price increases and
costs of infrastructure
development for all the
development that we succeed with
their.
going to be more ratepayers
paying into the system, looking
at the other side of the ledger.
And so, you know, with each
expenditure, there's also going
to be money coming in from those
expenditures, so we can't look
at this simply as one large
expenditure that the state and
or the utilities or the
ratepayers are never going to
see come back to them. It's
immediately gonna start coming
back to them, the more that we
see connection or increases in
connection to the grid.
Are you
Just say that this is going to
increase the population of New
Mexico.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, my
testimony today is that this is
gonna increase the number of
people that have access to
regular and sufficient energy
throughout the state of New
Mexico, Madam Chair and
Representative, can you quantify
that amount to? Can you tell me
how many people do not have.
Electricity available.
Or electricity that's going to
be better.
Madam Chair, Senator, I can't
quantify that number to you, but
I can tell you that, uh, many of
the reasons that led me to carry
this piece of legislation
while we conversations I had
with several various agencies
and individuals and advocates,
one of them having to do with
economic development through the
state, specifically the trade
ports on Bernao County in that,
um, I, we simply do not have the
power or access to the power
necessary or say the I-40 trade.
report to succeed in in the
grid's current form. So, uh,
because we know that we have to
do, we have to do this, this at
some point. I'm Sheriff senator,
it's, it is absolutely critical
to New Mexico's development as a
state and as we continue to look
for various sources to diversify
our revenue throughout the
state, Madam Chair, and, um,
Senator, one of the ways that we
will only be able to do that is
by ensuring we have a.
robust and flexible and uh
evolutionary grid for economic
development.
To succeed, otherwise there will
be none.
Madam Chair Representative.
Or
30 or 40 years that I've been.
Um, watch utilities build out.
They always have a cost recover.
Um
appendage to both buildouts, and
that build out is, is paid for
by that developer by that
business, and I don't think it's
right that we spread this out
under a rate writer that the
that the population.
As a whole
pays for something that is worth
specific business that just
doesn't seem, I mean, this is a
giveaway to a
A corporation.
To, to undermine their upfront
costs in the development. That's
problematic.
So
Tell me why
I mean, I understand what you
said.
I don't agree with it, but I
understand what you said, but
when you filled out to a new
community or to a business, that
company and that, and that
developer pays for that
infrastructure.
Why should we allow that to be
Spread out over the population
of ratepayers that aren't even
in, maybe not even in the same.
Zip code town.
Why should we do that? Um, Madam
Chair, Senator Townsend, so
first of all, we, we are already
doing that.
All this, all this bill does is
just
Increase or allow utilities,
another tool in their toolbox to
assist them in making the
improvements that they already
intend to make.
But this gives them.
An easier path and more of a
specified path to do so. So,
increases in, and, and base
rates and tariff riders are
common.
There is a very specific
prescribed process through the
PRC for such tariff riders and
base rates to be increased. We
are not asking that that process
be changed in any way. We're not
asking that any discretion be
taken away from the PRC, whose
main um uh it's a PRC's job to,
to protect consumers. We are not
asking to mess with any part of
that equation at all, Madam
Chair Representative, all we're
asking for is for our timelines.
be drawn out and for these plans
to be more robust and to have
more transparency as to how
these goals would be achieved
and the time frame in which we
hope to achieve them. So, again,
this is, this is already
happening.
Senator. This is not uncommon.
Ma
chair is representative.
I go back to my
Earlier upon me, if this is
already happened.
And build out as a crane in an
orderly.
Fashion.
For developers are
Putting up.
to move the be.
New business coming in.
this required and
Answer has been
And representative.
And,
I don't you think I'm
sideswiping the representative
on on her bill.
We had a conversation about
this, and I told her I didn't
think this was good public
policy, so I think she came
prepared for the debate. He
always has, so with that said,
Representative, I, I do think
That the PRC and
providers across New Mexico.
Have the tools.
Provide infrastructure build
out.
Part of the problem
And maybe Mr. Kenny can address
this.
is the grid modernization need
is maybe the real driver in
this.
Not build out. Is that correct?
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator,
so the, the real
Issue at hand here, you know, I
agree with you that utilities,
they obviously making
investments in their
distribution system.
Otherwise, we would all probably
be sitting in the dark, um, but
that planning is done.
Within the utility, not at the.
Purview, overview of the PRC
beyond the cost recovery.
After the fact
And there is no
Public plan filed that any
stakeholders get a chance to
review about how those
investments are being made to
understand where power is needed
or could
could be wanted.
So that is what this
Part of the bill is filling is
that gap that there is no
Oversight
Ahead of time of these
investments, why are they
necessary?
That's, I, I.
chair and
Representative
That is replies in direct
conflict, but.
I mean
This was, I, I thought I was
led.
Or at least I understood that
the reason we were doing this
was to give him a tool.
So that they could do it.
I get that.
But now you're telling me it's
really not for that. It's so
they can tell you first, so you
can have oversight on what
they're doing.
And I'm trying to figure out
Are, are we trying to add a
burden to
A utility for build out? Are we
trying to add a tool for him for
buildout.
Madam Chair, um, Senator
Townsend, so two different
things can be true at the same
time.
Um, so, and one, on one hand,
Distribution planning.
It's mostly done and to make a,
a bad metaphor in the dark.
There is not a lot of
transparency as it relates to
How these utilities plan their
distribution. That's simply
something that they do in-house
and then they go through the
rate recovery process. So one of
the things that this bill is
aiming to fix is to make that
process transparent and to
require the utilities to file
plans with the PRC so that the
PRC and the people of New
Mexico.
Can one see where power is. This
is information that we don't
have.
Which is shocking, but true.
One, see where power already
exists. 2, see where power still
needs to exist, and 3, how these
utilities plan to get there. So
there's on, on one hand, that is
one thing that we're trying to
do.
At the same time, on the other
hand, we are trying to give the
utilities these tools to allow
them to
Uh, build out and modernize the
grid to meet the standards as
specified in these plans as they
would be submitted to the
submitted and approved by the
PRC.
So it is, it is.
It is both.
So, Madam Chair and
representative did this bill.
This idea comes from the PRC or
from a utility.
Or did you?
Just
Go. I don't mean to take away
from.
Your ability to make it.
No, not, um, senator, so this
actually, this bill's a result
of um over 60 stakeholders
convening over a period of 10
months. Uh, we had biweekly
meetings and um I, I don't know
why they weren't here today, but
Xcel Energy is in um they
support the bill. They were very
instrumental in the Power Up
Colorado bill, which is similar
to, but um also very different
to our bill here because we
wanted to.
make sure it was right size for
New Mexico, but, um, the
utilities, all participated in
that process, including Excel,
El Paso Electric, and P&M, um,
we had Western resource
advocates, we had, uh, the nat
the uh natural Resources Defense
Council. We've had Volvo trucks
of America. We've had, uh, the
American Association of Retired
Persons, I mean anybody who
wanted to participate in this
process, manager and Senator
Townsend, they were allowed to.
and were able to do so. So this
was the result of, I mean, we
had.
Bernalillo County Economic
Development, we had uh the uh M
nerd folks, the the environment
department, I mean, PRC was
consulted. We tried very, very
hard, Madam chair, Senator, over
a very long period of time to
put this bill together in a way
that it was um workable and
would make a difference to a
very real problem that um we see
as being identified here in the
state.
Madam chair and representative
can you, uh,
go into a little bit on the
definition that is used for
beneficial.
I'm going to defer to my expert
who's got it right in front of
them, Senator, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. Um, so beneficial
electrification as
To find there you you have in
front of you so I won't read it
out, but
It's essentially stating moving
a customer from
A non-electric fuel source, so
whether that be propane or
Natural gas to a high efficiency
electric source.
Um, that is the definition as
it's been.
Uh amended
And um, Madam Chair and Mr.
Kenny, who did you say you
worked for?
Um, Madam Chair,
I work for Western Resource
advocates.
You guys are selling natural
gas.
Propane.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, no.
Adam chair and
Any,
do you just
I
Um, I'm sure senator, no.
So, Madam Chair.
Any
But you,
but
But your role, I mean.
Why are you supporting this?
What do you do? Yeah.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, uh, we
do, we are not in the energy uh
buying and selling business, we,
we are a uh
Clean energy economy.
Advocacy group.
So I work across New Mexico.
Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, Utah,
trying to
Improve the
Air, water, and land of those
citizens.
So, Mr.
chair is representative other
than promoting.
The electrification.
Holmes.
What other kind of projects do
you do that helps clean up.
Mexico.
is this related to the bill now
it's what is his testimony. He
just said that's what they do,
OK.
Please be brief and
Let's finish this topic.
Um, Madam Chair Senator.
My work involves energy
efficiency. My work involves
grid modernization, it involves
uh understanding.
Things like beneficial
electrification, but that is one
component of, of my job, Madam
Chair, and McKinney. I, I, I
would tell you that, um.
But I think.
Happening
A
Organization
is utilizing.
the legislature.
In a manner that it's gonna
drive up the cost.
electricity to people that are
fixed incomes.
are stranded in rural parts of
New Mexico.
It's going to cause
Electricity rates to go up.
no other way around it or
ordering him new opportunities
for recovery and were
were mandating a higher
on labor.
Antily since being done.
I, I, um, I don't believe that
this legislature should be used.
Um, to.
help any industry.
And we shouldn't be picking and
choosing who the winners.
And I will.
I will stop right there.
Madam Chair. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Uh, who would like to be next?
Senator Scott
Senator Mandisa, are you gonna
want to speak on this?
OK. Center shop.
Madam chair.
Representative, I'm going to
start.
With the subject that has ab.
Nothing to do.
With the electrification of the
state.
All of the information that I
have ever been able to.
Delight
On prevailing wage.
And we'll go through the math.
Indicates that
On these build-out projects.
parts
account for about 50% of the
project cost.
Labor accounts.
For about
50% of the project.
Mm
Prevailing wage.
Bumps
Labor
about
30%
If we just go through the math.
We're increasing the cost of all
of these build out projects.
Plans
By 15%.
Which means that
New Mexico consumers.
Paying electricity.
A riders will be.
Or rape bases will be.
15%.
Above
What they would
Otherwise needed to be.
So
Mountain chair and
representative I.
I have spent
Some considerable amount of time
amongst my.
Electric cooperatives.
I know that they train their
people.
And pay their people well, and
that's.
And that's evidenced by the fact
that their employees are
basically there.
Or a career
In most cases.
So there, they're happy.
With their employment situation
and what they're being paid, and
there is absolutely
No reason
To insert.
State wage mandates.
End of this piece of
legislation.
No reason
And that chair and
representative, I'll give you an
opportunity to respond if you.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator, um, so you and I are
going to agree that in a lot of
these projects and a lot of
these um job requirements, they
are already being paid.
Quite high rates for skilled
positions and uh these are all
positions that are in great
demand, part of the reason for
this bill is to make those
positions and even higher
demand. So, um, the
The amount that we are paying
these folks is already high,
much higher than than any other
minimum wage job you would find.
However, one of the reasons why
um Xcel Energy has come out in
support of this bill, including
with its inclusion of the
prevailing wage provision is
that um they are already paying
these wages. They are very happy
with the results they have
gotten in terms of these wages
attracting talent, however, it
becomes an more of a recruitment
tool to ensure that the
prevailing wage is in the law.
it is, it is ensuring more
people would get access to these
higher rates. It would give them
peace of mind to know that they
would be guaranteed these higher
rates and it would also give
them peace of mind and would be
uh recruiting tool to um
Utilize the benefits that also
come along with prevailing
wages, so a lot of these jobs
also um come through their
journeyman positions, um, they
are, uh, created through
apprenticeship programs that
come through our unions, um, the
unions, in fact, especially in
the state of New Mexico, are one
of the higher training.
highest trainers of these types
of positions throughout the
state and so adding the
prevailing wage requirement in
this bill was just another way
to sig to signal to these folks
who want to come into this
industry and stay in this
industry, that their jobs would
be preserved, their wages would
be preserved, their benefits
would be preserved and it would
make them essentially masters of
their own destiny and that they
could also have access to
Um, the collective bargaining
process in case they ever want
to go back and renegotiate those
benefits and wages. So, um, not
in a, in a single instance, do
we know of a utility company not
being OK with the pain
prevailing wages because it gets
them a higher quality of can.
Madam chair representative.
All of their employees.
Or paid private sector.
Free market wages, and the
reason why those wages are so
high in those industries is that
Those are skilled positions.
It requires significant amount
of training.
And that will not change.
Regardless of whether the state
inserts itself.
Into those wage negotiations.
Which is exactly what
This piece of legislation does.
OK. That is one of my
objections.
Let's go to page, if we could,
page.
I'm on the
Bill with the amendments in
context.
Let's go to page 4.
B6.
And the house energy looks like
uh added.
Which may include
performance-based compensation.
For aggregated distributed
energy resources.
Madam chair and representative.
Could you describe that?
For the body in English.
Madam Chair, uh, Senator, I'm
gonna start and then I'm going
to turn over to Michael. So, um,
this language actually was what
the virtual power plant, virtual
power plant section of the bill
evolved into um to reflect the
current status of a lot of those
types of projects because it's a
nascent, um, nascent technology
and nascent industry, so
Michael, take it away as to
translating what this actually
means.
in English.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. I'll do my best.
Um, so I'll, I'll take it step
by step. So when we think of
aggregated, distributed energy
resources.
It's a lot of words to say.
So on your roof.
A battery at your home or
business could be your electric
vehicle.
Could be your air conditioner.
A lot of things fall under the
umbrella of a distributed energy
resource.
Something that uses energy or
can send energy onto the grid.
Um, and can be controlled.
So the performance-based aspect
would be you enroll in a program
voluntarily.
And you are compensated for that
enrollment based on your
performance.
So if I'm a
You know, a business owner and I
have a backup battery in my
business that
has, you know, power that I
don't need.
But maybe PNM needs some extra
power. I can send the
electricity from my battery onto
the grid, and PNM would
compensate me at a given rate
for that.
OK.
Madam Chair
Representative and expert, Mr.
Kinney.
Leave I thought that's what you
were going to say.
So
The premise
For this planned.
Bill out of distribution.
For modifications or upgrade.
To the distribution.
Or an absolute requirement.
For the efficient utilization of
these.
Distributed resources.
Is that an accurate
Thank you Madam Chair, Senator,
there's not a requirement, so it
says which may include those
performance-based compensation.
For those resources, so
As the utility designs their
plan, they can include that, but
there is no requirement that
they
Do.
OK.
But Adam chair representative
and Mr. Kenny.
That wasn't quite the question.
The question is,
These distribution system.
Upgrades
That are contemplated by these
plans.
would be an absolute
requirement.
For the efficient use.
Of these distributed resources
now moving power in multiple
directions.
Instead of
The system that we have now is
mostly from the utility to the
consumer.
Was that accurate statement?
Um, Madam Chair, Senator.
It would depend.
And that's part of the
requirement we have in the bill
here about the mapping.
Both hosting and load capacity
to understand.
What is possible with the
current grid conditions in a
given location, so.
If a homeowner or business owner
already has solar or wanted to
add a battery, wanted to add
solar, and the grid was fine to
handle it then, then there's
nothing that the utility needs
to do to upgrade.
That area, but it would depend
if
there is an upgrade needed to in
order to connect those services.
Madam chair, Senator, if I could
just kind of add a little bit
more in plain English, so it's
cheaper to pay people to use
batteries and solar systems
they've already bought and paid
for than it is to have the
utility go and buy more.
stuff.
So that's what that
Accept that
Madam Chair and Representative,
I absolutely do not agree with
that premise.
I don't
And the reason I don't is solar
panels.
packed up with batteries are not
just expensive, they are
hideously expensive and don't
survive in the marketplace
without subsidies.
So, accommodating.
Building a grid.
Building and distribution
system.
To accommodate
Inefficient power sources.
And then offering
performance-based compensation
for these is.
At the end of the day.
One of the very worst things you
can do for the New Mexico
consumer because
The regular folks that are not
participating in these programs
or having to pay.
For this grid
Mapping the grid that the
distribution system upgrades the
The bidirectional power flow,
whatever you want to call it,
new transformers and may not be
getting anything.
for their money. OK.
Let me go.
Let me go to the beneficial
electrification.
Which is, uh, as I read the bill
is an attempt.
To dissuade people.
From utilizing natural gas for
whatever reason.
Is that
One of the girls and objective.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
so one of the goals of
beneficial electrification is to
um, incentivize.
The use of energy sources that
are less carbon intensive or
emit less carbon emissions in
favor of energy sources that do
not.
So that is the concept of
beneficial electrification. OK,
Madam Chair and Representative,
do you cook on an electric
stove.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
I think it's great that you
assume I cook anything with that
with being in the legislature,
but, um, I, I, I've cooked on
both. My mother cooked on a gas
stove, um, my, I have a gas
stove myself, so, um, I
If I had the ability to
voluntarily, um, get a rebate
for an electric stove, but it's
definitely something that I
would consider.
He
Madam Chair representative, I
can assure you it'd be a step
backwards.
Cause I cook on electric stove.
And they are.
Nowhere comparable.
The natural gas fired appliance.
Terms
any, any cooking terms you wanna
use, they are just better
suited.
For that task
And there are a number.
Particularly
High efficiency units that need
to produce heat.
There are a number of
appliances, both
Small and large.
Or natural gas is the most
efficient, the cheapest.
The
The most environmentally
friendly piece of equipment you
can buy.
And, and that's reflected.
And not just the cost of the
Unit to purchase, but the
operating costs over the life of
the unit.
So
On
Madam Chair and Representative
on.
So many levels.
I, I find this piece of
legislation to be
except
And well, I appreciate the
answers.
I am afraid I will not under any
circumstances.
Be able to support it.
And if it gets out of this
committee, I will.
Tremendously enjoy.
Having this conversation on the
floor.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative for
your.
Madam Chair, Senator, you won't
be having it with me,
unfortunately.
So
Thank you very much. Um, Senator
Cervantes is out of the room,
are there other questions or
comments?
Nope.
He's still not here. Any other,
uh,
Center Cia Lopez.
I am
I, I like a lot about this bill.
There are some things, and I had
the same issue with the ETA.
Um, the taking the discretion
away from the PRC like when it's
um I know you said it doesn't
have shell, but it has shell.
Um
On page 4
Uh, line 2.
It is a commission shall approve
the distribution plan including
associates us. And so that
leaves the, the commission.
Um
If they find these things and
they have to.
They have to do that without
considering other factors, and I
just
I had the same issue um with,
with the ETA because
It is a constitutional agency,
and every time we limited its
authority, I understand that
Senator Senator Cervantes will
say, well, we're asserting our
power, um, I
You know, an agency, no, no, you
don't.
Um, you sound more like this.
Well, we're asserting our power.
Well, we usually don't.
Refer to each other like that in
committee, so we need to watch
it. Sorry, we're sorry, Madam
Chair.
So anyway, um, so that kind of,
could you explain why it's a
shell and not a me manager I'm
sure.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair, and,
and Senator C of Lopez. So there
are two different reasons for
that. So,
And I and trying to um make
these distinctions, um, Florida
on the floor debate on the
floor, um, was challenging
because there's a distinction
between what the utility shall
provide to the PRC as part of
these required plans and what
the PRC
shall
review as part of these plans.
Um, that
That is not.
The permissive that the there's
no permissiveness in that
language.
Get
clear what it is the PRC is
supposed to evaluate and look
for in these plans, um, cause it
give you kind of a little bit of
the inside baseball when we
were.
Formulating this language, we
met with the PRC.
And we actually submitted it to
them and they said it to us that
giving them less permissive
language in some instances is
good because it leaves them less
susceptible to challenges, you
know, appeals and mitigate that
risk. Um, some attorneys from uh
utilities that have looked at
this bill have actually told us
that put codifying this, this
stat in statue, what they're
already trying to promulgate and
rule with their grid mole.
It's, but it's good because it
becomes a constitutional mandate
for the grid module making it
without question clear that the
PRC had the constitutional power
to do so, to do this, um, which
and if without it, they would
have just promulgated the rule
and they may have been
susceptible to challenges that
they did not have the
constitutional ability to do so.
So, um, the shell again is just
making it crystal, perfectly
clear.
What the plans need to that the
plans need to be submitted. What
the plans need to have in them
and what the PRC shall consider
as part of these plans and if
these plans meet the
requirements, then they, the par
shall approve them. However,
there's absolutely nothing in
this language that is designed
to take away from the
discretion. The key discretion
that that body has. There's
nothing in this legislation that
tells the PRC that they have to
approve a plan that they feel
is.
Does not meet the requirements,
codified in the statute or
otherwise or their grid mod or
otherwise, at the end of the
day, Madam Chair, Senator, um,
if the, if these requirements
are not met or the PRC wants the
utility to go back and give more
information or reformulate or
simply feels that the tariff
writer or the base rate increase
would not be um appropriate
because part of their role is
also consumer protection, then
they
would have the power to do that.
And nothing in this legislate in
this legislation is designed to
change that or take that
discretion away.
That, that madam chairs what
concerns me is that shall
To me, in where it's placed,
they have to approve a
distribution plan as long as
they find it's reasonably
designed to maximize benefits
and minimize costs, which I
think is great. It's on page 4.
Uh, Lane 20 is reasonably
expected to allow the electric
public utility utility to
achieve the er energization I
guess time periods established
by the commission pursuant to
electric public utilities
proposed energization time
periods and the requirements of
subsection A of this section,
you can see why I ate uh this
reminds me of FERC work when I
used to work in DC. Very
difficult to, um, and is
reasonably expected to allow the
The elect public utility recover
its costs. So it is a consumer
protection bill and if, if the
Utility finds all of these
things, it seems to me that they
cannot consider the effect on
ratepayers.
And that
Bothers me.
Madam Chair, Madam Chair.
Senator Siio Lopez, I would, uh,
I would direct your attention to
page 5.
Subsection G.
And uh the language that was
struck out in the new language
which was added, I think and uh
OK, in the amendment, the
commission may direct an
electric public utility to
revise and resubmit a
distribution system plan and
associated costs.
OK, where is that? Is that in
the amendment? Page 5,
subsection G.
It's not in what I'm looking at.
Um,
Is it in the amendment? It's in
one of the amendments. It should
be in the house and one of the
house energy and Natural
Resources Committee amendments.
OK, let me see if I have that.
Mar.
Hey
I was, had this question
earlier, so it was in, it was in
an earlier committee than this
or this is not a sub.
So
I just want to make sure we're
on the same page because I'm not
reading the same thing.
At the same section.
I, I'm not seeing where you're,
what you're referring to.
Um
I'm sorry, if you could show me,
just tell me where it is, then
I'll look at it.
Like which amendment is that
Amendment one. I have that in
the book.
If you look at this side.
I have.
Is this Mr. Speaker?
Your energy, OK. Is it in this,
which I didn't have, um.
Is this your energy environment
and natural resources Committee.
Amendment, Madam Chair, uh,
Senator, yes.
OK.
I'm sorry. Perhaps, Madam Chair,
you should go to someone else
because
Where, which may.
You see?
Madam Chair, a senator, if you
could give us a sec, we're,
we're looking, this, this bill
has gone through so many
different iterations and I'm
looking at a version that has
this language you're looking at
a
Different version with other
language. He has different
versions, so if you give us just
maybe one minute to figure out,
get ours around this.
What you were reading is not,
so,
um, Representative, we really
appreciate your frustration, but
You know, the official, we love
amendments in context, but
The official piece.
is the bill with the pages and
the lines, and the adopted
amendments.
So when people refer to that,
that's really where they're
going. They're not looking at
amendments in context.
So, senator Savia Lopez, you
still have the floor before we
move on to someone else.
I think I found it. I believe
it's in House for Amendment
number 1.
Hm.
No.
It says March 6th House floor
Amendment number 1.
Madam Char Senator, I don't
believe there was any 4
amendments on this bill. Madam
Chair, Senator, if you look at
page 5 of the original bill.
Section G, line 6.
Original bills section.
What page?
OK.
5?
Page 5 switch line 6.
this show.
OK. In this it says an electric
public utility shall submit, and
which I understand that shells
was you're requiring the, the
utility to do. I understand that
show. I was referring to the
shell on page 4, line 20.
Manage, um, senator that
language has not changed. That
is correct. That shall still is
part of the language.
In and Madam Chair, Senator, so
where should we apologies.
They, they shall approve a plan
including associated costs that
meets
Those
You know, sub items of F.
But that does not take away.
The provision in G that
An electric utility shall
resubmit a plan.
But, you know, that the
commission uh determines to be
resubmitted.
Um, so there, there's not a
guarantee that they will meet
that requirement.
Absolutely, but if they, I mean,
this is, I think what could be
litigated if they make a finding
and their substantial evidence
in the record that 12, and 3
were um, you know, there's lots
of evidence in the record for
it.
Then how is the utility gonna
say no, resubmit it. They're
gonna have to say, oh well, we,
we don't think 2 is met.
So, so you can resubmit it. And
then my, my, but my bigger
question is how are they going
to do the consumer protection
aspect of what they're doing in
terms of protecting future
ratepayers or, you know, just
protecting ratepayers at all,
um.
Like I said, that I agonized. I
finally voted for the ET but I
agonized because I didn't like.
Taking away power from the PRC,
a constitutionally created.
An entity that has this
that should have this discretion
and that, I mean, I, I think if
it said me, I'd be fine.
Because that then then it's
saying they they may do this if
this is here, but if they have
some other consumer protection
idea, some other rape payer
ideas then.
Then, then we're gonna send it
back or whatever.
You know, like she's still
there.
Mm
As determined by the commission,
so G is important.
But, but how is the commission?
Going to reconcile that and how
is a court going to reconcile
that? Well,
The court might say, and I don't
want to prejudge what courts
would do, but
The commission might say, well,
hey, you didn't really didn't
have discretion because the
legislature told you, you must
approve it if these things were
met.
If they do something like send
it back because of rapier or
consumer protection concerns.
With this, with this language.
Like I said, if you've got me,
I'm good, but this she bothers
me.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator Ste
Lopez, I, I see what you're
saying, um.
My
My problem with that would be
if.
We were to replace the hall with
the mane, we would be
essentially directing, giving
the PRC.
The ability to expand the
requirements of whatever they
need to see in the plan to
approve the plan to whatever
they want to see in it.
The maid, they could sell May
means they could.
If they wanted to, but if they
don't want to, they don't have
to. And so the, the shell in
this particular instance states
that if the PRC is reasonably
satisfied that all of these
requirements within the plan are
met, which take into account um
maximum benefits and
minimization of costs, um,
allowing the utility to achieve
energy energization energization
time periods, uh, it's recently
expected to allow electric
public.
futility, uh, to recover cost,
um, uh.
All of these requirements would
not be, uh, they would be.
They would be requirements. They
would just be suggestions.
So how would we how what
direction would we be giving the
PRC if we were to
Allow them the ability to opt
out, even if the requirements as
laid out in statute were not
met.
Because they have
Because I believe they have the
discretion.
To consider
Uh, the impact on ratepayers and
what this does is it limits that
discretion. I'll move on.
Um, if, you know, if you don't
want to entertain that, I'll
move on. And then I didn't
understand page 3, which again
reminds me of the ETA. It took
me forever to understand that I,
I, on page 3 on line 11, number
3.
Could you
Could you say this in a way that
I can understand it. I, I, I
just
In that new residents
distributed generation paid I
don't know. I, what is this
trying to say, Madam Chair.
Yeah
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator.
So this
This section here relates to say
the situation where
Uh, customer connects, wants to
connect their rooftop solar, um,
and the way the system works
today is if you're connection
results in, say, the transformer
upgrade, you are solely
responsible for it, and the
customers who came before you
and the customers who came after
you that all benefit.
They don't pay anything, so the
What this section does is create
a essentially a flat fee that
would average out that cost for
people who are interconnecting
their solar, so not one unlucky
person is hit by the massive
bill that instead every customer
who wants to put solar and
interconnect pays a very small
fee.
To cover that cost. So the cost
isn't borne by one person, and
the cost isn't then passed on to
non-solar customers. That seems
like a great idea.
I didn't understand that from
this.
Um, I just, it, it helped to
free the cause of
interconnecting new distributed.
If you could, I mean, this is, I
know this is far, I guess.
shouldn't uh
Yeah.
Um
Uh, I
I would really appreciate if
these bills were written in a
way that we could understand
cause it sounds to me what
you're saying is this fee is
gonna to defray the costs of,
well, exactly what you said, of
people who are other people who
are going to benefit and other
people.
Who
Before or after the, the
transformer is connected.
And this is to eliminate wide
variation in those costs.
That is a really good idea, but
honestly I didn't understand
that from this.
Um, and I, you know what, now
your bill has gone too far. If
this is the first committee I
would ask for you to amend it so
that's the problem with these
bills. I, I, it's just a pet
peeve. I think people should
understand. um, so with that,
I'll just um
Yeah, I'll just go on, I'll just
leave it at that. Those are my
major concerns. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you. Um, the next
person is Senator Cervantes.
Oh dear
So this I think you're the last
person to wrap up any questions
or comments. Thank you, Madam
Chair. So this does have uh
remind me a lot of the energy
transition Act way back in the
day and it took us 2 or 3 years
to get there, um.
And, and so I have a number of
questions.
I think we just got this
amendment in our books. Am I
right? I just want to make sure
I'm tracking all of this
correctly. So we have the, this
for the center or
representative, so you have
House Bill 13, and then we have
the
energy environment, natural
resources Committee amendments.
Are these the only amendments to
the bill then?
And a trick question, Madam
Chair, uh, Senator Cervantes, so
there were supposed, there were
amendments adopted in house
energy and natural resources,
there were additional amendments
that were adopted in House
Judiciary, but were not read out
correctly and that is.
That led us to the bill that we
are considering today that we
attempted to amend that that
amendment failed. So,
I suppose I would say there's
just one set of amendment.
There's one amendment on the
bill. Yeah. So, so while there
may have been proposed
amendments in the judiciary, the
judiciary thought they had voted
on, it didn't get reported out
correctly, so I guess.
Accurately, accurately without
those amendments, would you
agree?
Um, Madam, uh, Senator, I, I.
I don't want to agree because
we, we visited with legislative
council services, um, uh, quite
a bit to try and figure out a
way to rectify this error. The
error was not, you know, it's
not anything that the sponsors
of this bill, including myself,
did wrong. It was simply an
error in procedure, um, the
amendments were duly considered
and, and discussed in judiciary,
they were adopted through the
proper process and judiciary.
they just simply were not read
out correctly because the
committee report did not include
them. So, um, I, I, I don't, I,
I'm madam chair, Senator Ste I
can't quite agree with you that
that's where, in fact, we are
with the bill. That's, I think,
Madam Chair Senator Santo where
we find ourselves where I find
myself with the bell. But um, I
mean, I think we're just, we're,
we're gonna agree to disagree on
whether or not the process taken
was correct.
well and Madam Church, I'm not
trying to find fault with
anybody or place blame with
anybody, and it's not where the
process was right. I just
wondering what the bill is and
right now I, I can't really
understand what we're even
looking at as a bill.
Other than what I believe we
have, which is the bill and the
only amendment that I have in
front of me.
So you may be telling me there's
other things that you think as
the sponsor are in the bill, but
But I can rely upon so I having
difficulty knowing.
What we've been having in front
of us and, and I know you take
your job very seriously as an
attorney. We're lawmaking,
right? And so, um, making laws,
I take very seriously and and so
I
I don't know even what the bill
is and we can't even agree what
the bill is at this point in
time. It's, it's challenging,
but I'll, I'll try and, and give
you some specific questions
about things that have in the
building gets part of why.
Um, so if I look at the
amendment that I have.
We look at paragraph 3 of this
amendment.
says on page 6, the strike lines
50 through 19.
And if I go to the bill, age 6
lines 15 through 19. That's the
definition of beneficial
electrification.
So you're striking the
definition of beneficial
electrification of the bill.
And isn't that the whole point
of the bill in the whole bill
about beneficial
electrification? No, Madam
Chair, Senator.
Beneficial electrification is
part of the bill, but it's part
of section I think it'd be
section 3.
So that definition was
Incorrectly placed in section 1
of the bill. So you'll know.
beneficial electrification is
still in the bill. It's just
only in one place.
And Madam Chair, Senator
Cervantes, to add further
complication to the bill, the
sections were rearranged at one
point in time.
So, um,
That could also explain.
00 that's go. Let's go, let's go
make something in the kitchen.
You and I should get back to
doing something constructive.
Yeah, I just, it's really hard
for me to, to, I mean, you're
telling me now there's something
else that that I don't.
Either
I'll just, I'll just give you
some general thoughts and
We'll see where it takes us,
man. I know we're trying to get.
Get down to the floor.
Um
again, Representative.
Laws lawmaking. I know sometimes
there's a little bit of, of
Disparagement of lawyers, this
session may have heard some of
that in your chamber. I'm
getting plenty of it on my side,
but, but, um, without going back
to that, I just, I, I do think
cause this doesn't go to
judiciary, that's important we
look at some of the language,
but if you just give me an
example on page 2.
Um
On lines really I'm just kind of
starting around 678 through 11.
We're, we're
Reason we shall, so, and I'm
really shocked today. I've got
to be honest with you, I'm
really shocked that there's no
electric utilities here.
just
Amazed that they could be asleep
on this bill.
It's, it strikes me because
that's exactly what they are.
I'll just give you the more,
more, um.
obvious examples that to start
with before we start getting
into the language of the bill,
but I think one of my colleagues
across the way said this, if you
look at section 3, is it section
3. Where's the, where's the
Ma, I'm sure, I'm sorry to
interrupt, but um it's just come
to my attention that there were
actually utilities waiting to
testify in favor of the bill
they were online and they for
whatever reason, we're not.
Um,
I have to tell you at the time
that we asked,
Our Zoom operators did not
identify them.
So if they had been identified,
they could have spoken, but they
were not identified as
abilities.
So they might have missed the
mark by a minute or two.
Yeah,
Madam, that's why I said I think
they're asleep at the switch
candidly, because if you look at
this, let me just give you an
example, the more.
Egregious thing. I'm a electric
utility lawyer. I'm gonna look
at page 6 and says this is new
language.
That's an electric utilities
contract for construction for
new construction.
Required to meet the provisions
of this law and have to comply,
as was pointed out earlier, with
minimum wage and fringe
benefits.
To be determined by the director
of labor relations division of
the Workforce Solutions and
pursuant to the public works
Minimum Wage Act.
And then it goes on to say, uh,
beyond that is a public utility,
electric utility, any contractor
subcontractors shall follow the
provisions of New Mexico Public
Works minimum Wage Act, many
rules adopted by that act. Now,
you made, you made a
Nice argument that well these
companies will always pay better
than New Mexico wages and
benefits as we specify in the
law and so didn't affect them.
But that law that this would
subject them to public works
minimum wage Act is not just
about wages and benefits. It has
a lot of provisions including
enforcement mechs.
So for example, they failed to
pay a wage on a timely basis
and, and that why it says you
have to make payroll at least
once a week, and so you have to
pay once a week and this would
say that the contractors have to
do that.
And then it goes on to say that
if you don't do that or you
don't pay that, you're uh liable
for up to treble damages at $100
a day per employee.
Now
Um, you may tell me that every
utility is gonna do that anyway,
but I doubt it. I really
seriously doubt that any uh El
Paso Electric Company or P&M is
gonna say, yeah, we want to be
subjected to New Mexico's public
works minimum wage Acts and, and
the Department of Labor
Workforce Solutions, whatever we
call it, uh, in all of their
rules and regulations. But
that's what this bill would do.
That's what I'm telling you, I'm
the CEO of I'm general counselor
at the P&M or El Paso Electric.
I'm gonna say.
This, this would be a disaster
for us because all new
construction.
To meet the requirements as well
would have to meet all of that
prevailing wage law.
And
Man, I gotta tell you, if
If I was a lawyer and I missed
that.
Uh, I think the utility would be
of great concern. And here's
why, here this is why it really
matters a lot to particularly
their Hamlin and I.
We represent probably the most
economically booming part of the
state right now, Santa Teresa.
And, and I gotta tell you, the
Texas side is exploding.
Uh, with economic development.
Housing billions of dollars of
infrastructure, highways, we
can't get to El Paso. There's so
many bridges, it's just
exploding down there on the
Texas side.
On your side, yeah, we're happy
when we get a nice announcement
every now and then of some
industry coming, it pales in
comparison and when you talk to
the developers and the business
people and I, I
Socialize with a lot of those
folks, my partner's in El Paso.
The reality is El Paso Electric
can offer a much better rate on
the tax side.
Then on the side.
Because of these types of
requirements in New Mexican law
and so the businesses stay on
the Texas side because the rate
of house electric charges in
Texas is not the rate they
charge in New Mexico.
And, and that quite simply is
why the business next time you
all drive, I hope you do fly
over El Paso, drive in El Paso.
Massive economic activity and
then it just stops at the state
line, just stops there, and
we're always puzzled why is
that? And this is one of the big
reasons and, and in our
district, Senator Hamlin and I,
we represent Santa Trasa our,
our Senate district's kind of
the line kind of rest between
the middle of Sanne Tracy so
arts in hers, parts in mine, but
um we're trying to get a lot of
stuff going out there and
electricity is a huge part of
that, huge, huge part of the
condition, so I, I'm just
focusing on this one aspect of
the bill to say, I, I really
think the utilities are.
asleep.
At at this building, you, you
can tell me that or not and that
we had 60 people on the bill.
This, this bill strikes me as
one of those bills where you,
you can tell you have 60 people
working on it cause I'm smiling
at Sauri because she's here. We
did the ETA together and in the
end, 2 or 3 of us had to get
together and rewrite it because
when you have too many cooks in
the kitchen to go back to your
experience, you end up with,
with mash. So I'll just give you
examples. I was back on page 2.
Uh, the utility shall your bill
shall do this, shall conduct
sufficient advanced planning.
I don't know what, I don't know
what would be sufficient. I
would be advanced planning, but
they have to do that
sufficiently.
Uh, to deal with low capacity
and pre-order transformers and
other needed equipment, so they
have to they have to order all
that so that customers can be
energized and interconnected
without substantial delay. I
have no idea what substantial
delay means, right? And you and
I are never gonna be able to
define what that is, but the law
says that you got to do this
stuff, you got to conduct
whatever advanced planning is,
we'll know what that is.
And they have to order, they
have to pre-order.
Transformers and other needed
equipment. I don't know what
other needed equipment would be
to comply, and they shall do
these things.
Um, and they shall do so that
the customers are energized
without substantial delay. You
and I will never know what that
means.
Um, it goes on in that next
paragraph says, they shall
upgrade their electric utilities
distribution system as needed. I
don't know what that means.
Uh, who's gonna decide what, uh,
distribution is updated as
needed.
And any time to allow for
achievement of various things
including local air quality, um,
including ve emission standards.
Uh, and then it, it goes, let me
just ask you a question here.
I'll get to one here in a
second. Page says the commission
shall finalize a rule.
It establishes a staggered
filing schedule.
Uh, a staggered filing schedule
for what exactly?
Um
Madam Chair, Senator Sante is a
staggered finally scheduled for
the just the uh distribution
system plans.
And, and what does the staggered
filing schedule then for them.
So, um, I'm
I'll begin and then I'll go to
Mr. Kenny who was um a direct
part of those conversations, but
the staggered, uh, the staggered
approach was to allow each
specific utility, the
flexibility they needed to um
include the information being
required because the different
utilities have different
timelines for when they need to
file these reports.
Yeah. Um
Senator, so if you
Go on to the next sentence. It
gives.
time brackets for when those
first plans would be filed.
Essentially wanted to give
discretion to the commission
about the order in which they
received them to not overload
them all at once with.
redistribution system plans, but
to spread them out in a way that
they've felt was appropriate.
Yeah, and, and if you'll allow
me, whenever, whenever we pass a
law that gives people
flexibility and doesn't really
specify what they have to do and
when they have to do it, then I
generally characterize it as a
memorial because it's it's what
we'd like you to do, but if you
don't say you must do this by
this date, time, you're hoping
and crossing your fingers, but
you're not really man.
Um, and, and, and I'm still not
sure what a staggered filing
system.
Because it says the commission
shall finalize a rule that
establishes a staggered filing
schedule.
I guess it says determined by
the commission, so we'll leave
that to them to.
later.
The um the plan requirements are
on page 3. It says there should
be a detailed mapping.
Of distribution hosting
capacity. I looked for what is
distribution hosting capacity
because they're required to have
detailed mapping. I don't know
what detailed enough would be.
But then it has to be a detailed
mapping of distribute
distribution hosting capacity. I
couldn't find a, a definition of
distribution hosting capacity.
Wouldn't we need to know what
that is if we're requiring them
to put that in the plan.
Um, Madam Chair and Senator
Cervantes, a lot of these terms
are lifted directly from the
public utilities Act, or they're
just standard terminology that
um are
That's used and required
throughout public utilities
lot's rather esoteric practice,
as I'm sure you can imagine, um,
and so it's, you know, either of
these definitions are lifted
from the Public Utilities Act or
their definitions that are
utilized daily with the public
regulation commission and the
plans that these utilities are
required to submit anyway, so I
mean we can argue all day long
that I'm sure Senator Deontes,
you know, what the definition
definition of and is.
But I mean, we, there we have
to, there are certain things
that are just reasonably
understood, especially in this
area of the law, um, and again,
you know, Madam Chair, senator,
it's, it's, it's
slightly frustrating to be, you
know, strike the balance and
that we can't tell the PRC what
to do, but then we're being
chastised for not telling the
PRC what to do. So I, I mean,
it's just, it's a very hard
balance to strike.
And I appreciate that and I, and
I'm not a utility lawyer, so
I'll, I'll take your uh
representation that that that
that uh host distribute
distribution hosting capacities
to find someplace in them.
Actually, um, Madam Chair,
Senator Cervantes, it is on.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, so you
go to page 8. This is
Of the original bill.
Page 8 line 2.
That is the definition of
hosting capacity that which, but
my question was different, what
is distribution posting?
It's same, same thing, OK, all
right. And again, I, I accept
and I appreciate there is a
definition.
Where, where you get challenges
then we're required to have a
mapping of that, but it goes,
then it says you got to do that
with appropriate safeguards. So
who's gonna decide what are the
appropriate.
Uh, Madam chairs at Senator
Spante's, that would be the PRC.
Yeah, and
And that's the question I guess
is I, I, what I'm gonna get to
representative, this is a
lawyer's field day and so for
everybody who's worried about
this one way or the other, um.
I wish I was younger and had
lots of associates and wanted to
start a new law firm.
But yeah, it's a real litigate
with that appropriate
safeguards.
He goes on to say you gotta have
appropriate safeguards for
confidentiality and says and
critical infrastructure.
We we're not, you and I are not
going to agree on what is
critical infrastructure and
nobody will, the lawyers and the
PRC I guess will decide what
that means, right, because
you're not gonna tell me there's
such a thing as a definition of
critical infrastructure.
Yes, is that right,
Senator, I, I certainly hope
not.
Yeah
And then I, I won't, I'm sure I
won't go through the whole bill
this way, but I think there's
some more examples that are
important. So, um, the plan has
to have proposed reasonable
average.
Um, and maximum target
energization time periods.
I don't know what would be
reasonable.
Um, but that'll depend on who
wants to litigate that issue,
and it goes on to say that these
may vary depending on the nature
of the work required and
recognize factors beyond.
The energy utilities control, so
we do all that to be determined
later, another time, but this
will depend on whatever factors
that are the utility says these
are beyond our control, then
that gets them out.
Um
And um
Then you've got a, you've got a,
a new section on 3. This is all
new language here on line 1 says
there should be a proposed
interconnection fee. This is
some, somewhat troubling for me
for residential customers
because it says there shall be a
proposed.
Interconnection fee.
Maybe that's what
the Nazi was talking about
earlier, I guess with some of
these fees, but it says that
there should be a new uh
for residential that customers
shall pay to protect the
customers from incurring
unreasonable cost.
Um
That result from the timing of
the customer's interconnection
requests. I have no idea what
that, that would be. So you're,
you're gonna
You know, allow an
interconnection fee for the
utility on new residential
customers.
to protect customers, I don't
know which customers that
customer or all the customers,
Madam Chair, Senator Santo, this
is the exact issue that we just
went through with Senator Sidia
Lopez. OK, well, she was doing
the Mai show sort of too, but
it's still again a troubling
thing. I don't know, I, you
know, if I'm being redundant, I,
I'll, I'll try to move on, but,
again, I think that this is the
concern that I've got here too,
which is that I, I don't
understand, maybe you can just
answer my question. Uh, we're
gonna allow for this speed to
protect the customers.
Which uh which customers, all
customers of the utility or?
That right?
Madam Chair, Senators.
that section there is is added
to protect existing ratepayers
from
costs that would otherwise
Um
incurred when a gradients to be
upgraded during an
interconnection, so I'm adding
solar to my rooftop and I'm the
one person who happens to
trigger the Transformer upgrade,
I'm here today with potentially
thousands of dollars to do that.
Uh, and that might just stop the
project.
But if every solar customer who
came before me or after me paid
nothing towards that, that's not
very fair. They all benefited.
So what this fee does is every
solar customer who's
interconnecting will pay a small
fee.
To spread that cost.
Um, as opposed to one person
getting stuck with the entire
thing.
Proposed interconnection fee
that you
Residential distributed customer
pays.
That the customers. So when you
answer my question is, when you
say to protect the bus, you're
trying to protect all the other
customers of the utility.
And then we want to protect the
moment of reading on from there.
We want to protect those
customers from incurring
unreasonable costs.
Yeah, so, um, so I, I think that
I, I appreciate what you're
telling me you're trying to do
here, but you're saying that you
want to protect.
Entire customer base from
incurring and then I'm just
reading here from incurring
unreasonable cause. So I, we're
gonna litigate what is an
unreasonable cost because that's
gonna determine what the fee is
gonna be right they charge each
new customer, so gonna charge
each new customer a fee to
prevent all the other customers
from incurring unreasonable
costs and we'll have to litigate
that.
Because I don't know what an
unreasonable cost is gonna be.
And to to fray the cause, so.
I'm
And
I don't think we're gonna try
and fix this today, but I'm sure
it doesn't sound like.
Fix it.
And, and I won't
Trust me, I won't continue to do
this with the whole bill, but
again, I just, I think uh
I think we should be taking our
job very seriously, and I think
you all do. I think everybody
does. I'm not suggesting we
don't do it otherwise, but I,
one of the things I do about
taking this job seriously for me
is when we make laws as
lawmakers.
Try really hard not to make laws
that are just gonna lead to
litigation disputes and.
So forth and
Smiling over your shoulder at
the I see, I mean they.
As in court every time I see you
over, I don't know how many, how
how I keep their cases straight.
You got too many cases and I'm
not putting anybody down. I just
I as a practicer, I, every time
I see.
Something going on, there's a
new lawsuit over.
Ambiguities that we create.
Here's the legislators and, and
I think that's something we
should try to avoid.
The, um, on page 5, just
questions to this is the
commission may require an
electric utility.
To take remedial actions
necessary to achieve er
energization time periods.
Is this, is this not already the
case, as the commission might
already require utilities to
take remedial actions.
Or, or are we giving the PRC
new, new authority.
Madam Chair, Senator, uh, me to
the specific section.
23.
This, this is, I think so
relating to the plan.
Right
Energization plan.
Um, and I'm distribution plan I
guess yeah, so, so part of the
plan is requiring the utilities
create energization timelines,
guaranteeing essentially how
long it will take for a customer
to connect.
Um, the commission can direct
remedial actions to the utility
to, if they're not meeting those
timelines, you know, they'll
have recommendations on how they
could.
So directing those utilities to
pursue those recommendations.
Again, that's why I'm suggesting
I can't understand the
utilities.
And, and if we're, we're being
told that they were gonna they
were gonna try and appear on
this and
may have been supportive and I.
And I understand how you need
electric utility would want.
Enact a law that says
The the commission will will
direct them to take remedial
action.
To achieve energization time.
Pretty, pretty
It would seem pretty onerous to
me, so.
If I can just turn to move ahead
quickly to pages 89.
really to probably page.
11, I think, I think section 2
just seems to be definition. I'm
saying that's right, so.
I don't know the definitions
matter so much as their
application. So if I
If I look at section 3.
This is kind of this kind of
puzzling, really puzzling to me
because it says the commission
shall direct the utilities once
again the absolute utilities
here today anyway to file
beneficial electrification plans
that support voluntary customer
adopt
adoption of measures for
beneficial electrification.
So
I'm already kind of puzzled
there, the pub, the utilities
have to file a plan that
supports, I don't know what it
would mean.
support, but it would support
voluntary.
customer adoption, beneficial
electrification. How do, how do
we do that? How do we, how do
we um have the PRC.
Require a beneficial plan that
supports voluntary customer
adoption.
By the by the electric utilities
told me to just understand what
do you, what do you envision?
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Cervantes, so, uh, the utility
would submit a plan that
includes um, let's say
utilization of rebates, um, or
incentives or stacking of
incentives for certain customers
to change over, um, to more
efficient appliances or use um
more efficient technologies, and
so if that is included in the
plan, then the PRC can help.
Better track.
How the utilities are achieving
beneficial electrification and
the reduction of those carbon
emission goals to meet the goals
that again already codified in
law. So this is just a way for
us to um track and keep the
utilities accountable for what
they are already supposed and
supposed to be an assumed to be
doing.
And it's voluntary because um
you can't force
Customers to adopt technologies
that they don't want to, um, but
at the same time, you have to
give the utilities have to be
capable of evolving and maintain
flexibility to um meet goals as
set by the PRC and if you make
the deal sweet enough, Madam
chair, uh, Senator Cervantes,
you would assume that there
would be more people voluntarily
willing to to.
take the deal.
Well, and, and of course,
I, I recognize that, of course,
but, but again, when you're
saying, we're saying shall, so
the commission shall do
something and they shall make
the utilities file a plan that
supports voluntary customer
adaptation.
I don't have any idea of how we
could ever know what that you
ever enforced that.
In
Utility has to follow a plan
that supports voluntary
customer.
picture of
Nice new electric appliances, I
guess, right? He's, here's our,
we're encouraging you
voluntarily to do this.
It just, it's, it's not gonna be
a something that it's gonna be
able to be again I get back to,
I really want to make laws that,
that tell people to do
something.
I, I, I get it and Madam Chair
and Senator Sante is, um, and
there are, we do reference back
to standards, um, like.
Like the energy transition Act
and the US Climate Accords and
the um the global cost of carbon
emissions cause there, there is
a way to come to um compute
those costs, and that is one
mechanism that would create data
for the PRC to um compare these
beneficial uh energization plans
too.
So the social cost of carbon is
a real thing and it can be
calculated.
Yeah, and I know this tries to
do that.
We in the bill too, but I'm
still stuck on this notion that
when we, when we tell utility,
you know, you shall come up with
a plan that tells your customers
to how to voluntarily give up
their
Non-electric
Whatever energy
Us and get that and coming back
to it but it matters a lot part
of the state that I represent
because a lot of folks there do
use propane, do use um gas
suppliances for heating. I, I
do, um.
Comparing Stones earlier today,
so, yeah.
I'm not gonna get into the weeds
on that one. Senator, were they
gas stoves?
I'm not gonna answer that.
I've got different stoves in
different places, so, uh, but,
um.
Yeah
Man, I get the point here. I
mean, I'm not gonna, we're
already at 2:30, almost, um, you
know, happy to roll the bill.
I've, I've, we need to it. We're
almost at the end, um, and I
have one speaker after Senator
Cervantes and I think we're
going to a motion.
Uh, I want to apologize because
the two people online, one was
utility. It was Mike D'Antonio
from Excel, but the other person
was Bridget Dixon from here in
Santa Fe.
So you had one utility online.
support. I wanted to apologize
for that and I'll assume that
that was right. Yeah I was gonna
say supportive and that's good.
I'm still wondering where's BNM
and where's El Paso Electric?
This would seem to be a very
onerous burden.
Um
The, that page 11, I'm still
that same section on line 18
says the commission shall shall
consider and whenever we say uh
that you need to maximize
greenhouse gas emission
reductions.
Uh, and if, if you look at line
17, they need to do that they're
gonna have to by 2000132 that
you need to maximize greenhouse
emissions.
Again, I don't know what
maximize.
Litigates out just while
maintaining fair and reasonable
rates.
That means we'll litigate what
that means. We have to maintain
fair and reasonable rates.
And then it goes on and says and
show and shall establish a
system of reliability to get
that.
Goes on to say the commission
shall consider certain things
and here, here's, I'm just
curious about this where this
comes in. The commission shall
consider the customer base
within each of public utility
that may adopt heat pump.
When determining reasonable
targets.
And will litigate what is
determining reasonable targets,
but why is this language in here
that that we're gonna
The Commission shall consider.
The customer base, just explain
for me what this they're gonna
consider the customer base
within the utility that may
adopt heat pumps.
Madam Chair, Senator, so that
comes down to if we're setting
targets for each utility
individually, you have to also
consider what's the proportion
of residential versus commercial
or large commercial.
In each utility territory. So if
you're
Set a target, you know, for P&M
it's not appropriate to set that
same target for El Paso
Electric. They're very different
utility service territories. In
this context, what is the heat
pump?
Uh, heat pump is a
And technology that acts as the
same as a furnace in a heat, uh,
an air conditioner, so does
both.
It's a heating, a heating unit
for residential application, uh,
residential and commercial. OK.
So the commission shall consider
the customer base.
That may adopt like, I guess
what I'm getting is why, why be
so specific? Why are we saying
heat pumps are the thing we want
to know about for the customer
base of El Paso Electric.
We want to know what customers
could convert to adopting heat
pumps.
As opposed to
Any number of other technologies
that might be.
reach your goal here of greater
electrification.
Why, why not put
ro s and
All the other gas appliances in
here and.
I'm trying to figure out why the
heat pump signal.
Um
you hit a home. Why is that?
Yeah
New Hampshire Senator, when we
think about
Beneficial electrification.
We're looking predominantly like
switching heating fuels, so
heating your water, heating your
home or business. So that's why
he pump is kind of the
Preferred metric, it's
And
To efficient electric appliance
that you would ideally switch to
if you were, if you're going to
make a beneficial
electrification jump.
For heating home heating a home
or heating your water.
So you
You're right, you could insert
stove, but it, that's not
necessarily.
Ideal or the goal here.
Yeah, it just, it, it as again,
as we're making statutes for
All time
It did seem strange that again
we're being that specific,
right, that we want to know
what, what your customer base
can do in converting to heat
pumps
as opposed to any other seems
overly specific.
Um
So one thing that I think is
important in this section.
I'm not gonna keep
I promise, but, but, but I think
what's important here is we, we
have this debate at some length.
earlier this session and I think
it was Senate Bill 4 the issue
was.
Horizons somebody help me out.
Clean, clean horizons, right,
and the goal here was to how we
were gonna set these targets for
emissions.
Greenhouse gasses and so forth.
And this kind of does the same
thing. I know that Bills.
problem
those I voted against it, but uh
it's, I think it's been
strangled
It's like
has been for a very long time,
but
When you, when you read this
section of the bill, we're
talking about the commission
establishing schedules for
electrification targets.
And then it says target shall be
consistent with any greenhouse
gas emissions adopted by the
state by rule or law.
Uh
The concern I have here, kind of
getting back to the ETA issue is
back again as we're saying that
uh by rules, some agency can
establish with these greenhouse
gas emissions I be and then that
will in turn determine
beneficial electrification
targets.
So my concern is that we're in
running what we've been
unwilling to do here in this
session, we should say these are
the greenhouse gas emissions.
We're gonna, we're gonna limit
those, that, that's what that
Senate bill for that is. Here's
the target. Here's the date.
Here's the amount of reduction.
And here we're saying that the
electrification targets.
And be adopted by rule,
rulemaking process of the state,
or at least the, the emission
reductions can be adopted and
then the beneficial
electrification targets shall be
consistent with that. So, so.
Representative, do you agree
that what we're doing here is
we're kind of delegated to the
rulemaking process, but those,
those the greenhouse gas
emissions can be and in turn of
how there to be met by
electrification.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator
Cervantes, uh, I think that um
it's an issue.
That lends itself to
oversimplification, um, so we
have to be very careful and
that, um, you know,
I think that you and I may have
slightly different philosophies
in terms of Chevron deference,
which doesn't exist anymore and
not who do we want making these
decisions, right? Do we want, do
we want experts who are, uh, you
know, lifetime bureaucrats who
have been working in these
issues and are very familiar
with these goals and very
familiar in what needs to happen
in order to achieve a specific
result or do we as a legislative
body want to mandate these goals
just based upon our personal
experience or the advice of.
experts sitting next to us and,
and we have to strike a very,
um, we have to thread a very
thin needle. And so like I said
before, um, Madam Chair,
Senator, Senator Cervantes,
it's, it's not that we're like
plucking these standards out of
thin air. There are, there is
language in here that gives us
guidance. There is language in
here that tells us what carbon
emissions goals are because
we've we've either established
them through state law or
they've been established through
other means like the US climate
accords or otherwise. And so all
this would do
is using the data standards
which are referenced, again,
there is a social cost of
carbon. Um, we would then enable
the PRC to adopt in rule what
those
what those acceptable standards
would be, because I certainly
cannot sit here, Madam Chair and
Senator Santes myself and tell
you with any degree of
certainty, what a good standard
would be. Again, I'm an airplane
lawyer. I don't, I mean, we're,
we're a voluntary legislature
and so I do not feel like I'm
the best person to be making
these halls, Madam Chair and
Senatorontes, and I feel like
again, we have to thread the
needle and giving the PRC the
ability and the discretion they
need to make.
Those calls and promulgate
through role what those calls
would look like, but we need to
give them enough to direction to
tell them what it is that we're
trying to ask them to do and so
that was exactly what we were
trying to do, Madam chair,
Senator Svante through this
incredibly esoteric piece of
legislation that I, uh, that I
understand, um, is hard to read
and hard to understand and
again, I've learned more about
public utility law than I'd ever
cared to in the last 10 months,
but again, Madam Chair, Senator
Cervantes, I mean.
I, I think that there is um
There is some art form towards
smithing here and uh you and I
may, I think, agree on.
To what degree that needs to
happen within statute, but I
think that we may disagree as to
um where it is appropriate and
where it is not appropriate and
um I
I hope that answers your
question. Well, I'm sure there's
a lot in there, but I agree with
a lot you said. I, I agree this
bill is esoteric. It is hard to
read and it's very hard to
understand and that's usually
something I resist.
I try, I try to pass laws that,
as I said, are gonna be read
differently and
And interpret it differently and
that'll that'll lead to
possible.
The money making for lawyers, my
friends over there, uh.
We'll give you a hard time about
that again. When lawyers make
money, but uh this is was, I'll
just for, for all of you on the
other side over there, I don't
practice utility law. I'm not
gonna make money on this, uh,
just so you all know, just not.
This is not my opportunity to.
So um
get into retirement, so, uh.
Madam Chair, again, I, I think
you all probably know where I'm
going.
There's so many ambiguities in
here.
It's, it's just replete.
With benefits, the lowest
reasonable cost while
maintaining fair and reasonable
rates again, all those things
have really no, no concrete
understanding.
have to provide effective
customer classes with the
opportunity to participate.
Go
What will be the opportunity to
participate and to benefit.
Compliment local county and
federal incentives.
For similar measures.
Go on and on, you probably know
where I'm going, representative
again, I, I appreciate what
you're trying to do. I supported
you asked earlier.
We, we want this house here in
Santa Fe and everything's
electric.
Everything's on solar. I love
it.
Except that my stove is not gas,
and I hate that, so, um.
So,
you know, I, I wish I could swap
it out, um.
But there's no gas.
We heat the house, I guess. I,
my, my personal circumstance is
really not the issue. The issue
really is I support what you're
trying to do. I think it is the
future where we're going, but I,
I don't think it's good when we
just create a situation that can
be easily enjoyed.
litigated for a very long period
of time because I think we, we
that unpredictability and that
uncertainty which is ultimately
counterproductive to what you
think.
years ago
Thank you.
Thank you. Uh, Senator Charlie,
and I think she's the last one,
and then we'll go to a motion.
Uh, Madam Chair.
A representative, thank you. I
was actually just gonna pick up
Cervantes left off on page 12 of
Save Us and um, no, go ahead.
No, I'd like for you to make
your comment, please. OK, well,
it's
12 specifically Section C,
considering the beneficial
electrification plan
applications for approval, the
commission shall, and then I go
down to line 24, um.
Evaluate whether the plan is
reasonably expected to achieve
the beneficial electrification
targets and protected greenhound
greenhouse gas emission
reduction.
It's what it's too much
ambiguity, and I think
deserves to not actually achieve
its purpose because what is
reasonably expected and, and
we're just, we're giving too
much space here to not actually
um achieve those targets that we
took so much time in the
previous, um,
Definition of the bill to
establish her.
Thank you.
Uh, we are now at the moment of
a vote or a motion.
Is there a motion on House Bill
13 as amended.
There is a tabling motion which
is non-debatable.
So I'm gonna ask the secretary
of the book.
no Cervantes, yes, Senator
Charlie.
That Charlie, no, San.
And Rosel, yes, Senator Hamlin,
yeah.
Sinner Pope
No.
Pope, no, Senator Scott.
It's got, yes, Senator Townsend.
and, yes, San Esa Lopez. Noted
table.
I still the snow San Stephonics,
I mean, excuse me, tell me
Hamlet.
So
