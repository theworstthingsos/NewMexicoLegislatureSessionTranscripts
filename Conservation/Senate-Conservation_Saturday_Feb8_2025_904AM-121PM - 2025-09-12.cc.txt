Are we ready?
Yeah, it's.
Good morning, Senator Stewart.
It's a pleasure to have you here
and I understand that you wanted
to present both bills together.
Yes, madam Chair, the one is
just a funding mechanism for the
main community benefit funds, so
I can talk about them both at
the same time if that's all
right with you, and then you can
take separate action.
OK, but you have a uh an
amendment. Uh yes, madam on the
1st or the on the on the 1st 1
on the community benefit fund
48.
OK, so let's.
Yes, Senator.
Yeah, these microphones don't
work that well, how much money
have we spent on these, it's
very irritating and aggravating,
sat better.
Don't think I have a small
voice, man.
You want me to use my teacher
voice, I can get really loud.
You want me that loud?
Um, it's coming across better,
OK.
So, uh,
Senator Stewart Madam prote, why
don't you start with Senate Bill
48 and the amendment, and then
we'll, uh, we're gonna roll this
into a package, uh, but we of
course will be voting
separately. We'll have plenty of
time for questions and um we'll
extend the uh
Time limit since we're doing two
bills at once for the pro
proponents and opponents.
So please go ahead.
Ah, thank you so much.
Madam Chair, partly I've got
this frog in my throat this
morning.
So Madam Chair, this is the 2nd
bill in a package of 3 bills,
actually 4 with 49, but that my
office has been working on for
an entire year.
Uh, this is 48 is the community
benefit fund.
It is designed to get money all
across the state in our
communities.
On projects that reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. Uh, we
have, we have identified over 1
billion in projects that people
have wanted to do communities
have wanted to do, um, and that
are not funded, um there is 340
million in the budget. Got to
work real hard to keep it there,
uh, for this community benefit
fund. I wanna walk through it
with you, and I want to point
out.
the hand out
Uh, on the back of this handout
has the chart already showing
the amount of funds that the
CUNY Benefit fund would direct.
To for this work for these
agencies.
So, uh, cynical 48, uh, as I
said, it's really designed to
get money to our communities. We
have plenty of cities and
counties and organizations and
folks that want to invest
directly in their local projects
creating jobs, supporting
families, strengthening our
communities most impacted by
climate change, rural.
towns recovering from wildfires
to cities, advancing clean
energy, every corner of New
Mexico will benefit from this
transition.
So the first section of Senate
Bill 48.
Outlines the projects to be
funded.
Uh, the first one is the
reduction of greenhouse gasses.
The second one is increasing
electric grid capacity.
A resilience or reliability
through grid modernization.
The 3rd 1 is increasing
electricity.
From renewable energy resources
and efficiency of electricity
from energy efficiency projects.
The 4th is transportation
projects.
Including electric vehicle
infrastructure, bicycle, and
pedestrian infrastructure.
Number 5
Closer, far away, speak loud,
speak soft, doesn't work anyway,
um.
Number 6 is electric vehicle
purchases.
Uh, number 7 is economic
development.
Opportunities and number 8 is
the workforce training expansion
and development in those areas
that I just mentioned.
The important thing about this
part of the bill is that uh
entities seeking grants.
Or providing opportunities must
reach out to our overburdened
communities, that's on page 3.
Um, either by holding meetings,
that's on page on line 17 or by
a community benefits agreement.
To this fund will rest in the
department of finance and
Administration.
We have designed this so these
funds can be used now
immediately by identifying both
in the next bill and this bill
where the money goes.
In addition, the Department of
Finance, uh, with a nerd, uh, is
required to develop or identify
a data tool that yous spatial
data sets to identify over burnt
communities. It's this part of
the bill, madam Chair, when I'm
done with it, that we have slide
them in too.
We're requiring the projects to
submit a report to our
appropriate interim legislative
committees with progress.
Uh, if
it
Is of the project or any other
information the committee
requires.
Uh, my chair, can I switch these
two, perhaps this one is better.
Madam chair, if I may suggest to
somebody who used to speak into
a microphone, I would.
When it down a little bit, is
what's happening is that just
the the pops of the peas are
what's making that happen.
So it might be an experiment.
Yeah, it might be, it might be
if, if, uh, the prote is willing
to be a little bit of an
experiment. It's just to point
it down a little bit.
How's this? You can never take
the radio out of a radio girl,
so my apologies. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Uh, at the last section has the
uh.
Definitions.
that we're talking about,
including climate change, energy
efficiency, greenhouse gas, red
modernization, renewable energy
resources.
Uh, so, Madam Chair, that is a
quick overview. Let me go over
again this chart for you.
So the fund.
Is directing $100 million to the
energy, minerals and natural
resources division for grid
modernization.
We have situations all over the
state where we can't do our
community solar, Madam Chair,
your bill, um, because we can't
tap into the utility grid, uh,
we are in need of microgrids and
electric site setups
infrastructure of that is the
purpose of that and it the bill
fills this out a little bit, um,
by requiring by looking at
resiliency or rely.
il ity in our grid
modernization.
Uh, 40 million to M nerd also
for energy efficiency and
renewable technology, we have a
really.
Great community energy efficient
development block grant that we
already passed that goes to
cities and counties for
infrastructure for our
affordable housing communities.
Uh, 50 million to the Department
of Transportation for electric
vehicle infrastructure, bicycle,
and pedestrian infrastructure.
Uh, 5 million for our state
supplemental land and water
fund, uh, we redid that bill 2
years ago to ensure that cities
and counties can use this
better, uh, we get about 3 or 4
million from the federal
government to match projects in
our local communities, it's
things like rodeo grounds,
paths, swimming pools, uh,
walking paths, outdoor
recreation.
Uh, 60 million to our public
schools facility authority for
uh getting the infrastructure
and the ability of school
districts to purchase electric
school buses. If you've ever
ridden on currently what we use
a diesel bus sits there idling
while it's waiting for students
to get on. It's a health hazard,
uh, you ride an electric bus and
you don't have any of those
fumes or vapors.
And you also don't have the
noise.
Economic development department
receives $40 million to
establish or expand economic
development needed to address
the economic implications of
climate change so that we can
have economic opportunities to
optimize resources to lower
consumption, promote reuse and
recycling of materials in a
sustainable manner, transition
away from our dependence on
fossil fuel industry as a
revenue resource.
We're moving away from that
dependence were not saying we're
not going to continue to use it
now
uh, and then finally, uh 25
million to workforce solutions
for establishing or expanding
worker trainer activities to
provide workers for industries
that assist in these objectives,
so mine reclamation renewable
energy, etc. so Madame Chair,
that is an overview of.
Senate Bill 48 I have with me,
um, Adrian Avila.
uh
I don't think he's gonna say
anything. I'm just introducing
her, go ahead, uh, he is works
for the Senate Majority Office
and uh helped craft the
appropriation bill, and he's
here for technical questions.
And he's not here in support or
against the bill, said that for
him.
Thank you. So, uh, Madam Proin,
will you please present the um
amendment. Yes.
Uh,
Madam Chair for discussion
purposes, could I have a motion
to um adopt the amendment for
discussion only, Madam Chair, I
move the amendment. Yes, madam
Chair, online on page 4.
Line 8.
We're deleting the words and
existing.
So that it would say develop or
identify a data tool.
On line 9 we're striking used by
the federal government.
And then on line 13, um, after
the period were inserting the
departments shall ensure that
data from tribal and indigenous
communities are included in the
data used by the data tool.
Thank you. Is there discussion
on the amendment, Senator Scott.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator, I'm
Unfamiliar with these data
tools, and it looks like we are.
Striking an existing, which
would mean.
Now that we are looking at
developing a new data tool.
Could you describe how that
process is gonna work?
Uh, Madam Chair, we're not, we
can certainly still use existing
tools. We're just not requiring
it, so there is a current.
Uh, tool used by the federal
government called um EJ
something after that I always
forget that second. Thank you.
So, and that is a tool that the
federal government uses for
identifying overburdened
communities we could use that or
we could develop our own. There
could be others, um, so we're
just giving us more flexibility,
uh, by taking out the
requirement that we use in
existing tool.
And Madam Chair and senator
Cajure expert.
Describe the operation of
That tool is a piece of.
Software, what are the inputs
and outputs that we would be
using to make.
Decisions
Uh, Madam chair the uh AT what's
the last word? screen screen,
gosh, why don't I can't remember
that. I think because secretary
called something different, so
it's currently operational, um,
and you can just go to their
website, it, it, uh, it's like a
website based data tool.
Do you have anything to add?
Um, Madam Chair, it works.
Uh, Madam Chair, um.
Senator Scott. Uh, so the data
tool operates very similarly to
a census data tool since it's
government run, you basically
type in the zip code and it'll
give you the data in relation to
that zip code. So since it's
focused on overburdened
communities, it'll tell you the
details of those communities and
it'll flag them.
And
Madam Chair and repeat your name
again for me please sir.
Adrian.
Adrian.
Is it Mr. Adrian or?
Is that Adrian Avila is the
chief of staff for Senator
Munoz.
Of, of, so I'm gonna.
I'm gonna continue this with
Madam Chair and Mr. Avila.
obviously
you've heard the term garbage in
garbage out.
With respect to these data sets,
what I'm trying to get to is how
This change
Might alter.
That uh that dynamic.
Who is going to monitor what's
going into that process.
And how are we going to evaluate
the validity of what's coming
out of Madam Chair, Senator
Scott, I think one of the main
reasons for having the
department obtain the
flexibility through this
amendment is to be able to
validate the tool.
Because the tool, for example,
right now, the, the tool that,
uh, the Madam Prote mentioned is
ran by the EPA if I'm not
mistaken, right?
Is run by the EPA.
And that tool ideally should be
updated frequently, however,
there's no guarantee that that's
the case. So that's why with the
departments being able to look
at existing data tools and be
able to um connect the data.
And potentially build their own.
You can then validate the
information and with the
inclusion of the last sentence,
ensuring tribal data that will
ensure that our tribal partners
are able to
further validate the tool.
Within their communities Madam
Chair,
Mr. Ovallark.
Obviously we know where the
tribal communities are, uh,
there were some other language
in here.
That was using these data sets
to identify.
Overburdened communities and
communitiesperiencing
disproportionate burdens with
respect to climate change, you
have, can you describe
geographically a couple of those
communities that have been
identified today.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
uh, I can't, so a few examples,
most of the state is actually
considered within an
overburdened community. And even
within more metro areas I think
Albuquerque, the South Valley is
considered an overburdened
community. If you look in
southern New Mexico, Demming is
considered an overburdened
community. um Northern Demming.
So it's very much different
pieces and it's broken down by
zip.
Hey
Madam Chair, uh, Mr. Ovallo,
that's very interesting answer
that the entire state.
was likely to be considered
overburdened. Thank you, sir,
for your answers and thank you,
Madam Chair. That's all. Thank
you. Now, committee members, we
are on the amendment only.
Is there anything else on the
amendment?
Charlie.
Thank you, Chair. Um, Senator.
I am curious why we didn't use.
Um, American Indian or tribe
nations in public. It's just the
the language, um.
In, in the
So American Indian is the legal
term, right, for a native
American.
So I think when we use a
different term.
Um, we're not following federal
Indian.
So that would just be maybe as
an amendment before.
Thank you, chair.
Thank you very much. Anything
else on the amendment?
Yes, Senator.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much.
uh
Um
Now it is OK.
Thank you for turning yourself.
Madam Cheer senator and Mr.
Avila on the amendment on where
where the whole sentence is
added.
On page 4, line 13.
But whenever you're talking
about.
Falling along the senators.
Very right over there.
Isn't each tribe different
though, as far as what you're
trying to get done here?
Um, Madam Chair, there's
differences, there's
similarities, we take that all
into consideration.
It would madam chair and
senator.
I guess my concern there is if
each tribe does have different.
thoughts on this. What would,
how are you going to resolve the
differences between each tribe
and
Uh, indigenous communities.
Madam Chair, Senator.
You know, we, we have very clear
guidelines on government to
government work that we do with
our uh our American Indian
communities.
Uh, we do that throughout
government, it's throughout our
statutes throughout our bills,
so you know the the federal.
HA screener.
Uh, takes this into account but
not as much as we want to do in
New Mexico.
So we will the department of
finance and Administration along
with energy, minerals and
natural resources department,
um, we'll be working on this
data tool and they will work
with our tribes.
An indigenous community madam
chair
and senator Stewart president
Stewart, um.
The whole
Amendment that you're using here
where you take out an existing
data tool you're taking out
existing data used by the
federal government, so you were
more or less giving the
authority to somebody else to
come up with this with this
innovative.
Language
Where all the tribes and
indigenous communities.
Will be treated the same.
Uh, my chair, there will be part
of the data tool.
It just brings some.
Questions to my mind.
Thank you for your response.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you.
Anyone else on the amendment.
Is there a motion to accept the
I moved to accept the amendment.
Nice.
OK, could the secretary please
call the roll on the amendment
on the amendment to Senate Bill
48.
Excuse
Senator Charlie.
Yes, Santa Charlie, yes,
Senator, Senorel, no. Senator
Hamblin, Senator Hamblin, yes,
Senator Pope.
Yes. Senator Pope, yes, Senator
Scott.
No. Senator Scott? No. Senator
Townsend.
Townsend, no, Senator Di Lopez.
Yes, Senator Dia Lopez, yes,
Santoponics, yes. So Stephonics,
yes.
So on a vote of 5 to 3, the
Senate Bill 48 is amended. Now,
um, you wanted to go ahead and
present 49 and then we will go
to the full big.
Uh, thank you, madam chair, so
the Senate Bill 9 just puts.
Uh, every
49, sorry.
Just puts this chart.
What the money is and where it's
going and for what? So it's it
reiterates the community benefit
fund, but it's an appropriation
bill that will just remain uh in
finance if it goes out of here,
I believe, uh, whereas the other
one will, will go forward.
If it gets.
committees. So it's again it's
what I said it's 40 million to
the.
Uh
Economic Development department
for assisting and diversifying
and promoting the state's
economy, fostering economic
development opportunities, uh,
section 2 is the 20 million
going to the community, uh,
energy efficiency development
grant, the section 3 is the grid
modernization fund $100 million
to the great modernization grant
fund, Section 4 is 50 million
transferred to the community
benefit.
to the transportation project
fund for transportation related
projects, uh 5 is 5 million to
the state supplemental land and
water conservation Fund 6 is 40
million to the energy, minerals
and natural resources department
to provide com competitive
grants to entities to develop or
enhance energy efficiency
technology, renewable energy
technology, batteries.
and other systems capable of
retaining storing, and
delivering energy by chemical
thermal mechanical or other
means section 7 is the 25
million to the workforce
solutions department.
For providing individual
training in the non extractive
industries and training workers
that will enhance their skill
set to transition and section 8
is $60 million to the public
school facility authority or uh
26 to 28 we have two sections
that are over a two-year period,
uh, the other one. the first
one, economic development
department.
Uh,
for uh electric vehicle charging
infrastructure for school
districts and the difference in
cost between upgrading diesel
fuel to electric buses, so that
is it, just to repetition of the
funds in 48 directing uh the
money uh from the general fund
to the community benefit fund.
Thank you. Um, before we go to
discussion by the committee.
We will go to the proponents and
we are taking comments on both
bills at one time.
Uh, we will try to do it with 15
minutes if we need to go to 20,
we will since we're dealing with
two bills, but I have a list
here and then after the
proponents, we will go to the
opponents.
Now online, how many people are
here for to support.
of 10.
OK, there, there are 10 online
supporting how many online
opposing.
There are 4 online opposing.
So we will start in the
audience, first of all, how many
by a show of hands, how many are
supporting these bills. Please
raise your hand.
Thank you. Uh,
How many people are opposing
this bill.
OK, we have a couple of people
here opposing and Paula, there
was nobody else in the, in the
hallway.
OK.
So we will line up, please line
up, uh, these are the people
I've been given.
Uh, Travis Kellerman, Rebecca if
start lighting up, please.
Rebecca Roose, Sammy Cow, uh,
Loose small, Brighton Ludwig,
Maya Jeuram, then we will switch

And if there's time,
Maria Avalos.
Justin Garrot
And Mayani Bruin.
There's quite a few people who
want to speak, so let's see, and
will you set your timer, please?
Let's see how many we can get in
15 minutes. So please go ahead,
introduce yourself, any
organization and um be as brief
as possible. Thank you.
Thank you, members of the
committee. My name is Travis
Kellerman. I'm the senior
climate policy advisor for the
governor. I'm here to speak in
support of the community benefit
fund. I really want to focus on
the economic opportunity here.
This is not just about climate
action and climate change.
It's about creating jobs in the
state.
We know after 20 years of clean
energy projects, infrastructure
related to that, that this is a
profitable sector.
This has a list of smart, smart
and targeted funding for
projects in the exact sectors
and areas.
That the governor committed to
last year when she issued an
executive order that supported
building a climate-ready
workforce here in New Mexico.
As co-chair of the US Climate
Alliance. She affirmed that same
week that New Mexico was
committed to climate action and
also to the economic
opportunity.
Involved with
Performing that action.
Here in New Mexico, we are #2 in
job growth for energy
efficiency. That's one of the
areas affected by the community
benefit fund supported.
And we're also focused on
decarbonization and oil and gas,
which involves methane
mitigation.
Grid, stability and resilience.
And many other sectors directly
supported by the community
benefit fund.
So this is about supporting
apprenticeships, supporting
jobs.
And building a new economy in
the state.
I urge your support. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name's Rebecca Russ. I'm the
infrastructure advisor to the
governor, and I want to thank
the sponsor for bringing this
bill forward, and uh I'm here uh
in strong support of the
community Benefit fund. As the
infrastructure advisor, I am
faced with both the challenges
and opportunities around clean
energy infrastructure and our
grid and clean transportation
infrastructure on a daily basis,
as well as the workforce issues
that we
have to tackle in earnest in
order to move us forward. Uh,
the Community Benefit fund is
intentionally, as I understand
it, a spend fund. If we don't
spend money, we are not going to
get where we need to go, and
this bill, these, these two
bills acknowledge that. And uh
just briefly, I wanna
acknowledge that the um it's a
lot of money, and we, we
appreciate the uh sponsor for
her thoughtfulness and bringing
that forward and also really
I want to emphasize that given
the work of the legislature and
the governor the last few years,
as well as significant
investments and innovations at
the federal level.
The agencies that are mentioned
in these bills and the programs
and projects that are lifted up
in these bills, are ready to go,
and they're ready to grow, and
that's a key reason why uh this
bill is timely and in front of
you today. Thank you so much for
your time.
Morning chair,
Madam Madam Chair, members of
the committee. My name is Sammy
Co. I am the policy director
with the Energy, Minerals and
Natural Resources Department,
and we are also in very strong
support of SB 48 as one of the
not beneficiaries, but the
administrators of a lot of the
money in the community benefit
fund. We want to express our
sincerest gratitude to the
Protem and her team for this
last year leading extensive
community um engagement with
frontline communities,
environmental advocates, and
state agencies.
Alike to ensure that her
approach in this bill was
comprehensive to ensure that our
state agencies are fully funded
and ready to tackle the climate
crisis, um, and ensure that our
communities are looked after.
The efforts in this bill, such
as grid modernization, energy
efficiency, and renewable energy
technology and the seedlock
Grant Act are complex, um,
extensive and also very, very
necessary, especially with our
federal government fighting to
roll back some very important um
programs that our state relies
on, um, this funding now is more
important than ever.
And, um, particularly the EJ
screening tool that the Protem
mentioned in her amendment, Ener
is very ready and that tool is
optimized for our thank you
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Brian
Ludwig. I'm 17 year old, 17
years old, and um here with my
classmates from Albuquerque
Academy to speak in support of
SB 48. Um.
75 years ago, Aldo Leopold,
whose time in New Mexico
inspired his land ethic, wrote,
When we see land as a community
to which we belong, we may begin
to use it with love and respect.
As a young New Mexican, words
like these have been echoed in
my ears and imprinted upon my
heart. A community thrives when
it is in harmony with its
environment, empowering local
communities and conservation is
just as beneficial for the
people as it is for the land. It
fosters ownership,
accountability, and connection.
Conservation is also most
effective when guided by those
who know the land best. Local
communities understand the need
of the environment and can
implement solutions that are
both realistic and helpful for
their people. Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, hello, my name is
Maya Hayer. I'm 18. I'm also a
senior from Albuquerque Academy.
We support SB 48 because this
bill emphasizes partnering with
overburdened communities, which
in New Mexico, especially
relates to indigenous peoples.
Research from the University of
East Anglia found that when
conservation is guided by and
based on the knowledge of
indigenous people, the results
are much more likely to be
successful. This same research
found that when conservation
fails, it is typically because
it excludes or undervalues the.
knowledge and cultures of local
and indigenous communities.
Mexico needs to actively combat
climate change and the creation
of this fund.
is a critical step in that
process. However, in order to
make our solutions feasible and
sustainable, it is necessary to
prioritize community-driven
funding and planning. Thank you
for your time.
Hello, Madam Chair. My name is
Lou. I'm 18 and I'll be joining
my peers today at Albuquerque
Academy in support of SB 48.
Biking to reduce carbon
footprint seems like a
no-brainer, but without safe
passage to do so, driving is the
only option. My friend Augie
used to bike 1 mile to and from
our school every day, but he
stopped because on the sidewalk,
he felt like he was about to hit
pedestrians and on the road he
worried he'd be hit by a car.
New Mexico needs safe bike
paths.
When the distance or weather
make biking unfeasible, electric
vehicles should be a viable
option. School buses are the
perfect candidate for
electrification because they run
the same route every single day,
and they charge in the middle of
the day.
I hope you will consider passing
SB 48 because these funds could
be used to improve bike
infrastructure and to switch to
electric school buses, cutting
greenhouse gas emissions in New
Mexico. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Is Maria Avelos here?
Next, please.
Marvelos.
Buenos dias
is
do we have uh an interpreter for
the committee? Would you please
come forward?
So please do a sentence or two
and then have the interpreter.
No, it's right there. You don't
sit right with her.
Please.

Next is Justin Garroot and then
Maan Buddin, and then we'll go
to the um Zoom. Good morning,
Chair, committee members. My
name is Justin Groot, and I'm a
registered lobbyist with
Conservation Voterss New Mexico.
I'm speaking today in support of
both of these bills on behalf of
the Clear Horizons New Mexico
coalition, a partnership of
advocates from 30 environmental
social justice and conservation
organizations across our state.
SP 48 would establish the
Community Benefit fund investing
$340 million in communities
impacted by climate change,
accelerating the transition to
cleaner forms of energy across
the New Mexico economy. And then
SB 49 transfers these funds to

Who called New Mexico home now
and in the future. Please vote
yes on both SB 48 and 49. Thank
you. Good morning, Madam Chair
and members of the committee. My
name is Mai Bruden, executive
director of Sovereign Energy and
a tribal member of Gua Pueblo,

deployment and tribal capacity
building across New Mexico.
Under the previous federal
administration, we saw a
significant investments in
tribal energy development,
critical infrastructure
advancement and sustainable
work.
For development. However, recent
shifts in federal priorities now
threaten the continued
availability of this support and
put projects at pause, putting
both tribal nations and
important statewide climate
initiatives at risk. SB 48 and
SB 49 offer New Mexico the
opportunity to provide
consistent, vital resources
during this pivotal time,
ensuring that our tribes and
local communities can continue
to build energy infrastructure,
strengthen capacity, and lead
the way in the energy
transition. We urge your support
of these important pieces.
pieces of legislation. Thank you
for your time.
Thank you very much going to the
Zoom.
Uh, does Larry Sontag one if
this is the order that I was
gonna go down if, if they want
to speak. Larry Sontag, Bill
Leaf, and O'Reilly, and then
I'll go to the next group.
Madam Chairman Larry Sontag does
want to speak, but I'm in
opposition. I can wait until
later. OK. Thank you. Uh, Bill
Lee, are you in support?
Madam Chair, I am opposed.
Oh, OK, thank you. is fennel
Rowley.
Supporting
I am supporting.
However, there is a
Another member of the audience
here in the Zoom, I would wish
to give my
Space too.
Jonathan Harris.
Uh, please go ahead.
Jonathan, go ahead.
Thank you. Sorry, it took a
second for the host to unmute
me. Good morning, Madam Chair
and members of the committee. My
name is Jonathan Juarez, and I'm
here on behalf of Yucca, Youth
United for Climate Crisis
Action, where statewide
youth-led climate justice
organization whose thousands of
youth members and supporters
have been calling on this body
to invest in a just transition
for New Mexico, since we filled
the streets in 2019 for the
global climate strike. Young
people in the state know that
our future depends on the
responsible and funded
transition away from fossil
fuel.
dependence, especially for our
frontline communities.
Yucca strongly supports Senate
Bill 48 and 49 because it
represents an important first
step in investment in real
climate action, community
resilience and an equitable
transition away from fossil
fuels. We think uh the pro temp
for bringing this very important
bill forward and the committee
for considering it and our
future. As we all know, our
state is dependent on oil and
gas revenue. We're not just
complaining, we're paying
attention. State is locked into
an abusive dependent
relationship.
extraction that is polluting our
environment and our bodies,
costing us millions in public
health and clean up that the
industry should be paying, but
that we allow, because we're
scared to untangle our our
economic future from oil and
gas, but doubling down on that
dependence is not responsible
leadership. We need bold
proactive investments to make
our community more resilient in
the face of climate crisis. New
Mexico has the opportunity to
lead in the fight for climate
justice by ensuring public funds
are used to benefit the.
people, not polluting
corporations. This fund directly
invests in front line and
overburdened communities,
helping those most impacted by
the climate crisis, to move to a
more sustainable future. Yucca
urges lawmakers to pass SB 48
and 49, and ensure that New
Mexico's community receive the
support that they need to
thrive. We cannot afford to wait
any longer. Thank you.
Thank you. Um, how many? OK, so
we've used 15 minutes, we'll go
for a few more, and we will
offer the same for the
opposition as well, so I is Olga
grace supporting and wanna
speak.
Yes. Good morning, Madam
Chairman.
Members of the committee. My
name is Olga Grace. I live in
Las Cruces. I am a member of OA
and also a home daycare
provider, licensed for 12. So,
uh, firsthand, I can see
firsthand how important it is
for the Senate bill to get
everyone's vote, because as
renewable energy industries
growth here in New Mexico. We
need to support our communities
are black immigrant.
indigenous and people of color
to have access to this much
needed training and support so
we can have access to good jobs
that this industries produce.
Thank you.
Thank you. Uh, Tarre Villa.
Or Tehran
Hello, can you hear me? Yes, and
you're supporting.
Yes, I am. Good morning. Um,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Tarn Beer.
I'm from the public of Hamas and
I am a registered lobbyist with
the Mexico Native Vote.
New Mexico's oil and gas
industry has been, um, at the
forefront of
Of, uh, the state of New Mexico
for the past 5 decades. It has
led to New Mexico becoming the
2nd largest oil and gas producer
in the state.
This bill, the Senate Bill 48,
the Community Benefits fund is a
transition away from this legacy
of mineral extraction and
displacement.
We extractive industries have
historically forced indigenous
communities and local
communities to step away from
traditional land stewardship,
environmental preservation and a
sustainable community practices.
Generations of mineral and
fossil fuel extraction have
disrupted the cultural and
ecological balance that defines
the Mexico, prioritizing
short-term economic gains over
long term sustainability. We
think as, uh, the bill sponsor,
Senator Mimi Stewart, for
introducing Senate Bill 48, a
path back to New Mexico's
strength, and
We encouraged the com uh this
committee to support what they
do pass. Thank you all.
Thank you, and Teresa Tenario.
Hello, can you hear me? Yes.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, uh,
thank you for this opportunity.
My name is Teresa Tenorio. I am
chair of the New Mexico Voices
for Children Action Fund, and I
encourage your yes vote on SB 48
and SB 49. I'm speaking to you
specifically about something I
have experience on electric
school buses provide a healthy,
quiet and clean way for us to
transport our students, um, I'm
speaking to you today from my
home in Las Cruces, and Las
Cruces public schools is
Among the first school districts
in New Mexico to obtain some of
these buses, and as a school
board member, I proudly voted
yes to approve their funding.
They work great and our Las
Cruces student writers and bus
drivers love them. Having
observed the installation of the
charging stations, and as an
owner of an EV myself. I know
how critical it is to invest in
the infrastructure and its
expansion for sustainability and
continued adoption, it is very
reassuring to see this in the
bill. Thank you, Senator Stewart
for
Including $60 million in SB 49
to help fund electric school
buses for the districts that
choose to embrace them. Thank
you for your attention this
morning.
Thank you, Mike Eisenfeld. OK,
and Fennel Rowley.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Fennel Riley. I'm here
on behalf of Earthcare. I'm part
of a generation that has grown
up hearing about everything that
is wrong. The climate crisis
polluted air and water, and
attractive economy that doesn't
serve us, but I'm here today
because I want to talk about
what's possible.
I want to talk about the future
we can build together if we
choose to fund it.
These bills presented here today
invest in the future, I want to
be a part of.
A future where our schools are
powered by a clean energy and
students ride to school and
electric buses, breathing clean
air instead of diesel pollution.
A future where our communities
are designed for people with
safe streets, pedestrian paths,
and bike lanes. We're getting
around is clean, healthy, and
accessible.
A future where families don't
have to struggle to pay their
energy bills, used to homes are
energy efficient. The state is
investing in cost saving
programs that work for everyone.
A future where our land and
water are protected.
Not sacrificed for conservation
is a priority, and we invest in
keeping New Mexico's natural
resources healthy for
generations to come. The future
where workers are supported in
an economy that is, that is not
built on extraction and
pollution for good jobs exist in
clean energy. Sustainable
agriculture and industries that
don't poison our communities. A
future where public funds are
used to support people, not to
prop up polluting industries.
For years we have heard promises
about a just transition. These
bills are a step towards
actually making it happen. They
invest in the kind of
infrastructure workforce
training, energy efficiency and
conservation that will make life
better for all of us, not just
the wealthy few. I don't want to
grow up in a state that stays
stuck in the past. I want to
step into a future that is
thriving, sustainable, and just.
I urge you to pass Senate bill.
48 and 49, and invest in that
future.
Let's build in Mexico, we all
serve.
Thank you very much.
We are now moving on to the
opposition and uh I'm gonna
start with online, but if the
people in the audience who want
to speak would stand up.
And get ready, uh, and we had
about 20 minutes for the uh
proponents will do at least 20
minutes on this side if there's
that many, and in the meantime,
uh, I'd like to thank publicly
the New Mexico wildlife
Federation for our uh breakfast
burritos and uh beverages this
morning. Thank you very much for
doing that at the, oh.
Sorry,
OK, we have, sorry, Western
resources advocates, New Mexico
wild and Conservation voters in
New Mexico for the breakfast.
Thank you very much and uh we'll
try to keep that going for our
Saturday mornings.
Now for opposition back to Larry
Sontag online. Thank you, Madam
Chair, for coming back to me.
It's Larry Sontag here on behalf
of the New Mexico Business
Coalition. We do oppose Senate
Bill 48 and 49.
The allocation of 340 million
from the general fund would
divert needed resources from
other essential services like
public safety.
NBC would like to point out that
government funding is not the
most efficient way to drive
environmental innovation. Market
solutions are proven to to lead
to more cost effective outcomes.
Additionally, subsidizing
specific industries like
electric vehicles or renewable
energy distort the market
favoring certain businesses over
others without clear economic
justification.
The success of similar
initiatives outlined in Senate
Bill 48 is questionable, with
projects often yielding little
environmental benefit relative
to the cost. NMBC is also
concerned about the regulatory
overreach in Senate Bill 48,
requiring projects to go beyond
existing regulatory requirements
is a hard concept to grasp, much
less codify into law. This could
create complex bureaucratic
processes that could do the
opposite of the intended.
benefits mentioned by the
sponsor and other advocates.
Regulatory uncertainty is a last
thing businesses need to grow
and provide jobs for New
Mexicans. For these reasons and
more, we encourage the committee
to vote no on Senate Bill 48 and
49. Thank you.
Thank you, and
Bill Lee
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the community. Uh, my name is
Bill Lee, uh, president and CEO
of the Gallup McKinley County
Chamber of Commerce. We stand in
opposition to Senate Bill 48 and
49, and also opposed on behalf
of Terry Cole of the Greater
Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce
by appropriating $340 million
from the general fund, the Bills
FIR rightly points to what we
believe is the fiscal
responsibility irresponsibility
that would result in its
passage. This recurring
appropriation would most likely
financially.
In the general fund and
therefore violate the state's
constitution to maintain a
balanced budget. We also find
many issues with much of the
bill's terminology, terms such
as overburdened communities,
appropriate scale scientifically
determined restoration and
sustainable matter are all very
vague, can be far too subjective
and will create room for not
only misinterpretation but also
open up litigation in the
courts. The bill is not needed
in 2019 under executive order
New Mexico created a climate
change task force.
Whose chairs are rep and
representatives of departments
and agencies who have been
working and are charged with
basically the same initiatives
outlined in SB 48. For these
reasons and others we stand
opposed to SB 48 and 49. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you very much. And now
here to the room, um, Mr.
Winchester, please go ahead.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
Jim Winchester from the
Independent Petroleum
Association of New Mexico, um,
wanna start off by just saying
that we do appreciate the
intention of the senator pro tem
in this bill to help
communities.
But we do have problems with the
execution of these bills and
with these specific programs,
especially when we're talking
about $340 million of taxpayer
money.
These programs
Our aspirational.
But unfortunately have been
proven not to work.
And I will respectfully offer
just a few examples.
$40 million for fostering
economic diversification away
from fossil fuels.
We would argue that that
unfairly pushes clean burning
natural gas out of the equation
when it is the best proven
transition fuel that reduces
emissions.
$50 million directed towards
reducing combustion engines.
I think that the market right
now is voting against EVs.
They are sitting on sold on
dealership lots because they are
still so darn expensive and the
poorest community members cannot
afford them and are essentially
having to pay for them.
Even with a whole bunch of
subsidies already in place.
$25 million to train workers for
non-extractive industries at a
time when oil and gas is our
state's top employer with very
good high paying jobs.
Now there are other programs
that are equally problematic,
but I will yield to others for
the sake of uh time, but I just
would offer some closing
thoughts.
Um, massive subsidies like
these.
Do not work.
With this bill,
The government is picking
winners and losers.
And we urged the community in
this this community rather to.
Let the market dictate energy
choices.
IPNM stands respectfully
opposed. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. I'm
Ashley Wagner, the vice
president of government affairs
for the New Mexico Oil and Gas
Association. We represent over
180 member companies.
Nemoga opposes Senate bills 48
and 49 because we cannot
responsibly support the state
making an annual pledge with
such a large price tag for a
community benefit fund when
there have been multiple bills
introduced this session with the
intention of shutting down the
oil and gas industry.
Which accounts for half of the
state's budget and over 100,000
direct and indirect jobs around
the state.
We cannot have it both ways.
Continuing to inflate government
programs without having a way to
pay for them.
New Mexicans need the state to
be fiscally stable to ensure
security and growth.
If companies are forced out of
New Mexico, only a 3% decrease
in production at 65 $65 per
barrel of oil would be a loss of
over $350 million revenue to the
state. About the same amount
that would be required to fund
SB 48 and 49. Thank you.
Thank you very much there is
still time. Are there any other
opponents?
That would like to speak here in
the room.
Are there any other opponents
online that would like to.
But he was a supporter.
No, I'm only looking for
opposition.
OK.
Thank you very much to everyone
who came to speak on behalf or
against these bills this
morning. We are now going to uh
committee members and we will
try to alternate back and forth.
Senator Scott.
And then Senator Cio Lopez,
please go ahead.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator.
Do you consider it to be at all
ironic.
That the entire $350 million is
dependent.
On the successful.
petroleum industry in the state.
Chair senator, uh.
No, I don't.
Uh, we have plenty of other uh
areas of the state where we get
revenue, it's not all oil and
gas, it's about 30% of the
budget, so yeah, some of this is
probably from oil and gas. Uh,
what I find ironic is oil and
gas standing up and saying we
don't want to help our
communities with any money.
That's what's ironic.
So, yeah, Madam Chair and
senator.
My understanding that this is,
and I believe it was represented
this morning earlier.
Your presentation that this is
part of a three-wheel package.
Which includes
Senate Bill 4 is that?
Did I, did I hear that
correctly? Yes.
So
Madam Chair and Senator.
This would appear to be.
providing funds.
To mitigate.
The effects of a declining
petroleum industry.
Over the between now and 2050.
I that accurate?
Madame Chair, no, I, I wouldn't
say that.
OK.
Let's madam chair and senator,
let's
talk for just a minute.
About a cost.
Benefit analysis. Let's presume
for just a moment that we've
spent these hundreds of millions
of dollars between now and 2050.
And those programs have been
completely
You have taken.
New Mexico's emissions.
To 0.
What does that look like?
With respect to impact.
On planet Earth.
chair certainly uh Paris climate
accords every uh industrialized
country in the world are all
trying very hard to lower
greenhouse gas emissions, which
is the main culprit.
In climate change.
Everyone is trying to do that,
um, I believe we should be also
certainly the governor's
executive orders put us on a
great path.
For the last 6 years we have
made major improvements in the
way we spew greenhouse gasses
into the air.
Uh, that's a, that's a benefit
to many of the companies that
are here. Many of the larger
companies that are here are
already on track, uh, with
regard to cy before
and many of them have signed
international agreements or
agreements in other states to
follow these omission limit
targets that we have set.
So I believe that if we all work
together, that by 2050 we have a
chance.
To have our planet still be
viable and livable.
Uh, the scientist, tell us that
if we don't do that, we're going
to have an unlivable planet.
Uh, when it comes to oil and
gas, I believe they can be very
innovative. They've been
innovative, uh, they have
lowered emissions. I believe
they can be more innovative, use
some of their billions and
billions of dollars in profit to
continue to work on lowering
emissions, the major companies
of all said they have the goal
for 2050.
What they're working on, so I
believe we're all in this
together.
On planet Earth, and I believe
that if we all work on this, we
have a chance to have our
grandchildren still have a uh a
livable earth.
Madam Chasen, that was a great
answer.
But not the answer to the
question that I asked.
Let's presume for a moment.
That New Mexico is completely
successful.
Driving its emissions to 0.
By the year 2050.
What does that look like?
to planet Earth.
I am.
Um
Uh
For the information because I
had a discussion with another
committee member yesterday. The
etiquette in this committee is
not to um.
Attack, um.
Any other committee member or
the sponsors and uh to keep the
decorum.
And when we support somebody
else, that's great, but we don't
really argue with each other and
every committee operates a
little differently. So if you
have questions or comments, we
appreciate it, but we're gonna,
you know, keep the etiquette.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, and senator, this
is absolutely crucial.
To this conversation because
There is significant cost.
The New Mexico taxpayer.
Consequence of these policies.
I submit.
And unless this can be refuted.
That there is no.
Benefit
The atmosphere of this planet.
That can be measured.
Madam Chair and Senator, would
you agree with that?
Monie no
And Madam Chair and senator, can
you back that up with any
scientific evidence,
mathematics or science that
would support that answer.
Chair the science is there for
anyone to read, in fact, I have
a 4 page bibliography that I'm
happy to hand you based on all
the research that we've done.
The science is clear unless we
lower greenhouse gas emissions,
uh, we're gonna be burning up
the planet even more.
And the evidence is ever
present. Rioso.
Almost lost the whole town.
A calf Canyon and northern
fires, 600 people lost their
homes, uh, and we lost a
beautiful mountain of forest, so
the resulting flooding that
happened all of these are part
of the weather that we're seeing
now, the planet is warmer.
January was the warmest January
in history.
2024 was the warmest year in
history. It's 70 degrees in
Albuquerque today in February.
Uh, it impacts our animals. It
impacts our.
It impacts our dirt.
When we burn up.
Thousands of acres, uh, we have
dirt that doesn't hold water
anymore and that has uh uh.
Uh, the lack of ability to even
grow anything.
Uh, we're doing this now all
over the world, and all you have
to do is turn on the TV or read
the newspaper.
Uh, we have plenty of scientists
that are telling us, sounding
the warning bell asking.
Countries to lower their
greenhouse gas emissions, among
other things, were heating up
the water.
We're heating up the gulf of
Mexico where heating up the
Arctic Circle, you know, you can
now run but a ships right
through the North Pole, uh, that
you didn't ever was not able to
do in the past. We have whole
towns in Alaska that are having
to move because the thermafrost
is melting and they're sinking
into the ground. They're having
to move the entire town.
We have
We have islands all over the
globe.
That are also having to think
about moving because the water
is rising because the ice caps
are melting because of the heat.
For the most part produced by
our burning of fossil fuels, and
I've got 4 pages of a
bibliography to show you all the
references for that.
Madam Chair, let me
Senator, let me be perhaps more
specific with my question.
What will be the impact?
Of Senate Bill 4 and these two
pieces of legislation.
On the temperature of the
planet.
In 2050.
Let me be more specific than
that on the temperature in New
Mexico.
In the year 2050.
What change will this effect?
Madam chair, I hope the
temperature's lower in New
Mexico.
Yeah, Madam Chair and senator,
with all due respect.
I don't think I'm getting due
respect, madam chair.
Um,
Madam, uh, I mean, Adam Protem.
I know you want to come up here,
I'd be happy.
I have other ways to spend this
Saturday, um, I did, if you feel
at some time that you feel that,
please do bring it up,
otherwise, uh, we'll continue
the discussion.
Madam Chair, I'll, I will submit
that there is
Nothing that New Mexico can do.
Nothing
Taking the state back to the
Stone Age.
That will impact
The temperature of this state.
And we'll further submit.
That all of the monies that we
spend to trying to alter.
The course of climate change is
wasted money. Let me.
If I could move on.
We talked about
Uh
Job creation.
And I have, uh, in my
possession, a University of New
Mexico green jobs report.
That listed uh a number of jobs
that could be created.
Over
Over the next many years.
As a consequence of green
energy, uh, Madam Chair,
Senator, do you know what that
number is?
Um, Madam Chair, I haven't seen
the report, Senator.
OK, Madam Chair and senator, it
is several years old, but they
prediction was that as many as
8000.
500 jobs in green
energydustries.
could be created. Do you have
any information?
Contrary to that number.
A mad I'm sure I don't know that
number, but I do know that uh
New Mexico's #2 in the country
and the number of renewable
energy jobs that we've created.
OK.
So all of these programs and,
and the
In the dismantling of the
petroleum business.
would cost a number.
Of good high paying jobs.
Particularly in the corners of
the state southeast, and
northwest corners.
Do you know what those numbers
are madam, I don't, but I will
uh refer uh the senator to the
uh first page of Senate Bill 49
uh when we talk about
diversifying and promoting the
state's economy by fostering
economic development
opportunities.
Prioritizing projects from
target industry including
aerospace.
Bioscience.
Creative industries,
cybersecurity, film and
television, outdoor recreation,
sustainable and value added
agriculture intelligent
manufacturing, etc. so I believe
our state is on a path to create
jobs and all kinds of
industries, uh those that we've
named here and we certainly are
asking for economic development
to uh follow these guidelines
in.
Those job creations.
Madam Chair and senator, it's
very interesting that you
brought that up because I was, I
was just about to.
And I guess the question would
be,
Do any of those industries
require
Energy
To
Develop and grow.
Come on, chair, well, of course,
and nobody is arguing that we
don't need good energy and I for
one, I'm grateful for the energy
we've received through oil and
gas, we've been able to use
those funds well in this state,
so there's certainly anything,
there's nothing in these bills
that stops us from moving
forward with oil and gas, uh, we
just want it to be a little
cleaner, apparently so to those
companies. They've signed on to
these uh limits.
in multiple states and in
international agreements.
Madam Chair and Senator, I would
submit.
That zero emissions by 2050 is
more than a little cleaner.
Madam Chair and senator, are
you?
Aware of the economic
development opportunities that
are coming to the forefront with
respect.
To, uh, data centers and
artificial intelligence if you,
have you heard of those?
Opportunities that are out
there.
A man chair, certainly I've
heard about that.
Can't get away from AI these
days we're already using lots of
places.
And Madam Chair and senator, you
are aware, I presume then that
the projection is that 500.
billion dollars.
We was expected to be expended
in those activities in the
coming few years is, is that a
number that you would agree
with?
Um my chair, I've heard numbers
like that.
And Madam Chair and senator, you
are.
I, I suspect also.
That with zero emissions policy
and the lack of power.
It is currently available in the
state that all of those economic
opportunities will blow through
New Mexico like smoke through
our fireplaces.
Uh, Madam Chair, and my attempts
to try to remain on the bill. I
want to refer the senator to
page 2 of 49 section 3 $100,000.
From the community benefit fund
for grid modernization,
resilience and reliability.
So we certainly are
recognizecognizing that we need
electric infrastructure. It's
one of the biggest needs, and
that's why we have committed
$100 million to that.
part of the community benefit
fund, which is non-recurring, by
the way, a several of the
opponents said it was recurring
its snots, recurring dollars.
And Madam Chair, Senator, you
are aware.
I'm sure.
That the grid modernization.
Might be able to improve.
Transmission and distribution of
electricity, but would do
nothing.

Is that an
Madam, I'm not sure. I'm not the
scientist.
Uh, Madam Chair,
I'm on a
I'm I'm a native.
With a bottle of water and I'm
going to defer to my colleagues.
For the time being, but what
Like another bite at the apple
at the appropriate time. Thank
you very much and thank you,
Senator, for your answers. Thank
you, and they're bringing water
as well. Um, I have next
centeredilla Lopez and then
Senator Townsend, then Senator
Pope.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, I'm not gonna read Article
20 section 21, like I did last
year and congratulate you for
following it, uh, but
congratulations for following it
because the, the provision in
our uh constitution is that the
environmental environment
preservation of the environment
is a fundamental um.
Uh, importance in our state and
I really am so impressed by this
bill.
Because, um, it takes
A carrot approach to cleaning up
our, our environment and uh
taking steps as opposed to a
stick, and I think that what it
does for the workers, um, and
the communities in our state is
incredible. Um, I also
I'm very happy with
The idea of uh of burdened
communities and, um, I wanted to
ask about um Madam Chair, the
comment that most of the state
is a is a environmentally
burdened community.
Can you expand a little bit
about that, Madam Chair.
Um, madam chair, senator, I.
I think it does a disservice to
say that the whole state isn't
overburned community that's just
not accurate at all.
Mean you've heard.
From some people who live in
communities where the pollution
of the air of the land, the
water is significant.
So I think it's important that
that's why we put it into every
one of these climate bills that
we will pay attention to our
communities in New Mexico.
So now what's, yeah, that's it's
an unfair statement, it's just
not an accurate statement.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I've
had the opportunity to play with
the environmental screen on the,
on the equal protection on the
EPA website.
And when you put in New Mexico
and you put in some of the the
census track data and some of
the
The
Um
Zip code data and you, you start
playing with that, what you
notice is the state seems to um
A lot of the most polluting
industries in our state seems to
be located in communities with
higher rates of asthma.
higher rates of cancer, higher
rates of toxicities. So what
this bill does, I think is also
protect workers in these really
important industries that we
have, uh, like the oil and gas
industries. I think that.
My, my interpretation of what
oil and gas has been saying more
recently is they want to clean,
uh, keep the environment clean,
and they want to protect these
workers and I see this bill as a
way of helping them, uh, protect
those workers, um, so I, I, um,
I guess the, the, the process
that went into identifying the
where the money spent, um, I
heard from the comments that it
was a very comprehensive
process. Could you share a
little bit about how
how that was.
Uh, thank you for that question,
uh, Madam Chair.
So
We had a group of 4 to 5, uh, I
call them young people.
Who started doing research on
this it it wasn't as much
research as just compilation of
information. What have we done?
What have we done in the last
six years and it's significant
and you heard that in the last
committee meeting. Um, where do
we need to go? Where are we at
with our uh emissions. Um, how
far have we gotten with the
governor's executive order.
You know, the last 6 years.
The, the industry, the oil and
gas industry has really cleaned
up a lot of their emissions
because we put in the methane
rule because we put in other
regulations, so um.
You know, so we, we've looked at
the research and then we had
meetings with multiple people.
Um, we looked at what we've done
in the past because the last 6
years we've we've also tried to
codify the governor's climate
goals and that hasn't worked, so
I, I had to look at why did the
other bills didn't work.
And then do something different.
And so what we did different was
try to pull the science in, try
to pull the research in, try to
really look at what we've done,
what's missing, um, how that
executive order worked how her
next executive's development.
And I, I don't know if we
actually got this handout to
you, but.
We've also looked at.
Projects
That have been not funded that
have been requested from all
over the state, uh, we've got
1.3 billion listed 29 projects
alone in San Juan.
Um, that came from cities or
counties, um, or others to do
exactly what we're talking about
worker training, a mission
control mission reduction, uh,
so we know about the need and
the communities because we've
been not funding this need for
many years, uh, so I'm really
proud of this particular bill,
um, because of the work that
went into it uh.
Talking to communities, a couple
of my young people have traveled
all over the state to get input.
Um, we have a school in Animas,
Animus High School, who all
wanted to come up to support it.
We went down there to see what
was happening in Animas, so we
have plenty of projects around
the state and uh hopefully we
can get. I, I also, of course, I
support this bill. I think it it
is great and I'll just, as you
know, for the 1st 2 years I was
here, I wanted to put a a pause
on some of the activities of the
oil and gas industry because we
didn't have enough data. It was
nasty. It was just, and I
stopped because exactly what I
was concerned about was being
addressed both by the rulemaking
and the regulations that the
industry was, I mean that the
state was working on and also by
industry, industry reducing
emissions, so I stopped, um,
because it just really wasn't
necessary anymore. I think it
was necessary after the Martinez
administration in which nothing
was done, um, and so I
to and very, very proud of this
bill, um, and I, I
I just
I'm in awe of the work that went
into it, um, and the way the
creative way in in which it
addresses such a big problem. I
don't think it's ironic that the
oil and gas, uh, that
That some of these um
Some of the money comes from
royalties from oil and gas
because the oil and gas on
public lands in the state of New
Mexico belongs to the people of
the state of New Mexico.
So industry made a lot of money
exploiting a resource that
belongs to the people, and it's
only appropriate that this money
go to fixing some of the
problems that have been caused
by the exploit the the
development of the people's
resource. So I'm, I'm just
delighted to support this bill.
Um, I
I'm in awe and I really want to
thank the sponsor for the
incredible work that went into
it.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Uh, we have Senator
Townsend, Senator Pope.
Center itself? Did you want to
be on the list? OK, and then
Senator Charlie? No? OK, so
Senator Townsend, please.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. Um.
Do you believe that this bill
has a chance to create enough
jobs to pay.
Um, madam chair, it's an
interesting question. I hadn't
thought about it like that.
Um
But possibly hadn't given it
much thought.
I understand that, um, Madam
Chair, um.
Senator
In the event
That it takes
Let me back up.
Senator
I think
It is
If you do the math.
And look at the amount of jobs
and payroll.
That would be required in order
to generate enough.
A
To make this job.
Make this project
Even half
Sustaining.
It is a tremendous amount of
jobs.
Also, you have to, I would hope,
when drafting this.
You had to consider the impacts
of other revenue sources that
would come in.
So, I don't think it has the,
it, I.
I don't think it has the
capacity to do it, but I'm gonna
move on.
$100 million dollar grid grid
capacity expansion.
How much grid capacity expansion
are you seeking and
And where, I mean, what, what
part of the grid are you trying
to
To harden.
You know, madam chair, this, I
haven't thought about where all
these projects are gonna be
because I'm not the one that
wants the projects. These
projects are wanted by the
cities and counties all over the
state.
The 1.3 million, 29 projects in
San Juan, uh, now we just found
projects that worked.
Uh, funded that they wanted um
agricultural working lands, uh,
community engagement, uh.
Economic development I mean
there's all kinds of areas of
the state that could benefit
from these funds. The purpose is
to benefit the communities. It's
not us.
Telling them what to do.
I mean, I've certainly uh
Senator Munoz and I are really
united on this electric part
because that's who he's hearing
from. He's hearing from people
that need electric
infrastructure, so, um, this is
not for me to decide. This is
for the communities to decide.
Madam Chair
My question was,
Can you, can you just $100
million is not chump change.
I'm trying to find out where
that money is being spent. Is it
in my community? Is it in your
community? I mean, where, 100,
where is that $100 million? Do
you, do you have a couple of
examples of where that where
money is being spent. I mean,
that's what I'm trying to find
out.
So, Madam Chair, we've, we've
had the grid modernization fund
for I think 3 or 4 years, it
came from the house, um.
You heard from our uh.
The people that worked for the
governor that.
Um, these funds are needed. They
haven't been able to give money
to people that want to do this,
so.
Uh, it's, it's not like it's all
parceled out, it's not, it can't
be because this has to come from
the communities, and I will look
on here to see if I can find a
project that wasn't funded uh
for electric uh for grid
modernization, um.
The applicants came from local
government, state governments,
nonprofit, energy companies,
private companies, educational
institutions, tribal
governments, labor unions, um,
Transportation is a biggest
amount now these are just
projects that we found all over
the state that are shovel ready
that didn't get the money.
And that its projects like this
that the community benefit fund
is for.
Maner
Uh, when I looked at one of the
handouts and and.
This one.
It shows a $230 million project
request in where do I find that
detail to know what that $230
million. Um, Madam Chair, we'll
get that for you.
I mean it's just one of my
researchers that have found
these projects and we'll get
that information to you. I don't
have it now.
Um
One of the things that I am
I was concerned with in in
reading.
These pieces of legislation.
Was that we have a energy
transition Act that has mandated
a pathway.
And, and people have uh
providers of our
across New Mexico have, uh, I
think, done a.
Really good job of meeting
those.
And when I look at this,
And I see these mandates.
Um, or these expenditures, not
maybe they are a mandate. I
don't know, I don't know what
the heck they are, but if, if
they are like there's $50
million for EV.
Bicycles and charging stations,
if I remember what's on there.
Is that in communities that are
embracing that or is, or is it
a, are you going to require
certain communities to
To build that much
infrastructure, how does that
How do people expect this money
to impact their community.
Um, Madam Chair and a senator,
if you look at page 3 of 48, um,
it does require that uh
documentation that community
meetings with the community have
been taken place or a community
benefits agreement negotiated
with the overburdened
communities, so there is a
requirement for these projects
to understand that part of their
community.
and to uh work with uh everyone
in their community, including
the overburdened folks, so
there's no, this isn't a
requirement. This is an
opportunity.
For communities to do what they
need, um, and we certainly, you
know, we certainly are showing
that communities have all kinds
of ideas or just not funding
them.
But
Madam Chair and Senator.
Is your vision that these will
be
will be
Communities, you will only
impose.
I want to say impose. I don't
think that's what you're trying
to do, but.
Do you believe that this money
will be only spent
And those
Um, communities that are
identified or will it be?
In out across all communities,
whether they're identified or
not. How does that, how does
that work?
But Madam Madam Chair and
senator.
So the fund sits in the
Department of Finance and
Administration. It is open to
communities to access a funds,
uh, they just have to make sure
communities that they work
together, um, that everybody in
that community has taken part in
it.
Um
So it's not a mandate.
I don't have things that I
already know should happen, uh,
we certainly have heard from
communities and on the
proponents are excited about
thinking about using these
funds, uh, so and the way we've
designed it is such that the
money can be spent.
There isn't that there there
will be an application process,
but the money is there
immediately for these
communities to use.
Madam Chair and senator.
One of the issues that I hear is
different from what you just
said.
I'm sure there are communities,
and I wouldn't argue that there
are communities that are looking
for
Those expenditures, but we heard
member organizations that had a
couple of 100 companies involved
that were not uh supporting
this, we heard.
Greater Albuquerque chamber, I
believe, that didn't support it.
There's a, there seems to be
A large number of what I would
call core businesses that
support the state.
They're saying, I'm out.
This is too much.
Too quick.
With too little detail.
And they're very concerned.
Um
One of the things that I have
heard
Probably
2 dozen comments on this.
Bill
From my constituents is
The fact that
We're promoting
EVs, and I understand why you're
doing it, Madam Chair.
You're looking at it from an
environmental impact.
But they don't pay anything to
support road maintenance.
So the more that we, of those
that we put out there.
The last gas tax that we have
going into road maintenance. How
do you see us offsetting that
and when.
Uh, madam chair, so there's
there's no EV mandate in this.
This is the ability of
communities or school districts
to utilize these funds.
And
I, I know that there's an issue
with the road fund, and I think
we should fix that as an issue.
I, I don't have a solution right
now for you, uh, we certainly
have uh still have uh uh taxes
on EV vehicles so they they pay
those same taxes, uh, so, uh,
that's a different.
A problem then this bill is
looking at, but I, I agree with
you, we need to solve that.
One of the other, uh,
That I have, we talked a little
bit about it's gonna be 70
degrees in Albuquerque today and
That was unusual. It really
isn't unusual.
When you go back and look in
history, uh, in 2015, it was 70
degrees in Albuquerque.
And in 1617, 1819, 2021, 22, and
23 it was lower.
So
If you're looking at trends,
It wouldn't support the problem.
As you described it.
I would also say that
If you, there's a great website,
um, when we were talking about
what oil and gas puts into each
community.
And um on on the Namoga website,
you can go out and you can look
at
How much tax dollars go into oil
and gas into each of these
communities. It's millions of
dollars.
Millions of dollars.
And this compared to that.
is not on the same.
playing field.
I mean, if we are if we removed
that.
Income to these.
Communities, every community in
New Mexico, we're we're gonna be
in trouble.
And we're gonna be in trouble
for two reasons. Number 1,
You won't have the
Income stream for these
communities. We don't have the
jobs to protect it. We don't
have the money to support this.
I just can't
I'm not, I am not opposed. In
fact, I have, I have promoted.
Separate occasions in the house.
A bill that would require New
Mexico Tech.
To go out as a third party.
And look at and come back to the
legislature and say if we reduce
oil and gas.
Part of fuel consumption by this
amount over this period of time.
What do we do?
How do we back it up?
And we haven't been able to get
that done, and I think
That we continue to go down the
road.
That we don't know where the
heck we're going.
We don't know how we're gonna
pay our bills.
We, some have the heartthrob
that this is the thing that we
have to do, you know, but
I, uh, when I look at
historical.
I don't think my grandchildren
are in trouble.
I mean, if you look at what oil
and gas has done over the last
15 years we have
You know, quadrupled production
and at the same time we've
reduced emissions.
I think we ought to be embracing
that as a community, and I mean,
do we, can we do more?
Absolutely.
We should do more. I'm not
arguing that.
But
To pick and choose.
The winners and losers.
Do not describe
That the market has an influence
in the Mexico.
I think we're, we're missing the
boat. I um
I appreciate the
Tenacity that you bring these
bills forward.
I'll help you.
Uh, understand the tenacity that
I have to oppose them because I
do not believe it's a good bill
and I don't believe it's good
for New Mexico, but I appreciate
you bringing it forward. Thank
you.
Thank you very much. I have
Senator Pope, then Senator.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Madam Protem and.
I appreciate you bringing this
forward some of the other
advocacy groups in on this.
So important.
Um, and I say that with all due
respect that I support the bill
and that's where these questions
are coming from.
So just to clarify and confirm.
This bill and, and I, I read it.
There's nothing in the bill that
says that you're shutting down
oil and gas operations. Madam
Chair,
Pope, that's correct.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. Um, second
question, does this bill say
that folks?
Or forced or have to buy an
electric vehicle and they can't
buy a gas powered vehicle.
Madam chair, that's correct,
doesn't there's no mandates.
I don't want.
Thank you. Um, and then,
Another question, I, I know, um,
we've
Passed and you led on clean
fuels and some of the other.
Type of projects renewable
energy, lower emission fuels.
Um, would you say that this is a
path.
Or to even get closer to zero
emissions and maybe allow folks
to still use their gas powered
view.
For a while. Of course, we'd
want the opportunity and them to
be able to purchase an EV, but
is this maybe the avenue for
them to still be able to do
that.
A man chair that that really is
part of the purpose of this, we,
we've been hearing that you're
you're in the education
committee I've heard I'm sure
you've heard about the the push
to get electric vehicles for our
students instead of the diesel
but this provides money for that
without a mandate. Everything's
voluntary, um, so thank you for
the way you've described it,
it's accurate.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator, and um, you know,
I just love this fun. I wish
there was a little more money in
it, um, as you know, Madam
Chair, Senator, um, I don't want
to promote my own bills, but we
had a local solar access fund
trying to maybe tap into this as
well. So I think this is so
important because we're hearing.
From communities, rural, tribal
about getting money for grants,
getting money for solar panels,
getting money for battery
storage, right? A lot of cases
they do not have the manpower
for the grant writing or don't
have the matching.
Money or for the funds at the
federal level.
So even things like this, I'm
sure.
Um
I'll just close with some
comments and say,
Um
Climate change is real.
Yeah
We all know this.
You can look at the data from
Noah, you can look at the data
from NASA, you can look at our
climate.
Scientists
There's rarities and spikes in
weather going up and down.
Sometimes we can still get snow.
In May in Colorado because of
the elevation. It doesn't mean
climate change.
Doesn't exist.
You know, so many folks are
waiting for us to do something,
and sometimes we kind of feel
like, are we too late?
But this is something that puts
us in the right direction.
And maybe we can turn this
around.
Or maybe we just
Keep it steady where we're at.
And we learn to be resistant
with what has happened.
In our world.
As far as the
Comments about what we're doing
here in New Mexico. Does that
have any?
While we're not the drivers and
as far as
You know, emissions out of our
vehicles and
Um, everything else.
We're the #2 oil producer.
And we're putting emissions in
the air.
It doesn't stay in a wall in.
contributing.
Um
If it cuts down 5%.
That makes a difference.
Um, I look at this.
When I was growing up in the 80s
when we were working on uh
chlorofluorocarbon, CFCs, right?
And canisters and it was
damaging the ozone.
And there was so much talk about
we can't, we can't get off of
this, we need this and
You know,
We won't be able to run our
refrigerators. We won't be able
to run our HVAC, you know, folks
won't be able to use their
hairspray.
But we knew we had to change.
The US stepped up in that. The
world stepped up.
And we change the directory with
the trajectory.
And uh we changed what was
happening in our ozone layer.
And that's what we have to do
here.
And so
If it's just us in the
beginning.
Or a few states
That matters.
Mm
I want to go back to
As a country that we lead.
Regardless of what China's doing
or what anybody else is doing.
Let's lead.
And if folks takes them a little
while to follow.
We'll build that technology,
we'll create some economic
development and eventually
they'll get on board because
it's the right thing.
Madam Chair, Senator, thank you.
I'll be supporting the bill.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, uh, Senator
Ruel, and then anyone else on
the list?
We'll cir circle back for a
second time, very briefly, uh,
Senator, yeah, this is your
first time, you have more time.
Thank you Madam Chair.
A Senate, uh.
Some protein.
Oh
I understand.
I want to point out.
What the oil and gas industry
does contribute.
And
Just $1 difference in the price
of oil and gas does make a
fluctuation and I've got all
these numbers written down right
here and it's very interesting.
There's a $1 fluctuation in oil
and gas dropping $1.
That's $129 million to all state
and local revenues is $68
million to our budget up here
that's $11 million to our local
governments and $51 million in
state funds like early childhood
education and all the education
programs.
If there's a 10 cent
fluctuation.
Drop in the price of natural
gas.
That means $58 million to our
state and local revenues.
$38 million increase in our
budget up here $4 million
decrease in our local
governments in $22 million that
will be lost to programs like
early childhood education.
Madam Cheer
Will our renewables be able to
step up and get those that
funding back.
Uh, Madam Chair, I, I'll just
remind you that this bill has
nothing to do with reining in
any oil and gas that were
producing now.
I'll just say that, you know,
and I appreciate Senator uh
Townsend talked about all the
money that they put in the
counties and communities we
appreciate that.
This is really to try to help
communities do something to help
them.
Uh, with the.
Pollution that happens with oil
and gas, among other things, uh,
this is a way to give
communities the way to electrify
to uh do more with um.
To actually get projects funded
that they've been trying to do
for a long time. So I don't, I
don't, I'm not this this doesn't
have anything to do with the
replacement of oil and gas with
renewables.
So I, I, I understand, madam
chair, where you're headed?
That's not the purpose of this
bill, uh, it's not really the
purpose of any of the bills that
I have.
It's really to try to rein in
greenhouse gas emissions so that
we have a cleaner air.
No oil and gas is on track to do
that. Many of the companies are
already at the first level, uh,
that's not.
Not uh the target is not till
2030. Several of them are
already there. They want to be
clean. You heard that earlier.
So it's a way for us to clean up
the air and the emissions so
that we're not. Yeah, we're 2nd
in oil and gas were first in the
number of emissions were
releasing.
So it's not, it has nothing to
do with replacing olive oil and
gas for with renewables that.
That is not the purpose of any
of these bills.
Madam chair
Uh, senator proteum.
Whenever we are tying your two
bills that we are here
discussing today, back to your
Senate bill for, to me, that is
where we are wanting to go.
is to do away with the oil and
gas industry right now.
Uh, the premium basin has
reduced their emissions by over
26%, and I think that's
remarkable, but we also have the
United States Forest Service,
who has done us no favor.
They have literally tried to
burn up our state. Are there
harmful.
Things in the air coming from
these horrific forest fires that
have been the direct cause of
the United States Forest Service
and why aren't we saying what
are y'all doing to help?
To help sustain our forest.
And make it where they are
contributing to the safety and
welfare of not just our.
Population here, but our
wildlife population as well.
Well, I think we're doing that
already we've got just a great
forester, Laura McCarthy, and
she has all kinds of groups
working on watershed
restoration, etc. for try to
move forward uh to get over
these fires, and yeah, the uh US
federal government.
was partly responsible if not
wholly responsible and they've
tried to make us whole by
uh sending us more FEMA money
and more people.
But Madam Chair and Senator
Protem.
The reason we have these
catastrophic fires is because
the US Forest Service has not
maintained.
Have not held up to their end
end of the bargain. I'm gonna go
past that right now, OK?
If we are trying to achieve zero
emissions by the year 2050.
I, I want to point out some
things that are very troublesome
to me in your in your field here
in both your bills here and how
they tie into your Senate Bill
4.
Madam cheer whenever we are
starting up this community
benefit fund, which is start uh
your house built for Senate Bill
48, excuse me.
Uh, and it's very plain right
here on page two of that, it
says reducing methane leaks and
releases attributed.
To the extractive industry, does
that also include copper mining
and any other extraction
industries that do happen to be
in our state.
Uh, Madam Chair, yes.
And Madame Cheer is is uh.
I'm assuming that
Is very closely tied to the
copper industry, is that
correct? I'm not quite sure what
you're referencing, OK, whenever
we're talking about.
Whenever we are talking about
these industries that do drill.
We're still gonna have to have
these industries is that not
correct?
Um, Madam chair, this bill does
nothing about, you know, doing
away with any oil and gas,
nothing. Madam Chair, that's not
where I'm going you you want.
Methane leeks and all that.
To be minimized, I get that.
I don't think there's a person
here in this room that doesn't
want clean air, clean water,
healthy foods.
The ability to enjoy.
Our life to the best that we
can.
We don't want anything harmful,
even.
OK, I'm gonna stop right here.
But when we're talking about our
electric grid.
capacity right now there's a
service company out there, out
there that is 2 years behind.
And servicing some of the
activities that do go on in the
oilfield industry. 2 years
behind.
If we are going to reduce the
use of carbon engines through
transportation projects which
include
Increase electric vehicle
infrastructure or bicycle and
pedestrian infrastructure.
We have seen what this has
caused.
The automotive industry in the
state of New Mexico.
Many
Of our local automobile.
Affiliates throughout the state
have had to drop er makes and
models of vehicles because they
do not have the capacity.
To put in charging stations make
the changes to their software
and be able to.
Electrify.
These cars that are coming in
plus the price of them are
exorbitant. What is this doing?
To our automobile dealers in the
state of New Mexico, these
people are going out of state
buy the vehicles. As far as
electric school buses go, if
there is a
Um
School district in the state
that want to provide electric
school buses to transport their
students to and from school.
That's great if they can get
the, go through their local
school boards to get that done,
that's fantastic, but I have a
problem with several areas of
our state.
And I want people to understand
this we have kids that are
riding over 70 miles to school
one way.
And they are coming down out of
the hills to go to school.
These buses will not be able to
get them back home, I'm afraid.
Get them to or from school
especially if there's adverse
conditions also.
Because of these batteries that
are going in these schools is
absorbent.
And the disposal fee not only
for the school buses but for the
cars as well. There is a
disposal fee on those.
Whenever we're talking about and
I'm, I'm on a rant right now. I,
I just need to get this stuff
off my chest right here
sustainable thank you very much
because it does need to be said,
madam chair, whenever we're
talking about sustainable
agriculture.
I have seen the prototypes of
new tractors, electric tractors
that are coming out.
They are very, they look like
something out of Star Wars they
are very different than what
we're used to.
It takes over, uh, what is it 18
hours to fully charge these
tractors 18 hours to charge
these tractors they can run 6
hours.
By being fully charged.
With no implement behind them.
And as far as I can tell, every
person out here in this audience
and that may be listening
online.
Does like to eat, madam chair,
this is not gonna be able to
feed our citizens if we go down
this route if we mandate zero
emissions.
Madam chair and senator.
Electric bicycles, that's great.
That is, but they're still gonna
have to have tires on there.
They're still gonna have to have
copper to get those batteries
working.
Um, let's see.
Agricultural production and land
and natural resources that
pertains to human health.
Madame chair right here.
Farmers and ranchers are the
best stewards of our lands that
we have. It is not any other
agency that can do a better job
than our farmers and ranchers in
our state. We are the ones that
are putting food on the table
and we have to protect our land.
If we don't protect our land, we
don't make a crop.
I just want to point that out
because.
It is very important that we do
have safe food instead of having
imported from some foreign
country, Madam Chair.
I, going back to the buses I'm
going through my notes that I
have taken whenever everybody
has been talking.
As far as installation of the
bus charging stations and the
cost of the electricity, is that
going to be up?
To the local school districts to
pay for those installations and
pay for the cost of electricity.
But Madam Chair, what school
districts need to have electric
buses is electric
infrastructure.
That is the part of the
community.
Be fund.
so they could ask the state to
help with that electric
infrastructure.
And Madam Chair and.
Senator pro him.
I understand that, but whenever
there is not enough energy on
that grid to be able to get that
done. What happens then? Because
that has happened to several of
our communities throughout not
several, many of our communities
throughout the state, which
brings to mind.
Are all areas of our state
electrified now.
I'm sure I, I'm not sure what
you mean by that. I know that
several years ago and I, I think
you were still serving in the
house, a Madame Chanenator
approached him whenever we there
was a problem regarding the
Navajo Nation.
Because there were so many areas
up there that did not even have
electricity. They did not have
running water. Has that
particular scenario changed.
Madam Chair, it's it's getting
better. We have those San Juan
uh project that we, um, we have
paid to get.
Further into the Navajo Nation
all the way down to Gallup, so
we're on track to ensure.
That that area of our state has
more water and electricity.
Madam, cheer whenever we are
still talking about zero
emissions by 2020 and what your
two bills here today are, are
proposing, especially for the
under, I think the word was
underserved, is that correct? I
might be wrong here.
Um
An overburdened communities,
overburdened, and I'm also
looking at the underserved.
Whenever we're looking at that,
we had a problem a few years
back.
Whenever that we had a huge
blizzard in the state of New
Mexico, there was no
electricity, there was no gas
service coming in.
There were several areas north
of Santa Fe that did have to
rely on their fireplaces to be
able to heat their homes.
Whenever this
Zero emissions.
Clean energy standards go
further.
What will be the status of these
homes as far as what how they're
going to be able to elect a have
to heat their homes to keep
their homes cool, to have
reliable electricity in their
homes.
Um, Madam Chair, senator, uh,
several years ago we passed this
uh community energy efficiency
block grant.
That is specifically for issues
like this, we, we put 20 million
in, it was cut down to 10 that
was spent in the first year, so
that is part of the community
benefit fund, it's specifically
for homes that you're
mentioning.
Madam chair, the grid
modernization.
It's gonna have to really.
He bolstered into our state.
We have, uh, the need for
irrigation purposes, we need to
have the, the means.
To be able to benefit our
municipal areas as far as our
small towns and villages in our
rural areas of the state.
We have problems with our roads.
And
Right now, uh.
I'm not seeing the fact that
electric vehicles are bringing
to the, the improvements of our
means of transportation by our
highways and byways.
I know what bills are roads. I
hope everybody here in the
audience understand what does
build our roads. It does take
the extraction industry.
To be able to provide that
asphalt.
It does take semi trucks to get
that.
The material out there to build
our roads.
You're paying for it at the pump
to help maintain our roads, that
is also the means of getting our
good store stores throughout the
state.
may be brought in here by trains
but to get it distributed, it
does take trucks to get that
done, Madam cheer, I'm going
down through the your second
bill that we are discussing
today.
And
Let's see, um.
On section 4 on page 2 of Senate
Bill 49, you are talking about
uh.
Let's see, the
Transportation project fund
project fund for transportation
related projects that reduce the
use of carbon engine vehicles,
including for bicycle pedestrian
infrastructure and pedestrian
safety.
I think bicycles are great.
But not everybody can ride a
bicycle.
And not everybody can afford
electric bicycle.
We do have these uh new things
in the town of Rosville.
Visitors can
Use their credit card and charge
minutes to these little scooters
that run around town. I is this
going to be?
Applicable to tractors.
To semi trucks to airplanes.
Whenever you're talking about.
Reducing the use of combustion
engine vehicles.
So Madame Chair, this, this is a
the transportation project fund.
They do transportation related
projects we're giving fund
funding to that.
To give them money for
transportation related projects
that reduce the use of
combustion engine vehicles, so
this is a way for them to uh use
money for their projects that
don't involve uh combustion
engine vehicles.
OK.
Madam Cha just flipped over here
and I saw a note that I was
referencing back over here
whenever you're bringing that
up.
Um
Madameur and.
Senator Proteum.
Do you happen to know the cost
of an electric bus.
Electric power.
Electric powered.
Uh, man, I, I.
I think it's between 350 and
400,000.
And so, Madam Chair and senator.
Oh Tim, and that caused us is
that.
But paid for by either a private
provider of the buses or by the
school district itself.
So Madam Chair, for electric
vehicle buses, um, that would
come out. Let's see here.
So, uh, this is the funding is
transferred community benefit
fund.
It's the
Schools, facility authority.
Um, that does a, a buses.
Uh, so the funding would go to
them and this is for a 2 year
period. This is for charging
infrastructure.
At the school districts, that's
the first thing they really need
and the difference in cost
between upgrading from a diesel
bus to an electric bus, so they
can apply for this funding
school districts that want to do
this. Everything in this
community benefit fund is
voluntary and coming from the
community, so any school
districts that wants to go to.
electric vehicle buses has this
pot of money to tap.
Madam Chairin protium, and I
appreciate that explanation
there.
So it is up to these.
The community benefit fund that
goes out all over the state now
since we're
Taking a lot of money away from
what actually does pay the
bills.
It seems to me like
There might be some pushback
from different communities
whenever their taxes do go up
through a bond proposal, and I'm
just stating that because I know
it will.
Um
Also on
Senate bill 49.
It is also talking about the
batteries right there.
Does New Mexico right now have
storage for these batteries once
they are spent, whether it's
through a solar, whether it's
through.
Your car or your electric buses.
Is there a disposal?
place right now within our
state.
Madam Chair.
Senator, uh, there are
Private organizations that
actually
Refurbish and recycle those type
of batteries and they're located
throughout the state and
throughout the country.
They are located throughout the
state that's OK, I did not know
that. Has there been Madam Chair
and senator Potium and I'm
sorry, miss, I forgot your name,
Adrian.
Um
Has there ever been a problem
with any of these batteries
exploding and causing fires that
the firemen may not want to.
us to the
Seem to be able to put these out
because of the noxious fumes
they put off.
And the answer is yes.
Yes, manager. Thank you very
much for agreeing with me
because we can't document that.
Um
Madam Chair
What you're trying to do here
does sound good, it's sound
good, feel good feel and and I
understand where you're going
with this because as I said at
the very start of
My questioning.
Every one of us wants clean air.
Clean water.
Safe food.
We want the best for our kids.
But I don't see that this is a
way of getting it done without
killing one industry that does
provide everything that we do
have going on in our state. I
also know that this is a
recurring cost.
And that is pointed out in the
bill in the FIR and Madam Chair.
It's
I think that the majority of
everybody that came here today.
They are involved with the oil
and gas industry in one way or
another, they either came in a
vehicle because they're tires on
the car.
The oil that they put in their
car, the gasoline or diesel that
they put in their vehicle if
they rode their bicycle the same
old strew.
If they walk, they might have
had on a pair of tennis shoes
and that rubber sole on that
tennis shoe.
Thank you, Will and guess if
women, if you're wearing
lipstick, attribute to that.
Along with your lotion.
Attribute that to your oil and
gas industry.
Madam Chair, I just want to
point this out we can't kill.
The golden goose
And expect this other to take
place without working together.
There needs to be a balance here
in the way we're heading with 0
emissions by 2050 it's not going
to get the job done, madam
chair, senator Prote, thank you
very much and Adrian, thank you.
That's all.
Thank you. Um, I am going to
Senator Scott for the 2nd time,
very briefly, and then we're
going to a motion so we can move
on to the next big bill after
this, these two. So Senator
Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
was intrigued by this handout
that I believe.
You've prepared and I'm on.
Backside of that.
Looking at the various types of
projects.
And I was curious about Madam
Chair and Senator White air
quality got such a
On a portion
So Madame Chair, senator.
This is just a first attempt at
finding projects. We just wanted
to find projects all over the
state that haven't been funded.
That have been requested and not
been funded, so.
This is not full, uh, you notice
that we found more in Burnley on
San Juan, they each have 29 up
but for the others we just tried
to make sure we found at least
one in every county. This is not
a full and complete, uh, uh
analysis of the unfunded need in
our communities.
Uh, thank you for that answer,
Senator, and
Madam Chair sender, it would
appear though that there are not
very many folks.
Around the state.
Concerned
About air quality.
Given
That's what came in here.
Madame chair I that is.
It's just not.
Well, that's, that may be what
it looks like, but.
You know, if you look at the
rest of it, energy efficiency
pretty significant renewable
energy quite significant.
Transportation, so air quality
is part of energy efficiency,
renewable energy, etc. so I I
would not read too much into
that if I were you, uh, we can
certainly go back and find a lot
more air quality if that's what
you want us to do.
Uh,
not necessary at this time.
Hm
No matter of chair and senator,
I'm sure we'll have another.
Conversation about this bill
before.
Gets out of the Senate with
respect to Madam Chair and
Senator community engagement.
Could you tell me exactly
I mean, I see all of these
yellow shirts here in support of
this bill and
You tend to generate or the
state tends to generate a lot of
support when we're fogging money
out the door.
So could you describe more
particularly what some of these
community engagement projects
and how they might impact the
environment.
Or uh
I proposed here.
Uh, Madam Chair, I apologize,
but I can't do that. I don't
know that level of detail with
this hand up.
OK, and
And Madam Chair, Senator, with
respect to the economic
development piece, I think.
We've already discussed how
Economic development in the
state.
Absolutely I mean available,
reliable, affordable energy
crucial.
To economic development you
believe listed.
A number of industries that all
require significance amounts of
energy to grow and prosper.
Do you have any?
Information with respect to
economic development that would
not require.
The development of more
emissions.
Uh, not sure, I just don't know
how to answer that question. I
don't have the information he's
looking for. OK.
If we move down to renewable
energy, Madam Chair and Senator,
I
I know from conversations with
various utilities.
That there is significant
concern developing.
With respect to additional
penetration.
Of renewable energy into our
electricity markets.
Because it will require
Dispatchable energy.
And the associated costs.
With that
Combination of renewable and
dispatchable.
That would
Significantly increased costs.
The New Mexico consumer.
And Madam Chair and Senator, can
you address those concerns?
But Ma of chair Senator, I would
have to look at the.
Where you got that information
so that I could also look at the
information I cannot address
that at this time.
Well, Madam Chair and senator, I
would have hoped that this would
have been
Take it under consideration
during the development of this
bill, but let me move on. I've
got one more.
And that's workforce
development.
As emissions move to zero,
Senate Bill 4.
We sunset the petroleum
industry.
Which currently
Generates as I recall from
Namoga and other sources, about
135,000.
High paying a lot of those in
the Northwest and southeast
parts of the state, well away
from the population centers, but
nonetheless significant.
Contributors
The, the economic prosperity of
the state.
is in this workforce workforce
development projects. Is there
anything, Madam Chair, and
Senator, that you have on the
horizon?
That would come even.
Within a whisker
Of replacing
Those
Do
Ma'am chair,
senator Scott, there is nothing.
In any of these bills.
That undermine and stop us using
oil and gas. Nothing.
Now we do want them to continue.
As they are of lowering
greenhouse gas emissions.
And they're on board with that.
That 8 or 9 major oil and gas
companies in the state have
already signed on.
To these limits in other states
and in their international uh uh
community.
So you know, many of them are
already at the first goal
already.
So I'm not thinking about what
you're asking because I'm not
doing anything to undermine the
oil and gas industry in the
state.
We just want them to lower their
emissions.
Continually
They're doing it so far because
in the last 6 years with the
governor's current executive
order.
They were required to do that.
Madam Senator, I would submit
that.
2 million barrels of oil a day
and billions of cubic feet of
natural gas.
are completely inconsistent.
With a goal of reducing
emissions in this state.
0.
Let me ask this
We have one instance.
And that was the energy
transition Act and this is
directly related to workforce.
Where we saved with the energy
transition Act.
About 4 million metric tons.
Of emissions per year.
Senator and Madam Chair Diel, do
you remember that?
Piece of legislation.
Madam Chair, I was close-sponsor
of the legislation.
Uh, thank you for that senator
and Madam Chair, and you are
aware that the consequences of
that legislation were the loss
of approximately 1000 jobs.
Mostly in the Navajo community
and as miners and workers in
that power plant. Now, as I
recall.
Madam Chair and Senator, there
was, uh, senator, we're on this
bill, not the ETA, so, um, I'm
gonna ask you to wrap it up,
please. Oh, this is, this is my
last comments, Madam Chair, and
I appreciate your.
Indulgence, but
There was $40 million in that
energy transition Act allocated
toward
A workforce retraining a lot of
the same goals that are on this
sheet.
And I guess the question that I
have is.
How's that working out?
You know, Madam Chair of the uh
the when we looked at these
projects there's 29 in San Juan,
um, they're definitely um trying
to uh move their workforce to
mine reclamation.
And to renewable energy.
P&M is building renewable energy
projects up there, so we're not
talking about the ETA today.
Trying to move forward with
community.
Madam Chair and Senator, can you
imagine this scenario?
Where hispanic oil and gas
production worker walks into the
kitchen.
Takes off his hard hat.
Just down the kitchen table.
Pours himself a cup of coffee.
He says to his wife, honey, I
lost my job today.
We're gonna be all right.
Because we're coming into full
compliance.
With the Paris climate accords.
And net zero emissions.
Thank you, Senator for your
answers and thank you, Madam
Chair, for your
Indulge
Thank you, Senator Hamlin. Madam
Chair, I have a motion for a due
pass as amended.
On 2nd we on Senate Bill 48 and

bringing this forward.
We must commit to being
aspirational.
The future that we want for our
children and our children's
children.
It doesn't have to differ from
our most audacious hopes.
So it's my honor to support this
bill, and I thank you, Senator
Stewart, for planting the seed.
In our lifetime, my lifetime or
your lifetime, we may not taste
the fruit of the seeds that
you've planted here today.
But I know the fruit will
nurture and sustain.
Those who are coming are future
generations.

Would you like me to get that.
Yeah.
But everybody, please keep

Could everybody please keep
going so we can start the next
one.
On the
Under
Please continue moving out of

Bring it up.
Then go 5.
We've been here.
Have you
I.
Yeah.
No, she said she should have it.
Would everyone who's coming in
for this bill, please proceed so
we can get started.
We are starting.
The presentation.
On Senate Bill 5 is amended.
The game commission reform, the
sponsors are Senator Campos,
Senator Wirth, and
Representative McQueen.
And I'd welcome Representative
McQueen and Senator Compos
today.
And who would like to start with
the discussion.
And uh members, you do have um
Amendment, but let's hear the
introduction, please. Thank you
very much.
I'm sure, of course, members of
the Senate Conservation
Committee.
It's uh an honor to be here in
front of you today to go ahead
and present Senate Bill 5.
Which in
as we
is gonna go ahead and be a
landmark.
legislation
continues to reform.
well
Uh, the
game and fish department, but it
now.
passage of a piece of
legislation like this.
If you will, the wildfire uh
department. I'm sorry, not the
wildfire, the wild
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm gonna get it right. I'm
just dealing with a lot of these
different uh issues, uh, anyway,
with our wildlife uh department
and uh I'm gonna make a comment
in regards to the uh the
wildfire piece in terms of this
as well.
With me, of course is
representative McQueen who uh
has worked very hard on this
particular piece of legislation
for many years and in that he
knows the technicality of the
bill, but more importantly, as
he goes forward, uh, he has had
uh many conversations with, with
many groups as uh as we've uh
talked about this particular
piece of legislation.
So Madam Chair, just very
quickly as I go forward, uh, as
we have gone forward over the
years we have had strong
bipartisan support on many
portions of the bill.
Uh, for decades I have worked on
the fee structure when it comes
to the bill itself.
Uh, possibly the last time that
uh.
Increase was about the year
2006, so we go back two decades
before or the last time that we
had some fee increases.
Along with that as we move
forward through this whole
process.
We're all looking forward to
continuing to ensure that
We have a healthy wildfire
management systems, wildlife
management system, uh, which
means a healthy communities, a
healthy food supply, and a
healthy economy.
One of the things that I would
like to mention goes back to
exactly that term wildfire
because I'm still dealing with
many of those issues within the
northeastern part of the state
and of course, uh they're in the
Riodoso area, but as we deal
with it, that in itself has
destroyed so much of the habitat
habitat for our uh wildlife in
the intent of a bill like this
is to help us so that we can
make uh more improvements as we
move forward.
Uh, to ensure, if you will, uh,
a better habitat for our uh our,
our wildlife.
Moving forward, uh, just very
quickly, uh, Madam Chair, and of
course, members of the Senate
Conservation Committee.
When we deal with all aspects of
the uh wildlife system in our,
uh our state.
What this does is it brings
together if you will, the need,
if you will, for additional
resources as we move forward,
moving along with that it also
brings together if you will, a
new mechanism in order for us to
not only have the members of the
uh which would be termed the uh
wildlife commission.
Uh, named, but also as we move
forward, how there would be
individuals who would bring
together, if you will, the
scientific aspect as well as the
practitioner aspect of what we
deal with.
The remarks that I'm making are
just the uh platitudinal pieces
as we move forward and the
reason that I state this because
As we see the change in our
environment as we see the change
with uh overall what New Mexico
is going through, as has already
been mentioned with some of the
speakers regarding the previous
bill or bills, what we're seeing
right now is a complete
rechange, if you will, of what's
gonna happen here to the state
of New Mexico. And this bill
definitely addresses so many of
those aspects as we move
forward, uh, with that, Madam
Chair, what I'd like to do is to
defer to.
uh my co-sponsor on this bill
again who has done so much work
and uh it's important that we
hear the remarks that he
continues to make so that uh if
I could just go into defer again
to my sponsor, and then after
that, Madam Chair, what I'd like
to do is to ask our uh
Experts to uh uh introduce
themselves and then also be
available for some of the
comments that uh would be made.
Representative McQueen.
Thank you Madam Chair, good
morning, senators. Good morning
former representatives. It's
good to see you all again.
Um
The, uh, in the interim, the
governor's office convened a
large stakeholders group to work
on this bill.
Including the department.
Um, we've addressed, uh, many
different issues and concerns,
and we have a very solid bill
with broad bipartisan support.
our co-sponsors the Senator
Brantley, who could not be with
us today.
Uh, this bill is a package. It
has 4 parts.
The first part is that it
clarifies.
the agency's mission.
So the agency already um.
Uh, conserves and manages a
broad range of species and
that's noted in the FIR.
This bill gives the agency the
authority to manage species that
they need to manage and
discretion to manage them or
not.
So the discretion is vested in
the agency in the commission.
That's the first part, the
mission change.
The second part reforms the game
commission itself.
Uh, and we've had a commission
in the past that has had a lot
of turnover, uh, typically when
a new governor gets elected, the
entire commission will turn
over.
Um, we've had vacancies. It's
been uh difficult to keep fully.
Fully appointed.
And as a result, there are times
they haven't been able to meet
corn, so they haven't been able
to meet.
Um
This bill maintains the
seven-seat commission, uh, there
are 3 at large seats, uh, those
seats require some experience
and expertise with wildlife
hunting and fishing issues, uh,
and they have geographic and
political diversity
requirements. Then there are 4
position seats.
Uh, a rancher farmer, a hunter,
angler.
Conservations and scientists.
Um, and the idea of the position
seats that is that these are
perspectives.
What represented on the
commission.
So these people aren't on the
commission to represent an
interest group.
They're there to have uh to make
sure that we have that
perspective, uh, on the
commission.
Uh, it's often asked.
Why in the agency that does so
much on hunting and fishing,
there's only one hunting hunter
Fisher position.
And there's a couple of answers
to that.
First is under the current
statute, there are none.
Um, you know, that's not called
out in the current statute.
Yeah, we routinely have multiple
hunters and anglers on the
commission, and it's certainly
our hope and expectation that
that would continue.
So the way it's set up.
If you have, for example, uh a
rancher.
Someone pointed to the, the
ranching position.
There's, it's not to say that
they are not a hunter. They can
also be a hunter.
You know, there are, there are
different because the categories
are fairly open. We can have
people that have different
backgrounds serving in uh
multiple positions.
Um
The bill also creates a
nominating committee.
Um
And this is an important change
from uh previous uh bills, uh,
the game commission bill passed
with broad bipartisan support
two years ago was pocket vetoed
by the governor, one of the
governor's concerns was that the
under the prior bill, some of
the appointments were being made
directly.
By the scent pro tem, the
Speaker of the House, and the
minority leaders of both
chambers and so instead of doing
that, we're having those
individuals appoint people to a
nominating committee, nominating
committee will vet uh applicants
and send a list to the governor
and the governor will pick from
the list. So this is the same
way we do regions, the same way
we do judges, the same way we do
the PRC and so our hope is that
Uh, through that process, we'll
sort of insulate the uh the
commission from the politics.
Uh, that have been uh a factor
in the recent past.
There's also 4 advisory
positions. These are new, uh,
these are state agencies that
serve uh in um uh non-voting
capacity, the outdoor recreation
division, the Department of A,
the state land Office and the
Department of Indian Affairs and
what the intent of that is is
simply to increase
communications.
Uh, in collaboration between
these departments.
That's the second part of the
bill.
Third part of the bill increases
hunting and fishing fees.
So this is something the um
Uh, department has asked for for
a couple of years, uh, they have
not been increased.
Uh, in almost 20 years.
There is broad support, uh,
including among the hunting
fishing community, uh for these
increases and you'll hear from
some experts on that.
And the bill also adds a CPI
adjuster so that the fees can
increase.
Be increased by the department
in the future.
Um, with the consumer price
index.
That's the third part of the
bell.
The 4th part of the bill.
Isn't in the bill.
The 4th part of the bill is
funding for the agency.
And in the budget, there is in
the uh the growth fund, the
government.
Results and opportunities fund.
I think that's what it's called.
There's 3.5 million over
3 years, so 10.5 million total
to manage a non-game species and
the reason that is, um.
is because, you know, when we
started this effort many years
ago, we heard from the hunters
and anglers.
That the agency was funded by
fees from hunters and anglers,
and then it wouldn't be fair to
expand their mission to include
other species without expanding
their funding.
And we always agreed with that,
uh, and so that we have money in
the budget to do exactly that.
And they are receiving
approximately $3 million a year
already through the land of
enchantment Legacy Fund, uh,
which we understand is being
used for non-game species.
So we appreciate the governor's
office, uh, efforts to bring
people together. We appreciate
the agency, we've been in
communication with the
leadership of the agency, uh,
and we appreciate the work that
all of their staff do.
Uh, I believe it's, I believe
it's time for this bill, um, I'm
really pleased with where we are
with this bill.
Uh, and I would ask for your
support.
Uh, and with that, uh, we would
like to have, uh, Jesse Dubell
with Mexo Wildlife Federation
and Judy Coleman with Audubon
Southwest Meek.
I'm gonna hold on their comments
until we uh take care of your
amendment. OK. And uh committee
members.
The committee analysis includes
the amendment analysis as well,
it's the amendment is in your
books in front of the um.
Bill
So please uh take for, could I
have a motion for discussion
purposes.
I still move Madam Chair, I
moved the amendment for
discussion purposes.
So let's
Let's hear the, uh, discussion
on the uh amendment to Senate
Bill 5 as amended.
Uh, man, I'm sure I just walk
through the amendments to
explain them briefly. OK, so
the, the first, uh, the First
Amendment we're striking two
Senate Rules Committee
amendments, uh, there were 2 of
the amendments in the last
committee that were in error and
so we're striking those from,
from that committee report and
then they reappear uh properly
stated in this amendment.
Um, you see that reflected in
the amendment 2, which deals
with the title.
Um, and then, uh, because we're
repealing two sections of law,
one of those sections was, uh,
the number was stated
incorrectly.
Um
Amendment 3 is language for the
uh rancher farmer position.
Which is language requested by
the cattle growers, uh, and
we're incorporating that there.
Um
Uh, Amendment 4 we're increasing
the nominating committee from 7
to 9.
Uh, the governor's office
thought the governor should have
2 additional appointees to the
nominating committee.
And so we're accommodating that.
Um
In
And and so the next Amendment 5
is a technical amendment,
Amendment 6 are the two
additional positions.
Uh, Amendment 8, we're changing
a shall to a May. This is also
one of the changes from the
Senate rules.
So,
back to um
Item 6 on page 7, you're
striking.
Language.
Um
Ma'am, Chair, we're just moving
the end.
Because we're adding a
subsection, we're adding
subsection 3.
Uh, two members appointed by the
governor.
And we put that in the middle
and then we, there's still a
tribal member also appointed by
the governor.
And this is on the nominee.
I
Is that clear?
No, it's not clear. Are you
following the amendment numbers?
So my amendment is 230174.4.
OK, just a minute.
Just
I'm, I'm sorry, I'm looking at
the rules amendment.
Forgive me.
No, please proceed.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
So Amendment 8, we're changing a
shell to a May, this is in uh.
Things that the department takes
into consideration in rule
making, um, we actually changed
a shell to a May.
In set rules and we changed the
wrong child to the TMA, so we're
just changing that.
Uh, Amendment 9, we're adding
sustainable food supply to one
of the considerations, one of
the amendments in Senate rules
was striking the purpose.
of the bill.
Which we know happens all the
time in the Senate. There was a
purpose in existing law that's
also being repealed, um, but we
felt that, uh, sustainable food
supply was an important
consideration.
Amendments 10 and 11, uh, we're
striking the word policy, uh,
the department indicated that
these activities they would do
by rule, not by policy.
Amendments 1213 and 14 were
substantially reducing.
The increases to the trapping
fees for uh trappers, junior
trappers and fur dealers, there
was there were objections to the
amount that they were being
increased.
So we're we're cutting those in
half.
Um, and then in.
We're remembering some things.
Amendment 16 is the repeal.
So, that's 1711 is the purpose
statement that's in existing
law. The Senate Rules Committee
amendment had 171 17, which was
the wrong amendment.
And then, uh,
Uh, section 12, the, the
effective date.
It's a different portions of the
bill take effect at different
times. The fee increases take
effect sooner. The new game
commission rules take effect
January 1st, 2027, so they will
apply uh to the next governor.
Yeah, I think that's it on the
amendments.
Thank you. So,
We only on the amendment.
How many people in the audience
support the amendment. How many
people oppose the amendment.
Um, so, uh, we have the people
online probably don't have the
amendment yet.
I we're not on the bill.
OK, so because everybody here in
the audience supports the
amendment, we're not gonna hear
testimony on the amendment.
We will go to comments from the
committee members on the
amendment only Senators.
Madam
Very much. Senator and
Representative, I do have a
question regarding uh item.
3
On the amendment.
We're stating, uh, let's see,
let's see, actively works at
growing and selling livestock or
crops from a ranch or farm where
at least 2 big game species as
defined by and for which hunting
is licensed by the department
are frequently present.
So I need some clarification.
Representative Zell.
Mm
No, my apologies
uh chair Center.
Brazil.
Um
So this is language that
Uh, reflects the current law,
um, it's actually multiple
changes that were requested by
agricultural groups,
including agricultural groups,
um, there was one concern, so
To the big game issue, um, it
previously previously said.
Uh, game animals licensed uh for
take.
Um
But that includes apparently a
certain type of squirrel.
And that wasn't uh that wasn't
the intent.
You know, so we changed it to
big game.
And became is defined by the
department.
So that's narrowing of that
provision.
And there's also, there was a
concern that
You know, someone could own a,
you know, quote unquote own a
ranch.
But not really be involved in
agriculture.
You know, um, and we wanted to
make sure that this was the seat
was filled by someone who was a
working farmer or rancher and
that's why we added that
additional language at the
request of the Cali California.
Well about cheer and
representative
give me clarification on where
at least 2 big game species
that's, that's my concern right
now.
Because some areas of our state
only have one.
Unless you're going to count
mountain lion in there possibly,
um, uh, so I've got concerns
here of.
East of Roswell they have an
abundance of pronghorn out
there.
That may be about it,
occasionally you might see a
coyote, but that's not
determined to be a big game
species, so I need
clarification, uh,
I don't have the list of game
species.
Jessie, would you know what that
list includes?
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, I, I
am familiar with the list, and I
think it's we would be rare for
a sizable ranch to only have one
big game species because black
bear mountain lions would be
included as well as pronghorn
mule deer, elk, etc. so in the
southeast portion of the state,
uh, Madam Chair, Senator, I
think you would be able to make
the argument that you have both
pronghorn and say mountain lions
that's been some amount of time
on those larger ranches.
And uh madam chair and
representative, and I'm sorry, I
don't know your name.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator
Roselle, I'm Jesse Dubell,
executive director of the New
Mexico Wildlife Federation. OK.
I'm assuming that would also
include Barbary's sheep.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator Elliott
Wood that Mister Madam Chair and
Representative and senator, my
concern there is a lot of these.
Ras and you say big ranch.
There's no definition of a big
ranch.
We have
I know what a ranch is. It's not
really a ranch, but we have
piece of tracts of property.
That are sizable
There is no license issued on
that even though these people
may be affected by
that come in and eat the apples
off their orchard tree uh of
their trees or you might have.
Mule deer out there that you
know how they can be whenever
they're starting to shit. So
why, why 2?
By two species.
Terrison or Zelle, I believe
that's a reflection of the
current language in the statute.
We, we carried it forward.
Madam Chair, I may have a
problem with this. Thank you
very much.
Thank you. Other questions,
comments on the amendment.
Senator Si Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I just
wanted um to compliment you on
adding sustainable food supply,
but she made a comment saying,
uh, some people uh are concerned
that's a policy. It's not a
policy it's it's or concerned
that that might be a purpose as
I understand it, it's not a
purpose, it's giving guidance to
the rulemaking, which I think is
very important that we do, um,
so I just wanted to clarify
that, Madam Chair.
Ma'am to center that language
was in our purpose statement,
which was deleted, so we moved
it just to make sure it was
still reflected in the bill.
Thank you Madam Chair, and I
actually disagree a little bit
with this judiciary on that
because purpose statements, um,
and I've talked to judges, give
guidance to the courts and how
to interpret it, but it is a
policy distinction, um, so I'll
just leave it at that. I do
support the amendment. Thank
you.
Thank you. We're on the
amendment, Senator Townsend,
anybody else on the amendment?
OK, Senator Townsend. Thank you.
Um.
Have one
Thought, question that you, you
had a comment uh representative
in your opening statements,
you're trying.
Like the politics out of
managing.
But we're adding 2 more from the
governor.
How do you size that up? I mean,
it sounds like to me you're
adding politics.
Uh, chair Senator Townsend, so
in, in the previous iteration of
this, we had
Um, the speaker, the same pro
tem, and the minority leaders in
both chambers, making
appointments directly to the
commission. These appointments
are to a nominating committee,
the nominating committee is
charged with vetting the, the
applicants, the candidates and
presenting a list.
So it is a step removed from
that, um, and that's, that's
what I mean when we're taking
the politics out that
You know, there's still
certainly politics involved, but
because it's a nominating
committee who will evaluate uh
candidates and applicants for
the specified criteria including
general knowledge of wildlife
hunting and fishing, um, I,
it's, it's at least one step
removed, and I think that will
be.
Better
Of Representative, I appreciate
that, uh, Madam Chair, I, um,
I didn't vote for this in the
last committee.
Um, I had studied a little bit
in the interim.
I don't think that's a good, I
don't think that's a good
addition deal, but um.
I think the nominating
commission.
is OK. I mean, I, I think that
does.
But
That's still just a little bit
too much of a thumb on the scale
for me, but I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you and Senators yourself
for the 2nd time on the
amendment, Madam Chair, thank
you very much for allowing me to
ask on all your fee changes that
you have listed in this
amendment, Senator and
Representative.
Is this applicable to just our
in-state, OK, I'm seeing it non
non-resident, OK, never mind,
but it is in loops.
I'm just trying to check it out
real, real fast.
But
let's changes.
Will this make an impact on our
out of state.
Meen Ael with the reducing the
fees in the amendment making
them.
Are we
In this particular area right
here where you are changing on
the amendment.
Because you have 123, OK, you
have 3 of them listed here.
Uh, can you tell me why there is
a change?
Um,
Maureenel, so in the in the bill
itself, those fees were being uh
increased more substantially.
And due to objections to the
size of the increase.
We reduced the size of the
increase. So the, the fee is
still end up going up, but not
by as much.
OK, and I noticed that now that
they are for juniors.
Madam chair and representative.
Uh hm.
Me center, if I may, the the 3
fees are resident fur dealer,
resident trapper and resident
junior trapper.
Madam Chair, I'm gonna hold off
on my other questions until.
vote on this particular
amendment.
OK, thank you. It was brought to
my attention that there was
somebody in the audience who
might have opposed.
Was there sorry?
If you would raise your hand.
OK, earlier I asked if that who
supported the amendment I saw
hands.
I asked if anybody opposed the
amendment.
You oppose the amendment. Do you
want to say something? If so,
you have to come to the middle
on the microphone.
Mad, Madam, you have to come to
the middle on the microphone,
this is being webcast for the
public.
It's not my rule, it's the
legislature's rules. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh David
Sanchez, uh, in the membership.
I, I oppose the amendment in its
general sense, and I'd like to
reserve my comments for the main
bill if that. But you don't have
something specific about the
amendment.
Well, we have a problem with the
language as identified in the
bill and in the amendment.
But for time purposes, I, I
would like to reserve my
comments for uh when the bill is
being if that's OK, that's fine,
but we are going to be voting on
the amendment, so you're I'm
fine with that. OK. Thank you
very much then.
Thank you. So, um,
Back to the amendment.
Any other further comments.
So let's take a, we have a
motion for discussion. Is there
a motion on the amendment, Madam
Chair, I move the amendment.
Is there a second?
OK, there is a 2nd, uh, so let's
call the roll.
Well,
We had uh hope and Hamlin
fighting.
Senator Hamilton
It was
So could you please call the
role on the amendment to Senate
Bill 5 as amended.
Senators of artists, excuse
Senator Charlie. Yes, Senator
Charlie, yes, Senator,
Senorel, no, Senator Hamlin.
Senator Hamlin, yes, Senator
Pope, yes, Senator Pope, yes,
Senator Scott.
Senator Scott, no. Senator
Townsend.
The Townsend, no, Senator Lopez,
yes, Senator Sadia Lopez, yes,
said Stephonics, the phonics,
yes.
So you have a 5 to 3 on the
amendment. Um,
We have another amendment
coming.
So, uh, and it needs to be
shared with the sponsors, but
I'm good right now.
So, not talk about it, share it
with them and in print. Then uh
we're gonna go to the proponents
and opponents on the bill. Do
you want your experts speak now
on the bill.
they could speak briefly please.
OK, so we have Jesse Dubell with
the Nexo Wildlife Federation and
Judy Coleman with Audubon
Southwest.
Uh, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, thank you for
allowing me the opportunity to
be here. My name is Jesse
Dubell. I'm the executive
director of the New Mexico
Wildlife Federation. Wildlife
Federation is the state's oldest
and largest nonprofit
organization dedicated to
advancing the interests of
hunters and anglers around the
state. Uh, we were founded in
1914 by famed conservationist
Aldo Leopold. We were also
instrumental in the creation of
the very first state game
commission back in 1921. The New
Mexico Wildlife Federation is in
enthusiastically supportive of
this bill for the first time in
history, we have a dedicated
hunter and angler seat on the
commission. Also, this bill
requires all state commission,
all commissioners serving on the
new wildlife commission to be
familiar uh with hunting and
angling in the state of New
Mexico. These are huge
advancements towards a better
commission. Uh, also like to say
that the Mexico Wildlife
Federation has been working
since 2019 on the fee adjustment
and we're very, very proud that,
uh, sorry about the microphone.
We're very proud, Madam Chair.
that the hunting community in
New Mexico is excited about the
fee adjustment. We're willing to
pay more because we support
conservation. We recognize that
the agency that manages the
wildlife we depend on.
needs more resources, um, so.
Committee members, thank you
very much.
Thank you. That doesn't happen
with my microphone
don't
I won't touch it, uh, good
morning, Madam Chair and members
of the committee. My name's Judy
Calman. I'm the New Mexico
Policy director with the Audubon
Society. Audubon works to help
birds and the places that we,
they need, we work on both game
birds and non-game birds, and
many of our members and our
staff, including our, our own
executive director are both
hunters and birdwatchers. Bird
watching is one of the fastest
growing outdoor activities in
the country, um.
They also contribute a ton of
money to New Mexico's rural
communities that contributes
over $300 million annually to
New Mexico for just one quick
example, the festival of the
cranes at Bosque della Pace
National Wildlife Refuge is the
largest economic annual event
for Socorro County, bringing in
160,000 visitors per year just
to see birds, and people travel
here from all over the world to
study birds and sea birds, but
the game and fish department
does not currently have the
resources and the tools to
monitor and help the species in
New Mexico, which
need the most help. Our
coalition has been working for
10 years to come up with a set
of policies to do this in New
Mexico, and we believe this
bill, pieces of which have
already passed the legislature
accomplishes these goals. We
appreciate the legislature so
much for supporting the work the
department is already doing.
through the land of enchantment
Legacy Fund and through this
year's growth fund proposal,
which Representative McQueen
mentioned and our coalition is
committed to supporting
additional funding mechanisms
for the department to do this
work.
We can do this in a step by step
approach that doesn't break the
bank. And I just want to close
by noting that the Audubon
Society regularly partners with
private landowners to help bird
species. We know that
agricultural land is a safe
haven for birds and farmers and
ranchers regularly support
habitat restoration and we work
with them to do that. And any
additional funding for the
department that we can
accomplish would mean more
federal matching dollars that
flow to New Mexico through
programs like the Farmvill, and
that's a good example of how
21st century wildlife management
system can work.
For all in New Mexico. So thank
you for having me today and I'm
looking forward to the.
Thank you. So we are now going
to the audience on the uh Senate
Bill 5 is twice amended.
Um
Is how many people in the
audience are proponents or
supporters of this bill.
How many people in the audience
are opposing this bill.
Almost equal online, how many
people are supporting.
OK, 3 in support, 8 in
opposition online.
So we will go, we're gonna hear
the uh supporters and opponents,
and then we will go to the
sponsors who uh react to the uh
proposed amendment.
So if you want to speak in
support, please come to the
middle.
Uh, there is a microphone and
you have a 10 minutes total.
Uh, to speak.
Is nobody gonna speak in
support?
This is it.
Please come to the middle.
but the sergeant at arms has the
microphone.
Ma'am, we have a list. Did you
want to go off our list or just
whoever stands up?
I don't have a list.
No
And the secretary doesn't have a
list. OK.
I was, I was given the list.
If you wanna send it up, we can.
Make sure.
stuff.
Yeah, go ahead.
We're on a time clock here. Good
morning, Madam Chair, members
Committee Garrettander Claas
with Mexico Wild. Uh, I'm a
lifelong avid hunter and angler
and a former hunting and fishing
guide.
Um, in my lifetime, the
commission.
Has had a chronic problem with
uh undue influence from special
interests and very rarely do I
feel represented as a public
lands hunter.
Um, I'd really like to see
changes made to that.
I also want to see more
transparency, uh, and expertise
on the commission.
And I think this is a great
opportunity to have that where
we can have biologists and
people that really know how to
steward our wildlife.
Um
I'd like to see all of our
wildlife.
Uh, game and nonspecies managed
holistically and not
specifically like we do with
some of our big game animals.
And I just also want to say that
stewarding our precious
non-game, especially species of
greatest concern benefit all
wildlife and especially game and
fish animals. So as a hunter
fisherman, I'm really excited
about this. I don't feel
threatened at all that this is a
takeover by uh
Treehuggers and stuff like that,
uh, really excited. Hope you,
hope you all vote for this.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Next, please. Um,
Madam Chair, uh, senators John
Crenshaw, I'd like to speak from
the perspective of guy who
joined the game and fish
department 51 years ago had a
career with them, uh, was an
officer, game warden. I've been
a lifelong advocate of hunting
and angling and hunters and
anglers. I'm one myself, and I
want you to know that from that
perspective I very much support
this bill.
When I came on 51 years ago that
happened to be the year that uh
the wildlife Conservation Act
passed, uh, the endangered
Species Act, uh, sponsored by
Republican Fred Rooss of
Albuquerque and carried to
fruition. It had a lot of
promise and the department did a
wonderful job and it's still
doing it. It can do better and
given the resources and the
authorities that are contained
in this bill, they can reach
that potential.
please pass it.
Thank you. Next, please.
Good afternoon. This is, uh,
Jennifer Black. I'm representing
Earth Keepers 360 as well as I'm
a wildlife biologist, a fly
fisherman,
um, I'm sorry, could you repeat
your name again? Jennifer Black.
Thank you.
leader and a mother, of course.
Um, I wanna support this bill. I
encourage you guys as well to
support this. As a biologist, I
know that our wildlife, we're
talking the big game, the deer,
the elk, turkey, trout. They
don't live in a bubble or a
vacuum. They live and depend on
the plants and animals, the
habitat, the make up that
diverse ecosystem. This bill
helps give us more natural
approach to wildlife management,
removing restrictive blinders
and having the vision and
flexibility to see not only the
game fish, um, that.
are previously protected, but
also to study the
interconnectedness of the
ecosystems that ultimately
provide the habitat and the
vital roles that support their
success. SB 5 also allows the
State Department to become more
financially sustainable, which
is great for our youth and our
children, and that they too will
have that opportunity to be
hunters and fishermen in the
future.
We need a creative, a flexible,
and adaptive wildlife management
strategy. 2 live out our
responsive, um, our, our roles
as responsible stewards of our
um most precious treasure, our
natural resource of wildlife and
habitat. So please, think of our
future.
Thank you, Director Sloan.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Mike Sloan, directors
of the Mexico Department of Game
and fish, and while the agency
has not taken a formal position
on the bill. We do appreciate
the collaborative nature, um,
that the sponsors have
undertaken and to support the
amendments. We do continue to
have concerns about the removal
process that's laid out in the
bill, and we look forward to
working with the sponsors on the
on that going forward. Thank you
thank you very much.
Next, please.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Zoe Barker. I'm the
conservation director at
Conservation Voters New Mexico.
In order to be brief and make
sure everyone else has time to
comment, um, I just want to say
that we stand in strong support
of both the bill and the
amendment this morning, and
encourage you all to do the
same. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Is there Eddie B.
Hill, Brian Bird or Saba.
Is Jadi here?
All in line. OK.
Uh, let's go to them next
because they're on the sponsors
list.
Eddie Bell
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name's Eddie B.
Hill. I represent the New Mexico
Association of Conservation
Districts, our executive
director has, has sat in on
these.
Of
On the, you know, the coalition
that's working towards this bill
for the last year, you know, not
everybody's getting everything
that they want in this bill.
But the big coalition has, has
worked together for the past.
Years to try to develop this
pill.
And this is about as close as we
can come to getting.
A bill that we like at this
point and we appreciate the
opportunity to support the bill.
Thank you. Yeah, Brian Bird.
Yes, madam Chair and senators,
my name is Brian Bird. I'm the
Southwest director of Defenders
of Wildlife and we represent
22,000 members and supporters
here in the state of New Mexico.
We stand here today in support
of the bill and it, um, you
know, we live in a state that is
in the top 5 of richness of our
wildlife and plants and the
entire nation were very special
for that and it, we, it's really
time to give the Department of
Gaming.
fish, all of the tools that they
need to manage this wildlife
richness in our state, and I
think this bill does that and it
sets up our department for the
21st century. They do a very
good job now with what they
have, but we think they need the
tools and the funding to really
cover the
The challenge of the 21st
century. So thank you for having
me here today.
Thank you.
Are you Saba?
Please.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, uh, for taking
this beautiful Saturday morning
to talk about this important
issue.
I'm Saba Ajadi, policy and
engagement manager with Trout
Unlimited. I'm a resident of
Albuquerque, longtime fisherman,
if not particularly successful
one here in New Mexico. Uh,
Trout Unlimited and the Angling
community support this bill
because it addresses three major
challenges that wildlife
management faces today.
An underfunded agency, a game
commission in need of reform and
a lack of clarity concerning
which species the department can
manage.
The fact is, we need to do more
for all of New Mexico's wildlife
and by extension, our outdoor
economy and our angling and
hunting communities coupled with
the new investments uh from the
land of Enchantment Legacy Fund
and this year's LFC framework,
SB 5 will put us on a pathway to
do just that. This bill has
broad support amongst the
angling and hunting community,
including the likes of Trout
Unlimited, Impact Outdoors, the
New Mexico Council of Outfitters
and Guides, New Mexico Wildlife
Federation.
Ducks Unlimited, Theodore
Roosevelt Conservation
Partnership and Backcountry
Hunters and anglers.
Collectively, our organizations
represent thousands of hunting
and angling licensed buyers and
we're supportive of the modest
increases proposed in this bill
to the license fees. Uh, the
estimated 9 to 10 million
revenue that this will generate
can be used by the department to
restore more habitats, uh, hire
more conservation officers,
conserve wetlands and big game
corridors and invest in the
science.
data that we need to guide
wildlife management into the
21st century.
Um, I would just close by saying
that as a lifelong angler here
in New Mexico, I want to have my
grandchildren and their children
be able to fish for the Rio
Grande cutthroat trout and the
native hea trout as well. So
please support this bill. Thank
you.
Thank you. We have about a
minute and a half for anybody
online.
Who would like to speak in
support.
Yes, most of them are nays. Oh,
here's a chance.
Whitford?
And Barbara Calif.
Please go ahead.
My name is Chanceedford.
I'm president of the Mexico
Trappers Association, Madam
Chair, senators.
We oppose Senate Bill 5.
We're, I'm sorry, we're on
support. I, I'm sorry, I had you
on that. You can come back in a
minute.
Uh, is Barbara
Caliph
Uh, a supporter.
Hello.
Yes, are you on for support?
Yes, I am. OK, go ahead.
Madam Chair and committee
members, I'm Barbara Cali,
registered lobbyist for the
League of Women Voters of New
Mexico. We support SB 5 based on
our position on wildlife that
says the league supports the
conservation and protection of
wildlife and their habitats for
the contribution they make
toward the health and
sustainability of the
environment. We urge you to
support to vote yes on this
bill. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
OK, with all the opponents in
the room, please line up to
speak, and then we will start
with chance.
Whitford Online.
These are opponents now.
Pants, go ahead.
Uh, uh, Madam Chair, senators,
my name is John Studford,
president of the Mexico Trappers
Association. We oppose Senate
Bill 5.
On the commission, the potential
for leaving seats open to people
with no vested interests is
still too high.
Outdoorsmen and landowners pay
for conservation through Pittman
Robertson Act.
uh
habitat stamps and grazing fees.
License fee increases.
Which is needed to help the
department we're on board with
the increases.
We are not in agreement with the
uh
Inconsistencies across the
board.
Even with the amendments, the,
the increases seem to be
prejudicial towards trappers and
predator hunters, it is still
200 to 250% increase across
those lines.
Bill this uh room for annual
increases, which would increase
these even more year to year.
The bill hurts the department's
ability to recruit new hunters
and outdoorsmen and women, which
has been a long standing
Project for the game department.
OK, thank you. We're gonna move
on.
We have a long list here on on
Zoom and also in the room.
Howard Hutchinson next.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Howard Hutchinson,
representing the coalition of
Arizona and New Mexico counties.
I was a member of the
negotiation team for the passage
of the wildlife Conservation Act
in 1995.
Most present today were not
legislators or participants.
I appreciated uh the sponsors.
Uh, differentiating between the
funding that goes into the game
and fish management versus the
conservation efforts. That was a
key element in the development
of the wildlife conservation.
Act in the beginning.
However
The management of species for
human consumption and
preservation of species of
concern have different
methodologies.
This is why we created the
distinction in the creation of
the wildlife conservation Act.
This bill combines the two
disciplines.
Our prayer this will blur
effective management for both
harvesting and preservation.
We also disagree with the
representation that is being
presented in this bill, we feel
that as previously stated that
it should more effectively
represent the hunters and
anglers and landowners.
Please suppose Senate Bill 5 as
amended. Thank you very much,
Madam Chair. Thank you very
much. Patience O'Dowd and then
Cheryl Gibson.
Good morning and thank you,
Madam Chair, Senator Stefaniks.
I impatience of doubt, president
of the Wild Horse Observers
Association, an environmental
conservation nonprofit since
2004. We represent 70% of New
Mexicans.
Yes, uh, SB 5, which is good, is
to help all of our wildlife
through climate change and for
all our children's future, he.
Of the state are stakeholders,
as in fact, they always have
been for wildlife across our
state lands.
The quote unquote stakeholder
definition for this bill has
been knowingly narrow. As animal
protection of New Mexico does
not speak for horses as
wildlife.
They do speak for horses
legislatively as livestock in
your committees for years, as is
well understood.
Just as deer and now can be
either wildlife or livestock.
So our our purchase. I believe
the majority of legislators in
this conservation committee,
know this very well, as does the
uh ellate court.
Of New Mexico. In the last
hearing on this bill in Senate
rules.
The voice of this chair, this
Senator Lizonics is now muted to
the audience.
Uh, that is not a first and why
is that? She, uh, being a
Lincoln County.
Uh, representative.
Where wild for that well
released.
And wild for supporters are very
numerous in that district.
An important stakeholder
representing 70% of New Mexico's
without a conflict of interest,
who does not included.
There are, there are necessary
amendments that we can that we
could help with so that we could
support this bill.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
So we're gonna hear one more
person online and then go to the
people in the room, Cheryl
Gibson.
Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Oh,
excellent. Thank you so much um
for this opportunity to speak,
um, opportunity to speak
chairwoman and committee
members, um.
Our wild horses are a unique
tourist attraction in New
Mexico, and a natural resource.
The stated objective of making
these changes to the game
commission.
is to make New Mexico an outdoor
adventure state.
Whoa, Patience O'Dowd.
Have asked many times to be
included in discussions
regarding wildlife in New
Mexico.
There is the the they were
noticeably absent from being
consulted during the
construction of this of this
proposed legislation. Year after
year, woe requests to be
consulted regarding our wild
horses and never does anyone
ever contact them.
So I find that odd.
Um
I note that that the sponsors
and all the discussion revolves
around hunters and anglers and
Audubon, but we have to realize
that there is more wildlife in
this state than just the animals
that we used to hunt for
trophies or meat or whether, you
know, just watching birds. Some
people would like to watch the
horses. Um, New Mexico statues
annotated in MSA 17185, I think
is what it is, provides that
there could be wildlife wild.
Of course, reserves in New
Mexico that we could do things
to enhance
The, the, the, the, the ability
for the public to observe these
magnificent creatures, and I
would, um, at this time, I
oppose Senate Bill 5 because
For the reason I stated at the
beginning that
No one consulted.
Wild wild horse advocates, and
I, I fail to understand very
much that's been made. We're
moving on to people here in the
room. Go ahead, sir.
Uh, microphone, please.
Madam,
uh, members of the committee. My
name is Brandon Wynn. I live in
Albuquerque and my children are
6th or 7th generation New
Mexicans and I'm a hunter.
I think it's my.
We're down to one minute,
but we're so,
so this bill
excuse me. We're down to one
minute. We're gonna expand it to
5 minutes to hear more people.
So please go ahead, but please
know there's several people
behind you.
Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Uh, so
this bill, there's much that I
love about this bill, the
nominating committee,
especially.
is a great idea to remove the
politics, but I'm here as a
hunter, a long-term hunter in
New Mexico and.
For about 50 years now, the New
Mexico system of allocating the
opportunity to hunt has been
greatly skewed for toward
wealthy non-resident hunters
through the privatization and
everything, and I don't see
anything in this bill that's
gonna help do that. Basically,
um, the blue collar hunter in
New Mexico is going to be, has
been
It's gonna be in the crossfire
between the environmental
conservation lobby and the
ranching lobby and the
privatization lobby. And so what
I would suggest in this bill to
build a bridge to close that,
um.
I just want to reiterate that
how far off New Mexico is. I'm
gonna go backwards. How far off
New Mexico is on the way we
allocate hunting licenses like
our next door neighbor, Arizona,
93% of all the tags in Arizona
is awarded to an Arizona
resident by public process
through a draw in New Mexico
because of privatization of our
tags to the landowners and also
to the outfitters by the
legislature is only 55%, so 93%
is more typical across the West.
New Mexico.
blue collar, middle-class
hunters only get 55% of the tags
in New Mexico and of all the
questions about tags and hunters
that came from the committee I
heard only one. What's this
gonna do to non-resident
hunters, and that's just
consider the concern that
resident hunters, the blue
collar middle class guy, not the
man and woman is not covered by
this bill at all. This is not
going to help us at all. So,
the, the New Mexico system's
tailor-made for a guy like me.
I'm pretty well healed. I've
spent about 2
$100,000 in the last decade
hunting sheep all across the
North America.
New mascular system is perfect
for me. If I don't draw, I'm
rich. I'm just gonna go down and
buy land or a permit and go
hunting.
That's the system that the
legislature and the game
commission have built and this
bill does not address that in
any way. If we're gonna reform
wildlife management in New
Mexico, that should have been
included in this thing. The way
you can fix that is if you
increase the game hunting
license fee from the 85 proposed
to 160 like I pay in Arizona for
this like license that a creep
funding to have less
non-resident tax. It's an easy
thing. It won't cost the
Mexicans a penny. That's the one
thing I really wish you would do
and it would solve most of my
concerns, give us a bridge to
let more middle class.
Hardworking New Mexicans hunt
our wildlife instead of rich
people, instead of putting
trophy heads on walls in
Houston, you ought to put meat
in our freezers for the resident
hunters. Thank you, and no one's
speaking for us. No one stands
for us. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Sanchez.
I'm a rancher from northern New
Mexico. Today, myself and others
represent uh Northern New Mexico
stockmans or New Mexico stockman
says the voice for 16,000
ranchers that have been in this
state in northern New Mexico
since 1597 in that industry, uh,
Madam Chair, uh.
Uh, representatives uh in the
sponsors, I emailed our concerns
and objections to you a couple
of days ago and the committee of
secretary. We stand opposed to
this bill. Uh, we are a directly
affected party, which you
haven't heard here today because
we're the landowners that feed
the wildlife. We haven't been
invited to the table, uh, the
sponsors are very well aware of
the impacts that wildlife
specifically elk have on ranches
in northern New Mex.
Mexico, the devastation, uh,
it's become a issue that our
county commission has asked for
emergency meetings with the
commission and the department
and they have basically refused
to meet and address the issues,
uh, Director Stallone came to a
meeting in Riariba in August,
and the only resolve or
recommendation he had was that
50 ranchers, uh, basically
Hispanic ranchers in northern
New Mexico were a threat to his
agency.
So we can't get resolved that
way with the department, uh, my
comments and objections in the
bill are well articulated to uh
line and language, and I, I
won't be redundant and go
through that. I hope you guys
look at my comments. We ask of
you today, uh, uh, Madam Chair
and representatives that this
bill be tabled because affected
parties that feed this elk were
not brought to the table, uh, to
participate in this. They are
very sponsors are very
aware of the damage and the
threat that elk poses to
northern New Mexico to our
citizens and our highways, uh,
they
redundantly and uh have refused
to allow us to come to the table
as landowners, uh, and under the
Constitution, Madam Chair and
Representatives, we have a right
to due process and because that
has been violated by the
sponsors, we ask that this
table, this billby table. Thank
you.
Thank you very much. Uh, next,
please.
Madam Chair, one senators on the
committee, appreciate the time.
My name is Kyle Jackson. I'm an
avid public land hunter and a
cattle rancher. I have a
master's degree in range science
and have a professional resume
that spans both
because you're gonna run out.
Yes, ma'am, and private sectors
of the past couple of decades.
This bill tries to address too
many topics as an omnibus, Game
commission reform, license fees
increase, and rebranding the
department are all complicated
issues that separately carry
enough gravity to be considered
a standalone bills on their
individual.
merit, said issues collectively
cannot be addressed to
satisfaction.
I submit to the proposed license
fee increase is wholly
problematic due to the arbitrary
and inconsistent.
In some cases punitive nature of
the increase of proposed. More
importantly, the license fee
increase proposed here would be
tied to the consumer price
index, which means the fees
could go up every year but would
never go down, even if the price
index does.
Um, Bill proposes name change to
modernize the department to what
end the department has already
has authority to protect species
of greatest conservation need
and non-game when needed.
A and fish has always been at
the forefront of the modern
wildlife management. It
pioneered uh transplanting
pronghorn antelope and its
efforts have resulted in the
restoration of dozens of native
species to New Mexico. It has
122 year rich history that
originated prior to statehood.
Portions of this bill are
encouraging, just not as a
whole. Thank you for your time.
I urge you to vote no.
Thank you. That's the end of
public comment. There was a uh
Equity in time between the
proponents and the opponents.
Now, Senator Charlie, you have a
amendment, if you would explain
your amendment and then we will
ask the sponsors if it's
friendly.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, sponsors. Um,
I have an amendment to the
makeup of the commission.
Um, I am asking for a
representative from a.
nation.
Tribe or pueblo to be added to
the makeup of the commission.
And I'm asking this, um, in
particular because
This legislation is important,
and we do need it.
Um, the proposed changes to the
commission have potential to
improve representation and
decisions about our public
lands.
And wildlife management.
However, true conservation,
let's start with recognizing and
prior the amendments so that
they can identify you can debate
it later, OK, got it. Thank you.
So.
It's adding a, a representative
from an Indian.
Nation tribe or Pueblo. Thank
you very much.
Are the sponsors, uh, is this a
friendly or unfriendly
amendment?
Ma'am chair, I, I'd like to be
able to discuss the amendment,
is that OK. So is there a motion
to adopt this amendment for
discussion.
There is a motion to adopt this
uh.
Amendment for discussion, is
there a second?
OK, thank you. So, um,
Sponsors, go ahead and uh you
you present first and then we'll
go to comments, questions from
the committee.
Thank you, ma'am. Ma'am Chair
Center, um, thank you for your
amendment. Thank you for your
interest. Um, I want, if I may
give you a little bit of
background on the bill.
And how we arrived at um where
we are and when we arrived at
where we are.
So first off I'd like to note
that.
The commission portion of this
bill has passed before.
Uh, and with strong bipartisan
support, um, and we're.
Staying pretty true to that
portion of the bill with the
exception of the nominating
committee that the seats uh have
not changed.
And I'm, I would like to honor
that, uh, that effort in the
past.
And I'm
Resisting adding another.
Um
identified position seed.
Um, we have a, a bipartisan
coalition,
Madam Chair Center, we, we have
uh uh.
You know, lots of input, sort of
a
A delicate balance at the
moment.
Uh, which I'm trying to
preserve.
And I will say
Uh, Center.
We have tribal input uh in this
process.
Like we've never had before, uh,
we have, uh, there's a tribal
member of the nominating
committee.
Um, there is the advisory
position from the Department of
Indian Affairs. Those are both
new, uh, in this bill.
Next, I'd like to note that the
tribes are
Frequent partners and
collaborators with the
department.
There are tribes, uh, they have
their own wildlife officers and
wildlife agencies.
Uh, and you know, of course
their own sovereign
jurisdiction.
Over wildlife
Um, and finally, I would just
note, as I've noted for other
people who
We're seeking the further
specify the at-large positions.
That all the positions are
really open to members of the
community.
Um, there was some discussion
about uh a land grant or
position.
You know, any of the large um
members could be tribal members.
Hunter could be tribal member of
the scient, I mean, scientists
could be tribal member.
Any of them and I think because
we have representation on the
nominating committee itself.
Um, I, I would be optimistic
that uh those applications would
be passed through to the
governor.
Uh, as possibilities, so because
of that I would, I would rather
not adopt your amendment at this
time.
OK, we're going to the audience
on the amendment.
Is there anyone in the audience
to support the amendment, please
raise your hand.
OK, there's a couple, uh, is
there anybody in the audience to
oppose seeing none.
OK, committee members on the
amendment.
Senator Charlie, would you like
to address it now?
Thank you. This is my, uh, madam
chair, this is my first rodeo as
they say, so I'm doing great.
Thank you. Um, I'll start again.
Um, but I want to address, um,
representative, um, your
comments.
It's not enough.
To not commit.
And make this legislation. I
appreciate that it that it
passed the last time, but we
have a very unique opportunity.
Right now, to strengthen this.
We've heard from the audience
about a lack of inclusion.
This is also a lack of
inclusion.
Um
We have to ensure that.
People just aren't on a
nominating committee, but
they're in a position.
to make decisions.
About
Um, the commission.
Um
I'll just, I'll I'll go a little
bit into this.
Um, my district is made up of.
A lot of public land.
Um, Mount Taylor is at the
center of that and, um, it's
sacred to many of the tribes in
New Mexico.
Our people have hunted.
Raised livestock and farmed its
drainages, and we still do to
this day.
These landscapes are not just
places of recreation.
Or or use for resource
extraction, they're living
cultural landscapes that are
woven into our identity,
history, and survival as
indigenous. My husband hunts elk
on that mountain.
His family Field is located at
the at the the mountain's base
and it's still irrigated by the
asseas.
That have sustained our
communities for centuries.
It is not unique tribal
communities across New Mexico
have maintained this deep
connection, despite
Centuries of displacement and
policies that have tried to
sever it.
Um, I, I really do support the
intent of this legislation.
But we can't talk about
conservation without
representation.
It's not enough to protect just
the land and just the wildlife.
We also have to center.
Indigenous knowledge.
Because we're the people who
will have stewarded this land
for generations.
We've been caretakers of the
animals.
Since the beginning of time.
The Conservation policies must
be designed with indigenous
leadership, knowledge and
sovereignty at the forefront.
Not as an afterthought.
Not as a hope that we'll get
there. They're a nominating
commission.
Um
So it means more than just
appointing a native native
person to that commission.
Represented representation for
the communities that I'm here to
fight for, it's fundamental and
anything less.
Continues the cycle of exclusion
that has defined.
Public lands management.
I do hope, um.
That we can accept this
amendment so that I can support
this critical legislation.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Other,
yes, Senator Townsend.
On the amendment.
Representative of
You've got a problem. I'm trying
to figure out how to help you
solve it. I mean,
Um
Senator Charlie is correct. He,
I mean,
The tribes have.
56.5 million acres of New
Mexico, 23 tribes, I mean, it's
not insignificant.
Um
You added to from the governor,
you could
Designate one of those or you're
gonna have to figure out how
you're going to get a balance
back because adding one makes 10
and 10's a problem. You gotta
either take voting privileges
away from one, or you gotta add
11.
To get it where you can manage
it, but uh
I was just thinking, you just
added 2, and I can't imagine the
governor being opposed to one of
those being
A tribal
Member which was suffice of
Senator Charlie's idea, so I
just throw that on the table.
Smoke.
Me me me for a clarifying
response, ma'am chair Senator
Townsend, so the two new
positions for the governor are
on the nominating committee, I
believe, uh, Senator Charlie is
asking for a position on the
game commission itself.
Just to follow up on that. I, I,
you're exactly right, um, and I,
I do think, um,
There
I have
Enjoyed hunting.
Tribal and non, and I mean.
The impact, for example, in the
Riodosa area on Mescaleros on
the neighboring, um,
population is significant.
And it's something that the game
and fish department has
Miserably failed in taking care
of.
And it has desperately
Our ranchers from up north there
were speaking.
I feel their pain. I mean,
We, we have allowed the game and
fish department to ruin a lot of
Ranch country and, and they have
just ignored the problem.
And so
I think it would finally, I
mean, we can't get the US Fish
and wildlife.
Come to the table to help.
The Mexico game and fish to
create a problem. They both hide
behind each other and they don't
both hardly ever come to the
meetings together. I fought it
for years.
But if we could get it a somehow
get a commitment from the
tribal.
group, the inner end of the
conversation and be part of it.
I think we're
I think it's a good thing, so
I'll stop right there.
Thank you, uh, senator. I have
Senator Cedillo Lopez, and then
uh Senator, did you want to
speak on the amendment?
Oh I have some, OK, Senator
Sidia Lopez. Thank you, Madam
Chair, um, representative
Center.
Um, I understand that you're
concerned about the amendment
because so much is at work has
gone into it. Um, I wanna ask
where was their tribal
representation, um, because I
admire, I admire the work that
you have done in getting folks
together in the task force. My
question is, was there a tribal
representation at every step of
the process.
Ma'am Jerison or steel up as the
uh
The group that worked on this
was convened by the governor's
office, um, I, and I don't know.
Who all was invited. I, I'm
sorry, I simply can't answer
that question.
Um
Madam Chair, it feels, um,
Senator Representative, it feels
like um.
To me that adding a
representative or identifying
one of the art at large, as I
understand the amendment, it's
identifying one of the at-large
members to be representation
from
From tribal governments or that,
that kind of representation, a
government to government kind of
thing, and that
In this environment with regard
to game and fish, wildlife makes
a lot of sense to me given how
much um land the tribe.
The various tribes and pueblos
in our state owned and their
interest, um, so I, I like the
amendment on the other hand, my
concern is I don't want to
destroy the coalition that you
have done, but I realized now
it's a task force, not everybody
maybe was invited to the table,
um, so I, I don't know why I.
and a little bit um concerned.
About
About whether this task force
was as open as perhaps it should
have been, uh, Madam Chair.
And, and I invite Madam Chair a
response from Representative
Senator.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh, Senator
Lous,
um.
I don't think it was a task
force per se. I think the
governor's office convened, um.
Uh, a broad range of interests,
um, I, I would know I was not.
Initially on the list, um, and
sort of invited myself to
subsequent meetings, um, we were
in the cabinet room upstairs and
it was packed.
So if seat at the table and and
seats along the wall, uh, there
were many people there. I simply
do not know, um, whether
Tribes were invited.
Um, I, I.
You know, understand and respect
the, the tribal holdings which
are sovereign areas.
Uh, so the game department does
not have authority over those
areas.
Uh, and the, the tribes manage
those themselves themselves.
I, I guess my point, Madam
Chair, was they are sovereign
areas and it would be good
because it it's the way our our
state is is OK, game and fish,
and then it ends.
And then it's the it's the
tribe, and it would be good to
at least get that voice at the
table, um, with regard to,
because what, what happens on
Game of Fish.
Of course, affects, affects
tribal lands just because the
elk and and the deer and the
birds aren't going to stop at
that border.
Um
So, I mean, I guess my if if
this if this
If this amendment passes, um, in
this committee, how much
heartburn would that give you?
Um
Me and Lopez. My understanding
is there is a substantial agency
to agency collaboration between
the department and the tribal
departments, um, you know, if,
if there is bipartisan support.
Uh, for this amendment, you
know, we would accept it and
move on.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Any further
discussion on the amendment.
So, is there a motion to move
the amendment. Is there a
motion? I motion.
Is there a second? OK, so could
the secretary please call.
The role on the.
Second Amendment from this
committee, but the 3rd Amendment
on the bill if it.
Senator Cervantes excused
Senator Charlie, yes, so
Charlie, yes, send herself.
On the amendment, Senator.
There's, yes, Senator Hamblin.
Senator Hamblin, yes, Senator
Pope.
Yes. Pope, yeah, Senator Scott.
Senator Scott, no, Senator
Townsend.
Sarah Townsend, yes, Senator
Stee Lopez, yes, Senator Di
Lopez, yes, Senator Stefaniks.
Yes, Senator Scott to explain
his vote.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Yes
Consternation was over.
An even number.
Is that
Problematic.
I believe it is
Mm
Thank you.
Then.
Well, work,
it's really just a comment.
Thank you.
OK, on a clarify that? Um, I'm
sorry, this was he asked to
explain his vote. That was it.
Uh, on a vote of 7 yeses, 1 no,
one excused of the amendment
does pass.
And we'll talk later about
procedure for amendments uh from
the committee.
So a committee members, we are
back on the Senate bill as 3
times amended. I have Senator
Iel first.
But
Yeah, thank you very much.
Uh senator and representative, I
do have quite a few questions
here.
Uh, can y'all tell me how much
money was brought into the state
to the game of fish.
Apartment 24.
Uh, and that
the state under what means?
Mante Center, I do not have
their budget figures in front of
me.
OK, madam, sure, I can answer
that question.
It's a formula that's based on
land area and paid honey
leases.
Uh, came from ammunition and
hunting firearms and archery
equipment and 10 of it, 10% of
the came from taxes on handgun,
and the amount of money that
came into New Mexico was
$22,714,000 so that is a sizable
amount.
Madam chair.
Uh, so whenever I hear that this
department was underfunded. I, I
do have a problem with that
because.
That, uh, that's a chunk of
money coming in Door state.
I noticed on, I'm going back to,
uh, yes, I do, on page 3.
I have noticed that you have
stricken all the language.
Let's see where we at. Staring
at the bottom of the page 3 all
the way through like at page 4,
and then it commences again on
page 5.
You are stating there, uh, Madam
Chair and Representative and
senator that there will be 3
at-large positions.
Consisting of position 12, and
3. Can you give me more for
clarification on that?
I'm not quite following what
you're trying to say right
there, uh, Madam Chair, senator,
the, the position numbers relate
to the stagger.
Uh, so these are staggered
6-year terms, the initial
appointments, uh, reflect, um,
Uh, are specified in the bill on
page 24.
So the initial appointments are
made for a period of 13, or 5
years in order to initially
create the stagger.
That's why all the positions are
numbered.
OK, and then would that be,
would that hold true for uh.
The 4 commissioners from 456 to
7. Is that correct? It's gonna
follow right on through.
Ma'am chair and correct.
OK, and then I have a problem
with the.
position 456, and 7.
And Madam chair, whenever I'm
looking at, let me make sure I
marked as well.
Uh, starting online 22 of page
5.
You're gonna have one farmer or
rancher.
And you know what, I am really
pissed off whenever our farmers
and ranchers are the ones out
there with their boots on the
ground taking care of the
state's wildlife.
In a drought we are feeding them
as well.
in a blizzard condition whenever
we put feet up,
we're the ones that's out there
with boots on the ground.
I have
Game and fish department out
there helping us. Why is it
narrowed down to one position.
Because the the affected areas
throughout our state is just
not.
Go to be served by one farmer
rancher being on that
commission.
Things up north are a whole lot
different than they are down
south, same with the east and
west and Madam chair.
Representative and senator, I
don't think y'all can disagree
with what I have just.
Deer are going to move further
up the hill whenever there's.
Fire, guess where they're gonna
move. They're gonna move further
down.
devastation
up in the hermit's peak Caf
Canyon
wildlife has just
Scattered tremendous tremendous
miles.
And I, I've always been bothered
with just one representation.
From the agricultural community
whenever we.
And I am one, folks, I are one,
OK, I'm out there every day.
Taking care of the crops.
Or my livestock and the wildlife
that we do help sustain.
Folks, that is our backyard, but
yet we don't charge a fee for
the game.
On our land
And you two are sitting back
there kind of looking at me like
oh my gosh, she's opened up a
can of worms here, and yes,
ma'am, that's exactly what I
intended to do, so I would like
an explanation on that, please.
Madam Chair, center, it's at
least one.
All of the other positions could
certainly be held by farmers and
ranchers, and this is consistent
with existing law.
So existing law, there are two
positions called out in existing
law. One is ag, one is um
wildlife.
And we carry that forward so I
would just emphasize we're not
saying one.
We're saying at least one and
Madam, cheer, that's my problem.
Senator and representative.
Why aren't we changing that up
to get the input from the
affected areas that are gonna.
harmed
by what we're doing here.
By turning this into a more
green environment.
For the protection of our
wildlife.
Mr. Chair, Madam Chairman.
You have a hunter on there, you
have conservationists on there,
you have a scientist on there.
And you've got one farmer and
rancher on there that is trying
to make a living.
Madam Chair, whenever we're
talking about along those same
lines on page 8 of your bill.
Whenever you are talking about
uh.
Yeah, starting on line 24.
Continuing on up on the page
you're talking about 4 members
appointed as follows one by the
Speaker of the House of
Representative.
One minority floor leader of the
House of Representatives won by
the president pro tempore of the
Senate and won by the minority
and then you've got 2.
From the chair of the University
of New Mexico biology department
and one from the Mexico State
University Department of Game,
Fish and Conservation Ecology,
and then another one appointed
by the governor so that
Your nominations back over here.
That one position that's gonna
be held by a farm or rancher
could stay just exactly like
that is, am I correct?
Mans
ma'am Chair, Senator, so those
positions being appointed by
Legislative officials, that's to
the nominating committee, not to
the commission, uh, we did add
two additional appointments for
the governor. So we're up to 97.
Um
You know, again, on the
commission there there will be.
least
One Aber I, I wouldn't be
surprised if there were more.
Madam chair,
representative on page 11 of
your bill starting online.
Uh, number 8 line 8.
I don't think we're
I don't think we're doing
justice.
To those communities out there
that are gonna be
underrepresentative but not
here. I will leave that one
alone, madam chair.
One of the thing on here on pay.
Uh, line 4. Can you explain to
me what you mean by bartered,
Madam Chair.
Senator
Um
Me chair center barters trading.
I'm sorry.
Right
here, Madam Chair, I need more
clarification than just one
word.
But I want to know what the
intent of Barter is in this
particular section.
Um,
Ma'am chair center, perhaps a
trapper has a number of pelts.
Perhaps a trapper has a dipper
of pelts.
And trades that for grain or for
services or.
It's OK.
All right.
Madam Chair, senator and
representative still on that
same page starting line 50.
Says consider a species
population size and trends
migration patterns.
Madam Chair.
Senator and representative have
any migration patterns of the
states wildlife.
Or
Water fell
been changed.
Due to
Anything that might have been
coming of.
created by men.
Madam Chair, uh, center.
Uh, without speculating on that,
uh, I would just say that
migration patterns are
One of the scientific factors
that
Uh, the department will take
into consideration.
Uh, my suspicion is that they
already do.
OK, madam chair and.
Senator and representative, the
races and I'm bringing that up.
We have the wind turbines that
have changed the migration.
Pattern of lots of.
Birds.
And Madam chair, we also have.
An energy corridor that's gonna
be built that will change the
migration pattern of not only
our birds, but of our
Mule deer probably or elk or
pronghorn.
Um
And that is the national.
National interest electric
transmission corridor, and that
will run the entire length.
Of the eastern side of our
state, that corridor is expected
to be between 5 and 15 miles
wide, and that will change the
migratory pattern.
Of our wildlife of the state. I
just wanted to point that out,
Madam Chair.
And uh I know you guys are gonna
be relieved because that is the
end of my questions. Thank you
very much for answering them.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. I have next Senator
Si Lopez and then Senator
Townsend.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um, and
thank you for bringing this bill
forward. I know that it has been
ever since I've been here, where
the entire 6 years of this has
been something that um
Has been worked on with game and
fish, and the other thing, madam
chair, is that I'm really
intrigued about the relationship
between the state and the
federal government when we're
talking about endangered species
and um so what is the difference
between the federal endangered
Species Act and with the game
and the game and fish.
Um, organization does.
Uh, ma'am chair center, I might
let my escorts, uh, addresses as
well, but I, I would say.
Um, you know, first and
foremost, a lot of what the
department does.
His managed species.
Uh, to keep them off the federal
endangered and threatenedless,
um, so the endangered Species
Act.
I um
Uh
Thorough draconian.
Um, you know, and we want to
avoid having species in New
Mexico listed if we can.
And this is our agency who works
on those issues. Once a species
is listed, the US Department of
Game and Fish gets involved, um,
and.
You know, I, I certainly believe
the agencies collaborate, uh,
but it is, um, you know, it's
different jurisdictions and
different authorities, so, uh.
You'd like to respond.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator Sio Lopez, yeah, so just
to add a little bit to what
Chairman McQueen said that the
federal government only has
authority over wildlife when
it's been listed on the federal
endangered species list. And if
it hasn't, then management of
that species stays with the
states and tribes, and so we
always talk about the federal
endangered species list is sort
of like the emergency room for
species. It's when things are so
bad that the federal government
needs to step in and what our
state came and fished.
department can do is manage
those species so that those
populations are healthy here so
that they don't get to that
point and you want that because
the federal endangered species
list comes with many, many
restrictions that the state does
not put on its species and so
the state, for example, does not
list critical habitat, the way
the feds do, and that creates a
lot of impediments for things
like industry once it gets to
that point. So if you can manage
species here before they get to
that point, the restrictions on
things like development are much
lower, um, and you also have
healthier populations.
Thank you, Madam Chair, that
really makes the, the game and
fish department really
important.
Um, and making sure that we
don't, uh, cause I know how
heavy handed the federal
government can be, um, and I
think that that's really
important that we don't really
want the federal government to
come in and start putting those
kinds of restrictions, um, on
the state, so I, I really, um,
admire this bill for that
purpose because you really
brought a lot of people
together, you're making sure, um
That the management isn't just,
you know, is, is expanded,
you're making the title of the
department reflect that, um.
Does the department create a
list of endangered species that
are on the
The federal and um endangered
Species Act.
I,
it does not. That's a federal
list.
fish department do about
endangered species, which when
you were talking about managing
endangered species, you know,
we, we don't get on their act.
What kinds of powers do they
have now before the past.
Um, Madam Chair and Senator
Sidil Lopez, so the state does
not have an endangered Species
Act the same way that the
federal government does, but it
does monitor species in decline,
um, and then they can direct
federal funds towards the
species that they've listed in
decline, um, again, they can't
put restrictions on what happens
with those species in the same
way that the feds can, but they
do monitor species in decline
that are not listed yet and when
they can, they work to improve
those species.
This is part of the reason we
need this bill is that they
don't have enough resources and
tools to manage the species and
decline that are, are declining
here, but, um, they also do
partner with the federal
government on endangered species
work for the federally listed
species. Well, it sounded like
you presaged my my last
question, which is, uh, Madam
Chair, uh, that the
So my last question was presage,
which is what does this bill to
do to make sure that we can uh
manage those species before they
get into with this bill, like,
what does this bill add?
Center, um, the department
already manages non-game
species. What this bill does is
it gives them.
As I said at the outset, the
authority and the discretion.
To manage any species. So they
have the authority to um
Uh, if there's a, a species in
decline to step in and work with
uh landowners work with
agencies, uh, and they also have
the authority not to, uh, and we
heard in the public comments
there were some species that the
department does not manage.
Uh, and they're not part of this
bill.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um.
I really think this bill is is
necessary, um, especially for
those reasons. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you. Next, I have Senator
Townsend.
Anyone else who wants to be on
the list?
OK, uh, Senator Pope after
Senator Townsend. Go ahead.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um.
representative.
Deja vu, here we are again.
Um
A couple of things I've.
Mr. B. Hill, uh, a friend of
mine, um, commented for the
conservation districts.
I have had a couple of
conservation.
Districts reach out to me to
Make sure that the committee
knows that
That was not it. He wasn't
speaking for all the districts
that it was not unanimous. Is
that correct?
OK, I just want to make sure.
That was out there.
Um
Representative, um,
Do you foresee
The possibility
With this new regime that there
could be areas that are
currently
Um
Used by hunters and and anglers
that might be restricted from
hunting and fishing maybe for
bird watching.
I mean, is that a possibility or
Do you see that happening in
order to pacify all of the
little interest groups that you
have.
Uh, ma'am chair Senator, I don't
think there's anything in this
bill to pacify interest groups,
um, I, you know, there are areas
managed by the department
already. They're closed on um a
seasonal basis, uh, there are
areas are closed, for example,
for elk cal calving.
You know, so the, the
department does manage it,
manage some land.
Uh, it's, I, you know, if you
look at the surface management
of New Mexico, it's really not
very much.
Well, there's nothing that would
restrict that from happening.
Correct. Madam Chair, Senator,
the department doesn't have
authority over most land is my
point. They don't have authority
to restrict uh say trust land or
federal land.
Uh, and they don't, uh, unlike
the US Fish and Wildlife
Service, they don't designate
critical habitat, which is often
private land.
So they simply have authority
over the animals, not the.
There's nothing also, madam
chair and Representative respect
to.
Uh, Senator Sadia Lopez's
question on endangered species.
There's nothing that would
prevent
Uh, this.
permission from
Picking out a species.
That wasn't on the endangered
species list, and, and imposing.
Uh, restrictions or protections.
Is that
um.
Uh, Senator, the
They would have the authority to
manage species.
You know, the, the endangered
species Act is federal, the
listed species, both endangered
and threatened, are federal.
They don't have control over
that. They could not designate a
species as endangered.
Um, but they could manage
species.
And, and that's my, that's my
point that I think uh many
landowners.
have expressed concern.
Is that
Um
They're losing input and control
and
And, and maybe some rights.
In, in this process.
Oh, what I heard from
Um
The northern New Mexico
ranchers. It's really troubling.
And I don't know how people
That on that much property.
A lot of it prime hunting area.
Have been excluded.
Or ignored from the process.
That's, that's really
problematic.
Um
Were you aware that they were
upset and had you tried to meet
with them and make sure that
they got to the table.
Madam Cha again that
the.
Larger group that's been working
on this, I, I think it's been
well represented. Uh, it was not
convened by me, it was convened
by the governor's office.
Um, and we certainly had many
interests.
At the table, um, I, I can't.
I, I simply don't know who all
was involved uh or who all was
invited. Let me put it that way.
I'll tell you that, uh, I'm
Chair representatives, I'm
looking at you and them over
your head, they're all shaking
their head this way, uh,
they're, they're not in
agreement with that, and I think
that's a problem.
Um
That was the
A statement made by someone,
Madam Chair, about.
Um, they were happy with this
new selection because there was
the familiarity of
Hunting and fishing or angling.
How do we gauge familiarity with
uh with the commission.
Um
Me chair Center on page 5 line
65 and 6 of the bill, all of
whom shall possess knowledge of
wildlife hunting and fishing in
the New Mexico residents.
So one of the selection criteria
that the nominating committee is
tasked.
Uh, with evaluating is that
knowledge.
Would you do me a favor and
repeat that I'm trying to read
two notes and listen, and I'm
not doing very well at either
one of them.
Um, on page 5, Madam Chair
Center, um, language in the bill
states all and this is referring
to the um
Um, the nominees for the
commission, all of whom shall
possess knowledge of wildlife,
hunting and fishing.
And be New Mexico residents.
So those are all requirements uh
for
Getting through the nominating
process and being put on the the
list that the governor would
then select from.
Do we, uh, do we possess
knowledge just because we bought
a license, or is there a
demonstration of knowledge or, I
mean,
Do you, I mean, I know people
with
Degrees that uh need help
getting home, so I'm trying to
figure out how we do that.
Uh, ma'am chair center, you
know, I, I think you could
demonstrate knowledge in
different ways. I, I think
someone who's grown up hunting
and fishing in New Mexico.
Would have that knowledge, uh, I
think, you know, I think part of
your application.
You know, would be probably a
resume of sorts, and here's my
experience and here's why I
should be picked and put on the
list that the governor would
then select them.
There's um
Madam Chair
I think the, the issue
And I, I really do appreciate
what
And I've told you that. I
appreciate the work that you're
trying to do.
To revamp the game and fish.
Lord knows I, I'm, I'm in
agreement there. The process,
you know, the devil's in the
details, and you're trying to
figure out how to do it.
Um
There's been quite a bit of
comments and talk about that we
Taken the
Politics out of or tried to, and
I appreciate what you've done
by, you know, the, the
terms overlapping.
Um, I think that's really
important. But when you look at,
I think it's section.
I don't forget what section it
is now, but
It cause, causes the mass exodus
of the existing.
People
Why didn't we stagger that so we
protected some.
some uh transition.
Oh
Did, was that considered a
representative, Madam Chair.
Ma'am Chair Center, um.
If this bill doesn't pass.
Uh, we probably get a new
commission on January 1st, 2027.
And that's been the pattern of
past governors.
Um
And
You know, we.
We thought it was fair to have
this take effect on that date.
Um, so it wouldn't be.
Um, uh.
You know, the nominating.
Committee could come into
existence they could evaluate
the members, they could nominate
people for these numbered
positions and we wouldn't have
an issue of people currently on
the commission.
Staying on in an.
Uh, clear capacity.
So all the people who are
currently on the commission.
would be eligible to be
reappointed, but they would have
to go through the nominating
committee process first.
And one of the, one of the
issues, one of the provisions in
this bill is that when the
governor makes appointments, the
governor needs to specify.
Which seat
An individual is taking.
Because we have had this, this
ag seat in the past and the
conservation team in the past.
And the times, the public isn't
sure like who is supposed to be
filling that seat because it
wasn't specified.
So one of the provisions of this
bill is.
When the appointments are made
after they're vetted by the
nominating committee, they're
made with specificity as to
which seat is being filled.
There
Man chair and a representative.
My memory's right.
Um
There's an existing deal between
the state land office and the
Game and Fish Department, where
they
Have some Eastman or rights or
isn't that correct?
Um, ma'am Cha Center, yeah, I
believe that is correct to allow
hunting on state trust lands.
And with this in any way,
Uh, modify that or cause it to
be modified in any way.
Mentor, uh, senator, not, not to
my knowledge.
Well, I appreciate the work
you've done. I'm, I am concerned
that we have so many.
People that are so
Responsible and accountable.
Or, you know, maintaining the
land that
That, uh, this.
Game
Resides on.
It, it really does bother me
that we got a lot of people that
So many people
that will neglected and weren't
invited to the table and
They continued to say they
weren't invited to the table.
So,
I um
I think you, I think the bill
does help address some of the
politics.
Granted, that was, that's good
work, I think to.
The fees
I would, uh
I would personally like changing
the language on the CPI. I used
to use that in
Pipeline negotiations, you know,
they want somebody who wanna.
CPI adjustment and I would put,
yeah, we'll put it in there and
it can move upward only and.
But it never moved down, I think
uh the people of New Mexico
deserve it going down as well as
they do going up.
And um if you're really going to
uh
Adjust it for CPI to the people
of New Mexico. Maybe you don't
want to do it for out of state
guys, but
Uh, definitely for the.
For the guide that's buying the
License of to go hunting in New
Mexico, you ought to have that.
You ought to have that benefit.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
Thank you and for the audience,
uh, I should have been.
Mention this earlier, this is
our last bill for today.
Senator Pope withdrew. Is there,
are there any other questions,
comments?
OK, Senator Hamlin.
Madam Chair, I move a due pass
on Senate Bill 53 times amended.
I.
There is a motion.
And a second
Or I do pass on Senate Bill 5 is
