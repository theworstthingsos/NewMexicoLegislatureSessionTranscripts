Can enforce the and the time
limit so I just wanted to let
everybody know and I know we're
missing some members that and
that is why I'm not interrupting
people you should stay on point
and on the bill versus larger
philosophical issues.
And I appreciate that
everybody's commitment to this
committee.
So good morning to the public
and good morning to the Sanchez
we are going to start with
Senate bill thirty two wildlife
conservation of public safety
act sponsored by senator Bobby
Gonzalez and Senator Brenda
McKenna.
And Senator McKenna has eight
nother Committee so she would
like to read a statement and
then Lee are committee so
Senator McKenna please.
Thank you madam chair good
morning to you and good morning
to members of the committee I am
honored to co sponsor SB thirty
two with Senator Gonzalez.
You see have been familiar with
this legislation because hi.
Advocated for it as a citizen
lobbyist for years.
it's a hard experience for a
family to.
See their pet away cold trap
snare or victim of and the M.
forty four which is sodium
cyanide capsule that is
propelled into the mouth.
And it as you can imagine it's a
it's a terrifying and barbaric
way to to die.
You will hear testimony from a
fellow advocates of mind about
their harrowing experiences both
are working and also on walks
with their their jobs.
you see.
Traps are very difficult to
disarm I just tried to disarm
the one that I have a ticket for
Tabling purposes over the years
and I was able to get it for
sixteen dollars at a national
warehouse.
I'm so many humans can't disarm
them with your own hands we have
to use our feet we have to be
calm cool and collected all
while trying to free our animals
and they're going through high
distress and pain.
Something else I want to mention
to the committee we have had at
least forty six Mexican gray
wolves trapped in the last two
decades.
And the current practice here of
trapping snaring and the use of
M. forty fours on New Mexico
public lands is absolutely
undermining
What the ESA is trying to do and
that is to make them a a speci
that we can help recover.
so with that madam chair I know
you have many folks to hear from
plus the subject matter experts
I'm gonna leave you all but I
really appreciate you giving me
a couple minutes to speak thank
you.
Thank you Senator McKenna so
Senator Gonzales as the other
sponsor let's go to you for your
presentation let's hear your
presentation before we deal with
your amendment please.
They are very well on thank you
madam chair and members of the
committee hello.
I have been working with this
legislation that started in two
thousand thirteen.
And so I have been no directly
or indirectly involved with the
legislation you know to to this
state.
And
madam chair members so.
You know it's come to our you
know we have our neighboring
states that have all.
A law enacted and the New Mexico
does not.
And the other part is that
we are working along with
tourism and expanding tourism
specially the outdoor
recreation.
And we see this also is so big
safety issue but Senator Senate
bill thirty two would enact the
wildlife conservation public
safety act which would make it
unlawful to use a trap snare
while like voices on public land
not private only public and
establish a variety of
exceptions with all specific
requirements more bill would
provide a misdemeanor penalties
for violation of the wild life
conservation and public safety
act and madam chair and members
so I know about the the time
frame that we're in and with
that I would like to be able to
my expert witness Jessica
Johnson and she will tell us
exactly what the bill to us.
Mr of our Senator Gonzales
we usually of.
The amendment on for
consideration before the the.
A big discussion would you still
like Jessica to go ahead.
yes give me a little bit of time
to go through my and then the
light at it right here and now.
Yes let's do that and then I'll
come back to the amendment okay
thank you so go ahead Jessica.
We have Jessica Johnston on.
She is the expert witness.
Madam chair I spoke to her just
a few minutes ago she was
getting ons on west maybe might
bust last coach she's in the
room okay okay Jessica go ahead
here been recognized by Senator
Gonzales.
Good morning madam chair and
committee members
my name is Jessica Johnson I am
the chief government affairs
officer for animal protection
voters I thank you so much for
the opportunity to provide a
statement today
first at I would just like to
walk through
the provisions of the bill and
because it is a bill that has
been carefully tailored and and
new wants to meet the needs of
New Mexico
and at and how does the law
applies is that important so.
As as Senator Gonzales stated.
The bill are set out a
prohibition on all traps and
snares and wildlife poisons.
I and this applies only to
public land and and public land
is defined in the bill
and it explicitly excludes
Indian nation tribe or pueblo
lands as well as the inside of
any structures that may be built
on public land.
There are a number of exceptions
that are written into the bill
where these prohibitions do not
apply of the first exception it
is as simply a clarifying
exception to say that all other
types of hunting fishing
archery falconry equipment any
other implements in hand as
allowed by law
are are not impacted by this
bill.
At further there is an exception
for the taking of birds fish or
rodents not classified as for
bears where the at the
prohibitions to not do not
apply.
There's also an exception for
the protection of human health
and safety by any government
entity.
there is an exception for
ecosystem management that is a
defined term in the bill by the
department of game and fish US
fish and Wildlife Service for a
Conservancy district in the
state.
There is also an exception for
any bona fide scientific
research that is also a defined
term in the bill.
There is an exception for the
department of game and fish to
use non with the full versions
of traps and snares so that
would include leg hold traps
rather than the body gripping
traps it would include foot
snares but not as strangulating
next mayors and the department
could use these at when they are
acting on new steps for
depredation complaints.
And and at their is at.
There some some language in the
bill that talks about what that
would look like.
I further there's also an
exception for cage traps in the
bill use under two circumstances
one to recover lost or feral
domestic animals or to provide
domestic or feral animals
Veterinary medicine or other
animal husbandry and and at K.
straps can also be used by
anyone to protect property crops
or livestock that is not we
placed on public lands.
Finally there is an exception
for the use of prohibited
devices by an enrolled member of
a federally recognized Indian
nation tribe or pueblo when that
trapping is taking place due to
religious or ceremonial
purposes.
As a Senator Gonzales stated
the bill establishes misdemeanor
penalties for violations of the
law and the enactment date is
slightly delayed the bill would
take effect in April first of
twenty twenty two.
so that is the summary of the
bill you know in the interest of
time I won't go into all of the
arguments to you know support
the bill I think that has been
well covered by our sponsors and
I'm sure you'll you'll hear
plenty from at testify or is but
I stand ready to answer any
questions that anyone has about
the issue or the bill itself
thank you.
Thank you so now we will go to
the amendment Senator Gonzales.
All Madam chair on the for some
reason I'm not a being able to
pull it out maybe if you want to
read it and then out.
I'm fine with reading it is one
line committee members on page
three.

So is there a motion to accept
the amendment.
Aye so move.
Is there a second hi.
Okay thank you now Senator
Gonzales would you explain the
amendment why you building in
that need that extra language
Madam chair of the bill was
drafted this was omitted and now
we caught it afterwards and.
So then we brought it to the
attention of fall.
To the attention of Legislative
Council.
So while.
You know that's why we had to
come with the amendment
afterwards.
Thank you so for members of the
public and the committee the one
line amendment for the phrase is
on the screen at this time and
I'll repeat it for those people
who cannot see it.
On page three line twenty after
the word by.
Answered the United States fish
and Wildlife Service.
Is there anybody in the
audience.
That wishes to comment just on
the amendment.
Not on the bill just on the
amendment.
Trevor is there anybody raising
their hands.
Okay committee members questions
and discussion on the amendment
only.
Any hands.
Senator Schmedes has his
handout.
Thank you madam chair I just
have a one brief question
Senator
I'm assuming there are lands
that are
ready to the fish and Wildlife.
Service that were excluded from
this bill so are we.
You just described real quick
what where is the where is there
is such a jurisdiction in New
Mexico what areas specifically
are we going to now be including
by this amendment.
thank you very much so madam
chair and senator and meal to
our expert witness to respond to
that Jessica.
At thank you senator and madam
chair Senators committees so
this would in effect include
National Wildlife Refuge as.
Okay thank you thank you madam
chair.
Thank you any other questions or
discussion from committee
members.
Okay Veronica we need a roll
call vote on the amendment
please.
Senator surrounded.
Yes.
Senator Gallegos.
Senator Hamblen yes.
There's.
Senator Pirtle gas.
Senator so.
He's not
Yes.
Senator Sedillo Lopez yes.
Chair.
Yes so your bill has been
amended Senator Gonzales and now
we are going to go to public
comment the opposition and the
supporters.
Not just so you know I have
Approximately seventeen
opponents and seventeen
supporters and then I had.
Comments that were submitted.
And let me get to that.
The public comments had
Many people against.
close to sixty.
And.
Another.
Five people for it besides the
speakers.
So at this point we're going to
go to the opposition.
And I'm going to only call ten
people.
On the opposition and they.
The next in the current place
right I can't turn off device
please I'm sorry.
If you're not being recognized
please keep your Mike off.
So the ten people I'm gonna
recognize ten opponents if you
would keep it to one minute so
that everyone can speak and then
we'll go to ten proponents for a
minute each and then we will go
to questions and discussion from
committee members.
Mr Romero you're number one.
Thank you madam chair can you
guys hear me.
Yes.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee carry cultural
Meryl on behalf of the New
Mexico council about the nursing
guides first and foremost I just
want to recognize that trapping
is not an archaic practice it is
widely approved it is a widely
approved wildlife management
tool that is utilized by every
wildlife management agency in
the country including the states
that have various levels of
recreational trapping bands we
oppose this legislation for
several reasons but primarily
because the concerns that have
been expressed over the years by
the legislature and by members
of the urban public have
actually already been result yet
this bill provides absolutely no
recognition of that effort.
Changes to the trapping bill
went to the trapping rule went
into effect in in twenty twenty
and included a complete
elimination of trapping in areas
with heavy recreational
activities such as the Sandia's.
Amongst other things these
improvements were enacted in
twenty twenty after an extensive
public input process and they
should be given time to prove
themselves as effective this
bill would nullify those efforts
and would create a wide sweeping
sweeping traffic trapping ban
across all public lands much of
the land that would be impacted
by this bill is very remote and
were rarely sees any human
activity at all other than
trappers.
This bill would also have
negative implications on
conservation efforts that are
currently utilizing recreational
trappers in order to save on
costs it would increase the
burden on the game and fish to
respond to all for beer
mitigation on public land and
these are all considerations
that need to be.
Considered before you implement
a statewide trapping them thank
you.
Thank you we now have
that the print is very tiny so
I'm getting to it it's a Sean
Carroll and then after Sean Kyle
Jackson.
John.
John Carroll on.
Okay let's move on is Kyle
Jackson on.
Yes madam chair thank you for
your time and committee members
can you hear me yes.
I appreciate your time I am
opposed to this bill I do not
represent anybody except for
myself as a sportsman and a
trapper
driving's been identified as
leaked by leading wildlife
professionals as important
management tool for wildlife
I call from the association of
fish and wildlife agencies on
for more management regulated
trapping is used by state
federal and tribal agencies to
manage wildlife habits.
Fights many benefits to people
protecting endangered species
are vulnerable lifecycle periods
example sea turtles island
ground nesting birds.
Introducing populations example
river otters right read New
Mexican wolves beavers
scientifically Mari and will
population size and health
providing relief to public in
the form of property damage and
to go back and read that on the
station while the association
for some wildlife agency's
website
similarly the wildlife society
has a pro stance on regulated
trapping my biggest concern
with this is specific
legislation is that it.
Singles out a certain user group
on public lands and I think it's
a bad purposes to set
in
Germany who can and cannot use
our public lands
as this practice is currently.
Supported by while I
professionals and is when done
legally and say it's very
species specific it's very
Yes.
Very determined and animals and
it catches so I would worry
about what comes next it's a
certain group of users does not
like the way to be is that gonna
be banned of public lands
again the science behind
trapping is absolutely
Your funeral while I
professionals believe it's a
great tool I believe that we
should not pass this bill thank
you for your time.
Thank you very much I see that
Senator Pirtle is on with this

Chair chairs to fed ex yes your
chance to fan ex members of the
Senate conservation committee my
name is Jake pop and I'm with
the sportsmen's alliance.
You guys hear me yes we can okay
your chair so that shares the
panics and members of the Senate
conservation committee my name
is Jacob up and I'm with the
sportsmen's alliance I am
testifying today on behalf of
our New Mexico members the
sportsmen's alliance is a
leading national organization
that protects the this tenants
of the north American model of
wildlife conservation and
testifying today in opposition
Senate bill thirty two this
legislation prohibits all forms
of trapping on state land in New
Mexico and acting a prohibition
on public land trapping will
have far reaching negative
impacts on the north American
model of wildlife conservation
agriculture livestock producers
in New Mexico and the general
public health and safety we urge
this committee to join us in
opposition according to a
technical review of the north
American model of wildlife
conservation published by the
professional society for
wildlife biologist the wildlife
society trapping is an integral
part of the north American model
of wildlife conservation and as
such the ability to do so should
be protected additionally
trapping is managed to
scientifically based regulations
and is one of the more strictly
regulated outdoor activities in
North America according to the
association of fish and wildlife
agencies.
Because it is integral role
trapping plays in the north
American model this legislative
effort is interpreted as an
attack on all wildlife
conservation efforts in the US
which is funded almost
exclusively by sportsmen banker
edging the dismantling of the
north American model to
legislative activism this
committee would ultimately stand
on the wrong side of
conservation history wildlife
must be properly managed to
ensure ecological balance and
prevent human wildlife conflict
few groups of people in the U.
S. understand this better than
the hunting fishing farming
entrapping Communities sportsmen
sportswomen in New Mexico
strongly believe the wildlife
management decisions should be
made by professional wildlife
biologist at the New Mexico
department of game and fish The
New Mexico agriculture community
relies on regulated trapping to
protect cropland and to mitigate
livestock depredation trapping
is an effective method for
managing nuisance animals such
as coyotes that prey on
livestock resulting in millions
of dollars in cattle and sheep
losses in New Mexico a two
thousand ten USDA state reports
study for New Mexico found in
two thousand eight the cattle
and sheep industry in New Mexico
generated more than one billion
dollars in accounted for more
than thirty two percent of the
cash receipts for all
agricultural commodities
combined in the state in two
thousand and ten the national
agricultural statistics service
reported that predators
throughout New Mexico killed
nine thousand nine hundred head
of cattle a five point three
million dollar loss in two
thousand and nine eighty two
hundred sheep and lamb or loss
deprivations are unit nine
hundred one thousand dollars
research suggests that losses
would be two to three times
higher without a livestock
production programs and program
in place in the state a two
thousand ten USDA report dealing
strictly with nationwide
catalyzes found priorities
account for the highest
percentage of cattle loss to the
predators accounted for the
highest percentage of cattle
deaths due to predators and in
New Mexico the percentage of
cattle lost due to coyotes in
two thousand fifteen with sixty
percent and the CAC.
Losses due to coyotes is forty
nine point five percent New
Mexico clearly has an ongoing
predator control issue that
regulated trapping directly
mitigates.
Mr up you've gone over of well
over a minute so we're going on
to the next person please thank
you thank you.
Romero can you speak or not.
I think we hear you.
You can hear me yes we can go
ahead you have a minute okay.
my name is it Romero thank you
for letting me be.
We were might doubt that the
wildlife farted and also it
proper
The the the.
Okay first of all everyone
talked about the wildlife
Well I thought I would like to
talk about all the the mall came
like quail rabbit world all that
we need to protect you and when
they're over populated with
predators they don't let me in
on the upper
I also like to say that the.
They are big about.
The make the right well.
And how good they're doing those
animals were also trapped with
the think that we are legally
thank you.
and the rock we lost it formed
urgently from and legal proper.
Not all law abiding proper.
one thing I like that they don't
take my word for it don't make
any one speaking on behalf of
a PO or order we do your
homework and learn about that
then and now.
And now the find out the facts
about it not just might say so
are they anyone out they told me
there's no if you look it up
there's no fact that.
Trapping the barbaric or or or
all.
May that any we all well by the
log.
And all.
You know follow up thank you Mr.
You got almost two minutes thank
you so much okay we are now and
is Pat Powell or shoe State.
Santo aren't.
Pat Howell.
The Santo.
Okay how about Bob Graham.
For then Mary.
Madam chairs yes.
I have a note that Tyson Sanders
Sean Carroll are both in the
waiting room if you can see it
there on your list I Sean
Carroll is on the list and.
Senator zero one if you have
either of those try made to get
them to talk.
Okay.
Let me keep going down the list
and I can go back to
John Carroll was on the list
Sean go ahead.
John Carroll could you go ahead
makers the statement.
Okay Shawn is still connecting
according to mine.
Okay Sean Carroll.
If you're on could you go ahead
and speak.
Yes I'm here can you hear me yes
please go ahead for about a
minute.
Show Carroll and the president
of the New Mexico conservation
officers association I represent
seventy of the members of this
group will be most affected by
this bill we are completely
opposed to this bill this bill
and for similar one it was
introduced two years ago and
failed in in of the bill.
But the New Mexico department of
game and fish to address these
concerns since then the
department has made these
changes to the rules are very
close and how are you serious
they've dramatically increased
increases set back from trail
heads and now they require
mandatory trapper education for
all trappers we're in the first
season these regulations so
they're impacts can even be
senior so what are we seeing a
bill again or why do we need
legislative action with the
department did exactly what the
legislator asked of them and
which it we haven't even had
time to see these concerns and
see if they've been address.
Well this is tractors to manage
for bear populations this is a
management tool that actually
doesn't cost the department
anything people actually pay the
department to help with this
management we take a stroll away
from the department who is going
to do the management of the
species is it going to be the
department employees yes it is
okay so is there any
appropriations for hiring more
officers staff to deal with this
Burberry Management if not how
do you plan to pay for statewide
management of the Sperber
species plus replace a three
point four million dollars of
revenue each year the trappers
bring into the state we're
asking you make these decisions
based on science and not on
people's emotions as of a few
individuals thank you.
Thank you got about one minute
forty seconds thank you a
Tiffany Rivera and then we'll go
to Tyson.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee thank you for the
opportunity to comment this
morning near Avera registered
lobbyists for New Mexico farm
and livestock bureau I stand in
opposition of this bill the bill
before you today again prohibits
individuals from being able to
trap poison or snare predators
many of these predators
harass and kill livestock
removal of these management
tools will greatly impact the
livestock industry as it
prohibits the use of an
extremely effective management
option for public land lefties
just as it is important to
protect our domestic animals it
is equally as important to
protect our livestock the cattle
industry contributes nine
hundred and ninety three point
eight million dollars to the New
Mexico economy and is ranked
second in agricultural cash
commodities in the state only
behind Derry.
Recently the New Mexico game
commission it revamped many of
its rules pertaining to wildlife
management while also
restricting trapping an
additional public areas
including the Sandia mountains
these rules which have been
updated now include new trapper
education requirements which
will lead to reduce public
trapper conflicts.
These updated rules are still
new and have not been granted
the time to be fully implemented
long enough for them to be able
to reap the full benefits we
recommend allowing the
department of game and fish as
well as the game commission
additional time to fully work
out these rules and to refine
them before making any
unnecessary additional changes
to statute once again the best
way to reduce public trapper
conflict is to equal education
and outreach to both parties and
we must ensure that each party
is taking the required
responsibility to safely and
beneficially use the public
lands which belong to all of us
thank you for the time this
morning thank you
now we'll go to Tyson Sanders.
Good morning madam chair
Senators can you hear me this
position correct.
Yes I'm in opposition to this
okay go ahead.
Thank you for allowing me.
To comment on my opposition
against Senate bill thirty two
my name is Tyson Sanders I work
as a conservation officer
sergeant in the Albuquerque and
Santa Fe area.
I am the vice president of the
New Mexico conservation officers
association I'm speaking on
their behalf today.
Two years ago the same bill was
presented at the legislature
memorial was created directing
the New Mexico game and fish to
address complex high use
recreation areas an inmate New
Mexico game and fish is done
just that they prohibited
trapping in the same year ranger
district organ mountains than
half mile of New Mexico highway
four seventy five on Santa Fe
National Forest.
It's now illegal to trap in the
Sandia's they have mandated
trapper education for trappers
and prohibited trapping within
half mile trail had statewide so
we have a regular regulating
agency is doing its job in
regulating these areas of
concern conflicts.
Officers who work to send user
reporting a dramatic reduction
to nearly nonexistent trapping
related calls so Senators I ask
you to let government work
please let government do its job
I about this.
Thank you.
Excuse me excuse me Senator
Sedillo Lopez please put
yourself on mute.
Thank you I'm sorry if you could
please yes you asking if this
address the issue and I have
with ever changing wildlife
dynamics please allow wildlife
managers and conservation
officers the flexibility to
manage these dynamic issues as
they have the past century.
Also like to bring up the north
American model conservation many
of you this is sort of the
guiding document what
conservation should look like it
has seven components rather than
a guidelines components are list
of what we have done right over
the past one hundred years
specifically component to this
how it has been demonstrated
through cited science that
through trapping for bears have
been managed a sustainable
through a combination of reduce
vulnerability restricted right
regulations and advocacy of
trappers for land stewardship
this is something the North
America something North America
in New Mexico has been getting
right trapping is part of
conservation.
I would also like to point out
that the number one threat to
the north American model
conservation is anti hunting and
trapping sentiment the number
one threat or detriment to
conservation anti hunting
sentiment not founded in science
but rather motion a personal
bias thank.
Your time has been exceeded
thank you very much so.
now let's see if we have some of
these other people here again
do we have ballot we worked up
here.
This Valerie here where cap.

Chair of the calibers wildlife
Committee a point that out to
say you know I've spent my
career working with the
dedicated to conservation and
the best land and wildlife
management practices I would
share the following information
to assist you guys making
sounded educated decisions first
the professional staff of the
department of game fish uses
public crappy this part of the
wildlife management program
sure a balanced population of
all wildlife trapping is a vital
tool in actually helping with
introduction and survival of
animals that are actually on a
threatened or endangered list of
bring up the lesser prairie
chicken you spent thousands and
thousands of dollars trying to
reintroduce and protect that
that the animal and part of that
process is trapping that helps
us with endangered species of
the game and fish department
game commission adopted and
implemented the new rules that
you've heard about several times
given this the chance to work
please I would would would ask
you of.
It is part of best management
practice you that process was
paramount in the decision making
and it's not legal trappers that
they are causing issues it's
illegal.
Allow our conservation officers
the opportunity to do their job
and and the.
Protect the folks that are
actually inviting laws of
providing with the law of.
This will just put an added
burden on the state conservation
officers and it's already a
strapped the state agency in
addition I would leave with the
with the understanding that
trappers are not out trying to
catch pets there are also rules
about people letting their pets
run wild on least on on public
lands I appreciate your time and
opportunity to speak here and
the know that there are comments
will help guide you in your
decision making process thank
you thank you this reader gentry
on.
Well All sure.
Read.
Gentry on.
I see one reason she there.
Well somebody has around.
Okay redid gentry go ahead
you're our last you are last
opponent speaker thank you very
much retention thank you thank
you madam chair and committee
members my name is ritu gentry I
appreciate the chance to comment
on my concerns about SB thirty
two I do support a clear and
comprehensive ban on trapping in
New Mexico however I am
concerned that this bill in
section.
In section four subsections to
CDC and of he allows government
agencies and researchers to use
lethal traps and snares when
they have other options to
protect the public and manage
ecosystems there are also no
clear previews provisions for
humane released alive trapped
animals to be re located in
section F.
of section and subsection F. of
section four section four
subsection G. R. also does not
clearly identify who consent
cage traps and it may allow
members of the public to trap on
lands are using cage traps that
it's a subsection needs to be
clarified
I also ask that you support
clear provisions in subsection
G. to return trapped animals to
their home areas or provisions
for humane relocation to
supportive habitats
thank you very much thank you
okay now we're going to the
supporters we heard from town
opponents the last one was kind
of mixed but had suggestions for
changes in the bill so we're
going to the opponents I'm
starting with directly to legal.
Erica so you then go ahead.
Sam all the ensuring AA the
hanbok akki.
Madam chair members of the
committee good morning my name
is Derek to legal I want to tell
you a story about my best
friend.
Thank you live to love and love
to live like that when we were
wild and free she was a husky
that meant everything to me.
We played together everyday like
the native Calvin and Hobbes and
so when they we couldn't she
went missing.
My family and I search for her
for days and days but because of
reckless trapping she was caught
in a deadly Kate for at least
three or four days since we
found here.
She was more dead than alive
with the smell of future waste
the name was robin if she was
here today so make sure S. local
prior to make sure no animals
through what she went through.
Thanks for creating space and
opportunity for this because
robin I support Senate bill
thirty two thank you.
Thank you we now go to.
Eddie Estrada.
Thank you madam chair and
members of this committee for
taking public testimony today my
name is a D. Estrada and I am a
resident of Dona Ana County and
I work as a field representative
for the endangered species
coalition.
One of the federally federally
listed endangered species that
we work to protect is the
Mexican gray wolf with only
eighty seven wolves in the wild
in New Mexico it's one of the
most imperilled rules in the
country and they're facing many
challenges and traps are just
another obstacle for successful
recovery efforts in our
neighboring state of Arizona
we're trapping is already banned
on public lands only four wheels
have had the misfortune of
getting injured and traps in
contrast here in New Mexico over
forty it's about forty six
Mexican gray wolves have been
trapped over the last two
decades that's a one thousand
percent increase in the number
of incidents out of those
eighteen were injured for
required amputations and seven
resulted in death and we're
still getting reports that there
are numerous more injuries in
the last quarter of twenty
twenty so as you can see the
detrimental impact that traps
have on endangered species it's
clear it's just a bad
combination so I humbly ask for
your support of SB thirty two to
help endangered species all
across New Mexico thank you.
Thank you at Michelle lute are
you here.
Hi.
Please go ahead thank you madam
chair and committee members I
live in Santa Fe in the National
Guard or conservation manager
for project Heidi in the former
wildlife biologist for nine
million acres of New Mexico
state trust land I come from
three generations of farmers
also as a PhD scientist I say
confidently science doesn't
support we feel trafficking as
wildlife management modern
conservation understands of
biodiversity and ecosystem
health and function is best
managed by protecting natural
process sees and cycles trapping
is management is akin to
bloodletting as medicine file
just might have once thought
trapping accomplish something
but we now know trying to manage
wildlife like cash crops is
harmful to ecosystems.
Having will not impact
population the coyote store nor
do we needed to they self
regulate and have done so based
on compensatory mechanisms and
native credibility native prey
availability for millennia
trapping does however threatened
populations of less common in
imperiled species like sort of
fox's and Lobos the best
available science points to
nonlethal methods to
Representative prevent livestock
wildlife conflict finally we
don't need science to tell us
trapping is wrong the on ending
instances where the public
encounter straps is as evidence
enough please support Roxy's law
to ban public land stripping
thank you.
Thank you for the
Members I've been lucky we
started up before I started the
stopwatch and some people went
two minutes but we're really
letting people go for about a
minute and a half now.
Okay the next one is bill adding
ten and then after that is
Garrett Bennett costs and.
Bill adding ten are you on.
Can you hear me yes we can.
Yes ma'am I don't know if you
could save me but I can't log in
the interest of time I just
continue my bill Addington
I'm a fourth generation rancher
we ratchet about sixty five
thousand acres are ratchet about
thirty two miles from corner to
corner
we've had we we really have.
Ever had any problems with up.
Coyotes and mountain lions
taking our tabs during calving.
In the house over a hundred
years that we've been in
existence in West Texas and
southern New Mexico
I I laugh every time I hear that
we need to regulate.
Animals when they did doing so
successfully for millennia these
animals do not need us to in.
Intervene on the behalf to
regulate them in fact the deer
and the coyotes and all the prey
again they have a symbiotic
relationship where the coyotes
and.
Not lives only kill.
What is
what is a week.
Strengthening the genetic
diversity of these animals are
also.
I don't think it's it's it's
it's it's wise are are necessary
to be.
Are doing this at all it is
cruel inhumane.
All the last thing I'll say I'll
be quick is that outside you're
on a ranch right now excuse me
is that I was personally
affected by it in forty four
years ago on our ranch put out
by the federal government I
picked this thing up I don't
know you see the even if you
Representative M. forty four hi
together they call.
Has a finite cartridge and it a
power it is powered by a spring
loaded.
The firing pin that sits a
thirty eight special black
cartridge into the coyotes are
like a cloud of cult of.
Find I. dust.
If not for the win that day when
I picked this thing up and
exploded my.
I would be dead and not talking
to you today.
The wind blew Mister Addington
you've gone couple minutes so
thank you though for all your
comments.
Kasson.
Good morning madam chair members
committee galvanic costs and I'm
the northern conservation
director for the New Mexico wild
I'm also hunt that I have the
public lance hunter angler and I
ran a trap line with my Big
Brother is a little boy outside
Santa Fe so I know quite a bit
about trapping.
One of my biggest arguments is
you know it's been a lot of talk
about the north American model
of wildlife conservation the
second primary tenant of the
model is a prohibition of
commercialization of wildlife
and this is the
commercialization of public
wildlife we can't talk about
eliminating commercialization of
elk and antelope and deer tags
and then on the other side of
our main office Forsman say that
it's okay to commercialized for
bears and so I think there's a
you know a great deal of of of
of contrast of interest here and
I I again I I very much against
the commercialization of any
public wildlife and as a as a
hunter and and and and someone
who has trapped
you know trapping can be nasty
Business and anybody's walked up
on a faster about chatter even a
dog in a trap
it's just it's just not it's not
great in in my mind for for
sportsmen to to have this
association and I I just think
there's so many people in the
what's now it's not like it was
when I was little kid I think
it's I think it's time to to set
trapping aside and and used
which emit means of hunting to
to to harvest our wildlife so I
support this bill and I think
it's right thing to do thank you
okay next we have
Mary Catherine right.
I saw her on the.
Can you hear me thank you can
yes.
Thank you committee my name's
Mary Catherine right you don't
see much expected we have really
about internet I live in the
hinterland of ciclo county and
volunteer with the Sierra Club
entrapping New Mexico would
people reported dog being traps
to trap for NM dot org their
email comes to me the panic the
screens the difficulty opening
the trap and the loss of peace
of mind and reluctance to return
to the place that happened are
all common features of these
reports.
I also have had to rescue my own
dog from a trap my least dog
from a legal trap on National
Forest land near our home new
regulations adopted last year
would it change nothing about
what happened she and I were
both injured even though I got
her out quickly some people
experience worse outcomes
including incurring veterinary
and medical expenses now I don't
return to that place in winter
it might as well say keep out
because I never want to hear my
dog scream like that again our
experiences Bhilai the claim the
traps are selective and humane
they are neither please support
SB thirty two thank you all.
Thank you.
I'm is Jason Thompson on and
then banned Chilton.
Jason are you on.
Okay is Ben Shelton on.
Hi Kevin Bixby.
Please go ahead.
Thank you madam chair and
committee members my name is
Kevin Bixby and executive
director of the southwest
environmental center in Los
crucis I'm also an elected
member of the board of
supervisors of the Dona Ana soil
and water conservation district.
And I was part of the working
group convened by the department
came a fish a couple years ago
to discuss changes to the
trapping rules.
We support SB thirty two.
Many of our members live in
recreation on public lands in
southern New Mexico we are so
fortunate your that we can
pursue these activities year
round I was out hiking this past
weekend in the national money or
no staff does a piece national
monument is and there are a lot
of other people doing the same
thing.
Have some public lands pose a
threat to our members and all
public land users there like
land mines basically waiting to
harm whatever unfortunate
creature happens a step on him.
Whether it's a wild animal or a
pet dog.
Or a course carrying a writer or
god forbid a human being I
taught my daughters at an early
age how do we lease our dog from
the local trap and nobody should
have to do that to teach their
children how to do that.
The minor tweaks to the trapping
rules implemented by the
department do not come close to
addressing this issue there are
many popular used areas in the
organ mountains desert peaks
national monument for example
we're trapping is still out.
And that.
Well just leave it there thank
you.
Thank you very much for joining
us okay do we have.
Jason Thompson or Ben Shelton
on.
Okay Chris Smith and Matt
Carroll.
Morning madam chair can you hear
me yes we can.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee for hearing this
important legislation my name is
Chris Smith I work for WildEarth
guardians and I'm here on behalf
of our thousands of supporters
across New Mexico I also
participated in the
aforementioned working group on
trapping regulations WildEarth
guardians opposes public lands
trapping for number of reasons
you've heard about the cruelty
the indiscriminate nature of
taps the public safety hazard
that they create already we've
seen about ten dogs trapped
across the state even with these
supposedly new and improved
regulations in place this
trapping season and we're only
halfway through it.
But this is also an equity and
an environmental issue the scale
of killing while the world is
going through the sixth mass
extinction event is astounding
roughly a hundred and fifty
thousand animals killed by
private trappers in the state
since two thousand eight for
most of the species the
department of game and fish has
no real idea how populations are
faring.
Essentially asked trappers that
they're still catching and
killing these animals and when
the department here's yes the
thing okay those populations are
fine.
Many of these animals are
critical to the functioning
balance of our fragile desert
ecosystems these animals are a
public asset that benefit all
New Mexicans but their kids in
unlimited numbers on public
lands for private profit by a
tiny few and that's unacceptable
I urge you to support this
legislation it's long overdue
thank you.
Thank you very much.
One sitting who's been sitting
there all morning behind the
name Patty.
were you intending to speak.
Now okay
so I have a seat three hundred
I've had eight
Supporters will try to get to
more is Ben Shelton on or.
And mackerel or Britney Fallon.
Okay Barbara Calif.
Jacquelyn copious.
The N. and dropped.
Hildegard Adams.
Okay are there any
Proponents that I have not
called on I could use great
Peter so your proponent.
Yes there okay please go ahead.
Thank you madam chair I'll be
speaking on behalf of C. N. M.
on instead of them children my
name is Greg Peters thank you
could you tell everybody work
out what CV NM ins for the
public yes conservation voters
New Mexico I am the public lands
and wildlife advocate receiving
and here standing strong
supporter SB thirty two.
Previous speakers and done an
excellent job explaining the
need for this legislation so I
will brief us on public lands is
a public safety issue public
access issue anymore issue an
important conservation and
environmental which positions
being a dangerous activity
indiscriminately threatening
native wildlife companion
animals it poses a threat to
human land users has a negative
impact on our outdoor recreation
for CENIC industries.
Thanks is showing that trapping
stress because system
functionality and it is in fact
not effective way of controlling
deprivation New Mexico wildlife
is in the public trusts
currently being stripped in
public lands for private profit.
Finding trapping our public
lands will make them safer for
New Mexico residents in New
Mexico wildlife pretty more
equitable access to major
benefiting our local.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you for your
time.
Thank you.
Okay is there anyone more
proponent.
If not we're moving on to the
committee.
Okay I'd like to.
We have our term who's entering.
Arturo thank you.
Okay.
And he's a proponent.
He is our last speaker once he
gets in.
Well actually I called on Jason
Thompson a couple times Jason
has signed up so Jason go ahead.
Can you hear me yes.
Yes.
Thank you thank you madam chair
names Jason Thompson and the
averages of this for the New
Mexico that are in medical
association and that my
apologies for the connection
issues here but not to belabor
that previous points but from
all the previous point stated at
the backup battery Medical soci
stands in strong support of the
bill Maher's the activity to
pass this bill thank you madam
chair thank you very much okay
Trevor were done without public
comment at this time we've had
ten opponents intend proponents
we are now going to committee
members and I have selected
renewable please.
Thank you madam chair first off
I'm not a big fan of trapping
but I understand why some are I
grew up in agriculture in your
district chair.
my family have got Google ranges
down north the client's corners
don't roll nation or world we
have problems with the predators
and I don't remember us ever
using trapping but I understand
it's pool.
May be useful particularly for
agriculture my question is what
is public land we just talking
State Land or do we include B.
L. M. of the sponsor or expert
witness maybe you could tell me.
How broadly are redefining
public lands.
Senator Gonzales madam chair
thank you senator Neville it
would be ill public land will be
considered B. L. M. for service.
Any part of land that is used by
public for that everyone uses.
So it does include the federal
lands as well yes the resolver
team at all.
Right
I think New Mexico something
like forty percent public lands
that not a reasonably accurate
number.
Our state I think that includes
state I'm not sure.
Madam chair senator Neville I
think you're very thank you to
that.
You're in southern southeastern
New Mexico about half of the
landowners public and when
you're up in my part of the
world about ninety percent of it
is public sort your rancher that
uses B. L. M. or.
Conceivably for service Landon
you're having an issue what
methodology would we employed to
deal with the predator prop get
cheaper something out and San
Juan County.
What's so what's our if we don't
use trapping what's our
methodology that we would use to
deal with creditors.
Very well All thank you madam
chair senator Avella let me usko
Jessica Johnson to assist with
that concern.
Yes please.
Thank you senator and madam
chair and senator renewable
thank you for that question so
for at livestock owners who are
concerned about protecting their
livestock from carnivore species
there would still be a variety
of options for folks to employee
in order to do so
at first I thought you know I'll
just mention there there is a
suite of options in terms of
preventive defensive
Methods in order to at simply
block the card of course from
accessing the predators or to
scare the that
at that are the covers from
accessing the livestock my
apologies or at or to deter or
scare off those kind of our
species
there are also a couple of
exceptions in the bill that
livestock owners could look to
they could work with the
department of game and fish to
work with their officers or an
agent in order to utilize
nonlethal traps or snares in
order to deal with depredation.
the exception for cage traps
would also apply and they could
use cage traps to protect their
livestock to capture and remove
animals according to our laws
that dictate the disposition of
those animals and then of course
there's always the old fashioned
firearm that would still be
permitted under this law.
Thank you madam chair
Firearms are methodology we
didn't use traps that to I know
whether ranchers yet and I think
to whenever they had issues a
predominately sheep raisers
that's a big issue for them.
Their ability to deal with
creditors is.
Would be greatly hampered a
suspect if we didn't allow some
exception for livestock I don't
think that's in the bill was my
concern.
That's really all my questions
madam chair.
I'll pass it on thank you thank
you I I next on the list I have
almost everyone I have Center
Hamlin Senator Schmedes Senator
souls in centigrade goes Senator
Hamblen you have the floor.
The bill would you take your
hand down.
Thanks.
Thank you madam chair I
appreciate the opportunity and
send members of the committee
and Senator Gonzalez and all of
the folks who are talking I know
that I'm not alone when I say
that we've received a quite a
bit and there's a very good
group of passionate people both
for and against wrapping up one
of the things that stuck out to
me and I appreciate all the
testimony and and and the
conversations have been had
today one of the things that is
standing out to me is
and this is just clarification
for me is what how does this
applied to wild horses because
one of the things we have in our
state and that is from as long
as I can remember of wild
Mustangs in relocating and and
so if miss Johnson could or
maybe Senator Gonzales could
address how that how this
affects either relocating or or
or tracking of those wild horses
I've had several emails.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you senator madam chair
Senator had just of very well
all that the concerned came
about all we could go.
And so immediately and I brought
it to the attention of all our
expert witness Jessica so she
did do some follow up and no
also you know some.
You know the concerns committee
because she says I know we never
have dealt with that part of
well we're it would be for
anything with wild horses so at
this point manager might be able
to Jessica.
Yes Mister Johnson.
Thank you madam chair and
senator Hammond thank you for
the opportunity for me to
address that issue so the the
bottom line is that this bill
will not impact while our
management this bill is focused
on the devices at that
individuals or government
entities can use to capture
animals there is a slew of other
state and federal laws out there
including laws regarding wild
forces that dictate the
circumstances and the
disposition options for captured
animals
but this bill would not affect
or remove any existing
protections for any other and
animals including wild horses.
Etcetera have on you have the
floor.
that is all that I have.
And and share thank you so much
we now go to Senator Schmedes.
Thank you very much madam chair
and thank you senator ms
Johnson.
appreciate all the public
comments as well on both sides
of the issue
my my questions today
really gonna come in just to two
main things one is as as a.
In a very public lands.
A district my constituents are
extremely concerned with the
safety of public lands you know
when we had multiple people talk
about the C. and B. as well
that's that's my district
we have an area of very high
outdoor recreation and my
district is my constituents are
very strongly supportive of the
game commissions recent ban on
trapping in in that area.
and so
you know with with that being
said I I lived in an area where
there was no conservation wasn't
in this country others no
wildlife there and so when we
approach these issues I I feel
like we have to really stay as
scientific as possible and and
mark my second priority besides
public land safety is
the health and wellness of the
for very population so that's
that's where I'm coming at today
with with these questions I in
in listening to the testimony
and money money understanding
this this question is for Mrs
Johnson
You know when I look at the
science on predator control
I I I just don't.
I just don't feel like this
science is there to show that
that we need all this predator
control as far as is as traffic
goes is that is that Mr Johnson
is that your your understanding
of what the evidence shows.
Madam chair and senator smitteez
thank you for that question and
yes you know the the
growing at recent scientific
evidence and studies that look
and to you know in particular
carnivore at population and self
management or windows human
legal control it shows that that
that we can control is really
not effective over the long term
and and off and I can even be
counterproductive to actually
increase populations in the
short term and you know I I
couldn't interpret that you know
of thirty forty studies that
that are out there for you
At the safely but one thing that
I can do is have maybe point the
committee to look at the
depredation rates in New Mexico
compared to Colorado and Arizona
because we have neighboring
states that you know are
different from New Mexico but
there's some similarities in
terms of in terms of landscape
and in terms of wildlife
populations of species that live
there and also some similarities
in terms of you know that the
cattle and the and she parents
that occupy the lands in the
states so when you look at
Arizona where at trapping has
been banned on public lands
since the mid nineties and then
you look at Colorado where
trapping has been banned but
pretty much statewide since the
mid nineties
You know maybe you you might
wonder if they are experiencing
higher levels of carnivore
attacks on livestock in those
states because they don't have
the trappings but in fact the
opposite is true so here in New
Mexico where we still have
trapping statewide including our
public lands are depredation
rates are higher than in Arizona
and Colorado so that's another
example to point to you in terms
of impacts on the ground and how
you know traps really do not
present themselves as the answer
to protecting livestock.
Thank you thank you for that Mr
Johnson that's that's kind of
where I come from on that issue
now on on the other hand.
I'll be honest and I I I have a
concern for responsible trappers
in this state and the what I
call responsible trapping that
goes on in very very rural
areas.
And so on you know kind of from
a public land Steinborn once
again coming from a district
that has a high area of outdoor
recreation where pretty much
everybody I have needed I've
heard from constituents that
oppose this bill but they're
highly supportive of the
trapping band in my district in
the Sandia's because they say
you know there should be any
trapping others too many people
out walking and picnicking and
camping at Centro.
I'm in in developing this
legislation I mean do you think
there's any role for for any
sort of what I'll just call a
compromise for identifying areas
that are very very rural that
have low areas and outdoor
recreation we're we're
responsible trapping could be
done was that was that all part
of the development of this
legislation and and you think it
could play a possible role or
not.
Madam chair and senator smitteez
you know I think I think with
the limitation of a heat
trapping ban two areas centered
around urban centers is the
approach that at the game
commission check when it enacted
new regulations approximately a
year ago
and what we've seen from that is
that this year compared to years
past there has been an uptick in
I reports from the public where
their dogs are being caught in
traps they found a lost dog
caught in a trap they're finding
a live animal or dead skin
animals left on public lands
because of trappers and all of
those instances have been
outside of the recent closure
areas so you know to to focus on
the more urban areas in terms of
the ban on traps snares and
poisons on public lands doesn't
in my mind do justice to where
these incidents are actually
taking place the other thing
that I would say is that you
know to focus on
that the interface between the
general public and trapping and
the public safety aspect is an
important reason why this
legislation is going forward but
it's also only one reason for
this you know we can talk about
the cruelty of the of the
devices that I if you know if
there was times that the
committee was interested I could
go into you know reviewing
scientific studies of the injury
rates from like cold traps and
you know to get into the number
is rather than just the feelings
about Goldie and we can also you
know we also need to look at you
know that the inherent
exploitation that happens with
trapping we're talking about
taking for bear.
is off of our public lands and
selling them for commercial
profit and that is it is a very
real problem regardless of how
populated or how frequently
recreation a parcel of land is
so
I I absolutely understand your
point but I think when when you
know advocates have looked at
developing this legislation
we've tried to look holistically
at all of the problems inherent
in trapping and trying to make
sure that all of them are at
least somewhat addressed.
Thank you in all Madam I'll move
on from that issue I think we
could get get stuck on it
you know the commercialization
stuff I think it's that's
probably a lot to be had there I
have two very specific questions
about the bill either for the
sponsor or or ms Johnson one is
on case trapping I just you know
I'm trying to look and and
really narrow in on what is our
what are our goals with this
legislation once again my goals
for my constituents they want
safe public lands and and they
want to see healthy wildlife I
mean I had I have in my own yard
hear them in the mountains I've
had no a lot of wildlife
including bears and it's a
wonderful beautiful place to
live
and that's what my constituents
want and so I want to be sure
were kinda laser focused or as
focused as we can possibly be so
I I did notice in and have some
constituents bring up the
concern about cage trap use
and I'm not a trapper I I hope
know hardly anything about
trapping but I can just envision
that cage traps don't don't seem
to be
you know they're not these
little hidden things they're not
gonna kill kill domestic
animals that sort of thing they
just don't so you know they're
not these sign I'd always and
bombs we heard about in in just
trying to kind of I guess where
I'm really coming at at this is
by banning trapping I I do have
some concern that we're were
removing a population of people
that value wildlife okay and
when wildlife is devalued by any
population that could
potentially put that wildlife
population at risk and so my my
question is with given those
those concerns.
From my constituents why why is
it why is there a broader cage
trapping ban I understand
there's a small exception but
my understanding for examples
Colorado did not been cage traps
so
miss Johnson could could you
discuss that with me with why
why that was was put in.
Absolutely madam chair and
senator committees so I it
sounds like largely what you
have heard from your district is
you know the concern about
public safety and you know the
interaction between other public
land users and the dangers
presented by most traps and
snares and poisons the case is
trapped at prohibition is
focused more on the
exploitation of the fur bearing
species so you know wanting to
ensure that if if part of this
effort is not just to protect
the public but to also help
conserve wildlife populations
we're also making sure that
individuals couldn't just move
to cage traps to continue to
trap limitless numbers of
bobcats and and foxes and such
And and you know in terms of it
is that the impact on wildlife
species you know one of at the
at things mentioned earlier that
the north American model of
wildlife conservation it's the
second tenant is to prohibit the
commercial markets of wildlife
because it's the
commercialization of wildlife
and that monetary valuing of
wildlife that has in the past
threatened be existence of
entire species including wolves
and and and history so
you know to extend the
prohibition to include at traps
is to to include cage traps is
to actually take a step forward
towards more protections and
more conservation for the
wildlife.
Thank you I'm gonna give that
that topic I think some further
thought you know because I've
heard once again from
constituents that they talk
about the north American model
and and other other areas that
may or may not need reform and
it seems to me once again I'm
I'm not an expert
but I'm as trying to work
through this for my constituents
The end there I guess there's a
concern about is is this true
commercialization or not I mean
it seems like the numbers the
cash numbers are actually pretty
low we don't have corporations
going out trapping animals so
but it is a concern and I just
want to raise it hopefully for
the benefit of the discussion as
this legislation moves forward
my last question is also very
specific on page
Where is it page six
subsection H. I'm trying to in
storylines five three seventy
the exemption for the federally
and enrolled members of of
tribes and native American
populations entrapping for
ceremonial religious purposes
I'm trying to envision how this
would be carried out how this
would be practical so we have
such a member who is on public
land and they're trapping and
like the game and fish official
sees somebody setting up traps
so what what's going to happen
if this legislation signed a law
is it would they go in and ask
for identification
that that's I guess step one is
the identification and that
might be pretty straight forward
I don't know how people feel
about that but the number two
how would they how would they
prove it's it's for ceremonial
purposes I'm just trying to.
You know practically how would
that practically carry out with
with this bill and I know it's a
complicated
scenario but it will be in the
purpose and in the development
of this legislation on shore
these communities have been
consultation so you've probably
had this discussion but I'd like
to just hear practically how
that would would carry out
please.
I'm not sure and madam chair and
senator smitteez Senator
Gonzales is it okay for me to
answer this one.
Yes of course.
Okay
Thank you for that question
Senator spending so I would
you know if I work at the
department of game and fish I
would look to what
the US fish and Wildlife Service
has done
in implementing an almost
identical measure
that allows enrolled tribal
members to take and possess
eagles in eagle feathers for
ceremonial and religious
purposes where the migratory
bird treaty act
What what prevents at either end
of individuals from doing so so
what that at agency does is you
know as as part of an annual I
licensing process you know
similar to what department of
game and fish does there is a
permit application where the
individual would submit an
application I looked at the
application and ask for you know
their own I don't think
identification why it's a tribe
or pueblo or Indian nation they
are enrolled with and also
naming what at what ceremony
they are tracking for
So that you know it's sort of
the than not shell of of how
that agency deals with that on
and on an annual basis and then
that enrolled member would
receive a license or permit
reflecting that their
application was approved.
Okay great thank you for that in
and thank you Senator madam
chair woman center for for the
bill I appreciate the discussion
today the expert witnesses has
been available for other
technical questions that have on
the bill because I have given
this great thought and I I
applaud her for that.
And I can see she cares a lot of
sophistication with this issue
and so I'll just I think that
concludes my my questions but
like I said my my constituents
are very very concerned about
public land safety I still have
a little concerns about
obviously about the bill about
who we could potentially be
disenfranchised thing and then I
I certainly don't want to in any
point devalue
any population of wildlife
because we we have to be you
know that that this cannot and
then I'll probably end with this
that this cannot be an issue
about cruelty you know I I think
this has to be an issue about
wildlife.
Wellness in in populations and
if we go down the cruelty route
it's going to take us away from
scientific
scientific expertise and
scientific management of the
health of wildlife populations
if we go down that road I think
you know cruelty at any there's
a lot of things that happen that
we could perceive is cruel even
nature you know the the natural
course of nature and so so
anyway I I just
Yeah I I think we we really need
to keep this bill as tight as
possible I think it may have
room to become a little tighter
potentially but I I am
please be able to support the
bill today so thank you Senator
and the extra thank you madam
chair.
Thank you Senate committees
we're going to senator Neville
souls and I'm gonna ask the vice
chair to take over for a minute
while I walk across the hall
thank you.
Thank you madam chair and
Senator a couple of very quick
questions.
We the wildlife Department our
game and fish recently changed
the trapping laws what were the
major changes and that that
would happen in an opportunity
to be implemented and see what
their expert.
Very well thank you madam chair
let me go to all Jessica.
All right yes thank you madam
chair and senator so thank you
for that question so we at
recent regulatory changes
promulgated by the department of
game and fish included
At several and moderate measures
they added a seventy five foot
setback from a hiking trail they
closed and three small areas of
public lands near urban areas to
trapping
they also increased the check
time for traps set under water
so that they no longer have to
be checked at once every
calendar day they they can be
checked once every two calendar
days
and they also enacted a new
requirement that in order for a
licensed trapper to trap they
must attend a mandatory trapper
education course.
so those are those regulatory
changes went into effect on
April in April of twenty twenty
so they have been in full effect
at since then and certainly
since the beginning of
being a trapping season starting
November first there are some
species as as some of you know
that can be tracking around but
most for bearing species at the
trapping season begins on
November first so at this point
You know all of that the new
setback the new prohibitions the
change in the in the trap check
times those those are already in
effect
and
And you know and and we have
seen some additional and more
than usual incidences of of
negative tracking reports by the
public since the enactment of of
those regulatory changes.
And so madam chair has there
been any analysis of whether
those have been effective and I
know many of the interactions
with.
Rappers impacts occur by people
that are not following the
regulations that's not trapping
that then is poaching for
instance Rozzi the other than
that there was named after was
not trapping that was poaching
that occurred has there been any
analysis as to whether the new
regulations have had any effect
on the concerns about
interactions with pets and
public and things of that sort.
I thank you madam chair it
Senator souls so all of the
incidences that we're aware of
in this trapping season you know
I've taken place in the last
approximately two and a half
almost three months at this
point you know we haven't heard
any definitive
information from the department
of game and fish that any of
those traps have been illegal
You know it's it's hard
sometimes for us to get that
information at least relatively
quickly if they are under
investigation you know I will
mention in the in the case of
rocks the so you know and I
don't know if it was explained
that before this committee but
proxy but the name of that a dog
hiking with her human family on
public land in twenty eighteen
when she was caught in and
killed by an next mayor
That individuals of that
particular next more what is
that illegally because there
were a couple of the you know
administrative rules that that
weren't followed and set that
are set by game and fish but
unfortunately
A judge ruled that the all of
the evidence in that case had
been improperly and illegally
gathered were managed and the
charges were dropped so actually
as of right now that the trapper
that killed Rozzi has not faced
any at any recommendation for
that but I think you know what
what really resonated with
most New Mexicans from you know
the ones that I've spoken to is
you know the snare that kids
rocks you might have been
technically improper but the the
the device itself operated
exactly as it should.
And that device is legal on the
vast majority of our public
lands and so that you know it is
that is what is in mind when
when we are continuing to pursue
this legislation.
And madam chair yeah but I guess
my point is there a number ways
of taking wildlife with guns and
other things but if you don't do
it legally it's still it's
poking not traffic it's not I
think that illegally and at that
particular one of many of the
other instances what is coaching
not trapping up.
We'll trapper still need to get
a license to trap on private
land and are there any other
instances where something
requires a license to do
privately but not on public land
but is not allowed on public
lands.
Madam chair and senator sold so
this this bill because it only
applies to public land would not
in fact impact any of the
existing laws and regulations
that I'm currently manage
trapping on private lands and
that would include the licensing
requirements so some but it
might the department of game and
fish would still require a
license for people the trap on
private land.
But.
Is the game that is on private
lands is that still public
wildlife.
I'm madam chair and senator
souls I'm it's it's still
wildlife managed by the
department of game and fish you
know there's I'm not aware
you know maybe someone could
eliminate but I'm I am not aware
of
instances where the department
of game and fish's Authority
changes if
if an animal stuff on private
land versus public land you know
trappers but of course I had to
travel on private land have to
get permission from the private
landowners if they aren't the
landowner but that's an existing
requirement right now.
And madam chair kind of along
those same things why is this
only on private land and not run
a allowed on private land public
land why is it not a ban on all
wildlife that wildlife is the
property of the people of New
Mexico regardless of where it is
the wildlife doesn't know
whether it's on public or
private why are we only
protecting it in some areas.
Madam chair and senator souls
you know this is this is a bill
that has been worked on and by
advocates and also you know with
a consultation with the posing
stakeholders and with any input
we can get from the department
and you know this is where the
bill has landed
you know it Senator Gonzales as
the sponsor I don't know if you
if you want to speak to you know
that.
why this bill is is focused on
on public land you know I would
say it the bill seeks to address
what is an amalgamation of
problems particular to trapping
that happens on public land.
Madam chair on to that response
to political Senator souls.
All going into private landed
just go.
That would just be a whole
different scenario you know that
we would have to say so dealing
with well alright that it's
private and it has been a
working document for quite some
time but you know again it's
more awful the overall public
you'll grow recreation you know
have access so through the right
channels of public land versus
private land which is it was
mentioned private land is mostly
by only by permission.
So I don't know if that helps
but maybe that is something that
eventually might be looked at.
And madam chair you know I I
guess my concern is if we are
concerned about wildlife we're
concerned about wildlife
management wildlife that is on
private land is still our public
wildlife why is there any
exemption for private land out
to to do this and if trappers
are allowed on private land will
department of game and fish the
responsible for
Regulating for checking the
legality of traps and other
kinds of things on private land
and how they're being used.
Jessica Sanchez.
Door madam chair and senator
souls and you know that.
I I don't for see
You know any substantial change
and how the department of game
and fish.
Regulates trapping on private
land now all verses if and when
when this bill passes and into
law.
Madam chair I think some of my
concern is if we no longer we
only allow trapping on private
land that the department of game
and fish will just quit dealing
with regulating trapping at all
and the management of those
species that we know we have
vast tracts of private land as
well that is important to our
wildlife in many many different
areas and it seems like laws
dealing with our wildlife the
wildlife belongs to the people
and not to the private land
owner and we are just feeding
that property right almost to
that by doing this only on
private land and not out on
public land not on all private
land
the last thing we are concerned
about the wildlife that there
been instances of wildlife and
things injured by dogs that were
unleashed on public lands and it
injured the public's wildlife.
And if that tracked at all.
At madam chair and senator souls
I I do not have that data.
I guess I'm concerned what we're
concerned about the the cruelty
to wild white lots of wildlife
is injured I Pat who are not.
I delayed it we there's lots of
information particularly dealing
with cats and birds that the
major concern for bird
populations in the country the
major predator are house cats
and yet we don't seem to be we
as worried about the wildlife
injured by our pets as we are
pet three injured by traps or
wildlife or other kinds of
things that we're trying to
regulate it and so yeah I just.
I guess I would prefer that we
give an opportunity for the
changes in the the trapping
requirements the regulations I
think the department came at
this very I took to heart the
the request came setbacks
limited areas open to trapping
and give those a chance to work
but this is a bill I'm very torn
on I can jump either side of the
line very easily dollars in the
more thank you.
Thank you before you go to
Senator guy it goes I wanted to
ask Senator bonded so you're
gonna have questions.
I do not okay thank you and
Senator Gonzales says you have
you seen the analysis that are
committee analysts provided.
Madam chair yes okay and this
bill Committee members does go
on to Judiciary so Senator
Gaydos your next.
Thank you and I apologize I had
two laptops an iPad and my
iPhone and could not get on his
own for a while but I appreciate
the discussion we're having day
I want to start my first
question for Center Gonzales
Mr Johnson to talk about posing
opposition to this be a part of
the
verbiage in the bill could you
tell me who's in opposition and
who help you with writing
drafting of the wording.
Madam chair of.
You want to go ahead Jessica.
Our sure and madam chair and
senator guy it goes
I I guess you know I I didn't
intend to say that you know
there were there was off
position helping to right and
word Smith the bill when I when
I I thought I said what I meant
to say is that you know in the
development of the bill and
there has been a very serious
effort to
Consider the arguments made by
by the opposition and you know
that would include things like.
The fact that this this doesn't
apply to private land you know
that the bill and and and it was
it was conceived of before it
might my time at at the
innovation and working on this
but my understanding is that you
know the first thought was that
this should apply statewide and
then you know after gathering
feedback that bill was narrowed
to only public land you know all
the exceptions that are listed
in the bill you know if you had
an opportunity to look at the.
Arizona and Colorado versions of
similar legislation
there are and several more
exceptions written into the bill
here compared to those other
states.
including the allowance of
department of game and fish to
use as nonlethal that traps and
snares to deal with depredation
complaints that's something that
isn't permitted by the band's
naked in our neighboring states
you know as well as the
exception related to at enrolled
members of Indian nations tribes
and pueblos I mean that is
something that I'm not aware of
of other states that have
adopted this into their at a
trapping lawn but it felt like
something that was unique to New
Mexico and and important for us
to consider and the development
of the bill so there's you know
there's things like that and and
and and other things that of
state the development of this
legislation you know we also at
you know myself personally and
many of the proponents of this
bill were involved and those
stakeholder meetings
that were run by the department
of game fish that eventually led
to you know regulations that
That we you know suspected might
not be effective and and it you
know I think that the facts have
had.
One that out but they haven't
been effective but it you know
in in listening to all of the
stakeholders in those meetings I
mean all of that has kind of
helped and feed into the nuances
of this legislation.
Thank you for that madam chair
Senator Gonzales and Mr Johnson
I guess my my hopes for the
Valencia said that since the
professionals on wildlife
management our our department
game and fish that they would've
been an active part of drafting
this legislation and one of
them to sort of give me a little
bit of heartburn is you'd stated
earlier that in November this
actual though on the we passed
prior it gone into effect so
it's only been in three months
and and I'm having a hard time
well we passed legislation is
usually for longer term.
A value than three more months
and I was wondering how your
numbers because of aspirational
while at specially the Sandia's
were you getting your numbers of
the infants there and is it
documented through the
department of game fish.
At madam chair and senator
guiding us thank you for those
questions I'm first of all just
clarify that the exception in
the bill that allows for the
department of game and fish to
use non lethal traps and snares
to react and Representative and
respond to nuisance and
depredation complaints that did
come directly from the
department so in you know in
years past they they actually
have
really fed directly into the
bill
we also reached out to them and
had a brief meeting this fall
and in advance of this
legislation on this year
The at the incidents that are we
talk about our we gather them
through a our coalition that we
are part of call trapped renew
Mexico we have a website it's
not you know terribly fancy or
well promoted website
at because coalition of
nonprofits but it is available
and it it seems to pass through
word of mouth
so we by no means believe that
we are able to that that that we
receive and track every incident
that takes place
but we do receive some and it
and it has grown up particularly
this year compared to last
year's on the department of game
and fish does not collect
data from trappers about the
number of non target animals
that they catch in their tracks
when we hear about incidences we
always encourage people to
contact game and fish in order
to report on the device and the
incident so that they can
investigate but the department
does not regularly publish and
nor the nor do they ask trappers
to report no target captures.
Thank you for that madam chair
and senator Gonzalez Mr Johnson
and and that's what I guess I
would ask that you would make
sure that they do
at least notify game fish
because that they currently do
not show the setting is having a
problem and one of things
earlier on Mr Johnson you said
that it was a seventy five foot
setback I understand it's a half
mile set back from the from one
walkways am I correct in that.
madam chair and senator Gallegos
I'm trying to pull it up quickly
just to double check but I do
believe that the setback for
trails is seventy five feet
there are other things for
instance trail heads where the
setback of larger it is a half
mile
so actually yeah I may have left
that out of of my summary so
there was a slight increase in
the setback from trail heads and
picnic areas things like that.
I I'm sorry and was there
another part of the question
that I missed no and and I was
just trying to make that
distinction because I understand
it's for the seventy seventy
five and I you know with them
saying they didn't have any
problems with the the sandy as I
know
Dr Schmidt is was having a
really hard time because that's
part of his constituency I live
in southeastern Mexico we don't
have that many.
L. hands or or walking trails
what we we have a lot of ranch
land in there that we're we're
really dependent on a wildlife
management I did just want to
tell you earlier on Mr chairman
Madam chair Senator Gonzales Mr
Johnson had made a comment about
the other states and their
wildlife practices I'm just now
sold the ranch in Colorado it's
been in my family since eighteen
thirty three and to tell you
their numbers there they given
us mature line would be one meal
dear per week.
And to me that's pretty
extensive well we raised
Appaloosa horses and we kept
them corralled in the evenings
and night just so we can manage
the wildlife issues up isn't
there hi dollars highly valued
and.
but I just wanted to let you
know that I think the Mexico has
better a program the Colorado
does living in are having
properties in both states the
other thing I wanted to bring up
Madam chair in Senator Gonzales
and Mr Johnson is the way I read
this we want to go through
or to support a predator control
environment where we're not
trapping we're letting the
predators take care of the
sick the maimed and or any any
Population growth is that the
premise of this take with traps
so that way we we left the
predators in a while take care
of the the growth issues with
the correct statement.
Madam chair all Senator Senator
the eagles so.
let me start off with the
Jessica can that more well
there's more to that than that
you know you also have the the
human part you know it's a
safety issue let us so we
mentioned and also with our
state going more into the open
door recreation and economic
development in this it was
mentioned you know we have all
more individuals doing the
outdoor in fact the number that
I have I think it has like
seventy percent of New Mexicans
are taking advantage of outdoor
so that's one part and then also
you know what we're looking at
you know the control so while
you know I just wanted to to see
that part also so maybe Jessica
can answer the other part.
Thank you madam chair and
senator I goes
You know I would agree with
Senator Gonzales and you know
and also
to harken back to Senator
McKenna as opening statements
you know when we're looking at
addressing trapping on the
tracks near the poisons on
public lands this bill is is
focused on where there is an
amalgamation of of problems so
that that includes you know the
unfettered take of
of for bearing species
as well as you know the
prospects for outdoor recreation
and tourism economies and public
safety and you know the injury
rates of at that these devices
because
Yeah maybe I'll tell me that and
I can
Again more specifically if
needed.
Thank you thank you.
Madam chair Senators almost and
and the reason I brought that up
and just give you some
understanding I know that the
long legal program in Marion
County California it was in
effect for fifteen years then
fifteen year is deemed a pager
because it did not to what it
was asked to do and those three
were per pre peer review and I
just wondered if that's not the
same road we're going to try to
go to go down I would rather
learn from their mistakes in
California and not to redo this
year but I just wondered if you
heard that from California.
At madam chair and senator gray
goes now you know I I haven't
followed too much about
California just because they're
so different I'm New Mexico you
know right one thing that I am
aware of here in New Mexico is
that it was several years ago I
think in the mid two thousands
are with multi year campaign
maybe for an executed by the
department of game and fish to
trap and kill as many
communities as possible and to
increase dear Fund survival and
and it particularly concentrated
area of the state and after some
years and I think hundreds of
thousands of dollars spent date
cancel that program because it
was not successful so I think
you know we have plenty of
evidence to look at here on the
ground in in New Mexico you know
and I think it's also important
to look at.
What we're talking about very
bearing species we're not
necessarily just talking about
carnivore species that tend to
that that tend to be you know
maybe some of the animals that
take livestock so the second
most commonly
as and traps species in New
Mexico is that Scott give you
group all of the subspecies of
skunk together.
depredation rates on public
lands and I believe are are
minimal to nil
next we're looking at gray foxes
at you know little town faxes
that I think maybe at most are
big enough to maybe take down
small poultry but most poultry
is is private land rather than
public land so that wouldn't be
an issue either bobcat even
bobcats there are you know ours
some small instances of bobcats
taking down calve and but by and
more and more you know not a day
and part of the degradation for.
Keep on popping Johnson you are
going in and out so could you
wrap up your comment please.
I can and there I just got a
notification that my internet is
on stable so the the point that
I was making I guess it is just
that you know I trapping self
isn't that necessarily targeted
at carnivores
that.
Thank you.
Madam chair and represent
themselves school ask you so
when she brought up the skunks
and and just going back she's
been talking about Mr Johnson's
been talking about problem areas
and you know I can I can for see
that as the Sandia's whether a
lot of people are in as you said
Senator earlier you know we've
gone outdoor more and more but I
know in in our area we're still
trapping of skunks because they
they become a nuisance.
Does this bill.
Fact that if you're in a in a
community and you're actually
trying to get rid of skunks in
your area does this bill of
prohibit me from doing that.
Madam chair representative
bagels we would not because you
know you're going to two private
property.
We.
Senator I appreciate that but
usually I put in the alleyway
again our alley which city
property is they don't come to
my house to come to our
dumpsters and they they're
parked in city she right away
but I just can see some problems
with that I did have just
another question earlier Mr
Johnson to talk chair and
senator about the coyote issues
that the work from a few years
ago and I understand the fishing
game do not have authority over
that is that.
I guess in this bill here is
that trying to fix some of the
power problems a statewide to it
you know
The technopop relation I think
if you stop trapping
of you you start allowing them
to over populate in your hope
for the predators take care of
each other has that been
discussed as far part of this
bill what it will do the coyote
population.
Madam chair Jessica you'll
respond.
Yeah
we just got.
And madam chair senator guiding
us your.
That the department does not
manage priorities that's a
protected species they undertook
that trapping program focused on
restoring your populations which
it did not successfully do.
Okay you're welcome thank you
for that in and that leads me to
my next question I know I
noticed in the bill it has a
penalty for the use of traps and
I'm wondering.
Madam chair senator maybe Mr
Johnson's since departments not
here do we ever pay for losses
to ranked farmer
all.
I bet it's going to get up.
Apologize.
But do we ever pay for losses to
the rapture farmers.
Lucia last madam chair all I'm
not aware of that maybe call
Jessica might have different
information.
At I'm sure Senator Gallegos and
it and we we do in certain
circumstances.
Hello.
Yes if you turn off your picture
we will still have your sound.
And I'll be stronger.
The better yes please repeat
your answer.
I'm there was at I believe we do
and in certain circumstances
there are other laws that set.
Okay and.
And Senator.
And just Mr Johnson I appreciate
that I just to me in a parent of
slaying if we're gonna start
charging people for trying to.
protect themselves from
Annals we ought to be able to
reimburse them I have I still
have a really hard time
understanding why the department
of game and fish aren't large
lead in this even in the
discussion today I know they are
on earlier but it's just one of
those were they are four forty
on.
If you want to use Dr Schmidt
these discussion points the
science behind animal
how we how we deal with our
wildlife New Mexico but with
that all yield thank you madam
chair thank you Senator Gonzales
Mister Johnson.
Thank you so much for that at
healthy discussion of our
analysts did bring up some
issues that I think probably
Senate judiciary will look at if
it needs some cleanup so what is
the pleasure of the committee.
And move the do passed Senator
Lopez handout please go ahead
Senator.
I'm just gonna do the same thing
I'm moving to pass
thank you and
Senator.
I'm sure I'd like to table to we
can have the department
interject on what they would
like now with this bill because
it will directly affect them
okay so it's a tabling motion
it's not debatable and there
shouldn't have been discussion
with the tabling motion
so Branik at please call the
vote on the tabling motion.
The.
Yes.
Senator Neville.
Yes.
No.
No.
Senator Sedillo.
No.
Chair.
Now.
It is seven two.
Seven into yes.
So we're back on Senator pokes
motion is there a second.
I second okay one.
Senator ham on the seconded is
there was another person who
spoke up okay so Veronica could
you please call the vote roll on
and do passed motion made by
Senator pope seconded by Senator
Hamblen.
Amanda as Amanda.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Senator.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
In terms.
Yes.
Seven yes to.
Thank you very much Senator
Gonzales on the Senator of
McKenna you have a due pass as
amended thank you very much for
being with us what we thank you
so we're now going to Senate
bill sixty seven this nobody's
for clean energy generation by
Senator sold.
But.
One second Trevor would you
please let everybody in the
waiting room are from the
waiting room on to the screen
who signed up this to testify.
Our Senate bill six.
Yes madam chair.
So sorry.
Thank you madam chair.
Changes real we are living in
the New World now and we have
renewable energy sources that
are economically viable that are
rapidly becoming better and we
need to make sure you New Mexico
that we are in position to take
advantage of the wonderful
renewable energy sources that we
have of New Mexico is listed as
the second best area for solar
resources right yes I the second
best for solar and we're like
fourth or fifth best for wind
energy we have barely begun to
tap that market we saw two years
ago when we asked the Arab.
Energy transition or the.
I get things all missed next
mixed up here but the.
The big ET a bill that we have
some also fuel plants that are
not fully depreciated by the
utilities and as a result we had
a huge
Amount of money that had to be
covered through securitization
when that that had to be re or
is being retired prior to its
useful life.
This bill very simply what it
does is when utilities are
looking at building new and
replacement generation that you
cannot would be impossible fuel
generation anymore there is no
need for the wind energy is the
cheapest energy in the country
it comes off of the wind powers
that under two cents a kilowatt
hour most of the wind energy in
New Mexico is sold in California
and is not used in New Mexico
of energy from the sun solar
energy is only slightly more
expensive than when the Energy
also fuel energy is expensive we
now also have a substantial
programs for battery storage and
what this bill does is you
cannot build a new gas
generating plant to port new and
replacement energy it is more
expensive and typically aghast
generation plant has a useful
wipe of about thirty years and
with the Energy transitioned Act
by twenty forty we are supposed
to have eighty percent renewable
energy about twenty forty five a
hundred percent clean energy.
If we were to allow a new gas
generation plant the come on now
it would be obsolete in the
state of New Mexico in less than
twenty years before it is been
only depreciated and us fully
paid for what this bill simply
does is any new and replacement
generation must be from clean
sources we don't want to have to
purposely would be a new gas
generation that is going to have
to be securitized when it
becomes obsolete parts useful
like this up and for the most
part that's essentially what
this bill does we've got plenty
of replacement sources that are
not the dirty fossil fuels in
your packets the PRC their
analysis is inaccurate and wrong
it is based on if these plants
were being put Indian twenty in
the year two thousand and would
have a full thirty year useful
life which would be prior to
when the state has indicated
that we must be from renewable
sources and so that analysis is
inaccurate is at least ten to
twenty years out of date or what
would happen as far as the cost
of putting in new gas generation
or other types of generation and
with that madam chair I would
stand for questions.
Thank you.
You have listed
Jacob Baca as eight expert
witness.
Okay I didn't.
That I listed Jacob Baca as an
expert witness.
I mean if he's not your expert
witness for not recognizing.
And madam chair I had not talked
with him directly about about
that you may be on or be able to
provide some expertise at
sometime in the future but yeah
I I'm not sure that I needed and
the expert at this point okay
thank you we're going to the
opponents first and I actually
see
a couple people on so let's see
let's start with might be
Antonio.
Our men and men and I have
please.
County L..
You still connecting to
audiences okay now while we're
waiting for him I have a
Bernalillo treat.
He's on so Bernalillo you want
to go ahead.
Yes madam chair and members of
the committee.
I I work with Mike d'antonio and
he's actually having to make
comments over on the at the
house energy committee right
that as as we speak and so madam
chair and and sponsor of the
bill Senator souls we stand in
opposition.
Xcel energy as it is today as a
leader.
In in re renewable read
resources but
We we do we are concerned with
the reliability issues right now
when a replacement generation
sources are solely hands on
renewable.
I think that we are our.
Are hinging our budget on some
renewable equipment.
And
That's not that's not quite
developed yet are here yet and
so with that and we will always
stand in in readiness to work
with the sponsor on further
development thank you ma'am.
Thank you okay we're next to
Kevin Greenwald.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Kevin
Raul Walt.
And.
I'm here on behalf of the CEO of
the New Mexico role like to
cooperate Association.
And a couple of points on this
We have to stand in opposition
this bill for public reasons I'm
as we move forward towards
clean energy world.
Hey right now is that the
technology available for hundred
percent clean energy and go
forward I believe we're going to
have to have renewable energy
our other than renewable energy
resource.
So I think the other thing it
will do going forward I think we
have to have
Some some national natural gas.
And we're gonna have to
have
that ability going forward and I
think it's just going to drive
natural gas plant development
across borders in other states
thank you.
Thank you very much Nancy
Martinez.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is
Vince Martinez the government
relations adviser for tri state
generation and transmission
association.
try states a not for profit
cooperative that provides
electric generation transmission
forty to rural electric
cooperatives in four states
which in turn service serves
more than one million and use.
Electricity customers over more
than two hundred thousand square
miles of west and through our
responsible energy plan which we
announced in January of twenty
twenty we are committed to
working with a cooperative
members to provide reliable four
siblings Energy in accordance
with our democratic cooperative
principles.
By twenty twenty for more than
fifty percent of the Energy
tristate delivers to its members
and owners will be from
renewable sources that's six
years earlier than the ATA
mandate.
we stand in support of our the
statewide association our
members in opposition to this
bill simply because we're we're
you are concerned that a bill
like this could drive a future
generation out of state
therefore the Mexico's in those
revenue thank you madam chair
thank you members of the
committee.
Thank you okay do is Mike
d'antonio on.
Thanks connecting the audio.
Senator I think
then that might within another
committee right now.
Okay well it's showing up on our
screen though growth.
Okay I'm.
I have next is current calendar
on.
Is Matt how our meal.
Is Ricardo Gonzalez.
Shares are shall be beset
Romero.
Carlos Sonntag.
There are.
Okay go ahead Carla thank you
very much madam chair committee
members I'm Carla Sonntag's
president of the New Mexico
business coalition in N. B. C.
represents hundreds of
businesses and thousands of New
Mexicans across the state our
focus.
Is to make New Mexico a better
place to do business so that New
Mexicans have jobs and can
provide for their families.
We respectfully oppose Senate
bill sixty seven.
Because we feel that it's going
to cause electric rates to go up
significantly in turn that's
going to cost harm to our hard
working New Mexican families who
are already struggling to pay
electric bills and feed their
families.
We feel that it is really
misguided.
In the eliminating nuclear
energy from the portfolio which
is a very clean energy I would
encourage members to find out
more about the poverty where we
get our energy really is a good
source
in addition when we limit
natural gas which is a very
clean burning fuel we're also
limiting more jobs good paying
jobs in the state and we need
that as a backup source of
energy for our homes and our
businesses and it's for these
reasons that we respectfully
oppose this bill thank you for
your time consideration.
You so much
we heard from for opponents
let's go to the pre proponents
are and I still see my the
attorney's name but no.
Connection okay so let's move
over
Cynthia hall I'm gonna recognize
you first.
As a proponent.
Thank you madam chair
Our agency submitted at FIR on
this bill and.
I'm sorry could you.
Everybody
or as a commissioner.
Can you hear me yes.
Okay.
So our agency submitted an FIR
on this bill and I I was
concerned that there were some
inaccuracies that I just wanted
to address
Well as I read it states that
facilities constructed for new
or replacement energy generation
capacity shall only generate
clean energy so since they're
building construction I think
whatever is being talked about
here is new at New Mexico newly
constructed facilities
And R. F. I. R. there's a
statement that says as a
consequence of the bill electric
utilities and the PRC would no
longer be able to consider New
natural gas fired or nuclear
generation and the analysis and
development of.
Most cost effective portfolio
And that is also says that the
F. I. R. reflects the.
Here's the staff analysis
consistent with commission
policy rules and precedent so
our policy is to
Follow and enforce the energy
transition act and we have a
recent precedent in a case we
decided a few weeks ago that I
think will shed a little light
on this statement about no
longer be able to consider new
natural gas fired plants
We were requested to approve a
new natural gas plant being
built by southwest prior
service.
And pursuant to the language in
the ETA that requires that
utility companies I am stepstone
retail in New Mexico have to
make
reasonable and consistent
progress toward the goals of the
energy transition act which are
to reach eighty percent
renewable energy by twenty forty
and a hundred percent clean
energy by twenty forty five
on that basis we denied
approving that
we do not a new gas plants
because gas plants in that case
it is I'm forgetting its exact
lifespan that was predicted but
they want and the company wanted
to be able to amortize it over
forty years and the energy
transition act requires that
we're at clean energy
Representative clean energy in
twenty five years so there was
no way
that the costs of investing in
that plan could have been
recouped within the time frame
demanded by our energy
transition act to reach a
hundred percent clean energy
I think that case is sort of a
bellwether right it would be
hard to imagine a circumstance
where
Yes it would be proposed unless
it's very small really doesn't
cost much and they're not very
effective that way
and we would approve that going
forward so with respect I'm and
I'm not making any decisions
about future cases of course
there is always a possibility
that a new gas plant can be
proposed it has.
Our car capture storage
technology for example that is
cost effective at in that case
we would you know that I have a
very different outcome and we
have to look at cases case by
case obviously but I wanted to
make the committee aware that
that is a precedent and that is
our policy to follow the Energy
transitioned Act and it's
certainly its application in
that case certainly did not lead
to
a realistic opportunity for New.
New gas plant to be
Milt.
With respect to new generation I
don't think the bill is talking
about new nuclear generation
well.
And so I don't think that's
that's relevant my uncle I work
for him and he asks often on his
pistol that he has with you all
are going goes you're not on
mute.
She
call could you revenue please.
I yes there's one other
statement in our entire as as
the the bill cannot apply to the
construction of generation
facilities located outside of
New Mexico which serve retail
customers in New Mexico that's
actually not true either
well
the bill can apply
to the extent it affects our
decisions and our decisions in
that case I was just telling you
about actually applying to a.
That the gas plant was proposed
was being built in Texas the
Texas choose had already
approved it
But we disapproved it and the
effect of that is that it will
be put into the company's rates
that they charge here in New
Mexico and we will be paying for
it so I think the bill
adequately covers ratepayers in
our state even as about if a
plant is being built outside
state so that's all I have.
You so much for joining us today
the opportunity certainly our
band Shelton your next.
Thank you madam chair members my
name is Ben Shelton on the
political and policy director of
conservation voters New Mexico I
want to acknowledge the level of
discomfort that we heard from
some of our utility in coop
partners on this on this bill
and I would offered that the
that the climate crisis in the
moment we're in requires little
discomfort require some
significant steps noted to the
store flex that we also want to
highlight that the PRC has
already speak out begun moving
in this direction the
replacement portfolio in the
replacement plan around the San
Juan generating stations banning
capacity the PRC uprooted
portfolio the most entirely
consisting of solar energy and
storage I'm in creasing amount
of it located in the in the
impact to community so that I
think that we have some data
points that this is doable and
this is doable now based on the
way the PRC has been regulating
so that utilities
it into the need to drastically
reduce carbon emissions and
climate pollutants very very
quickly.
We're also concerned that guests
and vestments today are going to
be stranded assets of tomorrow
on the PRC will be looking at
ways to mitigate noncompetitive
gas assets in as little as ten
years I think that you look at
the energy market today the
cheapest kilowatt hour that
there is available is renewable
kilowatt hour and ultimately
that is going to do what's going
to drive adoption was going to
drive the market.
Additionally this is something
we think you can drive in the
state investment we're seeing
significant investments for PNM
and others all across the state
renewable energy renewable
energy infrastructure which will
drive jobs in energy generation
back in state out for away from
out of state sources look at how
very plan others so for all
those reasons we support the
bill and the sponsor for
bringing thank you madam chair.
Thank you
it is Larry hearing on.
It is Jacob Baca on.
Okay the supporters that I had
so
Etcetera so did you want to
respond before we go to
questions and comments from
committee.
Yes thank you madam chair one of
the things I've been up here
I've learned is there is no
truth police people are able to
say anything they want
regardless of whether it's true
or accurate a couple of things
and it that's very important in
this bill this bill does not
require any utility to close
down a currently functioning gas
power plant it does require the
utility to currently closed down
any coal fired power plants it
doesn't require anyone to change
anything with nuclear energy
that's currently online the only
thing that this does is you
cannot build New Hope fire or
gas fired power plants it
doesn't require them to take any
offline the the biggest thing
that this does is it prevents us
from having stranded assets into
the future by putting in a new
generation of just very quickly
madam chair New weddings make
their money on a depreciated
assets they want to buy brand
new fancy all the bells and
whistles gas plants because
that's a new strand a new asset
that they have that they get to
recover profit off of that and
depreciated asset when there are
currently functioning gas plants
that are fully depreciated that
are still functional those will
continue into the future as we
make the transition as required
by the Energy transitioned Act
everyone recognizes that gas is
going to we important over the
next ten to fifteen years as
we're making those transitions
you just can't quit on any brand
new.
Our carbon based fuel plants
through this bill it all has to
be renewable for all of the new
generation it doesn't require
any old generation to be taken
off line through this but this
bill thank you madam chair thank
you okay so committee members
it's eleven twenty seven three
members are required to be in a
meeting at noon Senator Fontana
Senator of souls and myself so
let's see if we can take
questions comments discussion
and a vote in the next thirty
two minutes so Senator Nobel and
then Senators committees.
Thank you madam chair
Just a quick.
Few questions
Sounds like under PRC's rules
the likelihood of a new plant is
fairly fairly unlikely unless
it's shortage being cost
recovered in the time frame
allowed by the EPA that I'm not
sure about that.
Anyway
The ETA provided a number of off
ramps as I recall in the the act
that the utilities are not able
to or the state was not able to.
Reach the PGA goals etcetera is
that not true.
Senator souls doesn't ETA have
some provisions were they can
flex a little bit almost goal
members.
Madam chair and senator yeah
this really isn't about the AGA
I don't know the details as far
as those types of things but
this is trying to support the
PTA in that we are making
progress toward that not just
saying well it's gonna be too
hard to we're not going to try.
I understand it's not this isn't
specifically about the ETA but
if if the ETA you would permit a
new plant for some reason they
need to the current plants
obsolete they need to build a
number the company as of the
amendment or whoever.
Excuse me excuse me.
I think that there's some
provisions of the J. that would
allow that to it would be up to
PRC make that determination is
all of us to make
What about purchases of power
from out of state it's been
brought up a couple times off
the grid market to purchases
how would this affect that.
Madam chair and senator it only
applies to new and replacement
energy generation capacity and
so yeah we for ones that are
specifically it's through the
abilities and into New Mexico
that the power being generated
for New Mexico for any new
replacement must be from clean
sources.
They could still purchase a
utility could purchase
PNM could go on the market and
stuff by team kilowatts of power
just off the grid no matter
working with this wind or solar
and natural gas otherwise is
that is that not true.
Chair and senator I I think the
point of this is if occasionally
the last generation that
provides the backup for the
solar and wind and everybody
talks about when the sun is not
shining and the wind is not
blowing and if they're suddenly
is a peak in the the gas
generation can't beat that yes
the utilities would be buying
energy from whatever source on
the open market it might be
quite expensive for the couple
of hours a year that that would
be that still is cheaper than
putting a brand new plant with
all the bells and whistles on it
that we are paying for all the
time.
This is what this only apply to
regulated.
The public utilities would apply
say for example municipal
utilities that are not regulated
by the PRC.
Madam chair and senator Munoz
that would be for any generation
in the state of New Mexico.
So if city of Farmington which
has their own utility wanted to
build a plant of they would not
be allowed to do that.
Madam chair and senator Munoz
says might my intent.
Okay that's problematic I think
because for them to build a wind
farm there may not be cost
effective I don't know
One of the things you mentioned
that the cost of renewables is
is cheap it is because totally
subsidized does any taxes so
that certainly I don't know that
we know what the cost.
Renewables is.
It's probably not as near as
cheap as what we think we
advertise it is because battery
costs and so forth not fully
known at this point.
I think the lady from the PRC
mentioned building new plants
wasn't probable but on the other
hand there are eight there's a
facility that's known as a
peaker plants basically jet
engine with the generator on the
other end of it those are cheap
to build and they use those
whenever there's a when the wind
doesn't blow and those are
relatively cheap I don't know if
they have a long lifespan thank
you probably with
Those kind of plans
reproductions well probably
accurate I'm chair and senator
any that they currently have are
allowed to continue operating of
that is typically what the
utility is used for getting the
peaks that are not covered
necessarily by whatever the
renewable on their system would
be those are still allowed if
they have them you could not buy
additional yes Sir.
I'm talking about a new plant of
the what they call a peaker
plant another engineer so I
don't know how they work
accepted it's a great relatively
cheap low cost way of building a
natural gas plant it's only used
in the results loan in the the
load on the line coal plant goes
goes down to the wind which for
whatever it is to.
Okay
The my biggest concern is that I
think from our standpoint
locally in my district the
regulated
Utilities is one thing that
whenever if you talk about the
and regulated utilities would
there be any provision that we
are any possibility we could
look at some kind of amendments
take the.
The Los Alamos's in the far
regions in the city of as
checks.
Those kind of facilities that
operate their own utility take
them out I don't know if they
would ever want to build a new
plant but on the other they
probably mostly by off the grid
but if they don't have the
capacity to generate funds like
selves as a generator of any
kind but the.
It's conceivable they might want
to invest in one the thing that
concerns me most of all is the
on regulated utilities out there
may not do it that's all my
questions madam chair thank you.
Thank you very much next we have
Senator on case.
Thank you madam chair chair I
hope you'll forgive me for not
having a video camera with me
just a moment but I just have a
few thoughts I appreciate Center
song we work together quite a
bit on the DA in years past we
trying to do here the bill seems
really simple but we seem to be.
A couple of things that probably
requires Memphis's number one.
Bill would preclude any reliance
on so on nuclear energy and I
know we're not contemplating
that there doesn't seem to be
in the foreseeable future but
but I I'm correct about that too
Senators older Americans talk
about about coal and gas fired
but would also preclude any sort
of a nuclear reliance that trip.
At this point the it does not
matter madam chair and senator
it does not require us to get
rid of any of the assets that we
are getting from Palo Verde
which is the nuclear plant in
this area it does not talk about
a new small of nuclear plants or
things of that sort that might
be coming online in the future
if that were the case and and
typically people the the nuclear
is very different it's
considered clean energy but not
renewable energy.
Well I appreciate that I I agree
that will have family the bill
says that any new generation has
to be clean energy and defines
what clean energy is and it does
not include a nuclear that lists
of because I I think that if we
were to drop the bill we would
be leaving that out as an option
we would be precluded that as an
option we we intend to do that
we should at least do so no way.
the other question I have is
that the bill makes itself apple
any facilities for what is
called the term uses new or
replacement energy and I'm just
wondering do you know Senator is
that term what is new or
replacement energy's edit
defined term in the public
utility act those were saying
for saying that has to be clean
energy in which you were
replacement energy I just wanted
to we have a clear understanding
of what is new or replacement
energy someplace.
Madam chair and and senator I do
not know that that has a clear
definition of new or replacement
generation I think through the
words it's relatively clear to
me but lawyers certainly
interpret words differently.
Well I appreciate that that was
you said that finally so that
was good.
But of course we do and and if
that's going to be you know that
we we know this all of these
things get litigated and so my
goal always on this committee
and and everything that I do my
work is to try to be as precise
as possible so we're saying
we're putting restrictions and
limitations on what is new or
replacement energy but we don't
define what is your replacement
energy and I I think that that
would inevitably lead to
litigation what was what when
somebody does something is that
new or replacement I don't know
maybe or maybe not I think I
think you're your bill would
benefit a lot from a clear
understanding of what it is
we're going to be restricting or
limiting with that without that
then the last thing is I I just
think that I am compelled to do
this we're always talk about the
ETA it's with one of the great
myths of the last couple years
the press reports it repeatedly
and accurately consistently
which is the ETA requires
renewable standards by certain
year a certain percentage this
is not true and we should be
honest about it the ETA has
goals and targets there are no
consequences in the GA there is
so so the non attainment of any
of those percentages are in
those walls has absolutely no
consequence it is it is
effectively on those terms is it
aspirational document it's a
good aspiration we should be
proud of it we should be proud
of New Mexicos we role I but the
notion that we have presenters
and the press the media always
talk about the EPA requirements
review will it's just a myth
okay and and anyone who invest
the time to go read it will
realize that those percentages
those states have no consequence
for non attainment we should we
should always accept and adopt
that and if we want to be
serious about this page but
meaningful requirements with
consequence thank you madam
chair.
Thank you senator serve on case
Next I have Senators
communities.
And I see a young Senator.
Senator built a picture photo
it's a little younger.
I'm scrolling all right now to
see a.
During my high school graduation
madam chair I was actually
looking for a little younger
would have.
Are you implying I don't look
young anymore.
Make sure you.
Thank you madam chair and I Hey
realize the time constraint here
for folks just
Senator huh I'm people asking
questions about nuclear I'm
still not I've been listening
but I'm still not understanding
it with this with this out long
and nuclear power plant being
built in New Mexico or or not.
And madam chair bill indicates
it's clean energy and typically
clean energy includes nuclear
now the specifics we have on
there do not currently have that
I envision that if there was a
need if there were small
what I'm trying to get the right
thing but that the small
portable reactor type things a
very small energy generation or
the story on small generators
and reactors were to come online
it would be a relatively easy
fix in the future to add those
to the on page one the of the
things that would count as clean
energy nuclear typically helps
as clean energy not as we do
Energy and so the fact that it's
not on there currently would not
allow it but it's that easy fix
if that becomes into the future
as this comes in in ten or
fifteen years as we're trying to
be a hundred percent
requirement.
Okay.
I think I understand
I I just I you know I think that
the obviously there is I mean
there's a lot of partisanship
over this issue
as we all know and you know my
my definition of clean energy I
I don't think meets you know I
don't think we agree on the
definition and so it's hard to
to move forward you know I I
have raised concerns about what
wind and solar is doing to the
environment you know what is the
price we pay to reduce carbon
emissions and I you know so for
me and I'm I'm kind of like well
how are those clean our those
renewable when we're when we are
see you know subsidizing of
foreign extractive industries a
lot of these things and and I'm
not going to get into the weeds
there but with the rare earth
minerals and the ability to get
them is not not really renewable
some of the minerals are are
pseudo renewable or they're very
very very abundant where we
never run out some of them are
not and so I think well how is
that how do you get the count
years as renewable and how do we
get the count nuclear is clean
but not renewable etcetera and
and so I I think I would just
and then and then lastly I I
just echo the the price the the
the economics of this and I echo
Senate bills Madam I mean it
this we talk about man made
climate change but what about
then maybe prices I mean what
what are the cost if you took
away regulations from oil and
gas and use it your introduced
more regulation into solar and
wind and water the organic
prices of these energy sources
and which leads me back to
nuclear where that is from a
physics and scientific
standpoint is going to be your
most efficient fuel supplies so
if we surround ourselves with
artificial.
Price changing I I don't know if
we can just say I mean I
respectfully disagree and say I
don't know if we can disable
this is cheap and not I mean one
of the reasons that the prices
in first solar in in California
went negative well you can't get
much cheaper than a negative
price Bridenstine's gonna pay
you to take their energy well
the reason was because the the
the grid was was so you know.
Up and down so so I I don't know
if it is I would just
respectfully disagree on the on
the prices you issues and then
lastly just a comment for
baseload I you know we need to
be careful about protecting us
reliable baseload and I you know
to your point about.
When wind and solar wouldn't be
able to supply it you know our
critical industries like the
hospital industry and and those
sorts of things so for those
reasons I do stand respectful
opposition to the bill I think
we we just could not disagree
more on its however I think the
room for common ground is to
just look scientifically at our
environment how are we
protecting our environment
holistically and I I look very
very forward I look forward very
much to continuing those
discussions with the committee
and other pieces of legislation
but thank you Sir.
Thank you senator Ortiz I have
Senator Gallegos next.
Chair thank you and I do know
that we are on timeline so madam
chair and senator I I just have
a few questions in in having a
discussion with
Jim Winchester from independent
petroleum association I know
they're in opposition to this
but one of his thoughts were was
of the choices for for energy
generation just the free market
portion portion of this with
this.
Bill.
The way we look at it it would
restrict the free market aspect
and knowing that we don't have
good made statement earlier.
Senator that we're ten to
fifteen years out from having to
meet the required with this bill
do you first see it increase not
the pricing on power earlier you
talked about hello it was and
and I think you Center renewable
it said you know that's without
all the add ons for we
more help in the the market to
come stable without the
subsidies do you perceive this
increase in our rates.
Madam chair you know I. could
make up what I perceive things
to be a couple of things that I
know to be true are the cost of
new generation is expensive to
build a new plant of those costs
are borne by the rate payers our
new generation typically has a
useful life of thirty years and
that new generations gonna be
obsolete in ten to fifteen years
which means the rate payers are
going to be paying for that
expensive new generation of
renewable energies are cheaper
initially they are cheaper down
the road they do not have the
fuel costs down where I live el
Paso electric our rates went up
substantially because of the
winter fuel rates went up
substantially you don't have all
right spike with renewable
energy like you do with the oil
and gas generation where you're
constantly buying additional
fuel and so where people put
this in we have not seen spikes
or increases in rates of that
sort and renewable energy as I
indicated it's coming off of the
wind powers here in New Mexico
with under two cents a kilowatt
hour the utilities are not very
interested in buying contracts
from them because they don't own
the asset and utilities make a
profit I only the asset.
Madam chair and senator I
appreciate that you brought up
word obsolete I have heard that
the wind towers have a twenty
five year lifespan is that
correct is that where you would
get the point that that would be
obsolete.
Madam chair I don't know what
the the useful life of a wind
power is a wind towers are easy
to put new blades on the it's
easier to put other things on
the menu and redo it and again
all of the cost of the Energy
coming off of those that is part
of what is factored into their
costs.
Chair and senator in Hobbs we
have winter that exceeded its
twenty five year lifespan it is
upright standing and has no
useful life to it so they
actually have no place to the
oven tear down and dispose of it
because there's none of the
trash or or in the way sites
will take it but I'll leave that
there because I don't I don't
think I'm tricking your mind on
what obsolete is but in our area
madam chair and senator we have
a lot of natural gas plants of
Lee County electric the provides
a lot of the area around Hobbs
said our love into had talked
about a plant that they're
trying to get a couple years ago
and the Lovington area that
because of PRC or requirements
they went over to Texas and
there are currently buying that
power from Texas your plan with
your your bill would not stop
that purchase from across state
lines would it.
And madam chair if the
electricity is to serve New
Mexico then that elector city
would not be eligible to be
counted as part of the Lee
County plant.
For replacement energy.
And I appreciate it madam chair
and senator I see this session
as trying to limit the jobs for
New Mexicans and we lost that
plant to Texas where we have New
Mexicans across the state line
work in Texas because that's
where the workload will go my
last question for you is is
I'm just wondering if you went
back center to talk about the
ten to fifteen years out of for
the requirements of.
I guess I'm afraid that the
technology is not there yet
to to handle this do you know if
we were to do this that the
baseline grant on the grid would
be covered by the wind and solar
that we currently have if you
were not to allow for any new
additions if a plant were having
to shut down for one reason
other rebuild would the solar
and wind be able to offset that
amount to be able to to create
sustainable.
Madam chair and senator this
does allow for battery storage
batteries are the area that is
rapidly increasing and solar
with battery storage is the
cheapest areas and certainly at
the a utility is concerned about
baseload batteries provide
dispatchable energy out of
baseload.
That madam chair center that
brings me to a new question on
the battery storage because I've
not heard that it's gotten to
the point of usable I mean it's
everything I'd heard was in
theory you know what the
megawatts they would be able to
hold right now if this were to
be forced on us.
Right I I do not know and
batteries are scalable and so I
do not know what the megawatts
would be but that is part of
what he Garcia would be engaged
in if a utility is trying to
increase their capacity because
they either have additional
customers they need to be or
because they are choosing to
shut down a plant that no longer
has
House of the ability to to make
them profit off of the
underappreciated asset.
Madam chair and senator I guess
in ten or fifteen years maybe
I'll change my mind but
currently I don't think the
technology is here to offset for
natural gas does for our state
our power grid so
he would Senators Schmidt isn't
well the opposing bill but thank
you for your time thank you for
the discussion Madam are you.
Thank you so much Senator
greater Senator bonded your
hands up.
I'm sorry madam chair should
have figured out thank you okay
thank you.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Thank you thank you madam chair
actually Senator of.
Senators of understood better
job than than me and in talking
about the language I I really
support this bill because I
think it buttresses what we're
trying to do in the state
So with that I will just say
whenever you're ready for motion
I'll make a motion.
Is there any final comments from
the sponsor.
No madam chair I think the the
purpose of this bill is very
clear that if we're going to
build new generation or replace
existing generation it needs to
be recognized the climate crisis
that we have and that we New
Mexico are leading in that area.
Thank you very much Senator
Sedillo Lopez promotion I'm the
past.
Thank you.
And I.
Seconds.
Okay with the secretary please
call the vote rules thank you.
Right.
Thank.
Yes.
No.
Senator pope.
Yes.
Senator so yes.
No.
Yes I thank you I'm sorry
Senator guy.
No matter.
Yes.
Sixty six yes to no okay so
Senator you have a do pass and
it's on to its next committee
which is
Okay.
I thank you very much committee

Thursday morning.
Thank you very much for your
time today nine o'clock thirty
C. thank you.
Thank you to the public as well
Representative spending.
