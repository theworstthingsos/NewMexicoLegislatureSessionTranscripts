Morning madam chair members of

seventy six with the emergency
clause regional hazmat response
volunteer teams was.
In.
Comment to the.
Shortage of those that were
train has not experience to go
into comment.
positive and lightly
Comment.
We're members of the community
where deceased so we talk about
we made it this year in the
sense to.
Allow the individual to.
Evaluate their own based on
their.
Their background and their
experience that wouldn't be
mandatory but at the state could
call upon and individuals
throughout the regions of the
whole state in lieu of our rural
agency and how big our state is
that they could call upon
individuals to assist in the and
when state claim that but kind
of the when we're called out
into the areas for assistance so
that's been the enticement to.
What we've experienced through
COVID in this pandemic.
And I stand for questions.
Thank you it sounds like a dire
situation.
So is Trevor can you ask if
there is any body.
Wanting to speak.
On behalf of this.
We do have anyone saying that.
Okay.
With the show hands is there
anyone who wants to speak on
either side of this bill.
Committee members questions and
discussion.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Me today
your muted center at.
Senator Sedillo Lopez okay thank
you.
Thank you I noticed I notice the
bill basically just insert
exactly we set our regional
launch your response team.
Employees.
May also expenses state or local
government an accent response of
the discretion state director it
seems like a fantastic idea I'm
just wondering is it prohibited
now or or what happens what why
is this bill.
Necessary.
Not a.
With that in a COVID happy and.
What happened in my area was
that we did not have enough
people who we're trained to call
to call upon to assist within
other started to get sick
because they didn't have the
training they kind of went into
the situation without the proper
PP PP and with.
That cause them to also get sick
and then we ended up with the
shortage of
people that were able to respond
and you want you don't want to
put people into that situation
unless to properly train versus
liability so in the response
from the state and you know just
a very different time who would
have thought that we would have
needed.
That in that manner but in the
what still happening I think it
is very important that we do
kind of as the state take that
responsibility
Senator.
Thank you thank you madam chair
absolutely that's why we're say
we hang together and and we
assist each other so the the
second part of your bill the
training officer that is also
extremely crucial okay thank you
madam chair when you're ready
for a motion I'm happy to make
with.
Thank you senator Nobel.
Just quickly madam chair Senator
appropriations that in there I
don't have the bill up and I was
trying to get it request.
According madam chair members of
the committee and senator
Neville on the we already have
some training in different
departments that does take place
I also have another bill
The adversity Network training
that is kind of just going to be
incorporated that it does not
exist also so the department was
willing to take that on
investing it's a very great
initiative they already have
some
Or do have training that state
employees do already go through
so this is just expanding and
making a volunteer and I think
it's a really great initiative
to for people to expand their
resume in that sense if we can
have a certification a company
at thank you senator.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you Senator von case.
Thank you madam chair and
senator I don't bill goes next
to Senate Judiciary Committee so
will will save most of my
comments for their I would ask
you between here in that
committee that give some props
whether this is in the right
place in the state statutes.
I think what you're doing is
important and necessary but
their place that the proposals
being inserted it is then with
the law that relates to
hazardous materials accident
responses and that may not be
aware lawyers or others with
people looking to try and find
law to address the circumstances
I think you're trying to address
your of your look if you're
looking in that in that
sectional law that deals with
hazardous material accidents
this may not be the ideal place
for what your inspection will
spend some time talking about
that thank you madam chair.
Thank you.
I do have a question or comment
and
Before we go to the motion
Senator Pinto would do
volunteers
Consisting of state employees
because a state employee should
be on their own time probably
wouldn't they be covered by
state.
Workers comp and state
liability.
I think that would be a question
in to cooperate to manner of the
state and local governments on
how they handle that I'm not
sure how they exactly handled
COVID and some of the assistance
that was given to our local
governments in that manner so I
suppose we can say soon but
following those lines is what I
have but I can have that look
into.
I don't think I think you should
look into that center because
local governments don't usually
pick up
anything related to state
employees the state government
is pretty particular about when
they will cover state employees
so having served in risk
management I just think that
might be something that should
be clarified
and the reason I bring that up
is that somebody else asked me
to carry.
Our workers comp bill for a
central
employees during the COVID
a pandemic and somebody else is
taking care of that bill but I
think that there's a lot of
questions that happens during
this virus or other incidents
about whose responsibility it
falls to.
Thank you very much for bringing
this to our attention and for
the good work that you're doing
are there any questions before I
go to a motion.
Senator Sedillo Lopez for a
motion.
The past.
The second.
Senator Pirtle seconded Senator
Sedillo Lopez made a motion
we're gonna get it could you
please call the vote.
Disadvantaged yes.
Senator Gallegos.
Yes Senator Neville yes.
Senator poker yes Senator souls.
Committees are yes.
I'm sorry.
Yes thank you.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Yes thank you and defend X. yes
I think that's US eight and one
excuse yes when excuse thank you
senator Shannon Pinto.
You have a unanimous do pass yes
I'm sorry.
Who is Senator this this center
guy goes.
Right I I only got on I was just
wondering what bill disclosed.
This is Senator Shannon Pinto
bill and it is Senate bill two
seventy six would you like to
vote on it.
Can you give me a title yes I'm
working in the dark all our
winter Bender bows and in place
we don't have any power to
welcome to California yes but I
am here
I will explain it in a minute I
went to that Sunday night for
about six hours so I'm very
sorry you're doing it
yes the regional hazmat response
volunteer teams Senator Pinto
indicated that this bill would
allow state employees to
volunteer be trained to assist
when needed
during the virus with
perhaps removing corpses or
moving patients around or
whatever and that but they would
be trained to so we just took a
vote on it.
Was eight two zero would you
excuse but if you would like to
but will at you.
Okay so in some areas yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Senator Pinto congratulations
you have a unanimous do pass
from this committee thank you
very much thank you.
You madam chair yes I'm sorry
Senator Montes Madam chair of
the forty going to the next bill
of eighty six point of personal
privilege yes madam chair the
Senator Gallegos and you're both
referring to power outages in
the I was because my daughter's
forty four Ross what were their
their power is out.
In the I just think that it
might be useful some one time
during this session are
certainly not now during the
interim FOR you madam chair to
lead to some kind of an inquiry
to figure out what happened here
in what we can expect
from PNM about selector gonna
others when one is that is that
what's going on is the ability
companies are purposefully
shutting down power to very
serious to try and deal with
the.
The in addition to ensuring that
the and I think.
With the charge.
Make some enquiries about that.
Your.
I think that is a great idea and
I will not try to schedule a
conversation with this committee
with all the companies to help
with the coops in with the major
utilities to come and just
explain their policies of how to
handle the power surges and the
reasons in the planning it's so
thank you for that suggestion I
appreciate it very much thank
you madam chair it may be
something that warrants some
legislation.
Ultimately what the legislature
to try and decide how they how
they decide who to shut down and
and for how long it center
that's that's kind of attention
question.
Right and you know I'm just on
my point of personal privilege
the area that was affected in
Santa Fe County.
On Sunday night during the zero
whether it was only the rural
area of PNM it was not the urban
area of PNM shut down.
Move on okay so Senator soul
Senate bill one thirteen.
Wiring for photovoltaic systems
Senator souls please.
Thank you madam chair and on
this particular bill there is an
amendment the amendment is is
very important towards the bill
would so I would like to move
the amendment up for discussion
purposes because it matters
greatly as to the the discussion
on the bill.
Okay just a minute let me locate
my amendments.
Trevor could you put it up it is
only one page.
And was sent to all committee
members.
And I would like for you to
explain the amendment before I
have somebody move to adopt.
Yes ma'am the amendment again
this bill was designed to be
essentially all new construction
on homes to be solar ready up
and so it said to have be wired
and as I talked with the
construction industry my entire
body came to be that not all
wiring for solar systems and
houses is the same depend on the
size of the system so instead of
to be wired gets to have one
inch conduit installed in the
walls that's or in the future
when
and installation might be it's
easy to just pull the wiring to
the walls because the low the
poll that to being for it is
already there and so regardless
of the size of the system wanted
conduit would handle the wiring
the other is instead of one
electrical receptacle that there
be two receptacles and it
indicates the size so that they
would provide for fast charging
power for electric vehicles as
we move forward with one
electrical it could be I have
consumed by somebody putting
electric dryer on it or
something like that and this
would ensure that the house is
ready for Evey cars and those
are the the amendments.
Thank you is there a committee
members that would include
option of the amendment.
I've moved adoption madam chair.
Okay is there a second.
Okay so let's have a discussion
first of all is there anybody in
the public.
Who would like to comment just
on the amendment.
Madam chair yes.
Senator Gallegos I've been
getting texts from other people
they're not able to get on due
to power issues well and I had
someone ask there's a chance we
could postpone till we get some
this result.
Thank you Senator Gallegos for
that question since we have the
entire committee here if we have
a quorum lacking I might
postpone but since we have the
entire committee and we know
that these bills are going to a
second committee I believe we
need to continue our list is
very extensive
of bills and these bills are
actually from the first and
second week so we are going to.
Okay and I just to clarify I
know that share Schmidt also
target on it that he had issues
also but I just want to the boys
for public speaking because
they're not able to create
either so thank you.
Thank you and I we finally did
get Senators communities for
about so I know that there is in
and out of.
And.
Excuse me
I did battle the snow for quite
a long time to get here to.
So.
Going back to the amendment is
there anybody in the public who
would like to comment on the
amendment could you raise your
hand.
Madam chair.
Yes.
This is Senators maybe that.
On that I'm calling via phone
and.
I'm and I'm a hard time getting
my New York I'm just trying to
locate the amendment since I
cannot see it on them
it could someone tell us when
exactly it was sent I'm I'm just
trying to filter through my my
email so I can actually look at
the amendment while we're
discussing certainly run again
you want to look that up for you
want me to.
I sent it out yesterday.
Okay well approximately the
time.
I let me check hold on a minute.
That.
Then it was sent
to us and from what I can search
for that thank you madam chair
thank you Frank I have just
running could send the bill the
F. I. R. the amendment and the
committee analysis all together
so if you search for Veronica
and Senate bill one thirteen as
the topic I think she would get
to it.
And madam chair if I might this
bill has been scheduled several
different times and got rolled
over and so the amendments have
been sent out numerous times in
the past.
Okay thank you Senator cells
okay so seeing no comments from
the public on the amendment I do
have some committee members who
would like to comment on the
amendment the first hand that
was Senator von case and then
senator Neville Senator Montes
on the amendment.
Thank you madam chair and the
services of the German that's a
good one important one I I was
gonna have difficulty with your
bill without it you may now
others may know my background
actually in architecture we have
a couple of degrees Mexico
licensed as an architect so I
still have a question no you're
saying your amendment were I am
I think it probably doesn't say
you have to wire because with
the wiring could depend on a lot
of things are but you want to
have conduit which you can be
run so that your your bill would
require conduit from what point
to what point within and
construction.
Madam chair and senator yeah I
think that would be within the
the building codes typically
solar systems are put on the
roof but it could be a ground
mounted in so it could be from
where system might come in from
outside go into the wall either
from the roof or another place
just so that it is already in
the wall the idea is when you
put in the system you don't have
to tear open walls or other
kinds of things are put external
how do it that it's already
there.
Well a madam chair
representative what what I I
have a work with a solar system
before all
data life changing got out of
architecture wanted the law so
so help me to understand.
Can the conduit under your bill
could cut the condo just run
from wherever the solar panels
are located to the circuit box
is that right.
Yes as senator madam chair and
senator typically the circuit
boxes that transformer all of
that it's on the wall in the
garage and so it would probably
get in there and so we would be
con do it from up on the roof
through the wall and come out in
the garage.
And I guess madam chair again
I'm sure a lot of this will be
done regulation but I'm still
trying to figure out why a thing
has been a wall in other words I
assume center I think you told
me you install solar on your
house I'm sure many other people
have can you just run the
conduit from the roof mounted
solar panels along the exterior
of the wall to a meter or two
but why would have to be
anything on the walls.
The chair and senator I think
that's how systems typically are
done when they are retrofitted
that tends to be more difficult
than people off often are
hesitant some people are
hesitant to put on solar because
it'll despoiled the the
architecture of the the lines
the rate the.
The lines of the adobe or other
types of things by doing it
prior to that it's very clear
how to do it and it changes
almost nothing on the book of
all.
Yeah I I just wanna make sure I
I don't have your amendment
Senator I just wanna make sure
that people can do what I
suspect probably ninety percent
of the anybody does when it
comes to retrofitting electrical
it is from conduit on the
exterior rights not as
attractive as running it on the
ensure the walls but we buddy
who
is an older house walked around
the outside you're gonna see
conduit installed on the
exterior walls of your home
setting personal buildings and
so forth so may not be as pretty
but I I just want your not
requiring people to actually go
into the walls.
Unnecessarily and when I I would
just like your strands of that
center and then I'll be done.
Madam chair and senator the
intent of this is so that if
somebody moves in and says I
want to put solar that if it's a
simple and easy way of doing
that and so so I guess that you
certainly could put it on the
external wall but if it's a new
construction it's just as easy
to put it in the walls before
you close and seal them up and
then yeah with the whole doesn't
have any of that the external
how do it running on the outside
or any of those type of things
it's it's essentially pre ready
except the wires have been
pulled.
Thank you thank you madam chair.
Senator Neville.
Thank you madam chair senator
is this bill in place with this
member of the one that you had
the other day to mandate solar
panels on the house.
Madam chair and senator that can
be gets to more when I was gonna
do with the presentation on the
whole bill but the amendments
are essentially the whole bill
out what this is is I envision
this bill kind of traveling
underneath that other one yet
that one were to die along the
way that this one would come as
a much just a softer version
where houses are at least that
pre ready to put solar on as
opposed that required to have so
we're on it if the other one
gets all the way through becomes
law this one becomes.
Very good you said something
about the.
Wiring or pre wiring for
charging cars the EDD's is that.
Just conduit or is it mandated
that the wiring.
In this particular bill we would
actually have the wiring put in
for that as many of you know
General Motors that's our most
board is indicated that they're
going to quit making internal
combustion engines I think it
was twenty thirty five it's
coming and we ought to be
building homes that are ready
for that rather than having to
retrofit with the the higher and
I know that I get the right
thing the higher level your
gauge of wire resulted systems
to handle the charging systems.
When I I appreciate that I wired
my house that way anticipating
that some day my house is
relatively new we but the wire
again but never the less I don't
know what the costs of one thing
I read I've been reading up on
all this is up to twenty
charging systems not
particularly fast would be
alright overnight.
Even even to twenty doesn't
charge card requests in the we
one thing that concerns me as
the map also is so.
It takes about thirty megawatts
said option kilowatts to run a
car a hundred miles or so and
that's all sure most laying it
out we don't have enough
electricity centric rental cars
students seventy million
vehicles in the United States
we're not gonna be able to the I
don't know.
How we gonna get there.
But then you know it's a good
idea objectives people will be
thinking.
Was for thought the I'm I'm not
sure necessarily that that that
could be wrong I don't know what
it costs to be relatively
expensive proposition else I
don't know about that maybe not
a couple thousand five hundred
thousand I would guess should be
somewhere in the ballpark.
That's all I have madam chair
thank you.
Thank you and
is there any other committee
members that would like to
comment on this.
Madam chair.
Who is speaking.
Committees of good Senator
Schmedes go ahead.
I'm still unable to
to see the amendment I I'd I
don't think.
I'm just having a lot of I. T.
issues this morning so I can't
get on to my provided you know
it is the moment relatively
short with with the sponsor just
mind reading it is short yes
certainly and Senator Schmedes
while the reeds that will put it
back up on the screen in case
you can just see the screen on
that soon.
I'm John I'm calling in via my
land line okay and so I think we
have put this land line about
three months ago so I'm
anticipating IT issues recession
so I'm glad we I have that but
I.
gonna take me I don't know maybe
another forty five minutes to
work out my them stuff perhaps
so that's why I can't see it
certainly Knowles could you
please read the amendment it's
only right that can put it back
up that would be the easiest for
me also is just read off of the
screen.
You don't have the amendment
there
I've got a pile of paperwork and
I might be able to find it but
again when it was up it was very
easy to to get to.
On the screen and Senators souls
will read it.
What it says is on page two line
one straight be wired and
incertae Lou there of have one
each conduit installed in the
walls on page two like to strike
one electrical receptacle into
thirty live there up to two
hundred and forty what
electrical receptacle
sufficient.
That is the amendment.
Okay madam chair just to one
question then on the amendment
like.
Thank you thank you senator sold
So the the so the condo so we're
not really talking about wiring
anymore we were just talking
about a a conduit for potential
wiring in the future is that
correct yes.
Okay thank you senator thank you
madam chair.
Thank you I'm in the F. I. R. it
does I did find the costs of our
bill was almost spot on.
It started around five hundred
and went up.
So
That was included in that is a
lower cost than your last bill.
So for my concern of affordable
housing.
Is there anything else on the
amendment.
We're still on the amendment.
Okay we have a motion.
Sorry.
Yes madam chair yes.
Madam chair.
If you folks are being told it
costs five hundred dollars to
run that con do it I need to let
me know I got a lot of
subcontractors under Los crucis.
What.
Fifty Bucks it's.
I'm just joking that that that
number can't be right to run a
con do it from a from a roof
location to a circuit box or
panel.
Should be anywhere near five
hundred dollars that I I say
that mentors to better about.
Madam chair I think that
includes the wiring for the car
charge which is considerably
more.
Thank you senator that maybe
right.
Okay.
Well we're I have to correct
them RLD because those are the
numbers that they provided in
the FIR.
Okay so we're back on the
amendment we have a motion to
adopt the amendment Branik it

political organizer with the
Sierra Club Rio Grande.
I'm representing over thirty
five thousand members offer a
southern New Mexico and I just
wanted to speak in support of
Senate bill one thirteen but by
Senator Neville souls and and
just really appreciate it and
putting us forward I think it is
important to us as we transition
to renewables as we transition
to a different alternatives of
of power and Electricite to
find something for homeowners to
have the option to.
Okay make their homes better
when it comes you construction
so thank you so much for your
time I urge you to vote yes on
this bill.
Thank you.
I see your has been up and I
also have your name as a expert

Thank you on mute yourself
please.
There you go the expert witness
was forced to be if there was
any further discussion on Senate
bill eighty two but yes I'm here
representing the league of women
voters of New Mexico madam chair
and members of the committee the
waters of New Mexico urges you
to vote yes on Senate bill one
thirteen the league supports
policies incentives that reduce
greenhouse gas emissions this
bill would make it easier for
homeowners to install called to
locate him in order to electric
car.
Thank you very much.
I think there's another one
Trevor.
Yeah.
Thank you very much madam chair
members the committee this is
Jen danger down and I'm the
executive director of the oil
and I can tell you OCA Asian of
New Mexico where a group of
predominately local solar
installation companies we also
have a major credit union is a
member a couple manufacturers
and we are really appreciate
this bill we think it's really
important for homes ready all
for photovoltaic systems and
ready for electric vehicles and
we do appreciate the very
important amendment that Senator
sold brought to this bill
because as he mentioned not all
systems are going to use the
same size wiring the only other
suggestion we could make and I I
appreciate that it might be a
little more than what the bill
might be able to accommodate
would be if somehow we could
make the electrical boxes or
load centers compatible as well
because that is the issue that
we do have in our industry
but we do strongly support this
bill and yes to also address the
comment that Senator Montez made
yes you can do it on the outside
wall but I think it's we all
appreciate when you buy a new
construction home you like to
have a look nice and pretty so
that's essentially what it
accomplish accomplishes by being
inside the wall and up thank you
very much we strongly support
the bill.
Thank you are there any other
speakers on Senate bill one
thirteen as amended.
Committee members I'm sorry
Samantha.
Committee.
Hi a semantic have thank.
And I just want explain your
last name doesn't come up on the
screen that's why.
Sorry about that thank you madam
chair members of the committee
the cow the excitement energy
advocate with conservation
voters Mexico for the reasons
already stated with the other
proponents of this bill we also
want to support for the same
reasons and we hope that this
committee also votes in favor
thank you madam chair.
Thank you are there any of the
speakers.
Committee members questions
comments.
Madam.
Senator metes.
Thank you thank you madam chair
and thank you senator.
Both are sold we I'm sorry I
can't see your face I'm hope
hoping to be.
On a little bit here
We've we've served together not
not too long but we I think we
know that we.
disagree on on a lot of the the
core issues surrounding this
this bill.
of course I did hear
presentation on the other
related bill with with the solar
panels
I just wanted to.
This Madam that I I I have a
concern with the the it's coming
argument
And you know you had mentioned
Ford's plans on the twenty
thirty five internal combustion
engine and those sorts of
things.
I I I just want to you know
humbly push back on that
comment.
I think that.
As we provided we we do need to
prepare for the future.
The you know the canals in
Seattle are great.
Example of that you know the the
the the engineers who built one
of the bigger canals the locks
in Seattle people made fun of
them because.
They said you never gonna need
to unlock this big is that well
on.
Fifty sixty seventy years we
will and and sure enough they're
they're using it and so that
principle is well taken and I I
appreciate
Your you know looking you know a
decade or two in the future I I
appreciate that very very much
but.
I I don't believe these things
are coming in the reason is once
again because we're relying on
these energy sparse resources
and I think today is a great
case in point
many people can't get on I've
got text from other senators
Center guy go to make a comment
the wind turbines are frozen
there they're having a problem
and so does this happen every
day no but I think it's just a
great example that.
We are
We are decreasing our
What this of our our power grid
here and we are anticipating a a
technology that I believe is it
is not going to do what we think
it's going to do in twenty
thirty five.
And I think that once again the
reason is because just the law
of physics the the Energy dance
issue as well as ethical issues
where these batteries are coming
from they're coming from areas
that are destroying our planet's
with mining techniques that the
United States doesn't have a
hand in regulating and these
lithium and cobalt mines and
some of these large corporations
are being sued right now because
they've exploited children
specially in the Congo to get
cobalt for some of these
batteries
you know and then we can go on
on about with them.
but I I just respectfully
disagree that in twenty thirty
five we're gonna be getting rid
of of all these internal
combustion engines because I
think.
The laws of physics are are
going to catch up with us we're
gonna need to make a lot of
changes so
I won't belabor those points but
just want to hit on them again
and respectfully
Choose to not support this
legislation today thank you
madam chair.
Thank you ladies other comments
questions from the committee
members Senator pope.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator souls I'm I I really
want to thank you for bringing
this bill forward I think this
is a little better bill is as
far as to how it would affect a
lot of lower income families and
you know I just want to say that
you know we have to transition
and be prepared for the future
at the same time we're seeing
that from a financial standpoint
this is the transition we need
to make I understand that all
these issues that we're going to
have about how we're gonna power
you know all these vehicles I
understand the issues about
batteries and where we got we
are we going to get the
materials to make them but we
have to start trying to make a
move and transitioning we're
running into the issue today
with power here in our state.
But it isn't just our state you
know our neighbors in Texas are
dealing with the same thing and
more and oil and gas power house
so I just think we need to have
an approach where we are truly
diversifying and I think this is
not saying that we're only gonna
run on solar or renewable but I
think this is part of the
portfolio so I will be
supporting the bill and thank
you for bringing.
Thank you Senator any other
questions or comments from the
committee members.
Is the committee ready for a
motion.
I'd like to motion for do pass
madam chair thank you center
have on I have a due pass is
there a second second there is a
second from Senator Sedillo
Lopez.
Any further discussion with
Veronica please call the vote.
Senator surrounding yes Senator
Gallegos.
No matter.
No matter.
Senator Hamblen yes.
Senator Neville.
Senator poke.
Just.
Senator sold yes Senator
committees.
No.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Yes.
CENIC's yes.
There's six yes and three no.
Thank you very much Center souls
are you have a do pass on this
bill on Senate bill one
thirteen.
And now Senators souls on to
more difficult topic perhaps
Senate bill one fifty six.
Thank you madam chair and thanks
for the little T. up on the it's
gonna be more difficult bill and
it's not so much that the bill
is difficult as it is dull and
boring and confusing
madam chair Senate bill one
fifty six as I was going through
and looking at the FIR the FIR
was wrong there were pieces put
into it that this bill had
nothing to do with and lots of
these emotions run very high
around the ETA the energy
transitioned Act and as I look
through and what was written in
the bill there were some things
that needed to be fixed and so
what I would like the madam
chair with your permission is it
does have an amendment it is a
again a very short amendment and
it clears up all whole lot of
the misinformation in the F. I.
R. in the analysis and makes the
bill much simpler and cleaner
and so if I could madam chair I
would like to move for
discussion purposes the
amendment for SB one fifty six
and I think it is simple enough
that it shows on a single page
that we can put up on the screen
and for center city eighties
orders under guy goes you may
not have access to a screen
right now I'd be happy to read
that also.
Okay so we have a motion for
discussion purposes and
amendment to Senate bill one
fifty six is there a second to
the motion for discussion.
The motion madam chair I'd like
to hear the discussion thank you
very much
Senator
okay first of all Trevor when
you put on the screen the
amendment and then Senator souls
would you please go through the
amendment and explain for
everyone listening and watching
yes madam chair and it really is
important for everybody watching
to understand what the amendment
is because I suspect they'll be
a number of people who have
signed up to oppose this bill
and the amendment will deal very
much with where you're
opposition might be and
hopefully change that opposition
of madam chair the first thing
is on the title of the bill so
that's page one line eighteen
and nineteen is it strikes in
the title where it says
repealing the Energy
transitioned Act.
If I jump down to the the third
section of the amendment.
Which says on page twenty seven
right section nineteen in its
entirety section nineteen in its
entirety is the part that's of
that repeals the parts of the
ETA so the the number one and
number three are the same one
takes it out of the title and
part three take that out of the
bill so it strikes the entire
part about repealing anything
within the Energy transitioned
Act.
I think that you're the number
two on page three line twenty
two.
To get that okay get to that
next ma'am.
Probably because one in three
refer to each other of number
one is the part of the title
that is referred to in part
three at the end of the bill and
so it strikes the whole part
about repealing the Energy
transitioned Act and the
sections that are out.
Number two and the man that
reads on page three line twenty
to strike M. and insert in lieu
thereof a non coal of the energy
transition act very clearly in
the definitions help only with
coal fired power plants this
particular amendment again it's
on page three line twenty two is
it very clearly now we'll read
all by generating facility means
non call center electric
generating facility composed of
one or more generating units the
ETA in this definitions very
clearly indicated it was only
for coal this now deals only
with non coal generating
facilities.
That's with the amendment is and
that's what the amendment that.
Discussion on the amendment from
the committee from that well
first of all let's go to the
audience.
To see if there is any COVID any
opponents on the amendment.
If you would raise your hand if
you are an opponent on the
amendment.
You you would need to identify
that because I I can't see that.
I believe Ben Shelton bridge to
send.
Okay then go ahead.
Madam chair looking to support
the moment I'm sorry try to get
my hand on a time okay yes
definitely.
I'm not getting any.
Yes absolutely I'll reach out to
million yet like I said I think
definitely you know some of
these monster later he is also
doing a little bit more of
what's going on we're not you're
not read it.
Okay please remain muted into
your called on so we have no
opponents are there any
proponents of the amendment.
From the public then go ahead.
Thank you madam chair all
combine my comment with
amendment on the comment on the
bill as a whole we initially
started out as opposed on this
bill with this amendment we will
drop in opposition based on the
fact that this would no longer
affect chapter sixty to article
eighteen the New Mexico state co
dealing specifically with
transition away from coal plants
and and securitization of coal
plants this this is something
you would have neutral impact as
Amanda so we would support the
amendment support go neutral on
the bill as amended thank you
madam chair.
Thank you we're on the amendment
is there anybody else who wants
to speak on the amendment.
Senator we're going to Canadian
center renewable then Senator
Sedillo Lopez.
Thank you madam chair center
what is the effect when used.
The number two when you strike
the non coal or no coal and what
does that do exactly.
When that to me madam chair and
senator and I have to drift into
the actual content of the bill
from from just the amendment the
whole idea behind this bill is
that it provides a financial
tool when a power plant has to
be shut down by the stripping
out the non coal is very
specifically takes out anything
dealing with the ETA the San
Juan generating station for
quarters I I'm not there might
be one other coal generating
wind but this does not deal with
those this would be if there
were stranded assets from for
instance a gas plant the closes
down this only would deal with
thousand so this entire thing is
going to sit side by side with
the PTA the securitization part
of the EPA this will sit beside
it to deal with all those that
are non coal the EPA dealt
exclusively through its
definitions with coal plants.
So this would pre vent
securitization for example our
gas plant is a the concept.
madam chair with no what this is
is it would provide the PRC with
the securitization pool if a gas
plant closes but that again get
content I'll go through a lot of
that in more detail at.
Yeah I takes the provision from
medic securitization for gas
plant that might be available
the J. the.
The eighty eight Madam.
Senator to make it as Mexico
how.
The eighty eight does not allow
securitization for a gas plant
or even the consideration of
that.
That's what I thought but I
strong to figure out what how
this non coal particular wording
and
Not thank you fast if you're on
the fly but I'm trying to figure
that so.
Thank you and and if I might
madam chair I just very quickly
you almost have to have the ATA
sitting there but in the
definitions of the ETA for
qualifying generating plant it
says they coal fired qualifying
generating facility this now
says a non call so it picks up
everything that's not call.
Okay thank you madam.
Thank you senator Neville
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
The some mute yourself Senator
please send me on mute.
Thank you
so we're speaking just on the
amendment right that's correct
so madam chair Senators sold.
That meant the I'm sort of now
in a different place because
of the repeal of the ETA was
what made this a non starter for
me.
And I I saw asked so why did you
decide to leave the the.
The ETA in place I'm thrilled
that you did but I'm I'm curious
about why.
Madam chair the EPA is already
law people are very emotionally
of one side or the other on that
this is not designed to be that
this is designed to get the PRC
a tool to to deal with future
stranded asset costs and so this
leaves everything in the ETA in
place impact doesn't even touch
anything of that sort by making
it non coal it clearly exclude
everything in the ETA which in
the definitions with exclusively
cope.
Okay thank you I I definitely
support this minute.
Thank you any other comments or
questions about the amendment.
Yes it will be do you have
something more.
Okay thank you so I believe
Center souls made the motion on
the amendment Senator Hamblen
you seconded it.
Okay.
Run again please call the vote
on the amendment.
I want to just.
Senator Cervantes.
Senator Gallegos.
No ma'am.
Senator Hamblen yes.
Senator Neville.
Senator souls yes.
Senators.
I'm sorry Senator pope.
Yes.
And senator souls yes Senator
smitteez.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Yes.
Senator Stefanics I'm sorry
Senator Cervantes.
Senator Stefanics.
Yes.
I yes three no and when excused.
Okay so how you have been
adopted you have a an amendment
that's been adopted so back on
the bill Senator if you'd go
through the explanation.
And madam chair you know as I
sort of eluded to this is
probably going to be one of the
boldest boring and dull built
you will hear this committee the
entire year
it is strictly a tool in the
toolbox for the PRC it is a
financing mechanism most of the
bill are the details that are
needed in financing it was
written by an expert were I work
with an expert on securitisation
that is been used in other
states very effectively I'll let
me give a little bit of
background as to what
securitization is when you have
a stranded asset with the
utility the utility pubblico
reinvest road utilities have a
right to recruit their
investment for those utilities
of that.
Cost is borne by the rate
payers.
Securitization is the tool that
may be used by the PRC other
states how do you see the public
utility commission but the
regulator organization it is a
tool for once it has been
determined what those stranded
assets are that they are legally
required and allowed to.
Recover is it provides a non by
passable financial mechanism.
What rates and interest rates.
For
the office please take over.
Senator.
Yes and so it provides the the
absolute lowest rate because it
is a non by passable charge and
therefore when you go out for
bonds you typically get triple a
go double extra good bond rating
which means that the rate payer
is going to pay the lowest cost
for that stranded assets it's no
longer producing power but that
they have a financial obligation
for and so this and and I can go
through each of the individual
sections if you would like the
boring presentation on the
finances of how this all would
work but basically after in this
bill after it gets through the
first page or two of definitions
where we amended to make sure
that it is now on hold fired
which excludes the eighty eight.
That we have what is the been
determined a stranded asset and
what the value of that stranded
asset costs is is it then allows
either the utility in order to
recover the value of the
stranded asset or the PRC may
under its own motion determined
or set up to do securitization
to get the lowest cost one of
the things that I think I read
for you some pieces out of the
report comparing securitization
in the last one.
But if I can very shortly read
says since because bonds can be
in a variety of circumstances
it's probably wise to authorize
the bonds before they're needed
so as to be available in times
of need in other words it's
better that the tool available
and not need it then to need it
and not have it this is the
financial mechanism of that pool
it does not require the PRC to
do securitization it does not
require the utility to do
securitization once they have
determined the stranded ask that
either the utility can't
requested Germanization for the
for the PRC and say we are going
to securitize it because they
get the lowest rate for rate
payers to cover that obligation
if there is a better mechanism
or another mechanism that comes
up in the future or for a
particular situation that
provides ratepayers with the
lower rate that would be the
mechanism that you if
securitization provides the
lowest rate for rate payers to
recover that stranded asset than
the PRC and put in
securitization mechanism for the
utility can request the PRC to
do securitization for that
mechanism and so it is strictly
the tool in the toolbox it does
not obligate the PRC to do so
it's just if it provides the
best for the the rate payers the
rest of it you know and as I go
through all my notes here I can
just give a very brief of each
of the different sections of
section three the utility
applies to the PRC for abandoned
at the start the process and
requested Germanization the PRC
and either require
securitization or allow the
utility to do so based on its
own motion that's page six line
three eight six sections thank
outlines when securitization can
be used at and outlines the
requirements which are things
like.
At the end of that is
appropriate the end of the
creates a stranded asset
securitization result in the
lower rates well allow utilities
to recoup the qualifying costs
on page six section the if an
application to abandon is in
process when when it takes place
in that deals with what happens
if there is already abandoned
and in process section four is
the some of the details of the
financing order at the time
limit for the PRC to act
required in information to
include when it is then
determined that securitizations
going to be used such a schedule
to abandon estimate consumer
savings have to be determined
faster internet alternative
financing have to be determined
the non by passable costs that
must be paid by the ratepayers
has to be determined in the
best of methodology for
assigning about the classes of
rate payers classes ratepayers
being individuals businesses of.
municipalities it sets up how
does that all gets determined
through this process section
five on page eight is set up the
hearing determine and these are
the legal words that are used by
investor owned utilities that it
is reasonable just and
reasonable public interest
reasonable and prudent of the
structure and marketing it
cetera
indicate more that the order
shall have the maximum amount to
be securitized of this is where
the department what the total
costs are going to be the
billing mechanism financing
costs the property to use to pay
for the securitization and the
property being the the asset and
the rate payers that have an and
by passable of.
Writer on there right in order
to do this Page ten authorizes
financing through securitization
and the mechanisms for adjusting
that can be no longer than
thirty years the timing of the
order you're right making as you
get down to page twelve talk
about conditions on the sale of.
Properties of the requirements
to reduce rates with
securitization abroad Bond
distribution and how do you
actually get it out to the bond
market that these are available
so that people will buy the the
very highly rated bonds that are
very secure of that stays affect
until it's paid that it means
that it is very vocal that once
a secured out hi
bonds have been issued a future
legislature cannot come back and
say oh by the way take that's
we're not doing that anymore
that's part of how you get a
triple a bond rating is because
this is not revoke herbal once
it is happened allows for
refinancing if it helps on doing
that page thank you six deals
with the powers of the
commission to do all of this
page fifteen the reasonableness
of costs and and how that is set
up optimizes customer savings
those are some of the reasonable
prudence restrictions or
charge that the PRC has paid
seventeen section seven deals
with judicial review section
eight with property requirements
section nine legal investments
on page twenty one section ten
that the state cannot impair
which allows for the lowest cost
financing so someone even from
the state auditor once this is
done it is a done deal with law
and again that is what allows
securitization to get that the
super low interest rates of
purple a bond rating
and that once this is done the
finances don't become a PRC
regulated that yeah once it's a
done deal it's done section
forty with the sale of property
page twenty six section fifteen
that the bond proceeds only for
utility service to customers so
it requires that any of the
proceeds from the bond that pay
off the utility completely and
wholly from the sale of the
bonds that those returns must be
plowed back into customer
service they cannot be used as
dividends to investors are and
then section eighteen if one
area is invalidated other
sections that it is what in that
the legal talks about
severability and so most of that
is just.
Technical details about the
financial orders with it out
madam chair this is just the
tool in the toolbox for the PRC
should it become the lowest cost
way for stranded assets to be
paid off by the ratepayers of
that particular utility it does
not touch anything dealing with
renewable energy our amounts
with the hundred percent I
twenty forty five it doesn't do
any of that this is just the the
financial tool and so I'm I
could tell by some of the faces
I poured you a bit with all of
that I warn you ahead of time
but I would be very open for
questions now and again as we go
out to the public please
recognize this does not do
anything to the ETA that is
banned Amanda out of this bill
entirely it does not affect
anything up in the four corners
area dealing with Sam on or four
corners generating those were
all part of the ETA those are
coal fired the amendment changes
this and clearly says this is
not on call.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank thank you I'd so does
anybody that what I'm sorry I
was so engrossed in what you
were saying never got that
opportunity
so it is.
We've already voted on the
amendment so does anybody have
are there any proponents no I
guess we go first opponent are
there any opponents of the bill
I Trevor.
First we have asa Thomas.
Yes a shakeup to transition a
chef that that means that you
sunny but she need not correct
and that this check is on a
mission and the good to hope but
going out the woman said that
I'm we appreciate the center
Senator having made amendments
to not impact.
Full securitization and
associated just transition funds
and the San Juan area but I
would really like to evaluate
the possibilities of transition
funds related to gas or nuclear
securitization worked in the ETA
primarily because of the ability
to secure those triple a ratings
keeping right right for rate
payers low but mainly because of
the just transition funds to
help those communities most
directly affected so we are
mutual at this point now that
the other questions were taken
out but in addition I just want
to make sure that there are no
incentives for building new gas
and want to thank the the
sponsor and committee members
for allowing me to speak thank
you.
Thank you Mr Chavis Trevor next.
I am.
This I wanted.
Great thank you I'm Camilla I
woman I am the director of the
Rio Grande chapter of the Sierra
Club and I would like to also
thank the senator for we're
removing the pieces that relate
to coal and then just transition
fund that will that
but I also think that maybe some
interim work to look at the
possibilities of just transition
funds with relationship to the
gas and nuclear might be helpful
but I'd also like to make sure
that there's not sort of an
unintended incentive to build
new gas we know that PNM is
leaving some of its leases that
it holds up Palo Verde and has
talked about building new gas to
replace that so do does it
become financially more valid
for them to build new coal that
they have to do sorry new new
gas that they would have to
depreciate by twenty forty five
were as they've committed to do
by twenty forty so it's a quick
turnaround and I would really
like to have some more time to
evaluate the impacts thank you
so much.
Every next.
That is all the opponents and
then there were no any Division
of the proposed on.
Okay is anyone here who would
like to speak for or against the
bill.
Okay we'll go ahead and turn it
to the committee.
Madam chair this survey because
I do have a question.
Yes Senator Gallegos.
And I don't know how to raise my
hand with the this issue I have.
If you and then senator Neville
just raised his hand.
Okay madam chair and and
etcetera first off I find it
really audited only procurement
strong
not having difficulty getting in
but my question
madam chair and senator is.
If I understand and have a real
hard time following things
because of the power outage but
what are we.
You only need to pay
This quickly I'm just trying to
figure out the overall reason
for this bill.
Senator okay hello
that will be a.
Madam chair and senator out it
does not repeal the EPA that was
what was amended out in the end
and that.
Okay.
Did you catch that it was
repealed
and etcetera I apologize because
not be able to the amendment
either I'd asked the chair to.
All the process because I can't
see anything but just part time
that that was my main question
and I I do know
Madam chair and senator
of this the detail that you're
talking about will that be seen
on the electric bill.
On the utility bill.
Madam chair and senator.
Organization is only a tool that
the PRC can use and so when we
have a stranded asset and the
PRC has determined that a an
asset of gas plant for instance
must be closed down because
it's no longer needed it's past
its useful life at but there is
still value in the asset
underappreciated asset you have
what's called a stranded asset
the rate payers have a
responsibility to cover the cost
of that stranded asset when that
cost is been determined by the
utility and the PRC through
their normal processes this is
something that happens on a
regular basis whenever there is
a closer closure is a shut down
of you know I I generating
station or even part of the
generating station once that's
determined that cost is still
the responsibility of the right
here.
What this bill does is if if we
results in a lower cost for the
rate payer for that obligation
securitization is a toll the PRC
can use to go out for bonds to
cover that cost at the lowest
cost to rate payers those bonds
make the utility hold for their
a depreciated asset and it has
the lowest cost for the
ratepayers because rather than
going to the regular market that
that I'm making up numbers but
might be three or four percent
of our the money with
securitization because of the.
The.
Unavoidable once it's done it
you can't go back and change it
you might get triple a ratings
that are only three percent
instead of the four five percent
last the rate payers are the
lowest return that they have to
pay off M. the utility has been
a whole.
Okay thank you madam chair
etcetera and I guess that brings
me to the part of my question so
the lower cost of the bond
amount would be on their bill is
that correct they physically
have it to view that right.
Madam chair I have not seen a
bill that has this but similar
to how the ETA for the coal
powered plants has a cost that
is going to be put on the bill
for the at PNM ratepayers this
would have for instance L.
possible elector has a gas power
plant that still has value so
the stranded asset you have to
close down for whatever reason
that the stranded assets and the
PRC determines that
securitization of the lower cost
this would be an increase on on
the bill at the lowest potential
cost now the money the the
company gets in they have to put
back into it and so you know I
could tell you exactly what it
is that's part of happens as it
goes through this financial tool
is determining if this is the
lowest cost mechanism for making
the utility hole through the
application of the right here.
Thank you madam vice chair and
senator I I guess with my
working for
PNM for thirty years and having
to deal with bill collections
and customer issues hi I
typically did not find anyone
that could would read the entire
bill which are like the ones you
don't actually look at the
change needed but just a lot
because I think of.
Customers would look at in more
detail bill insurance and that
might be a really good way to
explain what the stranded that
said this and the costs and so
they can understand what they're
paying for because we make the
decision as legislators
ultimately the state park pay
the price so with that madam
chair I will you'll.
Thank you senator senator
Neville.
Thank you madam chair I'm
getting some text comments from
a lot of people who are not
seeing the amendment not knowing
exactly what it does how it
affects I'm talking utility
vehicle
Would it be possible Senator
that we hold this over the still
next meeting I'm not trying to
kill the bill misunderstand or
table or anything just a hold
over until we can I look back to
my emails and everything and I
can't find the amendment I sure
came out probably just lost in
the shuffle.
Currently the public has not
seen the amendment I don't know
exactly what it does.
There's a lot of concern I've
got questions I'm not sure
exactly we're doing either so
I'm respectfully asking that we
try to hold this up to the next
what is it we need Saturday or
something like that or whenever
it is that maybe we can sort
this out the public affairs you
need.
But that's a request madam chair
if the Senators agreeable we
could do that to I don't want to
cause any delay in this bill but
I'm trying to figure out how we
resolve this thank you very each
is a big deal the to make sure
that we're doing what we need.
So that's more questions chair.
Madam chair I I would prefer not
this does not deal with the Ph.D
amendment clearly separates it
from the ETA and and that is
what the amended it is it broke
out the part about repeal the
ETA on that very clearly can
just say the three things that
took the building out of the
title it took repeal the
sections of repealing the ACA
which is section nineteen the
last paragraph of the entire
bill and on page three on the
definitions it changed it to say
non cold where the EPA clearly
says it is only for coal plants
that's all the amendment does
but it has a significant change
this does absolutely nothing to
the ETA it is just this the
financial tool for the PRC for
future potential there are none
out there pending right now that
I'm aware of of any bills on
securitisation but they will be
coming as we are moving and
transitioning to a renewable
energy.
Portfolio and there will be
closures that caused stranded
assets and this provides the
lowest rate for rate payers
securitizations a tool that can
be used to ensure that.
I think what the issue is
everyone of these utilities have
been approved for one hundred
percent recovery under the
normal process and then we go to
securitization there shouldn't
be any question of whether it
the only question would be
whether they're closer and
they're to be in my mind no
question whether you reimburse
the company through
securitization.
But anyway that's that's a my
opinion and some of utilities
are concerned about that may or
may not be what's happening.
And madam chair that is exactly
what this bill does this bill
and the the financial mechanism
kicks in once the it is been
determined that there is a
stranded asset but that stranded
after the.
Well as is the normal process
now this.
That's what it does it say in
what's that stranded asset has
been determined and that this is
just the financial mechanism
for.
The only pro should be doing
closer in my mind so anyway
that's all our I would request
that it's not madam chair will
do it but to just wanted to
throw that out there thank you
madam chair.
Thank you Senator then the
Senator Hamblen.
Thank you madam chair and and
thank you senator souls for for
making the amendments and just
to be clear so this doesn't
affect the ETA right.
Okay
the the other question I had and
and this was brought up by two
members who of the of the public
given that you know this bill
inside and out do you see that
opportunity or the opportunity
to to make sure that there are
no new incentives for
for gas building new gas plants
where does this kind of come
into that.
Madam chair and senator him
without the approval for new gas
plant is completely under the
authority of the PRC
and as well as part of the bill
that we heard I think on
Saturday and was indicated that
the PRC is been very aggressive
in implementing the requirements
of the ETA that indicate that we
have to move aggressively to be
renewable energy portfolio
standard
they have denied el Paso
electric and others for new gas
plants already because they
would create a stranded asset of
this sort and said no you can't
purposely create a stranded
asset that we're gonna have to
pay you for into the future and
so that still is the
responsibility an incumbent upon
the PRC to do their portion but
that has nothing to do with this
bill this bill is just when
there is a stranded asset this
provides a mechanism for paying
off that obligations that the
ratepayers have.
Madam chair thank you senator
souls.
Thank you Senator Hamblen is
there anyone else the Senate
bill you don't do you have
another question it's your and
just up.
So so Senator I I I only saw the
amendment today I know that it
went out of it wouldn't
yesterday so I was I had a whole
different frame and you know
that may make you think that
maybe we should have more time
because we're votes on it but I
have a couple of questions
or few questions.
Harder to.
The reason I like this is in
part this is what we were trying
to do in yes the one fifty five
with thirty one C. of the TA
that is we were trying to
clarify that gas and nuclear
would not automatically get one
hundred percent cost recovery we
were trying to do and when I see
this bill does is you are
presaging when the gas plants
and the nuclear plants close
down.
And you're trying to ensure that
the PRC is in the picture.
It is that correct.
Madam chair and and senator and
well it's not directly part of
this bill the PRC has the
obligation the responsibility
constitutional obligation to
determine what stranded assets
are when a utility closets
this kicks in after that
determination has been made and
so it keeps the PRC in their
constitutional role as it is and
then done as you've heard me say
several times and yeah I'm very
good at being a broken record
all this does then is it gives
them the tools to find the
lowest cost to ratepayers for
their financial obligation to
make the utility hole for any
stranded assets.
Well and and thank you senator
souls that in in SB the one
fifty five at least the reason I
was so interested in it was
because of the fear that the ETA
would then be applied to gas
plants and nuclear plants I know
that there is a provision that
limit limited one section to
coal but it was unclear with
thirty one C. whether that would
apply to nuclear and gas and
that was the part when the when
nuclear in class and and gas
were closed down that that
guaranteed one hundred percent
cap cost recovery and so that
was the amendment in one fifty
five and not to rehash and one
fifty five IST but but that's
what I thought we were doing and
I honestly when I I was just not
gonna vote for this because I
thought it amended the need to
repeal the ETA.
And now I'm thinking that this.
This will bring the the PRC has
you said back into its
constitutional role with regard
to clear clearly no questions
with regard to two guests and
with regard to nuclear which I
think is is very very important
because to have ratepayers paid
for those stranded assets
investments at that time.
I it just seems to be a rate
just a hundred percent after the
Supreme Court has has said that
they will not get recovery of
investments that we're not
prudent the PNM would not get
recovery from the rate payers
and so what that seems really
important to me and then as you
said the bonds would be secured
by the obligation to pay but
then you also said that they
were going to be secured by the
stranded assets with that would
you said.
Madam chair and no that is not
what happens they are secured by
the size of the electric.
System I'll pass electric all of
the the number of rate payers
that they got on the system that
I use of the public utility
provides that there are going to
be ratepayers to cover those
obligations and they get all of
that gets determined as part of
the financial order if that is
the cheapest way of doing all of
those if I might comment on the
first half you're talking about
some things that are ways of
preceding when this bill like
cricket this bill does not say
that it's a hundred percent cost
recovery it doesn't say it's no
it doesn't get any of that what
that is been determined by
whatever mechanism it's at that
point that this comes in just as
the tool to find the lowest cost
for the rate payers for their
obligation.
Which would be the decision
would be made by the PRC as I
understand your bill.
Madam chair out however it is
once the decision has been made
once that obligation has been
determined what is the stranded
asset is that's when this bill
kicks you.
So we've does not go prior to
that and say that the utility
gets a hundred percent the
utility gets yeah so of the
seventy five this bill is silent
on all that that gets determined
through whatever mechanism is in
place by the PRC at that point
to determine that costs this
bill does nothing to do with
that this is just the financial
mechanism once that has been
determined.
So so has just to try to clarify
my question so the
securitization.
That security is the rate payers
obligation to pay for the
stranded assets not the assets
themselves.
Madam chair yes that is my
understanding of how
securitization works.
Okay and that that's what when
you were speaking and going over
the bill I misunderstood I
thought you said secured by the
obligation to pay answer added
assets and and that just threw
me for a loop.
Madam chair so yeah we have if
that was my comment I I misspoke
what I meant was it secured by
the other assets that the
utility that secured by the
ratepayer bases secured by all
of those large corporation
company and everything that they
have it is not secured by the
the particular stranded asset
that is being securitized I
misspoke it that's how it came
out I apologize.
No no Senator I don't think you
misspoke I think it why just I
just Mr G. I'm Senator the
other.
when I wrote my nose right
here's all the patients and the
assets and so that's why but a
big question mark which assets
and you clarify the assets of
the company itself.
Okay so.
I I there's there's a lot to to
like about this bill one of the
things that happen with the EPA
those as you know I mean ETA ETA
was there were a lot of
negotiations for the communities
that would be affected and as
you as you know because you know
I've talked I felt like a
hundred percent obligation to
pay for those assets did not
offset the the small amounts
that we're going to the
community so the mask the
charges to the right to the rate
payers.
In my view didn't offset you
know the two million dollars of
whatever that that that would go
to the community members it felt
like an uneven deal to me
however it was a deal and I was
just wondering if you thought
that
And and unfortunately the state
came a little.
It was a little late because
we're I don't know I don't know
how you.
Because now we're we're looking
at the four corners plant in
which PNM is pulling out.
Cool can you to burn.
And
they're arguing that they get on
thank.
For for their abandonment
So like I I feel like the ETA
didn't in that case didn't help
us with the transition because
the Cole is going to continue to
burn so your bill doesn't affect
the transition part of the trend
of the energy transition but I'm
wondering do you think it's
worth it to engage in
negotiations to.
To make a deal like they did
with the ETA within the.
Savings that PNM gets from being
able to secure those assets that
secure the obligations to pay L.
bonds on that obligation to pay
whether you think it's worth it
to engage in in negotiations to
get something like that with
your bill.
Madam chair representative I'm
trying really hard not to debate
the EPA this bill doesn't deal
with the TA if there were
something where
Some of the the cost for closing
a plant or something of that
sort were negotiated with the
community that is waiting for
this ever comes in what that
cost has been determined for
closing the plant remediation
anything of that sort that's
where this bill comes at I'm not
going to debate things that have
nothing to do with this bill in
the coming way prior to this
bill It act this is just the
tool that if it is determined to
be the lowest cost mechanism for
rate payers so that's why it's
called the ratepayer protection
act is to protect rate payers
with the lowest cost mechanism
for their obligation for the
stranded asset however whoever
whatever that is determined to
be.
So it has PNM contacted you
about this bill.
Just curious Senator madam chair
now this bill in almost its
current form was introduced two
years ago and was heard by a
committee or to as go again
trying to do it was called at
the time the claim
securitization bill because it
wasn't attached to anything else
it is just the finance mechanism
and again I apologize Senator
but I'm trying to keep this
being a very boring financial
tool would not get into any of
the the emotional things that
this bill doesn't deal with.
Okay.
Thank you senator I think
Senator said want this that I
think we were done with
questions that's why I jumped in
with my question but I noticed
that Senators about this and
Senators maybe both the both are
have questions senators about
this thank you madam chair
Senator souls are still you know
I've of.
Commended you for all your hard
work hard work on the ETA really
trying to dig into a complex
issue I have to repeat some of
the comments I made in an
earlier hearing there are times
too often times too many times I
as a legislator realize that
we're way over our skis
you know we're we're expected to
know health care energy law
just about every possible.
Part of society were expected to
know in great detail and great
complexity your bill presents a
number of legal issues to me and
I have a great deal of
difficulty understanding and
interpreting it as a lawyer when
I try really hard to do that I
hope you know that when we did
the ETA Center soldier member
you and I spent hours and hours
with the committee going line by
line section by section trying
to dissect it in the the first
year we did so we we have been
start calling so all the bill up
for a whole year and I'm not
gonna do that today mercifully
let me give everybody a little
insurance I'm not going to begin
to try and I think about this
bill really should go to Senate
Judiciary Committee but I
noticed you already have three
referrals already without Senate
Judiciary this is a bill that
requires really a fourth or
probably fifth.
But back to my point about
getting overseas you know it's
too bad this this is a very
complicated area of of our
economy finance utility
deliveries and so what and
really requires something more
than we can do with an hour or
two today this is the kind of
legislation that in my opinion
we should be hearing from the
utilities in fairness at the
very least but I know that
they're not on this call I don't
know why I don't think we've
heard from them today from about
selective or from PNM this would
seem to be of great interest to
them I don't know whether
sleeping in today or they were
snowbound or we're not permitted
to participate in the hearing I
is on the line but may says we
would hear from them at a
certainly that make any sense we
would hear from the PRC but I
don't hear them taking a
position as I said earlier with
Senator fan I'm sorry with a
former servicemen RC Commission
vision you know the PRC is then
agency with the more staff great
many resources full time job
they should be able to be
helping us advising us and we
don't have that advice here
today.
From them we this is a bill that
in my opinion should have an
interim committee process with a
great deal of time study and and
attention to it but I just again
I I this is this is not a way to
run a government my opinion is
to is to give an hour to very
complicated a bill I. I've
What what does right now is this
bill is that maybe I'm like that
you need a this bill requires of
securitization for a stranded
asset in other words the well
you all shaking your head no but
I'll be happy to show you were
it were it reads that way last
unless you change session three
I don't believe you change
section very if you read session
three of your bill it says the
PRC has the authority to require
securitization.
Up madam chair and senator on
page five section three says a
qualified utility may apply the
commission to that to help you
use securitization it also says
that on the next one the connect
the commission on its own motion
may require the use it does not
require it may require well
maybe I maybe I misspoke but it
but you do what you read is what
the when I was intended to say
which is the PRC can do it on
some other Smith PRC can require
securitization which is why I
believe what I said that the
dust all different ETA says the
utility can pursue
securitization but but this bill
would allow the PRC that to
require securitization of a
stranded asset that's premade
Authority that's essentially
requiring a utility to the
submit to the PRC to do that the
reason I thought that your bill
might need to go to Judiciary as
we look at section seven.
Frankly our.
Again this is just one of the
merrier is I want to really go
through the bill line by line
but look at section seven if
somebody in your use the word
aggrieved party so grief party
wants to excuse me I'm sorry
immigrate parties I'm happy with
the decision on a on a financing
order the PRC they have ten days
to appeal and the PRC doesn't
act on that within ten days that
appeal is being denied you know
that's that's extraordinary for
those of us that are lawyers to
expect somebody to appeal within
ten days and then to have the
PRC expected to act on the
appeal within ten days or else
it's game tonight what are are
something timelines that I've
never seen in the practice of
law I don't know of anything
that happens that fast with the
PRC Moores that's just an
example of the kind of things
that that I think are
problematic for me in looking at
the procedures in the building
the other thing I would know
even that one section is that
then there's an appeal by any
aggrieved party directly to the
New Mexico Supreme Court.
So I'll summarize it Center I
can't support it because
candidly this bill is a dream
for lawyers this is a lawyer's
greed if I look through the bill
I find that the the full of
ambiguities.
And subjective standards that
that are we how I and others
earn a living but not with any
joy I I I right there's nothing
that makes my life more
difficult when a client comes
into Siemens's Joe what does the
law require me to do and I give
them the lawyer answer which is
well it depends.
And on the what the judge's
depends on interpretation and it
depends on how you construe
things that we may see a about
ten years from now when the
appeals are exhausted I don't
think any that's good so I'm
forgery etcetera I I again I all
I'll invite Committee you've dug
into this as much as anybody I
know you've given this a lot of
effort and attention I just
think this bill would require a
great deal of work far beyond
what we can do here today and
the without that I I really
don't think that it could ever
be enforced in any meaningful
way I think it would just simply
lead to a great deal of
litigation so I'll have to
oppose it today thank you.
And madam chair if I might and
and Senator about this I did
talk with Steve Fishman the PRC
chairman yesterday and could
probably best summarised his up.
Hearing on this bill as I think
you said in the E. G. eight two
years ago he solidly on the
fence.
Of.
Your manager is just you know
centers all you and I tried
really hard to we would you
would you are actively aligned
on ETA to get the PRC engaged on
the ETA there wasn't there was
something on the fence you
remember one day they were for
the next they were against it
and they were back and forth and
they would vote they couldn't
decide.
You know if we has is with
legislators can't get clear from
direction from the PRC that
suggests to me that we're not
ready for prime time yet in the
that's unfortunate but we have
to as legislators we have to
rely upon.
Lots of others to do to make
good decisions and I'm certainly
not qualified over the first one
to say I'm not qualified on
utility finance law.
For bond markets or or utility
of stranded assets or or any of
the many things you're tackling
this bill that that is not my
area of expertise
I'm not a criminal lawyer I
don't do wills and trusts not I
know why is my land and stay
solidly within it this is way
outside of my lane and candidly
I don't know any of my
colleagues in the Senate who
have the level expertise I think
it would require to to really
independently assess this bill
we would have to I I really
think we should be relying on
those who are who have expertise
in not from them today we're
not.
Thank you madam chair and and
senator I I had a couple other
of the comments this bill was
drafted by of one of the staff
of the PRC who works in this
area used as models the
securitization bills that have
been used successfully in other
states and model it directly on
those two years ago when this
bill was put out there was an
independent review of it in the
lab I can't get the agency right
but essentially it's the the
group that has all of the PRC
type of groups around the
country they provide the
training for them and indicated
at that time that this was a
model of what securitization
laws should look like Senator
clearly I am not a lawyer either
I my training is in psychology I
can probably tell you what the
stack of papers feeling and
thinking right now but I spend a
lot of time trying to learn and
understand as much as I'm able
to about finance law as it
applies to utilities and
securitization and so no I don't
know how we resolve some of
those things because there are
only a few people and this bill
was drafted by one of the people
in the state at the time was
working for the PRC two years
ago and we spent hours going
through and with her pulling out
the specific pieces from other
states and the laws that have
been successfully use their when
of securitization been used in
those states and so I'm not sure
where we get better guidance
than that but thank you.
I have Senators meeting us meet
these next but I also had no
idea because because the
committee analysis is so
Really risk relied on the repeal
of the of the ETA and that's
pretty much the entire analysis
while we don't have a level of
expertise on our staff on on the
the communal staff that is a
staff that serve the legislature
I was wondering if you would be
interested in rolling it over to
get into and Alice's Senator
souls.
Up madam chair again I would
rather have a vote today on this
bill I the the bill is carefully
crafted I understand Senator
rob this is reservations of but
you know I think it is been
drafted by probably the premier
expert in the state of New
Mexico and no I don't know that
the the analysis the F. R. I. F.
I. R. people I would be able to
to do more than what they've
done because again the majority
of all of their analysis was
based on the repeal of ETA as
I've checked with them they've
indicated that changes a whole
lot and if you recall if you
look through that analysis it
really doesn't talk about the
details of the financing
securitization it talks about
everything that and those parts
were not brought up with any
concern on the analysis.
That backs that absolutely true
which is why I was suggesting to
you that maybe if you roll it
over let's listen this indicated
that she'd be willing to do that
be willing to do a re analysis
and that may be helpful because
I.
I really respect all the work
that you have done and you and I
attended a conference that
That that really helps me I
think put put a lot in context
but it's still very very
complicated this whole notion of
taking an obligation to pay
internet turning it into a
security interest is is
complicated it just doesn't
doesn't just happen but I'll
turn it over to Senators maybe
say if you're not willing to
roll it over Senator smitteez.
Representative by madam chair if
that's the pleasure the
committee I just don't want this
to get bogged down for lack of
time as we're getting further
along where things are tending
to move much slower however I
think we do have scheduled a
four sessions for Thursday in
which case if this were heard as
the first bill on Thursday that
it would be read out then and
would only be delayed by a day
is moving on to two other
committees so you know if if
that is what the committee
thanks I'd be happy to do that
in our certainly open to anybody
who would like to talk about
boring securitization between
now and that and I'll try to
educate you as best I can all
what I have learned about all of
this mechanism and how it's been
used in other states.
so alas the committee and
senator species if you can hold
hold your questions because of
we rolled over you can you can
ask your questions on on the on
the bill with and then and now
is this that actually deals with
securitization alone which has a
Senator pointed out Intersil's
pointed out this was the whole
analysis was on the the repeal.
So I'm is the committee willing
to roll it over.
Is there any are there any
objections to rolling it over.
Senator Senator US navy's.
Madam no I I I'm I'm lowering my
aunt I mean if if we're gonna
continue discussion today I will
ask questions I was not making
comments on on your question
thank you okay Senator Hamblen
you you have your hand up.
Madam chair I don't want to roll
over I'd like to move on the
bill today okay Senator poke.
Thank you madam chair you know
what this bill having a total of
three year furrows is going to
go to two more after this.
I believe we can resolved to get
the answers we need.
This is would be accent Senator
Stefanics.
Keep Cherry but I do think we
should rolling over are we've
had members with weather
problems we've had an offer for
more Canadian an analyst to.
Update this analysis I think it
would be to the benefit of the
sponsor and it could be heard
and eight the first thing at
eight thirty on Thursday
morning.
Thank.
Senator with the the chairs
insurance it'll be hard first
thing on Thursday would you be
willing to roll over madam chair
that divided again because of
how we're doing batch is going
through on the floor it really
doesn't hold it up very much
over over finishing today and
again for anybody on the
committee I'd be happy to have
boring conversations with you
about the securitization
financing.
Thank you thank you senator
because it would also help me to
consult with my friends on the
on the PRC and and to get get
more information honestly I was
just gonna vote no and now I see
possibilities so thank you so
with that and no and what one
opposition any other opposition
to rolling over.
We'll go ahead and share yes.
I just want to tell Senator
schools don't don't shortchange
yourself on the boring factor I
I don't think securitization is
boring at all I think it's a
fascinating topic as it relates
to what's going on with the with
the energy sector so.
Yeah don't don't shortchange
yourself I think it's
fascinating topic.
And madam chair I I don't
confuse boring with important
there's a difference.
Where is usually don't find
these things of because boring
is most people thank you so with
that will roll over to be I will
continue this discussion with
more analysis from our committee
on at eight AM eight thirty on
Thursday I'm sorry thirty on
Thursday
that's let's go to the next
bill.
So this also is.
This is Senator Campos statewide
damn of projects it's the one
thirty eight.
I'm sorry what.
Passionate.
Yes that's right what is Senator
Campos here yes.
Senator Campos.
Thank you very much madam chair
members of the committee in
essence Senate bill one thirty
eight would appropriate one
hundred million dollars to the
office and state engineer in
order for us to continue with
the rehabilitation of our dams
here in New Mexico a few of us
are just as we move forward
first of all according to the S.
I. R. the understanding from the
US state engineer indicates that
they would also need to
additional FTE ease that would
cost about a hundred sixty five
thousand dollars in order to
continue to manages you will the
growing need to our plan
designed oversee and of course
a.
Instructed these dams.
As we move forward a couple of
things that I wish to also
mention is that the office of
the state engineer stem safety
bureau regulates two hundred and
ninety two dams in the state
nearly a hundred fifty of those
dams are publicly owned.
Source if any of these dams were
to have a significant breach
that again was done a cost plus
the loss of life.
in in order for us to move
forward with the project like
this in this is eminent in order
for us to continue to control.
Our water flows to New Mexico we
definitely need to address this
issue just as we deal with our
roads where we're seeking a
hundred million dollars there as
well to make those improvements
and and so if we do move forward
on the continue to bring this to
the attention of the legislature
that this is a highly important
for us to address madam chair
members of the committee if I
may I believe that I have to
experts.
Been waiting from the office of
the state engineer and in
privative they're available to
go ahead and find a little more
professional and expert detail
in terms of of the secure
significant need of the
resources for this particular
bill and forced to proceed to
improve our dams and trolls with
in the state of New Mexico if I
may proceed to allow the experts
for a few minutes to present to.
Their level of expertise please.
Thank you Senator Campos please
call your expert expert thank
you very much madam chair and if
they they could I would allow
them to go and come forward to
introduce themselves and to make
a brief statement in terms of of
the significance of the need
this proprioceptive.
With us so we also have John
Romero and Charles Chuck
Thompson with the office of the
state engineer and also the damn
euro sixty division there with
the LFC thank you madam chair.

have.
This is John Romero madam
secretary okay
Mr Romero.
Yes.
Please go ahead.
Was the question that I didn't
as well you just you to answer
questions you don't have a
separate presentation.
Mr Nate making a presentation as
we are or are you simply here to
answer questions for it to end
to this is Senator with
questions.
I do not have a separate
presentation that I can affirm
the need for a rehabilitation of
dams in New Mexico we do see
quite a few down to do have
deficiencies and the need is
great and the news press and so
The interest of time happily
answer questions but I don't
have a separate presentation
okay are there any supporters of
this bill.
Are there any opponents of this
bill.
Trevor.
A CD single here is to build a
miss Rivera.
Are you a supporter or a or a
are you supported the bill Mr
there or implement.
A supporter madam chair.
Please please go ahead for a
minute or two thank you.
madam chair members of the
committee to near their
registered lobbyists for New
Mexico farm and livestock
bureau.
New Mexico farm and livestock
bureau stand in support of
continued funding for the
implementation of water projects
across the state of New Mexico
that meet the needs of logic
Water planning areas in order to
promote water improve watersheds
and improve water delivery to
all New Mexicans dams like roads
are an important part of New
Mexicos infrastructure many of
New Mexicos downs are poor or
unsatisfactory conditions and
require remedy.
This appropriation is needed to
provide that remedy for Dan's
done billiards Committee long
property damage and in some
cases loss of life that will be
costly and detrimental to our
seats communities this
appropriation can help remediate
the risk of damages by taking a
proactive approach and repairing
and strengthening our dams
before a breach occurs Ms
provide a multitude of benefits
including promoting agricultural
sustainability by assisting
farmers and you're getting
cropland replenishing depleted
offers and providing recreation
opportunities to enhance
economic development for these
many reasons we stand in support
of this legislation and thank
senator combos for caring.
Thank you Mr.
We'll go to the are there any
other opponents or proponents
okay now we'll go ahead and go
to the committee.
Committee members are there any
questions on this bill madam
chair.
Yes Sir survivors chair.
Okay do I hear a second also
Senator Gallegos and couldn't
get the way to move my hand up
but I I do have a couple
questions from sponsor if you're
looking the concerned Campos.
Of course Senator Gallegos
please please ask your question.
Thank you madam chair center
Campos about six years ago I was
talking to the court building
chairs and some of the US
military and they brought up how
for New Mexico was in
understanding you you're gonna
have million dollars do you
think.
Do I guess my question to you
would you have a timeline on
repairs I don't know if the
state engineer would be able to
appropriate that entire amount
in FY twenty two and I was just
wondering if you does with them
if they have any ideas complete
with taking and how all.
So thank you very much madam
chair Senator Gallegos as we
move forward of the anticipation
is that this definitely needs to
be rolled out possibly over a
period of five years and maybe
even longer depending on the
course of the expertise that's
available the work that is
needed so within that what we've
been doing over the last several
years is either appropriating a
minimal amount of million
dollars and possibly this year
the LFC has recommended up with
five million dollars but again
that definitely is not enough
for us to continue with
rehabilitation so in terms of
the rollout it would be the
amount that we're able to secure
how we can continue to prepare
the most needed.
that was in the state that are
lacking as you will in the
course to provide for the
presentations we don't have lots
of property life.
So again the the time the roll
out is that something that we
work with I've been able to make
some repairs throughout the last
several years
the department there and I see
continues to diligently develop
as well these plans of by chance
your question and privative yes
we are looking at the roll out
and how we can continue to
ensure that those resources are
used efficiently and and to also
ensure that the plans are not
outdated so we just need more
resources as we move forward to
take care of our.
The dam repairs throughout the
state thank you.
Thank you senator Senator
Gallegos do you have anything
else.
Just so we just Madam chair and
senator I appreciate all you do
I think this is one of those
points that we need to stop
inspecting the start doing the
rehab so I appreciate all the
vote yes on your bill good luck
and we look forward to having
some safe bridges in New Mexico.
Madam o'neill thank you senator
senator us committees.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you senator for for this bill
Just to get back question on
December Gallegos I mean at as
I'm reading this appropriation
bill I I get the the twenty
twenty to issue but it says
unexpended or for on in convert
ballots and so.
It sounds to me based on the
presentation of your bill that
the office of the state
engineer.
Already has a list.
The project's kind of ready to
go at least that's the
impression I get it so.
We would be it is far as the
unencumbered balance I mean if
they just there have a list of
things to go.
I I I guess I just don't have a
little bit of a concern that I
mean they if they have a list
ready to go.
Number those balances corrected
me what what's the problem there
thank you very much madam chair
of Senators committees the
bottom line was that is or about
seventy dams in New Mexico right
now that are the high risk level
in terms of the need for repair.
And in order for us to move
forward of course that list is
is available the total estimate
today is about three hundred
million dollars in terms of
resources necessary in order for
us to rehabilitate those seventy
dams and as we continue to fall
behind with a lack of resources
that list continues to escalate
so I can share with you as we
move forward that there is a
need we have the
planning design ready to go on
many of our that projects are
and so this definitely can move
forward so it sets a point well
taken thank you madam chair
thank you centers needs.
Okay thank you madam chair
senator.
Madam center yes I I just when I
read the FIR it it just.
They they have this concern
there but if there's a project
like it like you said they're
seventy projects ready to go I
think they can Cumber
the you know those that that
money pretty quickly
and and just one last question
so that I'm happy obviously I'm
as Senator on this and said you
know we we don't have expertise
and all these all these areas I
certainly don't have expertise
in dams although I do have a
very good friend use a
structural engineer this is his
job is looking at the sailors
and potential failures but I'm.
I'm just thinking of the list
the loss of life loss of human
life has been mentioned but
obviously there's gonna be a
lost Animalize animal habitats
I don't know if we have any
hydroelectric you're not
drinking water issues and all
kinds of you know erosion issues
I think there's just a lot of
issues I can think of that could
be at play here but I just have
a.
And I get the loss of life issue
but what about liability here I
mean if if we have a dam failure
who who who who would be liable
for destructive loss of life or
destruction of even if it's a
public land
destruction meaning I mean do we
have is there the state have
insurance in place or what what
are we talking about risk wise
if we if we don't get this bill
into the budget this year.
Thank you very much of Madam
chairman we're Senators meetings
it's a it's an excellent
question because the list of
high risk dams in the state of
New Mexico continues to grow so
we know where those.
Particular projects are
necessary what I want to do is
I'll defer to possibly Mr Romero
or Mr Johnson in terms of the
liability aspect of it and how
they're addressing that directly
through the OSC again it's a
very significant question
because people don't know that
high exposure to our downs are
here in New Mexico particularly
for a ring major issues of
course structure of quality of
water and then the quality of
the environment but if I may
madam chair again defer to the
people who are available for
questions from the OSC.
Mr Thompson Mr chairman.
Here in the Senator we do I
guess that is the question about
liability the owner of the
particular structure young or
owner of the particular gam will
be the party that would be
liable for any losses associated
with the failure of loss or loss
of reservoir so many cases in
New Mexico that is a
municipality
which a city or a interrogation
district in some cases there are
Water Street district so water
conservation districts that have
responsibility for maintaining
owning and maintaining their
downs so those are the folks
that are.
The liable for losses.
Well thank you madam chair thank
you for that answer that answers
my question I I certainly
support this bill and I for for
me.
this is this is really the are
the biggest role for for
government I I I've said this
before I think this committee I
might my biggest rules for
government public safety and
infrastructure roads bridges and
dance
and I'd like to spend less time
on some of these other.
You know social issues and other
things that we've brought it to
a bigger government scheme and I
I think that this is really this
budget every New Mexicans are
these types of projects I'm very
pleased that Senator Campos
you're you're hearing this
appropriation bill I really hope
we we get to it we had some
my my my parents at some
issues about with with dams.
In in their neighborhood where
they live.
There were some flooding issues
and in this is a huge scare me
this can affect people's
livelihoods if it's the only
home they own this can greatly
affect people's property tax
prop property valuation and
those sorts of things so I
really really hope
this legislature can get moving
on this funding and I strongly
support today so thank you Sir.
Yes meetings are remiss US
senators about this you ready
with your motion.
As you said to step away for a
minute so I would make the
motion for do pass.
Okay is.
Also.
With that senator renewable.
Myself and diagnosed both
seconded either one okay.
Madam chair and I'm here for the
vote.
Okay so we have a a motion by
Senator Stefanics in a second by
Senator renewable
would you call the roll please.
Monday's yes Senator Gallegos.
Hamblin yes.
Bill yes.
Senator pope.
Just Senator souls.
Senator Smitty yes Senator
Sedillo Lopez yes.
You Mr CENIC's yes.
Unanimous.
You got your do pass that.
Madam chair yes Campos has the
bill in two more slots why don't
you take Senate bill two
fourteen as well.
Thank you Senator Campos are you
ready to present SB two fourteen
thank you very much madam chair
I yes I am and to the members of
the committee again I thank you
very much for the concerns are
expressed as we move forward for
our safety this is another one
of those issues as we move
forward with.
Reserving if you will our water
system and this and goes
directly through the community
of Las Vegas over the years we
have done is we've worked to
make improvements and in essence
what is occurring in Las Vegas
many years back there was a
slide our water came through the
center of the community and
destroyed many of the structures
and property along this pathway
we're very fortunate that there
was not loss of life but there
were there was a loss of animal
life of another human life so as
we move forward our our we
started with the plan and design
and and in increments the
construction of the twenty four
inch pipeline through the
community of Las Vegas but
that's what stand if you will
the larger pipeline verses if
you will.
Smaller one within that what
we're seeking now of course is
about seven hundred ninety five
thousand dollars to complete the
pipeline to the community of
this is also coordinated through
the US secretary Los Vegas.
A second committee and as they
move forward as a receive
resources of a do the
construction and improvements
working alongside the department
of transportation because the
IDOT does have property within
the pathway of the pipeline in
Las Vegas they've been very
cooperative of the residents
have been cooperative in a
course the second users have
been cooperative.
With that madam chair members of
the committee and again this
would be another one of the
appropriations bills that would
be going to the Senate finance
and again looking at the
nonrecurring resources through
capital outlay and through that
dispersion process that's for
for instance this was to be
successful and make it through
this committee ahead the in that
direction so with that madam
chair members of the committee
are just very quickly I believe
there may be one or two
our experts to deal directly
with this project that are
available for.
A recent comment and then the.
Would be available for questions
chair.
Who are your experts Madam chair

seventy three.
Is Senator with your.
Good morning everybody tell you

and make this an easy one for
you.
How close do you work this is a
house Senate bill one seventy
three percent closed would you
like to be to your provider of
food.
Would you like to know who that
is would you like to know them
personally.
I've got a bill here that's
asking for an appropriation of a
hundred fifty thousand dollars
and it is about how we can.
Or a process to have a meat
processing.
And marketing program to New
Mexico State University I do
need this to be with the
property the state service to
help those ranchers get closer
to the consumer so you all know
that those animals that you.
Are are put on your table are
are sure not where you one right
so that's pretty well what my
bill does I stand for any
questions madam chairman.
Thank you Senator Woods are

Any proponents to this bill.
Okay Lawrence I see Lauren
Patterson would you and yourself

Thank you thank you Mr Paterson
ms Rivera.
Madam chair members of the

the opportunity to come in this

how effective their marketing
programs have been in the state
and we look forward to the
development and implementation

excellent beef that are states
renter's produce further we
appreciate the sponsor caring

Watson thank you committee
members.
Thank you Mr.
So seem no no whether a
proponents or opponents we'll go
to the committee Senator
Hamblen.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you committee the center website
you know I always appreciate the
stuff that you do to help keep
money in our state and in our
community and I think what what
you you know I'm very much in
favor of this as before I don't
like money going out of our
state and if we can support
local jobs and keep money here
in our communities and also help
support some of our industry I
think that's really important to
do so I do appreciate you
bringing this forward and look
forward to supporting this
legislation thank you senator
thank you madam chair thank you.
Thank you Senators maybe.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you senator I just want to make
sure I understood what this bill
is due
My question you can see stems
from a constituent that I have.
Who has been going up to
Colorado to get his meat
process.
So this bill I see it's a
relatively small appropriation
this is this is obviously not.
Establishing the.
Eight eight a state level
meat processing program is it is
that right or I I guess what I'm
trying to understand is I I know
that we have the process
you know do that.
You know ranchers and farmers
and all kinds of people that are
going out of state so kind of
piggy back on center and what's
question what what what is this
bill actually doing that to
keep.
these folks to say get their
meat processed in New Mexico.
Yes madam chairman and senator
ready at this may explain this
to our maybe to your
satisfaction what we're trying
to do is find the buyer and the
seller.
And put them together.
So instead of
I know the FIR talked about need
inspection it talked about H.
based lot records thank god
nothing to do with this what I'm
trying to do is to develop a
list of people.
That would be well and to sell
be directly to the consumer and
a number the the consumers to
buy the beef directly from the
producer.
Now the processing part is is
that.
In that.
That
We have to have when you sell
retail cuts.
In the United States you have to
have a federally inspected.
To sell say in a grocery store.
Right now.
Once a day right now.
I can sell you an animal.
And there are testing custom
processing plants in the state.
That process that and will cut
it up wrap it up reason for you
to pick up.
And that allows you to buy
directly from me.
And those plans are still
inspected but they're not
inspected to the degree of an
individual cut.
So when you talk about people
going up to Colorado by animals
a lot of it is that we have very
few processors in the state the
other part of it is we don't
have any
we have very few processors in
the state that can.
Process I'm not Catholic one
day's time to make it profitable
to sell retail cuts into a
grocery store.
I'm hope that that may be what
you're asking but if it's not
please ask again madam chair.
Senator okay.
Thank you madam chair Senators
meetings that we are going to
have a hard stop at
At noon so that people can
travel so if we could keep these
questions brief.
Sure sure I yeah I just let me
narrow this and I'm sure it's
center so I'm I guess what I'm
really getting at is I want to
make sure that you know we we
because sometimes we appropriate
we appropriate money.
That we can't stand up.
Utilizing it because there's an
obstacle rope Walker some
federal regulation that's really
where I'm coming out this
question is.
With my limited understanding of
meat processing issue where we
have these federal regulations
from the USDA and so with the
bill online twenty two twenty
three it says to expand local
processing of beef and so I'm
just wanting to ensure that it
this this money is appropriated.
That we we have the I guess the
legal.
Regulatory ability to expand our
our local process it be for that
that's not going to be some
downstream obstacle is the
diesel on getting out center.
Madam chairman and senator
Smitty I I do understand the
question.
I'll put it this way.
We've got a lot of we've got not
a lot we got several custom
processing plants in the state.
What we need is is more state
inspected processing plants so
that if you want to buy from me
State.
Instead of the whole car the
homeland.
Maybe you're right maybe you
would like to buy the Havre.
So I'm I'm trying to I'm trying
to create demand.
And supplied with this program.
I think the biggest man will
come in once he does the demand
and supply is there.
We can you know the meat
inspection part of it we can get
federal inspectors today now
there's another bill that talks
about meat inspection but this
is not talking about meat
inspection this is trying to
create supply and the more much
what.
These are the bills would talk
about Leda and all these of the
deals that we're trying to
create the Mandall and and
supplier whatever this is
Senator.
On
own meat let's say we raise a
lot of sheep in the state to.
And some ghosts.
We should raise will go.
It was should round up in a
forced.
Oh wait a minute I'm.
You're getting the only you can
be on the scope of your bill
Senator Woods US senators
meetings I also want to say
there is a meat packing plant in
deland I'm sorry that your
friend had to go to Colorado the
any other question Senator Smith
he's.
You know I I think I get the the
overall meaning of of what the
Senator is accomplishing what
this appropriation so thank you
center was appreciate the
presentation definitely look
forward to support.
Thank you senator souls.
Thank you madam chair and and
senator I think it's a great
bill I have every year I buy
this year we bought a hog from
the the for eight years and
there is a person that'll
process should be about forty
miles from the but we had to
wait five to six months in order
for them to have an opening they
are overwhelmed we don't have
nearly enough and yet this that
also allows to buy individual
cuts rather carcasses no I'm all
in and the more we can do that
and I have to tell you the best
sausage I've ever had does they
have.
Locally up locally cut prepared
in such as it's a wonderful
thing and so the more we can do
that we're all it.
Thank you with no other
questions from the committee
yes Senator Gallegos.
Senator sorry it's still cameras
by and are working a couple of
questions for the center if I
may.
Mr guys go ahead Senator
Gallegos.
Madam chair and senator I was
listening to the debate with
center strategies and I was
wondering if this bill is
working in cooperation with
Senator Pirtle.
Senate bill one eighteen and I
just wondered if stocks are
closely aligned.
Madam chairman actually we're
not working in tandem with any
of the bill this is trying to
create a marketing system within
our state to our to our New
Mexico State University of
corporate extension service so
not in particular and are
working with Senator birds Bill.
Okay.
my next question then is you
know how long it would take the
Department to institute this
program Senator Pirtle actually
does but what amount that I
think you may advertise where
you can buy make program I like
the idea of like I'm just I
don't know of anyone in the
county that the I can see your
bill helping with that and just
wondered if you had a time line
on.
Madam chairman no I do not have
a time line on about that and
they were we're on the
caprock at Raglan that sales are
beef also grassfed beef he's
having a terrible time finding
someplace to to distract us just
the the the plant there and
point under is one year behind.
Our.
You know the demand is there we
just need to get the word out
that the demand is there and I
think we'll have.
More make action plans come in I
know they're talking to Mason
lands college there and into can
carry to try to develop you know
our our of a meat packing State
I'm a meat cutting school.
So that we can teach the curry
so we can you know there's so
many things that that have been
lost to the years.
Madam chair.
Just.
Thank you for this Eunice had a
A locker plant years ago and it
shut down your password in the
family didn't want to continue
going on but I just want to
thank you madam and for your
bill thank you really good I'm
huge John lamb right on land
Colorado and I'd be very
interesting twenty one year
market for lamb so with that
chair I will yield thank you
Santo Daime.
Senator thank you senator
Senator is a fund this thank you
madam chair nothing but the
singing to the choir here's
Senator was but but let me just
add a couple of things are you
all over the expression value
added value added in our
agriculture I want to commend
secretary Keyes is been down to
see us and others realize that
really is what this is about is
adding value to what were
already cruising here in New
Mexico let me give you a couple
of thoughts for the committee
this year for the second year in
a row New Mexico with the
largest Bakan producing state in
the country we prefer to two
years now surpassed Georgia.
But get this all the because we
grow here although there were
the largest in the country
they'll go to Texas which is
where they're all being
processed and stored that we
ship Amanda don't count in the
C. doctor over el Paso where
were their process and store
that's because frankly they get
them of superior business
climate there and and while I
support our wage laws in our our
labor laws and so for the New
Mexico the reality is our
economy down there is so in a
related that the it's it's
easier and more profitable this
and all that agriculture over
till passing to be processed so
what you doing here Sir what is
the right idea the more we can
take our New Mexico produce
whether it's chilly becomse will
meet whatever may be and then
our value here by processing it
packaging it selling and
marketing at all of those give
us the opportunity to increase
and improve our economy we all
talk about diversifying we also
talk about the improving the
private sector you're doing it
so I just want to add a little
bit of information for the
benefit of the committee thank
you madam chair.
On the Senator so Stefanics.
madam chair you ready for
motion.

Questions Senator Stefanics yes

dollars small amount Lawrence
The New Mexico grown program for
senior centers this was a
program within San Juan Sapporo
and Santa Fe counties is served
approximately a hundred to a
thousand meals to seniors
incorporating New Mexico grown
produce so this bill would go on
and would serve many more
counties many more senior
centers in addition it would
also provide business for many
of our farmers in the state of
New Mexico.

speak today.
I'm my name is Erica Rovers and

Senate bill one eighty five New
Mexico grown produce and senior
centers sponsored by Senator
Stefanics this bill is a lan for
feeding the most vulnerable and
food insecure in New Mexico are
senior citizens as well as a win
for the growers providing fresh
produce for senior centers we
know that providing fresh fruits
and vegetables grown right here
in New Mexico has been extremely
successful in our farm to school
program it makes sense to extend
to the most in need of
assistance with access to food
as an organization that convenes
farmers ranchers food banks
teachers parents and others in
the food sector we see programs
that connect growers directly to
consumers is beneficial for all
for these reasons we ask that

think Senator Stefanics for
bringing this legislation
forward.

Thank you Travis mackenzie do
you have anything that hasn't
already been said.
I thank you and I'll be quick
because you guys have been
working at I've just been on the
line I just wanted to shout out
in the future of Polk middle
school and I just wanted to let
you guys know that we did a
youth provided training in
collaboration with the New
Mexico Food neck Policy Council
and we're teaching our students
about the legislative process
they wrote letters I emailed it
yesterday so I hope they can
check it out but we are in
complete support of this
legislation many of our students
are multi generational
households and any New Mexico
grown produce we can get in our
senior meals in our students
school meals early childhood
there's there's some legislation
happening this year in regards
to all those we hope you guys
support it helps our local
economy it helps everyone and
health and wellness is so
important if anybody deserves it
it's our elders it's our
children and we need to do
everything we can to strengthen
our local food system and we
just appreciate you guys I wish
we could bring our kids up there
like we normally do it's
different virtually but we are
continue doing to teach about
how democracy works in New
Mexico we appreciate all your
service and leadership handling
the many issues that you guys do
and hopefully you guys can
support all the bills that are
supporting locally grown food
and healthy soils and education
work around sustainable
agriculture and and Education
thank you.
Thank you Mr mackenzie you did
have something to and thank you
for all the work you do to
educate our kids madam chair we
do also have Monica B. to and
Pamela really.
Okay miss a beat that and.
And Pamela Roy please limit
yourself to anything that is not
already been said because we
have a hard stop at at the New.
Thank you very much thank you at
to the committee I'm Monica
Beighton director of the north
central New Mexico economic
development district we are the
parent organization for the non
metro area agency on aging we
oversee fifty five of providers
of aging programs including
nutrition programs throughout
the state in all counties except
for Bernalillo and we work with
a hundred over a hundred and
fifty senior centers and we're
very excited to expand this
program to more senior centers
throughout the state we commend
Hammond farm to table for all
the great work she's been doing
and I just want to emphasize
that this is a great program
because it state funded the
other nutrition programs we do
our under the older Americans
act they have some limitations
around them that make it a
little bit difficult for seniors
to climb to locally grown
produce into them so this are
being a state funding source
allows us to really expand and
do some innovative things with
nutrition so we stand in strong
support of this bill thank you
for your time thank you Mr right
that and is Roy.
Madam chair committee members
who want to thank the Senator
Stefanics and Representative
Gail Armstrong for bringing this
bill forward again and with the
idea that it would be statewide
my names Cameron I am here
representing the New Mexico food
and agriculture policy council
is one of our very top
priorities I'm also representing
from the table as a partner in
this work as organization the
work with New Mexico farmers
marketing association and I'm
gonna go to the network that
help to actually the supply and
provide the opportunity for it
the three counties alright the
pilot project to buy local and
and then a special program that
represented Mr Wagner mentioned
with the senior centers we know
that this has a multiplier
effect and also it is supported
by what's called the New Mexico
ground inter agency task force
we now have I agencies along
with aging long term services
public
at the health and health
agriculture early childhood
education and the public
education department that are
focusing on this New Mexico
grown program as a permanent
program across all generations
and so we fully hope for your
support thank you very much for
the time today.
Thank you miss Roy
are there any other well I think
we've gotten plenty of support
and I don't believe there any
opponents driver is that
correct.
Yes correct.
Okay so we'll turn it over to
the committee.
Senator.
All of Senator guy was all
calling you right after Senator
have I I understand you can't
rostrum.
Representative.
This is actually madam chair
this is actually just a COVID
I'm as as a Senator Stefanics
knows that that I'm a big
supporter of keeping money in
our community in support and
supporting local farmers and
local businesses and I'm always
tickled to see miss Wagner and
missed Rivera on these calls and
because I know that we all
really follow the same values I
do see that this is a great
opportunity to develop more
collaborations that are already
in place
and just as a heads up I'll be
bringing up the healthy food
financing act that will also be
able to support a program like
this with allowing folks in
rural communities to grow
healthy produce especially for
our older population so I
appreciate it might might
comment really mainly is to
demonstrate appreciation for
Senator Stefanics for bringing
forth this legislation and I'm
very excited to be able to go to
a to pass on this.
Thank you.
Senator Gallegos.
Thank you madam chair and madam
chair I'm just wondering and I
appreciate this I really like
the idea behind this but I'm
wondering have the distribution
to rural New Mexico's gonna be
handled is their own
organization already in place or
is that something we're gonna
have to work on.
Madam chair senator the non
metro triple eight does work
with the approved at farmers and
the farmers in our state who
want to sell.
You need to go through a food
certification program which is
now online just so that it is
convenient to everyone and the
purpose is to make sure that the
sale is of state produce fruits
and vegetables the senior
centers and they also receive in
a separate program but it's
related they also receive
vouchers to go to the farmers
markets into go to stores that
are certified to buy locally
produced fruits and vegetables
so currently we have sixty nine
farmers in the program and I'm
sure that we will continue to
expand them as we expand
throughout the state but there
wasn't that's the problem with
the start up.
Of the pilot was really about
the money and the state agency
and once it got going it became
very successful and we'd love to
move it to more than three
counties.
Thank you madam chair thank you.
Madam chair just one more
question
and I appreciate that but with
that same organization be doing
the one that's going to ensure
that its New Mexico produce a
spot.
Monica rate of who is the non
metro triple a speak to that
Senator and madam chair.
Is that Miss America.
Madam chair Senator Gallegos I
think actually Pam could speak
to this little better than I but
because Pam is the farm to table
kind of has that network of
farmers in place they have a
certified vendors list they make
sure all of those are
certifications and all those
qualifications are met among the
farmers and then what we do is
we try and connect our senior
programs to Pam so that she can
basically make the match making
fed with the farmers so I think
the fact that you have the
network in place
Basically that's what you're
suggesting.
It doesn't are forced every
single senior center to go out
on their own and look for fresh
locally grown produce they can
actually plug into Pam's
infrastructure and provide
produce even if there isn't a
farmer in the county for example
the Oak Ridge.
Okay great.
Thank you right.
Okay.
Madam chair committee members
and senator guy it goes yes is a
patient really got that right so
and since the panic said we do
have a network of farmers and
we're coordinated with a
critical to a network with New
Mexico farmers marketing
association can actually with
public distribution I was a
public but of providers such as
a Pueblo fruits the R. eighty
large distributor fruits
vegetables they buy local
they're helping us get produces
schools we can get produce out
to the smallest communities and
one of the things that we work
really hard at is to hook up for
numbers that are really close by
to senior centers to schools and
now we're all hoping to get this
program and early childhood
education programs as well so
we've got extremely strong
partners in this effort this is
a growing initiative
we want to make sure that our
fastest growing population which
is seniors are well provided and
I will say they love to put this
they loved it and so many of
those meals this happened during
the pandemic and during the
winter and we spent every single
dime and seniors love to be able
to get fresh beautiful lettuce
and tomatoes and things from our
growers were able to supply
through the winter that's
another thing that sometimes
people ask we have farmers are
growing year round in New Mexico
so we have a network and
municipalities to do this job
thanks thank you Mr right Mr
Senator Gallegos anything else.
Madam chair I just want to thank
both those ladies for answer my
question I think is a really
good project and good investment
for New Mexico so with that I
yield.
Thank you committee members do I

Cherry today I had a call about
