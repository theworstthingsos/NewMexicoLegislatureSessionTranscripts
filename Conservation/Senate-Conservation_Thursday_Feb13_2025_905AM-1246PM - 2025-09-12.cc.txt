The floor goes on at 11:30.
The center is the ranking member

forgetting here. OK, so Senator
Wood, Senator Munoz, please.
Senate Bill 139, Ron.
Thank you, Madam Chairman.
Ah, today I want to give you a
little background on Senate Bill
139.
In November 2023, the
environmental Improvement Board
adopted the California Event
Clean Car rules for New Mexico.
Which will be become in effect
in model year 2027.
Which is actually calendar year
2026.
The California Advanced Clean
Car rules require that 43% of
all vehicles available for sale
in New Mexico.
B 0 emission vehicles.
And this percentage increases 8%
each year until 2023 where the
mandate would require that 82%
of all vehicles available for
sale be zero emission vehicles.
I might make a note right here,
Madam Chairman.
It says all vehicles for sale in
New Mexico.
It doesn't say all vehicles
driven into Mexico. It does not
say that you cannot buy a
vehicles outside of the state of
New Mexico.
And drive in New Mexico.
And why I bring that particular.
Information up.
We've got 15,000 car salesmen in
the state of New Mexico.
At least some of those will not
be able to sell cars.
because of the demand won't be
there for them.
demand right now in the state of
New Mexico.
Is somewhere
Around
3%
And it is increased.
Less than 0.5% over 2 years.
The um
This bill is not about electric
vehicles, in fact, you will hear
testimony from automobile
dealers.
That they are very supportive of
electric vehicles and had
invested hundreds of $1000 in
EV.
Infrastructure tools and
trainings at their dealership.
The bill is about government
mandates where the government is
trying to tell on the Mexicans
what vehicles they should be
driving.
California clean
Car rule
Is an administrative rule.
Created by an unelected board in
California that was then adopted
by an unelected board in New
Mexico called the Environment
Improvement Board.
The environment Improvement
Board considered and adopted
this rule in November 2023 and
during the hearing.
Over 2400 New Mexicans provided
written comments to the EIB for
consideration.
Out of the 2400 written comments
submitted.
2164 opposed the rule.
248 supported the rule.
This equates to 90 over 89% of
all written comments submitted
by New Mexicans being opposed to
this rule.
The New Mexico legislature.
Has not had a say in this far
featuring rule.
Where we have 112.
Legislators
Voted by the people to represent
them. When this rule was passed.
The EIB is a seven-member board
when this row was passed.
One member
Wasn't we had one vacancy on the
board.
One member, abstained from
voting.
And the vote was 3 to 2 to
approve.
Think about this. We've got a 7
member board.
The 3 members voted to do this.
California Clean Car rule will
limit the choices of vehicles
and ultimately raise the price
of vehicles throughout New
Mexico.
The Mexicans deserve the right
to purchase the vehicle of their
choice based on their needs
budget, and lifestyle.
Why I say it will raise the
price of vehicles, Madam Chair.
Is simply
Under this rule,
We, the state, the
environmental.
Department can sue vehicle
manufacturers if they do not
provide these vehicles to us.
And they consume at a tune from
12 to $15,000 per vehicle.
But guess what?
There's a way they can offset
this.
They can buy credit.
From Guess who
Tesla.
They can buy a credit for
$12,000.
Think about this.
And our state that I'm
harped on several times this
year about how.
litigation goes on in our state,
how many newspaper and.
Advertisement we have from the
legal profession.
Think about what this rule does
for us again.
The other point I'd like to
Leave you with
Is that these rules have been
adopted.
Do nothing to prohibit New
Mexicans from purchasing their
vehicle of choice in another
state.
Registering in New Mexico and
drive them in New Mexico.
This will force the Mexicans to
travel 100s of miles to purchase
their vehicle out of state
meanwhile it would be hurting
the Mexican small businesses
that employ over 15,000 New
Mexicans.
Throughout New Mexico.
I'd like to introduce.
My expert witness can Ortiz,
executive director of the New
Mexico Automobile Dealers
Association and I would also
like to recognize who needs no
introduction, Senator Chairman.
Munoz.
Mr. President, oh, Mr. Chairman
and Mr. Chairman Madam Chair.
Would you like to say something?
Senator Munoz, please. I, I
think he's covered it all and
what it really comes down to is
how do you have market share
established, right?
You have Tesla on on private
lands and they're not in the
market.
And they're in bigger markets.
There's one north of Santa Fe,
there's one in, in uh Rio Rancho
or Bernard Leo out there.
But the market share is just not
establishing itself in the state
of New Mexico to to achieve
those goals.
I think the number one thing in
2022, there were 3% of the total
sales are an average of 2.65.
For 202022 and throwing in
hybrids just to to round up some
numbers, roughly 9% were
hybrids. Then we moved to 2023,
where the market share even
stays the same.
It went from 2.65 and 22 to 3.30
in 23 and 3.53 and 24.
But the hybrid.
Is
Holding at pretty much about 10%
over the three year average, so
the market share just hasn't
established out there. And so
when you don't have the market
share.
You can't achieve these goals.
They can't force somebody into
buying an EV because they have
standards they have to meet.
They have to have that choice
and even the hybrid market is
taking on just a slow as the EB
and kind of flattening.
Now, are people buying more new
cars? I mean, I don't know the
answer to that question.
But the choices are, are not
there and if you look in the
area where I live.
Um, there's probably
There's a couple of guys that
have Rivians and a couple Teslas
around. There's a couple of guys
that have Caribbeans.
And there's a couple of guys
that have Tesla, but in Gallup,
especially in the Navajo Nation,
they will just not purchase
those vehicles. Number one, they
don't probably have the power to
charge them at home.
2, they're heavy and especially
in mud and dirt roads, uh, and
they really can't afford them
and they can't afford to
maintain them if something
happens in the warranty's off.
Uh, just a few perspectives.
Thank you, man.
Thank you. And Mr. Ortiz, were
you gonna say something?
Madam Chair, thank you for the
opportunity, members. Good
morning. Um, I think Senator
Woods covered it all. I just
want to, uh, stress that our
dealers throughout the state,
there's 120 franchise auto
dealers, and they've invested
hundreds of thousands of dollars
in the tools, the training, the
charging infrastructure, and we
have vehicles available for sale
all day the technology is
getting better and you know,
looking back a couple of years
ago, I really wish that, you
know, the state of government
would have worked directly with
the
history for the proper
infrastructure, the proper
planning. So when New Mexico is
already, New Mexicans are ready
to buy their electric vehicles.
The the proper infrastructure is
there to get to and from the
destination.
Um, the last thing I'd like to
say is there's a lot of
industries in New Mexico that
depend on vehicles to haul
tools, supplies, livestock
throughout New Mexico and right
now, um, those electric vehicles
just aren't able to do that work
for the businesses, so just a
reminder we've been stuck at 3%
EBs for the last 36 months.
And
Uh, yeah, we're supposed to
increase that by over 1,000% by
43% by next year. And then
increasing that 8% each year
until 2032. So, um,
Uh, thank you for your uh time,
your consideration, and I'm
always here to answer any
questions.
And Madame Chair, just a couple
more things.
New
New Mexico has only 750.
Public
Available charging stations.
With over 17,000 EVs currently
registered in New Mexico.
And according to the California
Air Resources Board, they
recommend one publicly available
charging station for every 7 to
10 vehicles on the road.
With the current number of EVs
on the road in New Mexico, we
need.
Between 1700.
And 2400 EV charging stations.
And we need uh
How many more that we will need
in the future.
is considerably. We do not have
the infrastructure available at
the present to do this.
The budget is asking.
This year's budget we're asking
to help finance some more
charging stations, but we're so
far behind on the curve here
we're not gonna catch up in 6
months.
There is another law in place.
Besides this one that we will
fall on.
We are elected to go to a more
stringent law.
But there is a federal law that
we will fall under so to think
that we have no law in place if
we take this off.
Is a misnomer.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you all for your
presentation. Now we're gonna go
to the audience. How many people
are here to support this bill,
if you'd raise your hand,
there's one.
How many people are here to
oppose this bill.
On 23456, OK, online, how many
people to support.
2 online to support how many
people to oppose.
3 on line to oppose. OK, so the
people who support this bill, if
you'd come to the um center and
we have the microphone for you
to make a comment.
OK, how many, how many people
are gonna support, please just
come ahead and line up.
To support the bill.
Only one person's gonna speak.
OK.
So please go ahead. Thank you,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. I'm Carlos Santag,
president and CEO of the New
Mexico Business Coalition. We're
here in strong support of Senate
Bill 139.
Our goal in our work is to
assure that there are good
paying jobs in our state, so
people can be employed and feed
their families.
When we've got 15,000 jobs on
the line.
Because of the law that's
currently in place.
And objectives that we can't
meet.
This is the time to reconsider
that and take that off the
books.
Choice is a big deal for a lot
of people, so why not give them
the choice of what car they're
gonna drive.
And the 15,000 people employed
to give them the choice of where
they're going to work.
We cannot meet the requirements
of this law, and that's why we
support it. We, we need to
support New Mexicans. We need to
give them a choice of what they
drive and where they work, and
we cannot afford as a state to
lose that many jobs.
So I urge you
To support this bill. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Anybody
else to support the bill.
OK, going online, he pulled to
support the bill who would like.
OK, Howard Hutchinson.
Nate Duckett and Travis Tillery,
please go ahead. Howard
Hutchinson.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Howard Hutchinson. I'm
registered lobbyist for the
coalition of Arizona and New
Mexico counties.
The models that have been
constructed to calculate the
life cycle of transportation
fuels.
Conveniently leave out important
factors in the calculations.
An insert in their place
assumptions without merit.
If properly calculated, there is
no possibility to achieve zero
emissions.
As Mark Twain, a famously stated
figures don't lie.
The restrictions on enforcement
contemplated by SB 139
recognized the fallacy of zero
carbon emission.
And the economic devastation
that will accrue to the citizens
of New Mexico if those
restrictions are enforced.
This is especially true for
rural residents and workers who
use heavy vehicles for
agriculture and construction.
Please support SB 39. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, uh, Nate Duckett.
Online?
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the Committee on
Farmington Mayor Nate Duckett. I
appreciate the opportunity to
speak here this morning. I'm in
support of SB 139, living here
in the Four Corners region of
our state. If you just look at
the demographics of San Juan
County and consider the number
of individuals who are currently
living in poverty in this area,
and the impact that this bill
will have on them and their
ability to find reliable forms
of transportation amidst a world
that no longer provides support
for their current automobiles or
their ability to purchase a.
affordable automobiles without
it being electric. Let us
further consider the lack of
infrastructure currently in
place here in San Juan County in
regards to providing services
specifically, especially for the
members of the Navajo Nation,
um, and our friends and families
who live out there. Uh, these
are serious considerations, and
it's very concerning to me that
we've allowed a board of
unelected individuals to mandate
something so important to an
entire state of people that is
already underneath the
unfortunate constraints and
continued.
increase in regulations and
dollars expected out of their
their personal pockets and put
them in a position where now not
only is it the cost of power
going to their home that's
increased by 50%, but it's gonna
be the cost associated with
purchasing new vehicles,
maintaining those vehicles and
finding places to run those
vehicles successfully here in
our state. It concerns me, um,
and here in the four corners as
well is that we do have other
communities and other states
that are nearby that will sell
vehicles, therefore pushing out
our
local auto dealers who provide
hundreds of jobs here in our
community. Um, I think this is
a, a consideration that needs to
be, you know, needs to be heard
at the level of our state
representatives in our Senate
because it's so important. This
isn't something that we can
simply leave to a board of
people where only 3 individuals
have passed this mandate.
So I stand in support of SB 139,
and I hope that all of you on
the committee will consider
that. Thank you.
Thank you very much and Travis
Tillery.
opposing
I mean it's supporting so sorry
supporting. Good morning,
everyone. Uh my name is Travis
Tillery. I am the general
manager at Tillery Chevrolet GMC
here in Moriarty. Um, I am
supporting um this bill here
because uh I'd like to start out
by saying that we have no issues
with selling electric vehicles.
Um, we do have customers, um,
that purchase electric vehicles,
we've invested hundreds of
thousands of dollars to support
the sale and the servicing of
these vehicles as well too. Um,
however, we do
have a a large portion of our
community here, um, is, is rural
and um we do sell a lot of uh
heavy duty trucks to ranchers
and farmers here in the area as
well too. Um.
This bill, uh, allows
Uh, these customers to have the
choice of vehicle um for their
needs and um that's ultimately
what this is all about, is we
want to make sure that New
Mexicans do have the uh proper
vehicles to to fit their needs
um for their lifestyles and, um,
frankly for a large portion of
New Mexicans and electric
vehicles, um, the way they
currently are, uh, structured,
um, are not suitable for, uh,
for those people. Um, so I, I do
stand stand in support of this
bill.
Thank you very much. Is there
anybody else in the audience
that wishes to support this
bill.
OK, now we'll go to the
opposition. If the opposition
would line up.
And online I have two people who
want to speak.
So we're gonna start online
Athena Christoullo.
Chair, committee, thank you for
the uh bringing this forward.
Um, I am a long time EV driver.
In fact, for 10 years, I have
not pumped gas. I have simply
plugged into my wall.
In order to fuel my vehicle, the
only maintenance I've ever had
to do is to change the battery,
and no, not the big one, but the
little 12 volt one.
Relatively speaking.
I have fought for the right for
our citizens to get.
Electric vehicles for years, and
this bill would keep us from
getting that right to a choice
whenever I've gone on.
To visit different um um
watching a jiggers. Oh my gosh,
I don't know why this word, uh,
dealerships to look and test
drive for vehicles, there's
maybe been one or two available
and when I've gotten my vehicle
at a dealership, my electric
vehicle at a dealership. I was
not treated very well. So I am
just in opposition of this bill
as it rolls back.
The options for our state to
transition to new technology
and.
Encourage new jobs. Thank you.
Thank you very much and the 2nd
1 online is Christie and Dan.
He would uh introduce yourself
so we could have it for the
record, please.
Yes
Good morning, Madam Chair.
Committee. My name is Daniel
Pritchard. I live in Taos.
I've been driving an electric
vehicle since 2019, and it is by
far the best vehicle I've ever
owned. I believe it's
disingenuous to assert that
15,000 car salespersons will
lose their jobs.
Um, there, there's, there's just
so has been stated, there's a,
there is a big need for gasoline
and diesel powered vehicles and
EVs are not there yet, however,
um, evenings require essentially
zero maintenance and are clearly
the best choice for low income
residents as the costs come down
on batteries and the electric
vehicles themselves. It's also
true that 80 to 90% of EV owners
charge at home.
where the electricity is the
cheapest, so, um, we, we elected
our representatives and our
senators here to be forward
thinking let's look to the
future 5 to 10 years, and
clearly low, low, low
maintenance vehicles,
electrification is beneficial to
everyone. Thank you for your
attention.
Thank you. So we're going to the
room now. Please go ahead,
Camilla.
And this is uh opposition. Thank
you, Madam Chair, members of the
committee. I'm Camilla Feibelman
standing in opposition to the
bill.
This has been, uh, governor's
priority to do something about
the 2nd largest source of
greenhouse gas emissions in this
state. The manufacturers support
the rules that bring more
electric vehicles to this state
to help give consumers a choice.
The rules do not say where the
cars have to be sent. They can
be sent to the places where
there's the demand for the cars,
and there is a huge buildout of
the infrastructure to support
these cars, but auto dealers,
unfortunately want to sell you
what they want to sell you, not
what you want. Our chair went to
buy a Chevy Bolt at a local
dealership and was aggressively
discouraged from purchasing the
vehicle by the manager. My
husband and I
attempted to buy an EV locally 2
weeks ago.
And could only find the most
expensive brands of cars on the
lots when we asked to do what
I'd done with the Toyota Corolla
to build out our own car with
the bells and whistles that we
did and didn't want. We were
told they had no capacity to do
it, and they wouldn't. We have
had member after member come to
us asking how we can help them
find the vehicles they want,
because unfortunately, so many
dealers are
are unwilling to put, um, these
cars on the lot. Thank you.
Thank you. Next, Sharon.
Good morning Miss
Miss Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is Sharon
Argennright. I'm a nurse for
many years, retired Air Force
officer.
I align with Greta Turnberg.
350.org. Bill McKibben, Al Gore,
and The Inconvenient Truth, new
energy economy, yucca, no false
solutions, children, uh,
environmental justice, social
justice, and I, um, asked you to
vote for this bill. I rented an
EV and
I couldn't believe the
difference.
I was kind of put off.
When I had to return it and use
my Prius again.
Please support this bill. Thank
you.
Uh, Sharon, you said to support
the bill.
Thank you.
Next, please go ahead.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee.
My name is Ona Porter. I am the
founder Emerita and the Clean
Energy leader for Prosperity
Works.
And I am known uh among my
colleagues, my neighbors, my
friends as a person who has 2
EVs in our family.
One of those interestingly is is
owned by our granddaughter who
has cerebral palsy and makes $16
an hour.
But she could afford it because
she saved some money and she got
into a lease that was affordable
and in the 3 years she had that
car, it cost her $4.27 for
everything.
We bought new windshield wiper
fluid.
So
One of the things that is really
concerning to me is what Camilla
was talking about, how many
times people go to a dealership
interested in an EV and are
discouraged in that regard. And
I'm told those stories all the
time, most recently by a staff
member.
And she went and she was very
clear about what she wanted and
they said no we can't do that
and we can't do that and we
can't do that, and so she left
with a car that she didn't want
to have, and then two days later
she got the material from the
dealership about um what she
might have done.
It was material about electric
vehicles.
One of the things that is very
concerning is that people go
into a dealership and they find
people who are discouraging them
and very few salespeople who
know anything about EVs, and I
think training in the
dealerships is a major issue.
And I wish you will vote no on
this bill. We need to be.
Guiding towards the future, and
this bill takes us there. Thank
you.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Osa Chavez. I'm the ED for NM
Native vote. We are in deep
opposition of this bill for a
number of reasons. Our community
has been encouraging us to help
find funds to create
infrastructure for EV vehicles,
including EV trucks. We believe
in these types of vehicles so
much that we put in EV charger
in front of our offices in
Albuquerque to help support our
community members and our staff
members who choose to purchase
these vehicles.
If you love driving cars, drive
one with the with the gas and
the battery um uh moving these
vehicles, they are very fun to
drive and they're very easy to
maintain. This bill takes us in
the absolute wrong direction the
community has told us they want
to go, and I urge you to please
consider what we need to do to
help our um automotive sellers
to be able to and dealers to be
able to create uh more
opportunities for
communities. I used to sell
cars. It's not that hard to
learn the type of technology
that you need to support these
types of vehicles in the
community, and there's so much
safer. They hum very nicely like
a little angels, um, just around
you, and they're just really
pleasurable to drive, and I urge
you guys to try one, so that you
see how well these vehicles are
maintained and how easy it is
to, to transition to this type
of transportation. I think it's
what our children are looking
for.
in the future, and a lot of the
folks that I work with that are
youth in the community are
really excited about these types
of
so that we are looking at what
we can do to limit um the, the
emissions from these uh gas
operated vehicles. So with that
being said and with uh some of
our um our other folks have
mentioned, I really urge you to
oppose this bill. Thank you so
much.
Thank you and last.
I, uh, good morning, Madam Chair
and committee members. My name
is Glenn Weel with Third A New
Mexico. Um, I own a six year old
Chevy Bolt, and I have driven it
to Houston to Tucson to Denver,
um, and I have not found a lack
of charging stations because
right now, as we say, I don't
know what the small number of
EVs on the road. There are
plenty of charging stations. And
what I find is every month, the
Department of Transportation
adds another 8 chargers at one
of their locations somewhere in
the state. There's
a brand new one in Albuquerque.
There's a brand new one in Cuba,
um, and they're keeping up with
the demand, um, there's a lot of
money as you heard, going into
new charging stations, so I'm
not concerned about
infrastructure so I can drive my
car around. Um, I also wanted to
add that
Uh, the California rule that
these are based on was
negotiated by the auto industry,
by the major auto players in the
United States because they know
EVs are their future. They need
to keep up with China if the
United States does not keep up
with the EV sales and
development and markets our auto
industry is going to disappear.
So what the dealers are not
telling you is they're actually
going against their
Uh, they're manufacturers that
are providing their vehicles.
Um,
So I just want to encourage you
to uh help the industry and help
the United States, boost the
number of EV sales, improve the
environment and doing so and uh
move us into the future uh where
we're fighting climate change.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Now we'll
go to committee members for
comments and questions.
Anybody over here?
OK, we'll start with Senator
Suil Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I need
to disclose that I was, uh, no
longer, but I was the attorney
for the Air Quality Control
Board when um the air quality
control board considered these
regulations.
Um, so
I know a lot about this.
And I guess I'll start with my
first question about what this
would mean for federal funds, so
excuse me, do you have a
conflict of interest today. I do
not have a conflict of interest
today because I no longer
represent the board. Thank you
very much. Thank you.
Um, I
I quit, it's kind of a long
story, but I quit. Um, so
anyway, I, um,
I want to ask first, did you
have somebody with experience uh
with environmental.
Law review this to determine
what this would mean for um.
Our state implementation plan.
Which has to be approved by the
by the EPA and if it's not
approved, we're at risk of
losing substantial federal
transportation funds.
Um, and so did you have it
reviewed for compliance with,
with EPA.
State implement implementation
plan requirements.
Thank you for that question in
the back of the room, there's a
gentleman that's in an
environment department and I
would love to bring him up to
the front of the room and said
here, right beside me, and he
can feel those questions, Madam
Chair.
Thank you. Who is here from
NMED?
Maybe
Well, it would be a, a comment
first, uh, senator. We've had
several bills in our committee
where we would appreciate
participation by state agencies
and uh if they have a vested
interest in uh these topics, it
would be wise for them to come,
at least for technical
information.
Thank you. You still have the
floor, senator.
Thank you. Well,
I will tell you that.
When
So the state implementation plan
is the plan that is submitted on
a yearly basis to the EPA and
every year they approve it, and
it is a collection of laws and
regulations, um, in the state of
New Mexico that impact air
quality.
And taking away the authority of
the independent board.
Um, would violate some of the
requirements that the EPA has
and has had for decades about
independent boards. The idea of
these boards is that they are
not subject to the the the winds
of politics, but have expertise
and so these board members all
have expertise in environmental
law in engineering, uh, on the
airboard there, um, I think
we're 3 faculty members from
University of New Mexico.
With expertise in in air quality
in engineering, um, and so.
This
I, I very much and it and it's
interesting the way it's put in
the in the analysis, this pill
contradicts federal law and may
jeopardize federal funding.
That's all they put, but it's a
very, um, and the other thing
that's happening on the national
scene is my understanding that
the manufacturers who
collaborated with the Biden
administration, uh, um, and with
carb, the, the California Air
Quality Board in in doing this
regulations are asking the Trump
administration not to roll this.
back
Um, and it's because so many car
manufacturers have made
substantial investments in this.
Um, and the, the data that
appeared before the hearing,
what the, the, and, and I'm not
the board, um, they had to make
the decision. It was 90 by the
air quality control board, um,
the data that they saw was
really substantial about how New
Mexicans are not able to get um
clean cars and, and the issue
that the dealerships had was
they were afraid that they would
not be able to, um,
Get the orders to match what
they thought that the the.
Buyers would want, but there's
actually a state law in New
Mexico that says that dealers
that manufacturers made uh
cannot deliver what the
dealerships, and I'm sure the
dealerships got that put into
law a few years ago. I don't
know that it is illegal for
manufacturers to send cars that
the dealers don't want, so it's
up to the dealers about what
they order.
Um
The, the issue here is whether
manufacturers will send clean
cars to New Mexico.
And so far, we have a big
shortage of of clean cars in New
Mexico over and over. I know
when I got my car, which um.
When I got my car, uh, it was
very difficult to get a car like
the car I wanted, uh, here in
New Mexico.
Um, and so we, we did go, we
went to, to Colorado, um, and I
hate that because I want my
dollars to stay here.
So I think that and to me that
the manufacturers have agreed to
this and are asking the the
Trump administration not to roll
this back and because if we, if
we were to pass this, it would
jeopardize um
Federal funds, those are all
very practical reasons, um, not
to do this, um.
And then, of course,
There's the issue of the climate
and, and climate change, and I
believe, as you may be aware,
we're in danger of
non-attainment in the state of
New Mexico with the EPA
guidelines, and I think that
this, this would, if we could
transfer substantial numbers of
people to environment to either
remember this rule, the rule
that was passed allows plug-in
hybrids.
To, to, to, uh.
Satisfy this if we were to move
to plug-in hybrids and to
electric vehicles, we would.
We would probably um move the
needle a little bit with regard
to our status for
non-attainment.
So saying all of that, I, I
can't support your bill. Um, I
understand. I'm frustrated with
some of the agencies' decisions,
um, some of the rulemaking
decisions that have been made,
but once you delegate authority
and the legislature delegated
this authority.
In conjunction with the Federal
Clean Air Act decades ago.
Decades ago, these are these
boards are not new boards and
and they've been doing this kind
of work for decades. Um, they
made this, they made this
decision based on the evidence
they have. I know the car
dealers are appealing it. It
it's up on appeal. The Court of
Appeals did not grant what they
requested, which is a stay.
Um, of the rules, the court
thought that uh the court
specifically said they did not
think they had a good case on
the merits. So what I'm worried
about um senator with this bill
is it threatens.
Federal funds, um, and
significant, we get, my
understanding is we get a lot of
Department of Transportation
federal funds, and that would be
devastating for our state. So
for all those reasons, plus the
environmental reason. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you. Other questions,
comments, Senator Townsend.
Anybody else?
And Senator Rosel, go ahead,
Senator Townsend, thank you,
Madam Chair.
Senator, is there anything in
your bill that prevents a
Dealership from selling electric
vehicles.
going forward.
No.
Madam Chair, and
editor.
Do you believe the people of New
Mexico deserve.
choice.
believe it's a God-given right
to have.
Rejoice.
And you have that, you have that
opportunity in life to do.
This is just one
Government mandate that
restricts.
Right.
It restricts it in the way that
uh just as the ladies and the
gentlemen behind me was saying
it's not right.
a uh a car salesman.
Can tell me what I need to do. I
don't believe that they should
do that either.
I don't believe they should tell
any of you.
what to do.
And I know I'm preaching.
year.
answer the questions from now.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um,
senator.
It would appear to me.
Yeah
That the people of New Mexico go
out and try to buy things in
their businesses.
And whether you live
In the remote area like I do,
probably.
Senator Charlie, I don't know,
but in what is known as being
remote areas, you know, in rural
areas.
Um
We have to be really careful
mandating.
What doesn't work. People
They don't like their families
put in jeopardy.
They want to dial to the
Hospital or
Wherever they're going, that
that has a
Can making it.
Recently, I attended
Function in a number of our
dealers.
at
Most of them.
Not all of them, but there was a
large percentage from the
Albuquerque and, and
In Las Cruces districts where,
you know, the
The vast majority of population.
resides in their comments to me
were.
Don't kill it.
Make it an opportunity for
people to have toys.
But do not mandate.
That we have to sell so many
because what's happening
His people are leaving our
state.
Going to a surrounding state to
purchase what the meets their
needs.
And, and I think that's exactly
right. I don't think we should.
Ever limit
Uh, EVs coming into New Mexico,
but we have to meet the needs of
the people. That's our job.
And when I see.
Um
Yeah, that continually comes
forward in newspapers where you
see
Major car manufacturers backing
up.
On their production of EVs
because they can't sell them.
That tells me something.
And I think it should tell all
of us something.
And so, I'm, I am a staunch.
Do
Believerr that the people of New
Mexico deserve a choice.
And us mandating.
Because we have a personal
belief.
Of
religion or anything else.
is detrimental and it undermines
our credibility as being
represented job is not.
Tell people what they ought to
do. Our job is to come here and
represent the will of people,
and so,
I think the people have spoken.
I'm gonna continue to represent
them because
And
One pole
90% or 89% of the people.
Said they want to.
Senator, is there any reason why
we should believe that?
That
Um, this information coming back
from manufacturers and
dealerships is erroneous.
I don't believe it is.
we're getting truthful
information, but I would like.
Executive director of the
automobile dealers to speak to
that.
Mr. Ortiz, go ahead. Thank you,
Madam Chair, members of the
board, um, there was a lot said
by senators that Lopez and I'm
gonna respond to to a few
things, um, basically.
I'm sorry.
I'm, I'm sorry, do you mind
repeating?
Well, I'll add to it now.
Um, Madam Chair.
An expert witness, would you be
so kind?
Respond generally to the
statements of Senator Sadia
Lopez because of your expertise
in
And representing automobile
dealers.
My second question was, is there
any or my primary question was,
is there any reason that we
should believe that the data at
89% of New Mexicans want choice.
is erroneous.
Madam Chair, Senator Townsend,
not at all, um, where our office
did during the environmental
improvement board hearing is any
comment that was submitted to
the board for consideration was
reflected on the website. What
we did is we downloaded every
single written comment.
And we tallied.
The comments in support or in
opposition of the bill or the
rule adopted and after the
calculation, we came up with
just under 90%. It was
89.something of all New Mexicans
who submitted a comment to the
EIB that they were opposed to
the rules being adopted.
Now, Madam Chair, in response to
uh Senator Sios
that you are asked a question by
Senator Townsend to respond to.
That was it. Thank you.
Madam Chair, I did ask the
question to Senator Townsend
about
what it was he asked.
Senator Townsend, um,
Every state has an option,
basically has two choices. They
can adopt the Federal emissions
standards.
Or they can adopt what the
California Air Resources Board
adopted. So, um, the, the
comment about losing federal
funding in the FIR as well as
Senator Sio's comments. I'm not
sure where that's at. The only
thing I can think of is possibly
some incentives, uh, that the
federal government has passed
under the inflation reduction
Act to provide some um
incentives or rebates or tax
credits for the purchase of the
vehicles. There's
also been some awards for
electric vehicle charging
stations are awarded to the
state under the inflation
reduction Act. Now my
understanding is those are still
in effect, although there may be
some um opposition under the
Trump administration where why
should taxpayers subsidize
vehicle purchases out there. Um,
so I'm not sure where the
federal funding is referenced
to. I wish we had someone from
the New Mexico Environment
Department to reference that.
But what our national Auto
Dealers Association has
requested from the Trump
administration is not to just do
away with the federal incentives
because um
Across the nation, um, electric
vehicles are slower to sell for
the average um
The average time that a
traditional vehicle is averaging
on a dealer's lot before it
sells is about 30 to 45 days
before it sells where an
electric vehicle, unfortunately
is sitting over 100 days before
it sells, um.
So, so those are some of the
concerns out there, um.
The federal funding I'd love to
hear about that. And in
addition, the other comment
about clean air, you know, I
think we all care about clean
air.
However, there's nothing in this
rule.
answer
Question
Cos in about Senator Suil
Lopez's comments about enemy. I
think you're finished with your
response. If the senator wants
to pursue that, he can
certainly. Thank you.
Oh, Madam Chair, and um.
I, I appreciate your, your
on meals.
And I think the committee
process is
Understand what they're
representatives are doing and
how they're
Processing legislation.
Um
I, I think I'll, um,
I think I'll stop right here. I
think there's some more
comments, but at the same time,
I, you know.
Certainly, and Senator, I have
just asked that our secretary
call for somebody from NMED to
come to room 311. So if they do
come, we can pursue this
questioning as well and get it
straight from the horse's mouth.
OK, next I have Senator. Thank
you. I didn't mean to disparage
your horse.
OK.
I know.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much. I do think it's important
that somebody from the ED is
here to answer the questions
that we have because what they
have.
In essence done is they have
just bypassed the legislature,
legislative authority.
And they've done this through
rulemaking, and I have a big
problem with it because it was
executive order that this
actually came to be.
And Madam cheer.
Senator and senator, I
appreciate y'all bringing this
bill up because it is very
important. I do realize with the
strides that have been made as
far as electric vehicles go,
they are improving all the time.
But it is still
Every citizen in this room,
their choice whether they want
electric vehicle or not.
But whenever it's mandated,
whenever it will not be
beneficial for what I do for a
living.
Or for what anybody else in the
rural area has going on, I think
we're kind of disingenuous by.
Putting the blinders on if you
want to on that old horse and
uh.
Saying everybody needs one.
Madam Chair and senator and
senator.
Our
dealerships throughout the state
of New Mexico seeing the effect
of the mandate that was put in
place harming their business.
Man.
Madam Chair, I think the numbers
speak for themselves, I mean.
They're open a new line and just
call EVs and hybrids a new line,
and they're selling 2022 66,000
vehicles and 86,000 vehicles,
and you're only gaining 3% of
the market share.
I mean, that, that is telling
you what the consumer demands
and what the market share is. So
that currently doesn't exist the
way.
You're in business, the way you
have to make a profitable.
Lopez mentioned that she had to
go to to.
I'll rattle to buy an EV, well,
just the opposite will happen.
You go to Colorado to buy a gas
field.
In my line of business, even in
in the truck I drive, I may
drive 300 miles a day just
running job sites to job sites
running here running there.
There's no way I could spend an
extra hour sitting on the side
trying to charge a vehicle and.
Dui, there's one charger, but.
An hour to sit there and charge
to try to get home, it just in
certain circumstances in my
circumstance, it doesn't work.
You're talking about urban or
areas versus rural areas, the
market share will never reach
that. We'll never have the, the
power loads in New Mexico
because you're gonna hear a bill
next bill about that you'll
never be able to get that power
to those houses to charge
electric vehicles.
Madame Chair and senator, I
appreciate the comments. We're
already seeing that in my part
of the world because people are
going out of state to buy their
vehicles that the dealerships no
longer can be in compliance with
due to what the manufacturers
are imposing on them, and Madame
Chair, I will point this out to
the crowd that's out there that
would like to pay attention to
what I'm fixing to say.
Uh
And this has to do with 1234567
dealerships in my particular
area, there is a certain
manufacturer that mandated that
these 7 dealerships in
southeastern New Mexico.
Update their software, which is
going to cost $90,000 to support
these electric vehicles that
were coming in. They had to
provide, provide at least
A minimum of 3 charging stations
on their dealership to be in
compliance with that they did
have to accept the amount of
electric vehicles that they
would be shipping in.
Wait just a minute.
One dealership in particular
said, OK, let's see if we can
give this a go.
They did order in one charger.
Get it all set up and everything
they.
Started looking at what the cost
and effect it would be for the
uh software update plus sending
their staff to be retrained in
working on electric vehicles.
And then they had the electric
companies come in.
There was not enough power to
support the charging stations.
So what are these people gonna
do whenever they roll up and
they say we want to charge our
vehicle and they can't do it.
I work for a living out on a
farm and ranch, and it's my
choice to make that decision
whether I want an electric
vehicle or not.
But in my line of work, just
like Senator Minosis, I put a
lot of miles on a vehicle in one
day for me to drive from the
farms where I live all the way
out to my ranch and back.
That's about 120.
Miles right there.
And that's not counting the
miles I put on it when I'm out
on the ranch checking
everything. So I do have a
problem with somebody says you
will have an electric vehicle.
This particular deal, all these.
Dealership, said I.
Named or
I'm not gonna name where they
are, OK?
But they do have a choice
whether they carried this
particular manufacturer or not.
That is driving.
Lots of automobile dealers out
of state.
I can see where it would be
beneficial.
To have an electric vehicle if
you lived in a more metropolitan
area.
But folks, you're forgetting
about the rural areas of our
state.
And I take great
I'm gonna stop right there. I'm
not gonna finish saying that,
OK?
Whenever things come before the
legislature we do have checks
and balances, madam chair.
But whenever we have agencies
that are saying we are going to
implement these rules.
Because of a mandate.
There's a problem there. Is that
really representing our
constituents to the best of our
ability, I don't think it is,
madam chair.
I want choice to be available if
you choose to have an electric
vehicle.
Good for you.
But you know what, whenever I'm
out there pulling a trailer
whenever I'm out there on a
tractor that does help provide
food to everybody in this room.
I cannot
get the job done because there
is no such thing as an electric
tractor.
That does work right now.
The prototypes that have come
out for electric tractors.
You have to charge them a
minimum of 16 hours.
16 hours to charge a tractor to
get 4 hours of work out of it,
and that is not pulling an
implement.
That's the progress that is
being.
Done with tractors right now.
John Deere is the only
manufacturer in the United
States that said we're not going
down that road right now.
Folks, if you like to, you need
to understand that the choice
has to be up to the individual
on the excuse me.
On the line of work that they do
have.
And what they are actually
doing, how will this, madam
chair, senators and senators,
how will this affect the
oilfield industry.
Did they have to have diesel
trucks to be able to move
product? Did they have to have a
diesel trucks to be able to move
pipe.
Do they have to have diesel
trucks to be able to pull.
I don't know, uh, move a pulling
unit.
Madam Chairman
Senator
California is very unique.
Most products that is
transported by truck in
California.
Those trucks are on a more
stringent.
Requirement that is required.
Outside of California.
And what I have heard.
That most everybody has a yard.
Right outside of California.
California truckers take it to
that yard. They set it off. It's
picked up from.
Every other carrier out of that
yard and transported to the rest
of the United States.
Um
What they have done.
For the local trucker.
And the cost of those trucks.
And made it restrictive to go
into California with any other.
Over the road trucker.
Truckers Association told me.
That today they could buy a
tractor like a tractor trailer.
That kind of a tractor that goes
under one of these road trucks.
For an average cost of $180,000
per truck.
The same comparable electric
truck.
It was a million dollars.
I don't know if any of you guys
up there listening.
180,000.
To a million
I don't know if any of you know
any independent truckers.
In your life.
They can't do that.
I can't afford that, but what
will that do to your
products coming into this state
or across the state, what will
it do the food costs in this
state.
The question was asked, Madam
Chair.
What happens in California.
That's what happened in
California. Thank you.
I'll quit testifying.
Chair and senator, thank you
very much for that response and
that's where I was heading on
the cost of food will rise
exorbitantly.
We have to rely on semi trucks.
be able to get our product.
To market
We have to rely on our semis to
do all sorts of things to get
our products into stores in the
metropolitan areas because they
do, they are a lot of them are
shipped into places such as
California.
But Madam Cheer
The point you're trying to make
here in this bill.
Its legislative oversight is the
checks and balances that we do
give on bills like this.
And whenever it is mandated.
Through executive order that is
not taken into consideration.
are
Constituents out there that
depend on us to be able to make
wise decision on their behalf,
Madam Chair, thank you very much
for your responses.
Thank you and senators raised a
question, um, for me, and I will
just ask, I think this uh
relates to.
Doesn't relate to farm
equipment.
To tractors, etc. So I just,
I'll come back to that in a
minute.
Uh, to clarify, that was
innovative.
Progress that is being made for
electric vehicles and now they
have started it in the farm
implement industry so yes it is
coming, but boy, there are still
a long ways out.
Thank you very much. Thank you,
Senator Scott, then Senator
Pope.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator, Mr. Ortiz.
Is the mandate is for.
The manufacturers.
To deliver 43% of the vehicles
that they deliver.
Into the state.
Must be electric or plug-in
electric.
However, is, is that correct?
That is correct. What the rule
requires is manufactures to make
available for sale.
Amongst its dealerships, 43% of
the vehicles zero emissions. Um,
there was a comment about
plug-in hybrids, plug-in hybrids
are a fraction of this where
they can make up 20% of the 43%
and then from there each year
that mandate increases
approximately 8% until 2032
where 82% of all the vehicles
available for sale have to be
zero emission vehicle.
Uh, Madam Chair, that was the
information that I had also.
And I heard it represented in
some testimony that
That there were none of these
vehicles available on Carlos. Is
there a
A shortage
Is it manufacturers.
Or are they not able to deliver
these.
The car dealers today or
Is that
Consequence of something else.
Senator Scott, that's a very
good question. During the during
the hearing under the
Environmental Improvement Board,
we heard testimony testimony
such as we heard today that they
couldn't find a vehicle. The
only thing that our dealers can
think of that maybe equate to
that is during the pandemic,
where there were no vehicles of
all classes available for sale.
Um, from the for the last at
least 36 months, we've had
thousands, literally thousands
of electric.
vehicles available for sale
throughout the state, and once
again our our, our dealers would
sell anything that the customer
wants. And that's it, that's
the, the point of this, that the
customer should have a choice.
Senator Mr. Ortiz.
I, I believe you just
represented that there is no
shortage. Is there any
incentive.
For dealers to prefer.
Oh
gasoline or diesel powered
vehicle over an electric vehicle
that I guess what I'm trying to
get at here is
It is uh.
Similar profit margins, for
example, on both vehicles would
there be any incentive for
dealers to press forward.
With the
The gasoline or diesel vehicle.
Over an electric vehicle.
Senator Scott, there's really no
incentive, um, one thing I like
to kind of walk through is the
process. So when a vehicle
leaves the factory floor from
the manufacturer, it's bought
and paid for by that dealership.
It's often financed by that
dealership called the floor
plan. So every day that that
vehicle sits on the lot, that
dealer is paying interest to
that credit company, if you
will, for the vehicles. So all
the
vehicles are purchased and paid
for, the dealer is paying
interest until they sell it, and
it's in the dealer's best
interest to try to move those
vehicles as quickly as they can,
as I mentioned, the average time
a vehicle sits on the lot for a
traditional vehicle is 30 to 45
days versus 100. So to answer
your question, if I was a
dealer, I would try to sell as
many electric vehicles as
possible because every day it's
sitting on the lot on paying
interest on that vehicle and
basically losing if I'm going to
make a.
Profit virtually any profit
there would be there.
And so, Madam Chair, Mr. Ortiz
would be.
I mean the, the, the market
penetration of those vehicles.
The day is a little less than.
If my math is correct.
Would it be the opinion of the,
of the dealerships.
In this state.
That the only thing holding
back.
These
Eye sails.
His consumer choice.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, you
have it exactly right, consumer
choice and and some of the items
that we hear is, you know, the
lack of infrastructure currently
in New Mexico, um, the rural
maybe tribal areas that have
even less of that out there.
Those are some of the concerns
that we see. You often hear
range anxiety where a person
maybe could get to their
destination, but what about
back? Is there going to be a
charging station there? Is it
going to be operational in order
to get to and safely from their
destination.
Madam Chair um senators Mr.
Ortiz Raja anxiety would be
certainly one of the things that
I have heard is a handicap for
these vehicles selling
particularly.
In the rural areas now, I guess
the next question.
When these hearings were being
conducted to develop this
mandate.
Were they conducted around the
state where they in Gallup where
they, were they in Hobbs, the
rural areas.
Where more of this.
Anxiety might have been
expressed Scott that's an
excellent question. Um, there,
the environment department was
required to inform all New
Mexicans about the rule under
consideration and unfortunately,
we are very dismayed. They held
3.
Town hall meetings to inform the
public, and I attended each 11
was an in-person hearing in
Santa Fe. The second one was an
in-person hearing in
Albuquerque, and then they
offered one virtual hearing. So
there were no public town hall
hearings south of Albuquerque or
in the northeast or northwestern
areas of New Mexico where this
would be impacted the most.
Uh, Madam Chair and senators, I
find that process.
Problematic
OK.
So
This mandate.
As I understand it.
It was a consequence.
Senator and Mr. Ortiz.
Of the adoption in New Mexico.
Of the California Advanced Clean
Car rule.
2
Is that correct?
Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
that's absolutely correct.
So
What entity, what body.
Madam Chair, Senator, and Mr.
Ortiz.
was responsible for the
development of that rule.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, the
California Air Resources Board,
which is an unelected board.
Uh, basically has the authority
under the EPA rules to create.
Their own emission standards for
California.
Now this section 177 waiver that
allows California to set their
own emission standards allows
other states to adopt that
standard, but other states are
not allowed to create their own
standards. So a state like New
Mexico and the other 49 states
besides besides California.
I have two choices. You can
adopt the federal emissions
standards, and I believe that's
what most manufacturers prefer.
So we all operate under one
emission standard or they can
adopt the California uh standard
that we have adopted in 2023.
And I'm going to direct this
question to the senators.
Uh
Gentlemen, do you believe?
It's appropriate.
For the state of New Mexico.
The abdicate its
responsibilities.
Or regulating clean air.
To an unelected board that's not
even located in the state.
You know, Senator, there is
something, Madam Chair.
That uh maybe nobody knows in
the room.
And it is every time there's a
rule put forward by any agency.
It is brought to the attention
of the legislature.
Why do we do that?
That's where the legislature to
take note of that.
So if they want to object to it.
They can't.
How do I object to that?
I bring it a bill forward.
You have that power.
Now it has been stated that
these are experts.
We shouldn't question them.
I'm sure
I strongly disagree with that.
It is our duty as elected
officials.
2
Look at everything.
And decide whether it makes
good.
sense for our
are elected populist, I mean are
populist.
So
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, ma'am Chair, Senator,
you know, uh, I believe there
was a vote taken.
When the EIB board convened to
make the rulemaking, 65
legislators.
Wade in
Uh, 42 opposed the rule.
And 23 were in support of the
rule.
So, I mean, if that would have
been a legislative meeting, you
know what happened.
The bill would have passed
whatever the legislatures didn't
weigh into them.
They still did what they wanted
on a 3-2 vote, barely making a
quorum.
Um, and so,
With it was rolling in Mexico.
Uh
Were they, were they notified of
the room what's going to happen
and do, do people really pay
attention because sometimes this
is our job as legislators to
make them pay attention.
You know what's really happening
to you in the legislature it's
not going to the legislature
person you voted for, and, and a
lot of times they don't, their
lives are busy and and who's
gonna read the backside of the
journal for notifications and,
and really get involved in this,
um, there are in a nonprofit
organization that oppose it or
to support it.
About the daily average New
Mexican has no idea we're even
talking about this today.
And no, no idea of what we're
trying to, to protect consumers.
I, I mean, because the market
share is not there.
A small town car dealers and
we've seen this all over or just
closing up.
We had a brand new Dodge
dealership close up because they
didn't have enough market share,
and that was they built it
within 2 years ago in the market
share was not there.
Of Madam Chair, and gentlemen.
And this is a comment.
But
This legislature is derelict in
its duty.
Or not
Overseeing a policy that will
affect
200 the sale of 200,000 vehicles
in this state, it comes to pass.
And I'm sure I've got
I've got one last question.
And that is
For Mr. Ortiz.
Absent
A sea change.
In consumer attitudes.
Is this mandate.
Even remotely.
Achievable
Senator, Madam Chair, Senator
Scott, that's the question of
the day. You have to realize we
have been stuck at less than 4%
for the last 36 months, and yet
somehow.
By next year, which is model
year 27 because as you know,
model years come in to the
market about 6 months before the
calendar year hit. So by next
June or July were somehow
supposed to go from 4% to 43%.
But yet, we haven't moved it a
percentage point in the last 36
months. That's the question of
the day, and the answer is
absolutely not. In fact, my
counterpart from the State Auto
Association in California,
Brian.
Moss had had provided an update
at our conference last month,
and he mentioned that they are
um right now at 25%.
By this year, because we're New
Mexico adopted uh the California
clean car rules one year later,
so they're actually in effect in
California model year 26, which
is this year, and they're
supposed to be at 35%, and yet
they're at 25%. So his comment
was that California has been
working on clean cars one and
clean cars 2 for over 15 years,
they're at 25% and they're not
even going to be able to achieve
their own and Madam Chair, Mr.
Ortiz.
this I promise this is the last
question.
The consequences of this policy.
Will drive
I believe
New Mexico consumers.
The perch and make their
purchases.
Elsewhere
Is that an option and what will
that do to New Mexico car
dealers.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
that's absolutely an option. New
Mexicans can purchase their
vehicles out of state today,
tomorrow, etc. uh, basically
purchasing the vehicle of
choice. This would do nothing
related to improving our air
emission standards if if New
Mexicans purchase their vehicles
out of state, buy them back
here. All we're doing is hurting
New Mexico businesses and jobs
and doing nothing to clean uh
clean up the air if you will. If
the, if I believe.
that the state was really
interested in clean air quality,
which I think we all are. Maybe
they should look at what
Bernalillo County did, maybe
1520 years ago, and they created
a state admissions program, and
we could look at that at more
popular areas. It would get the
older, dirtier cars off the road
and improve emissions the way
Bernalillo County has
successfully done.
Madam, gentlemen, senators, Mr.
Ortiz, thank you for your
answers. I'm going to listen.
To the rest of the questions and
answers.
During this session, but I think
I might be able to support this
legislation.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you very much. Uh, is
there anyone for the first time
wants to speak?
Senator Pope
Thank you, Madam. Sure, I don't
have any questions, I just want
to make uh a few comments.
First off, I don't
Dereliction of duty.
We're all here listening, making
an informed decision, Bill and
all others, so just wanted to
get there, get that out there
first off, um.
You know, when I get calls and I
get emails, not just on this
bill.
But it's about access to.
And now I'm hearing that this is
going to cause
Less access to gasoline
vehicles.
Folks have
8
So
I'm just really confused with
this. This is just weird to me.
Um.
Some of these arguments
The job losses and everything
that's going to occur.
Um
And
Excuse me for actually believing
in.
A board's decision.
Now if I
I thought it was egregious or
totally wrong or what they were
trying to do. I
You know, I'm all for with what
they're trying to do, but
You know, I, I would fight
again.
But
I'm just not seeing that.
And
For me this bill.
In essence for me actually.
Gives more access to the
electric vehicle, um.
The problems that you claim that
are gonna happen.
actually happening.
is.
Because of that, I'm gonna
Be voting against the bill.
Let me be clear.
What you're saying is true.
And it happens?
We have our duty, we can come
back adjustments and do what we
have to do for.
But
I just don't fear.
Some of these problems
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you. OK, now for the 2nd
time, Senator Townsend.
Yes. Thank you, madam Chair. Um,
Hermanos, what do you believe?
The effect of
Continuing man.
Uh, benefit of.
In this class, we don't even
have an EV registration.
Right.
And so they get away with using
our roads.
Um, and only 4% of them are sold
annually, so at a smaller rate,
but the heavier class of vehicle
and so mandates are made by
agencies.
In in the good chairwoman made a
reference to this. Sometimes
they were victim of that.
We at one point must have
believed that agencies could
make good rules and not restrict
with mandates.
That came to fortune when
Richardson tried to push
mandates through and couldn't
get them through legislation, so
he didn't by rule.
So any time, sometimes, not all
the time.
Rulemaking going around the
legislature.
endangers the budget, um.
the environment department, the
rules they make that we all hear
about other agencies that
mandate rules, uh.
That nobody knows about.
And do it very quietly and they
have to report to us and notify
us of when rulemaking is, but.
Your email is probably just as
clogged as mine.
Uh
When they do that, and so
you're, are you really watching
what you should be watching, you
never know it depends what your
agency how care for, but it has
affected us and could affect us
in the tune in some places in
the environment really big.
Appreciate that, Senator, um.
The
Percentage of EV.
Um
in the market.
Is a
I believe it's a direct impact
on the desires of the
Of, of
purchaser.
They can
Go to
They can, they can go to a
surrounding area or stay and
make a purchase, just like I go
to a surrounding.
state in order.
purchase or I may uh to purchase
on the vehicle that I want. Is
that correct?
Madam Chair, uh, Senator
Townsend, that's absolutely
correct. New Mexicans can buy
the vehicle of choice virtually
anywhere inside or outside New
Mexico.
Ma'am chair, um,
Mr. Ortiz, I believe that's
gonna continue to happen.
I mean, if
If the type of vehicle that I
need is not available. I go find
it.
That's exactly what people are
are going to do. Is there a way
Can we track of these EVs that
are in New Mexico. Is there a
way that I can say that
People, I mean, 25% of the
people have to go out of state
to buy an EV. Is there a way
that you can track the, the
excise tax payments on those
vehicles to find out where they
were purchased.
Senator Townsend, yes, there,
there is a way because when a
vehicle is titled and registered
through the New Mexico Motor
Vehicle Division. They have to,
uh, the dealership have to, has
to surrender the manufacturer
certificate of origin or
manufacturer's statement of
origin depending on the
manufacturer. So, um, that
paperwork, if you will, would
come from the selling dealer.
Into New Mexico to title and
register that vehicle, so we'd
be able to identify vehicles
that are purchased out of state
and where.
That are titled and registered
here in New Mexico.
And Madam Chair and um
Mr. Ortiz, senators.
Have you seen any the the
a dealerships track that to be
able to say, hey, we're not
meeting the needs of people and,
and we need to stop more of this
or that. They watch what people
are buying out of state, is that
correct?
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, they
have the same tool that I do
that basically tracks every
single vehicle, so a dealership
in a in a given community.
can identify what they term as
the pump in and pump outs
basically vehicles that are sold
within their community and
vehicles that are sold by two
customers outside of the
community. Yes, Madam Chair, um,
and Mr. Ortiz, have you seen any
Data that would
that you believe indicates that
EVs are not available in New
Mexico and people are leaving
the state to purchase them.
I have not, Madam Sheriff
Senator Scott, or Senator
Townsend, I'm sorry, I have not
seen that.
At all
Um, in fact, what we're seeing
in some of the other clean car
states and there's 10 other
states out there is that.
Owners and they're a little bit
ahead of us uh because they
adopted them this year. So a
purchaser of a vehicle of a
traditional vehicle that goes
down to a dealership lot. What
we're hearing is that they are
facing 3 choices that
traditional vehicle like a
diesel or a gas-powered vehicle
is not currently available at
the dealership lot, so they have
an option to special order it.
Which is going to take about 6
months.
They can opt for a slightly used
model of their choice, and we
know what that's going to do is
as demand increases, price is
going to increase, or they could
leave out of state and buy their
vehicle of their choice. That's
what we're actually seeing in
other states.
Thank you,
Mr. Thank you, senators for data
that indicates that are not
following mandates.
They're not meeting the needs of
the people, and that's where
I would argue with
Senator Pope that we're being
Derelict in our
Thank you. uh, Senator Pope
would like to make a motion, but
I want to take any further
comments, Senator.
Yeah
uh, it's not a question or
anything. Did anybody from the
environment department ever show
up?
No, and I don't believe, is
anybody here from environment?
I did text the secretary. He
said we were in, is somebody
from Environment back there?
Nobody
He texted that uh they were in
committees, uh, testifying, so.
Uh, he at least.
Yeah.
He at least uh did respond to
me.
So, Senator Pope.
Madam Chair, I moved to the
table.
I
Uh, tabling motion is
non-debatable, so the secretary
will please call the roll.
Senator Cervantes is excused,
Senator Charlie.
Yes.
Senator Charlie, yes, Tenorel.
No, Sanel, no, Senator Hamblin,
Senator Hamblin, yes, Senator
Pope.
Yes.
And Pope, yes, Senator Scott,
Senator Scott, no, Senator
Townsend.
Townsend, no. Senator Dia Lopez,
yes, Senator Lopez, yes, Senator
Stephonics.
Yes
of phonics, yes.
So, um, senators, uh, the bill
has been tabled by a 5 to 3
vote. Thank you very much for a
good discussion this morning and
I would invite Senator Munoz to
stay.
It's a very, very generous
offer.
I'm just gonna wait for my
expert witness to come up.
So we are now on the grid
modernization roadmap center.
Oh, so, yeah, uh, Senator Munoz
and Representative Dixon.
And we don't expect the House
member to be here.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Senate
Bill 142 seeks to make an
electoral grid more affordable
by making an investment in
modernizing New Mexico's
electrical.
electrical infrastructure.
so
Yeah.
Now that one's on better.
142 seeks to make the electrical
grid more affordable by making
an investment in modernizing the
state's electrical grid and
infrastructure.
This bill ensures that in New
Mexico energy, minerals and
natural resources in the PARC
are consistently at the table
working to together to establish
a good roadmap for grid
modernization.
Expands the definition of
gridmont to ensure actual
distribution and transmission
infrastructure can be purchased
with the funding. It also
ensures the speed and deployment
is a factor taken in when the
agency makes a funding decision.
This is an investment in New
Mexico.
Madam Chair, we know there's
certain places community solar
has not been able to tie it to
the grid.
Uh, that's been an issue with
the PRC in in in order to harden
our grid and, and make our grid
better so that solar connections
can be made. Uh, Mesa del Sol
currently doesn't have a
substation in PNM will invest in
that substation, uh, until
there's enough activity in the
area to justify that.
If we're going to change the
economic development in New
Mexico. This is all Italian, a
solar and data centers are now
becoming all solar and off the
grid, cooling with air instead
of water, uh, the need to harden
that grid becomes even more and
more.
Clarifying to us.
The premium basin.
Uh, and, uh, will allow AI
deployment to stop emissions the
moment they occur effectively
reducing greenhouse gasses.
Currently, Madam Chair, in the
Southeast New Mexico prior and
there is a change all actuators
were run off gas. And so
whatever gas is coming out of
the well, if they need to hit a
switch that was activated that
way. Now they're moved to air.
And if they need to, well
there's some are moving to, to
electrification, but the grid is
so sporadic and unattainable in
certain places to get those shit
off, um, that it.
It will not work, um, so with
that, Madam Chair, uh,
I'll introduce my expert wish
I'll introduce my expertorsons
John and uh.
I won't say his last name
because a little tough for me.
Great John, you might see from
the PRC, please introduce
yourself in your position.
Madam Chair, good morning,
senators. Good morning. My name
is John Bogao, and I'm the
acting.
Legal division director over at
the NMPRC.
At the New Mexico regulation
Commission.
OK, thanks. So you're the acting
legal.
Uh, over at PRC. Thank you.
I have
Um
Well, I
I would just add that what I see
here in SB 142 seems to be
complimentary of what's been
going on, uh.
With the gridmod roadmap and the
efforts that have been
coordinated.
They're from, um, I'm
referencing the 2021 grid mod
roadmap, and I.
noticed that there were a number
of goals in there that I think
have been.
Carried and realized by a number
of our different cases and I
know that SB 142 makes explicit.
Uh, PRCs.
role as in consultation with
NMED going forward on the grid
map grid grid mod road map, and
I think that's um.
Certainly in concert with what's
actually been going on. Uh, for
example, today we have
a workshop in grid readiness and
interconnection inquiry that we
have before the commission
started at 10 a.m.
And I would expect there's a
representative from NMED over
there on that too consulting
with us, and we do talk to each
other about other things as
well. I've seen that enemyDs
intervene in our cases.
And um
We've realized some good
results. For example,
Referencing again the 2021 grid
mod roadmap.
Um
One of the recommendations was
that utilities should invest in
advanced metering
infrastructure, and this is back
in 2021, obviously.
Uh, one of the conclusions at
that point was that none of the
New Mexico IOUs have adopted AMI
and since that time.
We've had a triumvirate of 3
grid modernization cases brought
forth by the IOUs where
AMI is
Featuring large in those and the
orders and the recommendations
that have been approved by the
commission have seen deployment
of the advanced metering
infrastructure in conformance
with.
What the, what the gridmod
roadmap contemplated, um.
Ridmod road map from 2021 also
talked about concerns.
Regarding the interconnection
rule and manual.
And since that time, in case
number 21266 UT we did address
that issue. We updated the
interconnection rule and the
interconnection manual, which
had been around since 2008 was
Uh, basically repealed, taken
down, and now you will find the
same content in that old
interconnection manual on as an
appendix on our NAC website.
So with that proceeding, we
address that that issue in the
grid module roadmap, and we
certainly were cognizant.
Of what um
What, what, what it implied. Um,
There was another
recommendation, update the
standards for advanced inverters
and
The concern there was that
Um, the old style inverter
didn't allow.
People who had distributed
generation to uh continue to
enjoy their own generation when
there was a general outage. If
there's a general outage, then
it.
Required both sides of the the
of the old type inverter to be.
Excuse me, discontinued while
the advanced.
The concerns regarding advanced
inverters were addressed then as
part of the.
the interconnection manual rule
amendment and
Though it doesn't feature
directly in the new
interconnection standards
featured in the rules appendix.
As part of that proceeding, the
expectation or requirement was
that the utilities would provide
um a guidance and um the
requirements for implementing
advanced inverters um to people
who come forward for
interconnections under the new
interconnection standards. I
mean, the long and short of it,
and I'll try to keep it as short
as I can because there's a whole
lot to talk about with what we
do over there. Uh, this is very
similar to a bill I carried a
few years ago with other uh
people, so we're.
familiar both in the house and
the Senate on this. OK. Let's go
to, uh, you can be available for
questions. Let's go to the room.
How many people are here to
support.
This spill?
Great, one of our IOUs.
Is anybody here to oppose this
bill.
Is there anybody online to
support or oppose.
One to support
OK, so, uh, Carlos, would you
like to come up and say a few
words.
So, so far, Senator, we have no
opposition. We have one in the
room supporting one online
supporting.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Carlos
Lucero with the.
Public service company in New
Mexico.
So just a few words, you know,
Senate Bill 142 will allow grid
monetization grants for entities
that could be PNM customers and
could also allow grants for P&M
for good monetization projects
for rural areas, and I know
we've talked about rural New
Mexico um earlier this morning.
So for these reasons, B&M
supports Senate Bill 142. Thank
you.
Thank you. And who do we have
online? Oh, the person online
lowered her hand.
So anybody in the audience
again, uh, one more time,
opposed to this bill.
Is anybody online opposed. OK.
Uh, going to questions and
comments from the committee,
Senator Sadil Lopez. Thank you,
Madam Chair. I only have, um, I
think I only have one question,
and that is there's a line uh or
there's uh, as I understand this
bill, it extends program
eligibility to net zero carbon
resources.
So
Yeah
How does that relate to
negative.
Negative carbon intensity.
Another, OK. My question is, I
assume that's irrelevant, but I,
I just want to.
What line in what?
page and what number?
Are you referring to?
You're,
well, I'll just explain. So
Senator Lopez, um, is this
question on this bill?
Yes, I wondered, I want to
understand how, well, how this
bill.
Uh, because it, it talks about
um
About um
Projects, potential projects and
it talks about net um.
Net zero carbon projects so
that's the intention of the
bill, net zero carbon projects,
and my question is, would it
interfere with?
Um, or how would it relate to
Our current, um.
So right now, our regulations um
are being developed regarding
whether credits are gonna be
given for
Uh, biodige digesters, for
example, that would reduce
emissions and
And they, they would.
Theoretically go to net zero
carbon intensity. However, um,
Bill's, uh, regulations are
being developed to give them
negative.
carbon credits.
And those negative carbon
credits could be sold to
industries and allow them to
admit in order to balance our
carbon emissions on paper. And
so I'm just trying to confirm
that this bill doesn't really
have anything to do with that.
Madam Chair.
Center has nothing to do with
that.
That was what I expected, but I
just wanted to clarify that. I
think this is a great idea and
very important for the future of
New Mexico. Thank you for
bringing it forward. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Other
questions or comments?
OK, is there a motion?
I move a do pass. Is there a
second?
A second manager.
There is a motion in a second
for a due pass.
On Senate Bill 142 grid
monetization roadmap.
But the secret police called the
roll.
Yes, Senator Cervantes, excuse
Senator Charlie. Senator
Charlie, yes, Sen herself.
Senorel, yes, Senator Hamblin,
Senator Hamblin, yes, Senator
Pope.
Yes. And our Pope, yes, Senator
Scott.
Yes
Then her Scott, yes, Senator
Townsend.
Senator Townsend, yes, Senator
Dia Lopez.
Yes, and I said Dia Lopez, yes,
inophonics.
There's aphonics, yes.
So Senator, you have a unanimous
due pass on this bill. Thank you
very much for coming forward.
So, um
Committee members, uh, Senator
Cedilia Lopez will chair while I
put on Senate Bill 156.
Good morning, um, Madam Chair,
members of the committee.
I'm here today presenting Cenvi
156, and this is we referred to
as the low income utility users.
Senate Bill 156 introduces a new
definition for low-income
customer in the public utility
Act, it organizes existing
definitions, which is uh what's
the drafter upstairs indicated
we needed to do.
And makes minor non-substantive
changes to the presentation of
certain definitions.
In addition,
Senate Bill 156 amends a section
of the law pertaining to utility
cost recovery.
For interconnecting distributed
generation customers by
exempting low income customers
from rate riders for new
interconnected customers.
Cenil 156, also enacts a new
section of the public Utility
Act.
To provide instructions for when
electric public utilities shall
notify customers about low
income qualification and how
customers may qualify.
As a low income customer.
The um qualifications Senate
Bill 156 defines qualifications
to become a low-income customer
as follows.
Uh, they shall provide to the
public utility either assigned
self-est
Attestation that the customer's
household income and household
site.
qualify.
Proof of residence in a low
income or affordable housing
facility.
Or 3 proof of current enrollment
in a low-income program
facilitated or administered by
the state or federal government.
Such as light.
Excuse me,
like Medicaid snap, etc.
Um
There is an exemption entitled
Interconnected Customs utility
cost recovery. It states that
upon request of an
investor-owned utility, thanks.
Um, that upon request of an
investor owned utility and a
general rate case that
commission shall prove
interconnected customer rate
riders to recover the cost of
ancillary and standby services
with me today I have Christian
Christian Casilla.
Who is from the coalition of
sustainable Communities New
Mexico.
And Christian would like to make
a few opening comments.
Chair, committee members.
Thank you for the opportunity to
support this bill.
Um, this bill is an important
Um, provides important change to
statute that would preserve
potential benefits for low
income households for rooftop
solar. There are a number of
state and federal programs that
are uh
In the process of unfolding
right now that would give
low-income households the
opportunity to put rooftop solar
on their house, um, to benefit
from up to 20% uh annual savings
over the life of a solar system,
which is 20 to 25 years, um,
which has the potential to
result in 10,000 to $20,000 in
accrued savings for a low income
household.
And here in New Mexico, um, we
have plenty of opportunities
such as the utilities, uh, solar
direct program and other
programs that provide
opportunities for industry, um,
large entities like Facebook,
Walmart, to benefit from our
clean energy resources and
financial savings, um, and this
would preserve that opportunity
for our most vulnerable
populations to receive the
same sort of financial benefits
and savings, um, that are given
to uh some of the, the largest
um wealthiest companies in the
state.
Madam Chair.
We will
Boy, that's stuck.
Uh, we will not leave it.
Uh, we will stand for questions
and support and opposition.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Is there
anyone in the audience in
support of this bill?
Is there any anyone in the
audience in opposition to this
bill?
2
And we have 123455 in support
and one in opposition. So let's
go ahead um and we'll stick with
the 10 minutes for, for, um.
Each side, um, so let's go ahead
and have the supporters stand in
line behind the speakers.
And state their support and if
I would appreciate it if you
weren't very repetitive, if
somebody's major point, uh, move
on.
Camilla Fielman, thank you,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee just want to make sure
that low income solar owners
don't have the terms switched
out from under their feet and
support their economic savings
on utility bills.
Yes, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I support this bill.
This is Sharon Argenbright. I've
had solar panels for over 10
years and have paid minimal
electricity and mostly gotten
paybacks from P&M. I support
this bill. Good morning again,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. I'm Ona Porter from
Prosperity Works, the founder
emerita and clean energy leader.
This is another opportunity for
including people who need these
resources most, and it is aligns
with all of our goals that have
to do with our climate future.
And it is important to know that
we cannot reach that climate
future without including
low-income households. Thank you
for your consideration, please
pass this bill.
Thank you, Ms. Madam Chair and
committee members.
Uh, Glenmiel 3rd act, um, as you
know, our low income residents
are suffering uh in many
different ways in this state and
it is just hard to meet your
rent and your utility bills, um.
They also want to participate in
what I call the solar revolution
and be able to reduce their
electricity bills.
through solar. So, um,
This is
Really important. Thank you.
Thank you, um, and online may
Ann Chavez Bauddin.
My
Leone
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Maanie Brudden, and I am
the executive director of
Sovereign Energy and native led
nonprofit dedicated to
supporting energy deployment and
tribal capacity building across
New Mexico, and also a proud
member of Gua Pablo, SB 156
takes critical steps towards
addressing energy affordability
for low-income households,
especially in tribal
communities. According to the
Department of Energy's tribal
Electricity access and
reliability report, tribal
households across the United
States experienced an energy
burden, 28% higher than the
national average. This means
they spend a significantly
larger portion of their income
on energy costs compared to
non-tribal households, making
energy affordability and urgent
issue for our tribes.
This bill expands on existing
efforts to promote energy equity
by reducing unnecessary costs
and ensuring the clear framework
for affordability, which will
help tribal and low-income
communities with the escalating
cost of living. It will also
support the success of existing
laws, such as the Community
Solar Act, which includes a 30%
low income carveout for
customers, ensuring vital
economic savings for families
who need it most. By removing
financial barriers and
strengthening energy
affordability.
measures. SB 156 will provide
meaningful relief to households
that bear disproportionate
energy burden. I urge the
committee to support this
legislation and take an
important step towards ensuring
energy, justice for tribal and
low-income communities across
New Mexico. Thank you for your
time and consideration.
Thank you, Bunny, and I
apologize for mispronouncing
your name. Uh, Miss Bethello.
Miss Bella
Yes.
Can you hear me? Yes.
OK, good. Madam Chair, committee
members. I'm Beth Blo, CEO of
New Mexico's first green bank
climate investment Center. We
provide investments to support
projects that reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and prioritized
benefits for low income and
disadvantaged communities. One
of the mission uh initial
programs that we are set.
launch is funding a low income
solar lease program. This
program seeks to provide income
qualified households with leases
for rooftop solar that would
provide households with at least
20% annual savings from their
current electricity bills. We
hope to invest several millions
in this program, beginning this
year. However, the fact that it
an investor owned utility could
seek to impose a great writer
for standby or ancillary
services puts unnecessary risk
to both NMCIC and the low income
households potentially erasing
their promised savings. We
therefore support this bill and
hope that you will too. Thank
you.
Thank you. We have 3 more and we
have a little over 5 minutes.
left. So, uh, the next is Ken
Hughes.
Mr. Hughes
the skin heals with the
coalition of Sustainable
Communities. Uh, one other
really interesting possible um
program coming to New Mexico
will be the ability to put on
your um bill, a repayment
program. So if you had solar
Um, 6 with the meter.
I mean, if you're renting, you
move on stays with the uh
address. This is another great
way to get solar in the, in the
hands of longer residents who
now can't afford it. If this
bill doesn't pass, however, it'd
be really hard to justify making
those kind of expenditures, so I
urge your support. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Hughes, uh,
Stephanie Zer.
Good morning. Can you hear me?
Thank you. Uh, good morning.
Thank you for the opportunity to
comment. My name is Stephanie
Zer and I'm an attorney who
regularly appears before the
public regulation commission. SB
156 along with the Federal Solar
for all grant would allow
low-income customers to have the
same opportunities to enjoy
renewable energy and build
savings as other customers that
have long enjoyed.
Uh, via large utility voluntary
renewable energy programs. PNM
has a voluntary renewable energy
program, for example, for large
customers called the Solar
Direct program. It requires
participants to have a load of
2.5 megawatts or greater to
participate.
It, if 5000 low income customers
take advantage.
Uh, of competitive programs to
purchase or lease a rooftop
solar system, this could result
in roughly 25 megawatts
installed in the houses, which
is about half of the amount of
renewable energy serving large
customers under PNM Solar Direct
program. Facebook has a special
services contract that allows
Facebook to be served with
hundreds of megawatts of
renewable energy and receive
special rates. And this is
completely appropriate. We
certainly
have a competitive advantage in
New Mexico when it comes to
renewable energy.
The renewable energy program
that P&M has for residential
customers is called the Sky Blue
program, where customers pay a
premium. They pay extra for
renewable energy instead of
saving money. If we can serve
the biggest corporations with
low cost renewable energy. We
can also do the same for the
poorest amongst us and protect
those savings. This bill doesn't
do anything crazy. It does with
the utilities are already doing.
This bill expands the
availability.
of renewable energy and build
savings for our low-income
customers. This is the right
thing to do for New Mexico. This
is part of economic development.
Economic development for our
low-income customers. Thank you
all for supporting SB 156.
Thank you, Mrs. uh, and finally
Hank Hughes.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Um, very quickly, Santa Fe
County supports this bill. I'm a
Hank Hughes, Santa Fe County
commissioner, Santa Fe County
supports this bill. There are
plenty of low income families
that would take advantage of
this in Santa Fe County, and I
urge you to support this bill.
Thank you, Mr. Hughes, um.
And now or Commissioner Hughes,
um, and now, uh, let's go ahead
and hear from the opponents.
There was a minute and 20
seconds left.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Mike
D'Antonio with Xcel Energy. We
serve electricity to theseer
part of the state.
Uh, we want to commend the uh
senator for bringing this
legislation. We do agree with
the low-income aspect of it.
We've been looking to try to
provide low income rates and
programs for, for many years. We
don't think that this is the
vehicle to do it. There's
another bill that uh
representative Ortez has it's a
simple fix to the statute that
allows
For low income rates, um, and uh
we are in support of that bill.
It and it does
what's one of the main reasons
for that is it actually tailors
and it gives the utilities the
ability or the option to offer
programs and or rates. The issue
with this bill is that uh you've
got utilities that are having to
qualify the low income
customers, which we don't have
the capability of doing. And
there's also that subsidy issue
for
Anybody that, that is allowed a
low income rate, the rest of the
customers pick up that cost and
so the, the, the, the group of
customers that's just slightly
above low income that don't
qualify these programs, we'll
see an increase in their bills.
And if you add the rate writer
aspect which is in this bill
that they're not low low income
don't pay for it, that's a
further subsidization. So those
are the reasons why we oppose
the bill. Thank you.
Uh, good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Carlos
Lucero with the Public Service
Company in New Mexico.
And it looks like um Mike
D'Antonio of Xcel Energy took
the words right out of my mouth,
because really it is the concern
is on how, how this bill and,
and putting really the burden
on, on the utilities to
determine who the low income
elig eligibility with specifying
without specifying clear
requirements leading to privacy
issues and potential
inconsistencies as people move
between counties. Um, again,
As, as Mike D'Antonio stated,
when it comes to low income rate
design and programs, you know,
PNM believes that HB 91, the,
the low income bill that's been
introduced on the House side
achieves what SB 156 and 10s
without putting the burden on
low-income customers and
protecting their personal
information. So we respectfully,
respectfully oppose this bill,
and we thank the sponsor for
bringing it to our attention.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Lucero. There was
someone online, but I understand
they're gone.
Is there anyone else that
opposes this bill?
OK, we're 5 minutes left with
the for the opponents. Um, now
I'll move it on to the
committee. So far we have a
center Hamblin and then we have
Senator Hazel.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I'd
like to just really make a
comment to thank the sponsor for
bringing this bill, um, in the
past, we've, uh, shared similar
approaches to helping those who
are experiencing poverty or who
live in poverty and in my
district in southern New Mexico,
I feel that any opportunity for
folks to reduce their utility
costs is welcome.
Um, you know, in the last 20
minutes, I was just informed
that um my office has received
almost a dozen calls from my
constituents in District 38 who
are in support of this.
And, you know, to me this is
about equity and fairness when
it comes down to our residents
and those who are working 2 to 3
jobs to try and make ends meet.
And although they may not be
able to afford a solar system.
This is giving them, this is
removing one barrier, one more
barrier, uh, so that they can go
ahead and uh purchase renewable
energy for their homes. And so I
do feel that this is a win for
our state, and I appreciate the
sponsor bringing this bill
forward.
That's all, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Hamlin, uh
Dreel.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much, Madam Chair.
An expert witness that I do have
about 3 questions here. I
noticed in your bill that you
have counties that are certain
size that are excluded. Excuse
me, and these are the largest
county.
And this, uh, it won't, it seems
to me like it won't apply to the
more heavily populated areas of
the state.
Oh, is that the intent that
we're trying to go for here, am
I reading this wrong, madam
chair.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator,
could you?
I don't
Connect with that comment. So
could you tell me the page
you're referring to?
Well, when it, Madam Chair and.
Madam Chair, I'm sorry. Uh, hold
on here just a minute. I've got
to pull it back up here on this,
Where is that?
I don't
Remember us
Limiting
Oh,
but that's why I'm asking.
OK.
I thought it might be
Maybe I'm just reading it wrong.
I was looking at page 9, I
believe that's where it is. OK.
It talks about class A and class
B.
Yes, ma'am, and then you go on
down, well, my, OK, I'm just
gonna leave that one alone,
madam chair, uh.
Whenever you're going through
your definitions of Madam Chair,
Madam Chair, this is confusing
here. You don't know which one
I'm addressing. I can be
senator.
OK.
Oh
Whenever you're going through
your definitions, how does uh
making the determination on a
low income, how does that relate
back to the light heat
definition.
So, Madam Chair and senator,
thank you for the question. The
lie heap, the snap, and the um.
Medicaid
qualify people based upon income
and uh so the light he customers
would qualify under this uh
program. The big question
probably for some people would
be the category of self
attestation.
And so I understand that uh some
of the companies might not be.
Extremely comfortable with that.
But we have a variety of other
programs in the state that are
federally qualified and even
affordable housing.
getting into low income housing,
um.
And all the other ones I
mentioned, so people were really
uncomfortable with that one
category.
Uh, we would understand that.
And Madam chair and.
Madam Senator chair.
Uh
I know that in our FIR that
there is a concern from the uh.
Healthcare Authority over that
particular definition.
And I, I'm just wondering if we
are taking into account any of
the other federal or state
services or benefits that are,
are they going to be taken into
account.
For the definition that you are
proposing under this particular
bill.
Um,
Madam Chair and Senator, are you
asking if those
Different programs would qualify
somebody to be low income and if
so, that's yes.
The snap, uh, uh, low low income
housing, the Medicaid, that
like.
OK, well, Madam Chair, I guess
my concern is if they're already
participating in the
participating in all these other
programs that.
That might kind of
I don't know, I, I just see it.
sometimes one sided, if you
wanna go that route.
I
There are lots of programs out
there for low income families,
and I'm not disagreeing with
what they are trying to do, but
it says those that are uh lie.
Is the who's
Helps us people who the
customers whose income is at or
below 150% of the federal
poverty guidelines, but if
they're also receiving benefits
from the state and from the feds
for other
Services
Where there might be a need
someplace else for those
services to go. That's my
concern, Madam Chair.
Um
I, I'm looking here at what my
county is at right now, the
median income right there in
Travis County.
is 65% and then Eddy County, the
median income is way above that.
I'm
I'm bothered by.
I, I guess one other thing I do
need.
clarified here.
Is what it, tell me what a new
interconnected customer is,
Madam Chair, Madam.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I'm
gonna have my expert witness,
Christian Casillas, uh, respond
to that. OK, thank you very
much.
Madam Chair, senator, a new and
interconnected customer is a
customer that applies to one of
the investor owned utilities to
interconnect a rooftop solar
system to the grid.
Some
Can you repeat that one more
time.
Looking at the new solar.
It's uh a household that is
hooking up a rooftop solar
system to the to the um investor
owned utilities grid.
And Madam chair, madam cheer,
Mister Casilla, would this be
like a community project or
would it be individual
homeowners or maybe a house that
is rented by a person that is of
low income, that does qualify
for the LIE programs.
Uh, Madam Chair, senator, it
would be a household.
That is in, in this case, it
would be a household that
qualifies as a low-income
household, which is uh um
Income below 80% of the area
median income, which is also
consistent with the community
solar definition of low income.
OK, thank you very much. That's
all, Madam Chair. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Azel. Senator
Townsend.
Yes, ma'am. Sure, thank you. A
couple.
Uh, do we have um
Senator, do we have a number of
how many people we believe this
will help or impact.
Um, Madam Chair and Senator,
thank you for the question. I'm
going to turn back to.
Madam Chair, Senator, uh,
nationwide right now, we know
that the majority of homeowners
that are able to participate in
rooftop solar or medium income
and higher, and that is most
certainly true here in the state
of New Mexico, right now we
don't know how many low income
households have rooftop solar,
my guess would be very few.
Um, the goals of, uh, several
programs that are unfolding
right now. Hope to uh connect
low income households to rooftop
solar, either through lease.
Purchase
Or grants and that will likely
be something like 5000 to 8000
over the next 5 years and just
to um put that in scale. There's
760,000 residential customers,
um, that are part of the
investor owned utilities, so
concerns about cross
subsidization or
really be absolutely negligible.
what I'm
Uh, the point I'm trying to
understand is there was a
comment made by
One of the
I'm not sure. I don't even know
what side, but there was a
comment made that
This would certainly lower the
cost.
Uh, to some,
But others will have to bear the
cost, and I'm trying to figure
out how many is it gonna help
and how many are gonna have
higher prices because of it. Do
we know that?
Madam Chair, senator, um, in the
next to, to, in the next 5
years, we're hoping to see
something like 5000 low income
households have their savings
preserved by future potential
rate riders imposed by the
utilities, um, in terms of those
that it would hurt, I think the
answer is probably almost 0.
How many again?
And again, there's 760,000.
Uh, residential customers, um,
on the, uh, with the investor
owned utilities.
So, um,
Senator expert, just so I'm
trying to grasp it.
We're gonna, we're gonna help.
About 5000.
through this over the next few
years.
So that would mean 700 and
55,000 would have slightly
higher bills because of it. Is
that right?
Madam Chair, Senator, uh, likely
no. So right now, there is no
rate rider for um solar
customers. So we're not asking
for any subsidy here. We are
just asking to preserve the
benefits that would accrue to
any low income household that
connects to the the grid right
now, any solar customer that
connects there's a net metering
program, um.
And they receive bill discounts
based on the solar energy they
produce. We're just asking to
make sure that those benefits
are preserved for low and low
income customers that are able
to and I hear that, and I
appreciate it, Madam Chair,
Senator, the point I'm trying
to, I, I, I think I heard and
maybe we need to get the expert
back up is.
This bill is certainly gonna
help.
5000 people, not arguing that.
But as we take them.
As we, as we help them move.
To a solar, um,
Grid
We're gonna reduce the amount of
power that is taken off of the
Off of the
Utility grid.
And so, the maintenance of that
system.
Is paid on a kilowatt basis.
So
When you move them over to when
you're moving more of the burden
onto those people that are using
More power or if, if a person
comes 100% off the grid, but
still stays interconnected. And
through the process of the
solar, he's using some, um,
You know, during the day and
recharge at night, have, you
know, however it works. If you
zero the out to where they're
really not a net user off the
grid.
In those maintenance costs.
Or that other people.
are incurring
Goes up a little bit. So we're
helping 5000 and we're
increasing slightly, although I,
I, I grant you that, but you're
increasing slightly everybody
else. Is that correct?
Chair, senator, it's hard to
say, so it would require a cost
benefit study as current statute
requires for any proposed rate
rate rider. So when any solar
system comes on, there's a net
benefit and cost. It reduces
load on lines, reduces wear and
tear of, of um uh converters,
um, there are a number of
benefits that need to be
weighed. Um, so the answer is I
don't know.
And you got the, the one point
exactly correct. It is a, a
small fractional amount, uh,
less than 1% of um
Of the the current residential
un users that we expect to be
low income so I appreciate that,
but certainly, um, Madam Chair,
and Senator, it doesn't lower
everybody's costs. I mean,
somebody's gonna pay those other
costs and, and although it is
It is small. It's, it's there.
Um
Or
And I'm remembering um.
And I may have, I may have this
all wrong, maybe Senator.
And help me on this, but
Today, a family of 4 in New
Mexico.
That meets the poverty.
threshold of this deal.
It's like $60,000. Is that
correct? is that right? Yes,
Madam Chair, Senator, and, um,
the FIR page 2. There's a 80 at.
Household incomes at 80% of the
median income.
4 persons would be 63,100, OK.
The, the point I, I think that
we
There's many people in New
Mexico.
that are on
Retired, fixed incomes.
They're just barely above the
poverty level.
And that little bit that we're
gonna increase their bill may
drive them into the poverty
level.
And so I would just, I, I'm
concerned that
We're gonna help
5000, which I'm, I have no
problem in helping.
But I have to be cognizant of
the fact that I'm increasing the
cost.
On
A multiple of 100.
Higher than that. So,
That, that's a problem for me,
but I'll continue to listen to
the.
The questions. I appreciate.
Thank you, Senator Townsend.
Senator Scott.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, expert.
Could you
Describe how this.
Low income qualification will
come to.
Will come to be in existence.
That is what would
The utility company need to have
to.
qualify.
Customs low income.
chair, senator.
Um
As, as background we engaged in
uh several conversations with uh
PNM and Excel, um, at the, the
moment of those multiple
conversations, they didn't
express any concern um about
particular aspects of the bill,
the, the final portion of the
bill.
Um
Requires the utilities to send
out an annual survey.
And uh that survey explains to
um uh
Uh, customers what they need to
do in order to qualify as low
income. So that would only be of
interest to a low income
household that is putting solar
on the roof or has put solar on
their roof and to qualify, they
would either need to be um show
proof of the existing um
pre-qualified programs that
they're already a part may
already be enrolled in such as
LiE, Medicaid, Snap. If they
aren't involved in any of those,
then
they can sign a self attestation
form that would say how many uh
family members are in their
household and uh an estimate of
their annual income. Um, this is
a best practice nationwide. It's
completely consistent with um
the community solar program uh
for their requirements for low
income qualification. It would
alleviate the concern that was
expressed earlier today from PNM
about storing any sort of
sensitive information. This
doesn't require
the submission of any um
Uh, sensitive IRS information,
anything like that, just as a
signature of self attestation.
And
Madam Cha an expert, how long
does this qualification last?
Madam Chair, Senator, um, the
That wording in the bill says
that a household wants their
qualified, would not have to be
re-qualified for a period of 5
years.
OK.
And I, I think.
I understand the concept and
that.
This
If this bill passes.
Low income.
Households could purchase or
lease.
The solar system.
And be installed on their house.
And then not have to pay.
I in an interconnection the.
Is, is that accurate?
What fear we abating.
With
This
piece of legislation in addition
to
In a future rate riders that
might be oncoming. What fear we
abating today.
Madam Chair, Senator, no other
fees. This is only protecting
against future rate riders that
any utility has a right to go to
the PRC and request for
ancillary services and standby
charges for solar systems and
this bill does not right now,
any low-income household could
go ahead and participate in a
program to put solar on their
roof. It doesn't enable that
program.
What it does is it protects
their future savings over the
lifetime of that system from
being eroded due to a potential
future rate rider that the
utilities have a right to
request.
Oh, OK, so there.
There is
Madam Chair, expert, there is no
effect today.
On
Any charges that might accrue.
To that low income household at
all. This is all for potential.
Future electricity increase,
Madam Chair, Senator, that is
correct. Remember that these
systems have 20 year lifetimes,
20 to 25 year lifetimes and to
invest in a program to provide
these benefits for low income
households, um, we want to have
a surety that these households.
Uh, savings will be preserved.
So
So, Madam Chair, Senator and
expert.
We would be, we would be
guaranteeing to these low-income
households.
That they won't have any
increases in their electricity
rates forever.
Oh no
Madam Chair, Senator, no, it
doesn't, it doesn't say anything
about the electricity rates. The
trend will be electricity rates
will continue as they have in
the past, um, on average PNM
electricity rates over the last
Um
20 years of have increased an
average of 2%. We're seeing much
greater now with the recent rate
increase requesting 30% increase
as those rates increase, any
solar customers savings will
increase because they have uh a
fixed benefit from that
investment in the solar.
So their savings will only
increase. This is not
guaranteeing anything about what
their rates may be in the future
or not, all it does is preserve
them from any future rate
riders. As an example, in 2014
PNM brought before the PRC in a
rate case or request for a $6
per kilowatt, um, chart rate
writer for standby and ancillary
charges that was not approved,
but that remains a risk.
But Madam Chair and expert that
goes into the
Into the bill of the.
customers that are not.
Able to take advantage of this.
So that would be in effect an
increase in their electricity
bill, maybe not the rate.
But it would increase the bill.
Is that?
Actually
Madam chair, Senator, that is
correct, for a rooftop solar
owner.
OK, and given the fact that
That uh these systems
Would only serve.
To increase the savings.
As these various costs go up.
I guess the obvious question
would be.
Madam Chair, and expert.
Why do we need this?
Madam Chair, Senator, it just uh
as, as an example of that uh
request in 2014 by PNM $6 per
kilowatt. If that was went into
effect today, that would erode
the majority of savings that any
customer would have and
specifically low-income
customers where these programs
are being designed designed to
try to make meaningful, uh,
reductions in their energy
burdens.
So, Madam Chair, an expert, the
margin on these things is $6.
That's the difference?
Madam Chair, Senator, um, that's
6 bucks per kilowatt. um, so an
average, and again this was
2014, an average household
system is about 5 kilowatts. So
that would be uh an additional
$30 per month um charge to a
solar customer.
OK, so that.
That's $30 then, Madam Chair,
expert.
would be
Distributed
Amongst all of those other
customers.
That not that would not be taken
advantage of this program.
Is that correct?
Madam Chair, Senator, I'm not
sure I understand the question.
OK.
Madam Chair and expert, this.
This program eliminates.
$30 a month.
And
In utility those charges.
Or then absorbed.
Elsewhere in the system.
And that would be by customers
not participating in these
programs.
Is that correct?
Madam Chair, Senator, that is a
possibility uh utilities have a
right to recover their costs,
how those costs are recovered
over the different classes of
ratepayers is a determination
made at the PRC through through
hearings. There's no precedent
right now that I'm aware of, of
a rate rider on a residential
class within uh 4 ancillary
services and standby charges
for.
Solar in New Mexico. So it has
yet to be determined how those
costs would be covered by
A utility um excluding this
small handful, again, less than
1% of customers that might be
low income with the solar
system.
OK.
I, I think I
Yeah now got a grip on.
What else goals and objectives
are. Thank you, sir. Thank you,
Senator, for your answers.
Thank you Senator Scott Senator

And sapphonics, yes.
Senator Pope to explain his
vote. Sure, I just uh wanted to
thank the sponsor didn't get to
comment and just say thanks for
doing this, and this is really
just helping our low-income
users, low-income individuals
here get renewable clean energy
because they deserve it as well.
Thank you.
Thank you and Madam Chair, you
have a Du pass on a vote of 5 to
3.
Thank you, Madam Chair and all
members of the committee.
Uh, you said you're OK because
your bill is likely to take a
little bit longer with going
last, we could start it or
rolling over to till Saturday,
so then, uh, Senator Woods with
your roof you need to.
OK, would you call Senator
Woods?
Secretary.
Uh, madam's chair, I can briefly
explain, uh, Senator Woods and
my bill before I leave and
hopefully he could come over and
if not, then we'd have to roll
it.
OK.
So someone is calling Senator
Woods.
I'm here.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, this came out of the
water and Natural Resources
Committee, um, the.
In particular, Senator Woods and
representative Zamora have had
constituents including cities
that have come forward and
indicated that.
Not all of our.
Uh, solar producers.
Have been totally above board.
And so we debated, he and I on
whether or not we needed a new
statute regarding this.
And the department, Energy,
minerals and Natural Resources,
which has the solar.
tax credit rebate.
Indicated that the Department of
Justice.
The AG's office has a
Um
A statement on its website on
how people can file complaints.
About
Uh, producers that have not come
forward and done.
The good work that they were
supposed to, so this bill, the
energy, minerals and natural
resources department and I'm not
doing this bill great justice,
but here's the intent, said,
well, we can do this, but we
might need a little bit of money
to update our website to.
Go forward and tell consumers
what their rights are, how they
can make complaints about
producers, etc. So this, this is
an appropriations bill.
And so rather than having a
statute.
That would tell energy, minerals
and natural resources, what they
have to do. They said they would
do it if we could give them a
little bit more money.
So that's what Senator Woods and
my bill does.
Thank you. Are there, um, are
there any, is there anyone in
the audience in support of this
bill?
We have 12 hands. Anybody
opposed to this bill?
In the audience. Anybody online?
OK. So we have just 2 people in
support of the bill, um, would
you just want to come up behind
Madam Chair and.
Make your statements. Thanks,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, just like an all
industries, they're bad actors
and
People like me like to complain
when people are acting badly
when JetBlue cancels all the
flights to Albuquerque, and so
making sure that when solar
operators are giving false
statements or failing to come
through on their promises that
there's an easy way to report
that. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.
Porter.
Madam Chair
Madam sponsor, thank you for
bringing this forward. We know
that the harm that has been done
to many homeowners who have
purchased uh solar from
unscrupulous people who either
have not disclosed the full
breadth of the responsibility
that they had.
Outright lied that they would
never pay another energy bill.
Did not tell them that their
house would be leaned.
Uh, until for 30 years.
Have damaged the whole industry
and we've got great actors in
New Mexico who are doing a
really good job. They need to be
supported and these other folks,
we need to know who they are so
we can act accordingly. Thank
you. Thank you, Ms. Porter, um,
and then no one was online, so
now let's turn to the committee,
um.
Committee members, Senator
Townsend.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair. I
wanna make sure this is a
$100,000.
Influx into the
I
Um, and innert to build a
website or
Is that right? That, that's all
we're doing, yes, to include
information on their website on
how consumers can file
complaints and also linked to
the AG's document.
And is this for any, any
complaint or just rooftop solar,
what are, what are we trying to
do here?
Madam Chair Senator, thank you
for the question. It has to do
with solar complaints, so it
could be for more than um.
rooftop in the comments since
they came more from Senator
Woods and Representative Zamora
was about solar producers that
were outside of our state.
That were coming in selling a
product and then that then not
following.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator.
Thank you. Any other committee
member? Senator Azel.
Madam Che I move a do pass.
Do I hear a second 2nd.
Madam Secretary, will you take
the vote?
Senator Cervantes, excuse
senator Charlie, yes.
Senator Charlie, yes, Senorel,
yes, Senorel, yes, Senator
Hamblin.
Excuse, Senator Pope.
Yes. And Pope, yes, and her
Scott.
Yes. And Scott, yes, Senator
Townsend.
Townsend, yes, Senator Dia
Lopez.
Yes, Lopez, yes, Center to
Phonics,
Phonics, yes.
Would someone call Senator
Campos for the next pill,
please.
OK.
Um,
on a vote of 7 years and 2
excused, you're, you have a
unanimous due pass. Thank you
very much. We'll let Senator
Woods know this and maybe
somebody could let him know he
doesn't need to come now.
Yes. Oh, he's Senator Woods. Oh,
no, Senator Campos come up. I
thought you said Senator Campos,
please come up.
you're, we're on SB 20208
irrigation works fund annual
transfer.
June.
I understand it's an
appropriations bill.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
Uh, before you have a Senate
Bill 208.
And basically what it does is it
proposes to amend language
relating to transfers from the
irrigation.
Works construction fund to the
Osean Community ditch
Infrastructure Fund increasing
the annual transfer amount.
From 2.5 million to 5 million,
uh, Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
A few years back, we went ahead
and we set this up and it has
been working extremely well.
And with me is uh Paula Garcia,
who is the
Uh, executive director for the
New Mexicose Association, and if
I could defer to her excuse me
just a minute, Senator Woods,
your bill passed. You're a
little late, but your bill
passed
Thank you. I apologize. He was
looking around trying to figure
out what's going on.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair. And so with that, if I
may respectfully defer, of
course, to my expert to uh go
into detail a little bit in
regards to why we're seeking the
additional $2.5 million for this
particular.
fun, so if I may, Madam Chair,
refer to Paula Garcia.
Thank you Ms. Garcia. Please
proceed thank you. Good morning,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is Paula
Garcia and I'm executive
director of the New Mexico Ase
Association and we uh work to
advance interest through
education and advocacy and um
Senate Bill 208 as was mentioned
by Senator Campos would increase
the the allocation from the
irrigation work construction
fund to the second community
ditch infrastructure fund from
2.5 million to 5 million a year.
The most important reason for
this is that there's a, a
tremendous unmet need for a
second infrastructure funding
we've compiled a list of second
needs, and it's, it's not a
complete list, but we've
identified 75 million in unmet
needs around the state. Um, the
second point I'd like to make is
that the 2nd comedic
infrastructure Fund, which is a
recently uh created program at
the Interst Stream Commission at
the Ascentia bureau, uh, has a
very good track record of
completing projects.
in the most recent fiscal year
uh for their work plan, they had
a 90% completion rate for their,
for their, um.
Uh, a second program. Um, uh,
third, the purpose of the
irrigation works construction
fund is to fund irrigation
projects and uh this helps to
fulfill that purpose and um um
available to answer any
questions about either the AECA
fund or the trust fund as
needed. Thank you, Madam Chair.
We're available for questions.
Thank you. Um, is there anybody
in the audience in support of.
Anybody opposed.
Online?
So with the supporter just keep
coming in and briefly state your
support.
In support?
Thank you.
Good morning. My name is Justin
Garroot. I'm a registered
lobbyist with Conservation
Voterss New Mexico. We stand in
support of this bill.
Thank you and I believe someone
is online.
Uh, Sarafina online.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee, I am a
commissioner on this second
Marriba and Chimayo and on the
executive board of our regionale
association, we recognize um how
much this bill will support the
immense needs of our sector is
to continue improving and
maintaining our second
infrastructure while also
adapting to climate change and
extreme drought and flood
conditions, and we really
appreciate everybody's support
on this bill. Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Um, so with no opposition, I'll
turn to the committee, Senator
Townsend. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Uh, Senator, um,
Oh, can you tell us what this
money will be used for and what
are the needs of the Asakia and
does, does this meet all your
needs and you'll never need any
more. I mean, exactly what, what
does this do? Madam Chair and
Senator Thompson, thank you for,
for the question.
This, this fund would go a long
way in meeting some of our
needs, but the, the needs are,
are actually much greater. In
fact, uh, because of the huge
number of executives across the
state, um, there are 700 Asecas
and 23 different counties and we
don't have a comprehensive list,
but looking at the compilation
of Capital Outlay, uh, unfunded
capital outlay for the last
year, the ICIPs for the current
fiscal year, and
Uh, an analysis of the disaster
needs, uh, for 25% cost share.
Um, altogether, uh, those are
around 70 million.
And that's just one, you know, 1
to 2 years. The other amount,
uh, additional is that the, the
current program is only
receiving 2.5 million a year.
Uh, because they've been getting
special appropriations from the
legislature of about 5 million a
year for about the last 4 years,
they've been able to, to spend
more. So in, in fiscal year 24,
the ISC um spent $6 million and
that was the 90% completion rate
and in the current fiscal year,
their work plan is uh 5.8
million. So the, the 2.5 is
definitely falling short of what
the current ICDIF has been able
to get.
through their, their their
program. Um, with the disaster
needs, I'd like to elaborate
just a little bit is uh that
disasters are eligible for
federal funding. Um, in 2024 we
had two major disasters. Well,
they were categorized as one,
but they're two different
locations in Lincoln County, we
had some post-fire flooding, uh,
about 30 seconds were impacted,
and in Ria Riba, there was some
uh flooding from an old burn
scar from the old.
grounded fire. And just with uh
those needs, um.
There, there's a 25% cost share
required for FEMA public
assistance and for the NRCS.
Emergency watership program and
uh those needs were in the tens
of millions. Um, I don't have
the exact number, but we added
the 25% cost share needed, um.
It's supposed to be a local cost
share, but of course, um, a sick
kids don't have that kind of uh,
of, of income. So, um that's why
we are, are approaching the
state to help cover that cost
share. The interstate Stream
commission of Secuureau has
covered the cost share in in
other recent disasters, for
example, uh, in the Blackly, we
had about 25 in the southwestern
New Mexico as second that were
impacted and the Interstate
stream commission was able to
use some of the special
appropriation to
cover the 25% cost share in that
case. Uh, so the needs are vast
and, uh, this bill does get us
in the right direction. Thank
you, Senator and Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, Paula, if you would
expound, don't you have a list
of like priority projects today
that you want to address.
Uh, Madam Chair, and, and uh
Senator Townsend, um, we, we
would be able to provide a list
from the Interstate stream
commission that we can ask them
to do that. Um, so our, our role
is just to advocate for the
funding and they're the
technical professionals that
help to rank them based on
project readiness, uh, and I, I
don't think they're here and I
think they would have been here.
Oh, they just walked in. Oh,
good. um I'm glad they're here.
Thank you, Madam, would you be?
Uh, willing to answer that
question?
Or do you know, did you hear the
question?
OK, um, Senator Townsend, would
you repeat the question we now
have interstate uh commission.
You're just on time lady today.
Um, and, can you tell me this,
does theacs.
Via the interstate stream
commission. Do you have a list
of priority projects.
And, and further that since
you're here, how do you
prioritize them so that we know
we're getting the best bang.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee, Hannah
Risley White, I'm the director
of the New Mexico Interstate
Stream Commission.
Um, so I would answer in two
ways, uh, Senator Townsend,
under the guidelines for the
Asaka and community
infrastructure fund. There's a
ranking system that's been
developed for those applications
that we receive, um, that set of
guidelines was developed in
conjunction with the New
Mexicosea Commission and the New
Mexicoseki Association and is
intended to help prioritize
where there's the greatest need.
I couldn't actually speak to the
specifics of the
for the ranking, but I'd be
happy to provide that to you.
And then, you know, that
includes the for the
applications that we receive.
We've also been doing a lot of
thinking with those entities and
New Mexico Department of Finance
and Administration on how to do
a more comprehensive statewide
assessment of the full range of
needs out there which are
significant, so hopefully that
helps answer the question. Thank
you for that. Thank you,
Senator. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Oh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator, how much money is in
the
Uh, irrigation works
construction fund.
Uh, uh, Madam Chair and of
course Senator Scott, what we're
doing right now the uh state
engineer is uh looking at those
numbers to see exactly what the
uh the amount is. We don't have
that right at hand, but.
Take us
About a minute any.
Yeah, I, I have it.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator Scott for the
indulgence. We're just looking
at the number.
And then a corollary to that
question, Madam Chair and
senator would be how his money
added to.
The construction fund.
So, so, uh, Madam Chair, what
I'm gonna do is again defer uh
Senator Scott, I believe we can
have those answers coming up as
uh as we're talking.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair and
senators appreciate the
conversation we're working to
get the exact balance now for
you and really appreciate that
question. I wanna just uh
emphasize and you all maybe
heard us speak about this
before, um.
The agency has some concerns
with additional depletions for
the fund for this purpose, we
very much support this
initiative. We see great need,
as I said earlier, from our
secus across the state, the
additional 2.5 million would
absolutely be well put to use,
and also, uh, I just wanted to
note the executive
recommendation moving in the
budget includes a swap, uh,
which would replace current
agency dependency on those.
funds for general fund.
That swap is not included in the
LFC's budget in the absence of
that swap occurring, we have
concerns about continued uh
depletions from the trust fund.
But most importantly, it's
critical for the agency's
operations to get moved off of
those trust funds, they were
intended to support irrigation
works, not agency operations. So
we're very much advocating and I
have more information about this
and happy to share it for what's
in the executive recommendation,
which would be to replace agency
dependency on the trust funds
with general fund.
And
We're still working on getting
this number. Hold on one second.
So Senator Scott, at this point,
it doesn't seem like we're able
to go ahead and come up with the
uh the number we have several
people that are working on that.
Uh, if there's some additional
questions while we're waiting,
if you don't mind, please, so we
can move forward. Is that?
Uh, Madam Chair, senator was
just one more.
But
Obviously my concern would be
You know, the inflows to that
fund have to.
be greater than or equal to the
outflow, so.
We're doubling the outflow.
That
could
pose some issues going forward
and last.
This is actually my last
question.
With respect to these sea
projects.
Are these conducted completely
with state money or to the local
entities have to participate.
With some portion of that.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
great question with that we have
the information to provide you
on the previous question and on
this one as well. I'm going to
defer to the experts to uh
further uh elaborate. Thank you.
Thank you. I apologize for the
delay, Madam Chair. Senator
Scott, uh, on the, on the
previous question on the
balances, um,
The um
The ending balance, uh, fiscal
year 23, 19,000, the unaudited
uh ending balance for fiscal
year 24 is, I mean, 19 million.
And for um
Fiscal year 24, was 22.8
million.
Um
And the
Ase appropriate allocation out
of the fund is 2.5 million.
The operating budget.
Um
That's included in the uses on
this table. This is a table from
the LFC.
Uh, it's a supplemental table,
um, the operating budget for the
Office of State Engineer ISC is
about 5.5 million, um, the
income.
And the sources, total sources
is in fiscal year 24 unaudited.
What's about, uh, 11.5 million.
About
2, roughly 2.5 million out of
that fund annually.
And the balance
After the last withdrawal was 19
million, did I?
hear that correctly.
In that unaudited fiscal year 24
was 22.8 million. OK, so a
little less than 10%.
So that fund was sinking.
Even before this increase.
In the withdrawal.
No.
We've got about.
5 years to work with here, so,
uh, just be cognizant that uh
something else will need to be
done.
Somewhere down the road now to
the second question, Madam
Chair.
Uh.
What percentage?
Of each of these projects would
be shouldered by the local
entity and how much.
Would the state be responsible
for percentage wise.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Scott, uh, the current, um,
guidelines of
Add additional points for those
seconds that are the applicants
that are able to provide.
Costs shared towards completion
of their project. So it's a,
it's an incentive based system,
but it, it's not a limiting
requirement. So, um, the statute
doesn't require a cost share and
the guidelines don't require
caution, but if they do provide
costure, they get additional
points and they rank higher.
That's my understanding of how
the guidelines are currently
structured.
Many of the projects that are
funded by the ACTIF do receive
federal cost share.
There is a uh.
S program that's called the
Resource Conservation
Partnership Program, and the New
Mexico Association of
Conservation Districts, uh,
works closely with the
Interstate stream Commission and
they collaborate to find areas
where the RCPP provides 50% and
the ISC provides 50% and that
that's been a successful effort
because they help to leverage
federal funds and then the other
example, they've they've been um
instances where
uh special appropriations have
been used to leverage federal
dollars for disasters. And that
was a 2575 cost share. Another
program that's a federal state,
um, partnership is the Army
Corps of Engineers, and that's a
9010 cost share, so the, the
federal government provides 90
and the state provides 10.
I like the concept of
Providing
Uh, higher point score to those
folks that are willing.
Either go out seeking grants or
People to put some of their own
skin in the game.
Now,
Of this why is there, is there
any money?
Coming out of this construction
fund.
Or other purposes besides.
these this transfer.
Madam Chair, and uh Senator
Scott.
Yes, there are, there's at least
one other program, the um
Watershed fund at Amner, and
that that's also uh an
allocation of a million dollars
per year, and I would defer to,
to.
No.
OK, you may have,
madam chair and Senator Scott,
yeah, there's a couple of other
hands in the cookie jar,
including that watershed fund,
um, and I can't remember the
other one at this point. They
are very good programs, but also
not what the funds were
originally intended for.
And
Mour to Miss White, do we know
what those dollar amounts are
that are being withdrawn.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Scott, I believe in total those
amount to between 20 or 2.5
million between those two other,
uh,
Two other uh annual depletions
from the trust funds that are
not uh related to construction
works. In addition to the agency
budget dependency
operating budget Madam Chair, we
are accelerating that depletion
that I just mentioned a minute
or two.
Thank you for your answers and
thank you, Madam Chair. That's
all I have.
Thank you and uh Senator Azel
has a question, Madam Chair,
thank you very much in your
presentation, senator.
And uh expert witness, you
talked about cost share from the
Army Corps of Engineers. Can you
give me that?
Differentiate differentiate
right there.
Madam Chair, Senator, the Army
Corps of Engineers Thank you
program. It's, uh, it's called
11:13, it's part of the water
resourceslopment Act at the
federal level and that one
covers 90% and the state cost
share is 10%.
Thank you very much. That's all,
madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Townsend.
Madam Chara of Du Pa.
The 2nd manager.
OK, Madam Secretary, would you
take the vote?
Senator Cervantes,
yes, Senator Charlie.
Senator Charlie, yes, Senator.
Sara, no.
Senator Hamblin.
Senator Hamlin excuse, Senator
Pope.
Yes. Senator Pope, yes, Senator
Scott.
Yes
Senator Scott, yes, Senator
Townsend.
Senator Townsend, yes, Senator
Lopez, yes, San Lopez,
Stephonics is excuse.
Senator Campos on a vote of 7
yes, 1 no, and 2 excuse, you
have a, a do pass. Thank you
very much, madam. Thank you
members of the Senate
Conservation Committee.
Then it years is the next bill
as well, um, we have, um.
A little less than 30 minutes.
Um
Would you like to go ahead and
present that bill?
I understand you have an
amendment, uh, Madam Chair, yes
we do. And so what we'll do is
we'll go ahead and we'll get
started.
from there.
It's usual, it's usually easier
if you explain the amendment and
then the bill 661.
61.
To, right.
So thank you very much, uh,
Madam Chair, members of the
Senate Conservation Committee
and of course, what I'm gonna do
is ask uh
The experts to go ahead and
briefly identify themselves and
so we can specifically talk
about the amendment before we
get into the explanation of the
bill. And so if I may do that,
because we want to make sure
this is something that uh I
understand just came out uh as
as early as yesterday, so about
24 hours ago. We just want to
make sure that it's uh it's uh
properly explained, so if I may,
Madam Chair, uh, I'm going to
defer to the experts if they'll
identify themselves and be able
to move forward, specific to the
Amendment.
Thank you. I apologize for
interrupting again. I, um, it
was a mistake on the tally, the
last bill that you got a do pass
on was 6, yes, 10 and 2 excused.
Apologize, thank you very much,
Madam Chair.
We're ready to proceed.
Uh
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Nat Jaris.
I am the general counsel to the
Mexico State Engineer, uh, when
we get into the bill, we'll,
we'll talk about what the, what
the overall purpose of the bill
is, but the um one of the big
things we're really that's the
big thing we're doing with this
bill is trying to update the
types of penalties that uh may
be appropriate for violations of
the water code and the amendment
uh stems from some discussions
uh that we had, uh.
Relating to whether the
penalties were sufficient
specifically for um
Oil field water sales, and some
of those water sales can be
pretty expensive and there can
be a pretty high incentive for
folks to, to sell and then hope
they don't get caught. And the
current, the, the, the bill as
introduced.
Has
Double the economic benefit to
the violator of those types, for
those types of sales, and it was
pointed out in some
conversations with some, uh,
some senators on this committee
as, as well as others that
An easy thing to to determine
and a per barrel penalty on
those types of illegal sales was
a more clear and effective
deterrent. And so that would be
an alternative maximum.
penalty for the uh sale of
illegal sale of water. And so on
page 4 line 12 of the bill, um,
There is a new alternative
maximum penalty, which would be
$25 per barrel of water sold,
and then either with
If that's greater than double
the economic benefits to the
violator, then that would be the
new maximum. And then there's a
few other uh housekeeping
amendments that say, because
there's two different figures
now in the maximum penalty. We
changed the word amount to
amounts and and increase to
increases when we're uh uh
describing an inflationary
adjustment to those figures. So
that's the entire amendment.
I'm sure.
That's what we present to you,
Madam Chair, and it's uh
0.230782.1.
Thank you. Are there any um
supporters in the audience of
the amendment.
We have one supporter of the
amendment, 2 supporters of the
amendment. Are there any
opponents to the amendment in
the audience?
If you could just briefly state
your support or opposition or do
you need to, do you feel no, no
needs for comment.
OK. Um,
Is there anyone online about the
amendment?
Does anyone oppose the amendment
on the on the committee?
With that, your amendment is,
um, is now part of the bill, so
we can return to the bill. Thank
you very much, Madam Chair.
Thank you, members of the Senate
Conservation Committee, as we
all know as we move forward, we
continue to go ahead and see
individuals who are utilizing
water illegally.
And within that, what it does is
it continues to create concern
first of all, of course, for
the, uh,
Illegal use of water and then
secondly, of course, with the
amount that
Uh, the penalty has been in the
past, uh, it, it doesn't serve
as the discouragement, if you
will, for uh those who are uh
operating in a purpose such as
this, uh, to become discouraged
and so the intent of this, of
course, is to uh further create
if you will, an opportunity for
those that do use water for its
proper purpose through the uh
proper process, uh, that they
continue to be allowed to do so,
but more than.
that with this particular
measure, uh, to penalize those
that are illegally using water
and so with that, Madam Chair,
uh, that briefly, uh, outlines
the bill, but if I could, I
would also like to have the
experts identify themselves and
make a brief statement regarding
a couple of things. Number one,
what led to this particular
piece of legislation, and then
secondly, as we deal with it,
uh, what may be some of the
stronger concerns might be
regarding this piece.
legislation.
That
very much, Madam Chair. Please
proceed.
Madam Chair, members of the
board. My name is Elizabeth
Anderson. I'm the state engineer
designate and um thank you for
that introduction, um, this bill
is critical for our agency, um,
but the theft of water and the
ability to deter water theft is
is something that we don't have
right now, so, um, with our
current our current statute was
in 1907, and then we haven't
changed the water penalty since
that time. So this will bring us
in, it's part of our
modernization efforts for the
the agency. It'll allow us.
to actually, um, administer
water more effectively and we
appreciate your your time with
this.
I'll pass it off to our general
counsel.
Madam Chair, thank you, uh, Nat
Shari again and uh it's, it's
been a long, long committee
hearing. I don't want to, I'm
not gonna go into a, a lengthy
recitation, but, uh, we brought
uh with um.
We brought in 2023 uh bill to
modernize our enforcement
statute, um, there were some
concerns that were raised in
this committee and elsewhere at
that time that the bill was
trying to do too much, um, and
that it might have some
unintended consequences on say
or sort of a small MDWCAs and
those kinds of things. And so
what we did is we went back in
the interim and we uh worked on
the bill, uh, I think we focused
the bill on targeted what
The real issues are that we're
trying to address and uh so
we're not trying to do things
that our last bill was trying to
do, which is, among other
things, uh, allow us to have
access to the records of people
who are, who are water rights
holders that there was a lot of
pushback against that, um, but
we're focused on increasing as
the state engineer said that the
monetary penalties for uh for
Illegal drilling or water theft.
Uh, I also want to emphasize,
however, that
If you have a normal water
rights owner who has an over
diversion, let's say the head
gates left open, let's say a
small municipal uh uh mutual
domestic over diverts one year
because they have leaky pipes.
We have been enforcing our
statutes to not go after
monetary penalties in those
situations because the adequate
deterrent is a payback of water.
We, we make them do a payback in
the following year. And what
we've also added here.
in addition to increasing the
penalties is language at the
bottom of page 3 that emphasizes
that for those types of
violations, repayment of water
is the preferred remedy. So this
provides more protection for the
smaller farmers or not so small
farmers, but for the farmers who
are just, you know, uh, not
wanting to be hit with some big
monetary penalty if they have an
accidental over diversion or, or
uh uh a cattleman or a uh a
small mutual domestic. So we put
some language in
to uh
Guide what the agency is going
to be able to do going forward
to really only go after with
monetary penalties, those types
of violations that payback of
water isn't a deterrent, and
we're seeing more of that. Theft
in the oil field of water for a
quick sale. We're seeing illegal
well drillers coming across our
state borders and then leaving
quickly, um.
potentially leaving dangerous
wells that could have, you know,
the effects of contaminating
aquifers when they're not
drilled up to standards, um, and
then we're having things like
people uh are perhaps not
metering their wells. So then we
don't know what's going on.
Well, right now there's, there's
very little deterrent if
somebody doesn't put a meter on
there. So we think, hey, if they
get a notice from us, uh, you
better put a meter on there or a
penalty is gonna start running,
that will be an effective way of
getting everything metered and
so everyone can.
everything. So that's, that's
really what we're doing is we're
trying to um
Make sure that everybody is
playing by the rules.
And uh with that uh I don't have
anything else I, I think I'll
have. Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, and we're available for
questions.
Went in the audience in support
of the bill.
Do you want to speak or are you
guys good?
Go ahead, please. So we've got 2
in the audience. We've got.
Uh, when
Online and support.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Hannah
Risley White, again, director of
the New Mexico Interstate Stream
Commission. We see this bill is
very critical as we face
increasing water scarcity, the
ability for the office of the
state engineer to enforce, um,
and ensure that legal water
users have access to that water
by deterring theft is going to
be increasingly important. And
so, very much support this bill.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ms. Feelman. Thank
you, Madam Chair members of the
committee and thank you so much
to the sponsor for bringing
this. It's no secret that our
state is in a water crisis. And
unfortunately, our best
available science tells us our
challenges related to water
quantity will only get more
challenging as we move forward.
This makes it imperative that we
ensure our agencies have the
needed um authorities to enforce
their existing water laws,
updating water law violation
penalties hasn't happened.
over 100 years, which seems
crazy. We believe this bill is
critical to creating needed
deterrents for violating New
Mexico's water laws. Thank you
so much.
Thank you. Uh, is there, uh, we
have one person online to
support uh Barbara Ellett.
Madam Chair,
Can you hear me?
Madam Chair and committee
members, I'm Barbara Cale,
lobbyist for the League of Women
Voters of New Mexico. The league
believes that government should
ensure responsible stewardship
of our natural resources,
particularly in the face of
growth and development. The
Office of the State Engineer
must have adequate tools to
enforce regulations. Please vote
yes on SB 10,210.
To increase the penalties for
water law violations. Thank you
very much.
I didn't see anyone. I'm just
gonna ask again, is there anyone
in opposition to this bill,
either in the audience or OK.
With that, I'll turn it over to
the committee.
Um, Senator Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair, just one
quick question about how this
will be enforced.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair. We're going, uh, thank
you, Senator Scott, again
deferring to our legal counsel
for the USA.
So, Madam Chair, Senator, uh,
how this will be enforced is we,
the Office of the State Engineer
has uh Watermaster and water
rights Administration staff in
each of the districts. We don't
have quite as many as we'd like,
but we're, we're working to
staff that up and they are,
they, they review meter records,
and they also are, are out in
the field and trying to find out
and hear what's going on. They
get reports uh on occasion right
now of illegal water use.
And right now, they, their hands
are pretty, pretty tied in terms
of what they can do, but what
this, what this would do now is
if they get a report of illegal
water use if this bill were law,
they would investigate it if if
if it looked like something they
could corroborate, they would
send a notice to the potential
violator, and, and that notice
would then put the violator on,
on notice that if
You know, the, the issue isn't
addressed. They may be subject
to an administrative uh uh
hearing where they could at the
end of that be assessed with one
of with one of the penalties uh
stated in the bill.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
yourself
Sinners advantage of.
Right
Madam chair, a little confused.
I really in the discussion there
was some suggestion that this
applies to um uh water used in
oil and gas production. Then I
heard the presentation with
regard to farmers as well too,
so I assume that this law is not
limited what we're talking about
here is not limited to oil and
gas, uh, used water. This is to
everybody, including farmers, is
that right? Uh, thank you very
much, Madam Chair, and, uh,
Senator Cervantes again going
back to legal counsel for the uh
uh further explanation.
Uh
Madam Chair, Senator, so there
are different, uh, there are two
different maximum penalties that
are in the bill, one of which is
general. Uh, so it would apply
to all water users in the state.
That's the $2000 a day maximum
penalty for a violation section
of the bill is this? Is this
section so we're in section um
Section 1 and, and that penalty
we're looking at uh
Page 4
Uh, the $2000 line 6.
That penalty would apply to any
violation of the water code. Um,
but then,
And line 10, if the over
diverted or illegally diverted
water is sold. So that, that is
specific just to water sales.
Um, that's not exclusive to the
oil field, but that, uh, that's,
that's one of the hot areas
where there's water sales right
now. And so there actually has
to be a commercial sale of water
for those penalties to kick in.
Madam Chair.
Mm, OK.
Um, so I'm trying to look at the
bill with structure, right? So
there's a section one, you're
saying section one applies to
all water users, then, is that
right?
Madam Cherry, yes, Senator, then
I guess the same is true with
section 2, which is on page 5
and section 3, right? There, uh,
which is on page 6, there are
all of those are applicable to
all water use.
Madam Chair, Senator, yes, and
when, and you said when water is
sold in the context of oil and
gas production, uh, is it sold
by the barrel?
Uh, Madam, Madam Chair, Senator,
that is the typical unit of sale
in the oil field, yes, right,
and, and is there agreed measure
of what a barrel of water is,
what is the volume of a barrel
of water?
Uh
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, yes,
it's 42 gallons of water.
Thank you.
And and on page 3.
Uh, I'm gonna suggest that.
Um
I'm gonna suggest in line 17, I,
I know this goes to the
judiciary, madam chair, so I'm
not gonna spend a lot of time
with it here, but um I would
suggest that you add the word um
on line 17 over over diverted
because you're, if you, if you
continue on with the
That same language, you're
saying repayment.
And I would, I would suggest
it's repayment of over diverted
water.
Is the preferred remedy because
it goes on to read the state
engineer show only pursue
penalties for violations that do
not involve over diversion.
Water, so it seems to be that
you're, that's what you're
talking about here, is that
right? So it seems like that
that would be a good um
A a good change, and then I, I
think you'd probably have to do
some work between here and
Judiciary to get a hearing on
lines 21 and 22 because as this
section for violations do not
involve.
Over the original water and
here's the, the trick for me
says or we're repayment of
water.
Not possible.
Or is insufficient to deter
future violations. That's pretty
ambiguous, right? How much water
will it take to penalize
somebody for to uh deter future
violations and, and what would
be sufficient so all of that's
pretty ambiguous. I don't see
how any court or lawyer could
ever understand what that means,
right? Um, you're gonna, you're
gonna require a violator to.
Repay water.
as the preferred remedy.
And then it says and you're not,
you're not gonna um offer that
alternative.
Where the repayment is not
possible with water or, or where
the repayment is insufficient to
deter future violations. How do
I know what you're gonna do and
say is the amount of repayment
of water that was that would be
sufficient.
To deter future violations. How,
how would anybody know what
that's gonna be?
Uh
Madam Chair, Senator, point well
taken. We will, uh, we'll, we'll
take a look at that.
Um, and do you want to, uh, um.
Senator Cervantes, um.
Amend the bill to include uh
over diverted after repayment
of.
Uh, the sponsor and his expert
find that favorable. We'll do it
here. If not, we'll do it in
judiciary do you find that to be
a friendly amendment, Madam
Chair, I'd like to, uh, not do
it on the fly. I, I think I, I
really appreciate the senator
raising it. I want to make sure
it's, we might have to say over
diverted or illegally diverted
or, you know, something along
those lines that, um,
I want to get it right, um, but
we, I don't think it's an
unfriendly amendment that, that
particular one, so, but I don't
want to do it on the that that
does make sense because I
started thinking, well, what if
it was not over diverted, it was
stolen.
It should be um there should be
um a remedy. So yes, I, I, I
think that makes a lot of sense
to wait, um, on, on the, on the
amendment, um, on the way to
judiciary and um.
As I understand it, you would
like to.
Take a vote today and worry
about the, the other change.
and along with that, if I may,
uh, to go ahead and also assure
the uh judiciary as we move
forward, we want to take a
complete look at what we have in
case there are going to be some
other uh suggested changes, so
we'll be working with uh uh the
judiciary staff.
Try to prepare that amendment
and again to go ahead and keep
that information, uh, as clean
and clear as possible as we move
forward, so, uh, with the
course, uh this committee's
indulgence, that would be the
preference, but again, we'll be
available for whatever your
suggestions would be as we move
forward with this particular
piece of legislation and the
discussion that we're going
through right now.
Thank you,
Madam Chair on the list I have
Senator Azel. Oh, I'm sorry, um,
go ahead. I apologize, Senator
Cervantes, please continues a
couple of other additional
points. I'm really surprised
there's nobody here in
opposition to this, uh.
particularly the agricultural
community. Uh, you're taking
penalties.
Senator from $100 a day to $2000
a day, that's pretty significant
to most farmers that I represent
in my district, $2000 a day can
add up pretty quickly that, you
know, once a month at $2000 a
day, what do the math quick
$60,000 a month.
Um, that a lot of money to where
I come from, so I'm, I'm really
surprised that there's nobody
here opposing this, so I'll vote
for it today and we'll see how
you do in the judiciary, but
these are pretty very
significant financial penalties
to small farmers.
That, um, and, and, uh, and
others really even large
farmers.
And so I, I think the penalties
are probably
Grossly excessive.
And then, uh, the other thing
that I have trouble with, Madam
Chair, is, uh, adding all this
CPI language with the penalties
are gonna go up, go up every
year based on the consumer price
index. To me, that's a
dereliction of our
responsibilities here. We're
doing it more and more all the
time.
And I understand some of the
point was made that we haven't
increased these penalties in a
long time.
That's true, and, and that's on
us, we should be increasing the
penalties periodically. I, I
can't recall what the testimony
was the last time they were
raised a long time ago.
Um, so we should be doing that
periodically, but, but putting
everything on autopilot around
here seems to be increasingly
what we're doing. We're more and
more delegating all the
legislating to rulemaking and
agencies and they're gonna do it
later and they're gonna decide
later when we're all gone and
back home and um and we don't
have to take the consequences or
dig into the weeds and same
thing with these penalties just
saying they're gonna go up every
year based on the consumer price
index. There's no logic to that
in my in my mind.
Some things should be tied to
consumer price index, maybe even
minimum wage and things along
those lines, but just penalties
and saying they're gonna go up
every year. That's hard to do
and um and then when you.
When you even look at the
language, this is kind of
standard language when we do
this. We, we, we're putting
these in the statutes all the
time now, but it says the amount
should be increased by the
percentage change in the
consumer price index, not
seasonally adjusted for all
urban consumers, United States
city average for all items or
its successor index as published
by the United States Department
of Labor for the preceding
calendar or your's beginning
blah blah blah you know what I
mean, how do you figure out what
that is? Uh, you're gonna need
an accountant, you're gonna need
somebody to tell you what all
those numbers mean and how you
compute that.
Yeah, every year, that's, I
don't think that's legislating
in.
Man, I'm sure you're, you're
always, uh, I think rightfully
trying to remind us that uh we
have a weak legislature and, and
you're right, I agree with that,
but I think it's mostly we
because we choose to be weak,
and we, uh, again delegate these
responsibilities to some kind of
auto pilot or somebody else,
some agency or whatever, so I
generally want to reject that,
that notion that we legislate.
by autopilot, so I'll I'll have
problems with this down the
road, but I'll vote for it today
cause there's nobody here.
Amazingly opposing it.
Thank you, ma'am.
Uh, thank you, Senator Azel.
Madam Chair, thank you very
much, Senator Cervantes. I'm
here.
And uh I do have a problem with
the.
You're wrong.
I'll just leave it at that. I am
here as a farmer as well.
And I, I think that the amount
of Charter are requesting, uh,
$2000 per day, you know.
That makes it pretty tough on a
farmer these days whenever the
records can be.
Well, I'm not gonna go down that
road because not everybody does
use.
Electricity to pump. I
understand what you're doing
right here. I, I really do. And
Senator Compos, there has been
illegal sales of water.
And whenever it does, whenever
that water.
The intent of that water well
that was drilled was either for
domestic.
Or livestock use and they are
using it to
Benefit them by selling it
illegally.
Not for that purpose, there is a
problem there. I get that.
But I'd like to bring up in
light of what Senator Cervantes
said.
There are instances, and I will
attest to this.
Right now, because I inquired
about a certain well that there
were.
There was not speculation, but
proof that there was water being
sold illegally.
Uh, upon requests from the state
engineers office.
I asked when the last time that
meter was was red.
And the response I got was not
to my satisfaction.
I inquired why it hasn't hadn't
been.
Read in over a year.
And the answer was it was too
far.
I really had a problem with
that.
Madam Cheer.
Senator Compos, Mr. Cheers, and
Site engineer
There are instances whenever,
well.
I'm gonna back up and I, I do
want to ask this of the state
engineer's office are all wells
metered.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, not
every well in New Mexico's
meter, no.
That's exactly right.
But some of these whas, ma'am,
that are.
Meter
Sometimes there's foul play out
there in the rural areas.
And sometimes
Well, even acts of God can
create a problem with these
majors on the wheels, so I think
that, uh, is there, what kind of
accounting?
does go into effect whenever
there's a problem with.
Madam Chair, senator, uh, if, if
somebody had, you mean a
mechanical problem, some of
these well meter goes down, not
every farmer that does have a
meter on the wheel goes checks
that meter every day. Correct.
OK, so in case of
I know that in this bill there
is an appeal process there, but
that's after the fact that $2000
a day if this bill does pass.
So, uh, Madam Chair, Senator,
the, uh, if, if a farmer finds
that their well is not working,
and they.
Self report that to the, the
office of State Engineer, what
we do right now is we thank
them, we, uh,
You know, ask them to, to.
Estimate their their water usage
during that period, uh, down
period, and then they get the
wall replaced. There's no sort
of enforcement or or punishment
there. And what
I, I want to emphasize is we
don't.
We don't get to collect penalty
$2000 just because somebody made
a ticky tack penalty in
determining the penalty, we must
take into consideration the good
faith efforts of the farmer of
the individual to comply with
the law. So if they're the one
who finds the the well the
meters down and they report that
to the office of the state
engineer, uh, we, we don't and,
you know, on the up and up,
we're not, uh, taking
enforcement action against them
now and we wouldn't if this bill
were passed.
And Madam Chair, I, I understand
what you're trying to say there,
but there are extenuating
circumstances sometimes that are
beyond the control of the
operator.
And we do have to take that into
consideration and it's, it's a
big deal.
That that find that might be
assessed there is.
For some operators, it can be
devastating for them, OK? I, I
just want that pointed out. I'm
also looking down on Melissa who
did this one. This came from the
office of the State Engineer,
Madam Chain, Senator Compos,
under administrative
implications and this is y'all's
language.
Uh, OSC is receiving increasing
numbers.
Of reports of illegal water use,
well drilling, particularly to
sport industries like cannabis.
That is becoming a problem, and
I think it was.
During the special session this
was brought up that there would
be an illegal use of water
there. What is the office of the
state engineer doing to mitigate
that problem.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Senator Azel.
I'm gonna again defer to uh to
legal as well as to the uh state
engineer for the work that
they're trying to do to to stop
some of this because it is
occurring and it's been uh
highly publicized. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Madame Chair, Senator, what
we've been doing in the past
several years since the, since
cannabis uh regulation Act came
out is first trying to educate
parties on the on the legal
obligations that canvas
producers have with regard to
water rights and we've
Cannabis is one area because you
see these greenhouses where
people are pretty quick to make
reports. So we do get the, the,
the reports on those and we are,
we are.
Doing everything we can to
prioritize following up on this
and getting to bottom on them as
soon as possible and taking
whatever enforcement action we
can.
Well, Madam Chair, uh, senator
Compass, Mister Trakers, if that
water is being used illegally.
Are you curtailing the use of
the water, you uh.
Submitting a
A request for that they appear
before the state engineer's
office. What's going on there?
Because if they are illegally
diverting the use of this water
for cannabis purpose. Is there
going to be a new license in
effect for?
Growing cannabis
Uh, Madam Chair, senator, no is
the answer to that question, uh,
if we see folks and it's
happened, illegally diverting
water for cannabis, we order
them to stop immediately and uh.
And take whatever other legal,
legal actions we, we need to
take, uh, but that's, that's
typically what we've done on
those cannabis reports. OK, so
Madam Chair, Senator Compos, Mr.
Jars. This find that you have in
this bill right here, that would
be applicable, isn't that
correct?
Madam chair, yes.
Thank you very much Madam Chair.
I do intend to support this bill
because it is alive and well out
there in our area the sale of
water, illegal sale of water.
I do want it stopped, uh.
If it is not beneficial use or
use for domestic or livestock
use.
And the other entities that
y'all spell out, there's a
problem.
Thank you very much.
Senator, uh, thank you, Senator,
um, Ezel, Senator Townsend.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, thank you, Senator.
They didn't hear that. Thank you
for bringing this bill forward
and I
I, uh, I'm kind of on thin ice
here, um.
I, I, um, I come out of the
and gas fields and oil and gas
business, and I have many
friends that are in the oil and
gas business.
And a lot of them um either sell
or consume a lot of water.
But at the same time, I wanna
appreciate, uh, Senator Campos
for working with me to include
the penalties that I
I was able to include and um.
You know.
There's a lot of people that
have invested a lot of money and
time and effort in developing.
Water, right? Water systems.
Um, and have men and and women,
um.
That try to do it right every
day.
And those are the ones that I am
here to support.
Those ones that are doing it
right. There is, unfortunately,
just like we talked in the solar
business.
Uh
A few minutes ago. There are bad
actors out there that purposely
Go outside of the law to make
money.
And that was what my intent was.
I had a very pointed
conversation with the state
engineer over that, and, and,
and I'm not backing up from it,
right, right and wrong's wrong.
And so I appreciate you adding
these. I want you.
I don't want a.
farmer, I mean, I come from a
farming family and and ranch
family.
I don't want.
The guy that
A or
Person, I shouldn't say guy.
Excuse me, that the person that
actually
Runs over on a hay field. That's
not the intent of this, and I,
and in my conversations with
you, that's not the intent. The
intent is whether they're using
it in oil and gas business or
using it for construction or
whatever they're doing, there's
a right way to do this, and
there's a wrong way to do it,
and it's not that, but the
average frack job today.
It's about 100, 150,000 barrels.
Uh, a yard of concrete takes
about 30 gallons of water at a
4-inch slump.
And if you are pouring.
You know, 500 to 800 cubic yards
of concrete around a windmill.
I
Our
generator base, you're talking
about a lot of water.
And people are going out and
making a ton of money.
illegally.
And that's what I'm after.
I'm probably gonna catch old
Billy, you know what, when I get
home for standing up and support
this, but I have told a number
of people.
If you're not stealing water.
You shouldn't have a problem.
And if you are
And if you are, you ought to
stop because penalties are
coming, but the thing I want to
make sure that I understand.
There is the um practice.
Of not turning in required meter
readings. You're aware of that,
aren't you? Um,
Senator and and.
Uh
Thank you very much, uh, Madam
Chair, and of course, going back
to Senator Townsend, if you will
please help us respond.
Senator, Madam Chair, Senator,
uh, yes, that, that is a
practice among some.
Folks, yes.
and
chair and uh.
Expert, you, your intent is to
enforce that going forward, is
that correct?
Madam Chair, Senator,
absolutely.
OK.
So I don't, I don't want to be
there any ambiguities in this
process.
You have rules on the books.
And, and I want you to enforce
the rules.
I don't want, I mean,
I know of, of
Of instances where there had
been
Um.

office.
and reported a problem, and
there hadn't been a,
Cotton picking thing done about
it.
For months
If ever.
And there are people that have
not turned in meter readings.
And don't ever intend to.
Because right now,
Um
They're, they make money at it.
I would tell you that regardless
of how far a well is away, if
it's far enough away that you
have piped water through a sales
point, you know exactly where it
is.
And there's no excuse for not
going back and reading your
meters. So I want, I want there
to be a capacity and I think
this bill does it to allow the
farmer or rancher that has a
mechanical problem, that's
doesn't require that they're
fined if they have a mechanical
problem. You have that.
At right
require and to help get it
fixed, but you don't have to
impose the penalty for that.
What you're talking about is
after you have made the notice.
That there is a violation.
And that person has had the
chance to solve it, or those
persons that are purposely going
out and diverting water, selling
water from
Um, agricultural wells that they
do not have permit to.
And or the right to, and they're
selling it, and they're selling
it, making.
You know, 100,000, 150,000 today
you can sell water for
Fucking a half a barrel, maybe a
little more.
On a, on a frack job.
The chances of getting caught.
Are relatively slow, low, but
the penalty ought to be enough
to say,
It ain't worth it.
I'm gonna do it right, and
that's why I'm here to support.
I appreciate you.
Um, senator and uh state
engineer and that for taking the
time to meet with me a number of
times. I don't have the.
propensity to try to run under
the
radar, I mean, there's people
out there. I had House Bill 185
that at $1000.
Uh, a barrel penalty. It was a
message bill. I never intended
to, to get it passed.
But
Um, boy, I sure got a lot of
calls.
And I intended to, so.
I appreciate the bill. I
definitely will support it, and
I think everybody ought to
support it because
I, as I told one guy that called
me.
$1000 is a lot. And I said,
what's the last barrel of water
worth?
Thank you, Senator, um.
Do I hear a motion?
I second Madam.
it
OK, uh, senator, oh, he, he, um,
he cannot send.

Senator, uh, Cervantes to
explain about thank you, Madam
Chair, and again this goes to,
uh, Senate Judiciary, so we'll
do some work there too. I'm
still kind of stunned and
reeling from.
The retort from Senator Eel when
she said I'm wrong.
Um, I, I can't remember anybody
ever saying that to me before,
uh, and so I'm I'm still kind of
in shock, but, uh, but thank you
for pointing out that yes,
although you said you were here
to be an opposition and you said
you're gonna vote for it, so
maybe I wasn't wrong, Senator
Rizo. I maybe I'm still
undefeated. I don't know.
All right
Um,
senator, you received a 70 yes
to excused. You received a due
pass. Thank you, everyone, and
we will see you here on
Saturday. Thank you, Madam
Chairman. I believe it was 99 9
a.m.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
