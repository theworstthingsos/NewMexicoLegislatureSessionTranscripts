They're actually in the audience
right now we.
We're back go ahead senator
thank you madame chief then came
out of chair and the two folks
that we were visited by or in
the audience.
Being very impressed with the
program and mine is more of a
comment and it's in a gratitude.
My wife has been for almost
fifty years I don't eat
vegetables but I like to grow
vegetables for her
but that composting comes in
handy I don't often turn it as I
should but very grateful for it
but more so i'm thinking about
all the small farmers in the
state we have the entity youth
farm.
Network throughout the state
there are small farmers all over
the state that will be very.
And the opportunities that they
have and comparison to some
other programs that we have as
well at the state l.
Are small.
So thank you
that is primarily bacon today so
thank you thank you madame chair
that's all I have to think you
sponso.
A.
Yeah.
My question.
Madame.
The group the working group of
stakeholders that would be.
Many folks that were mentioned
for example from the madame
share in the beginning.
Would be developing the plan so
with their best recommendations
we would go with those it's it's
not something that some.
Determined in advance right now.
So this is out of ism article
way of doing this by having a
group of experts come together
convene by n m d a.
To develop the best
recommendations that are the
most viable for the state.
We I just noted for the healthy
soil act for example.
Voluntarian instead of based is
better than regulatory.
People respond better and seem
to get more.
The principle that we are
outlined in the legislation it's
determined by the working group
of specialists and experts.
The.
Madame chair and senator thank
you for the question and.
There are pretty impressive
statistics nationally I mean in
terms of the need for
composting.
Fifty percent of all of our
waste is compostable.
And yet only eight percent of
our waste only eight percent of
the time do we compost currently
so there's a really great
opportunity.
That we could compose more and
in in and in doing so receive
all the benefits that we talked
about.
Thank you very much center city
locus
thank you madame chair I like
the the compose.
I
and and come yeah I think that's
great and income.
With sort I want to give a shout
up to solutions.
Guidance i've been a vermont c.
More than a decade.
I think it's really
really forward th.
Only little concern is something
that's mentioned in the fire and
that is is three months.
The.
Where leg have you already
started.
Adam chair and senator thank you
for the question in their
comments as well.
If this were passed.
Signed by the governor.
And supported we would get
started right away this spring
on developing the the plan from
interviewing all of the.
Piling that data
on behalf of the day we would
help you that in advance so that
we would get a head start if you
will and I think we're capable
doing that but it is an
ambitious.
The benefits are so obvious.
Is there any other comment.
Okay so I would recommend that
you not put your compost near
your cars because the mice.
Yeah.
So I had to learn to move.
Then.
So i'm ready for motion centers
before I make my motion I will
also say a lot of what's online
assumes a mor.
Yeah.
Okay we have a motion from
center city and a second from s.
Saturday.
Senator mccurchan.
Yes.
Yes
senator deal opens yes.
Hope you had a comment.
Thank you very much you haven't
unanimous vote.
Thank you very much for being
here today thank you madam chair
thank you very much member.
Senator steinborn.
The.
Good morning.
Morning madam chair committee
alas what you know there's a
great local organization you
know call reunity resources here
in the santa fe area probably
one of the past
regenerative farms in the state.
On that last subject and wait
bound chair I am putting on
senate bill eighty four you know
for several years as the chair
of the radioactive and hazardous
materials committee.
I become aware of just have
asked contamination that exists
in the state of new mexico.
Abandon your radio minds defense
ways.
We learned that we have hundreds
of abandoned dry cleaning sights
dry cleaners that.
Pluded toxic chemicals.
In communities all over the
state.
And so
now that we have the bunnings of
one time money it's really a
good opportunity for us to start
to clean up our mess and a
course february get the federal
government to clean up their
mess with regards to abandoning
your radio mind sights.
Chromium spills and their type
of ways.
Anyhow todays bill and i'm chair
deals with kind of a a smaller
scale
number of.
The.
I'll use the word abandoned but
they're not all abandoned
industrial sites in the state in
mexico from dry cleaners.
To
plating shops.
And even yes abandoned iranian
mindsights that may be a little
bit of money can't go along way
towards helping to address i'm
joined today by a john rick with
the maximum environment
department they briefed our
committee on this issue probably
our last committee hearing if it
had happened earlier probably
would be a committee bill but
that's yet this is enough of
fine appropriation bell and
attempt to just start to get
this work going john can
describe it more what they would
be doing but i'll just say the
benefit of this would touch
everyone of our communities and
it would put basically
contaminated sites clean them up
protect ground water and then
put them to better economic on
the use so they benefit all
parts of the state.
And without manchera asked if
john wants to say anything.
Thank you madame jaren center
i'll apologize for for my voice
it's decided to.
I want to think the senator for.
Posing this bill as he said we
have identified over three
hundred what we're now
contalling calling neglected
contaminated sites across the
state and we're calling them
that because
orphan sites got his confused
with orphan wales and then
abandoned sights with something
else actually uranium beaters to
that he bending your new mine
sight so we wound up it
neglected is just how we
referred to him but there's been
identified over three hundred
across the state many of them in
your communities that are either
abandoned right cleaners or old
admirished paint shots are
motive mechanic sharps metal
plating shops where based on the
type of work that was done in
the time frames if they're out
of business and a lot of remark
there's a high potential for
contamination of the ground
water and also the soil.
Um we've identified these sides
through records checks and
reviews and discussions in
communities and as we developed
this along with the efforts with
the abandoned uranium minds
where we have over two hundred
and those identified then need
to be able to address some
further is come up and this bill
would allow any med to go in and
with contractor support assessed
these sites and characterize
them which is the first step in
determining whether the
the scope of the contamination
is that we can refirm to us epa
for potential listing as a super
fund sight.
Many times these don't fall into
that category but that doesn't
mean that we don't have citizen.
But we have found as we've
explored these sites that while
they may no longer operate as a
dry cleaners they may be
operating as or next to daycares
apartment complexious.
Citizens risk.
The characterization involves
round water sampling it involves
grilling samples and taken soil
samples
to determine whether we have
vapor intrusion common from this
stuff that people are we need to
a bit.
Five million is is a great
thing.
The overall cost to clean all of
this foreceived that we
recognize it but the first step
is identifying whether the most
at risk are.
And developing a plan for how we
need to move forward with with
remediation in a bateman.
Uhm so with the address.
Thank you.
Thank you very much is there
anyone in the audience to a post
this.
Is there anyone in the audience
to support this bill.
Good morning again turn members
of.
Mexico we are to you will vote
yes i.
Thank you.
Thank you next please thank you
madame chair members of the
commi.
Yeah.
Draft strategic plan
for moving.
Thank you we're now going to
question.
The.
We have a center in a bill and
then centers your loca.
The.
Thank you madame chair and
senator those are because of
their size they're not in that
three hundred list but they that
we are aware of them.
And those are probably likely
candidates for more super.
Circle of laws allow them to go
after whoever that current owner
is as we.
With these right cleaners one of
the unique issues is that while
the draft interim self may not
be very large.
The plume of contamination if
there is one.
And so when you're talking abo.
It's in that set
characterization.
I will tell you that five
million dollars on many decides
doesn't get a started with the
actual cleaner.
But until we qualify.
More accurately do is give us a
good understanding of what the
clean up costs are.
But right now i'll.
What I suspect.
If that would be.
Next I have a center.
The.
So.
No emerge
recommended the recommendation.
The.
Given that it's such a.
That.
Thank you madame chair and
senator what I can tell you is
that.
The process we currently use on
these neglected contaminated
sites because we are as weak and
find funding staff time we're
working on some of these we
prioritize them based on number
one watch the highest risk of
exposure.
Right so as sight it's located
near a school or a daycare or a
senior center or a housing you
know an apartment complex we
have dense housing is going to
be a higher priority than aside
this located exclusively in a
commercial area.
That's part of what and we've
done a lot of that identify you
know what the conditions are we
need to confirm hopefully.
You don't several many of those
three hundred sides once we
charge rise we find that okay
there isn't a problem we can
move on to the next similarly
with the iranian all of them are
important.
But the prioritization has to be
done based on the most critical
human exposure.
And you're certainly right five
million you know it it's five
million one dollars more than
we've had to work with to do
this project so we very much
appreciate it.
But this is sadly a problem that
you know a hundred million
dollars might not be enough.
But if we don't start we.
Well we'll leave our ar.
Thank you for that matter
insurance senator so again you
know there's a lot of impacts
and when we look at a clean up.
Something like that of course we
look at first off starting with
the source and figure out how
that's going to be a bas.
It's hard to to say without
knowing specifically that they
contamination what it would take
for their particular situation
but that's the problem is this
stuff doesn't stay in one place
it moves and it imp.
It can be there without being
dealt.
And.
The.
Thank you very much center souls
then senator gagos and center
mccatchen center so they came
out of chair
is this in the base budgeter is
this why is this not part of the
the administration request for
this particular.
Well.
The.
Yeah I don't know why.
Process.
So that's where we're at.
The.
Admik.
I think I think when I got tough
with it it really re evaluated
poster.
Thanks alright all right thank
you
you know the environment
department has been fighting for
its own just survival and kind
of meeting it's basic needs as
their mission has expanded this
is one of those areas that we
asked him as a committee tell us
about things that are important
but may not really be you don't
have funding to address and but
that your art are in your radar
I really appreciate that they
came forward and said here's
here's an issue you also know
about there is all these smaller
sites that are kind of off the
radar but if you have the
funding you should you should
deal with it so.
You know they're just fighting
for adequate compensation in
this session that's their
mission to keep.
Good employees and try to
recruit him so that we can do
basic environmental protection
in this state this is definitely
an expansive look at things and
I think.
What we want our environment
department to be doing in the
idea.
Thank you and young and i'm
dying no means questioning that
this is a a good bill but I hope
that agencies when they do have
good bills whether it's this one
or others that have things where
they need the additional funding
and particularly when we're in a
time of plenty that it's showing
up in their request to finance
to the legislature to get all of
these.
These very critical things it
feels like we're still pretend
like we're poor and trying to do
everything on the cheap instead
of taking care of things that
we've got money to do now when
we can get those things done.
Next and I don't know if there's
a question in here but more of a
comment that it's always
frustrating to me that the clean
up costs are always born by the
public and the profits have been
walked away from and want to
make sure that we've got sure he
bonds and other kinds of things
on the front end to cover these
so that the public doesn't have
to pick it up after somebody has
walked away from it I appreciate
center developed comment that.
I think it was was your comment
but about the local the land
owner who currently has it has
some level of responsibility up
and that were working on the
prevention side through shirty
bonds and trying to do the
remediation immediately rather
than letting people walk away
and then the public be left with
the problem and so certainly if
you have a comment but when make
sure we're doing that front and
prevention rather than always
just the clean up on the public
side.
Yeah I I totally manage her
center I totally agree we need
tough regulations in the state
that protect citizens on the
front and I mean this is what
happened with the uranium mining
in the history of the state back
in the day in the fifties and
sixties when they were doing
this the nuclear regulatory
commission they didn't have
those kinds of bonds in place
they didn't have those
requirements and that's how
operators could just walk away
and leave the state sitting with
those sites long gone now some
of those regs have changed by it
you're absolutely right and and
and I was talking to time before
we testify there in some of
these sides there is an owner
new owners who who knowingly
bought contaminated sights and
part of this process would be no
doubt having responsible parties
pay their fair share it would
not be just the state s.
Circumstances but I agree with
you.
They mention that.
Thank you center guy.
Closer.
Yeah.
So.
Madame jeremy center it becomes
for the first
several years if it's identif.
The.
The funding comes from us epa.
Any day through our.
Just the work effectively now
after a period of time.
After about ten fifteen years
the cost and shifts to the state
when.
We bear that full responsibility
but by then that the bulk of the
clean up has been d.
The one of the unfortunate.
Quite often getting the sight
listed while that's going
doesn't mean that they're gonna
move on that site in a t.
Yeah.
Fifteen years that they finally
threw enough funding at.
The.
We're currently involved in a
sight and right now in
albuquerque.
In the interim we're working to
put in.
Yeah.
Because they had exposure we're
wor.
The.
Can be utilised.
And no one would.
Madam charlenge then her to
thank you for that so there is
different ways we have to handle
whatever the constituents are
in.
Yeah.
The.
Mechanism is too.
Contain it on sight and we're
talking about.
The.
But the main waste in some.
Buried on side.
The.
With reca.
They're tr.
Yeah.
The.
There other.
Senator mcketchen.
Talked about this.
Yeah.
A couple little questions.
One of them.
Let's say.
Senators first off let me say
that.
Active right cleaners right now.
Are no longer you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not be aware of.
They disclosure laws in real
estate.
This is where he.
Yeah.
Notifying the property owner
that there may be a problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Unfortunately there's some that
can't afford to do it.
Personally.
So getting their interstrike in.
Thank you very much is there
anyone else you'd like to make a
comment.
Is there.
A second.
The.
Yes
yes senator deal office yes the
phonics yes.
Thank you very much you have a
unanimous vote you're off to
i'm.
Thank you
okay members I am putting on the
next bill for us center.
Good morning
man members of the committee
today I have sent a bill one
eleven has several sponsors on
it it's making an appropriation
to the department of environment
for additional resources to
address the sacket decision with
me I have rachel carn from
amigos brothers who's going to
be my expert and missed roderk
is the technical expert he's not
here really pushing this but it
would help his department if it
in fact passes so this bill
specifically is too appropriate
some extra money to the
environment department to get
started on identifying the water
ways that need to be a dressed
in the new rules and regulations
from the second decision and so
this is not something the
department has asked for but
they
could utilise it in terms of
getting started during the
summer in the interim committees
at the water natural resources
here we had got a notice that
the.
Yeah.
Okay so we could proceed without
the soon as long as it's been
audio for the webca.
Okay.
If you know we didn't make this
clear about if people look at
the agenda.
Madam chair at the bottom there
is an email for chat and our
committee secretary in our zoom
operator can access that and I
understand that there was a
comment made on another bill
that came through the chat so we
need to just pick up on that for
in the future so if we have
close caption and it's.
Okay
thank you i'm not sure how much
was picked up before but this
appropriation of eight hundred
and forty thousand dollars would
be recurring over three years
because it isn't it will be an
ongoing process it's not amount
is designed to assist the
environment department in
mapping
the water ways of the state as
they proceed from the
ramifications from the sacket
decision this this summer it was
presented to the water and
natural resources committee that
it might take as as long as five
years to identify these
waterways developed rules and
regulations.
Hold the public hearings
received the comments and then
put the rules and regulations in
place so this little bit of
money is designed to help them
get started in identification of
water waste so with me today as
I mentioned I have a rachel con
as the expert witness and mister
rodrigue as the technical expert
rachel.
Members of the committee.
Protect state waters is a
special appropriations bill.
The.
Decision and.
The new mexico water quality act
allows the state to require
permits for discharge of
pollutions to waters however
currently the state only has a
permitting program for a ground.
Is in the process of trying to
fill that gap by dev.
Most other states in the country
have but that will take time.
For that.
In the meantime our waters are
at risk.
To provide some resources to
try.
Um.
And with that I guess i've just
sum it up that their spending
support.
Inspect.
I made a mistake this money is
not recurring for three years
it's a one year appropriation of
eight hundred forty thousand and
for that week.
Thank you all right how many in
the audience are in favor of
this bill.
The.
Who in the audience is opposed
to.
So there is.
So why don't we have th.
We oppose the appropriations.
Which will directly support
efforts to create a state
service water quality program at
the environment department.
The.
Water quality is extremely
important to new mexico's
agricultural producers as a
lightly hoods directly depend on
access to clean water to grow
crops and raise lifestock.
The concept of clean water is
not what we are opposed to here.
We are however concerned with
the potential for government
over each in the development.
Mexico's current definition of
service waters is much broader
than the federal definition of
waters of the united states.
The implementation of the
federal clean water act has
always been a challenge largely
d.
Such as waters of the united
states and relatively permanent.
And this proposed program will
introduce their ambiguity.
Although a state run program may
bring the administration closer
to our local communities our
state producers should not have
to employ a team of attorneys
and consultants to navigate a
complicated permitting process
from the state or federal
government just to deploy basic
practice.
And many others we ask that you
oppose this.
Madam chair and members of the
committee my name is abio conner
i'm a fifth generation rancher
from stanling new mexico and I
represent the new mexico cattle
groups association we oppose
this spill the background facts
on the sacked decision or an
example of the overreach that
comes with the expansive
definitions of the waters of the
united states or the waters of
the state mindful of sacket in
our own experiences cattle girls
respectfully opposes then it
build eleven new mexico farmers
and ranchers provide our state
nation in the world with healthy
wholesale and nutritious
products we were rely on clean
water for our families our
livestock in the wildlife that
we support sustaining and
enhancing our waters in the land
is a commitment that the
agriculture producers take
seriously we simply have no
choice.
Our family ranching operations
however are already overwhelmed
with regulation permits and
paperwork and the remote bureau
crap don't understand that we
often work multiple jobs from
daylight to dusk not just a nine
to five this bill goes beyond
monitoring and enforcing the
existing regulations which they
department should not should be
doing already.
It is an invitation for the
media to create a forty to fifty
percent bureaucracy and it
estimates will cost six to nine
million dollars a year and
impose families and impose more
government rules and regulations
on our agriculture families
protect water through the
existing regulations yes but
inviting additional regulations
we cannot support the.
Thank you madame chair members
of the committee.
I am federally getting it with
derry producers of new mexico
and we respectly sound an
opposition of senate bill one
eleven the dairy industry has
what's called the dairy role
which was an agreement between
the dairy industry the
environment's apartment and a
environmentalist coalition and
with that rule that came out we
have the most rental ground
water regulations in any other
dairy state in the nation so
senate bill one eleven would
have even more overreached even
more regulations to our
producers that are already
committed to guaranteeing clean
water in the state so again we
cannot abide by any additional
regulations or fees or fines
that are put on our producers
per those cars cannot be passed
on so we respectfully sat in
opposition of setting the one
eleven.
The.
Good morning madame chair
members of committee my name is
mike bowen on the registered
lobbyist for the tacos valley
artisan can service the district
I won't repeat all that's been
said here but for the reason
you've heard the the acd also
stands in our.
Thank you madame.
Committee members of jimberlier
richard lobbies with soci.
We're just as much in.
That's what we do.
We can just see this.
Probably gone into a government
over each where the permitting
would be burdened some
financially and probably more
important to net.
It's burdensome can be time wise
and a lot of our monies are
federal moneys that we have time
constr.
And the permitting we're afraid
would just be.
Two burden some time wa.
Thank you so those were five
oppone.
They can matter.
Outlined by the sp.
This one of the point did I cut
the consider at the end of hips
and.
The environment heartment said
that it would.
That's misleading the agenc.
Surface waters is us
environmental.
The ability of that agency to
enforce water quality in.
Pertail.
The consequences have not
inacting this bill will be much
more drastic.
Decrease in enforcement.
Madam chair members of the
committee ralph he he
reterminated mexico as second
commission also small farmer and
packless new mexico
support this legislation being
that water quality increasingly
important to us we have issues
in the package of the peck was
river in the head waters were
were still expiring active range
into groundwater which does tie
into surface water from the old
tedel minds that were up there
back in the thirties were almost
a hundred years and were still
affected by those some those are
problems from the old mine this
uncertainty from the second
decision leaves our communities
at risk for contamination of
water and dumb i'm just
concerned about what it can come
out of this for the future of
our children and the quality of
water that they will inherit
from us so with that and
everything stated before by the
sponsor and i'll write your con
I urge you to support this piece
of legislat.
The.
Good morning madame chair
members of the committee
management louis pena and a
represent the association of a
sick as for the r real by seat
those real two sauce and
california amounts on the
concert over there in mexico as
I can association and i'm here
to express support for is beyond
eleven
which are direct funny to mexico
environment department to
identify what you make school
waters was threatened by recent
losses of federal protections
and to implement near term
protections with long term
solutions are developed I ask
your support in protecting our
waters and ensuring that the
stop gap mechanism is in place
while we develop internal
processes thank you very much
thank you mister b.
Thank you for the opportunity to
comment my name is tricia snader
and the rivers and waters
program director for new mexico
wild on behalf of our thousands
of supporters across the land of
enchantment we stand and strong
support of senate bill one
eleven this critical
appropriation will ensure that
our environment department has
the resources they need to
protect the water on which all
of our communities human end on
human depends by ensuring that
our current regulations are
being upheld are irreplaceable
waters can be protected for
future generations we know enemy
staff is working hard to set up
a state led surface water
quality permitting program we
look forward to engaging with
many other stay colors about the
details of that program and we
so appreciate the legislature's
previous investments over the
past few years to facilitate
that.
That program will ensure that
the decisions on how to protect
in mexico's waters are made here
in new mexico we also know it
will take time to set that
program up and our waters don't
have time to loose I want to
think senator create hemphill
senator stephanie senator worth
and representative saraniana for
bringing this forward I urge you
to support this critical
investment in new mexico's water
future and I would also like to
call your attention to a fact
she that should be in front of
you that has a number of other
organizations that are in strong
support of this bill i'm who I
know are here in the room and on
zoom but not able to comment in
support thank you thank.
Mister golf.
You may you may have proceed.

degree
and i've always wanted to work
in water mike call career has
been spent in new mexico as a

future
new mexico is watered price.
Excuse me amount of charilsey
what I can do.
I speak as a member of the new

essential and it is essential
that the state step up to
replace the protection for new
mexico's a frimal a female
waters many of our waters will
become interventioned and a
femeral and many of our waters
already are and they have to be
protected from contamination
that protection was stripped
away by the united states
supreme court leaving us the
fenceless almost against
pollution deliberate pollution
and dumping in our waterways our
waters are scarce we must
protect the quality this is an
absolute boot top priority for
the survival of new mexicans
because water is life without
water there is nothing in
ruining water by polluting it.
Ruins it just as surely as
diminishing it by the gross over
use that is going on throughout
new mexico these days we have to
turn that around in that must
start with a twenty twenty four
legislature thank you for all
your work last year you've
internet you unanimously passed
the twenty twenty three waters
security planning act with asked
now that you have accelerate the
progress that you begin in
twenty twenty three and passed
the central water bills that
will be before you in this
legislative session thank you I
appreciate this opportunity to
make a public connect.
Now c.
The.
Thank you madame chair for
presenting this bill I just have
a couple of questions and maybe
a clarification this is a bad
existing.
Madame chair nope this and i'm
gonna let our technical expert
speak to this
relate.
Madam chair and senator so this
particular bill provides funding
for us to.
As it says do some mapping to
determine what the actual impact
of the sacket decision in the.
On our waters.
That's been the proble.
The.
The state surface water
permitting which this.
Other aside from giving us the
mapping capabilities.
That's what applies to the new
surface water permitting pace to
help us identify what needs to
be involved in them.
The other funding is to allow us
to have a weight and keep an eye
on what's going.
Polluters
of our surface.
As it does have an effect on our
forward movement to identify and
develop a s.
The.
Primarily it gives us the
resources to be able to.
Be a watch dog as we move over
with th.
I'm sorry it is.
Yes.
You'd like.
As the stop gap while we develop
the surface water permitting.
You mentioned the majority of
mexico waters have lost federal
protection can you talk a little
bit about.
Then be more specific on how
this bill will address that.
Yes thank you i'm gonna go back
to my.
Yes the.
While the surface.
How if you can explain if this
bill will impact land land
owners are creat.
Madam chair and senator
so the
the direct impact of landowners
should not occur with this bill.
Unless they there's something
going o.
When the sacked decision.
The.
I.
But the potential is there.
We would handle.
On occasion.
The.
What they feel this day the.
Immediate impact on.
We're still trying to understand
what what really occurred with
the sacket.
I can just if I may mention by
share ask follow up what's an
example of.
The.
Madam chair and incentive or so
in a scenario like that we would
be talking about illegal
discharge or illegal dumping
that impacts a surface water or
a wetland and a lot of times the
assumption is we're talking
about liquids but in fact under
our existing regulations dirt
being poured into a a waterway
or into a wetland that changes
those characteristics.
Could be.
Considered a violation it would
be something that that we would
necessarily have to take action
again alright thank you very
much that's all I have made
investor thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you said their medication
i'm going to refer to mrperiod
rodrick on answering that
question.
Senator soleman are existing
water quality regulations.
We are already dealing with the
discharges like that from those
mines typically
matter.
Clean up is being affected.
The issue becomes.
Certainly for everybody involv.
To to have a road.
Consistency is beneficial but we
do have the ability right now
and in fact actively engage in
dealing with contamination that
goes into our waterways into our
ground water.
Madame jerem and senator mccatch
in south.
If we're talking about this
particular legislation again
funds as to do some mathing to
better understand the extensive
the impact of the second
decision.
To help inform our process.
The.
With regard to the surface water
regulations.
The.
So i'll just be black are
currently under our existing
regulations.
We're responsive so in other
words I spill occurs
contamination occurs we step in.
And we enforce but I current
regulations don't allow us.
To preemptively.
Work to stop at a contamination
from happening in the first
place which is what the word is
ruling on what our state
permanent program would do is
yet us on the front end so that
you know as businesses come in
as industries happen we would
have a permanent program to
prevent them from the
contamination in the first place
because it's significantly more
expensive to clean it up once it
happens then it is to prevent it
a regs currently don't allow
that preventative peace.
Yeah.
Things like that I mean not
contami.
The.
Madam chair and senator thank
you for the question so.
When you start talking about
surface water contamination it's
no.
Truck rollovers that we've dealt
with in the last couple of years
where for example down there so
we're city we had a tanker truck
turn over in a four service area
and don't pass fault a
multiplier got into the to the
water course.
We reacted to that and pick an
enforcement action was it were
involved in making sure that
that got cleaned up it did not
it wouldn't us apart it fell
outside their perview although
we ultimately pulled him in.
But those examples happen we've
had happened in northern new
mexico where trucks turned over
we have the other pace that a
lot of times is not thought
about with regard to service
where contamination is the
impact of overgrading things of
that nature where you begin to
allow settlement movement in
your waterways that has an
impact on a quarter cliff it can
have impact on a lot of things.
Um.
Additionally you know you have
development
where
no regulations in place
especially with our.
You know eastmare waterways and
things there's not a lot of
prohibition on somebody filling
in a royal.
And when that happens in our
state because we we don't get a
lot of rain but when we do this
usually all at once you wind up
with significant flooding events
you wind up with property losses
last life we saw that occur with
the fires a couple of years ago
people got in in flash flooding.
So a permitting program looks at
a lot of the aspects we're
trying to understand what the
impact on all of our waterways
was their run with water or not.
Senator miss kan has another
example.
Another example is this.
Communities from.
For example is.
Quality permitting program.
Senator.
What i'm can.
Right.
Private property.
You know.
I see this extend.
On people's private property.
I mean there's there's a whole
lot in my.
The.
So center mechanic did you want
a resp.
I mean is it a common area is
that a question matter chairman.
The.
Madam charing senator thank you.
The first comment would be.
It's going to be a program that
the state is gonna have to grow
in order to take care of these
issues.
One it you've heard that.
Yeah.
A whole lot of public outreach
and public involvement in the
development of this program.
The.
So there's going to be
involvement before this.
To.
The needs of individuals as can
be while protecting.
With regard to development you
know.
Was an intervention on a part of
it tell a developer they
couldn't do something with their
property that had a web.
We recognize that that is there
and we wreck it.
The issue is that right now
there's no requirement to.
Flood point maps and dream a
mapping which is a good thing I
used to be a certified flood
manager here in the state years
ago.
That inforcement all of that
falls to the county level and
i'm most working.
So you know this is going to
take multiple layers the fully
protectors.
We don't know what will exchange
right now.
We don't know.
All the aspects.
The federal program national
pollution discharge limitation
system program.
Is something that we fully take
on we're still trying to spright
size this.
The bill before you allow this
to move forward with that
process to better understand how
we write size this thing yeah
said i've had this conversation
in front of the interim
committees about the fact that
as we move forward with this
program.
There's going to be decision
points for this legislature and
future legislators to decide if
we move forward how do we find
it what does it look like is it
a full feedbased program is a
partially few based is it fully
funded by the state.
We don't have those answers yet
but we need the funding we need
the backing to move forward to
answer those we owe that to the
citizen to the state.
And we appreciate feedback good
better otherwise we need that to
build this program for the
mexico hope that entries your
question.
Do you is.
Thank you the question madame
chair and senator yes we do I
ground what a quality bureau
does the issue discharge
permits.
You know just done through our
gift.
Madam jeremy senator
a lot of the mapping there are
maps that exist in gis not
necessarily with the particular
information we're looking for
we're going to engage third
party contractor support through
this bill to take those maps do
a comparison of what was covered
previously under the.
The.
And see what those.
The.
The impetus and whose.
Part of the problem of course is
to see if it shrinks and
suddenly.
Industry or something developing
area that shrunk and then.
That has an impact on those
businesses again ultimately
we're looking to be able to
provide a shirty to develop
land owners to businesses in
their state.
So they're not caught in this.
Flux.
The.
So manager mr
thank you.
That you madam journey senator
the intent of our regulation
actually isn't going to to try
and regulate raising.
That's the agriculture
department.
What this is going to hopefully
do is help us develop best
practices that can be employed
and we're going to need the
industry to help us with that.
Yeah.
Thank you madame chair insider
yes we collaborate very closely
with the office a state engineer
on this and and a lot of other
water projects.
Would last couple years we've
been in lockstep with regard to
th.
The water date in the spears to
the.
Would you like to know madame
chair if you're ready for motion
i'll make the motion for do
pass.
The.
Senator.
The.
Yes.
The.
Okay on a vote of five to three
one excused.
Thank you I know let the other
s.
Is there anything else.
Thank you committee members the
one bill was rolled over we'll
start with that on.
Okay we're.
The.
The.
Thank you we are in recess.
