And.
The it looks like we
Representative removed away and
right to work yeah and.
Shows.
Madam chair did you get me.
Yes thank you she got here yes
yes.
She did hold on just one sec let
see I got.
One more.
Seven seven.
Hold on just a minute.
Yeah look.
So it looks to me like the vice
chair is with us now so we
should have.
For.
We're trying to reach a
representative Garcia I want to
start with them because I think
this is very
simple and actually although it
involves attorneys.
We didn't need to come to
Judiciary.
We're trying to get just.
Your to do you know if
Representative Garcia has
experts.
Yes your.
Yes.
It's more.
He's already in there.
Okay let's get but Mister
Edwards I see Mr Edwards is with
us and did we have is David
Benavidez one of his experts.
I believe that might I can
adding in New Mexico.
I am here madam chair thank you.
Yes I see here and David
Benavidez is here too okay great
we've got both of you.
Sure we've heard this bill.
Two years.
Do you want to sit in for
Representative Garcia
local
thank you madam chair if you let
me have Mr that readers do most
of the testimony but pretty
basic you follow this.
House bill one ninety nine is a.
Funding was coming in with this
what the funding is for.
Madam chair and members of the
committee thank you
of this bill pertains to the
community governance attorney
act which was passed by the
legislature in two thousand
nineteen so this is a law that
is already on the books of that
law establishes a program
whereby students at the UNM
School law who make a two year
commitment upon graduation to
work full time providing pro
bono services to either land
grants I think it's or Cologne
S. will have their final year of
law school expenses waived and
we'll have half of their salary
covered over the two year
commitment period so that passed
in two thousand nineteen and
this bill is solely to address
one problem with a single figure
in the law and that figure is
that there is a maximum salary
in the lost fifty thousand
dollars and if an organization
exceeds that amount as a
starting salary then the law
graduate can't be placed with
that organization to do this pro
bono work however the law didn't
account for the fact that salary
scales will increase over time
so over time the number of
organizations were graduate can
be placed will dwindle unless
that salary figure in the law is
increased periodically and what
this bill does is instead of.
Requiring that a bill be enacted
every few years to keep pace
with the nonprofit starting
salaries to keep them you know
above the fifty thousand dollars
as the salaries increase this
bill allows the commission that
is established by the law which
is called the community
governance attorney commission.
It allows the commission to
revise the starting salary
figure upwards to keep pace with
prevailing salaries and this way
madam chair the goal of the law
is protected which is to give
graduates opportunities with a
variety of organizations that
have experience providing pro
bono services to these
communities and I'm not sure if
mark Edwards wants to add
anything but that's the gist of
the bill.
Madam chair I'm here.
All.
We we started we started without
you we didn't want to delay you
any further representative
Garcia thank you doctor clue
took over for you.
We were having a little bit of
technical difficulty today are
vice chair is keeps getting
kicked off into the attendee
list.
Vice chair you care.
Be made a panelist with the
phone.
I don't know.
Madam chair she raises her hand
if you'd like to talk if she's
on the phone I can just allow
her to talk Intel she can
access.
Okay what will vice chair we
need to just have you raise your
hand and we'll let you talk but
we can't get you on the panel
and not sure what's going on.
Right.
Show with representative Garcia
you didn't get to hear here to
experts speak.
I'm just wondering
if you want to give us the I'm
not shell version said she
didn't have that opportunity.
Madam chair not even that I feel
that the.
The experts that an incredible
job even though I wasn't
listening.
Forgive me for kind of coming in
late I got tied up on a well
there was an accident downtown
it in a kind of delay me madam
chair this is a monumental piece
of legislation that was created
in in
twenty nineteen it was a rocket
docket piece of legislation in
collaboration between the land
grant interim committee and our
Spanish land grant
communities throughout the state
to address a very dire need in
our land grants us thank us and
Cologne yes which is the need
for pro **** pro pro bono
attorney services and and the
legislation did that.
Thank god that we have recurring
monies that was put into of
House Bill to by the higher end
department to providers with
those two a third year law
students that'll be going
through the process of
eventually ending up on the two
year cycle of providing legal
services to our S. program land
grants said yes and community
and alone is chair and with that
are you know we we stand for
questions if you haven't gone
there yet madam chair.
We have not.
K. to the audience and see if
let's put up a whole New please
say yes to bureau support this
bill and say now if you oppose
the bill and we'll have that
pull up for fifteen seconds.
So that was good we had hundred
percent in favor of their just
just six individuals who waited
I'd like to see if anyone out
there in support of the bill
would like to
Testify please put your hand up
and we'll give you.
I'm to speak.
I don't see any hands up.
All right let's go to the.
Indicated that.
First I have Representative
McQueen.
Thank you madam chair madam
chair the chairman or CEO.
The commission at the makes the
proof the subsequent increases
could to
Refresh my memory about what
that exactly is.
Madam chair and
Representative
Steve McQueen.
The.
The government's Attorney.
A community governance attorney
asked was created in twenty
nineteen rocket docket piece
legislation in that
we established a fund.
To provide that tuition credit
for thirty year law students.
and also to provide half of the
salary for two years in a
nonprofit setting.
to where they would forgive that
that loan.
And we also created in that act
we created the government's
Attorney.
Act commission.
Which basically was established
to establish criteria.
To kind of be like the operating
arm of the act.
And so it's the commission that
basically
contracts with the with the
community governments attorneys.
In terms of what they're
committed to in terms of the
loan forgiveness element
they actually interview
candidates.
so they they they're basically
kind of the operating arm of the
community governance attorney
act.
Madam chair C. thank you for
that
And so the way this works is you
get paid a salary.
I was concerned that it might be
too limiting we have a not to
exceed.
When the suspect first opening
in number like fifty thousand to
the like this is it's always a
mistake right because it becomes
out of date almost immediately
so I like the provision that we
can't just it but it's still yes
Sir does not to exceed language
as not to exceed a level that's
probably pretty low me for
talking about entry level
attorneys paid by legal services
systems that's got to be towards
the bottom of the of the pay
scale is the way it works they
get they get the salary plus the
loan forgiveness so there's a
little benefit on top of the
salary and my reading that right
that's correct.
And and madam chair I'd like to
be able to mark Edwards who's
the draft on this legislation to
reflect on that first question
that you touched on our
Representative McQueen.
Mark can you
The new address
that question that
Representative McQueen.
Raised in terms of our building
to limiting and the language
that you put in the legislation
that tracks to a certain salary
scale.
Madam chair of.
Representative Garcia madam
chair I am market research I
work for the Legislative Council
Service I'm here only to talk
about technical issues and not
support or paper this bill.
Representative Adam chair
representative McQueen is
exactly right this is a drafting
error it did not take into
account the inflation and that
all this bill does is allow the
commission to take inflation
into account.
The.
With regard to and
Representative McQueen the
question about the.
Compensation for the these
attorneys.
Basically an apprenticeship
program for attorneys that are
going to learn municipal law and
and read books I'm like what
earnings are taught law school
which is all case law.
The would be house by.
Legal aid or legally tied into
the.
So the provision for their first
two years they'll get a small
salary but they get that on top
of getting their tuition waived
for their third year net tuition
waiver madam chair covers all
their expenses for the third
year.
So here in state and.
For the students to apply for
this program up front.
And in return for that the state
is saying we will Hey part of
your salary and we contracted
with an organization who will
pay you the other half the this
out.
Thank you mark.

Okay thanks madam chair members
of the committee good to see you

sanctions for willfully and
justifiably interfering with
visitation or time sharing
arrangements because because the
arrangements
and
Miss basis and it also requires

Okay so we can make it nine in
ninety seconds.
Okay.
With thank you madam chair
members of the committee and
when Kate as director Policy for
the New Mexico coalition against
domestic violence we actually
believe this could be a better
bill with some changes to it and
in particular page nine section
L. line thirteen are removing
shall and replacing it with made
to provide the course with some
discretion over imposing
sanctions and the reason we're
asking for this is that
according to the American Bar
Association mothers who are
victims of domestic violence
often depressed and suffering
from post traumatic stress
disorder and as a result
Representative quarterly in
court in the best interest
attorneys and we're custody
evaluators
women are mothers are often
feeling desperate because of
users use correct it in custody
of the children as part of their
abusive behaviors so this is
something that's very concerning
the other is page nine section
M. and we would love to see
something added about training
on domestic violence and sexual
assault and also that any
training should be in accordance
with national standards on child
custody evaluations we know that
eighty eight percent of high
conflict divorces are domestic
violence cases so we think this
is pretty important I thank you
madam chair and members of the
committee.
Thank you very much just hops.
Sorry I was muted thank you
madam chair members of the
committee for having me my name
is Jess Hobbs I am the executive
director of Roberta's place to
domestic violence agency and
requests our New Mexico
I'm also in agreement with going
in on the changes as suggested
we do feel that replacing may
wish shall will be much more
beneficial to both parties
involved and that much like when
said
The American Bar associates
Association has a document that
puts out the ten messed about
custody and domestic violence
and beyond a mother's fitness
and how they make me appear in
court there's also
Nine other equipment that this
would address such as mothers
frequently impending allegations
of abuse to win cases are among
the false of allegations fathers
are far more likely than matters
twenty one percent compared to
one point three to invent false
allegations and child sexual
abuse allegations in custody
cases are very rare about six
percent in total.
And
I miss about fathers not getting
custody abusive parents are
actually more likely to seek
sole custody the non abusive
parents and that's just as
another means of power and
control over their victim.
and also adding to the section
and the specific training around
domestic violence if they're
going to identify that during a
custody hearing.
Thank you.
Thank you okay I I don't see
anywhere has raised are there
any in support of the bill which
testified.
Yes don mills.
I just want to say that I just
support eight HB to sixteen I
don't have a lot to see at this
time but I would like to say
that I in support of it thank
you.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
Thank you minimizing my screen
I'm sorry.
But we go to the committee
members now.
Representative McQueen.
Thank you madam chair.
Madam chair representative can
be L..
We will talk about sanctions
could you explain the the nature
and the extent of such
sanctions.
I'm thank you very much madam
chair representative McQueen so
right now and it's it's actually
a legal and law to interfere
with right full custody
arrangements and what the
standards set forth in this bill
would do would be a by clear and
convincing evidence regardless
of the party if there if that
burden that evidentiary burden I
would to be made Matt in the
eyes of the
Judge David at the imposition of
sanctions would be required I do
want to add Madam chair
representative McQueen that
throughout the discussions that
we've had with various advocates
and stakeholders on this bill I
think that the intent has been
somewhat misconstrued or or us
unfortunately
the interest and in a manner
that which was not intended
for this bill we were simply
trying to give a judge
The ability to impose sanctions
should this very clear and very
high evidentiary burden the Mets
however we also at the same time
I want to acknowledge the
concerns of the domestic
violence community does have
with this language that was not
at that was not our intent at
all the intent was to remind
judges and to and to require
them that if this very clear
very hyper and were to be met
that sanctions should be imposed
so as to dissuade this behavior
I do also want to reveal to the
committee members madam chair
Representative McQueen battle we
are actually that the crux of
this bill is much more that
requirements for training on
custody arrangements I can get
into that later but we have been
talking to the advocate
community about taking out that
language altogether because a
difficult so it'll on it
differences already illegal you
know wondering whether or not
this you know requirement would
be redundant some way other than
just reminding are our judges
that you know sanctions in these
situations should be imposed if
that high evidentiary burden
would be matched.
I'm thank you madam chair
representative hoping the hill
what are the sanctions what kind
of sanctions.
Thank you madam chair
Representative McQueen I don't
think it is specifically
outlined in this bill other than
sanctions shall be imposed I
think that would be better
answered under rule eleven of
the rules of professional
conduct.
Madam chair representative vote
the hill doesn't roll level hi
to attorneys I'm sorry yes well
it's not the correct role thank
you madam chair members never
clean whatever sanctions would
be imposed by a judge under law.
Madam chair representative
because are we talking.
Funds are talking community
service are we talking lost of.
Access to the children were
talking about.
Representative Madam chair
representative McQueen I I think
that would be up to the
discretion of the judge's
written within the proposed
language in this bill.
So madam chair I had of.
Review the some of the materials
that came along with this bill
I'm definitely concerned about
that
I certainly have no problem with
trading you know that sounds
like a good thing
But I'm concerned about that the
sanctions language I'm concerned
about.
It not being.
Well Sir lacking guardrails if
you will.
in that building mandatory.
and it is my opinion that the.
The benefit of additional
training.
isn't sufficient to carry the
rest of bill across the finish
line.
So I am very concerned about the
language and.
I will listen to the rest of the
discussion.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative Eli yeah thank
you madam chair thank you
representative so
we chatted a little bit before
the meeting I'm sorry to be so
this is it's it's is through the
three o'clock hours are getting
to me I am too old for this
Madam chair representative yeah
I I have to tell you I do agree
with Representative McQueen
I am really nervous about how
this is actually going to work I
think I've seen this bill before
we saw similar bill in state
government a year or two ago.
And I remember hearing from a
number of jobs I well with
judges it was practitioners and
I'm sorry I'm late to the
meeting Madam chair
by
I I gotta tell you I think the
way this is going to be imposed
is going to be in court
radically harmful to delay the
mothers I just do I just I am I
I don't do any domestic
relations but I'm looking at
this and I'm thinking this is
going to be a tool that almost
screamed for it's going to be
abused.
And I am really nervous about
this and I I mean I will tell
you right now I I can't support
this bill paragraph L. as in
their No Way I mean I just can't
do that and I don't like the
shall on the training I I have
some concerns because I don't
know this area about whether the
training cause actual standards
but I I really don't like upping
the ante on sanctions
I I'm the child of a divorced it
took fifteen years I'm not not
me but my parents are if this
had been in there it would be
horrible I mean I just feel it
would have been or and I just
don't know what to tell you I
mean I what I I would you know
we we did this in the housing
discrimination bill I would be
willing to sit down with you
between now if the chair would
let me sit down with you tonight
and go through this bill take
out paragraph hello and take a
look at paragraph M. but in its
current form I just have to tell
you I cannot support this bill
so I'm interested in your
comments on that madam chair and
I on Representative I don't mean
to be so blunt about it but the
bill makes me very nervous and
all all all listen I'm sorry to
I I too much coffee today madam
chair representative I apologize
thank thank you madam chair
representative Ely and I
absolutely hear your concerns
and I can tell you right now
today that you know really the
cost of this bill in the
importance of this bill is
upping the ante on the training
requirements we've actually
already worked on drafting an
amendment that would bring those
requirements up to national
standards I have that language I
can I can Senate committee that
will be helpful so a new
paragraph am I can also read it
if we want to do an amendment
and I'm at you know again to
recognize the concerns of the
domestic violence community
that's never anybody that I want
to get crosswise with.
Because I Representative must
provide students I self and I do
I have recognized the importance
of
I'm not passing a lot of that
wouldn't have any unintended
consequences are could be of use
that way I would be willing to
remove paragraph L.
I think that if we were just to
change the language to Xiao I
think that we're reflects the
current state of the law as it
is and would be and that are
redundant and unnecessary but if
we could eliminate paragraph al
and bea's brought the language
in and to me that to meet
national standards I would you
know what that rectify some of
your concerns are yeah I just
have Madam chair representative
I just appreciate that very much
yes I think it what I'm very if
we had unlimited paragraph L.
and look at and that you're
right on track I mean that is
that is what I'd be thinking I I
I would love that I I don't like
having these no arms races and
that's what I see this as being
and I'm just nervous about it so
yeah that would be very helpful
and I'd be willing to work at
but hours late I get that so I'm
I'm willing to defer to the
chair and she would she like to
do in terms of how to get this
accomplished by
I will we listen and I
appreciate very much your
cooperation on this Madam chair
representative thank you.
To hear from other committee
members before we set this aside
for mandate Representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative and I will be
repetitive I think I share the
same concerns and the direction
of removing the sanctions and
and making clear that the
training it meets national
standards as the is the right
way to go
so I share the same concerns and
appreciate your willingness to
to make those changes thank you.
Representative Rehm.
Thank you madam chair is having
internet problems that part and
then to come into the building
anyway so I've missed a lot of
the discussion but I just on the
training I hate to see us
mandate and put into statute
every year this reoccurring
training we did that with law
enforcement and we've kind of
crippled their movement I'm not
close to the training but I
don't know that you need to make
at.
Mandatory every year thank you
madam chair.
Thank you.
I don't see other hands from
committee members.
Madam chair yes going.
Thank you I like many members
today I'm having technical
difficulties I'm on my phone
hopefully getting my laptop in
the second I just wanted to
appreciate the Sanchez
intentions and also the concerns
raised I also just really rely
on that trust that I've learn to
garner with our incredible
analyst and appreciate their
insight when we're working some
of these new ones built all the
way through I am worried because
of how late we are in the
session that we may not have
time to make sure that amendment
gets it right I like the
direction it's headed but just
because of my life experience
and expertise know that this is
really really important work in
front of us and I don't want to
to go in a hurry thinking that
we're heading in the right
direction and not making sure
that we I just wanna make sure
that we have room to fully
fleshed this out with advocates
and allies that I trust if we
are in this gray area so I like
the direction the amendments
headed I don't feel ready to
jump into that today madam chair
but I I do support the intention
of the bill but I want to make
sure that we're full if we have
an amendment to look at that
we're certainly pulling fully
vetting it by the people who
understand the implications of
this over a couple of days at
least thank you madam chair.
Thank you very much
so.
I'm going to weigh in to before
you do any work on this bill
I have to admit whenever I get
something like this if I may
have.
I did not experience what
Representative Ely jet but I
have hi my own domestic
relations case my kids were
quite old when that happened but
I sort of get PTSD when we start
talking about.
To miss relations cases
Is I'm still having been
dismissed yet but it should be
the court appointed me is
guarding that light and then
just or K..
Of our county that ended up
influence it County down down.
I witnessed for the first time
first the imbalance of power
when one of the the father had
an attorney.
Whose children were all going
through college on the basis of
the fees being paid to Senator.
And
Yeah and that
I think this particular turn it
was quite well known for I'm
very high profile and high
profile cases but very which is
cases very.
It's like we're never settling
anything and
What I worry about is
For one thing you can not force.
Someone who's been a victim of
domestic violence.
That's tier play woman but not
necessarily to mediation it
doesn't work that's that's based
on a lot of good research.
If you're going to do the
aeration that has to be done
totally differently I for Kate
and it has to be like the kind
of mediation where you're not in
the same rule and
I just think that
the analysis that I have.
Indicates that Irma.
We really need to look at the
latest in reserves if we're
going to do something just I
also I think that
You know the whole the whole
issue of mandated training.
I I believe I I believe I
understand the family law
section of the bar has been.
Working on that yes.
On training rules for up here
four majors in individuals but
they haven't reached a
recommendation yet do you know
if that's the case
Representative Hochman Vigil
thank you very much madam chair
so I have a couple different
conversations at various stages
in the family court
Division of you know that second
judicial District Court and and
and they are trying to implement
some standards off everyone has
acknowledge the fact that New
Mexico is very much behind the
times with regards to you know
this type of training
requirements and as a result we
have because the plans that are
not fabricated for the best
interests of the children and
and I think we kind of got
crosswise with this bill madam
chair was you know all the
research that's been done into
you know the pediatric
Development and trauma and the
effects of trauma if a child is
you know if the cost of the plan
is wrongfully interrupted or if
it a child is deprived from
contact with one parent or
another we know that that that
has dramatic physiological
affects on the development of
small children and so it's
really important that the people
that are crafting these types of
custody arrangements have that
type of knowledge and are
required to keep up on you know
new information science based
information that will help them
better inform them as to rate
plans that are in the best
interest of the children right
now for majority of the state
that is not happening and as a
result we have custody plans are
being crafted that don't make a
lot of sense or the need to be
changed for whatever reason or
you know they're just kind of
arbitrarily thrown together
nobody really has no reason why
and we need to we need to stave
off that behavior because it's
it's not constructive for the
child and so I think anything
that we can based on science and
facts even if it's a custodial
you know of a parenting plan is
a.
Good thing for the state of New
Mexico and not madam chair is
really the crux of this bill and
what we would really like to
concentrate on moving forward.
And.
Thank you very much
Representative I guess I'm
confused about cool would be
trades and who would be extent.
What what I can read you the
that potential the language are
considering for the amendment if
that would be helpful.
So new subparagraph let's see
here I have madam chair my
apology is second.
New subparagraph and would be
changed to read beginning
January one twenty twenty two
all individuals making time
sharing recommendations
including guardians of light I'm
hearing officer special masters
in court clinicians shall be
required to attend annual
training on the development of
custody and parenting plans the
training so we develop a New
Mexico Supreme Court to check
and challan clued one domestic
violence dynamics in child
custody matters to peer review
to purely based that is on the
effects of time sharing
arrangements out on children and
three child interview techniques
the training requirement
identified herein shall not
pertain to judges.
White where the judges accepted.
That's a good question madam
chair that's a that's a good
question I think that judges are
required family court judges do
you already do that training are
some of that training and so I
think the concern would be you
know are we are interfering with
the purview of silly
requirements imposed by the
state bar of New Mexico.
It.
And I know we try not to of.
Step on that branch of
government but but I in my
practice this and it lacked I'm
dealing with a I'm a judge who
is the family court judge when
he's not during the this in the
lacked basis and another one who
I judge who does the same in
Sandoval county she's the
domestic relations judge and
then she does the filed.
Should should the juvenile cases
are.
And sometimes I hear things that
seem rather old fashioned coming
out of the mouth of the judge.
Because we are dealing with
custody in a very different way
where the it's not about the
divorce it's about the child's
gonna be reunified with and when
you know what kinds of bonds
exist between the children and
maybe hoster parent or
at at and I I really think they
should just could use some.
I know Representative Rehm and I
share that concern about just
putting something in it just
becomes a standard training
annually and they all just sit
and watch the same thing over
and over again it says you we
don't want to comment that want
to do that because I know he's
talked about the law enforcement
academy are building and not.
Situation but I
I would like judges and the
people who are hired to do the
custody evaluations the the
experts to have some idea of the
the latest research and are up
to date in the literature and
and what the outcomes are for
children.
Because
I know in the case where I I
described where the judge
It what would that was needed
judge but the balance case where
I Representative.
Chapter I've dealt.
I asked for and got much to the
junction of this council for my
child my client my little client
who was only six to speak to the
judge.
He walked both of his parents he
was scared of his dad's targets.
And we're not.
About his safety but about the
way his dad reacted and
He did the judge granted him the
in camera and I don't know what
was that but I do know court the
judge got the dad's attention in
statute.
You have to realize that
sometimes you're scaring
yourself.
And but the attorney on the
other side wanted to sanction me
for even asking for an in camera
Appointment from my my son
a son.
Is.
Law Center and our it was just
it was just so combative and
anyway I I want to be sure that
they're all properly trained but
as used state would probably
can't deal with the judges but
what about the custody
evaluators.
Yes thank you madam chair and I
I definitely wet as I read the
potential amendment amended
language that would be included
as well pretty I mean the intent
is pretty much anybody that
touches these types of of
custody plans and pension plans
should have this training.
And madam chair this is a of
course Senator Ivey Soto are
you.
Officer and and certainly I'd
really appreciate of the the
discourse that you're just
having on on the for the judges
well I think Representative
Hochman Vigil have the right now
in terms of of what what we can
required of the judges certainly
we could we raised that last
line to say that the that the
trading would also be made
available to judges.
And I'm like a good idea.
That doesn't seem like it's
written into our.
Infringing on another branch of
government This Is.
Yeah okay.
Okay so other comments for the
Sanchez before we
Send them away
Representative Eli was wanting
to go with them maybe not this
moment that he was going to try
to help.
Any other comments from
committee members.
I just I really appreciate your
willingness to consider.
Yes suggestions from.
Our committee.
And
See if we can get you back.
We're going.
Tomorrow morning nine thirty to
twelve thirty.
Before we go on to the floor so
maybe we could figure that out
okay but
I
thank you Senator Ivey Soto I
need to talk to her.
I I made a really big mistake
okay might vice chair is going
to.
begin with our next item.
Which is.
Senator o'neill.
This is our first Senate bill.
All really the first one it's
just one.
Etcetera etcetera now we want to
let you know that we hope the
Senate Judiciary Committee will
follow suit are you know maybe
you're the vice chair right at
all always be Alice member deep
down in a former of law of this
bind Committee as well so for
sure that we're gonna have to
Representative Russ is sure
we're doing all these bills
today tomorrow even Sunday maybe
so no for sure I duly noted okay
but as you know I'm just vice
chair yeah we we know the chair
is but I do have a voice.
This we have already part is one
house bill Senate Judiciary
there you go.
Bill I think it was this kind of
neglected Bill two fifty five
you know that we put that right
up front we did thank you Mr.
Bill.
Pardon.
House judiciary did.
I
your in your.
Okay what.
But just one last thing to say
as senator o'neill is one of
those who earned the title of
representative
What are late speaker Ben Lujan
called the Representative.
It was the Senate madam chair.
Too hard for him to be here and
house.
You see side are.
Well then some some members come
back in a really sad about that
but anyway we want to dwell on
that but we had quite an
emotional floor yesterday about
on his behalf but anyway.
And I'm gonna turn this over to
the vice chair right now for
just a minute so I can call
Senator Ivey Soto okay okay
sounds good okay.
Are you ready SB.
Yes I am I Senate bill one
fourteen madam vice chair and
members would update the
procedures you.
The reunion with you today there
are there are a reside Douglas
carver should be on.
And for years and if he's not
I'll just do it so.
So Douglas cover with the
sentencing commission should be.
One.
See on he's joined us thank you
we won't let him talk too much
K. so unless necessary now we
love Douglas
okay so Senate bill one fourteen
would update to procedures for
requesting in evaluating request
for early parole based on
inmates advanced age or medical
information madam vice chair
this bill basically came out of
the the sentencing commissions
reform committee which was
statically inclusive of all the
stakeholders and criminal
justice reform we had dust
before we had victims groups we
had the parole board and the
corrections department and with
with their task was to find
things as you know madam vice
chair from your work in this
area you want you want to try to
find initiatives or bills that
the people can agree on so this
bill came out of that process
and and basically it's basically
amending you know just putting
in statute with what is being
done already in a big way with
with geriatric parole so at this
point Douglas can weigh in and
then we'll go to questions.
Thank you.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator members of the committee
my name's Douglas carver deputy
director of the New Mexico
sensing Commission it's good to
see and hear you all again
Senator only stated this bill
came out of our sensing
Commission reform committee the
draft in fact was developed by
working group that included both
of the secretary of corrections
and the chair of the probation
parole board
and then it was approved in
tweets language was changed by
the reform committee and then it
went on and was approved by the
full commission
just a couple quick things I
know you all are familiar with
the background of the commission
as Senator o'neill stated it is
a broad cross section of every
player in the criminal justice
system across the state and I'll
just remind members it also has
appointees from the governor and
members from both parties in
both chambers so there's a very
strong legislative
representation on the committee
on the commission as well
I just I want to think about the
bill draft it looks like a lot
of new language but that's
because the two state are
presently and ought to sections
and being a geriatric medical
parole interest I'm I don't know
but they're not even consecutive
numbers there about three
numbers part we combined a lot
of the language from the section
as being repealed that's at the
end of this bill into the new
section so it all be in one
place and then made some some
policy changes we can go into
details of members want the one
other thing I'll note madam
chair members of the committee
is that the corrections
department is fully in support
of this bill the secretary of
corrections is waiting on
another fail and I think on the
Senate floor actually to be an
expert there but she was able to
make the hearing I chatted with
her today and she said please
convey our apologies to the
committee and also.
Insure that the committee knows
that they are in full support of
this bill she's testified in
favor of this bill in its
previous hearings so thank you
madam chair members the
committee thank you so much
you're going to go to public
comment now and again welcome to
the house we're going to first
start by putting up a poll.
This with this noon today they
will have room to weigh in
whether they are in favor or in
opposition of SB one fourteen so
we can get that pull up Georgia.
I
will leave this for about thirty
seconds after that we'll go to
public comments if there's
anyone here that wants to speak
in opposition I will go to
opposition first you'll see a
timer on the screen we will call
your name one by one you'll need
to under yourself and then offer
us your one minute of public
comment.
I'm not seeing the poll moving
on my end
Well here we are we have our
sense the public comments to
show here we go all right well
is back to working we have about
seventy people joining us today
weighing in five of those are in
support of this bill to an
opposition so we'll go to the
opposition first if you'd like
to make a public comment out
loud you can raise your hands
now.
We don't see any opposition
wanting to make public comment
if there's anyone here in
support of SB one fourteen
please raise your hand and we'll
call and you.
We're going to start today with
you see that Campos.
Good afternoon chairman members
of the committee my name is
Joseph Campbell's I'm a policy
associate apple teachers New
Mexico formerly known as young
woman United we stand in support
of SB one fourteen
criminalization and mass
incarceration particularly in
communities of color has meant
that many of our loved ones are
serving incredibly long
sentences this common sense
legislation will mean that those
dying.
I get to spend the last years or
even months with loved ones and
they don't have to die alone we
ask that you please support SB
one fourteen thank you.
Thank you next we have Jonathan
Ibarra.
Thank you very much vice
chairman and members of the
committee my name is Jonathan
about
An attorney with the law office
of the public defender I'm also
on the board of the New Mexico
criminal defense lawyers
association and I wanted to
chime in to say that both of
those organizations support this
bill we believe that it's
consistent with public safety
to allow people who are not in a
position where they're going to
be violating to be able to be
released it's very consistent
with public policy including the
policy is set frankly to save
money you know for people who
are incarcerated there you know
it's the department of
corrections is going to be
paying the medical bills and I
think that the the F. I. R. talk
about the.
Hi amount of money that's going
to be saved by this bill I
there's a reason it passed with
almost no dissension in the
Senate I think it's a great bill
and we urge you to pass it thank
you.
Thank you that's all the public
comment we have for today
Senator o'neill is there
anything you'd like to add
before we go back to the
committee no are by all means go
to the committee thank you madam
vice chair.
I don't see any hands raised so
far what's the Representative
Armstrong thank you thank you
madam chair and thank you
Senator I just want to say thank
you and thank you to Douglas
we've had this conversation many
times in here and I really
appreciate your work on this and
and getting **** done and I'm
I'm in full support and and
thank you very much for for
addressing this.
Thanks thank you Representative.
Where would you pass.
Thank you we have.
Representative Eli and a second
from representative Armstrong
IDC Representative Nibert has
his handout so we'll go to that
discussion and thank you for the
motion Representative Nibert.
Thank you madam chair just one
quick question all right I
thought that the current
procedures required.
Some sort of medical valuation
and and I may be overlooking it
Senator but I I did not see the
same medical evaluation are
requirements of this bill as I
thought were the existence
statute could you comment on
that yes Douglas could you speak
to that.
Yes thank you
the vice chair representative
Nibert.
If you look on page second step
section J. the second section on
page six going over to page
seven.
And it says
so it's online wanted to on page
seven that when considering
inmate for medical with
geriatric parole the director
may request that reasonable
medical mental health
examinations be conducted
provided that they don't because
of the way in processing time
for applications so that's that
requirement is state you know it
depends you know a lot of these
inmates obviously will be people
or in long term care already in
correction some of those there
was one is facility so they
might know their condition
already but it does provide for
the examinations to be conducted
this is on there in a timely
fashion that was one concern of
everybody actually in discussing
this bill was that.
they didn't want an examination
to mean that the process will be
spun out of for many many months
but the requirement is still
there if it's necessary on the
part of the.
Part of the board.
Representative madam chair.
Mr carver it is is that the same
language or yeah it just seems
like it may have been a little
stronger.
In the existing statute this.
Our.
Maybe that's it has to.
Thank you hello less stringent
are given more discretion but
it it it just
The same to me to be worth the
same as what we have.
Thank that's finally Madam chair

Representative Dixon I believe

Yes Representative Dixon are you

Yes madam chair and I do have a
three experts if we could move

Okay just give us a minute to

Serra crack up Betty Fleischman

Madam chair I don't see Gary

If I heard that correct the
others are and very if you're
with us as an attendee might you
please raise your hand so we can
find you to be a panelist.
Up.
Thank you thank you Georgia
Representative please begin.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee we do have the
house Judiciary Committee
substitute.
So do you want me to move that
now or
Explain that.
Substitute yes Representative
that's going to potentially
impact public comment please go
ahead and explain the committee
sub for audiences ning and
today.
Okay wonderful so we're going to
be introducing House Judiciary
Committee substitute for House
Health Human Services substitute
for house bill two oh two and
I'd like to begin by just
talking about that the reason
for this bill which is that New
Mexico has the highest rate of
childhood trauma exposure in the
country.
With eighteen percent of all
children in the state having
experienced three or more
significant traumatic
experiences.
Every child entering foster care
in New Mexico is highly likely
to have experienced multiple
forms of trauma.
And once in our child welfare
system foster child experiences
an average of six placement
changes per year each move a
likely source of additional
trauma.
We know that exposure to complex
trauma of.
Deeply affects the development
of a child and went unaddressed
often results in problems with
sleep cognition behavior and
emotional self regulation.
Every child in New Mexico foster
care deserves a chance to be
safe and have the resources
necessary to heal and thrive.
The proposed legislation will
utilize New Mexico's existing
resources to make systemic
changes that will immediately
improve the way the state serves
children in custody helping to
ensure the system itself is not
committing more harm and so I'd
like to have to my experts speak
to the.
Substance of the committee
substitute starting with us
Serra crack up followed by Betty
Fleischman thank you.
Experts.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Dixon and members
of the committee.
Thank you for the opportunity to
speak with you today regarding
each B. two zero tail Mr kaka
I've been guarding the vitamin
youth internet in Bernalillo
county on behalf of foster
children since two thousand it
was co counsel in the Kevin
asked verses Blaylock at all
lawsuits and a member of the
cavernous plaintiffs went
implementation team I am pleased
to testify today in favor of the
substitute H. P. two zero two
now this bill while removing
certain provisions from a prior
draft continues to codify key
elements of the cavernous
settlement in efforts to
strengthen CYFD is and HSD is
accountability to children in
foster care.
Verses Blaylock with CYFD and
HSD as defendants was of federal
class action lawsuit on behalf
of all children in foster care.
This was dismissed in favor of a
monitored settle on a treatment
one year ago this is a
contractual agreement with goals
related to transforming our
sponsors system trauma
responsive Mr chair.
In person at age three two zero
two before you codifies key
elements of the Knesset meant by
ensuring that the behavioral
health collaborative plans for
the provision of behavioral
health services and screenings
for children here in Burke by
requiring CYFD stop relying on
offices no tells an out of state
residential treatment centers
all that placement for our most
vulnerable you.
These modifications to the New
Mexico statutes are consistent
with federal law and will have
minimal fiscal impact elevating
these commitments into the
children's code one power
applicant's initials for judges
the whole CYFD and HSD interval
individual cases with the force
of law you contrast agencies
contractual obligations under
the settlement agreement require
internal policy change and as an
advocate in the system for the
last twenty years I can tell you
that internal policy change that
trickles down to every single
child in foster care
historically takes many months
and realistically years to
accomplish.
It should go without saying that
no child should sleep on the
floor of an office.
No foster child should suffer
without the mental health
services they desperately need.
As recently as December of
twenty twenty my team client
spent weeks sleeping on the
floor the CYFD receiving center
with no access to a therapist
for school.
I visited that I visited him
there and I saw for myself the
building that that wasn't even
the length of his body that he
had to sleep on on the floor it
was demoralizing and I had never
seen him so depressed if this
bill passes using my client
situation we have a right to a
real that in a more appropriate
placement unless CYFD met the
obligation in this bill for the
secretary of CYFD for the
director of project of the
protective services division to
specifically approve it.
And to satisfy notice
requirements and representative
that they met the standard.
We did we did remove provisions
from a previous draft and I want
to just briefly go over that.
Those included the notice in
planning requirements for a
child's fourth placement move in
one thousand calendar days we
remove this language in part
because you introduce current
data system does not accurately
capture every placement change
for child a child in care we
understand that this school in
the settlement that goal in the
settlement was not due until
twenty twenty two an agency
needs more time to get a valid
data system in order to meet its
obligation under the settlement
agreement we also removed a
section that would require the
collaborative to deliver
appropriate trauma.
The term with the term trauma
responsive services to children
in care and a section that would
have expanded the current
definition of least restrictive
means principal.
These two sections would have
gone into the mental health
code.
We would like more time to
develop language around that and
ensure that the systems
themselves are appropriately set
up to meet those obligations.
Thank you for your time and I
remain available to answer any
questions.
I'm good afternoon madam vice
chair representative Dixon
members the community committee
thank you so much for giving us
the opportunity to speak with
you this afternoon my name is
Betty Fleiss man I'm an attorney
I am the executive director of
Pegasus legal services for
children and part of my job I
represent as a guarding that
light and and yet the tourney
for children and foster care
system and I'm the guarding that
live in New paternity in the
newly formed.
Court specifically providing
services for Indian children.
As defined by it.
Additionally I was the next
friend for Kevin asks in this
lawsuit and
I want the second you Chris.
The reason this is so important
to codify and the reason is
actually came about is actually
before my day thirty years ago
there was a class action lawsuit
called Joseph J. and all of
these issues response to be
resolved through the that
amazing class action lawsuit
great attorneys great commitment
everyone worked on it
and once the oversight went away
everything went back to business
as usual and here we are
literally thirty years later
addressing these very basic
concerns if this legislature
takes the opportunity to kind of
I really only a few things and
makes a really strong statements
that children really important
these issues are really here to
stay in the state really cares
about them it's very much I I in
my opinion in line.
Great efforts are going into the
state it will law which is
putting in a lot to protect
these important protections that
are already there which is kind
of I so no matter what happens
the with the federal government
be it a new administration we
are not going to have these
young people
unit down to disabilities out of
state or sleeping on the floor
and in and offices and this bill
does not.
Include the department in using
these if an office is necessary
or out of state it only puts in
another level of supervision for
those of us that work in this
field we know how often
frontline
case workers turned over and how
many vacancies there are this
just says if a kid for some
reason does need to sleep on a
couch for the night but they do
need to go to went out of state
facility somebody with more
training and experience and
expertise will review it so it's
done with intent it's done
safely and it's truly the best
interests of the children so
nothing's being taken away
something just be added just
some really much needed
oversight and additionally this
doesn't preclude sending
children out of state to be with
the relative this only precludes
puts in this extreme level if
it's an out of state facility
residential treatment facility
and why is that important when
we give me two very quick
examples Kevin just to still
actually four and a half years
later in
foster care he's going to be
seventeen in two weeks it's been
out of state for four and a half
years one of the facility within
got closed down in Colorado and
if you read the report G. then
but it was online the reasons
why they actually found a young
child who is a client there in
the closet beating her own skin.
And that's because they have
different licensing standards it
was not a state known to check
on it that's not okay my other
client within the facility in
Arizona and I wanted to visit
him and he was in a trailer with
every single window boarded up I
mean you would put a dog in a
dog kennel like that and it's
the state different licensing
standards
I'm totally not acceptable so
those are the things we're
trying.
to make sure of also an out of
state facilities then we have to
this much discussion is not okay
to sleep on the floor but with
out of state.
So these it's really hard.
To reunify the point of bringing
a kid into industry wide because
state is this is a child who has
been abused or neglected they're
really vulnerable if there is an
out of state facility it only
means that we don't have that
service here and we should spend
those resources to developing
the services and rebuilding our
own system but think about a
parent who is suffering from
property probably homeless
they're supposed to figure out
how to get three or four states
over so they can have meaningful
visits with their child so they
can unify you really really
difficult is just is against
everything
The process is supposed to be
supporting and as an attorney
it's needs difficult to go visit
your child your client in and
out of state facilities so.
Again this is just got to find
something everyone's already
agreed to Department everyone is
said this is important don't
want this we don't want our kids
out of state we want to preserve
the good work that's going on
now when a new administration
comes into more may not be as
committed and we don't want to
look back thirty years later is
that while we have this golden
opportunity but we didn't
codified so I'm.
Thank you for listening I'm also
available to answer any
questions and comments we really
appreciate your interest in our
most vulnerable kids thank you
Representative anything else
before we go to public comment I
thank you madam chair up we can
move to public comment thank you
I'm so we're going to start by
putting up our house Judiciary
pull.
For those joining us B. as soon
you can weigh in if you're
interested and indicate whether
you are in support or in
opposition to H. B. two oh two.
We'll leave this for about
thirty seconds.
After we finish the pull we will
go to the audience and if you
would like to make a comment
you'll be given an opportunity
to do so.
So we have about fifteen people
waiting in we have about three
quarters of those folks in
support of this bill and a
quarter in opposition we're
going to start today with the
opposition.
We're going to call your name
one by one and we will ask that
you and you yourself you will
see a clock on the screen and
have an opportunity to give your
comments within our minute
timeline first we are going to
be like rest just.
Good afternoon madam vice chair
and members of the committee my
name is Eli Festus I'm an
attorney for the office of the
general counsel of children
youth and families department
CYFD I work closely with you
just in other staff coordinate
compliance with the cabinet
Madam at this time CYFD very
respectfully opposes H. B. to a
two.
Thank you very very quickly note
the following issues.
First the bill seeks to codify
the statute settlement agreement
arising out of the cavernous
lawsuit but the execution of the
settlement agreement is still
under way it's a dynamic process
many of the terms and
definitions of the settlement
are still in the process of
being defined and agreed upon
between the state and the
controls second legislation
interferes with the dynamic
process and undermines the
reform efforts the HSD and see
what you're pursuing the
settlement agreement for example
some of the definitions terms
and requirements of the bill.
Thank you bye next we have
called rates then.
Hi all right I'm the chief
general counsel for the Human
Services Department and one of
the principal negotiators for
the cabin that settlement
I want to dispel the myth that
Secretary Blalock and secretary
Scrase are not concerned about
kids they're absolutely
concerned about the welfare of
kids and Secretary Blalock and
CYFD have moved rapidly to
decrease the number of kids that
are out of state in custody with
respect to this it's just the
it's a policy situation here
this bill interferes with an
active settlement agreement
settlement agreement the state
is paying it has paid an
enormous amount of money to the
plaintiff's attorneys and are
paying a lot of money to a bunch
of experts call co neutrals to
develop plans and approves them
and that's what needs to be
codified.
Couple of years from now thank
you.
Thank you I do just want to
clarify we also have on the list
are secretary of health and
Human Services we are going to
give our secretary additional
time and we're going to allow Mr
press guess on behalf of the
CYFD depart on behalf of CYFD to
finish their comments as well so
let's first go to Ely and thank
you for weighing in on behalf of
your agency if you'd like to
finish your comments you'll have
another chance to do so increase
be concise.
Great thank you madam vice chair
and members of the committee I I
I just want to say this is very
important that CYFD HSD would
welcome the opportunity to
collaborate on a more complete
specific and robust bill next
legislative session we look
forward to working with the
sponsors and hopefully in
consultation with the controls
on this important topic after
the terms of the settlement
agreements have been finalized
next session so again thank you
so much I appreciate it and we
look forward to future
collaborations thank you.
Thank you next we have secretary
Scrase.
Thank you very much madam chair
members of the committee this
David Scrase secretary of Human
Services Human Services serves
over a million New Mexicans in
our Medicaid program we actually
cover fifty eight percent of
children in New Mexico and in
fact seventy eight percent of
all babies born in the state are
born in the Medicaid we have a
deep and the on going commitment
to the welfare and health of
every child in New Mexico and
vertically those who are our
customers we're very committed
to ensuring that the o's
things are caught they were put
together in the settlement
agreement do get implemented and
just re edit it right excellent
comments from misters frescoes
in rates not there's a sequence
to this process we need to work
through the details and put
together proactively a plan
which is to in order to
implement changes according to
the settlement agreement that
takes time and I just feel very
strongly that the bill as it's
written is premature it codifies
items that we have not yet
agreed on we are working with
call me trolls national experts
on child welfare who have a
wealth of knowledge and we're
interacting with them on a very
regular basis to do the best for
New Mexico kids and so in
closing I just want to say that
we at add up the agency and I
like Mr risk has also speaking
for Secretary Blalock and CYFD
are more than willing to kind of
fight every single thing that we
get an agreement on over the
next year in the cabin as
settlement process and in fact
we have an interest in doing
that because we want to make
sure that those changes and
some.
And and and many of the things
that that plaintiffs attorneys
have talked about today our
codified so they last from one
administration to the next so in
closing this is just simply a
matter of timing we do not want
to get ahead of are creating new
trolls we do not want to get
ahead of the process and we
commit to working with point Ms
after all everything that has
the needs to be decided is
decided in the settlement
agreement process to codify this
in statute in the future session
thank you very much madam chair
and members of the committee.
Thank you now we are going to
those that would like to weigh
in in support of H. B. two oh
two.
We're going to start with
Maryland black.
Thank.
We think you think about that we
are.
Madam chairman can you hear me.
Yes thank you go ahead R. eight
community hello committee
members and madam chairman my
name this Maryland back and I'm
a former foster parents I'm in
my time as a foster parent in
three CYFD I had over thirty
nine children in my care ranging
from newborn to teenage I
actually had more than twelve
teenagers in my care and even
just listening to the testimony
before me I'm trying to think of
one single teenager in the last
two years that came into my care
that had not slept in the
receiving center right least two
nine I I am I don't actually
know what one of the teens and I
have more than twelve.
I'd like to first of all thank
the chair and that Kevin asked
Madam attorneys for bring this
forward critical to CYFD reform
like so many other bills this
session including H. B. two
eighty four which we are very
helpful the committee will hear
next week this session has been
a lot about protecting civil
rights including H. before the
speaker Egolf and Representative
Lewis on this committee have
fought for and passed in your
own committee it is time to
protect our state's most
vulnerable children and their
civil rights thank you thank you
next we have Alexander Harris
and.
Hello.
We can hear you.
Hello my name is Alexander
heroes and and I would say
former foster parent and
relatives pre adoptive parent
for little over a year
in my time I've had plenty
teachers through my home and
everything and while the Kevin
just summon as important and it
could take years codified by not
putting these rules in place now
you're going to continue to
allow.
Children in New Mexico to be
hurt I mean this is a good start
In the last year I've seen
teenagers who are able to run
away and be missing for eleven
out twelve months they're
allowed to get themselves hotel
rooms through other people and
just not really kept track of I
see kids be kept away from all
family relatives certificate and
everything for over a year and
had more adverse trauma because
with what CYFD did so the
changes are needed now even at
this low level to protect the
kids while the cabin as is
taking a couple years to get
result thank you thank you next
we have and McKinney.
Vice chair members of the
committee committee my name is
Dan McKinney and I stand in
strong support of HB to a two I
know when my son became a lawyer
he took an oath zealously
advocate for those who need and
deserve legal representation our
New Mexico children need this
now they need is Alistair fans.
They need is the Ellis defence
of their rights I believe this
bill strengthens the right to
stability and less because
trauma for children in foster
placements for use in states
care codifying the cabin SB CYFD
settlement agreement into law is
the right step to alter and
improve for now in the future
the trajectory of child welfare
in New Mexico to give our
children in foster care a better
chance to be safe he'll grow and
to thrive just as brown verses
brown vegetation was a landmark
ruling Kevin just to be CYFD has
been a landmark ruling for New
Mexico using this as a president
is the right action to establish
a legacy for the future of New
Mexico children you can make
this our legacy with your doctor
please vote for H. B. two oh two
to create a trauma responsive
system of care for children in
foster care.
Thank you next we have the
mobile.
Hi.
As a former foster parent I
would like to see that I stand
strongly for H. B. two oh two.
Thank you next we have Jill
Jones.

Mexico foster parent of almost
twelve years and also a mother
of three children who my doctors

system.
Today I would like to exercise
my first amendment rights and at
the risk of further retaliation
from CYFD I urge you to address
the serious problem at CYFD and
the need to put our children
first.
About anything else this is a
bill that will promote more
statewide the accountability
which we so strongly need and I
urge your continued attention
the bills hard this session
including H. B. two eighty four

And they have given the
directive that all children that
are played out of state needs to
be brought back unfortunately
I'm New Mexico the lack of it
and you're not paying proper.
You are overcrowded but not.
Eight we cannot wait for that
but what you that worked out
many of you here and you are.
Next we have Jim Jackson.
Madam chair members of the
committee Jim Jackson the
registered lobbyists for
disability rights New Mexico
the disability rights New Mexico
agrees with the point that a lot
of the previous speakers have
made but we think it's important
to put some of these basic
provisions into law now they can
certainly be amended or added to
our fine tuned in the future
depending on the specifics of
those of Solomon and the
procedures in this case but we
think it's helpful to put some
of these basics into into law
and so we support the hospital
to a two thanks.
Thank you lastly we have Douglas
Michelle.
Douglas if you'd like to make a
comment we didn't do need you to
you yourself on your and sorry
I'm.
Committee members thank you for
taking me out allowing me the
opportunity to speak
I am strongly in support of H.
B. two oh two I thank you as.
The previous commenters have
said that I mean why not put
something into effect now and
updated later we know that.
Other details will be worked but
we we know the basics of what
needs to be done there's no
reason for us to to wait for
years before actually
implementing something.
I thank you for time please
support H. B. two oh two thank
you I'm Representative anything
you'd like to Representative
with before we go to committee
for questions.
Thank you madam vice chair I
would just like to say that the
items in the house Judiciary
Committee substitute are items
that have already been agreed
upon and are already within the
inflammation implementation time
frame and items that fell
outside of that the in the
future were removed from the
substitute thank you very much.
Thank you first we have
Representative McQueen.
Thank you madam chair.
Madam chair sentencing email the
anticipated my first question
and that is the the the process
with the settlement agreement
so.
Just to probably repeat what you
just said.
the.
In your opinion the items in the
committee substitute.
Have been agreed to that
correct.
That is madam chair
Representative McQueen that is
correct.
In.
Representation Dixon those
There there won't change over
the course of the so many the
gestation.
Madam chair and Representative
queen no they will not but if I
may defer to my experts to
confirm the.
Representative Dixon
Representative McQueen madam
chair I'd be happy to address
this I'm looking at the cabin
just settlement agreement and
the target outcome that is
nearby so part just reads that
by December first twenty twenty
no child under eighteen will be
placed in any hotel motel out of
state provider Office of the
contractor or state agency
office unless in extraordinary
circumstances necessary to
protect the safety and security
of the child as documented in
the child's record and approved
by the secretary or protective
services director of CYFD we
were careful to make sure that
so partnered this target outcome
that has already been passed you
if other commenters were talking
about negotiation with that we
go to is the indicators to
measure the whether the
company's rules can decide if
that they had met their
obligations the defendants have
met their obligations to that
target it's not a moving target
it is well established.
Madam chair representative would
with the.
Representative some CYFD angry
without assessment.
Thank you Representative McQueen
it does look like we have all
read smile and you like risk is
raising their hands up hell I
can't remember if you receive
here HSD my apologies but if
you'd like to weigh in
we're going to go to next.
Thank you.
I'm Paul Ritz mind the chief
general counsel for Human
Services and I think that you
get some depth quite easily it's
a targeted outcome it's still is
not completely resolved it's the
the idea of placement is still
something that has to go through
the co neutrals and they have to
agree that we have met targeted
out come in there still some
negotiations around that so it's
not completely accurate that
Indians.
Absolutely set in stone.
I'm and your life just gets with
CYFD.
You lie somehow disappeared just
as we are calling on him.
It I was this something you
wanted to add to that yeah just
to echo what Paul was saying
that we have this is a real
dynamic process and so there are
multiple discussions we have
with the co neutral to provide
court oversight and we go over
it line by line the definitions
and what the meeting that's an
articulation of the cabinet
settlement so it's it's
constantly changing and so for
example in the bill under two F.
it does have new notice
requirements that are not part
of the settlement but even if
they where they're not
completely defined yet as we
continue to work through this
now the way that Kevin just is
being measured is to what's
called a data validation plan
which was negotiated with the
plaintiffs and it's a way of
determining definitions and how
we measure how CYFD HSD in the
state of New Mexico are in
following complying with the
settlement that data validation
plan has yet to be completed
we're still working very very
closely with the controls it's
not due to be completed until.
Later this spring into summer so
I right now to say that the bill
Mears the cabinet Madam I don't
think it's completely accurate
because the coming the
settlement is still being
defined and articulated so I
just wanted to again echo that
and also I did want to respond
to a statement that was made
earlier about out of state
placements and CYFD has done a
tremendous job very recently
reducing the number of out of
state placements from sixty now
down to twenty I just want to
put that thank you very much.
Thank you Representative you
still have the four.
Thank you madam chair mentor a
representation a in different
but related question do you know
how long it will be before the
seven the settlement is
finalized this is a.
This happened six months Sir in
your two or three years.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative McQueen if I
could please defer to agency
crack up misfortune.
Thank you I can answer that.
This is a multi year agreement
there are no terms that are
still in negotiations and terms
are set in New probably ninety
page agreement that I'm looking
at what's what's being
negotiated is how the
commercials will measure
performance toward the target
outcomes what the indicators are
of performance and compliance
and.
I hope that I've answered that
question it could take four
years it could take longer we do
have for vested lines and
certain targets other targets
are measured differently.
Thank if I could it could I just
add one thing Sir.
In terms of the state's effort
to bring the you out of state
back into the state
so I'm I trust the numbers that
we've just given that it's down
to twenty five when the losses
started it was a hundred and
sixty and I've been involved in
some of those conversations and
to the extent that these young
people are coming back is
because upper management and
supervisors are reviewing the
cases in coming up with
solutions which is exactly what
this does and since they are
bringing these young people back
it's not the frontline social
workers been working their money
gets
the more experienced people
having very meaningful staffing
figuring a way to bring them
back.
Thank you.
Thank you Madam chair
representative sent of.
Change change here's a little
bit
I heard descriptions of.
The kids sleeping on floors and
I heard descriptions of.
Undesirable facilities out of
state.
Within a short term stay in a
hotel or motel be preferable.
Do either of those.
What where we for closing.
If we're trying to keep kids off
floors.
Why are we for closing the
possibility of using a hotel or
motel.
I thank you madam chair and
Representative McQueen if I
could please to for this just
crack up.
Representative Dixon
Representative you madam chair.
I had a client who was seventeen
and she a year ago this exact
time last year she was a mother
to her one year old daughter she
was placed in a motel by CYFD I
can tell you affirmatively that
the kinds of behaviors that go
on in motels for a seventeen
year old whose rate been raised
by any agency for most of her
life she was not ready to deal
with that there is no
supervision it's dangerous she
was delivered food boxes with
items that required a kitchen to
prepare to prepare it was it was
a terrible situation and what
we're doing with this is not
precluding any of those
placements unfortunately we're
only adding notice requirements
and getting the eyes of upper
management at the very highest
level on these placement so that
planning can occur so that they
don't have to continue they can
be limited in duration as they
should be.
I hope I've answered your
question thank you so much.
So
Madam chairman you answer my
question to you give me another
question you said you're not
precluding them but.
It says a child shall not be
placed in a hotel or motel
except in extraordinary
circumstances.
So as you think that except
clause is the.
This safety valve on that.
Thank you Representative McQueen
I do I think that it what it
does is it makes it
extraordinary it doesn't make it
a regular fall back placement
and to go back to my client who
spent weeks in the receiving
center and there's he was I went
back to my records he spent days
there in September again in
November and weeks in December
so this is something that was
recurring for him and what we
want to do is get out of that we
need this system to function in
a way where children in you are
honored I mean he was
demoralized by this we we owe
them much more than that and we
owe them a placement that is not
the floor or the couch of a
receiving centre office and
that's what we're trying to do
with this provision thank you.
In terms for what what is the
alternative placement but I mean
I can I can imagine a placement
we would like to have which
would be a stable.
Carrying you know somewhat long
term situation but.
If that's not available what's
and you can set up sleeping on
the floor what's what's the
alternative here.
Madam chair and Representative
McQueen thank you so.
What's not included and not
precluded our placements in
homeless shelters the department
regularly relies on homeless
shelters statewide to it would
be sort of the next level of
placement so ensuring that there
are availability in no shelters
ensuring really what we're
moving towards is support
recruit retain and support
foster parents so these are used
with predictable trauma
behaviors foster parents the
trauma responsive training they
need to be supported feel like
they are valued by the
department and when they're
issues around a placement for
example with the teen who has
predictable behaviors that are
difficult to deal with they can
turn to the agency and have the
support to learn how to manage
that and and also of course.
The other proposals in this bill
through the behavioral health
collaborative desperately needed
services so what we're seeing is
that children able to maintain
and foster settings when the
foster parents have support but
also the children have the
mental health services that they
desperately need.
That answers your question.
Could it does and doesn't
I mean I.
Everybody in people being
unsupervised at almost shelter
it might be possible for them to
have their own room someplace
they can you know.
look at your
The City of Santa Fe recent
recently purchased a
hotel motel
this sweet
configuration that there are
kitchen that's.
for transitional housing
you know I I could see
establishing some sort of
You know kind of a group home
kind of situation and all of the
same as foster care when you're
dealing with.
Older teenagers
So you know I I certainly I I
share your concerns
I'm also hear the concerns of
Our state agencies so mentre
Representative Dixon thank you.
Madam chair.
May I respond.
Representative.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative McQueen I think
those are good points but I
think also it's important to
remember is that.
The process of the cabin a
settlement determined that these
placements are not in the best
interests of the child the the
children and so only in
extraordinary circumstances
should they be used and the
department needs to be coming up
with additional resources that
are safer and less traumatizing
for the children thank you very
much.
Next we have Representative
Nibert.
Thank you madam chair
The number of questions and
shared many of the same concerns
are Representative McQueen just
NM stated so I won't repeat
those.
Beginning on page three.
One eight nine.
I'm a bit confused as to why we
need the in service line
because.
It looks to me like we capture.
All.
Children.
it says.
The planned for delivery of
behavioral health services shall
include specific service plans
to address the needs of infants
children and adolescents.
That's.
Would that be.
All children that would be
subject to customary of CYFD.
Madam chair representative.
I thank you madam chair and
representative Nibert if I may
refer to expert Mr house at the
end of for this answer thank
you.
I'm gonna kick that over this
error if that's alright with you
madam chair and Representative
Dixon.
Yes sorry thank you madam chair.
Madam chair representative Dixon
representative Nibert.
What we find is that the kids is
that often these are plans are
the youth that fall through the
cracks anything we can do to
strengthen their rights in this
children's mental health code
for specific services we want to
do one of the things we saw and
whether reasons we brought the
cavernous lawsuit is that of
course there are existing laws
that cover a lot of the issue
areas we race and that completes
the Americans with disabilities
act for example but what we're
seeing is they're not being
applied in individual cases so
what this does is it directs
advocates and judges in
children's court.
To a specific provision that
says that these agencies
happened that the collaborative
has to specifically target it's
children in the custody of CYFD
to provide the specific service
plans and that's important
because we need our advocates in
our children's court judges to
know that we have elevated their
rights under the code how about
answer your question thank you.
Madam chair that's correct I
don't think it does that I think
it just make sure a subset of
the larger population does the
exact opposite of what you just
wanted.
But I just don't see the need
for putting up there because I
mean you could you could do the
same thing with the adults and
seniors you know who are subject
to
of the various programs that we
have it.
I I just don't see the the need
to to do that and put it there
just means that they're just
barely a subset of all children
and adolescents representative
children and adolescents
So I I don't I don't understand
why that
would be would be there and.
Yes the bill would not help help
the cause
so we're moving to A. J..
Which is the page that the.
Representative McQueen
talked about.
But I to concerned about this
paragraph and.
Yes indeed the HSD.
Has made a commitment that I
think they did so to that that
they would like to see those
codified after.
The dust settles so to speak
I'm wondering yes.
Is this.
These amendments are premature.
In the sense of so.
We ought to let the agency.
I am the co lead roles.
Figure some of this stuff out
and then come back.
We're recommendations for
putting in the stature the very
things that have ultimately been
are finalized and have been
determined to be in the in the
best interest of the children
So it seems to me the the.
The.
Legislation that's been for us.
maybe a little bit premature.
So my question is
well I have several questions
regarding Walser
first one Madam chair
or Representative is a lawsuit
still pending does the court
have any oversight role.
With respect to this matter.
And thank you madam chair and
representative Nibert if I may
defer to escalation.
Yes thank you madam chair
representative so the part of
the settlement agreement was
begins to staff the dismissed
and that was in a good faith
effort that we did not need a
court oversight for it we do
have this was mentioned three
hundred shows who are skilled
and are overseeing and giving
feedback and there is an R. B.
tracing clause if we can resolve
this we certainly haven't needed
that yet.
So I hope that answers your
question but the case has been
formally dismissed and we
certainly hope I mean part of
our up to with you know what to
call usual set up working with
the departments and this
legislation is that it doesn't
have to be in a class action
lawsuit it's not the best way to
go thank you.
Madam chair representative to
the COVID trolls have to report
to the court.
If I may
Madam chair representative they
don't report to the court the
court has nothing to do with
that they do
they meet with us being the
implementation team then meet
with the department we all meet
together couple times they will
be submitting some reports on a
matter that is in the settlement
with dates and the supports
become public documents for
everyone to see.
Representative Nibert I wanted
to add that the general counsel
at HSD had their hand raised
were you interested in hearing
the response on your question.
yes ma'am I I would certainly
want to you're the agency's
response on on those matters and
other matters.
Thank you Representative Nibert
all right so if you'd like to
respond to the representatives
questions yes just briefly I
think the fact that we entered
into a settlement agreement we
settled on a massive lawsuit we
paid the plaintiffs attorneys a
large sum of money to settle
lawsuit we hired co neutrals and
we made a big commitment to
moving forward with all of these
plans and all of these targeted
outcomes is a demonstration that
we've already made the
commitment to move forward and
correct these things and and
Representative Nibert you're
absolutely right that the
getting it completely put
together over the course of the
next year would be the would be
the good way to go about this
and then we could codified into
statute I think all of the
people on the state side who
negotiated the settlement would
have been shocked to have under
the that we would go to all the
trouble of negotiating this and
then we would be sitting in the
legislature faced with caught a
find something that is part of
the settlement but has not been
completed.
Sure.
Thank you for pointing out the.
Mr Burciaga so this artistry
please remind me of the future
of that happens because I'm I'm
reading my computer and notes
and everything else.
So they the lawsuit madam chair
has been
completely so.
The court is not involved I
understand the testimony
correctly and that we have a
settlement agreement but that
settlement agreement.
Continues to be worked on as is
that an actor is my
understanding in that regard
madam chair and representative.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative Nibert
Eddie misfortune if you could
answer that.
I'm sorry I don't mean to be
rude if you could repeat it real
quickly pots.
Yes ma'am.
My understanding based on the
testimony now is a the lawsuit
has been completely so.
Record is no longer
retaining jurisdiction over the
matter.
But that the settlement
agreement has been entered into.
There is an effort that's
continuing to be made I suppose
on the boards of both parties
the.
I understand the defendants to
work on the actual fine
Points within the framework of
that general settlement
agreement is my understanding
correct.
Representative Nibert I think
that is correct the conditionals
as we said are not judges you
correct this is out of the court
and again this legislation
awfully addresses what's already
been resolved there are a number
of issues that we did not
include because we know that
they are still being negotiated
between the department and the
call new channels like a whole
data system like tracking any
young any child who's in the
more than three placements over
thousand days there's a number
of deliverables this is just one
that's already been resolved and
that's that's all this
legislation is that's why
everything else was taken out
and it will take a couple years
to codify this and we all agree
that's proper the system major
overhaul of the very broken
system most of the people in
charge of the system now didn't
break it they agreed to go work
and and dedicate themselves to
fixing up and everyone and
knowledge is that.
so I mean I we can go on if the
settlement is on line if you
want look all the deliverables
in terms of workforce
development in terms of a good
training in terms of you know
cutting down placements
assistance to simple things
again that does not.
It take anything away to said
the level of supervision before
these young people are and
hotels are in out of state
placements because we all know
we could go on and on we don't
want to eat it all your time
which is.
Harihar of stories of kids dying
in out of state facilities and
things that have happened.
So I hope that answers your
question representative Nibert
madam chair.
Representative HSD NC lefty
raising their hands again if
you'd like to hear from the
agencies.
the staff and effort respond
madam chair it seems to me the
yes.
This legislation only touching
one point of a variety of things
that they're working on it even
drives fall further.
The idea that we ought to let
the.
Mexico neutrals in the party's
resolve.
All the issues and come back as
the chief general counsel
Representative has indicated
that they are willing to have
robust legislation that will put
them to statute.
The various things that the
ultimately get resolved through
that settlement process it and
not do it maybe piecemeal that
they may be required now and so
it it does seem to me that maybe
we are
inserting ourselves into this
matter a little prematurely that
we ought to give the agencies
and the code trolls I am the.
I am just trying to to resolve a
number of issues and then come
back.
Where.
Hopefully better legislation
that better addresses.
Even additional issues and the
that that hopefully have been
resolved to the satisfaction of
both the agencies and the
plaintiffs in that case and so
you know again I I think the the
I think we may be a little bit
of.
Out of ourselves on those but I
would like to hear from from
both of the agencies with
respect to that comment as well
as maybe my
retort to it.
Madam chair.
Madam chair representative
Nibert may I respond to that as
well.
Yes after they respond okay
thank you thank you
representative will first go to
CAFD.
Thanks.
Thank you I'll be brief I just
want to reiterate again see why
these commitment to collaborate
on a future bill that that
really codifies that settlement
when we are at that place where
we have fully work through that
process in the meantime I also
want to note that in the
settlement the state will be as
required by the settlement the
state will be providing a report
this summer on our progress it's
a public report also including
in that is our base line
reporting data validation plan
which shows that how we measure
our progress and then in
November in accordance with the
settlement the co neutrals will
also be providing a public
record that will be a
determining how we are meeting
the requirements and the state
and the definition chins in the
standards as we work with them
so at again I just want to
reiterate how much we look
forward to.
How to find parts of the cabinet
settlement and and really
working on it in collaboration
with the co neutrals I hope
getting their subject matter
expertise as far as I know they
haven't been consulted in this
process so again just want to
reiterate that we do look
forward to how to find Kevin
just at the appropriate time
when we can have a full blast.
The thank you thank you and HSD
programs not.
Yes I just wanted to bring up a
couple of things if you look on
page three of the bill where it
says that there will be a plan
for delivery behavioral health
services and then you include
the legal custody of children
youth and families department.
That is part of the cavernous
settlement agreement that plan
for kids in custody is something
that's being worked out and will
be worked out over the course of
the next several months and and
be approved by the co neutrals
the same thing is true for the
additional language on page four
which calls for a plan that
applies to children in the legal
custody of CYFD that's another
thing that's that's not even
fully developed yet the final
language in the bill although
it's a little more specific we
still have work to do on that in
it it really is something that
needs to be completely fleshed
out and then of course you heard
secretary Scrase Secretary
Blalock or or you lie on behalf
of Secretary Blalock the the
departments have a complete
commitment to come back to this
to the legislature and codified
these fully baked plans in
statute so that so that we do
have a permanent fix to the
system but if we're not allowed
to work out all the details and
we're sort our hands are tied at
the very beginning it's going to
frustrate the purpose of of the
settlement agreement and the
work of the cone neutrals and I
just want to have the the COVID
neutrals have commented to us
that they were not consulted on
this bill and they do have
concerns about.
Thank you madam chair thank here
well.
To the sectors
Madam chair and representative
you want to comment on that
thank you madam chair and
representative Nibert yes
what I wanted to sort of bring
back in context was that we are
here today because thirty years
ago the Joseph a settlement.
Was not those obligations were
not met and we have the choice
to act now on issues that have
been agreed upon and.
We have had the date of target
implementation and so we can act
in codified them or we can kick
the can down the road
and hope is that we are able to
get something through a future
legislative session and
potentially with the a different
administration so I just wanted
to provide a little bit of that
historical context as well thank
you.
Madam chair representative
that's not quite accurate is not
checking the can down the road a
settlement agreement is being
are implemented and points of it
are being.
Advanced even as we speak that
resume
and.
In that regard it's not check in
the can down the road it's
waiting for that process to
reach its final conclusion and
then we would be able to to
codify in statute the things
that they agree are are not only
reasonable but the practical in
terms of protecting the children
in New Mexico who find
themselves in these unfortunate
situations so you know it it it
seems to me that if we caught a
fly in statute Representative
Rehm pointed out.
That a child shall not be point.
M..
We have taken out of the hands
of the people that are
negotiating of the settlement we
we've taken that out of their
hands it it's now all right here
or or our imposition of of our
thoughts on that before they've
even had a chance to to to maybe
what I am fully on that of the
issue of the COVID neutrals have
have the COVID roll band
contacted and are they
supporting this legislation
Madam chair representative.
I'm thank you madam chair and
representative if I could defer
to ms crack up please.
Thank you madam chair
representatives I appreciate the
opportunity to follow up on this
we first of all no one is more
concerned than the plainest
implementation team about
hamstringing children's rights
under the settlement agreement
by prematurely codifying a very
small portion of the agreement
that has already which outcome
was already do.
We take this very seriously I
have an update just before this
committee hearing that the
controls were cheering and
concerned that we might be for
closing opportunities for
children in a previous drafts
they they are not concerned
about the draft that is before
this committee.
So what we're looking at is
providing an opportunity under
support for children and youth
who are endorsed by any agency
charged with the care.
And.
Really supposed to be ensuring
that they're thriving to make
sure they don't sleep on the
floor of an office or get placed
in a hotel or get answers to a
residential treatment center out
of state and forgotten about
without the eyes of upper
management on them and without
extraordinary circumstances we
need this provision children in
custody need this provision now.
Let me answer your question
thank you.
Madam chair representative.
Is it your testimony that the
coder trolls.
I
believe that this legislation.
Still allows them to engage in
their important work that needs
to be done on these issues.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative Nibert if I could
defer to my experts for that
answer.
Representative Dixon and
representative Nibert this year
asset building disability by New
Mexico are I would want to give
find the most recent draft to
the call neutrals to let them
look at it because I'm not we
are not sure exactly what they
had been presented before ended
being updated but I think we
certainly do not want to do
anything.
That be violative of the
settlement agreement and
hamstring that the vision for
what should happen for children
in the state so in response to
that question R. I think a lot
of representations have been
made and I think we want to be
clear exactly what to do what
they call neutrals of seeing and
what their position is we
believe that we've been very
diligent when we've been asked
by the legislature what
provisions could be codified
that would be helpful to be so
state that we have targeted
one specific provision here now
in section F. Representative
Nibert it madam chair this
section F..
Is critical to put people on
notice right now.
That this is something that CYFD
in HSD had said is operational
now December first the people
have been told policies have
been enacted to say that kids
should not be placed out of
state or administrative offices
motel Harlow thousand less these
extraordinary circumstances
happen so we are this is not
premature but most importantly
it is not hidden away in a
policy is leading guarded lives
no attorneys no judges know that
there's a red flag here if a kid
is being placed there.
Is so that's why it's important
we're trying to rebuild the
system here in New Mexico it's
gonna take a lot but there's
kids right now that needs some
urgent protections in this
section F..
Is the really Keyes provision
here to focus on that is a
hamstring in anybody they've
already Representative they've
already enacted it they're
saying they're doing this.
So we're just put the lyric sure
that all the stakeholders know
about this the people are
project I'm sorry I want a
little bit too long but I want
to be responsive to that issue.
Chair and representative the
protection.
The immediate protection.
Is.
The commitment of the agency.
The media production is getting
the details of the settlement
worked out.
If we interject ourselves into
this matter and don't get it
right.
then then we have.
Up so the we go shooting process
that's currently under way and
yeah and I'm concerned of the
COVID rules have not been.
Brought to the table
I have information that we see
agencies believe that the COVID
girls have expressed some
concerns about.
This legislation and that it
might free up some very
important work that that is
currently being engaged.
And that it may be disruptive to
that process yes if those
statements are accurate.
Then.
Put into statute.
Those things Women's their
ability to to resolve these
issues M. and so it looks to me
why we are entirely.
Premature in this legislation I
think the I thank the people
that have testified from the
agencies have reflected a good
faith effort in trying to
resolve these issues I I would
assume that the co neutrals that
are engaged in the process are
absolutely committed to making
sure that the settlement
agreement moves forward that
those points to get fully
fleshed out negotiated and that
you arrive at a a good ending
point at which time.
You have.
A complete body of work that you
can come to this body and get it
put in statute so that judges
and guardian Adlai items and all
the other people involved in the
process know exactly what the
rules are but to interject
ourselves.
At this point in time I think
has some some of the potential
adverse consequences and it
certainly ties of everyone's
hands with respect to the issues
that are raised here which may
not be fully fleshed out at this
point time so I'm I'm concerned
about that I think the.
I think that
you know the average it's
obviously are going to be
holding the HSD speak to the
fire I assume that that
settlement agreement has some
very good terms are.
It appears I have good lawyers
that so would have made sure
that the terms in there require
that process to move forward on
an expeditious basis and and we
ought to let that process work
and then come back and have a
much more robust
piece of legislation that the
agency themselves have said
they're willing to to get behind
and support madam chair I have
no further further questions
thank you for the debate.
Thank you next we have
Representative Lewis.
Thank you.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative you know I I
I don't want to.
Continue is already been said
I'm I'm grateful for my
colleagues for acts us so many
important questions but I just
want to let you know about my
experience Representative
because since twenty eighteen
I've been working with different
advocacy groups but really CYFD
has come to the table to work
with the to ensure that issues
that are important items
including he and tribal
customary adoption and State FY
so everyone at CYFD and their
staff has been extremely helpful
I think we cap folks on a call
yesterday for like eight hours
and finalized of the provisions
but you know just.
And just to kind of reiterate
what's been said about the pre
maturity of things but also just
having folks from CYFD I I
honestly haven't worked with
eight it's just a are any others
in that plan I think this but
their their commitment and their
word to saying they will work
with folks in the future I just
wanted to give you my personal
experience because we have had
nothing but cooperation and
ensuring that they're working
with advocates to prop the state
and also the sovereign nations
to address the one bill that I'm
carrying as the Indian child
welfare act or New Mexico so I
just wanted to give you that
reassurance but also state my
hesitancy and supporting this
bill because of
They're still being things that
are needing to be worked out and
having a bill that does
something like this again is
just premature but I do support
your intent and I think your
intent is great and I wish you
luck with getting something that
folks can get on board with
because I think this is an
important issue to our children
and our families and I just want
to thank you for your advocacy
thank you madam chair.
Thank you next we have
Representative Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative I probably
echo the same comments about
one having.
Feeling pretty good about the
commitment from the
administration.
And if if it's not quite ready
to do it I'm I'm a little on the
fence
because if the components you've
done now are really okay with
the co equals that the
controls done
then maybe and I would want if
it passes out of here I would
want absolute clearest
reassurance that they've seen
the bill in the present form and
are okay with the provisions
that are in there now otherwise
I I wouldn't support it on the
floor so I I think that that's a
key thank them at bit have be
absolutely sure that that this
first step if you will is okay
and not going to be on any
unintended consequences are tied
their hands and anyway so that's
so I'm a little on the fence
about whether this one might be
okay and whether we should let
it go but not to the floor
unless there is clear.
You know confirmation from the
from the co neutrals but
that that's kind of where I am
as well that this first step may
be okay but it's definitely not
all done yet and needs to on
needs to complete the process to
to really do this right.
Hello and thank you madam chair
thank you Representative.
You madam chair Representative
Chasey.
Yes thank you madam chair and I
really appreciate hearing from
everyone and I I actually been
listening but I had to.
File a motion to dedicated to PR
next Tuesday.
K. Y. Representative thirteen
year old and and that I know the
department is really struggling
to try to figure out
alternatives in that case to
termination of parental rights
to see if they can't do are
subsidized guardianship for.
People who.
may not meet the Department
stringent criteria for effective
Kim that they needed and it and
the kinship guardianship act and
so I mean I.
Google I'll complex all these
cases are and
I I read the complaint in Cavan
asked when it was first filed I
admired the department which was
under new leadership by them or
C. will settle because we're not
going to try to defend this case
the evidence is to.
Halling and we need to make
changes.
And.
I've also been interviewed by
the co neutrals and I don't know
if I was interviewed because I
practiced law in this area and
have done so for eight years or
a fine sure the house district
fifty but I was interviewed by
them and it was very lengthy
interview.
And very
provocative it in terms of.
Really analyzing the system so I
know that.
Right now everyone is at the
table trying to make something
good happen so here's.
I'm also interested because it
actually seems like this bill
has become something.
It's become very stripped down.
And I'm interested
in the position on the
Mexico neutrals at this point
the other thing.
I would just.
Torrez is.
At some point if not now
codifying the the settlement.
Because that's how we have
continuity in our state law and
policy.
Another administration.
Could take us back to.
The need for another come in
just as was described by the.
Proponents.
So what.
What questions within a
suggestion perhaps it may not be
on may not be helpful but.
Where are we did and I would ask
because I was writing a motion
and a proposed order I can't.
Say that I followed every detail
so did the departments say.
They're a year away from this
for two years or.
I hear them pleading for more
time what did they say they
could was there time frame.
For implementing.
The whole settlement.
Thank you madam chair and vice
chair do you want to for us to
answer that or do you want the
if I'm Mr Chairman all.
On.
I first you Representative Dixon
madam chair.
Representative so that you know.
Thank you madam chair and vice
chair if I could defer to
misplacement.
Sure.
Representative Chasey thank you
for the question so
Kevin this Madam is is being
phased and earn very
deliberately as I think.
It's complex it's a broken
system and that was done that's
was the negotiation which
everyone felt were very fair
time frames and I will just add
as a side note that about half
of the deliverables that we do
this year we agree to postpone
them due to call the and the
pandemic so even the first set
of deliverables was cut way
back.
It is the reality of what was
happening.
And I am a little confused with
the department the state needs
the only and that the reason the
bill got stripped down
Representative Chasey madam
chair specifically what you're
saying so that the only thing in
this bill is what is already
done been a deliverable you know
there may be some like tweaking
within the department but in
terms of the intent in terms of
you know what's been presented
the coordinates also it went
from however many pages to
twenty one down to nine pages
specifically to address that
with the intent of coming back
and over a few years codifying
it everything but only codifying
it as is the deliverable due
date that everyone negotiating
agreed upon.
So we don't want to put more in
there than is is expected is
just really you know Google
simple things if you are needs
to be in office how the
supervisor review and have a
good reason if we use needs to
be sent to an out of out of
state treatment facility have
someone review it you know
notify people and just keep some
eyes on it.
so I I hope that answers your
question Madam chair
representative.
Sure we have the department
respond as well if that would be
okay madam chair if we now have
secretary Scrase with his hand
raised back in our committee so
secretary Scrase you like to
respond.
Getting a needed at thank you
very much madam chair and Madam
chairman and chief see as well I
think the answer to your
specific question is about a
year one year I think we'll have
everything pretty well nailed
down in terms of the plans and I
think it's that point would be
the appropriate time to to
codify that in again just say it
again what we would be more than
happy to do that we just do not
want to get out ahead of our
commuter rails and also I would
offer that I'm.
Well it would be interesting for
all of us to know what the co
neutrals thought about the bill.
We're anxious not to put them in
a position that would
potentially make them no longer
neutral on sale.
That's that's not a delicate
balance and now I think at I
think a place where they would
they would prefer to stay
neutral I think I can say that.
Confidence.
Madam chair I might just earlier
someone Mr Festus waited and
said there's a report due to the
state on their deliverables in
April I believe and then another
touchstone in November if I have
that accurately.
So those are based on and I
believe that you sharing their
update and also the data system
they use to measure their
benchmarks and CYFD does have
their hand up if you're
interested in hearing a more
accurate what tempted to share
Mr Festus.
You madam chair yes so it's it's
actually this is one according
to the settlement we are
required to provide a progress
report publicly posted I'm and
then in November the controls
will then review all of the
commitments and deliverables in
the settlement and provide a
report in November.
Okay.
So those all of the responses
bill.
Thank you madam chair okay.
So.
What I hear them is the this
crack at and
Displacement.
Course you representative is
that you want to be sure.
That.
Starting is to accept that there
will be a plan to.
I'm looking at page.
For.
My seventeen through twenty one.
Process plant with this process.
Those are all the things that we
want to do anyway in these
cases.
And then.
That whole issue Emergency.
Placement.
So that children.
Don't end up in a hotel motel or
with another state provider.
Except in extraordinary
circumstances.
Without approval by the
secretary or the director of
HSD.
Notification of the guardian of
light
And then you're gonna have to
obtain consent for a fourteen
year old which radically you're
supposed to do that now but I
I've had fourteen year olds who
didn't actually consent that
they may not have the capacity.
I'm.
Is that right is that right this
question miss crack up.
Madam chair thank you.
Correct that these are the
provisions we would like to have
operational now to have the
effect of law so that advocates
in children's court judges will
understand these are the rights
of children now they don't have
to wait a year and I don't under
and what systems we have to be
put in place that don't already
exist we deferred to the fact
that the data validation system
the data is not valid.
We were in the provision that
would have pushed up on that
challenge and when the controls
reached out to nineteen thank
you.
Concern that we would be
limiting limiting children's
rights by not having in your of
that thousand day the number of
plates to teach them thousand
every thousand days near at the
exact language of the settlement
agreement.
Allies that the department's not
ready they they they can't track
placement you can't go into the
fax system and run a report on
your clients placements he
doesn't for placement so we we
removed
that provision because we didn't
want to open a door for more
cover up of placement changes
that are green but not being
tracked we understand that we
need to do very well in the
controls stated to us today and
I think the secretary spaces
right this is not the county
troubles area to legislate or
two just to weigh in on
legislation when they reach out
to our team just a if.
Continue with the language in
the previous track which they
didn't understand it already
removed.
There might you know as
plaintiffs we may have concerns
for our clients that language no
longer exists but I also want to
come back to secretary spaces
point which is
and who trust have no part in
weighing in on legislation
that's not their role and I
think he's very correct asking
them to do that which our team
did not do that.
That pulls them out and and then
maybe create some conflicts that
shouldn't exist for their
ability to oversee this element.
Have I been to your question
thank you yes thank you madam
chair and what
We wanted to you know we've got
a team of attorneys that we call
on the brains of the south at
our analysts and all of us of
the committee we want to know
what everybody thinks so we're
the ones trying to draw them out
not you I just wanna make that
clear so what occurs to me.
Is that
It sounds like there's been a
lot of cooperation and time
frames postponed due to the
pandemic your everyone
responsible about that.
you're really looking for a
temporary provision here so what
if we put a sunset clause.
I'm just.
Question so that we're
acknowledging.
That this is
This is time limited that you're
you have anticipation of
something else and I'm not an
expert on sunset clauses so I'm
I would be happy if one of our
analysts are are something that
the office that you know that
doesn't get you anything but
it's it's actually an
acknowledgement that we we trust
this will
Meet your expectations
thoroughly in the future.
Madam chair I heard that your
question but you are cutting in
and out so I might ask you to
while getting a laugh yes.
And.
So I'm wondering if there's
anyone even our our analyst I'm
not sure who am I just want
to many papers here along with
my motion an order extras hi.
I'm.
It putting a sunset clause.
My H..
Of the eight the needs of the
departments to oppose this.
So maybe I should ask them and
Representative Dixon.
If you have a and you certainly
way and.
Thank you madam chair and Joanne
J. C. I'd be interested in the
feedback from your analyst as
well I believe that Misco studio
messed miss Castillo.
Did the analysis.
I'm sorry I was just distracted
by a text telling me that I was.
The Republicans were informed
that this committee would end by
three thirty but somehow I
didn't get that memo I'm.
The state.
Okay.
I'm I'm sorry I Representative
Nibert I did not know that so
I.
So Representative Representative
Nibert choose that you want us
to let you know when or if we
take action on this.
Representative was there thank
you wanted to share with the
committee.
Related to timing and taking
action.
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
I just heard my name I just got
what I just walked over the
round house and got back into
wifi range.
I'm having to our caucus meeting
if we're gonna take some action
I'd like to know but the if
we're not gonna take some action
and don't worry about it.
I wasn't advised that our
meeting was to and at three
thirty.
Also.
That's okay.
That's your I was.
Questioning and then the mayor's
Development reproductive of the
caucus meetings so I so want to
mention committee of the sub of
some agreement have been struck
by it doesn't matter.
Okay.
All right well I'll let you know
when it's time to vote for
voting so let's go back to the
question about the sunset
clause.
If that would
It's.
And everyone recognized nearly.
Secretary Scrase would like to
weigh in on your question okay
I'll let him do that and I'll
let I wanted Representative
Dixon madam chair to way under
well okay thank you.
Yes madam chair and and members
of the committee Representative
Chasey op I think that the
position of both CYFD and and
HSD I'd speak for Secretary
Blalock here is that up.
That.
In particular the one paragraph
at the end of the bill that we
asked to have removed what was
left and that was the part we
had the most trouble it within
still has and I would also just
say that we have gone way out of
our way to attempt to not
characterize any any opinions of
the commercials that we might
have heard on this bill but it's
very difficult for me that I in
my and my comments without
mentioning that I'm.
At the to characterize them as
not having a problem with the
bill it's as it is written now
are even here that I I would
suggest we ignore that just for
the good of the decision making
process thank you okay.
Was there
Someone else who wished not go
ahead Representative Dixon.
Thank you madam chair and
gentleman to see I am.
I don't I am not as familiar
with sunsets and sort of how
that would work so I think more
information on that would be
good and getting.
Additional feedback from
analysts although I I do believe
my expert witness misplacement
looks like she.
Maybe it was going to weigh in
as well.
Madam chair would maybe not it's
madam chair yes misplacement go
ahead.
So I think the idea of the
sunset clause is an interesting
idea it would.
kind of acknowledge the state
this is the beginning.
This but I have let's see I
don't know enough about it I
would John comfortable taking a
strong position that's in the
back from that analysts.
That was helpful at all but
thank you.
Madam chair representative.
Okay I'm I while we wait to hear
from Representative Chasey I
appreciated the the long.
And their discussion many of the
questions I have have certainly
been addressed and partially
answered at least with the best
of our capacities it has been
mentioned though that some of
you all participating today and
letting your incredible
expertise and commitment to our
kids are part of an
implementation team is that
something that we find in the
settlements who's part of this
team what what is that that you
all are referencing.
Thank thank you madam chair if I
can defer to expert witnesses.
Happy to address thank you madam
chair representatives yes so
part of the settlement agreement
included that anticipation of
plaintiffs implementation team
coordinating with the Mexico
neutrals
regularly and doing outreach in
the community to ensure that the
way that the settlement is
implemented budget the community
based on where we are now and so
that is included in the
agreement members of our team
include miss Fleischman at this
is legal services I also want to
contract through this is legal
services to implement we have
attorneys from disability rights
New Mexico we have our Policy
attorneys from public council
there in California we have two
attorneys through that agency in
offered we also have terror Ford
who was the co founder of
Pegasus legal services for
children and and is now eight
law professor at Stanford Law so
we have a really large group
also failed to mention we have
to re CNN who is the executive
director at native American
disability rights so we have
a large team and I'm not
remembering also doctor Davis so
we have a number of attorneys
and then we have doctor Davis
who helps us with the behavioral
health portion of the agreement
all working together
communicating on a daily basis
and as I mentioned this is
anticipated in the settlement I
hope that I answered your
question yes but to clarify this
is not in coordination or
collaboration with the agencies
overseeing the state's response
to Kevin just.
It is in collaboration that so
the plaintiffs team needs to the
controls as to defendant's and
once a year I believe is the
number of times we need together
as a group.
But the daily efforts that you
all are referencing are external
to our state agencies it
appears.
Well the state agencies are
coordinating their ends to
comply and the plane theme is is
coordinating our and to ensure
compliance meets what we thank
the state agreement requires so
I'm not sure if if I'm answer if
I understand your question
that's helpful just in the way
that it was offered it sounded
to me like this was an
implementation team that
included all the players but to
clarify its a plaintive sent
implementation team is key we do
have a the hand of general
counsel for HSD Mr it's not the
wanted to weigh in on my
question.
I just wanted to say that
there's nothing in the
settlement agreement that calls
out of specific plaintiffs
implementation team there is a
small provision in it that talks
about implementing the
settlement agreement in the
attorney's fees provision of the
settlement agreement but there
is no specific section in the
settlement agreement that says
there there is created in
implementation team of the
plaintiffs who will do this that
and the other thing there's
nothing like that the settlement
agreements.
Thank you
CYFD Mr press guess if you want
to weigh in on that question.
Yet just to briefly echo with
general counsel this much is
mentioned the negotiation
process was extensive over
almost two years of negotiating
very closely with an arbitrator
and the plaintiffs and if they
wanted to have an implementation
team put into the settlement you
know that that should have been
something that we could have
negotiated but it was not and so
if you read this Madam there is
a Mr business that I'm nothing
in their settlements that at
defines an implementation team
or anything like it thank you.
Okay and then finally as I
consider what's in front of us
as a policy maker it is of no to
me that your committee
substitute Representative does
not include an appropriation.
At that up thank you madam chair
that is correct it does not we
do not believe that there is a
significant fiscal impact.
any fiscal impact thank you
Representative I.
I'm called to the compelling
stories and harrowing stories
that I know you're incredible
team has witnessed in their work
for children across New Mexico
but I also have a minute of
experience in state government
and I always promised myself
that I ran for office I wouldn't
beat one of those folks like
shaking my finger from the
outside expecting the state to
make magic happen with no
resource so I certainly
appreciate the intentions of you
all and bringing this forward
and I agree I I agree that when
Kevin just is fully settled and
decided that certainly it is on
us as policy makers to make sure
that we codified codified the
important agreements here to
make sure their place in New
Mexico lost forever but when we
get to that time and I don't
think we're quite there yet when
we get to that time.
We need to fund these agencies
to make sure that we're not
stuck between a rock and a hard
place as my colleagues have
mentioned earlier on is a hotel
ideal no is a homeless shelter
ideal no when I think of the
system impacted young people
that I've been honored to know
and learn from in my life there
is reasonable considerations
related to safety that they've
told me the only thing that
happens at a homeless shelter is
sexual assault so when I think
about being able to offer a
hotel room with a locking door
like one of my colleagues
mentioned in the absence of
holistic trauma informed
responses that potentially could
be an option that I think could
be a possible beyond whatever
the undefined extraordinary
circumstances are so I just I
certainly think that it's on all
of us and our colleagues on the
appropriations committees to
make sure that we appropriately
fund what it's going to take so
that our kids in New Mexico have
real and reasonable resources to
hold them and keep them safer in
whatever moments they're
changing and and facing as they
move through systems so those
are my comments for today I
don't think we're quite there
yet I look forward to to
standing with you making sure
that we put in legislation if
this doesn't pass today what's
important for kids moving
forward Committee with that I
don't see any further hands
raised looks like speaker Egolf
would like to weigh in.
With that is is because come on
camera.
I was just getting a little bit
I would maybe just add one
comment madam chair and that is
to me it seems like we've got a
really complicated issue that's
been heavily litigated and we've
got both the plaintiffs and the
defendants here before us asking
for us to help them with the
implementation of what they and
like the the court agreed is the
best way forward and it seems to
me that we should.
Yeah rely on.
The advice and counsel of people
who have been litigating against
each other for some extended
period of time it's I don't know
that I can recall when both
sides of the contentious case to
come before the legislature
asking for charging settlement
to be implemented this that's
pretty unusual situation and
that carries an of that carries
tremendous weight with me
to have this kind of an
agreement
I think you significant so I I
I'm and I'm inclined to support
I just with legislation Keith
bill moving in thank you the
conversation going thank you.
Madam chair representative
Chasey.
You one of the things that was
pointed out to me by one of the
analyst with and trying to
figure this out is that.
The
The paragraph over which we're
having a dispute.
Mentions that
Going to find the right line
just one.
Okay child should be placed in a
hotel or motel for within our
state provider.
I'm just reading those lines
online seventeen and eight.
One of our analysts has been a
constant you and other state
and she pointed out that.
She had some children.
In a case where she served us
their pasta and.
They're out of state provider
with their grandparents.
So
it seems to hire that
there could be more specificity
and clarity and that will.
Section
after section.
On pages eight and nine and what
I don't know if if she offered
Any.
Any suggestions in our analysis
the poll released in.
I don't know why it is opening
a.
Too many
things I'm trying to follow on
the.
On the other page on I checked
with the speaker and he didn't
tell anybody we do finish by
three thirty so just.
Madam chair and.
Would you like
for us to respond specifically
to the wording of provider yes
okay.
Thank you madam chair and at
chairman Chasey it is so in this
case it refers to a facility not
relatives but if one of my
experts would like to elaborate
that might be helpful thank you.
Madam chair Representative Dixon
yes the intent to.
It is not grandma or auntie or
some other amazing relatives
that are tenants really geared
toward up of sliced mint
facility
There is different like in this
state most of the facilities are
licensed by CYFD or there's some
real meaningful control out of
state facilities is different
licensing standards.
These kids are out of state they
don't have is it so short answer
sessions now for thirty no it
would not apply to a grandmother
or an aunt they would have to go
through the normal procedure but
we're really addressing this to
these facilities where those of
us who work in this field all
this been you know there's been
destination really serious thing
that's or trying to avoid thank
you I hope that answers your
question.
Yes madam chair representative I
know we're all due on the floor
soon we have one last response
warranted or requests from
secretaries Gracin CYFD there
they both like to respond to
that question before we
potentially roll this over
decided for going to take action
Madam chair representative would
you like to hear the response to
your question on that language
in paragraph.
Yes okay secretary Scrase and Mr
Festus potentially for the last
time as we're all due on the
floor.
Thank you very much madam chair
members of the committee I'll be
specifically brief but I want to
respond.
Speaker EDOs comment was was the
question I think we're we agree
completely with the plants as we
want the best for New Mexico
children and we believe that
codification of the settlement
agreement is the right thing to
do in our ultimate goal where we
disagree is that
I think the plan is to there are
proposing that we codify
something that has not been
worked out it according to the
settlement agreement with the co
neutrals at our positions we
need to wait until those details
of been worked out and again we
are more than happy and would
love to come back with the bills
that represents everything that
is supposed to transpire that
was outlined in the settlement
agreement that we've already
reached thank you very much.
and see what do for your last go
Mr Festus.
Thank you yeah just very quickly
this discussion you know we've
been talking a lot about
extraordinary circumstances what
does out of state placement and
what is the even that what does
it mean by placement I think
that's they could have a fact
that we have not yet clearly
define those that still work in
progress that we're working with
the Mexico neutrals who are also
collaborating with the
plaintiffs as well so it's
premature again looking forward
to how to find the bill but as
this entire discussion is shown
we have not yet defined clearly
what these commitments and
deliverables our in this section
F. and throughout thank you.
Madam chair I I don't think that
my suggestion for the Santa
Claus really does the trick so I
think we should ask the
committee.
What they're pleasure is with
the US substitute as it it says.
Thank you madam chair we did let
our Republican colleagues let
them know that we reach out when
we're taking actions that will
do that now.
They've stepped into a caucus.
We can see we can see if they re
join us
Madam chair what can

your vote.
Thank you madam chair in us
just.
Okay going to encourage the
sponsors to continue to work
with the state agencies who seem
to be acting in good faith with
limited resources
I think that encouragement still
applies even if the bill doesn't
move forward.

you have interim to to do
exactly the same thanks so
thank you Madam.
It looks like with the end of
our agenda then handing it back
to you.

think we do.
