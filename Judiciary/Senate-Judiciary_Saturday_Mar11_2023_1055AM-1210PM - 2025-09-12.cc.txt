Okay thank you Mr chairman
members of the committee.
Senate Judiciary Committee
substitute for a central for
eighty two correct some of that.
I'm here I do not.
Two passed session.
One two two five seven one roof.
Correct thank you Senator Shendo
successful and we do we have
Richard opposition.
The research support session or
we have no Register supporter
opposition advance of the
meeting so I won't be going to
the audience or anyone on your
bill will go strictly from your
presentation into the committee
seven minutes adequate for you
Senator Shendo so.
Already so what Santo Domingo
eighty two this is a menace to
public school co to create the
state tribal education compact
schools authorizing PED to enter
into a compact with the Indian
tribes nations pueblos holy a
partially in New Mexico to great
language and culture base
The schools.
So
The governing body for the
tribe's I may submit a
resolution to PED to create the
tribal state education compact
school serving any grace between
print card kindergarten and
twelfth grade and PED show could
be the government government
able to Goshen in terms of the
compact with me here is director
of education for portal payments
Kevin Shendo is also happens to
be my brother of as there's a
lot of language programs and and
develop our our our strategy for
early childhood and so for
someone to come over to him to
receive a tell you a little bit
about the the bill and it's a
difference.
Morning chairman members of the
committee one of the opportunity
the HSD tribal education compact
Act actually came of because of
our work with the in the public
payments we have established to
charter schools of tribally
based language and culture based
Kate the line twelve and on
working with our education
systems and also with the real
the fact that not only a miss
but many indigenous communities
and those that come from
heritage languages of our at the
risk of losing our indigenous
and heritage languages in this
country and so looking at the
current school models that are
educating our young people we
begin to look at what steps we
need to take up to bring more
local ownership and tribal
control
Within the education systems
that serve a young people and
those.
Shared we've looked at the
charter school model we met with
the legislative education study
committee all and that that that
as an option of tribes charter
authorizers but what we see with
that option is that
we would still be under the
charter law of the state of New
Mexico and governed by the
public at Department and
likewise within the bureau of
Indian education at the federal
level probably control schools
are similar to try to charter
schools all but again they fall
under the purview of the bureau
of Indian education and those
assessment evaluation system and
ours are determined by others
outside of our tribal
communities and so looking at
the history of education
For tricycles this country
For starters institutions to
kill in the in and save the
child and really to strip us of
our cultural identity language
culture traditions and so.
That's forty now we know that
our education systems here in
the US in New Mexico still are
delivered as in the medium of
instruction using English and so
we want to change that and
really look at the media are
structured in our home languages
on languages and to empower our
own communities to be able to
develop the assessments and
evaluates the standards
for young people to challenge
them academically but also
ensuring that we maintain our
traditional languages and so
looking at that this is a well
the bill came to be thank you.
You.
They also showed up thank you no
it's a list of the questions the
committee or thank.
Committee members of questions.
stirred and Services.
At that rate L. E. S..
This.
We focus on the danger.
Representative we've been
payments we saw these.
that we this is that Senator
right.
And some of the land program
These.
About four.
That translated.
They were also being.
So.
We all in there about how.
That our communities yeah that.
That.
We look at charters to begin
with.
That.
W. secretary part of these.
And he says that they that was
the previous our very first
time.
They had some in Washington
state have started.
And so he recessed this compact
process would be the best way.
This has been by the LA is C..
So.
Forces and really fast.
Representative.
Very much Mr chairman and
right.
Yes so much better committee.
It is not an easy answer that
with.
It up.
That they look at I expect this
will.
Legislative service.
That is that.
The difference between having a
charter school.
And the compact.
Is that charter school.
Is you have a governing body our
schools are schools have solar
finance the state.
You have our.
That's right would have waited
on the line of.
Just try to some control that.
But you still have a third
bases.
That is specific to this.
My understanding here is that
this is the.
Contact between private and
state of the tribal run school
Mr.
And this is generation is that
correct.
Yes yes yes yeah and so.
So that's sort of what that is.
That.
If.
The parents.
And I don't feel like my child's
education is going very well.
I want to do something about it.
that probably I have the option
contributions will have things.
what is your.
Can I take a.
Contacts will be scored in New
Mexico.
Mr Chairman junction.
If the tried tested then you
perhaps.
I think that the state courts of
us tried when they control it
probably would not.
Of.
Wave that jurisdiction.
Let's try this our community.
Correct.
The governing council the
charter school would not have
sovereign immunity.
So I could sue the governing
council the charter school.
District court's Mexico.
I would not be able to sue tribe
is running a school based on
funds the rate for the state of
New Mexico.
We've never had that we've had
our federal head start for
almost twelve years.
With the same conditions in
terms of whether parents want
their children in the fully
immerse at start.
So we've never encountered at
so.
Because there's choices that
parents have we have no charter
school we have a missile the
public school with the be a
school so there's three choices
that parents have not they don't
want their go to Mr chairman
Senator Ivey Soto did on out to
be in a fully language immersion
program additional have the
option of the local B. I. of
screen discover but B. I. E. and
then they have the choice of
going to the public school
system that so it's not like
you're that's the only school
they have options to Mr chairman
and and then there's a
separation I I understand that
parents have a choice.
What what the model of
enforcement of public education
lost.
Is that what you're not happy
little different school.
Some parents do that.
If you're able to.
House what certain things.
So on page.
six.
This sort of life for.
This
schools of your generous
sentiments will be subject to
financial examinations and
audits New Mexico state auditor.
The state auditor doesn't
believe that the opposite
correctly the state auditor.
Six seven eight.
The court to force an audit.
The state once.
They would have sovereign
immunity is that correct.
Of the test Mister chairman
Senator Ivy Soto of the tribal
administrator for six years up
until April the tribe of the
growth as its own other single
audits every year for all of our
federal programs because eighty
ninety percent of our programs
are federally funded including
the head start so we're very
used to the you know here to all
accounting principles both at
the fed and the state level
because we also have state
funding that supports partially
our early childhood programs and
so so I don't see that as a
concern.
Mr chairman and session up.
Most most public bodies to their
on it's just fine.
There was public bodies that's
not a problem.
Where there is a problem the
state auditor has recourse they
were not out of this case.
The dollars that they would have
in every other case because of
this opportunity of the tribe.
We're just our school.
Without excess proceeds are
related with access.
The council that for schools
are at.
That the tribe with all those of
that.
Now I also see on that I.
That we have eight six.
That the school would be that
exempt from all state statutes
and rules how will school
districts.
Senator school boards recovery
faster schools regarding
curriculum.
Assessment.
Evaluation requirements of the
school.
This.
My daughter those chilling
words.
I fully support what you're
trying to get a.
Reserve my family's.
My daughter goes to let.
Is a public school.
That's cool it also language
school.
Even though the earlier grades
over eighty percent of our time
is spent not in English.
They're still subject.
Assessment and evaluation
requirements all of the schools.
This case.
Of all the.
In this.
So basically.
One of the school like any other
school.
But it's not like any of the
school.
The state funding.
This.
The ability for that.
Mr chairman of the Senate do not
have much of.
Attention to respond to
evaluation correct.
The chairman members of the
committee
this is the very reason why we
want to enter into state tribal
compact because as I share
earlier all the research and
evaluations and assessments that
are enforced by the public at
department and the bureau of
Indian education are in the
space English is the medium of
instruction a lot of these
assessments and Spanish also has
systems that have been set and
other languages however in
native languages.
There is not research that
exists to support a lot of the
strategies a lot of these
evaluations assessments and
developing our own standards
especially for languages that
are not right which is in this
case he was.
And so this is one of the
reasons why this is so critical
to enable us to develop those
assessments and evaluations the
standards to be able to ensure
that we're challenging our
children to reach their greatest
potential.
And.
A good example.
The office of head start to
their head start school
immersion.
Begin the purpose of the
nineteen sixties the office of
head start didn't
Allocate any research dollars to
a language other than English
until two thousand six.
And so funds.
Allocated to researchers in
languages other than English and
Spanish is somewhere maybe just
do not exist for tribal
indigenous languages and so that
has always been challenged even
with our charter schools when we
try to introduce different
strategies is it research based
hello this validated.
Where is this to validate what
you're doing and how you're
stuck to your kids is legit.
And so we want to bring that
legitimacy in the validation but
we can't do it when these
decisions are made by those
folks that don't understand how
our languages are set up and the
languages for tribal communities
in New Mexico are the property
of the tribe's and so how do we
make this a win win situation to
ensure that we continue to
strengthen our languages we
create these educational
opportunities for young people.
But.
It has to be looked at the
different way.
Mr Chairman at the no no I I
agree with you completely up I
do.
What I don't see in here is.
Is that.
There will be little as.
Assessment of valuation system
created.
That will approximate.
What happens in the list so that
we can have a valuation.
Violations athletic crossed out.
There's a lot of students in the
schools are doing away the
committee.
For me that's a problem.
So what I hear completely
versatile elevated pool.
Live in your language.
But this doesn't even require.
Establishment of an equivalent
validated tool to be developed.
That's what my problem is on
this.
One last issue.
Right I just wanted to what
what.
They choose to employ licensed
school employees or.
Language proficiency.
The latest revision Louise.
Have to be licensed school
employees in the school.
Representative.
Chairman members of the
committee of the license
The language proficient
employees as you know the
legislature passed a five twenty
licensure to license language
and culture basically structures
to be able to instruct in the
public and charter schools that
is one Avenue the other Avenue
is we partner with the
university of Hawaii at Hilo
with their co of while the
teacher language programs
because they're the only program
in the country that has a
language immersion licensure
program our state institutions
do not to support.
The licensure of that too
referring to so we do have a
state funded grants to enter
into for your partnership with
the university of Hawaii at Hilo
to develop a heinous language
licensure program as a pilot
that can then be used by other
communities in New Mexico to
create licensure programs
Using the university of Hawaii
system on that partnership as a
mall and so that's what has been
invested in by the public at the
part is it has also been further
supported by the early childhood
early care early childhood
department who we've partnered
on the federal grant has been
awarded to be able to expand
this partnership so that other
tribal communities and the state
itself can learn from this
unique partnership in bringing
this licensure program to
fruition and so I share the.
A lot of these investments have
not been made Montoya the Yazzie
Martinez losses.
You know education for Indian
the native children was not a
priority.
And so we're trying to look at
strategies that will enable us
to move education forward and in
terms of assessments licensure
and all these.
Representative Lente has house
bill two eighty that will create
technical assistance centers
that can support in developing
these assessments evaluations
and curriculum because every
tribe is at different stages
develop with their language and
difference that some are more
severe in the revitalization
States some are able to maintain
them at higher levels of fluency
so you also have that spectrum
to work with as well so one size
fits all model will not work in
this particular case the
chairman of medicine of I
understand that.
My concern here is though.
That.
That
Military school without a single
less person.
The state department licensure.
This year we have a single
license person with this.
That's right.
Senator Stewart.
Mr chairman I think Senator is
incorrect you'll get paid I.
Number one into a to a
particular but he thank private
education home section.
In the Floyd license for rural
employees.
For language proficiency boys
language proficient employees we
have determined what will be on
the first level one of the
teacher pay scale because they
are the ones that are teaching
billing for.
So and number three comply with
the license school employee
background check so is it
accurate to say that they don't
have to have anyone who is
license on there they must
employ a licensed school
employees so just wanted to
point that out of the chair you.
Other members of the committee.
There Baca I thank you briefly
on the point we just left I I
disagree I if this thing passes
you know you have an opportunity
here where you would be exempt
and let's face it our schools
are terrible in the state I need
for number fifty one guys can
skate this that's that's
incredible chair you guys can do
some different shows how it
should be done and so then that
would be a model for the rest of
the state so I I you know I I
think this language is great I
like the exemptions like pulling
you out.
Thank you do your own thing a
cat her at this point I'll tell
you that.
Madam chair.
I'm sorry did we have anybody
else.
When it does happen it is a
motion for the past anything
else so I have a few questions
myself Senator just briefly to I
hope will be quick.
The.
The trick for me part comes on
page five a line six where the
the compresses the committee
education compact is exempt from
all state statutes and rules
applicable to school districts
including state chartered local
boards but the Dennis that's why
that's regarding curriculum
assessment evaluation of the
school.
Then it goes on to say except
for those statutes rules made
applicables.
By the act here.
And then Compaq executed so and
and I appreciate the fact that
later on bill.
In section eight there's an
adoption of the open meetings
act right so so the intention
here is to maintain some.
some transparency.
The some of the concerns I have
a really where where I see a lot
a lot of things happening here
in Santa Fe is with regard to
procurement so the the compact
would include the exam to the
schools of the under the compact
would be exempt from procurement
lawsuits that is that right.
Maybe Mr chairman
The only thing that we're asking
to be removed I think in this
bill is regarding curriculum
assessment and evaluation okay
because that's the thing that
the tribe has cooled and then
everything else you know I think
will comply with it.
We're only asking the exemption
from the curriculum assessment
by weeks because that's
something that PED cannot do
yeah and I think.
The probably be some question
about how you interpret the
valuation requirements but but
then Senator every those
whenever the you know you'll
have audits which is I think a
good thing my but when I bring
up procurement at that question
of valuation within the the
financial part of all this
Help me on page six center I
just I don't understand what
this inspections intended to pay
six line twelve says a state
tribal education compact school
shall not engage in sectarian
practices I don't know what that
means and it's only the
educators in the room where
people do more with education
what what is what says they
shall not engage in sectarian
practices what does that mean.
That is a school.
Yes that seems to be an issue
that we go run around within in
our modern society is you know
what's in the text books what's
creation what's what's secretary
wants nonsectarian but I
understand I guess what that
thing which would be about.
this is a gift for my friend to
do more education we're probably
Senator Stewart as much as
anybody page seven funding shall
be determined by the public
school funding formula so that
gonna work Senator Wirth of the
funding of the school as part of
the funding formula.
Chairman they're part of funding
formula now.
That would be a change but
certainly thank you continue to
be part of.
We are.
One one difference I think
federation though is on page
eight the look at subsection
ceases money received.
So for so to the funding formula
remains in the accounts in sep
twenty during subsequent years
always.
There is no no reverting is that
different than the we we find
other schools no that's all the
those are the same.
Questions again education not
being committee that I serve on
several of familiar with so all
those answer my questions anyone
else the committee there's a due
pass motion we forces their
objection to do.
This rooftop with a do not pass

you Mr chairman I would like to
discuss the point seven version
of the a committee substitute.
Okay and as first of all just I
get an understanding of how.
Not
too and it
is up to special education.
Thank.
Thank you very much just before
you start center I'm trying to
get an idea of our time of these
everyone here to be heard in
opposition to the committee
substitute for this bill anyone
here at all in opposition and
I'm not seeing anyone Senator
just so you Senator so you have
an understanding is anyone here
to be heard in support.
Are not seeing that either so
the looks like we'll go from
your presentation then into the
committee questions given the
absence of any public
participation by registered
requests in advance will
recognize you for up to ten
minutes between the two of you
to clean the bill I thank you Mr
we'll try to do it and I so
Senate bill of nineteen was a
culmination of tremendous work
done by various advocates
particularly here in Santa Fe
sos indivisible as Rachel
Feldman who's listening online
and it put together a fantastic
bill to continue with the
modernization and restructuring
of the law enforcement academy
as you recall we created in
statute of last year The New
Mexico law enforcement standards
and training council and the law
enforcement certification board
and brought the Law Enforcement
Academy underneath DPS so with
this substitute takes sections
one three five seven eight
fourteen and fifteen from the of
the original Senate bill
nineteen and basically it takes
the standards and trainings
Council and makes it and
administrative to be attached to
the law enforcement academy so
they can share staff it of
modernizes the law enforcement
standards and training council
board and include a.
And it takes away the regional
directors as accept and make
some ex official members but as
a sheriff and municipal county
law enforcement officer the key
language in the bottom of page
two of that it will provide
training at all levels including
basic field training officer
programs advanced specialize in
instructor training to be
consistent throughout all of New
Mexico.
section three deals with the
board and the
And continues to modernize the
the board which will come online
July first and adds a criminal
justice professor at an at large
person on the middle of page
seven section for deals with the
sheriff's training that they are
eligible to attend the academy
section I Mr chairman on Page
ten deals with law enforcement
accountability piece
that failure to report or
failure to do
in service training may result
in the state withholding law
enforcement protection funding
from your agency.
the new material on top of page
twelve is key Mr chairman that's
the police cops our database
that we so desperately need that
was right that was a in the
original Senate bill three
seventy five from couple years
ago but did not make it in the
house bill sixty eight what this
bill does also is bringing the
tele communicators Mr chairman
members brings them into the law
law enforcement family by
updating it the statutory
construction with regards to it
and brings tele communicators on
the two boards that I mentioned
and also changes the language in
the distribution of the law
enforcement protection fund on
the bottom of page fifteen to
are accountability piece to the
training and the in service
training so it's not it's not
what everybody wanted it's not
tremendous reach but I'm of the
opinion that that statutorily
and administrative to really and
and legislatively we need to all
move forward together there's no
point in having Legisla-
statutory construction that that
institutions cannot fulfill and
there's tremendous obligations
and duties on the law
enforcement academy already from
the law passed last year which
as we all know doesn't go into
effect on July first of this
will go into effect simultaneous
with that statutory construction
and move us continuously forward
so that we have the best trained
in the best equipped law
enforcement officers in the
country with that often over the
Senator pope.
Mr Chairman committee members we
all want to policing we all want
policing that lives up to our
highest values of fairness
equality and justice public
safety passing this bill will
allow us to take one step closer
with the vast majority of New
Mexicos want.
Please the police force that
keeps committees at the same
time safe but also prioritizing
the escalation before you can
potentially deadly force some of
the provisions from Senate bill
two fifty two that have been
implemented into the substitute
our duty to intervene which is
something that we both that
something that both law
enforcement and civil rights
advocates support.
We're also picking up with
the database that was
the prior prior prior
legislation that we didn't get
through
and that has been included in
this bill as well.
We also have.
I.
Space.
But the main the main just of
this what's been put in the bill
is a user for standards that a
statewide and I think that's the
most important part of this
being implemented here once
again this is not
Everything that was included in
Senate bill two fifty two but I
think this strikes a balance and
it really moves us a step
forward and what we want to do
in our state the closing I just
want to say that
you know law enforcement so
tough job but I think clarity in
our standards will keep everyone
safe including our communities
but also our law enforcement
with that Mr Chairman that's all
we have.
Members the committee questions
Senator.
Thank you Mr chair I'm looking
at page nine.
lines ten and eleven forces
secretary of public safety
should be the final arbiter of
any appeal from a decision by
the board who is that so the
final arbiter now without this
language I'm assuming folks
would have be able to go to the
court.
Mr Chairman they're doing no
that's correct and and this does
not preclude the court I think
the context is the final arbiter
within that department currently
the board would make the final
decision and then it would go to
court.
All right then Mr chair Senator
I think it should say that
because I think this could be
read to mean that folks can go
to court
that he is the final arbiter
and and that would reduce so I
think that.
Senator I don't know you know
the year built better than I do
if you have proposed language
that would clarify that but I I
think if that is the intention
and then the roof the language
should reflect that.
Mister chairman Senator do it no
I agree I was just I was
actually reading students that
are struggling with this as we
are waiting for the that's where
the Senate Center shin does.
Presentation to and this was
language that was of those
brought to us.
By the musically and I'm just
trying to of course with that
now we could say
The secretary of public safety
Shelby the
The next level of appeal from a
decision by the board.
And I think provided that.
That some they were saying that
someone can still appeal to work
after that level yield so I mean
I'm I'm I'm less that lets the
intention here is that that no
one can can appeal to to
District Court for where these
decisions I I think we should
say that would you be
promotional so thinking about
breast center doing to you this
this language I think you
probably find some better
languages elsewhere the statute
doesn't seem it doesn't seem to
make sense for me because the
point Senator is making this
subparagraph Tecate the
secretaries the final arbiter of
a decision for.
but then the next for
Representative says the decision
of the board.
Internal affairs investigation
documents this is of course a
final agency action so the the
the paragraph Mrs of the program
may suggest that the this the
board is no decision was
appealed to the secretary of the
secretary's the final decision
which kind of the office of the
way we usually do things you
know usually don't have a single
individual.
being the arbiter of a decision
the board to the board who
oversees the the decision of the
directors so.
We we do this throughout our
statues a construction industry
is the one I am familiar with
private decision of the.
Division director of the
secretaries that appeal to a
board as opposed to the board
decision being appealed to the
secretary.
And then and then that that
language in person says a
decision of course the final
action which again makes sense
because you've already said that
the century the secretary is the
final action and then this as
this maybe yield pursuant to
that section at thirty nine
three one point once commonly
used to refer to District Court
of appeal right so that's that's
a District Court bill that's
specified by statute so so then
this is the board the final
action and that more attention
maybe feel but the preceding
paragraph says the secretary is
the files are because of the
those programs to me.
Some Mrs so back going to do it
but I I shared some of the same
concerns and this seems to be
different than we do everything
else I think sure but and and I
think that I think what I'm
gonna suggest just striking that
K. just striking lines ten and
eleven on page nine.
This after the motion that I
make is to reserve a spot in the
center do so those are that's a
great catch us paragraph L. is
consistent with what is
happening now.
And and and and makes way more
sense section K. was not in the
original Senate bill nineteen.
setting section K. contradicts
is the contradictory P. so we
would consider that a friendly
amendment.
Senator promotion my mission is
on page nine striking lines ten
and eleven and then re lettering
on our on line twelve striking
L. and inserting in the there of
K. friendly.
Hello to friendly service with
us on that amendment somehow.
Thank you Mr thank you on that
amendment that I see the
secretary in the back and I
really would appreciate his
thoughts on on this particular
issue since he is specifically
mentioned in section K. I want
to know what the secretaries
logic on this was it was as
logic and what is so would be
alright with you Mr chair with
us about.
Thank you secretary could be of
use in the thank you
sit down yes please Sir Senator
Moores I have seen the the
system to the please the concern
was in this particular case
there wasn't another level of
arbitration right courses
orders where this meeting came
from I think it's very important
to understand the current
process and I think W. secretary
Baker panels all these cases are
currently problems with the
current that we find Mr chair
some lights to of or tried to
call the some of the.
Future like to hear from W.
secretary.
Most fantastic.
Mr Mr chair members the
committee Center thanks for the
question yes so one of the
things contemplated within this
new statutory language is the
certification board
contemplating denial revocation
suspension I think most folks
think about what happens on the
second half we're talking about
disciplining already licensed
folks the denial piece has to do
with the qualification for
admission and so the ingress is
the entirety of the population
of folks applying to become
licensed as either police
officers or public safety tell
communicators in New Mexico so
the importance here is that the
current construct with the New
Mexico Law Enforcement Academy
board handles both if a person
is denied administratively right
now me and my staff are the ones
that make that decision as
director.
If there is an appellate issue
raised by the applicant it goes
to the board as as we described
earlier by this this committee
then if that if the board
agrees with the decision made
below them bye bye my staff and
me then that person's remedy is
the District Court as I think is
normative.
The denial portion of this for
the certification board will
account for hundreds of
applications over the variety of
things the ingress of that can
be corrected within rule to
empower the executive director
of the certification board to be
a administrative
administratively the one
applying those rules to me kind
of what is happening now and
therefore the appellate rate
would then go to District Court
as has been suggested in the
amendment I think the difference
was the volume of particularly
denials but of any matter where
there's due process issue
related to certification now
what would have this very
contracted to process fees and
we're pretty worried about what
that volume looks like in terms
of being able to the board will
still have to defend that action
whether it goes to court or
whether it goes to another
arbiter the amendment Moores
senator on the amendment Mr
chair Senator so.
K. was team from there from the
sponsor and we're not we don't
necessarily ask the.
The administration of US from
there now but would you would
you consider it more moving that
it sounds like it would be a
huge administrative very.
We care.
Four are you right now stick to
that
Mr chair I I guess the issues
really is is that a server issue
with removing it is is that of
currently the board is going to
the side in the televises
alternatives District Court now
there's no stepping between us
we're trying to side with at
seven twenty should be set of
every appeal every novel going
to District Court shares our
staff and our internet the
person would still have the
ability to go to our discord
between the stuff there's
nothing to prevent that right.
For are going to support Mr
chair Senator board rate on a
thirty five percent.
Right there's nothing that
prevents the right.
Register thank you things that
of course the amendment does
precisely what they say they're
doing it precisely where all
other.
Agencies work you have to have a
decision made by the director in
the directors yield to the board
member the board's appeal to the
District Court that's the way it
works in every other part of
government the difficulty is
that paragraph basis the
secretary is the final arbiter
of an appeal of a decision by
the board this is within the
language in your bill's refers
to the way everybody does it and
and reverse the way you just
described so the amendment would
accomplish really with what you
all are doing already so back to
Senate do about the motion.
That's that's an all right in my
motion noticed any other
discussion of the proposed
amendment.
Is there any objection adoption
amendment from senator Morris
and serve option of the proposed
center every so those two were
doing serve Andi's worth in
support that commitment is
adopted Senator use of the for
the thank you Mr chair so I'm
looking at page seventeen line
fifteen.
Thank you for at age seventeen
line fifteen.
And.
The issue here Mr chair is the
word immediately this is saying
that the if a law enforcement
officers found to have used
unlawful physical force officer
shall be immediately
disciplined.
Of my understanding is that
even if there's been a
determination of unlawful force
employers still are going to
have a due process mechanisms
that they're gonna have to go
through before they can turn a
terminate and I see that on
page.
eighteen that immediate language
was not included for
intervention about.
being disciplined and so I.
Well I think we want to make
sure that people are violating
use of force that they do get
disciplined we also want to make
sure that we're not forcing
employers to violate due process
in doing so so I would propose
regular immediately on page
seventeen line two.
The friendly Mr chairman the
suffer motion services can we
just calm down everybody.
Right so from the moment all
right Senator you've got your
you've got the floor right now
on the proposed amendment
services which we recognized.
Senator Ivey Soto on them just
just just whether or not.
For further
for the district.
For the phrase out there.
So that are the.
This time the officers on this
but.
And.
It would be disciplinary
proceedings shall commence you.
Mr was I supposed to.
Those are just all trying to get
one of the.
So there's a there's a motion
before us district were
immediately invested sponsor the
amendment to reconsider the
amendment so Sen Representative
is that where you're at right
now that's pharmacist questions
once the member which is a
preferred I know back to Senator
don't even Mr chair I think I'll
stick with my original.
The discussion so more than
even than committee on the
members charters generate for
your phone
those are Sanchez.
Thank you Mr additionally.
Mr Mr members of the committee I
I agree with with that I don't
have any objections the
amendment at the I believe the
officer should have a due
process thank you.
Yes
so I understand the amendments
probably a good idea frankly I'd
ask the committee to help
persuade me that we do anything
in section thirteen at all.
Of the preceding section twelve
describes what is on lawful use
of force I think that's a good
thing section thirteen says of
somebody's unlawful force there
should be discipline
even restrict the word
immediately seems pretty evident
to me that if somebody violates
the statute there should be this
for do we really have to say in
statute there should be
discipline and then we going to
say in the depending on the
seriousness that maybe this
commission to review
commissioned or terminated or
suspended or revoked we really
have to say that to me do we
really have to tell you all what
your options are as
administrators when somebody
violates the state statute do we
really have to tell you that the
person may be suspended really
have tell you they may be
revoked really have to even be
terminated do we really have to
tell you
what is language like depending
on the seriousness.
Maybe this committee commission
all all of that to me seems
pretty self evident I don't know
that with the statute tell you
can do all these things the when
somebody.
Engages in unlawful use of force
I would strike the entire to
section thirteen but I know
that's not the motion before the
committee right now but again
I'm I'm always looking for
getting rid of the language this
meeting with our state statutes
or or non purposeful we could
say this sends a message and I
understand that's the argument
that we made all the sense of
message that if somebody does
this you can be terminated.
Nope you okay right.
It's pretty self evident to me
that way we're on that proposed
amendments are due to some else
well just that at all all
Committee amendment as it is I I
don't I do think we might need
section thirteen in their
overall
Because I'm just thinking like
Fund I part of the police you
I'm gonna argue if that's not in
there there is no statutory
requirement for penalties or the
penalty should be limited to
whatever our.
Our.
Agreement in place is and this
would supersede that.
And I don't know beans about
placing aunts so peacefully off
base here but I I could.
Occur see if that might be one
reason why we do need to keep
that section and overall but for
for now all.
I'll I'll go ahead and and stick
with that motion.
The other discussions were on
that that's the motion before
striking the word immediately
Sir any objections to doing
that.
I see none shows so Ivey Soto
Stuart two eight serve on this
Wirth Bach Moores in support of
that amendment etcetera do you
still have for them that's all I
have Mister chair New Mexico
Center about the.
I thank you Mr chair
I tend to agree with you Mr
chair that section thirteen
really has everything that they
would do anyway and if if it be
in order Mr chair and sponsor
I'd like to hear from the
secretary to the if you would
look at section thirteen and I
would ask you are all those
available to you anyway and
therefore.
This is a section necessary can
you do all this stuff anyway.
Mr chair Senator Baca these
observable for a not only policy
violations with any violations
New Mexico state statutes so
it's not just specific to a
lawful physical forces and
officers found to have committed
any violations of in by the New
Mexico state statute Mr means
included we could remove and
terminate the employee depending
on the severity of it
of the offense and so I can
agree with Senator month is in
these are all options available
if we had right now an officers
involved in state another to a
different type of a
Criminal act of some sorts
felony offense we would start
administrative investigation
we've course we have a criminal
investigation of the exact same
time both of those the
medication would be in the
pandemic which other an ongoing
we make a determination of the
administrative investigation
after the officers of the bill
of rights would kick in and and
compelled statements river
provided by proponents of the
evidence of the officer would
violate these and we would at
which is a lower standard of
course of the conversation so by
proponents of the evidence if
the officers found that he had
committed any these violations
we would then have the options
available to us couldn't hear
either to decommission terminate
the New Mexico Law Enforcement
Academy board that would have
the option to then also through
the Ellie a ninety to decide
whether to spend a revoke and
and Mr chair and and thank you
for that answers the secretary
of defense did I say did I hear
you say that Mr these are
available to you even with
misdemeanors some of these I
mean obviously we're talking
about unlawful physical force in
this particular case but yeah
you can you can terminate an
officer and and decommission for
misdemeanor offenses and like
the W. comes to mind that's a
misdemeanor offense and and we
terminate officer for the kind
of thing all the time so
depending on the violation of
depending on the graciousness
thank you depending on the
how reflect negatively upon the
agency certainly we terminate
obviously officers for just
policy violations alone it
doesn't need to be a crime if
you have continue would
continues correct corrective
action for employee continues
policy violations we terminate
for that for that reason as
well.
Mr chair I I of a a you know I
tend to agree with that with you
on this section thirteen
if if you want to move to strike
section thirteen that be fine
otherwise I'll do so now that is
a motion from Houston about the
but for right now so.
we persuaded you Senators
section thirteen doesn't really
do anything.
Thank you up the court we go
first thank you Mr chairman
thank you center market think
of.
The state audible secretary has
jurisdiction over the state
police.
Is over a hundred twenty police
agencies in the state sixty five
are ten officers or less
we have to put we had to put in
a in in three seven five Mr
chairman and in house bill sixty
eight we will withhold law
enforcement protection funds if
you don't do this because.
because for the law enforcement
academy board to adjudicate of
misconduct allegation that
misconduct allegation has to be
made stay with me on the motion
and so and so.
So my point is with all due
respect.
The profession needs.
The knowledge in my opinion to.
To enforce misconduct
allegations and and so that's
why it's underneath.
For you anyone else on the
proposed amendment the other
discussion.
Yeah the respects and all all
content of of of of of agree
with the striking section
thirteen I hi I just read your
members we we need to send a
message and you all know about
my hallmark cards attitude
toward the session you know so
you know we can send lots of
messages sent me an email put
something on Instagram but in
the statutes I think we ought to
put things into law and the
secretary said all of these
things are already part of his
authority already part of this
procedure so to tell folks that
we can do things you already can
do the incident seems pointless
but center you have a point
chairman.
I agree with etcetera my Estes
but for me I I just a little
more than a message we're we're
trying to send
This out that this is at the
statewide Senate we want to
happen throughout all agencies
respectfully with the unfriendly
as well thank you but I first.
Do.
Mr chair and services at the
moment is the what's the point
you're making was that the
secretary secretary you.
What you're doing is identified
everyone is that correct like
the other long for that there
will be other law enforcement
officers in the state who are
going to be covered by what the
secretaries to sincerely is that
correct Mr terms are doing if if
the allegation is serious enough
it will end up on the law
enforcement certification boards
places speak but we want as as
part of this bill is
His intervention piece of the
the.
We want policing in the state to
be more of an intervention
intervention
police department my hometown
which did not hold each other
accountable and is under
contenders taken over a decade
to move on and institution
institutional change is very
very difficult I believe that
this language will help with
that institutional change.
Mr chair Senator because if we
take out thirteen that I bet
will take out subsection C.
under intervention.
Saying that if you don't enter
where it says he didn't
intervene you'll be disciplined
and I think we have a two
competing Senator serve on
systems going on here because
you say we don't want to send a
message something that we want
to hallmark moments but also if
our laws don't have consequences
in the Armenian costs and to me
this language as that this makes
clear that there are
consequences therefore it's not
a meaningless Law.
So.
I don't know if I'm presented by
Senator Sanchez is point number
one or number two.
But but I.
That's all I have Mister chair I
appreciate and I guess that
that's a question for me as much
as anything else too but again
you're right I'm always looking
for consequences that I think
the secretaries are so that we
make something unlawful the
secretary's gonna act on
unlawful conduct within the
parameters of what you've
already got.
I don't I don't know that you
always have to specify the
consequence additional no there
is a consequence and in some of
these lots of it would be the
probably exhausted the issue too
so the motion is at its center
Baca strike section thirteen
this to us roll call this may be
Senator by yes.
Senator I know that.
Senator Moores yes.
Senator Stewart no.
Senator Wirth no.
Senator do that.
Senator movies yes of the motion
fails Senator Baca survivors of
the for.
Well.
Mr chair scene is how we kept
that in then let's move on to
section see do we really need
sections you would be my next
question law enforcement officer
who had a duty to intervene and
fail to do so so we disciplined
and depending on the seriousness
Committee suspended the
dissatisfied Commission were
terminated from the officer's
position so isn't that redundant
now to section thirteen.
Mister chair Mister chairman
Senator Baca it did not quite
because section thirteen deals
with unlawful physical force and
and section see from fourteen
Deals with
The on the.
Kind of the the the the officer
that witnesses it is so so and
and so I I
thank you for the distinction I
I really have a problem with
that you know and in law and in
the.
Really the U. S. to across
across many laws we we don't
have a duty to intervene.
I mean if you if understand that
a law enforcement officer is
there and they should do the
right thing but you know I I see
that
we put them in a position where
we're Monday morning quarter
backing these guys that were
things are happening within
seconds in instances and if for
some reason they should have
intervened agency is if there's
a there's just so much it can
happen so this kind of loss like
really they really bother me
because we're not we we turn on
the television we see these
things that happen in their
horrific you know they're
they're terrible but I wasn't
there you know I and I have to
trust that the officers that are
they're doing the right thing I
I just feel like this is another
yield that we're putting on
officer we renew remove
qualified immunity and now they
have a duty to intervene so
we're adding a.
Where where and and I don't know
what standard maybe you could
tell me what standard this is
judged upon how do we know when
they have crossed that bar to
where they should have
intervened
Mr chairman and senator can you
tell me what that places where
when does at this point should
that officer know they should
intervene.
Mister chairman Senator you know
right up the bat I can't tell
you what that minus I know that
you're right sometimes it feels
like that Monday morning
quarterback.
But we've seen instances on
video for we know someone should
interview.
Maybe there somewhere is
questionable where when it was
happening live in in the
situation we could probably all
put ourselves in this situation
the state what what I've done.
But I think the language in here
allows folks to look at that and
investigate that and say.
What would.
The person in that situation do
what when they were supposed to
step in and do the right thing
and I think we know what that is
I I can't spell that out and
give you a definition of that
but it's just like we know what
right and wrong is and we've
seen this.
We've seen we've seen this
what's happened
around the world and in our
country and so I I just think
this is something important I
think this is something that our
communities that community is
asking for and once again I
understand that this is a tough
job.
Very tough job and I've never
served as a law enforcement
officer but you know serving in
the military we both know about
that these are life and death
situations but I believe this is
a standard that we should expect
from our officers even though it
is a tough stand.
Thank you Mr chairman center R.
thank you and thank you Mr
chairman thank you senator for
for your response I you know I I
think like when we and we'll go
back to the television simple Mr
chair Senator we see it on TV
this is the other thing that
happened wrong that's why we're
watching it on TV and for those
instances Mister chairman
Senator I I I would guess
there're hundreds maybe even
thousands of times were happened
right that we never hear about
where is officer chose to do the
right thing and and so that
coupled with the fact that we
don't have a clear for as to
when they should have intervened
and what that process is I I
feel like there's a gray area
there and and so having to the
determination and then requiring
that they be disciplined and and
and this stuff I get all that
and I I want to propose an
amendment to you that I still
think accomplishes what you what
you want that highs on that
investigation and that option by
the agency to step in and the
investigators ago listen that
was wrong
We need to we need to do some
about that but but this is
really prescriptive and so I
think it doesn't offer some
flexibility there so I would
offer this I would offer M. P.
team online tend to instead of
the word shall we we turn that
into the word may and we strike
that and now they still have the
investigation the the if they
fail to intervene and and now
they may be disciplined based on
that and that allow some
flexibility input you know what
you just described as what is
that bar where are the on that
spectrum I'm sure they have
jumped in or not job during this
is really serious or is it not
so serious or or you know maybe
they overlook something there
you know and I think it gives
agency that that flexibility in
our I'd like to know your
thoughts on the amendment such
as that.
So Mr chair Senator Baca
I guess to go back to the
question we're talking about
what the bar is.
I think for me.
What the bar is on that is the
use of.
Deadlier physical force that's
really unwarranted really what
we're trying to do here with the
use of force standard so.
If you are that officer that a
C. agency and you don't
intervene in.
when another officer is doing
something that would be the same
standard as an officer with
using that force that crosses
the line and so.
I don't think we would want to
put may I think that's what the
line would be and so we should I
I think we should keep that show
their.
Thank you thank you Mr chair and
senator I was a I I I I hear
your point so there's really two
determinations being made
there's a determination on one
hand of the officer who's
witnessing something that maybe
a fell so yes to make one
determination and then there's a
second determination made upon
that officer by another group of
folks later later looking at him
whether him viewing that should
determine that should've
intervened and so it's a it's
actually like it's twice removed
so I appreciate your response I
I think I'm gonna go ahead and
move them and then and we'll see
where it goes from there love to
hear some opinion from the
remainder of the committee here
but so on section see page
eighteen line ten I would strike
shell and in their of insert
may.
And I so with that amendment Mr
chair one more time page one
page eighteen line ten striking
shell in their.
Discussion Senator Stewart
Senator doing.
So first of all I guess I should
just Sanchez.
Chair Senators that would be
from from from Senator and then
they they also that's what I
want so thank
you Senator Moores Senator Wirth
Mr chair.
All up to date with more
support.
I'm sorry first yes doing.
We're.
Mr chair something came back to
when we have.
Educational hearing on this
issue and I recall all the law
enforcement officers speaking in
favor of a duty center really
supportive of that
And I think that changing that
standard that.
So the then we're gonna have a
clearly a different standard for
penalties under for use of force
percent intervention.
That's I think very likely to be
read.
As in making that the penalty is
for intervention be kind of
meaningless I I I I I think that
has to be a shock.
Or else it's never going to
really be a meaningful.
Permission
that's all I have Mister
Moore's.
Thanks security benefits are
sponsor look here from the yes
some of the the law enforcement
folks for their respective.
Thank you Mr chair Senator
Moores Hey can I agree Center do
the we know we I think we
definitely are on the same page
that officers have a duty to
interview right I think of that
is the standard that we all
agree on and I certainly have
not wavering on any of that.
I think we talk about this the
intervention the.
Which we think will use of force
a lot of times we start thinking
about the success of things that
we see on TV and excessive use
of force K. may not always be of
the four horrific beatings and
see sometimes and also right
deployed a taser and situation
where we might expect him to go
hands on instead of maybe a
little bit preemptive and if you
if you're in that situation we
have a fellow officer standing
next to that person in the sense
that would be considered
excessive force in the sense
that maybe the publication only
should have but I also have very
little moments sometimes decide
words intervene with that
percentage good happens there
may be some sort of sense in a
lower lower levels use of force
words not just as clear cut as
what we typically see on TV so I
can see that some sort of that
are going to be a disappointing
those officers who were on scene
who may not even realize
understood the full details of
the case they may arrive moments
later after the call at a rate
of cultures are taking place
apple remorse so we lost track
of.
Good very important we hear.
Officers we're going to give us
the knowledge that I'm looking
for direct answers to request
service for.
If you would like the
flexibility is one from the
municipal.
And they also Moores.
There were there was.
Thank you Mr chair so I just I I
you got to read the rest of the
the sentence because I think the
flexibility is depending on the
seriousness then there's a may
which provides the flexibility
for the discipline and so when I
read having to shell out front
there is flexibility with the
NMAA and it depending on what
happens he set the standard
there's going to be it's a
violation but then there's
flexibility there system again I
think it needs to show.
Representative.
Thank you Mr chairman many years
ago.
When I was living in southern
California and types of friends.
It was a chef.
Search.
And
when rubbishing situation
happened.
We have a conversation.
About.
This Madam was that as a
sergeant.
At the end of the chase.
His primary job.
Was to pull his guys off
legislation.
So we got guys with a lot of the
drug.
This this is responsibility.
He saw that duty generate.
I have you know the problem.
The problem is always worth it
situations that happened.
Very few of them is the also
allow.
Almost all that we got a bunch
of other officers standing
around watching.
What about the amendment
etcetera it is to be shall thank
you.
Anything else who else.
you all know my opinion what we
say more shall is meaningless at
this point time we should be
honest about things we're doing
here when they're meaningless to
meaningless Center were just put
out a pretty shallow then maybe
the same thing so you shall may
do something means that it's
meaningless and so it's like the
last one to will send a message
and I'm going to support them
the language saying I shall you
shall do something that you may
do so okay data dot org we're on
the proposed amendment to change
shall to may on page eighteen
line ten so roll call on that
please Senator Baca yes.
Senator Ivey Soto.
Senator yes.
Senator Stewart Senator would
help Senator do that.
Senator know that amendment bill
center about the so for those of
us thank you Mr chair of moving
on to section fifteen temporary
provision rules New Mexico law
enforcement is Mister chair I
guess my question would be
Senators isn't this what happens
already rules of the New Mexico
Law Enforcement
Academy show Shelby continue
being in effect until amended or
repealed by New Mexico law
enforcement standards and
training council for law
enforcement certification board
as applicable is that what
happens right now thank you Mr
chairman Senator Baca yes.
Under the circumstances a very
peculiar because we created a
new certification board we
created up to new boards that go
online July first that don't
currently don't have rules so
the the needs of the law
enforcement academy will kind of
stay in place until then the law
enforcement academy as as as it
created the rules will no longer
exist on July first so this is a
key component I believe to the
transition.
Okay that's all I have thank you
you anyone else.
So you go to to pass pass
through we've made in Minnesota
this bill my right so we're
gonna have a new committee yeah
so we'll have to do a point the
version of the sub centres I'm
gonna try to work with our staff
to get that done anyone else in
the committee I just like I
don't know if you're pressed we
also provided a couple real
quick remarks this is a
continuation of except
extraordinary work we did last
session and I think it's so
important for the legislature to
take recognition and credit for
the work of this committee which
really put together the omnibus
bill and started as down the
road the new relationship
between law enforcement the
public at large which is a
little bit less of us versus
them and a lot more of us
together and so this is a really
continuation of really good
direction and I I know you all
have worked really hard of
seeing you working hard last
couple days I want to thank the
judiciary staff you all don't we
don't you'll know how much work
goes on in that office with some
extraordinary lawyers and but
you the two of you now know and
I see my colleagues not in their
heads but I you know I want to
thank all of you for working
with those good lawyers and and
this committee give you the time
we take a lot of time and I
think it's something that we've
