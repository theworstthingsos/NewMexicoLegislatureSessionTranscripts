Here.
Representative Hockman B. Hill.
Representative Martinez.
Speaker Martinez.
Representative McQueen.
Representative Reeb.
Leader Sapansky.
Madame Vice Chair Romero here.
Madam Chair
Here
Madam Chair, you have a quorum.
OK, very good.
We'll do our first bill, House
Bill 127, license plate reader's
funding, and we have
representative Chatfield here to
present.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee.
Thank you for having me here.
Thank you for hearing this bill.
You know, uh.
During the interim last year.
We went down to the border.
And uh
We, we toured all along the
border.
In the Texas all across New
Mexico had several stops there
we went down to the.
To the main border patrol
station and we talked to law
enforcement all along the
border.
And they told us that one of
their greatest.
Um, tools in fighting crime
there along the border was
license plates readers because
they're able to.
Hell where all these narcos in
the various different people
from the drug organizations they
passed by they can see where
they're at.
So then this year,
Uh, there were 5 kids, uh,
kidnapped in Texas.
And they picked him up on a
license plate reader right there
along the border and they freed
them.
And uh so.
The, this is a wonderful tool.
It helps, uh.
Stop the flow of drugs.
It helps.
Prevent criminals, uh.
Going across our state.
And, uh, you know, if you, if
you're not doing anything wrong.
You don't care if anybody knows
where you're at, right?
So I have a
Expert witness of chair, uh,
with your permission, I'd let,
let them talk about what license
plates reader do for us.
Thank you, Representative.
Thank you, Madam Chairman,
committee members, uh, Captain
Clay Gore with the New Mexico
State Police, um.
Innovation Bureau we currently
oversee the.
LPR program for New Mexico State
Police as I'm, as I'm sure
you're aware, uh, we've been
funded the last few years for uh
LPR technology.
It's proven, uh, uh.
Uh
Very useful technology tool for
New Mexico State Police, um, we
have multiple success stories
related to the use of LPR, uh,
as, uh, Representative Chatfield
mentioned, you know, this spans
the gamut from uh.
Uh
Helping children who were.
taken in by
No custodial
person and uh.
Because of the LPR we very
quickly realized.
They were in that location we
were able to to make them safe.
We've also uh.
You know, for stolen vehicles,
it is absolutely a game changer.
Mexico clearly has a problem
with auto theft, um.
LPR readers, uh.
make a game changer for auto
theft we are able to.
Uh
get alerts
When a stolen vehicle passes one
of these sites.
And, uh, you know, we can take
law enforcement action on that
rather than that vehicle.
Buried
The middle of
The rest of the motoring public
so it makes law enforcement very
efficient.
Very precise in the targeting uh
of the of uh.
Criminal problems in the state
of New Mexico.
Thank, thank you, Captain. Is,
is that it? Um, and we can go to
the audience unless there's any
addition from you.
So
OK, madam chair, uh, just, it's
a million dollars, uh, license
plates readers are fairly
expensive and uh it'll get us we
have some in our state now, uh,
functioning quite well. It is
just add a little bit to that
and help keep us all safer.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
You're welcome. So, um, let's go
to the audience, those wishing
to speak in opposition,
opposition.
Um, I don't see anyone in the
audience in opposition, anyone
online.
OK
So, those in the audience
wishing to speak in support, if
you could keep it to a minute
and a half, I'd appreciate it.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Carolyn Wynn with
Mexico State Police. We stand in
support of this bill, and it's
important to remember that um
this program has been funded in
the past several years, and we
are just hoping that you
continue to do so. It allows for
efficient use of limited law
enforcement resources that we
currently have, and it increases
our ability to enforce the law.
Um, just as, um, Representative
Chatfield mentioned earlier
there there is a couple success
stories that I wanted to
mention, specifically the 5 kids
from Texas that were kidnapped,
they were picked up by a license
plate reader going through
Lordsburg Demming area, and they
were successfully, um, brought
into custody. Also just as
Captain Gord mentioned that we
have one of the highest rates of
auto theft, and this is a
valuable resource for our
officers. Thank you. Thank you.
wishing to speak in support, you
could keep it to 90 seconds, um,
thank you. Uh, any
Anyone online wishing to speak
in support.
OK, um.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
Uh, Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is Enrique
Nell and I'm here representing
the greater Albuquerque Chamber
of Commerce and strong support
of House Bill 127, um, as others
have mentioned, the license
plate readers are tools in New
Mexico law enforcement has
already used successfully to
help keep us much safer with
this tool, police have been able
to track stolen cars, locate
missing people, and even solve
homicides. For example, last
November, a bicyclist was struck
and killed by a hit and
runn driver near Deming, New
Mexico, a license plate reader
identified that vehicle after
the driver fled to Mexico
through the Columbus port of
entry. He was quickly caught and
arrested and returned to the US
for prosecution. Of course,
others have already mentioned
the five children kidnapped in
Texas, again found because of
the license plate readers. The
chamber advocates for policies
that make it harder to be a
criminal in New Mexico. And this
enhanced crime fighting
technology makes all the
difference.
We ask that you please help us
keep our families and our
businesses safer. We commend and
thank Representative Chatfield
for carrying this bill, and we
respectfully request they do
pass for House Bill 127. Thank
you.
Thank you.
Anyone else wishing to speak in
support of the bill.
Please raise your hand.
OK, I don't see anyone else
raising their hand online. Go
back to Representative
Chatfield, anything you'd like
to add before we go, OK.
All right, any committee
members, uh?
Speaker Martinez, thank you,
Madam Chair, and good to see
you, Chatfield and thank you
officers for being here. Uh,
great idea, great concept. I do
have a couple of questions
regarding the data. So as you
collect that data, where is it
stored? How is it stored, and is
it shared with uh others.
The Federal government is shared
with private companies. Can you
elaborate a little bit on that?
I'd like to defer to my expert
witness.
Madam Chair, uh, community
members, uh, Speaker Martinez,
so, uh.
Data is ingested into the system
from the license plate readers.
We do share with uh
approximately 528 law
enforcement agencies across the
United States, uh, that does
include some federal agencies
such as FBI and DEA.
the
Uh
We do not share, uh, nor is it
uh permissible to share with uh
commercial entities.
Or or private companies, it is a
law enforcement only database.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um.
And sir, um, we, we already have
license plate readers, you
already have license plate
readers, you're already doing
this. This is just to expand.
The reach
I guess you could say, right?
Yes, ma'am Chair, Mr. Speaker.
So
So again, Madam Chair, I think
this is a good idea. Um, I did,
um,
I did a fly by with Albuquerque
Police Department, one of their
helicopters, and while we were
up in the air.
Um, a license plate reader on a
particular intersection flagged
the stolen vehicle.
We actually.
Chased the stolen vehicle down.
Um, so it works, and I think it
gives tools to law enforcement
to sometimes even minimize that
potentially.
Lethal
Contact. The one concern I have,
and I think there's another bill
or other bills out there
regarding data sharing. I, I am,
I am concerned that.
With a federal administration
that seems a bit um erratic that
by sharing data, it's
necessarily, it's not
necessarily used.
For the right reasons for the
right purposes, and they could
somehow be weaponized. Uh, but I
certainly want to, wouldn't want
to let that get in the way of
this because I think that there
is other legislation that will,
um,
Uh, that will ensure that that
doesn't happen. So I'll leave it
at that. Thank you, madam chair.
Thank you. Ipresentative Hall
and then Representative McQueen.
Madam Chair, Representative,
experts, um,
Being retired law enforcement,
this is a phenomenal.
Expenditure in the sense of what
we get bang for the buck.
Um
And according to my notes here,
we're looking at we, you're
looking at expanding.
20 adding, pardon me, 24.
More of these.
Throughout the state.
If you could address that and
then if you would just address
how you share. I know in my
prior career, we had come to the
New Mexico State Police on
kidnappings and other.
Other matters but maybe just
briefly share if you would,
Madam Chair, thank you.
Madam Chair, I'll defer to my
expert witness.
Madam Chair, uh, committee
members, uh, Representative
Hall, so, uh.
The, the, the question about
sharing.
uh, the way the she the sheriffs
work is an agency can request
that we shared data with them.
And uh there's an MOU in place
that says, you know, uh,
permissible use of this, it,
it's, uh, you know, it basically
says it has to be for a long,
uh, law enforcement in purpose
only
as an investigative tool, um.
know, uh, we're
Clearly this is uh C just data,
so, uh, that those policies also
apply. They have to stay within
the realm of what is permissible
by CJ.
Uh, see just data or um is that
address your question? I think
it was a two part question just
to make sure.
Madam Chair, Captain, yeah,
under the criminal justice
Information System, which is
run.
Out of West Virginia by the FBI.
You coordinate that and so your
ability.
Or
Time
to assist other agencies per MOU
is very fast, is that correct?
Yes, absolutely, once uh that
sharing happens, for example, if
we're sharing data with APD BCSO
or a local or any law
enforcement agency, they get
those alerts at the same time we
do. So if there is a stolen
plate that.
is in their jurisdiction and
they can respond to.
Quicker than perhaps we can
because of the nature of Mexico
State police and how we're
spread out absolutely they.
they can do that.
Um, and then to get back to the
first part of your question
about the
Proposed use, yes, uh.
a million dollars would purchase
approximately 24 of these camera
systems for and and the
associated costs with uh uh with
them for 4 or 5 years, uh.
Which is kind of the time frame
we're looking at for, for the
equipment that we're using, so
it.
a million dollars would go to
purchase 24 additional sites.
Madam Chair, if I could add
there, there are currently
already exist a very firm set of
rules and guidelines as to how
long you can keep that
information not only where you
can disseminate the information,
but you can't just keep it
forever so that when I'm.
90 years old, they'll still have
where I went in Albuquerque in
December 3rd or whatever, so
they can only keep us for a
certain amount of time. It's it.
kind of centers around we there
have been several murders that
have solved because license
plates readers put.
The suspect right in the area in
the right area at the right time
or at the wrong area in the
wrong time, however you wanna
look at it.
The
Madam Chair and I just want to
say I fully support this.
I have a good understanding of
it and I don't know it ever
being abused.
Adam Chair, thank you and
experts.
Thank you, Representative
Representative McQueen.
Thank you, ma'am Chair.
Um,
Madam Chair Chatfield, so
something you said.
Uh, and a shiver down my spine.
And what I'm concerned about
this bill.
Uh, I, I do care about people
knowing where I am.
Whether or not I'm doing
something wrong.
And I think
Knowing where everyone is at all
times.
And solve a lot of crimes.
But it can also be abused.
I'm concerned about, you know,
what restrictions we have on the
use of.
Um, Madam Chair Representative
Chatfield, you said.
Um
They can only keep the data for
a certain amount of time, um.
You're not
Particularly close to 90, um,
how, how long can they keep the
data?
Man Gerald to my expert witness.
Madam Chair, community members
uh representative McQueen, uh.
Just to be
clear, so, uh, we have policy
and procedure in place regarding
retention, uh.
LPR data right now that uh
policy says uh.
No longer
no less than 30 days, uh, if
there is a subsequent hit.
On that meaning, uh, there is an
alert against the NCIC or a
local.
Hotlist file, uh, we can keep it
up to 180 days.
And then lastly, I would point
out just
For full clarification, uh.
if
An alert becomes uh a part of an
enforcement action becomes
evidence then we would keep that
particular alert.
In our evidence management
system until the adju.
Adjudication of the case.
Uh
Mem, chair, um,
Representative expert.
So
Are, are they
When they take an image of a.
License plate or they are
identifying the vehicle? I mean,
is the computer, are you only
looking for a certain license
plates or you identifying all
cars that passed.
Uh, Madam Chair, community
members, uh, Representative
McQueen, so, uh, the cameras
themselves take an image of
every vehicle that goes by, so
it captures within the
capability of the technology,
every plate that goes by.
The
I think the answer to the
question you're kind of asking
is there's a subsequent check
saying does this plate as the
computer understands it, does
that match of uh a plate that
has been put on a hot list,
meaning.
it's stolen, it's subject to a
missing person's alert and Amber
Alert silver alert, uh, or
somehow has a nexus to a
criminal investigation.
And at that point, then an alert
is generated if it does match
and.
uh transmitted either to an
officer or to a com center or to
both, uh, for.
You
Subsequent to our policies and
procedures and possible law
enforcement action.
Uh
Uh, madam chair, an expert.
That was a long answer that
didn't quite follow.
Um, I, I guess.
My question is, are you ready if
you're
Imaging and registering every
plate.
Are you identifying the person,
whether or not that that plate
is on a
But
Madam Chair, uh, community
members represented, uh, no, so,
uh, at no time does it go
further than taking an image of
the plate and trying to
identify.
What those numbers and letters
are on the plate through optical
character recognition, it does
not do a subsequent search and
say this.
Like
belongs to Matthew McQueen. It
does, that's not how the system
worked. It basically says play
ABC 123.
does or doesn't match.
Play
In a hot list it's not about the
person it's about the plate.
Now, uh, uh.
I think that answers your
question.
Um, ma'am, chair.
Representative expert, yeah it
does. I appreciate that.
Follow up question, what, what
is required to put a plate on a
hub.
Is there a
Review process, is there a
warrant involved.
Uh
chairperson, uh, committee
members, uh, representatives,
so, uh.
Uh, there are
several steps to get a.
Plate into these hot lists, uh,
probably most common would be a
stolen vehicle, a vehicle has
been entered as stolen, so
registered owner has come to a
law enforcement agency and said
uh.
pay my vehicles.
Stolen, I want to report it
stolen, so that plate would be
uploaded into the hot.
Hot list um there uh are other
ways if a person has an arrest
warrant.
Written for them.
and signed off by a judge and uh
there is a plate information
associated with that person
saying.
is known to be
You know, using this vehicle
with this plate, that
Uh, license plate could be
uploaded to the hot list.
Um, there are
Other instances where a plate
can be
Uploaded into a hot list for uh
an investigative reason, right?
This person has a.
that, you know, we're conducting
an investigation and this person
is suspected of.
Involved in criminal activity
that plate could be.
to a hot list.
In Mater, um.
The officer is that the right.
Wait to address you.
Uh deputy.
Captain, Captain, captain.
Thank you, Captain.
Uh, here, um, representative
Captain, um.
So, usually in an investigation
to gather certain evidence.
At some point, you need a
warrant, uh.
Is this, this does not rise to
that level.
Uh, Madam Chairperson, uh, our,
our committee members
representing the Queen, not I, I
guess my answer would be.
Not in all cases, uh, I would
say our policy and procedure
does mandate that it's uh any
uh.
Uh,
additions to the hot list is
approved by a supervisor, so
there is a check and balance
there.
To ensure correct usage.
Uh
this technology.
And Madam Chair, um,
representing the captain.
Uh, you match the the type of
vehicle to the plate.
Um, so if there's a, if not a
stolen car, but a stolen plate.
And it's supposed to be on a
You know, silver
Honda and it said it's on a, you
know, green for. Does, does that
get flagged or?
You're just looking at the
plate.
Madam Chairperson, community
members, representative McQueen,
so yes, um, the type of vehicle.
Um, is, uh, captured by the
system color in some cases make
and model um as best as the this
technology can work, um, that
might be.
Uh, so that's would come into
the review by the officer to
look at this alert and determine
whether this is a valid alert or
a misread of.
That
A plate, so it, it's.
Like the, the, the question gets
kind of into the subtleties and
into the necessity of having a
human behind this technology to
say yes, that doesn't look
right.
I need to, I need to take some
enforcement action here.
potentially
And
cherubs and kept in there um.
You used to be a bumper sticker,
see around town that said.
Um, you can take my civil
liberties. I wasn't using them
anyway.
Um, and I kind of feel that's,
that's where we are.
I mean, I, you know, if you
tracked me 24 hours a day.
You'd be pretty bored.
Um, but that doesn't mean once
someone tracking me 24 hours a
day, so have some ease about the
Use of this technology.
I'll tell you there was um
There was a home invasion
robbery in one of my
communities.
Um, someone followed resident
home.
Um, broken into their house like
violently.
And we talked to the sheriff and
The sheriff suggested um using
license plate readers, and
there's only, this is the
largest community, there's only
two ways in and out.
So you could monitor everyone
that comes in and out of this
community.
And the community
You know, was up in arms about
this.
Prime
And didn't want that to happen.
That was more than they wanted.
In terms of enforcement.
Um, so it's a source of concern.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, Representative uh.
Inman chair, thank you.
Resent Chatfield and Captain.
what you do to keep it safe.
Every day, um,
Earlier in your testimony, you
said that the data is usually
kept between 30 and 180 days.
That's correct.
Madam
My
Madam Chair committee members,
uh.
So yes, the answer is our
policy, uh, states it will be
retained no less than 30 days up
to the maximum of 180 days.
That's correct.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
Representative and Captain.
Mm
Who owns the data?
I mean, it's deposited
somewhere. Where is that?
Was
Uh, madam chair, uh, committee
members, so New Mexico state
police own the data. It is.
uh, it resides in a
Uh
uh, out in the cloud that we.
Purchase and pay for uh the
particular system that we're
using is uh Microsoft Learn or
I'm sorry, Motorola Len system
but.
Uh, we
New Mexico State police own the
data.
Thank you Madam Chair
Representative Captain, last
question.
Who has access to
Uh, madam chair, uh, committee
members, so, uh.
Obviously, New Mexico state
police has access to the data.
uh
Just to clarify your question or
like what level of personnel
within our law enforcement
agency or
General
her
Representative Captain.
Yeah, let me, let me
Clarify it
Is anybody outside of law
enforcement.
Have access to data.
Madam Chair, committee members,
no, the answer is no, um, uh.
This, this data is uh law
enforcement sensitive. It falls
under uh uh Cis data which very
strictly limits who we can uh
provide with this information.
Thank you, Madam Chair,
Representative Captain.
No, I said that was my last
question, but.
Never is.
Um
Can this be accessed under
discovery by a defense attorney?
Madam Chairman, uh
Committee members
We have not seen that happen,
um.
Uh, my answer to that question
would be.
That because it is just.
Data
It would fall under an exception
to
Ipra and Discovery.
Um, uh
But
Uh, in a criminal investigation,
uh, I think.
Uh
Uh, through the legal process if
there was a subpoena, I, I
believe we have to supply that
data.
I just want to make sure that.
It's only by subpoena that
that's available to anybody
outside of law enforcement.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. I appreciate.
Thank you, Captain. Thank you,
Representative.
So we are welcoming our former
chairman of this committee,
Representative Cook, good to see
you. Sorry to interrupt, but
we're having old home week.
Yeah, that's right, and it looks
like he's wearing a gym suit.
we are suddenly.
I apologize, Representative
Martinez. I hope I didn't,
you're done, OK, um,
representative, thank you, madam
Chair. Thank you, Representative
Chatfield and Captain.
go for your service and for your
presentation. My first question
is about clarifying the 112.
Number that you presented so.
Is it correct that you will have
88.
You currently have 88.
Madam Chair, I defer to my
expert witness.
Madam Chair, community members
representative of Abita, um, I,
I think the number is closer to
96 as long as we're talking
about fixed.
Units at uh this question gets
uh.
Difficult with like as as we
were preparing the fur for that,
which is where that information
came we're mostly thinking about
uh our, our planned investment
in additional fixed units, but
we also have a mobile units, uh,
are significantly more in
number.
Thank you. Um, that I'm sure
Representative Chapville and
Captain Clay Gore. My next
question is about um the sharing
of information with law
enforcement agencies. Do you
currently share information with
the county sheriffs.
Madam Chair, uh, community
members, uh, representative of
beta, yes, uh, we will share
with uh any law enforcement
agency across certainly across
the state of New Mexico, um,
and, and across the United
States we.
In Mexico State police in New
Mexico Department of Public
Safety firmly believe.
uh, working together with our.
Partner agencies only makes us
stronger, better, and more
efficient.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Chapfield,
Captain Clayor, so do you need
an MOU to work with them or is
there one in place right now.
Uh
Madam
show person committee members,
uh, Representative Ovita so as
part of the request to share
with with us for example, if if
an agency is asking us to share
their data, there is an MOU that
they have to sign off with as
part of that sharing it's, it's
fairly straightforward, uh, it's
mostly about, uh, you know, uh,
the protection of how this is
being used. It's only for law
investigative purposes, those
kind of things, but so.
it's, it's, it's part of the
ask.
uh, as far as I'm aware we've
had no issues, uh.
MOUs.
Statewide areas.
Thank you and Madam Chair
Representative Chatfield,
Captain Clay Gore, my last
question is regarding the names
that go onto the hot list. How
long do they stay there?
When can they come off? What
type of insight can you give me
to that? Thank you.
Uh, Madam Chairperson, uh,
community members, uh,
representative of ata just to be
clear, names do not go onto the
hot list.
So, uh
It's a license plate.
Reader, so license plate data
goes on there.
Uh, for our agency, uh, as I
indicated it's no less than 30,
no more than 180 days.
Unless it becomes evidence where
we've taken law enforcement
action and then it becomes uh
stored in another system, uh,
until we complete adjudication
of that case.
Madame Chair Representative
Chatfield, Captain Clayor, I, my
apologies for the confusion.
What I meant was earlier you had
said that there were lists.
That
Allowed you to upload the
information.
Not necessarily what has been
read from plates, but the list
itself.
That's the one I'm talking
about, where you had said it
could be you could be added to
this hot list for stolen vehicle
or arrest warrant investigative
reason, how long can a plate
stay on that list before it's
taken off or.
Tell me more about that. Thank
you.
Madam Chair Pearson.
a chairperson, uh, committee
members representative of Beta,
I think the answer to that is
kind of specific on to why it
made it onto the list, for
example, a stolen vehicle will
stay.
Uh
On that list as long as the
vehicle remains stolen.
Uh, once it, it has been
recovered or removed for
whatever reason from NCIC then
it will fall off that list, uh,
I would say that we update that
list 4 times a day so that we
stay up to date.
As much as possible we obviously
don't want our officers working
on out of date information.
In other cases, it's gonna be
dependent upon what put them on
there, uh.
Typically because these fall
under NCIC. There is a whole set
of regulations about auditing on
that side that makes sure that.
The reason that they fell into
those those uh.
Uh
Is
Re-evaluated
Uh
as appropriate uh.
governed by the FBI who's the
administrator for.
NCIC and other sieges related.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative Chatfield and
Captain.
Chatfield
One more question. Are these
installed in units or are they
installed in a stationary area
as well.
Madam Chairperson, uh, community
members, representative debate
that so both, uh, we.
have, uh,
Fixed
Sites where
We are installing LPR cameras.
We also have uh.
Some
dedicated mobile.
Installations we have, uh, some
that we call quick deploy that
uh we are able to move around
rapidly when we identify an area
that's having some kind of
significant problem or need, we
can move them in there.
We also have them installed as
part of our uh dash cameras uh
for our uniformed patrolman that
front facing camera functions as
an LPR for uh.
patrolmen that have
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative, and thank
you Captain. No further
questions.
Uh, Representative Reeb.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Chatfield and Captain for
bringing this bill. My
Mine is more of just a comment,
um, I've, I've heard a lot of
people expressing privacy
concerns and things of that
nature. And I guess I would just
say that, you know, we're, we're
in a state that
is rated one of the worst in
crime right now, and I think
that to balance some possible
potential, which I'm not really
even seeing privacy interests
with the safety of our community
and solving crimes that this is
a good bill and this is
something that we need to look
at definitely passing because we
need to look at public safety
this session, and that's what
we're focusing on, and we're
living in a place that, you
know, we need to give you every
tool that we can give you to
solve crime and and protect the
citizens of the state, so.
I just wanted to make that
comment. Thank you
representative for bringing it.
Thank you, Captain for
testifying. Um, thank you, Madam
Chair.
Um, thank you, representative,
and thank you, Captain.
So a question we didn't the
issue of IPRA was alluded to, I
think by you, Captain, actually.
So
We're holding on to a license
plate information for 30 days.
I understand it's not attached
to a name yet has the potential
to be attached to a name, but it
isn't in that list.
Um, if an IPRA request came in
saying,
Has a license plate reader
picked up X Y Z X Y Z license
plate.
Would that be subject to an EPA
request.
Madame
I defer to my expert witness.
Madam Chair, committee members,
uh, my answer to today would be
no.
We, we've clearly stated this is
uh.
ig ious data
And cannot be uh disseminated
outside of law enforcement, um.
I, I think
Where you're really going with
this question is could.
Uh, in the upper request be.
Uh
You used to.
Full information out of the
system and harass stalk or
anything like that. My, my
answer today would be no, I
don't believe.
Uh, that it would be.
Uh
Disseminated via that mechanism.
OK, what what makes the the fact
that it's in this thing you call
Cis, such a magical thing that
it's not subject to IPRA.
Captain.
Um
Madam Chairperson committee
members, uh, just the fact that
because uh it is law
enforcement, uh.
Confidential
I, I believe
that
That would be fall under one of
the exceptions of IPRA.
I am aware that there is another
bill in place and I think it was
brought up.
That addresses this question
specifically.
Uh, but, uh, uh.
In my conversations with our uh
records bureau. I, I think it
would fall outside of that.
Could be argued, but
believe it would fall outside of
that.
Yes, that's a bill I'm
sponsoring with uh Senator
Wirth, so we'll have a more
expansive discussion, no doubt
about the appropriate balance
between.
Protecting people's civil
liberties and privacy and what's
appropriate for law enforcement,
and I hope
We're all respectful of both
needs, that will be a
conversation presumably when we
get that bill here.
Um, one more of a kind of a
technical thing. What are all
these black things that are over
people's license plates, you
know, those.
It's like a plastic he black
color dark shaded smoky. Is that
intended to block the license
plate reader and does it block
the license plate reader.
So, Madam Chair, I once again
will defer to my expert witness.
Madam Chair, uh, committee
members, um, I.
I believe those that were
initially kind of a uh
Maybe, uh
used to
Get away from speed cameras,
right? It does obscure the
license plate uh there are.
of
numerous variations.
Some of them are clear, but
when uh light hits them and I a
bleak angle they.
Diffused the light and caused
the license plate to be.
Obscured uh.
For the most part, like we have
a law in New Mexico that
addresses the visibility of the
law, uh.
license plate. I
I
I think in some cases those
would violate that statute about
the distance that a license
plate is visible and
And so some enforcement action
could be taken there ultimately.
Uh
Could they obscure the license
plate where the
LPR does not.
capture it
It may be possible, um.
The LPR, uh,
has some technology built into
it that uses infrared and if
those are don't block infrared,
it, it.
So it becomes a question of
they're capable of I guess. So
um.
I think I, what I heard you say
is maybe it could maybe block.
Uh, reader.
If it was the right technology
and speaker, did you want us,
um.
Oh, OK, sorry.
I'll hurry up, um, OK, well, um.
We can have a more expansive
discussion and it sounds like
we're going to when our Senate
bill comes over. So thank you.
Happy to entertain a motion
speaker.
And Mo Du Pas manager.
Motion for a due pass made by
Speaker Martinez and seconded by
Representative Martinez.
Did you call the rule?
Representative Abita.
Yes.
Representative Chavez.
Yes.
Representative Hall.
Yes
Representative Hockman B. Hill.
Representative Martinez.
Yes
Speaker Martinez, yes.
Representative McQueen.
No, and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Representative Reeb, yes.
Leader Sapansky, yes.
Madam Vice Chair,
Yes.
Madam Chair
Yes.
Um, Representative McQueen
briefly since I think you did
explain your vote, so.
Um
Thank you, ma'am, Chair. Um.
cherubs and Captain, um.
I think this is a powerful tool
and
Uh, I, I have no reason to
believe you have misused it. I
am concerned about the overall
implications about the
surveillance state.
Uh, and this is one aspect of
that.
Uh, so I'm, I'm looking forward
to further discussions about
How we make sure these tools
aren't used in.
Thank you very much.
Um, thank you. You have a do
pass rep.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you members of the committee.
Thank you. He's gonna take off
the uh the shield he has on his
license plate. I saw one. He's
got it on his truck. Well,
it does kind of irritate me.
So
Um,
Representative Hoffman B. Hill
is absent today. She's not
feeling well, so we're gonna
roll her bill.
And we are now on House Bill
182.
Judicial retirement changes.
The supplemental handout.
And we have a handout, I think
that was asked to be provided by
the AOC.
OK.
I'm sorry.
When we get started, we'll have
a speaker um Martinez will sit
there, uh, with you.
Um, thank you, Speaker, for
offering.
Oh
OK, speaker.
All right,
all right, Speaker, the floor on
House Bill 182.
Which
Uh, increases for non-aggistrate
judges, um, the service credit
for service earned on or after
July 1, 2024 from 3.25% to 4%
per year for the next 10 years
of service and 3.5% for a year
after the next 10 years. Uh, it
also reduces the vesting period
from 8 to 5 years, it increases
the maximum pension that can be
earned from 85% to 100%. It
increases member contribution
rates from 10.5% to 14.74% of
pay.
And it increases employer
contribution rates from 15% of
pay to 19.24% of pay and with me
is Justice Shannon Bacon, who
will serve as the expo witness.
Welcome Justice.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
Um, this bill is, is born of our
continued work towards
recruiting more judges.
As I have presented to you for
numerous years, we believe there
are 3 significant challenges to
recruiting judges in New Mexico.
One was salary.
One was retirement and then the
other one is having to run for
office, the much more that third
one's a much more complicated
conversation. So we're gonna
focus on retirement.
Um, this bill does a couple of
important things. First, it um.
Reduces the vesting period from
8 years to 5 years.
So a judge doesn't have to run
twice.
In order to secure some
percentage of their retirement.
And second, it increases the
service credit in the first
years of service, so that
somebody who's a little more
experienced, a little longer in
the tooth, perhaps, can look at
applying for a judicial position
and receive, um, some portion of
the judicial retirement Act,
whereas otherwise they have to
serve for a very, very long time
to get to that magic moment as
as we think of it, and it really
dissuades folks that are.
in their 50s, mid-50s from
applying because they put in and
they're not going to receive
anything on the back end.
The important
Headline of all of this that
makes it different than any
other.
Um
pension bill, you will hear this
year is we're not asking for any
money.
Not one penny
We're taking it upon ourselves
to fix our retirement plan.
And it achieved solvency.
If this passes, we will be the
only retirement plan on a true
path to solvency.
Currently
The judicial retirement plan,
um.
is funded at 58%.
And it's amortization period
fell from 17 years.
to never.
So we're in a in a position now
of never having solvency in the
judicial retirement plan.
This, um, with these changes, it
would change it from never
infinite to 59 years, so I won't
be alive when it's solvent, most
of us won't be.
Um, but it, it gets us on that
that particular track.
This will, um.
Reducing the vesting period from
8 years to 5 years puts us on an
even playing field with plan 3,
which is the state employees.
The employer contribution rate
will go up to 19.24%, which puts
us on the same level as plan 3.
And the member contribution will
go from 10.5% to 14.74%. So the
judges will pay more into the
retirement than any other
employee in the state.
Judiciary is willing to do this.
We have tried everything else.
In 2014, we reduced the accrual
rate. We extended the term of
service.
Didn't move the needle, you all
graciously appropriated $20
million just cash.
Didn't move the needle.
This is the only way we're gonna
be able to move the needle
without coming before you and
asking probably for on the order
of $100 million.
So
That's the, the JRA this the
second bill will follow much of
the same narrative, but I think
that's really the, the brunt of
it and um I will turn it back
over, Madam Chair too.
Um, my sponsor.
Thank you. And, and thank you,
um, representative, and thank
you Madam Chair. I'm good to
proceed with.
Questions. Very good. So, um,
before we go to questions, let's
go to the public.
Anyone in the audience wishing
to speak in opposition to the
bill.
Please keep it to 90 seconds if
you could.
All right, I don't see anyone,
anyone online.
Um, no, I don't see any hands up
online. Anyone in the audience
wishing to speak and support,
please keep it to 90 seconds.
Yes, Mr.
I know
Trujillo
Thank you,
Madam Chair. Yes, uh, Gregory
Hill with PERA of the power
board hasn't taken an official
stance, hasn't had a chance to
take an official stance on this
position, but any analysis that
we have done uh is positive and
it does put this fund in a much
better financial position, and
I'll be available to answer any
questions, Madam Chair.
Trujillo. Anyone else wishing to
speak in support of the bill.
In the audience.
I don't see anyone, anyone
online wishing to speak in
support. Please raise your hand.
I don't see anyone online. All
right, back to you, um,
chairwoman, anything else before
we go to the committee? No,
we'll go ahead and stand for
questions. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you very much.
Committee members.
A representative beta.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you representative, um.
Yeah, my first uh question is um
the
Is about the non-magistrate
judges. Can you please explain
why they're not included in
this.
Thank you.
Uh, Madam Chair.
Yes
Uh, Madam Chair representative,
the next bill on your agenda is
the magistrate judges.
Um, there's a judicial
retirement Act and a magistrate
retirement Act, and they are
separate, so we have to run
separate legislation to address
changes. So the next bill on
your agenda for today will
address the magistrate judges.
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair,
Representative, um,
And I'm
New on this committee. Could you
explain why they're different?
That for my understanding, thank
you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, um, it's because
that's how you all set it up.
Um, what, and that's a frequent
answer to some of the questions
we get about the retirement like
why did they go to a smaller
percentage of of service, well,
because that, that's what you
guys decided, we don't get to
run this, so it's always been
held separately within the ambit
of PERA but as the judicial
retirement Act and the
magistrate Retirement Act, and I
think logically,
They were pro
Predates me, um, and I've been a
judge.
More than a minute. Um.
But I think there's a logic to
it from its inception because
the magistrate judges, um,
Historically have not been
lawyers.
It's changing to a certain
degree now, but historically
they have not been, they come
into the position at a much
younger age than judges do most
judges have to be a minimum of
35 years to start the job.
Um, so they've always had
different features because of
that.
Um, also, most of the magistrate
judges are drawing a pension
from other sources of state
service. They are the they are
the group, one of the groups in
New Mexico who can double dip.
So lots of retired law
enforcement come in.
become magistrate judges when
they retire and so they're
drawing from their law
enforcement pension. So there's
all these little details that I
think dictate that that
separation. There had been some
questions.
I think 2 years ago, I'm looking
at Greg about whether we should
merge the magistrate judges into
PERA.
And said, well, we'll go talk to
PERA about it and they, they
want to keep it separate as
well.
Thank you, that helps, Madam
Chair and representative and
expert witness. Thank you.
I representative Reid. Um thank
you, Madam Chair,
representative, um, Justice
Bacon.
Maybe, so you said, um, it
would.
Prevent them from having to run
twice.
And I see that magistrate Court,
but I guess I'm on the district
court level.
Madam Chair, can you explain
that to me.
Um, Madam Chair Representative
currently the district court
judges have to run every 6
years.
And so to achieve the vesting
period stayed at 8 years, you
run for election 2 times.
Um, and for folks who come wanna
come in, say it's 60 and serve.
They may not want to run twice.
They're, they're willing to come
in and devote 6 years of their
life to what is otherwise a
really hard job. So that's,
that's what that helps to adjust
so that you would vest towards
the end of your first term.
Alright, and so Madam Chair and
Justice bacon, it's not.
It's not just the retention
they're actually having to run
twice and it's been so long
since my, my husband's a judge
and all, but I, it was so long
ago, I'm just trying to, I don't
know if he ever had to run
twice, but, um, Madam Chair
representative retention.
Is, is running. I mean, people
get removed from the bench and
that that.
causes, it's a different stress
than than your stress where you
might have an opponent, um, but
getting to 57% of the voters
saying yes to your retention,
um.
qualifies even under our rules
of ethics as as running for OK,
so that's the, the distinction,
yeah, OK, justice, so you meant
the retention, yes, ma'am.
So I'm, I'm just trying to think
this out because I, I think I
understand what you're trying to
do, um, madam chair, just making
is, but so a lot of times like
where I'm from, well, used to
not not in a long time, but.
Older lawyers would come in and
You know, 6, towards the end of
their.
Their careers, their
experienced, um, judges.
And they wouldn't stay very long
at all. And so I'm assuming by
making 8 to 5, you're trying to
get these, you're trying to get
these judges to stay like at
least 5 or.
Or is it kind of
Also kind of in a way makes me
think it backfires a little,
makes them not stay longer. Does
that make sense? I'm sure.
Madam Chair Representative, I
unders I, I follow what what
you're saying, so when in what
I'll call the olden days, cuz it
predates me, um.
The, the, the judges were in
what everyone viewed as very
much a golden parachute of, of
pension plans. It was a straight
15 years to retirement and um.
It was 5 years to vest.
And so you were able to get
folks to come in later, serve.
Um, and then, and then leave and
there's and there's there's
benefit to that. There's also
benefit to having a very diverse
judiciary.
Um, it's not really a
backfiring. I use Alan Mallot as
my example here. He was a
district court judge in
Bernalillo County office next
door to me. He was a very loud
man, by the way, through the
wall.
Um, and he came in later in life
and he made a a uh enough money
that he was gonna be OK. Um, and
he stayed.
Um, beyond the five years, but
not much longer. He's he got to
the point where it's just too
hard a job.
To do it, requiring people to
serve and tell.
They're 72.
Some instances 80.
To to benefit from, from this.
So part of a big part of this is
drawing people that will come
and give them of themselves, but
they're not, they're not
interested in being on the
ballot.
Twice.
And then age becomes a factor
too. And Madam Chair, Justice
Bacon, I, I remember seeing that
all the time, maybe 10 years
ago, 15 years ago, um, judges
would come on the bench and they
were actually financially pretty
financially stable, so they
could, you know, come and it's
gonna have their end their
career doing this prestigious
job as a judge, they would stay
very short time and leave cause
money wasn't a factor. Now with
also with the great races that
was given to judges, which I
admit I'm benefiting from
myself.
is married to a judge, um, that
is, so that's part your first
part of the plan and then now is
to try to diversify, I guess
more qualified.
Our lawyers into the system and
then.
Right. And then we get to the
election part, which I may not
agree with you on that part, but
I, I, I'm seeing where you're
going with this, so.
OK.
I think that answers my
questions. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Justice
Speaker.
Representative Hall.
Ask and answered, ma'am.
And after my own heart, anyone
else, representative, uh.
Romero, vice chair Romero,
Madam, I'd like to move a
DuPonts on.
Made by Representative Romero,
2ndinsky, would you call the
roll, please. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Representative Abeta,
yes.
Representative Chavez, yes.
Representative Hall
Yes.
Representative Hockman V. Hill.
Representative Martinez.
Yes.
Speaker Martinez.
Representative McQueen, yes.
Representative Reeb, yes.
Leader Slapansky, yes.
Madam Vice Chair, yes.
Madam Chair, yes.
Me, oh sorry, go ahead. Madam
Chair, with 10 yeses, you have a
do pass on 182.
I spill 182. Very good. Thank
you. We're now on house 183,
Magistrate retirement changes.
It's
You, Madam Chair.
And members of the committee. So
this is uh House Bill 183 is now
addressing the very same issues,
but as it relates to
magistrates, and I will add real
quickly I learned something
having been on the investment.
Uh, we were in the Senate
Judiciary and representative, I
mean, a senator.
Mo Maestas brought up his
favorite point that is very um.
Applicable and that is that.
Very few, if any.
Of these uh plans ever reach the
goal of 100% solvency. So that's
an important point I just wanted
to add to both of the
discussions, because whenever
we're talking about retirement
funds, we need to be cognizant
of that so that we do not
minimize the importance of how
we should be treating our
public.
Uh and and in this case our
judiciary, thank you, madam.
Thank you, Representative. um,
Justice Bacon.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. The
only real, the, the material
difference between the judicial
retirement bill and the
magistrate retirement bill is
the Service credit accrual.
I mean, you'll see in the
handout we passed around at 0.5,
the MRA, the service credit for
magistrates remains 3% a year.
This is directly tied to the age
in which a magistrate can become
a magistrate. Currently, it's 18
years old. There is a bill that
will come in front of you that
changes it to 28 years that the
magistrates themselves are
supporting, which is a great
thing for them to take on, um,
but it's still that real age
discrepancy that leaves their
percentage at 3%, which is more
akin to other plans where people
can come at a very young age,
but otherwise.
The changes are, um, the same.
Um
Are we ready to go to the
audience? All right, those in
the audience wishing to speak in
support of the bill in
opposition to the bill, please.
step forward.
Anyone online.
House Bill 1
Those in the audience wishing to
speak in support of House Bill
183.
Please step forward. Uh, yes,
Mr. Trujillo.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Greg
with Pera again, the PE board
hasn't taken an official stance
on this, uh, legislation, but
the analysis we have performed
does put the fund on a much
better uh path financially and
happy to ask answer any
questions.
Thank you. Anyone else in the
audience wishing to speak in
support.
Don't see anyone, anyone online
wishing to speak and support,
please.
I don't see any hands raised,
right? Uh, we're ready to go to
committee, representative. Madam
Chair, we stand for questions.
Thank you. Very good. Anyone
with questions?
Uh, Representative Hall.
Madam Chair
Madam Chair, justice.
Um
Do, do you know off the top of
your head, the average tenure of
our magistrate judges. I know
they run 4-year terms.
But
Typically, at least in my
district, they're re-elected on
a pretty frequent basis. Do we
have any data on that? I don't
sure.
Um, Madam Chair Representative,
off the top of my head, I don't
have the answer to that
question. I'm happy to get that
to you. I think you're um
anecdotal observation that in
particular in um more rural
communities, magistrates tend to
serve for a good clip of, of
time.
It's more in the arena of Las
Cruces, that there's a little
more action fighting for for
those particular seats in
particular because the
magistrates in Las Cruces are
required to be lawyers. So I
think there's a tendency for um
a view of that being of a a
stepping stone to the district
court. So there's a little more
uh back and forth in Las Cruces,
but otherwise, most magistrates
do serve for a a good chunk of
time unless they get cross.
wise with
Us
Madam Chair and representative,
uh, we can get that information
to you right now, Mr. Trujillo
does not have that available
either, but we can offer that.
If you
Thank you, Madam Chair, one
other question, so.
Um
Since they run for re-election.
Every 4 years.
The reducing the vesting period,
does that really
make a difference and it said it
would be their 2nd term anyway,
Madam Chair.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh,
representative, good observation
because we're changing their
suit, that's at their request
initially, we didn't have that
there because of that very
observation most er.
Probably I'm guessing on average
2 to 3 terms, um, but at their
request they wanted to be
treated more like the the law
law trained judges and we had no
objection to that, um, and it
makes it easier, I think for
everyone to understand what our
plans do. If we're not markedly
different as we.
I'm done. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you. Anyone else?
Representative Chavez.
Thank you, Madam Chair, thank
you.
Justice. I have a question. So,
Being that
I know you had a question on the
vesting. Would they be the only
ones then at the time that the
vesting period is 8 years and
not 5 if our regular retirees
and now you all, if this bill
gets through, are now vested at
5. Would they be the only ones
left today?
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
another good observation, it it
they would be the outlier in
that regard, and we don't see a
need for making them an outlier.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Anyone else with
questions, OK.
Um
Happy to entertain a motion.
Go ahead,
representative. I'll.
Uh, we have a motion for a due
pass on House Bill 183 made by
Representative Ramiro. 2 noted
by Representative Hall, which
you call the roll?
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Abeta, yes.
