Representative Rehm.
I'm here of somebody in.
I've got you.
Representative Rehm.
Representative Townsend.
I share because.
Yes.
Madam chair.
Present.
We have a quorum.
Thank you very much I think we
also we will try to quickly
dispense with this items all of
and when state which is house
bill nine so we need
Representative Hernandez Senator
Ivey Soto with her and
Whomever else they need I'm not
sure if they need any would
accept our analyst.
Representative.
Senator Ivey Soto joining here
today.
No madam chair he's the rules
stated rules hearing okay thank.
I think we're ready to hear it
we got the committee substitute.
And the reason it's a committee
sub instead of having amendments
is that we had a committee seven
we don't amend that we just have
a point seven version now so
would you like to go ahead
explain what the changes are and
Will will be glad to take action
and thank you.
Thank you madam chair I will as
of analyst Lisa Lara in in the
column if they would please
provide the explanation about
the changes.
That would be just fine.
Point seven version changes the
name of the crime throughout the
bill to recklessly making
firearm accessible to a minor
resulting in great bodily harm
or death and recklessly making a
firearm assessable assessable to
a minor.
And so part one of the both
sections a and B.
the language with the within any
Mrs that are under the person's
custody or control is stricken
so those provisions read.
Person keeps or stores any
firearm in a manner that is
incorrect as in reckless
disregard to minors ability to
access the firearm.
in a to the language language is
changed.
Us so that great bodily injury
or death the minor causes is not
limited to another person.
Those provisions that are A. two
rates now a minor obtains access
to the firearm and uses it in a
manner that causes great bodily
harm to or death of the minor or
another person.
In B. two.
Language is changed to a minor
obtained access to the fire arm
and brandishes displays or shows
the firearm in a threatening
manner or cause injury to the
minor or to another person not
resulting in great bodily harm
or death.
And see I exception for peace
officers were members of the
military languages change into
the were language or incidental
to is removed so that that
provision reads the person is a
peace officer or member of the
armed forces of the United
States or the National Guard and
the minor stains firearm during
the program performance of the
person's duties.
And and
part F. definition of firearm is
change so that is so that is
exactly the same as in section
thirty seven sixteen D. four
which is a section on firearms
or destructive devices receipt
transportation or position I
certain persons penalty so that
definition now reads I are are
means that economic that well or
is designed to or may readily be
converted to expel a projectile
by the action of an explosion or
the frame of any such weapons.
Madam chair your muted.
Forgive me.
Two years you think we can learn
this time.
Okay.
That explains all of the changes
this large.
Madam chair yes okay thank you
and I appreciate.
So other questions on the point
seven version.
No questions.
Okay I think we had a motion on
the I know we don't have a
motion I do need a motion from
the committee.
The madam chair do not pass on
the bill in the to pass on the
committee substitute.
The point seven okay thank you
very much.
I'll make that second.
Representative Nibert
discussion.
Thank you madam chair I'm sorry.
Every find all my buttons go
different places.
We need to get used to where
they're out here
Sure I do have a couple
questions because this bill.
How does receive some fairly
significant changes are.
Madam chair and Representative
so basically we no longer have
the premises issue
in this bill as I as I read this
version is that correct.
Madam chair representative
Nibert that is correct.
So.
Basically you're stating that
it's a crime if you.
Make the or if you.
Yes allow access to a minor
of that particular weapon and
then that weapon is used
Certain our crime so it's it's
really two stages of our state
of that are you would stay at.
Miss madam chair Representative
Nibert.
Correct.
First part is.
The.
Person allows it to be
accessible.
Remember second part because of
the minor.
Access is the guy and and then
does something either causing
great bodily harm or
Brandishes Representative was
whatever and can be
so.
M..
My concern is is with respect
to.
The crime itself because as I
pointed out last time we met.
Many of my constituents.
We need to make.
Fire arms accessible to.
The miners.
All in many instances of minors
our well in almost all instances
those miners are are quite
accomplished by the time they're
even out of the.
a young age of of handling the
those weapons and so parents.
Yes are going to make those
things accessible have always
made those economic success for
their children because their
children are also counted upon
to protect their flocks of sheep
America would have you.
And so I I guess that it's a
crime for a parent to have a.
Child who then.
Goes off the rails and does bad
things with that so we're we're
criminalizing
Shows that the.
In some instances may be beyond
the parents control.
I really struggled back from a
goal softgel standpoint as to
what we traditionally have done
with the criminal law of the the
bench probably neither here nor
there
Madam chair and representative.
What about firearms that are
owned by the minor.
Madam chair.
Representative barber under the.
The love of my other cannot
purchase a firearm so the
medication at home the fire on
the fire would be owned by
someone who is eighteen years of
age or older.
Are your testimony as you can
only on something if you can
purchase a.
Well what items Madam chair
representative viper.
What I'm stating is that the
people who have access to a gun
the ability of fire on the
ability to purchase it would be
someone who is eighteen years of
age or older and this laws that
is requesting and directing the
individuals who are responsible
for the fire alarm those
purchases that is our
responsibility to make sure that
it's kept saying and I'm
assessable by my.
So that's the the focus of this
piece of legislation.
Madam chair representative.
The minor bones but I'm.
Or the parents still held
responsible for the access of
the firearm that is in later
used in the commission of these
are supposing crimes.
Madam chair representative
Nibert I will repeat my answer
yes automatic ten that purchase
a gun at the end it is against
the law for Monday to purchase
the so the owner but that would
be the people who are eligible
to purchase the.
Madam chair all right again my
question
that the minor phones the gun.
By whatever mechanism.
Illegal purchase which is
covered here.
Why gift why is.
Or
Through their inheritance.
Weapon is used in the commission
of a crime is a parent.
Going to be held liable.
For criminal.
Sanctions under the terms of
this bill.
Chair representative by Burt I'm
not purchase the gun the owner
of the gun would be the person
who purchased it this bill is
saying if you are the owner of a
gun and you have the and you
keep it in a manner that is
assessable by by a minor you
will be held responsible that is
the focus of this piece of
legislation.
Madam chair and and
Representative can a trial.
Recieve a firearm through
inheritance or devise.
Madam chair representative
Nibert I have not seen that
incident occurring in the books
in any of but I've seen you may
be you may be eligible to have
that what should become of age
and so I report that to you
representative madam chair
Representative night so so when
you when money is given to you
and you are mine at which is not
quite eligible to know how to
spend it and how to take care of
it so that is not use it
responsibly so there is I trust
someone else was put in charge
of it until you are eligible to
do so so I would believe that
those would be the same
instances that would apply if
you are trying to state that a
grandfather or someone else
wants to leave their wives who
two very young grandson it would
be held in trust by the parents
and to the minor is old enough
to be the responsible owner of
the our.
Madam chair we may be here a
really long time if we want to
talk about wills and trusts
because why.
My experience.
Yeah my
I'm
reading of
Many of those
Cases and what's involved in
this issue.
Would not result in the same
conclusion that the
representative just stated
so when we get either do that or
or waiting cut to the chase.
I would submit Madam chair
representative.
Minors.
Are capable of owning.
What happened through yes
devise or inheritance.
And that the parents.
Are not holding that weapon and
trust they're not holding that
weapon are for their benefit but
it is owned by.
The.
Minor child and my question is
if that is the case.
Would the parents be responsible
for it be criminally liable
under the terms of this fact if
that were the of the case the
the child on the economic child
responsible for the economic.
Or the parents still liable
under the terms of your bill.
Madam chair representative
divert for the many years that I
spent doing estate and gift tax
work.
I want to say that I disagree
with your interpretation.
And that the interpretation that
I have provided is the one that
this app.
And that's what we have
attorneys on different sites so
no matter how many ways to add
just that question to ask the
question my answer is going to
be the same the money I could
not purchase the done if the
done even is given to a minor by
requests that by grandfathers
we'll get our divides as you
previously stated it would be
held in trust by the by the
parents of the guardian and to
the minor is old enough to hold
so I'm just saying that's we
have differing opinions and so I
would suggest Madam chair
representative Nibert we move to
your next question.
Well I would I will.
Because of them of terms of a
hypothetical to get around the
the the issue that you're you're
dodging.
If the gun.
Is.
Minors.
Well let me ask it this way.
Is it your intent.
To.
Capture within the scope of this
bill.
Why ability of the parent.
For the.
Child access to.
Any weapons.
A firearm.
That was not illegal.
Okay.
So madam chair Representative
Nibert this bill focuses on and
it might not have an access to a
bar or have been used in it to
cause great bodily harm or death
of a person or of themselves and
so it the Barham has not been
caps.
In a manner that is that is not
accessible that is accessible
rather by mine and those
additional elements of her.
The person who owns the firearm
or is responsible for it under
this statute is the
responsibility so.
That's the focus of the statue
right Madam chair
representative.
Are you said the person
responsible wiring
hypothetical said parent so
would they be the same.
Madam chair representative.
So Madam chair representative
Nibert I want to make sure that
we stay focused on the of the
bill and not create scenarios
that don't apply to so one of
the things that I go back to
saying that we are just we are
going to disagree that how a
minute by inherited a a weapon
or firearm and that it would be
the responsibility of the person
who was holding it in trust for
the money but when they become
age to all our our to make sure
that this step in a state and X.
and not assessable for use in a
matter when they are not present
with respect to the fire.
Madam chair representative are
you aware of any constitutional
provision for statute.
That prohibits ownership.
Of a rifle fire minor.
Chair representative Nibert I am
aware of the laws that did not
allow the sale of weapons fire
wants to remind.
Yes you're focused on sale I'm
focused on ownership.
Madam chair representative
Nibert I don't we have agreed to
disagree and I don't know what
else to say I don't agree with
the with the premise with the
resolution that you're coming up
with our the summary that you're
coming up with I think it's
incorrect I do believe that the
one that I'm presenting this
correct so we are just
disagreeing on how that access
in terms of someone coming in
possession of a firearm whether
it's to.
Illegal purchased so whether
it's through I ownership are to.
To ownership by a wheel are by
some yes where would be held in
trust for the money until there
the age in which they give.
Again.
Chair and representative.
What I hear your testimony to
be.
Is that your of waiting.
The sale or the ability to
purchase.
As a want of.
Forty two home.
From my understanding your
argument correctly.
Madam chair representative
Nibert I am stating that a minor
did not purchase are of the if
they are under the age of
eighteen.
Representative Nibert I think
that might you know you're
getting the answer that you
think you're getting so just
proceed with that promise in
your criticism is we don't.
The interpretation isn't as
important as what you make of
the interpretation or madam
chair she just admitted that
purchased or owned were were
were the site there and so you
know madam chair I would submit
to to the committee.
That.
Even though a minor cannot
purchase.
Some of these hand downs some of
these are rifles shot guns.
That does not prohibit them.
And the law does not prohibit
them from owning.
Such.
In fact I would argue that the
constitution.
Does not prohibit that either in
fact I I would argue that they
have a constitutional right to
bear.
Such are.
Well aside I I think we get the
gist of the of the testimony
and.
It appears to me that that the
intention of this legislation is
to
right parents.
Our use of words strictly
liable.
For the activities of their
children with respect to
firearms that are.
Under the auspices of.
Both parents.
The representative would state
state.
Those weapons are held in trust
for the for the child for.
They're responsible for for the
the gains of may be
even though credit services in
here anymore.
Responsible for those guns on
the property in the car as maybe
we talked about the other day
that and what have you.
Yeah that is disconcerting to me
because or work creating crimes
one of which is a felony.
so parents could be prosecuted
for the actions of their
children.
As a result of their.
Taking their possession.
Our our the the.
The the very own for their
parents own for one of the at
the house and that's very
troubling to me.
We do have a couple exceptions.
You have again provisions are
required to be have a locked
container.
So let's look at the bottom of
page two and I'm looking at the
point two two two three five one
point seven I hope that the most
current version of this bill.
Winds twenty four twenty five
and then we'll move over to page
three of the firearm is kept in
a locked container.
And is securely stored or in a
location that a reasonable
person would believe to be
secured what obtained by a
minor.
So.
If I read this correctly the
economic for a parent to be.
Not guilty of these crimes they
were very we would have to prove
that the firearm was in a locked
container.
Long container is securely
stored.
For.
Is in a location that yes people
would believe that the the minor
wouldn't find.
It is out of our good synopsis
of that program.
So.
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
The provision of the statute
that you decided.
Provides.
Some flexibility in terms of
individuals as we discussed the
last time dependent upon.
The various ways and cultures
that people made Stewart R. G.
by the securities store.
And what does that mean are
keeping and then Amanda so that
it's not assessable I might.
And so that's what is
interpreted that is what is
intended and it's meant by.
The.
Representative under section see
to get.
You're on mute Representative
you accidently muted yourself I
think.
Representative Herndon thank you
very much as you did it.
So I would say to you this
record Madam chair
representative my part of as we
talked about the last time this
provision does take into
consideration the various
cultures in the way that
individuals may need items away
from and not assessable I'm I.
Madam chair representative it it
doesn't give you maybe quite the
flexibility is I think because I
see the word and on line twenty
five so that has to be a locked
container in a.
Securely stored or at a location
ideas where you can hide it
So in any case that has to be a
locked container is it am I
reading that correctly.
So what you are seeing is you
see the word and that is
absolutely correct and you also
see the word or and so both of
those been taken together will
indicate that the.
That the of our arms should be
kept in the matter that is not
assessable by a money.
Okay so so madam chair so I I
understand I think a lot of
people looking at this need to
fully understand the so you're
saying the first two.
Revisions are the damn start can
be a locked container securely
stored.
Or or is not connected to
securely store but the course
connected to both lots of data
and securely stored or it
doesn't have to be a lot
container can be at a location
that a reasonable person would
believe to be secure one
obtained by the minor.
So.
Madam chair representative
Nibert so.
In reading paragraphs to say to.
It specifically that state in a
locked container and is securely
stored that's one item are in a
location that is that a
reasonable person would be
secure
when I think about my.
So there is absolutely right in
that provides the flexibility
that we have been discussing
Madam chair representative Matt.
Madam chair I think some
punctuation would.
Be helpful to make the.
To make that distinguishing
because lot container is
connected directly with securely
store and maps one part and then
the second part is the for in a
location so it's not locked
container and is securely stored
or in a location it's a locked
container and securely store.
Or it can be at a location
better reasonable person would
believe so you might think about
some punctuation there to
clarify that and make sure that
people don't read it as I was
initially reading that that that
have to be a lot container under
either circumstance that's not
your jam so I would I would have
said that B. R. clarified
slightly
Then yesterday or the other day
when we talked about the.
Route three
You were discussing that.
If a person had a I think I was
using the budget stand them
under the mattress situation you
Sir well that person's close
enough to it so that
that provision would then come
into affect so you you took care
of those concerns.
madam chair
I think we've we've built in the
most of the other.
Issues that I have on the
remaining page so I will not
repeat myself there again I
remain very concerned about the
We.
Parents strict liability for
actions of another.
And that is a.
we are I'm really willing to
take so thank you madam chair
thank you Representative.
Representative Alcon you're
next.
Thank you madam chair I hope I
can ask there's a Representative
you up.
I'm just going to follow up on
now what Representative night
Burke was asking because I
didn't get the I think I didn't
get the answer that I thought
that I was hoping to get but I
wouldn't have to ask the
question.
Phrase it this way.
If there is a charge on this and
the.
And the prosecutor wants to
approve.
That a minor cannot own a gun in
that too so we're gonna own
we're in statute would he be
able to look this up and show
the judge that that minor and
not owned a gun.
Representative.
I'm sorry madam chair
representative outcome
unfortunately I don't have the
staff to with me that says that
a band could not or are not and
so the money.
And if
it so.
Madam chair representative out
on so I am saying that if we
have we do have that statute in
place and so that what will
happen is that
The individual an individual can
purchase a gun one who is
allowed to do so under law and
if they are purchasing it for to
get it is against our board to
ultimately be inherited it's
still going to still be hoping
that our arms are that within us
into regards to this
That that was okay.
You've already said that three
days of that and the in the and
I understand that I already but
I'm looking at the word this
that and I think Representative
where in statute would you I
that the Miner can not only.
The gun okay I can understand
that by federal statute the
federal law a minor cannot buy a
gun and I can understand that.
But I get a lot of.
The word is.
That's what I'm looking for
where does it say that Miner can
not only.
So Representative Madam Madam
chair representative Nibert if
you're not allow.
To purchase the bad because
you're not of a you can own it
and if you could never purchase
that you can't own it into you
become of age and so we're
looking at the application of
the statue as that exists
currently in New Mexico so that
the person will all the done
when they become of age but
until they become of age it will
be held in trust by the adult or
guardian for them until they
reached a and I Representative
Madam chair representative
Representative outcome it just
seems like this is a matter of
this agreement and I I don't
know what else how else to
address other than the manner in
which I see applying based upon
my my years of service as a
lawyer and apples and apples and
apple global liability and
looking at the law is I think it
would be applied.
Okay
what I understand now is that
there's really no way that the
prosecutor to prove.
That that part of the state of
the law which is where I'm
having problems with this.
But I'll leave it at that thank
you madam chair.
Mr speaker.
Thank you madam chair I.
I
but then chambers are and what
we're I think Representative
I'll call in and never getting
at.
It I have honestly I had the
same question I'm the it is.
If it is if it is unlawful for a
minor to own a firearm.
I've never heard that before I
mean people all over the state
will give a teenager a rifle for
as a Christmas gift.
There's no sale involves but I'm
not aware of anything that says
that and you know I I there are
laws with hand guns.
But I do.
I mean you if there's a law this
is a minor.
The sixteen year old is not
allowed to own a rifle I.
I mean I right before we move on
I think I mean I we need a site
for that because I I'd like to
read that statute and it is a
the point but I think this is
all going as we want to make
sure that we are.
Criminalizing.
The contact that we think we're
criminalizing rate is so if
you've got a.
A sixteen year old who.
Receives arrive was a gift from
a grandparent.
For Christmas hunting rifle.
The rifles now Madam chair in
the home.
It is owned by the sixteen year
old.
And.
Through no con decked what so
ever from the parents.
The parent could be prosecuted.
Under the statute if that rifle
somehow ends up.
In the hands of someone and is
brandished years used to cause
harm to a person.
And I don't think that's the
conduct that we're.
Trying to I I mean maybe there
is a bit just to the point is
like you know what we're trying
to I swear I think the the bills
trying to get at is.
You know if you for my housing
I'll firearms there in my house
I have multi signal several
firearms at home.
I think we're trying to do is is
this laws in the state I mean
the guy he a locked up or I have
to use a device that disables it
like one of those change and one
of those cables that goes
through the barrel in and out
the breach with the padlock on
it so it can't be fired at
ending the padlock.
Like that since that is
intelligible to me
I think they'll be intelligible
to people around the state that
if you got one of these you've
got a weapon in your house and
you got to keep that whatever
disabled so they can be fired
without a key.
This this is other aspect of a
of a rifle to be owned by a
miner in thank you madam chair
point me in the direction of
where we find a law that says
that that that fact pattern is
is unlawful Mr speaker let our
committee analyst address that
would you
please and would you talk about
that.
In the time that we've been
thank you madam chair in the
time that this question has been
raised.
So I want to make that point I
have not done a deep dive on
this.
But it seems to me that the law
discusses
purchase and possession
that ownership is not.
Really a legal term as far as I
can tell
from the federal perspective a
parent or guardian may purchase
a gun for an eighteen for
someone under eighteen but.
The person less than eighteen
years of age may only receive
and possess handguns the
question was firearms the thing
is you guys with the written
permission of a parent or
guardian for limited purposes.
the site is to eighteen USC nine
twenty two it does allow for I
mean I'm happy to do more
research on this but I did want
to clear I think I can
contribute that ownership may
not be in the law.
So
And there is some oversight
expected except in limited
circumstances at least from the
federal perspective regarding a
minors possession of a firearm
the the exceptions in the law
are for things that have been
raised here which are employment
hunting
things of that or or a minor who
might be in the service or
serving somehow.
I hope that helps is just a
little bit.
Mr speaker you have the floor
yeah thank you madam chair I.
Well I mean I I mean maybe I
just sort of following back up
through the practical nature of.
Your wife in New Mexico I mean
I.
I don't I I need I don't feel
like it's an uncommon thing for
a grandparent to give a grand
child a hunting rifle I come
there you know sixteenth
first dare you line it just it
seems like that's something that
happens and.
I find it hard to believe that
that's unlawful.
Madam chair.
We just ask you a question if.
It is is the reckless disregard
standard that is now in this
bill would that still not apply
to those in a supervisory
position of the
The minor with the possession
or.
I guess you said the session but
doesn't only
Would that not apply.
So that there's still an
opportunity here.
Maybe I will imagine actually
you're you're sort of asking
that the other questions going
to ask which is.
If you if madam chair and
representative reported if you
could give us some sense.
Of.
We have with the statue makes
multiple references to keeping
or storing a firearm in a manner
that is in reckless disregard of
the minors ability to access the
fire.
And Madam chair representative
has that it do we see that
phrase.
What we see that language in
statutes in other states.
I'm it madam chair
representative the the question
I've got is so we've got.
Recklessness is is acting in
deliberate disregard for the.
What was this is deliberate
disregard for that.
I received yet another.
Do we have other states that
have used that standard.
In the context of firearms the
storage.
Madam madam chair.
Mr speaker the answer is yes
there are eight other states
that utilize that exact language
and I also just want to point
out to you madam chair Mr
speaker if we look at section
thirty just seven days to point
to the New Mexico since The New
Mexico statutes we talked about
it this term of ownership that
we are now utilizing it is that
term it really is not utilized
within the New Mexico low I'd it
is the term that is utilized
this process or.
Transported by percent of the
eighteen eight it may be to the
statute any handgun possessed or
transported by a person under
nineteen years of age in
violation of the above
prohibition is subject to
seizure and forfeiture by a law
enforcement agency and so what
I'm just saying to you is that
we're looking at the term that
is that is not defined in terms
of our statutes is that looking
at the term ownership but.
I do think that but we are
looking at is the application of
the law in terms of the
automatic can't omit because the
can that be in possessed making
that purchase that they cannot.
Thank.
For themselves until they become
of age because even.
Even if they are in a position
are of transporting it right now
I ended New Mexico statutes good
age nineteen is subject to
Singapore printer by law
enforcement agency and so what
we're saying the purposes of
this statute is if the person
who is responsible for the fire
alarm allows an individual to
access to do with the Bible but
yeah that is used in a manner
that causes great bodily harm or
death.
Than those of the situation that
we're looking at we are
specifically student those
situations where the.
Person responsible for the gun
is allowing its for all sorts of
recreational use and for any
other types of units that are
impermissible while the owner of
the person responsible for the
god is in the presence.
Okay and then thank you madam
chair representative I'm reading
thirty dash seven dash two point
two that statute applies only to
handguns.
So does not apply to rifles so
that that that statute only
applies within the length of the
barrel of the firearm.
Is less than twelve inches.
So you know I eight.
Yeah I guess I'm what I'm sure
struggling with your Madam chair
representative is when we have
criminal statutes before us
typically the elements of the
crime.
Our.
It's like not self defining
rises you know so it's like that
here it says.
That.
The person commits the crime of
recklessly making a firearm
accessible to a minor.
If the person keeps your stores
any firearm in a manner that is
additional reckless disregard
providers ability to access the
firearm.
So recklessly making a firearm
accessible to minor is that one
of the elements is recklessly
making their.
Firearm accessible to a minor.
It doesn't.
I don't know do maybe maybe
chair representative projections
like that looking for another
definition.
Some how in here.
Right.
Yeah you do one thing you know
if.
Your criminal any socially
guilty of you know.
Criminally walking down the
sidewalk if the person is
walking down the sidewalk.
And you know and you know plus
other things right meals biggest
example chair it's just it seems
like somehow circular
There H. is an unusual.
To my it's it's seems like an
unusual way to drafted this.
The manager I don't want to
seven you know I don't want to
belabor the point I I'm happy to
listen to the to the rest of the
of the debate.
Madam chair representative is
our Mr speaker before you go I
would just say to you that
California has utilize.
This type of staff to since two
thousand and ten we have we have
provided a higher standard that
would have to be in place with
this reckless disregard.
California uses the term
necklace which is a lower a
lower standard so we've raised
the standard to a higher
standard so I just point that
out to you.
What the language that we have
used this language that has been
the statutes and and if we look
at the statistics that have been
put forth by the administrative
office of the courts for example
and they talk about those states
that have utilized this type of
statute and that those they
have.
They have considerably reduced
fatalities with respect to
children and the use of those
firearms.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative McQueen.
Thank you.
Chair I just want to.
Explain that how are you this
this law applies in the reckless
disregard senior and that is.
It
right so this is the speaker
what was bringing up the idea of
a grandparent gives a hunting
rifle to a sixteen or seventeen.
I think that that's one
circumstance that you know maybe
wrote we're all comfortable with
especially when you have a you
know the the minor but an older
Miner who's been trained in the
safe use of fire.
and I think there are plans
A different situation if a
grandparent give a hunting rifle
to tenure.
That's probably a bad idea right
they don't have they probably
don't have the same judgment the
same training they might you
know I think there are a lot of
the families that start training
their kids very early but you
know it is sorted and I think
similarly what what I've been
thinking about was
you know it if I have a weapon.
Toddlers in the house and I put
that weapon and on the top
shelf.
That would be sufficient the the
toddlers can't can't get to it
they are aware of it they can't
get you.
It's a different situation if I
have to say a thirteen year old
house is where the economic
engine can access.
It's also a different situation
seven older minor since your
seventeen year old.
Who's maybe exhibiting
antisocial tendencies.
I mean to me the reckless
disregard.
Factors all the.
And and there are with this bill
doesn't do is prohibit.
It doesn't make a crime for a
minor taxes what.
It makes a crime for if the
miner can access the economic.
That access you need that
reckless disregard standard and
the weapon is used the either to
harm someone or to threaten
some.
That's the only way to do it
rises to the level of a crime so
it's certainly possible that you
have a household where.
Isn't that everyone understands
safe and effective use in there
that includes fighters in we're
not actually criminalizing that
unless there are these other
elements so that's just the way
I I've been conceptualizing
this bill the.
Don't know if that helps anyone
but that's the way I think thank
you madam chair.
Thank you.
Are there further questions.
So we have a motion before us
and.
The proper motion and I will
have the quick call the roll.
Representative Alcon
Representative Chandler.
Yes.
Representative Cook no.
Mr speaker.
Yes.
Representative Eli yes.
Representative Lewis.
Yes.
Representative McQueen yes.
Representative Nibert.
Program.
Representative Rehm no.
Representative Townsend no
ma'am.
Yes.
Madam chair.
I do past week I'm sorry by a
vote of seven to five we have a
due passed on house bill nine.
We have a do not pass on house
bill nine in the past on the
committees that.
Thank you very much thank you
for your time.
Okay let's move to a house bill
sixty eight.
Representative Dixon and I don't
know Representative you're gonna
stay with us or I don't know if
you have time.
Welcome to do so and who do you
elevated.
I thank you madam chair if you
could elevate James Grayson as
well as a secretary Jason Bowie.
We have secretary Bali.
I'm not sure I don't see James
Grayson the at.
Here is.
Go ahead Representative.
I thank you madam chair
I am here this afternoon to
introduce house bill sixty eight
and as previously mentioned my
expert witnesses for this bill
our secretary Jason well a with
the department of public safety
W. secretary Ben Baker and also
second judicial district deputy
district attorney James Grayson.
Madam chair we do have an
amendment to introduce and I
don't know what point you'd like
for me to do that if you'd like
for me to talk
About the bill first what would
what I would suggest is that you
give a summary of the bill.
As amended.
As you propose to amend it so
that people are actually
discussing what the committee
will ultimately be discussing if
the amendments adopted.
Okay thank you madam chair so
madam chair and members of the
committee
crime especially violent crime
involving guns continues to rise
in it affects every community in
New Mexico law enforcement has
come to us and said there are
critical gaps in our criminal
code that need to be addressed
in filling these gaps can
improve public safety and ensure
that our criminal laws target
the most dangerous criminals in
our society.
Every year there are more and
more mass threats in tragic mass
shooting AT bone Wrobel
populated places like schools
and businesses.
Unlike other states New Mexico
does not have a criminal threats
statute that would prohibit mask
threats against schools
government buildings or
businesses.
This bill would make a mask
threat a fourth degree felony
and bring New Mexico in line
with other states.
Currently.
Session of a firearm is a third
degree felony regardless of the
type of fell in the person
previously committed.
This bill proposes to
differentiate between felons and
felons who commit serious
and violent offenses.
And it it dresses the extreme
danger posed by serious violent
felons having a firearm.
New Mexico have an effective
firearm enhancement that offers
graduated penalties which
reflect the increased danger
posed by the discharge of a
firearm during a dangerous
crime.
This bill.
Is designed to correct changes
made in twenty twenty that
rendered firearm enhancements
far less useful in curbing gun
violence.
Furthermore existing penalties
for other crimes in New Mexico
such as aggravated fleeing law
enforcement do not reflect the
level of danger they present to
the community for the level of
harm suffered by victims.
This bill response to request
from law enforcement to provide
them with useful tools to
curbing gun violence.
Addressing crime through tougher
penalties is only part of the
solution the other part of the
solution is working to prevent
crime from happening in the
first place and that is why the
budget passed by the house
yesterday is so important.
I'd like to take a moment to
highlight some of the prevention
measures that the legislature
made substantial investments in
including efforts to prioritize
treatment ensure swift and
certain justice.
Cooperation and coordination
among criminal justice partners
and increase resources for law
enforcement courts at pre trial
services.
We're making further investments
in evidence based diversion
programs violence intervention
programs youth employment we're
also supporting victims by
expanding resources for sexual
assault victims of domestic
violence programs and survivors
of human trafficking.
We're making long term
investments in communities by
providing increases for
behavioral health care services
crisis response programs poverty
reduction initiatives secure
housing and transitional housing
recidivism reduction and reentry
programs.
Making our communities safer is
a statewide issue and it
requires both long term and
immediate solutions.
The legislature and governor
committed to addressing this
issue in its entirety and
providing targeted commonsense
solutions so with that madam
chair and members of the
committee I'd like to see if my
experts I would like to say a
few words and then open it up
for questions.
What the and then it would do.
I'm thank you madam chair the
amendment would strike section
three from the original bill or
it's also known as section two
in the amended bill from house.
Consumer and public affairs.
So the committee sob in.
Are you would be striking
section.
So.
In C. pack the the amendment
struck section to and in this
the house Judiciary Committee
substitutes are sorry amendment.
Strikes section three.
And that's that just to clarify
it is the
Unlawful possession of a handgun
that is the section that is
being struck.
On your experts.
Thank you
if Mr Grayson would like to make
a few remarks followed by
secretary belly.
Committee.
Thank you Representative Dixon
my name is James Grayson I'm the
chief deputy district attorney
in the second judicial district.
the DA's office in Albuquerque
strongly supports this bill for
a number of different reasons
and I'll keep my comments fairly
brief but I did want to
highlight section one which is.
I statute that would prescribe
masts threats.
the language in this statute is
consistent with the language and
statutes and other states that
prohibit terroristic threats
from criminals rents.
The first amendment protects
free speech but it does not
protect true threats a true
threat as defined by the United
States Supreme Court is a
serious expression of the
purpose to inflict harm.
In the terms of this bill are
consistent with that standard as
shown by the it's it's similarly
to statutes and other states
that have withstood
constitutional scrutiny.
The goal of this bill is to
prevent school shootings and
other mass shootings.
There's been a suggestion I
believe that the bill should
include the word imminent but
the problem with that suggestion
is that it was two fold first of
all imminent is not required by
the state constitution.
in terms of prescribing a true
threat and second imminent does
not give law enforcement
sufficient opportunity to
prevent school shootings from
happening and that's the goal of
this bill.
Law enforcement currently across
New Mexico it comes together in
a group yes Representative group
to protect our school children
and investigate up to three
threads per week.
Very few of those threats would
be a true threat under this bill
but law enforcement needs to
resources to be able to prevent
true threats from materializing
into a mass shooting.
This will this bill would give
them the resources that they
need in order to protect
children and schools right
warrants and do everything
that's needed to prevent the
crime.
Steve sections in the bill
there's a section on felons in
possession of a firearm which
would increase the penalty from.
A third degree felony to a
second degree felony when
committed by a serious violent
felon.
And firearm enhancements would
which would introduce graduated
penalties based on the way of
firearms used in a crime with a
one year enhancement for use
three year and has been for
brandishing and a five year
enhancement for discharge.
New Mexico has seen a a
significant increase in the
number of firearm crimes as
indicated in the LFC is update
on Bernalillo county crime there
was a fifty percent increase in
gun crimes and shootings in
Albuquerque between two thousand
seventeen and two thousand
twenty.
In addition seventy nine percent
of the harness on the sides in
Albuquerque involved the use of
a gun.
It is very important that our
system have strict penalties
against gun use by dangerous
criminals and in this regard New
Mexico lags behind other states
in the country.
As just one example Delaware.
In Delaware the possession of a
firearm by a felon results
innocence maximum sentence of up
to eight years.
When that firearm is possessed
by a violent felon.
The maximum penalty goes up to
fifteen years and if there's one
prior violent felony there's a
mandatory minimum of three years
if there are two files prior
violent felonies there's a
mandatory minimum of ten years.
Federal law is consistent with
the penalties in Delaware is
much more
Serious in terms of the
penalties that are provided in
federal law that are currently
providing Mexico law.
In this bill targets the most
dangerous criminals in New
Mexico and we take those
criminals off the street and
protect New Mexico citizens.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee.
Representative Dixon did your
what your other witness to
speak.
This.
Yes.
Okay go ahead I'm sure members
of the committee thank you I'll
be very brief a lot of the
Center ready and I grew more of
by the with the introduction you
know this speaks to this bill
speaks to personal
accountability which seems to be
lacking
within the different communities
across the New Mexico as
Representative Dixon indicated
you know law enforcement has
spoken out for what is needed
and I could not agree more the
increase of people in possession
of firearms and using firearms.
Is it really been on the rise
for the last ten years or more
and we we're seeing even in
small communities not suggests
the City of Albuquerque whatever
but let's talk about we're
seeing this impact in
communities across the state of
New Mexico and again this speaks
to the personal accountability
of the of making a decision of
of of this far or ranching
firearms using farm Commission
other crimes and so
yes the only thing this bill and
and and again I don't want to
get too far ahead will be able
to answer any questions
certainly regarding other
sections but law enforcement has
spoken out for that person
accountability and how necessary
it is in order to help with the
reduction of crime we appreciate
appreciate all the social
programs we believe that those
are all well worth it has its
place on the personal side we
feel like we have to advocate
for being for the amendment here
addresses the concerns that were
brought forth other committees
and so we're listening to the
concerns brought forth good
dialogue in order to to
hopefully it's gained support
for this overall so with that I
just closed it saying that the
PS and the strong support of
this bill chair.
Thank you are you ready for us
to go to the public at this
point.
Representative all right we I
just want to tell everyone we're
we've been having a lot of
technical difficulties this year
it just doesn't seem to be just
move one of the things that
happens is when people are
making public comment this is
will this be they disappear or
they become panelists so just to
let you know we're trying to
work this out and so bear with
us we will start with a poll and
ask for the public members who
are in attendance to indicate
whether they support for I do
not support hospitals do eight
so the ball is going to go out
first and then we will take
public comment go ahead.
We have a sixty six today that's
okay your.
Sixty eight discuss.
We've had our twenty second hole
and we have
Ten people in favor and fifteen
against.
There are yes forty in.
Favor and sixty in opposition so
let's go to the
Let's go to the public comment
and I would like to ask you to
limit your comments to.
No more than a minute and please
make it shorter if you can we
have a long complex engine.
All righty
Let's go first Derek's got.
Madam chair members of the
committee yeah I was one of
those people that that messed up
and pulled up to.
But I appreciate I'm sorry guys
having technical difficulties
anyways I would like to speak to
the fact of yes he said he
believes that imminent threat
would not help but I am speaking
also on behalf of my wife who
works and says and she spoke to
this in the other committee
where she has children are
socially emotionally pretty
messed up and that they make
threats on the continuous basis
that you know as she was
suggesting and I will continue
suggest again is that maybe we
need to get the authority to the
schools to assess that threats
and they give it to the proper
authorities because if you have
kids are making idle threats
just to be mean or bad towards a
teacher or whatever or to get
the teacher in trouble it it's
going to put a lot of burden on
schools with this bill and I
think there needs to be some
raise king about how to
implement the schools with this
bill and that's the other
problem is built kind of an arm
in this pool fill it it's got
all these other issues that are
actually involved with each
other.
One of them is you know section
three and our sorry not section
three sorry the section passed
section one and so there was six
to those struck down section one
you know should be separated
into another bill and discussed
in that way but I appreciate you
guys listening to me and thank
you guys for taking the time
have a great day.
Thank you we have the time.
There we go.
I want the speakers to be able
to see the timer so that they
know when they're getting close
hi Kim Chavez Cook.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee Kim Chavez Cook
with the law offices of the
public defender that we have
serious concerns about the
penalty implications of this
bill and would emphasize that to
the penalties for felony
possession and the fireman hats
that scheme we're both increased
it multiple times for felon in
possession just in the last two
sessions already and we have yet
to see what impact that might
have if any on public safety
before amending it again to
increase those penalties again
my primary concern with the
firearm enhancement increased
being that it changes the
discretion of the judge to make
it a mandatory prison
enhancement which was something
that was changed specifically
unconsciously in the last
amendment that increased the
duration so that's a serious
concern for us be what want
judges to have the discretion to
suspend its time in appropriate
cases I also wanted to mention
that the aggravated fleeing
statute change is unnecessary as
we already have separate crimes
on the books to address injuries
that result from our car
accidents thank you.
JD Bullington.
Did you go ahead.
All right let me go to Elizabeth
Hans.
Go ahead Liz with.
I'm here.
One.
Yes I'm here now last time you
all to remain completely on the
meeting but we started talk now
The I'm a criminal defense
attorney here in Albuquerque and
I would just speak as to the
enhancements on those sentencing
scheme.
At your want to take people off
the street but we don't have
enough room to house people as
it is and it's a bit be a boon
for private
for private prisons I suppose
but criminals don't obey laws I
say this every time I speak I
don't really think that it's
going to be a deterrent like
miss cook said we have yet to
determine the impact from the
last increase but now I will
move toward the aggravated
fleeing statute and what you've
done in there as you propose to
take out of in a marked vehicle
and so if you want to protect
women I mean.
Women driving down a dark road
and there's a car with lights
but but they don't they're not a
properly marked vehicle I don't
know about you but I'm not going
to pull off until I'm in a safe
area so I think that that does
not need to change your trying
to get around case law on that
one and I would just urge you to
vote no at this time thank you.
Fraser.
You can see the last page.
Go ahead you're on mute.
We need to do.
Go ahead and speak.
We'd love to speak.
You just have the phone.
I.
Thanks to everyone we are having
technical difficulties this year
I'm very very sorry.
We could hear you then can you
speak.
But else concern.
We could hear you could you
speak.
I'm gonna go to somebody else we
don't seem to be able to
communicate.
Campos.
Good evening chair and members
of the committee my name is
embossed the manager with bold
futures and we oppose H. B.
sixty eight New Mexico is deeply
impacted by gun violence so when
violence has had a huge impact
on the lives of New Mexican
families.
Analgesia of not provincially
discussed violence in these did
not address the root causes of
violence.
Significant recent update in the
use by young people in New
Mexico we must address the
reasons why people are speaking
outcomes.
When the impact is the quality
health care mental health care
substance recovery programs
housing and many other forms of
support and even gun control
policies that can only reduce
gun violence.
But in keeping our youth safe.
All these procedures like HP
sixty simply drive more young
people into our criminal legal
system we ask that you please
vote against H. Q. sixty eight
thank you.
Thank you next I have Rikki Lee
Chavez.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee Rikki
Lee Chavez legislative
coordinator for the New Mexico
from all defense lawyers
association we respectfully
stand in opposition to house
bill sixty eight we do
appreciate the work of the house
Appropriations Committee as the
house to address the
shortcomings of programs that
seek to curtail up crimes from
being committed and reinvesting
in our communities I believe
that the provisions in this bill
however go against that work
when you increase penalties or
take away discretion from our
judicial body you're you're on
you're undoing some of that work
and we would encourage this body
to oppose this measure
increasing penalties has no data
to support that actually reduces
crime from happening and I
believe is one of my colleagues
pointed out we did just amended
K. have the same statutes not
but two years ago so data is
most likely forthcoming on to
the effect of that increase
thank you for your time bye.
Barron Jones.
Go ahead.
did you actually go to die in
the cash because I just thought
of things and we've myself I
don't know why I'm sure I
actually called and Barron Jones
yeah I heard you when
I called on him and allow him to
talk it jumps to the next person
I was so tired and I apologize
to consisting and there.
So can you all hear me I'm my
name is Barron Jones a good
afternoon madam chair members of
the committee my name is Barron
Jones and senior policy
strategist for the ACLU of New
Mexico unfortunately I
understand the pain empathize
with the supporters of this
legislation haven't survived are
more res carjackings and the
witness in the murder of my
older brother and while we
appreciate that ten of the
sponsor we respectfully oppose
H. B. Sixtyeight are a personal
reasons and on behalf of the
ACLU of New Mexico and is more
than thirty thousand civil
liberties advocates for the many
reasons stated the members of
this legislative work really
hard in recent years to have
taken steps to pass correctable
also reduce mass incarceration
this bill try to stand do that
great work no only ways be sixty
eight the best lied to us are
increase in our state's prison
and jail public population we're
also result in a sizeable
increase in operational costs
for those facilities money that
could be invested affordable
housing be able health services
and upper at first that have
known to have positive impact on
crime we X. you all to vote no
on this bill and thank you and
excuse the cruise.
Thank you we'll do dynamic
HANBIDGE.
Thank you it's it is tempting to
think that the measures in this
bill which to provide you crime
increased prison time will make
us measurably safer but there's
little to no evidence to suggest
that increasing the penalties we
already had in place will make a
difference and it really would
be expensive actual evidence not
just my anecdotal experience and
seeing the diminished returns as
my son's incarceration lingered
indicate that longer periods of
incarceration after point
actually increases recidivism
and worsens outcomes almost
everyone will come out of prison
and it would behoove us to do
what we can to have the best
outcomes for them and for us or
the community they return to I
know that you all have our well
being at heart I heard you many
many times and I appreciate you
for that I would urge the
committee however to vote no one
H. B. Sixtyeight and think more
critically about measures that
might actually increase
community safety I wish adding
more punishment could fix all
this but I don't believe it can
thank you.
Terry called.
Good afternoon madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Terry Cole I am the president
and CEO of the greater
Albuquerque chamber of commerce
I am speaking in support of the
bill madam chair businesses and
residents of Albuquerque support
this legislation because it's
addressing the very problems we
see each state repeat dangerous
balance loaded down with guns
and a disregard for human life
drug deals that are wrapped into
shoot outs among young armed men
or where weapons turn drug deals
into robberies these are real
problems we must get illegally
held firearms and those who use
them off our streets as our
please check often says some
offenders have no regard for law
enforcement or innocent life we
have to make New Mexico a much
tougher place for these
criminals to live we're also
supported this bill because it
would make threats of mass
violence hate crime and keep
threats away from our schools
thank you so much for allowing
me to speak madam chair members
of the committee we are urge
your support thank you.
JD Bullington.
I hope you can speak the minute
I say your name you disappear.
One it under yourself and talk
and see if we could hear you.
Well I don't I don't even have
J. D. on the screen anymore.
Asalem a grant Scott.
Go ahead.
Hello my name is Sushma Prescott
I am a opposed to this bill I'm
a says one educator social
emotional supports for children
and I also believe that what we
are doing in the classrooms in
the front lines is trying to
educate our children and keep
them safe and because that's our
number one job it takes a
village to raise a child and it
takes a community to support and
a new witness and say Hey what's
going on how can I help you I
think putting up laws and
barriers is keeping us from
having those good communications
and those skills to help each
other bill New Mexico better.
Keeping kids from.
And helping them doesn't help
any you know hoping that helps
them a much better education and
having this bill is going to
hinder that I don't believe in
clean hand cuffs but having a
better communication skills
teaching them loving them
showing that we are there to
help them that's what services
that's what I'm all about thank
you have a great day.
Thank you on.
K. Gardner.
Thank you madam chair members
committee keep order rest
lobbyist for yes.
National shooting sports
foundation which is the national
trade association for gun
manufacturers and dealers and I
just want to publicly thank the
sponsor specifically we we work
with her through some of the
concerns early on in the bill
and she's been great work west
on getting those concerns
Romero.
On behalf of the organization we
believe it's important that the.
People that have weapons are
those that should have a may not
criminals and when criminals do
have a system as was said
earlier criminals don't always
follow the law but they should
be punished for not following
the law and this is important in
making sure that those who break
our laws.
Or held accountable we
appreciate again the sponsor and
hope you'll vote yes for this
piece legislation thank you
madam chair.
Thank you Jamie Frasier page
will try again you're ready
you're able to if you're able to
talk we we can hear you.
Madam chairman you you hear me
now.
Yes all right.
I'm not going to rehash a bunch
of things other people said but
in my experience law enforcement
officer.
In California you had to have a
marked vehicle it was clearly a
police car in order for people
to be expected stop for you and
in this state where red and blue
lights appear on all manner of
vehicles just a red and blue
light alone is not enough it
should be clearly marked as a
law enforcement vehicle and be
driven by uniformed officers.
On the issue of enhancements in
my experience as a law
enforcement officer in
California.
And I find it is the same here
enhancements almost always end
up on the floor in a plea
bargaining session they very
seldom and up in the final
version of the charges leveled
against a criminal so if you're
gonna make it work it's going to
actually have to make it all the
way to the courtroom and be part
of the final charges thank you
for your time and I'm sorry for
all of your technical
difficulties.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
We're not looking for sympathy
we wish it would just work I
think we have some public
comment in our committee room
and there on the panel and Amit
Shah there's some of the panel
so it's has three oh nine and
you're welcome to speak at this
time.
There is no one here okay there
there was.
We were.
Already all right now we're
going to go back to the
committee I think we've taken
everybody's comments thank you
all for being pre I appreciate
it.
Will be
Representative Dixon with your
amendment.
And so we'll discuss that.
I believe we
should round would you read the
two oh two number please.
Thank you madam chair two two
two three eight five point two.
Want to.
Would you discuss the amendment.
Thank you madam chair I'm this
ammendment the house Judiciary
Committee amendment proposes to
strike section three from the
original so on page one line
twelve after the semi colon
struck the remainder of the line
and strike line thirteen through
the semi colon.
On page three through five
strike.
Section two in its entirety and
that's too because it was
remembered after the amendment
the prior amendment and then
item number three is remember
the succeeding sections
accordingly.
Will move the just got the
amendment for discussion
purposes and Representative
reading had told me he had a
question.
I beg your pardon.
Madam chair and Representative
Dixon I appreciate it we've been
trying to work together and get
a committee set up or one there
are larger amendment I want to
talk about section three so I
and one twenty one.
What we have is.
You know when we're if it's not
amended and I think we have an
opportunity to fix a couple
things that we should fix so on
page five one twenty one it
speaks about the
a person going to a get our
target range and it has to be a
target range authorized by a
government body our problem is
that kids out in the country you
know dad's got a range right
down there well Ryan they go
down there and shoot and I think
what we need to do is make this
you know law for target shooting
and I showed
Representative Dixon that one.
On page six.
When we look at the exceptions
over here we need another are
probably Warren seventeen added
new section we have.
You know kids that are routed.
Movie set sure doing employee or
something like that that have
why guns are real guns and
with miss mistakes and she's
agreed to change this back to a
misdemeanor.
But I think we need to fix those
two points there.
Madam chair I think the rest of
my questions would be on the
bill but
One of the things that this
committee has always been proud
about is that we fix the bill
before we send it out rather
than send it out and try to fix
it somewhere else down the line.
That's why I think we should be
I think that we ought to fix
those provisions while we have a
chance thank you madam chair and
then I'll have questions of the
bill later.
To be clear Representative Rehm
are you saying that you're
opposed to this amendment
because it doesn't do what you
want to do is I'm just because
you read this and other issues
that are in the amendment so
help me out.
Yeah madam chair what what I
think is we have an opportunity
to clean up the land again
languages and existing law and I
think we should clean up that
language that exception so I
think this committee chair.
Understand that
you know I I realize she's taken
it out of the bill but we have
an opportunity to fix current
law and not end up having some
kid getting arrested for doing
something that should be lawful.
That's my point.
So she's proposing to delete
section three and that's where
you think there needs to be an
amendment I'm to forgive me but
that's what your point is.
Madam chair that's correct I
think that we should fix.
The current statutes match the
thirty dash seven dash two point
two
Well we well we have a chance.
Thank you.
Amendment is there other
discussion on the amendment.
Sure.
The
right hand.
But I have in Denver for a
couple days to to just make sure
I understand
All these amendments that I was
looking at the amendments and
contacts
hello I understand that you
madam chair and representative
your original section one is
impact and then you skip all the
way to the original section for
which will now be section two
years is up my understanding
because you believe that the
original sections two and three.
Thank you madam chair should the
committee adopt this proposed
amendment you would be correct.
Okay that was my only question
madam chair and thank you for
bringing that a member
Representative.
So is there for the discussion
on the amendment.
Okay I do have a question and
and I may have misunderstood and
as you know we have some
deadlines here today and so on
my attention a little bit
divided
someone mentioned that the
It's meant has now been made
mandatory is it being made
mandatory in this ammendment or
in your bill.
Thank you madam chair not in the
amendment that would apply
that's a in the bill itself okay
thank you.
Do have a motion on the
amendment.
Will move to adopt the
amendment.
Also director.
Thank you Representative
So we're on a mission to adopt
the amendment and I will have
asked the court to please call
the roll.
Representative Alcon.
Yes.
Representative Chandler yes.
Representative Cook.
Yes.
Mr speaker.
Representative Ely yes.
Representative Lewis yes.
Representative McQueen yes.
Representative Nibert yes.
Representative Rehm no ma'am.
Representative Townsend.
No.
I'll.
Madam chair.
Yes.
There.
Excuse me
ninety two we have the amendment
is adopted.
Okay we're not the date of the
bill as amended.
And.
One of discussion on the bill.
First it's either representative
Albert Representative Rehm.
Madam chair I'll go first.
So on the last section Mrs page
eleven.
Section six when we start
looking at this so I had a
couple questions one is I think
it could be written in a and
better one which I think that
it's a little bit rough the way
that it's written on.
Fourteen.
And
probably Lorino economic we need
to answer something that shows
if if the firearm and stolen it
will be returned to the owner.
It just says this will for for
but I think we ought to make it
clear that the stolen property
would be returned.
And I don't know how the.
Representative Dixon feels about
that.
Wonder if the secretary might
address that as well there may
be procedures.
Thank you madam chair if.
Deputy district attorney grace
and could answer first and then
if secretary but we has
additional insight.
the the bill refers to the
forfeiture Act and the
forfeiture Act was significantly
amended in two thousand fifteen
to include substantial
protection for for innocent
owners so a stolen firearm would
be returned to the innocent
order in that situation.
Thank you madam chair but
Mr race and I hear that that's
not always the occurrence and I
just want to make sure that it
was clear in this legislation.
That that would be a.
Okay thank you madam chair I
still think this means a lot of
means a little more work before
we send it out.
Representative Nibert did you
wish to debate the bill.
No ma'am okay.
Representative Ely you're next.
Yes thank you madam chair so
I do have questions about
as I'm looking at this under
section five.
So
I think the thing I I I I do I
have to be candid and I I it is
a kind of pitch two parts of me
against one another where on the
one hand
all of the data shows that
severity of sense is not a
deterrent to crime on the other
hand these are people that have
been convicted and I really hate
I think guns frankly have been a
scourge in our community and
this notion that it's making our
society safer is just not
supported by anything I'm seeing
or any data on the other hand
I do worry that we are taking
away from judges any discretion
so in other words and and that
is getting away from what we
have been going towards so I
want to ask the sponsor looking
at section I I just want to see
if this is right.
It has so first time firearm
offender charged with a third
degree felony
and no prior felonies this is
under current law would be
facing three years and did three
years the firearm enhancement
that's for total six years but
under this bill.
that enhancement would be four
years for possession six years
for brandishing and eight years
for discharging the weapon and
the enhancement must be spent in
prison so taking away any
discretion from the sentencing
judge and I'm wondering if
that's what you intended or if
you would want to build back in
some ability of the judge to use
is you know you would still of
the sentence but the judge could
suspend some or all of that
in lieu of probation
and I'm trying to figure out do
we really intend to get back to
kind of mandatory sentences
because I don't think that's
where you're getting at and I'm
just curious if you look at
that.
Thank you at.
Madam chair and members of the
committee if I'm at first like
to have I Mr Grayson respond to
the they years and that
component of the question.
Representative you know I thank
you for question I I don't quite
understand I think there's just
one part of the question I'm
missing and that is that correct
calculation starts with three
years is that based on an
aggravated battery or what would
be the offense I'm looking at a
first time firearm offender
charged with a third degree
felony firearm fans and no prior
felonies that would be three
years for the felony and three
years of understanding right for
the firearm enhancement.
For a total of six years by
under the current provision that
is correct yes that's under
current law but based on what
we're looking at under SB sixty
eight it would be this is again
an enhancement four years for
possession six years for
brandishing an eight years for
discharging the weapon
I'm sorry I'm sorry that's
that's that's current and then
the enhancement I'm sorry and
then the enhancement would be
one year for possession three
years for brandishing for five
years for discharge right.
I said that right away yes that
the enhancement would be one
three or five depending on how
the firearm is used in the
course of crime if it's you if
it's a use which was the former
statute for enhancements under
thirty one eighteen sixteen good
formerly said used as opposed to
brandishing if it were used it
would be one your enhancement
just like it used to be before
the amendment in two thousand
twenty if it were brandished it
would be three years like the
currently is and if it were
distortion would be five years
which is.
Similar to how federal law
graduates the punishment based
on how the firearms used.
But but I guess my question
madam chair and sponsor and an
expert on Schecter Gration I I'm
trying to find out are we were
moving any discretion from the
judge to suspend all part of
that sentence.
That is correct in the language
of the bill it does say is that
sin shall not be the enhancement
part portion of the sins shall
not be suspended or deferred I
mean is that something I I'm I'm
support don't get me wrong I'm
supportive of the bill this
strikes me as very different
from House Bill five were
locking people up that admin
convicted of anything but it is
moving away from this
particular and in this in the
next section are moving away
from we are we have been going
the governor and the legislature
in terms of getting away from
mandatory prison time and so I'm
I I would want to know it does
seem like the bill is doing a
lot of things and I'm wondering
if this is one of those things
that you know the sponsor and
and and you could discuss giving
some ground on because I do
think philosophically
We want to give the judge some
discretion don't we I mean in
certain circumstances visit I
mean possession alone I could
see a lot of people having
problems you know guns are I
mean I can't believe I'm saying
this but gun rights advocates
would would have some problems
with just mere possession where
you've got to spend a year in
prison and the judge doesn't
matter what the circumstances
are you're done you go to prison
and I'm just wondering how
what's the right word for it
how strongly you feel that that
has to be in this bill and if so
why why are we moving away from
giving the judge discretion and
back towards mandatory
sentencing which I thought we
were trying to get away from.
Mr Grayson would you like to
answer first and then I'll time
in.
Madam chair representative I I
understand the question I think
it's it's of the general concern
I think it was a concern of this
body in two thousand twenty when
amending thirty one eighteen
sixteen because at that time
before that time it was a
mandatory penalty so that that
the amendment in two thousand
twenty increase the punishment
to three years but mated
discretionary instead of
mandatory and
Representative Ely is correct
that research indicates that
severity of punishment is less
influential as a deterrent Dan
swiftness and certainty the
benefit of mandatory sentencing
is it's a certain punishment.
The problem with discretionary
sentencing is that it's not
certain punishment so if someone
has a firearm and uses that
firearm in the course of a
dangerous felony because that's
that's a do an additional change
in this bill is that it's
limited to dangerous very
dangerous crimes.
whereas the the pre two thousand
twenty so version of this law
apply to all felonies in the
current law applies to all
felonies this would apply only
to serious violent felonies
aggravated burglary and what
we've really seen a problem with
it especially in Albuquerque is
drug reps we've had a number of
homicides as well as a number of
aggravated batteries and armed
robberies that have been based
on drug rips and so that's a
particular problem that that
plagues the state and this bill
would target those very
dangerous crimes and tell those
those individuals who are
willing to commit those very
dangerous crimes with a firearm
there's going to be certain
punishment if you do this.
Madam chair and Representative
Ely the other thing that I would
add is that the judge does still
have discretion on the
underlying charge.
Right and I in and madam chair
and representative a yeah I
appreciate that and I I if I
have made that clear I I think
that's a fair point but he's
still is it's kind of the
camel's nose under the tent
where we're really going back to
something that I think we all
have agreed is not a good idea
and that is taking discretion
away from judges I mean I think
hi I'm hi I mean I have to
confess I am really conflicted
about the entire bill but I'm
supportive of it but this one
causes me real concern this and
the next section where you've
got you know under current law
and I'm just looking at our
first time third degree firearm
offender with a prior felony
six years plus a one year
enhancement under section five
it becomes eight years eleven
years for brandishing thirteen
years for discharge the
enhancements again are one three
and five years and must be spent
in prison and I just I'm I'm
wondering why in this
circumstance and only this
circumstance are we taking
discretion away from of course
when we are said in the past and
we are going to more and more
and by the federal system doing
the same getting away from kind
of these mandatory minimums
where the judges no matter what
the factual circumstances if you
fall within certain boxes that's
where you're going to prison and
there's just I mean I I really
do worry about that because the
other thing that the research
shows C. as prison isn't exactly
a great place to be sending
people if you want them to
become less dangerous when they
come out they certainly become
more dangerous and don't we want
the court to consider that.
We and the enhancement is
imposed and there's no choice
the judge doesn't have any
discretion no matter what's
going on and I just want to know
how critical that component is
that kind of mandatory
sentencing is to this bill
is that something that
sponsor
would consider taking a look at
before it hit the floor in terms
of looking at
you know amending the bill I
realize you know this would have
to come back and I I don't want
to do that I I know everybody
wants to move the bill forward
but I am curious as to why is
this different from anything
else you know what I mean and
that that's my concern both the
the person the first time
offender and the person with
prior felony why is the
enhancement certainly different
than everything else the coat.
Representative Ely rather than
asking them to answer I think
there might be some other
committee members.
They might want to hear from and
they're going to hear the same
thing from me.
And so.
It's an issue for me with
supporting the bill and I'm like
you that helped to try to assist
with this so if there are others
who want to engage in that
particular dialogue would you
mind if perhaps they think about
that we can you can still hold
the floor when we come back to
it yup madam chair I'm fine with
that I really am I was just
about done that is that is my
critical concern is the
mandatory sentencing.
Next I have Representative
Chandler.
Representative Chandler you need
on mute.
Yes two years in and here we go.
Thank you madam chair
They have a first just a few
questions in terms of how we got
to where we are
There is a there's a lot of work
being done in the state that's
looking at our criminal justice
system and providing evidence
based information and collecting
that information I think the
group is called safe essay the
S. A. F. P. and they have brief
courts corrections and justice
periodically
about how to address crime and
making make recommendations so
for us hasn't have any of the
panelists here had an
opportunity to consult with safe
in terms of their
recommendations as to how to
address the upswing in crime in
the state and most particularly
in the Albuquerque area.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative Chandler I would
defer to Mr Grayson or I'm
secretary but we I can say that
in the over the summer during
the course of the Albuquerque
metro crime initiatives
conversations a whole wide range
of folks were included and so
representatives from that
organization may have been part
of it.
Okay.
Mr Grayson did anyone reach out
from your organization to talk
with the state for the defense
bar to see what ideas they might
have in terms of addressing
crime certainly there is that
they have a lot of interaction
with
people who are charged with
crimes and and may have some
excellent suggestions that
happen.
Sure Representative Chandler
thank you for your question I
think it's important for
everyone else stakeholders and
system to have a state and to to
be able to express their views I
think as Representative really
Representative Dixon said I
think that was the goal behind
the measure prime initiatives we
did not specifically reach out
to state for the defense of our
it as far as I know with respect
to the terms of of this bill
but we certainly are interested
in an evidence based approach
and I think some of the logic
behind this bill particularly
with the mandatory sentencing
comes out of the National
Institute of justice
evidence that the two to five
percent of offenders in our
system are responsible for more
than fifty percent of the crime
and I would defer to secretary
Bali for his personal experience
with that.
Madam chair for me.
Madam chair members of the
committee
Yes absolutely I think to answer
Representative he lies question
you know as to why madam chair I
think we're on my question
Representative Chandler.
Okay.
And your question know during
the Mr crime initiative we did
not reach out that I'm aware of
this magical mischief was
Started at the although my first
I was literally my first day in
office and that was under way
and I know that the.
That particular.
One of.
Thank you for the answers I
interpret those answers to mean
that was no specific content to
include the defense are or safe
in any of these discussions
It's disappointing there are a
lot of people Sir about
I'm reduction of crime and
relying on everyday evidence
based
Which is to
Addressing crime so there are
not repeat offenders etcetera
etcetera and I think frankly we
would have and and more creative
L. had that occurred
If you look at like this is deja
vu all over again madam chair
and committee members
Before being elected to the
house so I was an analyst for
Senate judiciary for four years
under and then the Martinez
administration and we were
seeing proposals like this on a
regular basis and routinely
pointing to the fact that these
sorts of initiatives.
Very little impact on crime and
we would frequently right
analyses that pointed to sorts
of things that some of the
presenters have already
acknowledged madam chair which
is.
With with apprehension swift
prosecution as with punishment
is the best way to address crime
and my way of thinking and I
think we have begun to do a
little bit of that in our most
recent budget and maybe have
some previous budget.
And in terms of funding programs
that would help us do that.
What we need is a justice system
that is fully funded.
That has a sufficient number of
police officers to make
And to make an impact on on the
crime that is occurring that
those individuals who are guilty
of such crimes are promptly
arrested we need
increase resources for our
prosecutors
well that was prosecutors can
develop the cases adequately and
ensure that there are problems
education we need to support our
judicial system in a way that
courts can hear these cases
promptly and ensure that
everyone receives a fair trial
if we need to expand our public
defender resources as well to
ensure that those accused of a
crime adequate representation
and I've seen very little
discussion by it any of those.
Members of the community or
leaders in the community
yes you want to really seriously
address crime issue is occurring
in our state for sure but we
also know that this is a trend
across the country it's not
unique New Mexico there are
numerous articles written on a
regular and constant basis and
some of us might want to know
why that is because if we know
why that is perhaps we can look
to ways to try to address the
underlying reasons instead of.
Going back to tried and kind of
tired approaches to addressing
the sorts of things it occurred.
Five years ago when we were
under another administration.
Occurred in the nineties and
it's a period of time when the
federal government and maybe the
states I wasn't just this in of
what was going on in terms of
addressing crime down but
certainly during the Clinton
administration.
there was a big push on the
federal level to enhanced
penalties increase the number of
crimes
advocate for mandatory sentence
sentencing and the light that
occurred in California we know
and in Texas and other states
and the outcomes were poor.
Very poor and what they did was
they increased prison population
that's true the increase the
expenses to the state and they
had very little impact on
addressing the root causes of
crime and this is I know this.
Not as expansive as those
activities were but I fear along
with Representative Eli we're
we're
retreating to a to a worn out
approach that has proved to be
unsuccessful in in the long term
and that's what we really need
to be thinking about and I do
very much appreciate the fact
that people are frustrated and
my dear friends Representative
Dixon is make doing her best to
try to find an approach that
will work but I have to say
having worked on these issues
for some period of time and
participated in many discussions
about what works this is the
least likely approach to
addressing crime in any
systematic way
and I have to echo concerns
about then this is a mandatory
sentencing again this was one of
these events that occurred in
the nineties it's one of these
fall back things that this is
going to make make things better
it also is an indication I think
from those who advocate for that
they don't trust our judges and
I do trust are judges to make
decisions based on the facts of
each individual case and I would
not I would vote against this
bill just on the basis of that
not withstanding my other
concerns about enhancement
increasing the number of crimes
cetera so you might I'm sorry to
be
A naysayer but.
The data is just not there for
this kind of thing it's it's
just not there and I haven't
heard any member of the panel
actually present data.
That that will indicate that
they have a reasonable belief to
think that it will that this
will will address what I agree
is a very important and serious
issue for our state and our
country with that madam chair
I'll I'll yield the floor.
Trying to figure out if there
are more hands from committee
members on yes Representative
McQueen thank you.
Thank you madam chair.
I appreciate the comments of my
colleagues
Representative Ely and it
Representative Chandler.
General as concerns about.
hello these without.
Singh and everyone because also.
I heard some concerns from
members that remain but some
fine tuning also heard concerns
an audience about you know did
we just do this and.
This year the legislature and I
think there are are enhancements
probably every year up in here
so I I you know I was concerned
about those I also had since
specific
Drafting concerns.
I could ask those.
In the Madam chair
representative six and.
We've we've already talked about
some of these but I I would like
to the.
To revisit them.
first of all just just side
because I'm not a criminal law
attorney
the better the feel for things
the the second third fourth
three faux only what what are
the.
With the years of incarcerations
associated with each level of
those.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative McQueen I'm gonna
defer to Mr Grayson for this I
have a I think I know the answer
but rather than.
We can potentially answer
correctly I'll defer to him.
Green thank you for your
question so a second degree
felony is punishable by nine
years a first degree felony
which I don't believe was part
of the representative question
but the first first degree
felonies punishable by HB years
which is actually mandatory.
a third degree felony is
punishable by three years and a
fourth degree felony is
punishable by eighteen months
there are some exceptions to
those that are stated in in
specific statutes budgets as a
general rule those of the
penalties that apply under
section thirty one eighteen
fifteen.
Okay thank you for that that's
that's useful
Madam chair of the
Representative Dixon and
possibly Mr Grayson at the
bottom of page nine.
There's the the serious violent
felon.
which is
In order to force for some of
these if they are serious
by the on the the county isn't
in the hands
if they have again.
how.
How's that the term in this
year's by the all of the status
is that.
The question because before the
jury or is that
If they have again in.
They're convicted the that the
obsession they plead guilty to
it or they're convicted of it
this is the court then look at
their record in determine
whether or not they are you
serious violence.
Sorry I didn't quite catch that
could you please.
I'm talking to that's weird
okay.
So the question is essentially
is it jury question or is it
this accord  I I I just don't
know how that gets processed.
Queen the under the bill
The for the felon in possession
of a firearm section which is
section five.
Our Under the amended version it
would be re number this section
three.
it that section is determined
by an individual's criminal
history so they would have had a
prior felony conviction that
would be deemed to be a serious
violent felony based on that the
crime that they committed.
that crimes they committed may
have been Sir response only per
se under section thirty three to
thirty four the meritorious
deductions Act or it may have
been a crime that a judge
designated as a serious violent
felony under section thirty
three to thirty four L. four OO.
Such as aggravated assaults
first or third degree child
abuse some of those crimes are
discretionary series but on the
fences so if an individual for
example committed first degree
child abuse because it was child
abuse that resulted in in death
or great bodily harm and the
judge designates that as a
serious violent felony then that
would become serious violent
felony and for that for purposes
of that individual's criminal
history under section remember
It section three under section
remember It section for however
the fireman has been provision
that is not something that would
be determined by the judge that
is it lists the crime it it
refers to the crimes listed in
section thirty three to thirty
four L. for.
And does not require judicial
findings and so your there has
been I think some questions
raised about whether there are
plenty issues with that section
but because there's no
requirement of a judicial
finding there's no issue in
terms of basically the jury is
finding all of the elements of
the crime because the jury's
finding that the individual
committed the underlying crime
that is listed in section thirty
three to thirty four and the
jury's also finding beyond a
reasonable doubt that a fire
farms involved in the crime.
Yes so I did all of that
I need a simpler answer.
The is the jury determining that
there are serious violent felon
and wondered my reading of this
is that.
We're we're part of playing.
Hostilities so you arrest
someone for having a gun at some
point in the past they have been
found guilty of a of a serious
violent felony is that
information presented to the
jury or does the jury need to
make that determination.
Representative we know for
purposes of the re numbered
section three which is still in
possession of a firearm that
crime will be a serious violent
felony based on a past
conviction so the present jury
deliberating on the crime of
felon in possession of a firearm
will determine whether the
individual was convicted of a of
a prior felony and whether that
individual had a firearm in
their possession but the jury
doesn't determine whether it's a
serious financial.
That's determined by the nature
of the previous felony and
whether it qualifies as a
service from Tony
because it's listed in the
meritorious to start two
directions Act.
And I apologize for for the
confusing answer.
But
I got your answer is confusing I
just think it was technical
It is
essentially the same question
again chair Mister isn't.
Is the question of whether they
are serious violent felon
presented to the jury.
Or is it determined by prior
evidence.
Prior conviction and if it is
determined by prior conviction
is that information given to the
poor.
Representative green are you
it's determined by the prior
conviction.
And so the jury would determine
whether that that person has
been convicted of a felony and
whether they are in possession
of a firearm.
Madam chair Mister Christian but
is the jury who's determining
whether or not the persons in
possession of a firearm are they
given the information that the
person had a prior violent
felony conviction.
Here Representative McQueen the
jury is given information that
the.
I apologize so to the the
original jury that this person
goes before right this is a
regional jury when they commit
series from Sony that jury finds
the elements of the crime that
that make up the series.
So the jury does find those
elements future jury however
only determines whether that
individual was in possession of
a firearm and so that is and
the the felony itself the nature
of the film you something that
would be subject to a judicial
ruling in terms of the admission
of evidence but to jury would I
determine whether that
individual was in possession of
a firearm.
The queen also are committee
analyst and everyone has heard
analysis may lie like to address
this issue so I'd like to let
her do that would you mind for a
moment go ahead and.
Chairwoman Casey and Mr Grayson
and Representative McQueen I
just worry stay with Mr Grayson
is saying maybe in a way and so
please Mr Grayson correct me if
I'm wrong in the way I restate
it but
There are a shell having been a
felon in possession is one
element of the crime and it does
have to be proved it's often
proved by a record a past record
showed to be number one to be a
felon it has to be proved but
it's not usually are difficult
to prove with the past record
then whether it's it of fell and
whether the felony of the prior
conviction was a so you're
considered serious files only
that is also based on the past
record the defendant can dispute
it but sometimes the defendant
and this is the part Mr Gration
please correct me sometimes a
defendant won't dispute that
because they don't necessarily
want the record.
The what that past felt they
just they want to do this okay
for the jury to know that there
are falling but they don't
necessarily want the felon the
jury to know what that phony
what's right that they.
they killed or how they killed
him they don't want to get and
all the details of that is that
correct Mr Grayson in your
experience.
Sure Representative yes that's
my that's my understanding is
and that's based on I can refer
Representative McQueen to you J.
R. fourteen seven oh one.
So the crime is that the
individual was in possession of
a firearm obviously a second
element of the crimes that in
the preceding ten years the
individual was convicted and
sentenced to one or more years
in prison that by a quarter of
the United States or by a
quarter of the state and so
whether that the name of the
crime is admitted in evidence
something that's that's decided
by the judge.
and would be based on motion
practice in a in an individual
case
but if if the individual was for
example let's let's pick a
percent violent serious violent
felony individual hazard and
aggravated battery in the past
and is charged with
possessing a felon in possession
of a firearm in the jury could
be given the information in the
prior felony that is for
aggravated battery or teach the
state could present that
information without the name of
the felony and the jury would
determine whether there's a
balance felon felony conviction
and the judge will know that
that's an aggravated battery.
I hope that answers
Representative okay I I think I
think I got my answer.
Thank you madam chair the movie
on my next question
Page ten we heard some public
testimony about this the the the
aggravated fleeing taking out
that it's a marked vehicle.
and I don't know I experienced
twice remember years of.
The ones driving down I. twenty
five and one and yeah I twenty
five towards Albuquerque once
driving down to eighty five.
towards Laney.
Of emergency vehicles coming up
fast behind me.
And me getting out of the way.
And as the past me I realize
it's.
A private S. U. V. with flashers
in the.
In the grill.
which apparently is a way for.
People to speed and there is
concern expressed that
If it's an unmarked vehicle.
do women feel safe point over.
wonder
chair representative so Mr
Grayson if you could.
Explain why we're taking out the
requirement that that vehicle be
mark.
Madam chair if I might to
address that for Representative
McQueen please.
Yes please go ahead.
Very much of Representative
McQueen members of the committee
chair first of all authorize
emerging vehicles as is provided
for long and and and for for set
up I'm not a attorney.
Off page one officer but
authorization for mercy vehicle
you would find in statute sixty
six seven dash six
that outlines what a law
enforcement vehicle is and
really what we're trying to
address here is that every other
function within a public safety
falls under the statute but
under the aggravated fleeing
statute we have created this
additional language that says a
program marked vehicles so if
you allow me just a few minutes
can walk through that for you
and and answer that so under
sixty six seven six the chief of
the New Mexico state police and
local agencies they may
designate emergency vehicles and
also revoked that designation if
you look on further what is
required for a a vehicle to be
an authorized emergency vehicle
it talks about the review goes
in motion and need to be able to
sound a siren R. L. and I'll
also be equipped with at least
one lights to receive from the
vehicle that requires red light
towards the front of the car so
that statute currently addresses
every other public safety
function that's out there we're
trying to address in this
particular bill is the loophole
it's been created the aggravated
fleeing P. so if you just allow
me just for a minute
additional languages added
communicating and severe
appropriately marked law
enforcement vehicle so the issue
here is is is to remember that
the most violent people out
there that return address for
felons in general in order for
for law enforcement right so
this loophole has been created
basically and the argument
typically as well I know the law
enforcement okay
I would disagree with that in
addition to secure that'll
hardly based on my experience so
what I would like to just kind
of just address just for a
minute if you look at law
enforcement law enforcement is
not allowed to pursue not
authorized to arrest the officer
believes a suspect presents a
clear and imminent threat to the
public so really by the time
they were engaging in a motor
vehicle by the time that we make
the decision to increase our
range of speed and and and and
go after people again that
president that clear and present
imminent threats the public
needs to be present so what we
what we have here is really a
loophole where violent offenders
now every time that just means
that pressing so right as long
as they you know which is the
one that that that will.
It's an unmarked vehicle that
they avoided the charge of
aggravated fleeing a law forcing
officers of the dresser concerns
from and and and some of the
public comment regarding
unmarked vehicles for just a
moment and I'm speaking from
experience I just add that to my
question a gentleman in March
lafortune vehicle from two
thousand five to two thousand
twenty one for five year period
I wasn't featured apprehension
unit we're our jobs to do
surveillance and and work high
crime areas and work.
Go after most well offenders and
then from twenty ten to twenty
twenty one as a command officer
in uniform driving a vehicle
when you interact law abiding
citizen and right along by as
they do exactly what you
described Representative McQueen
that they pull over the other
way they they they
allow for the the vehicle go
past
well if you don't do that.
They they push on and so.
The issue that we have here is
that.
Take the example of the person
officer that seems to be concern
for people is that if
unfortunately ago on Mars behind
someone tries to pull someone
over and it's someone's afraid
a law abiding citizen this
become unconscionable they don't
start driving over sidewalks
they don't start driving her
race speeds going through
intersections in red lights and
and putting the people of peril
at risk what they do is they may
continue to drive which would
not meet the elements of the
crime this particular case may
call nine one one they may pull
over to the place in a drive to
a police department but law
abiding citizen don't start
putting everyone on the runway
at risk by any means necessary
to get away and so in this
particular case you know that
becomes the issue for us when
when the example you provided
Sir is that when the lights come
on behind you you're you're act
as required to by law you pull
over you don't know that the
vehicles March around mark into
told passage somehow to allow
for our most violent and people
who do want with everyone else
at risk say what sorry I just
didn't know I didn't know with
law enforcement so that gave me
the excuse and reason just drive
on in in the matter which they
do that is what we have.
You know mostly the issue with
is that that doesn't justify the
aggravated fleeing.
What was what we're seeing out
there.
Most people will just go over
and and again.
Programming Martel dress and
more time in the night time
hours you can see the markings
on the court but every law
abiding citizen was over to the
side of the road even in the
daytime again if law enforcement
officer behind you may or may
not see it but not on you all
you can see class the police
lights to see if it's marked or
unmarked people flow over and
determine you know what's going
on contact with yet here again
the function for law enforcement
in every other capacity is
acceptable under the statue that
I previously mentioned Senator
talk talk about aggravated
fleeing is very extreme
circumstances now needs to be a
mark or a finish up with this in
most policies you'll find that
it is required as soon as more
cars available they join into
the pursuit and the on March
then back off but at the onset
when you're going after these
people as described.
From experience until your
nursing they're trying to work a
week primary in your witnessing
crime progress you have the duty
to attack you have to do it to
to get people into custody and
Pagano they know they were
committing a crime they know the
lights come on it's not a
coincidence and that it's a
somebody is having the pursuing
officer in else's last autumn
all get off the soapbox here
If we have a coincidence of the
people the chairman crimes the
time that they are if you come
across it the person who be
impersonating in that moment and
let's remember that a person who
would be impersonating a police
officer is committing a crime as
well and they wouldn't be
wanting attention drawn to them
so someone can driving they
would likely peel off and go
find an easier document that was
there there intensive again and
we believe this is a loophole
that is in law and sixty six
seven six
clearly outlines one authorise
mercy vehicle as in that statute
even mentions that.
The pursuit of is allowed yeah
we have created a separate
statute I reforming now
presented decisional
requirement.
Without question.
Chair Mister boy that's a.
That's very thorough and
persuasive answer I appreciate
that
one follow up hopefully with a
shorter answer.
My understanding is emergency
vehicle also includes.
The fire vehicles influences
and.
Does that create any ambiguity
or or is it just no one flees
from of the ambulance so you
hello.
Representative McQueen that's a
fair question I appreciate that
I don't know if it's the fire
truck and they were not
authorized.
Thank you so.
Okay.
My next question is one
of the we we discussed over the
phone until to some extent and
that is the the for possession
and
In particular.
Of the thirty.
Enhancements.
Thirteen so there's there's
there's penalties for possession
of a there's a higher penalty
for brandishing there's still a
higher penalty for this charge
but then suggestion diem page
thirteen.
Of four.
Transactions it's it's all of
that higher till the that the
additional three years and the
the.
Knowing very little about how
this works the scenario that I
imagine was a drug dealer.
Of Propst area typically in an
alley of the the dealers
clientele knows where to find
him he's being surveilled over
the course of the perhaps couple
hours in proceeds to sell drugs
to.
Three four five six different
individuals.
All the time having a weapon in
his possession it's not visible.
At the end of the of the stake
out other surveillance whatever
it is you your rest the drug
dealer in in my mind transaction
means.
Every time he accepts money and
has over drugs that's a
transaction.
So it is there thank you could
you explain.
Why that person would be
charged.
Three four five six times with
and get this additional three
years for every clinical
transaction.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative McQueen and
believe that Mr Grayson has an
answer for that.
Chair representative it's a very
good question they use the word
transaction it's a term of art
and and double jeopardy law
transaction
is is used as opposed to
Essentially
the the unit current insured
conduct analysis transaction is
basically it's a course of
conduct.
and that's how it how it has
been interpreted in your under
double double jeopardy law and
so of course of conduct can
include multiple criminal acts.
those would have to be separated
by space and time
significantly in order to be
separate transactions.
It.
Recent separated its base in
time.
With me you know separate days.
Representative queen it could be
different days it could be
it it could be different days at
different locations if that if
it's simply multiple
transactions occurring at the
same location one after another
that's that's not going to be
enough to to satisfy the
language of the statute.
So I I would just chair Mister
chair with the server.
You just described multiple
transactions are in fact not
multiple transactions.
So I mean the common
understanding they were
transaction you're suggesting is
different and.
In prosecution which it may well
be I you know it's beyond my
expertise but you just you just
defaulted into the common
understanding of whether
transactions.
Sure the queen I apologize for
the ambiguity as the the term
drug transaction would be a drug
transaction that would be the
promotions the term transaction
would be more generally defined
by a criminal activity okay.
Your the Sentix in and Mr
Grayson Mr I.
Thank you for your answers.
Thank you very much
Do I have for their hands.
Just what just one moments going
responding to something.
Members who want to support the
legislation but has serious
serious reservations about asked
me if we could do a motion
without recommendation but we
don't do that to the floor not
from this committee we fix it.
And we there.
We think that.
So that
It doesn't go to the floor with
the ambiguity of our no
recommendation I I think
Representative Dixon I'm
wondering if you would be
willing to meet with some of
those of us who have concerns
and perhaps try to make changes
before tomorrow.
Because the other hand raised
let me tell you what my concerns
are and I think they've been
very well stated by
representatives from where you
live.
I I certainly agree that the
evidence shows that punishment
must be swift and certain but
the certainty of going to jail a
certain number of years for
specified number of years is not
something that offenders are
going to know about in advance
so that is we already know that
that let alone persons is not a
deterrent.
So
The.
Since that we have from years of
working on this since twenty
twelve we've been working on a
number of us have been working
hello Justice Reform is that
longer prison sentences actually
increase recidivism.
So that if you have someone who
can be properly punished within
a few years that individual is
more likely to be rehabilitated
and somebody who spends an
unnecessarily long time in
prison so.
Simply time.
Doesn't work.
So when we first started Justice
Reform sub it was ten years ago
and we heard from red states
Texas North Carolina North
Dakota Texas North Dakota
specifically said they made a
decision will be for twenty
twelve.
To stop building prisons.
What you're gonna do here is
still prisons up.
And not get the results.
There are two at least two very
conservative very conservative
Groups.
Who are.
Singing the same tune that I am
right now.
There's justice action network
and right on crime.
Not support a mandatory part of
this I have not objected in the
past two and since two involving
firearms as long as it was.
In the realm of judicial
discretion Mr speaker to do away
with.
What you're Mr speaker I did it
but I I I I wasn't needs
interrupt you madam chair
unfinished so chair I will you
know if we're going to have this
Send to get worked up a little
bit I would like to add.
I thought that.
Section six.
My preference would be I think
it'd be deleted.
I'm.
You know I I've had a pretty
substantial evolution and how I
look at.
criminal statutes since I was
elected to this legislature and
one of the things that we were.
I think you're proudest to do
honor truly bipartisan basis was
our criminal justice reform
legislation that we did and
twenty seventeen
it was an effort with me and at
Representative gentry and
Yes sponsor was said I don't
need to be
disregarding the import working
of the folks it did that but you
know we we went through we got
rid of lots of mandatory
sentencing and one of things
that I what if things were also
working on the session is our
how we can improve pre trial
detention.
That how we can improve improve
that and Alice's.
and how we can improve.
The safety while people are
awaiting trial and we've just
put in.
The budget at twenty five
million dollars to be spent over
three years for pre trial
services and she training of
judges and also you know a lot
of things that really I think
we're doing in partnership with
the judiciary and.
It strikes me is perhaps
An instance where we should see
if some of that.
Training in partnership can be
put to effective use before we
To take away a judge's
discretion so that that might be
one thing to consider
one other thing I I think might
need to be.
I think that.
Would be
I don't have any comments on
aggravated fleeing I think that
section looks just fine to me hi
any comments or
questions or concerns a section
for.
The
section three I think this is
perfectly fine
I think section one is perfectly
fine I do think sections to I
know this is the subject madam
chair of a lot of.
Conversation in consumer public
affairs committee.
wanted to make sure that we are.
Targeting the right contact in
not being overly broad
and I see it we have included
categories four percent on
private property inside a school
zone.
It's a course that addresses you
know someone in their home your
home is within the boundaries of
the schools
and then the other was a person
authorized to carry a concealed
handgun pursuant to the can
still hang and airy Care Act.
I'm.
I think we might want to
consider adding a another
provision there for a person in
a vehicle inside the schools on
maybe if you're driving through
the school's on I am a firearm
in your car I don't know if this
would scoop you up in that.
And I I did follow the details
of the debate in a consumer
public affairs committee but
that is occurring to me that you
know I drive through schools on
every day on my way to the
capital and on the way to my law
office I'm not usually arms
coming so but you know if I did
have a firearm in the car
because I'm not on private
property among public property
the roadway am I gonna be
committing a crime if I take a
firearm on you know in my
vehicle we're if it's on my
person I'm riding a bicycle that
is St to just a question I have
about that and maybe that could
be considered as folks do some
more work on its bill in advance
of tomorrow's hearing thank you.
Also in our community analysis
which we're happy to share with
you Representative with their
instructions
For.
With with what we're talking
about deleting now Mr speaker
I'm sorry is that.
Madam chair is needed.
Deleting section six that's one
about that Senator Steinborn and
and I was reminded by the
excellent.
Councillor make Dorsey did it
was Representative enrollment
Estes in twenty seventeen
yeah so if you're on the off
chance to represent masters is
listening to this are Mr
chairman I apologize for of my
faulty.
Probably during this committee
Mister chair Mister speaker on
it our committee announces in
section four there are two
citations to New Mexico statute
that need to be treated thank
you would check that because
that would help you out.
Right.
That's.
We're really not delaying new
any one more all of the bills
will be going out.
From today and tomorrow
something you know
Representative stuck on top of
each other.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you all very much appreciate
your your work on this.
I am sure for Representative
Dixon eight does she need
A more firewood for the campfire
that she's been presenting next
to during this to committee
meeting.
The fire let's see
Representative Dixon let's see
what.
Charity we heard background.
Now she had she had some sort
of.
In a fire or something it could
be as generous send your
message as it looked like she
was presenting extra camp fire
off like Representative Romero.
Exactly.
Okay.
Our next bill today is the
house bill eighty four.
Our young madam chair the
committee so this is House Bill
any for the crime reduction
branch so this talks about what
it is we've been referring to
which is.
As we're doing these criminal
justice grants
as reader I'm sorry I got
interrupted some is coming in as
we're doing this criminal
justice grants we want to make
sure that there's somebody there
to look at these requests that
are being given out and make
certain that there are
performance measures goals the
data is given real time that
were evaluating the data to make
sure that the goals are being
met to learn lessons from them
this goes back to a bipartisan
bill that Representative night
burden I carry are along with
justice jobs's health back in
two thousand nineteen house bill
two sixty seven this simply adds
to the areas where the crowd
crime reduction requests can be
made and I would add that a lot
of these programs our in house
bill two and so if this bill
passes house bill two we all
some of these community grants
of these crime reduction
requests will run through the
same kind of analysis that of
the one through three have an
it's a whole list of things
intended to capture up other
programs that we think have
efficacy in reducing crime and
reducing recidivism or at least
get some data behind it and I
think most important and I'll
finish this way I think most
importantly we learn lessons
from these programs that we can
then apply to other programs and
other communities and so we
continue to learn as we do this
and this formalizes this in
other areas so with that madam
chair I will stand for
questions.
Did you have any experts to
present with any.
That's great okay.
let's go to first the audience
let's do a quick call to see
those who are present and
participating you wish to weigh
in on house bill eighty four.
And if we can get that up on the
screen and we'll do a twenty
second pull.
Here you go starting now.
Okay we have six people voting
and everybody likes it so it's
hundred percent in favor and
let's go to that
attendees to and see who would
like to.
This is not coming up for me.
Is there anyone who would like
to speak please raise your hand
and some will.
This is not coming up right for
me.
So that I can I can't see hands
raised our Madam chair
Representative McQueen as his
handout nine million for
participants the dates and this
week.
Right I did Jason Weaks and
Jason Weaks.
How.
Because I don't know.
My there we go all right David
rice first go ahead David.
I didn't I wasn't even able to
get the pole up that's kind of
why I was jumping in your my
hands up okay
I'm trying to figure out what
this bill even.
Thank you all right we'll Jason
Weaks.
Thank you madam chair members
committee Jason Weaks on behalf
of Bernalillo county we stand in
support of this piece of
legislation we actually were
separate recipient of these
crime reduction requests we are
used to construct what we call
our high frequency utilize our.
A program it kind of tracks is
going to become high frequency
lasers we can understand how to
better deliver services for them
in different around the court
systems in general these
production requests are great
concept the utilize CDC Caesar
come on just coordinating
councils to come up with good
reforms on local level to
implement programs that are sort
of pilot programs quite frankly
that hopefully become permanent
programs seek to distribute
goods services and get good
services in the hands of folks
expose them to those services in
the effort to reduce crime and
improve criminal justice
processes in local jurisdictions
through data driven evidence
based program so we stand and
strong support when I think
Representative be life bring
this forward as well as bringing
house bill two sixty seven
twenty nineteen for and thank
you also for funding it because
that is key to this whole
process as well thanks.
Thank you very much just weeks
that's all I have for public
comment so we can take that.
Do with these.
And I for the first on my list
Representative McQueen.
Thank you madam chair Madam
chair representative Ely.
Some.
So I take this this whole
program is.
My impression of this is we're
looking for.
New different creative ways to
address crime by
reducing cry and diverting
offenders things like that the
taking a different approach is
that.
A fair description Madam chair
representative yes although this
bill doesn't propose specific
programs this is the structure
by which those programs are
evaluated.
So
Madam chair representative
either but it does expand the
the scope of the requests that
the the uses of the requests
yeah so Madam chair
representative what happened was
as we were looking at the
appropriations bill this is goes
back several months ago
I realized additionally we had
had a lot of these additional
components not all of them but
in the original house bill two
sixty seven honestly I can't
tell you why they were removed
but we wanted to put the back to
make it broad enough to capture
the requests so we had a process
to capture grants that would
cover other areas and not just
be one through three.
So madam chair resent the light
but my what caught my eye was a
on page two number seven.
Recruit and retain law
enforcement officers.
One thing that I uh.
It.
Is it in many places our
retention bonuses.
you know to you know some
smaller communities might pay
them to Wade Albuquerque putting
more officers Albuquerque might
pay them to avoid years of the
pushing our officers the idea
that.
We're gonna pay you a one time
bonus to stay.
Yeah and I recognize
The utility appropriateness of
that in circumstances but that
doesn't strike me as.
An alternative way to reduce
crime or address the root causes
of crime.
So madam chair representative
yeah to be clear and we got to
go back through house bill oh
sorry Mike my
texting thing was on.
This sorry.
To be clear what we're doing
with this is this is when the
criminal justice coordinating
panels this is there's thirteen
of them in the state are you
corresponding with judicial
districts they get together and
they propose a solution together
they want to try a program so
they apply to DFA let's say and
they said we'd like to have a
grant for this purpose.
and then the grant is given.
You want to have a mechanism by
which there is somebody out
there in this case the
sentencing commission they can
evaluate those programs to see
does it make sense to fund them
and once it does what the goals
we've had the experience of
people getting money that they
did not perform in the criminal
justice system we talked about
some of House Bill five in
another committee where they're
getting money and they're no
performance goals and they're
not providing data in real time
and so we don't know is it
working in what what is the
measure of success so you're not
wrong to say gosh does this work
to you know give retention
bonuses or whatever would be to
try to keep officers that's not
what we're talking about we're
talking about if the
coordinating council says we
want to try retention bonuses
and our goal would be to add a
hundred officers in the next
year well there is an there is a
method by which we would
evaluate where the retention
bonuses successful that way a
year from now when somebody
comes in and says Hey we want to
do that again we have the data
to say that did work that didn't
work as opposed to it I feel
right and that's what we're
trying to get away from it
that's why I was so
complimentary frankly of LFC and
House Bill to was because I LFC
is really gone in the direction
of this kind of program is
evaluating things in real time
to see if they work and the
criminal justice system is front
and center good I I hope that
that answers your question Madam
chair representative.
Madam chair representative Ely.
Yes.
Got a question I think let me
ask my question more
specifically okay I'll try to
give you a more succinct answer
madam chair representative.
Madam chair representative to
grants be used to pay retention
let's.
R. I I guess that they could are
they would have to be approved
they are going to be on a
priority scale but I don't see
why they wouldn't if the
criminal justice it the criminal
justice coordinating council
said with this would really help
us in your our goals they can
apply for the man I get it but
they could certainly apply.
Can then chairs it either I I
and I will Harper about that
just a.
Thank you law enforcement
compensation you know to me it's
a bit like a teacher
compensation that you know we
may not be competitive with
other states and that's from and
I also think you know for both
jobs are difficult
one is certainly inherently more
dangerous than the other of both
jobs are difficult we want to
recruit and retain good people
we want to pay them a.
Appropriate
salary.
I I sort of thought this was an
alternative kind of program and
I would.
I bet you prefer to see it.
You prefer to see these funds to
alternative type proposals in
that we should address
the compensation is issues when
we address compensation issues
not through our alternative
grant program so that's that's
that's why there is an issue but
you you madam chair
representative but I can imagine
because that's the whole point
is that they're gonna have to
find.
Work for the bonuses will really
help us retain officers fight
crime what are what would be
right now we are not requiring
that kind of the that's what
this bill does this budget
process together to address
exactly the concern your
expression which is the worst
the data behind this somebody
asked retention bonus is there
really science behind the back
of that works reducing crime we
have a system that we have more
officers is that really help the
system so I totally agree with
you that's why this bill is
there to address that very
concerned that we get away from
kind of feelings and we start
relying more on science in
state.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
So I don't have any were there

Here is.
All right.
Thank you madam chair thank you
members of the committee F.
House Bill one fifty four is the
office and then so this fellow
was this is the second time
we've maybe third time without
this bill and provide the
committee.
Basically it actually the
families and act in the child
welfare and but then act
providing for the chief
childcare reference that's been
creating the child welfare but
the office and establishing the
powers and duties of that office
I'm I know you're wondering why
we need this quite simply CYFD
has made the statement this
administration is a hundred
percent committed to making sure
that the public the taxpayer and
all of our stakeholders and
partners in keeping children and
you state remain aware of our
work our successes and also our
challenges as a government
agency the public's involvement
and oversight and expectation
and accountability are crucial
elements of ensuring we stay in
the right path for kids that's
actually statement that CYFD
main but as we continue to see
the struggles that are going on
with CYFD were continued
continuing to see a black hole
of information.
a lack of accountability lack of
transparent parents saying.
I don't see why the secretary
just recently testified to the
legislature saying that
childhood death and abuse we're
going down in the state LFC
challenge that and I don't know
how you want to say it but our
state our secretary at the time
lied to the legislature and we
we can't have that type of
and accountability going going
on in our state we have children
that are dying in this in our
state we have people who cannot
file grievances they can't deal
with
we have social workers that will
if there's issues or complaints
we have no idea what's going on
and in this budget position
would I create accountability
I'm going to now let my expert
explain to you some provide that
details of what's in the bill.
Mr.
Madam chair members the
committee just less than us on
the register lobbyist The New
Mexico child first network which
is a nonprofit organization
dedicated to improving the lives
of children in foster care in a
parent those who service them so
it really I just I talked
briefly about the process of how
this piece of legislation has
come together over the last
couple years house bill one
forty five was really designed
to align with the governmental
in Boston standards as
recognized by the United States
ombudsman association.
You know the title and by the
minutes really gained popularity
at and both public and private
sectors to describe various
types of problem solvers are the
model that we used really it
looks that an independent
impartial public official with
authority and responsibility to
receive investigate and then for
or informally address complete
out government actions and when
appropriate make findings and
recommendations and public
publisher sport Reports so it
really with the goal of
achieving systemic change to
better system.
Are the standards that were
developed by the governmental
investment association really
comes into four categories which
we integrated into the
development of house bill one
forty five the first pillar is
independence so the admin office
outlined the legislation before
you and structure function and
appearance is free is free from
outside controller influence and
this really enables the invites
me to function as impartial and
critical entity that reports and
makes recommendations based
solely on the review of facts
and law it in the light of
reason fairness without
political influence by the
second pillars impartiality and
the again in the legislation the
what's been really receives or
abuse each complaint and an
objective and fair manner free
from bias and treats all parties
without favor or prejudice the
third couple years
confidentiality and that's an
important one because
confidentiality protecting the
confidentiality of the
complainants and the details of
the investigation really instill
confidence in the work of the
invites that are the fourth
pillar credible review process
so we really try to look at a
credible review process so that
it's done in a manner that
engenders respect and confidence
and that their accessible to all
potential complaints and really
the goal of creating this child
welfare ombudsman offices to
sure again that we have an
independent and trusted place
that's required to one listen to
people about their experiences
and with and concerns about
trial protection two research
and investigate concerns
reported by New Mexicans about
service delivery within child
protection three determine the
best way to resolve concerns and
that might just be in bridging
the communication barriers are
resolving conflicts based on
this understanding between the
department and various
stakeholders for identifying
trends in the community's needs
that have changed and that the
system may not have correct
funding or resources or
practices to keep up in a result
of that is the investment can
make public record.
Emendations to improve the
entire system last the
legislation is designed to
really break down the current
culture of secrecy and fear and
instead shine light on the
issues affecting the structure
that has the ability to enact
change that have long lasting
positive impact on children and
families for New Mexico thank
you madam chair.
Thank you very much does that
conclude your presentation here
ready for us to go to the
audience yes madam chair okay
let's set up a pole real quickly
here.
See if we have attendees who
would like to speak R. we would
like to weigh in first and then
we'll invite them to speak on
house bill one forty five so if
we can get that out there we go
it's up twenty seconds.
Okay.
Seventy two percent in favor and
twenty eight percent in
opposition and let me go down to
the.
Attendee list use.
All right let I have people who
would like to speak more C.
store are please take one minute
and try not to repeat what
others say.
My name is Marcy Star I'm an
advocate for children and
families especially native
children and families who find
themselves entangled in the CYFD
system we've heard tribal
members community members and
even legislators state when
discussing the Indian family
preservation bill we need this
because CYFD does not always
follow the law as advocates we
know that CYFD often falls on
its practices which sometimes is
conflicting with one policy.
These are just two of the
reasons why it's so important to
have an independent ombudsman
children families and tribes
when it becomes law and even if
it doesn't deserve someone to
hear their concerns other than
the very agency that might have
wronged them without an
independent ombudsman families
children tribes and advocates
are left without anyone to hold
the system accountable when they
desperately need it thank you.
You.
Press.
Or in France that excuse me.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is the life press this director
of the office of children's
right to sue at the.
The children youth and families
department CYFD remains
respectful neutral on this bill
however we would like to thank
Representative for heart out Mr
Espinoza everyone from Jerry new
and innovative ways to sporting
some Mexico's most portable
children and families we truly
believe that through community
input and collaboration we can
help improve our monitoring
services to children families
and communities so that every
child will grow up in safe
healthy and caring home thank
you madam chair and members of
the committee for the
opportunity support and happy to
take any questions thank you.
Thank you.
Well.
Good afternoon madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Tina Webb I am the and
seventeen that has been in CYFD
care for over two years he is
currently missing and has been
for forty five days in my
experience it has been difficult
to have my voice heard in with
complaints in issues.
Within the department of CYFD.
I have gone as far as sending
several emails to Miss Vigil
with no response children in
CYFD care families and the
communities need someone they
can rely on tracks that is
outside of the department of
CYFD New Mexico is one of only
seven states that does not have
an office like this in place it
is long overdue that the New
Mexico that New Mexico start
putting all children but
especially those in CYFD care
first New Mexico ranked fiftieth
out of fifty per child well
being I ask that you vote yes on
house bill one forty five.
McKinley.
Please yourself.
I'll go to M. S. C. A. C..
Substitute Advisory Council.
Share this is Shelly poker are
you accepting both opposition.
All right thank you madam chair
members of the committee I'm the
director of the substitute care
Advisory Council which by
statute provides a permanent
independent system to evaluate
CYFD effectiveness and
discharging a child protection
responsibilities I'm also a
member of the New Mexico
childhood calendar review board
a federal requirement managed
with the department of health
with all due respect
Representative Pardo and other
supporting house bill one forty
five I'm requesting this
committee issue a do not pass
yes we need to improve our
independent system however this
model is one of many and has not
been vetted nor does it clarify
how this office would interact
with the not directly Kate are
conflict with the work of
existing entities.
view of this committee a joint
resolution to support efforts
creating a task force to review
the needs what currently exists
model options and provide
recommendations to interim
committees would result in a
model we may all be competent is
best for New Mexico and actively
support in our next legislative
session thank you very much.
I'm trying it again.
Hi can you hear me now yes thank
you so much for coming that snap
college ice for that I would
like to strongly support H. B.
one forty five I believe this is
either my third or fourth time
to support and advocate that New
Mexico desperately needs to
create an office such as this to
help citizens navigate a complex
complex child protection system.
that that is independent CYFD.
We we're all painfully aware
that we're fiftieth in child
welfare and I think that we all
just need to work together and
leaves no stone unturned to
everything that we can do to
help children I I know one
speaker just suggested that we
create a resolution but we did
that three years ago and and
we're back to the same place if
not worse please please I ask
that you said that you support
and add to pass on this bill
thank you so much.
George Davis.
Yes I understand you can hear me
again to we certainly thank you
I am as the previous director of
psychiatry for CYFD and I also
am a consultant on the Kevin
just.
Agreements I just want to
strongly support this this.
Bill issue one forty five and
also I understand.
Mr speaker is reservations.
Making the most of act kind of
intervention however over the
years
CYFD and and this is not the
fault of the press secretary but
over the years of the our
department has been known for
Hey
retaliation and and court so
this I think will be helpful.
Thank you very much and next
Erica's songes.
Madam chair members of the
committee
my name is Erica Sanchez with
New Mexico can where we partner
with young people impacted by
foster care to improve their
transition to adulthood we
respectfully oppose house bill
one forty five what we believe
the state's children and
families need and deserve a CYFD
that's functional transparent
and trustworthy this bill will
not get us there if the state
moves to war moves forward with
an office in this office it
needs to be it be built out
thoroughly thoughtfully and
meaningfully in line with the
United States ombudsman
associations governmental but
spent standards this bill is not
some concerns are it doesn't
allow for parents or guardians
to make complaints with the
office and it doesn't account
for the range it's guidance for
confidentiality is not clear and
has a lot of missing it
conflicts with the age of
consent law.
And it wasn't developed in
collaboration with our dividend
vetted by community stakeholders
or experts in the field
including those implementing the
Kevin just settlement agreement
and the children's court
improvement commission thank
you.
Thank you next I have Merioles
back.
Thank you madam chair and
committee members I'm I'm
actually excited to hear at the
former speakers COVID Erica
Sanchez because my first comment
was actually going to be reading
the Kevin ask press release from
the Kevin escort plaintiffs that
George Davis you I'm actually
just spoke previously was quoted
and if you have not received it
I will be sending it following
up but the headline and again if
you read the FIR which is the
fiscal impact reported like to
call your attention to all of
the questions and concerns about
the duplication efforts of this
office with Kevin asked okay
first of all the press releases
called New Mexico child welfare
reform off to a rocky start and
I'd like to quote Dr George
Davis all of us to treat abuse
neglect children in New Mexico
heavily and have anticipated the
relief that a fully functioning
child protection service office
could offer never the last
despite the process the progress
that has been made in the
policies of CYFD in the
appropriation for improved
service delivery by Medicaid
those advances have yet to
actually benefit the children in
any tangible way I really cannot
stress enough and I I'd also
like to call attention which
I'll be sending an email the LFC
member member member September
twenty third so I I thank you to
please read both of those I'm
this this bill has actually been
in the works for the past four
and five years Representative
Fajardo along with many many
stakeholders have worked on this
bill and I'd like to say it's
important to note that in twenty
twenty one many of us in this
committee were very disheartened
when to CYFD themselves
testified against H. B. two oh
two sponsored by Representative
Matthew sticks and Sweetser and
now congressman Melanie
Stansbury because CYFD said that
they could not codified Kevin
asked Madam productions cause
direct in HSD could not support
the court agreements so when
you're looking at the F. I. R.
that says that they conflict
with the FIR and Kevin asked we
had a Kevin as plaintiff himself
say please pass this bill.
So the FIR must be can keep use
and please pass H. B. one forty
five when you pass the special
education that's meant a rural
that's meant in the broad band
it's been last year alone
there's no reason not to pass
this that have been fully vetted
and is in accordance with the
national ombudsman not much to
whatever someone said previously
thank you.
Joe Jones.
Hello madam chair members of the
committee can you hear me.
Yes we can.
Thank you my name is Joe Jones
and I am in strong support and
H. B. one forty five am I
actually have personal
experience as to why the office
seven on beds men would be very
beneficial to New Mexico's most
vulnerable children and their
families
I had this office been in
existence in may at two twenty
two two thousand twenty excuse
me a tragedy could possibly been
prevented but instead we had
four children who were kidnapped
by their biological parents as
I'm sure you all well know and
one child ended up being
permanently blinded and buster
Care license being revoked over
the case as well as several
lawsuits that resulted from
statewide dis negligence and
retaliation I'm I believe
probably many of you have heard
from CYFD to vote against this
bill and if so I think that is a
shame it should make everyone
question why see what he doesn't
want you holding them
accountable again in strong
support and H. B. one forty five
and I'm advocating to all the
yes on H. B. one forty five as
well and I think you're.
Thank you very much that
concludes the public comment
let's go back to the committee
and take down.
The public comment screen.
Representative McQueen I have
you for I know we excuse me.
Let me go back to the sponsor
please forgive me.
We're still on date would you
like to make a comments
Representative Fajardo after the
public comment thank you madam
chair I do you know I some of
those comments very interesting
because this bill has been that
it has gone gone gone through
the process this is this is
something that didn't happen
overnight this is for four years
of work I'm talking to
stakeholders meeting with
stakeholders around the state I
find it very interesting that
CYFD it came on and say they
want to be neutral but yet they
lobbied many of you on this
committee
to vote against this bill so
that's a critical CYFD I don't
appreciate that and they kind of
con come and have a conversation
with me which they never did
thank you madam chair.
Okay Representative McQueen.
For questions.
Thank you Madam chair
Yes thank you Representative
Ferrary L.
So I simply don't go after that
comment but
Chair representative part of
could you the.
The address some of the concerns
about duplication of effort.
I apologize my your phone state
falling out so as the drugs yeah
I'm I'm so for that for the
details and I'm going to
actually refer it to expert
witness who's actually been
helping me work on this for the
last couple years the stress
test a place.
Representative McQueen members
midi the so the the subject here
Advisory Council really a set up
to monitor individual cases that
look at this process within that
one of the differences with the
invites them that a set up here
is really looking at system wide
trends and changes that need to
be made in addition so so those
look at the separate nationally
I I I understand two there was a
reset report talking about the
subject care advisory.
Council and is there in tents
and and it noted any of the
inadequacies and sort of
coordination I'm not having
access to so many files I had no
coordination or cooperation with
CYFD so the way this office to
set up is you know they have
access to the files either have
to be coordination of responses
so really does have different
jurisdiction are and and and in
a different purpose are.
Okay thank you for that
present for her though Madam
chair representative for.
I did in reading through you the
bill analyses
ABC healthy is also our house
democratic analysis
at.
There were a number of sort of
technical drafting issues.
There were noted
suggestions for better language
are clear language
Thank you.
It's I think it's challenging
you know that this bill is you
know it's almost all new
material it's not just changing
if you were to an existing
statute
in particular I would note takes
twelve there some concerns
raised about.
The if you look at the top of
page troubling three the
discretion of the spuds but it's
spend to release or not release
information whether or not that
was subject to impress.
And then further down on our
lines each line.
it was suggested that the the
phrase the child welfare
spokesman
not disclose identity changing
that to the office I mean there
there are some technical
drafting issues which are I
don't particularly
I need to go into any great
detail detail so just something
I would call to your attention
some it's worth looking at I I
had one question and the.
Yes.
Maybe my employer do with with
the issue
madam chair is target currently
we have several other these
positions in the.
The in other areas
are are those two houses in DFA.
Representative Ferrary to your
muted.
Sorry about that I'm you know I
I'm not sure where the house I'm
gonna have my expert explained
that to you and also explain to
you why we chose to put into DFA
there was a previous version and
that we had it in a different
location and with and put it
under DFA was very intentional.
German Representative McQueen so
there are different types of
about seven set up within
current state The New Mexico so
one of the other ones I'm most
familiar with is the long term
care ombudsman and that's a
different type of doctor spend
that we're setting up for the
long term care and but it's been
a set up really to.
Help
Patients in a long term care
facility sort of provide
oversight of private industry
this is a governmental ombudsman
which is supposed to look at
accountability of government
system so one of those
principles that I talked about
was independence so we look at
the model that the legislature
used with the office of the
superintendent of insurance that
was created about five six years
ago they were having some issues
with them PRC the offices taken
out maybe independence and we
follow that so they made that
administratively attached to the
department of finance
administration and under the
administrative is attached with
that just means is for but
budget purposes their budget
request flows through to DFA but
there are independent and they
don't have to DFA does not have
any authority over them so we
follow the model that currently
exists within state statute.
Part of Mr Espinoza thank for
that.
Did you consider a the state
auditor's office.
I think you just muted yourself
Mr as well as.
Yeah.
Madam chair representative queen
we did and I I it's certainly
open the any suggestions on that
we again we just sort of model
that off what the office of the
superintendent insurance that
are in that process and model
seems to be working well but
we're certainly open to other
ideas.
You know I Madam chair
representative prior to I I've
not.
The first well the first in this
this area to
Make a record recommendation one
the one or the other I will say
In general my experience with
the FAA is.
they can be a difficult to work
with PRC.
are you know maybe that's the
nature of the beast but that
that's I I have had difficulty
there and I just think this
would be an interesting fit for
the state auditor you his job is
to make
Madam chair representative thank
you.
Thank thank you for that and and
something definitely worth
looking at what and I understand
that there could be some
practice issues with DFA and
it's worth considering but when
you look at the breakfast a
issues with the CYFD that's
accomplishment is a far
improvement but yeah we're
definitely willing to consider
what whatever we need to do.
Thank you.
Representative McQueen.
Yes chair okay Representative
Nibert you're next.
You madam chair.
Representative.
This.
Legislation.
Yes in prior years
Did we.
Strongly as it has now I'm and a
lot of that has to do with my
own education in this area.
as well as early recent
experience that we had in in my
County and.
Representative Townsend and I
were were invited to come out to
our local cost of program we
spent the number of hours.
Learning about some of the
concerns that the they have with
respect to the system review
well.
So my question is is really
going to to to be one close out
of out of those conversations of
the the the I had and and we had
collectively Rossell in
December.
Following the death of a.
A child.
In our area that was released
back to their parents and.
Very sad situation so my
question is.
Madam chair and representative.
If this.
Position is created.
Is that position going to be
able to do some of the things
that make the recommendations
that would.
Possibly
Change some of the protocols
that are currently in force and
effect that is.
Allowing children to be returned
to Hey Adam Beyer meant that but
they are likely to be re abuse.
In my case
The way that the child died.
I'm Representative I'm not sure
I understood the question is
this position Madam chair
representative is this position
going to assist yeah I'm.
To.
Thank change and some of these
policies bear.
Here to
allow some of these children the
the ball through the cracks if
you will and be returned to of
their parents in a condition
that likely to cause them to
suffer and
Yes.
Do you we offended.
I think I understand your
question madam chair
representative so so this is the
reason is that this position
this position is so necessary is
because we do have kids falling
to the sure the cracks we have
we have people who are
overworked we have children that
that are not being paid it paid
attention to like I said in our
last secretary went on record
with the legislature saying that
that child abuse is gone down in
our state and that was a lie and
he lied to all of us
I know people who have been
involved with selected CYFD for
thirty years and the problem is
getting worse.
And everybody wants to wait now
we have a new secretary let's
wait and see what they do we
have a new secretary now let's
wait and see what they do they
promised transparency over the
years we haven't got and we have
received at one of the COVID
semi clean mentioned was you
know they have yeah this because
of information ever a what you
don't get any of this
information with CYFD now.
I wish to tell a story I'm a
real estate agent I can't sell a
house if it has mold in it I
lose my license I have to
disclose everything when you
have a case that with the CYFD
is a black hole of information
I've had parents come up to me
that can't get a phone call back
I've had grandparents to their
who their children are lost in
the system I had social workers
who have filed complaints
against more supervisor and the
person doing the investigation
is the supervisor.
You cannot have that in
government you have to have an
outside source looking into it
we there's some really good
things going on with CYFD with
some real this is really bad
things is a lot of data that we
don't have and one of the things
that we do in this bill as we
ask for that data.
If you go to page seven there's
a list of things that were that
were looking for so that we can
might get reports on page.
Sorry I'm page eleven one of the
things we we don't have is the
fidelity we don't know how many
children die in CYFD care so
we're asking for and report in
those in those types of
incidents so there's a lot of
information that we're not
getting as legislators because
it's.
They don't want us years of age
is not you and so this opens
that up so I I hope that answers
your question
If not you can you can ask
again.
Raul you touched on something
that concerns me our.
And may be our Madam chair
representative you may not be
the one to be able to supply the
answer because you've already
said you did a low but I'm
wondering if you have somebody
Who may be on that that has that
information from from the state.
Those whether that case in
Travis county is is that the
only case the the the where the
child then returned to the
parents of that child and then
has been
of so what we abuse them and
died or or or is this a problem
throughout the state and how
many children have been returned
to their parents and supper
those those consequences are
madam chair somebody is capable
of answering that
I sure would appreciate the
answer it sounds like the
representative would as well.
And the minutes.
Representative all I can tell
you is that and the ones that
county just a few months ago we
had a woman to reach out CYFD
which is a very very brave thing
to do she was in crisis and she
reached out and she did not get
the help that she needed and we
now have another dead child in
my district.
But but tells me madam chair
representative that that the
Travis county case was not an
isolated case and
It saddens me that that we have
these things going on at all
best if it's certainly within
our power to put into place some
some steps Representative may
of backstop.
This type of behavior and be
able to discern whether or not
that child is being placed back
in an abusive situation or
should be placed elsewhere I
think we need to make those
steps
Madam chair representative.
Can submit a complaint.
I'm sorry what was the question
Representative.
Who can file a complaint
I think I heard somebody say
that the parents could not.
File complaints with the.
See what your raise types of the
machines that's actually
incorrect and I'm gonna have my
expert what you do that okay
thank you.
Chairman and members the
committee representative Nibert
I appreciate that question
because I know that was brought
up in public comments.
Just want to refer you to
because it statute it does say a
substitute caregiver or someone
else on behalf of the child.
But I refer you to page two of
lines six through nine looking
at the actual definition of this
substitute care giver.
So she cover cover just means a
person and then we put including
a relative of the child licensed
or certified by the department
for child placement agency to
provide care you know and and
that's all the you know in
legislative language that that
is including but not limited to
so really the definition is a
person so whether that's a
biological parent whether that's
a relative whether that's a
that's a neighbor that has
concerns about that child's
placement there you have the
ability to file complaints or an
inquiry with the the office of
the doctor.
The office of the ombudsman
under your proposed legislation
is our process under the current
law that would allow where.
And if so who can do that.
Madam chair representative.
Chairman queen members the
committee representative Nibert.
Again enter the differentiation
with secured by the council they
look at specific cases after
things that's sort of on and
they review those so under the
current situation I think is
Representative far AS that.
CYFD just set up an internal
process for complaints are for
grievances but we really believe
that I think it was benched and
by one of the consultants with
Kevin S. lawsuit that out
because of the culture of the
fear of retaliation that process
really doesn't work and so when
we look in budgets meant
standards and guidelines it
needs to be an independent
impartial body that someone had
bill safe to go to in order to
do these complaints so there's
not really this process that's
inviting accessible and safe for
individuals to go to.
Madam chair representative would
you have just the pace of this
but land would be working with
children.
People who are interested in the
child's well being.
To.
Get them.
I guess pointed in the right
direction and maybe a system and
you know they're grasping some
of their concerns that might
arise
as a result of these types of
procedures of the children are.
Foster care and not there's a
consideration for them being
returned to their parents or to
order someone some someone else.
Madam speaker Representative I'm
so CYFD that there's supposed to
and support and they do and
sentences find a lot of
information for it is there is
help out there for a lot of
these parents that that changes
by county by county where you
are in the state and also
changes by the leadership with
and it individual district
hello one CYFD agency works and
Bernalillo county is completely
different the Valencia County
then then down south it's almost
like there's no communication
there's really no across the
board across the statewide
policies procedures if you're in
the system.
It's it's it depends on where
you live and whether you're
going to have resources provided
to you and I just sat I've
actually had
My last encounter with the
former state CYFD secretary I
wanted to see a copy the
policies procedures I wanted to
actually see all the things that
they were talking about and one
day he was upset with me and he
just out we don't have a all
right they don't exist
additional at that.
And that's a problem such as a
grievance policy that does exist
that they tell I'm parents
foster parents and children and
they get that they can use but
if you go to their website the
link doesn't work.
So they're saying that there's
there is a grievance policy
within the currency rate the
system but the link doesn't even
work.
So.
And the question and then.
Well.
Thank you of course we does
Madam chair representative.
Hi.
I expressed some some really
heartfelt concerns that.
Works for us to to to many of
about how the process is you is
or is not working and.
What this position of bugs then
Yes encouraging or facilitate
that uniformity across the state
the that you mentioned there's
not exist currently.
Madam speaker Representative yes
that is our goal.
That is our goal because at the
end of the day I mean we want
children to be protected we went
we went parents that have got
lost in the system we want them
to get the help the help that
they need we wanted to have
resources this isn't about
taking children away this is
about protecting children and in
certain situations the parents
are not always the best place
for a child and we need to be
able to to be proactive in that
I've spoken to judges across the
state they don't even know the
right questions to ask when they
have these cases put in front of
them.
And even something like that
where it's like you know I I
should you know a a file or
something where if something is
missing in that file a judge
should be able to though okay
this is missing you know whether
whether it's a report from a
therapist or or you know
financial reporter or sexual
abuse reporter those type of
things those things should be
included when these judges make
these decisions about placing
the about placing these children
and these file aren't even
income complete in some
situations.
The server was county the the my
reference madam chair
representative.
I understand why there should be
a presumption that that child
should be returned to its
parents.
But I also believe that that
when you have the district
attorney's office the sheriff's
office yes ma'am and the costs
of on tier and in the case in
Travis county all saying
to the CYFD our of folks the
returning this child in this
instance zoom wise because that
child will be subject to
additional abuse because they've
been working with that family
that they they the DA's office
was familiar with the family the
sheriff's office was familiar
with the family and yet that
presumption that CYFD has.
Prevailed in that case and then
it wasn't shortly thereafter
that this child turned up.
There are suffering additional
abuse Ms and so it seems to me
that there ought to be something
the.
Would.
According to the equation.
The advice of these other folks
who have information that might
reveal.
That it could be dangerous if
they.
Give affect to the presumption
and I realize we would courts
deal with presumptions thank but
I.
I'm concerned that the.
Hello.
Concern that maybe
the agency does not deal well
with that or doesn't understand
of the countervailing
thank you Sir or something but
it I'm hopeful that if this
problems bugs someone gives
established that they can look
at those policies and help.
Help the HSD deal with some of
that because I don't that was
apparently the the of facts of
the image that was County K. are
having talked to the costs of
cost of broke some members
sheriff's office headed back to
the gate but
those folks both both said that
they were putting up red flags
and yep yep the the jar was
returned and the tragic result
of I just want to.
Do anything we can to keep that
from being repeated in a family
of has been repeated
throughout the state and I think
we need to do something so thank
you for bringing forth of this
legislation all right
I certainly supported and and
hope that we do everything we
can to keep this stuff from
happening again.
Thank you madam chair.
It
you very much
Representative could the vice
chair for questions.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative Fajardo I have
certainly been appreciating the
nuance in this debate and also
appreciated hearing the insight
from several folks that made
public comment
some of my questions have
already been answered as as
we've been in this conversation
but just to make sure I would
understand one thing I was
listening to someone I believe
from that from and and can
Erica's I'm just and it sounded
like they said only substitute
caregivers and children in
custody can file complaints not
parents or guardians and so I'm
wondering can you tell me why
I and I understand the
representative Nibert raised a
question about the ability for
parents make complaints and the
experts that they could be
included in in substitute
caregivers but for me as as a
parent someone that has had some
thank Gage met with actually
fairly significant amounts of
engagement with families that
have kids in the child welfare
system I don't understand that
peace that parents are not
substitute caregivers their
parents so can you please tell
me why why parents would not be
included in that list.
Thank you madam chair
representative thank you madam
chair and thank you
Representative I do if that is
such a great question and I
appreciate it because that
information is wrong it is wrong
and I'm going to have my expert
walking through it.
Madam chair members the
committee representative Cadena
R.
I I think maybe the drafting is
a little bit clunky in this and
I just go back again to.
Page two lines six through nine
and the definition of substitute
caregiver.
And the substitute caregiver
means a person.
A person would include a parent
the biological parents foster
parents the guardian tier C. Y.
FTE employee I. Nibert any
individual would have have the
ability to contact the doctor
spend with the complaint within
in query that the but that would
then be able to look at and see
if they want to move that
forward.
Thank you madam chair and for me
I I appreciate that we
potentially could capture
parents in the definition of a
substitute caregiver but I I
just don't find that to be
appropriate when we're talking
about an agency with such
substance and significance as
well as well as what it means a
lot of that the families I've
known that have been survivors
of trauma themselves we feel
them as kids eventually they've
become system involved
sometimes they they have not met
the safety standards to to
continue to retain parenting of
the of their children but
sometimes they put everything
they have into making sure that
they can find a different path
and potentially programming and
recovery and stability and
healthy and and and a healthy
way forward and I just think
that like for folks that have
been system impacted in these
ways that I I I just felt I feel
like they deserved something
more significant then
potentially being considered a
person in a sense to care giver
line because they are not
substitutes they are the
biological family that these
little ones come from so I I
don't have anything prepared but
I would I would certainly
appreciate some kind of
amendment that among other
things would include include a
knowledge mint and capacity to
name specifically and in a
ribbon and a clear centralized
right that parents or guardians
would be named out as folks that
could be involved on the other
side of this process.
I expect I will choose my
questions from our leader
Townsend and and madam chair so
I I'm good for now but would
appreciate such consideration if
this bill were to move forward.
Thank you thank you for that
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and there's a
very good point in drafting as
one of the things that we didn't
want to do is exclude anybody we
don't want to make it so narrow
that we we we prevented people
you know from because it should
it need to serve everybody and
they need to serve our families
even if you're a child the
sixteen year old you know that
that is is during the time that
you need to be able to go have a
place to go to.
And CYFD unfortunately its
psyche you know what happened in
the case in Travis county at all
these people saying don't do
this we had one person but it's
okay well that is the
marketability that system in
place right for everybody to go
to but thank you for thank you
for that and we'll definitely
keep keep that in mind
appreciate that.
Representative Townsend.
You madam chair thank you
Representative.
Hi I saw a report.
a few days ago that said that.
Why.
Participate in many of these.
Child Palicki.
Reviews.
But
they're not released I mean.
How.
How do we know and how do
parents know that they are
address they're not reoccurring.
Hello Representative how does
that happen.
I think it goes back to one what
I said earlier it and forcing
CYFD is like a black hole of
information like I said I had a
a social worker who filed a
complaint against a supervisor
the supervisor is the one that
actually did the investigation
on himself.
you that we've CYFD has been
sued about two hundred times
that I'm aware of and you know
it's very hard to find that
information Representative
McQueen reference just trying
you know damage that's been
physician did you get your
pressed C. Y. FTE.
They they they they they they
fall under you know you know at
two child protection we can't
disclose SB you know because you
know we have to protect the
identity of the child I mean I
got I'm sorry that's just about
yes thank you also have to have
accountability we also need to
know what's going on with the
children if you have bad actors
within organizations we need to
know who those bad actors are if
you have good actors and we need
to be more them as well if you
if you are in crisis need to be
able to have a place to go if
you it doesn't matter where
you're working across the state
there should be some continuity
that exists.
And like I said and I've spoken
I just I have people in my life
and doing this for thirty years.
Thirty years that I have known
people and it's getting worse.
And I'm tired of just kicking
the can down the road down the
road and just saying you know
what let's just wait to see what
happens.
It's frustrating I've been here
for ten years work working with
working on this case for ten
years I've are dealing with with
CYFD under two different
administrations this is the
governor spots this is a
systematic problem that needs to
be addressed.
Representative I.
I don't know how many times in
the last the.
Eight years that I've
a legislature that I have had
parents.
call me with heart wrenching
stories.
Of needing help us for help
wanting help.
And they just built like like
you said it's a black hole late
they call the and there's just
no response and
They anguish.
And the yes Representative
Nibert and I sat through.
That review in Roswell.
I mean it would be it would be
unbelievable that anybody could
listen to that.
And say.
That the issue does not need to
be addressed it does need to be
addressed.
So
You know for for a guy that
normally works with.
Facts and figures some numbers
so.
Things like that to get involved
in these and Watchet not just
one but I'm I mean we've seen it
time and time again I think we
have to.
Come to grips with the fact that
there's a problem and it needs
to be addressed.
And I I cannot.
Help but believe that what you
are offering is a step in the
right direction and we should
take a step.
No.
Whether we if we don't do that
there will be there will come a
time.
That people will look back on
our decision making and and will
shake their head and.
One of my they didn't try.
So I appreciate the.
I appreciate your.
Address the issue.
I know it's important to you and
to many that have yes I think
not afford to support.
Do I have for the questions I
want to spend a little time.
On
the other hand is raised on the
committee let let me just tell
you this
In courts corrections and
justice last and it was August
we heard
do presentation on on the
position at CYFD and I'm
wondering Representative farted
you attend that.
Madam chair I do not believe I
did.
And we worked with one of the
Maryland that.
And we made sure that the
Members of the committee
received turned out.
From the program that Maryland
was particularly interested in
and having present and we just
had such a compressed schedule
we couldn't
all the different models of on
the programs are
And our committee because we
were already booked when it came
out but we had the Casey family
programs a gentleman from there
gave an overview of all the
different models in the country.
And.
Jason did you participate not
did you hear that.
Madam chair yes I was on the
amendment I thought you to so
I'm.
It's also a number of our
members and and people who were
working on the office of Family
representation did sit in and
what I can to it was sometime
last summer where is your group
had a presentation by Colorado
right okay so the number of us
sat in on that it is like to
have a really excellent program
there and what what we wanted to
is that because we didn't have
time for a full discussion of
Colorado we did the overview of
the country the different kinds
of on the programs where they
were located and and what level
of authority they had and so
forth.
We offered and we did.
Give handouts from Colorado and
we promise that next interim we
would have a thorough discussion
of all the models and try to
support the the one that made
the most sense so I guess I was
a little surprised that there
was a message for the on the
program just because we you know
we had we just flex touch the
surface and we hadn't gone into
it.
With that said I and I have
committed that we were going to
do that next next interim and
and I would still do that if if
we don't get this thing
done but
What I'm wondering.
Is if you have received.
A copy of our committee analysis
Representative Fajardo.
The committee now so I don't
believe so madam chair okay
because we try to we try to
help.
Help the folks with that.
I emailed and I miss madam chair
but with your file system it's
been a nightmare.
Then as friendly as it was last
year.
We're trouble with it so I've
got a hard copy of it here that
I just got into my hands let let
me just say that at the time of
our meeting on are now secretary
Barbara Vigil had just been
appointed and she.
Listen to the presentation and
she met with C. gentleman from
Casey afterwards and
Had a great meeting with him
and.
I personally did not receive
any.
Log in from CYFD about this bill
in opposition I I can't speak
for anyone else and perhaps
members did receive or receive
from message but I didn't have
any at all and I just want to
say have a practice law in this
in this bill for the last eight
years and I have litigated
The lady again at CYFD and
sometimes I've been on the side
of the where the when I was
serving us at guardian Adlai
item or use internet and
sometimes the parents were.
Representative a lot of parents
who.
In the and sent thank heavens
this is particularly in Santa Fe
County they have just a really
really great office there and
they sent.
Thank heavens for for CYFD
because we have changed our
lives and our family is back
together so.
You know I filed motions for
abuse of discretion and I have I
have really
Gone to bat for kids or for
parents.
And it's not that I think
statewide do is without.
Close to an.
I'm really not I would I wish
that I had someone.
Who could help the first way to
CYFD to answer my
My.
Questions when the.
There regulations say they shall
do something and they were not
doing what they are they wish we
supposed to do so I I'm not
opposed to it at all there have
been bills though in front of us
that.
Didn't really
That we're really quite
Beyond the scope of what could
possibly occur there was one
last year that.
That actually allowed a constant
to intervene in the case because
that's not their role it would
it would be absolutely wrong for
the concept to intervene and I I
know we had
We have the substitute Care
Advisory Council say you know
this.
This is not the the appropriate
programs so I I guess when we do
this I would like to do it right
and I I know Representative
McQueen had asked to
Representative Fajardo if you're
willing to make some changes I
would really like for you look
at our our
Our committee and Alice's and I.
I want to say that you know
there are some very important
protections on
Confidentiality in our
children's code.
Right now our legislative
finance committee wishes that.
Some of those we're not so
strong that they couldn't
perhaps hope the department do a
better job but.
I I really think the attorney
general's office is raising
issues about confidentiality
issue student confidentiality
provisions and
What.
What you.
What.
Last year more with the entire
children's code not that the
children's code is perfect.
I've certainly done my share of
proposing changes to the
children's code sometimes
successfully and sometimes
unsuccessfully and there are a
number of us to really
agreed with codified in the
cavernous settlement and others
who didn't and we ended up on a
tie vote vote on that
legislation last year and I was
very sorry that we didn't get it
codified but I.
The message I got from Human
Services department at that time
it wasn't from the YMCA because
It was from Human Services is
just give us a little more time
and then and then we will be
glad to do that.
I would like for you to look at
this and.
I I I I'm really here the one I
want the representatives
of specially Representative
Thomson Representative nine were
to know that
I'm not excusing what occurred
in Roswell over the county by by
any means when I say I I just I
just think this is the.
I'm.
I also had to do needing at
least an hour meeting with the
folks in Roswell after they had
spoken with Representative
Townsend and either and
I told them.
They were the folks who had come
to me and have come to them.
They were going to do it with
CYFD and I asked the police to
the proposed changes to me that
they wanted to see and and the
assessment system.
This tool excuse me they had
been used to do.
The children's return to the
home state because I really felt
that that if that tool.
Need revision I felt that the
new administration would be
willing to look at that.
I'm sure I'm not wrong about it
but
I told them also that those
children were not well
Representative.
Their lawyer did not do a good
job.
Because they hold their attorney
they didn't want to go home that
they were scared so.
I'm actually hopeful that.
Improving quality representation
for the children is going to
make a really big difference as
well so.
I guess I just don't feel like I
don't want to vote no and I
don't yes I would like to have a
chance to see if we could
make sense.
Let me just give you an example
of some of the things they
there's a
In the analyses there's there's
criticism of it foster parent is
no substitute care provider
really the term that's being
used by UFC now is a much
friendlier terms called resource
family.
So.
Anyway I think that
It would be helpful if if you
wouldn't mind taking a little
time to look at this and also.
I'm wondering.
About the call around a little
and if you have to try to
incorporate it in there because
it was very impressive would be
heard from them I guess that's
finally a question.
Instead of giving the.
This diatribe here and I'm not
trying to do anything negative
go ahead and Representative
Fajardo thank you madam chair
thank you you Senator it out I'm
like I said we we have we have
we we have
reached out to steady arms but
it's been physicians throughout
the entire state this is not
something that's come out
overnight what ends up happening
madam chair with all due respect
is since I've been here I've
served under four different CYFD
secretary and every single time
it's always like let's give them
a chance let's give them a
chance they don't come to the
table they just want to kill
everything that comes through
because they don't want to be
held accountable there was a
conversation about creating a
task force we created a task
force.
And it was watered down because
that's what but Secretary
Blalock wanted so it was a very
watered down system and then
once we got it then he blocked
the public or anybody else from
attending at.
We wouldn't even let me as a as
a legislator the person who
wrote the bill to attend the
meeting.
So I I understand what you're
saying Madam chair of the line
item that there's you know some
problems but I want to hear the
frustration of my voice because
this is what we do we we wait.
And we're gonna deal with that
next year we're gonna deal with
that next in from and it's been
ten years.
For secretaries.
And so.
It's just you get to the point
where it's like
you know it is how many children
are are good I have a judge
called me a few days ago a judge
because she found there was as
and I don't want to go into a
lot of detail because of some of
the investigation that's going
on but she can even get so I
need to respond to her and she's
a judge.
And so so these are the problems
that we're dealing with I don't
have an answer madam chair but
we.
We we need we need we need to
fix this we need to fix this.
The one thing I want to say was
that.
Please everybody thinks eight
County because the mom did reach
out what happened there.
We don't have a system in place
to kind of wrap her around and
say let us help you.
And our secretary has said we
need that.
We've got to get that done and I
don't think anybody's you know
pointing fingers here.
But
what happened was the other
parent showed up and was
competent and so you.
But then.
He left.
And this poor woman was back in
her alone and nobody was
following up but it it's just
like.
We have to we have to fix that
and and I I believe the
secretary believes that as well
she is attending the meeting and
would would like to say
something would that be alright
with you.
That's fine madam chair just
like I I want to have expert
also discussed your question
about the Colorado my model
given the fact that okay sure.
Representative the committee
I just answer questions to.
Models because we just were
directed at us so we certainly
took Alan on the Colorado model
we also talked with that chance
which is a it's a national
campaign to spur policy prevents
nationally and in states to
ensure children foster care at
the highest quality of
apparently and they directed us
to look at bonds which is in our
understanding the most recent
sort of child welfare but it's
been legislation that passed
that passed I would buy this and
fashion recently so we really
looked at that one of the things
that we liked about that similar
to Colorado it's really this is
about looking at systemic
change.
One of the frustrations that we
hear from for more folks from
legislators the media is we know
there's an issue we know there's
a problem but we don't have the
data or the insight to allow us
to really effectively address
that through legislation or
policy and so really that's what
we got was you know we need the
doctor spends a to look at those
identifies those on on going
basis and and you know all.
You know to that to that meeting
that you mentioned with the
resume that CYFD held to a I
really appreciate that process
part of what we look at that
with the doctor Senate.
That's making the process permit
we always want to have a body
that is bringing folks together
looking at the issues and the
putting solutions for it I'm so
that's sort of where we looked
at nationally really Colorado as
well as promote to put together
legislation.
Okay thank you so much
I moved US secretary the hell up
to the panel so that she could
address the committee so here
you go madam secretary thanks
for joining us.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee and
Let me begin by of course thank
you Representative for heart O.
for your.
Really your commitment to trying
to improve our child welfare
system in New Mexico and I know
it.
You've probably heard it before
but let me just say it from from
my from my voice that.
I share your concerns about the
operations of CYFD and how we
can improve and enhance and
monitor our operations so
just know that.
I stand committed.
To making significant
improvements in our operations
and accountability.
Not only to you and members of
the legislature but more
importantly to the families and
children we serve and to the
people in New Mexico.
As chair.
Gail Chasey has mentioned when I
started this this job a few days
after I started I did learn.
Of the.
Concern about monitoring CYFD.
Learned about the work that the
Casey family programs had
presented to the legislative
committee the court corrections
Committee.
And I thought that that was a
great opportunity for us to
really.
Is that the best way in which
to.
Thank you so much for oversight
or monitoring or to enhance our
operations and that she
mentioned we are engaged in that
process as we speak today we
have engaged the Casey family
programs they are brought to us
a lot of expertise about how to
best.
Implement a system whereby your
concerns and the concerns of all
the stakeholders in New Mexico
can be addressed.
And it goes without saying that
we are in that process now as we
speak we will commence
stakeholder committee
stakeholder input in the process
of receiving that input input
beginning in March we will have
a report that will be issued and
then I will take very very
seriously about how we can
implement an appropriate
oversight on but it's whatever
you might consider
it to be a process because I
hear you very loud and clear
that we do need to improve our
system and I will take every
step right and to do that but I
am urging you to allow us to
embark on that process in the
manner that we have started
because I believe that it will.
Enable us to have eight eight
eight more
perhaps
and effective but it's Office.
There is nothing more serious in
in in my view that ensuring that
we're doing everything we can
doing it right and it's just so
disappointing and disheartening
to hear.
A lot of the stories that have
been shared here this evening.
But I can say this that we are
committed.
To examining our system of care
our child welfare system and
doing everything we can to
improve that now that is not a
quick fix that will not happen
overnight but I think the
careful and diligent approach
not to delay it but something
that makes sense that certainly
I can stand by and say yes we
will do this and this will work
because in incorporates a lot of
different perspectives not just
one side or one perspective or
another
that's the approach that I
intend to take.
I know it's frustrating I know
that many people hear anecdotal
stories I I'm I'm shocked that
CYFD did not respond to a judge
that me and all that we're
worried about something that
would be certainly addressed.
And more importantly more than
anything
we are taking proactive.
Steps to address our child the
talent needs and we have an
outside national expert
examining our processes and
procedures and will be issuing
something to me.
In order for me to make
decisions and implement changes
to minimize the risk.
Trials that's how it is in New
Mexico I could go on and on and
and let me just say I would like
to reach out to Representative
Fajardo and have a heart to
heart talk and explain to you
all the different things that
we're doing as we speak and
making and improving our child
welfare system but I can assure
you we take every.
My concern seriously.
I can already see that there's
change that there is a
commitment to addressing these
problems and then I will do
everything I can to.
Address these concerns in a
manner that I believe is in the
best interest for the people of
New Mexico and we made different
moving have different opinions
about certain things but I think
we all stand United together
that is about our children and
families and it is about how do
we do things better and how do
we make lasting change
carefully so that it is hasn't
affect the positive impact on
our families and so with that
madam chair thank you for the
opportunity to speak I'm here to
answer any questions I'm here to
just really state that our
commitment is to be accountable
in to be responsive to these
concerns and we take that very
very seriously thank you madam
chair thank you Representative
Fajardo and others on the
committee and I just urge you to
please.
Give us an opportunity to
examine how best to do this and
come back to you
next year and with that I'll
stand for any questions thank
you ma'am.
Madam chair may I.
Mask.
I don't I said yes but that I
put my new done right away and
you may have heard me thank you
and and thank you madam
secretary this is the first time
you have reached out to me this
is the first time we had a
conversation with me even though
I the bills and job for several
weeks if you haven't had a
single member of your staff
contact me there is a person who
did reach out to your office
three times they are just a
young man ran away from foster
care forty five days ago and is
missing.
And your staff not you are
missing a member of your staff
has responded to the family.
So.
Everything I hear I've heard
before I'm looking forward to
sitting down with you.
I'm looking forward to the
conversation.
But I wish you would come to me
before the still drop this
evening thank you madam chair
thank you madam secretary.
Madam chair respond to the.
comment that we have not
responded to the family who has
a child that they will be
dismissing.
Just I and I don't want to get
back and forth there are a lot
of.
Individual concerns about CYFD
and but just to say yes
Representative Fajardo I
actually took great interest in
that complaint in concern and
let it be known that we have
indeed responded to this family
member on several occasions and
have been in communication with
this family member about their
missing relatives so I can vouch
for that I
find that that
Documentation or what have you
about that but I think that's
an.
Perhaps a misstatement because
we have indeed responded and
intend to respond to every every
concern that its ratings through
my office thank you.
Representative Cadena.
I think you're on mute by
Representative the second time
thank you again for an
opportunity to expand on my
comments I'm Representative
Fajardo IAD.
Cannot say that I share your
frustration in that we each
experience systems differently
but I certainly agree with you
that number is then office is
absolutely necessary
in recent sessions I I
introduced as you did that here
and bill that would have created
an investment and position that
way to engage with the New
Mexico corrections department
because just fundamentally
philosophically I believe when
we as a government are locking
someone up or in this case
potentially removing children or
or holding the immense immensely
unimaginable responsibility of
keeping little ones in New
Mexico state that these two
offices in particular are the
offices that just.
You need a higher level of
scrutiny and engagement and
transparency with the New
Mexicans that were supposedly
trying to protect and care for
also I I agree and I actually.
Today not thinking that we need
to wait I very much respect
secretary but he'll I'm grateful
that we have heard the to ship
at the helm here but good people
have never been able to to fix a
broken system I've known and
respected all sorts of C. waived
the workers at different levels
of the agency that it put
everything they have their
intellect those their skill
their heart into fixing what is
so desperately
Ineffective.
And and we've had small
improvements along the way but
certainly something more
significant and more
transformational is needed so I
I would just say in full
transparency I'm not ready to
vote for this bill including in
part that parents are not
included I've done a quick
search of the New Mexico
misstated code in and of course
we know parents are very well
defined in the children's code
substitute caregiver list
different things I've also seen
that it actually says that it's
someone that's licensed or
certified so my concern is that
that will not inherently include
bio parents or family so just
again to say clearly I'm not
ready for it to take this vote
today because I still have
concerns about distracted
legislation I would just offer
that if you'd be willing to sit
with our analysts a couple of us
that have these different points
I would certainly be willing to
work pretty significantly in the
next few days to try to get some
language that we could move for
the session if helpful I know
it's it detention Lee I know at
chair Chasey nine others have
talked a lot about the Colorado
model the Vermont model of
course has learning moments as
well I'm glad you all lifted
some of the expertise but we
also have done the bills that we
could if we needed to just say
things are crafting specific
urgency also move forward in the
session so just wanted to be
transparent.
Not ready to vote for this bill
today is drafted but I certainly
I'm very interested in moving.
The forty two thousand dollars
to part.
You madam chair and do it for me
madam chair all of course.
Okay I'm just muted the chair.
but but yes I'm not ready on
this draft to date but I I would
like to move a bill like this
out of out of the legislature
and up to the fourth floor this
session so that's that's my
offer whether we work to
continue to improve on this bill
we have use a dummy bills that
help the process that's right
not today just wanted to offer
that because I think you're
right we we can all trust in
leadership and trust in the
direction and agencies going and
also say we have a real
responsibility in our left
office to make sure that we have
room take care for the little
ones in our state and their
families built their their
resource families and the
families the report into as as
we do our best and I've said for
too long what I've seen us do I
do even in their best intentions
is that we somehow take away
from take we some children whose
families are struggling with
trauma and substance use and co
occurring disorders when what
they really needed was like a
safe home and programming and
resources to care for them and
give and an offer a past that
might be full of possibilities
and we've somehow missed kids
who were being intentionally
neglected and abused and harmed
and somehow I'm like that's the
worst of bull we we've we've
done too much removing kids that
actually where the families all
deserve resource and wanted to
care and love I'm here and
healthy weight and we miss kids
who should have been who should
win State so that's my
commitment and all and with that
madam chair and thank you
Secretary for being in this
conversation as well.
Sorry I didn't realise my mic
was on just trying to tell
dealing with capital outlay
next I have Representative.
Not just a quick question
Representative Nibert has a
quick question but I I wanted to
I was just going to suggest to
him that you might need to look
up the answer that you may not
have it at the tip of your
fingers and I think it's just a
short question and then the
speaker has to stand up.
Thank you madam chair
Madam chair madam secretary I
asked the.
It's been a little while ago now
I just a question as we do
whether the.
K. and Chavis county last
November so was an isolated case
or whether it was one of many of
yeah and the question was how
many how many children have been
returned to their parents and
then have been
we abuse them and have died as a
result of that abuse over the
last maybe two or three years.
Thank you representative madam
chair.
Representative Nibert thank you
for the question I don't know I
don't have the specific number
of children who have been
returned to their families are
to their caretakers or guardians
of parents and then have been we
abuse however I must say that.
One of the most difficult things
in in this work is to find the
right balance between returning
a child to their biological
family they're care taker and
providing the safety network.
Around that return to home and
or removing the child from that
family and and keeping them safe
elsewhere so that's the constant
pendulum that.
Swings in child welfare and
something that we constantly
have to question ourselves I
will get you that information
Sir and I'm happy as I as I said
to Representative Fajardo I'm
happy to meet with you and
anyone else in this body about
CYFD and be forthright and
honest about not only are
complications but also areas
where we believe we can make
improvements that we will get
you that information Sir thank
you thank you madam chair and
thank you madam secretary and we
we certainly wish you the best
in in dealing with these
are problems that seems to be a
very steep hill and we're just
trying to do the best we can
madam chair I would I would make
motion for do pass of the
appropriate time so.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative.
Mr speaker your next.
Thank you madam chair I just
want to say by.
a group first of all.
Madam chair and madam secretary
I want to say the asset that
I just as far review hill is one
of my favorite humans on planet
earth and I am so pleased that
she has taken on this enormous
role responsibility I that our
is getting late and so I don't
want to.
I repeat a lot of us are even
said what I ate agree with that
tremendous amount of what
representatives for hard working
data have said
I have had a.
More experience and I would like
to have had in my private law
practice with CYFD situations
that have gone wrong some of the
well the most horrific case led
me to want to
Initiate the effort that led to
the Civil Rights Act
Us last year.
And I worry that.
There might be.
Practice is person a mix of both
ingrained so deeply into CYFD
that it might not be possible
for.
The secretary to achieve the
kind of changes needed are alone
or from within and I think there
is some.
There's something about having
an outside.
The ability mechanism in place
that might actually be helpful
to.
Secretary at CYFD yet to be able
to work with someone outside to
hold folks in the department
accountable
In a way that might not work
within the confines of the
bureaucracy that's set up there
I very much would like to see
legislation passed
I couple thoughts come to mind
because the way the bills put
together with the appropriation
on and the size of the
appropriation in the fact that
house bill two is left the house
whatever leaves here goes the
Appropriations Committee and
will stop there so and that's
just the reality of the budget
process.
So I would suggest to
Representative Fajardo that one
she see if there isn't some way
to make this bill work without a
standalone appropriation either
by making reference to the
funding is already at DFA you
know all your you have budget
adjustment authority in here
without it appropriating money
you can have some sort of you
know
You know add purposes to.
Finding this in the budget
authorized the use of vacancy
savings at the FAA to pay for
the operations of this office I
mean just the number things you
could do without affecting the
bottom line of the budget so I
would.
Urge you to please think about
that second we heard from vice
chair today at some thoughts
that are very legitimate
technical aspects to this
building have to be fixed
the confidentiality he's here is
very important I thank you
guarantees that biological
parents be involved is
critically important I also
think You know because we're
tomorrow gonna be passing
the
State version of the Indian
child welfare act forget it with
apologies to chairman Louis are
forget the name of what we're
have what is called the state
version but that's going to the
Senate tomorrow and you know we
you know every Sunday you know I
the issues and concerns of our
Brothers and sisters the
department governments that we
have with our pueblos tribes and
nations is incredibly important
to me and I think we need to
make sure that Sliq that.
As well
the vice chair and other members
offer to work with you on an
expedited basis to get some of
these technical issues cleaned
up and to address the issue of.
Native American children
families and I think it if we
can get that worked up with some
additional thought given to the
appropriations language here
this is something that I would
be happy to get moving ASAP I
think that the comments that
were brought up in a technical
nature from the committee
analysts
you were discussing those with
you in I think in complete good
faith we want to get this fixed
so that when it goes it's going
to be something that works
So if you're willing you know
we've we've heard is the work
and get started you know as soon
as tomorrow morning on either
through the committee cyber
amendments depending on how
extensive it has to be that.
I would certainly like to see
that happen so that you come
next week we might be able to
have some of the biggest sent
over to the Senate
Madam chair representative
Sarinana if you look at that but
username my commitment so thank
you very got the commitment of
the.
Vice chair to get this.
We're done and
Like I said you know you madam
chair is kind of late in the
evening
But I think that would be a
better outcome of this hearing
then
you try to push it with some of
the issues that have been
identified that I think there's
probably broad agreement we need
to be fixed.
Just down Mr speaker I checked
with our allies to my two
thousand said that
Representative the
The our analyst of the Canadian
Gallagher who analyzed it did
send the email to your office
this morning.
I'm actually not sure if you try
to send it to you or.
you madam chair this is that
handle Gallagher and yes I did.
you said that you emailed
Representative Fajardo and so
you should have.
Have your night time reading.
Thank you.
So are you willing to do that
will rather than.
You know madam chair I would
love to have Representative
cadenza work on this with me
okay she has the same heart that
I do in the same passion and
insight and so thank you Mr
speaker for for having the
commitment that to get this
through and I want to thank
everybody here because this is
so important we can meet we
can't wait anymore so I will
work on I work in the bill I
will get with the speaker and
I'll get with Representative
Cadena
as long as well as my experts
and look at this going.
And madam chair but if I can
also add I I know we have
Representative Nibert and leader
Townsend Here the proceedings
this committee and I hope with
there's a an amendment is
committee to
alter the appropriations
language to the bill can proceed
to help Representative Townsend
and I were are going to be too
mad at me that we're helping get
Representative Fajardo is
building.
We'll just leave that easy
anymore the point I think it
does.
I really want to thank everybody
here for their commitment.
To
Our state in these families.
All the families involved.
And we're going.
I I I have an announcement
Committee we're looking here one
more tonight and it's going to
be how straight resolution I.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative.
I thought it was represented by
that it's six hard so you're
staying with us Representative
Fajardo and I'm.
Representative Dixon take the
lead on this one I have a bunch
of phone calls to make after
this okay reporter to talk to.
Okay very good.
Thank you madam Dixon are you
enough okay let's get you up
here in the panel.
Good evening madam chair.
I do have an expert for this
bill up Bob pearls.
What is.
We probably.
A link.
Yes yeah.
Wonderful thank you and I I
apologize I said bills but it's
actually on house joint
resolution I that we are here to
present this evening and we'll
try to be brief and and snappy
how straight resolution I as a
constitutional amendment that
would allow voters who have not
selected a party affiliation
also known as decline to state
voters to vote in state
sponsored and state funded prime
primary elections for a
political party.
We've seen over time an increase
in the number of voters who
register while they may
ideologically aligned with they
don't want to be bound by a
major party political party
affiliation.
Here in New Mexico that's over
three hundred thousand voters
are predominantly younger voters
and we know that civic
engagement is essential to
democracy and so this is another
way that we can ensure that as
many people are participating in
the process possible I'd like to
I believe I co sponsor
representative Hart has left and
so at this point I'd like to ask
My expert Bob pearls of former
representative who many of you
know to speak a little bit more
about the joint resolution
itself.
Madam chair representative
Jackson thanks so much and
Representative Dixon and part of
thanks so much for being the
primary sponsor.
I'm Bob pearls former state Rep
and I'm the founder.
Involuntary executive director
of New Mexico open elections I
know there's a fair amount of
overlap between the first
committee that heard this and
this committee so I'm in a limit
my few comments to some new
comments and some different
comments
this bill is a constitutional
amendment this time around we've
heard a version of this for the
last three or four five years
common cause ran a poll a couple
years ago say that indicated
over eighty percent of New
Mexicans support semi open
primaries.
And so my vote means Republicans
can't vote for Democrats
Democrats can vote for
Republicans but rather only
independence would be allowed to
show up on primary election day
and ask for a major party ballot
so the old argument of strategic
voting or poaching
doesn't hold water and I want to
make sure that everybody
realizes that we model this
after a very successful bill in
Colorado.
Colorado's rather centrist state
Texas Utah Arizona all have some
flavor of open primary but we
chose Colorado.
Because of the success of their
it passed in twenty sixteen in
twenty eighteen over five
hundred thousand independent
voters new voters in a primary
or allowed to vote
parties in Colorado we're still
strong it didn't fundamentally
push the outcomes left or right
or center rather it was simply a
native of fairness because as we
discussed in the previous
committee neither the New Mexico
constitution nor the US
constitution mention party and
you really shouldn't have to
join a party to be able to vote
in a public election.
the next thing I'd like to
mention is there's been a lot of
research in the last couple of
years and some new exciting
research in the last couple
months out of USC in the Los
Angeles area that allows this
committee to make some better
data driven decisions and in the
previous five or six hours of
testimony I heard several state
reps mentioned that they wanted
to make decisions based on data
the data is very clear that
Hispanics.
Asian Americans and native
Americans register
disproportionately higher is
independence and in fact fifty
percent of veterans nationally
register as independents and yet
these critical blocks of voters
are prohibited from voting in
what is often the most
determinative the most important
election and that's the primary
election primary elections
typically a lot you're not
Affairs in these states in all
forty
eight memory legislation.
Turnout has increased.
The last thing I'll mention is
this reserves from US The New
Mexico and elsewhere indicates
that not only
are these critical blocks being
excluded from the primary but in
closed primary states there's
actually voter suppression going
on in the general in other words
when you can't engage voters who
vote less frequently in the
primary they tend to make a
decision not to vote in the
general and so this is really
about fairness it's about
expanding the franchise.
Two US citizens who simply have
chosen not to follow it with the
party thanks Madam chairwoman
and Representative Dixon.
Thank you madam chair we would
stand for questions.
Thank you Representative Dixon
and expert I will go to a poll
first for those folks still with
us on a Friday night to indicate
whether they are in support or
opposition to H. J. R. I and
then we'll go to public comment.
It.
Hey looks like we're not doing a
poll on the site.
but we can move to public
comment now so we will here's
apple seed oil age they are I.
So we'll do that it looks like
we have four people
participating tonight three of
those seventy five percent in
favor and one against so next we
will go to public comment if you
are in the attendees and would
like to make first a comment
against this joint resolution
please raise your hand for an
opportunity to speak for one
minute.
So we're going to opposition
first.
Kathleen Burke we see your hand
raised.
You've now been allowed to talk.
Madam representative I would
like to speak in favor please
okay I'm just a with this very
second does anyone in the
audience in opposition to the
state resolution would you like
to make it public comment if so
raise your hands now.
I'm not seeing any hand so we'll
go to Kathleen Burke in favor of
H. J. R. one.
go ahead and start your comment.
Of testing can you hear me yes
we can hear you go head right
and we thank you thank you madam
chair members of the committee
good evening and thanks for all
your hard work tonight I'm
Kathleen Burke I am speaking
tonight for the league of women
voters of New Mexico I am the
vice president of New Mexico
open elections as well I'm here
to speak in support of H. J. R.
I the primary voting on election
eligibility.
And all the inclusive system of
voting that allows all
registered voters to participate
in the primary election so that
voters who are not enrolled in a
major political party may vote
on one ballot per primary
without having to enroll in that
particular party.
So as well as declined to state
the league would like for
members of minor parties to be
able to vote in primaries as
well but despite that our
mission the legal stance and
strong support of HDR I and we
urge it to pass thank you madam
chair.
Thank you it looks like we're
done with public comments
Representative you said you're
ready to go back to the
committee.
Thank you I first see
Representative McQueen.
Thank you madam chair
Madam chair representative St I
don't recall if you were here.
In the committee last year when
Representative Garcia had a
version of this issue
It is one I propose.
Like to me I'll try to be quick
because it's late
Madam chair is one of the things
the first needs frustrates me
about this proposal is.
Frankly the arguments in favor.
Mr pearl said leaders are
prohibited from voting.
That's false.
Any eligible voter can vote in
the primaries States slick
party.
All you have to do is check a
box.
It's pretty easy it's not a
major commitment.
That's all it takes.
Madam chair representative
presented ten I'm I'm frustrated
by the argument that.
Well if they can't vote.
Yes yes Campos.
They should have to pay for.
The reality is couple things
one.
Government does a lot of things.
That I can't participate in.
Do we still pay for their taxes
and and actually more to the
point government does a lot of
things that I choose not to
participate in because that's
what that's what this is.
It was actually.
Will democratic reform.
To have the state run these
partners so the idea that we
should go back to party run
primaries.
I think is really
It's counterproductive.
I mean.
What would happen is you would
have these primary conventions.
And if you think a small number
of people decided candidates now
media may so what happens
primary conventions.
The primary is not the election.
Its primary it's an opportunity
for the parties to kick the can
is to represent them.
So it's not like.
It is not the same as election
it's prior yeah I think that's a
common misconception.
open primaries have been in use.
We'll be abuse.
That this will get more
sophisticated and some point
that issues will be successful.
In hi the lections they can they
can swing the result.
And we do see title actions.
I would point out that in the
last time I looked last primary
we had that had statewide
candidates so governor.
Governor land commissioner train
general those candidates.
On the Republican side and.
This is criticism of the public
and fund the Republican side.
There were no contested race.
Not one one of the statewide
Candace was contested it all
been already decide.
So if we have open primaries
there would be no reason to vote
in the Republican primary that
situation.
This year might be a little
rivers.
The there's only one democratic
candidate for governor
I think the Democrats you have a
few contested races.
I personally think the tree
General is important I actually
you know treasurer and.
I think we have one other other
contested.
Alright impositions but.
Yeah they don't really excite
the public so so an open primary
situation maybe the reverse
with.
That left leaning independents
DTS with the Republican primary.
So there's just there's nothing
about this the highlight.
yeah I posted before.
All those again you know I I
absolutely support the idea of
trying to get are used more
involved trying to get more
people to vote I think everyone
should vote I think it's it's
not just a right it's a duty
right I think.
You know I I would I hate to
miss election I'm very pleased
with our local election act
where we took all those little
tiny elections and on this is
insurances and things like that
and put them in the one I think
that's a great reform.
So I absolutely encourage people
to vote.
I think asking them to take a
party before the vote.
Isn't a barrier to exercising
that right.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representative.
Thank you Representative next we
have Representative Eli madam
chair all moved to pass.
Thank you for that motion I do
want to continue debate and we
are next have Representative I'm
going.
second motion thank you madam
chair.
Cavell one thank you madam chair
I just have one question is it
possible today's world you go to
the polls go to will to the
election balls and declare a
party before you vote and vote
in the primary.
Thank you madam chair and.
Representative Akan
under this system we currently
have yes you can go to the poll
you can re register
For one of the parties but then
you are a registered member of
that party I don't know Mr
pearl's would like to expand on
that I don't need to expand on
it that you to I think that
answers my question so basically
at a reduced so all you're doing
the same okay I want to go vote
but I don't want to sell a
Democrat or Republican but I one
of the.
That's what you're saying in
this bill is that correct.
That's correct state.
I'm sorry madam chair and
Representative Alcon that voters
who have declined to align with
a political party I should be
able to so select the ballot for
one
in a primary election day.
Thank you thank you madam chair
the only thing I can say is a I
just feel that you should have
the guts to be either Republican
or Democrat and that's all there
is to it thank you.
Thank you next we have speaker
enough.
You madam chair I just want to
make one point in that in that
is under current law.
Changes made several years ago.
One can be.
I decline to state.
Go on the primary election day.
And.
Be allowed to vote.
And Republican or democratic
primary.
We have a modified open primary
system.
Already that was not repealed.
I will be devoting Bill.
Several years ago so with that
is already in place.
so I'm not sure what we're.
Eating other than allowing.
Democrats to vote in a
Republican primary.
And vice versa.
And so you know and this year we
would have.
Lots of Democrats voting in the
Republican primary for governor.
Which I think would produce a
strange.
Outcome that the Republican
Party might not like.
So
I know we have a motion for the
past at the appropriate moment
madam chair I would like to make
a substitute motion to table.
Thank you madam chair and
speaker involved may we clarify
some misunderstandings with the
current proposal house up to the
motion to table to.
Madam chair is a table in motion
appropriate after the committee
comes first or do we need a
table in motion as the motion
without the.
comments.
You're probably right
representative madam chair.
Thank you madam chair so I'm
gonna go first Representative
Dixon to respond and then if
anyone would like to raise your
hand for another motion please
still.
Thank you madam chair and
actually if Mr pearl's could
please provide the clarification
that would be great.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee I hear what
Representative all call and and
Mr speaker are saying this would
in bad the rights of twenty five
percent of New Mexicans in the
constitution to be able to vote
in a primary
really registering to vote is an
insider game I know all of us to
run for office I think it's just
into intuitive that somebody is
going to be a Republican or
Democrat but in fact people who
are.
Just getting through the day
making a living don't
necessarily think about what it
takes to register to vote and in
fact in forty one states if
you're an independent you can
simply show up on election day
and vote and yes the so called
Fabian amendment a couple years
ago sort of snuck in that says
the DTS voter construct on
election day and vote but
there's also been a lot of
discussion during last session
this session on trying to repeal
that part of it and it's a
rather odd way to go about
guaranteeing what the
constitution says in New Mexico
it says very clearly every
electors shall be able to vote
in every public election
primaries are tax funded and
they're public elections thank
you.
Thank you Committee.
I move to table.
You Mr speaker and I said that.
That's a non debatable motion
home may we please call the
roll.

will.
