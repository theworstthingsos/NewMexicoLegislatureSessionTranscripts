Representative reap here
representative ream
representative sapansky here.
Vice chair here madame chair
here.
First on our agenda is house
joint resolution one session
link subjects and overrides
representative mcqueen and also
a co sponsor is senator
neighborhood and where is
senator neighborhood
we miss him.
We have a substitute for senator
niber
and we like also representative
heartburn thank you match i'm
not sure my substitute but I
emma a co sponsor
happy to see it here
representing macqueen.
Thank you venture then tear
members of the committee house
turn resolution one has many co
sponsors by person cosponsors by
camera coasponsors.
Um we seem this bill before
this bill creates two forty five
days sessions and several
current system of sixty thirty.
We've heard.
The thing a lot of discussion
about this the spills reached
the floor before.
I voted against against it in
the past and i've come around to
this view.
Because i'm not optimistic about
expanding our sessions to two
sixty day sessions
and I think you forty five day
sessions.
Would be an improvement over our
current process so as you of
course i'll know we have a sixty
day session three day session.
I think if we did forty five
days every year there would be a
certain continuity.
I think they're a bit be a bit
a learning curve think I want
the difficulties with our
current system is the back and
forth.
You know it's the piece is for
net in either session.
But like one year we have sixty
one year we have thirty it's
difficult to just back and forth
I think it's especially
difficult for new members.
The current system is newer
members at a disadvantage
because.
If they just get elected in
november and they start serving
in january.
And their first session is their
only session.
That they can introduce subset
for legislation.
The.
And that sir leads me to the
second aspect of this of the
joint resolution it's not just
evening out the sessions to
forty five days but it's getting
rear that your main this rules.
And that I think for the
legislative branch and for the
public his huge so the idea that
every other year we.
Don't control our own agenda.
And that we as members that
legislature are limited in what
we can work on
has been a source of continuing
frustration for me.
And I think it's how we did
something about that
and of course i'm doing by one
of my coast functors represent
our product like to give him a
chance to make a few comments
thank you madam chair committee
members it's a.
Great to be with you this
morning I I just want to share
three quick thoughts
the first is I want to echo it
represent mcqueen said I know
just remembering back to when I
was a freshman in a wide.
You know and coming in right off
the election in a sixty day
session for everything's german
and trying to get some good work
done.
Kind of get your feet under you
get a couple bills past and then
you come into a thirty day and
all the sun the rules are so
different.
Germanist thirty days and then I
was in your back on a campaign
in its you know good luck if
you're coming back
right I really
just believe.
Forty five forty five as a great
solution
for two reasons and that these
going to my other two points so.
The first is.
Uhm asking for a message.
Um.
This.
That is so frustrating to me
because we all have things that
we feel are very important to us
in our constituents to get done
in new mexico.
And and i'll tell you it's not
just republican versus democrat
or or whatever when I was I had
the privilege of being share the
tax committee.
Many years ago with the governor
martinez.
During the three day session
that I was carrying the capital
outway bill.
I was in a very awkward position
trying to represent the house
versus the governor.
And I did not want any
perception of a conflict and so
I did not ask for any messages
for my bills that you're I
didn't get any of my bills
really heard that you're because
I don't want to have that
conflict and I want the governor
to have something to hang over
my head.
Uhm.
And and I just I can understand
why this was put in place
decades ago.
But I think times have changed
new mexico has many problems and
we should be able to as a
coequer branch of government.
Bring up issues that are
important to us every session
and then my final appointment
here and community members is.
I'm i'm sure you've got to
answer so conferences and talk
with other legislators there is
a large variety and the size of.
Sessions.
Um but the consensus is all the
real work happens in the last
two weeks it doesn't matter how
long the session is.
I think three days is a little
short because it takes a low
time for the machine to get
going
but
madam share committee members uh
I don't necessarily think that
making longer sessions longer
than sixty days
it really be that helpful that's
why I really I really believe in
the forty five forty five
approach
so thank you manager.
Thank you representative will go
to the audience now those
wishing to speak an opposition
to how strong resolution one
please raise your hand okay yes
sir please identify yourself and
you have a minute and a half
ninety seven chairman is mason
graham on the policy directly
for coming cause to mexico
although we do agree with some
things and this joint resolution
like lending and removing the.
Generous rule one and exactly
powers it doesn't actually add
any more additional dates to the
we've hold voters on this issue
and voters have overwhelmed he
said that they would like to see
more days in our legislative
session so I think limiting the
fourth even number on the years
to forty five days may actually
be more but detriment to the
work that sent here since we are
going to be compressing even
more of the work that are is
usually done in that timeline so
for those reasons we do not
support.
Thank you anyone else wishing to
speak an opposition.
Madame chairman better where
it's major speaking on behalf of
a w and we also agree with.
I I think you know you look at
the hours
right now and we have lots to do
in new mexico
and I just don't think it just
keeping it at ninety days is
help us get the work done we
need to extend the session late
and I appreciate how much work
you all are putting in I don't
know how you do it it's tiring
even just being advocate
really do like the idea of not
having the.
And
and I think you know the
collaboration is beautiful to
see if it's objective you are
all and the by camera.
But.
Thank you thank you anyone else.
Amhana
madame chair members of the
committee I have a berlin.
And for all the reasons.
Thank you anyone else in the
audience wishing to speak an
opposition.
All right online.
See would you raise your hand if
you're online and wish to speak
and.
Actually there's one person.
There's someone with the initial
so if you could identify
yourself please and on you
yourself.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee and sponsor my
name is natine i'm a person with
multiple stabilities and just
stability advocate and I support
the bill in the interest of time
that will be the conclusion of
my governments thank you thank
you and we're in opposition
right now could anyone wishing
to speak an opposition to the
bill please raise your hand.
Okay
now let's go to the audience and
ask those wishing to speak and
support to raise your hand.
A claudia.
There's
many members good morning and
thanks for giving me the
opportunity to speak in support
of this bill some clutterizer I
served in the military for
twenty nine years and i'm
cheered.
Although the representative said
although I also agree with the
three.
But you don't work in the
military and in the government
for three decades to add a
pretty good so we support it we
also support longer sessions
thank you very much thank you
clarion anyone else in the
audience wishing to speak in.
A support of the bill.
Okay.
Those online wishing to speak
and support the bill please
raise your hand.
The.
I see ten anyone.
We're having troubles okay there
you go oscar.
Simpson.
Thank you madame chair members
of the committee oscar simpson
representing real grand
individuals fall a state chapter
over the national organization
individual we highly support
this legislation if we're going
to get anything done instead of
ever two years we need to have a
balanced yearly session with
unlimited constraints by the
governor thank you thank you
anyone else wishing to speak.
In support of the bill.
See anyone else with their hands
up we'll go back to the sponsors
any other remarks before we go
to the committee
mention if I may.
I just want to observe.
To me
the opposite effort to this
bill.
Or people who generally agree
with what we're trying to do.
But would prefer a different
system.
That we don't have.
In the reason i've come around
to this bill.
Is because even though I too
would prefer a different system
that we don't have.
I'm not optimistic we're going
to get it.
So this bill is incremental
progress they think it's really
important for the legislative
branch to stop waiting on.
A bigger change that's not gonna
happen.
Thank you matter.
Member is okay
representative chasing
the community
this time the sponsors represent
a quiz statement
I I wonder about tactics you say
you would support longer but you
don't think we're going to get
it.
What happens if both bills are
received constitutional majority
boat in each chamber and you put
him both on the ballot
um
resident chase I am not
concerned about that I I think
while that is um directly
possible I don't think that's
gonna happen.
Yeah.
Manager and representatives that
I really like both of you and I
also like the idea of not having
germanists.
As an as a a factor here but
you've got to have a plan here
now chair mental resume check my
hope.
With the we send both.
A joint resolution over to the
senate.
I will vote for both.
N you know I I just I don't
first I I think either one has a
hard
row the head because we're in
thirty day session or right now
time and you'll change his
heart.
You know but my hope is we send
them both over to the senate and
we continue that.
Mountain
representatives just
I always kind of hate letting
said it be the deciding factor
so that is put that to since in
there thank you minimum.
Anyone else wishing to speak on
this joint resolution.
Represent every man chair I knew
the due pass.
House joint resolution one made
by representative ream sec
second by representative reab
i'm glad we have you separated
otherwise it would be really
hard
before we do that I have a
before we vote on the motion I
have a few a comments
you know I think
where they say politics is the
art of the possible or whatever
you know and
I I am very mindful of what I
think we can get passed
given the fact that
this is an improvement.
Regardless of which one frankly
gets through
and I frankly think agree with
representative macqueen this is
the more likely one to get
through.
So I plan to vote for it I also
have a little bit of a question
about kind of some of the
language so find page two
every regular session of the
legislature
convening it still has the
convening
language and i'm curious to know
why that's still there and also
i'd like some explanation on
line twelve there's.
There are some language in their
previous and someone that I
think is had some confusion
could you speak to that
representative mcqueen.
Think you may have chair.
So when I asked for this bill to
be drafted I I thought it was
gonna be a current peace job the
free vispills and it proved to
be more complicated than that
and I went around there rail
with the council service on
language
won the difficulties we face and
these constitutional amendments
is were amending a document.
That is written and a very
difficult style so we can't just
put plane language amendments in
the document that is not written
in plain language.
Man chair member state me having
looked at this and and read the.
Uhm committee analysis.
I I think it may be appropriate
to strike.
Convenient during an evening
even the bird year online six in
the word previous online twelve.
So it read every regular session
of the legislature may consider
for veto override bills of a
regular special or extraordinary
session within the same
legislated by any and I think
that's the key limitation is you
can't go back and override the
bill from a prior legislature
yeah that if the legislature is
a two year period
that coincidence with with
our terms in the house.
I I think it's that seemed
legislated by any which is the
appropriate limiting language
in this.
Section of the constitution
are are right so I don't
normally make motions but i'm
happy to make that motion so
i'll those of you who have a
bill in front of you page two
lines six I would move straight
in convening during an even
number year
and also striking on line
twelve.
Previous
came
any right now that's my motion
of someone.
Insected by representative
reading
is there now discussion on the
emotion to amend.
Yes representative sapansky
thinking madam share and
representatives is by any
currently in the constitution.
I had not seen.
It may be but I just don't re.
Being there should that I wonder
if that should be
within the same legisla.
Mentioner
skinsky and I don't know after
top of my head um I can see if I
can find out
madam chair and representatives
i'm just the the reason I
pointed out is because.
The.
Then in the in the first
session.
Of a legislature
I think you could interpret the
word bianium to mean the
previous the previous
legislatures legislation that
was retailed which I don't think
was your intention with that man
chairman's in scansky it does
appear elsewhere in the
constitution.
Um urge four section sixteen and
I would not
the language the same
legislative bionium.
To me in the case.
The two year cycle not a
legislative buying and that
maybe it's every two a my
interpretation of this would be
that it the two year cycle of
the legislature
if one wants to rely on google
by any it is a two year term of
legislative activity I don't
know if that helps or not.
And that appears to be from ncsl
glassery of legislative terms
thank you madame share that that
the satisfies my conservative
boy you're easy to satisfy
yes sir yes mail on the.
The change that you're on online
twelve on page two line twelve
the so you took out previous but
how you wouldn't be told
override in.
It has to be the previous
session.
Member observer merit this is
that we're treating this is
actually what triggered my
concern because if we send a
bill up during the seston the
governor's required to act on it
within three days
so if you know you sent a bill
up on day twenty.
And it was vetoed we could
override that that veto in that
same session
so that's that's why the word
previous concerned me I are here
that now okay
great so we're on the motion to
a man and i'll just repeat it
one more time and that is line
six were deleting convenient
during and even numbered year
and online twelve were
eliminating the word or deleting
previous restriking okay
so we're on the motion to amend.
Any other comments on the motion
to amount any opposition to the
motion to amount no opposition
so we have an amended bill
I guess we'd say adopted the
amendment now just speaking
finally I think one thing that's
really advantageous to this bill
in the bill we're going to hear
in a little bit is eliminating
that governor's role men frankly
gives her leverage right.
We want our some of our bills
considered and then week of
course then worry about what the
request in return is I mean it
doesn't and so that's you know
we have to worry about things
like that and sometimes it's
oblique and sometimes it's
direct and that's part of
politics also but it's one thing
that puts us at a disadvantage
and I really feel like we need
to
be on a more even playing field
with the executive and this will
help us in that regard so many
other comments on the the bill
joint resolution one I don't see
any do we have emotion to
approve it a department
ream representative ring.
Yeah you did
okay very good and second so
we have a motion
for a do pass on high store
resolution one as amended made
by representative freemen
seconded by representative rebe
would you call the role
representative on
representative chasing
representative himbry
representative lane.
Representative martinez
representative mcqueen.
Yes.
Representative reap yes
representative
of green
representative sampanski yes.
Vice chair yes
madam chair yes.
By a vote of eu
one one

then chair would you like me to
leave her
I think i'd like well I don't
want you to leave I would like
you to come back to your seat
are we going in order of the
agenda or not
I would like to hear sorry in my
head I had represented figure
out why don't we know we did I I
would like to
talk about how strong revolution
five.
Sorry about that.
The.
The.
The.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Hi representative figure in
hello representative
morning madame terrane committee
I appreciate you humping these
together so we can really do the
contrast absolutely so the floor
is yours represent thank you
madame chair co sponsored joint
garage and madam chair we have
expert witnesses who have been
studying the issue of
legislative structure and
efficiency and I am too
professors from new mexico
professor rocket and professor
crebs and respect for the work
that they have put in on this
issue i'd like to let them have
a few words to start if that's
okay yes briefly
prefer professor professors who
ever want to go first.
Mountain chair and
representatives we are honored
to be here today to provide a
perspective on session by my and
professor mike rocker.
Timid I deeply respect and
appreciate the work that you all
do for our state report sturdy
and teach american politics at
UNM infirmly believe that while
the public is at the heart of
our democracy the legislature is
the most important branch for
representing their views.
It is what we tell all of our
students every semester speaking
of students we would be remissed
if we did not also thank you for
mentoring so many of our
students in turns tim and I have
a different times directed or
department's internship program
over the past fifteen years
those experiences are life
changing for our students and we
are very grateful for you all
for providing those
opportunities
we could wrote a palser report
twenty twenty two recommending
among other things a longer
legislative session the
recommendation stems from over
fifty years of research on the
subject in boils down to
building the institution's
capacity to meet the increase in
expectations from voters as well
as overwhelming work loads in
dealing with the economic
political and social challenges
facing our state as are hand out
notes the burden has
increasingly fallen on states
like new mexico to address these
complex issues as gridlock in
disfunction truly continue to
grab national politics.
Increasing session link has been
shown to increase productivity
enhanced policy in availation
improve representation improve
fiscal planning and enhance the
institutions ability to check
the government
sixty days legislative session
would provide the necessary time
frame for legislators to address
the wide range of issues
constituents care about which
improves lawmaking and
representation it is not about
passing more laws but about
ensuring each laws crafted with
the depth and foresight needed
for long term success this
additional time allows for
deeper engagement with
colleagues leaders experts
stakeholders and constituents
ensuring that the laws passed or
timely thoroughly considered and
beneficial for all new mexicans
furthermore extending the
legislative session with
strength in the institutions
capacity to negotiate and
collaborate with the governor's
office a longer session and
powers the legislature with the
necessary time to thoroughly
review and if needed challenge
google notorious actions thereby
reinforcing the essential
principle of checks and balances
in our state government in
essence this extension is not
just about creating more times
it's about enhancing the quality
of governance and ensuring a
more robust democratic process
in conclusion extending new
mexico's legislative session to
sixty days is about giving our
state the time and capacity it
needs to address complex issues
thoroughly and thoughtfully
ensuring that decisions reflect
the best interest of the new
mexico public.
Thank you represent a figure
thank you madame chair I
appreciate that time
time seems to be the topic of
the morning we don't need to
repeat that all of the arguments
for removing the governor's
power to send messages the issue
of german this needs to be
removed.
The issue at hand here though
is.
Well okay and I will say I agree
with the consistency of repeated
time if we can manage it
but what on the table but
different in this joint
resolution is time time that
will enhance the quality of
governing that we can do time
that new mexicans deserve I
think you all know because
you've seen this report.
This session length was last
changed in nineteen sixty four
fifty two years after statehood
that structure had lasted for
those fifty two years.
And it was sixty days every
other year
and if you don't think that
those legislators in nineteen
sixty four were cringing at the
car of coming in on the off
year.
A but it would cost their range
their business their family.
About what it would cost the
state to run another session.
But they were
bold.
They were visionary and they
built a structure that has
lasted for another sixty years.
But the world has changed.
And we need to be bald we need
to be visionary and we need to
build a structure that's not
about us it's about giving new
mexicans.
Good governance
and will last for another sixty
years.
Thanks madame chair and
committee represent it
everything has been said madame
chair and committee bit I just
want to add that it's giving a
voice to our fellow new mexicans
I had to leave a representative
harper that commented on our
comfort as new legislators
actually I felt very comfortable
just wanna I don't know if it's
a woman man thing but
I think i'll feel i'd feel just
as comfortable with sixty days
to forty five days but we need
to give our fell in a mexican's
time I know all of the skundreds
of physical visits from
constituents advocates and I I
feel like it's not just us is
legislators it's listening to
the voices of our diverse new
mexicans and I think that's why
I support the two sixty day
sessions and with that we stand
for questions okay thank you
i'd like to go to the audience

the added time
and I would also like it but
others have mentioned it but
agree with a representative
guaranteed her comment that this
the sixty days does app does
give a contituous more time to
engage the legislative process I
think that's very important I
would simply echo the other
arguments made in favor
especially if it's going to take
sixty days of sixty years to
make another change let's go
with the launder sessions now
and thank you very much for this
time and urge you support for
each year five thank you thank
you that concludes our input on
electronically.
The.
To the sponsors any other
remarks before we go to
committee no matter.
Madam chair let's go to
committee in ask an answer some
questions great alright
who representative ream
madame chair and and
representing figure out its same
discussion we have a government
but their groups but
and the professor there so
I agree and length
and if I remember correctly so
when we have to file for this
primary session we have to file
on march twelfth if I remember
sat correct is that your memory
it is the second tuesday of
march so every year it's a
different day yeah it's yeah but
it's about that so if we
increase madame chair and
reperceive if if we increase the
sixty day now we're running into
that fireway so we need the
and have to have someone file
for us or we're going to move
that date further down because
we have a hard date of the of
the first tuesday in june to
have our primarily election so
now we shorten the time that we
campaign
and must be honest opponent
could be out campaigning this
time.
Between the end of the session
and and that that
primary election and I I think
that's the problem with the
sixty day
thank you madame chair and thank
you representative for bringing
it up again because it is of
tremendous concern to a lot of
legislative it is an issue
it's in terms of filing day.
It is a technicality that is
already addressed in law in
statue one dash eight there has
twenty seven.
So we are already allowed to
fill out a form and have a proxy
file for us in our county clerks
office we do not have to be
there in person it's.
It's not even a solution that we
need to create but it's in a
good example of the technical
issues one of which is brought
up by the fire of things will
have to look at and change if we
change session length like the
date by which bills must be
introduced these these technical
things would change when we
change session length so thank
you for bringing it up with
respect to campaigning madam
chair and representative I think
every day we are up here
working on behalf of our
constituents interacting with
them and would stake holders to
craft policy
where the newspapers were on the
tv
are constituents are getting a
good sense of our value so I
don't I don't think we're really
losing out i'm campaign time
well madame chairman and
representative you know how I
voted in
in government elections I
believe the forty five day forty
five is the best solution but
thank you
thank you madame chair i'm sorry
I didn't convince you this time
representative.
Thank you madame to the only
thing that back to ask this is
possible to change it to where
we don't meet in santa fe
is unaffordable that's all thank
you very much
thank you I have on my list
representative of sapanski and
then ribe and then
superpresent a sapan's and
thinking madame chair and
representatives I know that you
put later work into a lot of
these initiatives
for me I think you know I have
spent a lot of time thinking
about what would be the best for
a policy making and for the
people of new mexico and I think
it
when I think about some of the
most complex bills of the last
ten years or so many of them
happened in a sixty day session
and I think that the sixty day
allows for time for negotiation
time to bring lots of different
parties together and that's I
think improves the product of
the legislation but then I you
know the other side of this is
that
um I think for many legislators
it costs money to serve and
there is a.
There is a real.
Um
there's a real benefit to the
people of new mexico and a
legislature
looks like our state and
represents is truly
representative of our state
and i'll aspects of diversity
and and background and
levels of income and.
Working parents with children
grad mars and grandpa's into the
whole just to have that complete
spectrum of perspectives I think
is really important
so for me you know I mean III
think in the end there will
always be a certain number of
people that will do it because
they
have they figure out ways to
carefully navigate and
you know remain solvent and pay
all their bills and because they
deeply care about the work that
we do here and and they want to
be in a role of public service
name so I I don't I would love a
your response but I think you
know the hard thing for me is
another two weeks
that's that's being added or
another month that's being at it
is
it starting to think about it I
mean when I think about
conversations i've had with
people who were interested and
running for the legislature and
then you tell them we'll
remember it's not paid the
predemn doesn't really pay for
the cast for something I am very
blast to live in santa fe we are
sitting in house district forty
seven right now
and I know that that is such a.
Advantage to me and that's why I
am able to to serve honestly
with kids and full time job in
all the other demands that uhm I
have for my to my family
but I think about all the people
that you know i've spoken to
over the years who say wow there
is no way that I could figure
out how to navigate all of that
and then when we talk about
adding a month to that it is.
It's just hard so I you know I I
will say I I would love to
respond to a I am supportive of
this because I think it's the
right thing to
bring all of these diverse
opinions together and get really
great legislation forward but I
think it will be will be burning
through legislators more quickly
I think is what is potentially
what will happen people will not
be able to sustain this level of
service
without addressing some of the
other things.
And i'd love your respons.
Madam chair that is a
fundamental concern.
It is essential that we maintain
diversity of lived experience
and experiences and voices in
our senate and house.
Um and I will say that the
reason i'm not proposing to
ninety days
it's
it's a balance.
And I am grateful that this
committee is looking at several
joint resolutions this morning
to look at the entire structure
and what will best serve new
mexico going forward
and end sixty days stretched
that balance of being able to
serve and create good policy and
interact with stakeholders.
And hopefully.
Not cut into the diversity of
voices that we have because that
is essential but the diversity
of voice.
If they don't have time still
cannot accomplish the work.
Manamed chair.
Medium share and representative
I just wanted that this is in a
new problem it's been a problem
since nineteen twelve when the
men wrote their horses in the
buggy serve there you know and
the women stated home so it's
not a new concern until recently
are legislature was favoring
mostly men mostly wealthier
people people with specific jobs
so it's just a new chapter of an
enduring reality that space to.
Think think you represent.
Thank you representative
think you madam chair kind of
following up on what
representative you said also
she as she's here gets to go
home every night I haven't even
been home yet and in the sixty
day I think I got to go home
once and on the whole time i'm
also trying to figure out how
sporting three kids who are all
in college and so to me it is a
little concerning also to length
in this period I could probably
do a forty five and a forty five
but in why understand the need
for it it is very hard for some
of us on the eastern side of the
state or up to you know and so I
and I know you understand that
and it's just I am glad you
brought that up because I think
it is something to consider for
also for me madam chair
something follow up on
representative said this is a
time i'm gonna get home and and
while i'm working on it I live
in a rural community that's not
really online to do online
signatures I got a collect all
my signatures and i'm doing that
door to door sometimes I guess
have sheets out everywhere but
i'm a person that i'm going to
file myself I am not going to
put that in the hands of approxy
well that's actually it
available because it's a it's a
huge thing to make sure your
paperwork stand properly you've
talked into your clerk and so it
concerns me that I I was
thinking about that like what
was what would be if this was a
sixty hour would I even do that
how would I get ready and
running saying campaigning the
same getting my signature is
getting filed and making sure
that it's done right
so that is my problem with it
being a sixty day session and
then of course the financial
aspect of it and and being away
from home for it for that long
for someone like me so just
something to consider and I
understand we're just looking at
different options but I was glad
that representatives brought
that up so that those are my
concer.
Nineties scares the heck out of
him and I baby they would have
been back but thank you madame
sir thank you represent of
chasing
favor manager thank you about
and and both of the professors
as well
i'm gonna look at it just from a
policies down point because I
don't really think I should say
well and you know it's been hard
for me financially to sir as
long as I have an I probably
could have been more successful
professionally had I not been
doing this but the the whole
issue is we aren't in april
branch of government.
We aren't professional at all
this is part of being
professional to begin to have
longer legislative sessions I
honestly think ideally it would
not just do one piece at a time
it's easy enough to change the
election code i'm not saying
that it would can't be part of
an amendment
but on
the filing date is what it is
because it's convenient in its
were used to it it doesn't have
to be
in alterable in the future
I mean you could even change the
primary date i'm not suggesting
that we do that but we simply
cannot take governing as
seriously and be as good at it
as we should be when we're so
rarely incession
the internal companies are
useful but we don't act.
Um I honestly think we have to
start the new amount whether
i'm gonna get home for something
and I think other legislatures
in other states don't
necessarily stay in one place
for all the time they may have
sessions and take breaks had
come back and and so forth there
and I don't even think we could
begin to continue like that know
all we would be able to think
about it is within her own frame
of reference and that's probably
not what's best for governing
but until we are here more and
are more professional in frankly
get paid and have staff we're
never going to be the equal
brand to government so I I will
vote for this
and the only reason I didn't
want the forty five decide I
think cutting fifteen days off
of our sixty day session is
really good to me tough I mean
course right now that's the only
time we get to choose what we're
carrying
what we're going to work on and
III just think it's time to get
out of the nineteenth century
and it may take more than one
session of constitutional
amendments to do so but
I will support this and I I
honestly think quite frankly any
opponent you're going to have is
probably has probably been
working for a long time when I
heard that might the soot I hold
was coming available I started
working in the far of the year
before the ele.
Seems true all your opponents my
opponents there they've been out
there doing things
so that's the way it is.
And if quite frankly if you had
if you had staff I am not
talking about staff to run your
campaign but just staff to help
you you'd be able to devote more
time to your your campaign and
to making sure you're in the
stituans are getting the
services that they
that they're they appreciate
from you know it's not
necessarily that they expect
them cause they haven't heard
much of constituent service in
my ears here fortunately the
chief clerks office is helped
people work they list out with
tax and raver or whatever but
you know if we keep just talking
about how it's going to affect
without thinking friday I mean
not that we shouldn't be looking
at the human human factor but
the whole issue of.
Are happy and have other jobs
and trying to balance those with
carrying for family it's it's
some it's it's a burden et is a
burden and and yet there's no I
think there is no greater honor
than to be able to serve
in due public service
it just caused a lot right now
for us
I hope we can don't think about
what's best for the state they
can manage her
representative mcqueen
thank you manager named chair
rips
I support your bill
I will vote for it um I wish you
looked on the house floor and if
it makes it over to the senate.
I wish you the best like there
I do have a question
charities did you hear the the
amendment discussion we had on
my version of this in would you
entertain that same amendment
yes thank you madame chair thank
you representative I was hoping
someone would bring it up yes
the at those amendments need to
be made to this bill as well
although the line numbers seem
to be slightly different I don't
know why
the text of these bills are are
the same but looking at line
five on page two.
Removing convening during an
even numbered year.
And then and this bill is line
eleven removing the word
previous.
Manchero I would move we make
that amendment.
Did you have a question
represent involv.
III hear you and i'll do that
house at okay you're welcome
the there's a motion to amend
the bill made by representative
queen second and by
representative remarrow and the
the amendment that proposed
amendment is on page two line
five uhm deleting
convenient during an even number
year
and then online eleven deleting
the word previous.
So that is the motion.
It's been moved in second and he
discussion about the proposed
amendment
seeing none any opposition to
the proposed amendment.
No opposition to the amendment
so we had now have an amended
bill so we're back to the bill
representative thank you
matcher.
Okay anyone else madame charles
do paris on how straight
resolution five.
As amended
we have emotion for a due pass
on joint resolution five as
amended made by representative
remarries seconded by
representatives of ski
before we
consider the motion i'd like to
make a few comments and ask a
few questions if I may
have you considered in would you
be willing to amend the bill to
change one of the sessions so it
would be this one what is it
even near.
To forty five days instead of
sixty days.
Madam chair we haven't had those
discussions yet with his
sponsors the other joint
resolution it would be an
improvement.
Over what our current situation
is in new mexico
but a small improvement and I
wanted to wait to consider that
option of compromises.
Until this committee here's the
next joint resolution which to
me plays a big part in it.
Okay disappointing
because i've been talking about
that and i'm not the only one
i'm sure who's been bringing
that up and you know
when a bill I think it's our
committee there's a purpose for
committees it's too little down
what is going to the floor and
these bills can take two to
three hours to consider so if we
send two bills to the floor we
have the potential for eating up
in a thirty day session i'm
looking at my dear friend over
there firing at my dear friend
over there for quite a lot of
time just so we can get
something to the senate and they
can tell us what the it right
answer is and that's not how I
don't think I was elected to to
act to give first of all spend a
lot of time when we should the
committee has a responsibility
to help the bartie make
decisions and then it's the
floor that it shouldn't be
sending stuff over to the senate
so they can tell us and they
have the ability to dictate what
the actual policy of the state
or so you know I just can't do
this we're going to send to to
the floor and the there we go
and let's see how it all plays
out just too much time and we're
supposed to make decisions here
on the committee so.
I'm had this bill been a forty
five sixty day or
you know i'd be welling to to
vote positively in favor of it
but I think we need to think
about doing something else with
this and and give our body I act
responsibly as a committee and
give the barty are
recommendation not simply pass
it through and i'll tell you I
get real frustrated when the
first committee we are often a
second committee does exactly
that
so I guess you want to respond
to that because i'll have some
other comments as well represent
if I don't go ahead what
managers have procedural
questions that you already
passed ours joint resolution
even if we change this one now.
Then you would be passing two
bills to the floor again so i'm
not sure what you're asking for
adam chair fair enough what I
would have preferred if the two
sponsors that actually sat down
and come up with a joint plan I
don't know how many times it's
the second i'm i'm speaking
represented frame did is this at
just on on that point or okay
shoot
madam chair if you make that
proposal that change it to sixty
and forty five I will second
that motion okay there is a
thought.
Okay I will make that if you
want to make that much why don't
you make the motion represent a
ream and then wait what we have
emotion on the floor so let me
think about how this works.
Would do we have to
vote down would you be willing
to withdraw your mouse and
motion representative mcqueen.
Okay
until we can cons.
So the consideration is to.
Okay
second representative
okay so all right represent
every
madam chair I would make emotion
that we change it to sixty days
and forty five in we will have
to look at our builder get that
proper
I wonder if we ought to have
both sponsors step out in the
hole and come back in five
minutes.
Yeah I mean I don't know how
many times i've had a bill
that's a lot similar to somebody
else's bill and I was told
actually I think often with
representative of our con is
often squeezed me on that way in
that way and we've we've been
told you guys go figure it out
and we're not going to hear
about it so i'd like to see if
we can figure it out before we.
I'm happy to bring the bill back
in this session in this in this
meaning.
And you're looking irritated
maybe I know you so well
represent my queen
chair I usually look irritated
yet this is
it
is resting
then chair on the point it's a
you know it's an interesting
discussion
III.
Think you want one of the things
that i'd like about my proposal
is I have uh support from the
other side and I think if I
wonder if I wonder if we expand
the session if I lose lose some
of that support.
All right well we have a motion
to a man this bill
in such a way so that it would
be the even number year that
would be I think forty five days
so let's see where that would be
each regular session show
annually session
okay so.
Line thirteen nine thirteen.
So what happened was we would
have to strike the amount meant
that we made earlier right
because that had this business
about even number year and.
Then.
Yeah.
Actually I think we're talking
about the opposite rep
representative of where we'd
keep the sixty day for the
evening or lower way wait
and the odd number year and then
for the even number year
wouldn't we do the forty five
days.
Line thirteen even number years
to forty five days.
Madame chair
so I believe in mind twenty
three in my twenty four would
need to strike that bracket
reinstate that language same
thing online.
Twenty five five
page two lane world.
All the way through
line too.
And then strike thirty.
Anyone insert forty five rate
after the word exceed.
In then we weren't let's see we
would keep the actually we would
keep the amendments that we've
already made on the bill
convening during all this
delineation of types of
legislation that would be all
continued to be stricken
correct yeah I believe the veto
override language would stay the
same so let's see if I can get
this rate on.
Quality control check so what I
hear representative reams
amendment to be is on page one
line twenty three
removing the brackets strike
stricken editing so we're kip
were keeping convening during an
odd number year or keeping that
and then we're gonna be keeping
also on that same page and every
regular session of the
legislator convening so that
means we eliminate the bracket
and we are eliminate the
striking on that line twenty
five oh sorry representative
ring ahead.
Okay line thirteen we're not
theory a lot in the title oh in
the tide or thank you line
thirteen.
Okay so we're in a strike sixty
and lines thirteen and put in
forty five.
And line twenty four oh we're
gonna okay no
we want this one to be sixty
right
she took out the brackets.
Okay yeah no problem so now
we're going to go to page two
and we're gonna eliminate the
striking in blind one and on
line two were eliminating the
stricken and were eliminating
the bracket.
And then online three we're
going to add forty five.
That's the special session
madame chair I think
what we can't have everybody
talking at the same time
representative sapansky manager
I think that's line page two
line two yeah drive thirty
oh right answer forty five after
exceed i'm very good.
And same unline three and my
road both that now no special
okay sorry my bed
okay we're leaving the the word
thirty on line three because
that relates to a special
session all right and we're
keeping the amendment that we
met previously made.
Anything else represented of
ream or other helpers.
Okay represent every month thank
you madame here i'm not
following wireless would make
sense
to do sixty and forty five the
symmetry of forty five forty
five sixty sixty provides
consistency and his vision our
ability to understand what the
time frames are
as are from a rules perspective
waters the benefit of having a
forty five day versus of sixty
year to hear I get just put this
in the same sort of complexity
in my opinion from what we're
out where we are now with thirty
and sixty.
I can't think of the benefit of
why that in balance works you're
to hear it's the the amendments
representative so represent
every new who seconded th.
No one we need to know if we
need a second okay emotion made
by representative reading second
by representative sapounsky
speak to your motion
madame chairman in
representative remarried when
i'd look at representative the
queen's proposal at forty five
forty five we have the same
number of days
it during the two year cycle
when we go sixty and forty five
were actually early fifteen more
legislative days in the two year
cycle I
think that if we go sixty days
in our current year where were
filing I think that's too long
and impacts our campaigning
and that's why i'm supportive of
the forty five days in this
evening number year.
Did you want to speak.
Madam chairing in
representatives are in
representative and yeah i.
I like this because I think it
allows for the additional two
weeks of policy making
while we are still in a climate
with an unpaid citizen
volunteer.
Legislature so to me.
It r.
The.
Representative chasey were on
the most the amendment right
I was trying to answer
representative the vice chairs
questioned madame chair which is
that
we've added some days to
literally two weeks and a day in
order to get more serious work
done but still recognizes that
it's an election year and the
thirteen people feeling the
pressure because of that for
deadlines and primaries it is
recognition of that and I think
as
it's fairly decent compromise in
my view
and and then when we become
when the legislature becomes
more professional and paid then
that discussion could be
revisited.
Um chair the two things one
I think we formulate the
amendment I don't think we've
asked the sponsor it's friendly
we should we should still do
that in two
to
the very serious point of
continuity I actually I think
there's something significant
there.
The the back and forth I think
one of the problems with the
sixty thirty as the the change
in the cycle the different time
frames that will we look at in
you know arguably
any number we pick is arbitrary.
Sixty thirty forty five I mean
these are all just sort of round
numbers
I not.
Suggesting we change the
amendment or adopt a different
amendment but you know in my
mind we would be better off with
two fifty two days sessions
cause it would restore that that
continuity or two fifty days you
mean we we can do any reason
really pick any number we want.
You can get a not suggesting
that but I do think there is
advantage to having the sessions
being equal.
Time period every year thank you
matter thank you representative
and you make a very good point
representative figure out isn't
this friendly
I guess last night i'm like
really feeling it
matter.
A balances.
Decreasing.
The diversity of voices in our
house and still adding time
especially if we are removing
the limitation for your mainness
so it's an acceptable
compromise.
So we have a friendly what I
hear to be a friendly amendment
somewhat friendly anyway and of
any further discussion on the
proposed motion to amend and
i'll repeat it again because I
know it's confusing all right so
I see now for this discussion
i'm just going to repeat it so
we have it and then will vote on
it so we are changing in line
thirteen in the title of sixty
to fort forty five we are
online twenty three we're
removing the bracket and the
deletion that and on line twenty
four we're removing the
bracket and the deletion and
online twenty five were removing
the bracket and the deletion
online page two line one were
eliminating that deletion and
online two were eliminating the
deletion but were striking
thirty and adding forty five.
And I and all in the other
amendment that we.
Weekly acted on early a stays so
we got that all right do you I
think we should call the role on
this one.
The motion was made by
representative of ream and
seconded by.
The.
Okay so call the role please on
the amendment on the amendment.
Representative alcohol
representative of chasing.
Representative of him bry
representative lane yes on the
representative martinez.
This.
Representative of mcqueen

Representative reap yes
representative dream in yes

representatives the cansky yes
price chair yes

house joint resolution five s
twice amended
our ic
excuse me
all right so we have a do pass
on the second amendment we have.
And so now we're back to the
bill as twice amended and do we
have any further comments on the
bill.
I don't see any
representative of ream mentioner
I move it do pass is twice a
minute.
Okay we have a dupass motion on
house joint resolution five s
twice amended made by
representative ream second and
by representative chasey so

we still have the issue of two
bills going to the floor I know

about what we were supposed to
do when all that but will still
be able to talk about it on the
floor but madam jamie if anybody
wants to sign on their welcome
to sign up

yes represent me i'm happy to to

your assistance that way thank
you so much okay very good
representative mcqueen were on
to your next bill.
Oh we can believe it come

Yeah.
Give us a second organizing
ourselves a little bit.

House joint resolution too
pocket veto eliminate pocket
vetoes
representatives them chair
members of the committee
mission to.
Proposes to him in the
constitution to eliminate
architecture if there's not in
any way limit the governor's
ability to veto legislation it
just asks the governor to tell
us why.
And with that.
The.
We'll stay in for questions and

sponsored anything one at

I have to present on house bill
one or two oh wait we have one

house resolution seven sorry
about that
okay.
Yeah.
So we are on house joint
resolution seven commission
legislative salaries
representatives rubio and
garrett.
Thank you
madame chair and committee
members
you all have made the perfect
arguments this morning for why
we need a salaries i'm hoping
for a unanimous vote
we're here to present on house
joint resolution seven you've
seen
this legislation before it
proposes to add new sections to
the constitution to allow
legislators to receive a salary.
Um and what we're also trying to
do was to create a citizen's
commission that would not only
establish salaries but would
also make those adjustments
it'll be charged with reviewing
researching considering salaries
every four years and if and when
we passed his out of the house
in the senate it would go to
voters for
it'll be on the ball it and so
the constitution would be the
constitutional amendment would
be put to them in twenty twenty
four
and if the majority of voters
approve the constitution the
legislature would then do any
enable enabling legislation to
implement the citizens
commission during our session
next year
I want to provide an opportunity
for michael sponsor to say any
more if necessary but I think
much of what you all have talked
about already this morning in
terms of diversity of our
legislature and
how important it is to have a
number of lived experiences
representing our constituency
salaries I think is in an
incredible
step forward and
and so well i'll hand it over.
Thank you madame chair and
committee and cosponsor i'd
simply believe it's time to give
it to the voters and we see our
budget shows our values and I
think we need to value the state
legislature as much as we value
the executive and judicial
branches and finally to some of
the people that tell me that
it's a honor to serve his of
volunteer
with the exception of a predeem
I would just say that if you do
not wish to have a salary you
don't have to accept a salary.
Um so with that stand for
questions.
Very good um let's go to the
audience those wishing to speak
an opposition to this bill
please raise your hand.
Don't see anyone those online
wishing to speak and opposit.
I don't see anyone
those in the audience wishing to
speak in support of this bill
please raise your hands I see
hands okay let's start on the
side first okay good morning
matter chairman of the committee
with a serious on the chapter
again representing our thirty
five thousand members orders in
new mexico we are in strong
support of h seven and I think
it's a sponsors just
conversation that has been going
on this morning really back up
to for the spell I want to speak
as my role being one of the
lobbyists with our chapter I get
to work with lobbyists from all
over the country and people I
was baffled when they hear that
we thought they are legislators
in new mexico by having i'm paid
legislature we're actually doing
at the service for new mexicans
and the people that may want to
serve the future able to the
work you all do is very hard you
work long hours and days and we
all appreciate what you do as
citizen and legislative citizen
legislators but times they have
changed in the cost of living
has increased legislators
deserve to be paid for their
hard work of the people of new
mexico and we are just asking
you we'll vote yes and standard
strong support thank you very
good next
go ahead madame chair members of
the committee just like country
again vice president of c h I
children and large home visiting
program experience lots of joy
journey with parents prenatally
children reach three years old
and as we advocated for the
constitutional amendment we
experienced joy when seventy
point three in favor and a lot
of hearty higher to that trying
to educate legislators on early
children because we found
there's so many legislators were
far removed from the experiences
of parents with young children
and so this is one of the most
important resolutions we feel
before the legislature because
it creates an opportunity for
compensation and to bring up
more voices of parents.
Next on the side sir.
Thank you matter makes a
grandfather coming because of
mexico as we know we have a
supporting politics shows that
our voters would.
Like to see our legislators pay
the salary and interesting part
of that poll is that when we
accident what what do you think
your legislators are pay a
majority of them said that you
all are paid about seventy
thousand dollars more so there
is a little missed information
being spread about you know how
you guys are actually
compensated I think at this time
with this pale data conversation
that we're having now that are
public of the new mexicans would
like to see a change in how our
government is ran this of course
is going to be an investment but
I strongly believe that our
legislators are worth it for the
incredible work that you do here
on conversation with everything
that's working thank you next
ma'am.
Thank you chairman of the
community my name is very
christy I live in southern
center county I won't turn
twenty nineteen last year was
the first year I started coming
here with various groups to work
on the bills I support I don't
represent anybody i'm just a tax
parent and i'm so well I think
the credible amount of work ever
all the representatives do any
hours you put in high special
appreciate the comments that you
made representative read and I
think that we should find a way
to pay every member of the
legislature thank you thank you
anyone else on this side of the
room okay now let's move to the
side meritus.
Madame chairman members of the
committee of the american
association university woman
now
speaking strong support for h r
seven it is time to pay
recognize the hard work of our
legislators you will reduce the
influence of campaigns
from lobbyists to have.
Decent salary of course what the
salary will be that salary
commission will come up with but
it will be a wealth studied and
I think you know I think the
idea here is
it's just unfair to ask people
to serve and the way you all
serve without being compensated
so for those who say well we
can't pay you're not paying
yourself it is a commission that
will.
Thank you very much for all you
do and we're very strongly
support.
Thank you hannah did you have a
hand.
Madame chairman members of the
committee had a burling league
of women new mexico and the
league believes that there is a
cost to government and.
And not by the personal
sacrifices of legislators.
And we also strongly feel that
we cannot ask legislators to
work in longer sessions without
just compensation so we ask the
duty of this resolution to do
pass thank you thank you yes sir
did you have your conduct.
If you can see wrangle again at
a chair members of the committee
thank you for public comment
again my name is decade rang on
the social director of new
mexico conference at bishops
representing the freedoms
themselves in new mexico and we
believe in the labor desert this
wages and poppy hurt that before
and I know a little bit about
voluntary
and what I do
the people and it is a sacrifice
and I can't thank you guys
enough for your sacrifice but
also your families.
That also sacrifice along with
you.
And many hours that you take to
do what you do and i've heard
are the same comments that were
said before it is a sacrifice
and we just appreciate what you
do but also you need to be paid
for what you do so we ask we
were do pass on this resolution
thank you
madame chair and committee
with your family
in mexico is the last all
volunteer force.
And the military one to it all
volunteer force happened to
vietnam war but we got paid.
And we think you should be paid
to and this is come up in years
in the past i've talked to some
legislators who are not in favor
of it and I really like
representative point that if you
don't want to get paid don't
accept it get into a charity but
I think the lack of pay you end
up with rich resourceful for
retired legislator service and
it changes the representation as
many of the other organizations
here have been talking about for
example we only have seven
veterans serving in the new
mexico
bases here we've got one of the
highest percentages of military
and veterans in the state but we
are the second lowest in
representation and I think that
not being paid is a barrier to
entry.
For veterans and for many other
people so the better in the
military family's talking to the
new mexico strongly supports
passage in the bill and things
representatives for bringing
thank you anyone else in the
audience wishing to speak in
favor of the bill.
I don't see anyone those online
wishing to speak in favor of the
bill please raise your hand
court.
The.
Not good morning again madame
chair members of the committee
current regular lutheran
evoximistry mexico and also
speaking for the new mexican
conference of churches I also
strongly support hgr seven
while i've been very pleased to
last them reviews to see the
changing demographics of her
legislative body are offering
much slate of sellers I think
would definitely open the door
to the fast diversity of new
mexicans to serve in this way
even more I think too often we
assume others life experiences
of the statements are ursence
has been obvious in the
legislature as well and I think
all barriers must be removed
that limit pool of potential
candidates and I think hgr seven
proposals solution for our
state's legislature I urge you
to support this bill thank you
for the time to speak to this
morning
thank you
let's see a lister.
The.
Thank you madame chair members
of the committee elisa kenny guy
former organ legislator with
five very quick points one yes
it's very fair to you I can see
how incredibly hard here working
too it's particularly important
if we are able to lengthen the
sessions three really
importantly it enables
legislators to do far more work
during the interim when they are
back in in their district and
not getting a daily allowance
for when you're in the building
I gave up a full time job in
oregon with benefits in order to
take the job which is paid in
organ basically at about a half
time salary it was about thirty
one thousand this enabled me to
at least give up a full time job
and make the sacrifice to do
that but I could not have done
it without that
for if it allows a greater
number of people to participate
as been mentioned and fair from
one thing that hasn't been
mentioned is I sent you an email
with the report from ncsl
national conference on state
legislators uh twenty seventeen
report that looked into all the
ways that
different state legislators are
raising salaries and the
independent commission so that
you aren't setting your own
salaries was indicated is by far
the best way to go to a hope you
have a chance to take a look at
that reporting I hope you pass
this bill thank you
hang.
On.
Yes thank you madame chair and
representative my name is hungry
and with no miscall asian family
sender a community based number
of feed providing casually and
linguistically specific programs
and services to the asian
pacific islander and I did how I
am population in your mexico
since twenty eighth two thousand
and six i'm here to support this
bill because there is a like of
apin h representation in the
house as one of the latter
fastest growing raised ethnic
group and eligible voters from
twenty ten to twenty twenty with
thirty seven percent increased
making up two point six of our
step operation we only have less
than zero point five
letter state the identifying
sapinage we are grateful to have
a representative of simpensky
here and we would love to have
more of you know representation
in the house please support this
bill thank you so much for your
head one.
Thank you
john martinez.
Thank you madame chair.
Thank you madame chairman thank
you members the committee my
name is jummer king is time
representing conservation voters
new mexico and
Just stand and support the spell
and pass it thank you very much
thank you
Many members my name is chavis
from new mexico need a vote we
are insurance support for hr
seven we are an organization
that helps recoup potential by
part candidates so that we can
see our legislators better
represent the diversity that we
see in our communities because
we know that if we are diverse
in our in in our legislators
then we also know that we have a
diverse uh potential for great
policy the biggest objection
that we hear from folks is the
lack of pay we do not need any
more barriers to those who may
want to serve their communities
in addition the strain that
legislative space who need to
work part time or full time jobs
is an unfair burden this while
our legislators to fully
participate without worrying for
providing for their families we
appreciate all the work that you
do for those and all the reason
is stated before we ask that you
do that you pass hjr seven thank
you.
Okay we have two more austin.
Eighty mad and charion
representatives my name is
austin we actually and i'm with
new mexico working families
party and we stand today and
supporting her seven while we
understand that you are all the
primary affected body of this
bill and we're not trying to
tell you what you need that's
really the first part of what
we're going to do today while we
understand the honor and
privilege it is to serve and the
value of the important work that
you are doing we also understand
the challenges presented by our
unique legislative structure
which is truly one of one we
understand that while you were
all the affected community of
the spell today you have an
opportunity through this bill to
extend the latter down behind
yourselves or your community to
those in new mexico who would
find those unique challenges
prohibitive of service to
empower even more new mexicans
to be a voice of their
communities needs and to build
additional support for those
among you could missing out on
work who find difficulty making
ends meet through your service
and who see the problems created
by our current structure which
make governance prohibitive to
only those who can afford to
serve while this may at first
less seem like telling you what
you all need we understand that
this is an opportunity to
acknowledge the needs of working
families in santa fe and for
those reasons we ask her pass
thank you and lastly bell
jordan.
Thank you madame chair bill
jordan with mexico voices for
children we stand in strong
support of this resolution and
really want to thank the
sponsors for all the hard work
they've done
to bring it to this point there
has been an astounding
transformation in the last few
years as our legislature has
become more diverse including
transforming our tax system
where you all have made the most
progressive changes of any state
in the nation I look forward to
the day when an even more
diverse and more representative
legislature is able to represent
our kids and our families we so
appreciate all the sacrifices
you are make to serve thank you
thank you concludes our public
comment back to the sponsors any
additional comments before we go
to committee.
What.
That's okay manager will will
stand for questions.
They give me madame chair and
representatives
I just wanted to I don't want to
believe the points we've heard a
lot of really wonderful
testimony
but what I did want to just
clearly establish what their
husband a lot of research into
you what exactly is the job of
the legislature of the
legislators
what like how much time is spant
what types of activities could
you just briefly state you know
number of hours per week that
there was established in the
research that was done in terms
of the activities that are
conducted you're round I know
that
the public is all too aware of
what we do and we're in session
but
what do that research reflect
about the job of the let of a
legislator.
And think you representative for
for that question
one of the but one of the things
that we've been working on over
the course of the last couple of
years through.
Representative commissioned a
study with UNM
I always forget the acronym
beaber but they actually did a
lot of interviews with
legislators and white they came
up with was that many of us
actually do a lot more work
outside of just attending the
session and on average I can't
remember the number I don't know
if you have it about twenty
hours a week that most
legislators on average spend
with their constituencies back
home.
Thank you madame chair and
representative and you know I
reflected iron.
Um what both legislative
salaries would do before the
diversity of the body but also
what it would do
for those that currently serve
and how that might impact their
work and some of the things that
came to my mind were you know
if I was able to work less at my
other job I would be able to
host more constituent meetings
which I currently do once a
month I would be fantastic to do
those once a week every other
week
conduct more research on the
legislation so that I am ready
for the legislative session
bringing diverse stakeholders
together earlier so that you
know potential opponents of
legislation or
members of the other party
having more time to just spend
time with them communicate with
i'm really understand where
they're coming from on some of
those issues and also attending
interim committees you know we
each bring our own profession
set up professional experiences
but we're as to voda and bills
that touch every aspect of new
mexican life so having the
opportunity to attend interim
committees that maybe don't
relate to my personal
professional experience would be
incredibly valuable to me as a
policymaker
I did want to just raise a
couple ish questions about the
bill
page to specifically page two
lines
twenty four and twenty five in
page three lines to and three I
was just curious.
Why in this bill are we
changing.
From the irs to the gsa
on the perdian rate and do we
need to do that for the mileage
rate
could you speak to that matter
madam chair and representatives.
The.
Thank you madame chair
representative so while we were
working on the draft with the
session
our art legislative council
this was the recommendation that
they had made that it was in the
best interest of this
legislation to do.
Thank you madame chairman
representative I just wanted to
make sure that we weren't using
the gsa rate also for mileage
then.
Because i'm page three lines two
and three it does reference the
irish again and says mileage
rate
and i.
Don't have the earned.
I don't have the knowledge to
make a recommendation on that I
just raise it because I am not
sure.
Perhaps I can
consult mr bursiego other rest
of the community committee
speaks on that
and then on the first page.
Made one lines mine twenty one
we are establishing the citizen
commission as an independent
state agency.
Which
I just wondered if that was the
right
entity to be creating.
Just because independent state
agency implies to me and entity
with year round employees that
would maybe be working on.
There's an I just wondered if
you could speak to if you have a
vision
of what the this commission
would be and how it would
operate.
Think you madam chair and think
you representative.
Part of the reason why we went
in this direction and it was
mentioned in public comment is
that.
National council state
legislators and other states
around the country was this was
the direction and and and where
most constituencies supported.
And so.
We definitely don't envision
this being a long term state
wide I mean i'm sorry a state
agency that is has a full time
i'm ongoing staffing but when we
had previously
proposed this legislation before
it was going to sit in an actual
agency with then stay government
but
the more research we did and the
fact that we wanted this to be
as independent as possible this
was the direction which we had
decided to go on I don't know if
representing you had a.
Thank you madame chairman
representative so it sounds like
using that terminology and
shores the independence
also means in an.
Appropriation process we would
be
appropriating directly to the
agency rather than
dealing with the executive
branch in terms of control and
direction for this agency which
I which I see the point and I
think it's a good thing to
ensure that a strength of the
legislative branch
okay think thank you I will
check madam chair and represent
I will check on the mileage
issue madame chair
it says here in one of the
analysis that committee analysis
predeem expense and mileage at
the same rates as provided in
subsection a for service that
meetings required by legislative
committees established by the
legislature to meet an interim
between sessions so followed
that for the mileage.
Thank you madame chair thank
you.
The.
Thank you madame chair and
representative do you know what
the g s a pretty embraced is in
the irs
read.
Madame chair and um
representing i'm sorry meaning
that perdium rate
i'm sorry the perdium rate
that.
Madame chair and representative
says in the other committee I I
want to go through some of this
when we look at the salaries
across the us basically
new hampshire is a hundred
dollars a year and I think the
high is
new york state they just raised
it to one forty five you know
there's bended discussion that
the mean and somewhere around
sixty thousand year but I think
one thing that's not discussed
and the public should understand
as well as our members here and
i'm going to go through our
current retirement that we have
and it's a formula and so if you
are
briefly I mean I I think it's a
point but we don't need to hear
the formula if you just want to
give us a sense about what we
get and retirement I think that
okay
yet so many chair basically
once you do two years service it
doesn't matter what age you are
with the current calculation it
would be about seventeen
thousand eight hundred and
ninety two dollars per year
for the rest of your life and
you know if you were
thirty five or forty years old
you'd have it for the rest your
life thank you madame chair
and I believe that's the
compensation we receive for
being a legislation that doesn't
quite account for eating right
now but why don't we go to
represent reap
thank you madame chair and thank
you
the sponsors of this first I
just want to earn thank all the
comments and it's nice to see
that people acknowledge that we
do work very hard and I wanted
to say that I do appreciate that
and I guess for me it's a little
harder because why do struggle
to.
You know as I stated you know
make money to support my family
and then be able to go where I
need to go I also am a very
type of person that when I got
into the say I knew I was
getting into this without pay
and i've always been somebody
who likes to to give my service
and he was a prosecutors you
know for a twenty five years I
didn't make any money in that or
even really in retirement so
it's just very hard for me to
want to accept a salary and I
understand you don't have to
accept the salary but so I
struggle with the fact that.
The people in my district
elected me
knowing it was a good via
volunteer service madam chair
and and I feel it it still
should be a volunteer service
despite
you know that it is hard and you
do have to make concessions and
things of that nature and so
I really do appreciate how you
acknowledge how hard we work
because we do work very very
hard but volunteer aspect of it
and not being paid I think it's
part of it for me I would also
say manager and with the with
the whole eventual calculations
of what.
A legislator might make and I
decide to take the salary as
representative reams that it
could be you know.
Thirty thousand dollars twenty
thousand dollars so then I think
well okay let's say that let's
say it's twenty thousand dollars
manager of sponsors and then
that is not going to be enough
for me to not have to still work
but now i'm going to be
considered probably well I feel
like i'm a full ten legislator
but a real full time legislator
where more in my time is going
to be expected as doing those
types of services but yet i'm
i'm gonna have to actually still
work more
to make the ends meet that I
need to make for my family so
worry about this just be in more
difficult if we do a salary and
then the salary is up being what
I think it would probably be
pretty pretty low I could be
wrong I don't know how they're
going to determine that so those
are my own reservations about
the and salaried
madam chair and so I just wanted
to state that and just again
state I appreciate that you
acknowledge our hard work and
what we do in and for me
personally.
I'm willing to do that just to
because that's what I signed up
for ourselves I just wanted to
say that but thank you thank you
very much
thank you representative
representative
thank you madame chair I guess
making sure this with
if you want to if you don't want
to accept the salary you can you
don't have to take it what
process would you have to go to
do that.
Madam chair representative what
this bill does is is asked
voters it will create the
commission all those questions
like that will be in enabling
legislation when we come back
after the elections and and set
those processes in motion so I I
would I couldn't tell you right
now but that's definitely
something that would be
considered when we do enabling
legislation
madam chair regardless of
whatever happened the single car
salary that the legislature yet
would be taxable just like the
ten ninety nine that we get
today is taxable
so
if you were even if you refuse
to take the money you would
still be issued at them to do
for
and then you would have to
figure out a way to
have to do
to figure it out how to take it
out of your tax
anyway it sounds difficult to be
III i'm not sure how it would
work I don't want to tell you
that I have a problem with
taking a salary yesterday she
would with produce.
Love said this before one year I
made the most money and they are
the legislators in the state of
new mexico.
And that newspaper debit card
not only represent my producer
but they are supporting that
pound out but my retirement I
don't know how they found out
how they faved out but they even
found my retirement was from a
and they added my food and my
retirement together and they
told the public how much of
money represented the value code
was making
now and with the predict made to
be like twenty three years
together it was over fifty grads
or the I would they just he met
with this really awesome story
about how router was getting
being legislator
she could imagine what they're
going to do they decide to go
through
at any time it's the power to
press such that they can report
whatever they want you don't
like what they said a new right
a letter back to them they can
infuse to accept that so that's
the power to present it really
well with you but again if they
will do take a salary now to be
actually expecting us now that
we're salaried at twelve brand a
year or so they're going to be
expecting us to be for their
people this week is going to get
paid big money to be a
legislator
the salaries there's no way to
make sure because they would
come up with sixty thousand
dollars a year for legislator I
know that so it might be
we
might be active yet twenty four
thousand dollars a year but now
we're going to be a full
everybody's going to expect for
us to be a full time
employee understanding new
mexico even though we're now so
that's why i'm
at the other thing that i'm
having a heart break out is that
the
burden
that burned on is instead of us
doing something.
Lower center in
the rear to check in the way
we're setting up the commission
so they can decide to do this
instead of us.
You know the people people that
are related
Thank you very much
representative chasing and then
representative
amount thank you representatives
for all of your work on this
over the years and I know you've
taken this very seriously I
wouldn't speak to a few of our
representative about
consquestions that's.
I think that
if you wanted to
you could put retirement plan in
here so that the commission
looks at the retirement plan
because I don't I don't
necessarily think it should go
without someone kind of
adjustment at the point that
people are paid depending on
what they're paid because if
it's going to be a pittance and
I really think twenty thousand
years of it is it's not going to
help somebody who has to pay a
mortgage who has little children
at home but.
I think you could put that in
there.
If you're not going to put into
a constitutional amendment how
one would go about four going
salary that's way too much
details but that will be in the
enabling legislation and there's
no way on earth that.
I I don't see how if you're
going to.
Decline the salary you'd end up
getting a w two saying you've
got it.
I I just think that's
beyond the pale and it makes no
sense and i'll help you sue the
irs
as far as the
having a commission
I think that.
If you think the newspaper goes
after you and and they and if
they did that to represent a
milk I know which newspaper
probably did it because that's
brisbale to measure privacy and
and it's absurd to think that
when you're going to a committee
meaning and paying for a hotel
and you've driven six hundred
miles round trip then somehow
you actually got a hundred and
eighty dollars back in your
pocket.
That is absurd
so
quite frankly I think we should
have been responding i'll learn
to those kinds of claims
they've they've done note before
and they picked somebody
is retired and has more time
to travel to interim committees
I haven't been retired until the
last couple of years
especially I have it in the
practicing a lot of last couple
of years because of family
demands
but most of the people who had
the big travel budgets were
retired and they were driving to
interim committees in crown
point in silver city
in claim I mean it
is it just shows how armed
honestly such disdain for what
we do as volunteers that III can
stand but
if you think they
go after us now if we tried it
raise our own salaries
that'll be all about feathering
or now.
And but if you you know i'll let
let the commission look at how
to
whether there should be
adjustments in the retirement
which very likely there should
be and some
representative rain was pointing
out if the return is generous
but it doesn't pay the bills it
didn't hear my bills back in
nineteen ninety eight when I was
paying
well everything said my life
that made it difficult to be the
big health in nineteen ninety
eight so
you know I
it doesn't do anything for some
months ability to serve in the
present and to devote once time
fully
so
if we want to continue to be
secondary branch have government
then don't do this but this
should be done in the
professional way to do it
ideally is to use a commission
and get really respected
individuals on that commission
and
let them talk to the public
about it and
otherwise we're
seeing it to read their horns
battery ness and it we simply
can't make a decision like this
ourselves I just don't think.
They come into just a couple of
quick comments first
first to documents point on the
the newspaper articles in recent
chassis touch on this I agree
they think they ran those
if you hit those articles and
didn't address any of the
underlying factors.
And in I I agree that there are
some membership retired in might
serve on ten interim committees
I mean I dropped down from three
to two because three was too
much.
In the other thing I felt was
the people that lived in the
corners of the state
had higher numbers does he drive
further and they're more likely
to drive the day before it spend
the next day because they can't
get from one place to another at
the morning up in there is no
discussion that the article I
thought it was I thought was
really unfair
I am.
I'm not going to discuss the
personal impact this would have
on me and my family
but there would be substantial
who would make a big difference
and
what what I really think is the
most important point is our
current system is
tight democratic lilty
democratic
people can't serve because they
can't afford to do it and we
have a system a government where
anyone can get like that should
be able to
personally talk to people.
Typically young people who are
interested in running
and decide not to because it's
just not feasible
we need to fix that I mean
that's a huge wrong for us in.
Were in the reasons we haven't
fixed that yet
is because we in the legislature
have a huge selection bias
problem.
All the people designing on this
issue are people who want where
you're another found the way to
make it work
so we're not a representative
simple of the people of the
mexico.
So we're perpetuating the system
that goes here
and in that problem so
send it no chair obsessed thank
you for all of your continued
work on this issue
any other members wishing to
speak on this bill if not I have
a few comments.
So
we expand a lot of our personal
income at least a number of us
do.
Above and beyond the predium
that we can
so for example but those members
with large districts have to
drive a lot in the interim and
actually even without large
districts like me when i'm going
to lost crucials we do get
product we do get mileage for
that but interacting with with
our constituents.
We get we do not get predement
for interacting with our
constituents so people who are
living you know
large vast districts are
absorbing all of those costs all
of them but I have been advised
that I can use my campaign funds
for that and by the way i've
been advised a number of times
when I asked have asked if I can
get reimbursed for something
i've been told to use my
campaign funds so which I find
really offensive in that not
only m are a bunch of us
volunteering our time
essentially but we're asked to
use money that we work hard to
raise to support the activities
of state government so wrap your
head around that you know it it
is not just we don't get
reimbursed for a lot of the
stuff that we do and I just
wanted to put that out there for
people because I don't think
they realize it they have no
idea how much we're expected to
absorb in so that's one point
one make the other one is this
retirement.
You know but some of us are I
guess you could say lucky enough
to be at retirement age but I
would like to see a legislature
that goes beyond just having
retirement age people here and
that arm you know I I see my
younger friend proposing this
and I appreciate it and my other
younger friend who spends a lot
of time volunteering her time
balancing the need for a full
time job both of you have full
time jobs and I can not a manage
and how difficult it is really
because I have a lot of time on
my hands you know i'm retired
but I know how hard I work and I
know how much time it takes and
I know how frankly sometimes
it's really stressful so I want
to think both of you for doing
that for us but we need more of
you and it's going to be hard to
get more of you without some
compensation
the other thing i've and i'm
just gonna
bring up this point about
retirement again.
I hear there's a a per
opposition to enrich our
retirement program over in the
standard I don't know the
details of it and I i've just
been hearing rumblings and I
guess if I wanted to I could go
figure out if there's actually a
bill so bell filed and what it
is so I want everybody to hake
no who votes for that bill who
votes for that bill but votes
against this bill.
Very grandy else notion that
we're all public servants and
it's an honor for us to serve so
keep an eye out because i'm
going to be really interested in
seeing who says the younger
folks in this house are entitled
to be able to balance the needs
of an income and serving the
public and those who are looking
to retire and enhance the
retirement before they and their
service cause I would be
extremely offended if there
seems to be a disconnect there
so let's let's watch
i'm happy to entertain emotion
at this point.
We have a motion for a due pass
on house joint resolution seven
made by representative chase
second hand by representative
for marrow.
Would you call the role please.
Representative alcohol.
Representative chasey
representative hemre no
representative lane known i'd
like to explain my vote.
Representative of martinez yes
representative mcqueen yes
representative reap no
representative of dream no man
i'd like to explain my vote
representative sapansky yes
madam vice chair
yes madam chair
yeah yes and I know we have a
pass over here representative.
Yeah okay we have a lot of
explaining to
represent
lane I think you were the first
one who wanted to explain as
vote thank you so my reason for
no has nothing to do with
whether we can impate or not
because I I think as long as the
letters we should take hard
votes I think we should stand up
and answer in the press and
farming this out to some
unelected committee I don't
agree with and I also don't
agree that if you vote now in
this bill and yes on what our
bills come in the senate that
there's a disconnect there.
Man of chair right as I said
earlier I think the compensation
that we receive in retirement is
our pay yes it comes after you
retire but I believe that that
is adequate and I think this is
a public service and I think
that that's exactly what it is
thank you matter thank you and I
think the last explainer is
representative.
This was real shortly matter
madame chair I just have to give
the younger people a chance to
see if they can make it on
whatever salary they are going
to get because I got my
retirement till you wouldn't
there to give me a ten thousand
dollars salary it would make it
in difference but I just wonder
what it would happen to decide
folks who have to come to santa
fe leave their job as if they
really have to work at and get a
hundred and eighty one dollars a
day before hotel room food you
know repeating a lot of our I
know that so
you know and but that's what I
wanted to know is that are they
willing to do this and would
just bring to a salary thanks
for that again so we have a due
pass on this bill
with on a seven to four vote
thank you
all right last bill on our
agenda as house bill one oh two
and i'll be presenting in my
voice chair will be.
The.
Okay
all right here do you want to go
ahead and start yes
yes I
so
I was going to say good be
honest I would table but i'm not
sure
this bill
amends some provisions in
our statutes that relate to
mangel street courts and the two
significant changes are madam
chair and committee are
magistrate courts now are not
courts of record and what that
means is there is no recording
there's no transcript people
come in present their often pro
saver sometimes they're
represented and their case is
presented to the judge and the
decision is made
and the system as currently set
up is then
either party I guess the losing
party can then go to the
district court and get what we
call a denoval review or appeal
but it's really a new trial so
you get one bite at the apple at
the magistrate you get the
second bite at the apple if you
so choose at the district court
and then you can appeal that to
depending on the nature of the
appeal to either the court of
appeals and then supreme court
or if it's a certain kind of
issue just to the supreme court
so we have a lot of steps in the
process this bill would change
that it would create a court of
record.
In the magistrates and the
appeal would go to the court of
appeals based on the record and
i'll turn it over to my expert
car old who's going to say is
less name for me and if he has
anything to add are correct.
Thank you madame chair medium
chair and members of the
committee i'm carl right second
the deputy director of the
administrative office of the
courts.
And out.
We view this as to sort of a
good government bill for a
magistrate courts currently as
the chair explained
magistrate quarter knock where
it's a record and you get this
denobilities due over appeal if
you file an appeal magistrate
course just as a quick reminder
handle our traffic cases they
handle misdemeanors and petty
mister meaners in criminal cases
in civil cases with less than
ten thousand dollars in dispute
they cannot adjudicate real
estate
and any amount they do however
already do recorded hearings in
felony cases they do preliminary
hearings to determine probably
because in fellow
and they record those hearings
and the strange state of our
current law is that if you were
found guilty of a misdemeanor
and magistrate court saved for a
dwi for domestic violence that
means a prosecutor a district
attorney usually has tried the
case a defense attorney usually
public defender has defended you
the law enforcement officer has
come to testify the victim has
come to testify and you had the
right to adjury in a misdemeanor
and they found you guilty and
you can fire one piece of paper
over the district court and get
a brand new trial we wipe out
everything the magistrate court
did and start over and then if
you still don't like that then
you get to appeal the court of
appeals and so this bill would
change that to say that
magistrate court trial would now
be recorded and if you file the
appeal it would go the court of
appeals and you'd need to point
out some kind of legal error
rather than just.
We don't allow any other class
of defendant to get a brand new
trial if you're found guilty of
murder for instance you don't
get to file one piece of paper
and get a new trial and so we
think it's time to extend that
that also to imagine straight
courts
thank you I do want to know we
have a small amendment that's
been handed out to you and that
two o two number is two point
two two seven nine zero six
point one and I should add to my
comments that
excluded from this court of
record issue is those cases are
rising on the uniform owner
resident relations act which is
really landlord tenant law and
we are adding now at requests of
individuals who are active in
this area the uniform owner
resident oh no excuse me the
mobile home park act as well
the rationale being that there
are a lot of pro say activities
under those um acts they're very
significant some time in terms
of the impact on the individuals
because they might be getting
affected and and that sort of
thing so we wanted to give them
the additional opportunity to
get a the novel trial in
district court then I get that
right
that's correct man during the
statutory time lines under our
landlord tenant law you know
from owner resident relations
act like seven days they're very
short so we felt that keeping
that the novo to district court
is.
Before we go to your amendment
let's go to the audience anyone
in favor of this bill.
Anyone against
anyone online in favor.
The.
The.
Go ahead well.
I have to matter
my useful bond garden between
with this and online poverty we
work every day with folks who
were providing legal services to
people
who believe that everyone should
have access to the courts and
the presentative case
whether they have an attorney or
not in new mexico many of our
most important cases are dealt
with at the magistrate level
measure court it's desired to be
the people's court we're crazy
but against an appear
independence without a lot of
technical different called view
of necessary.
Um.
Support appeals has a vary
specific review standard for
cases and legal issues contained
at a record we definitely
concerned about making apology
for use
become more complicated for for
protocol and against
four very painful to the sponsor
for amending this and having in
the car outs for the form on a
rest rations act
act
we think that in so martin that
that those cases get reviewed
now about the disreport level
and for that reason we're not
opposed to this but today.
The.
Jason.
Thank you madame chair and
members of the committee my name
is jason clark with the
administration of office of the
courts I have been prilligent
honor being the legal advisor
for the magistrate judges and I
can tell you they weren't just
as hard as other judges however
under our current system of
denoble appeals all that hard
work can be wiped away as if
none of it ever happened and one
of the party simply disagrees
with the decision of the judge
to know who appeals are
available as a matter of right
because there is no record and
they do not require a claim of
error or abuse of discretion
therefore when magistrates do
make mistakes as we all do the
denoval process
deprives them of the opportunity
to learn from their mistakes and
approve their application of the
law because again it is if none
of what they did ever happen so
for those reasons to support the
professionalism of magistrate
judges I ask that you support
house bill one or two and give
it a two pass thank you.
Sorry anyone else in support
john go ahead.
The.
Good morning thank you my name
is chairman members that's many
john chavis i'm the magistrate
judge in valencia county I was a
point did a ten years ago on the
sixth of february some approach
in my ten year anniversary when
I was appointed my mentor judge
touched but he all told me that
you need to follow all proper
procedures as a magistrate judge
for two reasons one was that was
one of these days will be on the
record
too and more importantly that
the people before the court
deserve nothing less than the
follow proper procedures I can
tell you that in my ten years
working with judicial education
with advise the same to all new
judges and every judge i've ever
mentioned I tell the same to as
well
yesterday I had a joy trial and
that jury trial was on my mind
sorry this bill is mind in that
dray trial in the fact that we
had eighteen citizens from the
inter county that were present
and their time.
I was given to this trial at the
end of the the trial
the jury deliberated and found
the defended guilty of all
charges their time.
If there was the denoval of hill
their time would be
I will thank you matter members
the committee their time would
be notified as well and so I
think it's important not just to
respect the work of the parties
before the court but also the
jurors and other citizens are in
any others in favor online
alright an opposition online.
The.
Did you want to respond anything
madam chair no i'm happy to
we're happy to entertain
questions
let's go ahead and deal with the
amendment first.
Does anyone want to move that.
Move by our representative
sir second second representative
hungry
on discussion did you have
madam chair wouldn't we just
move it for a adoption and
skipped a discussion okay
I want to discuss it though
okay does anyone oppose
adopting the amendment.
Great all right back to the bill
did you have any other
additional comments no matter
here anyone wanna
house okay i'll phone i'm sorry
I have a list adding to it we'll
start with representative.
Yeah they can have chairman
thank you madame chair and I
want to welcome my class car
restaurant to our committee and
I
really hadn't part of it this
won't affect metro court right
because metro is a court of
record already so it's just the
magistrate courts and men chair
and representative to you think
that
at this point in time abandoned
straight judge does not need to
be an attorney is that cracked
madam chair the bill does not
suggest that the
i'm just wondering okay
madam chair representative chase
that's correct okay except for
indonesia county they are
required okay thank you I just
wonder what the current status
was in and that happening
effective
there take on it and that i'm
cherry I just want to save with
the amendment we adopted
senator below nearly used to be
in the house were quite a while
and he was always trying to
improve this
the mobile home park laws for
his constituents and if we were
never able to get anything done
in that area and
i'll be interested to see what
his reaction is to the including
that but it seems to go along
with what they're changed that
you have already I mean
the level attendant
statutes as well so that's all
manager or a representative
i'm thinking of madam by
so I say I love this bill this
is something that i've been
wanting to see happen for two
reasons you know watching
these cases get tried convicted
and going up and at another
right at the app or and then of
course then the appeal and so
they're so time consuming.
Made a victor and madam chair
that this I think is it just a
great idea i've loved this the
other thing that I think no one
ever realizes that
it happens with prosecutors and
it does definitely happen with
defense attorneys too we often
see a lot of lack of
professionalism in magistrate
court because it is not a court
of record and we try to do
things that normally would not
do it if it was a quarter record
and there's just a lot of
arguing things slipping in
because these are judges often
aren't lawyers and comments made
in front of a jury and the like
and you'll hear on both sides
and since well i'm just going to
try it it's not a quarter record
you know see if I can get away
with it and so i'd love the fact
that it would now be recorded
and
then go up to to that next level
and I think it will it will put
up a definitely a better
professionalism aspect to
magistrate court for this
criminal cases so I just want to
see man by share manager of that
that's why I really like this
because I see this I see man
court and macor judges being
fairly taken advantage of a lot
of times in its it's not
professional and it's it's a
little abusive at times over
there so thank you for bringing
this legislation thank you thank
you represent.
The human tear
name chair manches have a couple
questions I i'm out of my depth
here
if i'm in court something is
going to horribly wrong so
I support your purpose
but I wonder why why are we
laying the appeals go to the
court of appeals instead of
having the disrecord sit as a
court
madam chair if I could defer to
carl and madam share
representative queen.
We talked about both approaches
certainly
we felt in the end that the
court of appeals is really best
physician that's what they do
every day as they review a
record
error and then they they make a
decision there's a really small
number actually of appeals from
magistrate court today and in
the last fiscal year after
twenty three magistrate courts
decided a hundred and thirteen
thousand six hundred forty one
cases and they were four
hundred.
Point four two percent of their
cases who were appealed.
Two hundred of those were when
there are ten cases of overhome
pack per cases so you'd get rid
of two hundred and those
those would remain with the
district court so we're talking
about it really really small
number today without having to
say that there is error that are
really going
Position to look at the record
in and.
Make a decision based on on the
record and review fair
and mimter
mancher and expert is this is
the pure as a break I mean does
the court appeals have to take
this appeal.
Madame chair representative yes.
Man chair man chair and extra
email as were this does concern
me.
The the turnaround time on our
public courts is troubling to me
this ads to their work load
III have concerned
thank.
Representative
thank you
chair totally a hundred percent
degree with the magistrate court
being a corder recorder
however mister steck no so have
a lot of hope run about going to
the court of a field.
Will not get you that hard burn.
Is because people that go before
the match the court used to go
process
and they I heard by magistrate
court which is the
other people the people's fault
decision is made over this and
then
the
person is great at the field
that you can decide if you're
about her issue that they are
county.
Order this street and I think in
our fairness I noticed I guess
told me that there's something
seven where that's as they have
to do this but I just get to
find it.
I just did think it and all
fairness a person that goes to
the people's coverage and
heavily read the right to go to
the court that is within the
deck and the words were they
live in not instead of fair
that my heart is okay thank you
matter
I would like
representative himbry.
Thank you madame chair madame
chair I also really like this
bill
you know I would I just
briefly.
Rear iterate a couple things I
think add it representative read
said that I think this will
greatly
enhance the professionalism at
the magistrate court I like
representative mcqueen if i'm in
the corporate something has gone
horribly wrong
when I was getting sworn in for
this I asked a friend of mine
judge hudson to swear me in he
said okay you know where court
room one is I said I bagly know
where the courthouse is
so
I would just say I think this
really I I understand
representative mcqueens concerns
about the
appellate courts knock it
but I think this really helps
with our district court docket
and and different levels have.
A lot of load and there is a
concern I think that's a very
valid concern about the court of
appeal stock
my main concern is is sort of
sinking the court rules between
like the magistrate court and.
And district courts or or if
it's going up to the court of
appeals you know they operate
under certain different rules
court rules and things and I
just however how does the aoc
plan to to address that.
Madame chair represent henry
there are slightly different
versions of the rules of
procedure both criminal
procedure and civil procedure
for district court and
magistrate court the rules of
dependent procedure are the
scene for both of the appellate
quotes.
Um.
The rules of evidence however
are exactly the same for
district and magistrate court so
there's there's really no
difference in terms of
presentation of evidence and
that sort of thing
and they're small procedural
differences in terms of.
When you have the fire which
document is a shorter appellate
time right now from.
In a fifteen day appeal time
from magistrate to district
versus thirty days from district
court of appeals.
Said i'm not sure representative
if there's a specific provision
you want me to speak to but
there are.
Small differences but overall
they're they generally track.
Thank you madame chair madame
chair
and and yeah exactly like the
fifteen day versus thirty day I
mean is is now up coming out of
magistrate court going to court
of appeals that's going to be a
thirty day a pellet process do
you see that as a potential rule
change
mermed her representative that
is not addressed by them bill it
would be a potential rule change
yet.
All right thank you very much
madame chair that's all I think
you add and chair for bringing
the bill I just have a couple
comments first of being a baby
lawyer was shocked that I that
this wasn't a court of record to
begin with
that said when we are looking at
how everything sort of goes
through the process
and certainly how we're still
working to fully fund our courts
and the process I see that
there's an appropriation here
for like only three hundred
thousand dollars
given what we're have talking
about with the layers of um I
think complexity and oversight
are a couple questions one is
that appropriation in the
budget.
Madam chair we would expect
house probations to take the
appropriation out of this bill
because we have other areas we'd
address it in
that appropriation we had in
mind updating the current
recording equipment that's in
magistrate court that's
something we need to do anyway
because they they have those
preliminary hearings recorded
already
so that'll be addressed again
next year with the the funding
companies um and thank you for
that and end I would just add
that I know that the court of
appeals was asking us for
funding for different things
already for modernizing their
set up so I think the increase
in capacity that's needed i'm in
order for everything to flow we
just need to be followed through
in in the next session and the
session following that so I know
this is that the only thing
that's needed to be done I just
wanted to you know
comment that that was part of
part of the plan
is what does anyone wish to do
