Thank you so much Mr chairman I
move that we reconsider the
actions that we took on Senate
Judiciary Committee substitute
for Senate bill one.
I just want because we amended
it thank you I move that we
reconsider the action we took on
Senate bill one is amended.
Thank you there are certain
seconded by Senator Lopez.
Okay.
A post.
Okay.
So the motion passes.
Very good.
So senator Sanchez this so Mr
chairman I move that the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
a pass Senate Committee Senate
Judiciary Committee associate
percent of bill one.
Give us the number.
The number is two two one seven
one one point one.
But.
And that Mr chairman of before
the
the sponsor presents.
Just let the public know that we
normally don't don't post a
committee set up online until
after it's been.
Read out of committee however we
were able to get given the
nature of of the maps and
people's interest to one to make
public comment.
if you go to the Senate bill one
landing page on the legislative
website.
We do have
**** proposed stop maps and
data.
Posted on there right now.
So any member of the public can
go to NM logistic of.
Search for Senate bill one.
I would be up to Senate bill
one.
You'll see a link there to
Congress **** proposed to set
up.
Maps and data.
And and that will bring that up
so that members of the public
are able to look at the map as
we go forward as well.
And and the information thank
thank you Senator Samantha's
thank you Mr chairman why would
be and what we're gonna do okay
Mister Mister we had a pretty
thorough hearing a.
Last on Senate bill one.
After that point in time we I
heard some of the concerns that
were expressed and of the
committee and took some of them
to hard even after passing the
bill some of the comments
focused very much on the effort
that went into the C. R. C.
process and we take those to
heart as well to went back and
looked at some of the maps and
try to move in a direction
closer to C. R. C. the concept
age and begin to work more
closely offer that map in doing
so we were able to once again
maintain a very tight deviation
I think we're within our I guess
possibly those more weightless
numbers in terms of deviation
but they're they're less than
ten among the various districts
we were able to re unite some of
the communities that were
impacted by the earlier mapping
to trying to get trying United
some of those and and move those
committees back so we're gonna
have this posterior it would be
best if the chair will allow me
to further her to explain in
broad strokes what we've done
with the proposed Committee
subsidy for the committee but
but but fundamentally the issue
here is to get closer even to
see Garcia
map page.
Thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
so as as the Sanchez said the
deviations are very small so the
largest smallest deviation is
nine people and the largest
largest aviation as five people
on this plan.
I'm gonna put up of the
boundaries of SB one in red I
know it's a little difficult to
see but I'll talk us through it
so again that serves our.
As for the yes yes we did the
lights thank you Senator.
Why since.
Thank you Mr chair of the of the
Senate bill one boundaries are
in red and the rest of the map
is the substitute so just really
quickly us starting here in Rio
Rancho one of the differences is
that northern Rio Rancho goes
into district three previously
all of Rio Rancho within
district one district one
retains the southern part of Rio
Rancho.
The boundary along the west side
of Albuquerque is the same as in
Senate bill one as well as the
boundary in Valencia County
On the one of the biggest change
it well Santa Fe County that is
as you recall and was sort of
split up between of
congressional district one and
three most of us in Fe County
has been returned to
congressional district three
under this plan except for some
of these east mountain precincts
and that allows us to keep
Edgewood hole under this plan
so the biggest changes are I
think are on the east side of
the state where the counties of
Waterloo bay and to Baca are
back in the congressional
district one not back in their
in congressional district one
they were not in the regression
district three under SB one also
the northern half of Travis
county the southern half of have
it is in the congressional
district one the southern half
of Travis county is in
congressional district three and
so that does affect Roswell so
the the vast majority of Roswell
is in congressional district
three with a little bit of
Roswell and congressional
district one.
Thirty three between
congressional district three and
congressional district to just
south of Artesia in Eddy county
is the same as in Senate bill
one you can see that there
and as the top split is the same
as and SB one the state
boundaries there.
And so Mr chair those are those
are the differences between
between the plants.
Thank you.
The contest anything you wanna
add mushrooms stand for
questions okay so can we put the
lights back up as we go to the
audience here is there anyone
who would like to speak
about their current.
The substitute for SP one.
I'm not seeing any hands and
I've just really appreciate
everybody's patience you know if
this is redistricting is very
fluid there's just a lot of
folks will with employed in
we've and we listen to it or
very carefully so can we go now
to public comment via the the
You know those of the zoom.
The internet's.
Yes.
Then again I'm you know we're
we're pressed for time as always
we're gonna listen to everybody
and my apologies for yesterday
to everybody listening my fault
and I'm just on the dark side of
the digital divide and sometimes
it asserts itself so and Mr
chairman the if I could just say
for those people who are logging
in online to speak I know a lot
of people had strong feelings
about Senate bill one.
As it was passed out of this
committee a couple days ago.
it would be helpful if people
would take a moment to go online
this is why we put the but the
data online so people could take
a look at it so that your
comments are on the committee
substitute.
The proposed committee says to
to set up a one yes and so there
was a bill listening right now
just now we have changed the map
from yesterday to today so if
you can and I know I really
apologize for how fast this
moves but this is the
legislative process and it's
important that we get it right
so just keep in mind of the map
has changed since yesterday so
with that let's start off with
that Adelante progressive caucus
the the person who spoke
yesterday remember her name the
one that's going to endorse mark
Mark Moores the next election.
Just so you're up and you did
really good job yesterday one
minute is what we're doing here
okay just please keep it to one
minute there many people on this
list of money to get everybody
the chance to talk.
Okay so is the analysts say
Cheryl Harris that Cheryl Harris

From yesterday.
We're gonna move very thoroughly
quickly through this map I mean
through this list so Barbara
Calef.
Okay yeah.

Okay.
Hello how do you available to
speak let's uh I guess not

the map policy.

bad news I'm.
Representative Mexico and some
other state but that the same
critiques the The New Mexico
about Senator what's that plan
to this position at
Association would have preferred
that that that that's sort of
some maps would have been
considered as the social group
Rep Matt dean.
We are of the twelve well as the
relatively good economic changes
to map a map which
this is much closer to just be
one of the sort of some apps
that have been I'm sure.
The congressional district.

Here today in English hi.
Those and member of the Central
Committee axion.
Bureau of people's map.
There is a lot of hundreds of
community members including self
engaging in people's at the
people's process ensuring
stories with the C. R. C..
The people.
Hello.

Okay hi my name is rose and that
I know and because we don't have
interpretation today will be
reading I members testimony.
Okay.
Those sentiments of incentive
for that the axiom.
The number of people snap the
proposal was a result of
hundreds of community members
Buying including myself engaging
in the people's process and
their stories with the CRC.
One of the people's map.
I want to continue to be part of
the people's process honoring
the principles of this map.
I live in a family of
Albuquerque for years now and it
is very different from other
areas of Albuquerque we do.
Not have all the same resources
as other areas.
Family worked we could set that
up for almost a year to ensuring
the Hispanic community.
The what
excluded from the twenty twenty
census.
You're able to call and be in
touch with thousands and
hundreds of people to make sure
that the participate in the
census and with especially in
minority communities.
Communities are here to ensure
that our congressional maps
Representative our communities
the winds are mapped that
half Hispanic majority.
Eight so we can check someone
that comes from our communities
this is why we support the
people snap.
Okay thank you rose rose

To from your group.
Thank you
my sister is that is that what
we have from there okay and we
have no other hands up.
Okay and again I our apologies
this just moves fast this is not
just keeping gauge with us and
and and don't lose faith in that
and also or this process I know
it's hard so having said that
let's go to the committee.
So how do we have any any words
from any of our committee
members on yes Senator do it.
You Mr chairman.
Thank you Senator around us for
I know all the.
The work that you all have put
into this and I understand why
we're we're doing this up hi I
just want to acknowledge one
part of the the district I
represent highs Rio Rancho under
SB one as we had before Rio
Rancho was was mostly held and
on the same district.
As we're going closer back to
the CRC of concept H. I. Rio
Rancho gets split in this
contest I know that it was their
preference to be all in one
districts so I just wanted to
acknowledge that for them
I understand the the different
competing interest at work here
but I appreciate that the work
you put into this and I'm sure
that Rio Rancho will be
absolutely Representative bye
bye both representatives under
this approach thank you.
Senator.
Any other anybody else.
Senator Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman and I I
just wanna also think because
Senator von yes for
posturing and listening to
the feedback from yesterday
a lot of people don't understand
redistricting it's it's not a
real fun process but at least
every ten years we get to kind
of right size what's happening
in the state so I appreciate
that we we've listened to those
folks that wanted a few changes
and that we've done that so
that's what Mr chairman thank
you thank you thank you senator.
Okay all right Senator Ivey Soto
thank you very much Mr chairman
Mr chairman

time then I would move a.
I do not pass.

one seven one one point one as a
committee substitute thank you
seconded by Senator Lopez and Mr
chairman I do also
in addition to the Senator
Memphis and the and the many
other people.
who who worked on.
trying to corporate the feedback
that have been coming in on
these maps in order to be able
to bring these changes I also
really want to appreciate very
much the staff of of both
research and polling as well as
the Legislative Council Service
for being able to get this done
and and a fairly tight period of
time
they were alerted that it was
going to be coming but but still
there's a lot of technical work
that has to be done and and so
we would normally these are a
new statewide map would take
about a day to get done they got
it done in a in a period of
hours of once once
other people it worked on on
whether changes would be and so
hi I just I just want to give a
real shot out of the folks who
are we're doing the technical
side of making this happen thank
you thank you senator so yes hi
Senator Baca thank you Mr.

the floor leader.

for everyone schedule the
tentative agenda you can expect

also tell the committee that of
