My name is facing five of the
ministry of office of the courts
to keep things brief I will be
happy to stand for questions.
Or appropriations.
Seventy four chairman.
It appears is creating a fund
for unforeseen circumstances I
moved to pass.
Have.
The action shows.
News.
We're in support.
Thank you senator thank you
members of the committee.
You over one sixty eight.
Of we lost an important.
Right right.
The.
The action.
But for the rest.
The.
Mr chairman thank you
So I do have an amendment to
make on this bill that's on page
three.
and.
Of so when they initially that
it.
Nurses that a nursing home we're
going to be employed and nurses
at a hospice's who's gonna be
contracted but the desire is
that they both be employed.
And so and so the I think the.
Latest way is simply the strike
on page three line sixteen.
A registered nurse contracted
by.
So that way would read a
registered nurse employed by a
nursing home or hospice agency.
And then we would also strike
the Senate help the Public
affairs equipment.
Mr chair I am here today on
behalf of the New Mexico health
Association the New Mexico.
Living in the New Mexico
Association for Home and hospice
care and Charlie Marcus I would
like to comment on the
amendment.
Receipt of services started to
look at it sharks in absolute
eleven page three line sixteen
striking
four eight registered nurse
contracted by.
That's the environment and then
striking the Senate Public
Affairs amendment and and and
that will result in a in a
sense it's as a registered nurse
employed by a nursing home or
hospice agency may pronounce the
death of residence.
Of a nursing home.
And.
Questions.
Senator question for me is a
hospice a fine and.
It is Mr chair and in the deaths
from now Smith statute yes
allows hospice nurses to return
to pronounce death in a person's
home.
And it allows a nursing home.
Staff nurse to pronounce that
but it is not clearly stated
that the hospice nurse can
pronounce death for a hospice
patient in a nursing home.
The sentence and grow saying
that the two thousand eight
standpoint hospice agencies as
hospice hospice agencies and
provide a hospice agency when it
Madam this represents raises
this is always a agency of.
Branch of government.
And the hospice organization I'm
familiar with everyone presents
a lot of.
Hospice agencies are
constrained.
Term but.
Sierra.
Mark.
The budget lawyers.
Hospice agency doesn't services.
Senator with the research.
That
was actually saying this could
pronounce that and so it is and
what about house is very
important.
You know the yes of.
We got an answer yeah.
I I don't see a specific
definition for hospice agencies
the term hospice hospice H..
Relapses section of.
But if it is not defined.
I stand a lot of.
All the threads of the whole of
the bill.
Choose who can pronounce in the
state of somebody was employed
by this agency we don't hospice
agency is yes he says there also
is a is there going to be a
hospice agency.
If all right on the amendment is
there any further discussion
amendment.
The objections to Senator of
that amount.
Halfway.
So.
Mr Chairman.
I like what Senator Ivy Soto is
done but I'm I'm not sure that
they do.
So I think we need to hear from
Senator has fun expect because
news also and doing the
amendments and public affairs.
So.
So Mr chair Senator thank you
for the question I'm going to
defer to Mister Charlie market
since it's their bill that I'm
here.
Mr chairman and members of the
committee.
The the reason we did this is
that currently as as Senator
Stefanics indicated.
The office of the medical
investigator basically has given
the authority to.
Hospice nurses to declare in
other environments.
When they are contracted in the
nursing home.
They're only taking up that
space the contract is with the
family and the agency comes in
and.
Provide hospice care for their
last week or two of life.
They basically are the.
Patient of hospice and not the
nursing home so the nursing home
has no authority to declare war
do anything further with that
patient.
It's only under the care of
hospice that allows them and in
this case given them permissive
authority to.
The clear that that this.
Otherwise it requires the office
of the medical investigator to
deputize them in that
environment so that they can on
their behalf declare that that
Mr Chairman I understand all of
that I'm asking about the
specific amendment because his
amendment also takes away all of
the health and public affairs
committee amendments and then.
So is it friendly or not all.
Mr chairman of members of the
committee we see this as
unfriendly because it doesn't
get a specific so we're looking
for.
What.
It doesn't do what I think is
the intent which is well first
off and does what we do just
that.
And and I don't think it
accomplishes what we're looking
to accomplish.
For the.
Well Miss Mister chairman and I
I say we don't amend this we let
it go forward with the
amendments they put in the other
committee yeah I you know
linguistically I like what
Senator Ivy Soto is done that's
not what they want and so and
knows if it's if it's contracted
versus employees and they get
the fit and they already fit.
And they picked what happened in
the previous committee.
Our
Sir do the movie centers of
us that we can't complete and do
all the fact moments between the
the
The title it'll go back to
contracted rather than I.
In the movie yes what I actually
was going to I was going to come
and that that it's will would be
doing striking Senate hopeful
Committee amendment number two.
Senator was right about that of
the
But again the the problem is
right so they they went from you
need to the complex structure
the sentence when one was
employed almost contracted if
they're both employed you don't
need the complex structure the
sentence and the problem is it's
already a run on sentence so the
problem is there by leaving it
the way it is it is going to
give rise to confusion.
Because the entire sentences a
registered nurse employed by a
nursing home or registered nurse
contracted by hospice agency
maintains employed outside of
thank you for registered nurses
employed.
So the both of Lloyd Wright
hospices the my process that's a
resident of the nursing home and
researchers employed by hospital
to pronounce that a patient of
the hospital.
Simply taking out those words.
Removes the opportunity for
people to read and up in the
woods.
So.
Well you want to reset the
moment that then takes account
viewed originally suggested that
plus right and all the fact the
only striking number two.
Start it up and running need to
straighten you're just taking
out that like much.
So you're already taking it out
and language that you're taking
out okay the finish that the
fact.
I think that's where the
movie is to not take this back.
But the.
That's I mean if that that
that's that's fine I just want
to make sure that we're let's
let's let's council picked up
but but really I mean on the
function basis is simply to
strike a registered nurse
employed by because we already
say that on the same line.
So it be a restaurant just
employed by a nursing home or
hospice agency.
Which is what they want.
And now I got a thumbs up right
that thank you to come to New
is in your.
On the proposed amendment
proposal is simply on page three
I.
Stride of the second the for the
line now.
Not I can't believe I.
Second I through the end of the
line.
For.
Our state yes.
And you don't.
The.
I.
Judge of the document.
Those left facility here.
Bill Murray more of a committee.
Of the.
Part of the.
It has.
For the discussion will there's
a motion by Senator for the past
has amended there's no
objections seen all members are
present in all support the bill
as amended thank you very much
Mr chair members of the
committee is
sentiments about thank you.
You'll go to so I know what was
referred to the rules.
Well
Work.
Stay with us.
Space for the military
definitions.
Chaves all heard it has all been
heard and there's amendment for
consider the fact of date so
this yes Representative.
What was heard in some of these.
For.
We would like to.
Well appreciate you all.
Very good.
To see
all sides of governor.
Appreciated all of the.
And Mr was the reason for the
amendment is because an
interstate compacts has not yet
met approve this but the.
What we're told is going to be
meeting in the next couple of
that was a bill a couple of
extra.
All right so what was enrollment
This question for me and for
the.
countrywide really that last
clause.
Mr chairman the that is how the
Legislative Council Service
determination.
A request that it should be
praised plus the other thing is
there was to put in the
contingent factor date that it
has to be certified to the
Director Legislative Council
Service and to the New Mexico
compilation commission.
We see that this is only the for
the for the best like the
triggering language.
This item is going.
Well first of.
All the amendment discussion on
the to go over the bill just
because someone is or special.
So.
Is there any objection option.
Seeing the actual numbers
between eight.
The bill.
Mr Chairman
you know obviously I think we
should do have a point out of
that space force is under the
therefore still and technically
seven on something called space
corps.
But
that would appeal to the.
The cool Star Trek designed you
know that the trump
administration.
The objection to the U. pass
motion.
Questions will serve.
Thank you Mr chair time
so this.
This is part of operation of the
space
to force the right.
Ported over from.
The.
This was
hard.
One of the both doing support.
Efforts to make America safe.
Questions.
Get.
Mr chair Senator what I'm doing
is to stop making sure that
members who joined the space our
get the budget when I come back
to our state you know the take
care of them.
I was part of the Air Force base
our before making space for.
There are president trump.
On a.
On another this call.
And for you know why we have a.
The agency that starts.
Agencies.
Right.
This gentleman that for that
purpose of others with our I
think we're you know.
I've noticed.
Moores as a question our records
were first.
One we used right.
Representative.
When.
Senator why the one we have a
full disclosure do not pass the
infants are falsely falsely
report with.
But we.
Schools.
Page three page four.
Mr chair Senator from my
understanding that's part of the
contact language.
From would be from the member
for false.
That's we.
Mr way under notes just this of
course has a question restricted
to centre COVID.
Let others share of what was to
happen your services service.
Bonus points to anyone with
these well I you know I want to
District that to seeing it and
we almost is we we try to strike
the whole section which would
have taken out thirty six pages
of the bill but instead Senator
Ivey Soto has put in at the end
of this paragraph that says even
though we don't have a space
force here.
actually Center pope tried to
take that out so instead of
taking up space for force in
this section.
We left the section in and then
put this amendment saying once
they look up to that then this
is okay because otherwise we
would have taken out that full
section but this is this is
weird compact things does not
look like anything that comes
out of Legislative Council.
Seventy percent of them are free
is here.
This is the.
One of the.
I'm gonna go to center so to on
almost this bill just a laugh
five of the businesses like the
brand we we require some
additional work so.
This call back to.
I'm really trying to make a lot
of progress about six thirty
stop time.
With bills we can I'm.
Live it's going to be right the
house is going to
was good solutions this bill is
a researcher don't miss seven I
would just point out that this
is a compact that we previously
adopted in the state of thousand
ten and.
And it's only in front of us for
the for the sole purpose of
adding space force and given the
that's not a new compact when
considering I personally think
we should just let it go on a
point of four year two thousand
census.
Our
numbers are two thousand eight
we're sorry for the I also
out by their with all right.
Senator.
Hello and and it's very moment
when you're all here responding
to the wonder whether that's
ever a good idea.
Claimed earlier Mr chair I did
if I get a.
I'm not sure where we stand
Representative out.
A member of the office yes but
then the question on some of
the.
I'm not sure who's out right now
but I'm not apply to start
training with
us there's a
which passed the bill is present
for.
Of as the rules.
So others survive
I would support the the chairs
opinion on that looking at the
back with some of the
the definitions on page fifty
four fifty five reserves.
How there's just a ton to strike
there there's all sorts of
definitions within the code that
are just repetitive here that
are really not needed so this I
I would tend to agree just
flipping through it there's four
five items that can see that are
extraneous but that's only if
they keep that's going to be the
care center were so my only
concern is that we start
amending a compact and you're on
doing existing law for all these
military members and so I just I
don't know what I mean I'm not
going to support for the compact
and it will go rewrite I think
we've been down this road.
After the floor of the
contractor and then we've got to
come back we got a deal with
some.
Some situations I just throw
that out there I know I know no
one likes these contacts that's
why we tried to a topic to this
committee so we've already got
this one.
Thank you so result all heroes
the committee of the of the the
closure of the committees to run
the bill in its present form has
is but I'm not seeing that
anywhere so.
If we want to make an argument
to do that we'll take that as a
vote quickly.
Passes so too much to table a
motion tabled the motion motion
table it has to be taken as
reference order of.
Motion tables take roll call the
table.
Senator Baca yes.
There are several moment Senator
Wirth yes.
Senator when you yes.
Senator Pirtle yes.
Senator Stewart yes.
Senator Wirth no Senator not.
There are some of this no the
bill is tabled motions from the
bills W. more stable so I miss
open.
Senator.
center then you'll see basing
them.
Senator Pirtle it's two years of
two twenty two please
Mr chair I made my experts to
get on with your roll over.
Yes I apologize for that no
reason to apologize survey gets
to go home ten minutes earlier
tonight K. five twenty four.
For the.
Let's see here Senator Sedillo
Lopez sixty nine that they've
got to believe that some really
easy isn't it.
Yes we have a committee
substitute yes
nope never.
Thank you.
Senator I don't I don't think
we're going to your bill
over not Willis this is the real
quick.
Where we seem.
Where we seem committees of
center because back they raise
the issue of what about E. bikes
that go higher than twenty eight
miles per hour so it's kind of a
gap in the bills so of because
of the the recommendations of
the spec Committee we it is a
committee such debates really
got when when changed that
creates a lexical bility device
so that it that creates of that
allows of the motor vehicle
department to treat E. bikes to
go that fast differently from
the bikes only only a bicycle
lesson twenty eight miles an
hour.
We're only dealing.
Okay yeah basically that's it.
Do that and I I will be here
with my expertise to Mr Chairman
there are electrify circles that
go over twenty eight miles an
hour with just the throttle and
they need to be classified as
motorized vehicle so this
substitute contains a new
definition.
That puts those types of devices
so they required to be licensed.
So we're gonna have an electric
assisted bicycles and electric
mobility device yes thank.
New Mexico.
I'd like to turn over to my
experts.
Mr Chairman most states.
Have a state law that recognizes
class one class two and class
three electric bicycles we do
not so the reason this bill is
in front of you is that the
current law classifies every
time I.
Of electric bicycle as a bicycle
including those bicycles that
have puddles and motors and
throttles that go over thirty
miles an hour they're currently
legal on bicycle paths in the
should be.
Thank you.
The wrong.
This is because.
This we're getting the wrong
stuff that's correct so she left
out from the pages is not
correct so yeah I'm sorry for
that is pushover for let's state
but all the.
I have to.
from.
Right we should have.
The only ones.
But we have with the reserve.
Yeah well for sure over the bill
I only have one members.
We are number one.
Let's go home.
Senator Sedillo was we got the
pressure for a little bit the
the we had some bad copy work
so.
We don't have all the pages and
we're not gonna pass we just
have a basis of.
All right Williams was senator
Munoz let's do this to this real
quick of.
So we use for our.
Okay.
Through four.
You have to do a good job.
Senator.
Really.
To.
Two of.
Good evening I guess.
Senate Bill to of course bill
that clarifies employee leasing
companies otherwise known as P.
O.'s or license in the state in
New Mexico and the sponsored
offer full Arjun started large
insured large groups to welfare
benefits at work sites we need
to bring clarity to New Mexico
with a vast majorities other
states are set P. O.'s can
sponsored benefit plans like in
health care insurance
retirement plans to New Mexico
with that I'll introduce my
expert witness set of products.
And.
Garcia yes thank you very much
Mr chair and members of the
committee the opportunity to
speak in support of SB two oh
four my name is set prepped I'm
outside counsel to the national
association of professional
employer organizations think
that easier said as Navio and
I'm very happy here to to to
speak before you all in support
of two four.
just a little bit of a PO is our
members that professional
employer organizations are PO's
provide meaningful HR solutions
to small and mid sized
businesses in New Mexico and
across the country they do that
by entering it into Mexico
employment relationships with
those small and mid size
businesses that they work with
and the assume certain employer
obligations on their behalf
payroll benefits tax HR
regulatory compliance all things
that he is due for small
businesses and mid size
businesses here in New Mexico
they're subject to license and
regulation by the N. and R. O.
L. D. under the New Mexico
employee leasing Act
comprehensive regulatory
authority through that
Department.
Basically existing law provides
a PS are able to provide any
benefits required by law to
their worksite employees easily
employees of the of the New
Mexico companies that they
contract with the New Mexico
legislature is clearly and
explicitly recognized PO's as
employers for purposes including
of offering health benefits.
As an employer and in accordance
with longstanding practice when
a PO offers health coverage to
residents of New Mexico they do
through if they do so through
fully insured large group health
insurance products and these are
regulated by the New Mexico
office of superintendent of
insurance and also are fully
compliant with us state
insurance laws and those at the
federal level such as the
affordable Care Act.
importantly when peels offer
coverage they're not selling
insurance they're they're taking
on the role as co employer of
those worksite employees and
they're offering coverage to
those with employees just like
any other employer would do with
respect to their employees and
the purpose of this bill is to
codify into New Mexico law what
has been going on for decades in
New Mexico which is that PO's
can lawfully provide fully
insured large group health plans
to the small businesses that
they partner with here in New
Mexico and with the individuals
who work for those small
businesses and this is
consistent with how such plans
currently operates.
including using contractors are
currently required to license
and a regulated by the New
Mexico department of regulation
and licensing.
When this bill was originally
drafted.
It was intended to amend the
employee leasing Act PO's in New
Mexico are called employee
leasing companies it was
intended to amend the employee
leasing act clarify that a fully
insured health plan that was
offered by an employee leasing
contractor and it was made
available to employees and
contractors client would be okay
The office of superintendent of
insurance that Hey we're we're
okay with this but we want to
have a story over that we don't
want Department regulation
licensed licensing it to deal
with that provision so basically
we worked very very closely with
OSI
that to put together language
that would address this under
the insurance code and that's
what you have in front of you so
that is what is SB two four and
we appreciate your consideration
turning now to Emily.
How.
Hi my name is Emily more
directors and managers thank you
and I just wanted thank you for
the opportunity to comment for
this bill and then I appreciate
the opportunity to work with at
west side on this bill so I just
wanted to make that make that
statement thank you very much do
we have anyone register on this
bill either in support or
opposition members the committee
senator.
Thank you Mr chair so I'm
looking at page two lines twenty
two and twenty three really the
health of the committee.
It just says with respective
group health plans to spend the
section falloff of these group
health plans it shall not be
made subject to rate standards
are mandated benefits or
coverage not otherwise generally
people.
So tell me what the impact of
that is because I read that to
say.
For both of because I'm a group
health group health plans in
this section which is applies to
both where it's under fifty
employees and over fifty
employees that no one under this
is going to be subject to raise
standards are mandated benefits
in our state which is a part and
so I appreciate the question
Senator and St James.
Mr chair Senator I'm sorry Mr
chair and then Senator I
apologize the.
I have not Senator for the New
Mexico legislature before yes my
apologies
So what this languages trying to
to accomplish and and we work
carefully with us I and let's
council is the idea that if a PO
has more than fifty worksite
employees.
it gets treated like any other
employer who's by any other
large group employer in the
state of New Mexico if a PO is
under fifty if it's treated like
any other small employer in the
state of New Mexico what this
language is saying is basically
that only those rules that apply
to that market apply to the PO
based on the size so if you're a
small PO we give under fifty
worksite employees in New Mexico
small group coverage and only
those small group coverage rules
that apply to you and if you are
PO with more than fifty worksite
employees
you'd be treated like a large
group plan and only those large
to market rules apply to you
what this is trying to do is
saying don't don't try to don't
try to apply small rules to a
large group PO sponsored plan
and OSI we talked very closely
those I on this language it was
carefully discussed in OSI
supportive of this line to
basically a small group rules
apply to a small group and
sponsored by PO larger rules
apply to a large group plan plan
to sponsored by the PTO.
And and Mr chair at I appreciate
that understand that explanation
but that's not what the language
here stuff.
What the language here says is
that for whether there that's
the smaller the the larger that
they're not subject to raise
standards mandated benefits so
chair let me clarify again I
appreciate the question it's is
not otherwise generally
applicable to policies offered
in the respective group market
Mr chair that's another that so
that's another kind of a portion
of that sentence after and for
before that for is a shall not
be made subject to raise
standards or mandate budget for
coverage not otherwise generally
applicable so so this first to
stand alone and I to all of
these.
Please Senator finish speaking
before you begin.
Start one idea would be to add
the word mandated for coverage I
guess and it would be to raise
standards or mandated benefits
or mandated coverage.
Not otherwise strongly
applicable is it the is that the
concern that so that not
otherwise gonna put the ball
flies to a all of those right
standards mandated benefits and
coverage.
Mr chair at I have I think we're
probably miss communicating here
because I think we might be
talking about two different
things I'm not worried about
that or covers on otherwise
generally applicable applied
everything I'm real worried
about the fact that right
standards mandated benefits that
that this state has passed at in
with otherwise apply but it
certainly to probably to the
smaller ones that I think is my
understanding would not sorry Mr
chair and senator
That language which again we
work with let's council on is
intended to read.
So you can read is shall not be
made public to raise standards
not otherwise only applicable to
policies offered in the
respective group market to which
the group health plan belongs.
So it's intended to qualify all
three of those phrases right
standards mandated benefits and
coverage are all qualified right
now and that's why there is an I
guess an absence of commas but
not otherwise really applicable
policies and miscellaneous this
Mr chair I think that's the
and then the you should re write
it and write the whole because
House written right now that the
fact we're having this
conversation so there's no
ambiguity here and that is an
ambiguity that I don't want use
to deny it New Mexican insurers
otherwise mandated benefits and
raise standards that they might
otherwise be entitled to half
and so.
That's that's all I got to check
but that is as it is now I I I
can't vote for this
without that language.
Committee members questions
about.
Thank you Mr chair and thank you
senator up who is a leasing
contractor and it gives pursuant
to the employee leasing Act what
can you tell me who are leasing
contractor in New Mexico would
be sure so so that it would be
if PED so that and when peeling
issue started off they were
known as employees and
contractors and that is why
excuse me chair and senator I
apologize
but when you think of a PO
typical PO's operate New Mexico
would be Insperity eighty P.
paychecks these are large public
companies that through taking on
common law employer status
Mexico common player status
basically allow New Mexico
employers a look I want to focus
on running my business I will
agree to let you I I'm gonna
basically work with you you'll
come home player of my worksite
employees and then I'll they
handle things like HR compliance
tax tax reporting withholding
under their E. I. N. they do
payroll administration they
really love the small business
to focus on the you know driving
even a driving revenue growing
their business focusing on those
things in the PTO handle sort of
all of the other things that a
you have to do like comply with
New Mexico regulations as a
small business so essentially Mr
chair and.
And no major they they provide
cheap labor to business is that
what so they actually don't
they're not a staffing firm to
anything of a staffing firm we
think of like Kelly staffing of
those sorts of companies we
actually have labor what this is
is say you run a let's say you
run a pizzeria in Santa Fe are
probably a bad example you
review your run a talker area
and Santa Fe.
So if we do put my construction
company in place and say I have
these twenty six employees I
don't want to hire a bookkeeper
and accounting to do my payroll
to make H. R. to do that all the
management in qualifying terms
under contracts I would hire PO
and say here here's a number of
employees here's where they're
going here's our hours in they
take over the rest and make sure
compliance with every state
agency we offer insurance
benefits which are expanding
that to if they chose are to get
insurance then we could choose
to go through their standard
form company or you thank you
choose on their own.
But the P. is not bringing labor
to the table to the client
employers already hired whether
they want what they're really
saying is I don't I don't want
to you know I am maybe I'm of
the salon and item not skilled
in all the complexities of tax
reporting withholding and
payroll administration and all
these things into the PO comes
in and says okay well I will
become a comb player of your
employees and I will I will
handle for you as the co
employer things like wait for
forty in administration and and
really allow us that small
business owner to eighty more
compliant with things like state
insurance laws state income tax
laws state withholding I mean
PO's really support small
business and running you know
and doing what they want to do
one of the things P. as have
done in New Mexico for twenty
years is offer large group
coverage
which you know small businesses
and their employees enjoy access
to health care
this variety of the regulation
that that was intended to
address association health plans
which is something
and basically just because with
the rules drafted it picked up
employee leasing company
sponsored plans is this Las
Vegas intended to codify what
has been going on in the state
what's been allowed by the state
and you know what happens in
every other state productive.
We're not trying to change
anything.
Mr chair Senator if you're not
trying to change anything why
are you here in front of us and
what we're trying to we're
trying to check I'm sorry Mr
chair and senator for trying to
codify in the statute which has
been something that happened
for.
Ever sort of in New Mexico until
that regulations passed in in in
working with aside this is how
they think it can be codified in
the statue in a way that that
works best.
I don't have anything further
eight I'd really you're you're
the answer me is.
Was very confusing I think but I
I just don't have any other
questions I will I will have a
lot of other questions but we
certainly don't have the time
tonight so all we that that for
now Mr chair.
Members.
So Mr chair so one of the
reasons folks want to be under
these large groups that about
rather than small groups because
there's different mandated
coverages for the small groups
versus large groups right you so
for the small ones we have to
that they have for five
essential health benefits
correct correct to get but the
large ones do not right they do
not have to provide mandated
essential health benefits all
right and thank you
and this bill helps categorize
more folks into the large rather
than the small is that correct
And yet I think the answer is it
wouldn't be the kind of right
there there are there already in
the larger market in the state
of New Mexico Senator it chair
and senator to need so they're
already they're already covered
entities under these plans is
what I would say so I don't know
that it changes the current
situation but yes in the absence
of the in the absence of this
codification in light of just as
regulation without it being
changed
current small businesses that
enjoys being covered under very
comprehensive coverage you know
they don't have to be under this
coverage they can choose
whatever they want
They wouldn't be able to be
covered of those plans anymore
so that construction company
that let me stop you because
also under this bill it's not
they're not necessarily under
comprehensive covers there and
it covers that by definition
does not have to include
essential health benefits so I I
see this is posing.
I I I see this is posing a risk
to New Mexico's insurance and
and reducing potential I see why
small businesses might my R.
might businesses in general
might like maybe being able to
get enters these larger ones
where it's might be a little
more cost effective for them but
they could with.
Would be at the cost of I think.
Budget budget two to the
employees who are seeking to be
insured that's all I have Mister
chair the committee members
questions.
Action pleasure.
a motion from anyone.
All right we're gonna roll over
this bill and move on to the
next I don't businesses got no
action from the committee.
Most of.
Good treat that centers the roll
over for now the state no
motion.
Certainly does of.
As.
Thank you to forty one X.
center.
Your.
Thank you Mr chairman and
senators for the bill to forty
one which was really discussed
in the last session about the
change in Mexico's economy and
diversify its economy and has
New Mexico prosper through that
we learned a few things through
the summer we learned about
fires we learned about the needs
in New Mexico and emergency
needs so we move this through
and discussed it widely to
things interim committees but
the council really does set a
structure the dollar amount is
it for discussion purposes is a
billion dollars as you look at
billion dollars you distributed
to to ten buckets throughout the
system and the.
Senator and other giving a hand
up.
We have sixty.
Six to get right yes in addition
we have a service to build madam
chair.
Thank you.
This is that there okay you're
on the move the service to get.
What will all all moved it for
the purposes of discussion.
Decades that scene and.
Okay so you take that billion
dollars distribute to technical
buckets in the state Mexico and
say these are things that we
know happens each and every day
in New Mexico the wildfires came
along there was no way to access
quick money to help those people
out the governor had to declare
seventy six emergencies in order
to get enough money to help the
people of the fires but as as
New Mexico moves forward and
help we had discussions a
government operates all year
long and capital which is due
today is a hard thing to do and
they show up at least thirty
sixty days period trying to get
all the Cavalli can for the for
what their needs are this sets
up a funds buckets so if there's
water conservation needs in New
Mexico that a federal grant
comes out in any match money
they'll be able to grab that
federal match match money with
and do that if there is a mental
health crisis or behavioral
health crisis or shortage in a
hospital you'll be able to help
fund those those needs in New
Mexico so you look through those
ten buckets that they add
flexibility and they actually
had year round operation to
Mexico we look at the courts and
corrections and public safety
that we know we have emergencies
that are happening Hey and we're
not here all the time and so
that gives them the ability to
grab that money if you look at
the make make up of the council
in this is this is a lot of
discussion it's composed eight
members and we look at DFA
secretary finance committee
sectors in the council education
administrative office of the
courts NMFA in this building so
she should counties in order to
move forward
We do not putting cabinet
secretaries because they're the
ones that should be making the
ripple needs and the council's
administrative tax to DFA on
their federal and local
governments and roll front tier
and cap outlay in GST.
Powers and the duties of the
counselor to act in in
appropriate money to fund as
things come up with crisis
response match funding tribal
infrastructure capital planning
economic in rural development
and so we move forward in the
state.
It's also designed is over
reserve fund in New Mexico since
some of us that have been here
since declined we know that when
we come back if we had to empty
out reserves and had no money
left we need other places to
start looking before you start
cutting of.
Statewide government local
agents are agencies education
and so we're trying to really
build a cushion between math and
the next recession when it does
happen with this
kind of touched on the.
In the gallery knows Adrian and
Adrian and it is worked on this
and we looked at the internet
anything you think I need to
add.
Now Mr chair.
We remain on the screen.
Thank you Serrano so we've got
to register to speak on the
build support or opposition.
So we'll go next to members the
committee I still got a quorum
good
numbers committee with questions
Sir Stuart.
Thank you Mr chairman.
So I don't quite understand who
makes these appropriation.
I mean it sounds as though we're
out of it.
That this you know if this is no
longer legislative appropriation
it's just go Asian.
Where where's the fun rest and
move
all of this money and food pro
free.
Senator Stewart good
Mr chair Senator Stewart so the
money's appropriated by the
legislature into the fund into
the buckets and the council
would administer it year round
based on certain criteria
there's four criteria and if you
look on page two the little
triangles in the top corner are
the different instances in which
money can actually move out of
their
through the council so you have
matching federal funding that
becomes available the windows
only three months we're not in
legislative session.
Pull the money from one of the
budgets if there's a crisis like
the fires that we've seen and we
need to get funding before FEMA
Texas use the money
And then with tribal if there's
any matching money that tribes
need in order to be able to
promote their infrastructure
they have that access and then
any planning and design needs in
terms of capital across all
local governments that's also
accessible those are the only
four categories in which money
can be potentially used and sent
out by the council otherwise the
money is there to be
appropriated by the legislature
so that counseling that projects
prepare them bring into you all
and give recommendations how to
use the remaining money in the
budget that you appropriate from
the previous year.
So Mister chairman.
Seventeen members in this
council.
Eight voting and nine nonvoting
Public flippers.
Correct Mr chair Senator.
So the eight voting members are
basically.
Areas that directors of the LFC
L. E. S. C. and and let's
finance.
This only in their.
Association of.
The line non voting public
members are one in nine
categories three by the governor
six by eight council I don't
know there's just sort of seems
like this is the start up a
whole nother legislature.
Smaller of course but.
To decide how billion dollars is
going to be.
I have that right Mr chair
Senator not a billion dollars
can be distributed only twenty
million out of reach funding the
beginning correct can be
distributed and then the fund
stays there and as projects are
vetted they can distribute from
there we look at how does NMFA
operators because I government
there's a couple bills out there
that says everybody's trying to
figure out how this really works
but we looked at NMFA's
operation we looked at PSC posi.
P. as a PC of PS PS you'll see
how they operate and their
council approved projects we do
the same thing with them we we
budget money and then they vet
the projects they bring them
back in and we wrap them up in
the bill and so that's the party
structure of this bill to figure
out operational side we know the
needs exist you know that needs
exist year round the operational
side is so complex in this in
everywhere we went with come
back to this and how we do that.
So you have the correct.
LFC.
Eight pound.
I don't know I.
I.
This is about the issue of
super.
No we have to directors of the
three councils we have school
boards we have
You see
so it just seems to me like
we're setting up more of what we
have right now.
To distribute.
This money differently.
No I'll try to listen to figure
it out but.
I thank you thank you Sir do.
Thank you Mr chair.
So I have two questions I'm
looking at page five.
lands fourteen basically sixteen
whether same for emergency
transfers it takes to a two
thirds majority vote of of those
this is not
for the eight internet phoning
members.
And then I'm looking at page
eight.
Where has to be unanimous vote
and I'm of page
right mind when one has to be a
unanimous vote of the same
members tried in fact crisis
they have to unanimously
identified prices but then two
thirds of them can actually move
the money why why are those are
those different numbers for
those things Mr chair Senator
Duhigg
also with the crisis one right
so with the crisis it's very
difficult to determine a crisis
sometimes it could be by
executive order the governor
however sometimes a crisis could
be something small like a mutual
domestic their pipes broke and I
need something quick correct to
get water the community so if
everyone's in agreement that
that's a crisis it's like let's
move the money right now in
terms of the other stuff
matching federal dollars or
emergency transfers the firm.
So I'm yes after I should should
like if you finish I apologize
thank you Mr chair and senator
Dick so the emergency transfers
would be
two thirds are sorry the the
transfers in terms of funding
the projects that can be moved
would be two thirds so that
would be six seventy eight
members and considering that
three out of those eight happen
to be LFC LCS and ESE it
maintains that you will still
have kind of a veto over those
type of
moves so it ensures that as a
legislature the the control
still on this side so that's why
it was two thirds instead of
half are a major.
And I guess Mr chairman
specialist and and and then it
might be that I'm conflating two
things on this thing I was
assuming that if a crisis the
staff that's when you're doing
an emergency transfer and so if
you your requiring unanimity to
find identify crisis but not
unanimity to then do the
transfer
like like why why would you
require unanimity to get step
walk get to step one but not do
stuff too that is my question
though Mr chair Senator Ortiz so
let's look at the cap canyon
fire for example right.
the board would hopefully
identify that unanimously as an
emergency.
however because they identified
as an emergency now they can
take projects from the local
municipal governments and start
betting them associated with the
emergency so maybe the power
lines maybe something with the
water structure maybe to fix the
building and with those some
might be better options than
others and that's where it would
be two thirds so it just it
classified the group of projects
that can be vetted and approved
would be unanimous just like
that's except projects and then
afterwards taking you twenty
just a two thirds major.
So my other question is all of
these nine nonvoting members.
I mean kind of what's the point
of that if they're not very and
I get that they'll have some
expertise in those areas.
But if but if they have no
powers.
No state license other than the
US feeling as the Legislature
like we're have some we're
putting folks on here and the
governor feel like she has her
pick up some folks on here what
is the point of that.
Mr chair Senator Duhigg the work
groups because they are going to
be reading all the projects of
they would be the ones in charge
of those work groups organizing
them getting them done going to
the projects to bring to the
council why don't we want them
to have a.
Mr chair Mr chair Senator Duhigg
that was a really difficult
thing that we kept going back
and forth on specifically
because if it happens to be that
they get a vote then if someone
outside of government outside of
the legislature's who suddenly
has an appropriation power.
Right and it dilutes the.
The total number of people that
can vote so it was a.
Difficult call in that can be
changed to voting if you all
feel like it
but yes it was one it was a
comment that someone said when
we were discussing this with
different groups and they said
oh that person gets appointed is
going to have the very very
popular.
Right and everyone's going to go
to them lobby them and we're
trying to remove that we're
trying to make sure that their
expertise is used they're part
of the workgroup to help
facilitate this but in terms of
actually getting the money to
these projects they should not
be those decision makers if that
makes.
Mr and and that that does make
sense three but I guess I just
then I'm looking at the other
people who we are giving kind of
that appropriating power to the
through like you Senator Stewart
Senators are not the legislature
I I.
I think that's a that's a good
good point she made
Yes that's all I have right now
Mr chair thank you.
The twenty questions so we're
thank you Mr chairman and that I
appreciate that the concept of
what we're doing I point the
committee to.
Eight twenty one is appropriate
a billion dollars in these funds
so this is a major.
and and then there's a lot of
sense that as we talk about this
using nonrecurring dollars
decree funds can spin off money
and and I'll just say you know
I'm I'm working with Senator the
bill on a new fund that.
That again for conservation
Senate bill nine and and what we
did in that fund that I think.
Yes I have all these new
structures all existing program
already established with we work
with the process and then
allocated to dollars to those
existing programs and so in some
ways similar I just one thing I
want is them on the fourth and
one restoration act something I
carry that's been on the books
and that's a group of folks to
come in and they fiscal quarter
we have we want to all the
nuances of who's on the board
getting the balance right but
that was all done in the other
statute not in that line and the
new fund but then that board
basically takes the dollars and
eight targeted to their specific
purpose and I think that the
there is a challenge here and I
I have some reservations as well
about about.
You know what what we're giving
away our appropriating power if
you're gonna be real careful how
we do that and that's the scary
part of this is that okay who
exactly is going to make these
decisions as we move forward but
the general concept of what
you're doing.
I think this is the direction
with this kind of revenues that
we need to take a serious look
at and we're doing some of it
already the session by you know
there's also I think in the LFC
budget there's a proposal for a
bunch of money the severance tax
permanent fund again that's an
existing fund nonrecurring
million for a future for future
day but.
You know if this is the
direction I think we're going to
go in the next couple years
exactly how this.
All plays out I think it's going
to be the challenge of it but I
just want to throw that out
because I do think that's the
fundamental question is is it's
not just the.
The dollars and this is the
structure of this morning you
guys are here just from and I
really appreciate that Adrian
then.
From the New Mexico listen what
if this person is there what
this person's not there but it
is critical that we get that as
close to right as we can for
this going to be hard for the.
You know the do it once it's
gone because I do think it will
you know that group will be.
Right during that money in
emergencies versus look at what
we're doing now with the fires
and embers doesn't doesn't work
doesn't work so just in Boston
which are projected to change
and what senator this is exactly
right is how do we retain our
legislative authority but how do
we make government operational
emergency instances or you know
even throughout the the year
everybody there's federal grants
that come out and there's no
match money and for there's
tribal requests for federal
match money and how do we make
that operational if we have
throughout the year so we
actually spend less of our
dollars in the apply for the
federal grant there's one that I
was called about today where if
we put a hundred fifty thousand
dollars in the budget we get
nine million from the feds under
some border Authority and so
these those things look at if
we're not here you know we could
get give out a hundred fifty
thousand and get in line nine
million dollar return from the
federal government those are the
things that I think New Mexico
needs to move forward towards
right how do we create that the
infrastructure and and the board
structure is the hardest thing
for us to create because worship
life should be in New Mexico as
I agency should be more from
innovation we look at P. S. C.
O. C. but none of us want to
give up authority because we
don't know the council is going
to be on the L. E. S. C. we
don't know who's beyond LFC we
don't know who's going to be in
charge of of anything and so how
do we maintain that control but
I think the two most important
things in the plan is is that we
build the reserve in a
recessionary way and that we
make government more operational
in emergency circumstances and
and throughout the year.
Which.
Very important.
I love the concept that I'm sure
earns about the implementation
why is that this other and see
the doctor our appropriation
power.
I just like Senator Wirth
approach
so.
Where site.
Love this bill
I don't love the.
As a result I actually value
this happens thank you Sir you
for the committee Senator thank
I know I've already talked
already that Mr Chairman so
I you know I look at the sub
accounts I don't know why you
put L. E. S. C.
director on here because there's
nothing in the sub accounts for
public schools L. E. S. C. is
basically for public schools.
So I don't I don't see what.
What benefit they would have if
there's no funding for education
higher at the deli is C. can't
deal with higher at.
Madam chair Mr chair Senator if
you look at that if you look at
clean energy insights right
which is kind towards the middle
if there's something the schools
that science technology that
they want to promote or they
can.
Their their science and
technology for them there's
mental health and and and
behavioral health issues that
they can access in those funds
Academic research is is part of
it I thank the cultural climate
resiliency.
Education could tap any of those
things saying you know we want
to have a
Thanks to technology school and
we need.
Twenty thousand dollars for this
computer system that's going to
do this and that's why we
thought education was important
in science technology and mental
health issues if they have a
mental health issue the prices
of the school and in for any
reason our behavior health issue
said we need five million
dollars to do something.
thank you come to them and say
okay where's there's ability to
get funds.
service that it I don't have
anybody else little believed.
Leisure the committee is there
to.
Just now I I don't know what
we're going to do on this but on
page for you talk when we talk
about so many members should be
of the same political party
we've been putting language and
then every bill that says and
those members are not have
change that medical affiliation
within last two years
That would be language that
should probably be added to this
as well.
Thank you just make that motion
are I'm not sure what the will
of this committee zoom
you get a sense the doing
surgery on the bill's going to
be time well spent fracking.
Let's just see if it looks like
we're going to make some
progress on when we want to do
some work on it I'm so we hear
from others in the committee.
Pleasure the committee for
action.
In the right.
Does stay with us.
We're working on this a little
bit more effects and I you know
it's it's going to get him put
it in the structure and I this
is what I'm thinking we may come
back and look you may come back
and look just and start an
emergency fund there's another
farger in the summer and then
maybe give the executive some
power and some and looked at
some other power to start that
fund but the mental health issue
is another thing that I believe
in my heart that's a crisis
everywhere and that.
If we have an opportunity to
grow mental health throughout
the year and appropriate money
that's that's another funded it
we're gonna figure out a
different structure to do that
we knew that was the issue
coming in here we knew that if
it struggle in but this is the
way New Mexico and we're gonna
have to operate in the future
for two things we never know
what's going to happen in New
Mexico our inability to get
emergency funds out and make
emergency funds useful in
certain areas and.
The way our budget is set up is.
With the thirty roughly thirty
two percent increase in
reoccurring spending over the
over the last.
We need to make sure when the
economy down.
In happens that we have some
place to go before we go looking
at agencies and you know
education before start cutting
down Tory need to build that
reserve fund but makes other
things operational with the
fifty years will come back in
and we'll look at slimming down
the funds and trying to figure
out operational system that they
can put proofed and maybe just
quickly and maybe you guys give
us some thoughts on it if we put
emergency mental health into PS
C. O. C. allow them tap that
they had to come to have that
Senator.
Mr chair yes C. O. C. capital
outlay for school not
operational.
Not at.
We need mental health we need to
be a for.
I just want us to put money into
that I mean why give it to
somebody else but.
We have the money I just wish we
had sort of more creative ideas
right now of our own of student
because this to me is like okay
gotta go different Council and
that fund you that you know nine
seventeen people that are going
to decide we we should.
I agree with you but just one
quick comment is that the other
door we spent seven hundred and
sixty five or ninety five
million in mental health through
a to do it HSD and I have no
results.
Hello anywhere in the
legislature so that is something
we need to really work.
Before the center so we know
we're not taking action on it
I'm purposely not doing that
because we don't have a motion
photos of when I'm not making a
motion because I'd like to be
able to continue working on this
I very much support what Senator
Wirth said I think what he's
doing this session I know it's
hard to do with
Resources right now we can go
through it and maybe we'll have
something to show for it maybe
we won't to oftentimes it seems
like in last year's spent
enormous amounts of money is as
you six suggested to tech
problems and negligible of any
results for it from spending so
I am very much favored by a side
on this bill to create some of
these permanent funds when I
look at states like of of
frankly it's kind of ensuring
you when you look at some of the
Scandinavian social democracy as
we look at those countries in
history the the existed largely
about having put aside very
large sums of money back in
their history in time of an
office resources Alaska and
other states including do so and
this seems to be what we should
be do it for the future of the
state recognizing as all I'm
looking on this committee so
many of us are working hard to
get ourselves off of carbon
fuels the economies and so we're
doing that and we know that
that's a good goal but if we're
that's the source of the funding
we're kind of working at cross
purposes unless we do something
like this so I supported I hope
you'll use the next three weeks
to maybe find to it so.
K. thank you thank you.
We're going to hear us Senate to
twenty three studio opens child
support schedule changes.
Sixty
sixteen yeah we're going to do
that we're going to do this one
and we're gonna give it less
than ten minutes.
and then maybe we can get
another dealer to sell that.
Mr chairman I do have people
here from the U. K. in addition.
Yes Representative two of
similar to that one may work
within our time Senator so I'll
try to that this this one should
be very simple Senate bill two
twenty three we're just putting
the Authority for the child
support guidelines into that
apartment agency with them to
publish their own schedule as
opposed to just putting it in
statute that's all the stuff is
that right that's absolutely
right do you have anybody
supporting our offices because
of the.
Impact.
any for any committee
professionals debate discussion.
The the motion for do pass or
any objections we do have the
right to Soto Stuart o'neill
thank you Mr boxes we were.
When we have a good bill is a
good idea if you through this
committee very simple right
let's see here.
Yeah everybody's good and
everybody's just shout out
everybody shut out whatever you
everyone so I can ignore all of
you uniformed.
Well three oh two and then.
Remember everyone here to gain
but it's one thousand years it's
an oldie but a goodie you all
know it very well by now so we
need to make sure
Judicial centers oversight
pretty simple Senator you saw
explained that last bill also on
social media explain their bill
for them
we made a mistake the house made
in the state they did a last
minute amendment on our ethics
bill they want to they added
that court appointed
commissioners hearing officers
administrative law judges or
special masters working under
the jurisdiction of the judicial
standards commission that's
unconstitutional constitution
says that the judicial standards
commission will only be dealing
with judges.
And what are the other two
thirds the justices justices and
magistrates and magistrates and
so this just takes out those
that the panoply of different
workers have from on being under
the judicial standards
commission I have with me
so us to Mingus you Senator
Senator of two so that was done
over on the house side yeah in
the the what when how long ago
was that the it so I've got it
right here was March fifteenth
twenty nineteen Greg Nibert.
Sen Daniel Ivey Soto.
For the judicial system's art so
anything new to add to what the
sponsors are total site it's
pretty straightforward you
taking those positions out there
members we don't have anybody
registered on the bill Mexico.
Motion FOR do pass committee
question Senator Ivey Soto thank
you but my one concern is that
folks aren't covered by anybody
else.
And so I would be nice if we had
something in this bill that that
they are responsive to.
Because because then those
positions are the only ones as
New Mexico now because that's
commission the legislative
ethics committee the judicial
standards commission.
Everybody is covered except for
these officers.
So.
I don't want to remove this from
there that's fine.
We would be that would put them
someplace else.
So yeah I'd like to join and I
when I understand the issue and
I understand why you do it is
but I I show the same concern of
it's kind of strange but more
and more I'm seeing judges using
special masters
for any number of different
things discovery purposes or
even water issues anything
frankly anything that's very
complicated the judges these
days ponton get a special master
to advise the court on on those
issues and.
I like the fact that that that
they would be subject to
judicial standards commission
and I same thing with
administrative law judges I
would think hearing officers
with the PRC you know right now
the PRC use hearing offices for
everything right Mr chairman we
we need a constitutional
amendment to put these people
under the judicial standards
commission they can't they can't
deal with it because they're not
allowed to do it we have an AG
opinion so yes find some other
agency or whatever but you know
it was it just well it stopped
the judicial standards
commission to be told to do
something that's
unconstitutional that's all this
bill that right and could I have
fulfill say some Mr chair and
senator Daniel Ivey Soto the
hearing officers and some
special commissioners are
injured there court employees so
they are under the disciplinary
authority of the chief judges of
the District Court the the we
are and you know judicial
individual granted
administrative law judges and
some special masters are under
the executive branch so we would
be happy to have you know have
jurisdiction over the hearing
officers or anything you all
think it's appropriate but to do
it through an amendment to the
constitution were mandated by
the constitution or jurisdiction
and is mandated by the
constitution over justices
judges and magistrates of all
New Mexico judges are of course
what we're gonna do this and
Senator Senator ever so those
concerns what we take him out of
this who is going to oversee the
maintenance so we can do a
constitutional I would disagree
with the statement special
masters part executive branch I
don't know in my experience I
see special measures point
register point all the time
these days Mr chair that is
correct that there are some that
are also part of the the
executive branch there are there
part of the judicial Brenda G.
yes of course but if you just
went but they're also under the
jurisdiction of the disciplinary
jurisdiction I guess of the
chief judge of the District
Court there are two statutes
well I under.
Standard of the discipline
Authority the chief judge the
Chief Justice of the of the
judge of this court does not
have investigated
Abilities they don't have the
staffing issues I'm I think
we're we're not gonna be labor
the engine's gonna be done but
but I I just want to reemphasize
Senator point which is we're
we're leaving a lot of people
now fund supervisor you're
really good and because we can't
with the existing long
constitutional dictates so what
what what to do something about
Senator and then I don't know
that's I think that's it thank
you appreciate him but we're
we're good we gotta do passed
motion by on this bill three oh
to is there any further
discussion.
Senator Wirth and survivors
really quick coming.
We could it could go a
constitutional amendment we can
do a member here correct
sometimes all of it could be on
the ballot in November I mean I
guess the question I mean we've
been doing this for you to I
will be just as Mr chairman and
senator so for the last four
years judicial standards has
been handling all these folks
are just with their level.
In one.
Okay so those are not that's
happening we're doing all.
Correct that's the important
thing this year we're doing no
harm and I I mean I think we
should put together
constitutional I mean assuming
what I'm hearing correct this is
a logical place for some of
these at least the Beyonder I
mean I think we could put
together a constitutional
amendment that eight percent of
the voters in November this year
and that might be because I
because I also read the worst
thing we could do is part of
somebody somewhere else for
eight months that doesn't work
you know so that's the challenge
of of where do they go and how
and how do we make that
decision.
I was of health insurances you
know I.
I service that.
Because this is our.
Justice minister or maybe this
plan approval.
An office yeah yeah yeah.
But.
I don't see where firms as
follows.
And that now they've taken the
position they have any issues.
For that for the that they're
not going to.
Regulate these folks these folks
who frankly.
Very often become judges.
And here offices very often
become judges and and and they
develop bad habits.
Up and and so I I would much
prefer us to work on a
constitutional amendment that.
And that's that that's what it
takes to simply add then you
know and other and other
officers as provided by law.
or judicial officers as provided
by law and and and then we
rectified the situation that way
because.
You know it was this this
language was very intentional in
terms of making sure that
everybody was covered.
I think I think instead of
removing them.
It's going on right now I would
prefer that we leave this
language here more composition
of.
Yeah Mr chair.
I just think we need to do both.
I think we need to do both I
mean because if they're not do
if they can't do anything now
then it just it seems to me we
need to clear up so that it's
because otherwise you got some.
Really weird and I appreciate
anything in is we've also.
You know if one lawyer chuckle
yeah and so I I just not my
personal opinion I think we
should develop but I think we
should do it so the bottom out
of this November.
The act.
pleasure committee questions.
Senator.
Two passed motion.
You further discussion was to
roll call on this one center I'm
not at.
Senator you yes Senator Stewart
yes Senator Wirth yes Senator
Duhigg yes Senator group this
yes and yeah would you pass
although share with the user
Senator to hope center words
written I think is a by is the
right one we should be doing
this both in and I also
understand ways and
Representative about maybe
better to.
No put put the sprinkler head
now but I think I think we'll do
both things thank you would you
past
That I'm gonna take a little for
August from the chair Senate
bill three away constitutional
questions they may want to hear
that discussion or debate again
we pass that we haven't been
style house floor repeatedly so
Rules rules have some members
of.
There are.
Forty eight.
Two forty eight yes.
probably do these members can we
improve enough Senator.
Does is the only movie.
And then the office can.
Party.
Okay.
Two forty eight to forty eight
Mr chairman members of the
committee set of bills to forty
eight
presentation less than five
minutes modernizes the the
probate courts this is a project
that was worked on in
conjunction with the probate
judge's also with the county
clerk's who at for the
constitution except as otherwise
provided by law are the default
clerks of the probate court and
with the spring court and with
that and it has all of their
support and what that would have
to stand for questions we have
people here for the spring court
and from the counties to
indicate support my recollection
centers we've heard this issue
before in this committee before
right to your amendment we would
not actually all of them Mr
chairman let's council found.
A small tackle there's a past us
the X..
This is a real.
All right so service so close
the amendment to two forty eight
this is the three ninety three
point one amendment right for us
corrected typographical errors
in any discussion on the
proposed amendment.
Three eighty three point one
strikes one as because of
one to many type of graphical
error.
Should be no question for the
committee the debate.
The objection.
Sir Stuart.
Four nine nine I only see one as
care.
When you drop down yes the
profiteer there's another just.
Apparently not in my that was
part of the
**** Amendment they added that's
where the added that for as for
the removal.
All I know they handed to me and
said.
We have an extra as.
We go straight this.
The contact.
It is.
As there and then the struggle
that put another as a.
We don't.

see a reason to go to the
proponents and representative of
all due respect to all who
waited and for their willingness

could talked this to death
there's no need to we could but
we could also get some of the
work done to so.
Leisure the committee there's a
do pass motion by Senator
Stewart any further discussion
rush this but I've had a chance

This is a.
So changing fifty six fifty
seven for right yeah oversight.
Page two by twenty four page

Thank you to the rules committee
for catching the oversight and
drafting.
And I can the the other one.
With the mall on the line Mr
smaller do you have the impasto
we have a the other one is not
drafted again this is whatever
we're talking about not from the
members of the not being the
same political party has
provided.
Changes
in the last two years it was
hoping we get that exactly right
sharks that location on line
will loans of which is.
Okay good.
Hey I like twenty two.
After the Syria.
And Sir.
Members shall not change their
political affiliations within
the last two years or within two
years.
Should I change their party
affiliation the legislative sure

the same thing I pretty
filiation that within will use
is
appropriations part two years
and subject matter as to violate
the.
this.
Thank you for the lessons.
Right I thank you for retiring
from all.
Representative language that Mr
chair because they were
different this just says no more
than they should be able to say
I
part of that.

amendments by Senator doing any
further discussion on those
amendments any objection to the
documents the.
Those moments are adopted
pleasure to mess risotto to pass
as amended in ways to with this
reviewed any objection seeing
none so show up percent I would
sort of Stewart o'neill to serve
on this and Wirth to pass on
three oh eight.
All right in the one.
I don't think the thirty five
thousand but.
Do it in two minutes that's
fair.
Senate three thirty five with
the advice of my vice chair and.
Steam colleagues to thirty five.
We're doing some damage to the
good.
Well I'm on my you know we I
think you'll have three bills
actually before you lost a
Corman I'm sorry about that.
We've we've made a lot of room
for two years.
Mr chair in two thousand
nineteen we included Conservancy
distance districts are local
election act they are not ready
to go and yet we are not set up
in a way that we can can run
those elections smoothly so this
would just delay them going into
that act for another two years.
Emergency and and the other
Conservancy districts around the
state of the list is not going
with you as an expert of there
are half a dozen proponents will
recognize their support there
are no opponents registered in
opposition and support
Representative levels of this
lotus applications setter would
leave here to prove John
Thompson and chasing because ago
Larry Herman and Maggie Toulouse
Oliver is available as soon but
again there being no opponents.
With the other committees
concurrence we won't go to
proponents are here from the so
what we're gonna do passed
motion I believe I heard that
from Santo Ivey Soto Senator
Stewart center store thank you
on a new path motion other
further questions Senator Ivey
Soto question yeah thank you Mr
I I just I just want to say that
how frustrated I am and I think
the secretary of state's office.
At the need to do this this is
due to some of the intransigence
we've experienced problem
specifically Ortiz.
R. Charlie is not a problem
caused by.
Those are the districts not been
a problem up and and they were
given extra time to deal with
some of their it is a process
and using this as and it's that
they've just simply chosen not
to do anything.
And I and I make the statement
right now recognizing we have to
pass this bill it's a necessity.
But I also want everyone to
remember that so that we're not
in the same position two years
from now.
Of kicking the ball kicked the
can down the road thank thank
you right one to pass motion is
there any objection to do past
motion.
Seeing none Senator Ivey Soto
Senator Stewart center o'neill
Center do X. or survive so worth
in support of you do pass motion
to pass all right the last but
business will be able to tackle
this evening will be Senate bill
sixty nine my apologies anybody
else was waiting but you'll be
right at the top from Monday
Senator Stewart I think years
ago involve some discussion of
the observers I don't I don't
think that's something I want to
rush.
Like I say us.
I think I think it's I think
it's important I think it's
important to do I think we
should draw attention to the
problem this problem and we
don't have Center cheesy piano
here.
Senator Ivy Soto senatorial
access things take some time
some.
So we will try to get that done
tonight all right we're gonna
try Senate six not I gotta tell
you I thought this is going to
simple bill it's not looking
quite that way but let's see can
commences in five minutes it is
Senator Sedillo thank you Mr
chair the reason it's a simple
bill is that it just of which
four in for love
three tiers of of electric
bicycles welcome to slow
bicycles to businesses the
little bit faster bicycles and
then the very fast classical.
we learned in or we had a good
discussion in tax and revenue
that will what about bikes that
are even faster than twenty
eight miles an hour and so we
had a discussion among all of
the all of the people who
brought this bill and what we
agreed to do that's why I have a
committee substitute is defined
those bikes not as motorcycles
but electric utility device
because the different for
motorcycles because they have
pedals and so basically what
we're doing is codifying
something that states around the
country doing but we're also
taking care of of the fact that
there are even faster bicycles
that shouldn't really be on
trails and the motor vehicle
department really should be of.
Regulating the so that's that's
why it's it's not a real complex
bill.
And I'll turn it over to my
experts the board yet Mr
chairman members of the
committee real quickly what you
have here.
But most of this bill is an
existing law the child helmet
safety at which applies to
bicycles and Lyndall Senator
Lopez pass that built years ago
but now we have all the bikes we
have electric bicycles and the
child helmet safety law needs to
also apply to even icicles so in
this bill we define electric
assisted bicycle and we know
what other states are doing they
fall in the class one class two
class to class one class two
class three that is a pretty you
these are uniform definitions
that are used by manufacturers
these electric bicycles can be
bought anywhere in Santa Fe and
they have a sticker on one two
or three which is exactly what
these definitions are but there
are bicycles that can go faster
than twenty miles per hour and
they shouldn't be classified as
electric assisted bicycles so we
had to have a new definition of
electric mobility device that's
going to put those faster sort
of unclassified electric
bicycles as you will they're now
going to be subject to
registration and licensing.
And without this fix it within
confusing to and the data what
to do with the I do want to add
one other point.
All of these machines are
completely unregulated in New
Mexico you only have one
reference in the motor vehicle
code that says all electric
bicycles are bicycles including
those that can go thirty forty
fifty miles an hour.
With petals.
So that's why this law is
needed.
Thank you.
okay so we have the miscibility
manager expert and we have one
register opponent press function
moto by zoom the trash motor you
so with this.
Staffing
Yes Sir Mr Hashimoto you are
shown to have registered in
opposition to Senate bill sixty
nine all recognized for two
minutes or.
Thank you Mr chairman and
committee members I am fresh
modem a decision for almost
fifty years in New Mexico and a
professor of medicine.
All classes of the box mortar.
Which are more dangerous than
traditional bicycles given to
you by automatic access to all
bicycle trails including wanting
us to pass what law to feel
involved in the bike trails.
in the state should not be that
the full.
Recent studies have shown that
not only is more likely than
traditional bicycles to have
accidents in to present to the
room the accidents that occur
are significantly more severe
including to the head yes at the
men and hello hospitalizations
are more likely to particularly
and all the writers.
These are not surprising as the
bikes are harder to control than
bicycles we are heavier class to
by up to sixty five pounds in
class by go faster plus one up
to twenty miles an hour with a
flick of the wrist on the
throughout this increased
momentum.
Decrease control pose increased
dangers to writers and other
such a pedestrian bicyclist our
wildlife on the trail it makes
no sense because bicycles are
multiplied on recreational trail
this is vehicle another risk NEC
but.
Of twenty miles an hour plus one
to should be allowed to do so.
And this law explicitly allows
you to do so I care about these
health and safety issues because
I'm a physician and I hope you
do too please do not pass is
dangerous law thank you very
much thank you very much for
being with us not.
More questions.
Senator Senator Ivey Soto.
So chairman and
Why is this a substitute what
did you change and so perhaps
this
I see mobile was talking about
the.
Thank you Mr chairman Senator
Stewart in the original bill we
just left it we only classified
the one twos and threes that
conform to the manufacturing
standards we didn't address at
all.
The other types of technically
electric assisted bicycles and
I've got one at one thousand one
Motors they've got throttles
they can go over thirty forty
miles an hour but because they
have paddles.
They're just kind of in limbo so
the I'm a lobbyist for the
people for bikes coalition
they're the ones that are
managing all of the state laws
trying to keep them uniformed so
this is close to you a uniform
standard law that we're seeing
in other states but we've got
this this category of machine
that has battles on it and
powerful motors and it looks
like an electric assisted
bicycle but it's not.
And and madam chair it's just on
page five eight one through five
think the what's the change
thank you for calling them Mr
chairman elector Camilla bility
to by that name come from that.
Tickets somebody with a Walker
that's had a little kids with
electricity.
Mr Chairman service to that
definition came for the people
for bikes coalition it can be a
two or three wheel vehicle with
electric motor for propulsion
that does not meet the
definition in this bill of
electric assisted bicycle and it
is capable of exceeding twenty
miles per hour on just motor
power alone without pedaling so
class two electric assisted
bikes.
The motor disengages at twenty
miles per hour a class to gonna
have a throttle the class one
and class two cannot go over
twenty miles an hour the motor
stopped unless you pedal and go
faster so.
Right twenty eight if you handle
it has no throng so we're
talking about here this electric
mobility devices look like
bicycles but they also the
throttle and they'll push you
way over twenty to thirty to
forty miles an hour with the
throttle but they've got title
so they look like a bike so this
is this is why we're creating
this do not definition of those
types of machines because it
does need to be licensed and
treated like motorized vehicles
okay I get it now so we're in
here do you regulate these
electric mobility device
we do not it would be.
Well yes it would be part of the
right here state seven you see
section three definitions as
used in the motor vehicle code.
If you and you've got on page
eight mopeds motorcycles motor
vehicles you go to page nine and
there it is including now an
electric mobility device has to
be licensed like a motor vehicle
like a motor motorcycle but does
not.
Licensed that's in section three
those are all the things that
need to be licensed but we do
say you don't need a license and
electric assisted bicycles.
Good move forward I've that
so we'll we'll be coming back
and doing more in the future if
you listen to that position I Mr
chairman Senator Stewart the
technology is changing there's
no question that people are
customizing these things.
Well it is this is why we need
the bill because they're totally
unregulated now so he may be
right about class three bikes.
Thank thank you in center of the
students are doing.
I am very much so I'm just
trying to understand.
That everyone in the class
three.
By throttle.
Mister chairman Senator Ivey
Soto a class three E. bike is
pedal assist only it's just like
class one class one E. bike is
pedal assist the motor
disengages at twenty miles an
hour but you can handle it
faster.
No class one is is up to twenty
miles like that all right a
class three E. bike is like a
class one only the motor stays
engaged up to twenty eight miles
an hour while you're paddling.
So it goes the motor can propel
you faster with pedal assistance
up to twenty eight unlike a
class one the motor disengages
at twenty class three the motor
disengages at twenty eight miles
an hour while you're pedaling it
has no throttle like a class one
class one class three a No
throttles pedal assist only.
But but the motor will continue
to help you paddling at twenty
up to twenty eight miles per
hour for class three the
diversity class three and and
and and the most mobile mobile
device is that this is a
completely on regulating
category these things seem have
throttles and propel you passed
faster than twenty miles per
hour without battling.
These are these are national
standards these bikes you can
buy in Santa Fe right now come
with the sticker one two or
three and it is exactly these
these the standard definition
that determines what that
electric light kiss.
Mr Chairman.
Funds are just.
I just want to make sure that
there's not overlap.
Not a lot faster.
Twenty miles per hour and
alleged mobility provides exited
twenty miles there Mister
chairman Senator yes there is
there is no overlap because
electric because class threes do
not have a.
An electric mobility by.
Is capable of exceeding a speed
of twenty miles per hour.
On a motor power loan without
you paddling it.
Class three E. bike can not do
motor power alone it does not
have the throttle you have to
paddle it.
That's why there's no overlap.
And that class was pointed out
to us in the tax and we felt
like we should.
Address it.
At center is also worth then
well take all whole on that
motion but there's a motion by
Senator could you pass Center
were thank you Mr chairman of
the this is an issue that I had
some of our from out in the tax
committee if I page fifteen
because basically what we're
doing in this bill is putting
off class wanted to by on every
single bike path in a local
government unless they opt out.
And and then we say with class
three.
They don't ride classroom last
the local government often in
and I want to understand what's
the difference between a two
three because quite frankly a
class too by the way I read the
definition with a motor that
provides assistance regardless
of whether the riders.
So you can go twenty miles an
hour just by getting on the bike
I mean it doesn't have a is that
enough Raul but it just goes to
twenty miles an hour and I guess
my concern is just.
You know we're putting all these
by and I had the same issue four
years wearing your City of Santa
Fe lobbying half I do think that
I know I've heard from some
constituents that are concerned
about having all these electric
bikes all of a sudden you got
some because because if this is
going to put a whole bunch of
bikes in places that they
currently don't go because all
of a sudden you've got a I think
Malcolm go with electric motor
on the path so maybe Center
doing got from happen I did this
is been an issue that I'm
concerned about in terms of what
we're doing with the local
government loans was and sent
Wirth has the Florida question
you made a comment of question
or you want to be able to so I
guess I I let me go Sanchez
fairness Amigos sponsor and it
just what because why wouldn't
we I mean why wouldn't we on
page fifteen say a person may
write a class one by under day
but then be would be a person to
not write a class two or three
weeks but yeah that's what I
want to why wouldn't we do that
Mister chairman Senator Wirth
it's because class one and class
two.
The motors provide assistance
both class one and class two the
motor provides assistance up to
twenty miles an hour and then it
disengages.
Class one that motors providing
power while you're pedaling at.
Class two it's providing motor a
power while you're pedaling up
to twenty miles per hour the
class to also just the throttle
that disengages wanted to be a
live.
The definition of page forces a
class to provide assistance
regardless of whether the riders
pedaling that's what I just said
I'll choose the latter was
peddling lies to that's what I'm
trying to understand it
both okay but Mr chair that off
here Senator is an employment
business chair my point is that
a can I get on a class two bike
and not peddling go twenty miles
an hour Mr chairman senator
Wirth yes you can vote so that
so what what's the difference
but why would that's a class
three as well Mr chair correct
Mr chairman senator Wirth that
is not correct a class three
bicycle is a pedal assist only
there's only one class that has
a throttle it's too but class
one and class two the motors
provide assistance up to twenty
miles an hour and they stop.
Okay that's the key now some
people.
The chair for the point of the
class to it's got the wrong all
that goes up to twenty miles an
hour so I don't have.
Mister chairman Senator Stewart
that is correct so I guess
that's my concern.
That is me that to me is a
different it feels to me like
that that's more similar to a
class three I mean that's a
different kind of thing you're
putting this on every path and
forcing all local governments to
come in and say we don't want to
there so now we've got versus
what you did request three is on
the local government come in and
say you know what those are.
Am I getting that wrong the Mr
chair because you because you
race that Senator in tax it
turns out that the department of
interior due to study these
bicycles and looked the and they
allow them for a period of time
and then they evaluated the
results what they found is class
one and class two did not have a
detrimental impact on the trails
anymore than a bicycle did but
they found the class three
because of the height and speed
provided of the state board of a
safety hazard and and
potentially have more impact on
the trails and I have it here it
was published in the Federal
Register and so that helped me
understand because I I as I said
last time one of the things
we're seeking is is parity with
our other states because of we
want people to come to New
Mexico with their elector bikes
and right to lecture by and and
do that so we want to be exactly
the same for that we're on the
subject so you haven't Mr and
this this is this is a policy
question is not a legal question
I mean every out the policy
question about you know should
we have bikes that a lot of they
go on every single bike have
been forced to local governments
to come in and and say no I
don't want to do that for you
just say the local governments
come in is a yes we want to do
that I don't know I just this is
cost me more for about fifteen
bills etcetera do and then I
think we know what we're gonna
do tonight so Senator this favor
if I say it as a vendor in this
bill I've been texting with my
ex husband who is an avid
by supplier those asking him
when you how often do you think
you go twenty miles an hour all
the time.
I frequently are on flax and and
and far more going on here.
I said how often are you going
twenty eight miles of that
hahaha almost never only at
intervals so I think that to the
extent that the class to
regardless of the throttle to
the extent the class was capped
at twenty miles per hour.
That's really other than.
Whether we care about people
peddling or not it's not going
to be a vastly different
experience of bicycles on that
path that we have now because we
have people going twenty miles
an hour on this have snack
so that's that's my only so just
Mr chair I could the difference
though is that he should not go
up hill.
That to act you have a fraught
with that allows you to go up
hill which puts a whole group of
bikes in places that are not
currently that's that's my
that's my that's my.
I would strongly motion.
Right.
Any action of a partial
Committee tonight this seems to
it seems to me Mr chairman that
we have to deal with this issue
affects their work product and
that this bill doesn't do that
it seems to me it we should we
should regulate and pull out the
three and of course the mobility
by which you already have it
just seems like this is going to
much.
Quickly for all three of them to
be able to be used everywhere
so.
I just think it needs more work
in those last few pages when you
decide where they're going to be
able to go then it's great that
there's there's a definitions
that you pulled out this
electric mobility devices and I
hate that name
but you haven't dealt with the
issues that senator Wirth is
brought if you could change the
last two pages to do that you
might have a bill.
All right so.
Ferrary so the better we of
course.
Our our forces but I've a very
quick amendment for us to have a
this bill
page fourteen Nibert.
Right north American free trade
and sort of the United States
Mexico Canada with ashes of
between.
It says what.
All right we're off
subjects and topics were at
tonight this bill is going to be
rolled over we're gonna we're
gonna looking more closely I
think the consensus committee is
that we want to have the
definitions we have regulation I
I've shared concern expressed
initially my center with and
centering Stuart.
Of the implications of of making
this an opt out and allowing
these on bike paths because me
quite a bit concerned we a lot
of us we work hard with these
beautiful White House in our
communities and all that start
button motorized of whatever we
want to call plus one plus two
plus three four thousand by
twenty to twenty miles an hour.
I think it's a different
experience so we'll we'll we'll
make this the first up there
