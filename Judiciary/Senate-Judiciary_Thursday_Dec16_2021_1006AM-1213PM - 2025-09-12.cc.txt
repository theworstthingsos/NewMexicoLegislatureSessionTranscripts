Thank.
I all right I guess I would.
Where we.
Can I just hang there for money
I.
I got one more we've got or
anything that you can choose.
The.
You know that.
Some kind of problem.
Why would you go.
Really.
It is.
The.
I have that.
There are.
Yes one two three yes.
That.
At.
I don't know.
That.
I I.
Yeah.
Here.
That there.
Yeah I.
Of.
Hello.
Perfects are.
Okay great okay we can put them
on this chair yes.
Thank you.
I seem to have lost everybody.
It thanks for the.
I did leveraged consolation
right here shortly so.
Yeah.
What effect your microphones
again for number on.
Senator do it so you with or two
other proposals and.
Right right up to four.
The the committee there's that
now has a floating around to
amendment.
One of the five seven point five
one of.
You're referring to an amendment
by of.
On.
For more.
and.
In.
All of.
So that.
I I the.
To.
Mr chair I've just given
information that they're they
can't hear you.
I know that.
Does your mind that it is.
Recovery for a lot of.
You're in the room.
Mr chair currently that I'm
being heard.
But they cannot hear.
Yes.
Comment yeah.
Our folks able to now.
There.
Yes.
All right so that the.
Remember that I proposing is on
page three sections J. second
line after of his license thirty
four certified by the state.
And running.
Or.
Hi this would make this
definition consists with the
language in the other the.
Licensing by the state.
It gives us the flexibility to
ensure that all of the options
that the.
Full to to really.
Where where people can get
really for this thing mark
without eliminating the ability
appropriately narrow
regulations.
Folks that are under the current
definition already in their life
health care.
On.
Public health.
Sarah I would move that
amendment your amendment.
H. three subsection J..
I.
or certified by the state.
Officials.
realize we don't have.
All and you.
I I I I I find that amendment
and family and friends.
All right.
Sure well I I think that my
misled the prior explained in
detail why it's and family.
Senator serve on this and
Senator.
the.
Well first let me just say that
this ammendment the entire not
this amendment this amendment
but Senator services amendment
captures a lot of things that
are just completely outside of
the margins that hospitals trial
lawyers patients and doctors
right and I am here to tell you
that I will every single answer
will be that's not part of the
deal and I'm going to stand by
my my representation to all of
this party in addition I am
concerned that adding more
facilities is not what we want
to do with the intent of this
agreement we really want to
capture a
particular refer facilities that
I think that the licensing part
of the the Department of Health
it's going to be able to capture
and.
Diversified certainly understand
Senators what we're trying to do
here
it
but I think that the parties to
this original agreement.
Or or not of.
Maybe that would leave you the.
Yeah I I.
The state more clearly Mr
chairman Senator Duhigg I I
think it will be very
problematic were already trying
to deal with the definition of
outpatient health care facility
that is too expansive.
By tying it only too well but I
need to get the way you propose
we will expand the definition
even further.
And I I believe that under the
act eighty you know if this
amendments were accepted.
Any of those facilities licensed
or certified by the state would
be entitled to qualify for the.
Under forty one five three the
definition of health care
provider include outpatient
health care facilities if we
expand the definition of
outpatient health care
facilities under forty one I I
any of those.
Outpatient health care
facilities could qualify under
the act if they chose to use a.
Which could lead to a tremendous
number of entities coming out of
the
that that have not been on
authorities based on prior
discussions with the outside
could be problematic to bring in
such a wide variety of
individuals and they would be
brought in under the higher pass
which is the most problem.
Or.
Here's.
We are.
It is.
Right now.
The.
Rating.
I.
Health care providers.
I understand.
There is.
There any other licensing.
Yeah I I think with if the
language was just license or for
I by the state that could be it.
Interpreted to include any
number of the you know what
without defining what type of
license or certification you're
talking about.
It could include any type of
license issued by the state.
but that that's my concern this
is a life.
Be a license that doesn't.
A.
And.
Yeah.
What it is.
This.
Try to go.
Right or or.
All of the other.
Very good point.
but I do have the same concerns
that
Religious.
Vote in their.
We we do we have to read between
the lines third floor of all
right other discussions.
So
Representative.
Thanks to something that was
important.
And I'd like to right.
Which is.
Thank you for the fifty fifty
definition problematic.
All right.
I I do want to.
Temple I remarked.
We were told.
I said we could not.
At all.
We didn't do so it's also a lot
of problems.
Seven.
That.
Reflective of.
They can to do our best the
rules.
Will you an implausible trading
all of the things that figures
is.
let me try to fix.
Really really.
Or whether in particular that's
really weird the vote.
Definitions and.
Representative recently as is
the.
The provision.
Existing definition them
because.
Six of the challenges that the
group has given us a little.
Limited in.
There is concern that that's
involved things about those
without the.
What I want to resolve the.
For the moment.
For the the consequences the
implications of this are
program.
Which is.
Capturing all kinds of.
After of the two I was to
capture in terms of of about
vision the lady but.
We were that we don't have that
infants were in statute.
I strongly reject the notion.
I appreciate with loads with
them the statement.
The big easy but we're gonna
reject all amendment.
Right before that we think that
deal was.
And the the idea with all
respect we're going to weigh on
the fourth fifty five for for
the rest of their election.
Application.
I don't see a reason why we are
making a lot.
Medical practice.
And if they will be here and I
have to tell you my experience
like you litigated cases with a
lot of course are going through
the appellate process.
Six seven years.
A lot of people that.
All well we're waiting of course
four.
That would because we don't want
to write the laws clearly.
Revert.
Usually in the Representative
the.
Right.
I I for your equipment but when
the process is open to better of
us federally for the regular I
really wish
that you and.
Total TV I would be giving gives
us.
Over.
Got a better definition one that
will capture the people you want
to.
Then it was that definition.
All the all your.
The implications of this are
huge.
But facilities are going to be
after four million dollars when
will the fact that we're really
goes goes off right those of six
million dollars.
The price index by twenty twenty
seven.
This eventually gets a six
million dollars who is going to
be staff at six million dollars
and who isn't.
The end of the act is that what
you're the loop all of all these
are implicated by this
definition.
Going to do a better.
But I also during the concern.
There may be a better.
The.
I hope.
Of of money.
But on that.
That.
We.
The.
Of.
That is.
Problem.
Off of a.
Well if.
The this is a problem this.
I also want.
That we are here.
There is.
That either.
Twenty two we.
The fact that.
As of.
I do think.
All.
For those.
A lot.
I.
And.
Two one notice.
Notice.
Little.
That.
Bill and understanding.
What else.
This.
Yeah.
Do you agree with.
Is that at appropriations.
Really.
I just.
License.
For.
Thank.
Lessons of the past and public.
Budget.
The ability.
We love.
providers.
And.
I've.
One of the.
Words have.
I.
by the way.
So if the.
But nonetheless it is get up
and.
so so in that regard I mean.
That.
The.
I also recognize.
All.
That.
This is the area.
To find as the water goes
through permanent.
I.
Terms of.
And and and where.
Or
What.
I think.
I have a lot of.
Under the definition of.
Of the.
Revenues.
The enrollment of.
Rustled appreciate.
To the right.
All the work.
A lot of the affection the
really.
First two subsections of the a
HBO underlying but that's it.
On subsection the definition we.
We we
last night.
I and therefore we
Representative that often those
of the.
Five years over.
The last two the importance of
an agreement for employees and
local that.
Agencies are we put that back
in.
Right that.
Of the.
It
Ivey Soto point.
I would agree with the following
the folder.
Our food by the.
So in the event that they can
live comments.
Or.
The program
the.
I.
But once again we do ambiguity.
Of of agency nurses and.
I.
In.
The food.
Movie that's the other we try to
do with the program.
We also.
We'll do.
Representative through the
hospital.
To.
And the and then.
If we go with the program I
this food but also.
That's going to.
What about hospital.
The litigated.
For them to move.
You will.
To.
Thirty four.
The third.
But then.
Then I what it is about fifty.
Our.
Our.
For
though in the.
Independent providers important
that really is what we take all.
Representative worth of.
Of the.
There.
What is important.
Try to think of.
I.
Reducing your is is somebody.
We will also work with.
Probably not.
Yeah.
People happen.
Only we offer.
Very few employees.
All.
The mid point Dr.
Often are.
The boys also for the for the
legislative.
We yes the.
All of those Dr.
I.
What will be the we have a long
the release of.
All.
Contract provided.
This but without the use.
Liability for the.
Mr Chairman and forgive me if I
seem to be eligible to speak up
so from being too well let me
know
Our.
I.
that the thought on that in in.
So it's not our believe that
hospitals will will exploit that
loophole you highlighted Mr
chairman because if under
specifically under Hoffman B.
grant which the nineteen ninety
five four yield K. one nineteen
New Mexico four point.
the court in that case made it
clear that if someone is deemed
to be an agent of a hospital
even if they are an employee the
hospital will be responsible for
damages caused by that agent
under respondents of your the
reliability following up and
You J. I. thirteen dash one
twelve zero fee with that office
which would reiterate that and
makes it clear that if someone.
Is an agent of a hospital and
it's determined that they
committed malpractice the
hospitals on the for the damages
that was all.
so that is our thought process
Mr chair on the independent
provider to.
The act.
Yes this is a very narrow case
hello.
I would not made every.
That.
I.
And I and I appreciate.
That your position is the
hospital whenever.
But I gotta tell you.
I agree.
Remember what.
Or for.
I.
One hundred.
That.
By.
Only few people from.
And Mr Chairman to the position
we were in is that when you have
independent contractor languages
provider for the agency language
which has been removed is.
those individuals simply cannot
get into so they will stop
providing for.
And we do the right.
We all agree with that that's
not.
Center I'm so you just going to
go through this.
Not very satisfied.
I have a lot of.
There's a lot of discussion and
presentations of well here's our
five years I believe here's our.
But.
Three that.
The.
In any event that's the.
Definition of independent
provided I think still for.
We we talk to the.
To expose the minimum.
J..
The definition of operation
facilities should probably go
back up of that.
For this.
To.
Earlier statement this.
For.
That's right they would they
would prefer not to change it
for.
What it last night.
Representative definition.
Working.
All
right.
The suggestion I will yeah that.
For
all the.
Yeah.
Section two.
It is an effort to try to
verify.
That are.
That is not there the I.
For.
Rates
really.
But possible.
I
We're.
Really with.
I don't believe.
Or
otherwise.
And the.
Subsection three deals
free.
For.
Act.
And then and then really
something that I hope.
Because as I said earlier.
What this bill really does to me
far more I protected.
Two point.
This really build really does is
give the past this bill is on
the staff.
Bill we passed back in March six
officers really from seven
hundred fifty thousand dollars
and twenty two four and a half
million dollars.
That was the deal.
It was amazing ideas are
basically we have a deal we have
the deal off the table.
Thanks to it but then we're
being told not will.
Something the forty one.
Increase from seven hundred
fifty thousand dollars for that
the backlog that exists right
now we did nothing else that's
what would happen this bill as
it comes out that out here.
Not backed up in the morning.
I think.
That's right.
Notification that the place of
the phone.
With the.
For the concession or one.
I also share the concern that I
think we've already expressed in
particular there's a lot of
folks are going to start to do
that negotiations.
Last year beginning of.
We agree to the staff.
Live up to that and I
understand.
That simple standard insurance
but I haven't heard that
operation.
Anybody can say we try to get
four million dollars for this.
That.
We should not protect patients.
And families of the bill.
For another two and a half.
Understand on top of specific
out patient about.
The way beyond that then to
find.
All for the Mr.
Sorry Mr chairman
there is a need to an insurance
prices with the outpatient
health care facilities they can
not.
Get four million dollars worth
of insurance we work with
outside of we work with the
facilities we've had discussions
and discussions with interest
there is no insurance New Mexico
that will write the four million
dollar policy for these
independently owned outpatient
healthcare.
and and so that is why we're
here today to address that
prices because we do not and if
they're still subject to the
four million dollar cap from
twenty twenty two or twenty
twenty three
the crisis is going to be there
and and it's really to full
first those outpatient health
care facilities will have to
shut down come January one which
will leave a lot of folks
without very important health
care we heard from the southwest
Gastroenterol edgy which is a
major
health care facility here in the
state to provide the huge amount
of services they will no longer
be able they will close their
doors on January.
If the cap is nine
Representative yes.
Read about it but the thing that
and.
The revision down to.
The cap for this food doesn't go
up until twenty three for.
Through the frontier of
existing.
Thank you.
Because it goes up to four
million dollars this year.
As it is exist yes under forty
on five six see it would
increase the four million.
January.
As possible so if I.
Yeah.
The the proposal from house
bill.
Seven.
The questions that food
initially perspective twenty.
Yeah.
Both within the house revise
that which is.
Yes correct.
So so.
But we I.
Better the when you're saying
that they can't get four million
dollars of interest why push out
at all if they can't get
insurance today why everything
that I did for.
Well thank you for my nose which
was not where they can be able
to for me.
The the prices of rose because
it really came to their
attention in late November early
December that they could not get
that insurance so what we've
agreed and I'm not obviously I
I've recognize what you've done
Mr chairman regarding Freeman
but what the parties have
discussed this is giving me that
time to try and figure out why
they can obtain the four million
dollars and if in fact they can
knock obtained four million
dollars then having a sixty day
session and twenty twenty three
to address the issue
that would exist at that.
And I don't read the.
Our.
Review carefully but after
respect we district it's not
that they can get in for.
As if that if that's something
they can do different things but
you go out to your to your.
what they can't they can't get
insurance and I.
A better way to say it of it or
the for the at least right now I
don't really get that insurance
I am here.
And the up vote being cleared
you know if you were just asked
to point this out here to for
the tech interested I think it
in future we're just gonna keep
going.
We've got every year will come
in the session what we do know
the.
Thank you Mr.
Why I have the what why did what
we can negotiate a higher fat.
The argument but we have to go
should we read find perfection.
More forward you
one of them for you all brought.
The coach's hired after all
anybody have fifty I would be
very different.
You know when we save the folks
you gotta carry mandatory auto
insurance.
Well.
For that.
Questions okay.
Well about.
The merger.
and I'm not.
I'm I haven't yet heard yeah.
The finance me that there was a
good faith effort between when
the fall with that February
March and maybe increases.
That somebody went to work and
try to get better for.
The last but everything.
Yeah it's a crisis but it may be
a self made by by people who
don't want.
Mr chair dressed one other issue
at first of all I want to be
very clear that initially the
the cap until this law went into
our goes into effect has been
six hundred thousand dollars for
these facilities the cap will go
up to seven hundred fifty
thousand even with the amendment
that we're asking for and I
think I think what we're going
to find out and I'm no insurance
experts in this is speculation
but I do think that what we're
going to find out is during the
year that we're attempting to
buy some time to sort through
these issues I think we're going
to find that the insurance
companies just haven't had
sufficient time.
To do an adequate risk
assessment on what really is a
new market for a much higher
tax.
They have previously always
insured these businesses at the
lower cap of six hundred
thousand and they haven't had to
do a full assessment because of
that loop have they now have to
do a different kind of risk
assessment
for a four million dollar cap
and I think that with by the
time the the rates were set by
the superintendent of insurance
he did it in a timely manner
it's not the suggestion that he
was like but by the time that
deadline to submit those right
around October thirty first
there was only two months for
the bill the legal department of
these insurance companies an
actuary departments to do their
full risk assessment it is my
hope.
Without first being an expert on
insurance issues that they're
going to over the next year find
the time to be able to do
adequate risk assessments and
that we we have there's
insurance for just about
anything in right and so so I
think that they will find that
is it's going to sort itself out
and that's everyone's hope here.
We've got to have the sixty day
session to come back and address
it if we find out that there's
some other issue that we just
don't know about.
He
a good actors and the order.
Representative twenty right the
group very strong.
By reference.
The issue here is not whether
there's not insurance issues
they want to pay for the.
Really what it comes.
I have no doubt that.
You may have to buy reinsurance
that are with the.
Negative I I could think for FY
I maybe maybe possible I.
I gotta tell you.
Being.
Really.
I.
I.
And I appreciate what you're
saying which is the other needs
more time to do the assessment
of risk for that's going to be
through.
Where
we're gonna be no.
What.
Anyway I I really think we from.
I would ask you all to consider
I don't think we need another
two years.
I appreciate the thinking that
when we go away for the.
So.
I believe the next thirty to.
The other thing for parties for
interest.
This.
For that.
Very well done.
The.
Redistricting.
With the with the immediate
crisis.
And maybe even after.
Of the dress that.
A year.
To.
hello.
Of the more than four.
Representative.
I do believe that.
Hospital this.
All.
But the other thing is.
For.
Your phone.
The.
I.
That.
For.
All.
You have a.
Thank.
Is that more updated.
There are.
They are not in.
the.
Would be Representative I.
I.
About for food with it the.
Order.
The federal.
The of may there is a I'd like
to address your observation.
Of the but.
There is being added or.
Of course.
You're right in this case I.
Yeah House Bill Levin and and
for more because.
Look at the.
I imagine this is this is.
Language to address in the house
bill but to but to be
the goal here from the
conversation yesterday with the
slide of is over with the
capture operation facilities.
Some circumstances and knocked
out further out.
Both after what one goal is to.
Oct excuse this these that our
phone by hospital.
Individual winners as you had to
be flown by the house majority
owned and controlled we have to
prove both.
To be.
And that's impossible it's going
to be impossible.
Exception.
So you're you're you're but
we've waited the phone number
being of vertigo.
Do you anticipate forty nine
forty nine percent.
The other fifty one percent of
our your for other smaller.
Preparation for entities would
have no control because
Though they might have a good
life.
Both.
Available that exception so
that's why I train for both
things were the major phone
working full because of captured
here either thirty four year
control off of the new don't
meet that.
I think that borders brooded.
I am make
an exception to the rule that.
So I want to take a moment to
read that off.
By sometimes.
Your workers to.
The staff.
What we try to do.
I.
I regret that I waited for that.
For the.
I
would choose.
But to control what I.
Right.
One of the Hey.
As part of.
I.
From the allies.
Of the.
Thirty.
Yeah.
I.
I.
The.
It is not.
I.
hospital one.
I.
I are based.
For
for for.
I know that.
Hospital.
What is an operation of your.
I know what this.
I do next the one project.
So if it's not.
Operation of their facilities.
That is less.
As it up as an outpatient.
Representative.
None of those of those
qualifiers apply to the one.
Because you say it does not that
does not include this.
None of those apply to you.
We don't know what an operation
of.
Is on the line.
Thanks for that.
I would like to.
Right.
We don't have.
Representative refers.
We're.
Why don't we just.
I don't have a law degree but I
feel like over coffee.
The
sold in either means more
directed by.
The larger umbrella.
At least in other.
Thirty minutes on it again after
we did our to have on the same
thing yesterday.
Lost.
The.
As a couple in.
How to ensure what common the
full.
That that.
overcome.
I would have been.
I.
The next.
Part of the amendment.
We.
And
This is.
with one exception I will I will
highlight.
this is identical.
What is.
Not a few files a lot of.
So structurally what we did.
with regard to this is that we
have
House bill seventy five.
What does it go back and review
of our parts of the one affect
everyone.
there are two sections of I am
problematic.
Yeah where we are.
What is the definition of work.
View their
or made up and
and then.
Act
then we also have the.
For a little.
All of.
That
In order to make sure that what
we've got to everyone.
To.
Is what we do.
Let me from the back of.
On the back of the bill is
Representative says remember
this is the section forty four
that's the word.
We do diversity loss.
We've got a section for the
impact of the
tax.
Twenty twenty two years out of
date.
That is less than ninety days.
From the date of the of the.
The end of the legislative
session.
That
then then that way you'll have
emergency laws.
And it has to happen members of
over.
By earlier than ninety days what
food back on what what do you
what.
Correct
so if if you were not decided
after that.
Thank.
This is not a law it is a lot
of.
And then section three.
This bill use the that we were
able.
Lost twenty twenty one chapter
sixteen that is code for house
bill seventy five.
Section one of three.
Hello they're not going to
affect.
And so then now we have to
repeal those two sections.
Now we have two sections of the
table.
And so what we do is section
what is the definition.
And the definitions section
here.
It looks like we're doing a lot
we're not actually doing line
looks like it.
This definition section is
exactly definitions section that
was in the house bill seventy
five minus four.
In order to.
Thank you for
what will go into effect
everyone for you.
You don't actually right those
were we end up that we all have
issues.
The the.
Because you can't write
something that is not on.
Thank so so everything that is
actually one.
We've all already voted yes on.
I but we already consider the
last legislative session.
the only difference is is is the
oldest of four agencies or
agents or.
That were.
So that we have adopted going
back on the same day that would
be one I wonder possible seventy
five but it goes into effect
without those.
Section two of this bill.
Then which was actually three of
of seventy five.
It's forty one that I have sex.
Forty one that I have six is
simple one.
I.
It is identical.
Combination house I House Bill a
lot of.
I
so and so I that effort is is
that we're just house bill
eleven.
Use a separate provision.
That actually one of those
temporary.
You guys are actually the.
Act early seven years maybe
longer.
Operable used over.
Have that applicability right
up.
I think if changes are
happening.
Yeah secretary law that has gone
into effect yet what we do is we
just lay it all out.
So that way people visit.
That's all and so we start with
laying out that section six we
also.
Conversation about the bill
graph and I had the way that
house bill seventy five was laid
out it said the exact same thing
the mobile terrible wraps.
Separately.
So as a.
How's that going to have a very
we had a conversation with that
for a bit thank you for this to
be more aware.
Up so what we're doing that is.
Right we're mandate as was
amended in the house bill
seventy five.
Section eight existing language.
so we're verifying this past and
you for medical care
and we're not practicing.
this is.
Right.
A limitation here Representative
definition.
Up in terms of how we're
proceeding after January one
twenty.
so work with a guest healthcare
providers.
Which was the full term private
health.
Prior to the general one twenty
four.
So we do the that that'll be
moderate without limitation
I.
As was done in all seventy five
members of the committee and
then.
We provide them in fact there.
Of the language that was
impossible seventy five.
Of which raises the six hundred
fifty seven hundred fifty and
then applies that those are
present.
And some of those sensitive.
That is sections.
The is the
right balance in the apparel
section.
Read about in the.
that is correct for population
health care facility that is not
good for development in the
past.
So those are the amounts that
apply to the lower on this jobs
this is not
very own why hospital not
usually make the one saying.
One changes that in the house
bill eleven.
The.
The lower amounts ended July
one.
Yes I have yeah of twenty twenty
right now the house floor that
was a lot of one hundred twenty
four we just stayed with.
Leader.
And so the the limitations go up
and calendar year twenty twenty
four.
Well and the the amendment on
the floor.
This explains the fact that
expense but if you gallery here
which is the norm.
and and of course and the.
On the side here.
Is whether our decisions are a
session give us the opportunity
to it is that.
As this is written.
The sixty day session the
general one twenty four for a
lot less than to visit this year
three days after.
For in the sixty day session
twenty three.
and then and then that would be
what it is I've whatever will
make the right setting past
place prior to.
General.
Representative Lente the exact
eight months
usually seventy five.
Then the this is for a hospital
or outpatient healthcare
facilities that is a major one a
lot of the verified and which is
healthy Representative.
More for the same definition we
clarify which one's going to
with that.
We see the that was the way the
only difference.
We were reverted.
And those discussions we have
all is that the language for
administrative work that's
better for.
Y. as in the introductory
language the.
Have the parties.
All when they look at is that
you'll be here for us.
So that people with this on the
basis of all the data for us and
we were that is the one two
three four five six.
The restricted Act related with
the the and you see the movie
that according of your.
The air date versus to the that.
And up and then.
We have of the language that's
that's already provided.
and
House bill seventy five about
their good dollar amounts.
Payments person remember last
night rather pay for wrestling.
That patient that's language
that again set up incentive for
paragraphs here in one place I.
And also interim basis very
I mean these are doing what the
limitations are in the section.
And house bill seventy five that
was that.
At a different time.
I here we have a one time in
levels.
Also it's a little bit later.
That we have the rest of that is
up some at language.
Provided for Google I.
and then we got.
Thank all of the.
As there
session hi.
Right
seventy five of that date right
I.
And that is a.
I will note that inferences
line.
Find.
That is a member of.
Problem.
That is.
The definition of a substantive
application of.
In.
In this section.
But it does not open the
definition of the product you
also where with this stuff.
That.
And that was on the job.
it's all of that so that's what
this does.
it is and like I said of the six
months.
It is up to the identical to
what was amended.
Hello.
And then I would.
Sanchez thanks for.
A lot of
time on that.
Thank you Mr chair like to refer
to my.
My within the first.
Thank you Mr chair and Senator
Ivey Soto as you know.
The good part of last thing this
morning reviewing.
and it's gone through a couple
of versions of your app and
we're quite satisfied that this
captures what it is that we're
trying to do we appreciate you
working the directors to do it
in a way that is going to be
sort of maintain the integrity
of the amendment this doesn't go
through so we would
we're we're pleased with this
and I think that all the parties
involved for please with
including hospitals medical
society patients trial lawyers I
do want to make.
Just ask one question if I may
and as I understand it from the
beginning you're saying that.
Where it says that you were
remembering at the very end it's
three number you to include the
emergency clause.
Okay I just wanted to verify
that with that we're we're
satisfied that this accomplices
thirty full of keeping.
These facilities open in
patients with health care in
January.
Mr chair Senator Ivey Soto I do
not have anything that.
Yeah.
Mr chair and then Senator I use
of the your last session I was
one of the eight members that
voted against house bill seventy
five and I did not.
Make a deal yes I was part of
the need to deal making process
I do believe in consensus and I
believe that
that we should be making the
best deal for the citizens of
New Mexico.
So that's one of the reasons
that I wanted to be on this
particular bill today.
And I believe that making sure
that keeping providers working
and making sure we have
healthcare for our citizens is
very important and I think if I
put in this ammendment on and
getting it off the floor is is
providing that so I am very much
in favor of it.
There are all.
So.
That that that.
one.
For.
How do you.
Well the.
To.
Do it the overall.
Unable to.
Your tier serve on this and
Senator Duhigg it I would be
speaking out of place to argue
on behalf of the meeting
reporting companies I think
there are some hospitals we have
a real problem with that.
and you know obviously they're
not here today but
right I would be concerned about
adding language.
Why would that.
Well
chairman and senator doing I
think that by the definition of
hospital we have encompass all
subsidiaries and LLCs holding
companies are completely
different back in the in this is
a corporate law issue but moving
companies basically our
communities through which money
passes they don't have corporate
executives or employees for
anyone who really actually
operates it is set up for
financial transactions and I
think that that is the concern
about the reunion and and you
know believe me as a plaintiff's
lawyer
that might be something that
some day would be great to
include but I think that the
hospitals would have a major
objection.
And I just feel like it and you
know I recognize that this.
Committee do you what it wishes
but my job coming here is to
honor the agreement that we made
with.
The hospital.
And so I feel like I would be
remiss in not mentioning that
problem.
Or.
And.
Or.
Gentleman from Senator doing it
for you I think the answer is
that that would not be in.
To.
They will also.
Yeah Mr chair Senator Duhigg
based on discussions we've had
with reporters and all areas.
The concern regarding the New
Orleans within that is that you
could have a nine forty.
an outpatient health care
facilities forty owned by a
hospital.
But still controlled by the so
in other words you could have an
independent you know provider
owned health page the that is
controlled by the hospital and
it it you know it would not be
able to get.
so that is why we included that
would.
Where that is.
Mr chair Senator Duhigg.
And on the.
That is in that circumstance
but.
There.
Representative Eli.
Practice.
Yes but also.
There.
So if if Mr chair Senator for
all if it is if I understand
your question correctly if it is
majority owned by a hospital but
not controlled by the hospital
the stuff you know it it would
be covered by the law does that
answer your question.
And then if you flip it the
problem is if it's majority
owned by independent independent
providers but controlled by a
hospital those independent
providers would not be able to
get.
And that was the concert.
I.
Mr chair Senator for building
not the whole if the hospital is
not a major owner of would not
be able.
Or
or.
Mr chair Senator Pirtle in that
circumstance of it was with
major via hospital but not
control if it if we had it for
at their then you know it would
be subject to the higher cap.
Questions when they have all
the.
Saying part of the hospital.
Ruled by the hospital why would
they have.
Policy.
Number.
Part of that.
Mr chair Senator for all of
understand that the question
correctly if it is majority
owned it would be one policy
that was held by the fall.
Or.
Representative my mind around it
is under the definition this is
really.
Also why would it.
Why would the.
Mr chair Senator Pirtle so if
it's in for a what what you're
asking is if it's an ordinance
in full by hospitals and why
wouldn't they just be able to go
out of the hospital.
that's a valid question and that
might very well.
I'm sorry Mr chairman.
That's kind of a Representative.
Yeah that's what they call.
For the record on.
Other.
The IRS would save the state.
So if that's the case why can.
All the.
Four million dollar falls.
One four million dollars.
Treated as part of the house.
Yeah and is Mr chair Senator
Pirtle the concern and and maybe
to your point is not a valid
concern with the the concern was
that.
If it was my majority owned by
independent positions open full
by the hospital they would not
be able to get a policy but I I
hear your concerns in the same
might very well be.
And on the way I read it.
That would be awesome.
I'm sorry Mr chair Senator
fertilizer.
Yeah please Senator for.
I think.
So.
All.
It's a very important.
This.
The.
The the Mister chair if if if it
is a commonly controlled.
Why would they have.
Policy definition for.
All have the same rector.
Outpatient facility.
At the
same hospital why would they
have.
Mr chair Senator for all I do
not believe they would need to
Senator.
Mr chair Senator Ivy Soto the
concern from from the lawyers
that represent the south
patients is that there could be
a circumstance where something
of the Giorgio by independent
providers but controlled by all.
And as I ended I indicated to
Senator Duhigg I do not I I
can't identify that in four five
seven million.
That.
That is for a moment while.
What we have.
That's correct what happened was
ordeal by office.
Forty of us are off.
Mr chair Senator Ivey Soto.
I agree.
So.
So.
I mean.
I.
The.
That.
Ortiz all.
Property.
Mr chair Senator Ivy Soto
That very well could address the
concerns.
Back in the same situation the
record.
Now we've established that.
We're told by the fall under
relevant already.
All.
All.
I.
Is for your.
After twelve years.
I think.
Most of the
work yes.
Yeah we're for.
As of this writing.
Well I.
After twenty getting general.
And.
For.
Are.
Mr chair Senator we're okay with
that.
Exactly thank.
That would be in two places.
To be in
line with the.
Right.
The description.
At the front of of the.
What is the the.
Very easy or.
Purpose.
Representative after this.
But not.
Your.
So awesome.
If you just take the control by
as I said earlier you to.
Make sure the ownership of.
We go to different ownership.
All of the stuff.
I really should be operated
really.
For.
At the.
This makes it easier for.
Sections of the property.
Representative.
That.
The
idea that.
But the the the.
There we go to the wanted time
Representative.
I
really want to hear from.
We have we have the.
The.
Sure I just wanted us.
I'll be happy.
Or.
Forward.
Russian.
Would you mind repeating it.
I.
For.
Of the.
The.
The last line.
German or Representative a.
In
order to connect them we did
revert yes.
Mr chairman it is and friendly
amendment.
And really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Rubin the former's.
The
president.
Right.
All.
I want to.
Everybody.
All.
That is.
That.
You may Hey.
The.
Or.
And they're not.
About.
Right.
Of.
Problem
Representative will refuse with
the adoption of your.
Remember this.
That happen here yeah yeah.
After.
Have the.
all right so your available.
The the bill that was passed.
Really requires a lot of work
for funding.
To do the fixes the.
Our.
Really.
There's a lot of the.
I look at the.
So.
We're gonna tell you.
The that we're going to see is
just your.
Yes really even if you look at
the definition.
The
first.
Changes.
This look for many members from
and if the government healthcare
providers.
Looked at the defendant I.
You'll see that one is intended
for free the other there is.
Raul and singular.
Large.
Of the.
That.
Most probably to me is that
differences.
That we.
So we.
Current.
These are law.
For instructions.
But
for.
That's the Max that providing
for.
Yeah.
We
and evidently.
We'll figure that out.
Better to happen.
Of them on.
The state the the never there to
I redefine at the.
For.
The vote the vote.
The.
This.
Ordered.
Right.
Six thank you for they will.
The.
Not to just to get out of here.
Right
are two years.
Want to emphasize the fact that
the popular but that the capsule
Division providers with the.
That.
About.
Thank you very few.
So you know there's some
suggestion while we we.
From six hundred to seven
hundred fifty thousand dollars
from.
All the way to.
So so somebody suggested that.
The other the other thing is I I
you know I'm kind of curious
about this.
The concern here is for that
individual providers suffer
because they would be subject to
liability.
After.
But the but the only requirement
on providers is fighting for.
We did we face their.
For.
That's the only.
There's nothing in the.
You are.
Maybe Mr Abbas.
Our reserves.
Right over there.
In the insured amount.
Representative we're we're today
the right now doctors required
to insure themselves.
Patients often face different.
Right sure enough and.
Chairman that's correct but I do
want to make sure that everyone
understands that four million
dollar cap does not apply to.
Physicians and doctors for for
hospitals and outpatient
facilities the cap for
independent providers is seven
fifty.
Yeah indication come I'm sorry
your of your and the patient
compensation funding only covers
for the hospitals and outpatient
facilities the patient
compensation fund only covers up
to the seven fifty and then
hospitals outpatient facilities
are liable for the overage on
top of that till they're out of
the New York Rangers of of of of
help me.
I know that's where everybody
operates out there but.
Really in the act those with the
word yes the act of.
Off of the different of the.
Physics.
I apologize it is explicit.
In in the in the act.
Yes.
I think there's a good argument
to be made that the fifty five.
For for for everything above
the.
Whatever the.
If you thought I was going we
taken steps and I've not yet had
the case to give me the
opportunity our.
I really want to understand.
Never leave it in the act the.
The ability.
Chairman it's under Hey right
below the J. definition of
occurrence.
until January first two thousand
twenty seven the mail due from a
judgment or settlement against
of hospital or outpatient health
care facilities in excess of
seven hundred fifty thousand
dollars excluding past and
future medical expenses shall be
paid by the hospital or
outpatient health care
facilities and not by the Fund.
That's my.
Yes.
the prior to help.
There
are.
Your knowledge.
Or.
Captive to the six hundred
thousand dollars for every in.
Health care providers.
Yes.
It was based on the fact that
everyone had a six hundred
thousand dollars.
And so everyone so all well I
healthcare providers have their
first years two hundred thousand
dollars insurance they were
responsible for and the the fund
would pay out the rest of to the
total count.
We're at.
I.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Chairman of of the floors floor
in related fields.
Gentleman.
Here.
Last year.
The that.
The.
Revenue.
Yeah.
