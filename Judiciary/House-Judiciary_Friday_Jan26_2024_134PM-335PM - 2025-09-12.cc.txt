The.
Your men.
Here.
Yeah.
Here
dreaming about the weekend.
Okay before we get started when
your bill I just want to make a
couple of announcements so we
will be hearing a gun safety
bill after this bill.
And
you know we'll we'll do our
usual drill with regard to that
but I want to alert a third
people that monday will be
hearing a number of gun safety
bills as well and and we will
there may be as many as four as
a sea pack heard.
Will be hearing as well i'm just
giving everybody a heads up it
will it could be a long
afternoon and i'm planning on
ordering dinner so just letting
out everyone in the audience
know that you and anyone else
listening that that's the likely
plan for monday just FY I the
other thing i'd like to know is
a chair thomson has a commitment
to thirty i'm not saying don't
ask as many questions as you
need but we may have to call her
back or roll the bill if we're
not done by.
Up on that one as well so my
recommendation is be brief and
then we can go to the audience
and try to resolve this within
an hour or so thank you madame
chair and we I promise we will
be brief so this is an act I
carried it last year hospital
one or one that sets up in
statute firefighter peer support
services and and gets some legal
protections in there and I have.
I'm tired
of I have said low payers with
any legal questions because I am
far from an attorney and gus
padrody who is who is here with
the other courtesy fire
department so an also madam
chair I do have an amendment so
do you want me to explain the
bill or.
It's paring it down.
Okay so basically it enacts the
firefighter and emergency
service provider peer support
act allowing state local and
regional public fire agencies to
create peer support programs for
their employees and volunteers
making peer support services
confidential and limiting
liability for the provision of
peer support services we have we
will be striking the appro.
Okay.
Okay.
Two two madam chair two two
seven five oh four point three.
Yeah so the first the number one
is striking making a per an
appropriation on page one i'm on
page two were striking firefight
were striking including
firefighters paramedics and
dispatchers on mine pre page
three were striking hospitals
daff clergy or educator who are
it would be helpful to indicate
what i'm sorry okay and page
three line three strike hospital
staff clergy or educator who and
in thirteen in lew thereof who
has completed peer support
trading approved by the state
fire marshall's office on page
four
lights five and six strike and
to prevent another from
disclosing
number five is on page five
minute three after four insert
peer support services provided
by
on page fives nine eleven strike
gross negligence or intentional
misconduct and insert in lew
there have a failure to exercise
ordinary career and on page five
strike all of mine's twelve
three seven ten.
Okay.
All right so
let's first talk about the
amendment in terms of committee
come a discussion any questions
or representative on think
you're madam chair I just
curious I mean I read
the need money to do that.
Madam chair and representative
outcome yes but we're going to
try and get what we can get this
year and.
And hope for an appropriate hope
for.
Basically set up the system and
then come back again for next
year because we we did this last
year and we didn't it didn't get
past and in the thirty day
session and so there
there will go ahead i'm an
electronics answer.
Medicare representative
I think representative thompson
kind of capsulated the whole of
it whereas we're trying to move
this through as fast as we can
and we believe that there are
moneys to be achieved at a later
date and so if we can move this
bill forward here and that still
keeps other possibilities open
for us in the near future.
Anyone.
So generally I I like the
constitution and you and and I
actually didn't really have much
soon to my rego your number six
on your minute.
It does create a little bit of
concern for me I may just have a
little bit of dialogue um so the
way I understood the original
section five was essentially if
i'm a peer support team member I
could not be held individually
liable for the ser.
Gross negligence.
We're now altering that to see
what is essentially ordinary
negligence when.
The.
And so
when you take it to that level
for someone to be personally
liable
that I think.
Switching from intentional
misconduct or gross negatives.
The.
Yes
madame chair representative of
lane the concert was is that we
have fire firefighters receiving
and giving the service and it
would have protections for both
of them they took the language
that was in their previously
gross negligence are is a term
this really defined in the
during structures in new mexico
has been removed from the e j I
and intention on this conduct
with another.
Turned it would not provide
protections for those receiving
and or giving it so when we use
ordinary care defaults to what
the uniform during instructions
definition of ordinary careers
and that is for anybody to act
with ordinary and ordinary duty
of care to the others that they
are providing those services in
that case it would be the
firefighter receiving the
service
and mountain so I I guess i'm.
I don't want to interrupt but
i'm gonna
have we establish that it's
personal liability it was my
understanding my my
understanding is it they would
be indemnified by their employer
while some answer the reason why
I assume that as we look at page
five line five k it reference
the pure sport team member sh.
Um.
So people who work for
governmental energies are libel
but they're employer is there
after their public employer is
then libel to indemnify them.
So I mean that is my
understanding having worked for
public in the end being an
employer through a public end
now i'm sure I would hear is
that generally if you're talking
about something run on the top
claims act even the new mexico
so rights act but I read this is
creating a n.
It to reference the tort claims
act so that that it was clear
that that is what would apply I
think we could do that or maybe
even the the interview itself
make a close into this liab.
Either way I think it would be
nice
individual liability yeah I
don't i'm sorry that i'm jumping
in but it this is an important
point.
Yeah I think my suggestion is we
try to resolve it in the bill so
that.
So having said that let's.
Sorry in a room.
To clarify.
I mean there's a I think we have
the language already in the bill
so just we could.
Here support team member.
Fire agency you could put that
in front of constitutes.
Uh I think.
Prior to the failure.
Who provides your support
services and the public fire and
their agency who.
Fails to exercise ordinary.
Is that too much I don't first
of all
but it is beyond them.
And.
Why don't we just reference the
tort claims activities in.
Claims act and then the
references I see are the the
sponsors
we are okay with that okay
referencing the tort claims
correct okay so if someone could
suggest a place i'm happy to
consider consider cannot join
him in mention so I I i'm not
going enough with the tort
claims act to to know whether
just referencing it enough to
provide that for confidence what
if what if we just tag on a s.
Irrespective that forgoing an
individual peer support team
membersh.
Well I worry about that because
we want the energy and if it's
derivative liability.
You know then I think that could
create a problem so I don't know
maybe
if if we may
chair thomson
here we go
represent thank you madame
chair.
I mean maybe at the end of
section five.
A sim I call in looks like
provided however such liability
will be.
Provisions are subje.
I mean that sounds reasonable so
let's be let's be more slow so
right after a failure to
exercise ordinary care semicolon
and then what and then provided
however however.
That such liability.
Will be subject to the provis.
Of the tort claimed.
The.
We can maybe.
Then cheer we do have some
adversition mansion
representatives it would be tort
claims act forty one four one
and sequence
yes.
Talking too fast
you might hear it more for me
because
thank you.
All right
let's
people comfortable there.
So i'm happy to
we have a an amendment.
That has been proposed by the
sponsor why don't we why don't
we resolve that.
Just it on the fly so
uh.
Anyone object to the ame.
By the sponsor and it's.
Any opposition to that.
Oh sorry
not yet five zero four point
three
got it.
The amendment proposed by the
sponsor no opposition you have
that amendment has passed and
now
there was a proposal on by
represent of hembry so i'm gonna
see that you might moved the
following semi colon after the
words ordinary care in line
eleven
um provided however that such
liability shall be subject to
the new mexico tort claims act I
think there's a comma there
section forty one dash four dash
one at sequence and I imagine
there's a style of doing that
appro.
Yes yes ma.
So does everyone understand when
I i'll read i'll say it ag.
Okay so if we go to page five
the previous amendment struck so
we're gonna look out paragraph
six
on the amount man's page five
we're going to strike
gross negligence or intentional
misconduct that was already
stricken right and inserted in
there was a failure to exercise
ordinary care.
So you see that online eleven
representative and rep and
members okay so the gross
negligence and intentional
misconduct stricken we add it a
failure to exercise ordinary
care the amount meant is
striking is is adding a semi
colon provided however that such
liab.
Yeah.
Forty one dash four dash one at
sequence and will get the
correct kind of.
The.
The.
Any opposition to the amendment.
No opposition the amendment is
adopted.
So we've talked about the
amendments were now on the
amended bill
um any further comments about
the bill no matter chair we will
stand for questions okay let's
go to the audience anyone in
opposition to the bill as
amended.
Please
raise your hand.
Yeah I don't see anyone anyone
in the audience wishing to speak
and support please raise your
hand.
Don't need to speak support yes
yes.
The.
Um thank you for the brevity
madam chair anything else.
No thank you madame chair thank
you.
All right now we're back to the
committee.
The.
Yes thank you madame chair
representatives and thank you.
Very.
Yeah.
A good track record of helping
people deal with the issues and
the trauma that they see and
deal with routinely might really
one question about this.
The.
It says work.
III don't know because this is
not
I guess my question is what what
kind of wor.
Medicare representative thank
you for that question.
Obviously workplace issues as a
broad term but some of the ones
that aren't covered in this that
also deal with the chronic
traumas that can be experienced
on the job where place issues
could include things like sleep
deprivation and how are we
reaching out for the effects of
our entirely changed sleep
schedule due to our work place
environment and we wanted to
keep that a little bit broad so
that when these normal routines
of our job impact our lives and
ways that make us less likely to
deal with stress and a healthy
manner
okay thank you thank you just
one real quick follow up on
that.
I i.
I see I I just have a concern
that sometimes workplace issues
are covered by union contracts
and what sort of but that seems
to be different types of
workplace issues.
But but this is really kind of
bright.
Does madame chair I I think
basically it's saying any kind
of behavioral health are mental
health issues as opposed to
employment issues.
Okay thank you very much I
appreciate that clear.
Anyone else.
The.
One or one as twice amounted.
Okay we have a motion for a due
pass of on house bill one oh one
as twice amended.
Yeah.
Representative
yes
yes.
Yes
madam chair yes.
I.
Thank you thank you madame chair
members of the committee what's
the procedure in terms of the
second men that's the
amendment we made second
we will put it in our committee
report as describing the
amendment that was made okay and
then I don't have to do anything
with drafting or do you do
okay okay thank you so much
thank you all thank you.
That.
So i've handed the gave hold
over to my vice chair capable
guide by share
and came out of chair for the
audience we're behearing house
bill one
it's a committee substitute
industry accountability act
the way I think mountain charity
announced will announce it again
we'll do fifteen minutes.
In favor
inclusive of the.
So i'm with that we'll start um
with introduction go ahead
thank you madame chair this is
house bill one fourteen the
firearm accountability act.
And it's um I don't want to say
simple because that's a cliche
but it's I think pretty straight
forward what it does is it
requires a fire arm in the
industry member to astablish an
implement reasonable controls to
prevent the loss or thus of a
fire insure compliance with all
federal law and state law and
prevent the unlawful or
fraudulent sale or distribution
of a firearm to a person
concealing a purchase to a third
party.
And it also authorizes the
attorney general
it provides them with a path
forward in terms of enforcement
and they're there can be
penalties daily penalties of up
to five thousand dollars a day
should liability be found it
also provides a citizen who has
been damaged by the failure of
the member of the firearm
industry to implement adequate
court controls to sue for actual
damages recover attorney's fees
and punitive damages as
appropriate amount of chair and
without ready to have a
conversation about the bill.
I will assist this is james
gracen and he is the deputy
attorney in general for the
state of not attorney is it
still attorney general even if
you're in the justice department
I guess it is yeah
ok very good with our new mexico
justice department i'm getting
used to the new title
greeler thank you
or it will go to the audience is
there first we'll start with
opposition is there anyone.
And folks that want to speak up
you can do it from your seat and
will just start on this side if
you want us to give testing
sure there was a good
representative.
Yelling.
Calibers should agency believe
that all these issues is
what i'm sorry yes please
give you one minute you can
start over
the answer is education and
training to all these probably
i'm not going to pick the
discipline multiple things
wrong.
Speed more broadly.
The fire's industry currently is
regulated
under the fall back on fire
rooms regulations
through
catalan's licensees across the
nation
is the sole mechanism regulates.
The commerce and purchase and
sale.
Trade involving fire
this bill in all.
Yes passed and we have the same
thing come up last year.
Would render ffls
and
i'll leave the other part of it
another member here a little bit
isn't so yesterday in the bank
without fls operating under the
network it is been set off with
the place decades there will be
no effective regulation
they'll be at a boy that will be
feel like ill legal.
Anyone else wanting to speak in
opposition
one minute manager members many
money is berkeley.
Yesterday I went to.
Having a brief matter.
Thank you sir anyone else
wanting to provide public
testimony thanks here and the
county.
I just think that it's very
broad in the bill that I can be
held for.
Simply just doing the job that I
love I wouldn't choose to work
any other drop as it's
something.
The.
Twelve thirty.
I don't want to be
basically just about like.
Hello my name is banston's worth
and i'm also a sale staff.
As somebody who sells firms for
a living I could tell you that
we do have federal background
checks in place that the
purchaser has to go through and
answer each question truthfully
when it comes to straw purchases
or somebody concealing the
the fact that they want to sell
this by arm later on downline.
That can come back to me as
somebody who has sold that
firearm to that person and
after having the okay from the
federal government telling me
that I can sell this fire.
That doesn't seem to be a
safeguard for me or my
colleagues because that can
under this bill this proposed
bill come back to me.
And I simply cannot afford to
take responsibility for someone
else's federal.
Yeah.
I wanted to request about that
i'm sure representatives when he
was her christmas and on the
president of the new mexico
forums industry association a
couple of things to touch on
we already have things in the
unifortry practice that covers
this
visibility passed would open us
up to a tremendous liability
would be along the lines
somebody buying a new for truck
driving at a hundred bills and
hour down the road crashing into
somebody in killing them and
then four butter company being
held the liable for it would be
cut of the same thing
it's been brought up to the plc
aa does not cover this which it
does in some of the examples of
that is the fire was transferred
on is going to be used for crime
or or drop a drug offence
that's already asked in the in
the forty four seventy three
background check I limited
circumstances manufacturer that
doesn't hold a dealer's license
if the seller knowingly violated
an underlining statute.
If there is a breach of
contractor warranty if there's
death interior damage due to
design or defect
Again with young for a trade
practice back to the plca it is
already covered thank you thank
you sir.
The.
Madam charle members of the
committee might be more capable
of an attorney and also the
owner of most rancherous
conshop.
The the profits of this field
while audible plecutive of.
Or law I mean federal law
already covers all these
situations and I would church
rise this truly as a hamburger
we do not have violations on our
industry it is not in the
interest in the industry's
interest have gone to leave to
have strawbed purchases all of
which are viable to federal walk
currently and if we were
actively involved in that kind
of sale it would be an
actionable fraud to select and
identify to I treat the fires
industry separately in a part
from any other industry in this
case to simply does not make
sense so I would hope that we
turn this bill down and allow us
to get back to our business of
keeping our community safe and
following normal.
Committee members show what the
national rightful association
we're close to household one
fourteen the still opens the
door for fire industry members.
To be held liable for criminal
acts of this use of firearms
that will lovely sold misuse of
those fire.
The broad and forcement
mechanisms and section four
allows both public and private
lawsuits to recover damages from
fire industry member family to
complain requirements in the
bill about controls and
procedures those terms aren't
defined anywhere in the bill I
guess there would be left up to
the courts to figure out.
Civil penalties can be issued
five thousand dollars violation
but private lawsuits have no
limitation that's going to put
these gentlemen that have gotten
but spoken to you out of
business
the bill doesn't have any
restrictions of punishment for
actual wrong doors there aren't
mechanisms in federal law and
state
to straw purchases.
The.
Those laws at the state federal
level of art
other public testimony we have a
seven minutes remaining thank
you matter and members of
committee and key gardener
lovies for that so shooting
sports foundation where the
trading street for the
manufacturers and we're also
very concerned especially the
provision in here where you talk
about the definition of a person
there's a lot of ambiguity in
the language there's a lot of
i'm without effect and you go
back to the government and lady
who spoke a minute ago anyone
within the supply chain would
then be subjected to civil
litigation they have to pay the
defense costs if they even if
they prevail and defending
themselves.
By this laugh they would not be
able to recover those cars it
doesn't just apply to the owner
of the facility or other
individuals by by putting in the
work person as the fine in
statute you would make these
individuals liable for just
showing up for work in doing
their job and doing it right if
it fells around the front line
every day declining.
Firearms those individuals who
don't need the federal state
they are first line of defense
for safety and security and the
state they do an amazing job
this is punitive towards those
same individuals for standing on
the front lines of safety and
security would ask you to reject
this bill.
Thank you anyone else in
opposition.
The.
Thank you man share members of
the committee need asking here
on behalf of over seventeen
hundred members of zero rifling
personal club here in
albuquerque first the
definitions are so broad that
anyone building a fire at home
which is perfectly legal as
defined as a firearm industry
member in farm they make it home
and do not sell as a fired
product the bill showed at a
minimum be amended so the
normally citizen no seller of
gums has a firearms they made
stolen cannot be soon the fact
that actual harm isn't required
only a public nuisance creation
with an overbroad definition of
what actually is a public
nuisance is also a major issue
i'm not sure that something so
sweeping as a first an american
tort law it's certainly at least
an extreme outliner the peldie
earned of itself isn't the
policy instrument to drive
retailers out of business the
cost of defending the suits one
foreign excess of five thousand
dollars per current will do the
job this bill six drug gun
stores out of the state much the
same way that changes to the
medical malpractice law ran off
doctors we all know how that
ended was not do that again
thank you.
Thank you scares me thank you
madame chair members of the
committee i'm carlos santa
president and ceo of the new
mexico business coalition we
respectfully oppose this bill we
understand the concerns of the
crime in our society but this is
not the answer you are opening
up our manufacturers and we are
the state manufacturing
representative for the national
association manufacturers you're
causing them and as well as
employees and business owners
unprecedented liability the
attorney general has noticed no
did that there is about eight in
the law and we think that the
federal law covers the concerns
that you have we ask you to
please stop this bill and oppose
it today thank you
or finally.
Yes madame chairman
representatives of my name is
keith bled so and co owner of
roses guns and more and more
early
I am strongly applied to this
bill I only see its designed to
shut down the small businesses
like myself and it's
discriminatory as far as
industry you don't go after a
car dealership and a car
manufacturer because some drunk
ran into
that's the same thing that is
happening with the fire arm
industry
we're just doing our job were
heavily regulated and we do
follow the loss we have very
strict
control over us they could check
us at any time and they do
and we are just regulated enough
this is nothing but something
that will run us more out of
distance thank you very much
if there's anyone else in the
audience we have a couple more
minutes any more and opposition.
Rate arm will go to support
anyone in support of house fill
one fourteen.
Rate did you want to get public
testimony go right ahead.
Woman.
We feel that almost all products
that we deal with.
And guns
are being regularly for safety
just all other products are cars
are drives our kitchen chances
toys are and we feel good guns
need to.
Any other voices and support.
All right that all conclude
public comment matter.
Yes we have an opinion we just
had some hounds
go to regina first scorehad
regina
good afternoon share and members
of the committee I am an
engineer phd and engineering and
I worked on many products
including m r I and
of course systems etc india labs
and I will say that the
gun industry enjoys a level of
uhm.
Immunity from the kinds of
things that normal
manufacturers have things that
require them to prove do
diligence on their product and
the distribution is just one
piece of this bill or is also
false advertising and
manufacturing important it's the
entire supply chain and I
believe this is important thank
you.
Thank you sending.
Yes my name is center ben
objection i'm speaking on behalf
of the new mexico chapter of
mom's demand action it it is
reassuring to hear that we have
so many law biting then sharp
owners in the room but this
legislation isn't to deal with
you it's to help new mexico and
victims of gun violence old bad
actors in the firearm industry
accountable for their missed
conduct anyone who is
manufacturing selling importing
our marketing guns in new
mexico.
Shouldn't be expected to take
reasonable precautions to avoid
fueling gun violence crisis in
our state the bill require
industry members just to take
basic steps to avoid selling
guns to people who aren't
allowed to have them to
carefully protect deadly weapons
they sell from being stolen from
their stores and to make sure
they're not marketing guns
dangerously I strongly support
this bill and I hope that we
hold the industry accountable as
we do so many others
thank you that's I think all
with the handser is that we had
on zoom all right back to you
manager
thank you madame chair I would
like to bring to everyone's
attention on amendment that was
submitted earlier in the two o
two number is six one nine point
one
and so very short amendment
in our wait till it.
It's for the substantiates an
amendment to the substitute man
madame leader.
Um did you want to explain the
happy to explain it
what it does is on page two.
It adds its straights online for
advertising or marketing
and it inserts online three
the word or after the word
importing
and it eliminates the comma
after distribution.
And
that that amendment it was
is something that I was thinking
through after our last committee
hearing although the discussion
was somewhat convoluted I felt
that people were confused by the
advertising and marketing and it
was overly brought to include
someone who might be
doing that at the behalf of
another industry member the
activity is covered in section
three but it puts it on the
person using whose
putting out the advertising so
that's that's what i'm proposing
now i'm sure I think it
simplifies and clarifies
everyone in front of them but if
you could read out the two o two
number just so we oh sure yes
the last three digits point is
six one nine point one.
The.
The.
That we're doing um
comments on the amendment thank
you ma.
Just away fully understand.
What what you are doing is is
taking the advertising or
marketing out.
Uh in the definitions so th.
Advertising company isn't
on there but you're leaving it
and laid.
Conduct.
A.
Someone that is actively
involved in the industry madame
chair and representative yes
that's my intent.
The.
Any other comments on the um.
So I meant to move the committee
suffer discussion purposes
tonight.
I guess we just kind o.
Yeah.
The committee substitute is
what.
It's not our stuff I think yeah
yeah that's okay I I apologize
for the confusion I am now in
the twenty first century
wonderful so the the committee
sub is already up for discussion
we're now on the amb.
Aha.
Is are there.
Comments okay.
Thank you.
Ill.
Do you have any other comments
on the substitute before we
continue madam chair uh no
I have representative reading
thank you man of chair and I
want to begin first but I noting
in today's alba kirky journal.
There is an end of edual
add a licensed firearm
dealership in new mex in the
alvocation
that sold any legal weapon.
That dealer that federal license
dealer is now closed by atf.
And that person.
The federal government.
And that's the point we we
already have all this.
Uhm.
Madam chair and
representative I want to ask you
if a federal license.
Dealer either sold fire moramo
to an endividual that they
really believed was going to go
out and commit a crime would you
not be able under current one
new mexico to sue that license
dealer.
When that individual use that
gun ramo and a crime.
Madame chair and representative
I don't know what the cause of
action would be.
Madam chair maybe I need to be a
little more specific so this
individual comes in and says I
want to buy a box of emo and i'm
going to go out and kill mr.
And so you sell him the amount
and he goes out and kills mister
can the
state of mister recks so the
license dealer.
Madame chair and representative
I would be interested in knowing
what you believe the cause of
action would be.
I I think that it would be clear
that you helped facilitate the
crime you know so so that would
be a criminal prosecution as
that what you're saying madame
chair and represent it.
Managed here I think you also
have a civil but i'll move on
you know on that
manager and.
Doesn't aren't flows.
Currently under the unfair trade
practices of new mexico.
Madame chair and representative
that may be the case I am
withdrew
the portion of my original bill
on the unfair trade practices
because I wanted to spend more
time over the year and around
looking at how the two might
intersect in so if this bill
madam chair is limited to the
failure to implement appropriate
controls in the unfair trade
practice as peace was removed in
sea pack through a substitute
bill.
So benefit and managed or you
know from the previous year
there's been testimony.
Let's move on and on page two
wine.
Two we've heard some testimony
about the words person and I
think the word person the way
that it's defined is the store
employee.
The fedex company that
transports a farms and and of
course they're done by
signature.
Umm I think that that's overly
broad manhim chair medium chair
would you explain why you're
using person.
That broadly.
Madam chair in representative I
don't think it's abroad term it
could be a firearm industry
member means a person and that
could be a single individual or
could be a corporate person so
why what would we limit it to.
Well madam chair madame chair I
think it would proud will be be
better if it was the license
firm dealer.
Rather than the employee at
we've heard employees.
Under that do you agree there
included or not
madam chair and representative
if the if an employee has the
responsibility for implementing
adequate controls and and that
in those controls are now met as
defined in this bill I think
there is potential store
managers and employee and the
store manager may have the job
assignment of of ensuring that
adequate controls are in place
and implemented by employees
that work for the manager so
certainly and when there is a
company that hire the engages
people those people may be
liable if they're not
implementing the controls that
they're they're they're employer
has imposed on them or is
expected of them thank you
madame chair and and i'm
cheering I think that was my
point
selling the ammunition to go
killed mr x but what's move on
to a page to.
Wanting to.
That means that everything has
to be walked up.
You know
I think that
that you can't have any items to
splayed I mean maybe you have to
lock the front door and only
allow him to enter one at a time
or so i'm not sure what what
exactly are you trying to do
there.
Madame chair I and
representative I don't think
it's unreasonable to expect that
a store or a distributor of guns
have have established mechanisms
to want to
ensure to the best of their to
the best of their ability that
those arms are not landing in
the wrong hand so let me tell
you a little story if I may
amount of chair there's a case
pending right now in new jersey
the store
had in it on its premises guns
lying.
About the store.
Understands by the door on a
desk near the window.
In plain view not locked
they did not store them in the
evenings they posted photographs
of their store in that condition
online and bad actors saw that
went to the store broke
installed the guns I think we
can all agree that that those
are not adequate controls and as
a result those guns got in the
hands of criminals and they have
they are slowly being retrieved
by the government at some
expense I would imagine and I
could also imagine those guns
being illegally used in a crime
or even worse killing someone or
are seriously injuring someone I
think it's reasonable to hold
some.
Store and maybe those
individuals involved responsible
for that.
Madam chair.
In manager and madame chair I
understand your point I think
that are big point is is that we
mention criminals broke in and
criminal stole and criminals
later sold the other criminals
and I think it's time this
legislature gets tough on c.
Like someone breaking into your
house and stealing your car keys
and driving your car and then
they're involved in a collision.
And then you know somehow you're
liable for the south of your own
car that.
Let me move on without
let's go over to page three
lines read through eight and.
What you've described there is
straw purchase in a straw
purchase is already legal by
federal law and in fact we made
it illegal in new mexico by new
mexico law last year so I don't
know that we need that we've
already got it
madam chair and representative I
disagree if someone is
potentially injured by the the
gun that was involved in the
straw person purchase that
individual has a claim
for personal liability against
them the member of the fire arm
industry that's what we're
trying to do here this is a
deterrent bill this is a bill
that is telling individuals who
who are involved in the industry
that they need to be very
responsible and mindful of the
responsibility to society at
large and those individuals who
might be hurt by failure to
implement adequate control so I
don't think it's unreasonable at
all to give a private cause of
action to somebody's by a
strong.
Madam chair and madame chair I
go back to my beginning about
the today's journal.
The person sold any legal
firearm to a person who could
not receive it
now he didn't use it in a crime
okay but he's been prosecuted
federally and how do you used it
in a crime I think that he could
have done there would be
possible action for a lawsuit.
Madam chair and representative I
think certainly I commend the
fed federal
agents who are involved in that
but we are stretch very sin by
law enforcement in this provides
you had another tool for those
individuals who might be injured
and if if that gunhead moved
beyond that the initial
transaction and injured someone
that individual might have a
cause of action it should it be
proven that article controls
were implemented not in place to
insure that that would not have
happened so there are multiple
tools I think people demand and
want and the federal government
we we passed our own state of a
straw purchase law because we
weren't satisfied that the feds
had adequate staffing I assume
that was part of the rationale
well that was a part of my
rashed analytics supporting bill
how about that representative
and so we now have a state cause
and this gives additional tools
for people to take on this
industry.
Thank you madame chair and man
of when we if we can go to page
for now and we go to line
thirteen through fifteen we're
talking about the court shell
award well.
What if the defendant prevails
in th.
Say they would receive
their attorneys fees
madam chair and representative
under our system of justice it's
the prevailing plaintive who
typically
recovers attorney seasons as a
very typical class in in civil
rights claims any number of um
provisions where so this is
consistent with how we handle
all other kinds of awards of a
turn most other all is a strong
term and I if there's probably
some exception out there
and we have some smart lawyers
on the
chair generally this is the way
it's handled madam chair i'm
sorry manufacturing man i'm
chair what.
Yes since i've been honest
committee I think nineteen years
there is always been a
discussion about the english
system and american system i'm
one and not to get so hoily toy
with you so I got the avoided
that better
you know it's been this
committee in the past that said
attorney's fees and and all that
will be up to the court I think
that's the way it should be.
Anyway madam chair and adam
chair i'm gonna stop there today
thank you.
The.
Thank you madame chair and
madame chair and and mister
gracen thank you for being here
appreciate it.
I.
And I don't want to
I just have a look.
I'm somewhat confused by this
bill.
Um and
again I i.
I I think
representative reamon and and
many of the people in the
audience
talked about this personal
liability
and.
I think it's not just sorry if
i'm too loud are too close.
The thing a person I think.
I respectfully disagree with you
that person is.
Adequately
concise beat the other question
I have is about the next word
which is engaged.
And I think that can be very
broad as well and so
what is a is a shareholder of a
corporation.
In get that is a manufacturing
company.
Is that a person in engaged.
In is in these things is that a
firearm industry member.
It would be my interpretation
that it is.
Okay thank you madame chair
madame chair madam chair it's
like doctor after
I understand that that is you
are into our interpretation but
this is going to be an
interpretation made by a judge
he was not pretty r
conversation I agree but you
asked me so that is correct you
are correct madame chair and and
but
I I sorry madam chair madame
chair
I did ask you but
I think the point i'm trying to
make as it is kind of a broad
term even though maybe you do
not intend to be and i'm
concerned about some conflicts
with our other existing laws.
Under like our corporations act
and that limits liability to
shareholders we have limits to
liability to officers and
directors but this of
corporations but this things to
open add up.
And and so i'm.
I'm just wondering if that could
be
narrowed down.
Madam chair in represent happy
to entertain language if you
have some you'd like to share.
Madame chair thank you madame
chair I do not.
I had no idea how hard this was
and and how much how little time
you have to look at all these
different bills it is but how
interesting yes
so but thank you for that and
and and I think.
Maybe narrowing that down
narrowing down person engaged.
Um would be would be very
helpful.
Um.
One of the the the other things
in this is is a little farther
down
page two beginning on lines
twenty one that subsectio.
And in and you kind of said
something about this in a
response to one of it
representative reans questions
it's
great insurer that firearm
industry member complies with
provisions of federal and state
laws and that seems to me to be
something like we need a lot to
tell them to obey our laws
and that seems to plicative to
me.
No what this bill does it allows
people the attorney general's
office or an individual who's
been harmed by someone who
hasn't done what they needed to
do to brick to have a civil
cause of action.
It's not directly and
enforcement of a specific law
madam chair and representative.
Thank you manager madame chair.
Okay I said thank you for that
explanation but.
I
and madame chair madame chair
the the other
question I have is what is
reasonable I mean what does that
mean by reasonable controls and
procedures.
Because what to you is may be
reasonable may not maybe.
We may not have the same
definition of reasonable oh
madame chair and representative
but the law does I mean about
what's reasonable as developed
and we all went to law school
those of us who are lawyers have
spent a lot of time about what
is reasonable care what is
reasonable conduct and so on so
that is developed through the
law madam chair and
representative and that would be
developed in any case that we're
at witnesses would be common
command and talk about what what
industry standards are and was
this particular store owner
observing those standards and
and that that happens in medical
malpractice and many other
things about what is reasonable
conduct in the context of that
particular profession or
industry management chair and
representative yes thank you
madame chair and and madame
chair and madame chair yes
reasonableness is I would say
somewhat defined because
reasonableness is an ultimate
ultimately the a question of
fact for the fact fine which
could be a as you know a judge
in a bench trial or a jury in a
jury trial and so.
I have a.
An issue somewhat with how it
when that's ultimately the
question of fact for the fact
finder how someone knowingly.
The.
Is there something that is not
reasonable how how do you know
what a particular jury or a
particular judge is going to
find as reasonable or not
madam chair
i'm referring to
from us supreme court case
twenty twenty three a person
acts knowingly when he is aware
that a result is practically
certain to follow.
Okay thank you madame chair so
so.
Yeah.
That is interesting.
A mountain mountain item in on a
republic no please go that this
is all this is part of case law
knowingly is not an uncommon to
madam chair and in laws that we
draft and it is interpreted
routinely through you know the
dispute process madam chair
thank you madame chair madame
chair
you are correct and I just.
I.
I don't want that we could go
all day on hypotheticals and I
don't I don't want to do that
thank you yes
i'm sure everyone else would
love for me to but
now so I I do
I do.
Appreciate that and and thank
you for that answer what i'd
like to end on and and I
is
on the the provision that
representative well two things.
Uh.
I.
On page for line nine.
It allows someone to recover
actual or punitive damages
shouldn't be punitive damages if
there should be any at all which
I don't think there should be
but should be but punitive
damages be contention upon
actual damages because if there
are no actual damages how do you
have unit
and that is our I believe our
system.
Madame chair and representative
i've never seen a bill that his
law that has made actually
actual damages the crappredicate
to punitive damages there is
some case law madam chair and
representative that spend
developed that talks about the
proportion of um actual unitives
but often an actual damages are
nominal but the goal of punitive
damages it is to deter bad
conduct so I don't think one is
contingent upon the other.
The.
Thank you madame chair madame
chair i.
I think I have a different
interpretation of that because
if there are no actual damages.
I mean then that basically.
The.
Well.
I think
and i'm not an expert on civil
jury trials so I my
understanding was that punitive
damages are usually contingent.
Other learning attorneys on this
committee could correct me I i.
The last thing and now this
really is last thing i'm sorry.
Is only is on the recovery of
attorney's fees madam chair
and.
I think.
The default.
In our system.
When you're dealing with private
parties.
When you're dealing with two
private parties which
subsection see is the default is
no.
Attorneys fees.
B as you mentioned in civil
rights cases it is usually the
prevailing plaintiff that is
correct but those are against
the government.
Civil rights cases the
government doesn't get to
collect.
Attorney speeds if it's the
probat.
Here and their.
I don't have it there is.
So so when.
You move away from the default
rural.
By statue between civil parties
I believe there is some new
mexico case law that requires
those attorney speeds per.
Madam chair and represent i'm
unaware of any rule or can
suggest that if I make um
comment on your kind of
the practice of you know the
premise of your comment that may
be true and I contract dispute.
But this is a different thing
this is someone who is in a firm
industry
who we and I think most of us
agree that guns are dangerous
things that have the potential
for causing great damage to a
person so a person is injured
this is my my suggestion to you
a person is injured because a
member of the fire arm industry
field implement adequate
controls and what you're telling
what is being suggested in this
discussion is that person should
have to bear their own costs and
fees if they're injured because
someone in the industry failed
to implement adequate controls I
don't think that's fair I think
it's fair if someone is hurt by
the failure of someone who has a
big responsibility in how they
take care of these inherently
dangerous items and they fail to
do that that person who is
injured it's fair that they be
able to quite recoup their
attorneys fees this is not just
a contrary
dispute this is something was
when somebody is serious to hurt
by the failure of someone else
to do something that they should
be doing.
Thank you madame chair for that
and I I understand that fairness
madame chair if I could have one
follow up to that.
I I understand that in a tour
context if someone is hurt in a
tour context they do have that
ability.
This is not at work this is a
public nuisance which is eight
subset sorry it's but it's not
it it a public nuisance.
Right is is is not your
traditional toward so I I think
we're but thank you for your
time
thank you
thank you.
Think about her representative
mr grayson.
People are concerned that they
are.
Already complying with some
regulations and that somehow
there compliance won't protect
them.
I'm wondering if you.
Thank you madame chair up and
and leader chase I think that's
a very good point
often standard of care is tied
to weather or not
an individual or a company as
adhering to you know rules and
if they're hearing the rules and
in this case perhaps some other
generally accepted business
practices there is not these
there should not be an issue
about whether or not adequate
controls were in place madam
chair.
That
manager that that's my take on
it and if yeah I i've also heard
something that's contrary to my.
Um.
Non specific knowledge.
My non specific knowledge based
on the fact that.
The public health community has
been
not permitted to collect data I
am firearm deaths and and things
that any
other industry.
Or any other product.
Is common knowledge and.
I think the fire industry is
very much protected by federal
laws from disclosure and so I I
don't quite understand how.
The.
This is more burdensome to this
particular industry than other
consumer protection
lies.
Lancher.
Could you
address that.
Madame chaira and leader chase I
I think your point is well taken
seem to remember and I haven't
followed up on this thought but
this idea
the cdc has been for years
prohibited from collecting data
on unfirearm the industry and
dous and someone so forth and as
a result we're all kind of
groping now because we don't
know what might be the most
effective way of addressing gun
violence and that's very
disappointing and I think it's
reflective of the influence of
the national rifle association
has had on congress for decades
and other gun organizations have
done their very best for us to
be kept in the dark as to what
you know the expanse of
potential problem.
That certainly is a problem and
I would agree with you madam
chair and leader.
There is a lot out there that we
don't know but what this may do
is ensure that people have the
ability on their own to pursue
claims and I would also know
we have seen in our hearings
madam chair
members of
and and this is less so than it
was so I don't want people to
feel that i'm using a large
group of law enforcement but we
have seen a people attand our
hearings objecting to law laws
where we're trying to enhance
the safety of our citizens who
are the member of our law
enforcement community that's a
diminishing group I would note
and I I just want to emphasize
that but it has been an issue in
the in when we have discussed
these kinds of legislations so
by giving the individual.
The ability to pursue a claim
should adequate controls not be
in place where mitigating
against some concerns that there
may not be adequate follow up by
others madam chair and and
represent
thank you very much our
representative chamber I
appreciated that that confirms
my.
My sense in fact i've read some
very independent reporting in
recent years that would subject
that the general membership of
the national rifle association
does not.
Individuals don't oppose a lot
of.
Reasonable.
Safety measures like thorough
background checks.
And.
Yet it is the industry and i'm
not talking about the people
here who are selling the guns
i'm talking about the
manufacturers who have.
Promoted the arm.
Hands off of the indust.
Stamps that with which were
dealing with the cdc can even
now provide us with information
after the fact of.
To help us develop a scientific
or reasonable strategy to
address the mass killings all we
ever hear is well it's just
people who need who have metal
health problems I I don't know
that we have more people with
mental health problems in this
country then then are in sweden.
Or or or somewhere else I I
don't necessarily think well we
could because provide some
benefits we don't
but
we're we're we are kind of in a
vacuum as to our knowledge on
the science or perhaps ways to
mitigate the what we're trying
to address here which is.
The.
Preventing unnecessary loss of
life in particularly of our
children and.
You know this is an even saying.
That you can't sell to somebody
who has a mental.
The.
But maybe.
The sellers would be more
careful I one of my best
friends.
And last her daughter to
self inflicted gun shot wound in
colorado and she wrote notes to
everyone in her family and said.
Before I bought the gun they
made me feel out.
Form and they asked me if i'd
been possible eyes for mental
reasons and th.
And
she said I answered truthfully
and they sold me they've done
anyway so I think maybe that
situation might be mitigated
here on it.
Private cost of action would
that be correct manager madam
chair thank you for that
question and leader chassis yes
and I would not on page three it
specifically says if there are
not adequate controls in place
that would prevent.
Um a firearm industry member who
has reasonable caused to believe
that is that yes you know you're
not supposed to sell to someone
that you have reasonable cause
to believe may be a risk to
themselves or to others and in
that scenario do you just
described I would think that
would apply if the person
actually said that they were in
treatment for a mental health
condition or something which is
what I thought your scenario was
so I this could potentially give
a family member who was injured
as a result of a loss of a loved
one a claim
chair and representative and and
mr grace and.
I guess I don't really think a
seller would want to do that.
I honestly don't think they w.
People aren't going to do that
so it's all done to be the ones
who.
I don't know fly by night or
whatever
who be willing to do that and I
remember I I carried out
measure and mister carner might
have been around at that time
but.
The.
I had a
measure that the speaker been
mohan said I told him I don't
have the votes to get this past
but I got it to the flork we
have a debate on this for a
while and he agreed and it was
to
create it commission and they
had passed the lot in both
marlind and new jersey.
And it had been right to me by
a public health someone who is
getting a masters in public
health.
And.
It was to get everyone at the
table I mean manufacturers
sellers.
Can save to the advocates
everyone at the table and decide
what kind of
safety standards we might want
on hand guns sold in new mexico
and it was just talk about it at
that point and
one of things I learned and this
was in about two thousand and
three so we're talking twenty
one years ago.
Is that there are safety
standards on sword comes.
The consumer products if.
The.
And that's why representative
really not me a scored gun.
Some other reason.
Really III just want it save you
I think this is going after
about actors III know where
calibers is there
exercise there and I I feel safe
when i'm around there you know.
They're in about.
The.
Right now.
Go after tire manufacturers when
tires fail on the road and blow
up.
And I just think we're we're
looking a.
Well or bars.
Right we have a gram shop
liability and if a person who's
selling alcohol has a reason to
believe the person is impaired.
They can be an allow them and to
continue to serve alcohol and
allow them to proceed to
potentially drive a car there is
a potential for liability there.
This is not unheard of madam
chair representative.
So that those my comments and
questions and thank you very
much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Man chairman chair I am
particularly interested in the
liability for.
Selling fire arms to.
Uh people who use th.
On page three line fourteen.
Mm.
Product.
Because minute home to the
person.
To me some examples of how
someone would have.
Madame chair they may hear over
here conversation in the
store.
Where there is a discussion of
of
potentially hurting
your girlfriend our boyfriend.
Wife
people sometimes are loose in
terms of how they converse and
there is that potential.
If the person who is purchasing
the gun may be considering
suicide sometimes there are in
disheart even the person
mentioning it in in when they're
purchasing the gun so it may be
a rare situation but it
certainly is a potential
situation.
Okay man chair
man sure thing for that
so so support for related to top
to page to subsection see
event that in lawful or
fraudulent sale
so it's probably not.
Fraudulent.
But it could be unlawful but
what makes it unlawful as it is
that this.
Madame chair and representative
it would be
i'm i'm sorry some of those
coughing I can okay i'm sorry
representative and madam chair
unlawful under other law.
Other than him chair manager I
just I don't know the can laws
officially tend to know that is
it unlawful to sell a going to
someone who.
You have reasonable cause to
believe might use it for someone
I mean I don't know where that
prohibition exists.
Madame chair and representative
i'm happy to again some
assistance from mrperiod grason.
Sure representative of macqueen
so substrictions see three
audio.
Okay so not talking about
subsection forty three looking
at subsequency for and
particularly see so.
The quest wait my question is.
If it's not unlawful to sell
someone so again to someone who
might use it for so far.
Then this never gets triggered
and my question is
where in state or federal is it
unlawful to do that.
Mm.
And madam chair representative I
think it's an interesting point.
Um and and perhaps that inter.
Clarification
were unpage three and were
paragraph c four in three um
there is kind of interplay.
The.
Okay so I think that's.
I am just trying to understand
how the pieces for together and.
Uhm
it doesn't seem redundant or
doesn't seem redundant.
If for super four is contingent
on the introductory fate freeze
and support three or s.
You know just a trend and she
had this put together I think.
And then moving back the chain
and chairman chair
so all this starts with the
introductory freeze in section
three.
A fire industry membership.
To do all these and I wonder
man tear what with the
reasonable controls and
procedures might look like.
So so this is.
Yeah we were talking about the
conversation in the the gun
store okay but we still then we
we go up with relative
reasonable controls and
procedures.
Is there.
A procedure to document the
conversation is there a
procedure to to ask the purchase
of questions as their.
Represent chasing reference call
rather example where there was a
questionnaire.
Or.
Is there there now can be a
question here every time you
mister madam chair and
representative I think what
reasonable controls will be
would would be developed by the
industry themselves and
determining how they can
validate that the person is the
person who's entitled to
purchase the gun to ensure that
their employees don't sell guns
to people who don't check out on
you know the background checks
all of those things and that
would be up to the individual or
store owner or company or
business to to develop and they
would be tested it through the
the normal processes but having
no controls or certainly not
reasonable controls.
So some member enchaired we were
talking earlier about controls
for theft and I know like.
You go into a horizon store you
can pick up a cell phone but
it's you know it's it is to that
yeah I think it's
I think having reasonable
controls for theft
is sort of in a brainer I I get
that.
But in terms of something like
soft arm so
I would think it would sort of
be a question here it would be.
The.
There's difficulty and implement
that like.
Have you ever suffered from
depression so.
Some people might no.
Might not answer that.
Chair and representative I don't
see us heading in the most
absurd approaches to some of
these things reasonable is
reasonable and that is a
standard of care that is defined
in case law and the like and it
will be developed through this
process as well so many chairman
chair I I don't think my example
is absurd.
My colleague agrees with you but
the point is that you can have a
question here you can ask about
these kind of things.
The.
If a purchaser.
Suffered from a mental only set
some in the past and disclosed
that.
Even.
Maybe you know fine now.
In subsequently.
Uses a weapon for self harm or
armies someone else.
You know that's going to come
out and and you know twenty
twenty hindsight it's gonna be
an issue
so I just yeah I am trying to
understand how this all relates
together
I I do think
we're suggesting the consellers
that they.
Go above and be beyond that the
back.
Could circle back to me on on
how the.
Separate c relat.
Question manager.
Think representative.
Thank you
anyway then chair
I don't just into the audience.
The.
The.
For an against
I wouldn't think that i'm
wondering about.
If I go and still the gentleman
from one.
And I crashed into somebody
who made it you think that that
general mentions.
Um.
I would believe it would but I
know i'm
i'm not an expert on that
particular indefinitely what
they definitely would have to
medium chair and but if I just
tell that doesn't mean to learn
because you.
The.
The government doesn't have any
insurance to cover the fact that
I still discover and when he
said somebody.
That.
So you know when you think about
those that you know and you're
thinking about this.
I guess the so that's just what
that's.
The other thing is about the
word person
You know that a new mexico.
You're going to a bar.
And that bargain there bartender
overseas you allows you to
overdream.
That by tender that person who
showed you is liable if you go
out on the street and crash that
car killed somebody did you know
that
um.
Representative could you repeat
that i'm sorry i'm sorry man
chairman of tear
sorry madam chair
I am the error representative
I am under bill okay
although this is what i'm
hearing from the audience I am
going that
we can do the judge and item
madame
so if.
Going to that bar and you're
leave that bar totally styles
and you crashed out a car.
That person attorney can be sued
madam chair and representative
yes and I get your point and
that is we're not this is not
i'm just doesn't the idea yeah
this is a yeah I heard the work
person been mentioned
so therefore
they go into that going store
that pursue or person goes into
the gunstor bicycle should
somebody that person that sold
that then it's not liable for
anything correct.
I think that could be correct
that's just the couple of
comments that I have right now
matter to because the thing is
that we we could have been pair.
Because the other things in
life.
And it there are ties for
everything else.
And somewhere along the living
room
kind of control.
I wonder things that bothers me
specially when i'm on the
campaign trail.
Is i'm not in on the door and I
look in the window and write the
under windows as a good.
And then you read in the
newspaper about the break is and
what is the number one item that
is stolen from home
so with that then which are I
would just live that thank you
thank you madame chair manager
thank you representative for
time that look for us
representati.
Thank you matter.
It's been a lot of discussion on
sort of the details of trying to
be.
Quickly to deplicate.
I have a question manager page
two on the definition of fire
and firearm industry member.
And i'm concerned about how
broad this is because this
becomes relevant down in s.
Positive obligation on them to
implement a reasonable
constroles and procedures
manager usually only see these
kind of standards that put in
the implement reasonable
controls and procedures are
talking about somebody that this
is in there the the course of
their ordinary business and and
that's not the case here so for
example manager I think that
this would apply to say.
A widow who's holding in a state
cell
if you look at someone a person
engaged in the cell of a firearm
product I think they would loop
in
somebody who is a one time.
Capable of implement.
What I feel is is.
The.
Well adam chair and
representative I think
the controls and patrick
seizures have to fit the entity
and individual that you're
speaking of if you're in the
business of selling firearms
those procedures and controls
might differ from those over one
time sale although I would say
madam chairman representative if
you're selling a fire i'm that's
a responsibility
and you need to act responsibly
whether you're one person who
inherited your loved ones
firearm or your store so I think
there is a potential and if I
were a person selling it on i'd
go to an expert and talk to them
about how is the best way to
insure that i'm following the
law and appropriately and
ensuring that these various
factors not met so I appreciate
your hypothetical anna it is one
that one could be sympathetic
with and I am but i'm also
sympathetic to the fact madam
chair that a person injured
through a sale that was not done
responsibly should we should
have sympathy for as well madam
chair and representative.
Well manager I and I guess that
kind of gets the crux of of the
difference of view points this
doesn't say someone who's
irresponsible that's not the
standard there's no knowing
standard anywhere in this bill.
Civil standard when it comes.
Just the mere fact of not
having.
Reasonable controls and
procedures that's the sticking
point.
It doesn't matter whether you
should have no one or whether
you knew at all.
And so i'm worried about a
member definition that's so
broad.
The.
That we're looping in people
that even if they go through
though the federal and state
background checks.
Because again this is not in
their ordinary.
I'm also concerned and the irony
is not lost on you that in the
first bill we heard today.
We actually removed.
The individual liability of the
employee.
Of governmental energies.
In providing essentially.
Ordinary course of their work.
And yet today here manager and
this I found this to be very
compelling we have.
Who are just employees they
don't get to make the procedures
they don't get a make implement
the res.
This definition loops and then
loops them in this well.
And so I could see if you want
to go after the owners.
But if the employee is following
the.
And they don't knowledge again.
Because there's nothing in here
I can understand if the employee
knows as a different story if I
know i'm feel i'm selling a firm
to it to a known fellow okay
came on I get it but that's not
the language it's in your it's
just if they're following the
reasonable controls and
procedures of their employer
that their employer set.
And little otherwise have
knowledge they could still be
found liable under the s.
Thank you if you look on page
three manager and section for.
It is a public nuisance for a
firearm industry member to
knowingly or recklessly fail.
To exercise reasonable controls
regarding the sale etcetera etc
so
I guess representative I
disagree with your initial
statement that there's no
knowingly.
So manager but I I would
understand if it was.
Knowingly a recklessly fell to.
To it here to a federal state
law but again it is it ties back
into that knowing and recklessly
standard ties back into the
controls and procedures and
again that's that by the.
To extend civil liability to an
employee who doesn't have
knowledge.
That they're selling to a far to
a fellow for example all they're
doing is following.
The.
That's the knowing standard and
so I I think we're exposing
potential employees here.
I think is is not helpful to to
any.
Madame chair and representative
again I disagree there's a
there's a recklessness and
annoying standard in the bill
and an individual who follows
the controls will likely be
protected in their employer will
be
brought into the case if those
are not adequate people sue
people who have insurance and so
on as you know a management
chair and representative so I
think the worst case scenarios
are you know make great
conversation but they're not
realistic well madam chair I
think that two young people here
travelled from object would.
Disagree with that this is
their.
Based on what has been explained
to them madame chair and
representative you for
interrupting me.
I the way that this statute
reads.
Is if they knowingly fell.
To exercise reasonable controls
and procedure regarding the cell
I can remove controls and
pursues or their recluse
recklessly felt there so.
They're liable.
It doesn't have any insolution.
It's just their falling the
policies and proce.
Narrowed
you want to go after the person
who makes the policy who makes
the procedure.
Fine.
But don't go after an employee
who sh.
And they don't know they also
don't have the men's rare that
they're.
The next question.
So I guess.
How is this different.
If I may
a retailer.
There's already a duty and.
Procedures in place and so.
How do you implement liability
is it just that if I have a
policy on the book.
To a fellow that i'm covered by
the.
Again madam chair of course
there's a knowing standard in
the bill and the way one would
implement that if there's a
winking enough they're all kinds
of transaction that occur we're
per people are a notice that
there there's something shady in
the transaction and their
electing to not recognize that
and and follow through on the
sale as it is and I would not
straw sales or is a criminal
statute this is not a criminals
out it's a civil search statute
that gives rock that creates the
ability to bring a claim if
you're the person day I
mentioned or you're the attorney
general.
So i'm outside so if I have
along the books that are a
policy on the block books that
m.
It depends on what you knew in
during the transaction
there are interactions between
individuals when one is perching
purchasing a gun and i'm
uncertain that there they will
have something on there is a law
on the books
but it's depends on our the
totality that circumstances are
the sale.
So many.
That's what the should be.
Wing.
The.
Procedure.
About sort of that.
Manager the other way that that
this is written in.
So we talk about this idea of
firearm.
That's defined broadly above.
So let's say that I am a
manufacturer.
That that falls within the
preview of fire ministry member.
It says that I have to establish
an implement reasonable controls
and procedures.
The.
Regarding the cell manufacturer.
Prevent the loss of death of a
fire product how my supposed to
do that.
If i'm a manufacturer.
How do I prevent an
interimplement.
It's as loss or theft of the
product.
Are you
that doesn't mean it has to be
at the store at the time what if
it's in transport what if there
aren't adequate controls when
you're transporting the the
product to the store you're
assuming that that manufacturer
is responsible for the store but
there's an intermediate step
from the manufacturer all the
way to the store and and they
also store guns manufacturers
store guns as well that you know
they are in their inventory for
a period of time i'm assuming
they they are not immediately
transported to a retailer there
will be responsibilities on that
manufacturer to ensure that that
those those items are have
proper controls.
Manager I agreed with everything
you just said.
That the way this is written
it's so broad.
That you can you can take a fire
manufacturer at the top level.
And take them down and they're
still responsible when you get
to the middle.
Because the way this is written
it says that they have a
positive obligation to print the
losses that's a fire and product
from a firearm industry member
and it doesn't tie it into.
To the retail level or anything
else so I understand if if i'm a
manufacturer and i'm storing
firms on on site.
And and even if I
transporting those I think that
that makes sense to me to make
sure that those.
But the way this is written and
just the point of making as this
bill is so overly brought that
it would actually apply even to
the retail.
Portion when it's completely out
of my hands and madam chair I
disagree.
So a manager I guess I just look
at the plane language and that's
to me that's the reading of what
produc.
The next question I have is on
the private cause of action.
So many can you explain why why
do we have a cap.
Madame share and representative
the ag
has the ability to recover
damages
but if there are no damages we
need to have a set fee a an
individual you were talking
about someone who's actually
harmed so one is going to assess
and that's in the bill one's
gonna assess what actual harm
that individual i'm sustained
it's not something that an
attorney general is normally
going to be able to articulate
the actual harm instead they are
acting as enforcement mechanism.
Manager can you show me and.
The.
To recover actual damages.
It's online for at some page for
line nine or manager that
setting what they can recover
they can recover.
Can actually be harmed in order
to.
A madam chair and representative
to be able to have standing to
bring a suit you have to
establish harm unless otherwise
stated for example the bill we
saw last year the the standard
was
aware of a violation of crime in
this case you have to have its
actually sustained actual damage
I I think we're quibbling about
terminology madam chair i'm sure
I really wish but at this I
think this is one of the fun
flaws I see in this bill and
something maybe you're opened to
clarify that but the the whole
concept is it's a private
citizens who is obeying a
nuisance that's that's the
context in which this is formed.
It's not a typical tort context
where i've been harmed and now
i'm soon to recover my damages
this is an abatement context.
And so if if the intent of the
bill is to make sure that
someone who has not in that
stream of commerce for example
or my loved one was injured
because of you not following the
policies and procedures some
some way that there's a
tangential connection there.
Then I think we need to make
that about it clear because the
way I read the opening line and
paragraph see it just says the
private system it brings a civil
action.
To abate the public nuisance and
say anything about me having to
have suffered actual damages or
been in in the
the zone of.
The.
And so what I would submit
mountains if that's not.
You know if a firearm sold and
astered new mexico that somebody
from lost cruises could file
suit over that then I think we
need to to make that upon it
would clear because the way that
first lines written.
It's not clear in my opinion.
I'm sure you disagree I disagree
there was no question so I
didn't respond to fair enough
can you explain why why you d.
The.
Because it speaks in terms of
actual damages and punitive
damages madam chair
so manager I would agree if if
that does jump.
So it doesn't demand actual
damages that actually says or
damages so that would imply that
you don't have to have a.
So manager doesn't sound like
you're open to making it clear.
Do you have a suggestion i'm
sure I would be happy.
What is that so I think you
would be a a private s.
I'm sure.
Age for their graph sea line
six.
And
it opens with a private s.
I'm conferring with my expert
my expert reminds me that the
the pretext betin the unit
between the as you correctly
point it out representative lane
behind a nuisance provision is
that there's no need to suffer
actual harm and that the second
sense addresses the other
component that you seem
concerned about so I think we're
going to let it stay as it
stands this is typical nuisance
law madam chair representative
so many churches so the people
watching this underst.
If there's a firm sold anastic
you live in los cruces that said
no negative impact on your life.
You can file suit and go after
the person who sold that farm.
A madam chair and representative
that's true right now as rew
right now on under general
nuisance law.
So amount answered so if there's
a pig farm somewhere and you're
an astech but the pig farm is
doing something that under
normal law would create a
nuisance that person whether or
not they live next to the pillow
farm could bring a suit to a bad
the nuisance.
And manager I think that's a
great example because even in
that example there has to be
some t.
It's just another example.
Of how broad this bill is tr.
I mean we can talk about the gun
pieces of it and that's
troubling to but i'm concerned
how broad and how big this is.
Really trying to cripple any
kind of.
Meant yeah
members of the committee I think
it's important for all of us to
google at a form forty.
And.
That is the form that the must
fill out the purchase of firearm
and a lot of these questions I
think are answered in that form
just understanding.
What is asked of a person before
they pers.
Yes
representing the queen it's
eight year old forty four
seventy three.
Committee would repairs give a
motion for do you pass from a
representative martin.
Second by.
No.
No
yes.
Representative we yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
S.

conversation you have a
concluded I believe our session

we vocate probably having a
committee hearing on saturday.
What suspended.
So we will be meeting tomorrow
