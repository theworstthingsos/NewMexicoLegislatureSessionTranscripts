Madam chair let me let me see if
I've got hang on just a minute I
know she's out there I'm sorry
we are I mean it is that once I.
Thank you madam chair thank you
very much so we have heard this
bill and it has come back to our
committee Representative Ely
Hans and.
Wants to propose by
Representative.
I thank you madam chair so the
committee should have in front
of you I hope everybody's got it
it's
Two oh two number is two two
zero eight four four point one.
So and
madam chair and Sanchez okay if
I explain this now.
Yes okay so what we're calling
it is the post conviction rights
restoration Act it is
essentially deals with four
things one is is the
the right to vote serve on a
jury and serve in an office of
trust officer trust is defined
in the first in the in section
four as meeting Alexion
confirmation by the Senate
impeachment or discipline by
judges by judicial Stanford's
basically judges and politicians
are elected and cabinet members
The the bill does have within it
a provision that if you were
convicted of a felony that's no
longer a felony your rights are
automatically restored
Inc includes a section on
certificates of restoration and
then on the right server jury
they basically broken down in
three ways so when we talk about
a jury
in order to serve on a jury you
have to be able to show that you
completed all conditions of a
deferred sentence and a deferred
sentence is a fancy way of
saying you're temporarily
what what's the right word
your yeah it's not a permanent
education guilt is the easiest
way to say that on or you've
completed all conditions of the
sentence including probation or
parole or you receive a pardon
or some kind of certificate of
restoration of rights now for
voting it's different for voting
it is once you are released from
a correctional facility where
you have been imprisoned you
have the right to vote the other
ways you can go over the pardon
or demolition to begin
restoration rights for Office of
trust it's much more difficult
you have to receive a
restoration rights by operation
of law resulting in satisfaction
of conditions receive a pardon
or certificate a reservation of
rights and then there are
provisions in here for how the
secretary of state is to handle
voter registration wall people
are present and getting out
while they're in there Roach
there were there rights are they
do not have the right to vote
that I want to make crystal
clear but once they get out on
then they do have the right to
vote and with that madam chair I
would move whichever way you
sure would like either for
adoption of the amendment or for
the amendment for purposes of
discussion.
You've just discussed it so
let's move it for adoption.
And we can have a discussion on
it on the amendment.
Okay.
So is there a discussion.
We have a motion and a second to
stop it.
Seeing no discussion of the
clerk to call the roll please.
On adopting the amendment to
Senate bill one fourteen.
Thank.
Representative Armstrong yes.
Representative Cook.
Mr speaker yes.
Representative Ely yes.
Representative Lewis yes.
Representative McQueen yes.
Representative night.
Yes.
Representative Rehm no ma'am.
Representative Townsend.
Yes.
By Jessica Benham.
Yes.
Madam chair yes.
Nine two one and the amendment
is adopted.
Amended the second we have a
motion for it to pass through
the speaker on Senate bill
fourteen one fourteen is amended
a second Representative Eli.
Representative Rehm.
Thanks for discussion
Representative Rehm.
Madam chair I had to.
That I've reviewed and this one
that we have is shorter what is
the difference between the two
amendments.
Representative Eli madam chair I
have no idea what he's talking
about so he would have to refer
to the two oh two number all get
to the share file okay madam
chair the and Representative Ely
there is two two zero seven
eight nine point three madam
chair so that I don't spend the
time looking at it no distortion
can answer that question she's
one of the analysts on this if
we could let her answer and I'll
look it up in the meantime.
That's not be amended that we
adopted though now that's
correct she can explain the
differences madam chair.
Madam chair that was the one I
received last night founded and
share files.
I yeah and I'm familiar I I get
it I'm familiar with both of
them but ms Dorsey it would be
easier I think you missed or if
you go through we went through
together but I know she knows
this better than I do so madam
chair if it's okay with you I'd
like to turn it over to the
store see to give a technical
explanation.
I'm not sure where she.
Is.
Here madam chair right I think
that is okay good.
Thank you madam chair
representative bream thank you
for the question and happy to
answer it essentially there were
two versions of this amendment
as drafted the original version
and unfortunately I don't have
the two oh two numbers directly
in front of me Sir but the
longer version at initially
included a restoration of the
right to bear arms following
completion of a deferred
sentence and that section was
stricken from the shorter
amendment which I may have been
mistaken but I believe it was
the shorter amendment that
representative Ely intended to
propose in this committee for
adoption I hope that is the one
that was in fact opted so that
that section is not becoming
part of Senate bill one one four
in addition to that
Representative Rehm madam chair
the shorter version of the
amendment was also and placed in
format to more closely mirror
the language of the bill that
this committee had previously
heard on this issue what was
house bill seventy four
regarding the restoration of the
right to vote.
Yeah and I would just add to
that that just received right
the one that we get is the
shorter version that's correct
that would exclude the firearms
exception and and I think
frankly it was a little more
nuanced in terms of restoration
of rights to make sure we had it
correctly.
Madam chair and Representative
Ely if you're going to restore
all the rights wired you
restoring their right to bear
arms
madam chair I I don't know
really how to answer that or if
it's even appropriate you know
this has been the bill the
amendment has passed and at this
point the only the answer I
would give you just as I want to
make sure that we would be able
to do this in the most efficient
way possible and a lot of the
stuff involves technical issues
and so I just thought we're
running in place we mines will
get this done as quickly as
possible and I tried to
streamline everything and I just
felt that from the streamlined.
Madam chair and Representative
so on your amendment so it looks
why age for section eight.
R. when I read that if a person
is convicted of a felony but not
sentenced to prison.
That person can vote.
Right madam chair and
representative I'm sorry but we
voted on this amendment and now
you're asking me about the
amendment after we voted on I
think if you have questions this
point about the amendment you
should probably save them for
the floor but we're going back
to the moment that is already
passed this committee.
Okay if you don't want to
discuss the bill I guess we can
discuss it on the floor and
there's a technical player in
the in the.
Amendment I'll just hold it for
the floor okay thank you madam
chair thank you Representative.
We were we do have a motion and
a second toward you passed on
Senate bill one fourteen a
cement it.
So to call the roll please.
Representative Alcon.
Representative Armstrong yes.
Representative Cook.
Mr speaker just.
Representative Ely yes.
Representative Lewis yes.
Representative McLean.
Yes.
For Representative Nibert.
Representative.

have a two passes amended.
Thank you very much thank you
Representative role metal.

each other in person in
insurance.
Have a great.
My allergies are as bad as yours
Representative Eli

Representative you madam chair I

get Representative
The committee here because she
has Senate bill one ninety six
manages to.
Many small are you here on
Senate bill eight I am madam
chair yeah I I.
All right Representative David
small go ahead.
in.
Everybody in advance.
We will be cutting our public
comment today to.
Because we have so much to get
done and we have a lot of people
counting on us to your bills are
over the Senate and they're
trying to get those through.
And these Senate bills have had
at least two hearings two public
hearings prior to this.
So with that I just want to let
people know in advance go ahead
with Senate bill eight
Representative small thank you.
Thank you very much madam chair
and committee Senate finance
committee substitute for Senate
bill eight madam chair really
allows the state of New Mexico
to safeguard its citizens in
ways that are appropriate for
the state of New Mexico and not
constrained by the set by the
federal government madam chair
and committee currently
the environmental improvement
board the Albuquerque Bernalillo
county air quality board and
other
Local entities who wish to our.
Protect their residents at the
behest of their residents are
with air quality issues for
instance are unable madam chair
and committee to ensure that
their residents enjoy the sorts
of protections that those
residents need if those
protections are not explicitly
authorized madam chair and
committee by the federal
government.
In the same way madam chair and
committee when it comes to the
hat leaving air quality going
over to the hazardous waste act.
the environmental improvement
board currently has to confirm
that federal exist federal
regulations are insufficient
before the environmental
improvement board can work to
better put in place appropriate
protections for local residents
Madam chair in committee the
final piece is.
Allowing.
Requiring that the environmental
proven board and local boards to
address ozone pollution.
Madam chair and committee when
national ambient air quality
standards are elevated.
in in in in basically
streamlines the ability for the
environmental improvement board
to do this I do we will have
expert witnesses today
including I believe miss easily
And I would just note madam
chair committee the
the committee's time is
incredibly valuable and
constrained right now.
At the end of the day madam
chair and committee this allows
New Mexico to protect New
Mexicans in ways that are
appropriate to New Mexico and to
be less constrained in in some
cases out ride prevented from
taking necessary protections for
New Mexicans because the federal
government has not explicitly
authorized those actions when it
comes to air quality.
Doximity of hazardous waste and
things of that nature.
Madam chair committee
I don't know if miss easily
wants to add anything again we
know the committee's time is
incredibly incredibly valuable
I would also known I would
imagine we go into it there were
substantial amendments in the
Senate finance committee
substitute for Senate bill eight
and with that madam chair I
would if it's your pleasure of
turnover to Missy we briefly and
thank you very much for having
us on today.
Yes go ahead this is really.
Madam chair members of the
committee I am here to service
technical expert I have no
opening comments but happy to
answer questions as they arise.
All right thank you very much I
I will go to we will do a ten
second call and then I'd like to
limit comments to five minutes
on each side so I really want
you to choose carefully is going
to Representative your remarks
okay so let's go to the hold
now.
We'll have it up for ten seconds
those in favor of Senate bill
eight respond yes those in
opposition based on now.
Okay we have fifty nine percent
favor and.
Forty one percent in opposition.
Let me see.
We have.
In opposition to I have to
Winchester.
Thank you madam chair Preciado
it independent patrolmen's
association of New Mexico a
service or executive director
three quick points on this bill
we oppose it we feel it gives
the state unilateral forty to
create rules more stringent than
the federal government and
considering that recent federal
leasing and permitting
moratoriums that's pretty
chilling up bill also creates
two sets of complex rules those
for the Feds and for state lands
we fear this duality
disproportionately punishes
small operators in third this
bill if passed has the potential
to circumvent hundreds of
thousands of precious work hours
spent by independence an
industry working on new methane
rules we want to commend this
administration for that effort
but we fear that this bill up
circumvents that process so
thank you we do stand opposed.
And then in opposition.
Let me see.
Susan Sherman you're not in
opposition are you.
No I'm not I would like to
support sorry hold on that
and Verity.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee I will just
reiterate what Jim Winchester
said we do you feel like you
know that executive has sat the
most ambitious goals for methane
regulation and we have with our
members work tires Leslie to
ensure the success of those
goals so I appreciate your
consideration no other strongly
opposes this L. okay.
Patrick.
Helen.
Go ahead.
Thank you madam chair committee
members Patrick Killen
registered lobbyists for chevron
chevron respectfully but
strongly opposes Senate bill
eight chevrons is not support
the broad sweeping grant of
authority that this legislation
will get to the environment from
board without any checks and
balances or guardrails cost or
effectiveness we do not view
this legislation it's current
form as promoting good
governance we oppose it strongly
on that basis we urge you to
vote no on Senate bill eight
thank you for your time.
I have Michael Miller.
And carbon because still will be
after that.
Good morning good afternoon
madam chair members of the
committee Mike Miller with the
Permian basin petroleum
association we have the same
concerns that have been voiced
by the other speakers and and
strongly oppose this.
In in one of the biggest reasons
is as was pointed out is all the
work is been done on the methane
rule we are concerned that that
will circumvent all that work
thank you madam chair.
Thank you.
The last with it in opposition
Harbin.
Additional.
Go ahead.
Good afternoon Madam chairman
members my name is Gordon
Casteel and I'm the registered
lobbyists for centennial
resource development and all the
gas operator in Lee County New
Mexico.
I'm actually speaking for one of
the smaller operators like
centennial it's not just the
bigger operators that are
opposed to this bill it is a
smaller guys like my clients as
well we are we do for all the
ages at before we respectfully
oppose this legislation asking
about that thank you very much.
Okay.
support I I know I would
Make it brief another call on a
few people and boats.
Organizations in the call and
Judy comment from Audubon.
I'm Judy W..
There you are okay go ahead
Judy.
Good morning madam chair can you
hear me yes okay good morning
madam chair members of the
committee this is Judy COVID and
while most of you know me as the
New Mexico policy director for
the Audubon society I also sit
on the Albuquerque Bernalillo
county air quality control board
and I'm speaking to you today as
a member of the board but not
speaking for the board as a
whole I'm air quality New Mexico
is regulated by the state's
environmental improvement board
accepted Bernalillo county where
it's regulated by us at the air
quality control board.
Regulations being drastically
and dangerously rolled back it's
not hypothetical we saw it
happen over and over again in
the last administration and that
could easily happen again in the
future in a different
administration to because the
current state statute says that
we can't be more stringent than
the federal standards Senate
bill it would ensure that state
and federal right and local
regulators could still protect
New Mexico from things like
increased ozone even if federal
regulations are diminished and I
just want to say that
Albuquerque faces some unique
issues as the largest urban area
of the state and so this would
help us please consider
addressing some of those in a
way that we can't currently that
are at thank you.
Okay I'm.
Not to step still I'm sure.
Did she disappear okay go ahead
please.
Yes hello can you hear me yes
yes thank you apologies on madam
chair and members the committee
thank you for the opportunity to
speak in strong support of S. P.
eight our earth works oil and
gas accountability project
supports the bill because it
reaffirms state regulatory
flexibility and authority.
Federal regulations have always
been intended to be a floor
below which states cannot go and
not a ceiling that prevents
states from being more ambitious
and effective on behalf of its
own residents by removing just
four words no more stringent
than from the state air quality
control and hazardous waste acts
SB eight would allow New Mexico
to pursue more effective perfect
protective and locally sensitive
policies I'm for decades New
Mexico is unfortunately been
hamstrung by those four words
and so it is for these reasons
that SB eight it's been passed
by the Senate and we ask you to
do the same thank you very much
for your time.
David Harney on.
Yes madam chair members of the
committee thank you David how to
be a registered lobbyist for the
City of Albuquerque the City of
Albuquerque strongly supports
this important legislation that
is aimed at addressing some of
the unique issues that miss
Kallman addressed about
Albuquerque and Bernalillo
county specifically on on air
quality issues in the final set
and other self valley
communities that are unique to
Albuquerque and that or
vulnerable on but based upon
changes in the federal regime
and federal federal regulation
this would allow our local
control to address local issues
impacting some of our most at
risk and disadvantaged
communities and for those
reasons we ask that you pass
this legislation so that those
communities are not at risk
thank you.
So.
A lot of hands up and they've
got more than I can really take
that but I would like to do is
give you an opportunity just to
state that your organizations

Health Action New Mexico a few
committee or state complains

Thank you madam chair this is JD
Bullington speaking on behalf of
the greater Albuquerque chamber
of commerce I wanted to make a
comment opposition it gender up
so to start
late.
I'm sorry.
Real fast I think you have the
greater of a cookie chamber of
commerce urges the committee to
not allow local jurisdictions to
impose regulations that are more
stringent than federal
regulations that chamber
believes that we can easily end
up with poorly crafted an
unnecessarily onerous and
punitive regulations in cities
and counties across the state so
we urge we're it's this bill to
be tabled thank you.
It.
Miller.
I already spoke I apologize okay
sorry C. N. B. U..
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is lily
Anna because deal with Cobb and
for all the reasons previously
stated we support the bill and
urged committee to vote yes
thank you.
Okay let's go back to the
committee now.
And.
The state didn't.
Representative small did you
have anything to say before we
go to comments from the
committee.
I'm.
Thank you madam chair no
we stand at the committees okay
first I have representative
Nibert and representative and
then speaker if all
Representative Nibert.
Thank you madam chair arms.
Madam chair representative of.
Looking at this legislation.
I see that there's.
The potential for.
Two groups of people to.
R. imposes more stringent
regulations Representative the
the E. R. B. and local boards of
baby created am I reading that
correctly.
I'm.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Nyberg
specifically with the
Albuquerque air quality board
they would be empowered to do
that yes.
Well what other local
communities be able to establish
secretary of.
Or.
Madam chair I would look to
missing the for technical.
Chair members of the committee
representative Nibert the air
quality control acts confines
with a local board is.
That is defined as a county that
was a classe county as of
January first nineteen eighty or
municipality with a population
greater than one hundred
thousand located within a county
that was across state county as
of January first nineteen eighty
so as currently drafted only
Bernalillo in Albuquerque could
be a local have a local agency
and have a local board.
So a good number of pages of
this bill are really an affable
to everywhere but Albuquerque is
that correct.
Madam chair representative
generally yes.
So the.
Counties other than Bernalillo
county they are looking solely
to.
The E. I'd be for potential
rulemaking that's going to
impose potentially more
stringent standards even though
everybody talked about having
local.
Control over this issue.
Is that correct.
Madam chair representative it
Missy they may be able to add to
that.
Madam chair representative
Nibert it only applies to the
IBM local board it does not
apply to individual counties.
So basically unless you live in
Bernalillo county there is no
local control over this issue as
proclaimed by by many of the
people speaking in favor.
And my understanding legislation
broadly.
Madam chair members of the
committee this is about state
control there could be local
rules that apply to a local
county that the E. I. B. could
adopt for example we're working
on so roll right now that apply
to seven counties and not
statewide.
Okay but but the folks in wake
county the folks in Travis
county reform sanity County
We have no ability to to impose
local rules for even I just I
can't comment on the rules but
they they really don't have this
real seat at the table on our
measures that may be implemented
statewide in Albuquerque or an
area of by the at the I.
If I now am I understanding this
correctly is not really allowing
local control.
And so basically what this bill
does is allow the E. I'd be to
impose statewide standards maybe
accepting Bernalillo county
That are more stringent than the
federal standards.
And that would be true even just
the local community I was
satisfied with the federal
standards would that be accurate
or.
Madam chair representative messy
we.
Madam chair representative
Nibert that is accurate.
And that's that's my real
concern
Last night on the bill the point
was made that you know one thing
that we need.
It is regulatory certainty in
order to have
Business or industry that the is
willing to invest capital in our
communities and.
I certainly see this piece of
legislation as imposing
regulatory uncertainty
particularly yes it's only
Albuquerque they get staff local
control everybody else is going
to be subject to a potential
role by that's going to budget
Impose regulations that are
are affected statewide and I
think I have thirty some years
of experience about which
direction that we're blows
artistry
and it's not usually from late
for our quarter of the state
so.
What the conclusion is not
withstanding the comments this
does not allow us to pursue
local word.
Our sensitive policies regarding
air quality and I are you for
that reason I stand opposed to
it and I'm really concerned
about the messaging app that
we're sending to
the industry that.
Certainly supports the economies
of of.
Most if not all of the
communities in southeast New
Mexico where are thank you madam
chair.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Because of the supportive
message that this bill sends to
communities throughout New
Mexico that the legislature
cares about them having clean
air I move you do pass.

from the speaker.

thousand sixteen and twenty of
federal legislation a state
legislation has come down this

Senator Lopez
related to this legislation we
do recognize that there has been
numerous federal laws that have
been passed since the last time

children's code and so we would
like to participate in it you

we in our alignment with some of
the new federal legislation
first prevention services act as
a big one that was passed in

some changes for us to be able
to comply with that legislation
specifically in regards to
judicial hearings that have to

And in the members of the

list Representative nightmare.
Thank you madam chair just one
question
Madam chair and and
Representative was the
appropriation part of the.
Of budget bill.
Madam chair and representative
Nibert yes it was it's included
in US Senate bill three seventy.
Okay thank you madam chair.
Thank you.
Any other questions.
Let me just make an observation
before we take action on this
you know we had a number of
bills.
The two of the abuse and neglect
system and CYFD and it occurred
to me that perhaps even this.
Particular.
This.
Reform task force might actually
either stimulate an Avenue for
discussion of some of those
ideas or perhaps
Itself Sir at in that way I know
we had
We had a number of bills that
had a huge fiscal impact that we
didn't even get to hear in here
because they weren't going to
appropriations state and they
were so complex and seeking so
many solutions that it seems and
and then we have the one aware
of this related to the cabin
just Madam it it just seems to
be that perhaps some of those
things can be
unders.
One or discussion during the
time that this task forces
meeting so that was my idea and
vice chair hasn't come it.
Did you pass on SB one ninety
six.
We have a motion for do passed
and I will second that motion.
But we do it right.
Just.
Are already amended
okay
okay about

is a further discussion.
The clerk to call the roll.

thank you members of the
committee thank you very much.
Senate bill three sixty seven.
And is that here Representative
Eli madam chair I am here for
Senate bill three eighty seven
okay sixty seven and two sixty
six I will be playing the parts
of Senators works for one case
Ivey Soto and thank.
okay Sager.
That.
That was deserved.
So you're running the table
today here yes I believe I am
okay you madam chair you want to
start with three eighty seven.
Bank account.
And I'm I want you to be sure to
check our analyses on that I
have not I apologize I think.
In this.
On that I and that I have that
so attention all right madam
chair members the committee what
this is what what the safer it
what Senate bill three eighty
seven as amended is intended to
do is to fix a hole in our
campaign reporting system so
what's happened is and we're
seeing it in CD one is that
people serving in the
legislature are at the same time
running for federal office and
raising funds so this is
intended to fix that hole I have
not looked at the analysis and I
apologize for that but
I'm looking at the amended
version itself are they came out
of the Senate came to us are so
require that someone who is
serving for example in the
legislature or the governor's
office we as governor would
matter who is also a candidate
for a federal law office during
the period of time that we are
in the legislature would be
required to have a segregated
bank account and filed those
let's see file within two days
after the end of each ten day
period
the idea really building
allowing people to raise money I
have transparency in the process
and I think that's why senator
Wirth is carrying this is it is
really to fix a hole in our
system where people are serving
in office with a blackout period
while the same time raising
money that is appropriate for a
federal office
and so that's why it's amending
the campaign reporting
requirements of section one dash
nineteen twenty seven point
three.
With that madam chair all stand
for questions and I can start
and there is an emergency clause
attached to this as well so that
Madam will stand for questions.
Okay let's just go to the
audience real quickly is there
of those to the Paul really.
Yes Senate bill three eighty
seven to ten second call helicon
please wait in if you have an
opinion.
We have exactly well we have two
people in favor of one in
opposition let's give them a
chance to weigh in if they would
like to do so you would like to
speak please raise your hands.
No apparently nobody wants to
We're
not.
Let me see Representative
McQueen I have you first.
Sessions.
Thank you madam chair Madam
chair representative Ely my
understanding is.
It's not that we're allowing
them to raise money because they
are allowed to raise money
because initially it federal
preemption issue.
We're just asking them to keep
that money separate from their
state funds is that correct yes
that is that is exactly right if
I misstated that I didn't need
to that is correct chair
representative.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
Representative Albert.
Thank you madam chair
I appreciate the question
Representative three masters of
that is the intention I'm
wondering.
Yes on page five paragraphs the.
Thank you for.
graphs we.
Yes of the all age four of the
bill but I amendments of
contacts yeah I was on the DL
give me just a second let me go
to that I was accent the bill
itself I was going to be I have
the equipment to conduct pulled
out I thought I better pull that
out give me just a moment I will
pull it paid for the bill or
page five on amendments and
contacts.
That basically is the additional
language and it says.
Your contributions deposit of
segregated bank out it's not
used to fund independent or
coordinated expenditures are
made contributions to a can of
campaign committee or political
committee.
Now think about that.
Madam chair representative.
The funds are being raised for a
federal cafe.
But the language here says of
the contributions.
For more contributions to a
candidate that I suppose
themselves.
Campaign committee I suppose
their campaign or political
committee.
probably again are their their
own committee and so I'm not
sure the language.
Gets people where they need to
be and the the other concern I
have Madam chair representative
the prohibition for us as
legislators is not to solicit
funds during the blackout period
because of the.
Potential for impropriety
It it it seems to me that that
role is your is apropos
regardless of.
Whether you're running for
federal office or state office
or anything else during that
time
We should be soliciting funds
and that doesn't prohibit a
campaign committee from
soliciting funds it just means
that the cannabis capsules of
farms if they are a Senate
legislator so.
Our our rules the
We're standing legislation I
think you're still program but
that the legislator from
Celestin campaigns during that
time and I don't see anything in
this bill.
That would override those rules
so I'm not sure that this
legislation gets people are
where they obviously want or
need to go and
I'll just throw that out there
I am sure Matt Matt something on
this point.
Yes.
So madam chair I think there's
understanding is a
misunderstanding so the bill has
nothing to do with federal
candidates the the purpose of
the bill.
Is to require organizations that
accept contributions and make
expenditures.
Of two varieties to keep the two
varieties there funds and
separate accounts so there are
organizations and the state
campaign reporting act and under
federal law that are hybrid
organizations they receive money
and they do things that are not
subject to reporting with those
funds and they do things are
subject reporting with funds
raised this bill requires those
hybrid organizations to maintain
separate bank accounts.
One bank account for funds that
are expended do not need to be
reported and the second bank
account for funds that do need
to be reported under the
campaign reporting act that's
the bills.
The amendment that was added on
the floor the Senate does not
restrict.
State legislators for raising
money when they're running for
Congress the floor amendment in
the Senate.
Says that if you are a
legislator.
If you are seeking federal
office you must report every ten
days during the prohibited
period any funds that you raised
for your federal race.
That's it.
So it's not a restriction this
idea of segregated bank accounts
is not it has nothing to do with
legislators running for federal
office so this segregated
accounts.
Section of the bill only applies
to those hybrid organizations
that under the law are allowed
to make some expenditures
subject reporting.
Some expenditures not subject
reporting that's where the
segregated bank account comes
from.
There is never there never has
been is not now and likely never
will be any circumstance under
which funds raised for
legislative races are co mingled
with funds raised for federal
office.
Madam chair representative Ely
Representative Nibert because
they are governed one by in one
instance by the secretary state
of New Mexico in the other
instance by the Federal Election
Commission it is against state
and federal law to co mingle
funds for federal races with
funds for state races you can't
do it under the laws of New
Mexico or under the laws of the
United States so I I just want
to I think folks are getting
confused about the floor
amendment which has nothing to
do with the segregated account
yeah I'm Madam chair in this
really goes back to
Representative in the queens are
questions of me I think I didn't
I I didn't intend to but I think
I did the state so I think
that's correct isn't working it
finally madam chair there is at
least one opinion of the New
Mexico Attorney General that the
state of New Mexico lacks
authority to prohibit a
candidate for federal office
from raising money
are in compliance with and
pursuant to the laws of the
United States so that is that is
why.
Members of the legislature and
the governor who are the state
elected officials.
Subject to the prohibited period
are permitted to raise funds
under the rules and laws of the
Federal Election Commission The
speaker office.
Mr speaker in the
Our committee analysis which
everybody should have access to.
This commission.
Raised a question.
That is the Senate floor
amendment pertains to
fundraising activities for
federal campaigns it's such it
would be subject to preemption
by federal election laws.
Yeah I mean I eat.
Madam chair I don't know that.
I mean I I can't really speak to
that you know I do think that
the state can impose
requirements on members of the
legislature.
Right did you know that if you
want to and that's what this is
doing.
Right it's saying if you are a
legislator.
You're not restricted in fund
raising for federal office if
you're going to do so as a
condition of being and
legislator.
You need to report every ten
days.
The funds that you are raising
fear federal campaign.
I do think it's worth noting
that the ethics commission
weighed in on this and what I'll
do is is get out of this
committee and it looks like it's
something that would not be
that would be preempted we might
consider and then that although
it is separate from the rest of
the act if if the court decided
that but I'd like to get
together with the ethics
commission see their thought
process as it it's the floor so
I I do think we're getting an
independent analysis that let me
let me take a look at that if he
gets out of here I'll deal with
that on the floor and I'll get
with representatives Niagara
McQueen to satisfy their
concerns.
Madam chair thank you thank you
Mr speaker for the fire
protection I.
I have not the
tumble that and and was
concerned that this was an
effort to deal with the current
situation of not just one but we
have multiple.
cannabis currently in the
legislature who are running for
federal office on both sides of
the aisle.
And this is certainly an issue
that's before us so we need to
make sure we get it right and
I if you are satisfied does
that.
fine I was just reading it from
that perspective and the
obviously.
In that context is not thank you
got us where we needed to go but
all up I'll be happy to work
with the representative at the
yes clarification make sure that
before it's it's what we we have
those signs.
Fully understood thank you madam
chair thank you Representative
thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you for that schooling.
So I think we all need what's
the pleasure of the committee.
The past we have a motion for
two passed from the speaker also
from representative Ely for the
discussion.
This call the roll.
Representative occurring.
Yes.
Representative Armstrong yes.
Representative Cook yes.
Mr speaker.
Yes.
Representative Ely yes.
Representative Lewis yes.
Representative McQueen.
Yes.
Representative nine.
Yes.
Representative Rehm yes.
Representative Townsend.
Yes.
Yes.
Madam chair yes.
Twelve to zero we have a due
pass.
Very good thank you very much
will move on to the Senate bill
three sixty seven.
thank you madam chair members of
the committee so this bill.
Word create an independent
constitutional revision
Committee the first thing to
note is there is an
appropriation here I ask Senator
lodges about that the hundred
fifty thousand dollars is
already in the budget to pay for
this commission
so basically what they're doing
is is there going through kind
of that.
The constitution itself to see
if there are and and I'll just
read from section three to
recommend changes if desired and
necessary our review findings
from the nineteen sixty seven
constitutional revision
commission the sixty nine
constitutional provision our
country's religion and the
ninety four constitutional
convention
this is not a constitutional
convention yet this is a
commission set up to make
recommendations to the
legislature to see if this is
something we should be doing
what recommendations that would
make it's important to note that
if we decided to do this it does
not take away from once this is
passed if the commission came
back with any recommendations
for a constitutional convention
my recollection is I think I'm
right about this is that both
chambers would have to approve
that by a two thirds vote of
that's not in this bill I
believe that's in the
constitution itself in terms of
convention but this is the
predecessor that to make
recommendations to the
commission with that madam chair
will stand for questions.
The band's first and we'll have
a ten second call to state those
in favor on Senate bill three
sixty seven and I was in
opposition to all.
Fifty fifty.
One H..
Anybody wish to speak.
I'm Senate bill three sixty
seven all right let's go back to
the committee Representative Mr
speaker we do pastor for.
With a motion for two passed
from.
The speaker.
Second from representative Ely
on the second.
Questions for the committee.
there is a question madam chair
that I got by text it is the
state constitution of the
Federal.
Should make that clear.
Right right.
Okay good deal all right.
Let's we have a motion in the
second and nobody has a hand
raised so let's take the role.
Representative okay.
What did.
Hello yes it is.
Representative Armstrong I'm
kind of the same as
Representative al cone okay.
Representative Cook yes.
Mr speaker.
Yes.
Representative Eli.
Yes.
Representative Lewis yes.
Representative McQueen.
Yes Representative nightmare.
No.
Your goals.
Representative Rehm.
Representative.
No ma'am.
Representative Townsend and
then.
Yes.
Madam chair.
I needed myself
Yes I want to what.
Suggest something for the floor.
About.
Ninety three we have to pass.
Okay I am sorry I am I am so far
behind this morning I had I'll
binge reading
Apparently the floor amendment.
Three public member shall be in.
At the governor also know to
should be logged the same
political party.
So.
Yes No can be from the same
party does that mean you have to
find a third party somewhere so
I think that there may be a need
for some clarity.
And Representative one if you
want to take that back to the
Senator yeah sure.
And it.
It Senate Majority analysis
okay.
We'll do.
Thank you all right.
Moving on here to Senate bill
two sixty six.
Is that you as well.
Yes I'm afraid it is madam
chair.
Okay.
all right
I I just got a call shortly
before the hearing from Senator
Ivey Soto and I want to members
to know that I asked him what
what I say about this bill in
the Senate I'm moving to pass so
let me see if I can walk you
through this
really what the problem is
becoming as is that all the
judges seem to be running at
once for retention and so we're
getting these overwhelming
ballots particularly in a place
like Bernalillo county so what
we're trying to do is provide
some continuities what I'm
taking the purpose of this bill
is about is to provide some
continuity with the judiciary
where you have staggered terms
so there really to changes to
the current statute if you look
at one dash twenty six that I it
says it just really two
paragraphs the initial term of
office for a newly created
District Court judgeship shall
be staggered in accordance with
the provisions of subsection B.
of the section even if it
results in the short term
and so it's subsection B. goes
to that you're gonna start
staggering terms on it the the
term of office for division one
every third division will be
every six years so the idea
beginning in twenty twenties
expired twenty twenty six the
ideas as we move forward
starting to appoint judges some
of them will be serving for
shorter terms and then I have to
run for retention that's going
to happen at the beginning but
eventually they'll serve out
full terms but the ideas is I
mean Bernalillo county is
becoming a huge problem because
people are serving for retention
we're gonna have as Albuquerque
gets bigger I mean we're likely
to have twenty thirty or more
people on one ballot for one
general election and it just
creates havoc with the judiciary
that they're having all of their
members said it wants for
retention so the.
Ideas to start to stagger the
terms and at some point we just
kind of begin by starting with
shorter terms and then they
eventually serve their full
terms as the it retains with
that madam chair and members of
the committee Austin for
questions.
Let's go to the.
And see if there is anyone here
would like to wait in line so go
to sixty six I will have a ten
second pull we'll start that
now.
Okay we have hundred percent in
favor a total of two people is
there anyone who wishes to
speak.
Senator yes.
thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name
Cydney Ted and I am the
associate director with common
cause New Mexico we'd like to
thank the bill's sponsors for
being forced this necessary
important legislation choosing
state court judges is a
consequential decision for
voters our state courts have
approved profound impact on our
state legal and political
landscapes in twenty twenty
voters across the state
overwhelmingly supported
proposition to the staggering of
non statewide offices which
includes members of the
judiciary with sixty four
percent of the vote Senate bill
two sixty six not only allows
judges to be placed on the
ballot for retention every two
years but allows for a better
evaluation system of judges a
shorter ballot for voters as
Representative Eli mention an
added level of protection for
our judiciary thank you so much
and please support Senate bill
two sixty six.
Thank you very much I don't have
any other hands right so let's
go back to the committee.
And
See if we've got.
I don't see any committee
members with questions.
I moved to pass.
The motion for two passed from.
Representative Ely a second
Representative Nibert.
Their discussion Representative
Rehm grant.
Your in order analysis it says
or might be a problem with the
judicial appointments.
That's when you're gonna have to
probably take up with
the senator.
I just want to point that out
thank you.
It is that which you are
addressing representative Ely
when someone's going to have not
a full term this yeah I know I I
Representative Reese point on a
look at I was it's interesting
because I think it's an
excellent point and it's
something I didn't address that
I I didn't think about it
totally mention of when you have
an appointment you're going to
fill out
you know in the middle of the
term you would fill out that
judges
terms so I don't know that
Senator Ivy Soto is thought
about that it's an excellent
point I've got all these notes
to take Senators with bills so I
will definitely be visiting
Senator Ivy Soto about that and
I think that's Representative
range point but I'm not sure.
Thank you thank you
Representative.
Thanks Tom Dow for that.
Putting that out to.
Representative Alcon.
Thank you thank you madam chair
I guess.
We'll see this newly appointed
judge basically guaranteed a
short term.
This legislation.
It's not a guarantee but it's
pretty much so.
Madam chair and representative
so first my apologies for not
going to be very few so
Representative is not happy with
the.
So so
what I wanted to tell you is
yeah I think that's correct I
mean at some point particularly
in a place like Albuquerque
we're gonna have to bite the
bullet in the only way to do
that it seems to me is what's in
the statute is that the options
going to have to be available
for shorter first term and then
the judge would stand for
retention and serves on the full
term but I think that's right
and it's the only way of
creating staggered terms.
Thank you thank you madam chair.
Thank you okay we are on a
motion.
Right.
Your last track of things okay
will the court please call the
roll.
Representative Alcon yes.
Representative Armstrong yes.
Representative could.
Representative Cook.
Mr speaker I'll.
Representative Ely yes.
Representative Lewis yes.
Representative McQueen yes.
Representative Nibert.
Yes.
Representative Rehm yes
Representative.
Representative Townsend.
Thank.
Yes.
Madam chair.
Yes.
You're gonna vote yes to please.
Eight votes Representative Cook.
I'm accepting it hello thank you
thank you madam chair.
Eleven to one we have to do
pass.
Okay very good all I see the
Senator got here just in time.
Thank you.
Committee members.
Senator Ivey Soto is there if I
could make is he still there
madam chair.
You see here yeah yeah Madam
chair Senator telling me to take
up the committee's time but I do
want you to have in your had a
question was raised about what
happens with appointed judges
say in the middle of a term and
what happens with that I'm
assuming they would serve out
the term certainly go actually
so the term is a six year term
and so someone is appointed to
halfway through the term they
would serve the the rest of that
term that is the status quo what
happens.
That was that was clarified by
the right field sudden decision
that that the appointment does
not create a new six years it is
up to the completion of the
current six years I'm not sure
if I could ask Representative
lean if that answered his
question.
and Representative I think it
would be best if we do have calm
down speak about it have him
come in he had a issue for.
He's always here with us to do
is a native south.
Thank you madam chair so the
issue that I
raise session is that the court
very clearly stated in ruling.
In that case there are article.
For.
Provisions for the judiciary
prohibit state your terms.
And the question that a court
would be faced is interpreting
whether the general provisions
of article twenty adopted last
November
our.
And.
The specific provisions of
article four.
He is a leader in acted.
That might.
The court in favor of saying
that that overrides article four
but since the amendments that
were passed by the.
Citizens when adapting it the
article twenty amendments.
We're not.
Directly addressed to the
language in article for
regarding terms of office which
states that judges have to be
elected in like manner.
And for six year terms
Raise a question the court may
have to answer a if this is
adopted
because there the court in
levels and was very specific
that article four prohibits
STACR terms.
And that would be the
constitutional question that
would be.
Facing the court if this.
Legislation is adopted and if
any of the current serving judge
wants to challenge the state
requires a reduction of his term
of office.
And madam chair I will just
point out that that particular
constitutional provision I
believe it's article six section
thirty four I remember correctly
in like manner exist and
subsection C. with reference to
the different judges however in
like manner also exist in
subsection eight and subsection
be what's referred to the
Supreme Court and court of
appeals and they are already
staff part so in fact in like
manner does not mean that they
cannot be stagnant because we
already staff or the Supreme
Court will respect the court of
appeals and they are elected in
like manner thank you.

going back and forth between
three different committees are

I thought we were on a table in
motion I voted no I would like
to be recorded as voting yes on
the bill I apologize I've been

back and forth between three
committees and this was a
A risk of that practice so if I
could please be recorded is a
yes on the bill I would
appreciate it.
