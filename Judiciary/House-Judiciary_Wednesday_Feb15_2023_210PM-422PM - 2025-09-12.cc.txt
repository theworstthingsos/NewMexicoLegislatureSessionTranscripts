There.
Representative Nibert.
Representative read here
Representative Rehm here ma'am
Representative is the Penske.
Madam vice chair here madam
chair here.
Yep.
Thank you so just to recap just
to recap where we are we had
house joint resolution held over
from Monday.
The presenters had presented in
the public comment period had
occurred so we are complete with
that portion of the bill
presentation before we go to the
committee I I would like to give
a few minutes if so desire to
Representative Rubio to see if
she has anything else you'd like
to say before we go to the
committee thank you madam chair
I think it's pretty
straightforward I just will
apologize that all I've had
today's coffee and chips which I
think we've reached that point
in the session so if I'm a bit
jittery that's that is why.
Why I will stand for questions
thank you for that full
disclosure I would ask that
members not provide similar
disclosures because we'll be
here for awhile
so thank you for The
presentation we really
appreciate all the work that you
and other members have been
doing over the interim to try to
address is super important issue
so thank you for that questions
or comments from.
our committee members
Representative ream thank you
madam chair and
So.
Basically if we look at what the
retirement is across the country
we go to New Hampshire it's a
hundred dollars if we go to New
York state who just raise
there's two hundred and forty
nine thousand.
But
I think the.
The issue here is.
What compensation do we need.
And when we look at what we
currently have we have per diem
I think that it's you know
really close to covering
expenses I agree that we all go
ahead and take time off from our
work to go ahead and come up
here.
And I kind of think that's what
the founding fathers saw you
know is a civic duty.
And that's the way I see it you
know it's my civic duty to come
in and help the state not.
This is a career that I need to
be and and I'm gonna make money.
The other thing the legislature
has is it has a retirement for
your years of service so we we
receive compensation from that
after we retire.
And I say that because when we
look at.
What happened to our founding
fathers believe.
And all the money they got
interjected in the salaries in
Washington and now the
dysfunction of Washington.
Hi I don't want to see us go
down that path.
So I I think we need more staff
totally agree and I think that
could be up here at you know in
Santa Fe during the interim to
go ahead and help out
maybe some little bump in of per
diem for expenses things are
more expensive but madam chair I
can't support the legislation
for those reasons thank you.
Representative any on
Representative Alcon.
Thank you madam chair you know
I've been problem I just I've
been looking at this in my heart
rate over this one is that.
We're really going out and
asking the public.
Do you feel like somebody.
To give us a salary.
Really let us the public to give
us a salary.
And the to me that's like a
I don't know I don't know how to
say it.
Look like a chicken way of a
trying to run around this
subject without coming direct.
That's what my problem is the
big problem is there the other
thing is.
We're asking for a salary rivets
and we're going to get a salary
we're going to get a per we're
going to get per diem also.
And you heard my story before
Representative you really
Representative Chasey.
Of one year I was a state
legislator.
Which means that I attended more
committee meetings and anybody
else.
And I got more per diem than
anybody at the general meeting
big thing about that.
During the show to be building
David included my retirement and
I'll I was the highest paid
legislator in the state of New
Mexico.
And the.
My brother still has a copy of
that would make out of that we
don't get paid for some things
look at what to do and.
And the.
That part about it is after all
of that.
I had an opponent and guess what
is the.
Flyers were.
Alcorn is raking in the cash at
the go flyer showed me you can
then money.
But I mean I I like the player
myself if that.
It is of those problems I mean I
I really.
I I don't know I just have a
problem with not going out they
Rick is a.
voters.
Is that okay we get salary.
That for my big problem is I can
just go ahead and say let's put
this on the ballot given the
legislative salary.
And leave it at that of the
say no fine they say yes then we
get a salary but to go ask you
to avoid the commission to the
commission can decide.
If we're going to make money or
not.
We think it's fair.
Thank you madam.
Representative Chasey and at did
you want to be on the list okay.
Okay thank you madam chair and
thank you Representative Rubio
I am.
What I really appreciate this
how those of you who are
involved in this effort
representatives Garrett Sarinana
which has added a.
They have worked so hard to try
to do this
Intellectually and and honestly
and and look at that research
and and so forth so I really
appreciate that I think the
You madam this is research
institute did a good job on fund
the study it's even though it's
not finished yet.
But I was kinda smiling when
Representative Rehm said the
founding fathers consider
whether a lot of mothers here.
Happen to so I I'm not to two
weeks is to be left out of that
although it was a bunch of men
landed.
Pretty owners in the beginning
who did all the voting in the
deciding and so forth so how we
muscled our way through that
to be able to say something or
do something.
I appreciate the fact that.
People view it as
from your point of view.
That to your point of view of
dedication also means you have
the privilege to do that you
don't have.
You're not in a situation where
your family will get the rent
paid or the bills paid.
If you do it.
And so even though.
The.
I'm not rich or of and wasn't
rich or retire and never have it
and and sort of retired now
All right it was a hardship.
It was harder on my career than
had I gone to work for of a big
law firm and I did I couldn't do
that and serve and I preferred
to serve so I I don't think
You know I I just think people
have to recognize that while we
talk about it being a privilege
to be elected it is that people
trust us with their votes but we
don't necessarily want those who
hold the office too
All the so privileged that we
don't understand.
What the
all people from all walks of
life experience so I ate I am
not offended at the thought of
of paying legislators and I
think it's
It's certainly worth asking the
voters what's interesting is
the study that was done.
I don't remember the percentage
but a vast majority of our
citizens believe we are paid.
And I didn't I was thinking too
about the fact that we do have a
good retirement program you
don't get it till after you've
been here a really long time and
retire so you it doesn't feature
family why you're here it
doesn't do anything for your
medical bills while you're here.
But I suspect if we did if
legislators did become rate they
would become regular but P. R.
A..
Members and this retirement
program would be history.
I mean I I I I sincerely doubt
that it would continue because
it doesn't lend itself to
salaried
employees so the not to worry
about that particular issue and
So I think it's certainly I'm
going to vote for the bill
because I think it should be put
to voters I certainly have a lot
of people who wish.
I were more readily available
that I actually answered my
phone that I actually returned
every phone call because
sometimes I write it down a
little sticky.
And I found.
A folder full of sticky is that
I took on vacation with me thank
you know was going to work on it
returning phone calls or send
emails and I probably this place
that for three months.
You know that's not a good thing
and I've I feel sad and
embarrassed and and so forth but
I didn't get important questions
answered about housing and and
And some other things not just
not little constituent services
but big policy issues.
What we're what are we going to
do about.
The whole rental property.
difficulty here people
experience and try to be fair
landlords and try to be fair to
the people who are in in very
tenuous situations so
I think that people deserve
better.
Representation and they're
getting from me.
And from a lot of our our.
Folks and and there's no ill
intent.
It's just a matter of not being
able to do that and and
balancing it with your other
work and years of family
obligations so I appreciate all
the hard work that goes into
this and I think into this and I
I hope we can get it in front of
the voters and learn more as the
studies actually completed so
I'm I'm really bored and I I I I
value in believe in everybody's
dedication right now to be here
under these circumstances and I
don't fault anyone for
Viewing it otherwise thank you
madam chair.
Thank you representative
Representative lane.
Thank you madam chair.
Chair I I.
But I think these are kind of
bills that are helpful to so
that we as a body can have a
public conversation.
it's it's interesting I probably
get asked more about this
question and almost anything
else
I serve on the NCSL executive
committee and other members from
other states are always shocked
that we don't get paid.
So these interesting
conversations and people asking
where I've fallen and I am
genuinely say I I don't know I
don't know.
What the right answer is I think
because I I just I see so I see
both sides so I see the side
madam chair that.
If you don't pay your
legislators then you've you've
Emily narrowed the group of
people that are going to be able
practically to run for office I
see that that makes a lot of
sense to me.
the other side though that I see
is is.
What's a couple things one is.
Depending on what we decide to
to pay legislators if you pay
something like twenty or twenty
five thousand I don't think
you've solved the problem at
all.
if the argument is we need to
broaden the pool of people that
are going to be able to run for
office it's got to be something
that people can actually go
whatever they're living is to
make this a full time job.
So I think that number needs to
be high enough to.
To allow people to support you
know a family or support
themselves or whatever that
looks like
and the other side I see.
Are you know a a corollary with
that is I think we are trying to
make a push to.
Attract the most talented people
whether that's in state
government with us and local
government and I think we should
look at trying to do the same as
well for our electives is making
sure that we are attracting the
best of the best.
so I I'm undecided on that
question chair at but the thing
that gives me heartburn about
the structure of this bill and
why I think also I have to vote
no is I'm not comfortable with
the concept of taking the
legislative authority over
setting our salaries
and giving that to a third party
that's the issue that I think
more philosophical that I
struggle with is I think that is
inherently the role of the
legislature to set those
salaries and are they on
comfortable boats absolutely
they are.
but I think it's within the
purview.
Of us as a legislature it's part
of what we're to find to do and
I do understand that there's of
some language in the back that
if if basically the commission
sets the salary and the public
is not happy with it
then there's a process to roll
that back.
madam chair one question I had
is wide twenty five percent of
the electric because I think
that's the number that I saw in
terms of the number of petitions
you have to signatures you have
together on petitions.
Thank you madam chair and and
leader I I think that's a really
great question so we went back
and forth on the voter piece the
voter piece actually doesn't
exist in the bill anymore it's
been amended out and the reason
that it was amended out is
because article four section
fifteen of the constitution
references that a voter
referendum is only possible with
a bill that goes into law this
technically doesn't become a
bill rate of a law right away
and so this is one of those
mechanisms that we had to go
back and forth early on because
the the the cohort that
leaders Chasey mentioned earlier
I mean that was the big piece
that we really wanted in
installed into this this
legislation we also looked at
language from this Washington
state they do a really great
they have a really great
mechanism when it comes to voter
referendum but because of the
way that our constitution is
written at the moment it makes
it challenging to do that and so
we're hopeful that would
enabling with the enabling
process later on that this is
something that we can tackle I'm
as a legislature.
Madam I'm maybe I'm not looking
for the most current bill so
this was to look at pages eight
nine and what I'm holding.
Thank you madam
thank you yes the to to number
is actually I do not have a copy
of the bill here my apologies
but all of section two so
everything starting on page
after page six was essentially
amended out of the bill okay one
second it's a point four so it's
the number that I have is two
two three one two nine point
four.
I the the committee house House
students brought to.
See what was soon to okay thank
you madam chair I appreciate the
clarification in regards state
constitution as a different
number two when it comes to the
reference part processes well as
a is there a call think is
somewhere around ten percent but
yes I you know just I think my
comments are still the same that
the the idea of giving it to a
third party and I know we're
trying to be objective but I
think we to be careful as of
legislative body about taking
that authority and investing it
in in a third party that's not
directly elected by the public
so thank you madam chair thank
you Representative
Representative McQueen.
Thank you madam chair mentor up
on the amendment I.
Just for for the committee's
information I think it's in the
committee report from
The prior committee composed of
relations Indian Affairs that's
where was amended.
Madam chair
Representative
Thank you thank you for your
from the sport bill I think it's
critically important
I am I am fully and persuaded by
the founding fathers argument
we're dealing with now
I
I understand reserve accounts
concern
I think we all should be paid in
a river in that when at least
one of those articles came out
about how much money we record
of of making.
And if you knew the people there
at the top of the list.
It was fine large the people
that lived on the edges of the
state.
Yes is the people that the drive
a lot to get to Santa Fe or if
you're in Farmington and you've
got the.
You've got a meeting in you know
Alamogordo that's a long drive
where is if you live in Santa Fe
or Albuquerque years are
centrally located and like I for
example you know I I can drive
home after this meeting so that
was part of the reason why the
you're being reimbursed for
mileage made it look like a lot
for some people and it was still
just reimbursement for mileage I
I just want to share Madam chair
representative with the
committee I was at a few years
ago I was at
You can committee meeting of the
it was then called the rural and
economic development committee
heard economic in rural
development one is.
And we were up the
yes this manual a community
center and we The presentation
on tort reform.
And Madam chair representative
to me tort reform is a code word
for make it harder to sue
corporations and we had four
presenters they're all in favor
of so called tort reform and
they cutting extremely warm
welcome from the panel.
From everyone on the panel.
Republicans and Democrats alike
and I was really surprised over
there working any push back on
this on their proposals to make
it harder to sue corporations.
And then I looked up and down
the panel and I real is.
Every single member of that
panel was a business owner.
None work for businesses they'll
owned businesses including
arguably myself being them self
employed.
Every single member was a
business owner and that's a
result of the fact that we don't
pay our legislature if you had a
nine five job or you know like.
The vast majority of jobs are
available in New Mexico are not
conducive to serving the
legislature for free.
They just can't do it and I've
known people who madam chair is
a who does the us if there's are
interested in running and then
they start you know doing the
doing the research in the
background and like yes I I
can't afford to do that and I
I've seen multiple people decide
not to run for that simple
reason and that to me is anti
democratic the the anti
democratic we need to make sure
that anyone in New Mexico.
And served in the legislature
thank you madam chair thank you
representative Representative.
Anyone else.
Of well again I want to thank
you for your work on this and in
truth I share some of the
concerns that were raised by
Representative lane and
Representative of Cologne in
that I feel it's the
responsibility of the
legislature to set salaries and
like however.
I think that in this situation.
Given that we're looking to an
independent commission to set
the salaries I can live with
with delegating that authority
and I it's something that I did
grapple with I will tell you
that but I think it's a fair way
because
if we vote on our own sellers
always be some question about
you know self serving kind of
motivations that we questions
about you know what was driving
the numbers and and that kind of
thing and that could go a lot of
different ways so I appreciate
where you're coming from I I
plan on supporting the bill
Times are changing you know
times have changed we we don't
live in a society where
it
You know landed gentry could
shut down there farms for during
the winter I and to come up here
to Santa Fe and legislate for
the rest of us we live in a time
where we want is maximum
participation as possible I
think that's values of value
both parties share really and to
do that we need to ensure that
we cast a wide net for people
who are willing to run not just
serve up run and see that they
can make a difference in to do
that we need to ensure that at
least they are not taking a
significant financial hit and I
know people in in the house that
are you know that they have of
they have children
and there were they are single
parents and they have to take
leave from their jobs in that's
tough and it's not fair it's
just not fair to them I have it
very easy.
And I'm grateful for the out but
I think we have to have some
empathy for the fact that not
everyone is as comfortable as
the rest of us and I think value
is at is when we have a lot of
different perspectives and
lifestyles and economic status
and all of the whole array of
wonderful things that make our
state so special and to exclude
a whole swath of people from
being able to serve does not
serve the electric well it
doesn't serve the communities
well it doesn't serve New
Mexicans well and for that
reason I really appreciate the
legislation and I and I plan on
supporting at
anyone else in the COVID all
right then I think we're ready
for most.
In that case okay a motion by
Representative Chasey and a
second by speaker Martinez the
chief.
The sponsor from.
Did you want did you want to
Madam I just wanted to respond
because there is a consistent
theme of of some of the comments
that were made and I just wanted
to address it real quickly in
terms of why we were we had
opted into a a third party and I
just wanted to state that common
cause did a poll a few months
ago with over eight hundred
respondents all that was all are
Republicans Democrat
independents and
The majority of voters across
the state of New Mexico said
they they're they preferred that
we
that we do with our that we do
an independent Commission and so
I just wanted to put that out
there that that's we're
sensually this is really just
what
voters want in New Mexico is for
us to to do this and this is why
we proceeded instruction so
thank you madam chair thank you
we have a motion for to pass on
the joint resolution by
Representative Chasey seconded

It's in the book Representative
thank you.
I love my.
On my bill is
flute right size detection pilot

Good information I believe if we
properly fund.
You know this this.
Pilot project and give our law
enforcement the resources they
need to.
To follow through with a quick
settlement and person that that.
Within the four years we should
I believe with the help of a
have a good road to allow all.
The help with our do you are
problem in New Mexico.
This is just a will be just
another tool in their toolbox to
help overcome.
This problem.
There is an appropriation with
the bill one million dollars.
This out of the cannabis
regulation Fund.
And with that.
Will stand for questions okay so
just to clear you know the
little housekeeping we have in

talking about this too did your
expert Representative wish to

bill online please raise your
hands.
Okay I don't see anyone raising
their hand online either
okay so Representative would you
like to say anything before we
go to the committee of.
I expect might look to okay talk
about what she brought the.
The.
you mean
of physicians I would be more
than happy to.
Madam chair and members of the
committee
and I'm sorry I did not catch
her name but she's believe from
the public defender's office I
would tend to agree with our and
the one narrow scope that at
this time the science does not
exist to bring it to the level
of bringing probable cause and
introducing into court
however there are already
safeguards in our current
statutes that would prohibit
that from being done I believe
this technology is extremely
viable however we have not
tested it for ourselves and
that's what this pilot project
is needed for so that we can
properly tested I believe this
as the lady mentioned
Science first and I believe that
would be a good approach to this
getting just rolling with the
initial allocation of funds that
we can purchase instruments from
a variety of vendors so that we
can test them against each other
and our current standard of
blood testing
that would establish whether or
not we can move forward and
expanding the pilot project.
Thank you so let's go to the
committee first on the list is
representative of re.
And thank you madam chair
representative I'm just trying
to understand it so this is a
what kind explain the test if
you will or what kind of tester
looking at because I'm it's a
saliva test been trying to get a
little more understanding of
what would happen if you were
suspected of being under the
influence of drugs I'm assuming
it's something similar to a
portable breath tests for
alcohol but if you could just
kind of describe what you're
looking at you want to add to
that this.
Madam chair representative every
three first I want to clarify
that the probable cause pieces
not in the sub so I just want to
clarify that that's been removed
it I don't know the exact page
in my number but that is no
longer in the bill
and I think we like to to for
our expert this.
With these two you can hear me
okay did you hear my question.
I believe so is basically how
these instruments work
there are a variety of
instruments out there a couple
that I have actually been pretty
use
one is so talks instrument one
just regular the ones that I
have used basically what it is
there's a little cartridge it is
inserted into the individual's
now collects saliva on a
modified Q. tip I guess is the
best way to describe that it's
then inserted into the
instrument and after a few
minutes anywhere anywhere
between five and twenty minutes
depending on the instrument and
the standards
you get the result of that I
would agree with the allocate
that it would be about on the
same level as a preliminary
breath test or a portable breath
test for alcohol except related
to drugs and and each is the
sixtieth cartridges in
instruments are designed and
engineered for a specific set of
substances
so they would have to be
tailored for what we're actually
encountering out on the streets
the as far as the process of
them win this test would be
introduced it would be
introduced after arrest the
probable cause for arrest would
already be established by the
officer and how we get to that
is we have to reach the level of
reasonable suspicion to make a
lawful traffic stop
actually observing a traffic
violation pulling that vehicle
over under lawful circumstances
contacting the driver observing
the driver's behaviors speech
patterns and everything
All the circumstances
surrounding at their driving
behavior and everything.
And then it would be up to the
officer to determine whether or
not field sobriety tests were
needed if they were needed the
officer would conduct field
sobriety
tests on the individual.
And driving the vehicle.
If they showed signs of
impairment the arrests would be
made the very first thing we do
after that is the breath test
for alcohol if that comes
secretary low amount for the
zero amount of alcohol then
that's where normally a drug
recognition expert would be
called in if one is available we
then run some extra
Evaluation the style tests to
determine whether or not this
impairment is seen is related to
drugs alcohol or rule it out as
a medical deficiency and give
the individual some medical help
there's a number of different
ways that could be done it would
be at that point where this
saliva test or oral fluids test
would come into play where we
could make it a roughly an
initial confirmation if you will
as to what we just the officers
and the R. ace we're seeing.
through our our tests and
evaluations on the particular
individual in question.
Does that answer the question I
think so madam chair
representative expert I just.
I just so it would just show the
presence of more wanted but
obviously or I guess will it
show other drugs are just
cannabis.
These tests they usually the
standard right now it's between
seven and nine different
categories for instance opiates
it would do a number of the
medically prescribed pain pills
from you know lower tech
Percocet oxy cotton all of those
along with heroin morphine
the lauded
however Sentinel in that
category would require a a
special yes these companies are
just now getting spent and all
introduced into the panel but it
would also do cannabis it would
do a lot of central nervous
system depressants to include
things like Xamax and Valiants
hallucinogens to include ecstasy
And some hallucinogenic
mushrooms some of them will yes
you're basically what I'm saying
is you have to purchase the.
Instrument and the cartridges
for the instrument specifically
for what you want.
But with the specific cartridge
you get a wide variety of
initial testing.
Okay thank you madam chair
representative at an expert this
is been used in other states
currently.
Yes I have personally witnessed
its use both in the state of
Arizona and California under the
auspice of the drug recognition
expert program
so there is some preliminary
data out of some of those states
showing that they are rather
effective and they are rather
accurate once again depending on
their specific cartridges is how
they are used when used properly
they're becoming more more
effective just like with any
other technology the more we
learn more we use it the more we
can modify it and by we I mean
all the brainy Act that the sign
is things I'm just a little user
in the field.
Right and so madam chair and
representative of this is just
like a pilot program to started
in certain districts and just
see if it's something that's
effective orders what would work
for New Mexico and strictly for
your.
All that project to get for you.
With that in there for years
four years.
It is a pilot project yes ma'am.
This for your project.
Thank you Mr federal questions.
Thank you
Representative Alcon.
Really if first of all I wanted
to ask if there was a it the
analysis for the for the sub or
a for FY or anything thank you.
No Representative there was some
misunderstanding about when we
did get a copy of the seven time
so I don't want to imply that
the sponsor has anything to do
with it but there was some
disconnect between.
Passing on that information to
the analyst so they have not
seen this
Okay.
The okay so okay so madam chair
a.
Basically what I'm understanding
this you took out the the the
the possibility of a restore
From from from the original bill
is that what I understood so
Alas list Liz can figure that
out thank.
Maybe.
I mean Madam chairwoman thing I
want to answer this we do not
remove the possibility of our an
arrest in totality we just
remove the language that says
it's utilized to obtain probable
cause so as you're aware an
arrest could be made for any
number of reasons having to do
with the drug tests or not so
that's still a possibility but
the reference to using it to on.
Get to probable cause is no
longer in in the substitute.
Okay so.
Share that with the update on
the status okay officer will be
over at least myself as an
example because I mean really
the gala I was gets pulled over.
But anyway.
Okay for some reason or another
I mean my tail lights broken
over the over he paid the
notices of laser very easy which
is normal and twenty which left
you with this device and
actually to read that right.
Is that correct.
Fall.
Madam chair and go to our.
Out the door in on this one.
Madam chair representative
outcomes that would be incorrect
in order to get to the testing
procedure we would have to
establish the probable cause for
arrest
because as Elizabeth mentioned
that using it for probable cause
has been removed from this bill
and as a pilot project I would
be extremely against using it
for probable cause because we're
testing this to see if it means
our current standards and can
help us.
The more efficient in what we're
doing to keep the motoring
public state that's our end goal
what the the process you just
mentioned would potentially be a
violation of rights and and I
would be dead set against that
as should anyone who.
Cherishes our constitution where
law enforcement as as a
community.
it would be in this particular
bill it would only be as a pilot
that would be a parallel to what
we're currently doing
as of right now the way the
statutes are written
we are a blood and breath state
for chemical testing.
we cannot introduce oral fluids
or urine for example into court
at this time.
This bill to my knowledge in
reading and Elizabeth could be
to confirm or deny here
Won't change that at all it
simply is coming along side to
test this new technology to see
if we can use it and I believe
technology over the last five to
eight years is that I have been
looking at it
has reached a point where I
believe it's a viable to start
testing and see if we can use it
effectively in our state.
It okay chair and
representative.
Hello this.
But.
If somehow or another.
We run this test on the driver.
Every week okay basically you
have a PC for the stop of a.
That's that's okay but we run
this test discussing the.
I I don't know how to set for
act would participate in it list
this shows the police officer.
That that person's level is at
X. amount of whatever it is
regularly at takes the the the
the the the the the the case
having.
Actually a would you cut the
cord got ready this the
attorney.
For the defendant is going to
say how.
There's a problem here.
Thank you need the madam chair
he studied over there he's on my
side today.
I think we have to keep it to
the.
I appreciate your being here
for.
I'm doing you a favor I'm sure
so.
I think bill I do we keep it to
the witnesses provided to us and
our representative okay good.
Thank you madam chair
representative Al Capone I
understand your concern the only
thing that I would distinguish
on is that the portable test is
not detect a limit of the
substance it merely detects a
positive or negative just like a
COVID yes we don't know how much
COVID you have but we know you
have a comment it's that type of
the test we don't know how
pregnant you are but we know
your time is it's the same type
of test that is either positive
or negative
then it's on the prosecution and
on the defense to prove if that
was in fact at all related to
the errant driving maybe it
wasn't.
That's where the attorneys get
to do their jobs in our justice
system gets to play out the way
that it doesn't every other
case.
I guess so so then Madam chair
representative so there was
really a other words if this
version is being used marijuana
for some kind of with.
I like to would buy the one
everybody should be honest about
that we can't imagine.
If we use in that.
This is not going to tell you
how much.
But the one that that guy has
been using Representative being
used it'll just say that it has
it is being you.
That's it.
I would.
Thank you madam chair I see the
problem with this thank you
madam chair thank thank
you Representative this.
Madam chair I was twice as hard
or at Representative Apollon.
The the police have to go
through the same regiment I stop
you for a lot.
But.
They have to go through a
regiment to determine if you
have been driving a radically if
you if you can walk the line if
you can do all the stuff before
you never get yes it's only
comes in.
At the same point as a
breathalyzer.
I think they're not going to use
it to stop this stop you choose
yes.
It is voluntary right.
You can refuse the test if so
Simas you confuse the the that
this.
You madam chair this is.
That I just see that by using
this you're already bringing
into this arrest.
Something that's not going to be
allowed in court.
Laughter my problem is.
Madam chair representative again
I see your point and I agree
partially and in fact my friend
sent me a Valentine yesterday
that was called an attorney
Valentine and it's that sort of
the answer sort of so I sort of
agree with you
You're right that the it's not
going to.
Actually it depends.
That said it depends so it
depends
It's not going to come into
court as direct evidence however
there are a multitude of ways
the information can come into
court in ways that is not direct
evidence for example if you're
seeking if your body cameras on
and you say oh my goodness this
man is saying he can't feel his
arm and he's also just tested
positive for this we need to get
him to the hospital that's
probably a declaration that's
exempt from hearsay rules there
are ways the information gets in
but the test itself they're not
gonna go into court and say yeah
here's the stick this is what it
shows.
Again probably more confusing
than not
Sorry Representative I didn't
mean to interrupt you okay so I
see the chief over here really
wanting to talk thank you he's
begging so I will.
Please if you wish to
supplements some of the
explanation I'd appreciate that.
I think you Mr Senator
Representative although he said
that the person has already been
arrested everyone is supposed
this happened probably because
already happened to make the
arrest this is already back in
the office when they're doing
the human beings and this is a
pilot project to figure out if
this is the technology we would
be able to use in the future of
similar to how we use our eight
thousand or any of the other
tools that we currently have
astronomical scientific process
I think in a couple dozen school
dollar probably.
Want to test it happen here this
is like step one.
This particular provision for
the red.
Happens opposed to rest no
decisions to arrest a person
will be made based on what this
technology tells.
Today.
All right.
Representative Romero.
Thank you madam chair thank you
welcome to our committee I'm a
no on this bill but I would love
to provide feedback I think just
on a few things because I think
the effort of trying to
essentially make it more
scientific and sound and how we
a process through.
Ending do you eyes on the road
is a worthy effort I just want
to
For the interim to really look
at where where these tests truly
are on the state act taxpayers
already invested to fifty
thousand dollars on this road
side test when we legalize
cannabis so I'm a little remiss
to invest another million
dollars out of this funds for
this specific purpose so I would
love to find a different way to
fund this
secondly
awaiting that on the data for
how that's going we we partnered
with the Los Alamos national lab
on this type of yes to to
investigate how we could do it
better and in an effort when we
legalize cannabis specifically
is yes goes beyond that and one
of my major concerns is how it
would you know look at something
like an opioid right we know
that their street opioids and we
know that there's legal opioids
on that you can get on with the
the proper prescription so one
we criminalize different than
the other potentially in which
case you know for looking at
overall it how we are looking at
impairments I don't know what
that value is for a positive or
negative if for Italian reading
one opioid over another which I
think gets us into kind of a
tricky place potentially
So that one drug over the other
and and what that would sort of
positive or negative would mean
so that gives me pause another
bit is just on the science side
you know what tests exist that
are getting to the level of what
we might even consider for a
pilot if we're going to start
playing something as of January
one next year what is the
legislature's role in approving
something like that
understanding how it's going to
be used I think would be really
critically important and
something again to work through
the interim through and then
just finding out what how these
how this is going in Arizona and
California if there's already a
live experiment happening what
is what are they how are they
working it through the court
system if at all and or or as
everyone just looking at a pilot
in which case maybe we don't
have to spend taxpayer dollars
and just learn from them about
how it's gone
but that said I think this is a
worthy effort I think we were
talking about how it is that we
evaluate the tools that we have
to to keep this but I will I did
just want to let folks know that
we're already invested in this
and we're looking at the data at
present and we're just really
trying to figure out how to do
better I don't necessarily think
this gets is there but I think
there's more time to figure that
out thank you madam chair thank
you Representative Lane.
Thank you madam chair of madam
chair maybe you.
How I understood the chief's
comments was that these.
Are going to be post rest in
your back to the station similar
like in talks with talks lies
right thousand where you have
the the detained individual give
a sample is that correct.
Yes the.
Then.
Okay and so part of what I guess
I want to ask is if is there a
different application for this
that would.
Would be useful so instead of
looking at it from a dust.
Lance what if we looked at it
from a from the officer the
fields lands is there anyway to
to have these things in the
field.
not in the sense of it being
admissible in court but to give
an officer another tool whereby
they can confirm that they are
in fact making the correct
decisions before they actually
arrest somebody and and take
away their civil liberties so
for example we do we do this in
a couple ways with with D. W.
eyes we have the the horizontal
gaze nystagmus test it's not a
missile in court but it's
something that that officers can
confirm their suspicions before
they decide to rest we also deal
with the portable breathalyzers
so is there any thought to an
application along those lines.
Madam chair representative when
there are some states that
actually do use it
Clemente airy to probable cause
preliminary to making an arrest
that doesn't seem like that
option is palatable here but
there are some states that do
that as well.
Chair if I just I don't see
the court.
Finding the indicia reliability
is to allow these to be
admissible so I I just feel like
maybe we're going down the wrong
path that it might be better to
look at it from a tool in the
toolbox of a police officer make
sure they have additional data
to make sure they're making the
right decision for rest.
so that would be my suggestion
maybe is to look at it from that
and so thank you madam chair.
Thank you speaker Martinez thank
you madam chair and thank you so
Mason welcome to House Judiciary
Representative that is a people
would have us think we are.
I this is an interesting bill
and and leave it up to you madam
chair with reading else's.
I went through the various
rather quickly
I will I will weigh in on that
part of it but.
when we legalize cannabis two
years ago now.
We
we had a very what I thought
very well thought out plan for
how to address everything
related to legalization from.
Public safety to driving under
the influence to re investment
funds and and everything else up
this was one of the areas that
I became very interested in as
we legalize the substance I
think it opens up
a great no.
First of all
second of all.
I think that it is as as a
legislature with our law
enforcement and and other allies
out there.
To figure out what the best.
Process and what the best tools
will be.
For protecting the public
safety.
I appreciate this effort I think
it's well thought out.
I personally like that this is
not what we're not changing any
of the.
Rules of evidence or or then you
know I I will we're not changing
how we prosecute we are simply
testing.
This.
This apparatus is yes.
I like that it's voluntary
obviously there are a lot of
questions about.
Whether or not.
That's presented.
To the alleged.
You know.
Suspect.
I think it would be important
for law enforcement to expressly
state that.
So that you're not unduly
influenced into participating in
something that is supposed to be
voluntary
I think to the point expressed
earlier by for my colleagues.
there are some loose ends and
I'm not sure how to tie them
necessarily
I'm not sure there's a way to
tie them really because it is a
pilot in trying something.
So.
I will be supporting this
I think.
I don't want to over used phrase
but it's another tool.
In the toolbox.
And I've got all the faith in
the world in the DPS and state
police in particular to be able
to carry this out
and.
Shows data and and tell us in
the future if this works or not
along with the other work that
my colleague was speaking about
I think it's going to take an
all hands on deck approach
and I appreciate you taking
leadership fund is very
complicated issue thank you
madam chair.
You were the speaker
Representative Rehm.
Thank you madam chair and and
I'm glad the chief kind of
cleared up this is yes
for the sampling maybe we should
use the word sampling up occurs
after the rest everything is
happened so we have a little
history on how we came up with
the standard field sobriety test
so department of transportation
recognize that we had a DWI
problem back in the early
seventies and then they went and
said well how are we going to
come up with a yes that we can
scientifically validate and so
they started through this and
these stop people the took
samples they gave them yes they
saw how they perform and they
develop this matrix and
basically it is a clones of how
they perform on the test.
That's what we're doing here.
We're we're just beginning Hey
if if we have this tool made by
X. Y. Z. company does it
actually work and that's what
we're trying to do here
And madam chair.
I was a traffic officer what we
saw.
From the eighties on the current
is that individuals who are
going out to party are going out
to party and by that I mean
they're now mixing multiple
substances of mixing alcohol
with that and and
they're really out party now.
So if we look at twenty twenty
one I introduced house bill one
eighty seven and there is data
from the scientific lab of New
Mexico that showed and won me
explain the process so we
understand the process so we
would take a blood sample from a
DWI driver they're under arrest
or their deceased because you'd
be in either category.
They would run an alcohol screen
first if it was point zero eight
or above they had the per se
limit for DWI.
If they did not have the the
point zero eight so there was a
point zero seven the name ran
those on a drug screen.
Ninety percent were positive for
controlled substance of those
samples.
And of those samples forty
percent were positive for drugs
and alcohol.
Okay.
In twenty eighteen the
governor's highway safety
administration they looked at
data from twenty sixteen across
the U. S. and what they reported
was that forty four percent of
drivers were positive and we're
talking about fate of fed fatal
drivers they did tests on forty
four percent were positive for
one or more drugs and no
alcohol.
They also reported that
Forty one percent were positive
for alcohol and drugs.
They looked at from two thousand
and six to twenty sixteen that
the increase in drugs of fatal
drivers increase from twenty
eight percent to forty four
percent.
And madam chair what I'm giving
the data I I saw over my career
the increased number of drivers
who were impaired on substances
which is what we're trying to
look at now in the Daytona Fahri
and maker roads safer and I
wonder if the police officer
expert has any comment on what
he's seen over his career.
Recent career please.
Thank you madam chair
representative rainy yes I'd
seen something very similar
a number of the studies both
from the past where you're
mentioning back to eighties and
nineties that's actually those
studies as part of the
curriculum that we teach and
drug recognition expert program
so I'm familiar with a number of
those studies and
Surprise surprise human beings
really haven't changed and for
decades I've been around for
twenty three of those years and
question and if nothing's change
we're seeing all of the same
things
we know we've got a problem and
it's it's a fluid problem is
there some substances that are
more popular than others this
year and and over the next three
to five years that may change
case in point fentanyl a few
years ago I know was not the big
hot topic across the nation and
now it's a household word so
that this that's the proof in
the pudding of right there in my
opinion so yes these these
instruments and this project
this pilot project would further
enhance and make our jobs more
efficient
and more accurate but we have to
have the data up front in order
to have the data we need the
instruments the time of the the
testing process
and then before they would be
used for court cases the
scientific laboratory division
would need to sign off on it
that's in the regulations in the
state statutes as currently
written already.
Thank you madam chair that's all
my questions.
Thank you Representative and
other comments or questions.
Okay so Representative I'm
struggling with this and partly
because because I live with a
scientist.
Have all kinds of scientists
around me and where I live.
I I know we need testing for
cannabis and other drugs that
act that we don't have now but I
have been imagining.
A scientific process.
That's peer reviewed and has all
those kinds of things associated
with it before we start using it
to test people.
And I don't see and not this is
not to be disrespectful of the
department of public a truly
isn't but that is how I've been
imagining us there is going to
be there in the scientists
they're gonna structure some
kind of a study that meets
scientific standards and then
moving forward maybe there's
probably testing on humans you
know in the field.
And so what am I missing I I
just I don't see that in this
bill
Representative madam chair all I
I'll go to them in a minute but
you're right the scientific part
isn't has been in the
development of the apparatus.
Which is been going on for years
you know that is the part that's
been in the in the.
Laboratory.
We're trying to bring it from
the laboratory to the test stage
with the police okay this with
me at the.
Madam chair I think one thing
that's not evident is that the
apparatus the testing
apparatuses have to go through a
testing process and
beautification through the
scientific lab division of D. O.
H. and.
To my knowledge and I I think I
have this correct we actually
already possess a couple of them
of the approved devices so there
is a little bit of a backstop on
it's not like we're just gonna
go buy something off Amazon.
Although you probably idea.
The probably sell it though on
the.
Your available.
I appreciate that answer but I
imagine the people who developed
the device to be the ones than
driving the study and with
scientific principles and there
are things I have I could never
tell you what how to do that but
I know it can be done and so I'm
very uncomfortable with having
an advisory committee consisting
mostly of lawyer type people
like me up on and so on I also
noticed there weren't any
defense lawyers on the panel
either so that was of some
concern to me also so
I think it's a good start in the
conversation I appreciate that
Representative but I I can't
support it because it doesn't
meet some of my yes my mic to us
for what makes a sound
scientific evaluations.
Is there anyone else who wishes
to
COVID okay so I'm happy to
entertain a motion to move to
table.
There's been a motion to table
of we don't need a second so
could we call the roll.
Representative Alcon yes.
Representative Chasey.
Representative Lane no.
Mr speaker of the table.
Representative McQueen yes.
Representative Nibert.
Representative appreciate now.
Representative green no matter.
Representative semansky yes.
Representative madam vice chair
yes yes oaks or madam chair yes
yes.
By a vote of five to four
committee substitute has been
tabled.
thank you Representative Senator
I'm sure there's opportunity of
a continuing conversation on
this the vice chair mentioned we
have an interim process so that
might no thank you a few months.
All right Representative green
we're on outstanding warrants
backlog funding you I believe
that you sit down before.
The.
Madam chair so what we had done
originally was Raul would spill
over and then we had a meeting
and we have the public defender
back here give me a thumbs up on
it but it's the we had a meeting
we have the dust a public
defender and the court and what
we did is we met in discussed
how the funding would occur.
after that funding after that
meeting and we came to an
agreement then the City of
Albuquerque wanted and who was
not present they did not attend
they wanted to completely change
it and they wanted a totally
different funding source.
And there's was to send
originally all the money to DPS
and DPS I think now it's in
support of this as well and so
this is the agreement that came
out of multiple parties except
for the City of Albuquerque.
If there is another competing
bill that is over at House
Appropriations is its assignment
that is the City of
Albuquerque's bill so what we
want to do is move this out of
here over to appropriations we
can have that discussion there.
Cindy you have it taking up.
Members of the committee
incentive tackle with the
administrative office of the
courts and I think and anyone
who's stood still long enough in
this house is the one of these
we've been trying to communicate
with members to let them know
what we would do you if we
received a portion of this
appropriation the state
surrender program is incredibly
successful and we have we
continue to provide turn it we
would we would love to continue
doing them
as I said if you if you see none
of these you know how the
program has morphed throughout
the years and it's a.
It really is everyone taking
part and doing what they do best
in order to bring
defendant into compliance.
Do you need your X..
We do have one it's one of the
things that we've done it's
consult with our behavioral
health expert from the court and
so he is available to talk about
why it's important to have the
support structure in place at
these events he's on those in
the committees in the eastbound
and getting it here.
Is to speak.
If the if the terror.
You want to hear from him okay
if he wishes to speak and you
thank you he would add value
sure.
The I get that set.
Noted I gave you for the person
on the okay he's he's if so and
he's online his name is Scott
Patterson.
Yes madam chair if you.
And madam chair members of the
committee Marcus served on
behalf of the New Mexico
distributaries Association as
well as the administrative
office district attorney's the
reason why we are in full
support of this bill and I'm I'm
sitting here
with Representative ring is the
fact that all parties are at the
table all parties are being
funded to
Achieve the same goal which
essentially is public safety.
Thank you after thank you Mr
Paterson wanna add anything.
Okay thank you chair thank you
committee members.
Definitely support this
amendment in agreement with the
fact that when folks all
participating states render of
that and they are able to be
connected to enforce services it
has the potential to decrease
the likelihood it will be
engaged back in the justice
system and it provides
opportunities for folks to be
connected to you know answer
services the reasons why they
may have received a warrant or
may have not been able to comply
so.
For any questions.
Thank you.
Do we have questions for
Representative Rehm.
I I have I do then chair I'm
going through the other bill.
I just I just don't know why
this seems to be so complicated.
It's an appropriation.
To sweep Lawrence and I don't
understand why there are two
bills now I don't understand
where the city
is not a part of this I don't
understand why
I just I'm I'm a little confused
I I know that the original bill.
I had problems with visual bill
we was written
That is looks vastly different.
I do know City of Albuquerque.
From what it this idea as part
of the metro crime initiative
and I know that they've been
working really hard.
To do this in the most
effective this is the way.
That helps of them in particular
get bad folks off the streets
without infringing on.
People's rights because that's a
concern a lot of us have right
sometimes when you go sweet
these warrants a folk show up in
our neighborhood and you know to
the scary.
Up I I guess the first question
have manager is is why why are
the parties working together.
Madam chair and Mr speaker
So the City of Albuquerque and
it was chief and data came to
the courts and corrections and
October and proposed that they
needed ten million dollars for a
warrant roundup.
And ten million for the state
for the rest of the state.
At that time I open the file.
I can't tell you I have had
several conversations with
Medina with chief and data but I
don't remember I specifically
told him I opened at that I.
However this bill was pre filed.
The first time that we I will be
contacted by the city is during
the presentation here.
And during the presentation they
stood up in the soft objection.
If you remember I said while
during the presentation I want
to meet with everyone and let's
get together.
The following morning we had a
meeting at nine thirty we all
got together hammered out
everything whatever reason the
city did not want to
participate.
Then
Later that week I received a.
Bill from the City of
Albuquerque of what they wanted
well it's a hundred and eighty
degrees from what the group had
set.
And the City of Albuquerque in
particular wants all the money
to go to one entity and then
people apply for.
As these people that have come
together state part of it is
they can't receive the money in
that manner.
Or they didn't trust the way
that it would be that they could
receive money.
One of the things a public
defender pointed out is if you
give us the money we can contact
our service are our clients.
And say Hey you need to come in
and work with us to get this
taken care of.
I met with the city of the city
also in their proposal their
original proposal wanted to
purchase equipment.
Well the responses what we need
is a patrol car a set of
handcuffs in a police officer
well they want to buy pulled
cameras and other stuff and the
group when we were meeting and
discussing with the city felt
that was improper.
The city even wanted to dictate
how the money would be handled
outside Bernalillo county I
tried to say well let's let's
separate some of the issues will
stake Bernalillo county let's
take the rest of the state and
take it off the table in the
state they refused so we have.
Not found in the flexibility
with the city.
And so consequently we're moving
forward with what everyone came
to an agreement on.
Can you mentioned and
Representative fortunately I
don't I don't know that the City
of Albuquerque's here to.
To give their side of the story
here of.
I I'm just a little dumbfounded
how difficult can it be to
appropriate twenty million
dollars to sweep warrants.
I quite frankly don't care the
money goes through the PS.
I'm wondering if the two folks
next the representative on the
record can they not access those
funds if it goes through for us
is that what I heard Madam chair
representative.
Madam chair in of Mr speaker
that is correct and why is that
Representative manager.
Madam chair Mister speaker I I
don't know if if if it's a
matter of we can't access it
what I do recall meeting with
with the
The City of Albuquerque's was
the funds we're gonna go into
the.
General it was under I think
DFA or some other third party
and then we would apply so
wasn't necessary that they would
be completely unavailable it was
more of an issue of.
The process to get those ones
where this particular bill
major the monies are allocated
to implement County
for this reason.
madam chair and also that the.
The risk of.
Again and I believe one million
dollars the LPD would be given
one million dollars this person
months the other districts
throughout the state so madam
chair representative.
This seems more a matter of
convenience than.
Inability to access it's it
seems like it might be a little
harder to access under that
other concept because this one
appropriates directly to you
madam chair which which is fair
but that's different than saying
you cannot access it.
Madam chair representative madam
chair and Mr speaker I have
their proposal if you'd like to
see a.
I can give this to you I've got
to I've got the other bill open
here no this is their proposal
to the committee of what they
wanted and you can see they
wanted all the body to go to DPS
well DPS couldn.
Distribute the money directly to
the court and to the public
defender's stuff and all that
Mrs
Chair Mister speaker I think the
the other thing to consider is
that each each of the justice
partners engage in this system
has a very different role and so
if you're looking at what I
believe it house bill three
eighty seven you'll see that
there are specific requirements
for each agency to request money
and one of them is for example
demonstrate how you're gonna
solve previous crimes through
this well the the point are not
engaged in solving crimes at all
I don't think the public
defender is either so each each.
Each piece of the justice
partners has a really different
role inside of it and so what
what that proposed legislation
does is that it excludes some of
the justice partners from
participating.
In Mr speaker one of the things
the way the city was proposing
that in theory they could have
received all of the money and
cut out the partners.
I I hear that madam chair
representative I I.
You and I have been involved
Madam chair representative in
some of the M. C. I. meetings
the metric crime initiative
meetings
You know I I I've got like you
I've got the utmost respect free
PDF thing they're trying their
best with very little has the
idea of going after these these
warrants.
They're not here I don't see
them here
to give their side of the story.
And I continue to be.
I guess I I guess I could use
were frustrated at this point at
that how complicated this and I
think I think this bill is like
the second billiard.
And now it's been four weeks and
there's a different bill and.
I would urge you all to.
Really talk this through I mean.
There's really no philosophical
ideological anything here it's
money to get these warrants and
with all due respect the experts
if if the money if if there's an
easier way to get the money
versus hardware like I think
that's relevant I mean honestly
like I.
It really shouldn't matter now
if you cannot access the money.
That's a different story and
let's talk about that but that
seems like an easy fix right if
my agency cannot acces the
money.
Being appropriated.
For a purpose that I'm expected
to participate in that's pretty
obvious that's pretty black and
white let's open it up so that
this one agency could
participate.
but I really don't.
I don't want to waste this
committee's time I don't always
have Representative time I don't
know east
you know staff time in New York
time.
On something that really
shouldn't be that difficult
really.
I mean I don't know how else to
put it in chair but
I think I'll just leave it at
that and I I I urge urge folks
to figure this out one way or
the other we're going to
appropriate money to three
warrants I can guarantee that.
How that's done.
If if you are so inclined please
figure that out because we will
appropriated it will happen.
Madam chair and Mr speaker
that's why I think we need to
advance to appropriations for
the other bill is and B. before
the Appropriations Committee
where both sides can present
theirs and then they can make a
decision on how they're going to
allocate the funds but we found
the city in my opinion very
inflexible
to even compromise at all on
this
In.
That's why we we sat down by I
had a meeting after additional
meeting with all the partners
and said here's city you
convince everyone to to change
their position whatever you want
and
the.
They didn't they didn't move at
all.
There was no movement on their
part.
Levinger can anyone else wish to
comment on this so just to step
back we have a.
Committee so before us.
The sub.
Arises from the fact that we
told you asked the
representative to go back and
work with the city and others
who objected to what was being
presented.
And they come back with the
consensus I thought to come back
with a consensus document.
Am I wrong and and my industry
numbering what we talked about.
Madam chair you're correct and
we have a consensus even the
well state police except we
don't have the city who it is my
way or the highway.
Okay.
Well I guess I'm happy to
entertain a motion on this of
that we've been talking about.
Madam midtable.
We have a motion to table
committee committees well I
think.
I'm trying to think about how
would you do motion to table
when you have a.
Committees of.
I just like to table okay house
Judiciary Committee substitute
house bill ninety seven okay
our.
Call the roll please
Representative Alcon.
Representative Chasey.
Representative Lane though.
Mr speaker no.
Representative McQueen.
Yes.
Representative Nibert.
Representative re hello.
Representative green no ma'am.
Representative Sapan ski.
Yes.
Madam vice chair yes.
Madam chair yes.
I vote of sixty five we have a
two passed to table Committee
substitute for house bill ninety
seven.
Thank you thank you.
Okay.
You are a Representative.
Representative night and I see
we have Representative Pettigrew
in the audience help us as well.
The floor is yours
representatives.
Madam chair just the house bill
eighty by the way I was going to
ask you if you wanted we could
do.
Both.
And currently if you would like
thank.
So yes I think that's probably
not that's an efficient way to
do it so what you'll talk about
each bill which is a house bill
eighty and house joint
resolution I assume there some
you know there are some
differences and presumably the
philosophy behind here
making these proposals and then
of course we'll vote on them
separately.
Madam chair before you is House
Bill AT and house joint
resolution three
they are.
Two pieces of legislation that
I have worked on since the.
about may of twenty twenty.
and have worked on in the
language that's before you and
both pieces of legislation are
the words that a former
Representative Daymon Ely and I
the negotiated I have not
changed anything any substance
in in the bills other than
whatever was required updated to
twenty twenty three of the
session but the the the
substantive things are are the
things that Representative Eli
and I negotiated over the course
of the past couple years.
House bill eighty.
Is a is a bill.
House joint resolution three
calls for constitutional
amendments so so I'll go over
the the bill first and then go
to the resolution.
Basically the the the.
Reason why I have I have worked
on these for for that period of
time is because.
Shortly after the emergency
declarations for the pandemic
were
instituted.
I wondered and people were
asking me.
What what am I going to do about
of this order what working can
we do about this order and I
started doing some research and
found out that basically in two
thousand one.
After the
twin towers fell nine eleven.
Our legislature and most
legislatures around the country.
Had enacted.
Wide sweeping legislation.
To deal with emergencies.
And had given to the executive
almost without exception have
given to the executive of vast
powers to deal not only with the
emergency but basically to in
gauge in
activities that of have
traditionally fallen in the
realm of of the legislative
bodies.
And so I bring before you these
pieces legislation because I
feel strongly about the
separation of powers I feel
strongly about our.
Of.
Our role in crafting public
policy and also in holding the
purse strings of the of the
first.
And so through of many
negotiations Representative the
line I have of developed these
pieces of legislation the the
first of which is the bill and
basically it provides the.
If the governor calls.
An emergency we number one what
the governor to be able to deal
with that emergency most
emergencies are very short in
duration.
The government acts quickly it
provides the.
Services that are needed to get
a community or gate the
situation address and then the.
Life returns to normal.
We're not talking about those
types of emergencies we're
talking about these long.
The prolonged emergencies that
require additional resources and
I submit to you.
Require the legislative body the
representatives of the people to
come together and to discuss.
How the government how the state
should be engaged in developing
public policy to deal with the
particular emergency that's
that's before us.
And so what the what the bill
does is basically state that if
the governor declares an
emergency.
And the governor wishes to
extend that emergency beyond
ninety days.
She would have to call us into
special session.
To give us an opportunity to
discuss it and to make
determinations on on how to move
forward.
And one of the things that the
that we could do is we could say
now we don't see the emergency
we could end.
Or we could say governor you're
doing a great job this is going
to be a very monumental task we
need to develop resources we
need to find resources financial
and otherwise to allow you as
the executive to deal with that
emergency.
And the third thing we could do
is say you know what it calls
for us to come back into session
you know and sixty days if if
it's still going on.
We we could decide to say you
know you're doing a great job we
don't need to come back in for.
Six months Sir or whatever
current.
so we could make those
determinations but we would have
a seat at the table we would
have the ability to to.
Bring forth the concerns of the
citizens that we represent the
impacts on our communities and
to make request and to let the
government know particularly let
the executive know how these
things are are impacting our
respective communities our
respective constituents from
around the state.
The
Major difference in this field
quickly to the resolution calls
for the same ninety days and
sixty days for the for one
differences that.
it requires a I believe a three
fifths vote
which the bill does not have an
so the constitutional amendment
would require a three fifths
vote where the the bill just
requires a simple majority to
you know.
Terminate the emergency order.
So madam chair and and and.
Members of the committee I would
just want to bring to your
attention one thing.
That's our constitution of.
If.
If we have a.
Insurrection.
In the.
Executive.
Calls assume the Marshall.
Then we are to come into
session.
Almost immediately I think it's
five days.
And we are to remain in session
for the duration of that event.
Without recessing for more than
that and I believe five days
three days at any one time so
You know the idea that the.
That.
It was dangerous for us to do so
I would surmise that in a state
of emergency such as one that
requires us to or requires
executive to call center martial
law.
Very dangerous for us to travel
up here in the and yet the
constitution requires exactly
that.
Constitution requires us to meet
even in the face of of that.
Terrible awful event that might
might the descent Department.
And so you know I think we need
to recognize that the that the
constitution dealt with that
issue with respective to martial
law and that we as a legislative
body with respect other
emergencies just gave the
executive a lot of power the
that I think.
Reside solely within the room
within the legislative branch
and this effort.
Is an effort to try to claw back
some of the power that we gave
the executive in two thousand
one with with that legislation
my co sponsor Representative
Pettigrew might have some things
to add then we'll go to the
committee for questions before
you do that I want to talk about
the administratively the
analyses for joint resolution
three is under Joint Memorial
three by mistake so what kind of
joint memorial three you'll see
all the analyses for the bill
okay and which and staff just
handed to the actual joint
resolution so hopefully we're on
the same page now.
As mentioned health.
It's a triple play on our
Representative read
Representative Nibert so I'm
sorry Representative Pettigrew
the floor is yours thank you
madam chair and thank you for
the committee

legislative body in that we need
to be fulfilling that duty and
so I have nothing more to add to
it Representative and I were
brought to the table thank you

Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee on the

Please raise your hand.
Online.
Okay I see three hands raised so
there's an M. F. A. A.
administrator.
Thank you madam chair and
committee members my name is
Matt and I'm ready for the
Democrats in line through the
I'm representing thousands of
people New Mexico freedom
Alliance which is a non partisan
statewide grassroots coalition
we're in support of the bill
that would change the way
emergencies are handled in New
Mexico the bill being proposed
bill allowed the governor to
take immediate action to the
security and well being of our
state but after ninety days our
elected representatives and
senators would be able to weigh
in on whether or not to continue
the state of emergency this bill
gives a good balance in
restoring the separation of
powers in New Mexico the last
thing governments respond to
emergencies quickly fall off of
in allowing the legislature to
represent the needs of their
constituents get emergency last
longer than ninety days
legislators are elected to
represent the need in our local
communities across the state and
they need to be able to weigh in
on prolonged emergency without
the support of this bill thank
you thank you.
Call guessing.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee my name
is Paul guessing I am here
Representative Rio Grande
foundation a free market public
policy research institute based
in New Mexico based in
Albuquerque and I am in support
of this both pieces of
legislation Saunders testified
to both of them at this moment
the constitution of the United
States the constitution New
Mexico are fundamentally based
on the separation of powers New
Mexico
needs to embrace this democracy
this individual liberty aspect
of our founding documents here
at the state level and it is
straightforward and simple that
the legislature needs to have a
robust role in future vertices
in the state of New Mexico the
matter the party of the governor
at the time of some future
emergency we need to have the
legislature engaged whether
that's a professional
legislature for the currents of
volunteer legislature.
It is critically important to
have more than one person no
matter what their role engaged
in policy making in vertices
thank you for your time.
Thank you
Carla.
Madam chair of years off at your
hi also a member of better
together New Mexico grassroots
advocacy organization that has
thousands individuals and
businesses across the state the
two previous speakers cover the
reasons that I stand in support
of this house bill and also the
house twenty resolution and I
believe the thank you bill
sponsors and they've also
adequately covered the issues of
how the additional bills for
passed right after the nine
eleven attacks and helping to
change.
And the constitution as well as
everyone that appreciate the
governments that we have in the
United States and here in New
Mexico this dependent upon the
separation of powers and that is
that balance the imbalance that
we have right now I believe
would be corrected by this house
bill and also support the
upcoming HD our conversation
created a passed ball thank you.
Thank you Larry right so we also
have a joint resolution those
wishing to speak in opposition
to the joint resolution for
reasons that are different I
you've already spoken to please
raise your hand.
Okay those wishing to see be
online for reasons that are
different from what you said
with regard to house bill
eighty.
Please raise your hand.
And I see Laura McCarthy.
Laura a chair and members of the
committee I'm sorry the lan line
I want you to know that both the
joint resolution and have still
do will create a severe
limitations to the state's
ability to reimburse local
governments with federal funds
for their wildfire response
activities and I've heard the
Sanchez talk about the short
duration of the emergency
however it often takes us
eighteen to twenty four months
to get reimbursed and it is a
requirement and auditors
requirements that those expenses
be booked as liabilities and
with that the executive orders
stay open until the
reimbursements are made so
madam chair this would be a lot
of special sessions thank you
thank you.
Anyone else online I don't see
anyone else online those wishing
to speak in support the joint
resolution that are different
reasons different from what you
spoke about the bill.
Thank you
thank online those wishing to
speak in favor of the joint
resolution for reasons that are
different from what you said on
the bill please raise your hand.
Okay thank you our public
participation piece is
concluded Representative did you
want to say anything more before
we go to the committee thank you
madam chair I would just like to
state that.
This issue is not unique to New
Mexico as stated earlier neither
is this type of legislation
a lot of other states have
clawed back the power that
they've given the executive in
two thousand one both blue and
red states impact the uniform
law commission has some model
legislation that regard I did
not bring that because this was
negotiated with with
Representative rely and and I'm
committed to passing of the bill
that we we negotiated so that's
what is before you
with respect to the eighteen or
twenty four months to get
reimbursed if that's the case
there's no reason why we
couldn't come back together as a
body and just simply state you
know that's all that's required
come up here for one day I'll
allow that to continue and and
remove the sixty day
re upping period that's that's
in both the resolution and in
the bill there's nothing that
prevents this body from doing so
we have the authority as a
legislative body to to enact
laws to to do exactly that so I
I would submit to you madam
chair that this is an issue that
has been faced by a lot of other
legislative bodies and they've
chosen to do so and I think New
Mexico should follow suit and do
the same.
Thank you madam chair we stand
for questions very good all
right
I have Representative McQueen
Representative Chasey.
Thank you madam chair mentor
representative is
and wondered if you could
address the state Ford Forster's
comments on states of emergency
related to disasters and federal
funding.
Madam chair representative if.
The federal government in the
reimbursement process requires
that emergency to be extended
I'm a bit surprised that it
would but it if that's the case
then.
When the governor wants to
extend its ninetieth day we can
come up here for one day we can
vote we don't need to come back
we could say you know what this
period go on for for the twenty
four months or whatever time is
needed to to allow that
reimbursement to happen.
But it would be nice for us to
hear as we've heard in this in
this session some of the impacts
of that fire up on communities
in the state and to appropriate
money.
To deal with that we're doing it
right now.
That money probably needed to be
disbursed before now.
We should have done that you
might.
Madam chair representative
Nibert I also believe that the
one point and I don't know the
current status but the I'm not
sure if it's a state that
emergency or one the public
health orders I believe a state
of emergency was being
continued.
Because it made people eligible
for enhanced snap.
Budget supplemental nutrition
program due to know anything
about that.
Madam chair representative I do
not know that.
Okay that's the I don't honestly
don't have the details of that
But the the point is Madam chair
representative there are
different reasons for continuing
a state of emergency I think the
one that that the state of
emergency that this was in
response to was a deadly global
pandemic and I for one probably
didn't want to be here in person
I probably don't want to be here
in person I think we could do
this virtually
madam chair risen neighbor
doesn't we talk about separation
of powers in the constitution
don't we have the constitutional
powers calls corrupt call
ourselves in the session.
Mmhm Madam chair representative
we do upon a supermajority vote
and then chairs and everything
that supermajority is three
fifths.
It's been a while madam chair
since I looked at that but
I would not argue with you if
you that's the number you the
majority of it is three so
isn't that that I mean that's
the same percentage in your has
turned resolution so I did what
what I don't understand is why
we need.
We can call ourselves in the
session when ever enough of us
sixty percent the huge
supermajorities ought to thirds.
Feel it's necessary we could
done that at any point during
the pandemic.
We did not.
So Madam chair representative
Representative Nibert why do we
need this if we already have the
constitutional authority to call
ourselves in the session.
Madam chair and and
Representative we need this
because.
The.
Desire.
For the.
The fact that.
An emergency was declared.
And.
The governor took the position.
That each extension allowed her
to
Appropriate appropriate I
believe seven hundred fifty
thousand dollars per incident
and then we found out that
actually the numbers were much
larger than that.
There was a real need for us to
come in the session to deal with
this pandemic because of the
amounts of money that were being
spent and it wasn't until.
You are here.
Here in several months after the
first merchants the order went
into effect that the supreme
court finally ruled that it's
the legislative body that has
the ability to control those
sums of money and we needed to
be consulted we needed
appropriate that money and there
was no mechanism to do that
without us being in the session.
So that's what one reason why we
would need to be in the session.
Madam chair representative that
but this really answer my
question because your your your
answer is that we need to be
ends in the session in session
and my question is we can call
ourselves in the session
whenever we want.
We didn't in that instance we
could of.
Why do we why do we need this
additional legislation when we
already have that constitutional
ability.
I would submit madam chair
representative we did not meet
our constitutional
responsibility we did not
appropriate those monies.
In fact insurers have that never
my thing is that we could if we
wanted to.
We could have it we Madam chair
representative I I agree we we
could have done that and to this
day we have not done that and
we've not had any substantive
debate on public policies that
were created.
So madam chair resent over
I think the pandemic was.
You.
Let's hope it was a once in a
lifetime event so.
I think we I personally think
we've done a very good job on
this and the steps along the way
given what we knew at any
decision point in retrospect I
think we handled it well.
I just when I consider your
legislation and what it would
do.
I I think it's unnecessary
because in.
Article four section six of our
existing state constitution.
We have the authority to call
ourselves into extraordinary
session.
Whenever you want three fifths
of the chamber and what that
what I think your proposal is
doing is.
I mean it's it's making it
mandatory that we come in which
may or may not be a good idea
and it's it's a knowledge meant
that there wasn't the support
for coming into extraordinary
session.
Where we would have done that.
So I mean it it's to serve going
around our existing
constitutional.
Authority and I'm.
I am satisfied with our existing
constitutional authority so
thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative Chasey.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you very much Representative
Nibert and I think you know my
feelings on this but I feel like
I need to share them with this
committee I I believe that my
colleague here made a very good
point that we could have done
what you're asking.
To become automatic and my
objection is that.
I'm like nine eleven which is
the event the tragic event that
spurred our initial emergency
orders.
The magnitude of this emergency.
I was completely.
On anticipated accept and I I
give credit to former president
George W. bush who had started
looking into the probability of
another pandemic.
but.
I certainly never contemplated
it didn't fit my scheme of.
Of things.
And
Had.
This law as you propose been in
effect and so automatically we
come into session it actually
would not have been safe to do
so.
And before we did come here we
had the national labs do an in
depth study of the capitol and.
The physical space and then the
human interactions that work
would occur and gave us the
guidance so that we could come.
So what safely and and June the
end of June for a very brief
special session.
So I I just view it as anti
scientific and potentially
dangerous to put this in
statute.
I I would invite you to think
about.
Some of the discussion that we
had in the state government
committee on this about and
whether or not it's advisable
and I don't know if the governor
this governor another would
sign.
To
After a certain period of time
to arrange for virtual
consultation with legislative
members.
For input no Representative
Zamora brought up some
agricultural issues that perhaps
quite frankly had occurred to me
in Albuquerque that would
Place in
We would give a different look
at how the extent of in order.

we could

Reactants find that perhaps all
three branches of government
because the judiciary had to
make major changes I know I
started doing my trials online.
And
My cat all the judges.
North you know my choice.
It started locking me out of the
study.
But
It all three branches of
government to do some problem
solving about how to deal with
An emergency I think we had
contemplated so I think maybe
that might be a place to go and
otherwise I think that you have
the Avenue of the three fifths
and conversations that's why I'm
not gonna vote for Madam.
This or the.
Constitution minute.
Representative Eli.
Thank you madam chair.
Madam chair I.
Have a little different
perspective than my colleagues.
As a shock I know but I want to
express those because
I and I I do understand frankly
the the argument that or or the
position that.
Well we're we have the option
within our state constitution
all you need is is six percent
of the Legislature think this is
a good idea.
The reason why I prefer this
approach madam managers in these
proposals is it actually removes
politics from the decision
entirely.
Politics is gone so now what
this would do is that we are
forced to come in.
And if we think it's unnecessary
then we're out of here in a
matter of hours of work on.
and I think the people of Mexico
deserve that when we're talking
about these kind of emergency
orders.
and I I get the safety
component.
I'm not discounting that but.
What is different about us as an
institution.
As opposed to the executive is
the legislature is the voice of
the people.
We are the ones that give direct
voices to the people of New
Mexico.
That the executive that is not
her job it's different.
And so if you don't allow
process.
To where the people of New
Mexico can weigh in on emergency
order.
Whether they agree with that
whether they disagree with that
whether it needs to be modified
when we don't come into session
in response to an executive
order we have cut out the voice
of the people of New Mexico and
I think that fundamentally is is
the crux here is.
Which is more important and
madam chair I I are on the side
of giving the voice of New
Mexico a chance to be heard
thank you.
Senator then respond.
I actually I prefer that you.
We're up for a having
conversation on the panel right
now so
anyone else wishing to speak.
All right
ready entertain a motion I'd
like to do on this and we have
