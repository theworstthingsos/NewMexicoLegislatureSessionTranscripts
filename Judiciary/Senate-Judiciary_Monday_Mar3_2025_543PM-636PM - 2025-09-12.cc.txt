Senate Bill 244, unlawful
transfer of firearm to a minor
has been rolled over at the
request of the sponsors, so we
won't hear that tonight.
Um, I know a number of you all
are here on Centerville 279.
We've got a couple of them that
I think we can get out, um, a
little more quickly and uh so
we'll take those in that order.
So we'll hear Senator Soul, and
then we'll probably go to
Senator Gonzalez.
Um, then, um, that takes care of
A couple of the non-members on
the committee, so they can get
back to other things or their
other committees, and then we'll
go to Senator Brantley, who's on
the committee, maybe, I think if
she's gonna come tonight, I
don't know, um, and, uh.
We'll hear her because she's got
to be with us for the duration
and the same thing with Senator
O'Malley, right? So we'll do it
in that order.
All right, so we're gonna begin
today as we have over the last
couple of years when it comes
down to gun legislation.
To take the opportunity and very
quickly survey the status of
current laws, it's come down
from the Supreme Court in the
last several years and um try
and get some guidance from where
we think the Supreme Court is
going to come down on 2nd
Amendment parameters, really, so
I've asked Brandon to do that
again for us and probably in
about 15 or 20 minutes before we
get to the other business of the
committee. We've done this every
interim. We've done this, I
think for the last several
sessions, and the reason for
that is because the law as it
pertains to the Second Amendment
is changing.
Around the country and in at the
federal level. So ultimately
they're gonna determine what
whether or what anything we do
here is gonna stand the test of
time. So, uh, we'll ask Brandon
Cummings on our staff to give us
a quick survey of the law as it
relates to the Second Amendment.
I was hoping we'd have 3 of our
newer members of the committee
here today to hear this, but
there's someplace else tonight,
evidently so, um, and they're
not, are they a caucus by
chance?
No.
I can check. Republicans in
caucus.
Somebody said yes to my
knowledge, but I'm happy to
double check.
I hear, yes, I hear no.
Let's just
Oh, cause I don't want to start.
If they're in.
I don't remember that either.
They may just be busy tonight.
The souls, followed by Senator
Gonzalez, so Senator Solis can
move on to other things tonight,
Senator Gonzalez back to
finance, and then we'll go to
Senator Brantley, you're with us
for the duration and Senator
O'Malley, so we'll, we'll hear
Senator O'Malley and then we'll
hear Senator Brantley years
last, I hope you all have, have
uh an evening planned with us,
so the sponsors requested Senate
Bill 244 be rolled over. We
won't hear that tonight.
We're gonna start with Mr.
Cummings with a 15 or 20 minute
presentation, so, uh,
summarizing the status of
federal law on the 2nd Amendment
starting with the Supreme Court,
Mr. Cummins.
Mr. Chair committee.
Um, what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to address specifically
what the Supreme Court said
about um perspective arms bands,
as opposed to trying to cover
all of the.
Um, different areas that aren't
that aren't that aren't involved
in the.
Legislation being considered.
OK.
All right, maybe I can know.
I thought I might be able to
move it, but
so there are 4 primary cases,
2nd Amendment jurisprudence case
is relevant Supreme Court cases
relevant to uh any potential gun
legislation, and those are, um,
Heller.
Which is the case in which the
Supreme Court for the first
time, uh, held that the 2nd
Amendment protections are.
constitute an individual right.
Um, and set up a framework for
considering what weapons could
be banned and when.
McDonald, which shortly which
followed two years after and
simply and mostly said that.
The holding in Heller was
applied to state laws through
the 14th Amendment
incorporation.
Bruin, which gave us the uh
historical tradition test but
was focused on primarily laws
that didn't ban a class of
weapon.
Instead, laws that limited
access to or where weapons could
be located or brought or
carried.
And finally, Rahimi, um, which.
Essentially reiterated and
reaffirmed the historical
tradition tests in Bruin, and it
won't be, we won't be talking
about Rahimi.
So the District of Columbia
versus Heller was um a 2008
case.
The opinion was written by then
Justice Scalia.
It addressed the District of
Columbia's ban, uh near outright
ban on the possession of
handguns.
The Heller court began, as I
mentioned, by first holding that
the 2nd Amendment.
Is an individual right.
Um, that was, that was the first
time that a court, the Supreme
Court had.
Dealt with the um issue of
whether or not
The 2nd Amendment protected a
collective right to gun
ownership and possession.
Or whether it was individual,
and they they specifically held
that you as an individual
citizen, have a constitutionally
protected right.
to keep and bear arms.
After holding that there was an
individual right to keep and
bear arms to.
said about, um,
Determining the appropriate
test.
To consider whether the District
of Columbia's ban on handgun
possession.
Um
Violated the Second Amendment.
The court laid out, um,
So the court found
For first that the ban on the
class of weapons, uh, was
unconstitutional.
They based that decision on an
expansive reading of the 2nd
Amendment.
Holding that or stating that the
2nd Amendment extends prima
facie on its face.
To all instruments that
constitute bearable arms, even
those that were not in existence
at the time of the founding.
In order to um.
Limit or ban a class of weapons.
The Heller court said that the
only mechanism for doing that.
Would be if the class of weapons
being banned was dangerous and
unusual.
And it compared that with um.
What it called weapons in common
use.
Specifically, it relied on a
United States Supreme Court
holding in US v. Miller, which
United States v. Miller, which
it read as recognizing that the
2nd Amendment extends only to
certain types of weapons in
considering the types of weapons
Miller.
Permits uh permits the
regulation of
The sort of weapons do not
include those in common use at
the time.
The Heller court identified only
one, as I mentioned, only one
historical tradition that
allowed a ban on weapons, and
that's the dangerous and unusual
reading the Heller court
together with the Miller
reference.
Um
The constitutional test was
established.
Effectively that any arms in
common use.
are protected by the 2nd
Amendment.
The common use and dangerous and
unusual.
Line of reasoning is a little
circular, as it's unlikely that
a weapon in common use would
meet the unusual test.
Uh, Heller remains good law and
provides the rule of decision in
arms band cases.
As I mentioned, the court's
decision in Bruin reinforced.
Or as I should mention, the
court's decision in Bruin,
although that wasn't the issue,
Bruin was asking a question
about whether or not licenses to
carry concealed carry could be
denied.
Um
For less than
To be denied a discretionarily
denied.
In Bruin, however, um.
The court took the opportunity
to.
Address, lower court decisions
that had been decided post
Heller.
Specifically, they addressed
whether or not
Um
Whether or not a balancing test
was appropriate, uh, the lower
courts following Heller had
engaged in a balancing test
under what's called intermediate
intermediate scrutiny.
Which is a means ends test.
Wherein the court balances the
uh.
Good of a law against the
limitation of the right.
And Bruin took the opportunity
to explain that the uh
intermediate.
Scrutiny or means balancing test
with regard to a weapons ban was
never appropriate.
The
The court also took the
opportunity and, sorry, in uh
Bruin
you note that, um.
In addition to the fact that
You could not regulate or you
couldn't, you couldn't make
heller decisions based on the
means balance test.
The, um, historical.
Limitations on a class of
weapons had to be looked at,
viewed in light of
Uh, category and the
Use of the weapon as opposed to
the
Um
newness or whether the weapon
existed at the time of the
founding, which would have
seemed to be more relevant under
the Bruin test.
Some of the policy and the the
Heller decision also, um,
Dealt with the arguments
regarding the specific
dangerousness of a weapon.
There were, there were numerous.
Um
Numerous arguments based on
specific dangerousness that were
briefed in the Heller case,
including the Virginia Tech
shooting.
Um
The argument that modern
handguns can fire more rounds
faster.
Then historical handguns, the
argument that they carried more
ammunition in their magazines.
Ultimately
Um
Despite being asked to consider
That dangerousness and being and
being um
Provided with evidence.
Just demonstrating the
dangerousness of those weapons.
The court
Limited
The consideration in in a
weapons ban case solely to that.
Um
Common use standard.
More recently, there have been,
um,
circuit decisions considering
what level of
Ban is appropriate or can be
legally justified, um, with
regard specifically to what have
been termed assault weapons.
And, um, that definition varies.
From law to law.
The basic concept being that an
assault weapon is a.
Rifle semi-automatic rifle
capable of accepting a
detachable magazine.
And
That magazine, being able to be
of greater than 10 rounds.
Um
So we specifically also looked
at.
Uh, litigation in Illinois.
In Illinois, they passed.
A
Assault weapons ban.
It was
Uh, take the, that was
challenged in the district
court.
The district court issued a
preliminary injunction.
Um
Finding that the plaintiffs who
sued saying that the assault
weapons ban was a
unconstitutional restriction
under Heller and MacDonald.
The, um,
Preliminary injunction was
removed by the circuit court.
So that we are aware, so a
preliminary injunction.
is an order in which a trial
court says,
Court believes that the
plaintiff, which in this case
would be the party's challenging
the law.
The Court believes that the
plaintiffs are likely to
succeed.
So the trial court agreed that
the plaintiffs were likely to
succeed in in challenging the
the weapons ban.
The 7th Circuit disagreed.
And um stayed or undid.
The, uh, injunction.
Would
Which means that the circuit
court found.
That the circuit did not believe
the plaintiffs were likely to
succeed in the challenge.
Plaintiffs in that case and the
case is Harold v. Raoul.
Um, the plaintiffs in that case.
Sought
Review on what's sometimes
called the Supreme Court's
shadow docket.
The emergency docket.
Asking the Supreme Court to
weigh in and reinstate the
preliminary injunction.
Um, the court declined to do so.
Um
Thereby making it, thereby
rendering the Illinois assault
weapons ban enforceable during
the pendency of the court case.
The um
Circuit court has consolidated.
Several district court
challenges into one case.
And that case remains pending.
The, uh, typically,
Denials of cert are, uh, do not
carry an opinion.
In this case, Justice Thomas.
Added his opinion to that.
Uh, denial of er in which he
argued that or explained that
the denial he believed the
denial was appropriate based on
uh the court's overuse of its
shadow docket.
That this case should be allowed
to filter up through its natural
process.
Um, but then he gave some
exposition on how he believed.
The court should decide if.
It became necessary to review it
at the Supreme Court level.
Questions are specific to the
bill right now. I wanted to give
the background to the committee.
We'll go back to the business of
the agenda very quickly to say
we can take care of some of our
souls and perhaps Senator
Gonzalez and we'll come back to
the discussion about the
proposed.
A gas operated so how to make
fire alarms 279. So, uh, center
souls on Senate Bill 9, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I very
much appreciate you getting me
in quickly this evening. That's,
that's very helpful. Um, Senate,
are you ready for me, sir? OK.
Senate Bill 9 was brought to me
by the PRC Currently on pipeline
Safety Act violations. The
current law has a maximum
$100,000 per day for each
violation, and if it persists
with a maximum of $1 million.
What this does is strike.
that and just moves it all into
what the federal requirements
are on the pipeline safety Act,
uh, what that effectively does
is we no longer have to uh keep
adjusting that number in the
state. It will just change as
the federal number would change.
Um, not sure that it does a
whole lot more than that, uh,
currently, the maximum penalty
at the federal level would be
$200,000 per day and $2 million
total. Uh, I do have an
expert here with me, uh Jason
Montoya, who is a professional
engineer and the pipeline Safety
Bureau bureau chief, but with
that, we're open for questions.
Mr. Chairman, I'll stand for
questions. Thank you.
Anyone
registered in support or
opposition to the bill so we can
go directly to members of the
committee. Any questions?
at all?
You see no discussion. We're
ready for a motion. There's
Stewart.
Any further discussion?
Is there any objection to the
due pass?
and at 9. Thank you.
Thank you very much committee.
Have a good evening.
Are we gonna have uh Senator
Gonzalez or you, you standing in
for him?
Entirely, he's got the whole
day. So we'll here instead of
2:41 next.
Everybody.
No
You know, Senator,
you're no senator.
No.
Uh, 231.
OK, tell me what we can expect.
You, you, are you familiar with
the kind of rules I was teasing
you, but you know the, where we
kind of apply things, I'll
recognize you for up to 10
minutes for advocacy, so you can
present the bill any way you
want.
Uh, there's, you can re-reserve
some time for rebuttal, but I
don't see but one opponent, so
we should have some time for
you.
Uh, thank you Mr. Chair, um.
We won't need that much time.
I'll just Senate bill 241 is uh
automated cameras and
construction zones.
And I have with me today a
Secretary Cerner of the DOT, and
I also have with me.
General
General Consul Steve Hamilton.
And uh I'll let uh Secretary
Serner uh introduce the bill a
little bit and then we'll just
go for questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee, pleasure to be
here. Um, just a little overview
about the bill and then we'll
stand for questions. The Mexico
Department of Transportation in
partnership with the Department
of Public Safety, um, is
introducing this bill together
to use automated speed detection
in construction zones, uh,
focused primarily to enhance
safety throughout, uh, through
the issuance of civil fines.
Currently, state law allows for
local and county governments
request state transportation
commissioner commission approval
to.
replace automated speed
enforcement cameras on
state-owned roads. However, the
Department of Transportation on
its own doesn't have authority
to place automated speed
enforcement cameras on its
roads, with local government
approval, local and county
governments may also place
automated speed enforcement
cameras on their, on their own
infrastructure. However, again,
um, what we're hoping for here
is uh authority limited to work
zones, speeding in a work zone
is a major safety concern. Um,
it's significantly increases the
risk of accidents due to the
presence of construction
workers.
equipment, and unpredictable
traffic pathways between 2020
and 2023, there were a total of
3,015 work zone crashes in New
Mexico. In response, local and
state law enforcement must
increase their presence on or
around work zones between 2020
and 2024, nearly 14,000 speeding
citations were issued on work
zones by New Mexico State Police
alone. New Mexico is already one
of 42 states that authorizes the
use of automated speed
enforcement cameras in some
form. And in many cases through
the approval of the
State Transportation commission.
This legislation will expand on
that existing authority to
enhance the safety of our
workers and the traveling
public, um, in construction
zones.
And so, um, the bill was
amended, as you can see, Mr.
Chairman, members of the
committee, um, the amendment was
aimed at creating a fund to
ensure that the money
appropriated to the fund is used
solely for the purpose of
managing the highway
construction zone, automated
speed enforcement Act.
And it'll be administra
administered by the bureau in
the bills referred to the
traffic Safety Bureau for the
purposes of implementing the
provisions of this legislation,
um, and with that, we'll stand
for any questions. Thank you. We
have only one person registered
in opposition, Achilles Stout
Sanchez, I see Miss Sanchez.
given you're the only
opposition, I'll recognize you
for up to 3 minutes if you need
it.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee. Um, my name is
Kelly Stout Sanchez. I am a
trial lawyer and as a trial
lawyer, we seek to promote
justice and fairness for those
who have been harmed, and we do
this by safeguarding their
rights in particular, their
rights to access to a trial by
jury, um, and access to our
court system. Um, I stand in
opposition to SB 241 today, um,
because it removes New Mexicans'
ability to access the courts and
a jury for alleged speeding
violations. Um, this.
requires people to go through an
appointed hearing officer, um,
where the rules of evidence do
not apply, um, and are deprived
of a right to a trial by jury.
Um, it also reduces the burden
of proof to find that there is a
violation, um, and so the state
only has to prove that it was
more likely than not that the
speeding violation applies.
The bill assumes that these
cameras are always correctly
calibrated and properly
functioning, but places the
burden on the vehicle owner, um,
who's being charged with the
citation, um, to attempt to
prove otherwise, um, but again,
having to do so outside of the
rules of evidence. It's also
concerning that there's no
provision for an appeal, um, for
any, uh, uh error by the hearing
officer, for those reasons, uh,
we oppose.
Everyone, we didn't have anyone
in support or opposition. We go
to members of the committee with
questions. Senator Dewey.
You didn't know that you'd
raised your hand, did you? I did
not, Mr. Chair, but um, you
could see it on my face, um.
So, Mr. Chair, I, I am not a fan
of of this bill, um, I.
I think I, we are seeing
programs like this, uh, I think
he used abusively but in the
city of Albuquerque, um, and I
think this one, frankly is worse
because at least there they use
they apply the the rules of
evidence. Um,
This, yeah, I mean, this is kind
of contrary to to how we do
things in general, uh, putting
the burden on the, the person,
putting a strict liability on
just the owner of the car, uh,
not
Not specific to to the person
actually driving it, um, I'm
also curious and I was trying to
find here and I haven't found it
yet. How do these, Mr. Charado.
Senator, how did the the civil
fines that you are putting in
here, how do those compare to if
you were pulled over by an
officer speeding through a
Uh, construction zone.
Uh, Mr. Chair, I also have uh.
Chief
We start and he can explain that
to you, Mr. Chair.
This is my
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator Dohek,
uh, thank you for the question.
I will say I thought I have
email proof that I did sign up
as a proponent, so, uh, so we
do, uh, support the, uh, this
bill. Um, but in reference to
your specific question, so as it
stands right now, um,
Obviously depended on some other
bills that are floating around
as far as uh changes in fees,
the current fee for uh 1 to 10
over, uh, is $25. Um, so I
believe this bill is more than
that if I recall correctly.
Although it would be less than
what the proposed changes are in
the bills that are looking to uh
change the uh penalty
assessments.
Because as, as y'all may or may
not recall, um, court fees were
done away with as of July 1st of
this year, which caused all
traffic citations, uh, at least
on they go through state court
to be dropped by $57 per ticket.
Um, oh, well, well, there is
double for construction, so I
believe it's, so I, it's the
same actually right now. My, my
apologies. I forgot that the
double fines for the
construction.
And, and Mr. Chair, is that
So, so I still think this would
be more because so for for the
one for 6 to 10, it would be, it
would be the same, uh, but I, I
believe that for 11 or 15 and
I'm trying to find it now, but
it's like 35.
And so double that would be 70,
but you'd be charging here 100,
um, and then you have for 16 or
more, 200.
And I think that is.
Like there's a cutoff of 20 I
think, before you get even that
high.
I, I'm, I'm trying to find it
here, but I, I do think that,
um,
I think what we're seeing here
is the same thing that I
objected to the the city of
Albuquerque is doing that they
are that you're getting charged
more than you would.
Uh, if you were pulled over by
an actual officer. Um,
Just because it's a camera doing
the work instead of human. Um,
that doesn't make sense to me.
It doesn't make sense to me that
the rules of evidence wouldn't
apply. It doesn't make sense to
me that we are, we are taking
away the burden that is
generally placed when we are
trying to charge someone with a
violation of our laws, we're
saying putting the burden on the
person being charged here, uh,
rather than the person doing the
charging or the entity doing the
charging, um.
Again, this has the if default
is not cured, the department may
pursue all legal remedies for
collection of debt and is
entitled to an award of
reasonable attorney fees
incurred, so
I have a car that got registered
to a, an old PO box and I'm not
using that PO box anymore, but,
but if that
Address is still on my
registration and you all send a
citation there, and I don't get
it.
Uh, and then I find out about
it, um, maybe a year later when
I get pulled over again, uh, or
for something I get pulled over
for something, and now I have
I have
Who knows what charges and
potentially a bunch of attorney
fees cause they've sent it to a
collection agency, um, but that
collection agency never had my
correct contact information,
just like the people who sent
the initial citation didn't, uh,
and so now they've racked up a
whole bunch of attorney fees
because I, I did some hourly
work once. That's, that's how
you get paid by racking up those
hours, um, I, I think this is.
This is a a bad approach to
traffic enforcement, and there's
not one that I would want to
expand, um,
Or
again, and, and secretary.
I think you are a great
secretary, but frankly I would
not want the Department of
Transportation being the ones
who, who get to choose, uh,
When and where these, these get
placed. Um, with, with no other
oversight, uh, and
So I, I am a no on this bill.
Everyone's surprised,
but Mr. Chair and Senator, can I
respond to that?
OK.
OK.
So
I think we're, thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Senator Sanchez,
Secretary, the um
Because I've just read the bill
briefly would, uh, if someone
were convicted of speeding with
that information be sent to MBD
will that affect uh their
license or their insurance
policy.
Uh, Mr. Charo at uh Secretary
Serna answer that.
Senator.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Vice
Chair. No, it wouldn't. Um,
we're issuing civil penalties
and therefore the, the citations
are being issued outside of the
traffic code and therefore
wouldn't be, uh, would not
impact their score as it relates
to insurance, um, or their
driver's license.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Secretary, the, uh, I recall
another bill similar to this.
That would have signage.
And cameras, does this, would
this bill include signage if
you're approaching.
A construction zone and say
cameras are in effect and things
of that nature.
Absolutely, Mr. Chair, um, Vice
Chair.
We would probably go above and
beyond what we're doing now to
notify the drivers that they're
approaching a work zone, that
they're entering a double fine
zone. Um, so we would notify
drivers that they're approaching
the work zone and now
approaching a work zone that's
being monitored by automated
speed enforcement cameras as
well.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh,
Senator Sanchez, the, uh, just a
quick point, the, um,
We took away the the the fees
from from all.
From our criminal code cause
they didn't correlate to the
crime being committed, but in my
opinion, the judges haven't
flicked the switch.
Before the judges would be
would grant a lenient sentence,
you'd get a deferred sentence,
meaning the information will not
go to MVD. You would not.
Uh, you know, have to pay higher
insurance costs, but see my
clerk and pay the court costs,
so paying the court costs was
kind of the penalty.
Uh, now there is no court cost
and judges are still granting
deferred sentences, so there is
no consequence.
For speeding, even reckless
driving.
Racing, all that good stuff, so,
so I would just, it's a
conversation that judiciary
needs to have to.
Not grant
Deferred sentences to find them
because the fines are minimal
1525 bucks, 40 bucks, but that
it would affect your insurance
and deter you from speeding, but
on the on the page 5 of Mrs.
Truman sent her the, um, at
first I was kind of freaking out
cause.
Uh
You know, there, cause on page
3, the owner is strictly and
vicariously liable for a
speeding violation.
And then I had hope on the top
of page 5, it says the evidence
does not, you know, in other
words, how do you, how do you
beat, how do you not?
How do you beat the rap? How do
you not have to pay the fine,
the, the evidence does not show
that the subject vehicle was
involved in the alleged
violation, in other words, you
prove that that's not your car.
You sold it or or whatnot, but
you're not able to prove it's
not you.
You know what I mean? So it's
so, so you're finding the owner
of the car.
Uh, or what the driver did, and
we got to ask ourselves, is
that, is that good policy or not
at my.
And to make every car owner.
Kind of
I don't know the, put the clamps
on the cousin or the teenager
involved, but, um.
But it is uh, I like the fact
that it's gonna protect workers
uh at construction zones, it's
gonna force everyone to slow
down.
If, if you guys did come,
frankly, if you did commercials
and signs and pretended there
was cameras, I'd probably do
more to slow people down and
save people's lives.
But, um
But I'm just a little
uncomfortable with with the
procedural aspects of of the
case. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Oh, thank you, Mr. John. So, so
I'm just curious, the company,
the private company that does
this program, how much of the
fees do they get?
Mr. Chair, Senator, great
question. So, um, we'd leverage,
we leverage the expertise of
other municipalities that are
doing this, Bernalillo County,
City of Albuquerque, Rio Rancho,
for example, meaning that
they're leveraging contractors
and so we would fundamentally
enter into a contract. Uh, it
would not be our intent to tie
their service or their payment
to the amount of fees generated,
it would be for the cost of
providing the service, meaning
the installation of the cameras,
the calibration of the cameras
and the
location of those cameras from
work, one work zone to another.
And so we wouldn't attach their
payment to the amount of fees
generated ultimately the goal is
not issue the citations and if
you'll see the data from other
states as you'll just see a
dramatic decline in overall
penalties assessed and citations
issued fundamentally kind of
working our way out of the need.
So Mr. Chair, I'm just curious
if other states done cameras
that use.
The existing traffic code
penalties and use the existing.
Procedure that, that's there for
violations, so we're not kind of
creating this new civil and
course it's curious to me that
if, if one of your officers'
jeep is sitting there and pulls
me over, I get treated one way
and I have one set of rights.
And yet if your officers not
there and I get picked up by the
camera, I'm in a whole different
lane that just feels.
Somewhat strange to me, so I'm
curious if any.
These kids, these camera
programs, that's been one of the
issues that's always been of
concern to me. I, I, I just
think in fairness.
Why should someone be treated
differently if your officer
pulls them over versus they get.
The picture taking.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator, yes, to
answer your question, there's
various models throughout the
country and even in the state, I
believe the other three, the
municipalities are using the
traffic code to enforce, um, the
penalties that are issued,
meaning that there's
implications and consequences
for the driver outside of just
paying the fee.
Um, but just kind of speaking on
the, on with regard to the
concerns about the rights of the
owners, um, to appeal the
citation.
But the bill is explicit about
4, that is that.
They've sold the car and the
registration hasn't been
transferred. They can show that
they were not the driver at the
time the citation was issued,
the car was stolen, um, and
lastly, they've already been
issued a citation, uh, on that
work zone, meaning that they've
already actually uh been uh
they've already been issued a
citation for the same infraction
during that work zone. So we do
provide uh 4 venues by which the
driver can appeal the citation
if they in fact weren't to
direct.
So Mr. Chair, if I'm going 50
miles an hour over the speed
limit.
I think if I get pulled over by
the chief, I'm in deep trouble.
I'm gonna have a whole string of
consequences. It's gonna go to
my license under this. Am I
reading this right? I write a
$200 check and I'm done.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator, correct.
Going back to the other extreme,
if you're going 6 miles an hour
over and you don't pay the $50
fine, then you could very well
face a suspended or revoked
license, but here likely not as
stiff a consequence.
I have a little bit of heartburn
about that and then just one
final comment and I'm just
gonna.
This is, I think, I know on the
the bill that's come forward to
increase all the fines. One of
the arguments that being made
is, well, legislature, you got
rid of the $6 million in fees,
and it was $6 million something
that I certainly supported, uh,
and we were able to
Use recurring dollars because
what we were doing is funding
the courts with fees. I can
remember Chairman Martinez
sitting here for years going,
this is nuts. Someone comes in
and when you, when you look at
the actual ticket and the amount
that they're paying, only a
small fraction was the actual
fine. The bulk of those fees for
every single little thing.
It just causes me.
Concerns me that we're now
coming in and saying, oh, well,
because you did that, there's
room for us to go make up the
difference with with fines. I
don't think that that was the
purpose. I mean, I think the
issue with these fines is they
really disproportionately impact
folks. I mean, someone that can
write.
You know, a $200.
A $200 ticket and this, this you
write the $200 ticket for going
50 miles an hour and inside an
area and you, you walk away, for
someone else, it can be really,
that can be devastating. And so
it's just it's based on income.
And so I think that's why I've
certainly carried a number of
bills like the ones that the
court did to get away from that.
So I just, I just wanted to flag
that that that, that argument
doesn't work for me. And again,
I've been pushing back against
all these fees bills that keep
coming up when we've got this
much.
money seems to me we should be
using general fund to do things
if we can, and I get it. This is
a whole philosophical, is it
actually a deterrence? I know
that's the argument that's made,
uh, but I just wanted to flag
that issue. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Questions? Other discussions,
Senator Brantley and Senator
Thornton.
Thank you, Mr. Sherman.
I, I agree that this could
snowball into a multitude. You
don't pay the ticket, you, you
lose your license, or where it
goes on and on and on, but
there's one way to avoid all
that.
Slow down. Don't speed.
I think we have been blessed in
New Mexico to have a huge
investment of infrastructure
dollars. There isn't a part of
I-25, I think you can't go 20-30
minutes, uh, from Socorro, uh,
around your district, Senator
Sanchez is in complete
construction um around the truth
or consequences area, the
Williamsburg area, that area has
been under a single lane for
almost 22 years now, and I make
this point because we have a lot
of money in New Mexico to
continue to spend, and so we
should expect that we're gonna
have construction zones and.
areas and high-speed areas for a
long, long time. I don't see
this as much of a moneymaker and
I will say that because the
potential consequences of what
can happen for speeding through
some of those zones are a lot
greater than a $200 speeding
ticket, and we've seen that just
at the Williamsburg
construction, there's been a
number of people that have lost
their lives over the last 2
years, and that dangerous
construction zone and so, um,
for the sake of work crews.
The speeding cars come up on
backed up lanes of semi trucks.
This isn't about.
fees or fines or an opportunity
for New Mexico to make money.
This is an opportunity to keep
New Mexicans safer on the road,
and if, if there's an uh an
opportunity to deter one person
who thinks that there is likely
to be a speeding camera up ahead
coming into this construction
zone. I am supportive of it
because I'd hate to be the
person in front or my daughter's
in front of that, and it's
happening every day on our roads
and so I, I am supportive of it.
So thank you for bringing it
forward.
I like this bill, but there's
part of it that. So one of the
issues I struggle with here is
the right to appeal.
And I think you gave 4 reasons
with regards to how one would
appeal.
So being a technology person,
my, my first question would be,
what if I wanted to appeal the
calibration of the camera, that
wasn't one of the reasons you
you gave for for being able to
push back.
And I, and I see it in chapter,
let's see, page 6 that you
talked about these cameras being
calibrated on an annual basis.
Let's say it's 11 months past.
And um it's gone through a whole
season, expansion, reductions.
depending on all kinds of
things, things can get out of
calibration. What if I wanted to
challenge that?
That doesn't seem like I would
be able to do that. I'd have to,
I would ask for that camera to
come down and I'd wanna know
the, the number of that camera,
when it was last calibrated. I
mean, I would, I want to fight
the bill, fight the the ticket.
That's what I would do.
So
Would that be an allowable
challenge.
OK.
We don't you trust me my,
uh, Mr. Chairman, Senator, uh,
I'm Steve Hamilton, um, with
general counsel of the
department.
Uh, these 4 defenses are not the
only defenses you would have.
Um, it's the burden of the
department to show by a by a
preponderance of evidence that
the car was speeding.
And if you wanted to show that
the calibration was inaccurate
or was not working correctly and
that you were not speeding, you
certainly could put on that
evidence. This does not bar
that.
I'd also point out that it's a
civil civil matter.
And the idea of it being
something other than a
preponderance of evidence would
be unusual in a civil matter
because that's the standard.
Standard of proof.
Um, it also is not uncommon.
In agency proceedings, PRC
hearings, um, all sorts of
hearings that.
The matter is handled by a
hearing officer and the rules of
evidence do not apply.
All of the PRC hearings, for
instance, are on the, on the
same basis.
So that's not particularly, it
should not be a particular
burden on this, on this
particular kind of an
enforcement.
And it's also important that
In terms of, in terms of this
penalty, it is only a civil
penalty, as the Secretary said
does not go to your driving
record. So it doesn't have that
kind of an effect.
It is not a criminal, criminal
charge. And in regard to um uh
Senator Wirth's concern that
somehow, if somebody was driving
50 miles over the speed limit
that um they would only get a
speeding ticket from the state
police. I suggest that
somebody's doing 50 miles over
there. There are other, there
are other statutes such as
reckless driving that would come
into play, that would, that have
much stiffer penalties than than
merely speeding.
So, um, it's, it's a way to,
it's a way to protect the
workers and reading zones and
the, the penalties are quite
frankly, and and and and as as
Senator Brantley pointed out the
penalties are, are pittance
compared to the dangers to the
people that are working in that
construction zone.
Thank you for that. I
I, I understand that and I.
Um
I, I'm struggling with, with
that, that particular issue
because um you're right, $200 am
I gonna, am I gonna actually go
through, I, if I have to prove
that that I have to take that
camera down myself and and prove
to you that it was a calibrated
properly.
And I'd get in trouble for that
as well, I'm sure, so, so it's
when the preponderance is is the
burden that the owner has the
burden of proving a defense
allowable, and so it's, it's
sort of like we're reversing our
judicial system in some form
because we're being required to
defend it.
And, uh, as opposed to being
considered innocent first, even
though we have a camera that
says you were speeding.
Mr. Chairman Senator, there
wasn't really a question there.
That was, I'm sorry. I'm,
I'm sorry,
that's just a comment. Thank you
very much. I know it's uh like I
said, you want to respond to
every statement maybe but we'll
never get out of here, so, um,
Senator De for another time
around very briefly, uh, Mr.
Chair, I'll just say, you know,
there was a statement made that
these 4 defenses aren't the only
Senses. That's not what the bill
says.
The bill says the following
allowable defenses.
And then it lists those 4. So
those are the allowable
defenses, um.
There's nothing in here that
says you can also.
Have a defense based on the
calibration. And because not
only the rules of evidence, but
the rules of civil procedure
don't apply. You can't get
discovery to find out about the
calibration.
That's all.
I'm just gonna go last. I am
chair and I appreciate very much
the observation of some of my
colleagues. It's really great to
see the lawyers coming out of
the non-lawyers on the committee
a little bit, uh, the uh counsel
do respect you're reading the
bill wrong. uh, Senator Dewey is
correct and uh Senator
Thornton's right as well too,
the nonlawyer, which is the way
this is worded, this limits the
defenses to only those defenses,
um, and although you will tell
me those are not the only
limitations, that's not the way
it reads, its.
Those are limitations and
Senator Thornton's right,
everybody who's ever fought a
speeding ticket before and goes
and asks for the calibration and
so we're the the cheap, I'm sure
he's probably seen that my guess
is when you all do radar,
running, you're calibrating
every morning or every time you
go on shift, isn't that right?
Yeah, so he's saying, yeah, so
every time you go on shift,
you're calibrating the radar
equipment. Here, the bill would
say you only have to calibrate
once a year. Ah, it's gonna be a
pretty easy ticket to beat, but
you're right, Senator Thornton,
the bill would prohibit that,
um, there's, um, there's some
mixtures of too many things that
don't make sense in the law. On
page 3, subsection B, it says
the owner is strictly and
vicariously liable. Those are
two very different things and
putting the word and between
them suggests they have some
correlation, but they don't.
Strict liability is one thing,
uh, vicarious liabilities is an
entirely different thing.
So you wouldn't join those two
concepts at all. Uh, that
wouldn't make any sense at all,
um, the suggestion in, in line
18 when a vehicle has more than
one owner, all of the owners are
jointly and severally liable.
That would fly in the face of
our existing law that relies,
relates to joint several
liabilities. So that, that would
be inconsistent with the law as
well.
The uh the uh page 4 we've
already covered that, that line
about the request for hearing
allowable defenses is, is
preclusion is preclusive. In
other words, it says you can
only do these, um.
If there's a hearing not
requested, it talks about
default on page 5, it says if
there's a default, the
department may pursue all legal
remedies for collection of the
debt. We've already talked about
that here in other bills about
reasonable limitations on
collection of debt. It also says
the department's entitled to an
award of reasonable attorney's
fees. I don't know that we do
that, um, in this committee at
all with this type of areas of
the law, that would be unusual.
You've already heard criticism
on page 5 about.
Uh, this bill would say you
don't apply rules of evidence.
But then in the sub subparagraph
right below that paragraph 2,
that's exactly what you say is
hearing officer Shell, ah.
Ensure orderly exchange of
relevant information, what is
relevant or not relevant is the
rules of evidence and procedure.
So you're saying you're not
going to use evidence of
procedure, then you go on to
say, that's what the hearing
officer should do, and he goes
on to say the hearing officer
may exclude irrelevant evidence
again, that's rules of civil
procedure. So it it's
inconsistent, uh, and it also
says that the, the hearing
officer can limit repetitive or
unduly cumulative evidence that
is also a rule of of evidence in
a procedure, so the bill is
inherently inconsistent there.
One on page 6, it says the final
decision shall be supported by
competent evidence. I think
that's um axiomatic.
Um, then it goes on to say that
the department has certain
burden but also says the owner
has a burden of proving their
defense. You've already heard
others say that completely turns
around our system of justice.
Uh, then it goes on as, as I
think that are worth expressed
some concern. I just concluding
there, the, the notion of having
fines collected and appropriate
to the bureau, uh, take us back
to the old days where, yeah,
there's gonna be an incentive to
try and capture as many people
as many fees as possible,
because the fees are going to go
right back into the department
for the program, so, uh, for
those reasons, I won't support
the bill on the passage.
Senator Doigg
Move to the table.
All right. The motion before the
committee is to table a roll
call vote, please Emily.
Yeah
Yes.
I'm sorry, I'm
He's the only one. I'm.
I do
Yes.
Senator O'Malley.
Yes, and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Senator Paul.
Senator Stewart.
Senator Thornton
That work
No to explain.
Yes,
uh, bill is tabled to members
asking to explain was it you
said O'Malley, and Senator Ma.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I, I too am very concerned about
the safety and welfare of of
those construction workers.
Um, and, um, I don't have a
problem with implementing a
camera program. Uh, however, as
was pointed out, there's just a,
there's just uh too many
problems with the bill, and I
think uh and I hope
That, um
Somehow those things will be
corrected in some way, but yeah,
I, I that, for that reason, I
can't support it.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Senator Sanchez. So
before
We had fees.
And then if you didn't pay the
fees, you got a warrant, and
then if you got pulled over, you
got sent to jail, and then you,
if you couldn't afford
uh they still couldn't afford
the fine, you got like 25 bucks
for each day in jail, and that
was our system and I fought
against that system tooth and
nail.
Here we are 15 years later and
we don't have fees, so we, we're
proposing fines, and if you
don't pay the fine, you don't
get a warrant, you go to
collections and if you don't pay
it, you don't go to jail, you it
dings your credit score. So we
have to make a choice.
We left the old system, but we
don't want to jump into this new
system. Thank you, Mrs. Chung.
Thank you very much, uh,
Senator, the bill is tabled. My
regrets to Senator Gonzalez for
not being here. We thank all of
you for being on the committee.
We have two matters left before
the committee, Senate Bill 214
and 279. We have a dinner that's
now called, uh, my apologies to
all of you, but we're gonna take
a 30 minute break from 6:30 to
7:00, we'll be back at 7 in the
room. My apologies to all of you
who are waiting, I know many of
you've been here for a long
time, but, um, this is the way
we have to work around here, so
we'll come back to 27.
is our first step, and then
we'll conclude with Senator
Brantley on 214 to conclude our
work. Thank you.
