the redistricting process I had
a chance to visit with them and
the some of the Senate Judiciary
staff members yesterday they
give us a very good presentation
several other senators who are
here today to I think probably
participate in an interesting
discussion and learning

principles will guide our entire

forty minutes so please

to leave about twenty minutes

I'd call the principles of

to talk about some of the most

As Mister Olson said you know
the the courts have decided that
when you're trying compressional

close and in in the tenant
what kind of justifications can
there be for veering off of that
ideal population and
congressional districts here
and it was justified by the
neutral traditional policies of
of redistricting like not
small deviations where
the the equal equal population
one person one vote rule was was
not complied with.
a state legislative bodies of
the state house or state Senate
there's more leeway that's given
the ideal population is going to
be presumptively constitutional
so it doesn't mean that it's
necessarily constitutional but
it does have that presumption
discriminatory reason.
And the the question presented
in this even will K. in

So is this is the last case we
kind of have had written up
obviously this is not a a

another challenge.
Of a map on the grounds that
really emphasizes when you're
examining a district for a
voting rights violations that
you you look at the whole
district you look at the whole
at all the lines of the district
area.
And
one of the issues that came up
in this case was that then that
the map that was being
challenged really didn't violate
really complied with a lot of
those traditional
principles and the question
arose do you have to show that
the map has departed from those
principles in order to show
really funny looking districts

requisite for bringing that kind
So those those are really the so
the sort of highlights and
lowlights of the decisions that
have come out on these kind of
redistricting concepts over the
last decade or so.

under section two.

see if those were just
traditions that the case that
the state had carried out over
the years and it's redistricting

some amount of of deviation from

the that can be justified by
adherence not just to stay
for example but if there are
other considerations given

you know I'm part of starting

interested in is winning
to have folks access the courts
which is I think is a good thing
but I want to make sure that
what we do will withstand
scrutiny so if I may just take a

those well for the for the level

lead to the maps communications

deviation from the legal
principles that ought to be
followed and us that some of
you know when there is a
challenge of the that that's
going to be something that
everybody looks at is what what
we're the thought process is
what were the discussions over
that I think is a moment that
I'd like to
emphasize a bit from our
discussion yesterday.
In the past redistricting
sessions I've been part of an
we an actor and and frankly we
do that purposefully it is a
matter history that may or may
not be wise with us we we
historically don't create a
court could scrutinize what our
intent was and and that's with
the courts may be looking at is
what what is our intent when we
passed something like a
redistricting plan things are
very different this session.

probably support that it's a

Of partisan gerrymandering if
you will drawing lines based on
on party advantage is non

think Mister Olson can speak to
that as well
you know I think I think that
there there's certainly many who
would agree with with the
assessment that there there's
more of a hands off approach the

necessitated those those
justice Ginsburg of who still
live at the time wrote in
