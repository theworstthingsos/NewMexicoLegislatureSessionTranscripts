our increased exemption for
things like motor vehicles tools
equipment exemptions for things
like household goods

In the year unmuted.
Thank thank you madam chair and
representative Ely
members of the committee as
Representative Eli said half of
we are very grateful to the
sponsors for bringing this bill
and this is the product of
collaboration between consumer
advocates vacancy advocates and
experts with that with the
also been endorsed by the A. R.
P..
Many years ago that the
legislature that and enacted
exemption laws and in doing so
recognize the balance between
that balance these laws in some
cases have not been updated the
very long time
In some cases I I believe it's
close to close to seventy years
sections one and two of the bill
and just give a brief overview
of those no go ahead and turn it
over to Mr Mack to to explain
that the title forty two
wages are getting at least the
state minimum wage it also
closed the loophole so that we
just can't be taken out of a
bank account.
currently the statute only
provides that wages up to the
Mexico's minimum wage laws.
Also at present creditors can
access exempt wages once they've
been deposited in a bank account
we're talking about an update
allow those those wages to
retain their that status once
they are deposited.
The second section is the the
form of punishment in the
statutory in New Mexico
playing with them since and and
and allows them to fully
informed of their lawful
exemption right.
So Mr Mack and and madam chair
although had turned over to my
colleague.
historically the purpose of
exemption loss has been to allow
debtors to keep certain items of
property or personal property up
to dollar eight minutes and
maybe set forth in the statutes
are.
so long as they are
unincorporated businesses for
not part of a legal partnership
so it's not just individual
with just a couple of exceptions
article forty two is not in
amended or updated since
Mexico exemption laws of fallen
far behind the times and really
the purpose as representatives
demanding news coverage of
For example as you'll see in
article forty two section the
committee substitute are
are not protected under New
Mexico law.
On its face only furniture it's
protected so appliances medical
equipment and supplies
You also allow a couple of fire
many I've had many clients over
and some state laws which to
protect some government benefits
such as social security or
veterans benefits or public
protect individuals rights to
receive these benefits whether
the social security benefits
disability benefits unemployment
To bring in more current with of
which it has not been updated
for decades at this point in
time and we someone expanded
two year protection period for
individuals recently widowed.
so that in the event that person
may needs of.
of their spouses or her spouse
they could claim.
Spouse's exemption as well so
they can protect their homestead
So that is reached overview of
the article forty two section
which does have any subdivisions
to it so with this point madam
Madam chair let me just conclude
with a couple remarks before we
take questions I do want to make
it clear that we're talking
about the committee substitute
house bill thirty six I I made a
corrected on that on the other
thing that I want to mention is
is that just a couple of hours
ago I did hear from John
Anderson with the New Mexico
bankers association
high in view of the inclusion of
a call up and he wants to
discuss revision the homestead
increases what I've agreed to do
because we're now at the
and saw one eight committee
members know that and with that
and I'm sure we will stand for
questions.

portion of the bill which brings
in some maintenance to
particular questions that may
pertain to those two other
statutes I just referenced with

Thank you for your patience
committee members in public as
we try this out.
Fifty more seconds if you'd like
to weigh in on the call.
We're going to move to public
comment now will start with
those in opposition if there's
anyone with this undue in
And then invite you to make a
brief comment.
you are now allowed to speak
Richard.
Of good morning on chairman this
is a Richard live all I'm most
director and we are a highly in
favor of this legislation we
believe that of we need to this
type of legislation in order to
be able to help law enforcement
Richard so yes we had Richard in
support of this legislation do
we have any folks out there in
the R. as in the audience today
that wanted to speak in
Okay we will move to those in
the audience in support of this
legislation if you're interested
in making a public comment B. as
Monty our market and did you
have to and yourself and please
be concise.
Hello good afternoon my name is
Marie Thompson I'm calling as
on house bill thirty six.
As you may know New Mexico legal
aid is the largest legal
services provider in the state
with eleven regional offices
New Mexico legally is strongly
in support house bill thirty six
we believe the bill strengthens
the safety net for the poorest
and most vulnerable New Mexicans
by protecting a basic minimum
impacted by this bill.
We recently advised a home
healthcare worker living in the
southeast region of the state
whose paychecks are being
interest that bill became a six
thousand dollar judgment against
her and she has been being
garnished for the past two years
bill is that it would prevent
that from happening and ensure
that workers are making at least
there are local or state minimum
wage.
we also frequently have to
be subject to a foreclosure by
judgement creditor if they have
more than sixty thousand dollars
as in home equity which is the
current level of the homestead
exemption so this bill again
would bring the homestead
critical now with high levels of
unemployment and with so many
families being behind on their
bills and on the verge of
becoming homeless I hope you'll
support this much needed update
Thank you next it looks like we
have rob.
Rob you have to meet yourself
but you know allowed to speak.
And I just a few cut brief
comments if you love us first is
that this
other laws and sensual
Reese's amounts like I said
earlier there hasn't been an
and.
Hello we lost you for a minute
if you could repeat.
All right I just we're all
trying to figure this out.
So.
offering us a few bits of
insight so thank you.
Okay well at the point I was
wanting to make was this just
jurisdictions as well as
increases in some recognized
cost of living increase because
they it's been decades since a
lot of these provisions were
but they're just consistent with
the cost of living they're
they're not beyond that
And the the only other point I
so to speak legal aid and center
line poverty the bankruptcy for
portions of the Civil consumer
bar and they are the ones that
see how this of these exemptions
realities for example with the
homestead exemption
One of there's a definite a
change in definition that would
and so this proposed bill would
clarify the
that's all I have to say really
I just I would urge folks to
been practicing bankruptcy law
for thirty six years now since
nineteen eighty four in these
exemption laws of these now are
the exact same they were in
nineteen eighty four which is
increase these exemptions I in
nineteen eighty four you could
buy a new car for four thousand
dollars which is what I think
the legislature's had in mind
Increase the exemption.
Substantially in addition under
the section while you're allowed
to keep one car I guess
they only thought one car was
As many vehicles you want up to
the minute which is twenty
thousand dollars for a couple
ten thousand per car.
home says the same thing value
heritage or the dispose of
equity over the years especially
older couples but nobody
nobody's house is only worth
sixty thousand dollars anymore
and therefore they can file
since they have been increased
and well over thirty five years
The other important aspect is
the personal property exemption
filed bankruptcy and there's two
thousand dollars in your bank
account the bankruptcy trustees
gonna take.
The paycheck of the bill Levin
paycheck to paycheck because
they can only exempt of the five
people be allowed to keep a
reasonable amount of money in
their bank accounts to survive
on.
to be protected from creditors
I think it's this this is a bill
that should definitely be Aston
in the sections to be amended
were still in the audience and
wanted to weigh in with public
comment please raise your hand
now otherwise we're gonna go to
Alan as I lawspeaker.
like to speak to a broader
issue.
with regard to bankruptcy.
the concept of exemptions is of
start and I would add it allows
people to have a meaningful
fresh start.
Imagine if bankruptcy were just
forever and you could not keep
These.
The fresh start through the
exemptions gives them an
opportunity to get back on their
feet and move forward.
Took a real advantage of that
fresh start.
Or Henry Ford and Walt Disney
both of whom went through
bankruptcy earlier in their
lives.
company.
In in in in that kind of strange
way bankruptcy has been a very
positive thing to our economy
thousands of people so well that
doesn't happen to the average
person.
Having a fresh start and a real
chance of life we can.
for this bill because I think
it's very important for many
citizens in New Mexico
seeing no further hands up for
public comment we are now going
to the committee and I see first
we have a speaker Egolf.
In the second to get to the
Thank you madam chair I am
wondering your responses coming
would it be a good idea to index
Mr speaker
chair I didn't hear the entire
question I'm sorry you can throw
I'm here
would would would not be in a
good idea to index the numbers
next the next twelve months that
we don't have to then this bill
again.
madam chair Mr speaker I'm gonna
turn the question over to Mr
Mack.
of section of article forty two
section fourteen is the bill
what.
So every two years and it is
All I see is a sixteen.
Yes age sixteen of the committee
substitute bill.
not as often
to update figures there is the
cost of living or Cola
adjustment every two years which
on July first.
sections of the bill or certain
sections will be
adjusted automatically and
should be it is tied to the CPI
you madam chair who does it.
You know we I think we would
need to have some entity of
government.
Since the preceding year and
announces the public way so
that.
We don't have a fight in court
over.
Well give you know you when it
With the department of finance
industry your ex extremity in
government to.
with lawyers following the
committee and see there's
something we can work out on
that assuming this bill and
seven tax I think it's a good
suggestions sure I can do.
and then madam chair I know that
in these in Texas you are
listening right it.
You know you get the your our
your house and the tools of your
session for the tools of the
trade.
If you know.
A lot of houses I presume where
the.
Bankrupt parties at our works.
Madam.
Madam chair I'll defer to Mister
mac.
bankruptcy what happens is the.
First appointed to oversee the
bankruptcy case will do an
evaluation of the current fair
cursive industry expenses sale
expenses and miscellaneous
expenses along the way.
And able if they are if the
make a business decision taking
into account all the costs
whether or not after
the docking for the various

You must pay the exemption
amount to the debtor OR debtors.
And that.
In fact very sixpence
creditors so occasionally the
depending on what the dollars
are.
involved in make a business
of property and not so much.
And proceed from there.
Yes let's let's say madam chair
the there's a residence in is
worth five hundred thousand
the house would be sold right.
Based on the numbers we're
proposing and using your
It would appear to me that.
That would put that house at
high risk of being seized and
sold.
So depending on whether or not
petition was filed by a married
couple they would be able to
double that to three hundred
thousand dollars.
Leaving two hundred thousand
box there so and two hundred
thousand dollars.
Even after expenses and just for
the sake of argument
still would leave unprotected
hypothetically
one hundred fifty thousand
dollars which would once again
And.
After expenses and paying the
exemption back to the debtor OR
debtors still would leave a
On.
You're very you know sympathetic
to the.
could be higher madam chair.
You know especially.
You know
it the.
Average home prices.
the average home price of course
it was five hundred thirty one
thousand dollars.
yeah the median household value
in Santa Fe is coming up to
close to six hundred thousand I
to see that number higher I
think the value of the cars is
fine you know because if the
cars were twenty feet yet the
car is worth twenty thousand
The taken but in the house
keys especially because if we're
doing a bankruptcy of the
possibility that there's kids in
the family or you know an
elderly relatives living there
know like other states to I
think did you the limits they
are here for all of the other
categories are reasonable but I
think I would.
Mr speaker madam chair I'm I'm
all for that I mean if if that's
something that we can do to
would not be unfriendly in the.
Especially chair right now given
all that I think we're afraid of
happening
when dimensionally the you know
would.
Probably something we would be
of benefit very soon in our
state.

with the consider ation muster

me to say something so this
would be your opportunity
missed.
Thank you Representative you
live Representative well
I would for.
I would.
In my thank you some of my
colleagues but.
There would be no downside to
such friendly amendment because
I believe that would be
consistent with long standing
that and legislative intent has
always been to protect.
As much as possible
The basic necessities for
the vehicle did become of the
card and we proceeded from there
what.
At this point I see no downside
to such a friendly amendment as
proposed by speaker Egolf.
Madam chair the point.
Yes I think that's
Representative McQueen on that
point.
Thank you madam chair mentor
Yes.
So.
Madam speaker you don't concern
would be.
You know there is a home sold in
So.
It would make sense to me that
there would be an upper limit.

that you look carefully at the

part of.
Or foreclosure by a judgment
creditor.
And you've already said stated
that Mexico is a foreclosure

And basically this says if you
can't you can't do that I think
you may need to add some
language here that would make it
clear that if you're for closing

I'm so madam chair

And I see we have a committee
The madam chair if you don't
mind waiting we're just going to
confirm that your experts were
promoted to panelists before you
start.
I see we have David had a meal
in.
It looks like we're still I'm
trying to find the other two

Matt Madam chair under the care
of the experts and okay thank
you for that madam chair if
you're ready with your bill will
get started.
Great thank you very much you
know we don't have any new
improved version rather late in
the thirty day session and the
City of Albuquerque have brought
this to me late in the session
if we are successful in getting
the bill out of the
this very committee but.
The violence intervention
What this bill proposes to do is
is really expand the program
statewide through first to
Prime right now and so it's
actually meant to be available
to counties to municipalities
really would like the folks in
the city to to do that they
couldn't give you a basis for it
that we want perhaps we might
need a few technical changes to
make sure that it will it
includes the counties and so
forth but we can do that after
conference room.
Good afternoon chairwoman.
Casey and that is the members of
the committee my name is Jerry
expert panelists I'm gonna have
them introduce themselves before
going on.
My name is New Brunswick
commander the criminal
adviser to the opportunity.
members of the committee and
madam chair we're proposing a
bill to create a fund for
deterrence law enforcement
strategy to impact and sustain a
reduction of violent crime in
New Mexico.
This bill is proposed to create
program funds.
The violent crime is defined in
the bill as firearm related
homicide shootings with injury
strategies to reduce violent
crime.
Municipal county and tribal
governments will be eligible for
the funding.
people are greater and the fund
also guarantees to requests be
reserved for on New Mexico the
news so full counties or tribal
defined goals as well as
measureable objectives.
madam chair and members of the
committee on many municipalities
thirteen are the highest elected
prime rates assault against
person and homicides.
Or in districts one two three
Mexico knows no boundaries for
violent crime.
Law enforcement strategies to
reduce violent assaults and gun
violence have not created and
proven across the nation it's a
research strategy and it it
impacts the reduction of and it
will impact the reduction of
Turn this over to my colleague
commander needs language from
the Albuquerque police
department the talk a little bit
about how this currency has been
that actually shows the work
rather than us just talking
about it.
Madam language.
Madam chairman honorable members
of the committee.
safety partners and other
departments within the city that
works with social services and
resources so one of the the the
very first steps is identifying
the shooting with injury or a
homicide involving a firearm we
are meeting as public safety
partners and we're identifying
all of the individuals involved
these individuals are looking at
criminal backgrounds to see if
there are
previous cases are previous
these high risk individuals.
Other customized team consisting
of law enforcement and social
services to go out and to
deliver intervention message
retaliation to where they
themselves are now subject of a
criminal case and and
incarcerated so it's a matter of
of providing them
so a lot of times and and in my
experience with the with with
policing there are underlining
move causes which caused in the
visuals to commit criminal acts
see what type of resources can
really help these individuals
better their quality of living
whether if it's just basic all
there's a lot of good resources
that we're hoping that these
individuals will turn to and
they won't resort to
committing violent violent crime
shown in the past behaviors
incidents that the that they
have been associated with
violent crime and and
specifically gun crime and
giving them this opportunity
week sheeter for being involved
in future incidents.
Just some few statistics we've
done
about ninety of these
interventions which we we which
of those eight two of them
immediately reached out and and
took advantage of the service of
these services so and that's
what this program still being
eight twenty five percent we're
going to see much more of these
individuals come on board and
and realize that there are
members of this community that
want to support them and want
of one of these interventions
that we've done just to kind of
show what these interventions
are bell and the message that
we're but that we're telling.
what you're about to be shot I
right so we want you to kill we
want to see you get injured for
you personally ensuring that we
to be able to to to to work with
you to see if the resources are
outreach for services that we
can connect you with to help you
out with whatever that is one of
those appointments callously
lot that.
the last thing I would want to
let you know before I turn it
over this depending on your
depending on the record you
could be charged for the service
of okay the LFC suppose Office
of the executive the case where
if you go away federally the
record when you try to give you
all schools for education or I
for a job in New Mexico if you
can really have for your life
doing in so is this just a form
that is not a scare tactic for a
everyone now and the community
will just keep the price of the
other
Well it's a one on one and I you
know I you guys use one right
you guys have as you guys have
provided you know just wanted to
boxes are the pods are for
Marshall to drop around the US
I'm not awake right really
more shots than though that's
one of the.
Basically Google that you know
this.
and I live in the center and
they will tell you I lived in
references and there was you
know going out back in the day I
was embarassing guns then
nowadays is that it's going to
have yeah yeah that's what we're
hoping the lake but as long as
of our cities are full service
for the.
Wonder and.
And from the inside of.
So if you call me and talk to
the.
You have to do to get a handle
The president wanted to make
sure I have been spent so.
Does.
I've managed to change my life
There's a lot of renewable for
with with job training education
whatever.
also a member of them local.
piece of all I am a community
services.
Okay and I it is not a legal
what do you run with a group of
The we the first with social
services but we also talk about
what the future ramifications
participants that potential
felony would come his way
because he already had a felony
that if we picked up a gun that
that that could be a potential
community the other thing I
wanted to point out is that you
can see that there was active
up in an environment it didn't
yes ma'am protective factors
that actually gave him a lot of
that we live and now you got
shot so you know commander
language those want to point out
the statistics they will
with this person around
substance abuse services
and referrals were made for
substance abuse services so I I
about it and.
so we can take any questions or
comments on the bill the work.
Mr speaker.
madam chair if you'd like to go
to public comment that's great.
Thank you madam so just for
participate they can indicate
their support for or against
this bill house bill one oh two.
Really this open for a minute.
At the end of this committee

Please of.
Raise your hand it to you.
The first person we have up here
Representative is audible
Committee of I am Richard Roybal
representing of luck New Mexico
on behalf of of our state
this bill we believe it's going
to enhance law enforcement we we
believe that the community
policing is a one of the highest
proceed in favor of this bill
thank you so much.
Thank you we're going next to
someone that's appearing on my
screen as T. my god.
Representative thank you thank
you madam chair committee
members my name is terra mention
it and I Representative members
of the national rifle
association in the state of New
bill I've learned a lot from
listening to the presentation of
of the measure that on chairman
Chasey has brought I do want to
potential impact or non impact
on lawful gun owners because
crime prevention is a laudable
goal and it's something I think
we can all agree on that crime
injury and death review
committee
we're concerned that this will
become a jumping off point for
recommendations for gun control
proposals.
committee
have to do with collection of
data which already seems to
appear
on the New Mexico department of
and deaths in New Mexico so I
think that information is
already available for interim
committees to digest and decide
about the lack of a definition
in the bill of community based
organization
these groups according to the
And I think the the definition I
think there needs to be a better
definition of what a community
based organization this so that
there is a tiny and to
definition.
Such as an organization
That an organization that offers
programs that are.
that's just a suggestion that I
think would allow a lot of
concerns about tax payer money
ending up in the hands of gun
control groups without all all
closed and thank you for the
Thank you we're moving on
we had someone that had raised
their hands Maranda did you
still want to speak I just saw
your hand lowered.
Otherwise we will go to people
on the on a C. one where that is
just appeared
and Maxwell in please again
introduce yourselves for the
I'm here you against the.
Yeah okay I my name is Sam
Maxwell and live in Santa Fe and
she's probably trying to get
reconnected now so she would
still like to comment but yes
and we just feel as a as a
matter of of principal and on
the ground that by working with
high creating risk groups in
talk about that we can target
Immediately save lives so we're
really really in favor of this
this community policing approach
and hi I can't see any downside
Our lawmakers Gail Chasey for
introducing it.
Thank you we do have more end of
the school is hand up again and.
We'll go to her next after that
public comment.
Can you hear me now yes Miranda
governmental going you're not
eight the concerns of the NRA
and I heard what terror was
saying was that this is not
about taking away guns from law
abiding citizens respect second
amendment rights this is really
hundred seventy two people shot
and killed in New Mexico
thousands were injured and out
of those kids a hundred and
fifty eight were gun related
homicides to put this in
perspective as of December
dollars a year on D. W. I.
programs and this is good this
is showing positive results
reduction of D. W. I. Taos New
Mexico does not dedicate any
don't have the data we need the
firearm injury really desperate
you committee through this fund
would allow the committee to
investigate what circumstances
that gun violence in this
country New Mexico is costing
the country billions of dollars
a year I know one young woman
who was shot five times the
dollars a year and that will be
for the rest of her life.
The list of additional costs as
long including emergency
services law enforcement
investigations medical and
mental health services prison
costs and court costs the
continue to ignore the cost of
gun violence in our state and in
my humble opinion I think we
should consider this because of
the different devastating
effects on violence is having on
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Bree to guarantee and I work
with to we on a coop I support
house bill wanted to on behalf
zoom here today would like to
make your comments please raise
your hands now.
Next is Joe C. model.
Mexico and I'm also a member of
the last council eighty fifty
seven on the vice president I've
seen first hand working with
Jerry and her staff with the of
January Albuquerque has seen at
least eleven shootings are you
turn on the TV and and your
victims of the crime we've also
met with the interim police
chief and with the more of
Albuquerque and we were really
impressed with their community
only way we're going to improve
the the crime in our city it's
it's scary to even live in areas
think it's the right thing to do
I think we need to invest money
in these kinds of innovative
programs of that don't just work
on arrests and incarcerations
strongly support as a resident
of Albuquerque bill this bill I
when they apply for this but one
of the areas that we've found
that we we would like you to
consider is when you set up
boards like the firearm injury
community folks can apply for
and be accepted to those boards
until we begin of our community
crimes you know crimes can't be
stopped so I think that this is
a good bill I strongly strongly
as a residence afforded and as
thank you so much for the
opportunity if you.
Thank you so much and thank you
for the members of the public
that weighed in today and joined
us V. is doing for our public
Madam chair he may be presenting
and another committees and we go
if we could get that payment
because.
I'm fiveyear now I'm here.
where the legislation is
intended and I support that
going to the DA's office in
Albuquerque on their gun
reduction violence program that
highlight some of this M. I
apologize because I miss part of
the introduction and all because
I was in another committee.
propose that we strike it and
that we're going to put that
it's going to go to the DA's
office and the police department
your sheriff's department and
Of the things we need to do to
Amanda and left the madam chair
of make the notes be been
texting back and forth as well.
intend but when I look at that
shootings is that shooting at
the gun range shooting a gun in
the air what is that you have
you know so that might be
And I don't know if you have
comments on those two that I've
spoken about already.
Let me just say that
Representative ream did ask if
we could talk before this bill.
Representative night told him I
was.
national rifle association press
release and it seemed like they
didn't understand the
legislation referred to
I guess.
community based programs is.
There is a mental health
component here and we want to
give folks an opportunity to
participate in the programs they
young man had had some good
experiences in his community
before he dropped out of school
justice system response like the
district attorney's office so I
don't think that would.
work but on page nineteen it's
Actual shooting shooting those
are what we're after here so I I
wouldn't I don't think shooting
and shooting range would be
based organizations I think we
need to type that up because
part of community policing is
working with if you will
community based organizations to
and accomplish what you want on
the shootings aspect I think we
need to go ahead and list like
aggravated battery shooting at a
range and shooting your gun.
I don't know if you have a
response to that or not no I
public health approach.
Who is this and what is a.
many members Representative
during
Research based
evidence based.
Community based service
providers that receive monies
from the state so
we needed to put that in there
make sure that the work that
folks are doing.
Is has impact and can be
measured.
so that applies not only to the
community based service
provision also applies to the
the
You were referencing that
based on it it's a new policing
strategy wells are brand new
policing strategy but it it
includes problem oriented
that that a crime.
And those crimes that they're
committing and then it is
serves to seek a partnership
between the community and the
To the strategies.
So that there's actual impact.
So I hope that helps clarify the
reasoning for that language in
and research based I have a
problem with the public health.
Public health is not in this you
shouldn't be in this.
With mass shootings and we're
not talking about the shooting
range but shootings of citizens
and in neighborhoods where there
Dedicated to having that be part
of this the.
Well.
And for.
And one sixteen and measureable
objectives what if they're not
met do they have to give part of
Stage four one sixteen through
eighteen.
Madam chair and Representative
Rehm you know right now the
legislative finance committee.
that they provide evidence based
They provide that kind of dated
to the legislative finance
likely to continue to receive
them.
Okay.
And then madam chair and
Representative and madam chair
I'm gonna take a quick stab and
have the intervention at the
local level and have the
The the decision makers at the
local level shoes that the
Madam chair Representative Rehm
members of the committee.
think we Representative that
well but did not lift that up in
our video.
Each person that we talked to we
one of them it was customized
legally as well as customized
through service provision and we
also customize the people we
eighty interviews are pretty
outstanding.
After the eighty custom
notifications we have not seen
pick up a gun or committing
other crimes we did have one
person out of eighty get shot
again in a domestic violence
so to expand that to a statewide
level this program must be
customized per community what's
good for Albuquerque is and is
courthouse New Mexico so we
cannot
make the community service
provider agencies you can't just
put down a list because we have
important to the bill.
Madam chair and agency budget
your I.
the program I agree with.
But community based
organizations we need to tighten
the definition of more that's
create a firearm injury and
death review committee I kind of
wonder why we need to committee
of why we need to have a
committee.
Madam chair representative bring
members of the committee.
it's necessary to have a fire
Mexico to be able to measure
as we as we said at to help us
in measuring the outcomes of
putting ten million dollars
somebody there to look over that
and measure the impact
overall collectively of the work
that's being done across the
and their results and the impact
of these programs on the the
crimes that are listed in this
bill which are aggravated
assaults.
the fire arm injury and death
review committee is to sort out
all of that data and make sure
that the reporting is being done
thank you madam chair and madam
chair I think that we can
it that way
I have to go to another meeting
I don't know if there's a way to
cast my vote now but if if I'm
Thank you Representative I'm
going you're up next.
awarded to a county or
municipality but not to both of
them Mason this is the last two
I'm not sure I'm going to let
this procedure or Mr Martinez
address our.
It may be up to the applications
bill that it's the department of
health and makes the awarding
and so would be the department
of health to determine who
receives the awards one of the
thousand I'm sorry over five
hundred thousand of Albuquerque
would get this get get a certain
amount of money and so we would
want to make sure that
Bernalillo county and
And members.
My in my view is that I'll just
go to your example I mean if you
go to the police chief and co
And we're I see you problems in
a lot of other counties were a
municipalities of flu season
having to go to the chair of to
get permission to do anything.
Is that.
I guess.
My thought is you don't want to
take the bulk of the money and
have it at crossed purposes in
one of the larger
be who they the two entities to
to get together on what they're
going to
Work toward if they want to
there are probably other areas
where that is an issue and.
I I guess this is the
world I think that would work
the but we're we we don't we
live in a perfect world I I
We invested displace and over
and over again which is not
perfect but does we need to get
started.
And I think this is the right
step forward to factors I have
seen
in jail they're getting sent to
For mental health or whatever
the problem this or medical even
and
veterans like the meeting that
this medication
they took him to a hospital he
was laying on the side of the
street they pick them up they're
going to the hospital of the
three days.
And Monday morning when a first
appearance to I found out that
the.
It he will do we you wasn't a
condition.
A lot better shape than we in
Congress are in it but the
anyway we did face when face
problems but that it happens on
have some nose on it but I don't
see anybody else proposing
anything even better or close to
it so thank you madam chair.
Thank you madam chair I will try
not to repeat what the others of
stated but some I was in another
the representative from.
for Genoways comments a second
ago.
You could have if it's.
municipal government from the
side County get awards but you
couldn't have the county and the
municipalities is that accurate.
I want to make sure and check
with the the V. I. P. folks.
Madam chair madam chair I'm a
bit confused by that because.
Basically of if you have.
Various people competing as a
going to be the first person to
apply controls.
guess what I envision and I
really do want to let let the
of the response is that the
Madam chairwoman Tracy members
of the committee that's exactly
tried and of another entity such
as the county or municipality in
the same area the awarded that
is correct the the a reading of
that
components within the tribe that
maybe completely separate
considerations for either
municipality or county itself.
entity does not fall under the
jurisdiction of the county our
little by the county chair of so
therefore ain't tribal entity
Madam chair and in that regard.
They're still in competition
with each other for a limited.
Cherry madam chair.
Of.
I would say that's that's what
it would be for the department
I at the same time they're
really going to be aiming at
different individuals and in a
shared space of New Mexico.
I will governments in the
the nose full of governments
under fifty thousand population
There has to be at least two
grants to those types of
entities then there's twenty
percent goes to Albuquerque of.
The truth all.
thousand and five hundred forty
thousand.
And.
I read this assuming that two
accordance with the following
limitations and so they have a
limitation for one two and
three.
And there's no provision for.
Added to it to make it clear
that basically all
municipal both should read shall
be made to please to be
noticeable for tribal government
Representative bring one into
that of.
Why these protests were
representatives will be
selected.
That would lend their expertise
to a and some of the things
listed so
enforcement officer for the
developers certainly the state
police member service Mr from
around the state it's just
saying that I have a lot closer
outcomes of of the use of
firearms and in a responsible
way through some and yet they're
limited the to maybe one number
firearm deaths for best pause I
destroyed from far maybe the a
minute all I I was just curious
I'm sure I'm going to defer to
the V. I. P. folks on that.
committee I I can go down
through them and just kind of
give you some of the thinking
around to.
Was developed through a kind of
collective process
department the department in the
bill of course is to provide is
D. O. H. so few which collects
state already and because they
are you know overseeing the
funds we thought it would be
appropriate to have that person
be part of that review committee
legislature and to make sure
that if the recommendations you
know
or followed up on the
are carrying guns and carrying
guns in schools and the rise
we've seen in charges of youth
because so many of these crimes
go through the district point
law enforcement officer again
you know they have that
witnessing and understanding the
current situation in New Mexico
the school resource officer
because they are again
Medical Society because doctors.
See the results of gun crime
so you know of course there are
there was a lot more
I can say the list was maybe
always welcome and I heard I
actually wrote down everything
that you said and I appreciate
that input but that is why those
Directly tied to education
and.
I don't know whether
that's an appropriate.
certainly from smaller
communities like I'm from of we
have a lot of other people who
are more directly tied to to the
west of of of things and in our
I would I would even argue that
the the district attorneys are
closer to offend them the
district courts themselves
so.
in fiscal I there were some
other folks that deal with those
issues on a.
Much more regular basis and
Thank you madam chair Terry
Casey would you like to close.
Yes
appropriations but one of the
things I wanted to point out is
I did I think you are received
an email from the
By looking at gun violence and
instead of just enhancing
penalties for felons in
And my cutting out or is.
And I'm gonna fix my
connectivity probably is going
to be a week and a half and I
will
so rather than just enhancing
engage people into society and
create a community
based interventions that is more
culturally appropriate which is
why the tribal governments are
included in here and.
interesting that one of the
speakers pointed out the amount
of money we're investing in
ending
driving under the influence yeah
hope that we can look at it as.
I actually like most prevention
programs ultimately it will save
us money but it's hard to prove
Madam chair members of the
is very important
leasing strategies are changing.
Of the change in policing
strategies have been measured
and are working in other parts
