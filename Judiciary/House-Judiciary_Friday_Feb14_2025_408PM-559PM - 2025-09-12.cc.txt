Here
Representative Hoffman B. Hill.
Here.
Representative Martinez.
Speaker Martinez here.
Representative McQueen.
Here
Representative Reeb, here.
Leader Sapansky
Madam Vice Chair
Madam Chair
Madam Chair, you have a quorum.
Great, OK, so let me, um, set
the stage and I wanna talk a
little bit about amendments and
subs because we're kind of in a
funny place, um.
So representative Lundstrom
presented her House Bill 160,
there was a proposed amendment
um by Representative McQueen,
um, I suggested that we needed
to roll it because we didn't
have a 24 hour advance and I
wanna say I think that was wrong
on my part. What we should have
done is heard the amendment for
this reason.
Normally, if a sponsor is
offering an amendment or a sub,
they need to give us 24 hours.
However, I think it's unfair,
frankly to a sponsor, um, to say
we bring an amendment to
committee.
We know about it maybe an hour
before, maybe not even an hour
before, maybe right there and
then they have to roll the bill.
Um, so they're put in a
difficult spot and so I, you
know, I in thinking about the
logistics, it's a rarer thing
when that happens, but it
occasionally happens, so, um,
thank you for giving us the
opportunity to rep um Lundstrom
to experiment with this.
I'm sure you appreciate being
put off by a day, um, but I
think, uh, I, that's gonna be, I
think the approach we should be
taking, otherwise.
I mean, there is an opportunity
for someone to ambush a sponsor
and then having to roll it, and
I don't think that's fair.
So, um, with that, um, I
understand that, uh.
Representative McQueen has a.
Mitty sub
Um, which
I'm told
Replay is really a
representation of the amendment
that he sent out just in a sub
format, so it would include the
original bill.
Plus the amendment. So if it's
OK with everyone, I'm gonna talk
about the sub, OK?
Thank you, ma'am Chair.
So, ma'am, cheered the sub.
A number is 230784.2.
Um, and it was, uh, suggested to
me to do a sub.
Because it'd be cleaner going to
the floor. Um, it's a little
more confusing because the
amendment portion of the sub is
section one.
So section one is the portion
that was not in luncheon spill.
And if you look at section one,
what it's doing is.
Picking up the
Um, definitions that uh
Lundstrom has in her bill.
And applying them to a different
section of law, so the, the
section that represents
Lundstrom is amending is the
section that deals with visual
signals.
And there's a separate section.
That deals with
Uh, auditory signals.
So, uh, the language is that.
When, uh, uh.
Train is approaching a crossing,
it sounds, it's.
Its bell or it's warning signal,
um, ED rods, which is a quarter
mile.
Out
And we're just, we're just uh
cut and pasting the definition
of other on track equipment?
And inserting it over here as
well.
So that same
Signal requirement also applies
to the on-track equipment.
Which is uh sort of parallel to
the bill that uh Representative
Lundstrom has proposed. OK.
And we have someone has moved,
you've moved that for
consideration, right?
All right, um, representative
Lundstrom, is this a friendly
amendment or it is not a
friendly. Um, obviously you have
the opportunity to explain why,
so feel free. I could, um, uh,
Madam Chair, I believe we have.
I in
Above my head
The expert, get to the bottom of
some of this and why it would
not be um.
I could
A good job.
feel, I mean, at the committee
stuff is uh may I ask if Jeff?
Join us from the East the
national legislative director.
From BMWED
um yes and we see him online and
we can.
It can be helpful if he could
say a few things. Absolutely.
So, um, Mr. Jones.
Um, you're, you're, you're on
Zoom and you certainly may join
us and share your thoughts on
this proposal. This is the
Thank you. Um, anything you'd
like to add, representative?
No, no, I'm madam chair.
So it remind everyone we're on
the proposed sub.
Questions about the sub.
Um, yes, Representative Romero,
um, Madam, uh.
I guess the question is actually
Um
When we're looking at that we're
doing is that consistent with
other train.
Or is this just imposing?
Or
Me cherubs and Romero, so it is,
it's amending another statute.
Of New Mexico law that deals
with trains.
That requires the the horn to be
sounded um by a locomotive.
A quarter mile up.
And it's applying that same
requirement to
The other on track equipment.
Which is the subject of
Represents Lustromsville. So
these are other
A large, heavy machinery.
Train
Things
rolling down the tracks and the
ideas that the same sound your
horn.
Requirement applies to both.
And her, um, representative.
Presentative McQueen, um, but we
were hearing from the testimony.
Um, objects they're moving at a
very, very slow pace came about
with maybe commuter trains.
And therefore the standard of
having to toot the horn, which.
So glad to be saying that today.
Um.
It's uh
I don't know. I don't know corn.
For the bingo it's Friday. I
don't know what's happening, um,
thank you, Madam Chair, um.
Tooth the horn is different
time um that is necessary for
other types of of trains is
that, is that what I'm hearing,
or representative.
Um, ma'am.
Sure, go ahead. Madam Chair, uh,
representative, the
The statute that we would be
amending doesn't specify.
The, uh, speed of the trains,
uh, you know, the trains,
commuter trains, rail runner,
you slow down, uh, when they get
into town, uh, so it is there
are different speeds at uh.
I think they get slower as uh
the experts said when they get
closer to the crossings, um,
The
Our understanding about the this
equipment was that was moving,
uh, perhaps 1 mile an hour.
But what I'm hearing now is
maybe they're moving 1 mile an
hour when they're right upon the
crossing.
But faster than that, 10 miles
an hour.
Um, elsewhere, so.
You know, the, the speeds can
vary is my understanding.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um, but
if I'm also hearing what
representatives, um.
Expert is saying is that that's
inconsistent with other
interstate comm commercial
standards about.
Um, slower pace of the.
Trained by
in training.
Um, is that what I'm hearing
from you, Madam Chair, Madam
Chair, that's what I understood
my expert just to say.
Um, so I, that all that taken in
Maur would be uncomfortable with
the.
Um, changes made.
Understanding that other state
standards, you would want to
like interstate commerce and
some of the other.
Representative. Thank you, Madam
Chair, and just to, um, piggy
back further on.
Um, Representative Romero's
comments, so just to make sure I
am.
Distilling this correctly in my
mind, it looks like we're in a
position where we either.
Look to standardize New Mexico
law.
Further clarified in Mexico law
as applicable.
To this area or we are either
we're doing that or we're
disrupting national
standardization of like.
Practice.
So is that fair to say, I guess
I'm also asking this question to
representative to Char McQueen,
is that fair, Mr. Chairman, like
where that's the question we're
facing, this is the choice we
have to make.
Maner represents Amy Hill, uh.
It's not clear to me that our
existing law, this section on,
on page 1 and 2 of the committee
sub.
Uh section 63-3-34.
is consistent in other states.
This appears to be New Mexico
law, Section B specifically
applies to trains owned by the
state.
I would guess that uh there are
states that don't own their own
train.
So we already have New Mexico
specific standards.
This would be including this
other requirement in our
existing New Mexico specific
scene.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. I will continue to
listen.
Is there any Madam Chair and.
Tara McQueen and Representative
Lendstrom. I have a question for
the expert actually, which is
what.
What is, what does federal law
require for this.
Uh, on track equipment.
Um, in terms of the warning
signal.
If the expert might uh be
allowed to answer Madam Chair.
Uh, yes, it does. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Anyone else remember on the sub,
whether a top to adopt the sub
to accept a motion on the so.
the table.
So a motion to table, is there a
second? or I guess I don't need
a second.
Um, let's call the roll.
Representative Abeta.
For clarification we're on the
motion to table,
which we've just been
discussing.

Leader Sapansky, yes.
Madam Vice Chair.
Madam Chair, yes.
Madam Chair, you have 10 yeses
and 1 no for I do pass on House
Bill 160. Thank you, thank you
very much, uh, Madam Chair and
committee and I wanna thank uh
Representative McQueen for a
good discussion we had earlier,
so I had a better understanding
what he was trying to do, but
thank you all very much. Great.
Thank you.
OK, next, next on our agenda is.
HJR1, um, Representative
McQueen.
It is McQueen Day today, yes.
I love Mc. Oh yeah, and it's
because it's Valentine's Day. It
seemed like an appropriate fit,
Madam, he's not wearing his,
he's not wearing his pink.
Where's the pink or the hearts
or something.
And, uh, when I walked into our
caucus, I was confused why
there's so many people were
wearing pink.
It just took me a minute to get
a chair.
Madam Trey, I hope the gentlemen
to send some flowers to his
wife. Yeah, right, yeah.
Are you ready? Yes, we're ready
and we're done teasing you for
about a nanosecond,
OK, um.
Uh, I was going to say that it's
a Groundhog Day in the House
Judiciary Committee because we
have done this bill, I think for
at least the past 3 years, um.
It has passed, it passed last
year and went to the House
floor. The reason it's sort of
not Groundhog Day is because we
have several new members on this
committee, and some, some
members who are new to the
committee and some members who
are new to the legislature. So
I, I will sort of go over and
explain uh the bill. Um, there
is an amendment.
Uh, to the bill it's actually
not a bill to joint resolution,
but
Um, and the amendment, uh, does
two things.
Um, Madam Chair, uh, should we
move the amendment for
discussion?
The
To to number on amendment is
230267.2 and the amendment does
two things, one of which, uh, I
think they're both significant.
Uh one is more substantive than
the other.
Uh, the first is it changes the
title of the bill.
To something that is more
understandable.
Because as a joint resolution,
it's constitutional amendment.
It goes on the ballot.
And it's the title of the bill
that goes on the ballot.
And so we reworded it to make it
clear what the actual
constitutional amendment would
do.
Uh, and then the second change.
Uh, which is on page 1 line 23
would adjust the start date of
the session from the 3rd Tuesday
to the 2nd Tuesday.
The reason for this is because.
Um
If we change our current 30 day
session I'll get to the merits
of that to a 45 day session.
In, in that year, you're getting
close to filing day.
So members um have to collect
signatures, have to be prepared
to run for re-election. And if
we left it as at the uh as it
currently says as the 3rd
Tuesday, then you would only
have a couple of days between
the end of the session and
filing day for the next term,
and that's a bigger deal here in
the house because we're running
every 2 years. So those are the
two changes in the amendment.
Should I go ahead and explain
the joint resolution manager.
OK, so, um, as you all know, in
New Mexico we are, we are a
citizen legislature, and we meet
every year, 60 days for one
session and 30 days for the
next, and
There have been a variety of
proposals over the years, um, to
change that.
And frankly, the 60/30 is a
change. Uh, we used to only meet
every other year. At one point,
I believe we only met for 30
days every other year. So this
has evolved over time.
There are many of our colleagues
that would like to change it
from 6030 to 6060.
Uh, I personally would support
that.
I think that's a good idea. I
think 9090 is a good idea, um.
But
You know
With the reality of our current
situation where we're, we are a
volunteer legislature, you know,
we have 112 members that have
been elected in their existing
rules.
Changing to 6060 or or something
beyond that.
It hasn't seemed feasible, so
there have been proposals they
have not passed.
The benefit of 45, 45.
is it doesn't actually increase
the time that we're here. So for
those of us who have
Jobs, families, other
commitments, it, it doesn't
increase the amount of time
we're in session, it just levels
them off. So it takes 15 days
from the 60 to 30, you get 45,
45.
The second thing the bill does,
which is incredibly important
for us as legislators.
As it gets rid of the
germaneness requirement.
Or the second term of uh
legislative biennium.
And
I'm, I'm in my 11th year in the
legislature.
Uh, so I have been through 530
day sessions.
Uh, in order to work on
legislation, it has to be budget
related, it can be a
constitutional amendment or you
can get a message from the
governor.
In 5 tries, I have 0 messages
from two different governors.
So what happens for for me is I
work really hard on bill.
Maybe it doesn't get quite
across the finish line, and then
I'm done.
For 2 years.
I have to run for re-election. I
come back to a new legislature
we have 10 to 14 new members. I
start from, from.
Scratch starts from square one.
And it's just really hard and I
think we have issues that we
should be working on.
Year after year until they're
fixed, until we get them right,
and this interruption for, you
know, the end of a 60 day
session.
To the start of the next 68
session is effectively two full
years.
And so we, you know,
There is no flow, there's no no
momentum, you lose your
coalition.
And that this bill fixes that.
And just levels everything out,
the 45, 45 where everything is
germane.
with that. I'm happy to answer
questions.
Hey, let's go to the audience.
Those wishing to speak in
opposition, the House Joint
Memorial resolution one, please
approach the gentleman with the
microphone.
Don't see anyone
Anyone online wishing to speak
in opposition.
To house joint resolution one.
Please raise your hand.
I don't see anyone with a hand
raised. Anyone in the audience
wishing to speak in support of
House Joint Resolution One,
please approach the gentleman.
With
My phone.
Um
Anyone online wishing to speak
in support of the joint
resolution, please raise your
hand.
OK, I see, um.
veterans and military families.
Hello?
Veterans in, yes.
Thank you. Um, anyone else
online wishing to speak and
support?
I don't see anyone with a hand
raised.
Representative of anything else
before I go to committee?
Madam Chair, I, I, I appreciate,
uh
Mr. Eisner's comments about the
balance of power. I mean, this
to me is empowering the
legislature.
Thank you.
All right, um
Representative Romero.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um.
Thanks again for bringing this.
Um, I'm in support, the only
part of it that um I'm trying to
get clarity on, and I think in
the process that we have.
currently, which is partially
um.
In the sense of when you're
talking about bills that
All right
quite ready for prime time. They
need a lot of work, maybe
they're being rushed or pushed
through without support, um, or
perhaps there's a, you know,
strategy there about some bills
that aren't ready for prime time
but should also not.
At a hearing, they're just, you
know, they're bad bills, we'll
say.
Um,
That said, Madam Chair.
Uh, Representative picking up
that.
Bill and continuing to run with
it, if it's still not ready, if
it's still requiring the time
and effort to do that, and it
hasn't been.
Uh, reviewed in the interim and
it hasn't had the sort of.
Time taken that we hope will
happen, but
Somehow doesn't still gets the
reward of being in the process
where it gets taken through year
to year.
So my concern there, um, Madam
Chair, representative is that
currently we start over for the
reason that you got a clean
slate, no one gets the benefit
of.
Um, moving it from one committee
to the next, including new
members, right? They can't even
prefile.
Um, when they come into the
legislature, um, so.
armchair, uh, Representative
McQueen.
Why is that sort of proposal,
um, a better system than we
currently have in my mind.
Which I think is is working.
Um
Then chair representative
Romero.
Let me clarify because I think
what you're talking about is
something that's not in this
proposal. And that is we're,
we're in the first session, we
are two pills.
We got to get across the finish
line. If they don't, we come
back in the 2nd session. You
gotta introduce him again.
They don't, we're not, I'm not
talking about.
Sort of keeping their position
like if it's on the house floor,
it doesn't start on the house
floor in.
the 2nd session, so still goes
back and has to be reintroduced
if we want to change that,
that's, that's a different
topic.
Um, so it's, you still
reintroduce them every year, but
the benefits are, see, I think
there's 31 is you have the
opportunity.
They do it in the 2nd session
without getting a message.
The second is your coalition and
your colleagues are more likely
to be the same.
Then they would be with a long
layoff.
And the third is, which I
didn't, I didn't mention in my
opening.
You know, all my frustrations
with the 60-30 system is
In the interim before the 6 day
session.
run for re-election.
You know, I mean, and that's the
interim where I should be
working on bills, get ready,
because that's, that's my,
that's my shot 68 session.
In the interim before the 30 day
session, I'm not running for
reelection. I have more time,
but I don't have the same
opportunity to introduce the
bills.
So like even if like if it was
30, 60 instead of 6030, that
would be better, but
What this is is 45, 45, you
would still have to reintroduce
your bill and have it go through
committees.
Uh, thank you, Madam. Thanks for
that explanation. Now, very
clear, um, that I had a totally
different um methodology in my
head, I really appreciate that.
um.
And yeah, that that convinced me
thank you.
on representative, that was my
exact question, um, I didn't
think your bill did that, but I
was gonna clarify that the bill
wouldn't just roll into the next
session. Representative Hoffman.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative Chair
McQueen for bringing this, um,
bill. I always enjoy the
discussion every time, um, so I
wanna start by saying, you know,
I'm, I am in support of uh
lengthening the session
generally, um, I am in support.
I feel like this would.
Bring, um, some foundational
principles into our legislative
system that we don't have that
would be based on a
professionalization.
Of our process, right, which
we've been.
talking about for a long time,
um.
And I have to say just, you
know, in the abstract, I, I
agree with and I support
lengthening the session,
however, what has always given
me heartburn on this issue is,
um, you know, realistically,
again, we are still an unpaid
for the last unpaid volunteer
legislature in the country and
um what this would do for me,
for instance, is, um, we may
have
45 days to get everything done,
but that means I have only a
year in which I have to.
And socialize and get all of the
work done on every type of bill
and policy issue I'm working on.
In preparation for that session
every year and on top of my
other.
Obligations, you know, as a
professional and also as a
legislate, I think that would
make things really.
Even harder than they already
are unless this would be coupled
with.
Truly professionalizing our
legislature and paying
legislator tours so that we.
don't have to continuously make
the choice between serving our
constituents and putting food on
our tables.
So, um, I, I a lot of New
Mexicans. I don't think know or
understand that we are still
volunteers and the.
Uh
how difficult this can be for
all of us, especially for
working moms or people with, you
know, elderly parents. Um, so I
would love to.
Vote for this, but I would also
love to see it, um, in addition
to uh uh proposal to
professionalize us and to pay us
a stipend or a salary so that we
can discuss all the issues in a
45 day session every year, but
that we also have the time and
ability and prioritization to do
it. So thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, um, Speaker Martinez.
Man, I move to pass on Hauser
resolution One.
OK.
To
Um
here there is an amendment
that I move the motion to adopt
the amendment. OK.
All right. Um, is there any
Opposition to the amendment.
Yes, um, Representative Paul.
I just ask a quick question on
that. Is that OK, ma'am? I think
so.
Representative with with a
changing to the 2nd.
How does that affect us if we
Are we going to take that
following you because I think
the 3rd.
Monday of every January is MLK.
National holiday, I believe, so
would that go ahead and be
observed or would we meet and we
have to pay.
Um
The staff to be here. I'm, I'm.
Curious about that, sir. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Uh, men, uh, representative
Paul, uh,
It does end up by moving the
date forward, we pick up the MLK
holiday, um, I had discussions
with uh Le Skipansky about this
and the
The way it will fall, it might
actually provide a useful break
for staff, and also like I, I
mean, I work all the time. I
think a lot of our staff works
all the time, allow them to sort
of catch up on paperwork and
processing and things like that.
Uh, we do have other holidays
that fall during the uh during
our sessions, uh, so it does, it
does uh factor in.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you. So we're on the
motion to adopt the amendment.
Is there opposition to adopting
the amendment.
I don't see any opposition.
Now we have an amended bill. Do
you have one person on the list.
Oh, OK, it's great. Go ahead,
um, speaker.
Move it do pass and how's your
resolution one as amended.
Will you call the roll?
Representative Abeta, yes.
That's a yes.
Representative Chavez, yes.
Representative Hall.
Yes
Representative Hoffman B. Hill.
Representative Martinez.
Speaker Martinez.
Representative McQueen.
Represented my queen.
No, no kidding,
that was a.
Her representative Reeve, yes.
Peter Sapansky, yes.
Madam Vice Chair, yes.
Madam chair, yes.
Representative McQueen.
Yes.
Martine.
Uh, Madam Chair, you have 10
yeses of one excused with a due
pass for house.
They are one as amended is they
do pass.
Next on the uh
The next on the agenda is House
Bill 256. No statutory bill
intro deadline.
Um, Madam Chair, um.
The
This is a new bill.
And this bill came about because
one of our intrepid analysts.
Figured out that our statutory
uh that we have a bill
introduction deadline.
In statute
Which came as news to me.
And so section 2-6-1 of NMSA.
Um, says no bill shall be
introduced at a regular session
of the legislature subsequent to
the 30th legislative day in
sessions held in odd number of
years or subsequent to the 15th
legislative day.
And Sessions held an even number
of years.
This makes sense with our
current system.
This statute becomes a problem.
If we change our
Our system to 45, 45 because we
still
It was still sort of impact us.
Um
The statute has other problems.
So for example, it talks about
legislative days.
Not to find the statute.
We have days and we have
legislative days, legislative
days where you would roll the
clock.
Um, it's not, as far as I can
tell, it's not to find there are
rules either.
So that's an issue.
Um, we don't, if we have a 45
day session, we don't want a
bill introduction deadline.
Be 15 days into that session.
Um, and then, you know, just
sort of fundamentally.
Why is this in statute?
We have a rule
House rule 11-26.
No bill shall be introduced in
any regular session.
Of the legislature subsequent to
the 30th.
Legislative day
So we have effectively the same
thing in rural. This is
certainly something we can
govern ourselves by rule.
Um, and it, and.
I thought about like how you
could fix the statue.
And then I thought
Why bother fixing it? We don't
need it. Let's just get rid of
this. Um, I would point out just
so um.
Uh
Everyone knows
This is a house rule.
And there doesn't appear to be a
counterpart in the Senate.
So that might be something we
would need to address. Um,
My
Online is my goal here is not to
eliminate a bill introduction
deadline. It's just to bring it
back in-house in our rules where
it belongs.
Thank you, ma'am Chair.
OK. Thank you. Um,
Let's go to the audience, those
wishing to speak in opposition
to this bill.
Please step forward.
Those wishing to speak online
against this bill, please step,
um, raise your hand.
I don't see any hands raised.
Those in the audience wishing to
speak in support, please step
forward.
I don't see anyone.
Go online, wishing to speak and
support, please raise your hand.
I don't see anyone.
OK.
Manerme at one point um.
The FIR.
Has a fiscal impact for this
bill?
There should be none.
Um, the intent is not to
eliminate the deadline.
It's just to put it into rule as
opposed to statute.
So the FIR assumes that we're
gonna keep drafting and dropping
bills throughout the entire
session, and that will take
additional staff time and
expense.
I think that's incorrect.
OK, uh, I have Speaker Martinez.
Thank you, madam chair. Thank
you, Representative, uh, walk me
through this here. Walk me
through the mechanics, so.
Um
House rule.
establishes the bill
introduction deadline.
Correct.
Uh, Man chair Speaker Martinez
is actually both in rural and in
statute and Madam Chair and
Representative, uh, does a rule
in the statute match.
Uh, ma'am, chair, Speaker
Martinez, this, the rural House
Rule 1126 does not have the odd
even, it just says every regular
session.
So they don't match uh neatly.
Yeah.
You mentioned, Madam Chair
Representative, that this could
become a problem, shall the
prior constitutional amendment
be adopted.
Um and I, and I see why that is.
If it's not adopted.
In House Bill 256.
goes through.
What is the
effective impact to that.
Um, Madam Chair.
Uh, Speaker Martinez.
In in one way it's a really good
question.
Because
We, we, we're all, we all know
we have this little introduction
deadline.
Right? It's, it's listed on the
front page of our website.
You know, the deadline as listed
as we observe it is days.
This says legislative days in
both the statute and the rule.
So there's some, some ambiguity
there to begin with.
Um, if the.
The statue was repealed in the
constitutional amendment did not
pass, we would still have our
rule, which says 30 days and
obviously, it says 30
legislative days.
We would want to revisit that.
If we still have the 60-30
system.
So we could set the introduction
deadline before the, the last
day.
Of a 30 day session.
That's a good point, Madam Chair
Representative, and um,
To your earlier point, we govern
our own.
Process
It's um
It's interesting that it's
actually in statute.
With the conflict I wonder what
would happen if somebody were
to.
File a lawsuit
Um,
Because we
Created the statute, and we also
have our own rule. It's not like
somebody else created the
statue.
I guess that's a matter for a
different day.
Um, out of curiosity, uh, just
above there where you strike
proposing to strike the language
legislation shall not be
accepted for filing until the
beginning of the prohibited
period. Of course, we pre-filed
all the time.
Is it the fact that it's quote
unquote pre-filing.
That makes it not really filing
and therefore not breaking.
not violating the statute.
Ma'am, uh, Speaker Martinez, I
believe.
Uh, I could be wrong, but do we
prefile in December? I thought
prefiling didn't start till
January.
If prefiling starts till
January, that's when the now but
it used to be December 15th.
It used to be December 15th. But
that's changed to January 1.
That might be
Right. Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Uh-huh
Representative of Beta.
Thank you, Madam Chair, thank
you, Representative McQueen. My
question is the committee.
see.
Can you provide some context or
history about why it was put
into statute.
No, that's
a question if you weren't here,
but.
No, I'd appreciate it.
Man chair representative beta,
I, I don't know.
Because Bill introduction
deadline certainly sounds to me
like something that should be
governed by our own rules, not
by statute, and
You know
We talked about how we keep
doing this bill. This is the
first time this issue's come up.
So like I think we mostly, most
of us probably didn't know it
was in statute.
You're welcome.
Um
I have representative Ramiro and
then represented Sapansy.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
I just wanted to note that I was
looking up the statue and we've
repealed essentially all of
these different laws governing
um the legislative branch, their
fall under Article 5,
Of legislative fiscal control,
which is interesting, so there's
this whole.
Fiscal, um, statute that.
um
Sort of, um,
Yeah, comes prior to this 2-6-1.
And it's just like a standalone.
Everything around it has been
repealed in governing the
legislature, and it looks like
we did all of that in the 180,
1882 is when we just started.
Taking this out of statute and
putting it into um.
Into our own rules. So I just
wanted to note that um.
If this would be consistent with
pretty much every other rule
that is in statute that has been
repealed.
We haven't
Representative Supansky.
you, madam chair, uh, chair
McQueen, our, um, I did just a
couple comments are intrepid,
um, minority analysts, I
believe, just pointed out uh an
interesting fact, which is.
Um, it actually in the
Constitution Article 4 Section
19.
Says time limitation on the
introduction of bills at any
session of the legislature shall
be established by law.
So Madam Chair represent
everything
um
which is
Um,
so.
Like
Madam Chair Representative, um.
just interesting that this has
been amended in.
1932 and 1960.
So Madam Chair Representative,
you may wish to bring forward a
constitutional.
Amendment to fully address this
issue, um, because previously it
looks like.
Actually, the Constitution.
The day limit within the
Constitution.
Um, so, and then that was
removed. There's a number of
annotations I didn't have a
chance to read, um, and just,
Madam Chair and Representative,
the other thing I would mention
is that, um, in the joint rules,
there is a rule not regarding
introduction of legislation, but
regarding drafting requests to
the Legislative council, um,
Which it seems to me if we let
that joint rule stand, it would
serve as a limitation, actually
on.
Uh, late breaking bill drafting
requests so that it would sort
of be like self limiting, um,
but Madam Chair.
Representative, please, uh,
happy to have you respond and
and sorry to be the bearer of
bad news.
Uh, Mays and Skinsky, you know.
The process is to get it right,
so.
Uh, you know, uh.
What, what I would suggest, uh,
I, I've not looked at, I, I see
in my annotations, there's a
reference to the Constitution.
Um, I don't have my
Laptop with me, um.
Might I suggest we, we roll the
bill and, you know, another
approach rather than repeal that
occurred to me is that we have a
prohibition on introducing a
bill.
Within the last 10 days of a
session.
So count backwards.
And that way
If the sessions change in
length, that last 10 days or
last 15 days or whatever we want
to be would stay consistent.
That would be a different
approach and, and.
But
Potentially comply with the
constitutional requirement that
the bill introductions
established in law, which seems
silly, but, you know, if it's in
the Constitution, I don't want
to run the constitutional
amendment to take it out.
Madam Chair Representative happy
to work with you on that. I
think we'd need an exception for
like general health, safety,
welfare that be a chat.
Yeah.
So I hear a request to roll, it
sounds like an appropriate
request, um, and.
If this can be sorted out, we'll
bring it back, but.
Um, good try.
No, um.
Yeah.
Now we're on HJR 2 eliminate.
Uh, thank you, ma'am chair. Uh,
this is a, another, um,
Constitutional amendment, which
is good for the legislature.
It's also good for the public.
Uh, this is a transparency
proposal, uh, as you know, uh,
after when we send bills up to
the governor, Governor has a
certain period of time to
A sign or veto them if we send
them up before the last 3 days
of the session. If we send that
bills in the last 3 day session,
the governor has, I don't
remember if it's 20 days or 30
days, uh, to act on the bill if
the governor does not act on the
bill, it is vetoed.
And that's what's described as a
pocket veto. So a governor can
veto a bill uh without any veto
message, and what this
constitutional amendment, and
there's, there's amendment to
this one as well.
Uh, with this constitutional
amendment would do is change
that.
Um, the governor must, if the
governor is going to veto a
bill, the governor must provide
a message.
Uh, and we're actually adding a
substantive message as to why
their vetoing a bill in whole or
in part.
But the governor still has the
opportunity to not take action.
In which case the bill simply
becomes law and said not
becoming law, um.
And um.
I, I want to emphasize this
doesn't in any way limit a
governor's ability to veto laws.
All it does is require the
governor to tell us why.
And I've, you know, I've had
bills uh vetoed by both the
governors I've served served
under pocket vetoed.
Um
There was a bill that the the
interim land grant Committee.
Endorsed
That was pocket vetoed 3 times
by 2 different governors.
And we actually sent a letter to
the governor saying, please,
won't you tell us why you won't
sign this bill.
It's just it, I think it's just
good practice that uh that we
should require this.
So, so, ma'am share there are
two amendments again, like with
the last 11 is rewarding at the
suggestion of Lepansky.
The, the title of the bill.
To make it clearer about what
we're doing because this is,
this might be the only thing uh
members of the public read about
this bill before voting on it.
So we reworded it to make it
look clear. And then
The second change would be on
page 2 line 22, adding the word
substantive.
Um, and the the thought there
was we don't want a veto message
that says, I'm vetoing this bill
because I don't like it.
Um, you know, you know,
something dismissive and that
the request is that the veto
message be substantive.
Um
Do I have a motion to adoption.
OK, we have a motion to adopt
the amendment.
Seconded by.
Representative Hochman B. Hill.
Um
Any opposition.
To the
I do not see you have an amended
bill.
You've spoken to the bill, we've
amended the bill, and we go to
the audience first, um, those
wishing to speak.
In opposition to the amended.
Bill
approached the gentleman. See
anyone?
Anyone online wishing to speak
in opposition to the amended
bill, please raise your hand.
Don't see anyone. Those in the
audience wishing to speak in
support of the bill.
Please raise your hand. Yes,
Hannah, um, please come and
approach the gentleman with the
microphone.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I'm Hannah Burling.
Co-president of the League of
Women Voters in New Mexico?
The league stands in strong
support of HJR too.
We have a number of positions
promoting transparency in
government operations, and we
believe that any governor owes
it to the legislature and to the
public.
To explain any detail. We're
grateful to Representative
McQueen for introducing the
joint resolution, and we urge
the committee to give it a due
pass. Thank you.
Thank you. Anyone else in the
audience wishing to support um.
This proposed amendment.
I don't see anyone, anyone
online wishing to speak in
support.
Molly Swank.
Molly Swank
back to the sponsor.
Um, nothing further, madam.
Thank you. Um,
Members um Speaker Martinez.
And when we do pass and how's
your resolution 2 as amended.
Oh, OK. Uh.
Appreciate the motion. I'm glad
we've got a motion, but I, there
are a couple people who wanna
ask some questions, so
representative.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative.
I think it's the word
substantive that I'm, I'm
concerned about and wanna just
talk a little bit about that and
the separation of powers issue,
and I understand we want an
explanation, but.
When you say substantive.
How would that be?
Like, what would you, what would
you believe to be a substantive.
Uh, madam chair, uh.
Uh, I, I, I believe sometimes
that explanation could be
physical, it could be policy
directed, it could be uh
philosophical, like uh
Don't believe uh we should take
this action. I mean, I think
that's a substantive, uh,
rejection, uh, what occurred to
me is
Every governor could, could say
on every bill they veto, I find
this to be contrary to the
public health safety and welfare
of New Mexico, period.
You know,
There's not a lot you can do
about that.
I think if the government, if a
governor did that consistently.
Their argument that that's a
substantive explanation would be
diminished.
Um, you know, we're really,
really looking for is specifics,
policy direction, you know,
maybe you should do this, but
like, you know, uh.
10 days for this time period is
I feel this is too long. You
should shorten it to 5.
You know, anything like that,
uh, that could help us uh
reformulate a policy would be
Uh, useful.
So, Madam Chair and
Representative, so I, and I'm.
I feel kind of unfamiliar with
how the vetoes and stuff work,
but do those get challenged um
often and we're gonna have a
situation where the courts.
You know, telling the governor.
What she can do as far as on
these vetoes if it's not
substantive or that makes sense,
Madam chair,
um, madam chairs and, uh, the
vitas almost never get
challenged.
But they did get challenged
under our last governor.
veto the number of bills uh
during the session and during
the session that the governor is
required to give a veto message.
And the governor, Governor
Martinez vetoed a number of
bills with no message.
Those were challenged.
Um, the governor's office took
the position that they weren't
actually required to give a
message, even though that's what
it says in the Constitution.
And the Supreme Court sided with
the legislature, as I think
something like 12 bills became
law.
Because uh of the failure to
give a message.
OK, and so Madam Chair and I'm
just I'm kind of concerned just
about the balance of, of the
powers and the, you know, who's
determined substantive and and
the courts getting involved and
the governor having her and
having her, you know, executive
powers too and just the whole
balance of it all, um.
But I thank you for those
explanations, but that's just
something I'm thinking about
thinking about.
Anyone else, I'm Representative
Martinez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Just one
quick question.
Um
Madam Chair
Representative McQueen is.
How does this affect the whole
separation of powers.
It seems like we're forcing the
governor's hand.
And then the courts will have to
get involved so all three
branches of government are now
enmeshed in a fight.
You know what happened under
Governor Martinez, but
We passed this law.
I
Does it become a constitutional
question.
Because of the separation of
powers.
Man, uh represent Martinez, um.
You know, of course, our
separation of powers is built on
the concept of checks and
balances.
Um, and the, the three branches
of government working together
and checking and balancing each
other.
Um,
I would note, uh, as, as I
explained to represent Reed,
there's currently a requirement
in our Constitution that a bill
sent up prior to the final 3
days of the session.
Requires a message to be.
Vita
So we're basically just
extending that to any bill.
Um
As far as, you know, if
Appeal got vetoed and someone
felt aggrieved that the
message wasn't substantive.
Um
They could go to court.
Uh, my, I would suspect the
Supreme Court doesn't want to
get involved in that.
Unless it's really clear.
And so the example I cited for
Representative Reed.
Uh, where the governor simply
failed to provide the message
when the message was required.
That was pretty cut and dry.
And the legislature prevailed in
that case.
Um
I don't think the
Uh
The courts want to
Adjudicate
Relative substance.
To this, right? So if, if, um,
The governor said, I vetoing
this bill because I think it's a
poor use of taxpayer money.
I, I, I suspect that stands.
Uh
You know, if there's a more
detailed explanation, great, but
That to me is a substantive
explanation.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative McQueen.
Makes a lot of sense.
Um
Just
just in the back of my head, the
question was rolling around.
Does it turn into a
constitutional
Issue.
With you reminding me that it's
already
part of statue.
it makes more sense to me. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you,
Representative.
What else, um, yeah, I, uh in
terms of balance of power, I
think we're the balance of power
really weighs heavily um.
In favor of the executive.
A short sessions, the message,
you know, the, you know, we have
to have a specific message
supporting a bill for one year.
So anything I think that helps
level the playing field in terms
of.
Our structure is a good thing
and so, and I do think it's
important to hold the executive
accountable on.
Why they're taking certain
actions and the like so um.
Unless there's anyone else, um,
we have a motion, um.
Or do pass as amended by Speaker
Martinez. Was there a second?
Second by Representative
Sapansy.
Would you call the roll?
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Abeta, yes.
Representative Chavez, no.
Representative Hall
Pa.
Representative Hockman B. Hill,
yes.
Representative Martinez.
Yes.
Speaker Martinez, yes.
Representative McQueen.
Yes.
Representative Reeb.
Yes.
Peter Sapansky, yes.
Madam Vice Chair,
Yes.
Madam Chair,
Yes
Representative Hall.
Yes.
Madam Chair, you have a due pass
on Count Joyce's resolution 2 as
amended.
Thank you.
I am, I have a bill up next, um,
but members before we leave
tonight, I'd like to talk to you
a little bit about how we do
amendments and subs and so on,
so we can come to consensus, um,
so that hopefully won't take
long.
So, I'm going to hand over the,
gavel to my
Trusted vice chair.
Yeah
Oh yeah, just call me.
OK, we're looking at, um, how
substitute for House Bill 140.
Is this, is this the one that
had already been adopted in a
previous.
Um, Madam Chair, the, the bill
was amended in house energy,
correct? Yes, it was amended
this is house Energy. Do you
want to read the 230 number?
We don't, we don't have an
amendment. What can we just make
sure that we're on the same I'm
sorry we don't have an amendment
being presented today. I
understand that. I just want to
make sure that the version that
we got from House Energy is the
version that.
You want to read out the number.
Um, I don't have it.
OK
The number, Madam Chair is
2304332.2. OK, great.
Of the floor.
Um
Um, Madam Chair and committee.
This bill is intended to
address, I guess you might call
a gap in the law.
our enforcement authority
presently and what got my
attention is we have a POS
problem in the state, um, and I
think many of you are aware of
the tragic situation in the
Clovis area where there's been
PFOS contamination.
Farmers and ranchers and human
beings have been impacted by it
and the state has approached the
Department of Defense who is the
responsible party, and they have
been reluctant to negotiate any
settlement, um, to, to support
the claims that we have and the
rationale that's been used by
the Department of Defense is the
department does have does not
have regular or regulatory
authority over PAS.
So where there are states that
have such regulatory authority
such as Texas, for example, um,
DOD has stepped up and worked
with Texas to resolve the issue,
but where DOD thinks the state
does not have a tool, they
essentially say, um, go pound
sand. We will not be working
with you. And I find it very
frustrating. I'm sure the
secretary finds it very
frustrating, and I'm sure the
communities that have been
negatively infected by these.
um the situations are very
frustrated. I have a POS
situation in my little community
of La Cienega, it's not clear
that it's a military driven one,
but it's an issue, and so I do
think the state needs authority
over this very toxic chemical
and with that all if I could
give a few minutes to the
secretary, um, I'd appreciate
it, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, good to see you,
members of the committee,
appreciate the opportunity to
present this bill to you.
Um
And
Until the US Department of
Defense challenged the laws of
New Mexico.
Uh, there is no confusion about
how hazardous waste and
hazardous constituents were um
regulated federally or in the
state of New Mexico.
Um, as, uh,
Representative Chandler just
explained, uh, that was the.
Which is what precipitated us
bringing this bill, this
legislative session.
Approximately 21 other states
have adopted, excuse me, have
adopted.
A similar law.
And if you know that we're the
only state being sued by the
Department of Defense, and yet
there's 715 uh defense sites
that have PAS in the country,
and yet those 21 other states
are not being sued, we are.
Um, So
Uh, Madam chair,
While the bill is about 20 pages
long.
HB 140 actually has very little.
wording in it. A lot of it is
the existing section of law that
has been um both added to and
strikeouts have been.
Um
Put into that bill as well so
that we can
expand our authority where we
need it to come on equal footing
with other states and not be
tied
uh to what simply the US
Environmental Protection Agency
decides uh states should be tied
to with respect to PAS.
Um
Oh no, Madam Chair, members of
the committee, uh, there's no
fiscal impact with this bill.
This we can accomplish the goals
and implement the bill on our
own, uh, with the funding that
we do have, um, but I would note
the physical impact that has
occurred, uh,
Thus far, um, we're somewhere in
the neighborhood of $12 million
into litigation, both defensive
work and offensive work, uh, I
shouldn't say offensive work,
but um uh defending ourselves as
well as uh filing a complaint
against the Department of
Defense. um, we spend $850,000
to manage Phosla uh toxic cow
carcasses in in pursuit of
trying to help Artco, um, and we
continue to get negative news
now being the
uh state uh.
Or actually we have the highest
record of PFOS in any plants and
animals in as documented in the
world uh around Lake Holeman in
uh Otero County.
Um
So, Madam Chair and members of
the of the committee, I'll just
take one more moment uh to just
sort of give you the
architecture of the bill.
Um
Well, I'll give you one more,
uh, take one more moment to give
you the architecture of the
bill.
Um
We're amending the hazardous
waste Act.
Uh, we add the definition of
hazardous waste constituent.
So if you think of hazardous
waste as being a large quantity
of, of stuff, the constituent is
the ingredient within it.
Um
The hazardous waste definition
already excludes a number of
things in the state of New
Mexico, and I think you'll hear
comments to this from those in
opposition, but it already
excludes uh oil and gas waste
and things like that. Uh, the
hazardous waste constituent is
really where we're gaining some
authorities so that we can
regulate the POS that's in the
groundwater in the land, etc.
Um, we would do that by
rulemaking through the
environmental improvement board.
It's not a unilateral decision
by the cabinet secretary or the
Environment Department. We would
continue to work through a
public rulemaking process
through the environmental
Improvement Board.
Um
And
Maybe one little point here
because I think we're gonna get
into it to the extent that you
have questions about it.
Uh, it, it's really important to
note that congressionally
exempted wastes.
That include oil and gas or
mining waste or congressionally
exempted or uh regulatory
exempted ways either by Congress
or by EPA.
Um, will remain exempt from
state regulation that that is
not the point we're bringing
this bill. We're not trying to
challenge existing norms other
than the norm that we can't
regulate PFOS in the state of
New Mexico.
Um, so I wanted to make that
point because I know that's been
a point of much discussion, uh,
with stakeholders, but I wanted
to share that with you. So with
that, Madam Chair, um, I'll
return this. I'm sure your
questions will get us deeper
into it, but I'll return this
back to uh Representative
Chandler.
to add at this point, Madam
Chair.
Right, um, we'll go to the
audience. Is there anyone in
opposition to this bill.
Right, we'll do a minute each
and keep it brief and try not to
be um
for a minute.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. I'm Ashley
Wagner, the vice president of
government affairs for the New
Mexico Oil and Gas Association.
We represent over 180 member
companies. We support the intent
of this bill, but we're
concerned about the potential
unintended consequences to the
possible powers granted to EIB.
If passed, we'll continue
working with the sponsor and
secretary. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Madam
Chair, Mr. Secretary, Mike
Miller, Permian Basin Petroleum
Association. We too stand in
opposition to this bill. We
certainly understand and
appreciate the intent.
But uh we just feel like the uh
the comments that Miss Wagner
made, uh, we would like to see
some more guarantee that Rickro
will be um not be overruled
somehow by the EIB. Thank you.
Good evening, chair members of
the committee. My name is Alison
Riley, Public Policy director
with the New Mexico Chamber of
Commerce, here to respectfully
oppose this legislation, we feel
the bill goes too far in
expanding our hazardous waste
beyond the federal standards,
and no other state in our region
has taken such an aggressive
approach, and therefore puts us
at a competitive disadvantage,
adding new layers of regulation
will deter investment, increased
compliance costs and create
uncertainty for businesses
looking to operate in New
Mexico, and for those reasons,
we
Good evening, madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Jim Winchester with the
Independent Petroleum
Association of New Mexico. Um,
so lawyers from a lot of our
companies have looked at this,
um, and just to echo the
comments of my colleagues. There
is some concern about the
unintended potential loophole in
this bill as it's written right
now, and I do think we need to
tighten this up before this goes
in front of EIB, um, the bill
has the ability and perhaps not
the intention of the cabinet
secretary here.
But it has the ability to halt
the everyday trucking of oil and
gas byproducts off of well
sites.
Um, and
Again, perhaps not with this.
Cabinet Secretary, but down the
road are concern is that a
future state administration
might use this for that reason.
Uh, of course, that would be
very bad for oil and gas
industry in New Mexico.
Um
So with that, until that
loophole's fixed, we will stand
respectfully opposed. Thanks.
Please raise your hands, um,
we'll give you a minute.
Beverly, you've been muted.
Thank you.
OK, we'll go to the audience. Is
there anyone in favor?
Anyone online.
Go ahead, you have a minute.
Melissa, you've been unmuted.
Yeah, we can hear you. Go ahead
and speak.
Um, that includes public
comment. Um, is there anything
else from sponsor?
Hm
Just briefly, madam chair, there
was a reference to we don't want
the EIB overturning RICRA. Well,
I think we all know a state law
cannot overturn federal law, so
I just wanna put that.
intention to rest, um, some of
the other concerns. I, I.
I've had a hard time getting my
head around how this change
actually raises to the level of
issues that they claim to be
impacted, um, so you know I'm
happy to um answer questions
after that, um, yes, Secretary
Kenny would like to weigh in,
Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, just really
briefly, the
I, I respect and understand the
the the opposition that was
stated and and we've been
working to try to figure out how
do we craft language that
currently acknowledges the
federal exemptions for oil and
gas waste and and ensures that
as uh Mr. Winchester said a
future
administration doesn't make a
run at that. Um, the challenge
we have in crafting language
that says
New Mexico.
Recognizes federal exemptions.
And
And, um,
Therefore
Uh,
if we take the federal exemption
and codify it further into state
law, then the whole purpose of
bringing this
Kind of begins to fall apart
because if the US EPA under the
current administration decides
not only to ignore POS but maybe
then go further and say PAS.
is not a hazardous waste,
similar to the exemption oil and
gas has in this bill falls
apart.
Um, so again, there's a, there's
federal exemptions that have
been living uh
For oil and gas, mining, etc.
Um, we, we.
We want to really make sure that
we craft something that
recognizes those exemptions
exist.
But doesn't create a trapdoor.
Or
When it should the federal
government say PFOS is not a
hazardous waste that we be, we
find ourselves in the same
position we are today where we
can't do anything about it.
All right, we'll go to the
committee.
Thank you, Madam chair, um.
And
Gets me Buster, Madam Chair and
secretary.
So
As you know, I'm in Clovis, and
so this is an interesting topic
for me. I understand what you're
trying to do. I've met with Mr.
Scott and I understand the whole
PFOS issue. I'm trying to get a
little more clarification cuz
I'm, I'm also very supportive of
oil and gas and very supportive
of our agricultural community,
which is what we are there, you
know, along with the Air Force
Base, so.
Just going to page 5 and the
hazardous waste constituent or
hazardous constituent, I'm, I'm
trying to figure out who that
will affect and and I know
you're talking about POS, but.
Could this affect our
agricultural regulations and and
what they have to do, can you
give me some examples of, I know
dairies are using is this gonna
be their their waste, is this
gonna be their nitrates they
use, what, what I'm sure. Yeah,
Madam Chair and Representative,
thank you for your question. I
know this is a, a tough position
as you kind of said, and I, and
I respect that, um.
And, and I
You know, I don't want to come
across overly bureaucratic. I
will say under the federal and
state hazardous waste rolls that
you don't get to this, this
hazardous waste constituent
until you get to hazardous. You
have to go hazardous ways to
hazardous waste constituent and
then to clean up or what we call
corrective action. These are
very well defined things.
Um
Has exempts a number, the
definition of hazardous waste
exempts uh, it, it's above that,
um.
On page 5.
Starts on line 3. This is
current state law, not amended,
not changed.
Uh, drilling fluids, uh,
produced waters, all the EMP
ways.
things with geothermal goes on
as you can read there.
Um
There's a separate exemption for
agriculture, uh, that is in this
existing law as well.
So when we add
A hazardous waste constituent.
Um
Which is the first time that
that this has been challenged in
the history of RICRA as the
Department of Defense suing us.
Um
First time I'm sorry, I don't
mean to speak in acronyms. The
first time that that uh
This, the hazardous waste law.
Federly or state was challenged
in the history of that was when
DOD sued New Mexico.
And they said effectively, um,
That you as a state can't call
something hazardous unless.
EPA has called it hazardous in
its constituents as well.
So
We are, have already have
exemptions for the, some of the
things, if not all of the things
you mentioned from the
definition of hazardous waste,
we adding the hazardous waste
constituent, that's what we want
them to clean those constituents
up like the different species of
PAs that they released.
In the soil, in the water, etc.
And that is
Why we're adding this definition
of hazardous waste constituent
in there.
And it is also in our opinion,
limited not only by the current
state law.
But by the
Architecture of the federal laws
as well.
So Congress has exempted mining
waste, EPA has exempted.
Exploration and production
waste.
Um, so we don't feel like we
could go after those ways we do
feel like these amendments get
us closer, if not point on point
going after the POsways,
it just seems like it's kind of
broad and.
I mean, so I know you've been
working with the oil and gas and
um.
Industry and
And you, you guys have not been
able to do something that would
exempt or I wanna make sure that
uh you're, are you telling me
this will not affect agriculture
like.
Or oil and gas in any way just.
You know, like the loophole that
was being described by the
comments. Yeah, Madam Chair and
representative. I, I think it's
the opposite that this protects
them more. And here's why I say
that I was just in South
Carolina at the multi-district
litigation, which is 450+
lawsuits of which New Mexico is
one of them, and the judge said,
Um
You know, hey, New Mexico.
Bring your cases in state court.
And, and the reason they're
saying that
is because
There's, there's a super fun law
out there known as circle.
And under that Superfund law.
It is very plausible that the
Department of Defense could say
ArtO is responsible for his
cleanup, even though we caused
it, even though he's the passive
receiver.
He is responsible and under
Superfund, they're not wrong.
Whoever touches that waste has a
responsibility or a cost share
component of it.
We think getting
Some of that liability out of
circle and into Rira where we
can be the arbiters of whose
responsible and we can say,
look, they're exempt under our
hazardous waste rules, laws and
rules, and we're gonna use our
targeted laws and rules to hold
the polluter accountable, not
the passive receiver.
So
I understand your concern and I
know this is not an easy Friday
afternoon kind of discussion,
but we, we actually do believe
that.
You know, to Beverly Iya's
comments.
I, I think
Not passing this.
puts more liability because we
leave.
Our farmers vulnerable to a
surplus superfund lawsuit.
Um, by DOD or or somebody else.
And uh Madam vice chair, uh,
Madam Chair, expert, have you
reached out and in, let's say my
area, um, all the dairies, we
have the cheese plant, you know,
it's just it's our livelihood,
um.
Have you reached out and gotten
the input from them about what
they feel about these
regulations, I guess definition
that seems to be more stricter
than the federal guidelines.
Yeah, Madam Chair and
Representative for uh so maybe
directly.
No
Um
However, I feel
That, you know, I have I shared
a 202 number that with them, no.
Have I, do I feel like I could
probably vote in your district,
the amount of time I've spent in
Clovis is probably yes. Um, but
I, I say that, Madam chair,
we've had so many public
meetings, arts stops sat in
front of me at the
multi-district litigation with
his wife in South Carolina last
week. We, we are.
Constantly in contact and I
think.
Uh, many of the folks, residents
and and dairies in Clovis.
Um, who have given us tours of
their property and talked about
the cost they've incurred and
the blood samples we like.
It's not
I just want you to know that we
feel like we've
Been investing in the community.
Even if we haven't showed them
the exact language because they,
they just consistently say help
us.
And Madam Chair and um expert
and yeah, I I understand artsop
situation, obviously it's
horrible and I don't think the
DOD's doing what they need to do
to help him.
I'm just trying to
Balance that situation with
Our agricultural industry and.
And it doesn't sound like
you've.
Really talk to them specifically
about this bill.
Um, and so I, I just have
concerns without getting more
input from uh my community about
this and also the oil and gas
industry, which just seems like
this could, uh.
In unintentional.
A problem for them with the
more, the more restrictions, um,
and again especially the
agriculture, but I'm gonna
listen to the arguments and I
appreciate. I add
one thing,
yeah, briefly, um, it.
You know, I've not heard any of
these concerns coming out of
Texas. Um, again, oil and gas,
ranching, etc. and as a, as a
comparator.
January 2019, we were sued and
have been in a litigation with
really no cleanup occurring off
base, some on base.
18 months after that in July of
2020, um, DOD agreed to clean up
Reese Air Force Base in Texas
under the same authority they
sued us for under RICR, under
the hazardous waste laws.
As of October 2024.
They're not only
The state has agreed that the
state has agreed to the terms of
the cleanup. They're well on
their way. They're testing off
base people's vegetable gardens,
etc.
We don't even have a plan yet
from DOD. So I'm not hearing any
of the concerns you heard from
the opponents here in Texas who
has the same authorities, and
I've not heard it exercised in a
way that was in any way
undermining their authorities.
And vice chair, man chair and um
expert I've.
I, uh, I've heard from some of
the agricultural people and they
they are concerned about this,
um, and what
Bens it could place on them.
And so I have talked to some of
them. I again, I'm very familiar
with the, the DOD is doing not
much on this, and that is an
issue also, so yeah, it's a hard
one for me balancing these these
two.
Two areas and also oil and gas,
but um I appreciate the
discussion. Thank you.
Representative Hall.
Madam Vice Chair, Madam Chair,
Mr. Secretary.
Um
I was
You probably explained this, but
it's a kind of a two-part
question.
You struck
Rickra from this is that based
on?
What other states have done or
is that something we felt was
necessary to strike from the
language.
Uh, in the, in the bill, sir.
Madam Spicer.
Um, Madam Chair and
Uh, Representative Hall.
It was necessary.
And consistent with other states
so that we could.
Address PA.
Given that EPA has not.
And so when we, when we talk
about this.
This is, and just to make sure
I'm clear, apologize.
Pardon me.
What's wrong?
Yeah.
My daughter, I apologize. I
thought it was on vibrate.
I could get up.
Oh,
it's like.
here
At least it's not a ghost.
Uh, we're good with that. Well.
Uh
At least uh representative
McQueen wasn't the only one
embarrassed today, so thank you.
Let me, um.
of where I was.
Rickra
in other states struck so, uh,
Madam Vice Chair.
Mr. Secretary, so this is, is it
safe to say this is common in
oil producing states. You've
mentioned Texas but has like
The Dakotas done it or maybe.
Pennsylvania or anywhere else
where we have uh production.
At the level of the state of New
Mexico has.
Madame Boyer.
Uh, Madam Chair and
Representative Hall at the risk
of alienating the oil and gas,
no one has production like New
Mexico has, um, but, uh, but,
uh,
Texas, Colorado.
Um
looking in for oil and gas
producing states.
are really the ones that are on
my list that have done this as
well.
I won't California.
But yeah, there, uh.
They're really the only ones on
the list. There's other states
that have uh a minor amount of
oil and gas production, but
nothing, nothing that's I would
say in the top 5, top 10.
Thank you
Madam Chair, representative
other than Texas, who's
Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Madam
Chairman and vice chair, that's
all. Thank you.
I think you representative,
Representative Chavez.
I had his exact question. He
took it from me.
Madam Vice Chair,
Madam chair, secretary.
Can you tell me how if this
passes.
How does it affect how you
approach?
going on with Cannon.
Does it change your tactics,
change the plan.
How is it going to affect then
deal with DOD.
Um
Madam Chair and Representative
Martinez, that's a good
question. Um,
Interestingly enough,
Under for Kurtland and the bulk
fuel spill.
There is no
litigation or disagreement that
RICR applies.
So we're already under Ricker
corrective action where there
there's consensus between the
responsible party DOD and the
state of New Mexico that.
Ricker relies without this
language.
Getting approved.
Um, with respect to
Canon and and other PA.
I'll speak to Canon cause that's
the one in question or being
challenged.
Um
With respect to that one.
Uh, upon this legislation being
signed into law.
We would then proceed to the
environmental improvement board.
To have a public rulemaking
where PFOS would be listed as a.
hazardous waste constituent.
And we would then exercise our
authority to either.
Cooperatively put them under a
RICRA permit for cleanup.
Or if there's still challenging
that, and we would have to file.
something to compel them to do
that. My general counsel
Zachogas is here, and he might
have a legal, more of a legal
answer to that high level I was
providing in uh Madam Chair, uh,
Representative, again, my name
is Zach Ogos. I'm the general
counsel at NMED
and just maybe a slightly
different, uh, you know, way of
answering that question, but
what I actually think I'm
noticing and seeing is a
different or a change in
strategy from the Department of
Defense. You know, we've been
working with Kirtland Air Force
Base for a number of years.
Uh, like I said, are like
secretary said, there there
isn't any problems, but we're
seeing this new argument coming
out at the Cannon Air Force Base
that New Mexico doesn't. I
actually see and more concerned
about is a change in shows. So,
you know, we're really trying to
get ahead of that uh and and.
This Madam Chair, this changes.
The strategy that you use.
Or
You're afraid that DOD would
change strategy.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
again, my concern being right
now is that the changing their
strategy with regard to states
oversight of their bases in New
Mexico because of the lack of,
you know, recruit authority we
have. So there my concern is
that they will be seeking to
exploit that, uh, this.
OK.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
I'm sure.
Uh, I, I do have concerns about
how this will affect.
Um
How DOD would.
Look at
New Mexico during the next.
Base realignment.
So there, you know, they're, I'm
trying to balance the two
concerns.
So I'll, I'll uh
Or follow the the debate, this
goes down to the floor.
Those, those are definite
concerns.
gonna be hurting
County
Those are the balances we have
to strike.
Thank you, madam chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. I just have a
question. We, we're talking
about ethos a lot, so why are we
not just addressing P POs
instead of allowing EID to
decide.
Madam Chair and representative,
that's a great question. Um,
There are other uh pollutants
that this will help us uh
address like PCBs.
Uh, which are, you know, toxic
in the sense toxic and then used
typically in
Old, probably pre 1980 something
uh Transformers.
We don't have the authority to
address them because we are, we,
we are.
New Mexico is tied to whatever
the feds decided right now.
And this would give us the
ability.
To look at
Again, or regulate PFOS or PCBs
or any other emerging
contaminant that came into a
community.
That was not already federally.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, thank you. Um.
If there's no other comments, I
just have a question on, um, the
current litigation, which I know
you probably however, I'm just
curious.
When we're talking about the
fact that.
The federal government has not
targeted other states the um.
What happens to anything that's
in play, Should we be adopt
this, I just.
Madam Chair,
It's a great question. We're
charting a little bit of new
territory because there isn't a
model for us to follow here. I
think what we would do is
continue to let the Department
of Defense know that the state
of New Mexico has signed into
law.
Uh, recorder protections that
are
More stringent but not broader
than the federal government.
And we would like them to come
in under a RICRA permit, so we
would offer.
That opportunity to sort of.
the remediation.
From
The backs of New Mexicans, but
into the the the rightful.
On our operator here.
And again, if they were not
willing to do that, then we'd
have to exercise legal
authorities and where we are in
the 10th Circuit litigation,
which is the US versus New
Mexico versus the South Carolina
litigation, New Mexico versus.
US
It depends where we are in those
moments we're going to be in the
10th Circuit briefing this up
and during session, actually
next month, we, we have to go
to.
Denver to again engage in
litigation on their challenge of
our state authority.
So I think
It, it, to me it's a timeline
issue as to where we are.
Should this come into law.
And then we get what's the um
thought about how long that
would take so this doesn't takes
about a year.
Right.
Um, Madam Chair.
We have options to either
perform an emergency rulemaking
or um we could if we see that
that this is moving through the
the legislature, we could begin
the work.
To do a, uh, to do a rulemaking.
I don't,
I don't think it's a year,
um, yeah, where you just curious
if it.
You know, gives us one heads or
tails.
The response. Um, is there a
motion?
Man here move a dupe.
House energy environment and
natural resources Committee
substitute for House Bill 140,
seconded by Representative
Hoffman v. Hill.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Abeta, yes.
Representative Chavez, no.
Representative Hall.
No.
Representative Hochman V. Hill.
Yes.
Representative Martinez.
No.
Speaker Martinez.
Representative McQueen.
Representative Reed.
No, and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Peter Sapansky
Yes.
Madam Vice Chair
Yes.
Madam Chair, yes.
President re to explain her
vote. Thank you, um, Madam Vice
Chair, Madam Chair, and expert,
as you know, this is very
difficult one for me. I knew
this would probably progress and
I'm gonna continue to listen
more, but I'm, I'm trying to
balance my ag community, which
I'm hearing a lot from and
they're concerns, um.
And I, and, and oil and gas, but
more so my a community, um.
And
And I also I'm very sensitive to
Mr. Scott's issues, so, um, I
just wanted to put that out
there. Thank you, madam chair.
Thank you, Representative, um,
on a vote of 7 to 4, you have a
due pass.
Lisa, thank you, Madam Chair.
And with that, we are.
Adjourned
Oh, we have it, sorry. Forgive
me.
Oh, that's the job actually.
That's the job.
Um, actually, we do need to talk
about some logistics.
So
Yeah, I, I had mentioned um.
Before we went to the last bill
that I wanted to talk a little
bit about subs and so on, so.
In the past, this committee, if
I remember correctly how we've
done business is we have per
preferred voting on committee
substitutes as opposed to
amendments. So, and that means
Um, and the reason if I
understand and maybe.
Peter Sapansky, whose mothers
is.
We then send a clean document to
the floor. Uh correct about that
leader.
I was hoping for the speaker to
be here, but I understand, Madam
Chair, so I, I think it depends
on the complexity of the
amendment, so there certainly
have been bills that have.
Come to the floor that may have
been amended in.
Both committees which prompted
the amendments in context
document that a lot of people
refer to on the floor, but
certainly anything that is a
complex amendment.
Thank you
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
it's, it's sort of varies
depending on the circumstance.
Um,
What this committee has tried to
avoid doing was
Having housed you your committee
amendments to a House Judiciary
Committee sub.
So, so that's what we tried to
avoid.
Um, like,
If a bill, my bills today both
had amendments.
You know, I, I
I think they're fine, you know,
to go down like that.
And of course, we don't want to
do committee subs.
And bills that come over from
the other chamber.
Because then they have to go
back.
Or the other chamber and it's
just being probably naive when
you do your own bill and then
you have a substitute.
Um
Kind of like representative
Lundstrom, let's say the
substitute had gotten.
Your amendment or substitute
have gotten passed, so then
basically.
You take over her bill somewhat,
you kind of hijack her bill, or
is it, is it?
Does that make sense?
I know that's kind of a
strategic probably things
sometimes that happens, I'm just
trying to make sure it stays
your bill.
And that would maybe be why you
would not want to do a
substitute. OK. Um, you want to
respond to that, Madam Chair
Representative, I, I don't think
you take over the bill, the bill
does change because it becomes
the judiciary Committee
substitute and the the authors
or the sponsors' names come off
the bill, which seems a little
odd to me, uh, and that only
shows up.
On the face of the bill, like it
doesn't show up on the website
or on the board when you're
debating a bill, so I'm not
really sure why we do that, but
I was just curious, thank you
for answering that. OK. So, um,
what I hear us saying is it
depends on the complexity.
And they're um well like the the
amendments that represent think
we could all follow them, so
we'll go with that.
Just, I'll just try to work with
everyone on a complexity to the
changes and so on. Um, the other
thing is, and I'll re-establish
this, if it's someone else's
amendment, like one of our
members, I am not going to
impose.
Um, is it unfair to the sponsor
to say, well, they brought an
amendment, so we're rolling your
bill, um, it may be after
discussing the amendment, the
the sponsor center, I need to
consider it, that may happen,
but I don't think it's fair to a
sponsor to say, say I have to
account for someone else's
later-ish amendment. It just
doesn't seem fair to me. So
that's established a kind of a
common understanding look like
I'm, you know, changing the
rules as we go. I'm trying to be
as consistent and treat
everybody as fairly as I can.
Representative Hall.
Oh,
well, well, always it's better
to try to always better to try
to work with a sponsor to get
them to amend their bill, not
obligated to amend their bill,
obviously, and I do believe
representative in the sponsor
about it and so you know
everything always try, of
course, to work with the phone.
Um, thanks everybody. It was a
good meeting. We're adjourned.
