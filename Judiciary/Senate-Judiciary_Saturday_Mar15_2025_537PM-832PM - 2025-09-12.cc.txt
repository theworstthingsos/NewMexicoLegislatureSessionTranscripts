Mr. Chairman, uh, Center Bill
146 is just an update to the
interstate compact and
educational opportunities for
military children. It's just two
changes on page 3, line 13,
we're lining out sections and
changing it to chapters 1209 and
1222.
And on page.
My apologies.
Page 7, line 5, we're doing the
same thing, taking out sections
and putting chapters 120 9 and
12:11. Uh, with that, Mr. Chair,
that's all, uh, this bill does.
Thank you.
I don't
Nobody on it, Emily?
No, right, we don't have any
registered support or
opposition, but members of the
committee.
46.
You,
Mr. Chair, I'm sorry, I didn't
catch the changes. Uh, could you
go through that again?
Sure, Mr. Chair, Senator, um
page 3 of the bill, line 13,
we're gonna line out.
sections and include chapters.
And then the next page is page
7.
Line 5, and we'll do the same
thing line out sections and put
in chapters. And so those are
the only changes that we're
doing to this compact.
Thank you.
I, I'd move it too fast.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you community members.
I want to let you know that I
don't expect you to sit here and
hold a place to keep your place,
so you're welcome to join us and
watch us if you if you want to,
but, uh, do you want to be
called from someplace else,
we'll get, we'll find you. It's
entirely up to you, OK? So just
make sure you let everybody
around here know how to find you
and we'll bring you back. Um, I
would expect in your case
probably about an hour. OK.
Uh, Chief Justice.
182.
judicial retirement.
Which Senator Stefaniks.
And I owe toonics, so
I put her through a pretty
grueling committee this morning.
You can take either one of you
want, um, thank you very much,
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, uh, these two bills
actually, the House bills
reflect the Senate bills that
went through your very first
committee of the session, and
with me today, I have Chi Chief
Justice Thompson, the, uh, let's
take a numerical order, 182 as
amended is a judicial retirement
changes and in fact it has
fiscal impact that can be
absorbed by the retirement fund,
and I would turn to my expert
witness to speak about this.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, uh, senator
members of the committee, uh as
the sponsor described you.
This may look familiar. I've
seen this bill before. It's
described in is not changed. Um,
we have
Sir Jacobs here from the LC and
Anna Williams from PERA if you
have any technical questions,
uh, you need addressed,
otherwise I'll stand for
questions.
And
Thank you for considering about.
No reason to go back to any
public in but we've already take
care of this, but we will hear
from the members of the
committee, so questions or
comments? do you wanna do, or we
do 182 and then
All right, so 182.
Anyone on the committee?
motion for DuPass. Anyone else?
Seeing them, we have DuPA in
182. I'll spend 183,
Senators.
183 as amended is uh similar to
the Senate bill. Again, this
deals with magistrate retirement
changes, it reflects exactly
what we presented to you in the
first meeting here and both of
these pills are
So that we can recruit more
mature individuals to the
physicians, people who have had
some experience. And again, I'll
have the Chief Justice weigh in.
Uh chair center members of the
committee, thank you, and
nothing else added is the same
matter you've heard previously,
and I appreciate your
consideration this legislation I
stand for questions.
Anyone, questions?
Uh, Senator Thornton, Mr. Chair,
uh, so, so what, what changed
here in this, in this particular
law regarding the magistrates.
What are you doing that's
changing.
Mr. Chair and uh Senator, we are
um making the retirement plan,
more attractive so that people
do not have to serve.
Correct me if I'm wrong, do not
have to serve as long before
they become eligible.
So that's why I was saying we
could recruit more mature
individuals who wouldn't have to
put in as many years.
changing the age requirement or
anything like that for a
magistrate judge, are you?
Um
chair, Senator, we are not doing
that. We are increasing the
solvency, however, from 67 years
to 25 years, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for that.
Is there any objection to the
DuPass motion? Any further
discussion? Nope. Any
objections? See, you have to pay
3183. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you very much.
Uh, where are you at?
Oh, yes, if you don't mind,
Senator, if you wouldn't mind,
um, you probably need to expect
about 30 minutes to be back
here.
I, um,
All right.
It
And, and
speakers.
Represent Rebo and I'm bringing
her back, so give us a minute.
Welcome.
I was told, were you in the
speaker's chair when you were
called? Really?
Gave up
Presiding over the house for
this?
Well, we're honored.
Hospital 281.
Good evening. Thank you very
much, Mr. Chairman and members
of the committee.
So
Oh, apologize,
I'm my.
Sweet one seeks to remove the
cosmetology licensure
requirements for hair braiders
and opticians.
Wyoming, Hawaii, and New Mexico
are the only 3 states in the
nation.
They require a cosmetology
license to braid hair.
So currently,
New Mexico stylist who only
wants to practice hair braiding
or locking must complete.
1600 hours of training and
skills and techniques that far
exceed the scope of hair
braiding.
At an average cost of $20,000 in
order to attain a license
so hair breeding.
It's more than a simple
hairstyle choice. It's a safe,
non-invasive, chemical-free
practice of generational
tradition and culture.
That can be a pathway
predominantly for women of color
to own their own business and
attain financial freedom.
And with that, I stand for
questions.
person who wishes to speak on
this.
Um, on film, I guess Day.
From a, from a, am I saying that
right?
One more.
That right represent.
Um, yes, I believe there are
Um, a couple of people on Zoom
who wish to make public comment.
We might have two potential
expert witnesses who may also be
on Zoom as well. Yeah, we only
have one registered, which is
Um, a couple of people on Zoom
who wish to make public comment.
We might have two potential
expert witnesses who may also be
on Zoom as well. Yeah, we only
have one registered, which was
that Dali
from yeah, is she present? uh.
I, I'm pronouncing your name
correctly, but Ms. Kong, if I'm
doing that right, you're
recognized for 2 minutes.
Yes, Cervantes, and members of
the
Judiciary Committee.
Can you hear me?
Hello?
Yes, we can hear you. Go ahead.
OK.
I represent a community of black
women who are advocating for HB
281 for her braiders to be
exempted from the breeders and
cosmetology board licensing
requirements. HB 281 is relevant
to blacks, Native Americans, and
immigrant communities. As a
mother of three girls, Braden
was essential to keep their hair
neat. Hair braiding is
culture that is learned from
childhood and passed down from
one generation to another.
Breeders do not have to attend a
cosmetology school to braid
hair.
Cosmetologist who is incredibly
expensive and time consuming,
costing on average more than
$16,500 in our state.
Only 20% of students graduate on
time and take out an average
$9300 in federal student debt.
Breeding is a safe time-tested
natural practice that does not
use any heat or chemicals.
36 states have already exempted
hair braiding from licensure,
creating enormous opportunity
for natural hair stylists, most
of whom are minority or
immigrant women.
The average salary of Ada walk
of a hairbreider working part
time. It's a minimum of $28,000
a year, and this is without
completing cosmetology school
program.
There are over 300 hair breeders
in New Mexico, nearly 22.5
million is generated into the
economy from the hair braiders
and locticians.
Saloons and power and create
safe communities, neighborhoods,
schools, and businesses.
HB 281 will exempt these
breeders from cosmetology
licensing, creating
opportunities for the breeders
to establish their businesses
and contribute gross receipt
taxes to the state of New
Mexico. Please vote yes on HB
281 for New Mexico's natural
hair braiders, making our state
the 37th state to embrace
natural hair. Thank you.
We did not have anyone in
opposition, so we'll go to
members of the committee.
do it.
I was just gonna move to your
pants, but said Thornton.
We'll, we'll hold that, we'll
take the motion that we'll have
a little bit more debate,
Senator Thornton, and we'll come
back to your margin report.
Yeah, Mr. Chair, so, quick
question, so I want to make sure
I understand the intent of the
bill. This will allow hair
braiders to open up and
establish their own business
without having to go through a
license or are they going to be
required to work in a cosmopo
Cos.
hair store or barber store or
whatever that already has the
license and they can work in
there without a lessons
themselves. What's, what's the,
I just wanna make sure I
understand the intent of the
bill. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Senator. So it only
removes the requirement for the
cosmetology license, so they are
still, so they would be able to
braid and do hair locking.
At will, um, if a stylist wished
to work out of the salon, that
would be up to the salon,
whether or not they wanted to
rent them the booth, so it
doesn't affect the business
license that they wanted to,
that they'd have to carry if
they wanted to make this.
They, um, livelihood.
Mr. Chair or senator, sorry.
Uh, thank you, Mr. So just to be
clear, what you're saying is
they can't establish a separate
business themselves.
And, and just do braiding hair,
and that would be perfectly
fine, that's, but, or they can
work in a salon and with the
chair essentially and do it from
there either way.
To establish their business, OK,
that's, that's fine. I just
wanted to make sure I understood
the intent. Thank you very much.
Center my answers. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. Thank you, and
then our new Senator the um,
so essentially what we're doing
is tweaking the hairstylist
definition.
Creating a definition of hair
braiding.
And separating it from the need
for a license. So,
So that's, and that's kind of
tough to do. So I'd ask you guys
to look at section 3.
And then there's also, uh, Mr.
Chairman Representative, there's
also uh eyebrow threading
services that are kind of thrown
into the non-licensed.
group
But on the bottom of page 4,
section 3, it says license
required.
And then on a
Page 7, section 5, it says
exemptions to that license.
But yet the hair braiding.
is thrown into the license
required section to do think
about that or consider.
Changing it or, or do you think
that that's, that that's fine.
Um, Mr. Chairman Senator, so
looking at
Lessons required. Can you
Point out for me.
Were breeding is mentioned under
that particular section, just so
I don't have to. Thank you so
much Mr.
Chairman on Section 3, bottom of
page 4, license required.
Uh
And it says no person shall
practice under this no, no
person shall practice.
Barbering hair styling or
cosmetology.
Uh, uh, and then, of course, B
is unless
Uh, they're in a school and then
see is unless they're teaching
and then D is unless.
Uh, and then you got E, and it
says a person who engages in
eyebrow threading or hair
braiding shall not be required
to have a license issued by the
board, so it's just kind of
thrown into the license section.
But it's not in the exemption
section. So I'm just
Asking you is
Um, so instead of putting it on,
on E or F in the exemption
section, like these, these
trades or these actions are
exempted from the act, you kind
of threw it into the
Into the license paragraph, any
reason for that, or do you see a
problem with that, Mr. Chair,
Mr. Vice Chair, that was just
where the uh little drafter.
thought it should fit best.
OK.
Like
can we not just eliminate that
subsection E? Don't we already
cover that in
Section 2
Page 4, 2014 and 15.
Is that how you take care of it?
Well, I guess maybe not cause we
got.
I rare.
Mm
All right. Maybe I persuaded
him.
to stay where it's out. I, I
kind of kind of agree with
Senator Maestas is it's very
awkward.
To
Section 3
As a series of activities that
do not require a license, right?
Exemptions.
But
OK, well it's less than artful.
I'm OK. Anyone else?
You're like me, nope.
Senator Pope, you want to close
it out?
I'm good, Mr. Chair. I'm just,
you know, sitting in another
hair bill. I'm good for a hair
bill.
I don't know, I typed out
threading, not for you.
I'm good there. I might need it,
but I'm good for now.
Uh, we're on a DuPass motion
center do made earlier is there
the objection.
not at all, you have a do pass.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you committee members.
So, I sent you away prematurely.
We move pretty quickly through
some things that I thought might
take more time.
We were being nice to lawyers a
little while ago. We're not used
to that sometimes in the Senate.
But you as a lawyer.
OK
Are you, are you the only
Republican lawyer? Um, yes, sir.
In either chamber, huh?
Welcome. House Bill 101. Thank
you.
Are you ready, Mr. Jack? Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, House
Bill 101, um, basically goes
back to the bill that was passed
last year, I believe it was
actually Senator Worvill dealing
with polling places and uh
certified officers being allowed
to carry firearms in polling
places, and I do have my sheriff
who is on Zoom, if we have any
additional questions under the
name Michael Brockett, but what
we've noticed what's happening,
at least in my counties and
smaller counties.
is that polling places are
connected to um law enforcement
facilities, um, and when we have
a commissioned officer versus
certified officer, you can be
commissioned up to a year, which
gives you the powers to arrest,
carry a firearm, all the
different things, uh, Mr. Chair,
that, um, commissioned officers
can do before they get their
certification. And so the
problem that we're having is we,
we have these polling places
within 100 ft of training
facilities in our building.
means, uh, ballot boxes where
they're picking up ballots, um,
actually, they could not respond
into a polling place incident at
a worker was threatened, um, and
lots of different situations
that are happening like that in
my districts because of the
small, that's the small areas in
law enforcement that are just
connected to the polling places,
so this bill basically tries to
exempt commissioned officers as
it does certified officers so
that they can enter into these
polling places, respond to
Um, crimes that are occurring
and not be subject to the
penalty that's in this bill. So,
um, I don't think that my expert
would probably have anything
else to add, so with that, I
would stand for questions, Mr.
Chair.
Nobody in our position, so we'll
go to members of the committee
for questions. Ready?
they do it?
Mr.
Chair, so
I guess it just doesn't make
sense to me that that 3 and 4
are, are separate.
Uh, that's why I went 3 just say
in performance of their duties
and in accordance with their
policies. Is there a reason for
that? Yes, Mister Chair, and,
um, Senator, it's how they laid
it out with the certified
officers as you can see in 1 and
2 above, so they just duplicated
what was put in the language
above for commissioned officers,
uh, Mr. Charity, so.
That, yeah, sure, yeah.
Uh, I don't know why we did that
in the first place.
thinks that Senator
that allen mysters.
Thank, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We're gonna read the um the
commission after a great
distinction, uh, the commission
officer is working with the
police force has full authority.
They haven't got their
certification from the
certification board, um, so
they're in their first, you
know, 4 to 6 months on the job.
Why do we have to say what the
power to arrest? Why can't we
just say a commission law
enforcement.
Um, Mr. Chair and um senator, I
don't know if it necessarily
really matters, I guess if you
say it that way, um, because the
commissioned officer does have
the power, they do have the
power to arrest and, and one of
the issues we're having is that
if they do respond to a polling
place with their um training
officer, which is generally who
they're with, they would have to
go drop their training officer
off, um, before they could
actually go into the polling
place, if they were responding
at the certified officer was
responding to a threat at a
polling place, and so
Part of it is we want the
commissioned officers to learn,
um, on the job, but they would
be violating the law, so, um, I
don't know if we necessarily
have to have that in there. I
think we just kind of duplicated
the language, but I mean that's,
that's not really an issue, uh,
Mr. Chair and Senator, because
the commission officer does have
the power to arrest. They, they
can be on the streets.
It just kind of reads weird
term, um.
You know the house is super,
super efficient.
With consent calendars, um
Oh what did I say?
Yeah
Like
Yeah
Oh, OK. You're right, you're
right. There's they're tip top
with concurrence calendars, um.
Yeah, sure. I, I'm gonna make a
motion, Mr. Chairman, uh, ribs
and on uh.
Page 2, 20 strike with the power
to arrest.
And I'm
Page 2, line 23, strike with the
power to arrest.
Uh, Mr. Chair and um Senator,
that's, that's a friendly
amendment. Um, I do believe that
commissioned officers do have
the power to arrest so if if
that's makes, um, you feel
better about it and I'm happy
with that, Mr. Chair.
Others, anyone else?
Any objection to the option of
sponsor says it's
Constructive
No sorry no just,
just one question. Let's
Just to make sure, are there
commissioned law enforcement.
Officers without the power to
arrest.
Well, Mr. Chair, um, Senator,
that's actually a good question.
There could be probably a, um,
maybe, I don't know if they're
detention officers or transport
officers or anything that could
be in the facility.
I, yes, that's actually a very
good point.
Yeah, I just, I think we need to
have that in there or we're
gonna have
We're going to open this up in a
way that wasn't what was
envisioned. Thank you. That was
a reason for that for some
reason. I don't know what the
reason is, but I'll go ahead and
draw. OK, thank you. Thank you.
Anyone else?
Right, um, we're on DuPass
motion. Do we have a Du pass
motion yet? No, we need to do
fast motion anyway. I'll make a
motion for a due pass right. And
before we take a vote on that,
so and reap, I need to stand
corrected. There is a segment
Republican attorney in the
House. Yes. Um, it's
Yeah hold on.
In the house side?
Catherine Brown is an attorney.
I believe.
She is. She just doesn't want to
sit on judiciary at night,
that's why I was stuck not
making that connection. Well,
while you're mentioning sitting
on judiciary, you've, you've
been a pretty active participant
with our interim committee CCJ
for some time. Uh, do you find
that committee to be at times
partisan?
I, I'll just say I really
enjoyed the committee, um, Mr.
Chair, I, I love sitting on it.
I love when you chair it and
when, uh, madam, uh, Chandler
chairs it also. I'm learning a
lot, but I think it's a great
committee. I'd like we talked
about both sides of I love
hearing the views from both
sides, so, um, I'll leave it at
that. Could you see
circumstances where the
committee might benefit from
having subpoena authority.
Mr. Chair, no comment.
Yeah, rethinking the vote here
We're on a do pass motion. Is
there any objection? There's
none. You have a do pass
represent. Thank you, Mr. Chair
members.
Senator Deick House Bill 12.
Thank you.
So doing, I know you're standing
in. We have
registered to 45. It's like 7
individuals. I'm not sure
whether they're part of a
coordinated presentation. Do you
know? I realize you're, you're
standing in, but
And Mr. Chair, uh yes, I believe
I have an email here that lists
who are coordinated folks are,
uh, uh, we have, we have 5
people as part of our
coordinated support.
It's Miranda Viscali, Mason
Blinstrup, John Allen, uh, Jerry
Hores.
And Carolyn.
Hi.
Hi, Anna.
When? Carolyn when?
Uh, Mason Blendstrom. OK, so
we've got 5 individuals, I'll
recognize you for up to 12
minutes, uh, Senator, leaving
you 3 minutes for rebuttal. Uh,
that's acceptable to you, and
I'll let you.
I go to 12 minutes with the,
with those uh 5 individuals, if
you would please, and I'll leave
it as you know to kind of
control their presentation, so
we wouldn't that, all right.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I
believe that uh Representative
Garrett is going to come join us
as well.
Mr. Tay, as you know, uh, a
couple of years ago, this body
adopted, uh, the extreme risk.
Firearm Protection Order Act,
and at that time, we may, or you
all may, uh, made law
enforcement officers a critical
part of that process. So, as
happens with um I think
everything would pass up here.
We've had a couple of years now
to see how it's working, um, and
now we have some data upon which
we can, uh, continue to refine
this act that we've already
adopted, uh, to make sure that
it is, it is working the way.
this body attended.
And so
To that end, what this bill
would do would be really two
main things. One, it would make
clear because right now there is
a, there's a disagreement
amongst courts in New Mexico
about whether law enforcement
can be a reporting party or not.
So it would clarify that kind of
split in opinion, uh across
districts, um, and it would also
say that when one of these
orders of protection are issued,
um, any firearms that the
individual had would be really
van qui sh ed immediately rather
than 48 hours later, because Mr.
Chair, the only reason one of
these, uh, orders would be
issued in the first place would
be because there is an a risk of
imminent.
Harm to the person or another,
Um, and so we say there's an
imminent harm here. So let's
wait 2 days.
To, to address it. It, it
doesn't make sense. In fact, it,
it, I think it creates a more
dangerous situation, uh, to
someone who, who might be going
through a crisis and might not
be thinking clearly.
So, Mister Chair, with that, uh,
I have here with me today, uh,
Chief Hebby.
From uh Farmington police uh
department.
Another gentleman who I whose
name I can't remember. I
apologize, but.
I'm Matt. I'm a sergeant with
the Albuquerque Police
Department.
And of course, Representative
Garrett, uh, and
Senator Burks.
Representative Garrett, I don't
know if you wanted to add
anything. I was just give a very
brief overview and like we're
gonna go to comments and
support. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for hearing this
today. I won't add anything more
except to mention this is about
the amendments, not the actual
bill. Thank you.
With that Mr. Chair, I think we
can go to our organized support,
um, so anyone who is here in the
room, Miranda Viscoli, Mason
Blinnstrub drama, if you folks
were just lying up behind me,
John Allen, Jerry Hagra, and
Carolyn Wynn.
And some, some might be on Zoom.
But if you could each uh go
ahead for for about 2 minutes.
It
chair and senators, I'm
Detective Blender with the
rearrange of Police Crisis
intervention team, our
department fully supports the
changes to this legislation.
We've also you see current
statute for several years now
with great efficacy and safety
to the community, so we
appreciate your support and the
changes to this legislation.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, I'm here on behalf of
Deputy Chief Carolyn Wynn. I'm
Lieutenant Janice Madrid the
State Police, and we are to here
in support for the changes to
this bill.
Chair members of the committee,
my name's Miranda Vascoli. We
stand in strong support. I'm
sorry, I'm with New Mexicans to
prevent gun violence. We stand
in strong support of this
legislation.
And Mr. uh, Sheriff Allen and
Chi uh Horuffy are on Zoom.
At first sure following?
OK.
Hello, hello. Um, thank you so
much. Thank you, Mr. Chair and
committee. Burley County
Sheriff's Office along with
Albuquerque Police Department,
domestico law enforcement,
Mexico State Police are in full
support of all the changes and
amendments to this bill. Thank
you so much.
Thank you, you, you had to, you
can help with pronunciation. We
also have the
She she progressed in fire, uh
police department. Chief, if
you're on, go ahead.
We have yeah.
Apparently we can't get right.
How about Carolyn?
For wind, he said.
Carolyn Wynn, I, I believe we
just had someone speak, speak
in, in, in her place. Her
lieutenant spoke in her place.
Is there anybody you're missing
as part of your presentation.
We've been through it, right?
No, right, there were 2 other
individuals who registered in
support given the time your
efficiency with the presentation
so far we can take another
minute for hand Maxwell and
Elaine Miller, who were both on
Zoom preps so.
OK. Uh, Wayne Miller, this is
Joseph Cervantes. We recognize
you for one minute.
Thank you, madam,
and uh so, my name is Elaine
Miller, and I am a psychiatric
nurse. I support the change from
relinquishment within 48 hours
to immediate relinquishment on
surface of the order. New Mexico
law is an outlier in this regard
of the 19 states with red flag
laws, only 4 do not require
immediate relinquishment. We
require relinquishment within 24
hours. Only New Mexico.
last 48 hours. Updating this law
may encourage more petition
requests and thereby save more
lives. I ask that you support
this bill.
Miller, do we have Ann Maxwell?
Oh.
All right, thank you for
recognizing such, we've
completed all the presentation
and support, uh, we have only
one in opposition.
baby,
you hear?
Right, I was gonna say
that's why I'm looking at,
that's what I'm,
that's what I'm looking at he
said, are you here? because
I mean one of those lawyers
we're talking
yeah, I've got you on the
opponents, but I was, I was
trying to figure out how you're
going to do that. So, you know,
some people will do anything to
speak twice around here, so, um,
that would mean we don't have
anybody signed up in opposition,
so we can then go to members of
the committee.
Senator Bretton and Senator
Thornton.
And thank you guys for your
participation.
Um, I will go ahead and start
with
Uh, the bottom of page 2.
so we can. Looks like it's
listed several times throughout
the bill, but on page 2, line
25, the first time I see
credible.
Information. What is the
definition of
Incredible information.
Mr. Chair and Representatives or
senators, I apologize. The
credible information that we're
trained in law enforcement
academy is information that we
can bring forward to court. So
there's not an actual definition
that's in this law or in our
training, but it's any material
that would
be presentable to court for any
law that we.
Bring forward.
So, Mr. Chairman, um, experts
and senator, how would that
definition, if there isn't a
definition, meet a threshold of
probable cause
than not, so I mean it'd be the
same thing. It, it's not.
You could have a video of
someone making threats with a
firearm, you could have photos
of it. You can have direct
interviews. It's vast for what's
credible information.
Mr. Chairman and senators, would
you consider
Adding that language in here to
define it. I know in many bills
we've actually added language
that said more probable than
not.
Mr. Chair, Senator, I don't
think it's necessary. I think
this is an established standard
that law enforcement already
operates under.
Um, so I, I don't think it would
be necessary to
to
Include that definition in this
spell. OK, Mr. Chairman, then,
then Senator, is credible
information defined or used
throughout other statues that
are that govern law enforcement.
And Mr. Chair, Senator, I, I
think based on, on what our
experts said here, I don't think
it is, it is a a statutorily
defined term, I think it is a
standard that is a standard in
that you all are trained on, uh,
that they, they operate under,
but they sure know better than I
do, so I will defer to them.
Mr. Chair, Senator, um, you
know, I think credible
information is going to be
determined by the court.
The officers just like they are
right now, uh, the officers are
going to gather up information,
uh, in, in this case where the
bill is, is a citizen would go
forward and the court's going to
make a determination whether
they have credible information
that there is a crisis and that
there is an immediate need um to
take that firearm. In the case
of a law enforcement officer
substituting for it, it's gonna
be basically the same thing. The
court will make the decision
whether or not the information
we have is credible.
And, and it's gonna be exactly
um like this gentleman was just
saying, it's going to be the
same thing we would do on a, on
a criminal investigation. We're
gonna arrive out there. The
family's gonna tell us if he's
suicidal or he's making threats,
they're gonna tell us why they
think that, you know, what are
the things that are indicating
that we're gonna look for other
evidence in conjunction with
that. Maybe he has diary
entries, maybe he's got some
notes that he's made that
somebody's seen. Maybe he's
making statements to friends.
You'll be the sort of, it'll
change every.
time we go just like a criminal
investigation, but then we'll
take the information we find if
we believe that there's enough,
then we're gonna petition the
court and there's, there's the
good oversight is, is then a
judge is gonna hear what law
enforcement gathers, and they're
going to make a decision whether
or not it's credible enough and
and requires the immediate
seizure of the weapon.
OK, Mr. Chairman, and, and
officer just to make sure that
I'm following you.
An officer can file a petition
based on credible information,
determined by a court, that you
said, that would be defined by a
court.
Before any seizures can be made.
Could you just clarify that?
Yes, ma'am. So that's, that's
what we're doing right, right
now is we will take it to the
court, petition the court that
we wanted to seize the weapons
and then the, the court will
issue a temporary order, and
they'll have another hearing
down the road where it would be
prolonged if, if it's needed at
that time.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think
that that's, I think that's very
important we're talking about
this. So credible information
will let in no time be
determined by a police officer.
It will only be determined, it
will go to court first. That
determination must be made in
court, and it is not up to an
individual police officer.
Uh, the center, so it's, it's
actually both, uh, because the
officers initially responding
are going to make a
determination whether they think
it's credible, and they may walk
away at that time. So there's
actually gonna be a two-stage uh
authentication process. If we
respond out and, and, and we do
in some cases, and we don't like
what we're hearing. We don't
believe that there's enough
evidence for us to take it
further, then we won't even take
it further. If the officer
believes that there is, then
we'll go and, and a judge will
review it before we do.
anything.
OK. And Mr. Chair, Senator, I
just want to make clear under
both under current law today and
under this until a court orders
issues one of these orders. No
firearms are taken.
Thank you, Mr. Cha.
Thank you, uh, Senator.
I do have another question, um,
By allowing these firearms in
here to be confiscated based on
what some could consider as just
an accusation or it is just an
accusation, allowing the firearm
to be confiscated on just an
accusation rather than
Evidence or or concrete criminal
conviction before the guns are
taken.
How do you reconcile with as, as
not undermining um just due due
process.
So Mr. Chair, Senator, this is
not a criminal process. This is
a civil process. So all the
standards that apply in a
criminal case, uh, they, they
don't necessarily apply here
because this is a this is civil
and under the law currently, uh,
that is how it works. The, the
only real difference that this
would that this would make is
Uh, not giving a dangerous
window, uh, between taking the
the firearms and ordering that
they be taken, uh, and making it
so that the law enforcement
officers who are actually seeing
this stuff on the ground can
also report anything concerning
that they see.
Thank you.
Yeah, thank you for that answer,
actually, uh, Senator Duig.
In, in reviewing this and having
conversations, I, it was brought
up and I, I couldn't disagree
when I was asked, do you think
in any way this could have an
unfair discrimination against,
um,
The community or um uh those who
just simply can't afford
To get in a situation like this,
and I say that because something
like this is not gonna have,
it's gonna have an unfair impact
on those of us that can meet
immediately file uh uh it with
the courts ourselves or call our
attorney on the phone. Do, do
you not think that this could be
unfairly weaponized against
those who cannot quickly afford
legal representation.
Mr. Chair, so your
No, because I, so, so one, I
will say we should offer more
civil legal services as a state
to people who can't, can't
afford an attorney, but I think
this is, this is a situation
where someone would appear,
could easily appear prose, and I
think judges are probably used
to dealing with pro se folks in
these situations. But again, we
don't, so there's no lawyer, if
this were a criminal matter,
then the person would be
entitled to, say, a public
defender.
This isn't a criminal process.
This isn't a criminal matter.
It's a civil one. And we as a
state, don't generally provide
lawyers to people in those civil
matters. We should do more.
Do more civil legal services.
Um, but, but I don't, I don't
think it would be any more
discriminatory towards folks who
maybe couldn't afford legal
counsel than any of our other
civil laws where we don't
provide for for cancel
automatically.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and,
and Senator.
Do we, we've spent, we spent a
lot of uh time and money, this
legislative session, addressing
mental health as we should
included and one very important
bill that passed through here
was the competency bill.
Is there any area in this in
which um it would provide or
require.
Access and support to mental
health.
Uh, support services.
Mr. Chair and senators, there's
nothing in the bill that
requires it. I think each
jurisdiction would hopefully
reach out to them. I can only
speak for our department if
someone is in the process for
this, we do follow up to link
them to services, and then they
also once they're in services,
it encourages it because they
can petition to get their guns
back, and that's kind of gives
them credible information to
bring forward to a judge to say,
look, I'm in treatment.
So we worked, but the law itself
does not have any requirements.
I actually think, Mr. Chairman,
that that would be the most
important piece of a bill like
this, because if you're
confiscating firearms from
someone that you think in the
interim could do harm to
themselves or others, um,
leaving them with just, I mean,
just removing firearms from
their possession if the true
intent is to make sure that no
harm is done.
You're still leaving them
without any services or that the
problem still exists, would be
my greatest concern is, is this
is just a, we, we removed
firearms and then do nothing
else without any teeth and
actually saying, well, how are
we gonna make sure cause I will
assure you there are many other
ways that people do harms to to
self and others than just with a
firearm. So I think that's a
very noticeably missing
component in this, and is the
concern that this is just
An ability, one way to expand.
You know, the, the removal or
possession of someone's firearms
without due process is the
greatest concern in there. Um,
Belong to, to further comments,
Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman. Thank you, Chief
Senator Depresentative, the, the
um
Representative Garrett, Mr.
Chairman, you said this is about
the amendment, not the actual
bill. I didn't catch that. What,
what are we talking about?
Oh yeah, Mr. Chair and senator.
We're bringing two amendments to
the existing statues. That's
what I meant. He got you. So
it's about the build up the
statue.
Oh, thank you. Real quick, uh,
if I could ask you, uh, Mr.
Chairman Senator, do look on um
the top of page 5, essentially
under current law, the um
The person, uh, you know, has to
Uh, you know, the officer takes
temporary possession of the
firearms within 48 hours.
Um
Or sooner than 48 hours at the
discretion of the court. And so
we want to eliminate that 48
hours. We wanna, we want it, we
want that ability to
To take temporary possession of
the firearms, uh, immediately.
And so I'll ask you to read just
if we read it, um,
You know, or a federal firearms
licensee uh upon immediate
service of
Of the court order or of the
order, period.
and it kind of is a policy
decision if, if we keep or as
directed by the court.
I don't think we need that, and
theoretically the court could
order something different than
immediate, but do we want to
allow that, that window. So Mr.
Chair, Senator, yes, because
someone might be hospitalized.
There might be, there might be
reasons why, why that it's, it
is, it just doesn't work to
immediately effectuate that, and
so I think it is good to keep
that flexibility in there to
deal with those situations.
And
But the default has always been
immediate.
Yeah, um, Mr. Chair and senator,
we
We kept that in there because of
some of the unique situations. I
don't know if either of you have
run into one, but in one case,
the person who had the uh
temporary order delivered was
actually hospitalized, and they
couldn't remove the guns
immediately. So it's just for a
situations.
Sure, uh, Mr. Chair and
senators, we, we do at, at times
if we have somebody.
Again in Albuquerque, they allow
us as a police officer to
So if they give us credible
information that they're worried
about a patient that's
inpatient, but they know they
won't be released for a few
days. We'll ask the judge so
that they're not automatically
in.
The fault of the
The, the order. So we'll ask
them to, to hold it, but none of
the judges that that we've
petitioned have ever allowed for
that 48 hour window.
They've always said immediately,
because again, we are only
bringing things that are
extreme. It's not something
that's really like, hey, let's
wait and see if this, you know,
horrible act happens.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I
got the, the reasoning just now,
but with you talking up
He suggested that um that the
order was always immediate.
what this bill allows is
immediate or or under certain
circumstances, not immediate. So
we, you, you think this is the
best way to deal with those
unique situations.
Mr. Chair and senators, I do,
um, I believe we were one of the
first to, to implement this law,
and we get a lot of calls with
helping mentor other law
enforcement agencies, and each
area of New Mexico will read and
interpret this law differently,
and that's why we're trying to
help clarify it, and so a lot of
it goes off of Albuquerque, you
know, it's not in Albuquerque
problem. Um, I'm getting
requests everywhere. And so,
The default we feel law
enforcement and all the officers
I meet with that it should be
immediately. We don't want a
jurisdiction of misery that.
you're like convincing me and
then you're
apologize
but I'm gonna go with uh with
what I
No,
Senator, the um so the
1 through 5 of the, of the law
is not in here. It talks about
uh the, the, the bill kicks off,
you know,
The petition, uh, shall be filed
only by law enforcement officer
to refresh your memory, does,
does the bill, how does the bill
talk about a person contacting
law enforcement. The reason I
bring that up is because I'm a
On the page of page 2, it says
um
You know, if, if the respondent,
if the person who's, you know,
being concerned about it, if the
respondent is a law enforcement
officer, the petition shall be
filed by the district attorney.
How would, how would an
individual know that? Say
someone's married to an officer
or, or, or, or is a brother of
an officer who just went through
a traumatic experience and it's
very worried. How does the
person know to go to the DA
if you know.
And Mr. Pearson and I don't know
if you all have had any
experiences similar, but
sure, Mr. Transitators, they,
they would how we would get
involved in law enforcement,
unfortunately, this has
happened. It's a family lovers
called and concerned about their
loved one who is in law
enforcement, and we always ask
the person who, who they're
claiming shouldn't have a
firearm. We do an interview with
them, and they'll let us know
that they're law enforcement
because it is a big concern if
you're going to take away.
Rights because you can't work at
that moment.
But they would tell us and we
would be
through the course of the
investigation. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Thank you, Senator and
gentlemen, and OK, I understand
that. I understand how law
enforcement learns the
respondents a law enforcement
agent, how does the person, how
does the civilian learn that
they have to go to the DA's
office.
Mr. Chair and senators, there is
a website by New Mexico put
forward, which outlines it on
different ways that you can file
so they could go that way, or we
would tell them as law
enforcement, they would call the
DA.
OK, that's, that's my question,
Chairman, uh, Senator
Representative,
and so that begs the question if
I could ask you to look on the
top of page 2.
with all due respect to law
enforcement, you guys go through
a lot.
Uh, line one, top of page 2,
should, should that be a um a
may.
In other words, there's the
option and the ability to go to
the DA or the attorney general.
But theoretically that could
take valuable time. Do we want
to allow law enforcement to have
that ability to petition against
the respondent who's a law
enforcement officer or you guys
would just prefer not to go
there.
And Mr. Chair, Senator, oh no,
that is, that is beyond the
scope of what we're doing in
this bill. That's existing
language. Surely any language
that's behind us is, is, uh,
fair game, but that's, that's
not what we're, that the
problems that we're looking to
solve in this bill, that's gonna
be on it.
There are two very discrete
things this bill is doing.
Making law enforcement able to
to be a reported party and
changing that and getting rid of
that 48 hour window or
forgetting firearms. That's what
this is looking to do based on
the work of the Earth Po Task
Force, uh, that spent a lot of
time going through this, working
with law enforcement, seeing
what changes needed to be made,
and these were the, the top
recommendations that we felt it
was appropriate to move forward
on.
Thank you, Mr. Cha. So I'll take
that as an unfriendly but maybe
offline we could talk about that
if this, if this statute ever
comes around again, because the
question wasn't answered but I
appreciate what you're saying.
And everyone in this room is
aware of what the bill's doing
and that my amendment had
nothing to do with the proposed
changes.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I'm I'm glad to see as much law
enforcement supported this, um.
That, that we, that, that you
brought up, senator, so I
appreciate that they are
supporting this, and I, and I, I
think I just have a few concerns
and I guess the first one is how
long between the time the
officer
Uh, request a petition.
And he gets like a petition from
the attorney general. How long
is that process take?
Cause my assumption is,
He finds so he's got incredible
information either through his
own recognizance or through some
claim from another individual.
And he contacts this person
contacts the officer. The
officer decides, that's enough
information for me to go to the
Attorney General with. How long
is that process take?
Mr. Chair and senators, we, if
it's a law enforcement petition
on it, it would just go to a
district court judge. So from
the start of our investigation,
let's say we made that
determination we need it with
just hypothetically read or
doing the paperwork, going down
to meet with the judge and get
it signed for the first one
would be between 1 to 3 hours,
depending on it. If we did one
on a law enforcement officer,
and we petitioned the district
attorney.
I think there's only been 2. I
only know of one ever on this,
which is an extreme case, that
took about 6 to 8 hours because
it was so new.
Thank you for that. So I just,
so during this time,
It's the
Defendant, uh, the person who's
who's being considered a threat.
Are they being informed of this
process at the same time, in
other words, did they have an
opportunity to find
Attorney.
To maybe defend them if they
know that you're gonna make this
claim. They have an opportunity
to talk to someone as well, or
do they just find out when you
show up at the door.
Mr. Chair and senators,
hopefully that wouldn't be the
first time we through the course
of the investigation, you should
attempt to talk to the
respondent, so they should know
that this is, and you should be
telling them. They do have, we
have 48 hours.
After, uh, to achieve the fires,
but we would serve the person
and they would have 10 days,
they get a notice, so they would
have plenty of time to obtain
legal services.
And, and Mr. Chair, Senator, so
the way it works now is when
they're first going for for that
petition or to get that order.
It's what's called an ex parte,
which means that there's someone
doing it without
Without necessarily the the
respondent, uh, being part of
that. Usually anything that goes
before a judge, all, all the
sides need to be there for
anything that happens with the
judge. This initial one would be
ex parte. This often happens
with, uh, uh, other protections
of order, um,
Like restraining orders where
you get the initial one ex
parte, and then you come back.
In this case, 10 days later, and
have a full hearing with the
respondent, uh, to.
The
Cause what's what's initially
entered is just that temporary
order. You don't get that, you
don't get a permanent order, not
a permanent order. Here it would
only be up to one year, but
until you have that full hearing
with the judge where the person
who we're talking about would
absolutely be.
Thank you for that. I, I, I
appreciate you explaining the
process to the non-lawyers on,
on the committee here. Uh,
that's helpful for us to
understand what that process
entails.
I, I think that the, the
Concern obviously is during that
10 day period when they can
start doing due process.
Obviously, their guns have
already been taken, and they're
being held, and so, um,
And for whatever reason, it,
it's, you know, I always worry
about uh government taking
people's property. I, I think
that's, uh, that I always worry
about.
That can be a slippery slope,
uh, because the government has
infinite resources, and most
people do not. And so the
government can make any kinds of
claims and take anybody's
property, whether it be guns,
whether it be land through
eminent domain. There's all
kinds of ways the government can
take someone's property. So I
always, I'm always concerned
about
Um
Taking alleviating our, our
civil liberties, if you will,
and, and our property rights,
and so that's a big concern of
mine is about that, that, uh,
Constitutionality.
But my biggest concern is, is,
and let's assume that it's not
an officer directly, but an
officer gets a, uh, a report
from, uh, uh, an individual who
makes a claim, and this person
is
Why
But they want to.
They want to hurt this person. I
mean, you can imagine scenarios
where that has occurred. I'm
sure you may have already seen
those kinds of things where
people make false reports.
And so, um,
What are the safeguards to, or
what are the, what are the
rulings against someone who may
make a uh uh a false claim or
are there any in this bill?
And Mr. Chair, Senator, so I
think they're in the existing
law, there are that I think
that's, I was not here when,
when we passed the original law,
but I, I'm assuming that one of
the reasons
It always had to go through law
enforcement was to provide that
kind of a safeguard, was to make
sure, so there's only specific
people who can be a reporting
party in the first place, um,
it's immediate family members,
uh, employers, uh, school
administrators, um, but they
can't, they can't directly get
one of these orders from a
court. They have to go through
law enforcement. Only law
enforcement can file that
petition to get that order. And
I think one of the reasons
for that was to provide that as
a card, to make sure there's
someone else looking at what the
these allegations are, making
that credible, uh, information
determination before going
forward with that. And then you
have the ultimate guard rail of
of the judge.
Who is looking at all of this,
uh, after the petition comes to
them.
Mr. Chair and Senator, if you go
to Inham courts to the herbal
page, they have, there's a
3-page very lengthy uh petition
that goes into things like has,
has, have there been legal cases
involved? Are there other things
so that a judge at the hearing
is gonna go in depth and make
sure this is a legitimate. I
can't emphasize that this is an
imminent threat. Uh, this isn't
just a casual thing. It's one
tool when there's a belief that
there is an imminent
threat of harm to the person's
self or to other people.
And one more thing, Mr. Chair
Sen. Anyone who is the reporting
party, they have to sign an
affidavit. They have to, to
basically make this allegation
as sworn testimony. So if they
are making it up, they would be
perjuring themselves.
Thank you for that. I, I didn't
realize they had to sign an
affidavit. I think that's very
critical because that
Puts the this back on them if in
fact it's challenged down the
line. So I appreciate that.
Thank you for that. Um,
I think the Senator Brantley
mentioned, uh, the idea of, of
if it's an imminent threat or to
harm themselves or others that
Mental health issue needs to be
raised and just leaving that
person there, knowing that
they're saying crazy things or,
or
Potentially, um, like harm
someone and being outly vocal
about it. It seems to me that we
should be trying to do our best
to get them under some kind of
care immediately. Uh, I don't
know if any of the
mental health things that we've
passed recently allow custody to
take custody of somebody and at
least enjoying them for uh
evaluation is is that something
that you can respond to?
Yes sir, Mr. Transitors, um,
earlier, what I was trying to
say is this specific law,
there's no language. We have a
law in place that we do at the
same time and it's New Mexico
43, 110. So if someone is posing
a threat to themselves or others
or great passive neglect due to
behavioral health, we do take
them into custody at that same
time and take them to treatment.
It's just not, this is a
separate law that we do
separately. So they might,
they'll be in the hospital while
we're filing this. It's just not
outlined in the UFO, it's a
separate law.
And I think Mr. Chair, Senator,
actually the law that, that we
just heard described, we just
did a bill that was looking at
those definitions under that law
of harm to health or harm to
self and harm to others. So, I
think a lot of all of these
bills kind of work together in
concert.
Thank you for that. I believe
that's, that covers the uh
concerns that I expressed, and I
think the biggest one still is
this, um,
They, I, I
I was still concerned about the
person having uh due process and
um
So I'm not, I'm not quite there
yet. I'm I'm willing to listen
to more discussion around that
issue.
But thank you for your comments.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
uh, sponsors for bringing this
bill. I had just a couple of
follow-up questions to, I guess
how this overall process works,
so the petition gets filed.
And in orders granted.
How does that respondent get
notified.
that that order was granted.
Sure, Mr. Janitor and Mr. Chair
and senators. So once we get it
back from the judge, the
temporary, we serve it, or the
county sheriff of that county
would serve it to the person, so
they have to be officially
served.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
for that. So they, you would
physically have to hand them a
piece of paper stating that,
hey, this order has been
granted. We have, you know,
courts ordered us, we can remove
the firearms from your property,
wherever that's at, is that
correct?
Mr. Chair and senators, that's
correct. And we go over when
their date of a hearing is.
Thank you. And so from that
point then the
They don't have any opportunity
between losing those firearms or
having those firearms taken from
them to make an appeal.
To that order. Is that correct?
Mr. Chair, Senator, so they, so
10 days later, 10 days after
that initial, that temporary
order is put in, there is
another hearing that happens
before the judge, that's a full
hearing, and so that is where
that was where they would have
the opportunity to say, no,
Judge, look, this isn't isn't
appropriate. Here's, here's my
reasons.
OK, thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you, Senator. I guess I was just
trying to get at the idea that
we're taking it and then they've
got to come and prove why those
items should not have been taken
in the first place and maybe
they're in the right, maybe
they're in the wrong, but the
fact that they don't have the
opportunity to first defend why
those shouldn't be taken, I
guess, was, was my point, and so
that um that question is
answered, so it, if, if they
Have 10 days and they go, you
know, immediately. What does
that process look like? What are
they having to do to disprove
that, you know, they shouldn't
have had those firearms removed
from their possession and from
their property.
Mister chair and senators, they
can bring whatever they feel is
is evidence to present to the
court, and then they have a
chance to confront the person
that's making the request and so
they can cross-examine them, you
know, talk to them, have that
conversation in court.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
for that uh response. So it
seems to me that it, it might
get into in a lot of instances
in these situations where it's a
he said she said for lack of
better phrase that, you know,
that the person that's had their
firearms removed from them,
bills that they've been wrong
because now somebody's come in
and, you know, government's
taking their, their firearms
from them, and then the courts
are saying otherwise, because a
lot of this, you know, credible
information is.
very subjective and based on
who's providing it. So I just, I
have issues, you know, it, it
was interesting for me to see,
um, that, that law enforcement
was so, um, behind this,
honestly, I didn't expect to see
that, and so it's quite a
surprise. Um, and I can
understand situations that
you're put in to where, hey, you
know, you want to make sure
that, uh, uh, somebody that,
that is a threat, you know, that
they're not walking around with
those things.
Um, and Haring your officers or
others, um,
One other just kind of random
question.
With this cutting down to to an
immediate removal of those
firearms. I don't know how much
of a, you know, increase you
guys would see in firearms that
are, that are being taken and
that are having a need to be
stored, but how do you guys
handle that currently and, and
if there was an increase, is
there going to be demand for
more storage where you guys
holding these things in the
interim.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator, so I, I
don't expect that this law is
gonna really vastly increase the
number of times we're using the
bill.
Right, it's gonna speed up how
fast the weapon comes in, but
it's not going to really change
the numbers. And, and the law
has been in, in effect for maybe
4 years, maybe 5 years now. So
we've got some data on how often
police departments are using
this. And to my knowledge, we've
never gone over 100 times in a
year that the departments have
used the law. So it, it's also,
I'm, I'm speaking as the
Farmington police chief, but I'm
also the president of the New
Mexico Chiefs Association.
And this is a bill that we
support this, this amendment. So
the, the red, the emergency
protection orders law is already
in effect. This is a tweak to
allow our officers to do it, and
that comes like, like any of
these things where you can try
something for a while and you
learn some things. We've had to
walk away from situations where
the family member did not want
to be the one saying and, and
swearing and raising their hand
because they're gonna get out
and they're gonna have to deal
with that person when they get
out and, and that that person's
gonna know.
It was, it was my wife or my
husband that that petitioned it.
So just like in a DV where we
respond over, really it's the
state that that is gonna make
that, that determination. So the
police officers can go, we're
gonna listen to everything that
we see on scene. If we're not
liking it just like a DB case,
if we're not believing it, if
it's not credible to us, then
we're not going forward with it.
But if we do think that it is,
then we want the ability for the
officers to be able to go and
petition the judge, because we
have walked away in Farmington
and
In a number of instances where
the family member just didn't do
it. And they, they weren't up
for it and, and that is so risky
for us. Um, additionally, and,
and I've heard some of the, the
talk and, and really this was
the talk last time. It's bigger
than, than the change we're
trying to make here. But as far
as um due process, right? Every
day our officers right now, are
officers across the state are
going out and we're listening
just like this, and we're making
the decision whether to arrest
somebody or not.
Right? And we're gonna take him
to jail.
Not their gun. We're gonna go
out, we're gonna listen in a
domestic and we're gonna listen
to she says this, he says this,
and, and based on the evidence
that we've got the credible, the
credible evidence that we've
got, we're going to make a
decision whether we're going to
make an arrest or we're not.
So this is, I, I do understand
the due process thing, but this
is what our officers do every
day. That's why I am a bigger
supporter of it, that to get the
officers involved, they're
neutral force, they're already
doing this on a grander scale
where we could take somebody's
freedom. Now we might take the
gun if the facts lean towards,
there, there's an immediate need
for this, and we agree.
Thank you, Mr. Chen. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you, Chief.
Appreciate that response. Um, do
you know how many instances and
senators, those sponsor, I don't
know if you have any stats on
how many situations in a given
year in the state of New Mexico,
are we seeing where this is an
issue, you know, I guess the,
the reasoning behind my question
is, is this a big enough issue
that we need to address this and
change this from the 40
8 hours to immediately because
it already says within 48 hours
of service of the order or
sooner at the discretion of the
court.
So that to me, you know.
I guess it depends on the number
of these and then, you know,
they're already able to go get
them immediately anyways based
on how this is written if I'm
reading.
not, Mr. Chair, Senator. So the,
the numbers that I'm being given
here are roughly in line with
what uh my understanding was it
was 14 uh ear posts were filed
in 2022, 46 and 2023. Um, I
don't know if we have 2024's
numbers yet.
9
90. Um, so with, within that,
there would have been a couple
in additional ones, I think,
where, where law enforcement
couldn't get the family to do
it. I like I described in
Farmington, uh we did have that.
Um, so I, I still expect the
number and, and what I liked
about it was we got it, we kind
of ran this for a few years.
Let's see how law enforcement
uses it. And, and I agree with
you. I would be concerned if you
were seeing hundreds of these
in, in the first couple of
years, right? We just unleashed
it, but, but I think it's been
pretty
And the first one we used in
Farmington, the subject had was
with his son being taken care
of, had significant mental
health problems when off
medicine, started firing a rifle
out the window around the
neighborhood when our SWAT team
responded, he began firing at
our, at our bear cat and, and
hitting our bear cat as we're
doing it. In the end, we are
finally able to talk him down.
We got him arrested, um, he went
off to jail on that, but then we
also went forward and we filed
our first red flag order saying,
you know, look, if he gets
and he still has access to guns.
The son in that case did agree
to, to be the petitioner, but
right, that, that's a bad spot
for him to be in when, when that
guy gets out. And, and so I
don't like the notion that we're
going to have to try and talk or
pressure a family member into
doing that, because what happens
if something goes wrong and
they, and they get out and they
take it out on them, right? And,
and we kind of pressured him
into it. I'd rather just the,
the totality of the
circumstances that my officers
see, if we believe that it's
credible, then let us go
forward. If the
judge agrees with us, then fine.
If he doesn't, that's fine too.
But, but there was a good
example of if, if the sun had
not agreed to do it, then a guy
who's openly firing at law
enforcement, we, he's he's off
his meds. We know he's got a
problem. Let's just settle it
back down. It is really what I'm
looking for.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Chief. I appreciate the
responses. I don't have any
further questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
appreciate this question. Just
to clarify on something, I think
that the part that you hit on
when we're talking about the
affidavit is very important, and
I would think it's important to
law enforcement because you
would want to reduce as much
liability on the police
officers, and you also have a
reputation to protect and that
reputation can be tarnished if
you're given information that is
not credible. And so I, I would
ask you to clarify this if you
can. If a personally, if a
person knowingly.
Um, and, and purposely just
request, let's say it's even
denied requests for this
petition to be made um by your
to be made and you find out that
it's false or was completely
misleading. What are the
consequences of that action and
can the respondents then take
action for any damages that they
may have incurred it at all.
Well, Mr. Chair, uh, Senator, so
I
I mean, I, I'm imagining the
scenario that I was presenting
to you of domestic violence that
we go over and we listen to both
sides. Um, first of all, they're
finally a false police report.
If, if it proves to be false,
what they're alleging, whoever
that is. Um, so there, there
would be a criminal charge
attached to reporting to us some
something that isn't true, um,
and, and then depending on, on
what we did after that. I think
certainly, uh, somebody would
have a legal right to sue if
that if if we took action, they
sue.
of course, to an extent, but
they would also sue the person
that provided that false
information.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm
just gonna defer very quickly to
my lawyer friend here, Senator,
can you, can you also verify
that they would be able to take
action against the person who
made that report on, so I think
whatever the penalty for perjury
would be in that circumstance
could apply, but then there's,
and help me out, senators, uh,
with Cervantes or.
What is it well.
Oh, what is the word for when
you say false things about
someone and truth, truth is a
defense.
No, no, libel, libel. Yes, so I
guess you could bring probably
maybe bring an action reliable
or slander, um.
right
That we got.
Right, there's there's civil
claims. So if you would have to,
to show that you were damaged in
some way by that.
And by those by that, by them
doing that, and then
prove that.
Almost impossible to prove. It's
almost impossible to prove, as
you say. So, Mr. Chairman, I
would, and, and Senator and the
officers here, I would wonder if
you'd want to put any teeth in,
in a law or something that would
a person who is knowingly and
purposely making these false
accusations cause I will tell
you the the entity that is
certainly going to be damaged in
that case, is the, the law
enforcement agency, and
In your defense, it seems like
It all you were doing, you were
provided inaccurate information
and acted upon such, and that is
the biggest concern on this
entire bill is to be able to
then focus the attention and
hold the person who is providing
inaccurate information that
misleading information
encouraged the police department
to take action. They are then
tarnished, they are then have
legal damages from it, but the
person who may continue to make
these accusations, that's the
person who needs to be held
accountable. How do we hold them
accountable?
For damages. Mr. Chair and
senators, I will say why this
bill in the very beginning,
while I was supportive as law
enforcement because a lot of the
um concerns that you guys
brought up is about hearsay. So
this person says this versus the
other, which happens in domestic
violence restraining orders.
This one gives us that barrier
that if someone's presenting us
with that information if they
want to be the reporting party,
they have to make a sworn
affidavit. Therefore, if they
are found lying, they can be
held in court and people could
seek like civil litigation on
it. And also in this law
requires, if you're making a
request and you make it to me
and I'm like, oh, this sounds
like hearsay and you guys are
having like a fight. I'm
required to make a police
report. Therefore, in order to
say you're filing a false police
report, there has to be a
documented police report, and so
that way we have it documented.
There's a lot of this is the
only law that we have when two
people make an argument that we
have barriers in place. There's
no other criminal law that we
have that way. So this one does.
give it to us. So if we are
going to present as law
enforcement, it is in good
faith.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator, uh, what
he's bringing up is, is right.
This, this law gets to be a
blend between criminal and
existing civil. So right now you
can go down and get a
restraining order against a
significant other.
With, with no law enforcement
involvement.
Right, you're, you're gonna talk
with the judge, you're gonna
fill out the paperwork. The
judge is going to make a
determination. In that case, the
judge has broad powers to remove
you from your home to prevent
you from seeing your kids,
right? And, and that, then there
is another hearing where then
you get as the respondent, you
get a chance to come in and
argue against that. But the
initial stuff doesn't involve
the police and doesn't involve
this step that we're talking
about. So exactly like he's
saying, there's, there's more
due process on this because we
want law enforcement involved.
We want to hear the story. If
we're not buying the story,
then, then we're not going
forward with it. But if there is
credible, then we want to go
forward to a judge and the judge
immediately has a chance to
review it. Thank you.
I'm gonna put this on.
I, I think so too.
Um
Mr. Chairman and senator and and
law officers.
Thank you for that. But I think
what we've clarified is that
there's still liability in the,
in the event there was a
misleading or false claim, and
the law enforcement officers
took action, that there's a lot
of liability then brought that
would still face law
enforcement, so the department,
but there's very little
consequences for someone who's
making the false accusation, and
that is really the crux of the
concern.
Is abuse or weaponizing of, of,
of this.
And and Mr. I just, I just want
to make clear cause you you're
referencing liability on law
enforcement, as long as they are
Doing their job in good faith.
There's not going to be
liability on them, because
someone else perjured
themselves, as long as they are
otherwise finding that that
credible evidence to go forward,
and they are not participating
in perjury or going outside of
the scope of of what they're
allowed to do. There's not going
to be liability on law
enforcement because someone else
said something false. Mr.
Chairman, and I think there's
still though,
Zero consequences for someone
who is making false accounts and
it and it wastes time uh of our
And, and Mr. Chair Senator, I
think that there, there are
consequences under, under our
other laws. Uh, and it might not
be in this bill in front of us,
but it's not that there's no, no
consequence. You file a false
police report. You are
responsible for that. If you,
you know, if you perjure
yourself, there are consequences
for that. So there are
consequences.
They're just not repeated here,
yeah.
Chairman.
Thank you, Senator Brantley.
What else, Senator O'Malley,
then Senator Mas again.
You want to make more
statements, I, well, I just
wanted to, to say that, uh, you
know, with the, with the due
process.
Um, and, you know, the officer's
best judgment we're talking
about people here. They, you
know, people lie, all kinds of
things can happen when you
encounter folks who are.
having a sort of a a problem in
terms of um behavioral health.
We, we know that's, that's a, an
area and quite frankly, I admire
uh the first responders who go
in with into those situations
because they're extremely
dangerous.
Um, so I, I think this is a good
deal like I'm, I'm glad that
you, you saw what, you know,
what worked and what didn't.
And you can see that uh it makes
sense for you to have this uh uh
ability to get in there and,
and, and act as soon as
possible, but it's as soon as
possible. It's not you say
immediate, but you still have to
go through a process. So there
is due process.
So, um, anyway, I'm I'm
supportive. I don't know if
there's an opportunity to do to,
you know, when we do pass, but
because you might wanna see.
OK.
Yeah, so it's worth and then
center Masters. Thank you,
chair. I really don't have
questions. I just very much
appreciate law enforcement being
here. I mean, we went through
this whole debate, 56 years ago,
and all the things that could
happen and the reasons we
shouldn't do this, and it's very
compelling to me to have you
here saying these changes give
you another tool in the toolbox
and it's part of the whole
discussion we've been having.
session for folks that are in
crisis.
How do we get them the help that
they need? How do we get them
out of a situation that's gonna
be
Potentially incredibly
detrimental, puts your you folks
in right in the middle of it,
but also uh the, the thing that
really resonated with me is the
the the the fault here is asking
family members to step up and
putting them in a position where
someone's off their meds, they
go in.
To get help, they're back on,
and all of a sudden they're home
and here's the person that's
gone through this process, and
then something transitions
again, so.
Uh, again, this is, this makes
total sense to me, and I just
think that
having it come from you all. I
really appreciate you all being
here. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Who knows?
3
Just one last question. I, I
guess.
I'm struggling with this and I,
I think I will talk to, uh,
Senator do after this because
I'm sure it's gonna get through,
but um,
But I just wanna know, why did
you decide on this credible
information threshold versus
probable cause. I know they both
sound
Legalistic to me, but
Why did you go with, instead of
using the probable cause
threshold versus uh credible
information.
Sure, uh, Mr. Chair and Senator,
it's
That kind of the same term. We
use credible information to have
probable cause to present it to
court.
So we, we couldn't have probable
cause without credible
information. It's just legal
terms.
That I wish I knew more about
for you.
Is, is there anything else
besides credible information
that leads to
Probable cause, I mean, are
there other pieces of
information that come in or
other things? No.
OK, so it's, it's just a
legalistic term. You writers
are.
Amazing
you've heard it from me and it's
on, and it's been recorded.
Not the way I heard it. Let the
record show I stand you lawyers
are amazing.
Uh, Senator Maest this again
just briefly, thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Thank you. Thanks for
allowing us to explore the
whole, the whole law instead of
just the bill, but, but
A credible information is
already in existing law, and the
standard is probable cause on
line 19. The standard is
probable cause with the, with
the officer ultimately and with
the judge. So I think that's the
standard. And then also just, I,
I share the sentiments of
Senator Brown. I hate filing
false reports. Those people
should be.
Throwing the book out, um, as a
former domestic violence
prosecutor, but just, it's a
it's a reminder that um it is
easier to take someone's kids in
the state of New Mexico than to
take their firearms.
All right, I think we've been
through everybody, um, hello
again, representative and
Miranda back there too, so, uh,
was the Senate sponsor of Senate
Bill 5 that passed this in 2020.
It seems like it was just the
other day, but it's been a while
in, in looking back at some of
the news accounts, the time you
all probably remember this, um,
to the center worst point, every
sheriff in the state opposes but
one Donana County Sheriff
supported but all sheriffs were
opposed. Some of them were
pretty vocal at the time, they
said they wouldn't enforce it.
Um, and they also said they
would sue the constitutional
Second Amendment, etc. Um, I, I
used the opportunity not to be
critical of the tempers and
attitudes of the time, but
rather to say that uh we wanna
be collaborative. We want to be
partners, we want to be with you
all, we want to give you tools
and so whether it's looking
carefully at assault weapons,
whether it's looking carefully
at box switches and weapon
conversion devices. I hope that
for the law enforcement people
in the room, I've said this
repeatedly, I don't think I
could.
never said it's enough. The
thing that I find most
detestable about gun violence is
the idea that you guys in
uniform and you women in uniform
are going out in the streets and
you're outgunned. The fact that
our adversaries would have
superior firepower and weapons
to use should be something that
should never be acceptable in a
civilized society, to my mind,
and we certainly wouldn't
tolerate that from our military
and our armed forces into battle
with lesser weapons than our
adversaries knowingly doing so
when we have the means to, to do
otherwise.
I, I'm hoping that I'm very
encouraged. I, I've always, as a
gun owner, I've always said that
those of us that are gun owners
should be the leaders in passing
the laws, that's why I wanted to
leave with Representative
Garrett at the time and Miss
Pascoli on, on this bill, and
again, we were challenged and
told all the threats of
lawsuits. I used the opportunity
to, to say that I'm still 100%
on a gun laws, every time we
pass them, we're told we're
gonna be challenging in court
and constitutionally. I can't
take credit, we have a
crackerjack uh all the team
here.
And law firm and we threaded the
needle and even as recently as
last session when we passed a
seven-day waiting period, once
again, you're gonna get sued.
It's unconstitutional. Well, we
did, we did get sued and it did
go to court and a federal judge
said it is constitutional. So,
um, we're, we're doing, I think
some important things, but I
just want you all in uniform
here today former law
enforcement here. I, I want you
to know what goes through my
head a lot, which is the idea
that you all are going out on
the streets every day with
people that have some of these
weapons and they should.
have them or that we have people
who just frankly are not
competent to, to have firearms
or in crisis, um, really is, is
to get some, um, I think
ultimately my motivation for a
lot of things, so it, it, it
seems like just the other day
represented but um.
5 years, so.
Welcome back. I, I, the only
question I really had was I like
in a lot of the press accounts
over the last several years
since we passed this in multiple
stories I saw stories to suggest
that law enforcement were saying
they didn't have the authority
to do this. I saw that refrain
constantly and I, I somehow I
got, uh, the idea got out there
that I'm opposed to this bill,
and that wasn't the case at all.
The the bill passed when they
passed in the Senate by one
vote, um, after you all think
that you're the first ones to
keep me up there for 4 or 5
hours. That's, you know, that's
kids stuff. I mean, that would
That one was probably about 4 or
5 hours into and I think we have
we have 7 amendments on the
floor, um, just for the sake of
the, the new members committee.
Almost all of those amendments
were proposed by my friends in
the minority Party, the
Republican Party, and I accepted
those, many of those I think all
of those 7 rejected some others,
all with the hope of trying to
get to a bipartisan support
didn't happen in him, but we
still took a lot of Republican
amendments to make it a better
bill and it's turned out to be a
good bill. So, um, again, a
little
History lesson for everyone here
today and to encourage those who
have good ideas for gun safety
that we continue to do so and to
let law enforcement again know
we want to be your partners, um,
and, and this is a good
opportunity to Senator Wirtz's
comments with my that this is
what this is about.
Du pass motion, I think, was it
your Senator O'Malley, he was,
right? So, uh, is there, uh,
let's do a roll call, please.
your family
so.
And do they
Senator O'Malley, yes.
And no.
Understood.
Yes
Senator Thornton.
Now explain my vote.
Better work.
Yes.
Senator
to explain your vote, who was
that Senator Thornton?
Thank you, chair. I, I.
I came here with uh an
amendment, but I thought it'd be
better to talk to you about it
offline and maybe if it goes to
the floor, we can have that
discussion and, and see if you
can convince me otherwise or, or
you might think it's a good
amendment, so I don't want to do
this in this scenario, but, uh,
looking forward to that
conversation. Thank you very
much.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
To shares House Bill 149.
Um.
Um, as folks who are leaving, I
will, uh, I'll let all of you
know that right now,
Right now I do not anticipate us
meeting tomorrow as a committee.
We have a floor session at one
o'clock, but I don't anticipate
the need for us to meet the
judiciary will still last. We'll
still have meetings on Monday
and Wednesday and Friday to get
out for the last remaining house
bills were really consider
Pope's bill was really the last
realistic Senate bill that I
think we will be able to see. I
know some of you also have some
bills you'd like to see, so we
won't rule anything out, but
that's probably the, the focus
will be on house bills. So
Senator Sher
I thank you, Mr. Chair.
Uh, I'm filling in for
Representative Obada today.
She's much nicer than I am, but
this is as good as you get for
the day. So this is House Bill
149. It's uh supported decision
making Act, and really what it
does is it creates, uh, provides
requirements for supportive
decision making and creates a
whole mechanism uh in the in the
office of guardianship.
Uh, supportive decision making.
Wow, uh individuals retain the
right to make their own
decisions for themselves, with
the support of trusted friends
and family, uh, that they
choose, so supported.
Decision making does not
eliminate guardianship or yes,
conservative ship.
So I have an expert witness
here, Alice Lou McCoy, and she
will answer all of the questions
you have except questions about
firearms.
We have um
registered in support of
Margaret Craig, Joanna Co, Tommy
Hernandez. Are any of y'all
here?
which all come forward.
I'll recognize that you should
be for 2 minutes.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, Tommy Hernandez
registered lobbyist and public
policy director for the
Alzheimer's Association. I'll be
very brief, we stand in strong
support of this bill. We
encourage the committee to do
move it forward. Thank you.
Um
have to do this one.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Margaret Gray, and I'm a
volunteer advocate for AARP New
Mexico. We ask you to pass House
Bill 149 to help maintain the
dignity, respect, and autonomy
of individuals as they age and
rely on others for support and
advice. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, members of
committee, my name is Julian
Kub. I'm the registered lobbyist
for New Mexico trial Lawyers
Association, trial lawyers
promote justice and fairness for
injured people by safeguarding
victims' rights, particularly
the right to a trial by jury of
New Mexicans and ensuring that
an individual can seek legal
recourse when harmed. We
appreciate representative Abeta
Representative Ferrari for
ensuring that individuals can
seek legal
their legal rights and balancing
this bill with services and
those rights. Thank you.
Good evening, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee. Uh, my
name's Joel Davis. I'm chairman
of the development of Disability
Council and vice president of
Elevate the Spectrum, and I'll
volunteer autism advocacy
network and for so many reasons,
we support this bill. I believe
the sponsors and their experts
will.
Highlight those. Thank you.
I think you mentioned I have an
amendment.
You can pass that out and uh
I've spoken.
With uh with
Alice about this, um, and, uh,
the secretary, and I'm assuming
that they
the sponsors, uh,
I'll wait till it gets passed
out and then I'll, I'll go
through it.
And Mr. Chair, while, while it's
being passed out, I'll say, so
I, I was previously on the, the
wings commission, which, uh,
where this has been discussed a
lot.
And I'll, I'll admit, Mr. Chair,
that, that for a couple of
years, I, I pushed back against
this idea.
And I just didn't understand why
it was needed. I said, well,
can't people just do this
voluntarily? Can't you use a
power of attorney. Why, why do
we need this? Um, and Mr. Chair,
uh, the, the conclusion that I
have come to is that my lack of
understanding of why we need it
is due to my lack of expertise
in this area. It's not because
it's not necessary that the
people who practice in this
area, um, and who see, uh,
especially legal situations, um,
with the folks that this would
impact come in front of them,
uh, day after day.
They all see the need for this,
and, and so I am, I trust their
expertise in this area and
recognize that my failure to
understand it isn't necessarily
because there's not an actual
need for it. It's because I
don't have the expertise, uh,
and, and lived experience, but
That would, um,
That would, that would inform me
as to why this is necessary, but
I do trust the, the experts who
are working in this area when
they say there is a need for
this. Um, that's what Mr. Chair,
uh, there, this is an amendment.
To
largely to make this conform to
the conventions of this
committee.
So, what it does,
is on page 4, there is a
presumption of capacity, um, I
think it makes sense that
there's a presumption of
capacity, but there's also
language in there giving a
presumption of the ability to
manage, manage their own
affairs, and so this amendment
would just take out the capable
of managing their own affairs
language, I think that
presumption of capacity is
essential, and that is language
that we have, uh, in other parts
of our law, but this was kind of
added in and so I wanted to keep
it to the
standard of, of with the
presumption of capacity.
On page 4 line 25.
There is the standard.
Uh, and this is for the
And the standards that would be
applied to the person, that to
the supporter.
It was helping someone under
this act.
Right now it is active care
confidence, diligence,
ordinarily exercised by
supporters in similar
circumstances.
I don't know what that means. So
I'm instead changing supporters
to a reasonable person because a
reasonable person standard is
something that we, we already
use in law.
On
Page 5 line 4. Yeah, these are
things that would apply to the
supporters. It says avoid
self-dealing, we should just, we
should just pull out prohibit
self-dealing for these folks. It
would change a void to not
engage in.
On page 5, there's the section 7
that is saying the supporter is
not a fiduciary agent of the
decision maker.
This amendment would just take
that out completely. I, I think
they are, they, they would be a
fiduciary. They would have, I, I
think it's important that if, if
there's a supporter who
Who went off the rails and was
not, not appropriately
representing someone's interests
under this. Uh, I certainly
would not want there to be any
question about are they
immunized for that behavior
because we have said that they
are not a fiduciary agent.
On page 6.
Um
it's really just clean up, uh,
There's that section 9 to me
seemed like those should be
separate sections.
Um, bee did not seem seem uh
Like it went necessarily with A
in the same section, and then
otherwise, we're doing is, oh,
This third part of your
reliance, section 10 at the
bottom of page 6. So it says,
look, you shall rely on, on one
of these documents if you get
it, but then later on in the
bill, we say if you suspect uh
this person is being abused or,
or neglected or exploited, you
have an obligation to to not
Rely on it. And so I wanted to
make sure that that was
consistent. We want to say yes,
because a lot of times like
banks and stuff will refuse to
rely on powers of attorney, uh,
in situations like this. So we
want people to, we absolutely
want to say you shall rely on
this, but we need to leave that.
We don't want it to be
inconsistent with a requirement
to to report um and respond
appropriately to suspected
abuse, neglect, uh, or
exploitation. So it's just
adding in, you shall rely on it
unless you suspect abuse,
neglect, or exploitation, and
then you gotta make that report
pursuant to Section 13.
That is the amendment, Mr.
Chair.
Mr. Chair
As much as it disappoints me, it
is a friendly.
Moved on to the amendment.
Um, I don't see anyone else.
I'll, I'll come back to perhaps
a little bit of of discussion
with Senator Deit about
Whether this does anything
different than what we already
have in the law. I'm still at a
loss to that, but we're looking
at the amendment itself, so if
you look at, for example,
paragraph 6.
Since the existence of this type
of an agreement does not
preclude the decision maker.
This is the person who's giving
the authority does not preclude
them from seeking personal
information without the
assistance of a supporter.
We really need a law to tell
somebody that I'm, I'm giving
you authority to help me, but I
still have the authority to go
find the information myself. Do
we really need a law to tell us
that?
But why, I'd like to um refer to
um Ms. Alice Lou McCoy, um, for
that answer.
Mr. Chair, the, uh, language was
part of a section that gave the
supporter uh ability to help
with collecting information and
what we find in practices with
people with disabilities often
if we're allowing others to help
them, then there is sometimes an
assumption from third parties
that they somehow don't have
capacity themselves to do it.
And so we just wanted to make
that clarification. We pulled it
out.
a new section, but you know,
it's not the most important part
of this bill at all.
I don't really think it does
anything, uh, because again,
you're, you're saying, well, we,
we think we need to talk again,
I'm gonna use myself in the
senatorch as an example. I feel
like I need his support to help
me make decisions. So we enter
into an agreement, we've got all
the formalities here and, and
this language says I can still
go get information without you.
Which seems to me pretty
self-evident and without the
need for a law, number one, and
then, and you're saying, well,
you're, you're gonna put this in
law so that I don't get confused
and by giving him the agreement,
I can't go get information for
myself, but that presumes I'm
reading the law that presumes
I'm a lawyer or I'm reading the
statutes, um, and that's
probably unrealistic. So again,
that, that, that's just one
example of I think what I'll go
through the bill a lot because I
really do, I really, I'm, I'm
gonna read again. I'm gonna
listen carefully.
Um,
But I think all of this is
really within our laws for
guardianships, conservatorships,
and power of attorney. I'm going
to try and figure out.
To tonight, how if any way this
does anything that we don't
already have a lot of love and,
and, and I'll just
I'll express my concern that
that um more and more we seem to
be taking what is already law
and then we rebrand it, we
repackage it, we put new names
on it, and we spin it around and
that's a new language, but
that complicates life for us as
lawyers because these orange
volumes we have here are just
growing and growing and growing
with the laws all the time, and
that sometimes counterproductive
because then there's sometimes
conflicts that are created
between the various laws and and
judges and lawyers will have to
decide, well, which
The, the courts will assume the
legislature knew what we were
doing. It's one of the, one of
the rules of statutory
construction sound too lawyerly,
but courts have rules by which
they try and interpret what we
mean. And the reason they have
those rules to interpret what I
mean is we oftentimes pass laws
that nobody can figure out what
we have.
So we do this so commonly in the
law, we enact things the courts
can't figure out what we're
talking about. So they actually
have their set of rules by which
they try and interpret what
we're saying and, and one of the
rules is that the courts will
presume that the latter passed
law was done in my mindfully of
the preceding earlier laws that
makes some sense, but I'm saying
that if we pass a law today on
the topic, and there was a lot
of this past two years ago, the
court's gonna say, we, we, we're
gonna presume the legislature
knew about the older law.
And intended to pass the newer
law for some reason and they'll
interpret it with that in mind.
So, so I get a little concerned
when we start doing things like
this that would kind of step
over or step on our attorney
laws guardianship laws, probate
laws, arbitorney, I'm sorry, uh,
conservatorship, guardianship
and power of attorney really are
where we're at. So I, I
appreciate your candor. Um, I, I
just really, I can't see what
that does anything, and I think
that's gonna be probably part
My concerns with the bill
overall, but, you know, we're on
the amendment and I
I guess if if I'm in the
minority on this bill and I may
very well be putting more
unnecessary language into a bill
that seems to be unnecessary,
doesn't seem to really be doing
any harm, so I don't know that
I'll necessarily reject the
amendment. Um, but, you know,
Senator represent why would you
tell me why is this amendment
important? You said it's
conserve you said it's
constructive, so what does this
do that you think is important
to your bill?
Mr. Chair, I asked for the
amendment. Um, well, they said
it's constructor. I just wanted
to understand what they
understand.
I want to understand what they
understand this to do.
Mr. Chair, I worked with Miss
McCoy on, on the amendments. I
think it might be unfair to ask
the, the legislators to tell
their understanding of that
conversation, OK, and I don't
mean to put you on the spot
again
and it was
and it was someone that um would
help with the bill and um that,
you know, this is something that
um are uh
Wings, you know, the, um,
The acronym uh for the wings is
the uh
Working interdisciplinary
network of guardianship
stakeholders, the wings group
that was formed 2 years ago with
Supreme Court and district
judges and different
stakeholders from disabilities
rights and their advocates and a
few of us as legislators um have
been working to streamline this
language, and it's an important
part that we um provide this so
that we don't have people, um,
it, it's another
Um, run on the ladder for things
to be offered and instead of
people having to go directly
into conservatorship or
guardianship. This is another
option that it will be available
and recognized, um.
You know, by the courts, and,
you know, if someone goes into
the hospital and they can't find
someone instead of, you know,
that can help that person, um,
right away, they have been
sending people directly into um,
you know, guardianships with the
courts, and that's not always
necessary, but the person, you
know, just might have to have
someone who was there to help
them make a healthcare decision
or financial or um other type of
things.
That, so this is what the
supported decision making um
offers.
Well, I, and I appreciate that
explanation I'll tell you that
it is so common.
Uh, in our existing law, how we
do this, that when I, when I go
to the hospital or even when I'm
admitted, I'm presented with all
the forms. I'm asked, do you
have a power of attorney? Do you
have a, you know, advanced
health care directive. Do you
have a will? I'massed all those
documents and, and it also has
little check box that says if I
don't, they said, do you want us
to give you one? And they've got
the forms. They'll, they'll give
me a power of attorney form.
They'll give me an advance
healthcare directive form. This
is just so commonly done.
Um, and so,
um, but there are other times
when you know someone needs to
have, you know, um,
someone there to help them make
those kinds of decisions, you
know, before they get into a
situation like that.
I agree, um, but it, this is so
commonly done. We actually have
a form in our statute for a
power of attorney. We actually
have the language and form for a
power of attorney actually in
our statutes now.
So, here you're suggesting that
these people could craft an
agreement to do all of the same
things you would do with we
power of attorney. So if you
look at page 3, it's this in
this bill we call a supported
decision making agreement.
But it has to be in writing, it
has to be it has to be signed,
has to designate a supporter
that would be the person you're
giving the power of attorney to,
and then it says list of
decisions which the support is
authorized to assist. That's
what you do in a power of
attorney, you list the powers
that they would have, and it
says list of decisions, they
would have you do all that in
the power of attorney, and, and
I'm hoping somebody with the
staff can help me and make sure
I've got this right cause it's,
it's not an area of law practice
in, and I appreciate Senator Do
saying, uh, well, we need some
need to sometimes defer to
people that are
in their area, and I, I, uh,
generally adopt that, but
sometimes some of us up here may
actually know some things that
even experts in the field may
not, and so um I'm looking over
to the staff and they can
confirm that. do you all find
the power of attorney statute?
There's actually a statue in the
form, I believe I don't have
said a word that I just thought
you said a word our attorney. Am
I right? Isn't there a form
statutory power of attorney
statutory power of attorney, so
we have the form already in our
statutes to do all these things,
I have, um, Miss McCoy, uh,
respond to that.
Mr. Chair, the difference
between a power of attorney in
something like this supported
decision making is in the power
of attorney agreement, we are
creating an agents. We're
creating a person who acts or
speaks on behalf of a person and
even in a limited power of
attorney, we're still putting
somebody in between the person
and the community at large,
something like this envisions a
person being out in
the community interacting
directly with third parties
with, you know, everybody around
them.
And they are allowed to bring
supporters with them to provide
any kind of accommodations that
they might need to make, uh, you
know, their communication
successful to help them
understand the information
they're receiving, and the
reason this is so important is
because the world isn't set up
to be very accessible for many
people living with disabilities
and having a law that recognizes
that yes, you do have a right to
bring your accommodations with
you to bring the people that you
need to help.
you interact successfully in the
world. Um, that's so important
and uh uh as Representative
Ferrari stated, we do, you know,
we did have unanimous
endorsement by the wings, um,
the Supreme Court's wings.
Which is a, it's really, but
it's a working group is what it
is, looking at guardianship
issues and issues related to
guardianship, and one of the
things that we heard from judges
who stated in wings meetings was
that they really wished that
there was another option other
than the ones that we had in the
law that allowed people to do
that, to practice their own
decision making power to, you
know, so that parents can
empower their children to learn
how to make decisions on their
own, you know.
This is, this is something that
we don't necessarily let people
with disabilities do even from a
very young age, and they have to
practice it. And so having a law
that gives people the support
they need while still
maintaining their
self-determination has been
shown over and over again in
many studies to increase quality
of life and uh
You know, you live longer.
Everything is better now,
basically, if when you can do
that, when you can have control
of your life. So that's the main
difference between the power of
attorney and something like
support decision making, who
you're centering, who you're
retaining as the as the person
who gets to make the decisions.
Well, again, I, I understand and
I respect that, but that's what
you do with the power of
attorney. Power of attorney, you
decide who you're going to give
the power to, and you set the
parameters and limitations and
you're your explanation was,
well, with the power of attorney
putting an agent between that
person and others, not
necessarily. Um, you can get
power of attorney with
limitations and parameters, and
even if I give you a power of
attorney doesn't mean I can't
continue to exercise those the
same responsibilities and roles
that they give me all the our
attorney statutes.
Um, yeah. And Mr. Chair, it
gives the person the power to
make their own decisions, and if
they have to go to a power uh an
attorney all the time. This is
much different. This is where
the person is getting that
advice, right? You know,
immediately, and for them to
make those decisions.
You know, with that kind of
support and um you know, uh,
Conferencing with someone. You
can't go to an attorney all the
time and get that kind of
advice. This is kind of an in
between where you don't have to
have a guardian or conservator
making those decisions for you
and taking away your own
self-direction, and that is what
really keeps people, um, you
know, uh, their self-confidence,
their own, you know, uh,
self-determination.
Representative, I appreciate
that. It's probably confusing,
uh, because we call it this
procedure, the process and the
existing law in the forms of
power of attorney doesn't mean
you have to have an attorney, so
you don't have to go to an
attorney to do a power of
attorney. In fact, again, you
can go into our statutes and
print it off the the web and,
and there, there's your
document, and then we even have
in there have procedures by
which you record a termination
of a power of attorney.
Um, we have a power of trade for
savings accounts.
We have an interpretation of
meaning and effect of the power
of attorney, um, the statutory
form is a 45-5B-301.
We have prohibitions on power of
attorney cannot be used.
We have a lot of very um
important law that guides us and
my concern is that when we
create another law that steps
over the existing law and, and
this, this is gonna step over
that. There, there's some,
there's some overlap. There are
some things that are entirely
exactly the same, in fact,
again, when I'm looking at
section 4 in in terms of what
this form is the agreement
because this has the
requirements of the agreement. I
almost think these are more
strict than a power of attorney.
Uh.
But again, this is not an area
of doing power of training, but
I'll defer to Senator doing or
work. This says you have to have
a, the agreement signed in the
presence of at least 2 adult
witnesses or a notary public,
um, that's for a will, right?
But do you have to have that for
a power of attorney? You need a
notary, but not witnesses. And
so, so this is more strict, uh,
potentially then getting a power
of attorney. So you're
concerned, representative you're
saying, well, not everybody can
get the lawyers. You don't have
to work.
Uh, you don't for a power of
attorney so we call it a power
of attorney, but it's, it's, it
can be confusing.
It can be like a spouse or
something, which I mean anybody,
which is what this does. This
means you can designate anybody,
uh, to have these powers and you
specify what they are, and
nothing in a power of attorney
and I can't really think of
anything. I don't think a power
of attorney will divest you of
any powers in the power of
attorney itself by by operation
of that. Now, if you go to a
cart guarding ship or
conservatorship, yep, that you
could do that. You could say,
hey, look, I, I think I'm gonna
have a declining, uh, mental
state over time.
And I'm gonna, um, put something
in place like a guardianship or
conservatorship and and you'd
have to go to court to maybe
have that lifted. I'm gonna
defer to set of work because I
know he does a lot of work in
this area, but I'm still
fundamentally trying to figure
out what this would do that
would be different than you
couldn't do with the power of
attorney with her somebody could
show me what would be different
here other than maybe more
strict I'm all ears. Well, Mr.
Charley, the formation is more
strict, but when you go to page
5, section 6.
Uh, line to supporters
prohibited from making decisions
on behalf of the decision maker.
That's the thing that I look at
and go,
Wait a minute, I mean, again, it
gets really into a tricky, I
could see.
Just being in a gray area where
you're having trouble.
You know, if someone's having an
issue and but, so that is very
different than a power of
attorney, for sure, because the
power of attorney, and again,
you can give a power of attorney
to someone when you have
capacity, and it can be affected
immediately. I've got one with
my wife and uh the nice thing
about a power of attorney is you
avoid, you don't necessarily
avoid a guardianship or
conservatorship, but it
You can stay in the actual
document that the person you're
naming is your
to be the conservative guardian
and the courts will, if someone
else tried to pull you in. I've
always been able to show that,
and that's the courts will back
right off of it, because you,
the guardianship conservatorship
is, that's the last place
anybody wants to be. That, that
is the true situation where you
have third parties involved
that.
And all kinds of experts and
things, but a power of attorney
and it's statutory, and there's
a statutory form for both.
You know, for the transactional
general power of attorney, and
then there's a health care power
of attorney where you can spell
out an incredible detail. I
actually go in at the end for
end of life decisions, you know,
clients come and they've really
spent the time to
It's specify exactly what they
want that person to do or not
do.
Uh, but I guess I'm just having
a little, I'm just, again, and I
apologize, I was in with Senator
Munoz, so walked, walked in, in
the middle of this, but I defer
to you and I'll, I'll come back
to you say because I really
don't want to have your input,
but that's right, I understand,
yeah, I didn't even,
I didn't even know there was an
amendment, so I apologize.
And I appreciate that. And
normally we would act on the
amendment, but, but the, the,
my, my position on the amendment
is to determined by what the
whole bill does. I really can't
address the amendment in
isolation because paragraph 6 as
I said, says the existence of
this kind of agreement does not
preclude the decision maker from
seeking personal information
without the assistance of the
supporter. And why would I add
that language to the bill, which
is what this proposal to do if I
don't see any point to having to
have an agreement that
I can give you authority, uh,
Senator, for me, but I can still
go out and get my own
information, of course, of
course I can. Um, and, and, and
I, I would respectfully, again,
you may bunch of lawyers,
different opinions. I'm, I'm
deferring to certain word only
because I've hired him before as
a guardian, uh, for some of my
clients and, and the court has
appointed him as a guardian said
word said but that's the last
place you want to go. I'm gonna
respectfully maybe have him
rethink that a little bit. I
think she's conservatives are.
horrific when they're when
they're needed, right? They they
exist for a purpose, a guardian
when it's a minor or somebody
who needs to have the the person
protected or a conservator who's
at risk of losing their life
savings because they've got some
irresponsible kids, that's the
kind of the typical deal, right?
If you have some kids who want,
who, who come over and they say,
Mom, dad, I'm gonna take over
your finances, and they get
themselves on the bank account
and they start spending some of
the money and it's gone, right?
That's where you try to avoid
that with the conservatorship.
So I think they're incredibly
use.
useful tools that I, I'm sure
it's worth of degree, not
minister, I do agree, and, and
in that circumstance, but again,
when you're dealing with
someone, you're working with
them, and they've got capacity
and you're putting together,
whether it's this or whether
it's the power of attorney.
That's when you want to have it
laid out in such a way that you
avoid someone else hauling you
in for a guardianship of
conservatorship. In other words,
again, when you're when you're
doing this and and and you're
right, and I've had all kinds of
cases where.
Especially in family situations,
Mr. Chair could um our expert
please respond.
Mr. George, just a quick
clarification that the amendment
doesn't add any language, it
just separates, um, the language
already in the bill into two
different sections because, uh,
Senator Du had made a good point
that they didn't necessarily
belong in the same section, so
we were just pulling them out.
We're not adding additional
language.
It's around by this, I don't
think so. If, if that's the
case, I'll, I'll receipt from
any objects of the adoption of
the amendment and find it
elsewhere, we'll still be back
to same concerns and issues I
have.
With a fundamental concept of
development. We're on the
amendment um any more discussion
on the amendment?
Just the amendments adopted them
without objection.
Sure, I think I still have the
floor.
So, Mr. Chair, uh, a lot of what
you're saying tonight is what I
said to Miss McCoy, uh,
previously, um,
Sometimes we need to have the
humility to know what we don't
know.
We don't know the, the
disability community.
Up here. We don't know.
What's best for them.
And I am trusting the people who
work with them.
That they do. Uh, so Senator
Sheer, I would, you know, we're,
we heard, oh well, why would,
why on earth would we say that,
uh, just because someone else
can help me make decisions
doesn't mean I, um, I can still
make my own. Uh
I'd love to know like how this
would work with your sister. Um,
one, how this bill overall would
work with someone like your
sister, but is there, I think, I
think it's very easy for us to
sit up here and say, well, that,
if, if I, if someator O'Malley
is helping me make decisions, of
course, everyone who comes after
is still gonna think, assume
that I know how to make my own
decisions. Uh.
For someone who is maybe
nonverbal, uh, for someone who
is dealing with uh profound
disabilities, they probably
don't.
Get that.
automatic assumption that they
can, they're, they still have
capacity. They can still make
their own decisions. And so I
would love to hear from people
who have more lived experience
in this than any of us up here
on this matter.
So, Mr. Chair and Senator, so
in, in the case of my sister and
I, I am her guardian.
But how this would work
supported decision making, and
this is how we work in real. So
we're gonna go into the bank,
uh, we're gonna open an account,
whatever it for her.
So I explain what's going on.
What the bank is gonna do, what
she needs to do, and at least in
this case, while I can make the
decision for her.
I want to include her and then
she says, yes, I want to do this
or I don't understand.
So it's a little different than
than this because I am her
guardian and I can do those if I
wanted to, but
If it were one of my parents.
Who used to make decisions for
me, but now they're in some kind
of decline. I can go in there
and I can say, hey dad, this is
what we're getting ready to do.
What do you want? or or this is
what we can do, what do you want
to do?
And because it's now supported,
I'm there to make sure that
nobody's taking advantage of
him.
But it's still his decision.
And I, and I think that's the
difference here, this supported
decision making. It's not me
making the decision.
He's still making the decision,
but I am there, and other people
in whatever transaction the
bank, the doctor's office,
wherever we are.
Now know that
I'm there to support him.
In in going through that,
whatever that is, um.
So I think that's the difference
here. This is a this is a
This is a step before
guardianship. This is a step
before somebody takes over.
They're still there, they're
still them.
They just need a little bit of
help.
Thank you, Mr. Sander, and, and
I think, you know, one of the
thoughts I had had about this
previously was
Well, can't you just do this
voluntarily?
You could, but then you wouldn't
have any of the protections.
That are built in here.
For, for that, the decision
maker who is being supported.
I also, I understand, I remember
from the time that I was on the
wings commission hearing
repeatedly that, uh, the power
of attorneys were not being
accepted, that someone would
execute a power of attorney, and
that banks notoriously refused
to accept them. So for someone
who, who can't still make their
own decisions, but need some of
that support.
They just do a power of
attorney, that's not necessarily
going to, to solve their
problems because they are, they
are not accepted. If, if they
can go in there, make the
decision themselves, with the
support of someone who also,
there are safeguards built in to
make sure that they're not going
to be taken advantage of by that
person as well.
I think that is a good thing.
Uh, but Mr. Chair, I, I hear
what you're saying. I, I said
the same things, um, repeatedly,
uh, but
We are, we've had a couple
conversations on this committee
and just in the last few days
about
But looking at your, uh, your
UPA bill.
Which
Looking at that through the lens
that we normally look at bills
in this committee.
There was just all sorts of
stuff that looked crazy to me.
Totally unnecessary, no good
reason for it to be there.
could not understand for the
life of me why, especially the
chair of this committee would
come in with a bill that had
that language.
And it turns out it's views in
there because there was stuff I
didn't know.
There was an interplay with
federal law that I didn't know
about. Did in fact made it
appropriate. Sometimes we need
to have the humility to know
what we don't know and trust the
people who are actually working
in these areas to, um, and, and
listen to their expertise. I
would urge folks to do that on
this bill.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and and
Senator Sher, thank you for
sharing the story, because um
when I look at this bill and
read it, Kathleen comes to mind.
She's completely capable of
making many decisions on her
own, but it's a guardrail to
make sure that she's not taken
advantage of by someone who
would um wish to maybe exploit
her disabilities in any way. Um,
it is funny, we're seeing this
bill that, do you know what Tu
is, Senator Sheer,
Representative, you know what Tu
is?
My wife definitely does. Oh my
goodness. I, I had a very
similar conversation about
supported decision making with
my mother this morning on the
phone because she has discovered
Timu, and I believe that my
power of attorney gives me the
right to remove that app from
her phone.
But you know what the difference
is she has daughters that are
coming in to help her with, with
some just supported decision
making. And in many cases, uh,
for some disabled, they don't.
And so I absolutely see this
guardrail. I am gonna tell her.
I included her by name in an
amendment in this bill today,
but I, I see the need and I, and
I will support it. Thank you.
Move to pass is amended.
Um, I, I, I take your, your read
between the lines that are doing
that sometimes we need humility,
um, and that's probably not
something that I'm oftentimes
accused of when, and I don't say
that to even, you know, compound
the issue more, but we also take
a note to do the best of our
ability, and sometimes the best
of my ability may be based on
more experience, more practice,
or my own experiences as a
litigator. Um, we don't, so for
example, we don't defer, at
least I do.
Entirely to doctors on medical
malpractice.
Um, some may argue that doctors
have superior knowledge when it
comes down to what should be
medical malpractice, and I, some
cases don't defer to doctors on
that issue.
We just heard like a, a, a
debate on gun laws and the
argument would be that law
enforcement should know better
than anyone what they should do
in terms of red flag laws, but
you all heard the history of
the, the police at the time,
uniformly said, we will not
enforce this law.
Uh, this is unconstitutional
and, and if we were deferring to
the experts because they're the
law enforcement should know
better. Um, we would have not
passed the red flag law 5 years
ago because they certainly know
better about how to do law
enforcement than I do, um, but I
passed it, um, and the overall
of their opposition.
Um, we, so we did body cameras
in here and all the police were
uniformly against the uh the
sheriff of Burley County was all
against body cameras.
Um, and if I was deferring to
their experience and expertise,
who would never paused past body
cameras. I can go on and on and
on many things that that we do,
where I think we, we have an
obligation to use our
experience, our skill set, and,
and God-given talents candidly
in some respects, so I can't, I
can't discount those. I have to,
I have to rely upon them. I'm
just, I'm trying to, I know
there's a lot of sympathy, um,
Senator, um, we love your
sister, of course, here and, and
I'm trying to make sure that we
don't do harm.
number one, and, and number 2,
I'm just really trying to figure
out what, what this does. You
gave the example of maybe
wanting to help your father and,
um, in that circumstances. My
guess is you did, you did
exactly that, right? Uh, if your
dad needed that help, you gave
him that help. And my guess is
you probably would not have
gotten a written agreement with
him to give you that that
support if you, your dad says
I'm, I'm a little slower, uh
like not reading this as
clearly. I could use your
device, son.
Uh, would you really go get a
written agreement to do that and
have it signed by witnesses and
and specify what's what all the
decisions that you're authorized
to assist them with and, and
list the decisions, which he's
not, um, which you're not
authorized to a system with,
which really, you really
practically you do all of that
with your dad?
So, Mr. Chair, for my dad, no.
But
My grandfather actually had a
similar situation like this.
So, uh, he lived in, in Roswell.
I lived in Farmington. Uh, my
father lived in Farming, so far,
far away.
But his neighbor actually helped
him.
He could live alone, he could
cook himself.
But there were times when his
neighbor
Actually helped him with various
things. Now, they didn't have a
written agreement with that.
But
The potential there was that
The neighbor wouldn't be allowed
in. The neighbor wouldn't be
allowed into the doctor's
office, so the neighbor wouldn't
be allowed to, to, uh, give
advice. Uh, and so this, this is
that step that allows my
grandfather's navy.
To help.
In a way that's recognized by
law.
So, but you're right, for my
father, no, I didn't need an
agreement.
Uh, for my sister, I absolutely,
on all of these things.
We'd say, OK, here's, here's
what the deal is, what do you
want to do?
Um
But in this case, I really am
the guardian, but I treat it as
if it's a supported decision
maker.
Well, I can't see non-relatives
being the people that are.
Uh
That are out there and there's
lots of non-relatives that are
helping.
I'm, I'm
s being non-relatives is what
you're saying, is that right?
And you said you gave the
example of your neighbor helping
your dad, right, do these things
and you said that he did it
without any kind of a written
agreement and without having
witnesses and notaries and and
all these things. I, I'm trying
to avoid doing harm, Senator
Representative, which is that we
pass a law that says, here's how
you do this, then will people
say, well, without doing these
things, you can't, your neighbor
can't do those things. And so
you gave the example you said
think somebody here said the
bank.
take a power of attorney.
If the bank won't take a power
of attorney, why would they take
a support agreement.
Um, in here and we're so we're,
they won't, um, well, the
difference so Mr. Chair, if I
may.
is the decision the decision
makers still the decision maker.
So a power of attorney means I
get to go in and do things for
my dad, whether he's there or
not, but in, in this case,
My dad is still there, and my
sister is still there, whoever
is still physically present and
gets to say yes or no.
I don't know that it says that,
um, I mean, it doesn't say you
have to be there present with
them physically in making the
decision she's there or or being
the support or having the
support but, but, um, yeah, a a
power of attorney um doesn't
have to do those things that
you're saying, you can say you
can get whatever power you want,
you can, and you can limit the
power anyway, which is exactly
what this does. This says if you
look here in the form of this
agreement says you to list the
decisions which the supporters
authorized to assist with and
then to list the decisions
they're not authorized to assist
with.
That's exactly what you do with
the power of attorney saying you
have the power of attorney to
This decision you have the power
to make my banking decisions,
but you don't have the power of
attorney attorney to make some
other decisions, um, I'm I'm
trying to make sure we don't do
harm and I'm and the harm to me
seems to be to formalize
something in law that we already
all do. Your neighbor does for
your dad, you do for your dad.
We all assist people who, uh, we
love and want to reach out for
assistance, and, and I don't
know that we need to have a
contract with all these
formalities.
to do that. Um, and, and maybe
you're gonna tell me, well, this
is just something else you can
do. You don't have to do this,
and I think that's probably
right, you don't have to do
this. But, but what is the value
gonna be in doing this. I'm
still very puzzled that you
can't do it already in the law.
Or or good sign
I think this is an option that
just makes it so that you can
have someone recognize to be
like an advisor to you and to um
someone for you to be able to
consult with.
And
have designated people with
different expertises that, you
know, maybe could help you with
financials or filling out, you
know, uh, for people with
disabilities, they have a lot of
paperwork that they have to fill
out. Someone who would just be
recognized as someone who could
help them with that, or someone
who could help them make health
care decisions or, you know,
that are um
You know, important in that way.
The person still gets to decide,
but they just have someone who
is going to advise them
recognized.
Um, again, I appreciate
everything you're trying to do
here represent like again I, I
think we all want the same and
the question is how you get
there. So again, when I'm, when
I'm concerned about uh doing the
hard section 5 says all decision
makers are presumed to have
capacity.
That's a huge a work thing,
yeah, that's, it's a huge shift
in the law, right? You're making
a presumption of capacity. We,
we, with a lack of capacity,
capacity is litigated all the
time, I think that was done.
Litigation over those kind of
claims and so you're making a
presumption they presume to have
capacity. That's, that's an
evidentiary determination,
that's a fact specific thing,
what, what did the, what did the
family members say? What did
they, what were they doing? How
would, how they appear in the
videos, how were they making
their decisions here, here,
you're gonna presume capacity
and capable of managing their
affairs unless otherwise
determined by a court.
That's a huge leap in the law.
You're gonna say bless the court
determines you to be.
Lacking capacity, we're gonna
presume you have capacity. I, I
think that would turn the base
of a lot of litigation that
takes place when again a typical
deal is the errors, and I, I
keep looking at this sort of
work because I think he does
these cases, so I
or we do
maybe not so much anymore, but
he did these cases and, and
they're pretty contentious,
right? And the kids come in and
they say, Mom and dad signed
this well, but mom didn't have
capacity.
Our dad didn't have capacity
when they cut out my brothers
and sisters, and they, they
didn't mean to do that and so I,
I should have a claim to the
estate even though they cut me
out because they didn't have
capacity and, and by this, this
the same the decision makers are
presumed to have capacity.
Even without regard to this act
or this bill or this agreement,
this just says that there are a
decision maker.
Um, they're presumed to have
that capacity and capable of
managing their affairs unless
determined by a cord, and, and
work sometimes not able to make
that determination because they
may be gone, they may be dead.
Um, sadly.
Um
And, and then it goes on to say
a diagnosis of mental illness.
does not avoid, does not void
the presumption of capacity.
The diagnosis of an intellectual
disability does not void the
presumption of capacity, the
diagnosis of developmental
disability does not void the
presumption of capacity in and
of itself. I realize that's the
language in there to be.
Mr. Joking.
We let the expert address this.
Mr. Chair, thank you for the
question. Um,
So the bigger goal, of course,
of this uh law is to address the
social issues that happen out in
the world, which is that, you
know, people just think about
people with disabilities is
default, not having capacity.
The reason we want to put it
into this law is because it is
already in our New Mexico laws
guardianship law says there's a
presumption of capacity, um, the
health care decisions making act
says it's a presumption of
capacity. And so for those
processes, which are even more
restrictive than this one, where
we're taking, you know, rights
away from people, decision
making rights, they already have
and presumption of capacity in
those contexts. So we wanted to
be very clear.
In this law as well that the
presumption of capacity, we, we
start with that.
I hope that answers your
question, Mr. Chair.
Well, that would be new to me,
something I don't know and I'm
always the first one to admit
when I don't know something, so
you're telling me that in a
guardianship or conservatorship
proceeding, there's a
presumption the person has
capacity until there's a
determination by court,
otherwise, and that's the whole
point of having a guardianship
and conservatorship proceeding,
isn't it? I meaning you file a
petition to you you don't have a
guardianship until there's a
guardian appointed or
guardianship appointed, so I
understand why you'd have the
presumption of capacity until
the court until the court
determines.
Otherwise
Um, and
Maybe that's, maybe that's
Not gonna cause issues here. Um,
I, I probably foresee that it
will, but um.
Again, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm not
gonna try and occupy the
committee all night long on
this. I, I think, uh, I think
there's a good, there's some
good stuff in the amendment. I
think one of the things the
amendment is a really good thing
is
Uh, paragraph 6, which strikes
lines 19 through 21.
And I'm glad you're doing that
over here on the Senate side,
that, that section.
says that the supporter is not a
fiduciary agent of the decision
maker, I think he was struck
that Senator Duke, and that's
good, but that's because you're,
we, they may be a fiduciary
The decision maker. And so to
say they're not, I think is a is
a good catch there. I would, I
would have wanted to strike that
on my own.
Um
Yeah, I just, uh, I'll listen to
see if there's any more debate,
but I, I, I would be very
cautious here, Senator
Representative. I really would
be very, very cautious. I, I
appreciate what you're trying to
do. I appreciate the people who
want to help and do good things,
but you, you are stepping over
pretty big body of law when it
comes to power of attorney,
guardianship and conservatorship
and probate proceedings
generally, so
Senator we just one thing that I
that concerns me. I mean, if
this moves forward, maybe
there's a way to address this. I
am worried that people will sign
this document and not get a
power.
our attorney.
And if they do that, then then
they're forced into a
guardianship conservatorship
situation. So what
What's, what protection is there
in here? Is there something,
because I, I can see what you're
trying to do, and I, I, I like
that part of it, but I also
think you really need to make
sure you've gone through basic
state planning, and you've got a
basic so so easy to do a simple
power of attorney and a simple
health care authority, because
at some point, people with these
documents are not going to have
capacity.
And I just think if you've got
the other documents in place,
you avoid a massive amount of
litigation and guardianship
conservatorship situations
where, where you've not created
a document, and I, I don't.
I think this document would be
Evidence of a presumption that
that person named in here would
be serve in that capacity, so
You just address that, maybe
there's a way to put some
language in here if this moves
forward, that would do that
because that's the piece that
really worries me, having just
seen what happens when clients
come to me and someone has in a
situation where they haven't
done the documents, and they've
got to go through the
guardianship conservatorship
process, which even if it's
uncontested is.
Complicated and multiple
appointments and it's, and we
changed that law a number of
years ago and made it much more
complicated. Uh, I don't do
those anymore. So anyway, just a
thought, maybe you've got a
response to that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairleader
Worth. That is a good point. Um,
this kind of document, this kind
of system, this process takes
into account that it is a bigger
picture for you to think through
who your supporters are going to
be and ultimately do that what
we call future planning and the
disability community where we
bring in the other documents
already in the law, such as
powers of attorney, the
healthcare decisions
decisionmaking Act brings in uh
medical powers of attorney.
There are also psychiatric
Mental health powers of attorney
and so there are many different
documents out there that can
work in conjunction with this
and should work in conjunction
with this, uh, we didn't put it
in this particular law because
again that's, you know, those
pieces are already out there and
already um laid out in the law,
but it is designed and the
processes that have been
practiced around the nation.
This is how people do it, you
know, they use this as a bigger
picture way to plan what your
support looks like to
Choose all the people a living
document, you know, as you, as
your situation changes, your
supporters may change, but
ultimately it will be used in
conjunction with some of these
other prevent uh preventive,
preventative documents that keep
you out of guardianship, and
that's good to state planning is
basically what it is. Yeah, Mr.
Cha, I appreciate that. I, I do
think it would help to have
something in this actual law
that
Just put something that
recognizes that when you've made
this decision, part of the just
requiring that discussion to
happen.
Cause I'm worried that, you
know, that folks that
I don't know whether, is there
gonna be a forum to do this? I
mean, it's
Is this, are you gonna need to
go get lawyers to do this.
Mr. Chair Leaderworth out, so
the
The law also establishes a
program with the Office of
guardianship. We're gonna, you
know, we're calling this the
alternatives to guardianship
program, and we're already
working with people on powers of
attorney and other such
documents, um, we
You know, we do have formed this
uh law was developed through a
task force, um, which was funded
by Representative Fury, um,
through a junior bill, and, uh,
you know, we included um a broad
variety of stakeholders,
including uh Judge B. Sche,
which I believe is a former law
partner and he was very
instrumental in uh he and all of
the members are very
instrumental in
Creating this law, looking at
what New Mexico needs looking at
how it interacts with New Mexico
law as well, and so, uh, we do
have a task force report in the
task force report, there is a
form, a proposed form, and if
this bill passes and the officer
guardianship program is
established, that form will be
used as we educate the public
about how did you support
decision making in New Mexico.
Great. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mhm. Before I go back again,
we're looking for hands, so I,
I, I would just also uh refer us
to section 11 on page 7.
as a decision or request made
communicate with the assistance
of a supporter in conformity
shall be recognized for any
purposes or any provision of the
law, as the decision request of
the decision maker, that's very
dangerous. Um,
Because this is like a decision
or request made or communicated
with the assistance of his
support, the example is, again,
Sent to your example, your your
father, let's say your father
last capacity,
um, and, and you take him into
the bank, and you tell them you
want to clean out his account
and you're with him and, and
you've got this agreement.
This is gonna just gonna say
this is that
that can be recognized by the
law, um, for any decision or
request as, as your dad's, if
you have this agreement and, and
you're, you're going there with
your dad and you and you tell
the bank, my dad must take out
all his money. This, this
section I I'm reading it right,
says, says that the court under
the law is going to say that was
your dad's decision because you
were there with him.
Um, and that, that, that's
sometimes a pretty classic
example of undue influence,
right? Again, not to, not to
the line you or your dad, but
let's say you've got uh I've got
brothers and sisters and I, I
get my dad on a good day and I
take him out to the baseball
game and the movies, taking him
to dinner and had a really great
day together and say, hey, let's
go to the bank. Um, and I'm with
him, and by this language, if
I'm with him and he says I want
to clean all of my money and
give it to this guy, this son,
this is gonna, this is gonna
say, it's gonna say a decision
or request made, uh, shall be
recognized uh of any provision
of law as a decision.
Because of my dad, right, by
by this language and that and
that could be that, that could
be very dangerous as well too.
I'm concerned.
Um, you'll probably recognize I,
I have some real uh significant
concerns about this, but I again
I.
label this. I, I gotta tell you
from where I'm at right now and
the bill passes, I would tell
you.
I would all the folks out here
who are working really, really
hard in this area. Um, I would
tell you not to sign these
agreements and, and get a true
power train and there's a reason
why we have a power of attorney
form in our statute, we almost
never put forms in our statutes.
Almost never do, almost always a
bad idea to put it for me, but
there is, there's a reason why
we have a power of attorney form
in our statutes because we want
it so uniform.
We want, we want every bank who
sees this power to see have seen
the same form and, and they've
been trained at the bank, hey,
this is what a power of attorney
looks like in New Mexico. This
is a legal form that has been
adopted by the legislature. If
you see this form, accept it
because it's been passed and
blessed. And so that's why we go
to the extraordinary level of
putting actually a form in our
statutes so that everybody will
as same degree this met the
requirements when we see this,
good to go. Um, and this doesn't
do anything like that. This is
gonna
every one of these agreements
could be whatever form of
contract. So it's essentially a
contract. All it really says
it's got to be in writing and
sign and so forth notarized, but
every one of these is gonna be
completely different.
Uh, we won't have a form, and so
I think you're gonna find no
banks or any authorities that
going to take that written
agreement for any purpose, I,
I'm really shocked if they, if
they do so.
It's essentially be essentially
Interpreting the contract on the
spot with whoever's doing it, so
I, again, just um um host of
concerns. I know the hour is
late and we haven't had anything
to eat, so send, I'll, I'll let
you finish up in any of the last
uh committee members and then
we'll, we'll get to the Du pass
motion.
So
Mr. Cha, I, I
I understand some of the
concerns here, but I think that,
uh, what we're really getting at
is, uh, first of all, about half
of the states in the union
already do this. So this isn't
new.
OK, uh, in this was, this was
done in collaboration with the
American Bar Association
Commission on Law and Aging.
And is odd as this might sound.
Mr. Chair, Attorneys.
generally disagree with me on
everything.
Supported this
Um
So, this isn't new.
The the presumption, I, I, I
think you got the
Kind of backwards with the
presumption of capacity. We're
presuming that they have
capacity. It, it's after, after.
The court says you don't have
it. So we presume right now you
have capacity.
Oh
So, when it comes to, to levels
of disability.
So my sister can make an awful
lot of decisions by herself.
There are some things that I
would not want her to make a
decision on. I don't want her to
drive.
Because I saw her wreck.
the golf cart.
So
Uh, that's, that's where I would
have
Uh, you know, step in and say,
hey, let's not do this. But when
it comes to uh other things,
absolutely.
So this is, this is an aid,
it's, that's in there for people
that can make decisions.
And in some cases, these are
Uh, not Down syndrome, but, but
maybe um
Uh, somewhere on the spectrum of
ADHD. You do almost everything.
Including drive, but every once
in a while you need somebody to
say,
Here's what's going on.
What would you like to do?
And uh, so that's what this is,
that's that simple step. And
again, this isn't brand new,
this is
Half the states in the union are
already doing this.
So with that,
But could you, could you just
give me one or two of the states
that you modeled this on. What,
what is this modeled after which
state?
Mr. Chair, uh, we studied at the
time 17 different states and I
can't quite remember what all 17
states were anymore, um, it
looks
different in every state, and we
developed the one that we
thought would be most
appropriate for New Mexico, so
we did pull from multiple
states, ideas that we liked and
pieces that we liked, so this
was just in New Mexico law.
And I appreciate that. That's
logical approach to a lot of
weight loss or maybe they could
choose some other states, but
sometimes when you put all the
pieces to the puzzle, you don't
get the, the picture you thought
you were going to from different
places and so when I just wanted
to understand what Senator Scher
says. This is not you, 17 states
do this, um, in concept,
perhaps, right, in concept may
they be very well, but we're
dealing with words on the page
here. I'm trying to figure out
whether these words on the page
have been got application and
history and how it's worked in
other states, and so.
I'm guessing you're telling me I
wouldn't go find this, this law
of some other state, is that
right?
That's right, Mr. Chair, and uh
the, the task force did work on
this and I, I think fiscal year
of 21 or 22, and so it's been um
A while since the task force
looked at it, but since then,
29, 27 when we made the uh the
one pager uh states and the
District of Columbia have uh
enacted a supported decision
making.
Thank you.
We've probably exhausted the
topics, so, uh, we had to do
pass motion. We'll take that by
roll call, please.
Yes.
Yes.
And it.
Thornton.
Yes.
to work.
Yes.
er No, yeah we do pass. Thank
you. I, I've been looking for
center uh Gallegos I haven't
seen her.
Uh, we'll roll that over to our
next meeting,
so,
00, my nurses come on over. All
right, I'm sorry. I've, I've
been looking all night for
center reps and gag,
Mr. Chair, the most important
thing for tonight is Logan won
the 18 uh.
Boys' championship, uh, they
beat Monroe uh 56 to 44.
All right.
Did mean to get your heart
racing, center.
How
But we can get you some
assistance and support.
OK, so with me today, um, on
this bill, the nursing Practice
Act I have my expert witness,
Doctor Gloria Doherty. She's a
nurse practitioner. She is a PhD
in the area. Uh, we do have an
amendment that your committee
asked for and it is fine with
us. Um, so I can either do the
amendment first or explain the
bill.
Uh, let's do the, let's see what
we got in that.
Let's, that looks like a pretty
substantial couple of
amendments. So why don't you
explain the bill generally and
then we'll get to the, OK, the
amendment I have is very short.
It's 0.231999.1.
I'm not putting it in context
yet, but I see your striking
lines 9 through 25, uh, that,
that looks like a big to explain
the bill
and then you and then you're
that said let's see you're
moving the brackets.
And let me just make sure and
then on the 3rd paragraph, the
brackets of wind through.
strike, that's pretty minor too,
so it, it may be minor, but
let's just, let's hear the bill
and then we'll get to the,
uh, the nur nursing Practice Act
provides updates to an existing
act. Oh, you want me to stop?
So we've got a number of
individuals who signed to speak
in support, and I want to know
whether they're within your
presentation.
Uh, center, because if that's
the case, we'll give you
unlimited amount of time with
them, right? Well, well, I
should say, we'll, we'll give
you 15 minutes, but every one of
them will be part of your 15
minutes. You can use that you
want is what I'm will be 1.5
minutes and then Doctor Sheena
Ferguson is online. She's the
director of the board of
nursing, as I mentioned, my
expert witnesses here, and
there's 4 or 5 other people
here.
Right,
just so you know, I have Jason
Bloomer.
Brunner and Debbie Chrisssinger.
no also
Lisa Lady
Naja, Deborah Walker, Sandra
Boor and Shawna Reid and
That support, um, do we have, we
have no opposition, so I simply
wanted to start the presentation
with free to recognize we don't
have any anybody signed up in
opposition, right?
That's correct.
Um, so I have Jared Carey, uh,
Siri, Debra, and uh Shawna, and
then the doctor Ferguson, that's
all.
So, uh, this provides updates to
nursing Practice Act, it brings
consistency and language and
addresses outdated terminology.
It allows the board of nursing
to assist in recruitment and
retention of nurses through a
maintaining a system for
clinical placement assistance,
it provides a choice for single
or multi-state licensure.
The bill waives the initial
licensure fee for New Mexico
school nursing graduates and
creates a license category for
inactive reserves and retired
nurses.
Additionally, the board of
nursing will own its own data,
and if necessary, can raise
license renewal fees.
It also alleviates the
administrative burden of
advanced practice registered
nurses submitting formularies
that are outdated at time of
submission and are not reviewed.
This bill provides public safety
measures for registered nurses
administering sedation as
ordered by a physician or other
provider.
These safety measures include
additional training as a
prerequisite, and the necessity
of an airway specialist being
immediately available as
promulgated in the rules.
Definitions are added for
different types of sedation and
anesthesia. There are
approximately 18,000 registered
nurses licensed in our state
from the 2024 Healthcare
Workforce report.
Currently there are close to
7700 openings for registered
nurses.
This legislation was developed
during the interim with
legislators and the broad
nursing community, all the
medical associations are
supporting this bill. I did
introduce my expert, and I'll
ask her to say something for a
minute.
Thank you, Mr. Chair members of
the committee, I do not have
anything further. She covered it
all unless you have technical
questions when we get there, but
we did have several people who
we lost because most nurses work
7 to 7 and we had night
shifters.
So there are people in the
audience and uh a few online.
Uh, we had Jared, um, I think
you have the list there.
All right, thank you. So we'll
go up, I guess the combination
of online and in in the room.
Why don't we go in the room
first. Um, we have a Jason
Bloomer, Carrie Brunner, Debbie
Chrissinger, Serraruna Kalsa,
Lisa Bedding, Jared Najar,
Deborah Walker.
Sandra Boar and um Chana Reed.
So go ahead and introduce
yourself to your name. Thank
you, everyone has a a little
over one minute. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, members of the
committee, Jared Najar on behalf
of the New Mexico Society of
Anesthesiologists and Loveless
Health plan. Um, we want to
thank the sponsor for bringing
this bill forward and thank the
sponsor and the expert for
working with us early on in the
process and addressing our
concerns, and we stand in strong
support.
Mr. Chair and committee members,
um, thank you for your time and
consideration for this bill. My
name is Siri Guru Namkar Khalsa.
I've worked as both a clinical
Nurse for 39 years in northern
New Mexico and a nurse educator
for 7, 17 of those years, and
I'm in I'm hoping you'll support
this bill. Thank you.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee. I'm Deborah Walker, a
registered nurse, and the
executive director of the New
Mexico Nurses Association. The
bill before you as the senator
encapsulated is also reflective
of work during the interim, uh,
across the state, across all
practice areas for nurses and
It is needed updates.
Uh, when Senator Stephanics
mentioned updates on
nomenclature, this.
Comports with uh nomenclature
across the country. The bill
also is reflective of some of
the concerns that were raised by
members of this committee 2
years ago.
Um, we believe as an association
that um the bill provides
parameters that um protects the
nurse's career.
Their practices as well as
quality, uh, care for our
patients, and safe.
Care for our patients, and we
are hopeful that you'll be able
to pass it out this evening.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much and there's
folks on Zoom. Why don't you go
to now?
call them, uh, as they
They appear.
Unmute them and then go ahead
and introduce yourselves.
Everyone has about a minute or
so.
Hello,
hello, Mr. Chairman, members of
the committee, Carrie Robin
Brunner, representing the New
Mexico Medical Society, uh, the
nurses have worked very
carefully with the medical
society over the last two years
since the introduction of this
bill in 2023. It has been
carefully crafted to really
reflect all of the work that our
nurses are doing in partnership,
um, and under the orders of
physicians in our hospitals and
in our clinics. We think it's an
important piece of legislation
for you to pass this evening as
it
really is going to reflect the
practice that nurses need to be
doing and are rightfully doing
within the medical framework and
uh we very much appreciate the
sponsor and the committee's
time. Thank you so much, Mr.
Chairman.
Thank you.
Bye.
But it,
can you hear me?
Mr. sorry.
We can hear you, please, please,
uh, uh, you're recognized
homeowners.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee. My name is
Jason Blumer. I'm the vice
president of the New Mexico
Nurses Association. I'm a
critical care. I.
is that are we're currently
engaged in, uh, with
evidence-based practice
physician colleagues, and it is
important and imperative that we
continue to be able to provide
the same level of care that we
are so we can continue to
advance our practice. Uh, thank
you again for your time and
opportunity to speak. Again, I
stand in support of this bill,
and she's from Hobbs.
misread your're recognized.
Good evening, chairman and
senators. My name is Shawna Reid
and I am the president-elect for
the New Mexico nurse
practitioner counsel. We are the
only statewide nurse
practitioner organization here
in New Mexico. House Bill 178
provides consistency in the
language for the nurse Practice
Act and is also providing some
clarifying language, specific to
nurse practitioners, this would
remove the antiquated formulary
requirement that has been a law
for many years.
and we are no longer utilizing
to the full potential, as you
know, the FDA releases
significant amounts of drug
approvals each and every year,
and this has just become
antiquated uh for our practice.
This would also allow the board
of nursing to recruit and retain
licensees in our state, and as
you are all aware, we are a
provider shortage area, and we
would like to recruit and retain
more providers in the state. We
wouldn't and also like for the
board of nursing to maintain
their own
data so that we have accurate
labor statistics for recruitment
purposes, as far as the nursing
profession goes, and I would
urge each and every one of you
to support House Bill 178
tonight. Thank you so much.
Um, Doctor Sheena Ferguson
should be on Zoom, but she's
from the board of nursing and
she is only technical assistant.
Please introduce yourself if you
wish to address the committee
this is not Dean, I believe that
uh you might have thought it was
someone different, but I support
the bill. It's very exciting to
see such a wonderful group of
supporters in the room,
especially Doctor Siri Gurunaar
calls the PhD. Thank you so
much. Thanks for joining us.
All right, thank you. Those are
the folks who spoke in favor.
There was a couple of folks who
had to go to work, uh, we
appreciate them staying as long
as they did. Is there anyone in
opposition?
Uh, to spill 178. Anyone wish to
address the committee in
opposition, members of the
committee.
Uh, Mr. Chair, um, thank you for
bringing this forward. I know
there's a lot of work that went
into this.
Uh, going through the bill,
like,
found an area on page, I guess
it's under the disciplinary
proceedings process, uh, page
23.
So you go through with the
disciplinary processes and, and
then I get to
page, I guess, no, page 26 where
it has
H and you get and what you have
is you have definitions in
there.
Section 8 of, it's on page 26.
And so all the, all the things
that are definitions, which I
believe probably should be in
your section one.
And so I would recommend
Um, because everything else here
is disciplinary process, unless
this has been changed from what
I have in front of me, um, it
wasn't changed in the.
And the amendments, even I went
through the amendments as well.
So you still missed it in your
amendment. And so, I would add
or suggest that maybe you take
the definitions that you're
utilizing and I guess line 17 to
the end of till you get to
section 12 and move that into
Into the definitions, does that
make sense based on what I'm
reading here?
Or they don't sound like
disciplinary actions. So, uh,
Mr. Chair and Senator are
Mr. Chair, um, Senator Thornton,
members of the committee, um,
this area was actually a part of
it insert into all of the
medical practice acts several
years back.
And it came as its own
component.
And got inserted into the
medical practice Act, the PA
Practice Act. This isn't um
The definitions, if they were at
the front of the act wouldn't
pertain to anything in the act
except this part.
Oh, Mr. Chair, Senator, uh, I
recognize that, but when you
read them, they're, they aren't
part of the disciplinary action
section, which is Section 11.
And so
So I, I, it, that's why it
caught my eye because I thought
I was going through it I go with
that, those aren't it we do have
a.
Mr. Chair and Senator Thornton
also the nursing compact,
everything has to be separated,
the interstate nursing
registered nurse compact, um,
has to be separate from this as
well.
Oh thank you, I.
I, I understand that, um.
That way we can maybe correct
uh.
statue there because it seems
like it's impropriate placed,
but other than that, I, I, I
agree with the, what you guys
are attempting to do. Thank you.
members of the committee center
everybody.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you, Senator Stephanics
for bringing this forward as the
daughter of a nurse. My, my
mother retired from Memorial
Medical Center, and then went on
to be a school nurse in Gadsden,
who was a champion for
school-based health clinics for
a number of times were found, I
really like the part in here
where we're allowing for retired
nurses to come assist in state
of emergencies. I think that's
imperative when, when there's a
need and there's people that are
right there and available to
offer help to allow that
inclusion. So this doesn't seem
like too
of the changes, and I appreciate
your experts who are out here
championing this forward and
more than anything, thank you
for all you nurses and
healthcare providers and doctors
that, you know, have a harder
service for New Mexico and all
you do, so I'm happy to champion
this forward.
Thank you so much, Senator
Worth. I would move the
amendment 0.23199.
1999.1.
And you explained the amendment
in your intro, or do you want?
If you could, yeah, just did not
explain the uh the amendment was
given to um me from the
committee. I'm not sure where,
uh, Richie originated from, but
on page 25, and it's we're
accepting it, it's fine. On page
25, line 9.
At C strike all.
Of that page.
Uh, from that line down to the
bottom, the first line of page
26.
And then online 5, there's some
technical renumbering, and
that's all. Thank you. And we
had moved for discussion
telepathically or any discussion
on the amendment. Any objection
to the amendment?
Did you, uh, objection you want
to discuss?
Oh
Oh, I understand. All right,
please note, please raise your
hand if you object to the event.
All right, please note all those
uh not raising aren't in favor
to have an amended bill.
We're back on the bill, members
of the community.
Mr. Chair, just 111 comment, uh,
you know, when you see the scope
of practice bills. I was
immediately
Default to not moving forward
until I hear, you know, that
you've built the consensus and
you get the medical board and
you've got all of that on board,
and once that happens,
I just feel like
Again, trying for as late, this
is, I'm sure you, you guys feel
like this is the law stuff on
the medicine stuff, I'm like,
uh, you know, this gets into the
weeds and again, when everyone's
worked it out, that's exactly
when we should move forward. So
I'm very comfortable with this
and I appreciate, you know, and
it took a couple of years to get
there, which shows that
That process happened.
So I, I'm move do pass. Thank
you, Senator, and just a quick
the uh.
No, the scope of practice, uh,
bills are tough, tough, tough
stuff for us, and we appreciate
the profession, the medical
profession.
Looking at the realities on the
ground here in the city of
Mexico and trying and everyone,
if everyone gives an inch, we
all, we all can move forward a
mile. So we're really
appreciative of the leadership
of all those involved in this
decision making. Uh, we have a
motion for a due pass as
amended. Any further discussion?
But most people do passes a
minute any objection to that do
pass motion.
none up, you have a do pass
amended.
Thank you very much. Thank you
very much Mrs.
So we, uh to be uh be in touch.
We're gonna be in that one on
the floor, doesn't look like
we're gonna meet as a committee
tomorrow, but I'll be ready to
