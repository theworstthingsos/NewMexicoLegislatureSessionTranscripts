Presbyterian healthcare plan
network if they were if we were
to purchase insurance from them
they would charge us to assume
that risk of any of the cost
overruns usually about fifteen
at least fifteen percent.
In this so but I'm gonna say it
anyway what the hell.
Madam chair.
We go when we talk about a
fifteen percent savings.
Because we don't pay an overhead
charge we still guided minister
this plan and isn't that fifteen
percent third ministration cost
to the plan yes the
administrative costs to provide
to their network instead of
fifteen percent around five
percent which usually.
So the state is buying the same
network of service providers the
same billing and claims
processing as if we were to buy
a fully insured programs we're
just not shifting the risk to
that Presbyterian healthcare
plan for so the question I have
with that madam chair and
Charles is this.
Do we.
Reinsurer.
Any of this to keep our
liability down on Mr chair
Senator I'm not sure if GST has
any reinsurance I know PSA in
the risk side has some
reinsurance that is something
that as a cost saving measure we
should look at
for the self insured plans when
you get a super high claims
costs that that would be a an
area to look at because a pretty
good portion of the health care
spending in these plans is for a
very small number of high cost
individuals and that's where you
can help bring down some of
those costs through right that's
exactly what I'm saying that
there are some of these
treatments that cost.
That that we're all the cost is
correct where is the the lower
end of the cost or pretty
nonexistent manner manner that
saving.
and and I guess I'm just asking
are we exploring all of this and
and madam chair are we are we
are a hundred percent in the
game.
A hundred percent.
What what.
What causes my action today
madam chair and and Charles is
that the governor made a
statement about universal health
care to all.
And if we are going to get in
this game with that degree.
We got the expertise to even do
that I mean we're we're we're
struggling right here and and
you yourself made statements
that maybe we should look at
other things.
I worry terribly.
With the expertise that we're
trying to promote.
You know we just got to talking
about the the employees that we
don't have the expertise we
don't have and I'm I'm beating a
dead horse strokes opponent
judge to that madam chair Mr
chair Senator we've got about a
decade's worth of LFC
evaluations looking at these
self insured plans and found
that they're not actively
managing controlling cost it's
more of a cost shifting between
what the employee and employers
pay an out of pocket costs but
in terms of actively managing
the cost to try to make it less
expensive overall there's not
been a concerted effort and
we're to the point that one of
these plans is insolvent it's
spending money it doesn't have
any other plan is heading in
that direction actuarially it's
and I heard somebody call an
actuarial does spiral that yes
it's basically an.
I have no more questions thank
you for your attention.
