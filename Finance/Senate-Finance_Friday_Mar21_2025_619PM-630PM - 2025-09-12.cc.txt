That the amendment is 231995.3.
And what this does what the bill
does and then we can adopt the
amendment to the bill, OK what
the bill is it's the trade trade
tradeport Act and what it does
that is a proactive response to
the global economics changes.
Uh, to res and what it does is
we use existing infrastructure
in the development of trade
courts, rail.
Highway airports. Thank you.
And because in best practices
with economic development, it's
generally asset-based, and
that's what we're doing with
this bill.
Uh, we're trying to make New
Mexico more than just a bridge
state where people travel
through it, but we actually
position our state for increase
with trade.
Reshoring, onshoring, and
possibly help to eliminate
supply chain disruption.
The spill is set up in the
economic development department,
oversight management would be by
the Secretary of Economic
Development.
With an advisory committee that
helps in identify identification
of trade port boundaries and
trade for projects, a unique
feature to this, Mr. Chairman
and committee is the P3 section.
That is an incentive for
development, development.

And what the amendment does, Mr.

The parameters for
public-private partnerships. It
allows for the Board of Finance
to provide an overview.
It provides that every P3
project.
Uh, present benchmarks and
deliverables before any money is
exchanged. It allows for the AG

year, and this 2 years is pretty
long, you know, um, Mr. Chairman

years just because.
