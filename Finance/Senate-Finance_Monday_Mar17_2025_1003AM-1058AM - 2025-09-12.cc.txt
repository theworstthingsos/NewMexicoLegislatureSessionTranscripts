But
This is the time that we're

OK, this is for Senate Bill 107
that you're asking me
107.
Stem center of excellence.
Mr. Turner is there was money
left HAFC. It was 3 million in
the budget. I don't know where
it stands now.
Uh, well, if there's money in
the budget.
And there still remains money in
the budget.
The Bill Gates tabled.
There's no need to chase the
bill to the floor, the money's
in the budget.
Unless there's a statutory
change that has to happen.
And there's money there.
Um
So I moved the table. Senate
Bill 107.
Did you want to explain it
first, Representative creates a
STEM innovation network.
By establishing a center of
excellence for STEM at NMSU
creates a steering wheel, sets
up a structure statewide, um, to
support.
Uh, STEM education across the
state.
OK. Questions from committee
members, the money's in the
budget, it remains in the
budget.
There's no need for the bill.
I just wanted to see you today.
Did you bring us any flowers?
I suggest that you come back to
this committee, you bring some.
Roses for Senator Trujil
I don't want to make my wife
jealous.
I, I will tell you this story
in, in, it wasn't funny to my
wife, but somebody who was
supporting the bill sent me
flowers for Christmas.
And uh it was illegal and they
came and then put them in the
But I in the living room or on
the table, right? And she says,
who's this lady? And I'm like,
well, she's an advocate, right?
Well then she sent another set
of flowers.
And then I told the flower guy.
You brought him to my office. I
said, do not bring another set
of flowers from that woman ever
again.
Take them to the Little Sisters
of the Poor where they're the
elderly that are dying, right?
And my wife and the secretaries
ran out and caught the flower
guy and wanted to know who they
were from.
Or was I in trouble for
something I never did.
So you represented Tree Hills
and flowers. Thank you.
Senator Brent 116.
Uh
Math lab. It's up to you and, I
would present it so they
understand what we're headed.
I'm, I'm gonna present it from
here if you don't mind.
Uh, the, the math labs is a is
actually a program that I funded
with junior money in Rio Rancho
Public schools, um, last, well,
grow money, sorry, one junior
wrote money last year, uh,
it's a really a great program
that
All the kids rotate in K through
5.
Um, and they basically get in
there one day a week and when I
went in and uh
Watched them and and really kind
of looked at what the program
was doing. I've never been in a
classroom where all the kids
loved math.
So I went and met with 5th
graders and my, my question was,
how many of you really love math
in here and all of them raised
their hand.
And so this was just the program
that really teaches kids that
math doesn't have to be
difficult. It kind of gets him
over that.
A lot of us have a blockage when
it comes to math and this really
helps kids get past those
barriers and so this lab
program, I would like to see it
go a little further in a study
it. So when we put the funding
in for up to 30 labs for the
state, um, it's cost $100,000
per lab. That's for the teacher
and, and just a few items that
go in the classroom.
Uh, but it's a great program,
uh, this should pay for us to do
about 30 of them and see how it
works over the next couple of
years and then
You know, hopefully it works as
good as it's working your rear
end and we extend it throughout
the state.
It
Yes ma'am. We have a table in
motion.
Any objection to the tabling
motion. I'll just call him offen
composs.
Got it.
And everybody in the room, OK.
She's gonna be yelling at me
next if I don't slow down.
That's 116.
Senator Armijo is not in the
room.
You may have a motion on the
center Armijo's bill.
moved the table and table motion
on Senate Bill 198 as amended.
Oh
We already tabled your bill.
Explain it to us uh we just
explained to everybody, bills
that are in the budget get
tabled and Senate Finance right
now. I wanted to clear some
bills off my bucket list cause I
had a whole lot of them and I
need to clear some up.
Itinerary or mijo tell us about
infant toddler funding.
Sure. Give me one second, Mr.
You can stay there and do
Senator Stewarts too, too, Mr.
Chairman Senate Bill 198 makes
an appropriation.
Recurrent FY 25 supplemental to
reinstate provider rate
increases to the family, infant
and toddler, whereas we best
know with the FIT program in
early childhood education and
care department.
The fit program operates in
accordance with the requirements
of the federal individuals with
disabilities Education Act.
You see ECD is the lead agency
for the FIP program, which is
responsible for identifying and
providing early intervention
services to children with
developmental delays on
disabilities or are at risk of
developmental delays or
disabilities. Each year, Mr.
Chairman, the FIT program
provides services to more than
14,000 children birth to age 3
and their families. Here's what
happened in FY 25 staff executed
a rate increase for providers
and communicates the increased
provider agency.
Provider agencies planned on
that increased revenue in their
FY 25 budgets used for providing
wages increases and other
changes to their options.
Due to some miscommunication in
the ECEC DC those rates were
rescinded.
And the rates were reimbursed
only from July 1st through
August 18th.
This bill requests funding to
reinstate those rates advocated
to January 2025 to reimburse
providers for the 3rd and 4th
quarters of F.
OK. Questions from committee
members see no more on the table
in motion.
The trail.
OK.
When she moves in a trail moved
the table, like my rent, any
objection to the tabling motion.
Seem none.
Money's in the budget.
Which is in the budget,
whichever one it is, Senator
stay right there, we're gonna
have you do houseenate Bill 237.
MLB commission activities.
That's your explanation right
there.
OK.
We have emotion.
Move the table table in motion
by center, second by center
Trejil. Any objection to that?
Your next bill, Senator, is
youth behavioral Health
Prevention Projects.
You need to look it up.
We're gonna save you some time.
We just need yours. We just need
your good soul sitting at the
chair as the title
We're gonna save you some time.

Bran.
Mr. Chair, we'll be letting
Senator Hami, we'll be letting
all of these sponsors know that
you have got their bills tabled
today.
So
Make, make yourself comfortable.
ready for it.
Uh, I think, or you and Senator
Tobias and the next one. Senator
Tobias and you want to, you
better get up there and present
this bill to us.
Maybe you won't table this one,
maybe we'll kill it.
Mm
Thank you, Mr. Chair and Senate
Bill 300 as amended.
That's what we're on with him.
So
We are number one in adult
illiteracy in the US and we
currently spend $750,000 a year
on adult literacy statewide. So
this bill actually appropriates
$10 million over the next three
years, because we're currently
serving less than 1% of our
adult illiterate population.
So I've been working with Doctor
Amber Gallop who's over the
program statewide, and they are
ready to bolster the program
with this funding.
OK,
I mean, you have that?
Sure.

Of 83,000.
And which would be a big.
According to um
This kind of a program for the

Good morning. Good morning.
Yes, good morning, um, Mr.
Chairman and senators, the bill
that, that is before you helps
continue the funding for this
project where we already have
$2.5 million invested in the
project, we have 100%
construction documents and are
ready to break ground as soon as
we are able to complete the
funding on the project. The
importance of the project is to
Help provide access to STEM
career development to northern
New Mexico. This is an important
um growing industry in the state
of New Mexico and this
observatory allows us to get
textualize the instruction of
science and math for our college
students, but also to provide
that exposure to all of our
pre-K12 students in this region.
Um, we support, we appreciate
the support that we've received
from Senate Finance.
and others to this point and
would like to get this project
across the finish line. We, as I
mentioned, already have $2.5
million invested in the project
and are looking to complete
funding. Thank you.
go to the audience, I think we
went to the audience. Anybody in
support.
in opposition. We have one
support on Zoom.
It's in her brain.
when I moved the table.
The table
Yes
Senator Padilla seconds that.
Any objection to the tabling
motion see none.
Senator Padilla.
Thank you chair and everyone
we're just simply trying to with
the 395 uh Senator Lopez and I
have been stalwart supporters as
many have on the Special
Olympics New Mexico program and
I just want to make sure that
the funding stays solid for them
and solid for a while.
OK.
Anybody in the audience and
support nobody, anybody up.
Representative.
You want to sit at the table?
No, OK, you're fine.
Mr. Chairman, I moved the table.
And the bill 3
395.
Taking my center or
Republicans are killing bills
today. Any objection to the
tabling motion.
I know they took credit for one
objection.
shows up to the motion.
He doesn't want the money for
Special Olympics. I do want the
money, Mr. Chair. I don't
understand the process though,
but yeah, got it.
Cheers. No, don't show me this
voting no.
Uh, Senator Gonzalez Senate Bill
414.
I want the House members to
notice how good we are. We don't
even have to fill seats.
understand what we're doing.
Senate Bill 414 Senator
Gonzalez. Oh, Mr. Chairman, this
is again also a request to the
Uh, Department of Finance and
this is for the construction of
a
Medical complex in Taostas
County, Wichison.
Includes services for both
children, women, men, and
infusion of several other
components to the medical part.
And I do have um.
Um
Director or the CEO from the
hospital online if you would
like to.
Listen to him on Zoom.
James Kaiser.
James unmute yourself.
There you go.
Senator Munoz, Senator Gonzalez,
Sen members of the finance
committee. Can you hear me? We
can hear you.
Uh, this is James Kaiser. I'm
the CEO at Holy Cross Medical
Center. Um, I was called here to
serve as the sisters were a
decade ago. How, uh, Taos County
has been medically underserved
for decades. Our number one
request by our larger community
on the health needs assessment
was access to primary care and
urgent care, and we've begun a
process to address that. We're
fortunate with the national
workforce shortage to be able to
recruit physicians.
and practitioners to our area,
but we've exhausted our efforts
to try to locate space. Our
initial efforts in phase one, we
cannot find space for women's
and children's services, and our
hope was to find space for
visiting specialists from our,
our urban areas, as well as
chemotherapy services,
particularly for the Pueblo, um,
for our tribal community, uh,
transportation is a social
determinant of health and uh
Travel is difficult. Uh, we're
largely an impoverished
community, um, travel and
inclement weather, icy canyon,
boulders in the canyon,
wildlife, but someone in an
immunocompromised state, very
ill for the families to go 32 to
34 times a week for chemotherapy
out of the community, the
burdensome travel is a
disservice. We're asking for
your support to begin to address
this and bringing those services
to Taos County. Primary
Care is a cost saver and
investment that deters long term
downstream higher-end costs
train wrecks in our emergency
department that's already
overwhelmed, as well as uh
provides preventive care that
can keep people from having to
seek high-end tertiary care from
specialists unless they've
already expired, so we would
appreciate your support for
this, please.
OK. Thank you.
Just so you know, Thomas, if the
money's in the or I'm sorry.
If the money's in the budget,
it's tabled, so the money there
is money in there, don't send
you off the cliff.
I can have emotion. This German
I move the table.
I have a second
My center buy and an objection
to the tabling motion.
no.
We're done tabling bills.
In the morning, senators
uh yeah, Capital LA is still in
drafting. We thought it'd be
down today. It's not, so.
We're gonna skip over that one
center accomplice, you have.
Lieutenant Bill 495, which does
not get tabled, it means has
language that needs to pass
through. Tell us about higher
education radio center
accomplices.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman Rivers in the Senate
Finance Committee, in essence,
what, uh, Senate Bill 495 would
do it amends the educational
television equipment replacement
fund. That's OK, Cali.
Uh, to include expenditure at
public schools at dad's uh uh
radio equipment to an eligible
use and makes a technical change
to clarify the fund is
non-reverting, so in essence,
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, all it does is it has
the uh public schools radio to
the language, uh that is already
being used, if you will, excuse
me, by public television.
So
does
Anybody in the audience and
support.
Anybody in opposition.
Anybody on Zoom?
Questions from committee
members.
Senator Steinbbo, thank you, Mr.
Chair. So Senator, thanks for
the bill. Uh, is this an LFC
bill? So, uh, mis, Mr. Chairman,
uh, Senator Steinborn, no, it is
not.
Can you tell us a little bit
about the bill. I'm sorry, uh,
where, where it's coming from
and why we're doing it.
Uh, uh, Mr. Chair, of course,
Senator Steinborn, I really
appreciate the uh the question.
So it basically is coming from
the uh public uh networks, if
you will, that are in public
schools as an example.
Uh, KNW in Albuquerque is one,
and then there are other school
districts, uh, that do have, uh,
public radio networks within
their uh.
Particular programs.
And so with the use of the uh
public television fund, uh, all
we're asking for is that they be
allowed to go ahead and utilize
those resources as well, uh, and
it also includes, if you will,
the purchase of equipment, but
it's only for uh public
television and public radio.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator,
and then how, how much money do
is this a a fund that we put
money into as a state every
year.
Uh, yes, uh, Mr. Chair, and uh,
and of course to uh members of
the finance committee and uh
Senator Steinborn, uh, so right
now, of course, it indicates
that there's no fiscal impact.
Uh, it's my understanding that
uh
I don't know what the total
amount is within the fund, but
uh this would be somewhere in
the neighborhood of about
250,000 that would probably be
used uh for public radio and
again through uh the.
Uh, public television, public
radio, when it comes to the full
amount.
Uh, there are, they all, uh, not
compete for the resources, but
the resources to continue to
keep their uh signals going and
to keep the public message out.
Into the public.
It misre centers a great bill.
Any other questions from
community members.
Um, motion for DuP pass Senator
Steinmore, that's your first
motion.
Yeah, I don't think that's true.
Uh, second byin Padilla.
Heal thero so we know.
correct.

Senator Woods votes yes, Senator
Sendo,
Senator Shendo votes, yes,
Senator Munozens yes, we have 10
in the affirmative, 1 in the
negative. We have, but do pass.
Thank you very much
Mr. Chair. Thank you very much,
members of the Senate Finance
Committee.
All right, we'll move on to uh
Community substitute Senate Bill
492.
No, but the,
the higher education
449. OK, yeah, we'll move on to
449. Uh, thank you very much,
Mr. Chairman, members of the
Senate Finance Committee
House bill.
I'm sorry. Hold on a second to
the chair.
OK, yeah, House Bill 449 as
amended.
Represented Lenty Campos.
Yeah, thank you very much Mr.
Chair and members of the Senate
Finance Committee, uh, house 449
as amended, uh, in essence would
uh.
create a new fund for major
higher education capital
projects and a statutory
framework for the fund.
Uh, capitalization of the fund
would depend on future
appropriations by the
legislature.
The fund would be a new source
of support for major academic
and research projects at the
state for your institutions,
these projects are difficult to
finance without existing sources
due to dramatic increases in
construction costs.
It would ultimately um benefit
all institutions in the state,
not just the four-year
institutions.
Funding larger projects through
the new fund would uh relieve
pressure on limited general
obligation bond revenues.
Uh, providing more capacity for
projects through the existing
capital process
for both 4 year and 2-year
institutions, and then eligible
uses of the fund would also
include student life.
And student housing projects for
all state higher education
institutions and tribally
controlled colleges.
There is currently no source of
capital outlay for those
projects other than
discretionary appropriations
from individual legislators and
the governor and student fees.
And so this bill includes
matching uh requirements for
institutions and a process for
um waiving the match if
institutional funds are not
available.
And then also it requires design
to reach a certain stage of
completion.
prior to the war of of uh
construction funding.
And then directs the higher
education department and design
standards for student life, um,
and also recorded.
Funding will reduce cost
uncertainty and uh building
costs support.
To reduce the need and so within
that, uh, again, Mr. Chairman,
members of the Senate Finance
Committee, in essence what this
bill would do is go ahead and
create, if you will, the funding
mechanism.
as it goes forward, it also
creates, if you will, the match
that institutions would have to
come up with, especially if
they're gonna be dealing with uh
the ING uh projects or if you
will, student life for the 4
year and the 2-year student life
projects and uh more
importantly, as it goes forward,
this helps us uh to become more
stable as we see the growing
needs, if you will, in higher
education, uh, construction
costs and the needs, uh,
particularly to go ahead.
and replace our facilities and
the infrastructure as we move
forward, uh, they're definitely
is the need to make those
improvements. So with that, Mr.
Chairman and members of the
Senate Finance Committee, but
I'd like to do is just ask uh
Kelly uh Carswell, who is our
member of our LFC staff, uh, to
make a few brief comments in
terms of some of the things that
she sees within this bill, uh,
and if I may just also with the
uh the note, um, that.
She is not here to go ahead and
support the bill or oppose the
bill, she is here to go ahead
and provide technical
assistance. Thank you very much,
Mr. Chairman. Thank you Senator
Kelly.
Um, Mr. Chair members of the
committee, I'll be very brief
because the senator covered most
of it. Um, this bill is
primarily aimed at addressing
two problems, uh, within the
higher education, uh, capital
outlay world, um, as the senator
said, um, the first one is that
construction costs have
increased dramatically, um, for
all public works, public
infrastructure projects, um, and
unlike some of our other sources
of capital funding, the
dedicated funds for higher
education capital, which are
tied to property tax.
taxes have not increased at
anywhere near a similar rate.
We're looking at about an 80%
increase in construction costs
and only a 10% increase in the
revenues that support higher
education projects. Um,
secondly, um, the other issue it
addresses is a need for funding
for student life and student
housing projects, of which we
have no dedicated source, um,
currently and uh institutions
are not able to use the current,
um, and I think
With that, uh, we will just
stand for questions.
Oh
Thank you, uh, first I'll go to
the audience, anybody here in
support of uh House Bill.
49 is amended.
Do you have anybody here on on
Zoom that supports?
And we'll have a couple
Go ahead, Martin.
Good.
Yes, uh, good morning Mr. Can
you pick that up? Yeah, yeah,
there you go. Good morning, Mr.
Chair, members of the committee,
uh, my name is Mark Sedra. I'm
the director of New Mexico
Council University presidents,
and we're, I'm here instead in
support of this legislation
House Bill 449. It's something
that the council and higher
education has been talking about
for years on establishing this
similar fund top with these
projects when it comes to RING
research facilities are student
life, which also our dormitories
as well, so um we appreciate.
the leadership of the senator,
the LFC, Kelly and the work
they've been doing with this, so
that would for also establish
and identifying those revenue
sources for the matching
component of this legislation.
So with that, we stand in full
support of this legislation.
Thank you, Mr. Spons for
bringing this.
Good morning. My name is Kathy
Elliott. I'm the registered
lobbyist for Masalands Community
College in Qua County. Mesa
Lands has been
Um, for years trying to build
some kind of dormitory in order
to grow their um student
enrollment because we currently
have none and we really thank
the sponsor at this point for
bringing forward these types of
bills so that we can look
forward to a much more thriving
future. Thank you very much.
Good morning. Thank you, Mr.
Chair and members of the
committee. I'm Doctor Barbara
Medina and I represent the exec
uh New Mexico Association of
Community Colleges, 9
institutions, mostly in rural
areas from Taos to Elmo Gordo
and grants to Roswell and Rio so
we stand in support of this
legislation and thank the
sponsor for bringing it forth.
Thank you. Uh, anybody in
opposition to this bill?
OK, I will go to committee
questions Senator Brown.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman, uh.
um
help me out a little bit, uh, do
we have?
Is our population of college
students increasing or
decreasing?
Um, Mr. Chair, uh, Senator, it
is not increasing.
Enrollment is down from, I think
a 2011 peak.
Uh thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman,
Senator and, and what do we see
as the graduation rate.
From
Established colleges.
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator, I do not
have those off of the top of my
head, but they should be in your
volumes.
And I can probably.
Sorry, Connor is not here
because he's proofing the budget
right now, but I can probably
get a text from him and tell you
the exact page.
Do, do you, which, which volume
um there should be a chart in
volume 3, I believe.
In volume one or in maybe in
volume one.
I have
time to look it up.
All right, thank you. I think
it's around 50%, maybe, maybe
less.
Um
Around 50% in 6 years.
It's it's right around that
area. It's either 47 or 52. I
can't remember which one.
changes a little bit up and
down.
Um
So
Mr. Chairman, um, Senator, how,
how
How much money are you wanting?
This one to to what's your
target?
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator Brandt,
um, there isn't a specific
target funding for the fund
right now. So what the bill
really does is, um, establish a
statutory framework for the fund
that then it would be up to the
legislature next year or in
future years to make direct
appropriations for it or direct
staff to kind of identify
potential revenue sources, um,
aside from general fund
appropriations, uh, one of the
reasons for that is that there
is um
Some kind of administrative
implementation that needs to be
undertaken by the higher
education department before the
fund could be put to use.
Thank you, Mr.
Chairman and senator, um.
OK, so
We don't know how much we want
in it.
How,
are
how are colleges fund buildings
now.
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator Brant,
so, um, the dedicated source of,
uh, construction funding for
major higher ed projects
currently comes from general
obligation bonds, which are
available, um, every other year,
and the institutions in those
years and in the non-GOB years
go through a formal request
process, um, with the higher
education department, um, DFA,
LFC also sits on that committee
where they make requests and
then
like for state agency capital
projects, um, staff then do, uh,
analysis on those requests, and
they go through the legislative
Finance Committee budget process
in the fall, um, and essentially
the, the problem is that, um,
the GOB revenues grow slow rate,
um, because they're populated by
a statewide property tax, um,
and construction costs have
grown at a much greater rate. So
it has become
Very difficult to find major,
um, academic projects,
especially at the 4 years from
that source of funding, um,
while also meeting all of the
other demands that, um,
The other institutions have.
Uh, so that's kind of one of the
issues that this is addressed at
as well as, you know, what the
statutory framework does is kind
of establish some policy
parameters under, um, around
these projects, uh, that, um,
the chair and members of the
Legislative Finance Committee
have sort of been pushing for
that aren't aren't currently
formalized, uh, such as ensuring
that we have
design
That's kind of well along its
way, um, prior to funding
construction, so that you all
have more of an.
Mr. Chairman, um,
I'm sorry, I forget your name.
Mr. Chair Callie Carswell.
By the end of this year, I'll
know it.
Right, because we'll be together
in LFC.
But um
Well, if I behave.
But, uh, Kelly, I appreciate
that and so.
When we're looking at, you know,
Let's let's, let's just use you
and them an example cause it's
where two of my, you know, one
of my kids went there and one of
and my wife went there.
So, um, if you and him comes and
they want to build.
Uh, a new pope joy.
My wife says to Pope Joy ought
to be replaced. That's one of
the ones that she
She's, she's like the,
especially like the student
section where the music, so you
can get that back to you. I'm
telling you this so you can get
back, you know, um, anyway, uh,
she was a music student there.
Their facilities are terrible,
so let's say they want to
replace those.
They would come, would we look
at like their full utilization
and what they're using now and
do they really need new building
or can we just, you know, make
another building work for that,
that would be better.
That's maybe not being used to
its capacity.
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator Brandt,
yes, we do look at all of those
issues, um, and that information
goes through the committee, uh,
in the fall in the budget
process, and I do have, um, some
answers to you on your previous
question. Um, so enrollment is
down from its peak, but it has
been increasing for the past 3
years, um, and graduation rates
are currently 47%, and they are
shown on page 101 of volume one.
Thank you for that.
I'll take a look at that when
when Senator Lanier starts
questioning because I know he's
gonna have some great questions.
But uh yeah, I appreciate it. I,
I, I don't know, honestly, I'm
really, I am torn on this bill
because
Um
I, I'm, I'm not too impressed
with our universities right now.
Um
Just nothing. I think that some
of the things that we've seen
their staff doing some of the
things that we have seen, uh,
some of the product coming out
of the universities aren't
great, 47% graduation rate.
And that's over a 6 year period,
it's not 4.
It's a 6 year time frame.
And they're only graduating in
47%, so
I'm not sure giving them more
money to build new buildings is
really a good thing to to reward
them with.
When their results are
Honestly pretty pathetic.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, who, who
For these young ladies that
walked in the room, bunch of
young ladies come up here. I'm
interested to see why you're
here.
Wait, wait, don't run out the
door, come up here.
to perform.
We don't have ADD today.
Come up here and tell us why
you're here and why you're
dressed so nice today.
the school.
We're here is to see.
you guys support, support HB 71.
Thank
Thank you.
And
But I mean, what's the HB 71? I
don't know it off the top of my
head. Do you girls want to tell
us what HB 71 is?
So it's basically to like
support teachers cause they've
been getting like 15 for 15
years, they're they've been
trying to like get more paid
cause for like the kids like
they're helping our kids and
everything to like get more pay.
Um
We're here because we wanna help
the teachers get paid more
because a lot of people are
quitting.
And there are good teachers out
there who just quit because
they're not getting paid enough,
and we're here to support them
so they can get more paid.
And that
alwaysmos aqui porque and the
person tan.
Uh, molass dinero.
Can I see
The,
uh, it's travajo.
I
That yes.
Where are you guys from?
Mm
We're from Albuquerque.
What high school do you go to?
Um, I go to Cesar Chavez and
they all three go to Highland.
And what's your name,
my name is Yel.
So you know.
Blanca
It itself.
All right. Thank you guys for
coming today and dressing up.
Where they were
Center compost, Senator Brandt,
you still have the floor, right?
So you're still.
Yeah, have a few questions.
Kelly, is this, this is part of
the package where we're trying
to create.
are dependent on cash for
bonding, correct, and not going
to geo bonds or STB.
Um, Mr. Chair, it, it does
relate to that, yeah, and it
would support that, um, broader
goal that you OK.
My word of caution is to the we
heard in LFC over the summer, so
people don't know. We haven't
really built any new.
Student housing, we haven't
upgraded campuses since like in
the 70s.
And so we need to start.
Upgrading what we got because we
keep remodeling the center block
buildings that we have.
And so this is part of that
package. My word of caution is
You know, that
You schools that want to build
housing, better have the
students and you better have the
income.
The, the cost modeling to
maintain, to build, I mean, to
maintain and operate these
buildings, cause we're not gonna
come back in
give you operational for money
because you had a dream and it
didn't work out in 50% are
vacant and now.
We gotta fix that, so.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
OK. Anybody else, uh, Senator
Linier.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Good morning, Kelly.
Um,
I'm, I kind of have the same
issue.
I look at everything as a
philosophy of results.
And when you look at graduation
rates and some of the things
that is going on in higher
education, the money that we're
flooding into there.
You know
Sometimes the results aren't
relative to what we're investing
in there. So that's, that's kind
of where I'm coming from, that,
that's a little bit of my issue.
But if you look on page 3,
section E of the bill.
To be la line 14. I, if you can
just kind of walk me through
some of this cause
I'm not very smart today.
The match requirements provided
for
Uh, subsection C of this section
may be eligible.
To be waived upon a finding by
the department.
That the education institute
cannot responsibly afford.
Can you kind of explain what
that, that means.
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator Lanier,
Sir. So, um,
Let me just explain quickly a
couple of things to kind of set
this up.
Um, so currently under the
existing capital processes for
higher education, the 4 years
have no required match, and the
two years have a 25% required
match. And that's because the
two years have access to local
property taxes that the four
years don't. Um, often, both the
higher education department and,
um, the legislature asks the 4
years to bring a match anyway.
Um, but it's sort of an informal
process and, you know, I think,
given, um, both the cost of
construction and some of the
issues that you all have raised
also, there has been, um, a
desire among LFC members to
Sort of encourage the
institutions to bring the match
to kind of demonstrate their,
the institutional commitment to
projects, um, and, you know, to
kind of have some skin in the
game and show that it's a real
institutional priority and it's
important. Um, and so this bill
formalizes a match requirement
for different project types for
both the 2 years and the 4
years. Um,
But the caveat in E is that it
provides a mechanism for there
to be a waiver of the required
match, um, should it be
necessary, and it kind of
creates some hurdles for doing
that. Um, one at the executive
level where it would require you
their finances when they request
a match and make a
recommendation, and then
ultimately it's up to the um,
relatedly just to kind of go to
your and Senator Brandt's, um,
concerns. I want to emphasize
that both appropriations to this
fund and appropriations from the
fund for projects would be
subject to the discretion of the
legislature, so you all would,
you know, have the opportunity
and the responsibility and
authority to review all
appropriations that would come
from the fund and consider all
of the issues that you, that you
both brought up, um, with regard
to OK thank you, Kelly and
Mister Chair, so
If, if that's part of my hangup
is
Mm
It's not a required match.
On every single project, it's
just required by who.
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator, so it is
a required match, but, um, this
is, you know, essentially, um,
similar to the way we fund
public school capital outlay,
where there's a required match,
um, that is set, but in
instances where the districts
truly can't afford it. There's a
process, um, outlined in statute
for waiving the local match and
often the result is actually a
partial waiver. It's not that
there's no match.
Required, it's that it might be
a lesser amount that then is set
and so it, it just kind of
provides an off ramp in a
situation, um, where they truly
aren't institutional funds
available to meet the match.
And, you know, that, that could
be, um,
That, that might be the case in
some truly like very high-cost
projects, for instance, but it
would have to go through a
process where you all sort of,
there's a thorough vetting of
the finances of the institution,
and then, you know, it kind of
comes to you as a separate
decision from funding the
project overall, if that makes
sense. So Mr. Chair, the, so the
waiver would be set by the
higher education department,
that who would do that? Mr.
Chair, Senator, the higher
education department would make
a recommendation.
On the waiver and the waiver
would ultimately be decided by
the legislature.
And Mr. Chair, so in that
section it says to jump over to
subsection C, so that'll be on
page 2 and it starts off, except
for as provided in subsection D
of this. We're kind of making
this little circle.
Um
Eligible major projects shall
meet the following criteria, and
then, of course, they're listed
and, and I don't have a problem
with, with the way that they're
listed, um, I know there's a
55%.
In there that
Kind of sticks out a little bit,
but if we, if we follow that,
now we go to subsection D,
right?
So we go back over to D.
And it's student housing and
student life projects.
Shall it here, so that would be
on line 9.
Adhere to space and design
standards adopted by her higher
education.
Department
What is a student life project.
Um
Mr. Chair, Senator Lanier. So
these are kind of like student
amenities. So they're not an
academic buildings, basically,
you know, it could be like the
student fitness center or
something like that.
So Mr. Chair, so it'd be like
the sub or something like that
cafeterias.
Something like that, OK.
I, I appreciate it.
Thank you. Thank all three of
you.
Thank you, sir.
OK. Thank you. I had a question,
uh.
Uh, with the tribal colleges,
uh, since they don't have a tax
base.
Pretty much probably a waiver
process for them.
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator Sendo,
they would be subject to the,
the same waiver requirements
everyone is.
Thank you.
7 houses
before do pass.
Oh,
you move for, I thought you said
before you passed. Most people
do pass by Senator Gonzalez, uh.
Seconded by Senator.
What you call the rule?
Senator Brandt?
Senator Brown votes no. Senator
Campos. Senator Camposia,
Senator Gonzalez, Senator
Gonzalez Ozia, Senator Linier.
No.
Senator Lanier votes no, Senator
Padilla. Senator Padillas,
Senator Steinborn.
Senator Tobiasson.
Senator Tobiasson votes no,
Senator Trujillo. Senator
Trujillo votesia, Senator Woods.
Oh, yes.
Senator Woods votes yes, Senator
Schendo, yes.
Senator Shando Bosia, Senator
Munoz,
yes, we have a Du past 7 in the
affirmative, 3 in the negative.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you. We are gonna come
back this afternoon, so, uh,
let's do, we need more more
bill, we need to table that
Senate Bill 492, and I'll just
explain that real quick.
Online universities are the
quickest growing population in
the state.
492.
So we started this project in
uh.
About 4 years ago in the NMSU in
the online system. That's the
only system that saved in NSU's
population growth. So we, we
know that other universities
name them Grand Canyon, Arizona
State.
All of them are marketing to our
online students instead of
schools.
Setting these up independently.
And then
paying the cost to an out of
state company.
We want them to uh.
get this in New Mexico. There's
an agreement with all the
universities to to begin to do
this. No one can hoard another
uh universities specialization,
you know, you send their
accomplices to school, social
work in is Highlands, I think is
the number one thing.
NMSU UNM will not be able to
target that student. So if they
want to get an online degree in
social work that will be
targeted towards Highland
University.
And so this is the start. I will
tell you the most interesting
thing to me is ASU came into
Gallup, New Mexico.
And recruited high school
students.
To online high school and said
if you go online at ASU in high
school, we will guarantee
placement at ASU.
In Arizona, and you'll begin
working on your dual credit
system. So we've now we begin to
see the draw on high school
students throughout the state
and, and we have to create this,
so.
That's what that, that's what
that the language is gonna do in
house build to Senator Tre Hill.
It needs to be tabled, yes,
ma'am.
Like in the table.
A second it myself.
Any objection to the table in
motion seemed none.
OK, we, we are getting called to
the floor.
Uh, what time is it
is representative Herrera here,
you know that.
Uh, center.
But just grab that bill because
we'll do that NMFE.
Um
This is Senate House Bill 2 240,
sir. The proposed revision this
has to do with the state water
revolving loan fund.

state.
Act will allow the New Mexico to
offer financial assistance in

safe drinking Water Act, which
has been amended twice over the
past several years, primary
revisions in the state Act
provide for addition to the
loans and New Mexico Finance
Authority will make grants to
the drinking water revolving
loan fund with eligible water
projects and extend repayment
periods required for loans made
pursuant to the act.
