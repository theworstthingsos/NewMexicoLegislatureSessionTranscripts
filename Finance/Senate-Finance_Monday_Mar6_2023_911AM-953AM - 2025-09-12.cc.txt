For the next time
members in in this hand out you
have we're gonna deal with the
purple section which is language
only we're not dealing with any
dollar amounts because we're
waiting for the tax package to
finally get.
Scored so we know what's
available and and what we can
do.
Operating language in so that's
all we're gonna deal with right
now this morning is everything
the there's about ten items and
purple roughly Charles and and
agent and go over for over a
month this.
Mr chairman if you want me to
focus my comments on the purple
ones only on the part we have
everything else changes money or
changes language that effects
the budget only dealing with
To eighteen the first.
The the this first when Mr
chairman
The request is to add language
to clarify that if you pass
Senate bill two to on wind the
five percent raises for
magistrate judges.
The AOC could do this without
this language but if you wanted
to put it and it would be in
conflict.
The next language.
In this in Senate bill two
doesn't the language also online
the magistrates.
Prior to Mr chair I'm not sure I
I need to double check.
The next one
It's just is what it is the
department of game and fish when
I you state or federal funds for
the purpose of acquiring private
land without explicit approval
by the legislature.
The next one would strike
modernization efforts for
species of greatest conservation
need at the time game and fish
appropriation of two million.
On the next page Mr Chairman.
This would restrict the early
childhood departments ability to
deploy pre K. in communities.
This would require them not to
supplant existing pre K.
programs operated by private
providers and it would limit
their ability to provide pre K.
and communities with
pre K. enrollment slots of
eighty percent there are many
communities that already have
more than eighty percent
coverage so the first one the
first.
Sentence in this and doesn't
pose a problem the second one
would pose a problem for
deployment and might be seen as
Impermissible micromanagement by
the legislature Mr chairman.
the next one this is language
that's attached to the rate
increase for the nursing homes
the language had been originally
requested by the nursing home
industry.
They have a specific earmark of
revenue for nursing home rate
increases that are tied to
quality of care care performance
measures and value based
purchasing.
The next one Mr chairman as a a
spending increase this is not a
language only if you and
this would be for the rural
FQHC rate increases so you may
want to pan that one until you
deal with your spending items Mr
chairman.
The next one would prohibit HSD
for our expanding eligibility
without prior approval of the
legislature.
And the final two allying.
The language in house bill two
to the current version of house
bill one thirty which did not
provide for the two tiered.
K. twelve plus program and does
not align the principal
responsibility factor with the
family income index.
Okay questions about language.
Question for the future.
So.
Both having to do with games
said.
the first one I sixteen.
that was something that
obviously Mr chair you have a
bill to do but the bill hasn't
passed the quote David Abbey
that's trying to put a bill into
language and I realize the
fillings about the issue but to
me that strikes me as
inappropriate and I I would just
a request on that and frankly on
the next item that.
The full committee be given an
opportunity to vote on that
deferred desires to include that
in
the next one of course is
language that came over from HFC
that was I think from the chair
and self I'm having to do with
just modernization efforts over
there things that that are being
discussed as well and
So.
We should have.
More of a discussion on that
with that again the full
committee of the if that's the
intent is that's language within
health okay now.
Subject to those who are.
Senator Gonzales.
Mr chairman this languages
focused on a private pre K.
providers not hitched.
That's correct Mr chairman.
What.
Mr chair
The the two that Senator
Steinborn was talking about.
Shouldn't I have this
contingency level language only
that if a bill passes the.
This happens.
Senator the thank the language
in should being continues to
benefits and contingency he'll
be with dollars because I think
there's two million dollars for
that I don't know why the game
and fish's not using their game
protection fund for that species
of greatest need right I think
that is an eligible use for
their game protection fund
Charles I believe so.
Mr chairman I think that you're
right now house bill two is just
appropriating an extra two
million dollars for those
purposes that they could
otherwise use their existing
funds for.
So we just change that.
To use in other other funds
came Texan funds.
That should fix that problem.
There.
Right.
But I think the.
The issue between.
to competing ideas or whether
you require them to use it for
modernization efforts are not.
That's the.
Policy and budget question.
Modernization I mean in this
language Mister chairman Senator
I don't know.
I don't see him in the room.
That's a spending item as well
Mr chairman that could be one
you could pandemic until you
decide what to do with the
appropriation as well Senator
Padilla we're just discussing
the language that's in purple
about ten items.
So I I guess we need to see a
lot modernization is what that
is right it's not defined in the
bill Mr chairman.
It's not provide in the bill Mr.
And Mr chair yes the the
One private land.
It is simply further defining.
What's already done in action.
If we have to come in here and
and if they want to use federal
money and they need federal
matching money which in general
fund money they have to ask for
and this just simply states that
so that there's no doubt in
anybody's mind about what needs
to be done.
That's my opinion on.
Let me ask you on six eleven so
that language any empty slots
right now that are available in
the state we just switch those
slots to private providers.
Mr Chairman right now the house
bill two assumes that the
department was simply convert
kids that are already in
childcare into childcare pre K.
slots.
I don't believe that that
language is really necessary I
know there's some concern about
whether there's going to be
efforts to push private pre K.
out of the market in lieu of
public pre K. at the public
schools but the department is
expressed concern about their
ability to even fill the slots
to begin with so.
And then six thirty.
Should not be there at all
because we're gonna take that up
another time because that adds
additional money.
Senator Padilla we're we're just
dealing with language no dollar
amount so six thirty.
I'm just I just want to verify
on six eleven that.
It doesn't give anybody an
advance of their slots
available.
And Mr chairman I would not
recommend that language you're
hearing into micromanaging.
Any other questions and then
we'll start picking them off one
by one.
Center for the need any
explanation for.
Let's start with eighteen.
If we look if we put this
language in there the judges
because of the to last year got
a a big strike and you're saying
the judicial agency.
Can automatically do that.
Correct correct so there's no
need for the language correct
but will they do that because
then it creates an imbalance
would like for you to tell him
to do it Mr chairman okay so can
I have a motion on the two
eighteen so move hello motion to
approve to approve that motion
to approve missions.
Tells the AOC because the
magistrates got a big raise last
year above the judges that they
have to take it out any
objection to that.
Okay.
On the next one.
On five sixteen.
Says departments not use any
federal funds.
Which department is this this is
game and fish Mr chairman
Department gamefish can not use
any federal funds.
No.
a motion and a second.
Any objection to that motion and
can I have R. we need her and.
The state tournament in the.
That not to separate them.
you madam.
Contingency on legislation
passing since this is a change
in policy.
And that's I think the standard
policy of for that purpose
director Avid that.
You know we we should be putting
policy new policy.
So the my request contention on
whatever that those tasks I'm
I'm waiting for the secretaries
because we she got a track
these.
Your
real quickly on that.
We're not some of the committee
chairs involved in suing the
governor of the state once the
money is.
Ours is ours even if it came
from the fed to so it is our
money we get to decide how it's
going to be spent.
Senator that it's different in
the protection fund because
that's from the ammunition and
gun sales and tax so when the
federal money our dedicated
straight to the agency.
Then then we don't we can't
appropriate that for years
everybody's been trying to get
out of the game protection fund.
Into the game protection fund to
use money for dams to use money
for other resources but that
because of the federal.
Thank more the money comes from
federally you can't appropriated
state.
That we can make matching money
for them to use out of that fund
but we can't take that let me
catch up for a quick so on
reviewed everything on to
eighteen made a motion to drop
by Senator Gonzales.
I forget who second.
Senator Woods seconded I guess
on on line to eighteen right and
it passed unanimously.
So.
So.
We have a second Senators last
time was a motion.
Second Senator Padilla would you
call the roll.
Different years different line
this is to sixteen.
Thanks for.
Senator Burt excused Senator
Campos excused Senator Diamond.
Senator.
The second to see.
Okay.
Senator Gonzales yes.
Senator Hemphill yes.
Senator Padilla yes.
Senator share go.
Senator Steinborn
What.
Senator Rodriguez is excused
senator Munoz yes.
Five to three.
And amended that language state
contingent on.
Next one is five sixteen I'll
make the motion to make the
language contingent upon
adoption of the bill this second
by Senator Woods.
To change it to contingent upon
a bill passing there's a bill
for for failing to sixty.
This.
Steinborn there is.
For the greatest conservation
bill there's no need there's no
bill needed this is existing
authority the game protection
fund which is given additional
money.
For the modernization thing for
the modernization peas there is
bills out there that could do
that and so I would.
Understand putting content see
on that part of it but the two
million for spaces greatest
cause for.
Existing budget which is that in
two.
An existing language in the
statute.
I'm not sure I fully on that
mission.
Five sixteen.
I have a motion on the second to
change it to
Contingent upon a bill passing
and they said there is a bill
out there.
No there's there's not a bill on
spaces greatest conservation
eight funding I want to
modernization the.
That's my motion.
Two six I'm sorry.
It's for the second one Mister
chairman Senator it's five
sixteen for game and fish but
it's number five.
Sixteen number four no I sixteen
number four.
Advocating those two items.
So we have a motion to change
the language of a second we call
the roll with the within them.
Change in contingent contingent
upon passing a bill the whole
the whole thing.
Okay Representative Rodriguez so
they wanna contingency language
and giving more money to to game
and fish for modernization will
explain it to a grand spaces.
So identical presenters deal
sorry uses in health education
but I can take the looking for
the real can you take a real
quick it's it's an amendment to
basically.
Simply take away two million
dollars of funding to threatened
species.
So we just a moment to do that.
So Senator Rodriguez will
explain to you so know what's
happening that way.
We just amended on this one
right here.
This one right here department
will not require federal funds
federal lands without
legislative approval there's a
bill for that the next one
there's a bill for the
modernization of the game and
fish Senator Steinborn saying
that the.
Station yes in the performance.
Justin all the purple language
changes to the motion was to
mandate contingent on passing.
Okay let me let me get some
clarification here the motion is
to amend this contingent upon
passing about what is it that
the amendment does again clarify
it for me as a bill to modernize
game and fish out there.
I have with contingent upon a
bill.
And so what we're gonna do this
when I made a motion contingent
upon passing of the bill.
Okay I could add that
explanation it also there's a
supplemental for two million
dollars in and house bill two to
add two species of greatest
conservation made so by making a
contingent on a modernization
bill we're taking way too
million dollars potentially from
threatened species for this
department which I have ability
to do it's just a supplemental
now the word modernization is
connected to a bill so what I
suggest is I for Kate and you
could do the modernization
contingent on a bill but the two
million dollars.
Should not be tied to any of the
bill my opinion is.
Yes
My good with the amendment and
and we're gonna vote on okay
maybe the most okay well nobody
knows of modernization is that's
revenue.
I already have the we have a
motion as.
Call the roll.
Yes.
Senator Campos excused Senator
Diamond yes.
Senator Gonzales yes.
Senator Hemphill.
Senator Padilla yes.
Senator share will.
Senator Steinborn.
now.
Senator Woods yes.
Senator Rodriguez yes.
Yes.
This.
Eight two.
On the next page.
some of this the important ones.
this is an important one for E.
C. for early childhood
what it does is it limits what
they can do with when kids come
from when we get this right
trials from from pre K. right to
K. five right.
This
Would say that they can't use
funds to supplant
private pre K. slots with the
new money they're getting so and
they can't spend money in a
community that has eighty
percent of their kids enrolled
in pre K. works there's already
communities that have more than.
This.
So they're calling me to present
I just want to that's the most.
Yes that's the other one thank
you you have to come back
because they're waiting the
committee so we can have a
motion.
We just walk through it one more
time just to make sure that this
is our ECECD is what it
basically comes down to it that
allows if you put this language
in of those sub plant slots in
private care right correct it's
prohibiting them from being able
to deploy resources they are
appropriating put the maximum
flexibility would limit their
ability to that how does this
jibe with the language the
secretary came forward with.
This is separate this is
probably from the industry Mr
Chairman.
This allows money to continue to
flow to fund private slot.
And it that is not
at limits they're not the
ability under house bill two
right now this would say they
can't take private slides and
convert them to public slots
which I don't think that that's
the problem and it also says you
can't spend money in communities
with more than eighty percent of
kids already in pre K. and
there's communities that have
more than eighty percent of
their kids and pre K. in both
either private or public.
So I recommended to the chairman
that
From staff perspective we don't
recommend this this is very into
micromanagement.
So I'll make a motion to not
adopt a.
Have a second so that.
Do not adopt.
You could just explain it three
times to.
You can just get over it Mr
chairman and not have to take of
the as another option I would
rather just to make the motion
to not adopt the anticipate from
Senator Gonzales.
We went through it once and
asked if there any question.
The Astros that question it also
Sir.
You have a.
Yes Mister chairman Senator this
is veering into impermissible
micromanaging by the legislature
it the department it would
prohibit them from being able to
put supplant.
I'm prekindergarten programs
like you said private verses
Public I don't see that as a
problem in our communities the
other restriction is not
allowing more than eighty
percent.
Enrolled in pre K. were you
already have that in in some
communities around the state
they would have to give up slots
and and my reading of this.
So like Los crucis as an example
where they've virtually all four
year olds have access to some
form of publicly funded pre K.
either through the schools are.
In the the budget assumes that
slots that already are in
private pre K. would just simply
be converted are private child
care would be converted to pre
K. so that's the fastest way we
see the department's ability to
roll out Services.
And I understand that chair that
that's what we're trying to get
my mind wrapped around is it
seems to me that this simply
tries to protect private
providers a little bit.
As opposed to.
Sucking them away from the
world.
So that it's only public.
Yes that's the way I read it we
get both you not taking anything
away from the public but without
the issue takeaway from the
private in the private providers
have a key role in this whole
operation.
If I'm wrong then okay but the
way I'm looking at it is this is
protection for the project.
It's not protection it's not
harming the public.
That's the way I that's the way
I've because I'm sitting here
trying to wrap my mind around.
That's what I think I see thank
you that just you know the help
you need deep into this
department for many years I just
think this I like the Charleston
street chairman I think this is
find serve or lends itself to an
extreme micromanagement.
That from the legislature we
can't do our job I believe is to
create the things and oversee
and make the changes need to
happen we need to let the
department do their job and and
do what we hired them for and I
think that's why we should cut
this piece of this language of.
Mr chair I believe that the
department is clearly said they
don't care what we do they're
going to do it anyway and then
spend money anyway and they've
made it clear that we are
relevant and there's decision
making.
And I am troubled that the
appropriators of straight up
been told.
By the executive.
Secretary.
But a hundred percent increase
in budget more zero five we're
irrelevant.
Nobody else is telling us where
relevant only one department.
Despite more money than god.
They want more and we're really.
And I don't trust that they
won't destroy every private
provider on the whole state
given the chance Mr chair some
additional foot feedback here to
the help of to.
We'll get it for me because we
just got this from the print
shop.
The purpose
of purple section.
Mister chairman Senator.
The way the bill is set the way
the bill is structured is the
additional money would flow out
in the same share for private
providers as what they're
getting today in the same share
for what public providers to
getting today so you've
controlled for that in the
budget line items are ready
because the schools money will
be transferred over to the EDD
and they can't mess with how
much that that money is in the
private providers as in
contracts in the regional and
they can't change that as well.
Hey.
I just add one more comment Sir
this real quick so when we in
the original legislation I
sponsored to create the
department there is language
there that requires a
mixed delivery system so it's
not get this just takes the
shackles off how they do it
because some communities are
going to have the options I'm
I'm all about protecting you
know supporting those private
providers also the huge
political nightmare for me when
we went through this whole thing
the first time so but this
allows the department to make
those decisions were rather than
just trying to come in once a
year and tell them what to do
so.
Colorado.
Motions to not adopt list.
We will get members of the
audience what we're doing but we
are she's relate in rolling in
the six items will get those six
items are ten items can you
restate the motion of the motion
is to not adopt that yes.
Senator Campos is excused
Senator Diamond.
Senator Gonzales.
Senator Hemphill.
Senator Padilla yes.
Senator share of.
Senator Steinborn excused
Senator what's.
There are three guesses excused
Senator then yes yes.
But there's not a doctor.
On to the next one that's.
Six thirty number four in this
language
The flex with the nursing home
industry recommended contingent
on meeting quality care value
based purchasing programs that
at a cost to the state Charles
Mr Chairman know the I think the
amendment is proposing to strike
that out of the bill.
Language in the bill and the
house bill two can.
This would remove the late this
languages currently in house
bill two and the proposed
amendment is to remove it even
though that's what the industry
had recommended and how they
operate with their rate
increases now and then the
nursing homes we get our rate
increase without having to meet
quality of care performance
measures and their value based
purchasing contracts this would
give a a cost to the budget
there's already a rate increase
built into the budget as it sits
before you today this would say
that rate increase is not
contingent on meeting
quality performance metrics.
So it's removing performance
based rate increase so I would
make a motion to not.
Call the center for.
You're not adopt six thirty
number four which is the.
Crease the range without.
I don't know who has for the
language.
And getting increase without
making them accountable to the.
Increases in quality care.
Mister chairman Senator the
amendment would strike this
language out of the bill that's
why the.
Correct and that's why the
chairman voted not to take it
out of the bill or that's what
the motion is yes.
Correct okay.
December is yes.
Senator is yes Senator Campos
yes.
Senator Diamond.
Senator Gonzales.
Senator Hemphill yeah.
Senator Padilla yes.
Senator share yes.
Senator Steinborn excused
Senator Woods yes.
Rodriguez is excused Center then
yes yes.
Thank you dear okay.
That was a motion made by the
second by Senator Hemphill to
not adopt.
We're on six thirty number four.
Skipping over I'm sorry six
thirty number four is money that
will have to go once we get the
tax package and everything
racked up later on so it's it
changes dollars and so we want
to make sure that that gets
moved out there.
I guess one six thirty four
number four for language to
change.
At request at page to sixty
eight eighty nine.
Department will not expand
Medicaid program without prior
approval of the legislature.
We have a motion to stop by make
the most sense to second
Senator.
Can we call the roll.
Sure Mr chair this is what lies
at language needed I don't
understand it we
They would be able to expand
services unless there additional
dollars Mr chairman I think
there's a concern with this
department
Thanks potentially expanding
services without having a
dollars and then coming in and
asking for a supplemental and
basically very similar what
you've seen with the some
departments where they spend
more money than what their
budget can accommodate and then
give you the bill during the
session and if you don't find it
then they'll tell you they're
going to have to descend role
people.
There just doesn't seem
necessary to me
What do they can still do that
well this will stop them from
doing that okay but whether
state had other states analyst
we know.
Mr Chairman I'm sure it's all
over the map the okay.
Senator Burt yes.
Senator Campos this.
Senator Diamond.
Senator Gonzales yes.
Senator Hemphill.
Senator Padilla this.
Senator shares yes.
Senator Steinborn is used
Senator Woods.
Senator Rodriguez is excused
senator Munoz yes nine zero.
Four nine.
I.
Mr Chairman the first one strict
districts the would strike the
bonus units.
that were part of a two tiered
K. twelve plus proposal the LFC
adopted that's not currently in
house bill one thirty.
There was an LFC recommended
legislation to create a new K.
twelve plus formula factor and
this money is it was attached to
that which had extra money for
school districts adding days
about a hundred and eighty and
they had bonus funding for
districts adding more than a
hundred and ninety and this
would strike the second tier of
that.
And just to clarify for the
committee this is part of the
contingency language for a bill
passing to create a new formula
factor it's just saying that for
that new formula factor to go
into effect it doesn't have to
have that second tier it just
has to have one waiting factor
and that's what's included in
the current house bill one
thirty which seems to be has
moved out of.
Health education and house
appropriations and finance the
LFC recommended bill is still
sitting in house education.
Make a motion do not adopt.
A second.
Second from Santo ones we call
the roll.
Senator Burt.
Senator Campos this.
Senator Diamond.
Senator Gonzales yes Senator
Hemphill yes.
Senator Padilla excused Senator
share this.
Senator Steinborn excused
Senator Woods yes.
Senator Rodriguez is excused
Center when yes.
Eight two zero.
In the next one is nine twenty
four PED page six one seventy
line lines four to five
responsibility factor for
principals and assistant
principals based on we're
striking language based on
family income index of the
school.
Correct Mr Chairman there is
funding in house bill two as it
since contention on legislation
increasing the responsibility
factors for principals and
assistant principals and then
tying part of that too the
family income index so that
principals at higher poverty
schools we get a slightly larger
increase the nose at lower
poverty schools that's not
included in house bill one
thirty as it's moved out of
those two committees and the the
legislation that this language
is tied to is recommended by LFC
and that still and health
education is not had a hearing.
So in and it and the principle
that state guy in rural school
has to stay more do more to
school than you're saying that
and the assistant principal then
because the family income index
they're allowed to get a raise.
That poverty schools and how
many schools is that those the
higher the poverty level of the
schools the hired the
responsibility factor would
would be multiplied by so that
super principal at a high
poverty school in the south
valley of Albuquerque we get a
slightly larger base salary than
a school principal in the far
northeast heights of Albuquerque
as an example Mr chairman.
The one that maybe principals
should move from.
Non poverty schools to poverty
schools for that the the but
what the number of that be at
severance hall make under fifty
thousand a year the challenge
that we found through our
research is getting high quality
leadership to be at the schools
with the greatest need.
And this would provide a
financial incentive for those
principles to be at the more
challenging schools and is that
built into the budget that is
built into the budget.
Okay but that I would make a
motion to adopt.
Second by Senator Woods.
Your call.
Thank.
Use.
Senator Campos this.
Senator Diamond.
Senator Gonzales yes.
Senator Hemphill yes.
Senator Padilla said excuse to
Senator share yes Senator
Steinborn excused Senator Woods
yes.
Senator Rodriguez is excused and
senator Munoz yes eight two
zero.
Because that's a doctor that's
all the ones we're doing aging
if you could just get the purple
one sent out because we get the
house bill to rack up and what
are at all the.
All the other languages that.
Whose money around one not today
so we know that.
That was enough to do as well.
The.
And so all the other language
yes I think all wrapped up for
tightening of numbers were I
think that unveiled the tax
package sometime this morning so
once we know what the numbers
are the tax package and what
that's gonna look like then
we're gonna come back and say
there's capacity and then we're
gonna start looking at let me
with the exact because we're we
know so we're still short on
rural health care well we're
short on some other stuff in and
then when I start pulling down
over the next two days and then
start looking at language that
