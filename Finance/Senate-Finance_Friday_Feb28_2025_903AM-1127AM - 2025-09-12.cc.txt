that was taken out.
The next one
is on page 4.
And page 5.
LFC did not recommend continuing
to extend the replacement of the
child support enforcement
project, which has been going on
since 2014.
But there is about $16 million
of
Uh, spending authority left and
HAFC chose to reauthorize.
Uh
That money in lieu of
appropriating additional money
for that project to see if they
can salvage it or not.
LFC staff view in our
recommendation in the fall, it
was a failed project, and we
should
Abandon it, but there's uh
reauthorization language in
House Bill 2 for that which page
are charge that was on page.
4.
Line 12
And 5, 14.
We're on the IT.
should say section 7 at the very
top.
Yep
Page 4, line 12.
And page 5, line 14.
Those were changes from what you
saw when we were going over the
LFC versus the exec.
And so again, that child support
enforcement project's been going
on since 2014.
The next couple of pages are all
the same as what you've seen
before.
And if you get down to line 30.
HFC maintained not reauthorizing
this um project on
Page 9, line 30.
The money hasn't even been
budgeted and.
There was only 3.
3 changes in the actual new
spending authority.
Uh, you can see on page 10.
Line one.
TRD
Uh, has a project.
They feel they need the full 5.6
million in order to move forward
on this. It was not in the LFC
recommendation. HAFC added 3,
that could be something to take
a look at.
Uh, if they need the full 5.6 in
order to do that project and
complete it.
Uh, within this appropriation
time span.
So that's an example, Mr.
Chairman of where HAFC did some
and then left.
Uh, some potentially for the
Senate Finance Committee.
No changes on the rest of that
page.
Mr. Chairman, on
Line 12 on page 11.
Um
Increasing this to $1 million
for early childhood.
And then using some of the
excess early childhood trust
fund for that as opposed to
general fund.
That's the amount uh the
department, I believe, said they
needed in order to complete this
project.
Sorry, can you say that again?
That last whole line of line 12.
You'll see the increase of the
total funding amount to 1
million from 50,000 in LFC.
That's the program, right? Is
that the shortfall from last
year. Well, that's for their IT
project for fit. You'll see in
the specials, uh, that the
Uh, rate increase was funded as
a supplemental to get that
started, um, this fiscal year.
And then you'll see in their
operating budget.
That carried forward.
This
On that point, we go to
contractors on all this IT
stuff, don't we?
Yes, so this will be adding to a
contract.
Yes. OK, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chair, and would this be
reoccurring? This would not be a
reoccurring uh cost. This is
just the cost to get the system
up and running, there could be
ongoing costs related to
maintaining the system that we
would see in the operating
budget.
The last change.
Believe Mister Chair.
Mm
Is Department of Public Safety.
Or the on line 26, page 13.
An additional 2 million.
Which is 1 million above the
executive request for phase two
of the intelligence-led policing
project.
And then finally, Mr. Chairman,
on page 14.
Line 31.
Mhm
An additional 4 million.
For the higher education
consortium project for the
community colleges where they're
Coming together to build one
system for some of their back
office and student information
system, um, project.
That's mainly for their um
financial systems.
Different from human resources
an online platform for learning.
It's an ERP in enterprise
resource planning, financials,
HR asset management, all that
kind of stuff. What's the
original? Is this an expansion
of the cost for implementation
here or is
Do we know?
Yes, it's the next phase, um, if
this has ended up costing more
than we originally thought, but
this is, I think, getting closer
to where they they've been
pitching in institutional funds
in a significant way as well, so
it's not like we're paying for
the entire thing but also a one
time, so the committee knows
it's a one time once it's up,
it's up and you get a lot of
efficiencies. I think there's 5
community colleges now that are
on it or something so, OK.
on page 13 9 24 CYFD. Can we
gather all the supplementals,
deficiencies, IT stuff for CYFD.
I want to see what they're
The total is and put them, you
know, this is all IT stuff, so
put it in in where we're
tracking it in.
CYFD is gonna come with a number
that we don't know yet.
And so we need to figure out.
What we have funded and what we
haven't funded instead of just
chasing it from one sheet to
another. Yes sir, Mr. Chairman.
That does it for IT.
with that.
Another question.
Mr. Chairman, if we want to turn
to.
budget adjustment Authority
request.
There's a handout that looks
like this.
And then there's a spreadsheet
behind it that looks like this.
So just as a, a quick reminder.
Broad authority is included in
House Bill 2 as it sits today to
allow uh category transfers if
you have one of the house 2 in
front of you and you flick to an
agency's budget.
You can see there's personnel
services and benefits,
contracts, and other.
And so they would have authority
to move money between those line
items. DFA has issued guidance
that they're not going to be
approving any of those types of
bars at the beginning of the
fiscal year absent some really
good.
Reason, technical reason in
order to do that. So
Uh, that's, uh, progress.
Agencies, when you see there's
gonna be columns in the budget
for
Uh, interagency transfers or for
other state funds.
Let's say state printing at the
General Services Department is
their business, they're an
enterprise entity. So they're
bringing in revenue because
people are using their services,
uh, or agencies are using their
services. If they're
Business is bringing in more
revenue than they anticipated,
but they've got costs to keep up
with that. They've got broad
authority to bring in additional
5% revenue, so they can do an
adjustment for the amounts that
you see in section 4.
5% higher than that.
Anything beyond that, they need
specific budget adjustment
authority for and that's what's
included.
In this table
Um, you know, aging is bringing
in more money for a conference,
uh, they have the ability to
increase their budget for that
specific purpose. So that's
what's in this particular area.
There's very few changes.
Uh, from what you've seen in
bars, uh, based on what the
House appropriations and finance
did.
Let me get to that first page.
You're just gonna go over the
changes that's correct, not all
of this, Mr. Chairman, even
though I did get a triple shot
espresso this
line 17.
Page 6.
So if you look in the
transportation budget.
There's a lot more transparency
in the way that that's laid out
this year where things like how
much is budgeted for debt
service, how much is for like
heavy maintenance.
Uh, and as a part of the House
Bill 3 negotiations, there was a
change in there.
Um
Budget adjustment Authority to
be able to move money up to a
certain amount, uh, amongst
those categories.
The next page, the next line is
gonna be page 11.
Line 46.
And this is just allowing um
The Office of Superintendent of
Insurance to increase.
Amounts for payouts from the
patient's compensation fund.
And then the next one, Mr.
Chair, so does that just
continue, uh, or just a one time
or cause that'll never stop. I
mean, that's, that's always
gonna need to be, it's OK if
you, you're OK, chair, if we
just talk directly, yeah, I'm,
I'm my glasses so I'm not
looking up that much so I'm just
we're, we're never gonna really
see that
that's right for the next fiscal
year you're giving them
authority. There's an amount
that's in section 4. You're
saying that that amount could be
different.
Because we don't know how much
is going to be settled and paid
out.
But you can adjust your budget
to make those payouts. That's
correct. So we would anticipate
to see that again in FY 27 when
you come back, um, because
projecting how much is going to
go out of this fund is very
difficult. OK.
Thank you. Yeah.
The, the limelight below that,
Charles explained no LFC ad. I
don't think I've seen this.
So it's still on page 11, number
47.
Oh, this is for the state fair,
but it says no LFC ad. I don't
so this was not this was not uh
requested or recommended by the
um executive and it was an LFC
recommendation.
Basically, there's a bill
floating through that says um.
If the bill passes that the
staffing and programming for the
African American performing Arts
Center.
This transferred over to the
Department of Cultural Affairs
of the state fair, we're gonna
recommend for you that we don't
need this bar authority. We've
consulted with DFA if the bill
passes, there's other provisions
in House Bill 2 that will allow
that transfer to occur.
And then line 48, we passed the
Senator Padilla's bill.
They gave him 3.6 million, this
language had been there for 3
years and they've never even
really used it.
They just keep coming back
looking for general fund, I
mean.
She vetoed it last year.
And so why would we give more
authority when Senator Padilla,
correct me if I'm wrong, but you
didn't your bill give him 3.6
million in
They only need 2 or something.
That's about the amount Mr.
Chairman that they bring in
revenue, and this gives them
authority if that's the right
amount to adjust their budget to
go ahead and be a pass-through
back out to.
Uh, the race tracks and for the
HSA compliance, well, for this
year, yeah, we would, we won't
be, so does this apply to 25.
This applies to FY 26 is what
we're looking at right now the
language to pass the money
through.
So we need to research if they
need that for
Uh, the current fiscal year,
additional bar authority.
A chair Senator Padilla, they do
have this language for FY 25
from last year's house bill too.
They would need this authority
to do it this year though,
because we have not passed the
legislation.
You've given them budget
adjustment authority in the
current budget to do that.
And then this is giving it to
them for next fiscal year and
then the, the, the, the bill
clears all that up so they don't
have to keep coming back.
With the bar adjustment.
The bill, I think just is
clarifying how the money would
flow, but they still need a, a,
but do need language to make the
transfer.
Right, is that correct?
That bills in the house now, so
for anyone wanting to help with
that.
Mr.
So, could you go back to number
11.
a new
11, um, on page 4.
it.
11.
for.
Healthcare Authority giving them
15%.
Because it's a brand new budget
adjustment request.
That's not in House Bill 2. It's
not in House Bill 2. They could
bring in up to 5%.
But this would raise that cap to
15 and it was not recommended.
Excellent, thank you.
Sure.
Let's back up and then we can
keep going forward. Go ahead.
page 2 on uh.
The general service 515 General
Services, 15 million.
Um
They gave us a, a, a cost
estimate here a while back.
Like 370 million on that is just
included in that 370 million or
is this an add on to that.
That, uh, larger figure, Mr.
Chairman, is what they feel
they've reserved for total
potential liability.
Not all of that's gonna come due
in one fiscal year, uh, this
gives them authority to increase
their budget by another 15
million from what you've got in
section 4.
Um, for the nearest term, uh,
payouts that have come out of
that fund.
OK
I guess you have a question I
have in
We can do this offline but
A agencies make settlements.
Before GFD even knows it.
That settlement there would come
out of the agency budget instead
of GF.
Mhm
Mr. Chairman, agency settlements
outside of the liability fund
should be rare.
Um
This is also for FY 25, not for
the next, this is for the
current fiscal year. So it's,
it's probably more likely to
happen. OK, thank you.
Oh what agencies pay into the
fund.
Right.
And they, there's a claim made
and they have to go to the fund
to pay it and GST saying if the
Agencies is not paying their
fairho using NMSU for example,
right? They had those $28
million dollar claims or $8
million worth of claims in one
year. They didn't have that.
amount of money probably in the
fund, so then.
The fund had to pay it and then
if there's a deficiency in the
fund for other claims are
required to pay those. We got to
give them the bar language, but
that's
An average of the last year or 2
years that they
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, these are
Adjustments above whatever you
see in the, the payout line in
their section 4 budget, you're
saying you can increase that.
Uh, because there were
unanticipated costs.
That weren't built into what you
appropriated. So when you
appropriate in section 4, you're
setting a cap.
On how much money from these
earmarked revenues that agencies
can spend and then you're giving
them authority through this
process.
To increase that either by 5% or
more than that by we usually
recommend a specific amount
rather than blanket authority in
some cases a blanket authority
like you saw with racing because
it's just hard to know what that
amount will be.
And you don't want to
Stop something that's like a
pass through, but this, this
essentially just comes out of
our reserves or cash money. This
comes out of the public
liability cash. That's correct,
Mr. Chairman.
OK.
Thank you.
Be appropriated what, 150
million into that fund this
year.
Well, there's appropriations
built into the agency-based
budgets.
That are pretty hefty increases.
There is
An additional 17 million in
recurring in section 8 to help
with that, the executive uh had
a recommendation to infuse it
with a
Uh, one time
Um, infusion of, of general fund
revenue.
the way House Bill 2 sits, we're
trying to take care of that
increased cost on a recurring
basis.
OK.
Pages were on 11. We were on 11.
12
As well with
So on page line 51 will will
recommend uh removing that when
you prepare house Bill 2
amendment.
What's the next page in line,
Emily.
The next page and line chair
members is going to be line 70
on page 17. This was just a
small technical change that
happened in HAFC.
It was just a rewarding of the
agency name to be corrected what
is in statute with the agency
name for the vocational
rehabilitation division.
the next change after that chair
members.
It's going to be online.
EDP 20, it's another Department
of Transportation, language.
Adjustment, um, it wasn't quite
in the LFC recommendation. It
was pending House Bill 3
negotiations, which is this is
including the language that
they, um,
The past.
And so again, that if you look
in the transportation budget,
you'll see additional line items
broken out that we have in
traditionally broken out. This
allows them to move money
between those, uh, but it will
be much more transparent because
you'll have a bar coming through
as opposed to an apartment just
doing it on its own.
Where you couldn't see that as a
legislature very easily.
Charles see Joey in the room,
but I know they made some pay
increases for engineers in order
to retain them, right? And then
they went in the negative for
this year, right?
We have those numbers in
I don't, I don't know how to, I
mean, they move money around
everywhere over there, right?
I mean we put maintenance money
last year, 80 million, and I
think they moved 10 million.
To the beautification and not
kept it for maintenance when
that was a legislative intent.
I mean
How do we
How do we tighten that, we might
want to tighten that language up
a little bit more. Well this
language, Mr. Chairman, on line
80 is where you would do that.
before
they would have broad authority
because all of those
Spending items were included in
the other cost category.
And so
They could move money around.
Now the other cost category is
being broken out into different
line items.
And then this is allowing them
to move money through a budget
adjustment, but if you didn't
want them to move money between
those line items you or not as
much, you can limit that.
through this line 80, so that
might be something to take a
closer look at, Mr. Chairman,
and then they've always had a
vacancy.
Saving vacancies at the end of
the year.
They've taken those vacancies,
and I think it was like 30
million or 40 million, and then
we never know where it went
after that.
And now they overspend on FTEs.
So
Uh, I want to see how they're
gonna adjust that, I mean.
This is just language, but I, I
just want to flag that for you.
I want to see.
Where they're at, I mean,
I agree they probably had to pay
their district engineer, my
engineer, she was gonna leave
cause she retired, but she's
good and you're not gonna find
another one that wants to go to
Grand, so.
Um
think that some of that, but I
wanted.
See where they really are inside
there.
FTE budget cause then they,
before they take that 35 million
and then they put it somewhere
else, but they would never hire
those, I think it was like 600
employees or something.
They were always short, so
that's something we can uh
See where they're at with their
current year budget, Mr.
Chairman, and ask them for a
budget projection.
OK.
was
on on that.
I know that each one of the
districts has a certain budget.
Do they
Do they ask for transfers within
that district or does it all
come up to the
Secretary, and he's the one that
Ashford.
All of that, I've always
wondered that how much control
those districts have on their
budget to do their work.
Mr. Chairman.
If they change.
was
High enough.
That they couldn't afford to
absorb that at the state level
without changing what's in
section 4, they would need to do
a
A budget adjustment request to
DFA and LFC.
If it was within, you know,
that's the control level is what
you see in section 4 of House
Bill 2.
Within that they've got
flexibility across districts to
be able to move that money
around. If it gets to be where
they don't, then they've got to
come and ask the DFA and LFC, we
need to move X amount of
contracts to other because of
this expense and that's what
I've always wondered if, if, if
there was a particular
rode in a district that
You know, needs, needs to be
planned and designed money.
And
Does that go directly to that
district to do that plan and
design money or does that just
flow into the big budget to say
plan and design, Mr. Chair flow
into the big budget and then the
department has the flexibility
to determine how to. So if you
do increase the budget for that,
it's kind of uh open and a
prayer it gets done, Mr. Chair,
if you wanted to do something
like that, we would recommend
that you have language inserted
in House Bill 2 that sets up an
earmark for a specific purpose.
So if you say,
2 million of the state road fund
is for
X study in District 5 for this
highway highway between these
two points, right.
You would need earmarked
language.
OK. Thank you.
Uh, I think the only thing for
me for language is maybe we
should look at blanket language
in the CYFD secretary right
there and I don't see a public
education secretary is
If something happens and they
cut beds, right? Do we need
language that they can move
money, general fund money if
there's a federal cut to the
agency.
In case we don't come into
session or for delayed coming
into session.
We're researching those issues
right now. I don't believe.
Trying to think about which CYFD
programs would fall under the
reconciliation versus the
domestic discretionary, which is
not part of reconciliation.
Uh, but we're researching that
right now.
Publiced would be like if
Congress decided to cut the
school lunch program, that would
be their biggest exposure.
Yeah I mean
Rather than come in, we may want
to be reactive to federal cuts
in in language and some.
Shape or form, I mean.
We know if they hit us with the
The Medicaid, it's about.
a billion dollars, right? If
they're just what they're
talking about now.
So we
something to think about as we
move forward.
Yes sir, Mr. Chairman.
year
Good question on 52.
Page 12
This, this, you know, very
deadly it says capital
expenditures on it.
Do we get to
See those capital expenditures
are they get to notify us.
Of those capital expenditures
and all.
Yes, that they would need to
submit a budget adjustment
request.
Uh, with that detail and then
the staff would review that and
we give you a report.
Uh, each month at LFC and you
can ask for that additional
detail if you see game and fish
doing that an adjustment.
Thank you.
OK.
Other questions.
Thank you Mr. Chairman Charles
we'll be setting up some
subcommittees, I think we worked
on them yesterday, so we'll
I get those up, Senator Stewart.
We do have an amendment for your
bill, right?
Ready when you are.
All right. Thank you so much,
Mr. Chairman.
Uh, this is Senate Bill 83.
It creates the innovation and
state government fund for state
agencies.
To crate master plans, many of
them are already done that, and
increased HC capacity to
implement climate change policy.
We really need skill, public
service to enforce uh
regulations, guide clean energy
projects create the solutions we
need.
So the New Mexico Innovation and
Government Act invests in our
state agencies, 7 of them.
Uh, to ensure we have the right
uh talent to lead these efforts.
So it's a non-reverting fund,
it's over a two-year uh fiscal
period.
Um, it's appropriated to of
course you're gonna, you're
gonna take out the last section,
but that shows you where the
appropriation goes before you
take it out.
Um
In the FIRs from the agencies,
and many of them said, I'll need
an FTE, um, this bill is written
so that uh these funding, the
funding that they would get
would be used, could be used for
FTEs.
Uh, on page 3D, uh, it requires
that the state agency that
receives the funding submits a
report and budget the DFA.
Uh, showing how the funds will
be expended.
Um, it also, uh, requests, uh,
this one is from the
accountability and Government
Act in case they're going to
change their program structure.
And 2 is to uh.
If they receive an appropriation
from the Chiround, um, that has
to be part of the report, so
just making sure that uh.
You all, LFC understands this.
So, um, I do have Adrian Ali
Avila here only for technical
purposes and I stand for
questions.
Thank you chair and thank you,
uh, madam.
Wrote him,
we just, we do have an
amendment. We do have an
amendment, yeah, so let's go to
the amendment. Can I have a
motion to opt the amendment for
discussion purposes, motion by 2
by Senator Padilla.
Uh, any objection to that
motion, seeing none.
Tell us about them a minute.
Um, yes, Mr. Chairman, I
understand the amendment just
takes the appropriation out of
the title and then it
It removes the uh
Last two sections, which are the
appropriation section.
Questions on the amendment.
And then can I have a motion to
adopt the amendment, so the
motion by Senator Gonzalez, 2nd
vice senator Padilla.
Any objection to that motion.
We're back on the bill. Let me
go to the audience. How many are
here to support?
Maybe I can get 3 in support.
You have how many on Zoom?
on Zoom anybody in opposition.
Just go to the room first and
bring in support.
Just lighting up there real
quick.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Travis Kellerman. I'm the senior
climate advisor at the
governor's office, and I stand
in support of this bill.
The innovation in government.
SB 83, it's really about 3 main
priorities for the governor.
accelerating our net zero
planning and reductions. This
includes modeling. We need more
state agency resources as
federal support waivers.
It also supports our climate
driven job creation, so the
executive order that went out
last year.
It targeted 2000 apprenticeships
across many clean energy
sectors including energy
transition jobs, decarbonization
in the oil and gas sector using
existing workers and resources.
This also allows us with the
grant support to unlock new
private and federal investment
dollars so this isn't just about
state money but bringing in new
money to New Mexico, especially
from the private markets.
It's time to build economic
resilience here in the state.
This agency support allows us to
take on bold new climate action.
And really look at what the new
economy brings New Mexico.
We have an opportunity to create
new emission reduction models,
not just for New Mexico, but
these scale outside beyond our
state borders.
New Mexico has a very important
role to play in global energy.
And what we do here matters for
greenhouse gas reductions, not
just in the state but around the
world.
I urge your support. Thank you.
The morning chair and members of
the Senate Finance Committee. My
name is Taren Villa. I am from
the public of Heus and I serve
as a registered lobbyist for New
Mexico Native vote. The Mexico
native vote is strongly in
support of Senate Bill 83, uh,
we believe that technical
assistance and a streamlined
version of Master plans as
necessary to achieve the state's
goals to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and move us towards
net zero. Senate Bill 83 also
supports a more comprehensive
and strategic approach to
what you all have been working
on during this session, which is
advancing Senate Bill 84848 and
49, uh, for
clean energy transition jobs and
directly, uh, many oil, gas, and
other related um industries have
impacted low low income
communities and those in
historically impacted places. So
Senate Bill 83 helps to bridge
that gap. So we had, uh, we ask
and urge her to uh a do pass on
incentive.
83. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chair,
senators, my name is Anna Lindon
Weller. I am the senior clean
energy policy advisor for
Western Resource advocates, um,
and until recently I used to
work at the state at Mnerd and
I'm here in support of SB 83. SB
83 provides a pretty rare thing,
dedicated and flexible funding
for state agencies to direct
resources toward one of the
central challenges of the
century.
Mitigating, adapting to and
reducing the effects of climate
change.
As I said, I was until recently
in an employee of one of the
agencies that would receive
funding under this bill. And
when I served the state there, I
saw the agency's effort to
cobble together the necessary
resources and employee time to
answer this challenge and you
all were extremely helpful in
creating the opportunity for
Emner to do that, but
SB 83 centers the challenge in
the agency's budget and if
budgets are policy documents,
which I believe you all believe
they are, and therefore their
moral documents too then this
legislator should pass SB 83 and
the year's budget should fund
the hardworking, innovative and
committed staff at these
agencies who will find the new
right ways to approach this
generational challenge. Thank
you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you, we're gonna go to
Zoom now Carl, you're our first
person.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, thank
you for your time this morning.
My name is Carl Yullibari. I am
the former director of the
Energy Smart Academy at Santa Fe
Community College, and I am now
operating as an energy
efficiency consultant and I'm
still continuing to work with
the program to to develop
curriculum and marketing and
outreach for potential training
for energy auditor heat pump,
water heater, heat pump, and
other emerging trainings
training solutions for the state
of New Mexico in early June.
2024, the Santa Fe Community
College had an opportunity to
work alongside the state energy
office to draft and submit an
application to the Department of
Energy for energy auditor
training grant for approximately
1.4 million. We worked on this
grant and program development
for approximately 5 months, and
we were ultimately approved by
DOE just before the end of the
calendar year.
Unfortunately, as we are all
aware, the new administration
has halted the disbursement of
all of the funding for grants
such as this that provide the
resources that address the
climate concerns for their
nation.
We are now looking to the state
of New Mexico to continue to
support the efforts that are
already in progress that will
help develop a skilled, clean
energy workforce and provide
good paying jobs for our
communities across the state. In
closing, I urge you to vote in
favor of Senate Bill 83. Thank
you for your time.
Thank you, James, you're next.
Morning, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee. I'm James Poviwa.
I am the vice chair of the
sustainable Economy Task Force
and chair of its community
advisory council. The task force
and council were created by
legislation in 2020 with the
charge of creating a long term
plan for our state to transition
to a sustainable economy. The
task force is administratively
attached to the economic
development department as a
state, we will not achieve this
important initiative unless our
state agency.
have the resources they need to
accomplish the task. SB 83, the
innovation and state government
fund will strengthen state
capacity, equipping agencies
with the resources and expertise
needed to support clean energy
initiatives, a key element to
laying the groundwork for a
sustainable economy, one in
which all New Mexicans thrive
and our air, land and water are
protected. This concludes my
comments. Thank you to the
sponsor, Senator Stewart, and I
urge the committee members to
vote in favor and do.
SB 83.
Thank you.
And you're next, the last one.
Good good morning, Chairman and
committee members. My name is
Anne Lin Hall, and I'm here
today to ask your support of SB
83. I am the CEO of Prosperity
Works. We have been engaged with
state agencies over the last
several years on the
implementation of the Community
Energy efficiency block grant,
which passed this legislature in
2022. We worked with two
different municipalities to
apply for these funds to bring
much needed energy efficiency
into disadvantaged households.
The first announcement on awards
from this fund were made last
March. It took almost a year.
From award announcements to get
contracts out last week, and the
critical work that this
legislature authorized in 2022
hasn't yet started. Our state
agencies need support, like what
is offered in SB 83 to get
critical.
Uh, we lost you.
OK.
Questions from committee
members.
Stein.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and Madam
Purte. Good morning, Adrian.
Um, I'm looking at the bill and
I'm just seeing one thing that
feels like it's missing to me,
which is the general services
department.
And the General Services
department of the state owns and
manages our 800 state buildings,
millions of square feet.
There was an effort a few years
ago with some capital, we did a,
a, uh, none of them, by the way,
with the exception of a small
handful of use renewable energy.
to power those buildings. And so
there was an effort a few years
ago to do, to do some of that
here in Santa Fe, Mr. Chairman,
which I do believe achieved
seriously good utility savings.
That would be, this would be a
perfect bill to include the
general services department.
To make sure we're looking at
energy efficiency across our 800
state buildings.
If we're striving for zero
emissions in state government.
So Madam Chairman, uh, sorry,
Mr. Chair, Madam Protem, in the
bill, obviously we had
appropriations where we
designated money to specific
departments. We've taken that
out. I'm wondering is if in
House Bill 2,
We, we appropriate it there by
department.
That's question one.
Uh, Mr. Chairman.
Probably Adrian could answer
this.
You know, uh,
That's a good suggestion, GSD
but the appropriators could do
that. They could put money
towards that also.
Well, Mr. Chair, in the bill,
um, approach him, it actually
lists them by department, how
much we're giving them. It
enumerates them, but we're
taking that out on the
appropriation. So it kind of
begs the question, is that
language in the budget? If it's
not in the budget, the bill as
written says it can be, you
know, funding can go to
departments, in which case they
could qualify for it. If it's
enumerated in the budget by
department then.
They might not have that
ability, so Adrian, can you
speak to that?
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator
Steinborn, so in striking the
transfer and the appropriation,
the intent if you all decide to
pass this bill would be to
incorporate it into the budget.
And GST isn't delineated, but if
you all wanted to up this to 11
million, for example, then you
can include GST as receiving an
extra million or more, that
that's a decision point for you
all.
I see. And Mr. Chair, so this is
calibrated for $10 million as
the as the fund says. Well, I
will just say, you know, it'd be
interesting to have a
conversation with Mr. Kellerman
over there, but, you know, if
you look at the totality of
You know, carbon emissions, um,
needs, I think GST would be
right up there. I mean,
800 buildings, they're probably
in a fleet of vehicles they're
probably dealing with more
emission issues and many state
agencies. So I think we should
include them in this.
I'll just
Leave it at that, ma'am, uh,
sorry, ma'am prote it sounds
like you would be friendly of
that. It's just really a budget
issue.
Mm
Uh, Mr. Chairman, yes. Just a
budget issue, you can do that.
And thanks for mentioning that,
that, uh, we missed that. Yeah,
well, I was Mr. Chair, it was a
bill I carried years ago. Try to
get the state to move towards
that, that little bill didn't
get as far as I would have
liked.
But, it's glad we did it in
Santa Fe, but, but we should be
doing it statewide. So thank
you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
Senator.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair and
Madam Protem, just a question
on, so just the structure of the
way the funds will be used, um.
So give me an example of what a
project would look like, uh, and
I'll just throw out an agency,
um.
You know, the public regulation
commission, what might they do
that would achieve the goals of
what you're trying to do here.
So, Mr. Chairman, you've got
FIRs from all of these agencies.
I don't know if I have the PRC.
I have several others that you'd
like to,
um, the funding through this
bill will enable
Workforce solutions to properly
serve all partners who seek to
bring federal and private
funding to our state by ensuring
a good fit and maximizing the
use of existing workforce
resources.
Uh, they are focused on
firefighters.
We need to train them, we need
to get them here. Uh, we need to
do a lot of work around that and
the inner secretary designee has
said the same thing. They, uh,
FIR says that's, that's how they
could use these funds and that
they need them.
Chair and pro tem, I, yeah, so I
think people hear the term
climate change and climate this
then, you know, um, those are
more on the ground real things
that you're proposing there that
would potentially be done by the
two that you just were able to
cite, is that correct?
Uh, Mr. Chairman, you know,
mitigating the impacts of
climate change is part of our
process here. So, you know, we,
last year, I mean, unbelievable.
How much damage to New Mexico
land and water uh flooding in
Roswell, the fires in Rio so up
north, so we've got a lot of
work to do, and we have to
prepare for the future, um.
You know
The scientists are saying that
New Mexico is one of the hottest
places in the in the US and
they're saying that the degrees
it's going up here is 5 to 7
degrees by the end of the
century.
I mean, we're gonna be burning
everything up if we don't
mitigate and if we're not
prepared. So these agencies have
been under the governor's
executive order for 6 years, and
they are focused on climate
change in many different ways.
So, you just look at the FIRs,
they all talk about how they'll
use the money.
Thank you, Chair, and um.
I just didn't want that to get
lost in, you know, people hear
certain verbiage and terms and
they get all weirded out with
whatever, you know, but these
are actual real projects with uh
efforts that aren't necessarily
trying to stop something or
whatever, they're trying to be
proactive, if you will. So that
was one of the questions I
wanted to make sure you had an
opportunity to Chairman, if you
look at page 2,
Uh, money in the fund can be
appropriated as a stage
agencies, the number 2 implement
sustainable economic policies.
So that's also part of this.
OK, thank you. Um, and then the
second question I had, uh, chair
and Protem is.
To you and I individually, a
million dollars is a lot of
money.
I'm just, is that really enough
money to do what you're
proposing here in each one of
these so you.
Uh, two agencies and in the uh
2.5 range and
You know, 5 or more in the 5 in
the $1 million can they actually
do their work with that kind of
money.
Mr. Chairman, all of the FIRs
are saying they can.
OK, just wanted to give you an
opportunity to explain it, but
thanks.
Inner trail.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you, Senator, for bringing
this forward and Adrian, it's
always nice to see you down
there. Your, um, incredibly
smart. So on um
Just want to point out a couple
of things that I think are
unusual. One thing that's
unusual, and that's on page 2.
I think it's great. Lines 17
through 25 and then page 3 lines
1 through 4 where this bill
makes it really clear that if
the budget
Doesn't have enough money that
this fund can be used for that
money. That's unusual. I'll have
to say I don't think I've ever
seen that in legislation, and
usually, uh, drafters and uh
Legislators are trying to
protect their funds, and you've
done just the opposite here. So
I just want to say thank you for
that. I think that's an
important measure, um, on page 3
though, line 16. I'm a little
confused because I, for some
reason, I'm
I'm seeing that the fund is
called the Innovation and State
Government Fund, what is this
results and opportunity program
fund. Is that something else?
Mr. Chairman, Senator Trujillo.
That's the growth fund. So this
is a report from these agencies
because we've also funded them
through the government
opportunities responsibility.
So this is just to, if you're
gonna give a report to LFC.
Let's, let's have it on the
things that matter, so.
Count billing government, it's
to grow and then it's the
projects themselves. Madam
Chair, thank you for that
clarification. Appreciate it.
In Brent.
Miss German.
And protes could see you, um.
A couple of questions.
These are going to all these
different departments. Why
didn't they just request this
increase in their budget.
to do this? Do we really need a
bill, a law that says you got to
spend this money this way.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, you know, I,
I'm not part of the
appropriations process. I can't
tell you all the ins and outs of
why state agencies ask for
certain money and not other
money.
Um, I'm pretty sure that state
agencies have asked for more
money than we are going to give
them.
Uh, so, um,
You know, it, it, it's part of
the effort that I think we're
not elevating enough um to try
to mitigate and look at measures
to reduce the impacts on New
Mexico of climate change.
And although these agencies are
under the governor's executive
order, and they've all got
programs, 3 of them I think have
climate bureaus, supposed to be
working together. I don't think
we've given them enough money to
do that kind of work.
And so that is the purpose of
the innovation Government Act.
Mm
And I just trying to figure out
why it wasn't just funded
through through their agency.
Budgets and then have some
language in there, but.
Maybe that's the way we'll
actually
but
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Steinbor for
the 2nd time.
For the 2nd time, Mr. Chair, uh,
Madam Prote. So actually,
I mean, I know what you said
about, I'm gonna go back to GSD.
We actually don't need to
increase it for GST to still be
eligible, right?
I mean
We could just, if GSD wanted to
apply for the, it doesn't really
kind of say that, it just says
if an agency receives money.
Unless I'm missing the part
about them applying for the
money.
But I guess it's a given they
would apply the DFA for the
funds. Is that how this would
work, Mr. Chair.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator
Steinborn, so that's a decision
for you all, right? Either you
will maintain the power of
appropriation and you designate
this is how much each one of you
is gonna get or you defer that
choice making to the executive.
Mr. Chair, the bill right now
doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't
have that piece at all. It just
says DFA will manage it.
And then it says, if an agency
receives it. So,
I don't know that we need to
have language. Um, I guess the
executive has an idea of where
they want it to go. Having said
that, again, back to um just
trying to figure out the, the,
the general Services Division
piece, they would just, they can
just apply the DFA and get the
funds, even if it's whatever
funding level it is.
Um, without having to increase
it by a million dollars. That's
really my point.
So, Mr. Chairman, we, you know,
we wrote the bill.
Uh, because we wanted to focus
on these agencies that
are working on mitigating
climate impacts and
So
But you're the appropriators
when you put it in the budget,
if you put it in the budget, you
can determine something
different.
You're saying man man prote
chair, there's a budget here,
the 10 million.
It's kind of earmarked in a way.
Within the executive branch,
they know how they want to spend
it, got it. So we really should
add more money if we want GST to
have.
Yes,
got it.
Thank you, Mr.
Thank you.
Any other questions, none,
what's a pleasure of the
committee.
A motion for due pass by Senator
Gonzalez, seconded by Senator
Trujil, what do you call it up.
Senator Brent,
Senator Brandt votes no. Senator
Campos. Senator Campos votes
yes. Senator Gonzalez. Senator
Gonzalez votes yes, Senator
Lanier. Senator Lanier votes no.
Senator Padilla. Senator Padilla
Bosender Steinborn. Senator
Steinborn votes yes. Senator
Tobiasin.
Senator Tobiasson votes no
Senator Trujillo. Senator
Trujillo votes yes, Senator
Woods.
Senator Shindo.
said Emios. Senator Munoz votes
yes, we have a due pass, 6 in
the affirmative, 3 in the
negative.
Thank you so much Mr. Chairman.
Senator Cabo I see and other
sponsors in the room. Why don't
you do 1:13.
mended up there.
So we're gonna do yours next.
We're ready when you are
senator. Thank you very much,
Mr. Chair, members of the Senate
Finance Committee, in essence,
Senate Bill 113 is amended.
Uh, extending the life of 5
boards, uh.
Uh, pursuant to the provisions
of the Sunset Act and in
essence, uh, within that, uh,
the 5 boards.
Uh, Board of barbers and
cosmetologists, board of nursing
Home Administration Board of
Landscape architects.
Water quality uh control
commission and cold surface
Mining Commission, uh, Mr.
Chairman, members of the Senate
Finance Committee, this, uh,
started out is the uh Senator
Smika.
Yes.
But
Uh, soreness, is that a little
bit better thank you.
Uh, so in essence, Mr. Chair,
members of the Senate Finance
Committee, this, uh, started out
as a legislative finance
committee, um, supported Bill
and within that, one of the
amendments indicates that this
would go from 6 to 10 years in
terms of working directly with
uh these particular uh boards
and commissions. That's
basically what it does, Mr.
Chair, members of Senate Finance
Committee.
OK, anybody in the audience in
support.
Anybody in opposition.
And when I zoom.
Questions from committee members
while we're waiting for the one
person.
trio.
do you want the sunset.
Mr. Chairman, Senator, thank you
for bringing this forward.
I spent 13 years of my career
waiting for these bills to go
into the Senate.
Gonzalez has carried them.
It was the basis of much of the
work that we did to keep boards
and commissions functioning. I'm
disappointed to see that there's
no boards and commissions here.
Um, because that was exactly
what I would be told if I had
one person missing and do they
care enough to have these
extended, it seems to me they
could show up and answer some of
our questions, but I will not
hold that against you, Senator.
I just will say that those
boards are being extended. The
purpose of the sunset and the
sun, you know, the sunset Act.
was to give these boards an
opportunity to update their
statutes.
And I've gotten calls from the
cosmetology board frantically
asking me to carry some
legislation to update their
statutes to remove hours to make
it more consistent with other
states, and I've tried to direct
them back, um, to you, Senator.
So I, I think, you know, this
whole process that we go through
of a sunset where we're just
kind of ticking off the boxes,
and we continue to extend them
without really having them come
in and
justify the work that they're
doing, give us an opportunity to
ask questions and update their
statutes as needed, so I'll just
leave it at that, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
I think um she's in the room, so
then plan on that for next time
we have this every year we have
a sunset bill, uh, so I plan on
reviewing some of those.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Yes,
I'll go ahead I'll make note of
that.
See no other center brand.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator, uh,
first of all, I just want to
know what the Senator Trujillo
said.
Um, you know,
how many times I voted on
extending these.
Like board of landscape
architects.
We even knew we had a board of
landscape architects.
I didn't
You know, do they even meet?
Do they do anything?
You know
So Mr. Chairman, uh,
Senator Brent, and I don't know
if there's anyone here from the
uh the uh landscape architects,
uh, but they do meet, they
continue to go ahead and work,
uh, on what their organization's
intent is, uh, beyond that, if
they're not available uh right
now I would indicate that uh
with all of the boards that have
been recommended.
To continue to extend, if you
will, their life, if you will,
in the process, uh, it was my
understanding they do me, they
do, uh, comply with what the
regulations are, and uh that's
uh the extent that
knowledge I have of that, uh,
particular board at this time.
You know if there's
Is our landscape architect.
Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee, my name is Danny
Mackie, a registered lobbyist,
uh, representing the landscape
architects Association, the
landscape architect uh does meet
uh uh a quarterly basis they
and license all landscape
architects, they're the ones
that work on the projects that
uh Capital Ola go out to build a
park, uh, work on meetings and
um and design all the features
and around public spaces. So uh
thank you for this time and.
We, uh, support this bill.
Mr. Chairman Senator, thank you
and, and just.
And we keep doing these without
really any answers. I think the
reason that we do these is
sunset clauses is so that when
we uh
breed them here. We can
actually.
Um
You know what they're doing and
Decide whether we need to keep
it or not.
Um,
I didn't know my landscaper
needed a a license, so I guess I
know now. I should have because
we require licensing for
everyone.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Interesting.
That's it, see no further
questions, can have a motion
from the committee.
A motion for Dupas' second bye.
Senator Trujil, second by
Senator Padilla.
Senator Brent. No. Senator
Brandt votes no. Senator Campos.
Senator Campos votes, yes,
Senator Gonzalez.
Senator Lanier
Senator Lanier votes no. Senator
Padilla.
Senator Padilla Boccia, Senator
Steinborn.
Senator Steinborn votes yes,
Senator Tobiasin. Senator
Tobiasson votes no senator to
you.
Senator Trujillo Bots, Senator
Woods.
Senator Chando, Senator Munoz.
Mm
There's not boxing music.
Ladies and gentlemen
Yes.
Senator Munoz votes, yes, we
have a due past 5 in the
affirmative, 3 in the negative.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the Senate Finance Committee.
Senator Figueroa.
Thank you Mr. Chair and
committee.
Um, Senate Bill 387 makes two
changes to our community school
statutes.
It has no fiscal impact
according to the physical impact
report, but the words are
fiscally important on page 4,
line 3, it adds two words up to.
These are very important for the
PED to be allowed to disperse
funds in smaller increments when
our community schools fund pot
of money is low.
Um, instead of having to
disperse money in only $150,000
increments. This allows them to
disperse it in smaller
increments, the coalition of
community schools is on board
and supports this as this would
allow disbursement.
Um, to a broader array of our
community schools. Uh, the other
new language is also on page 4,
line 21. It's renaming the
Community Schools Memorial Fund
as the Doctor Jeannie Oakes.
Memorial fund community schools
Memorial Fund in honor of her
work in New Mexico and across
the country in building
community schools.
With that
Stand for questions.
OK, thank you very much, uh,
Senator Fiora, we're moving
along, we're gonna go ahead and
go to um
The individuals in the audience,
if there is anyone in favor of
this particular measure.
Please raise your hands, uh,
let's see, we have a couple, 3,
any opposed.
OK, so what we're gonna do is go
ahead and take the 3 for about a
minute of testimony, if you will
come forward, uh, take the mic,
identify yourself, make your
statement.
And then after we do that,
because we don't have anyone.
Uh, opposed here anyone online?
And support, uh, we're just
gonna go ahead and take the 3
that are here. Uh, there's, uh,
let the record reflect that
there are 2 also in support of
this particular measure. We
don't have anyone who is
opposing that. Please proceed,
identify yourself, make your
statements. Uh, my name's Edward
Webster. I am the government
relations director with NEA in
New Mexico.
NEA New Mexico supports this
bill and we thank Senator
Figueroa for bringing it
forward, um, we believe the
community schools are an
opportunity to reimagine public
education in our state by
centering the voices of
students, families, their
educators, and creating a space
for a shared leadership and
decision making in schools all
across New Mexico. Please vote
yes on SB 387. Thank you. Thank
you very much. The next please.
Good morning chair members of
the committee. My name is Alison
Riley, public policy director
with the New Mexico Chamber of
Commerce here in strong support
of this bill.
This legislation is a critical
step towards transforming our
public schools into vibrant
community hubs or empowering
schools to implement programs
that address academic and
non-academic needs. It offers
the flexibility to redesign
curriculum so the schools can
better support student
achievement, family engagement,
and overall community
well-being.
The bill also mandates rigorous
evaluation and professional
development, ensuring that these
community school initiatives are
effective and sustainable.
Senate Bill 387 will not only
improve educational outcomes,
but also contribute to broader
economic and social development
of New Mexico. Thank you.
Thank you very much. The next,
and that'll be the last, uh, in
terms of testimony, and then
we're gonna be going to
questions from the committee.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Robert Apodaka. I'm the lobbyist
for the, um, communities and
schools in Mexico and uh and so
we, um, with the CIS and I warn
a number of the schools in Santa
Fe having huge changes in the
outcomes of our, of our
students, um, and, and Swift,
uh, we're working, uh, statewide
to develop some of the capacity
so we are totally in support. We
do see that the uh community
schools has uh huge outcomes and
positive ways for our community
and our kids. Thank you.
Thank you very much for the uh
the testimony, and again, uh we
don't have anyone in opposition
to this particular measure. Now
we're going to questions from
the committee. We're going to
Senator Trujillo, please.
Thank you. um, Mr. Chairman and
Senator, thank you for bringing
this forward. Um, I just wanna
say thank you for changing it to
honor immy Oaks.
I had the pleasure of speaking
with her during my primary, um,
just a week before she passed
away, and she was still
incredibly passionate about
public education. She maintained
her focus on ensuring that New
Mexico continued to move
forward, and it was really
encouraging conversation, so I
appreciate um that you've uh
taken this step.
To, uh, honor her in that way.
Uh, I do have a question about
this and and I'm sorry that I
don't know, but do you have to
be designated as a community
school in order to get these
funds.
Mr. Chair and Senator, yes.
Thank you, um, Mr. Chairman, uh,
Senator, thank you for that. Um,
I know we have, uh, communities
in schools, which is a nonprofit
organization that provides
tremendous support for our
families and our students, and
they do great work and I know
they do that work in many of our
schools which are not designated
as community schools, um, but,
uh, appreciate this work and I
will stand in strong support of
your bill. Thank you. Thank you
very much.
Senator Trujillo, is there any
additional comments, any, uh,

Senate Finance Committee.

Senator Sindo
Senator Shando votes yes.
Senator Munoz.
We have a due past 7 in the
affirmative, 2 in the negative.
Senator Figueroa by vote again
of 7 to.
7 to 7 to 2, uh committee
substitute for Senate Bill 387
has duly passed the Senate
Finance Committee.
I'm turning it back then to our
vice chair, Senator Sindo.
Senator Shino, please.
Mhm
Mm
69.
16
Mm
Give me a second.
Mhm
OK, Senator Branley.
Do we have a substitute?
We do, Mr. Chairman, you have a
committee sub before you, I
believe.
My book
She's fascinating right now.
Mr. Chairman, while you review
that, uh, committee substitute,
I would like to request that,
that Senator Steinborn have to
lock up his cell phone and this
phone-free case, and if he
chooses to unlock it, you would
hold the magnetic unlock key on
your desk.
Mr. Chairman members
That's right after this, after
this hearing.
Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee, um, according to the
NEA, there's this as a uh uh a
drastic statistic that 90% of
teachers are advocating for
restricting cell phone use
during instructional time, 97%
of students use their phone
during classroom hours and
that's what we're here to push
back on this. We know that most
kindergartens through 12th
graders have, uh, schools have
cell phone policies already in
place, but because they are
difficult to enforce, they're
just simply not.
And so since 2023, legislation
to regulate cell phone use has
been introduced in 27 states in
2024, at least 4 of those states
encouraged legislation that was
encouraging the use of magnetic
or some sort of locked up device
pouches. So like SB 11, most
legislation leaves the details
and the specifics up to
individual school districts, um,
to decide exactly what kind of
policy works best for this
classroom, and your committee
said, we'll provide
detailed guidance from PED. I'm
sorry, to, uh, provide guidance
on what the the details of those
policies may look like, and it
would be PED then that
administered the funding to
provide any sort of magnetic or
any sort of locked devices that
a school chooses to use should
their policy implement some sort
of locked device on there.
I would refer you to page 3 of
the LESC analyst, and it lists
several New Mexico schools that
already have uh adopted policies
and a state that's desperately
seeking improvements to
proficiency scores and where
teachers are prioritizing cell
phone addiction as their number
one distractor in classrooms,
and also his teen mental health
crisis rolls on the rates of
depression, anxiety, and
self-harm continue to rise. We
are not helpless and the
legislator is coming in to
incentivize.
high school districts and their
fight to get the focus back in
the classroom and off their cell
phones. I'll stand for any
questions, Mr. Chair.
Yeah.
Mr.
that
2030.
Then it'll be 11.
All righty.
So second bite any opposition to
the motion.
You know
We
On the up.
Is any questions. I do want to
note that there were two similar
bills out there, um, uh, Senator
Mo Maestas has joined in on this
bill. He may be joining us
momentarily, but we now have
just one single bill that's
before you today, Mr. Chair.
Correct.
Great. Any questions from the uh
Senator Trujil.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Senator for bringing this
forward. Our district here in
Santa Fe has taken this action
and um I agree teachers are
excited to have that
opportunity. I wanna just, I, I
don't have a question. I do want
to just thank you for page 3,
paragraph C, which and which
acknowledges that some of our
students use wireless devices
for communication.
And I appreciate that you've
added this in there. So thank
you for that.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, we
want to add flexibility for both
teachers. We recognize that
technology advances quickly, and
the idea is just to keep them
off undistracting apps or
whatnot, so thank you. Thank
you, Senator Len.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good
morning. Good morning. How are
you, Senator. I just have a
couple of questions for you. One
of them is
Was the parents involved in this
decision making at all. In other
words, did the, the parents have
anything to do with this bill?
You know, Mr. Chairman, members
of the committee, this has
received unanimous support. I
think my biggest oppositions uh
comes from my daughters, 15 and
16, they may be calling in an
opposition today, in fact, we
did, I did have a couple emails
from concerned parents and
mainly their expression is there
are worried that their child
can't reach out in the case of
an emergency. In many cases, the
cell phone policy can say just
put it up, leave it out. You
can't be on your phone during
classrooms. If they uh uh decide
to adopt.
A pretty strict policy like the
Tao school district has and
actually have locked up uh
pouches, many of these pouches
can be cut or some of this, this
is just one of many brands. Some
of them can actually be an
emergency situation ripped apart
so that you can access that cell
phone, um, and, and I, and I,
and I can understand that
concern. Now for the, the
parents that are just saying,
well, I need to continue to have
contact, continued contact with
my child during a classroom
hours, I respectfully
push back as a mother with kids
in school, my time can wait for
passing periods where they can
access their phone, lunch breaks
before or after school, but um
the the reality is, is that any
disruptions regardless of who it
who it comes from is a
disruption, uh, from the teacher
in classroom hours.
Mr. Chair, I
Senator Bran Brantly, I don't, I
don't want to give away my age
too much.
But when I started teaching,
there was no such thing as a
cell phone and it will make a
difference. I just know that
that we tried to implement some
things in Aztec and the biggest
push pushback wasn't even really
from the students as much as it
was from the parents because and
this is a conversation.
My wife's on a plane right now,
so I can say this.
We had this conversation years
ago with my daughters.
And I didn't want them to even
be able to take theirs.
cell phones to school because I
was a school teacher.
And she's like, when I want to
text my daughter, I want her to
answer.
And so that came from my own
family, so I, I think it's a
great bill and I really
appreciate you bringing it
forward and um I think with a
little bit of tweaking it's
gonna be uh very effective for
school teachers, I really do.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Senator Steinborn.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and
Senator, good morning. Um, so I
happen to have been in education
when you put this bill in the
first time. So I see a couple of
major changes here. Number one,
Seems like, tell me if I'm wrong
initially, it was to provide
funding for districts.
To have these devices, right?
Um
That seems to be out of the bill
at this point. It's just really
about creating policy by school
districts, is that right?
Mr. Chairman, Senator Steinborn,
we stripped the appropriation
just before it got here and we
are working to get it into the
budget and so no, there's still
a fight to get the funding uh
for what we'll call a pilot
program of any bags that they
may want to purchase.
But please note that there has
been some language change on
here instead of it just being an
open-ended, if you adopt policy,
you're allowed to access this
funding, we are saying you need
to adopt a policy. It's just
very open-ended and how loose
that policy is, but every school
district is going to have some
sort of policy they have to
adopt and PED will provide a
template or a guideline on the
minimums of what that looks
like. Thank you, Chair, Senator,
and that was the second question
I wanted to ask. So yeah.
Obviously now, I remember in the
first committee it was
May encourage, I think the word
was encouraged, but anyway, yeah
though, but you made a decision
that
This has to happen, right? If
I'm understanding this right,
this is a requirement and the
language is just slightly,
slightly ambiguous, knowing the
history a little bit.
Um
On page 2
Lane 7. The department shall
issue guidelines for the minimum
requirements for a policy,
including a policy that shall
Prohibit a student.
From using a wireless device.
So,
We're saying that's a minimum
standard. So what we are saying
there is that
That that all schools shall
prohibit the use of cell phones
other than those exceptions.
Or is there any wiggle room
flexibility for a school
district to not include that
requirement.
Mr. Chairman Senator Steinborn,
we are saying that every
district shall create a, create
a policy that prohibits use
from, from using your cell phone
just during those instructional
hours with the exception that
for it needed to be if you see
section C, that there are going
to be allowances that if they
need to access the phone for
instructional purposes, they may
do so. So yeah, so uh Mr. Chair,
Senator, so, so absolutely, if
this were to become law.
Every district would prohibit
the use of cell phones outside
of the exception.
That's fair to say, Mr.
Chairman, Senator Steinborg, if
this were to become law, we're
prohibiting the use of cell
phones without exceptions that
can be identified by a district.
And so let's say they took the
extreme, the most extreme by
actually locking those phones
up. They, they could simply just
say keep it in your backpack,
and that's an acceptable policy
that I think many districts
have. Let's say they actually
went to the extreme of having
locked devices, they can make
allowances for when they can
unlock those devices.
Many districts who have gone to
that extreme have keys on, not
just the teacher's desk, but in
hallways, cafeterias, on the
school bus, if they forget to
unlock their phone, whatever it
may be, so that it's just during
those classroom instructional
hours, it has to be put up.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Um
I support the bill. I, I think
this is some serious tough love.
I mean, this, this is tough.
Uh, because phones are addictive
devices. They're designed to be
addictive.
They're very harmful.
Um
In a variety of ways when
abused. So for everybody, not
just students, but particularly
for young people.
So I think
I think this will be really
interesting.
Um, to see how this works, but
I, I, I, uh, commend you for
bringing it forward. I think
it's helpful. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
You in a deal.
Uh thank you, Chair and thank
you, Senator. Um, I also support
the legislation for another
reason that I don't think that I
necessarily heard today, but,
um, and I'm a large employer
here in New Mexico, Texas,
Kentucky, and Rhode Island, and
I will tell you that um these
these things and these skills
that and these habits that we
develop, uh, that the children
develop when they're in school,
they take that into the world of
work later. So if you're uh
willing to help me stop cell
phone work, cell phone usage in
my call centers. I'd love to
work with you on that.
That's a whole other set of
issues, uh, but I, I, I like it
because, yeah, you know, we
really should have the as much
directed focus uh when the
children are in the classroom.
They're there for a particular
purpose and a particular reason.
So I love that, that um
byproduct of this legislation,
but I also love the byproduct
and the secondary and tertiary
benefits, then I, I feel like um
children will then take that
into the rest of their life.
You know, I've seen kiddos in,
in my church.
Just going to town on that cell
phone and you know that's not
what they're sitting there in
church for. Um, in my building,
in my businesses and stuff, and
I just, um, I feel like this is
something that's going to be a
move in the right direction. So
I support that. Um, I guess I'm
also surprised because um this
is a requirement that you're
proposing here.
And I I think I've heard you
oppose multiple other
requirements we try to put in
place here. So why why is this
one different?
Mr. Chairman, Senator Padde, I
appreciate Senator Steinborn,
stressing the maize and shells
in the conversations that we've
had before and what that does. I
think, um, I will tell you that
this, I mentioned that this is
the merging of two bills between
mine and Senator Maestus's bill.
The original draft of this left
it completely open-ended, that
should a district adopt the
policy, we will fund it. And in
conversations with both PED and
Senator Maestas, and since that
realizing, recognizing.
the number of school districts
who already have met that
standard, including every school
district that I talked to in, in
my own Senate district.
I, I recognize the importance.
I'll tell you it's important to
me because I mentioned I'm the
mother of teenage girls.
In an area they were raised
where they didn't even have cell
phone service, and I will tell
you that it is a real addiction
when I have to continually
remind my own daughters, put
that cell phone away at the
table. I could only imagine the
struggles that teachers are
facing in the classroom. It's a
real addiction. They average,
they say that the average
teenager is now spending 5 hours
a day on their cell phone. And
so for teachers that are coming
in, I rarely, as you also know,
have the teachers unions stand
up in support of some of my
bills. But for
to say this is the number one
distractor in classrooms, I
think as parents, I think as
teachers and administrators, and
I hope as legislators, we can
come back and fight back against
a generation of addicts and how
we create a a better workforce
as they move forward to know
that there is a time and place,
classroom time, isn't it?
Aunt Crystal's dinner table,
isn't it? And, and nor is your
place of work. Well, thank you,
chair, and I do support it, um.
I, uh, I just really feel like
we, we need to take, see the
other benefits down the road. So
thank you.
Senator Gonzalez.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman.
I, um, really don't have a
question. I might, but
permission.
Uh, we have some students in the
back and uh maybe we could um
stand.
We do have students in the
audience so you guys can stand,
we recognize.
We'll we'll get to that one.
Oh, very well, uh, Mr. Chairman,
uh, sometimes we have students
and
They'll sit for a while and
they'll.
Of stand up and leave and we
don't get a chance to recognize
them, so.
Thank you for being here today.
Um
Mr. Chairman, uh, what I like to
do is, um,
To um
As my comment.
To, uh
The proposed legislation here is
um
I'll even take it a step
further.
And uh there's a school that has
been uh.
Organized a program in Florida
and one in Denver and in Taos,
it's the same one.
And what this is is um.
Uh, it's geared supposedly to
ages like 16 to 35.
And this our individuals that
have completely lost their
ability to socialize because of
the addiction.
But um, and so what they do here
is just try to work with them to
how to really.
Get off it
To because it is an addiction.
And the remedies and how they
work with this, you know, to
assist.
But uh where I'm going with this
is um.
Uh, one of our deputy
secretaries.
And their family, they take a
trip up to Red River and the
rule is they put all their.
Electronics in a basket.
And what he was telling me, this
is the deputy secretary.
The 2nd day that they were
there, he had an anxiety attack.
You know, and I think that is
very real, you know, with uh
with our students also.
So I think we're going to have
to be prepared to, you know, um.
At least the awareness of those
possibilities can happen, you
know, in the classroom or with
individuals.
You know how is it going to be
handled?
And I think it's very important
because I really think we're
there.
And uh you take a walk to the
plaza here in Santa Fe.
A miracle someone doesn't get
hit, you know, they, they don't
even look at the traffic, they
just, they're walking and
reading.
But uh this is uh where we are
today, you know, this is today,
so.
So not only our students, but
you know, much more to.
Transformed to our adults too.
So I do support it, but I just
want to make that awareness that
you might even be further than
that, you know, because um.
You know, if someone has an
anxiety attack.
That's gonna be very.
New to that teacher, and you
know, how do we work with that
and how do we handle with that?
And then at the same time as uh
how do you work with the
parents, you know, with an issue
like that, so.
That's all I have chairman, and
thank you. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, um,
I think we need to formally
adopt the
substitute.
Right.
So
Senator Bison
motions wait a second uh the
near second.
Um, I know we were in the
process, so I didn't get a
chance to go out to the
audience, so if we can, I know
we have students that wanted to
get up and say so we can go out
there before we take final
action so that we can know who,
who's who. So those in support
of the audience, if you feel of
us can feel we can come in maybe
uh you guys about a minute.
Mr. Chairman, stand rounds for
the school superintendents
association, the coalition of
Educational Leaders were willing
to step up and thread the needle
with you on this one.
Mr. Chairman, there's gonna be
some pushback all across our
state by parents and others and
we all need to stand firm in
this, in the thesis in this
bill.
Which is we need to stop the
interruption of cell phones and
the impact that has on our
society.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, the, the thing
that we believe is still here is
local autonomy and how you
structure those denials and
under what conditions those are.
As long as we maintain that
local decision making integrity
in any piece of legislation,
we're going to stand and support
it, Mr. Chairman, we stand in
support. Thank you.
Thank you.
JD Bullington speaking on behalf
of the Greater Albuquerque
Chamber of Commerce, which
agrees with the comments just by
made uh made by uh Mr. Rounds,
uh, the chamber advocates for
policies to support teachers,
raise student academic
performance and support healthy
social development in our
students and the chamber
believes this bill will align
with all those policies and it
believes it will improve our
education system.
This bill's going to
specifically help teachers do
their already difficult jobs and
will help students focus
academic and even socially.
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Gregory Frostadt. I'm
assistant secretary of Education
at the Public Education
department and we stand in firm
support of this bill. Uh, we
want to thank the sponsor for
bringing this forward forward.
We have been working with
Senator Brantley and Senator
Maestas to make sure we get this
right. Uh, the, the
superintendents as well, um,
they surveyed themselves and 74%
of them said that they were in
support of a statewide ban and
some of the reasons that they
gave for that are, as discussed,
reducing distractions and
improving.
Student focus, making the school
environment safer, enhancing
social interactions, reducing
social media bullying and
harassment, reducing discipline
issues, reducing cheating,
improving student behavior and,
and they said it's not just that
they need that they want.
A policy they want a statewide
policy because it supports, uh,
it takes some of the pressure
off of them, uh, when it comes
from the state and outcomes for
some of those districts that
have already implemented their
own policies are um reductions
in discipline referrals and less
bullying and opening dialogue in
the hallways and increased
student engagement and
expectations in the classroom.
And for those reasons, we
support this bill. Thank you.
Thank you.
Mm
So kids can, uh, for all the
reasons you've heard, we see in
strong support of this bill and
really just want to recognize
that.
And
For coming together to merge,
um, two bills and, and moving
one policy forward, we do think
it's important that there is a
statewide policy with
flexibility, um, because
otherwise, those few angry
parents in every district are
gonna kind of have their way, so
I appreciate you stepping
forward and being the leaders on
this. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, Lily
May Ortiz, uh, legislative
liaison for the New Mexico
School Board Association, and we
supported this bill in previous
committees and we appreciated
the flexibility, uh, that was
provided in the bill, uh, this
is a serious problem for our
districts it needs to be
addressed and we just, uh, uh,
continue, uh, to support funded
bills, uh, then this bill was,
uh, funded hopefully continues
to be, uh, and bills that are
not mandates we, uh, promote
local autonomy and uh and, and
continue to support that. Thank
you.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, my name's John
Durchin with the American
Federation of Teachers New
Mexico. We're happy to be here
in support of this legislation
and we also want to echo the
importance of local
implementation and being able to
tailor these kind of policies to
what our particular schools
need. This issue is the number
one issue when we survey our
members across New Mexico and
one of the pioneer districts in
this area is the Taos Municipal
schools, and they are working
really hard with cell phone
policies and our members in Taos
said that it's been a night and
day difference for them.
And it also removes the onus
from teachers to have to
implement this policy in lieu of
having a district policy or
statewide policy elsewhere. So
again, lessen that burden,
lessens that pressure on the
actual instructors so they can
really focus on the education of
students. So we urge your
support. Thank you.
And Sam Lacey from Eldorado High
School. I'm a senior, um.
I think that
Instead of
Uh, focusing on completely
banning phones outright, we
should do more education focused
towards using phones in the
correct manner. I agree that
phones are definitely abused in
the classroom, but I think that
putting so much money towards
just completely outright banning
a
good resource for students, uh.
is harmful, and I think we
should reconsider.
We are, uh.
And those that are in favor, if
you're in opposition, we'll get
to that point. So are you guys
in favor of the bill or? OK, all
right. Well, uh, hello, Mr.
Chairman and fellow members of
the committee, uh, my name is
Austin Stroat. I'm a senior at
Eldorado High School. I'm in
support of this bill because
I'll tell you, I went into high
school, not having a phone in
the 9th grade and then I got one
halfway through the semester
because it kind of got hard to
not be able to have like a
personal email on hand, and I
recognized my own addiction to
my phone.
And I've recognized other
people's addiction to my phone,
you know, I'll catch myself
whipping it out in class when I
probably shouldn't be and I
think that
Enacting policies, uh, and
making it a requirement either
to put your phone away at the
beginning of school or the
beginning of class, could be
really beneficial to a lot of
those kids who maybe don't
recognize their own addiction,
who are constantly getting told,
put, put the phone away, but it,
put it back in your backpack or
whatever, so yeah, I'm really in
support of this. Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Manny Cisneros,
and I'm also a student at El
Dorado High School. I'm a senior
and I'm in support of this bill
because I kind of see firsthand
how.
Um, students, uh, will, you
know, take their phones out and
not pay attention in class. Um,
I think it really disrupts
productivity in the class and um
I agree with the uh.
Um, one of the chairman said
that um it like disrupts like
how like.
We can connect socially, and I
feel like if we have this bill
in place, we can definitely
bring that up and have more
connection between the students.
So yeah, I'm in favor of this
bill. Thank you.
Thank you.
Anybody in opposition to the
bill.
Bill
OK, we'll go ahead.
Hello, mister, Mr. Chair, um,
members of the committee, my
name is Natine. I'm a disability
advocate and on a in a recent
article, and I am in favor, in a
recent article in Jama, the
Journal of the American Medical
Association, I will quote, key
point within the article,
adolescents who reported higher
total and supervised physical
activity levels and lower screen
time and mobile devices from
childhood to adolescence had
lower levels of perceived.
and depressive symptoms, the
magnitude of most associations
of physical activity with mental
health symptoms, attenuated
after counting for total screen
time and mobile device use.
Moreover, adolescents who had
lower total or supervised
physical activity levels and
more total screen time or mobile
devices from childhood to
adolescence had the highest
levels of perceived stress and
depressive symptoms, the
magnitude of most associations
was small, but the magnitude of
the associations of total screen
time and multiple.
devices with depressive symptoms
were considered moderate. Thank
you, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee and sponsors. I stand
in favor.
Thank you.
Senator Steinborn.
You
This chair, I just want to make
a final little comment, which
is, um, this is a really big
deal.
Um, and I think
Uh, uh, uh, a couple of
thoughts. Number one, I think
teachers are gonna be really in
a difficult spot when they have
to enforce this, right?
Because it is an addiction, and
when you're
Avenue in Fors that it's, it's
going to be, I mean, school
districts are gonna really have
to have the backs of teachers
big time and think about how
they implement this and kind of
bring down
This, these new policies and
support teachers, uh, that's
number one, and it'll be
interesting to see the way it
works and if we have issues with
that, with teachers. I think
also in terms of social, I mean,
the, the social, um,
The psychology aspect of it and
how you're, you're changing
behavior and patterns, it's also
an opportunity.
Uh, as far as teaching kids
about interaction and
Being president and authenticity
and other things that you're,
you're losing with these
devices. So I just say that
cause I, I would love to hear
back. I would love us to hear
back from PED like to study this
issue and what other support and
maybe funding do we need to
actually give?
To meet this big policy that
we're taking on because I don't
think it's, I think it's more
complicated than just you can't
use it, it's gonna come with
other
Uh, challenges,
but thank you thanks,
um.
Well, it's the pleasure of the
committee. Move it do pass.

Yes sir.
OK.
So we did have a committee
substitute on 169 in the Senate
Tax Business and Transportation
Committee and that wound up
giving us a 9 to 0 uh due pass,
Mr. Chairman. I do have cabinet
Secretary designate Rob Black
from the Economic Development
department with me. We're before
you with um Centerville 169 as I
mentioned, um, essentially what
it does is uh it it um.
I do have a co-sponsors as
Representative Dixon, um,
Senator Brandt, uh,
Representative Hernandez and a
few others actually have signed
on to it since then, but
essentially what we're trying to
do here is uh enact a strategic
economic development site
readiness Act, the primary
objective of this legislation is
to enhance the state's economic
development by identifying it,
assessing and preparing
strategic sites for immediate
business development. I'm gonna
try to truncate most of my
comments, Mr. Chair, because I
know we're limited on time and I
still have another bill if
you're willing to hear it. The
key provisions in the bill are
uh
We do a site character
characterization study with
these uh with this effort here,
which essentially provides a
comprehensive uh um
Uh, database of what each site
in New Mexico is capable of. So
when we have a potential
interested employer or we have
an existing New Mexico employer
that wants to expand or, or move
into another part of their,
their objective there. They're
able to look at this database
and understand exactly what that
site is already capable of. So
that's the first one. Second is
uh strategic economic
development site advisory
committee will be put together
to vet these projects and make
recommendations based on what
they see, um, a site readiness
fund of $24 million.
will be made available for this
work, and then we have
designation and preparation of
strategic sites based on what
they might be missing to make
them more attractive. Uh, we
just had a huge $5 billion
announcement that the governor
and the secretary and many of us
were a part of. I got to sit
next to the governor and meet,
meet Lanham uh Napier, who is
with the Borderlex Project
that's going on down there at $5
billion investment is gonna be
huge for New Mexico, but when
you bring in this type of work
with this legislation and make
it so much easier to make New
Mexico more attractive.
The pros to doing this are
accelerated economic growth, uh,
competitive, it'll make New
Mexico have a competitive
advantage over our neighboring
states, uh, efficient resource
utilization and allocation, uh,
comprehensive planning,
something we've never had
before. And then uh
infrastructure improvement that
will be made based on um on what
those sites might need. I'm
gonna ask the secretary to say
just a few words, please, and
then we'll uh we'll go on to
where the chairman wants to.
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, I'll be very brief.
We, this is the number one
priority for the department. We
believe this is an essential
part that we are missing in New
Mexico, 36 other states have
some form of a site readiness
strategy. Uh, this will help us
be much quicker to market and be
able to market New Mexico as a
place to invest and grow your
business. And Mr. Chairman,
thank you, Mr. Secretary, uh
Design and uh we do have your
amendment that we do in all of
the, uh, at this juncture in the
session and this is friendly,
but essentially what it does is
uh strikes the appropriation.
And then renumbers everything.
German.
Senator for you.
Any opposition to the motion,
no.
You have an amended bill, so
thank you, Chair. So now the
bill's in the shape that it
needs to be in. Great, thank you
wherever you'd like to go. OK,
all right, at this time we'll go
ahead into the audience. Anybody
here in support of the
The Senate bill.
As amended.
If we can just get 3 or 44 folks
up here.
Go with the senator to get his
other bill heard too. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman JD Bullington
speaking on behalf of the
Greater Albuquerque Chamber of
Commerce. This bill is all about
increasing the number of sites
ready for business development
or reducing the amount of time
businesses must wait for those
sites ready for building we have
very little inventory for medium
to large scale commercial,
industrial, other uses and these
sites can take anywhere from 2
to 4 years or longer to prepare
utilities and be ready for
development. So the greater
Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce
urges you to support.
this bill.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, Marla
Shots, registered lobbyist for
NAIA, the commercial real estate
developers in New Mexico and we
stand in strong support of this
legislation for the reasons
stated by Mr. Bollington. Thank
you.
Good morning, Chad members of
the committee. My name is Alison
Riley, public policy director
with the Mexico Chamber of
Commerce, standing in strong
support of Senate Bill 169,
because site readiness is one of
the biggest factors in
attracting economic investments
and economic growth. When
businesses look to expand or
relocate, they need shovel-ready
sites with the right
infrastructure and permitting in
place. Without that, they move
to states that are better
prepared. This bill accelerates
job creation by reducing delays
in construction, so businesses
can start quicker and hire
sooner.
So in conclusion, I want to
repeat what the other speakers
said, but we are in strong
support of this bill. Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh, chairman members of the
committee Jason Espinoza,
executive director with New
Mexico IDEA, the statewide
economic development
Professional Association, uh,
along with the department, this
is our number one economic
development priority this year
and it's about shortening
timelines so that we can
incentivize and attract
investment in the state. Thank
you.
Good morning, Mr. Chair.
Members of the committee, Carlos
Lucero with the public service
company in New Mexico. We are a
strong supporter of 169. It's
actually
The sister bill to Senate Bill
170, which were also in support
of, but we'll talk about that
later when it comes down, but
this will allow the Secretary of
Economic economic development is
solicit proposal for site
redevelopment projects which
include pre-development work for
such as survey and planning
infrastructure improvements are
permitting and really it was
just speed up as Mr. Espinoza
stated the timeline process for
full development of these
economic development projects
and this in turn really will
attract
business and industry for so for
these reasons we, we stop, we've
fall in strong support. Thank
you. Thank you.
Anybody on Zoom?
Mm
Uh, Danielle, go ahead.
Uh, good morning. It is such a
tremendous pleasure to simply
echo what all of my amazing
colleagues have mentioned. I am
Danielle Casey, president and
CEO of the Albuquerque Regional
Economic Alliance, but, but I
also do serve as vice chair of
the International Economic
Development Council, just
returned from DC with
colleagues, and this is
continues to be one of the top
issues for states across the
country and in New Mexico, um,
and in our greater Albuquerque
region, I repeatedly see that of
the projects we actually see,
We're losing at least 30% or
more because of a lack of sight
readiness, which doesn't count
all of the many that take us off
the list, knowing that we can't
satisfy the requirements. This
will be a tremendous boon to our
ability to bring really
wonderful quality of jobs,
quality jobs in target
industries to New Mexico. Thank
you so much. I urge your support
along with my colleagues.
Thank you.
Anybody in opposition?
Mm
All right.
Committee
Senator for you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Senator and secretary, it's
nice to see you. um.
I just have a couple of
questions about the bill. I
think it's a, a great
Um, uh, idea and I do, I do
recognize that being site ready
is one of the most important
things that economic development
needs to have.
I'm wondering, um, why you, uh,
why there's written in here for
a committee.
Not necessarily a fan of
creating more committees and um
it does seem like the, the final
decision is being left with the
department, um, for rules and
for uh selection and for the
distribution of funds.
Purpose of a committee. Is it
necessary?
Senator, yes, so there's gonna
be a lot of work that has to be
done here. So you're going to
want to be able to bet and
I guess um
Find the best of the best, uh,
projects and, and, and sites and
what have you and so I think
that that's gonna require the
department to have and and
there's this is one of those. I,
I'm with you, not about, you
know, we need to create another
board, another commission,
another whatever, um, there are
people chomping at the bit to
try to help with this. And so I
don't know that we're gonna have
an issue with keeping, you know,
members, um, and it is going to
be probably a good idea to have
like a wide breadth of people
looking at these, not just the
department and just one
particular direction that might
be.
the whatever philosophy of the
department at the time.
But don't ask, you know, the
secretary wants to say anything.
Uh
Mr. Chairman, uh, Senator,
that's a great question and
normally I would 100% agree with
you, um, but this was actually
from the department from my
idea.
Uh, if, if I, you know, I'm
still in the role and this does
pass. I would not want to be the
sole person being advised or,
or, or uh making those decisions
around those sort of investments
around the state. So I think
it's really important to have uh
both you, uh, our, our fellow
departments who play a role in
infrastructure, that's
Department of Transportation and
others, as well as the private
sector helping advise as to
where the best use of resources
would be.
And uh because we will be
balancing requests from Roswell
from Gallup, from Donana County
that we all want to balance and
I think having an advisory group
would be very helpful to us to
do that.
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
So, um, Senator Secretary, with
that in mind,
This committee is going to be
under the Open Meetings Act.
And I don't know that there's
anything in the open Meetings
Act that would give you the
ability to go into executive
session, closed session to
discuss maybe potentially
critical things that um I'm just
wondering, are there some things
that the committee will be
discussing about the site that
might not be in the best
interest for the, the, uh, and
I'm not gonna say the public to
know, but uh, yeah, I think you
understand what I'm saying,
secretary. Are there some things
that
You ordinarily may not uh
discuss in an open session in
regards to site selection.
Yeah, so chairman and senator,
I, I think you're right, there
would possibly be. This is
simply a solely an advisory
committee, so there's don't have
any decision making authority.
There's only gonna be so many
certain things that they're
going to be able to get into and
an owner of a property or a or a
or a government agency that
might own something or a private
owner and say we don't want to
give you that information and I
think that would
They allot to the committee that
there may be something that that
would be a problem with this
particular site, but secretary,
if you want to add.
Uh, Mr. Chairman Senator, I
think that's right. It's, it's
it's advisory so it would sit
outside of the normal uh
requirements there. Um, and it,
this is purely a a property,
whether it's a municipal
property, they would come and
apply to have that site
characterization work done, so
they would be volunteering to
give us that information. So I
think that helps alleviate
concerns around that those sort
of disclosures. OK. Thank you,
Mr. um Mr. Chair, uh, Senator.
So on the uh page 3 line 13, you
have governmental land use
restrictions. I'm assuming
you're talking about zoning.
Uh, page 3 line 13.
Mr. Chairman, Senator, uh, that
that could be zoning, it could
be, um, there may be other sort
of restrictions regarding within
a watershed. Uh, so there's a
variety of things that that
could apply to. And if uh we're
looking at this might be an
appropriate use for a particular
type of use, that would be an
important, important thing to
care, to be able to look at and
evaluate and as part of a
report, the idea would be each
of one of these sites would be
hosted on EDD's website so that
it's easy to market for a
developer.
But they understand that this
sits in a watershed or it sits
in a particular zone, zoning
requirements so that they're not
wasting their time, uh, and so I
think that's, that's part of
what we're trying to do with
that. OK. Thank you. Um, and
then, um, last question, uh, Mr.
Chairman, Secretary.
Senator, um, I noticed that you
have this any other site
characteristics that may affect
the degree to which the site is
ready for immediate economic
development. I'm not sure that
that is going to include um some
of the stuff that you have a
above, which is workforce
availability, housing
availability.
And it seems like education has
been left off of that list, um,
as well as potentially quality
of life, and we know that that
site selection.
The education in the community
has a big impact.
On whether a business decides to
come because they're gonna have
employees, they're gonna bring
their employees and they want to
know that their families, their
children are gonna have uh a
good school to go to, so I know
that they do look at educational
um uh standings of schools in
the community and then we have
learned in this committee that
the quality of life is a big,
um, it's a big
Uh, requirement for both
employees as well as businesses.
So I, I just, I'm not, it's not
a question, I just note that
those two things are not
included in here and they may be
important. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Senator Steinborg.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, the
secretary and Senator, thank you
for the bell. Um, I know my
county supports it. I, I just
got a text that they do.
Um
It's interesting and I think I
figured out a lot of the
questions I had by looking at
the bill. A couple of things, I
mean, it does say that it's for
economic development potential
sites. It really doesn't define.
That but that we know what that
means and so.
Um
I guess that's a little clear.
Let me ask this, Mr. Secretary
and Senator.
What if a little concerned maybe
like what if you're evaluating a
site of a, of a property, a
private property, which this
bill doesn't limit it to public
property, right?
A part of the criteria that's
gonna be looked at as site
ownership.
With that site owner.
Isn't selling, hasn't sold, may
want this to be done till it
sells. I mean, does that create
any problems with
Um
Um
I don't know, inflated prices or
just kind of queuing a deal up.
If uh
You know, somebody hasn't
You know, sold the property to
an economic development entity.
I mean, what, what are all the
thoughts and considerations
about
That
And the appropriateness of
spending money on, uh, somebody
who hasn't even sold the land in
the first place, but you're
spending money to do a site
assessment on their property,
just kind of betting on the come
little bit.
Mr. Chairman, uh, Senator, um,
I think that would be something
that the committee would
evaluate if, if this has been a
dormant piece of property that
there's been no investment in,
no effort to develop it, market
it, it's set, and that's gonna
lean against looking at this as
an economic strategic economic
development site.
Um, you want to have, whether
that's a county, city, or
private sector partner that's
interested in actually creating
jobs and development. Um, so
that's part of that analysis
that the committee would help
provide is, is, you know, is
this really, is this serious?
And then, then that's where we
would do that evaluation, right?
And, and Mr. Chairman and
Senator, excellent question. Um,
I, I think that it's also fair
that no one will be treated.
There will be no special
treatment by this, this effort
or this advisory committee. So
if, you know, Padilla has a
piece of land and Steinborne has
a piece of land. We're both able
to say, hey, let's have these
both of these looked at. So
there would be no unfair, you
know, advantage if you will.
Well, Mr. Chair, I guess the
thing that I like is kind of a
transparency, guys, this is
public.
So, in fact, it's, it's, you
know, kind of the insider deal.
You know, history or whatever in
this case, this is actually a
public body and a public
process, and that's that, that,
that kind of hedges against.
Some of those concerns, but
anyway, I think it's a a great
bill and I can see why you'd be
advocating for it. So thank you
all. Thank you.
Thank you, um, I.
Mm
hold on a second, I have a
question, well, not question,
but, you know.
I know that uh.
Private partners and then public
partners or the tribes, you
know, fall into this because,
you know, tribes just don't
enterprises on the reservation.
They also have lands that they
purchase off. I know for our
tribe, we have a 90 acre tract
in San Ysidro and we've been
approached, you know, many times
by folks in the in the movie
industry and others, uh, and so
forth, and I know that land was
not put in trust for the very
reason to be able to partner and
so I guess my recommendation.
I don't know if we define that
as public partner or doing
separate, I would recommend it
if the sponsor is willing to
add, uh, either as a separate uh
paragraph drives Pueblos and
nations as part of that or
including this.
I don't know if they follow it a
public partner because the
tribes also have LLC so I don't
know how, but I just throw that
out there and give me your
thoughts on that. Well, thank
you, Chairman, excellent
thought, um, on page 2.
Um
Under public partners starting
on line 4 through 9, we do
believe the public partner calls
tribes and pueblos and whatever
into this definition, number
one. Number 2, nothing prohibits
any inch of New Mexico from
being considered for this
effort.
And I don't know if you want to
see Mr. Chairman, um, and I
would say it, it's in, in fact,
um, I had the opportunity to
visit with the leadership of the
Zuni Pueblo, um, earlier in the
year, and they specifically we
talked specifically about this
initiative, and I see this as
really instrumental in
partnering with the tribal
communities and, and, and
pueblos and their economic
development teams, so that is
very much our intent is if they
would like to have uh sites
characterized for use, that they
would be
eligible for participation.
So, uh, explain to me, I mean
when you read the definition of
public partner, it means states
instrumentalities and all the
subdivisions and so forth, but
the tribes are not.
Political subdivisions of the
state nor the instrumentalities
of the state. So how would, how
would, I mean, I don't see
tribes in there, you know, right
now in the definition.
Mr. Chairman, I, if, if the
committee so wishes, I'd be
happy to add that language in
right now so that we don't slow
this thing. I think uh I don't
want to stop the, I, I think
moving forward, if we can come
up with uh maybe some uh talk
with some of the tribes and see
how they fit in. Maybe we can
amend the bill to do if it
reaches the Senate floor and and
and do that and so that is our
next stop OK all right you might
recall the other day I amended a
bill on the floor. You don't
want to stop it, but so and, and
I think it'll be good to get
some of the tribal folks.
You know, to just kind of weigh
in on how they might.
See that the language being
developed and so forth so with
that feedback, uh, we have a
deal pass motion by Senator
Brent a second Senator Campos.
Clerk Calder.
Senator Brent, Senator Brandt
votes yes. Senator Compos.
Senator Campos votes, yeah,
Senator Gonzalez.
Senator Gonzalezia, Senator
Lanier, Senator Padilla, Senator
Padillas, Senator Steinborn.
Senator Steinborn votes yes
senators Tobiasin. Senator
Tobiasin Botsia, Senator Trujil.
Senator Trujillo votes yes,
Senator Woods.
Senator Schendo. Yes. Senator
Sendos, Senator Munoz.
We have a due pass.
8 in the affirmative, 0 in the
negative.
OK, Senator of DuP Paz.
Uh, moving on to the Senate
bill, uh, 59.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm
gonna go, I know that we're kind
of pressed on time. My expert's
on his way up here, um, we're
here with you before you with
Senate Bill 59, um, essentially
this is Isaiah Emke. He is the
business officer for the local,
um, uh, sheet metal workers. I'm
pretty sure I got that right. I
hope I got that, yeah. And um
and essentially with this
legislation does is it amend,
uh, we want, we're attempting to
amend the public works uh Wage
Act by including off-site
fabricators wherever the work is
actually being done, um.
needs to meet wherever the
project, the, the minimum wage
for the project. I get that
right?
Yes, wherever the project is
actually being done, these are
all public projects, public
dollars, and that's essentially
what the legislation does. The
key provisions are we redefine
um there's an additional uh
definition of off-site
fabricators, so there's no
confusion there. Wage and
benefit requirements, compliance
and enforcement, and why we want
to do this is to ensure that
there's equitable compensation
based on the value of the
project.
Um, and the, uh, labor market
study and quality assurance for
the project itself, and I'll ask
Mr. Zeke just to say a couple of
words on the on the uh the
legislation.
The members of the committee,
uh, everything's sponsored
pretty spoke about it's true
about the bill.
And um
We will look for um look.
Support. Thank you.
Thank you, uh, first we'll go
out to the audience, anybody
here in support of the bill.
You guys can, let's just do 3
because we need to get going.
Um, good morning, uh, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Roland Harris. I am a
supervisor for testing adjusting
and balancing. Um, I've been a
supervisor for 9 years and um as
a supervisor, I can see um you
quantifiable things when we do
readings in buildings that uh
specific ducts need to be
manufactured to a certain level
of quality and if we don't have
that quality, um, it shows up in
the readings and it also shows
up later on in terms of
Inefficiencies in how that
building operates, so I strongly
urge you to vote for this bill.
Thank
Uh chairman members of the
committee, Jason Espinoza,
speaking on behalf of the
mechanical contractors
Association in Mexico and the
sheet metal Contractors
Association in New Mexico
induced support the bill. Uh, we
believe this bill promotes an
equal playing field and off-site
fabrication, allowing
consistency in the construction
process and we do uh do pass.
Thank you.
Yeah
Mm
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, my name is Stephanie
Meyez. I'm a registered lobbyist
representing the New Mexico
Building and Construction Trades
Council. We're an alliance of 15
craft unions with more than
15,000 workers statewide. Today
we're here standing in support
of Senate Bill 59. We thank the
sponsor for bringing this
forward.
Allowing off-site custom
fabrication to bypass prevailing
wage requirements, encourages
developers to relocate
substantial portions of a
project outside the local area
or state relying on low paid,
low skilled workers who lack the
protections granted to those
performing the same tasks on
site. This practice results in
significant profits for
developers at the expense of
local workers in the regional
economy. The bill addresses that
specific loophole and prevailing
wage requirements by enacting
this legislation, we will ensure
prevailing wage protections
extend to workers engaged in
offsite fabrication of custom
sheet metal products for public
works projects. We strongly
support Senate Bill 59 and ask
that you vote yes. Thank you.
Thank you. We don't have
anybody.
OK.
OK. Anybody in opposition?
Uh, come on up.
Chairman of the committee,
Alison Riley with the New Mexico
Chamber of Commerce and
opposition to Senate Bill 59
rather than permitting to uh
negotiation for fair wages based
on fair market conditions, SP 59
forces a uniformity that
discourages investment in
infrastructure and it's
difficult for small contractors
to keep up with. And for these
reasons, we are opposed to the
bill as written. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, uh,
chairman and members of the
committee. I'm Kelly Fajardo and
I'm here on behalf of the
Associated General Contractors,
AGC represents union and
non-union workers employing over
54,000 New Mexicans. The bill
expands the definition of sight
of the project to include
off-site fabrication, setting a
precedent for broader
interpretations in future
legislation. There is concern
that future bills could further
extend these definitions,
creating regulatory uncertainty
and impacting operations. This
bill as written can an
intention.
incentivize contractors to
source materials and fabrication
services from outside New
Mexico, affecting the local
supply chain and economic
competitiveness. This is not
about opposing for wages, but
about ensuring a strong
competitive construction
industry that protects local
jobs and economic growth. We
urge legislators to consider the
long term consequences of this
bill. Thank you.
Thank you.
And.
Uh, go ahead, Carlet.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Carla Kugler. I'm with
Associated Builders and
Contractors, um, and we are in
opposition of Senate Bill 59,
um, uh, with all due respect to
the, the leader Padilla and Mr.
Zemke, you know, this bill, it
doesn't really, it doesn't close
a loophole. There's only two
states in the nation that
actually incorporate
prefabrication into prevailing
wages. The feds don't even do
it, and it's because they're
manufacturers, um, most
manufacturers do not play in the
prevailing wage.
space, um, and they just, um, it
would be a very burdensome for
them to try and manipulate their
payroll to a company for
prevailing wages, while they
have skilled labor, but they
also have, um, you know, skilled
equipment, and they're just not
used to being, they're, they're
manufacturers, they're not
contractors. If this bill was
trying to get contractors to,
you know, prevent contractors
from skirting the rules, um, and
going off site to prevent paying
preventing wages, but that's not
what
this is, it's really targeting
um the the manufacturing uh
industry on prevailing wages. So
we stand in opposition. Thank
you.
Thank you.
But
OK, all right. We'll go to
committee. I have uh Senator
Dubai.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, I was
a little unclear until everyone
got up, um, Mr. Chair and spoke
either for or against this bill,
and it seems to me like it is an
attack on the free market.
by the unions, um, I think if a,
if a fabricator.
does their job well and
fabricates the product that's
needed to the specifications,
um, then they're gonna win bids
if, if the pricing is right, um,
so this is really about union
pay not necessarily skill. Um,
so for that reason, I don't
think I can support this, but I
will give you the opportunity to
answer, Mr. Chair, how will this
increase potentially
construction costs which are
already um super inflated at
this point.
Mr. Chairman and Senator by some
good questions. Thank you very
much. So these are competitively
bid projects and you're gonna
have to compete to get this
work, number one, these are
public dollars that are used for
this project, and I'm gonna ask
Mr. Zemke to, to address a
little bit of your question on
there's a whole chain of, of, of
things that have to happen to
make a project like this work,
and so I'm gonna ask him to talk
about sort of the in-state work
versus at is that the work
necessarily isn't happening
right where the project is, is
occurring. And that's why this
is needed, but.
Shao, uh, Senator Tobiason, so,
uh, the way a project is set up
when the engineer designs the
building is there's certain
manufactured items that are made
for every building.
Uh, the ductwork in particular
is built.
And designed her project.
These are the fabrication shops
that manufacture the duck work
by hand, sheet metal's last
artisan trade in the building
trades that actually manufacture
in the shop and then install in
the field.
So Mr. Chair.
Why do we care what someone pays
their employees if they're not a
part of the union.
And, and you're, you're talking
about skill versus pay, which
are two totally different
topics. Help me because I'm
confused.
Chaindo, uh, Senator Tobiasson,
so under the publicment Wage
Act, whoever bids on these
projects is required to pay the
minimum wage under the Act.
This would just be adding
another layer to the fabrication
portion in the sheet metal shop.
So Mr. Chair, I
I'm still confused because why,
why are we adding this layer?
Why is, why is that needed? Has
something so horrific happened
over and over and over again.
Checendo, uh, Senator Tobiasson.
So what this does is it provides
parity uh for all the sheet
metal shops in New Mexico to pay
the same state prevailing wage
in those shops.
Uh, providing equality of wages
across the board.
The worker, excuse me, Mr.
Chairman, it says the worker
still has to have the same high
level of skill set and all of
that. But this ensures that
they're being paid fairly based
on where the work is being done.
I see, and Mr. Chair, regardless
of where the work is being done,
are all of these employees,
union employees or some of them
not union employees?
and, uh, Senator Tobiasson so
different contractors are
unions, some are non-union, um,
so that's why there's
competitive bids based off the
lowest bid process.
I see, I think you've answered
my question sufficiently. Thank
you, Mr. Chair.
Senator Lanier.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um, I just have, I have a couple
of questions.
So, what, what happens if, let,
let's take Las Cruces as an
example. If you have a fabric
fabricator in El Paso and they
better job in New Mexico.
And they get the job.
Are they gonna be?
held to the same standard.
We got this question. Chairman
Sendo, uh, Senator Denier, um,
so these are public dollars,
public RFPs that go out.
Um, wherever the shop is
located, whether it be El Paso
or China, they're gonna have to
follow the provisions of the
public works minimum wage Act.
Uh, if they failed to follow
those provisions, then there's
certain
penalties that could disqualify
them from future.
Be.
So, Mr. Chairman, make sure I
understand. So,
We are penalizing our
fabricators.
Then
Is that correct?
Chairman Chendo, uh, Senator
Lanier, no.
And the reason why is.
There are certain rules and
regulations within the public
works Minimum Wage Act that
every contractor has to follow.
Uh, in order to be compliant if
they don't follow those rules,
then there's consequences.
OK, so Mr. Chair, so why do we
need this bill now?
Uh, Chairman Shendo, uh, Senator
Lanier as stated earlier by a
certified tap technician we're
seeing a lot of duck work not
being manufactured to standards,
so resulting in uh.
poor air quality in buildings,
um, and then also having public
dollars having to go back and
fix these deficiencies.
Uh, months, even years after
it's been completed.
And so Mr. Chair, so a minimum
wage.
Makes all the fabrication good,
but I, I'm confused.
Chairman Shando, Senator Lanier,
so.
The uh
Incentive for someone to bid on
these contracts is obviously to
make uh revenue, the uh revenue
stream is everywhere from 5 to
10% they make on the total
project. If I'm having to pay a
fabricator state preventing
wages in the shop. I can't
afford the ability to have them
build it twice. It's got to be
done right the first time, which
will increase the standard of
work and craftsmanship for that
given shot.
And Mr. Chairman, I assume that
these standards would be on site
fabrication too.
If, if you fabricate on site,
uh, Chairman Sendo, Senator
Lanier, yes, OK, and then my
last question, Mr. Chairman.
So let's go back to Las Cruces
and El Paso. What if
Are, are we gonna be encouraging
our fabricators.
To bid work and.
El Paso now.
Uh, Chairman Shendo, Senator
Lanier, so this actually closes
the loophole in uh state statute
134-5, which refers to use in
New Mexican materials, uh, in
regards it gives preference to
uh produced grown, processed, or
manufactured, uh, in New Mexico
by citizens and residents. So
this actually uh closes that
loophole which would.
Hopefully, uh, encourage out of
state contractors to use in
state fabricated shops.
OK. And Mr. Chairman, so
If I understand that right, if
we close that loophole, are we
opening another loophole?
Or we just going to start buying
supplies in El Paso and move
them across the border and
fabricating.
In New Mexico, if we can get
them cheaper in El Paso, why
wouldn't we do that?
I guess
Chairman Sendo Center Lanier, so
this levels the playing field.
So whether you're in a low wage
earning state like El Paso, and
they still have to follow the
same prevailing wages in that
shop.
Yes, but what about supplies,
Mr. Chairman?
Well, those Mr. Chairman and and
and senator, those supplies have
to be produced by somebody and,
and, and that would, that would.
It be a cost adjustment as they
did on New Mexico work.
Right, but if you're in New
Mexico fabricator, Mr. Chairman,
and you can buy your supplies
cheaper, say, in El Paso. I
don't know how he got off on
cruises in El Paso.
I'm from the Four Corners, but
anyway,
goodness if we can buy our
supplies cheaper in El Paso and
bring them back across, aren't
we encouraging that? I
Chairman Sendo, Senator near. So
actually every projects bid on
the pounds, the amount of
Weight, it takes or metal it
takes to fabricate.
Uh, that's industry, uh,
depending on the price of metal,
so everybody has to pay that
same price in this region, um,
now that.
That piece of metal fluctuates
depending on um.
How much is needed or, or how
much is not needed.
time period.
Thank you. Thank you guys for
your answers. That's it, Mr.
Chair.
Uh, Senator Woods.
You know, I, I, Mr. Chair.
What's gonna keep someone from
just putting a bug on the damn
thing and make you think it's
union made.
I mean, this, this is gonna be
hard to, to regulate out of
state.
Uh
You know, 3 states over some guy
puts a bug on it, and sends it
over to you, uh, the
fabricators, the local guys are
gonna say, yeah, it's union
made, we're cool, you know.
You know, it's gonna be damn
hard to figure this out, uh, and
then you go to your, your fans,
your coolers, your, your
radiators, your, you know, all
that's part of, of putting stuff
together and so.
I'm not so sure this will work
very good. I understand where
you're going with it. I
understand what you're trying to
do, but uh,
Many companies, you don't have.
Two sides.
Let's face it,
There's companies that have
signature side nonsignatory
side.
And
Wouldn't be that hard to go
there and get that mark put on
the other side, if they're
unscrupulous.
Contractors and you know what
I'm talking about, you, you hear
of it all the time, I'm sure,
so.
I'm, I'm gonna say it's gonna be
very hard to administer.
Uh
To get this done when Miss chair
a lot of times on those bid
list, you know, they'll even
request uh
You know, uh, a boat or
something and you've seen this
too a bolt and, and instead of
saying the full specks of that
boat, they'll say, I wanna get
the vote.
Number so and so, and it's in
again for catalog, and that's
what you go get to satisfy that
deal. That's the specification.
And what you're talking about is
two different things between
specifications and workmanship.
And, and the inspector on that
job is the one that inspects the
workmanship, and he determines
whether that duct work coming in
meet suspects on that job.
It, right,
and, and senator.
Well, first of all, uh, Mr.
Chairman and senator, this isn't
a union bill. This isn't an
industry bill.
And whoever is providing those
that that work has to just meet
these standards or these
requirements that we have here,
yeah, but it's not a union bill.
So if you want to talk about the
technicality of.
Yeah, so, uh, Senator Sendo, uh.
Senator Pratt Woods, so exactly
what the sponsor Padilla said is
this is not a union bill, no
one's required to put a union
bug on their ductwork.
The minimum requirements to pay
state prevailing wages in that
shop for a given.
Project, it's been awarded to
either a union or non-union
contractor.
So with that, Mr. Chair and I
know we're running late. I'm
going to quit after this
question, I promise.
With that
You are going to go into we're
talking about Marty Robbins
here, the streets of El Paso.
And we're gonna walk into that
shop that, that bid on that duck
work.
And say, Mister Bookkeeper.
You show me the guy that built
that, and you show me his way
stub.
For that period of time.
Is that how you're gonna place
this.
visa, Mr. Chairman and Senator,
these are public projects, any
type of public project you have
to submit, um, the requirements
that are in the RFP and that are
in the whatever New Mexico
requires and with something like
this as an example.
It's not, no one has to run down
and see the bookkeeper over in
the streets of El Paso, which I
think is a very nice song, by
the way, by Marty I like it too.
I wish, I wish I could go have a
margarita I
I wish I could sing it like that
however, they, they do need to
submit any number of requirement
required paperwork, you know,
when they are going to be paid
for their whatever they've
agreed to do for the state of
New Mexico or any other entity
that this applies to.
So Miss Misser and Senator
simply a
A statement from someone that
says we did it.
You know, the wages, they have
to have a certified payroll that
would be submitted just like I
have your business, my business
you have to submit certified
payrolls for different things.
I understand it's a certified
tape, but all I have to say is
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did pay that.
Chairman, you have to also
submit along with that that
statement, a certified payroll
and you certainly don't I'm
saying is a situation where
you're having to defend that if
I'm an out of state contractor.
In state would be a little
different if I was an out of
state contractor.
And I've been on this project.
All I have to say is, yes, I did
pay those wages.
It doesn't protect the in-state
contractor at all.
Because the out of state
contractor, we had no lever on
them to, to prove that they did
pay the wages in state
contractors, we got some levers
on them.
But an out of state contractor,
I don't see that same.
Labor
We can just they can just
essentially say, and why I said
bug immense the same thing, you
can pay whatever and is safe,
yes, I did.
Well, Mr. Chairman and Senator,
I, I'm gonna respectfully
disagree with you on that one
because I think you're gonna get
yourself into all sorts of
issues if you don't, if you turn
in a certified payroll that's
inaccurate for a public project,
that's not going to go well for
you.
So you're gonna require
A out of state contractor to
turn in his payroll, and that's
the question I was asking about.
Going to the bookkeeper in that
company over there, you're gonna
require
That piece of duck work
accompanying it to come into the
state.
certified payroll of the I spent
on that project by this.
By this tin bender and say,
This is what he spent, putting
that together. Well, Mr.
Chairman and Senator, uh, the
answer to that to your direct
question is yes. And the reason
that they're gonna be doing that
is because they will have seen
that requirement in the RFP or
the statewide price, whatever
mechanism, the agency decided to
utilize to get this thing, this
work done. They'll, they'll see
that as a requirement that
they're gonna have to do. And
they will be legally bound to
submit.
accurate information.
Mr. Expert, she agreed with
that.
