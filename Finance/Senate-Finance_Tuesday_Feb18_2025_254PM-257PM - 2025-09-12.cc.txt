uh, establish and limit
legislative salaries, um, and it
would also take out, it would
also specifically provide for uh
the ability to receive
legislative salaries because we
have language in our
Constitution now that says we
can have no other compensation
Percocet or allowance, that
language would stay, but we
would be adding uh the
availability of uh a salary
established uh by this
independent citizen.
Thank you.
And what do you wanna
Yeah, thank you, thank you, Mr.
Chair. Um, I am happy to be a
sponsor of this bill and have
been so in the past. I do think
it is time for New Mexico uh to
take this step.
Uh, I
Have I call her my in-house city
counselor, my wife Carol, who
serves on the Santa Fe City
Council and I know Senator
Lanier, you served on the county
commission.
And I just think that, you know,
they are paid a
Salary that's in the
Mid 40s to serve in that
capacity.
Local government officials
receive a PERA retirement. They
receive health insurance.
And doing something parallel,
uh, I think would open up.
This process to a whole range of
different voices and different
representation, which is
something that would really help
the legislative process, so
happy to be here and support and
I know Senator Figueroa, who's
really been the lead on this,
should be here any minute.
She's running over from tax.
We're juggling we're at that
time. So that's all I'll say at
this point, Mr. Chair. Thank
you. We're gonna go to Zoom
first because we only have one
person in opposition or support.
Zuma.
No.
Are they in opposition or
support?
We have one
Doesn't
All right, who are they?
Barbara, are you there?
You don't know if you're in
opposition or support, but you
got your hand raised.
Yes, I'm, I'm in support.
And go ahead, Barbara.
So I'm Barbara Calif.
Uh, uh, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee. I'm Barbara Cale
speaking for the League of Women
Voters of New Mexico. The league
is in full support of SJR1 as
amended in the Senate Rules
Committee. The league supports
legislative compensation that is
fair and reasonable, recognizing
that there's a cost to
government and that the cost
should be paid by the taxpayers
of New Mexico. The league
recommends paying a salary that
is high enough to attract and
retain a diverse group of.
qualified, committed
legislators.
I'd like to thank the sponsors.
