Business community.
They were.
So between the.
Come up with.
Of eleven.
this.
Realligned.
Specially are small.
New Mexico state.
Space but necklace in.
Stations all have.
From having to.
To.
Ants.
Later I may mention.
Another issue that we.
Start on this so that we.
Program itself will not.
Contributions to the fund.
January one twenty twenty five.
A year and.
And employers.
And make sure.
Secretary of work force to.
From the business community.
Employees.
The way this works is that in.
If of the.
Documents filed in the.
That they've started and.
Keep yourself and your family.
Take leave to bond with.
Each week if that.
If you look at this chart.
You'll understand.
Based on the state for.
Paid family medical leave.
There are several reasons for
that.
Caretakers.
Them away to.
The average.
Washington is.
Six point seven nine.
Any of the other states.
But let's.
The settlement.
Businesses and.
Competitive.
Pointing to the fact that they
have a.
Having an appropriate work.
Support for those who.
have a bird.
Or.
This pro.
Businesses will not.
So it will support.
A long term relationship
between.
Businesses are not going to be.
With the large.
Offered similar.
With that I will turn.
All right.
Secretary.
We are.
The committee might have a.
Concerns about the
administrative.
In the current bill be
maintained.
Non recurring for the next two.
Starting in two.
Funding is return.
We go on to terribly.
Members of the committee my name
is.
Law Center.
With additional training in the
turtle town.
Really taking a look at.
Greatest number of the.
Social.
Stability food and.
Study this was passed twenty.
At the time Representative
Stuart.
A lot of compromises.
Mitigate this by.
Thank you for.
Rules but.
Operating.
Restaurant that that team.
Wages becomes very to.
You would have to pull cash.
Specific
From the department sites.
But I think.
Questions but I think some of.
Start contributing to the fund.
Eight dead and.
The state.
New.
Level.
There's very little guidance as
the.
Really skyrocket.
Contribution for a.
Certain cap level.
And that.
I understand that.
On.
Go to the.
Situation we're so sorry that a
pair.
But again I repeat.
The continuing.
What you.
Fix to.
All right.
Circumstances.
Get the.
Speaking to the health of the
fund and the.
Right now there.
To adjust the benefit.
Is that a certain percentage.
Employer contribution.
To ensure this.
We.
The definition.
Hearing that there's.
Provides
Less cost to the employee.
And like that's being interested
in.
Thank you.
R. Representative.
So.
Get.
We can.
I'll be totally honest about.
About this bill.
Are you know as.
Employer funded.
Employer covered some.
Good.
And forty thought.
For labor we.
Are needed to be able.
Family apps.
Members that are now willing.
we.
Quality health coverage for all.
For bringing this up and we.
We could do on the way.
Later it's my under.
Trying to fix it if it can't be
fair.
The staff up loaded.
The public can happen.
Business and it.
Home I.
As an economist in the economic.
Department.
And we.
A little bit about the FY.
People in the.
And I think the report is a.
Every.
In their life.
To the New.
Number.
The new demand and.
Maybe people don't understand
the.
Having that said.
actually going to make a claim.
Place.
Fourteen percent of the labor
force.
So if we look at Rio.
Seven four percent.
Washington was five percent.
Six percent Connecticut one
point two percent.
Actually take a top down
approach.
Claims we.
In the state of New.
The year before was up.
If you were children.
Twenty thousand.
The New.
And I want to step back.
Children.
Which'll.
That we do need.
And why is that number.
Minutes low for Google.
Available to them as they have.
Another re.
Take smaller amounts than.
I think.
New Mexico.
About four point.
And it's better to.
Taking an actual.
Employees.
So we know the.
On.
And as.
The.
And.
This bill over here to speak.
That's in the blue handout.
Included that amendment.
As far as
Over the course of so.
Depending on you know whether.
Of.
Four hundred and eight.
Reminded committee the.
And
Estimate was from LFC.
Saying that L. L. C.'s estimate.
And then starting up at the very
top.
Try to kind of break down with
the.
report and try to kind of
recreate it for what was
actually ended up in the bill
because the task force when they
did their analysis it was prior
to the bill actually being
drafted and so they don't have
everything there so we try to
use their parameters and include
that on page five so you can see
that there's that range there
there's
In the out years I
on the median cost scenario
that's on page four that's what
LESC used we assume that ten
percent take up right I want to
mention one thing here was that
the comments from bureau LFC
number used to fourteen percent
take up right it's always been
ten percent
what we decided was that FMLA
study.
We were looking for other
other similar programs out there
that you know it's kind of
approximate well what what could
this program actually end up
looking like we didn't use the
fourteen percent we set ten
percent because we didn't think
it was going to be as high as
fourteen percent
Also I wanted to mention
the the University of New Mexico
reported that for their parental
family leave their take up rate
is at about five percent that's
just print a leaf and so that's
a much more narrowly defined.
Program then
In this program that's before
you today.
and then Washington state we
actually had slightly different
numbers I'm not sure why but we
were showing a seven point four
percent take up right on there
in their program and actually if
you look at the very last page
on the FIR we included kind of a
side by side of how their FML
paid family medical leave
program is defined and Vigil our
current
bill is defined they can see
that the definitions that we
used are quite a bit more widely
defined and Washington's so we
do think that that ten percent
is a you know it's it's
completely possible that a ten
percent take up right could
happen.
we also used you know if we were
just piling on the behavioural
analysis used a twelve week the
assume the average leave blanks
would be twelve weeks we assume
that we actually said that it
could potentially be about eight
and a half weeks so there was
definitely some given taken
these
And with that madam chair I
think that was everything that I
wanted to cover so thank you
thank you for that for a work an
explanation and thanks to all
the panel we're going to have
any go to the committee first to
see there's any questions before
we allow the panel to to go back
if any questions from the
committee we've or comments
we've got Senator Padilla
Senator Steinborn.
And and then we're going to go
yes thank you madam chair and
and happened to be running in
circles over here is not going
on here but happy to be that one
of the co sponsors of the
legislation and I would just say
that
the coming together of so many
different entities to craft this
legislation has made it what it
is become today I do believe
that in a large way we've we've.
Really reached out to the
business community to find
solutions that work for everyone
obviously we we have an
implementation rampant period
here madam chair that will allow
for things that as the
implementation is taking place
by the department the cabinet
secretary and others can come
forward and tell us this works
that works that doesn't work or
whatever we're gonna have the
window of time to before it's
actually activated and gone it
goes into effect to make the
needed changes that that are
going to they were gonna learn
about just being implemented I
do love the fact that the the
pay back period is there and in
a really big way I think that
that should help a lot of people
in the legislature and then also
on our on our tax committees and
and you know The New Mexicans
feel good that the the
legislation was crafted in a way
that that begins to pay for
itself down the road I do like
the fact that that the
studies that have done been done
in other states have actually
demonstrated that
you employers and businesses
have come forward later and and
wanted to sign up and help the
effort because they've seen the
budget provided us for their for
their their employees
being a business owner myself I
I immediately found out with the
protest was working on and I
raise my hand it's I'd love to
help you with this so that we
have a a person who owns a
business at the table as these
discussions were taking place
and I felt like I was definitely
being listened to and being part
of the the progeny of the final
product that we're seeing here
today that we're gonna see here
just a few moments when we going
to full committee so I I feel
like you know there's.
You know there's a cake being
made here that over time is
going to reap tremendous
benefits for for the people of
New Mexico for business as well
so I think the pro tem and
others for spending so much time
working with so many different
entities we heard from labor
today then at like this thing
when we first started and I
think that they have definitely
come and and with solid
solutions that work for them as
well on their members so all of
those those different factions
are very difficult to bring
together do we have everybody
one hundred percent in in
agreement probably not but I
think that's also very healthy
so that that natural tension
will be there as we do the
implementation phase should this
you know become law so I think I
just want to make the economy
questions pretty much at the
presentations were excellent but
I just wanted to lend my voice
in for support number one and
two that I do believe that that
the business community with was
definitely listen to along the
way and a lot of changes were
made as result of their feedback
thank you thank you senator
Senator Steinborn.
Thank you madam chair and
Senator and.
Representative and panelists so
I I do have a handful of
questions about this kind of
quickly moved.
I apologize would you restate
again twenty said that sixty
seven percent of businesses
would not contribute but
employees would benefit would
you restate what you meant by
that.
Yes Mr chairman and chairman.
While.
Something going on with the.
This.
And and keep in mind that we
were gone we will we will go to
the bill next for questions
additional yes so this is a
suggestion from the business
community about having very
small employers not pay and so
sixty six percent of the
employers in the state have of.
Under five employees they will
not have to contribute per of
ploidy but their employees well
so it's five dollars for every
thousand dollars of wages for
employees it's four dollars for
every thousand of wages for
employers and sixty six percent
of our employers will not have
to contribute now they only make
up nine percent of the work
force that's why the solvency
works on the fund is that the
other nine percent are paying
and then answer your question so
and first time with with your
thing is is that for small
employers less than five
employees employee would have to
pay five dollars per thousand
dollars of income the employer
would not have to pay into it
the tech sector okay and by the
way I've heard reference to an
amendment is there a new
amendments coming for this
committee yes women months that
we've put together after
speaking with the business
community a couple of days ago
okay so course these questions
with the benefit of seeing that
yet but that's okay
I I saw that madam chair Mr
chair pro tem Representative for
this issue with tons of us right
hello provided part of
contractors are included in the
definition of police as I think
I saw that middle contractors
people who are contracted work
are clued.
So I guess what I'm wondering is
for contractor
How does that work for me do you
have to be a full time
contractor for I think you would
seven pro tem at the beginning
you have to work for minimum
three months surveying what's
the delineation point if you're
a contractor for less time than
that where the trigger being
covered in a sense so I'm gonna
turn to chase you up but I'll
tell you first that self
employed
folks and often.
So some of the people you're
talking about probably self
employed and they can often
themselves.
Yes thank you
madam president and Mr chair and
senator
so the self employed folks those
are the folks that are not
getting.
Withholding from a paycheck and
they would have the opportunity
to opt in and they would be
paying only the employee
contribution because that's the
smallest smallest business
generally speaking is of a self
employed individual and the four
those who would be an employee
that there would be that pay a
payroll withholding we've had
conversations with secretary
Neier and the department of
workforce solutions about
ensuring that the third party
Education the very the the third
party like eighty P. those kinds
of programs that support
support that kind of up
bookkeeping that they would be
working in and streamlining that
but for people that are
contractors get a ten ninety
nine you're paying here gross
receipts tax you're paying all
of those other things you would
have the opportunity to often as
a self employed person.
Okay chair Mister chair
panelists
There is a ready workforce
solutions issues that were
identified in the F. I. R.
about.
Really enforcement and
Verification and all of that it.
I don't know is that dealt with
really in the bill worked out
with the new amendments
physicals a pretty substantial
issues because the thing so it's
such a workforce intensive
process of verifying claims.
Verifying who can opt in or out
that ability to be able to
identify fraud or just validate
claims is super important and so
you speak to that Mr chairman
I'll start
No we worked with secretary all
summer and fall to ensure that
we were giving workforce
solutions a bill that would work
and so yes there are
verifications it's it's all laid
out in here it's been okayed by
the department as this will work
we certainly don't want fraud
and abuse and we put those
issues in here too so and also
remember that the workforce
solutions has almost two years
to get this right before we even
start charging people so they
will tell us if they need
something else of the thirty six
million are asking for the
majority of it is for that I. T.
system
you know the New Mexico has a
history of not funding IT
systems very well we don't ask
for people to come back and
train new people or to help us
with uggs this will be a full IT
system chairman for tomorrow for
New Mexico mccamley understands
that and I we feel his pain
right
but any rate the security want
to speak to that real quick do
fill the bill isn't a place now
that that that creates
architecture works.
Mr chair Senator Steinborn
members of the committee we we
do feel that the bill as
currently drafted especially
with the amendments is workable
and a lot will hang in the
balance of the rulemaking
procedure and we're grateful for
the help here so that we will
have to make those rules that's
what will really be able to get
the input of the business
community as well as employees
in building a system that that
can be workable that can be
supported by adequate
documentation we've spoken to
almost every program that exists
already in the country and so
we've learned a lot about what
mistakes others have made and
and hopefully we'll be able to
benefit from that knowledge as
well thank you for that moving
on could this have potentially
an unintended cons
unintended consequence of
incentivizing people who are
paying for these benefits to
reduce their budget to shift on
to the state.
And have the state state you a
cost share I don't think if
they're paying a hundred percent
of this budget now they can move
to a new system where the state
would pay essentially a majority
of that benefit with that have
potentially created unintended
consequence Mr Chairman.
In other states there's only
been about three percent of
large businesses that have not
gone into the system so what's
happened in other states is the
the the bigger businesses that
already have these programs opt
into the state program it's so
much cheaper for them and then
they can offer other benefits
above that.
But they can certainly opt out
if they have after a minute a
substantially similar program
than the one we're offering you
know that's a really good point
madam chair Mr chairman for ten
which is kind of.
different than the plan I was
getting out but this is actually
a very business friendly
proposal from the standpoint of
creating it's almost like we
talk about universal health care
when we create this kind of a
rate that business I guess to
lower their costs
that's and.
Is what it is okay
Are you gonna be on the bill are
going to have I just a few more
questions funding I'm almost
done the total okay and then
I'll wanted a lighted down to
this budget madam chair.
The panelists count is is it
taxes it counted as payroll.
Counted as income essentially.
Center I'm one that question
answer that question but yes
because employer and the
employee share would be sent to
the state into the fund through
the tap system so we're going to
be counted as a as a payroll
system that's where you
detection by the federal check
would happen in to payment to
the system okay well then the
final question is which is off
the rates that are far which is
how that and if tax Medicaid and
how that changes people's income
levels and affects people's
Medicaid eligibility and.
Thank you raise people's if if
they're given this benefit and
their income rises above
Medicaid eligibility.
So
Mr chair and and Senator
Steinborn I.
One of the the features here is
that the employer would be
required to keep that person on
their insurance program if they
were already on the insurance
programs that their their income
wouldn't increase they would
have a hundred percent of
minimum wage plus sixty seven
percent of wages above that
during their leave carry it but
if they were already Medicaid
eligible because of their salary
before this wouldn't increase
their salary above what they had
previously that making.
Okay last last question Mr chair
this is treated as thank.
So thank you leave it at that
thank you all for.
Thank you very much all right I
think we are done I don't have
any other points questions to
make we're going to go on to the
field with me thank the panel
for all your information waiting
working together and now you can
just if you like to sit here in
the audience or whatever you
need to do Senator first one is
a yes for for second who's going
to stay at the table yeah and
that's fine with yes I was just
gonna say we usually just have
the Sanchez and the staff at the
table so that's why I was going
to continue with the same the
same system so okay thank you
very much you can.
Senator we have your equipment
right we're gonna go to jail.
Within the past year amendment
and then.
Go to the bill then we'll go to
the audience those are the.
From.
About twenty minutes in total
time of report for and against
we'll try to split it up
between.
And we're going to assume
operator.
Senator Hemphill make sure that
they're raise your hand on the
screen for text me or somebody
if you have a question is.
So
Stewart
For a.
Senate Bill.
And we have.
I move the amendment for
discussion Mr chairman second.
So Mister.
The committee Senator Rodriguez
may.
Any objection to the motion.
Junction.
Senator so Mister chairman we
the that would this is community
Tuesday of this week we've got
some written things from Mr
black.
So what we are offering our
For amendments concerning what
he brought up and three
amendments for what we found in
the bill so the first one and
two and three we inadvertently
left out the definition for
Indian tribes and so that we
just making sure that we thought
we've got that in there so
that's number one and two.
And three we strike tribal
governments and answer their of
what we've up amended in the
definition.
On page.
Amendment number four this is
brought up by Mr black today
also number four number five we
take out from the bill the
requirement that.
Up to get a waiver to opt out of
being in the program you have to
have an equal program and
instead of that we put in
substantially similar that way
it gives the the secretary more
leeway it gives people that have
maybe there have twelve weeks
but they pay for the whole an
employee and it's eight or nine
or ten May not substantially
similar and so that language we
think will give more flexibility
on those waivers and we've done
them on page nine and Page ten
in addition on page six seven we
are changing the minimum amount
you can get from the Lee from
four hours to eight hours a
business community I think feels
like it's a lot easier to manage
if you're gone for a day and so
we've made that change for them.
And then the last one from Mr
black just wanted to ensure that
the upon completion of the
interment intermittent leave
claim there was
Eight finding an ending for that
claim that both the employer and
workforce solutions got and so
those are the amendments and
we're happy to answer questions.
You want to explain the bill.
The where the amendment share.
Yes of the bill sets up a fund
percent did this where you're
gonna.
That's a painful process you
shortage that's right that's
right that set up a fund such a
program for
employees warriors to contribute
into a fund to have a paid
family medical leave for three
purposes for really one
pregnancy with the maternal and
paternal leave available
if you're seriously medically
ill yourself and that has to be
documented by doctors or if the
member of your family is so that
your care taker and that has to
be documented in addition life
of four or five other states we
put in a safe provision for
those women that are impacted by
domestic violence sexual assault
where they have to move quickly
but business take some leave it
cetera so what the one in
Connecticut they've had a safe
we policy fifteen claims in the
last year I'm not talking ten
percent we're talking of small
number of people that would be
in this category.
So it's delayed for almost two
years to give the workforce
solutions the ability to educate
businesses and employees about
the benefits and how it works
there are there's plenty of
provisions in the bill on how to
ensure that these claims are
accurate there will be a
rulemaking to make this as easy
on businesses as it is to do
unemployment insurance to work
for we're compensation are I
heard anything else that to take
out of an employee
paychecks.
so employees will pay four
dollars five dollars for every
thousand dollars wages employers
will pay four dollars out of a
thousand dollars of wages we
given the secretary the
requirement to do an annual
solvency review.
What's happened in two of the
other eleven states with this
annual solvency review is that
they've been able to lower the
contributions we anticipate that
it could be a lower contract
contribution in the future
especially after the six years
we're we're paying the the state
back from the first amount of
money you.
that solvency review it doesn't
happen for several years until
we get the program up and
running.
we believe we've given the
secretary the ability to make
this into a really good program
and let me just say one more
thing and that is there is a
cap.
The cap is based on
the
Medium weight medium weights
that we have so that cap right
now is nine hundred ninety seven
dollars that's if you're making
sixty thousand dollars we paid
the full amount for the first
minimum wage and above that we
pay sixty seven percent we want
employees to want to go back to
work you know it's the it's the
policy behind unemployment
insurance look for a job will
help you to find one this is
okay take your time here's some
money to compare the bills keep
the lights on up but your
employer is waiting for you and
your job will be saved so we
think it's a good program it's
worked really well in other
states it's it's better to look
at how it's worked in other
states than anything else
because we're patterned it after
the other states that work the
best we also looked in
particular at Oregon and
Washington because they have a
large rural populations like we
do and so that's a general
overview Mr Chairman.
Thank you can have a motion to
adopt the amendment.
This
motion in the second.
Center this week call the roll
Senator healthier for you online
with.
And I think he's going to call
the roll yeah.
Senator Burt.
Senator Campos yes.
Senator Diamond no.
Senator Gonzales fifty one
Senator Gonzales is still having
trouble getting and he'll be in
on momentarily.
Senator Hemphill.
Yes.
Senator Padilla yes.
Senator share no.
Senator Steinborn.
Senator Woods.
Senator Rodriguez yes.
Senator Munoz.
We get stable that.
I I.
Last night I before production
we're back on the bill questions
from committee.
Mr Chairman.
Thank you and because of the
state of time and I know I've
got to present a bill to but
first I want to think that the
Sanchez and everyone working
Representative today those in
the audience who works so hard
on this I have to say that I
have heard this several times
maybe we all heard it I think
most of us anyway on LFC and
throughout the the summer in
different committees and so on
and just like anything else you
know many times we try to get
something perfect and we can't.
But that's why the system exists
so that we can proceed to
perfect things as best we can as
we go on but one thing that
isn't changing and isn't
different and doesn't ever
change is one fact and that is
that the employees are the
business.
And that's where we need to look
to first how can we in helping
the employees we help the
business and that's really in in
that show what I have to say I'm
a mom the mother of two children
and when I heard the resonate
with me very deeply I heard it
was stated today par Sanchez
that many women I don't remember
what the total amount is but it
was half of women at least don't
go don't participate in the work
force because we have so much to
do with children and you know
what we dread having to go work
and now that we have a need to
take a day off not only for
ourselves but for our children
or family because if we don't
get paid for that that that's a
real problem we are you know the
bread winners times and and we
just provide so much care to the
entire family so I think that.
You know in working together our
businesses and employees and us
in one congregation to try and
finally find a.
The balance to this whole thing
of the the need that we have in
supplying in providing employees
with the time they need when
it's necessary as the statistics
have been stated it doesn't seem
to be something that is to be
used in any way it's something
that happens only when it has to
be and so I you know I'm Mr
Chairman I'm going to support
this bill and hope that as we
continue with the rules and so
on that it would make it a
little bit easier and and more
streamlined and more easily
understood and work for thank
you.
All
jump and myself so we're gonna
do twenty minutes of public
comment if it goes that long.
It's a piece.
will start in the room will
split up ten fourteen the game.
We'll start in the room so.
Those you want to come stand in
in in support will go first.
As.
What do that.
Seven Mike that.
The committee thank you Mr chair
members the committee John the
kids with the New Mexico
federation of labor as stated in
the previous panel we stand in
strong support of this measure
and thank the sponsors for
bringing it up
you know I think it's been said
a few times might not be the
perfect bill but we certainly
very much like this bill and we
will do whatever we can to help
get it passed so thank you very
much and we hope you'll do the
same.
Mr chair members of the
committee see on the on the on
behalf of A. A. R. P. New Mexico
and the advocacy director A. R.
P. was part of the paid family
medical leave task force we
believe that this policy is
extremely important for
caregivers who take care of the
elderly and family members who
may be disabled especially in
rural areas in fact we have a
volunteer by the name gene
Hamrick who was able to benefit
from this policy when she
developed the multiples of
scrolls is Sir her small firm
was able to implement a of the
policy that really helped her
when she was diagnosed with this
and on behalf of our two hundred
forty thousand members statewide
we asked that to passes
of particular importance
legislation thank you.
Hello madam chair Mister chair
thank you very much for today
thank you to the sponsor
especially the Stewart
I'm Dana Middleton with the
national organization for women
and I absolutely feel that we
all support this bill
wholeheartedly for women and
families in New Mexico I think
it's Weiss I think it's time.
And I know families businesses
will benefit from it thank you
so much.
Yes Mr chairman members of the
committee chair works better
than Mexico council university
presidents I'm here terms of
this one estimate that in higher
education for community colleges
universities we support
medically for employees and
provide the best budget we can
I'm here to talk about the need
for an appropriation for this
legislation it's in the FIR and
eyes economic tensions page nine
where it the beginning of the
have fired states costs that
would be for state state agency
personnel so one doesn't include
higher at the beginning so you
mentioned in here that the
higher ed FIR is is is it in
addition to that so just for the
committee where it's roughly
about nine million dollar cost
on the employer side and I need
to be able to tell the committee
at this time that we would be
requesting one work with the
sponsor to get an appropriation
for FY twenty five because this
is affected January just keep in
mind that one percent nine need
for higher education is not
seven point two million dollars
and the reason I bring this up
is because that we can have to
pass it on intuition so I went
committee be aware since our our
hearings tomorrow and we're
talking about the budget that
just to keep this money in the
future also would like to work
with the sponsor and the
secretary
keep in mind bureau does not
represent the universities
they're independent somewhat and
so we like to be part of a
stakeholders group or be part of
the making process as well we we
would volunteer for that as well
Mr chairman thank you thank you.
Chair members the committee just
a cow tree CHI St Joseph's
children we run the largest home
visiting program in the state
serving all counties in the
state joining with families
prenatally and tell their babies
reach three years old so we know
very well the importance of
maternity and paternity leave
there's been numerous studies
that show that there's improves
health of mother and child
decreases infant mortality
decreases rates of head trauma
in children under two years old
these are cost savings to the
states when we are able to
provide mom dad and baby the
opportunity to have a home where
they can have their full
attention so thank you so much.
Mr chair members of the
committee my name is we just
Sanchez and I am the co
executive director of the New
Mexico Public Health Association
I'm here on behalf of our over
three hundred fifty members who
are public health workers in
every region of the state we
participated in the task force
and stand in strong support of
this bill we cannot have a
healthy Communities New Mexico
without supporting people to
keep employment while in shortly
to care for newborns themselves
or other family members or to
seek safety when experiencing
intimate partner violence it's
an essential policy thank you.
Almost I mean part but I have to
have some people assume so thank
you in the number try to jump Mr
chair members of the committee
on the river Holly Beaumont
organizing director of
interfaith worker justice New
Mexico we're a network of people
of faith and people of
conscience to advocate for
workers rights and economic dept
Justice this bill is an
investment in the future of our
state by supporting our common
good so many of our working
families have taken on the
enormous responsibility and cost
of raising the next generation
of New Mexicans while also
taking care of aging parents we
owe them our full support but I
want to also speak is a small
business owner Santa Fe cool in
our area and I can tell you this
past year we attempted to
partner with an organization
that was going to provide us
with at risk youth who are going
to be workers in packaging our
product they could not guarantee
us the same use every time we
got together to package the
whole project collapsed if
you're in the food business and
you don't have workers who are
well trained healthy and
responsible and reliable your
front your your your business
collapses so worker turnover is
a very real issue for businesses
and one of the best ways to
retain them is to be able to
provide them with good benefits
like this thank you thank you
we're gonna jump.
And and take the been mine just
long odds and you want to pick
three Andrea and we'll see when

stat we thank the sponsors for
introducing this important bill
the status of New Mexicos paid
family medical leave act paid
family and medical leave
supports family care giving
which recent studies have shown
reduce health care costs and
costly institutionalization for
older individuals working
parents should have the time to
care for and bond with their
newborns without this time
working parents and children
suffering the entire family is
more likely to require some form
of government assistance it is
therefore imperative that we
passed paid family medical leave
act and for all these reasons in
those by Senator panelists we
support this act urged committee
passed thank you.
I'm more.
Actually your project it will

hearing
hearing are of public comment my
name is Janet well or cheese and
I fully support this bill it's
absolutely necessary and it's
inhumane to be against this bill
in my opinion because this is
basically for all the reasons
that have been stated before I
totally support this bill and I
personally remember having given
birth and raised four children
running home from lunch to nurse
a child in making sure that she
was okay with the senator and
then having to run back because
I wasn't able to take enough
time off and and that kind of
stress I just remember those
difficult memories and I would
really I am sure I'm speaking
for all mothers and people
everywhere here that we would
really appreciate you supporting
this bill thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'll go back to the audience and
get not
minute that.

so if you guys want to line up.
You have signed that is Terry
Cole Kelley for heart of
chairman of the cheating them I
don't know who else is let me
reset this.
One two minutes apiece.
Mr chairman and members of the
committee on Terri Cole
president CEO for the greater
Albuquerque chamber of commerce
I'm also offering comments today
for bill Lee CEO of the Gallup
McKinley county chamber of
commerce he's in surgery we
oppose this legislation for
three reasons first and imposes
a new tax on employers and
employees a lot the latest in a
string of the increased costs
can pro business by government
by the pandemic and by high
inflation second this bill harms
small business the most the lack
the flexibility to absorb long
term vacancies and move
employees around to fill gaps
billing notes there are three
long term Gallup businesses who
if this legislation passes would
require them to leave the state
and moved thirty miles west to
Arizona this is not what we want
for our state if you pass this
bill New Mexico will become more
corporate and less unique and
third we cannot understate just
how hard it is to manage a small
business under circumstances
where so much leave under
section lose conditions could be
taken with such frequency by its
employees I've had the good
fortune to be involved in this
legislative process for forty
years the program created by
this bill would be massive
larger than the unemployment
insurance program two hundred
plus employees you've read the
LFC analysis it's likely and
solve it and there are more
unanswered serious questions
raised by this bill than this
building has germs in forty
years with these kinds of fiscal
policy problems we've all seen a
bill doesn't go forward in this
state it's just not ready people
take a breath taking meaningful
engagement if so that it happens
and makes room for fund will
sizeable changes to be made
that's the proper path forward
and I urge that can.
Miti to oppose the bill today
thank you for the time.
I'm pretty good at two minutes.
I
wish I had money that well right
now Mr chair members of the
committee my names are called
I'm speaking on behalf of
ambulance providers.
durable medical equipment
providers
home healthcare providers and
private childhood providers all
private businesses are revenues
are very limited because we are
mostly supported by revenue from
Medicaid that's over ninety
percent of our business and New
Mexico we don't have an ability
to sell more things to raise
more money to cover these
increased costs you're all well
aware of the forty year
inflation highs we're dealing
with incredible increase in
labor costs we've increased
minimum wage sixty percent in
the last four years Santa fe's
minimum wage is about to go up
another dollar an hour in eight
days trying to replace these
employees is far more
challenging the whole folks
would have you understand we've
got a significant labor lack of
participation in New Mexico.
It's very expensive to get
people to replace the specific
jobs and then what we do with
the temporaries I would just say
anecdotally you might look when
they talk about utilization when
the governor and I'm sure return
to work program for employees
that had a hundred percent paid
family medical leave I read
significant things from the
unions about as many as ten
twenty percent of their members
choosing to quit their state
jobs rather than return to work.
We cannot gentleman we're gonna
try to go to one minute so we
can get everybody aligned
because there's only one person
on the.
Two people not physicians and so
thanks Mr chair committee
members Jeremiah Richie in
general counsel for New Mexico
mutual we're the largest workers
compensation carrier in the
state of New Mexico
The workers compensation act as
a very deliberate provided
designed to encourage and and
facilitate three the prompt
return to work of injured
workers this is a mutual benefit
employers can control their
costs and retain talented
workers by offering a part time
or modified duties and.
Workers also benefit we know
that they have better economic
better physical and better
emotional outcomes if they get
back to work quickly the
legislature recognize that it's
detrimental to this design if
workers can receive more
compensation when they're not
working the one they're working
Senate bill eleven right now
allow an injured worker on work
comp to also collect payment
FMLA benefits which would result
in between a hundred thirty
percent two hundred sixty six
percent of their pre injury
wages and
Having these these overlapping
benefits is confusing it's it's
opportunity for fraud and abuse
worst of all would undermine a
key provision of the workers
compensation act for that reason
because thank you.
Mr Chairman since the committee
my name is Matt Cody on the
president and founder oil and
gas workers so ciation longer
speak for you today.
On behalf of our forty seven
thousand members a lot of them
here in New Mexico I want to say
very clearly that no hundred
waters was set earlier labor is
not fully on board with this
sheet where American one gas
workers were talking about in
our taxes raised
and this Senate bill eleven the
raise your taxes bill I believe
it's being called the paid
family and medical leave act but
that's what this bill will do to
every New Mexico workers already
struggling under the weight of
inflation now this that is done
it before and we're so we've got
some examples to look back on
every time New Mexico has raised
the minimum wage which another
one just took effect this year
every time the minimum wage has
gone up every time taxes have
been raised implores of had to
eliminate hold positions but
that reduces the number of hours
for those who still had jobs
thus reducing the benefits for
those who still have a job it's
a bad idea all around
I want to say that it's very
clear that everyone pays not
everybody uses it and the
gentleman earlier who said that
we're making a cake today I
would just go along those lines
and say that this is definitely
a pie it's a cow pie to the face
of every New Mexican worker
who's tired of having their
taxes raised we propose.
About four minutes left so
thirty seconds you're gonna have
to get quick is going to get one
options your members the
committee my name is Amy Dixon
executive director doesn't
states physical therapy network
by Representative thirty
outpatient physical therapy
clinics throughout the state we
understand the state pays a
percentage of the salary of the
person taking paid family
medical leave making these
monies available for hiring
temporary staff but hiring
temporary staff for clinical
replacement is next to
impossible as recruitment for
physical therapists in New
Mexico is very difficult in
addition insurance companies
require health care
practitioners to be credentialed
before treating patients and
this process can take eight to
ten weeks and is not retroactive
if you choose an employment
agency can find a traveling
therapist the traveler provider
costs more than the fixed rate
of payment for the services and
if we're unable to find a
replacement access to services
becomes even a bigger issue
creating undue burden already on
stress staff so we do
respectfully oppose the
legislation thank you thank you
one second Kelly we're gonna
jump to zoom in.
Mr chair this is Allison Smith
from The New Mexico restaurant
association.
Good afternoon Mister chair
members of the committee my name
is Allison Smith registered
lobbyists The New Mexico
restaurant association the
reporting is assumed for
employees taking long term paid
family medical leave this
requirement could be difficult
for restaurants with the small
workforce were single worker may
constitute a large share of the
business output for when it
comes to specialty jobs such as
chefs or cooks who require
specialized training and
certifications restaurants may
be forced to stretch their
remaining employees duties to
cover the apps and co worker or
the restaurant may have to hire
someone new to cover their
duties and then be forced to
release that new worker on the
return of the work on paid
family medical leave thankfully
stand in opposition to this
legislation thank you for your
time.
One more.
We also Leri on the and
allowing the amount speak.
There you go about one minute.
Good afternoon Mister chair
members of the committee Leri
Sonntag a small business owner
and part of the better together
New Mexico grassroots advocacy
network this bill would be a
disaster as previously mentioned
for small business owners the
financial implications were
covered by the LFC gentleman
saying there are so many
unknowns but what is known as
you think that thirty three
percent of businesses are going
to be covering the cost the
millions and millions and
millions of dollars that are
going to be required to fund
this program that's not
realistic I'd urge you to vote
no on SB eleven thank you.
Can.
The committee members Kelly K.
Fajardo on here and we have a
broadband broad spectrum which
did this for a New Mexico
business coalition New Mexico
business coalition
Representative hundreds of
businesses and they just
recently did a study and ninety
four percent of their and
members oppose this legislation
we've also heard back from
employees as well who do not
like the mandate of having to
pay for something that may they
may not use so for those points
in the points are you spoke and
we sat in opposition of this
bill thank you.
Mr chairman and members of the
committee to me Rivera with New
Mexico farm and livestock bureau
on behalf of our state's farmers
and ranchers who are already
struggling to maintain an
adequate workforce we stand in
with a flop addition.
Chili king.
Thank you Mr chairman and
committee Travis a registered
lobbyist The New Mexico Chile
Association we do stand respect
opposition of this bill we do
have questions and concerns on
how migrant seasonal workers
will be impacted by this bill
they do meet the six month
paying requirement and a lot of
them don't come back next year
so essentially we're taking
money out of poverty stricken
workers and they're not reading
seeing any benefit from it so
for that reason we oppose of
the.
Mr chairman members of the
committee Charlie Marcus
registered lobbyists for New
Mexico health care association
again Mister hall talked about
Medicaid issues there are no
provisions for any kind of
reimbursement in Medicaid for
this and just just becomes
another mandate that is not
reimbursed so we stand in
opposition thank you.
Chair members the committee just
weeks representing the New
Mexico hospitality association
and the Albuquerque Hispanic
chamber of commerce the
hospitality association there
are a lot of seasonal employees
that are employed it does
businesses tend to have a lot of
employees but they're very small
margin and they will margin
businesses and they are local
businesses this will affect
their businesses negatively
every little thing that is
tipped on in terms of
requirements in terms of
benefits for employees is one
additional cost it's hard to
implement these things from the
small business perspective and
it's hard to manage them from
small business perspective we
certainly care about and value
our employees deeply but these
provisions make it really hard
for us to operate our businesses
for the Albuquerque Hispanic
chamber of commerce it is a
small business chamber state
which basically represents
companies on a statewide level
the chamber stands a respectful
opposition for many of the same
reasons but the chamber is sort
of an innovator they try to
create new business locally this
will be an impediment from the
chambers perspective to the
development of some of those
businesses we stand up thank
you.
Shin from committee members
Senator time on your first.
Okay
madam chairman.
Madam chair
What about the opt out.
Those are local governments
opted out of this.
Another.
It's a state government office
out of this.
Well I mean they can they
probably won't.
This is for everybody.
Okay.
For the small businesses we
talked about earlier with fewer
than five employees.
The employees themselves is it
mandatory participation yes okay
and Mr chair.
Commemorative how's that how are
the fees assessed and at what
point are they assess.
So that Mr Chairman will be done
through rural at believe it's
going to be quarterly workforce
solutions is set up for
collections of things so it'll
just be the normal collection of
of fees.
And we have not laid everything
out thoroughly in this bill
because it's really up to
workforce solutions and the
secretary to do rulemaking and
to make sure that small
businesses are taking care of in
this and that their needs are
answered.
And then final question Mr
chairman pro tem Representative
went when will the fees start.
January one twenty twenty five.
That's the the fund will start
accepting applications the
program January one twenty
twenty six.
Okay I have thank you Mr.
number.
Thank you Mr chair
in I I'm just kind of curious
about the task force and we are
a lot of people on there and I
think Senator Padilla had some
input on that but how much of
the task force was actual
business owners and managers.
Mr chair Senator Burt there was
one small business owner as well
as I chambers of commerce on the
committee.
Okay
the reason I ask the question
obviously is this affects small
business and you only heard from
one well to.
People I have this whole
process.
You know these are the people
that are impacting the morning
brought to the table to be part
of this process.
I think just doesn't work for me
I don't think it should work for
the state quite frankly I think
we ought to go back to the
drawing board for something like
that.
I'm a small business owner.
I've been in business for thirty
four years.
People who work with me not for
me with me on my best asset.
And I work for over twenty five
years to find the right people
to work with me.
And I got.
In one of my star sales people
have heart problems and had to
have surgery and was off for
four months I paid a full salary
all that time I to wait she want
to go back to work from my house
I'd wait till the not give me a
note saying she's okay to go
back to work.
That's the way most small
businesses in New Mexico work.
I have another part of my
morning team who is disabled she
has chronic medical problems.
And out of the twenty two days a
month that she's supposed to be
on the air she makes about
twelve I don't have a problem
with that because she provides
when she's on is amazing.
In one market loves her.
That's what this is all about
and now you mandating another
tax more impediments on a small
business to make sure people are
taking care of do we do any kind
of research to figure out of
small businesses are taking care
of these people or did we just
assume that they're not and
we're going to mandate the small
business must come on to this
program I just don't think
that's right I think that's the
finish if I may please thank
you.
So I just think that we continue
to do this process we don't
include the people that affects.
In the we don't get any feedback
from them to see if it's working
or not.
So I know that there's a lot of
research that went into this and
I can respect that my industry
built on research.
But researchers speculation and
how many times have I heard in
Mexico legislation that we have
none
research into how much something
is going to cost and then we get
down the road five years we find
out it's way more than that.
How much should have cities and
counties been hurt.
By lower estimate a lower
estimations about taking food
tax off of food.
Has impacted counties we're
still trying to get them back up
to a certain speed I can
understand and respect reserves
but I can also tell you I talk
to people I am I have
programmers I am re uh der
personalities I have sales
people on the street in my town
and other towns that I talk to
white groups and all of and this
is not to say all of the vast
majority of them are telling me
that this is going to be in and
do burden on them that they take
care of their people and when
they get people who in turn over
the reality is they will come on
board for a while bill bill work
up to the time that they get
these benefits and then they
start using the benefits and now
you have a critical part of your
business that runs on a very
small margin with him out
because peel or whatever the
case may be over the course of
weeks.
And so your productivity goes
down the quality of what you
produce goes down and so I don't
think that is taken into
consideration here.
I'm trying to give you some real
time real world impact of real
life business my business and
furniture businesses car
dealerships and things like that
in my town in in in the right
also Lincoln County area because
of folks and I really talked to
a lot.
This is what they're telling me.
This is gonna be an undue burden
on them they want to take care
of their people but they don't
like being mandated like this I
think this is a bad bill and I
think that there is
possibilities of maybe
restriction this and maybe
coming back to making it a
better bill for all those that
it affects not just chambers of
commerce but the people who own
businesses and maybe that would
work out but I'll tell you right
now in its current form
structure it's an undue burden
on small business it's a tax on
small business and now we've got
more government and bureaucracy
to deal with and on top of that.
In three years we have built of
your options it's a hundred
twenty two million dollars
reoccurring.
State and you're also insolvent.
In the fund.
It's just not very well folks I
know we've done a lot of work on
this.
But this is the work internally
and researching but I don't
think it's real world and I'm
trying to give you the other
side of the street has always
two sides to the story.
And we're missing the other side
of the story that's what I'm
trying to find today thank you
Mr.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
to this point develop thank you
for to the presenters who came
in here today I want to begin by
asking a couple questions there
was a mention earlier that there
would be no double dipping into
workers comp is that correct.
I believe that's a correct
statement I understand Mr chair
and Senator that of the
individual from the workers from
the county insurance company
came forth and with the concern
certainly quick we can clarify
that but under state law workers
compensation is the exclusive
remedy for workers who are
injured at work so if that's not
clear in the bill we certainly
Mr chair and representative
Senator can adjust the language
to be very clear on that point
okay Mister chairman to follow
up on that we offer New Mexico
offers a domestic violence leave
so up to fourteen days for that
with the domestic violence leave
would they still qualify that in
addition to the three months of
paid medical.
Mr chair and etcetera I'm not
familiar with that program is
that a state program for state
employees yes well certainly we
can we can try to address that
I'm not familiar with that
program that might be in rural
and if the state chooses to
participate in it will unless it
opts out actually so it will be
this program I think would take
subsume that program Mr chair
and senator.
Mr thank you Mr chairman and and
if we move on to the New Mexico
healthy workplaces Act with
those qualifying days be in
addition to state medical.
So that is a different program
that is basically the very
different than this this is for
long term very serious illness
you have to get approved by your
doctor or you're pregnant that's
not what the paid sick leave
bill and so so just to clarify
if you took your three months on
on on a medical leave or do you
still qualify for your paid sick
leave yes in addition and just
remember that most people take
from six to seven weeks sitting
get back working get their
salary that okay there was there
was some quick comparisons Mr
chairman to to other states in
fact I think one of the
comparison was to Oregon but
organs organs that rate medicals
a little bit different although
they do offer twelve weeks their
program is exempts any small
businesses fewer than twenty
five employees sat correct no
that's not correct
Mr chair and and Senator Diamond
actually it's it's similar to
our waiver of the the
contributions for our for those
have did have fewer than five
employees they have a labor of
contributions for those that
have fewer than twenty five
employees it's not an exemption
from the program just from a
waiver of the of the employer
contribution okay so Mister
chairman so so then businesses
with fewer than twenty five
employees can exempt themselves
to the program and in this case
we're doing it for fewer than
eight.
We're for waiver for fewer than
five and those employees aren't
sent they pay and it's the
employers that are there exempt
from the program with organ it
it seems to be much different as
you go through the of the
different states that what kind
of programs they're offering
what if you could summarize this
to any of the states with paid
medical also have mandatory sick
leave.
Mr chair and and Senator Diamond
actually all of the states that
and the district of Columbia
that have paid family and
medical leave are a subset of a
larger number of states that
have earned sick leave
legislation so all of yes states
have paid sick leave all of them
have both paid sick leave and
now a paid family medical leave
district okay that's not really
clearly defined on some of their
website so I appreciate you you
organizing explaining that
some of the concerns or product
and several of the documents
refers receive states that
there's really a narrow time
frame for businesses to consider
those claims and we know coming
out of COVID we saw a lot of
abuse and fraud for for PPP
basis or unemployment fraud.
Can you can you go into the
safeguards for businesses to
ensure that there isn't frankly
just abuse of this in which
there are you can go to the
safeguards to to ensure that
these are valid claims that they
take.
Mr chairman I'll start and then
I can just others so first of
all you have to be approved by
the workforce solutions for this
late you have to have
documentation about your own
illness or the illness of your
family family member that you're
taking care of you have to show
a certificate of eighty that you
have so there are safeguards in
place by the workforce solutions
so they're the ones that have
proved your leave not your
employer and there are all kinds
of provisions about fraud and
abuse also.
Mr chair sponsors of Bill how
long do they have to respond to
that if I put in a claim
workforce assuming can't sit on
it for weeks if I need to take
my time off what is the turn
around time they need to
determine that.
The state.
It's ten days they have ten days
to respond.
I I can go through this I think
we went through the FIR is many
of you stated some concerns with
that I understand clearly why
this bill is in Senate finance
committee there's a large
financial impact factors
documents here that predicted
bankruptcy by twenty twenty
seven and I think mainly because
we can't accurately predict the
number of claims here I I do
have some questions of maybe why
it didn't go to Senate Judiciary
first and I'll explain I I
question the constitutionality
the taking of any monies from
these employees that really is a
tax on employees that they may
if there's not an option to opt
out of these programs I think
that the bill allows a lot of
leeway for the workforce
solutions secretary to increase.
rates without any oversight and
doing that so are there for
increasing taxes two employees
out there and then as as a as a
woman of child bearing age when
I read it I wonder if this has
the potential of creating a
discrimination against women my
age and I say this because we
know that by law you shouldn't
discriminate but if I walk in
and I'm applying for a job still
of childbearing age or perhaps
it's no that I have a sick
child.
There so many financial I'm more
of a liability to that employer
than someone who may not do that
for women who have worked so
hard to have equal consideration
I wonder if sometimes we're not
creating a set back here in
because we know that by law they
shouldn't do that but clearly
far more of a liability than
Senator share walking in and
provide for the same job.
I do.
So I would like to Sanchez essay
do you see.
Do you see this how how this may
actually creates form of.
Unintended discrimination as we
walk in because some people have
it have the potential of needing
to take sick leave far more than
others.
In answer to first and then I
would like Representative
generals so what's happening
now.
Why do we have half of the women
of work age not working
eighties.
Yeah they have to stay home with
the babies they don't know they
don't get help from their
employer me what happens now
they just fire people because
they don't show up for work
because they're pregnant or they
have to quit because they had a
C. section eighty six weeks off
not one or two.
So I I don't think it's
discrimination I think this
helps women more than men
actually and I think it helps
businesses because it gives the
business a way to keep the
employee and not have to pay
them when they're off yes they
have to pay during the years so
does the employee but it's an
insurance program and it's a way
to keep your employee coming
back patient keep their job and
they want to come back because
they're not getting their whole
salary are only getting sixty
seven percent of that so it's
designed to help businesses deal
with of women in their twenties
thirties forties and if you
listen to Mark Moores in their
fifties all of whom are of child
bearing age and we want people
to have babies don't wait.
Mr chairman I would think now
what happens now is people take
maternity leave or if that's not
offered to their workplace but
thank they have a family I think
senator Byrd actually mentioned
they're working at a place that
there is hi employee morale and
which their work they work
together as a family and they
make exceptions for that and if
they don't then they seek
employers or employment that
offer offer benefits that
benefit them directly.
I still wonder if this is worthy
of Senate judiciary review I I'm
I was confused to see that this
hadn't come directly from that
committee instead
I think is if we wrap this up I
think the concern is our
businesses out there concerned
about absorbing costs but this
isn't just an impact on small
business which there is no doubt
there's an enormous impact on
but it's also want to employees
and unnecessary tax on employees
and fort specifically those who
can't afford to lose leave any
more of their paycheck out it's
a coming out of COVID I think
that what happens is you have
about three different scenarios
you have large businesses who
can absorb the cost government
maybe it doesn't look like we
can do that for long or the
services offered especially in
rural areas when that employee
is out of office and I think
that's probably the most likely
when we talk about rural New
Mexico I think there was someone
here a physical therapist to
mention happen if someone leaves
our physical therapy unit in
truth or consequences there are
no replacement and she's has to
hold that she can go out you
can't replace that there's no
temporary replacement that can
come in and so an entire
community is void of that
service I think the worst case
then would that officially
businesses.
Close or at least see no growth
I received a phone call from
local newspaper down south that
has seven employees and I can
tell you they're looking to
expand its newspaper there's no
we're not offering any incentive
for small businesses especially
in rural areas to to grow in for
for an area that needs jobs as
desperately as they do when you
put mandates like this on
You can understand why they
can't they can't absorb these
costs and I stay here because I
know we all know this has the
votes to pass and I'm going to
assume that has to travel
through it'll be on a party line
vote everyone has their orders
but I would hope that we can get
with small businesses as this
project progresses small
businesses understand how we can
at least make this better
because this really is a poison
pill for Spani back in New
Mexico businesses perhaps not in
Albuquerque but you will see
greater impacts outside of the
Bernalillo county area and it
has a lot of people very worried
including myself there's many of
us would like to make this
better I don't know how we make
it better but this is
devastating for New Mexico and I
think that that's been clear
today thank you.
Thank you Senator what.
Senator Padilla.
Thank you Mr chairman thanks for
the opportunity.
The first questions I've got it
is the thirty six million five
hundred thousand is that in HB
two.
Right now.
No it's not Senator.
I'm sorry.
Not Mister chairman Senator
Woods and that is the amount
that we're going to pay that six
million a year and it should be
a nonrecurring so we're hoping
we can get it in it over here.
Okay.
Okay.
All right so I read in your
bill.
On page six line fifteen this is
a workforce solution is going to
be the department that handles
this
and then just leave
compensation to the.
Paid family leave and medical
leave act and then they're going
to disperse on page nineteen
money shall be just first slide
warrants issued by the
department of finance and
administration pursuit of about
teachers sent by the secretary
and so then that secretary is
the same secretary.
The workforce solutions.
That's correct okay.
So.
The.
We go to a long explanation of.
How are you going to.
Assess.
the employee.
Of one and a half percent this
is on page eight line seven.
In the land eight.
And the end of laminated says
assessed against each other for
one and a half percent of the
employees earnings.
About.
How do you determine that news
is that before or after with.
Mr chair Senator.
Before.
But before he's so that's a
total gross thirty.
Check the total amount for with
a okay.
And over here.
Mr chairman we change the word
earnings to wages it was
inconsistent in the bill so
that's all been changed to
wages.
Has the wages are to identified
in statute and through the
workforce solutions or using
their definition right so Mr
chair and senator you're leaving
this to rural.
No no no we the definition and
the bill of wages comes from the
work for solution definition of
wages okay.
Speaker on.
Family leave and start talking
about.
Two minutes this committee.
And then you might be able to
what pages some factors in me.
Of.
When we start talking about as
the employee has left.
And is all important leave.
But the employer six up he is of
the employees part of this.
Contribution nope your is that
right now Mr Chairman the
employee's contribution is five
dollars for every thousand
employers is four dollars for
every thousand employer doesn't
pay the employees contribution.
No I saw that somewhere in here
but let's go to page twenty
nineteen and.
And when you say.
Reasonable efforts.
Is there a lot of the.
Definitions in the law that
describes what reasonable effort
is.
So Mister chair you're talking
about line five I'm talking
about page twenty line tune.
Number one make a reasonable
effort.
Can you give me the definition
of reasonable efforts Mr chair
Senator.
Well Mister chairman I I
consider it the English language
so this is where we're asking
the employee to let the employer
know what's going on with that
so
so it's making a reasonable
effort to schedule Lee so as not
to disrupt the operations of the
employer no so we're trying to
make sure there's a good
relationship there and if if
it's leave that.
You know could be adjusted a
little bit like it's of
pregnancy leave them to work
with your import employer.
Hester cosponsored it is a a.
Legal definition of reasonable
effort Mr chairman.
And representative.
Mr chair and senator I'm glad
you asked that
I've been informed by counsel
who's been who's sitting next to
me that in the federal family
medical leave there is a
definition of reasonable effort
and Mr chair and senator it's my
expectation that workforce
solution in their rule making
authority will be looking to
those kinds of sources to inform
what should be in rural so I
expect yes there is a rule there
is a definition of federal law
and I imagine will come close to
following them Mr chair and
senator well and with that Mr
chair.
We have definitions of the
fruit.
Well when we put it on this
missions there.
And and when was just that.
I'm not an attorney.
Mr chair.
But in a in a family of
attorneys.
And I know that some things need
get litigated and if we could
keep thing from let's get
litigated in this little piece
right here it would be a
beautiful thing to have done and
it may be a reason to take it to
to Senate Judiciary for that
very reason to see what else is
in here that could be.
Brought forward but I will move
on.
Chair.
Lemming you Senator Woods moving
on.
You moving on the next question
moving on to the next question
some were in here it talks
about.
The.
About the.
Thank you.
The employees.
But I can't find it right off
so.
To something else.
Center number.
Until we see if.
Okay thanks twenty two line
eighteen hundred G..
The employer shall maintain it
chair of health insurance
premiums and maintain an
employees health care coverage
while the employee is on.
Leave pursuant to the paid
family leave act under the terms
that the employee would have
received if the floor had not
taken leave so does that mean.
That the employee never gets
reimbursed for those.
Shares all this means is that we
when you're on leave you
continue with your health care
that you have with your employer
and the employer continues
keeping you on the health care
that you have with the employer
that's all that says in Mr chair
but it says right here.
That the employer will pick up
the employee share.
No no they just continue their
normal health care coverage
whatever part the employer pays
if they do it all and the
employee has to continue making
their payments for the health
care in that name and with that
Mr chair Senator does it also
pick up the share of the
temporary employee who has to
hire to pay for this employee
time off if they're long enough
so that he or she have to pass
to hire someone yeah that they
don't pay the employees wages
when they're off on leave the
fund pays their wages with the
but Mr chair and senator he
could very well incur two
employees health care coverage.
Well if he or she pays for
health care for eight weeks now.
Okay let's talk about.
Let's talk about the time that.
That
It talks about on page twenty
four.
One eight.
It says an employer that is
found by hearing officer or.
A competent jurisdiction to have
dished charge a worker in
violation of this section shall
re hired that employees
providing to fully agrees to be
very hard.
But on down here I've wondered
what what is the financial.
grieves that might.
The employer might.
Curve on the situation and over
here on page twenty six.
On line twelve.
It says.
It says.
and
Then.
The secretary or authorized
representative shall in line do
there it says have the power to
take disciplinary action
including investigating funding
centering for recommending a
party so.
What are your flights Mr chair
and senator how much funds are
we talking about.
There are no signs in and this
bill.
It says Mr chair Senator says
finding.
Will again Mr chairman this this
is to make sure we don't have
from use we're certainly are
giving the secretary the power
to take disciplinary action
she or if that was if he does
have that now so we're just
ensuring that she or he has a he
has that ability to wiped out
front abuse from anyone who's
not doing the right thing.
Mr chairman and senator wire
bring this up.
Because I was in Judiciary
yesterday and there was some
great objections to the amount
of fines that was imposed in the
bill that I presented.
And today a community here chair
and senator and you're telling
me that well whatever the funds
may be.
So would be nice to know what
the funds are because I'm not
object to the blue lines as not
being.
Adequate or it might be too much
Mr chair and senator.
So Mr chairman that's still
something that needs to be
worked out through the rural
process with the workforce
solutions.
Okay so you're.
Mr chair and in.
It's pretty vague.
To put everything into rural.
Thank you for your.
Has no idea what he's getting
into the year.
Not
fair to the employees.
I have some objections.
One thank you if.
Thirty six million five hundred
thousand is not an H. B. two.
I don't the FIR shows.
That it the with the with the
right recovery that we have.
That we are already.
Showing in the first year of
operation it's upside down.
We're.
We're not be collecting enough
money to make additional work.
So the representation.
That we're getting here that
it's only gonna cost the
employee X. amount in the
employer X. amount.
According to this.
It says that that for all.
That all depends on how many
people use this program.
I know that.
And that's a no that we don't
know this is a different program
than most any other state.
So.
I have one more false Mr chair.
And it is from the economics
professor from the university of
Austin Mr Hammond bash.
And I.
That can be downloaded from the
I see a world leader.
But not all workers are affected
the same way by increased labor
cost.
And it says.
The change and skilled
employment is less than skilled
employment.
At increase labor costs and I
believe he's trying to say.
That is skilled labor.
This.
You get much more productive
with the out of them the
unskilled you're talking about.
The hiring temporary employees
to replace trained employees.
And acting like I should I'm in
mean that we're excuse me.
You are.
Assuming that there's no loss of
productivity to the business.
And I have great.
Heartburn with that.
I have I have worked enough
people in my life.
To know that you can't
automatically replace one with
another.
And the labor shortages we have
in our state.
I don't believe we can just
automatically do that and that
is an opinion and I apologize
for that Senator.
Thank you chairman I I never
said that and I don't assume
that.
And I go back to us you will
what happens now.
Because you lose employees to
get pregnant they have to we
have to go have the dating are
they get sick they have to take
care of people and and what you
doing mainly.
You know I mean Senator Burt
sells like a great program he
can opt out he's there is a
better program that we're
offering but this is the case
now with businesses people get
sick lately they have babies and
if they're not given some time
off they have to leave for that
too so this is something that
businesses have to deal with now
we're trying to give them a way
to help them it's not very
expensive for either employee or
employer I think it's well
thought out it is what's
happening in other states I mean
most of the other states have a
better program and we're
suggesting but but the ones that
have what we're suggesting it
works and it's been working for
years so we just have to base
this on research and trying to
help employees and employers
both and I think that's what
we're trying to do my analysis
Mr chair shows thirteen other
states have this program.
And we have fifty states in the
union.
And my email is one and two to
one against this particular
bill.
Thank you Mr chair Senator
Padilla.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
madam pro Teman presenters so
When we talked about I just
thought you know wanted to
spring a little more attention
to who were the business
coalitions that were
specific business coalitions
that were part of this working
group.
So Mr chair and Senator Padilla
at the it was I'm trying to help
I can remember them all the New
Mexico chamber of commerce the
New Mexico business coalition
the help business alliance the
has Spanish a member of
Commerce.
In the American Indian chamber
of commerce thank you.
Thank you Mr chairman and so
that I know that the Hispano
chamber has north of.
One thousand members I know the
business coalition has I'm told
more than two hundred and fifty
members Mr chairman with your
permission of staff Mr black who
is still here how many members
are in the New Mexico chamber of
commerce Mr plus with your
permissions from.
About five hundred so if you put
all that together on average
we're probably looking at at
least north of a thousand
businesses had a voice at the
table with that the actor.
Yes Mr chair and and senator
okay and then I just know that
the the moment might begin
engagement with this project I
did fan the the the bill and a
couple other items out to the
Albuquerque chamber The New
Mexico coalition the business
but the New Mexico business New
Mexico chamber of commerce the
Los crucis chamber the Santa Fe
chamber in order the back and we
had very good and robust
feedback the came back and other
changes Mr chairman that were
made as a result of the feedback
the came back in not all of it
was accepted and you know that's
that's how we put things
together appear so full stop
When you look at hello Hey out
as an example for individual
working you just walk us
through.
You know what what should
employee expect some I'm gonna
get to another question after
this but what what you mean
plate specter he said there up
to minimum wage and then if
they're beyond minimum wage can
you just walk us through what
that would look like sure so Mr
chair and and senator do at it
would be if an employee is
making minimum wage state would
get one hundred percent of that
if they are making
above minimum wage will be a
hundred percent of the state
minimum wage plus sixty seven
percent of their wages about
that right.
Just something else you.
There's yeah we have the numbers
to so for a full time minimum
wage employee there they would
be their annual salary would be
twenty four thousand nine
hundred sixty dollars their
weekly wage would be four
hundred eighty there what
replacement would be four
hundred eighty the state average
wage of fifty one thousand eight
hundred sixty their weekly wage
would be nine hundred ninety
seven and their weekly
replacement would be eight
hundred twenty seven dollars and
then for the Max wage it is that
nine hundred ninety seven
dollars which is the weekly wage
for as an average wage earner in
the state so so Mister chairman
something that Senator would set
early which I thought was really
good was thirteen states have
already gone down this path you
know I looked at the ones that
have gone down they continue to
have booming economies so I
think there's that's important
to note the other thing is that
the other states that the the
research that I was able to read
when I joined this effort was
how it's structured for the the
amount of money the individual
point of getting really is
motivating them to get
themselves well and get back to
work because they could
potentially be on the minimum
wage
payment they they would be not
receiving they wouldn't be whole
as an example so that the
motivation would be for them to
get back to work as soon as they
possibly could assumes they were
feeling better or whoever they
were dealing with was feeling
better or what have you such
like the think it's very
important to to point that out
and also you know want to say
that of the thirteen states I
want to say that the GDP growth
in those states was I think
north of seven percent year over
year for the three the first
three years that they have had
this implement fully implemented
not not in the implement the
design phase the actual
implementation phase so I think
that's also very important to
note
So that this will leave it now
Mr chairman but I just want to
point those two very important
things that I do believe I do do
feel confident that the business
community has a strong large
voice at the table and also I
think that the way the plan is
structured really does re frame
for an employee kind of what
they should really be thinking
about in terms of making
themselves better or whoever
they're caring for whatever to
get themselves back to work
thank you.
Thank you center and we know
your hands up you'll be next
after center share.
Thank you Mr chair.
You know I think the.
My real heartburn here is that
the business especially small
New Mexico businesses not the
walmarts were allowed to stay
open through COVID but those who
were actually owned and operated
by New Mexicans.
Those who survived are still
struggling they feel like
they've just had the snot beat
out of.
Some by disease some by
government.
And they're just struggling.
But these are the same
businesses that do care about
their people.
People work for me for two weeks
and decide they don't like the
job for for twenty plus years is
almost I I don't hire people
often because I don't have to.
It is because the family we want
to present blood relation to me
that's my son everybody else is
family.
Not blood relation.
It troubles me.
What what I think we're doing
here is we're saying.
We're good with those big
businesses what we said during
comment lockdowns we're good
with big businesses we don't
like little New Mexico
businesses we don't want to give
little of New Mexico businesses
any discretion on how they deal
with the people that they work
with.
We just want to give that
discretion because we think for
some of the reason they're too
stupid or too evil to file to
work with the people that they
work with for twenty years.
And I just don't think that's
true.
To be called inhumane because I
want to work with Mike my people
that I work with.
The called in who may.
That's exactly the attitude that
I think is coming from this you
believe that the four of us home
businesses are into may.
The.
Build us.
That's the message that's
delivered it leads to a lot of
small businesses including me.
There's a burden that happens to
everybody.
When somebody doesn't come to
work.
For most small businesses.
We understand people get sick
people have babies we try to
work around that but they're
still important to that business
when somebody to shopping one
day.
Such a burden to the customers
in the case of the state this
important everybody in the state
because well eight we can't hire
enough people to begin with this
is not of people out there
higher.
In the state budget are probably
a lot better than most private
budget list working for some
monster company.
Wells Fargo's got pretty good
benefits.
We can't hire enough people to
do that now.
In that burden.
If we incentivize the burden and
I believe that's what we're
looking at is if we incentivize
that burden it's harder.
If I have discretion with
somebody.
Then we can we can work out how
to how to deal with things.
But under this there's no
discretion it's just you know
that's that's that's what we're
gonna do.
And I think that burden gets
passed around in in that burden
is not what we see in anything
that burden is is small in the
big picture of the state.
But it's tremendous in the
little picture of that business
tremendous in that little
picture of a restaurant that has
fifteen employees.
Specially if we incentivize
somebody not come back.
Because we're paying them not to
come back.
We only have fifty five percent
of workforce participation in
the state today that's total
then women boards go fat little
what that matter fifty five
percent.
And I believe that fifty five
percent is because we have
incentivized people not come to
work.
You have to.
Lots of people today.
Are making more money by not
working then by working.
At least to make enough with
other benefits maybe it's not
cash but it's not budget it's
rental assistance it's whatever
we've done in all of those were
we're we're.
Good intentions of what it would
anything that we did that was
evil at least not in in.
In you know the reason for it
was all with good intentions.
But now we have.
Very few people paying the bills
for everybody else and it's
going to get worse if this
happens.
And yet I think that all of us
want to be compassionate.
We want to be compassionate we
don't have our hands tied on how
compassion has to be.
I really this just.
It's just bugging me to even
think about this.
And so when we talk about some
of the stuff.
A hundred percent of employees
are going to pay and choose six
percent are going to take
advantage of it so that's ninety
four percent of the people get
nothing for their money.
That seems like a tax increase
on everybody.
Focused in one year.
Everybody in.
We talk about healthy
communities.
What I fear.
And I've heard from his you
know.
All all the people claiming
their speaking for business
here.
But the small businesses that
are contacting me.
Don't like this they don't want
their freight of it the
restaurants are here asking for
a tax break right now to help
them recover.
From COVID.
So what we're gonna do this okay
will you give this tax but when
raise this tax over here you
may.
Again I don't think it's
intentional the this this is
harm I believe this is
unintentional consequences that
are going to happen the
unintended consequences it is
driving.
Wage.
Between the people it higher in
those that are higher the people
to create jobs in those to fill
those jobs that are newly
created.
It's the unintended consequence
of this.
Especially on the small
businesses.
Walmart Wells Fargo.
I don't care if they're in New
Mexico at all.
I do care about the the
thousands of small New Mexico
restaurants I do care about the
thousands of small businesses in
New Mexico that are trying to do
anything.
That are owned and operated by
New Mexicans.
The New Mexicans are the people
that work there.
All of these unintended
consequences just just scare me.
I'd let me bring this back up
here my thing with sleep so we
started getting inundated with
all these people of the want to
support.
Welcome I'm writing to you to
share my support for SB eleven
the paid family medical and
medical leave act New Mexico's
workers and families to serve
this bill to be top priority I
urge you to pass just be.
One of the eleven this is the
exact well almost the exact same
thing same message in Spanish.
But the most interesting part of
it this is then in parentheses
use this space to personalize
your email.
That tells one person thought of
it.
In for all I know one person
Vigil to no thousand times.
But certainly it wasn't a
thousand people that fought of
this what I get from individual
Businesses now I can't find what
I was going to reach to you but
they're very specific about
their business and their
relationship with the people
they work with.
I'm not getting important
letters from them I'm getting
real heart wrenching letters
from them.
I'm gonna form letter this says
use this space to personalize.
That tells me something's
different out there to.
Two different level of concern.
One is generic pushed out there.
The other one heartfelt and real
these are people people that are
emailing us.
Real people.
Restaurant.
If this passes this is the
proverbial nail in the coffin of
my business.
For.
It in those things bother me we
have this whole panel of
advocates here.
In yet I thought we were going
to have a presentation.
On both sides so is in the
presentation so all the people
back there you know they got a
total of ten minutes.
The advocates got a total of an
hour and ten minutes.
We don't really know what all
those people think we give me a
minute to say we oppose it.
That's what they all did by
Representative.
Flower shops I propose move on.
I do think there's a lot of
things that need to be
considered here.
I do think that that most small
businesses.
Care they have a hard.
They don't battered into doing
something.
In fact I think a good idea
would be to allow them to opt
in.
Here's a system.
You can often.
Instead of battering the into of
the into it.
Instead of you know we talk
about death by a thousand cuts
in over the last few years.
We've taken a lot of hits small
businesses wanting hits.
Comment was a big one.
But the government with just
little rules and little wall
little all with good intentions
all.
Destroying small businesses
businesses except I can't I
can't handle it anymore business
owners is just.
I'm out I can't do it.
And then the twelve for fifteen
or twenty people work formula
certainly out to.
unemployed.
These unintended consequences.
We said that was the we wouldn't
be fraud would be no fraud.
Workforce solutions you may
remember had millions I think it
was two hundred and fifty
million I'm trying to write it
two hundred and fifty million
dollars worth of fraudulent
claims.
That we as taxpayers of New
Mexico paid for.
We think we can prevent fraud in
this.
These things are just they're
tearing me up.
Because I don't think that this
is the way to deal with small
business.
You want to beat up Walmart go
ahead.
You want to beat up New Mexicans
just please stop.
Please stop.
Change the limit to this to five
hundred employees are thousand
employees.
Stop with the small New Mexico
businesses.
With that being punished by
this.
If it's a great idea set up the
program in a let me of a lot opt
in instead of bashing me to all.
Thank you.
Senator Hemphill.
Thank you Mr chairman can you
hear me we got you.
Excellent I just wanted to thank
the senator for bringing this
forward especially as a mom
who's had four babies including
a son who who's now twenty seven
who was born with a very rare
genetic disability and has had
many health challenges over his
twenty seven years I know how
difficult it is to as a mom to
juggle a career and a family and
often I hear the media in
legislators talking a lot about
the labor shortage but what we
really should be talking about
is a hazard pay shortage a child
care shortage he'd family
medical leave shortage I had to
take family medical leave and it
was on paid to care for my son
who had had his left leg
amputated and is only eight has
right laid was broken while I
was breastfeeding a newborn and
I have to I was forced to take
unpaid leave and not only that
but this legislation will
protect women in the workplace
what study shows that men die
earlier than women and are more
burden by illness during their
lives they fall ill.
Much more often and for it more
frequently than women and they
have more chronic illnesses than
women COVID typically had hits
men harder than it does women
according to our more recent
study just published in may and
I really see this as being very
advantageous for women and
reducing the stress that many
New Mexican municipalities
across New Mexico have to and
your so thank you again Mr
chairman and thank you Senator
Stewart thank you Senator
Rodriguez for second time.
No I do not know I I said what I
have to say or more still the
same Senator Padilla moved to
pass
the motion.
Let me ask some questions before
we start.
You know I am also business
right we have twenty six
employee right we offer our
employees required by law.
Health care.
We offer employee sep retirement
which is fifteen percent of
their payroll that we match rate
higher than any other right we
offer reports now by the
mandated by state we paid leave
right.
that we offer.
at thirty minutes and the rules
not really.
Have the secretary once you
start moving up into the
settlement fund to question
three.
And so we we can do so much for
employees I have employee got
pregnant as a kid their time off
pay for daycare paid for to get
more education collagen things
change your life and she moved
on.
I think there is some need for
this expressly for you know it's
hard for poor people person
working in the Donald's by
making fifteen dollars an hour
and and if I was there today and
I had to leave to go take care
of my mom you know four to five
times a day try for you that you
cannot afford health care for
don't they care for your parents
it's a struggle in life right
now.
In in so being in business we
can only offer so much we can
only do so much when we bid
contracts to say these are
overhead costs and we have
margins that we have to abide
within we account taxes we gonna
tell.
Comment that happened the loan
you took out for comment.
They're still trying to pay off
some of these businesses I don't
think NMFA's receive very few
payments haven't checked with
them on businesses that took out
loans during the COVID to get
through that they got the
federal loans may still those on
top of that.
And payroll is still there every
single week when we have to
write every two weeks thirty
thousand dollars with the
payroll for our employees rate
for every two weeks sixty
thousand dollars a month.
it's a struggle and we as
business owners given the
business to make our lives
better but then we have
employees who count on us every
single day to open that business
to operate it to make sure that
they're making money to make
sure that they have families are
well fed and well taken care of
and that's what we have a
responsibility to do as a
business owner and you become
friends and have built
relationships with them
sometimes employees work out
sometimes employees don't work
out
but you do that and you make a
determination your life what you
want if you want to be a teacher
than to go be a teacher if you
want to go on business and be in
business for yourself and you
can do that.
But it's such a hard time right
now.
And I'm not talking for.
Of a young man.
Anybody in this room wants to go
open of business today and if
they look at the costs just of
opening a business to get
through the regulations to
understand that they're going to
be have all these process is
done.
Don't give up and you don't have
those entrepreneurs anymore and
the how do we make it to the
first business to grow and
younger sister grow the harder
it is
Me ask some questions on the
funds.
let me ask questions what
happens I have janitors and
choose to work for me she passed
away but she has a disability.
Right.
And what happens to her if she
just take medical leave and
she's already on disability and
campaigner she's working on her
own show receive disability can
she receive that twice.
You run workforce solution you
know the answer to that.
That would be a claim that we
need to raise.
you Mr chairman members of the
committee we do not administered
disability insurance so I am not
aware that answers I.
I don't think they'll make a
claim for under disability under
a workers comp.
Mr chair that's the workers comp
administration we don't
administration.
I want to get them for the floor
right.
I think one of the things we
talked about earlier about
discrimination employees like
that and politically I had rate
with a disability employers
won't look to them anymore and
some of those people with
disabilities you want to work.
But they're gonna look at it and
say at some point you may use
this and and I can't afford that
she was a janitor for me have
federal security clearance right
to claim the FBI building.
Great employee but employers
will look at that and say that's
going to cost you more money to
make sure I make the right.
For.
They talked about the dual
benefit so can you receive an
unemployment and I pay New
Mexico mutual casualty my
workers comp I have an employee
that.
It's read over gets hit by a car
and he makes a workers comp
claim and then comes back and
makes a family medical leave
claim you know we went to the
art because somebody some rack
happen and so can they make that
double clean at the same time.
Well they can't get unemployment
and beyond the paid family
medical leave.
They're not employed from
workers comp so that's why pay
New Mexico mutual for for
workers comp so that sets the
right for their pay their
workers comp but if if he's
injured so bad rex's late right
you have to have surgery.
Can he get workers comp and paid
medical leave at the same time.
I don't think so not workers
comp this for people that are
injured at work and it pays for
that there's medical payments
that they do and everything else
that is different that's not
this but the broken leg eight in
the health care issues.
And so we can make bold claims
the same time.
I don't believe so Mr chair.
We need to ask answer that will
benefit.
In Senator you remark she said
sustainably people to a
comparable to right I forget the
exact word.
Yeah we replace equal to two.
Substantially similar in your
comment you said equal to main
me eight or nine weeks of paid
off for two weeks.
Know what I said was that.
Companies that were like human
and they offer full time pay but
I think only four weeks so.
If they wanted to opt out I
think the link which we put in
would allow them to do that but
again it'll be done through
rules through workforce
solutions but there's a lot more
chance for them to be able to
opt out if we put substantially
similar.
You know the problem with
rulemaking is off on the pay
lead on the paid leave that we
have to do now the rules aren't
even really written correctly.
We're all guessing is employers
votes thirty minutes for every
thirty five hours account number
the exact half hour for every
thirty hours for every thirty
hours and then can we pay it out
can we not paid out there the
rules are clarified in any
business guy that writes a check
every month is like we don't
know for sure if this is right
the rules are really clearing
house acted so I mean these
rules gonna have to be very
clear.
And when we start to roll that's
where with these get.
Are you going to use any of that
money.
The sixty three million thirty
six thirty six million.
If someone files a lawsuit.
And says against rulemaking and
says it violates law school
record where you can get the
money for the the lawsuit if
that.
Mr chair we have in house
attorney is and we're also would
probably tender claim to the
risk management pool.
So I think we would have a
variety of options for defending
that sees.
And you have any idea what that
may cost with that those that
claim if there's been a claim
against workforce solutions are
or suit filed over.
In do you know what any of those
those cost.
Mr Chairman familiar with the
suit against the department for
to challenge the rule making
authority
yeah.
Let me and the masses question
so any employer that withholds
right if you know the system.
There's a tap system we report
or stuff we go in there reporter
police play a role in do it it's
all a tronic right.
Why does not system not going to
work for you.
Because well let me ask another
price question when I report the
withholding and my then placed
portion that's going to be
entered into one system.
If you tell employers you can
enter into a new system right
and then you say what we want to
balance to the perils of Levin
and forty seven dollars or
whatever and you want to balance
to that through another system
that's probably not gonna work
so are you going to use the tap
system or why aren't you can use
taxes I'm sorry for my.
Mr chair members of the
committee so as the that there
are states that have their
taxation revenue department
Collett the contributions but
that's not the way that this is
designed so the system that
could potentially link to this
would be the unemployment
insurance system we have spoken
to a number of other states we
have some ideas about how to
link those systems so that are
there is at a minimum a single
sign on and single account but I
believe the idea that behind the
changing the definition of wages
that occurred is that it it
should be one set of wages that
with the same wage calculation
to form the basis of your
unemployment insurance payments
and and your other payments so
that we're not asking employers
to calculate wages in two
different ways so there should
be some economies that way.
And and have you talked to that
whoever the tax system is if
they can program that system
come looking at sixty three
million dollars a thirty six
percent.
Somewhere I get sixty three
second this.
Dyslexia all.
Have you talked to the company
as a tax system and why you
can't operate in the same.
So.
Mr chair we either without
wanting to cause any issues with
the potential procurement that
happened that point that will
happen in the future to procure
this into information system we
have is we have spoken to both
the number of states and a
number of vendors and there will
be some efficiency that comes
from
from combining or building off
of existing systems but it will
make it free it won't make it no
cost and I I would also add that
some of the money that is
allocated for the start up is
also per person.
I get the person portion but as
an employer right if I can
report this stuff I need the
easiest way to report all
medical.
And may unemployment everything
like that sue the everything
that's all then to the tap I I
just don't understand why you
can't use that system to report
it will show the withholding
separately and move it over to
transfer dollars but that's and
so the other thing is you see
these calculations for this I.
What are you gonna do if the
funding comes in San you have
the authority to just range to
solve this.
We what what scenario would like
that look like if you had it
just a range of for solvency and
we.
We've done this it happened just
before in workers comp they had
committed to increase it two and
a half times what was almost
killed some employees with two
hundred employees what rate
increases are you to look at it
of the funding comes in so.
Mr chair I believe this statute
is is pretty prescriptive on the
approach to how we would have to
adjust for any potential
insolvency so we would make the
calculation of the hundred
thirty five percent of the total
of those those three elements
the annual payout the
administrative costs and the
reimbursement to the general
fund in the for six years and
then we look at the targeted
contribution or estimated
contribution amount for the year
to follow we look at the
difference and and then I I
don't believe there's a lot of
leeway in the idea that we would
raise the rate just to make up
that shortfall which isn't sort
of a mathematical equation my
understanding of the statute is
also that that any increase in
the rate would have to be born
in the same ratio is the current
premium so forty five percent by
the employer fifty five percent
by the employee and
you know looking at the FIR from
the
legislative finance council
there's there are two scenarios
in medium and low in the medium
scenario.
There would require a an
increase of the premium in the
low the fund would be so flush
that in fact we could
contemplate a premium decrease
so I think there's just a lot of
range for what might happen
based on the number of claims
and when you guys met in why is
that are not a reduction in
benefit to complete solvency.
Mr chair that's a a question for
the sponsored insurance continue
that conversation never come up
the fund installment in the
that's where FOR Sliq depending
on the mid nineties how can we
get look at reducing the the the
benefit to the employee before
we raise costs to get a handle.
We will based on what happens in
all the other states only one
state has had to raise rates and
not once Washington to the
states have already lowered
rates well we anticipate that we
could just as easily lower rates
so
we think we've developed a
system that will work for us
where we won't need to increase
rates.
Thank.
Let me ask you madam secretary
the governor did this by
executive order in the state
agency what is the cost current
costs to the state and how many
employees.
That Mr chair
I don't have that information.
Colleges and happy to look
better in the future.
Question I want to try to get an
answer to because the governor
data by executive order which I
don't think she could have done
because she
Connectivity a cost for the
legislature can approve it and
so there may be something there
but I want to know what the
state number is.
That would give me a good idea
of what what the uses and then
you know the state employees
they also have an additional
thirty minutes per week for for
Jan then sighed Kings in total
budget and so I I have one know
that number somebody in the room
could find that out
One of the other things you
mentioned was contract employees
right.
And how are those handle explain
that to me again.
It's that they're self employed
they of go directly they can
often they go directly to the
workforce solutions with the
their wages and they determine
right and they pay in and then
there part of program.
But most most most depending on
the company's of the contract
you may have single contract
providers right center.
During the phase one
environmental study for an
independent contractor I don't
do W. two withholding he's also
a one man a may have three
employees in this system but
he's under contract so he'll
have he can because under the
number he's he doesn't have to
report it.
Public contract employees I
think you got a little different
scenario there right we're
considering them up at I hope
trace is gonna stop me if I'm
getting this wrong but we're
considering them self employed
and they can opt into the
program.
And so yes contract employees
and in this because I'm writing
a piece of legislation for for.
For a
temporary employees right
if I contract in my employees to
attend Agency.
And those employees are are
operated and payrolls ran
through that agency in another
state.
The employees here temporarily
six months or nine months how is
that going to be and when those
those contracted the laser to
the minutes.
Not quite sure about your
question Mr Chairman but you
know.
Know that this is the contract
employee self employed I mean
there's self employed so they
can often are or not.
No you Center Padilla for
example yes call center.
The short two hundred employees
any calls
the temp agency and says I need
forty eight temporary employees
this is my wages and this I'm
doing
how does he handle that.
Temporary situation forty deuce
contract for less than six
months at a time.
Yes that's what I was going to
say it's the temp agency that
employs these people not Senator
Padilla.
Okay.
You know it.
The my big issue is the unfunded
liability.
In the no in this entire
scenario right.
And we look around and say okay
if we really want to do this I
wonder correctly.
We should make sure the funds
home solve it started and then
move forward as we go forward
assessing.
We're going to get that shot in
the dark and we're gonna guess
what's going to happen and
something happens in the future
that we're short of funds and
so.
we don't feel like we're
guessing for not taking a shot
in the dark we have these other
states that have done it for
some of them for many many years
we're using the best research
for using the best programs and
we with that deeper and other
economists but we have plenty of
businesses who want to do this
that they've reached out to us
but we think we're not guessing
now we're taking our time we can
adjust this through the years if
we need to but we're not we're
not looking at any kind of
insolvency we're looking at
possibly lowering the amounts in
the future once we pay back the
money we're borrowing from the
state to get it started so it's
you know if you if you calculate
the way these other states have
which is what we've tried to do.
We have a good fund that we're
looking at and the ability to
lower rates as we go forward.
The other states in and I love
those this morning thirteen
other states their benefits are
not as rich as this one.
Everyone of those states offers
at least twelve weeks many of
them offer more up California
offers eight weeks family fifty
two weeks for
temporary disability insurance
we don't have that many of these
other states already have that
New Jersey twelve weeks for
family twenty six weeks for
temporary disability insurance
Massachusetts twenty six weeks
total twelve weeks family twenty
weeks medical Washington six
weeks total combination of no
more than sixteen using up to
twelve weeks for family up to
twelve weeks for medical Rhode
Island thirty weeks total
combination of no more than
thirty using up to six weeks for
family was four weeks they just
increase it to six weeks to
twenty three thirty weeks for
medical Connecticut twelve weeks
total a combination of no more
than twelve using up to twelve
weeks or family twelve weeks for
medical twelve weeks for safely.
They're all over the place but
they're they're better than we
are they offer more than we are
they have a low up workforce
amount of with approved claim of
their average weekly budget
looks like they range from five
hundred and sixty two two seven
hundred ninety three their
average length of time is six
point seven for Connecticut
three point seven for Rhode
Island forty five days paid
family medical for New Jersey.
They're all working well and we
are designing our program to
follow the best practices that
they've already established.
Okay have you guys looked at the
constitutionality of charging
the benefits that they don't
receive
in their automatically in their
first rate to the action.
I don't think you can charge
somebody a budget if they're not
eligible to receive it
immediately.
I'm just asking the question if
you your lawyer represented by
another lawyer.
Mr chair up we do that with
unemployment insurance.
Opting from among other things
but we're deducting from your
paycheck you're obviously not
immediately eligible for it.
there immediately eligible if if
that if they get injured workers
comp in there on your payroll
once in your system their means
of health that's not true you
gotta work a certain number
quarters before you get a dime
from unemployment.
One and I'm talking about
workers comp in this one but
it's there and it's you want to
qualify for the time it's there
well we're gonna start this up
and they're not gonna have a
short time period part time
period once it's enacted but the
deduction begins you know after
the bills and act.
Mr chairman the business
community one of those employees
to work for them for ninety days
before they would keep their job
we did that for the.
Now you.
You have to pay and for six
months before you can do a claim
we're having a whole year for
people pay and and it starts the
next year it's very similar to
other programs that we use that
it's not an issue of
constitutionality.
Okay.
I guess my question.
Have a motion you're on a
motion.
The motion for to pass and we
have a sense to move to table.
And the second on any of those
the second second senator Byrd.
We call.

We checked is audio.
Can we call them on the phone
and putting more.
This call we can quickly columns
separately zoom zoom zoom zoom
zoom.
But it's going to respond.
Point something.
Using committee here he's come
in committee zoom zoom the role
this because a COVID to
participate by zoom have.
Yes yes.
And so he's he's in the
committee in these on as soon
and so that's real that he's
allowed to vote.
Having some technical
difficulties so.
I just called separately from my
phone in the office and somebody
try it he's using his phone.
The.
Without that on there.
Welcome to the world of
technology.
Okay areas.
Senator
goodness I'm in a minute the
vote no on the on the economic
which applies here what's.
Go ahead.
Well.
Thank you please stay alive
State keep them on the line.
I don't I don't know if you can
can it can be here you need to
us if you can hear the motions
it at okay but is it he was on
his phone on June now he's on
the phone on the line so can you
need to ask him if you can hear
what we're discussing so he
knows what we're voting on
correctly.
The motion failed sixty four
amendment would do pass Mr
chairman.
We're going to have to pass
right in motion for two passed
by okay Senator Rodriguez second
by Senator Steinborn we've
called.
Wanted to pass motion Senator
Burt.

Yes.
Thank you Senator Hemphill.
Yes.
Senator Padilla yes.
Senator share no.
Senator Steinborn.

way shape or form Armstrong they
use the wrong study it used to
and efforts that.
Thank you thank you thank you
everyone.
It is yes thank you Mr.
Thank you Mr chairman.
