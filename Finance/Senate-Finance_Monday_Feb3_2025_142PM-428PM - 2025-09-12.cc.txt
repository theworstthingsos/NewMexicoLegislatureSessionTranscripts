that we can be. Uh, my name is
John Senna.
And your staff director for the
legislative education Study
Committee.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. My name is
Sonny Liu.
public schools analyst for LMC.
We're gonna get started this
afternoon.
You should have a
Document that looks sort of like
this, that one looks.
There, the vision of the SCG.
We talk a little bit about some
background, um.
Our committee
proposal for the legislature
this year to advise the way that
the state calculates the public.
funding for distributes money to
students.
So I'm gonna talk a little bit
about the background about how
got to that proposal.
And then I'll talk a little bit
about the
of itself.
So
Um
2
You'll see a background that
talks about how this all started
in 2023.
With House Memorial 51.
Asking
ESC to complete a comprehensive
review of the.
guarantee, which is the state's
funding formula.
Asked to identify establishing
challenges, strengths and
opportunities related to that
SCG.
Identify what constitutes
adequacy.
And build consensus on whether
the SCG is responsive to the
current and evolving needs of
all students.
On page 3, you'll see an
overview of the working group
members. So this was a
collaborative effort across
multiple agencies as well as uh
stakeholders from the education
field.
With LESC, LFC.
Secretary, uh at the time,
Arsenio Romero and our current
secretary designate Padilla from
the Public Education department.
Obviously, Sonny from LFC as
well as members, representatives
from the Superintendents
Association, the Mexico School
Boards Association, the public
charter schools of New Mexico,
as well as representatives of a
particular charter school.
Representatives from the New
Mexico school business
officials, so these are folks
who actually run the budgets in
your school districts.
Um, our labor, labor unions, um,
And some other external um
stakeholders.
Very quickly, Mr. Chair, and
we're, we're gonna provide you
all with a, uh, this, this
little graphic that you see on
the right hand side of that
slide, we're going to provide
you with a full size version of
that. It's gonna show you, you
know, walk you through a little
bit how the funding formula
actually works, very high level,
not too in depth today, but just
so folks have some context for
the larger conversation.
Um, the SCG, the public school
funding formula in New Mexico in
its current form or mostly
current form was created in
1974.
Since then it's been modified 80
times with changes to factors in
the way that we fund schools.
Most recently, we created the
K12 plus program units that was
done in 2023.
And for FY 25 legislature
appropriated $4.17 billion to
the state equalization
guarantee. And again, this is
all money that flows directly to
school districts.
PED services is essentially the
fiscal agent and flow through,
but this money flows directly to
school districts.
On page
5
I'm not gonna talk too much
about Martinez Yazi because we
have a whole other presentation
devoted directly to it, but
there's a slide there giving you
a little bit of context for that
lawsuit, and some of that has to
do with
How we ended up with some of the
proposals for the funding
formula changes.
On slide 6.
Some of you might remember that
in 2008, the legislature
actually uh
commissioned a study.
Of the school funding formula
conducted by the American
Institutes of Research.
At that time, researchers
essentially asked the field to
determine what does it cost to
run schools, and what would the
state need to do to fully fund
that?
So at that time in FYO8.
The study determined the cost of
2.635 billion.
Which at the time would have
meant $334.7 million more, or
about 14.5% that was being
funded uh at that time.
On the next slide.
You'll see, um, some background
on the 2011 joint LESC and LFC
evaluation about the SCG at
which time um those committees
actually made some
recommendations, revising the
at-risk index with a cost
differential of 0.15 with the
percentage of students
identified as eligible for for
the free and reduced lunch.
Lunch program.
Modifying the bilingual
component with a cost
differential of 0.15 for English
learners.
And removing the mobility
component from the SCG. And for
those of you not too familiar
with some of these, I'm gonna
talk a little bit more about
what those mean, but for now I'm
just gonna kind of go through
this piece quickly.
So while these recommendations
were not comprehensively
implemented by the legislature,
they are the foundation of the
EEC's current proposal on slide
8.
Um, I will, I won't read through
all of these, but you'll see
legislative actions since that
study that included additional
funding as well as changes to
the formula in various factors
within the formula, for
instance, how we um calculate
how much schools get based on
teacher experience. That's
something that was changed not
too long ago. And then on slide
9.
I'm gonna slow down a little bit
here, um, so that we can walk
through a little bit about how
the funding formula actually
works.
Um
And talk about the components
that the pro the proposed
revision would would make.
So
The basic program for schools,
how we, how we fund every school
district in the state is based
primarily on the number of
students and the characteristics
of those students.
And so the basic characteristic
of that student of a student is
what grade are they in?
And you'll see on the right hand
side of of this slide.
The factors
That we use to determine
essentially what every student
in every grade generates in the
formula.
So we don't fund based on
students we fund based on units.
And so for a first grader, for
instance, you'll see that the
SEG weight is 1.200. That means
for every first grader, they're
generating 1.2 units of funding.
Those factors change along the
way.
They take into account in early
childhood the cost of serving
those early childhood students
and in the, in the case of
A 12 early childhood essentially
means kindergarten.
And so we have class size
requirements that um
At a certain point, if you reach
15 or more students in a
kindergarten class, you need to
have an educational assistant in
that class. And because of that,
kindergarteners are more
expensive to serve.
So the factor takes that into
account in kindergarteners
actually represent 1 point or 4
units per student.
You'll see that those factors
decrease as students get older
until 4th through 6th grade, and
then increase again through 7
through 12. And again, that
accounts for the number of
teachers that are required. It
accounts for the kind of
program, programming uh that
exists in secondary, um, I do
want to say that basic program,
this large chunk of units was
last revised in 1993.
With the secondary components of
7 through 12 last revised in
1976, so not long after the
formula was first created.
On the next slide.
This is a uh
A slide that sort of describes
what we see across grades in
performance.
That light blue line on the top
is uh ELA reading and writing,
the red line is math.
And what you're seeing here is
the trend across grades.
So you'll see that starting in
3rd grade, you have percentages
in reading of about 32% in math
of about 24% proficiency.
And you'll see that those
Uh, those climb.
To some extent in reading to
about 42% and stay flat across
most grades.
But you'll see that
Proficiency increases pretty
steadily through 5th and 6th
grade, and then starts a pretty
steep drop off.
And what clearly what we're
seeing here is that
Even though students are
learning, once they get to
middle school.
There are various factors that
are contributing to them, not
performing as well. One chart we
don't have on this is sort of
the inverse of this, which is
chronic absenteeism.
Chronic absenteeism, which is
defined as students missing 10%
or more of the school year.
is actually higher than we would
like to see in early childhood
grades.
It gets better as students get
older through 5th and 6th grade,
and then starts to tick up again
in middle and high school. So
sort of the inverse of of the
charts that you're seeing in
front of you.
Uh, on the next slide.
Slide 11.
This is data from a national
survey.
That talks about um this is from
the Walton Family Foundation in
in Gallup that surveyed students
about how they felt about
school.
And you'll see here obviously
that um
I think the uh
The most interesting thing here
is that my schoolwork challenges
me in a good way, 50%.
But most of these, this data
gets at is the level of
disengagement.
at the secondary level.
I'm gonna switch gears a little
bit on the next page.
To at-risk funding.
So we've been talking about
basic program cost.
And a proposal to increase
funding for secondary students.
I'm gonna switch.
He's here to at-risk funding,
which for us is essentially a
proxy.
Um, that we use a proxy for, for
poverty.
So in the at-risk factor
currently, there are 3
calculations, the percentage of
membership used to calculate
Title One, so this is a federal
designation that is a proxy for
poverty.
The percentage of membership
classified as English learners.
So every district in the state
for the most part, has some
English learners, and the
percentage of those English
learners are part of this
at-risk calculation.
And then finally student
mobility.
And that's essentially students
moving in and out of schools
because research has shown that
mobility negatively impacts
student performance.
So the sum of those components
is multiplied by 0.33, which is
your current at-risk factor.
And then multiply times the
membership of, of your school
district.
For FY 25, the at-risk index is
anticipated to generate
approximately 57,971 program
units or $379.9 million. Based
on that unit value of 6,553.
175 cents.
Next slide.
So Mr. Chair, now I'm gonna walk
you through uh the actual
proposal from the LESC.
Uh, and its staff.
So this is already represented
in House Bill 63, which you may
hear later in the session, but
I'll give you an overview of
what that bill proposes to do
here.
So it proposes to increase the
factor.
For both 6th grade and grade 7
through 12.
So currently, as you saw
earlier, that was 1.045 for
sixth grade and 1.25.
Or 7 through 12, this would
raise both of those factors to
1.30.
And the and the simple way to
say that is high school students
would generate more units in the
in the formula.
And, and if you appropriate um
Commiserate
Funding school districts would
generate more funding through
that through that mechanism.
This funding would go, could be
used to support career and
technical education programs,
secondary fun and performing
arts programs, and then the
broader academic, social, and
emotional supports for all
secondary students that we
continue to hear from school
districts are needed.
HP 63 also proposes a revision
of the at-risk index.
So rather than having the those
three components be part of that
index. HB 63 would actually
repeal a couple of those
components.
And then replace them with the
family income index mechanism as
a way to identify poverty at the
local school district level.
While also creating a standalone
factor.
Or English learners, as well as
for students who exit English
learners for 2 years after they
exit.
This would eliminate the
mobility component.
It would actually uh establish a
new factor of 0.40 for the
at-risk and 0.33 for English
learners.
The entire bill.
Secondary increases.
Change in the way we calculate
at risk and creating an English
learner factor, uh, we estimate
would, would cost about $132.7
million to the SCG.
Take a quick drink of water, Mr.
Chair.
On the next few slides, I'm
gonna talk a little bit about
How this would actually impact
your schools and school
districts.
So for basic program, as long as
the school district or charter
school serves students in grade
67 through 12.
All would receive additional
funding because we're increasing
the factor for this, and school
districts will receive an
additional $79.8 million for
basic program.
For the at-risk component of
switching over to a more
accurate mechanism of
identifying poverty, as well as
creating those English learner
factors.
Uh, that would, that would
generate about $42.1 million.
And so that's a total of 121.
8 for school districts. The next
slide, you'll see similar
information for charter schools.
With the net, the net total
being $10.9 million additional
for charter schools.
I will say one thing that the
change to the at risk that I
didn't get into a lot of detail
here does.
Currently charter schools
receive.
The at-risk factor of the of the
school district in which they
are geographically located.
So, for instance, in Las Cruces
or Albuquerque.
Every charter school in those
communities receives the same
at-risk index of the larger
district, the Las Cruces Public
Schools or Albuquerque Public
Schools.
We have schooled charter schools
in those districts that serve
Populations that are not
reflective of the overall school
district population. So in the
case of a charter school that
serves
Students, more students who
qualify as economically
disadvantaged. This would mean
that they would receive
additional funding, because they
now would have their own at-risk
index.
On the last slide, very quickly,
uh, HP 63 also includes a hold
harmless.
There are a handful of school
districts.
And more charter schools.
That would see decreased units
because of these changes. It
would be generating fewer units
because their populations maybe
are different than their uh.
Larger district at-risk
populations and because of the
change in some of the mechanisms
that we use to identify.
these factors. And so because of
that, the bill also includes a
one year hold harmless.
of about $4.2 million to give
school districts a chance to, to
prepare for those changes. Um,
all of this is fluid.
Uh, they're at risk this year
doesn't mean it will be there at
risk next year because it all
depends on the students they
serve.
So those schools uh we'll see
some changes over the next few
years regardless, but this would
hold them harmless for at least
one year.
And with that, Mr. Chair, um,
I think I'm gonna stop talking.
Sonny's gonna take over for a
little while.
Thank you, John. Uh, Mr.
Chairman of the committee, I'm
gonna turn your attention to
this second set of presentation
slides, uh, that says update on
Martinez Yazi lawsuit and
outcomes.
And I believe your staff is
handing it out at this time.
to just give us a minute to
There's two of them, which one
are you going?
OK
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh,
Martine Yai lawsuit has had a
big influence on the changes
that John has been discussing in
his presentation.
Just to give you a sense of.
The context and the historical
information surrounding this,
um, starting on slide 2, we've
given you the provision.
In the Constitution that this
whole case is based on, which is
that are uniform and sufficient
public education system is
required.
In 2019, the first judicial
district stated that the state
had failed to meet this
constitutional mandate.
But
And ordered the state to give
at-risk students, which it
defined as
Native American English learner,
low income and students with
disabilities, uh, the
opportunity to obtain an
education that prepared them for
college and career.
The court did not specify
specific remedies only that the
legislature and the executive
branch should be given deference
to come up with these remedies,
uh, but it did point to certain
inputs and outputs that were
deficient and if you turn with
me to page 3.
The court heard testimony from
expert witnesses that funding
and programming were inadequate.
student outcomes were dismal as
you saw John present earlier and
that
Therefore funding for the system
and oversight from the public
education department were
insufficient.
There's been um attempts to
Appeal the ruling.
That was overturned by the court
in 2020. There was a new order
at the time to provide
technology for students, given
that there were school closures
during the pandemic.
And recently in 2024, the
plaintiffs
filed a new motion, um, asking
for a remedial plan, the
department has not opposed the
idea of a plan that is asked
that they take on the role as
opposed or that.
A different entity other than
LEC lead the development of that
turning the page 4.
These are the high level.
Inputs that the court found to
be deficient in 2018, including
things that the legislature has
invested heavily in since that
time.
Notably, pre-K, extended
learning time.
Um
Improved
Educating it sorry.
Improved funding for educators,
essentially improving the
quality of instruction, massive
increases to the Indian
Education Act and expansion of
college and technical education.
Sorry, career and technical
education initiatives.
Turning this slide 5. The
plaintiffs did request as part
of its injunctive relief, a
statewide plan and timetable.
For implementation.
And over on the right side, you
can see the at-risk student
groups that were highlighted,
um.
For the Martinez and Yazi
lawsuit.
On slide 6 in 2018, shortly
after the court ruling.
Plaintiff's counsel for Yazi
proposed several remedies for
the legislature to consider.
Um, as part of that process, it
was really important to
understand, you know, what is
the responsibility of the
legislature as the financiers of
the system.
What role does PED have to play
in oversight and
Monitoring and then ultimately,
how do you deliver the
improvements in the classroom.
That would be the responsibility
of schools, and that
Ended up becoming a joint LFC
LESC bill in the 2000.
19 session where.
There were massive reforms to
the funding formula and
increases in funding for public
schools.
On pages 7 through
12.
Here are a few of the court
findings, not an exhaustive
list, but some of the larger,
broader issues that the court
found.
And we've also broken it into
those three categories. What is
the legislature done? What is
the executive done and what are
some of the local outcomes we've
seen since the court ruling.
I'll just highlight a few of
these you can peruse through
them.
But number one,
Overall funding level was
insufficient to you as a
legislature have increased
funding recurring for public
schools by $1.6 billion since
the ruling, that's a 58% budget
increase.
And we've also seen
From the executive proposals to
tap into the land grant
permanent fund to support some
of that investment in schools.
We also have seen an increase in
operational cash reserves at
local districts and the
legislatures.
Proposals to expand the school
year, um, we're not fully um
accepted at the local level,
hence having some versions in
the K5+ and extended learning
time programs.
I'll move down to the 2nd 1,
simply because it's relevant to
the proposals before you today.
Uh, the court didn't actually
have a lot of specific
Remedies, but it did agree with
testimony that at-risk students
should be generating 25% to 50%
more funding than their peers.
At the time of the ruling, the
at-risk index was at 0.106,
which gives students at-risk
students in the formula about
8.7% more funding than
They're basic membership peers.
At this point, a 0.33 at risk
index gets you to about 22%
above.
And my understanding from the
proposal from House Bill 63 is
it gets us pretty close to 24,
25%.
You will note that despite these
investments on the right side,
we still have pretty large
achievement gaps between at-risk
students and their peers in math
and reading.
The second one I want to turn
your attention to.
Is on page.
10
The last one, the PD has failed
to monitor and ensure spending
on at-risk students. There's
been a lot of tension as of late
on what the authority, the
department has.
To tell school districts how to
spend their budgets. The court.
Said they could, um, and we do
have another case in.
Litigation suggesting that they
don't the one to the 180 day
rules. So I think there's a lot
been a lot of
Different direction provided
from the judicial branch on
where that fine line is on PD
authority.
What we do know is that the
department is monitoring how
much is being spent, as you can
see on the right side.
Um, about 83% of the funding
that you have allocated to
schools through the at-risk
index.
is being accounted for.
Under an at-risk service. Um, so
not the full amount, but a
majority of it.
Whether that is actually
translating into improved
outcomes, um, it's still
something that we need to study
further.
I'd like to take you all to page
13.
The court
As its north star said that you
had to
Improve
Outputs. It didn't, it wasn't
much a matter of how much
funding was invested, it was
more about how it was used and
whether we saw any improved
outcomes from it.
When the court determined what
those outputs were they used.
National test scores, the NAP.
Uh, they use the current
standardized test at the time,
which was PAC.
They looked at high school
graduation rates, and they
looked at college remediation
rates as indicators of whether
there was a sufficient
educational system. They saw
there was massive.
Gaps between at-risk students
and their peers, and they felt
that the overall proficiency
levels were inadequate. This is
a longitudinal.
Graph of the national
assessment.
Um, on the left side, you'll see
reading and on the right side,
you'll see math.
The
The dotted line is New Mexico,
4th grade and 8th grade students
and the solid line is the
national average.
On the last.
Assessment which was taken just
recently, we still rank 50th in
all categories for 4th, 8th,
math and reading.
On the next slide, page 14.
Here are some of the other.
Performance metrics that we
report on as a state, um.
What's promising on the left
side is that we do see chronic
absentee absenteeism rates
declining, meaning more kids are
coming to school, and we do see
that happening across all
demographic groups, which is
very promising.
We do also see that on the
national level too, so it
remains to be seen if that is
because of initiatives by the
state or if we are generally as
a nation coming back to school.
Uh, in the middle is the reading
proficiency rates that you see
on our state assessment, which
is called the Mesa measures of
student success and achievement,
and on the right side you'll see
math proficiency rates.
What's really fascinating is
that you see reading
proficiency, improving.
And math proficiency rates
essentially flat, but if you
turn to the previous page, they
don't seem to be matching trends
on the national assessment,
which
Um, may warrant further study as
well.
Turning to page 15.
Uh, we are seeing an
improvements in the high school
graduation rates. Uh, we are
also seeing graduation rates for
Native American students and
English learners closing the gap
between the the average for all
students.
Uh, similarly,
We see that
New Mexico would need slightly
over 2000 students to reach the
national average, which is
pretty
Interesting when you break it
down to a school level.
Most schools would only need to
graduate less than 10 students.
To get us there. So when you
Break it down to that.
sizable chunk it seems much more
doable.
There is a bit of a concern as
you're probably noticing at this
point that despite declining
proficiency rates in math and
A lot of students who are not
considered proficient in
reading, we are still seeing
high school graduation rates
improved.
On slide 16.
John had mentioned the AIR study
from 2008.
Um, at that time they had
proposed about 300 million being
added to the SCG and a few
formula reforms in 2008.
If you do an inflation adjusted
amount from what they had
proposed at the time and where
we are today, you'll see that
the actual investment by the
state has recently exceeded the
target set by AR in 2008. Um.
While there was a decade of
being under that target. I think
it is notable that we have made
progress in this area and we've
achieved a milestone that was
contemplated back in 2008.
I won't go into too much detail
on the next few slides, but
starting on slide 17, uh, we've
tried to do a rather interesting
accounting of all the
legislative actions that have
happened since the Martinez
Yazzi lawsuit was filed.
Um
Just as a highlight, the funding
formula has been changed about 5
times since then and the state
has really ramped up its
investments um since the ruling
took place, um, I'll let you
peruse those, but in the
For the sake of time, I will
turn it back over to John to
talk about recent
Legal action
Thank you, Sonny. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. I did want to point out
very quickly before I move to
the to the other motion that
Sony is right about.
How we,
how we've recently in the last
few years exceeded that AIR.
Recommended Mark for funding,
um.
Yeah
So you mentioned this already,
but if you go back 14, it was 14
years since the AIR study before
we surpassed that.
That recommended amount and
before that, um,
There was a call obviously for
additional funding, hence the AR
study to begin with.
So we've
In our committee we've talked
about it as this idea of we have
compounding interest on the
positive side, but when you
underfund something for a number
of years, a decade or more, you
also have compounding effects
of, of that system.
Um, very quickly, I'll turn you
to this brief.
I won't go through the whole
thing. I know, I know, I'll let
you read that in all your free
time, uh, while you're on the
floor to be serious spills, um,
this is a, this is essentially
an update uh of the most recent
Martinez Yazi motions filed
motion filed by the plaintiff's
attorneys. So in September 24,
the plaintiff's attorneys
essentially argued that the
original court ruling had called
for a remedial plan.
And until now that that the
responsibility for developing
that plan had fallen into the
public education department. The
plaintiffs argued that um
Results, student outcome
results, and the lack of a plan
indicated that PED maybe wasn't
the right place.
Uh, or the right folks to
develop that plan and actually
ask LESC and its staff to to
lead the coordination and
development of that plan with a
number of stakeholders. So, um,
I won't go through the whole
thing. I'm gonna point you to a
couple of of uh topics here on
page 2 under the heading
planning timeline, you'll see
some of the timelines that the
original.
Motion called for in developing
and submitting a plan. Again,
this was submitted back in
September, but we've yet to have
a court hearing on this motion.
I'll go through that a little
bit more. And so the timelines
called for here may sound uh
very expedient, and that's
because they are, and I don't,
we'll talk a little bit more
about that.
Under that red bar summary of
plan components.
Um
The motion called out
specifically the kinds of things
that should be included in that
plan, um, a transparent,
transparent, cohesive and
accountable system of delivering
special education, a special
education students were one of
the subgroups called out uh by
the lawsuit.
Um, and adequately staffed
system must be created
culturally and linguistically
responsive and high quality
student and family support
structures, which is also what
the court called up for, and
research has shown over and over
again that high quality teachers
are the most important in school
factor, uh, in contributing to
student uh positive student
outcomes.
Talks a little bit about
staffing at the at the agency.
Again, I'll let you, um,
Look over those on your own.
In November of 20 November 21st
of 2024 PED filed a response to
that motion, as Sonny said
earlier, they did, they did not,
the department did not.
Argue with the need for the
development of a plan.
Um, but, but argued that it was
the right place that with
education expertise that the
department should be the entity
developing that plan. It didn't
necessarily, uh, oppose LESC's
involvement in the development
of a plan, but actually called
for an outside mediator to kind
of help with that process and
the LESC could also be involved
with that.
Um, as a, as a little bit of a
plug for our committee under
other substantive issues on page
4.
Um
We have for our committee
developed what we call a
roadmap, starting in 2022, that
outlined some broad topics of
focus that we as staff focused
on during our interim studies
and that the, the committee has
focused on some of its proposals
over the last few years. I will
go through all the details,
obviously, again, the educator
ecosystem, which is that
Educator pipeline both.
Recruitment, training, retention
at the district level.
Academic focus and we, you all
have supported structured
literacy, I'm sorry, academic
design, you all supported.
Structured literacy as an
example of how we've revamped
the way that we teach reading in
the state, as well as a focus on
career tech and technical
education for secondary students
because we understand that
engagement, um,
We need to improve student
engagement.
Students have a variety of
interests and school districts
and and secondary schools in
particular should uh be able to
provide opportunities for those
students.
Um, investing in a world-class
bilingual and multilingual
education system.
And then, uh, the whole child
education, some of the social
emotional, uh, supports that we
all know students need as well
as tutoring and extended time in
school.
And then lastly, overarching
systems and um members of our
committee if if they're paying
attention, know that we've
talked a lot about the need for
better systems approaches in
terms of, especially in terms of
things like data.
You, you may all hear about
things like the number of
teacher vacancies that we have
every year in Mexico State
University, uh, their sword lab
puts together that data, and
it's what we rely on every year
to have some indication of uh
teacher vacancies.
What people may not understand
is those researchers.
Pretty much scour.
District websites.
Or what openings there are.
It's not a, it's not data
directly from the districts.
It's not something that the PED
has collected historically, and
so it's hard for us as staff to
give you good information about
how to approach um improving
that pipeline or understanding
the vacancy issue in general.
And that's just one example of
the need for
Overarching systems. And then,
of course,
This piece of about this, the
funding formula.
Which is how you distribute
money every year to schools, and
whether or not it's doing its
job in making sure that money
gets to the school districts and
students that need it most,
while also making sure that all
school districts have
Um, I've been, I quoted them
last week, I quote him again as
superintendent that we're that
we're striving to fund.
Not just for sufficiency but for
excellence, and that you're
creating a world-class system
for of education in this state.
And so, um, the last thing on
this, on this brief is this last
paragraph.
The plaintiffs for the um
attorney for the, I'm sorry, the
attorneys for the plaintiff have
until February 6th.
To to file a response to PED's
reply.
And at which point they intend
to ask the court to schedule an
actual hearing.
It's unclear how long that will
take.
would be a few weeks, months, a
few months, um, but
will wait to hear what the court
decides at that time.
And with that, Mr. Chair, the
only other thing did they all
get them?
I think we're going to hand out
just for some context in terms
in case you have questions
through the discussion, that one
page.
Um
That describes
In a very high level way, the
way that the funding formula
works, all the funding
components and factors in case
that you have some questions
about that or if I can uh add
any clarity.
And Mr. Chair, we also have,
you'll be hearing the public
school support budget
recommendations in a few weeks.
But um if you wanted just some
context between the differences
and the LFC and LEC
recommendations and the
similarities between the two.
we've created also a Venn
diagram for your reference here.
And Mr. Chair, with that, I
think we stand for questions.
All right, very well, thank you.
Thank you to both of you.
Um, we have, uh, quite a few
questions, so we'll go ahead and
we'll start with uh.
Leonard Steinborn.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chair, and
guys, thanks for being here
today and good presentation,
really helpful.
So, I have a series of
questions, but they don't have
to be long questions or long
answers. Um.
At risk, how do you define an
at-risk student, Mr. Cha,
Senator Steinborn, um, we don't
have technically a definition
for an at-risk student. We have
currently in the formula, the
way that we determine that risk
funding um.
That's different. So again, the
three components just as a
reminder for folks, English
learners economically
disadvantaged students, highly
mobile students essentially.
Those are the classifications of
students that we use for funding
purposes.
11 place where we've kind of got
a little messy is how the court
defined that risk in the
Martinez Yazi case, which
included economically
disadvantaged students with
disabilities, Native American
students, and English learners.
So some overlap, some
differences. We don't have a
clear statutory definition, if
you will, for what constitutes
an at-risk student.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, the reason
I ask is, is obviously, you
know, we're giving a lot of
money based upon net risk
factors. So how do you know how
much to give?
Um
Obviously it's a variety of
factors like you said.
I was really, um,
I want to ask about something
you'd said, because as we look
at our proficiency rates, um, in
reading and
And uh math.
First I was wondering, well, did
this take a big dip during COVID
and looking at the data, it
seems like historically that's
not really the case. Maybe there
was a dip, but our proficiency
rates have been the same low
level or am I reading that data
correctly?
Mr. Chair, Senator, so, uh, at
the national level, if you look
at the, I'm gonna go back to the
chart that Sonny had in his
presentation of NApe, which is
National assessment of economic
uh educational progress, which
we call the nation's report
card. It's sort of the one test
that every state takes a
representative sample of
students, you will see a dip.
Slide 13. Thank you, Sonny, in
22, so after the pandemic.
Um, or state for state
assessments in 2020 and 2021,
there were no
State assessments given. And so
that's why you may not see a
dramatic dip for those
particular years, um, although
you'll see that we're
Barely crawling back after the
pandemic.
Page 14.
Mr. Chair, senator, I would also
say that when you look at the
previous park assessment.
And you look at the new Mesa
assessment.
Which happened, the search
happened in between the
pandemic.
If you didn't know that the
pandemic was there, you would
assume student.
Outcomes actually improved post
pandemic because they're a
little higher.
Than the previous test. But when
you look at the national test,
you see that dip. So it's it's a
bit of a
It's a bit of a confusing trend
when you try to do an apple. The
apples comparison which the two
tests do not appear to be
comparable. Mr. Chair, let me
ask this question then. have
student proficiency in reading
and math gone down since, since
the pandemic.
So this, Mr. Chair, uh, Senator
Sinborn, uh, again on page 14,
you'll see a bit of a mixed bag.
In that middle, that middle
graph on page 14. You'll
actually see that uh proficiency
rates and reading were almost
all subgroups have increased.
Right, um, for all students,
we've, we've, we've seen sort of
a flat trend with a little bit
of increase from FY 22 to FY 23
from last.
The last two tests a little bit,
a little bit of flat.
You should all have received
this. This is uh LESD's annual
report, you should have either
received it at your.
Uh, in the chambers or in your
office, if you have it, let me
know so that we can get you a
copy. But this kind of gets into
some of the more nuanced. We've
seen these interesting trends
where economically disadvantaged
students, for instance, have
actually shown improvement over
the last year. We attribute that
to a lot of buffering that you
all have done as a state in
terms of funding specific
programs as well as federal.
uh COVID relief funds.
Whereas uh some other subgroups,
non-economically disadvantaged,
for instance, have actually
decreased from last year to this
year. So when you look at the
state,
Average, you're seeing kind of
flat trends, but within specific
subgroups you are seeing
improvement.
Mr. Chair, if you want to turn,
I think this is on your chair,
volume one.
There's on page 98, what I was
describing, at least report the
8th grade students.
Yeah
They'll test the new tests show
just continued growth.
One thing that is kind of
startling is that when you look
at the achievement gap between
at-risk students and their non
at risk peers.
That gap hasn't really closed as
far as math and reading, what
we've seen. It has closed a bit.
And um graduation rates.
So thank you and I wanna.
Ask about what you said, like,
how do we, what's, what, what
are some of the most effective
tools and policies proven to
help raise student results and
also kind of gets to the polling
you started off with asking
students about.
Their satisfaction in schools,
but you had said it's teachers,
it's teacher training.
Which I found was really
interesting, which makes sense
if you have a good teacher,
you're going to be motivated,
you're gonna learn. If you got a
bad one, you know, that's kind
of the vehicle to the system and
the end result. So,
Would you elaborate on that a
little bit?
Sure, uh, Mr. Chair, Senator
Steinborg, uh, what you just
said is, is the gist of it,
right? Having a well qualified,
highly trained teacher in the
classroom, it makes sense
because that's where students
spend most of their time, right?
Um, that's especially true, and
again, as I mentioned in that
secondary, you see elementary
school teachers, you have a lot
of, you build relationships with
students over the course of the
year. You see student
proficiencies increase when you
get to that secondary space,
middle school and high school.
For a lot of different reasons,
including you're now not seeing
just one teacher, maybe you're
seeing 6 and 7 or 7 teachers and
the quality of that, those
teachers vary across the course
of a day and your level of
engagement varies across the
course of the day. We've all
been in high school, we know
what that's like to have
teachers that you really enjoyed
and others that maybe not so
much. Um, so teachers are
extremely important. The other
piece of this though is whether
or not the systems.
are responsive to student
interests and needs, right? And
I don't want to, and I want to
be very careful. I'm gonna say
the term, but I want to be
careful about how I say this,
this idea of college for
everyone. We've seen sort of a
backlash against that.
I would argue that um.
For those of you who didn't know
I was a high school, uh.
English teacher.
And my favorite saying was,
I would rather have you ready to
go to college and decide not to.
Then decided to go to college at
the last minute and not be ready
to.
And so when we talk about career
technical education and other
kinds of programming and
secondary level specifically.
We want to make sure that we're
that we're insisting on high
quality instruction for both
things that they are co-equal.
And so that we're not setting up
students to head down one track
or another and then get stuck in
that track, right, right, and
that, that leads to better
student engagement, right?
I, I just mentioned.
But in all fairness to all our
members and then to our other
presenters forthcoming if we
could just keep our
You know, back and forth our
response uh more precise.
Go ahead. Thanks. Thanks, Ms.
Chair, and I'll, I'll wrap it up
here. I, I would love to, I
mean, I assume there was data
when we say teaching is the most
effective thing to close the
gap. I assume that there's data
that says that.
Uh, because we're obviously
doing a lot of things and we've
invested a lot of money in the
last few years and teach
parentsness we raise teacher
pay.
On and on and on and uh.
Makes sense. Um, I hope, yeah,
we continue to invest in that. I
mean,
And everything else, but um I
just want to ask about HB 63
real quick.
And
Um
So what does that, does that
fund more vocational training at
schools.
Is that part of it, Mr. Senator
Sanborn, it doesn't specifically
require that schools spend money
on career technical education,
but it allows schools uh to do
so in a, in a way that that we
haven't done before, sustainable
year over year.
occurring funding.
And Mr. Chair, I'll just give
you a distinction. So as an
example, you've.
As a legislature made a huge
investment in K-12 Plus, which
is an extended school year
program. That one requires
schools to add days to generate
more funding.
We provide an increase in the
membership weight, um, to John's
point, it does shift the formula
to secondary students, but
there's not a requirement that
they have to do vocational
education to generate that
funding. They just need to have
secondary students for that
funding.
OK. And then also we talked
about broader student supports.
I don't know what that means,
but I was just kind of curious
what was included for that
money.
If we get it, what it what it
really does for our schools.
Mr. Chair, Senator, broader
student supports are things like
social workers, counselors. I
think it's important to remember
that we don't fund those things
specifically in the formula we,
we allow school districts to
make local decisions about how
to spend their operational
funds. This would essentially
provide additional funding at
the secondary level or things
like CTE if that's what a local
community or school district
decides as a priority.
While also offering some
flexibility to provide those
other kinds of supports like
social workers and, and
counselors.
Well, thanks. I'll end it there.
Thanks, mister.
Uh thank you very much, Mr.
Chair, and of course to the
members of the committee, to the
presenters.
Thank you very much for a uh
pensive approach to how we're
dealing with education as we
move forward.
We ultimately talk about the
resources that are needed in
terms of providing.
Of the best education possible,
but we also know that
The resources uh it's only one
component of uh success as we
deal with education.
So I'd like to start from
Respective of the SCG itself.
Over the years as we deal with
it and I know school districts
consistently wait to have that
adjustment in order for them to
go ahead and uh work if you will
on what the future of their
programmatic year is going to
entail.
Can you talk a little bit about
what you see as the reliability
of establishing maybe the SCG a
little bit earlier.
So districts are not in a
compacted sense in dealing with
the SCG preparing their budget
and if you will also recruiting
and then of course uh retaining
and uh and completing programs
for students.
Mr. Chair, Senator Compos,
thanks for the question, um.
So the budget cycle for school
districts obviously starts now
in the spring, and as you said,
they we didn't anticipation.
Or essentially you ought to make
a decision about the
appropriation.
And that's one distinction I
didn't make earlier is that the
funding formula is a
distribution method.
And how much schools get relies
solely on on what you all decide
to appropriate for that, for
that distribution.
And so, um, that they all wait.
While you're deciding on that
appropriation.
They're currently um
Preparing budget documents,
gathering data, submitting
things to PED.
So that when that unit value is
set.
And all the other places are
ready, and so I think
The only thing that I would say
about improving that process is
is potentially has something to
do with the timing of those
decisions.
As well as district's ability to
count on a particular amount of
funding year over year. In these
years, uh, in the last few
years, we've been very
fortunate, obviously, that most
people don't assume they're
gonna lose money next year
because of where we are as a
state in terms of revenue. Um,
so they're probably able to make
pretty good decisions about what
next year might look like,
knowing that they aren't going
to have any cuts.
They always wait on one the
total appropriation and what
that means in terms of future
compensation, any sort of policy
change that policy changes that
might affect their budget.
And so in terms of um
Providing some level of
stability in the long run.
And I think as staff we've
talked about this is at some
point you also want to stop
making changes.
And let the system actually play
to make sure that we understand
how these
These functions are working,
these factors are working, um,
so that we have a better
opportunity to study them, but
so that districts also have some
stability year over year,
whether that's the amount of
days or hours or some of these
factors. So providing some
stability and consistency is
going to be very helpful for
them.
So Mr. Chairman, if I may and I
really appreciate that because
again, it, it shows that you're
putting a lot of thought into
this.
So in order to go ahead and
create, if you will, a financial
stability and to assist
districts.
Because we often hear it during
the final preparation of that
budget and into, if you will,
preparation for the next school
year.
We hear that possibly districts
fall short of the finances in
order to, I will say special
need instructors at risk
instructors and and the like.
So within that, uh, and, and
you, you in essence are not
talking about some of the
solutions in order for us to
move forward so economic
stability, and if you will, the
reliability and vision building
is gonna be very important.
In talking a little bit about
the at-risk funding, and I know
that we consistently look at our
rent uh rating and ranking as we
move forward.
What percentage of
Addressing the student at risk
issues would it take?
For us to go ahead and move up
the ladder in terms of possibly
not being considered.
To be, uh.
Close to the bottom in terms of
uh our school systems throughout
the country.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator, that's
the billion dollar question. I
think that.
You have made significant
investments.
Um
Particularly on all
Parts of the system, both in
preparation of new teachers.
And professional development,
such as the science of reading
for current teachers, you've
raised salaries to increase
recruitment and also to retain
some teachers.
You've really invested in
leadership pipeline programs,
and yet I think there's sort of
this inertia that we had to
overcome, particularly with
recent events like the pandemic.
And a lot of turnover that we
see both at the leadership and
the classroom level.
Um
I've always
thought that once we got to a
point where there was a teacher
surplus when we could actually
choose the best educators rather
than having just a warm body in
the classroom.
That we've gotten to a place
where we know that our system is
Going on all cylinders at that
point, but until then, I think.
There remains a question of, you
know,
You could put a bunch of funding
in.
Um
But it doesn't really matter how
much if you're not actually
leveraging it in a way that is
actually changing what's
happening in classrooms right
now. So Mr. Chairman, as we go
along now, we're getting into,
if you will, part of the
evolvement of
our educational process and that
leads to the schools of
education, uh, at our
institutions of higher learning.
Where are we there as we prepare
teachers and we find that many
of our teachers after 2 to 4
years leave education for
various reasons, but again our
schools drew the evidence-based
pieces preparing our teachers at
all levels.
In order to deal with our
students, whether it be
elementary or all the way, if
you will to uh the top level of
secondary education.
Mr. Chair, Senator Campos, it's
It's, it's really critical what
you're talking about the higher
ed piece, and so you all have
invested over the last few years
in in teacher residencies as as
one component. And what teacher
residencies does essentially
places uh
Teacher candidate in a classroom
with a master teacher for an
entire school year.
Similar to what we used to think
about of student teaching, but
this is a more in depth and more
structured, uh, program, um,
we're, we're between, I want to
say 300 or 500 students
depending on the year who are
participating in those
residencies.
Um
The other piece of this is uh
You'll see a piece of
legislation, I believe this
session, although some of this
work has already started to
ensure that teachers uh
Educator preparation programs
are are actually teaching that
structured literacy component
that we've been training all
elementary school teachers.
We want to make sure that the
folks coming out of those
programs don't have to be
retrained when they get into a
classroom because they didn't
receive the the appropriate
training in the first place. And
so most of our colleges of
education have already made that
transition or making that
transition currently, you may
see a piece of legislation
essentially requiring it,
although many of them are are
already doing it.
Um
But to your point, it's, it's
extremely, oh, last pieces
you'll also see a piece of
legislation that is LESC
endorsed.
That is uh revamping the way we
train principals.
And so the research also bears
out that 2 to teachers is
principals and leadership, and
part of the reason that teachers
leave
I pay compensation conditions,
but also leadership and whether
or not they have the adequate
supports and adequate leadership
from their school principals,
and so there's a bill.
Um, proposing to change how we
uh train principals and
superintendents as well as well
as creating two licensure
pathways for those.
To folks
Because those jobs are
connected, but also very
different. We want to make sure
those leaders are prepared.
Accordingly,
Because to your point, this is
all part of a system. You can
move one lever over here, but if
you're not taking care of
everything else, you might
actually be setting people up
for failure.
So Mr. Charing on just a couple
of other points. There's a whole
lot of other issues that we can
address, but I'm in essence
trying to get all of us to think
about.
What the very basics and the
essence of educational success
and excellence happens to be so
in tying this together, it's
also inclusion and community
input, which means everything
from, as you indicate classroom
observation by we'll just say
our administrators, uh, by those
that are trained in order to
help teachers become better at
uh at the profession and then
along with that with the school
boards association with their
superintendents association. So
within.
Everything that we've seen when
we start talking about.
Educational success.
What is the evidence showing us
about inclusion, not only with
the PTO PTAs or student groups
or, or parent groups, or
community groups, what, what is
that showing us because we
continuously hear about.
Those being the success pieces
to offer support to teachers in
the classrooms to ensure that
students at all levels when they
get out into the community and
maybe they're going to their
home and parents aren't totally
immersed in in helping them to
read, learn math, do other
things and and they're out there
in the community and our people
indicating, well, you don't need
an education or look at me, this
is the way that I made my
living. How are we?
Working to immerse ourselves in
that process, and what is the
evidence-based piece showing us
the ties in the information that
you've brought before us today.
Mr. Chair, Senator, I'd say
there's been a lot of
Um, literature on this, what we
do see is that if you have more
inclusive schools.
You're less likely to suspend or
put disciplinary infractions on
students.
Students may feel safer, they
may attend more.
Essentially reducing your
chronic absenteeism.
And as we all know, when
students are in schools and they
have a qualified educator.
You can do 2 or 3 years of
learning in a year. It is
possible.
And as you're also well aware,
A lot of the students that come
into school, um, are several
years behind, um, and so
What we found is that the system
gives them about a year each of
instruction each year, but they
never quite close the gap.
So you've made a lot of
investments in early childhood
to try and.
get students more ready as they
enter school, but to your piece
about inclusion, it's also
making sure they feel safe and
engaged and that they stay in
school and that their teachers
believe they can succeed. I
think that is one of the key
findings from the literature on
inclusion.
Mr. Chairman and the last
question that I have and thank
you for your tolerance as I, I
move forward through this.
The early college high schools,
if you will, how we
do language concurrent
enrollment and ensuring that
there is a proper segue from
postsecondary to higher
education, and if you will, to
the uh uh vocational pieces,
career pieces, regardless of
what term they use. How do we
Better if you will prepare.
Our system to have that
connectivity as we we did with
elementary and uh the next
period for adolescence.
How are we tying this together,
and is there still a weakness or
a void.
When it comes to what we do
there because if we're not
getting students to fully
complete their course of study.
What's happening to them? Are
they discouraged? Is it within
this whole process, it, it's not
meaningful to them. What are,
what are those things that will
help us with that connectivity
so students complete and they
move on with a successful
career.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Senator,
to really um
Important question that I think
varies from community to
community. I'll say a couple of
things. One,
Last session you all passed
House Bill 171, which is the
revision to the high school
graduation requirements.
And part of that, uh, part of
that change was to require all
school districts to
To develop what's called the
graduate of a profile of a
graduate.
And so that, that should be an
intentional effort to engage
your community parents,
families, as well as business
partners and other educational
partners in your community, if
that be an institution of higher
ed, for example.
To develop a profile for what a
student graduating from your
district should be able to know
and do.
And that's gonna vary across
communities. I think that's one
way to have those uh intentional
conversations between those
organizations to ensure that
you, you don't have those gaps
that's gonna be very important.
Um
Overall, I think this is to
maybe to a larger point and a
little bit to the, to the, to
the call for a plan at the state
level.
I
So much of the innovation and
positive things that are
happening at school districts
are happening because of who
your superintendent is.
Or who a principal might be. And
that's really great.
The problem is when that
superintendent or principal
leaves.
Things don't always continue,
right? We don't have
Um, sort of a collective vision
for what all of this should look
like.
And so I think the legislature
needs to play a role in this, as
do the department and
communities across the state.
In determining what does success
look like?
And starting to develop some
metrics about what does it look
like to make progress to those
to those goals.
And so that as a state, we can
actually provide some guidance,
um, to school districts and
school boards with their input.
Or what that progress should
look like and so that progress
isn't dependent on whether or
not there's one person who has a
lot of energy and a lot of great
ideas.
But instead is supported by the
system as a whole.
And so that work can continue
regardless of who sits in the
superintendency for the
principal seat, knowing again
that they're gonna have.
Adequate funding, that there's
going to be programming that's
available to students for for
opportunities, um, and that
community also understand.
What the benchmarks are too,
because in the end it's our
communities that are going to
hold our local school districts
for lack of a better term,
accountable.
For whether or not they're doing
a good job, right? We can look
at all the data in the world
here at the state level.
So much of that is happening at
the at the.
local level
And so how we establish a
statewide vision for success.
The kinds of initiatives and
funding that are required to get
there.
And then how that's communicated
to the local level is all very
important. Otherwise, we're
going to end up with
disjointedness, no matter our
best efforts. So, Mr. Chair, and
this time I'd like to commend
the two gentlemen that are
presenting today for a couple of
reasons.
First of all, the thoughtfulness
and the work they continue to
do, that's the due diligence,
but the second part.
is within it, they're looking
for solutions and they've
already said it.
It's really time for us to take
a deep breath.
See what has worked.
Strengthen that.
Those things that haven't.
Possibly uh work so that we can
either refine those things or we
can discard them.
But the whole key to
continuously looking towards.
More money
Finding other things to deal
with, but yet when we deal with
that risk,
When we deal with the SCG when
we deal with the other
components, the whole key is
what's truly working, and that's
where we need at this point, at
least in my opinion, uh, to
place our efforts in order to be
more successful for our
students. Thank you very much,
Mr. Chair.
The senator and again uh
I can remind everyone if we can
be a little more precise.
And keeping a little bit more
for.
Time-wise
We go to Senator
Thank you chair and thank you to
the presenters. Excellent
information. Uh, I'll just get
to the point right away to the
chair's point, um, so if you
look at the um court findings
and the state responses, etc.
There's 18 of them.
6 of them start with the term at
risk.
And um so when I, when I created
the uh
Early childhood education and
care department along with my
colleague right here, Senator
Trujillo, when she was in the
house, uh, the broadband office,
the cybersecurity office, all
the things you see me work on is
I try to look at, at, at, at the
state government operations from
the lens of efficiency and
throughput, and I'm just
wondering, do we have or can you
tell me, is there anyone that um
wakes up every single day,
eating, sleeping, and drinking.
How do I turn the at-risk
population in our public schools
in the right direction.
Because that's 33% of all the
findings there. There's a number
of reasons why I get it, they're
not all like situated in one
office or whatever, but is there
somebody that wakes up every
single day and is looking for
the most efficient way to manage
those that particular
population.
Mr. Chair, Senator, I would
argue there's about
50,000 of them, and they're all
in schools every day.
I think it's hard to find 50,000
people who are the
Very best
closing the gaps.
And for students every single
day, um, and
I think that as to your point,
you know, we don't have a single
unified entity that is
overseeing that monitoring and
forcing best practices. It's
really left up.
To local discretion at that
point.
Yeah, so, so, uh, for example,
the uh early childhood education
and care service delivery when I
got here 13 years ago was being
delivered by, you could say a
total of 7 state agencies, but
really 3 or 4, and really, you
know,
CYFD. We had early education in
the emergency room essentially.
We decided to pick it all up
and, you know, so now you have
someone eating, sleeping,
drinking every single day,
waking up, how do I focus on
early education. I find that if
you have just 50,000 people out
there working on this and no
one's on first, who's who's
coordinating this. So I just
throw that out there. I hope the
department might want to
consider maybe retooling,
reconfiguring somehow, something
that is a more directed focus.
So to the chair's point, I'm
gonna keep moving. Thank you for
your response, honey, and
Uh, did you wanna, OK. So next
piece is, you know, one of my
primary swim lanes here in this
building is, is out of the 7 or
17 lanes that I swim in. One of
them is on the broadband topic.
Uh, I find that, you know, I'm
guessing that a lot of our, you
know, Yasi Martinez and are at
risk and what have you, have to,
I would bet if you were to layer
over a couple of, of, of maps on
top of each other, you would
find the lack of broadband being
um a huge detractor to this.
the educational outcomes for a
lot of these at-risk students
that are out there, would you,
would you want to guess or, or,
or comment on that. Mr. Chair,
you are correct that a lot of
the gaps in our connectivity are
on tribal lands and other rural
areas of the state, um, probably
you'll see most of that overlap
with the at-risk population in
those tribal areas.
I've seen um
You know, I, I, I would venture
to guess that, um, you know,
we're doing a lot, we've seen a
lot of improvement where
broadband is concerned in the 13
years lease that I've been here,
I've been beating this drum like
a crazy person up here. Um.
You know, we really need to
understand that and, and maybe
give that data and information
to the uh office of Broadband
Access and expansion and others
focused on broadband delivery to
make sure they know exactly
where they need to be like
focused like a laser beam to
bring, you know, we just brought
$670 million into the state as a
result of the creation of that
office, and we should be
celebrating that, but I want to
make sure that it's going to the
areas that most badly needed.
So, you know, I just want to
throw that out there. Uh, and
then the third item which I
thought, you know, your
comments, Mr. Director, were
really very good, uh, Mr. Chair,
Mr. Director on
You, you do need, um,
Leadership that is ongoing. Do
you, would you care to comment
on how many districts do like
succession planning, because
superintendents do retire. The
shelf life of a superintendent
right now. I just don't even
know if I'd want that job
because it would be, you know,
it just seems like there's an
awful lot of turnover on that.
And I don't know if anyone wants
to comment that maybe that the
DART department or whatever, but
do we have succession planning
going on in my business. I, I, I
run a had a business for 25
years here in New Mexico and for
my own business and for a lot of
our clients.
We work with developing what we
call a 9 blocker so that we get
skill versus will and we have
we're pushing people always to
the upper right hand corner. How
much time are we spending or how
many districts do we know that
are actually doing succession
planning is when the
superintendent goes, you don't
want that enthusiasm and energy
to go right out the door with
him.
And Mr. Chairenator but yeah,
it's a, it's a great question.
Um, I don't have
specific numbers, I think some
superintendents are, are better
at identifying talent and
growing talent within their
district than others.
Across the state, I think the
turnover rate is probably every
2 or 3 years, you're, you're
going to superintendents pretty
quickly. I, I will point out
that the legislation I I
mentioned earlier about changing
how we train principals and
superintendents is is based sort
of on some work by the Wallace
Foundation about principal
pipelines, and it is about that
intentionality, both in terms of
school districts identifying
talents, but also having a clear
connection to those institutes
of higher ed, so that when you
identify the talent, they're
getting trained on the job in
school districts while also
connecting them to those
educator preparation programs to
ensure that they're getting the
best sort of academic piece of
of training.
I would say most of that is
done, uh.
Maybe haphazard is too harsh to
term, but.
Thank you very much for that.
Sonny, did you want?
Mr. Chair, I do also want to say
you may see typically your pool
of candidates coming from
principals at schools and a
recent evaluation found that
you're turning over about 50 of
them, so 20% a year.
I appreciate that, you know, um,
I almost feel like maybe we
should ask the department to ask
that question every year. Tell
us what your succession planning
looks like and what does your
next line of leadership look
like because that's how you're
gonna like, you know, be able to
have movement in districts and
continue the good works of those
districts. I do get the sense
that if a superintendent is just
a rock star, they're probably
gonna be in that district for a
while, but yeah.
Very quickly, Mr. Child just
mentioned that obviously
Superintendent contracts are
also contingent on school board
action.
And so we, we see school bird
behavior in all sorts of ways
bad and otherwise, uh, that
contributes to that turnover.
I, I couldn't agree more. I mean
that the school board members
got to be the hardest job in
elective office. I mean, you did
what to my baby?
My baby has to walk another 120
ft to the bus. Are you kidding
me? I mean, that's a tough,
tough job, but we should be
asking those questions. I mean,
what are we doing to build a
leadership bench strength, so
that, you know, it sustains
itself. Thank you, Chair.
you, uh, Senator Trio.
Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank
you guys for being here. Um, I
apologize for being a little bit
late.
I'm not gonna take too much
time. I do have some, uh, we
could be here all day talking
about this for sure. Um, I feel
like, like we're all on the same
team.
Right? Whether you're a
superintendent, the PED the
governor, our local boards were
on the same team, but we don't
seem to be rowing in the same
direction or in sync, and I
think the idea of having some
sort of a plan that comes from,
you know, this higher level, I
still believe in no time to
lose. I believe in the precepts
of that. Um, if we have this
bigger plan that we've all
participated in having input.
And we all agree that we have to
do, then we're going to go.
We're gonna have our oars going
in the same direction. I just
say that um,
On page 98 of the volume one.
Um, thank you again for pulling
that out. I would just, I would
just say.
That
In the 4th grade proficiency
rates, 40% of reading is still
not OK.
Even 40% is not OK, and so of
those 60% of students that
aren't proficient in 4th grade,
and then it carries through.
It's almost the same level in
8th grade. I don't see that
there's any big change.
Um, I would say that those 60%
in reading and the coinciding,
I'm not the greatest math
person, but about 75% in math.
I would say every single one of
those students are at risk.
Regardless of what their
characteristics are, whether
they're low income, whether
they're, um, I, I just, I, you
could come up with any one of
those characteristics. They're
all at risk.
Because they're all at risk of
not succeeding. And so,
When I look at the um go back to
your policy briefing, one of the
things that really stands out to
me as potentially being
something that I really love to
see us move forward on, and I
know that there's a cost
involved in that.
And that is an accountability
system. We spent many years like
kind of doing the stick instead
of the carrot, and I think now
we're swinging to the other side
and we're trying to do the
carrot, but neither one of them
are having any impact.
So I'm wondering like what that
account accountability system
might look like. Are we talking
about a share?
Nobody wants to have shared
statewide, but some sort of a
system like that where we've got
finances.
That are, that are being managed
through the same system, of
course, you cut off each school
district from each school
district so that there's not
confusion, but are we talking
about financial systems, are we
talking about HR systems. Um,
are we talking about a student
plan for those 40 or 60 and 75%
of the students.
Um, what does that look like?
Uh, Mr. Chair, uh, Senator
Trujillo, it's, it's a really
good question and accountability
is a is a tricky word, I think
when it comes to education
because of the experiences that
people have had, but you're, I
think most folks would agree
that we want schools to be
operating the best that they can
with the best people that they
have, so that students can have
the best outcomes that that.
We want for them.
How we get there. So one, you
all have asked the department to
put in place a lot of plans, if
you will, and accountability
measures. So we've got districts
fill out an educational plan.
Uh, essentially says how we're
gonna do things.
They submit their budgets that
are an indication of a plan
because they're saying this is
how we plan to spend our money.
We have, um, your pass Senate
Bill 96 in 2020, I believe,
which created a a essentially a
fiscal dashboard for all school
districts and PEDs running that.
We have attendance dashboards.
We have a lot of information
about
what's happening in schools.
And so to your previous comment,
I think they're connected is
that.
That accountability has to be
connected to that larger vision
of what we're trying to
accomplish. Otherwise, we're
just trying to sort of
Track nickels and dimes, which
is important in fiscal
responsibility, but may or may
not help us to understand.
Whether or not
It's anything is helping.
And, and so, um, of course,
In, in my mind, this is me
personally, that accountability
has to be a balance of
Making sure that people are
doing their jobs well, while
also ensuring that they have the
resources they need to do their
job.
Well
You can't have one without the
other, and I think we're very
close as a state to be in a in a
position.
Where we're doing funding well,
we're providing resources,
although there's probably more
work to be done, um, while also
pairing that with professional
development training like
structured literacy, so that we
can then come in and say, you
have good resources, you've got
good training, now show us that
you're doing the right thing.
Mr. Chair and Senator, if I
could just quickly say a few
things.
Uh, one of my favorite quotes
is.
Accountability is what's left
when you subtract
responsibility.
Um, I think there's a time for
accountability. Um, I don't
think it applies in every
situation. Um, it really should
be focused when
Things have gone horribly wrong.
And we need to step in.
I think in general, um, as you
said, we are moving into a phase
where we are trying to
Both provide a carrot and a
stick.
Um, I will make a plug for our
chair. He is running a bill
right now that
is going to give us
Some time to study things that
she'll promise.
And I think that that will give
us a chance as a state to say,
rather than saying you must do
this, here's something that's
working, and we should all
consider it.
Um, so
Stay tuned.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I
like the idea of not telling
people what they have to do, but
I also support the idea of
telling them what they have to
achieve, right? Like, like we,
you have to achieve our kids can
read and our kids can do math
and that they can be successful
in their next venture in life,
which is a career, um, whatever
they choose to do.
Going back to, and I, I just
have like one more question, Mr.
Chairman. I'll be quick about
this. Um, when you look at page
13 of this, the dismal outputs.
Um
I, I appreciate you mentioning
that at each school, we're
talking about 10 kids to improve
graduation rates. What are we
talking about in regards to
Reading
And that
Mr. Senator, I just want to
clarify, you mean the number of
students who would need to be
More proficient.
Well, everyone counts. I think
every, every student that we can
move across that finish line
counts, um, again, I'll just
refer back to some of the work
we've done where we, we're
actually seeing, at least at the
state level, and I do want to
make the distinction for folks
who aren't that familiar that on
on slide 13, we're referring to
the nape again that federal
test.
We have a different test at the
state level, every state has a
different test at the state
level. So it is hard to compare
apples to apples when we when we
think about that, and when we
compare proficiency on our state
test versus proficiency on, on.
But
You know, going back to No Child
Left Behind, for instance, when
we said 100% of students needed
to be proficient by 2014. Lily,
we didn't get there.
And I think um
While you wanna have
Explicit goals and outcomes
stated so people can work toward
them. You also want to be
careful about overwhelming folks
who might feel like that's a
very daunting task.
And so again, I, I know this is
a bit of a cop out, but going
back to this idea of
Sonny's right.
Every teacher, every EA, every
principal in the state probably
wakes up every day thinking, how
do I help students today? It's
not for lack of trying, and so
making sure that they have uh
The best training resources
funding all of the things.
Thank you, um, Mr. Chairman. I
will just say that
The Mississippi miracle wasn't
really a miracle, right? I mean,
part of what they did is they
focused on reading, and we're
doing that, we're doing just
that very thing. Uh, the other
thing they did is that they
retained 3rd grade students who
couldn't read, I've always been
in opposition to that because I
think that's an arbitrary
decision that shouldn't be
decided up here, um, at the
roundhouse. I think it's a
decision that needs to be
As it states in law.
The Teacher, the parents, the
principal, those are very
personal decisions, but when I
look at, you know, section
22-2C-6 for mediation programs.
I'm just wondering, like, is
there someone who's monitoring
to make sure that
A parent shall be notified no
later than the end of the 2nd
great period that the student's
child is not academically
proficient and a conference is
held.
And then that uh specific
academic deficiencies and
remediation strategies will be
explained to the student's
parents in a written
intervention plan developed and
then followed through, like, are
we doing those things? Is there
someone that's monitoring to
make sure that these things are
happening.
Cause again, I am not supported
3rd grade retention because they
don't think it's a healthy
thing, but they did support
having some sort of
accountability to make sure that
those kids, those 60% of kids in
75% of kids got the resources
that they needed and that their
teachers had the resources they
needed to provide those kids
those resources, and I'm not
sure that I see that happening,
cause when I look at 8th grade,
it's in the same.
It's the same.
Anyway, I'll just leave with
that, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll keep
mine pretty short.
Um
I think Mrs. Truhill, Senator
Trujil was in my high school.
Um, first, I wanna, I wanna
thank you for your service, and
it is a service you being a, a
teacher and everything, um.
I taught for a lot of years and
I, I feel your pain and
One of, one of the things that I
always taught my student
teachers to ask the very first
question I wanted them to ask.
At the end of every single day.
Are we meeting the needs of our
students.
Well, that's a very general.
S
But when you break it down, we
as a state have been dumping all
kinds of money.
I mean, we dump money into
buildings, we dump money into.
Programs, we dump money into
teachers, we, everything.
The guard rails that center
Trujil was talking about the
accountability that, that's a
must.
But the accountability also
comes from parents.
Students
In your school district.
So how
How do you see going forward
that money is going to change.
The education system.
At this point, I mean, you were
asking, was it 134 million.
How, how is that actually going
to change the system and how are
we going to account for every
dime of that.
Mill.
Mr. Chair, Senator, uh, first, I
just want to clarify, teaching
was the time of my life.
So, um, and, and, and this isn't
true for everything, like I
said, leadership also matters,
um.
I think we'd have a lot more
people in the classroom if they
thought that was a a more
fiscally viable way to make a
living.
And, and I know you all have
done a lot from the from the
legislature, but I'll ask
anybody to put themselves in the
shoes of someone, a 20 year
veteran with an advanced degree
who is now making maybe $75,000
a year, given what we know.
Everything costs in the world.
And whether or not that's
That future is the and I can
just speak for myself
personally, that wasn't the
future I was, I was, I was
willing to, to, to look forward
to, I guess. I decided to do
something different and still
work in education, thankfully.
Um, so I think that's, that's
one piece of it is you all have
invested heavily in personnel
and that's really important.
Whether or not, um,
That is actually creating the
conditions that you are
recruiting the best people and
in this room not too long ago,
I, I asked my committee.
What would you pay?
The guarantee that every single
one of your kids' teachers was
the best teacher.
Because you've worked in schools
and and you know there's that
quality varies for various
reasons. So that's, that's one
piece of it.
The other piece I'll say about
the money that you've invested
recently, which has been very
helpful.
Um
Is that it's been directed at
specific things, teacher pay,
for instance.
So when you appropriate money
for teacher pay, school
districts spend that money on
teacher pay.
When you appropriate money for
additional school days, for
instance.
That's pretty much just paying
people to come to work more
days.
So that may mean
Better things are happening for
more days, or it could mean that
the same thing is happening for
more days.
And so, as far as this
particular proposal is
concerned.
Um
Our committee was interested in
providing additional funding in
a place or
Generated by students that we
that.
That we have heard and research
has shown.
Need additional support.
But also provides local school
districts with the flexibility
to make some of those decisions,
and that money is not devoted to
a specific thing like teacher
pay, they can actually change or
innovate practice or offer
programs that they had not
offered in the past.
And so that's whether or not
that's going to solve all our
problems, I doubt it.
But I do think it's a, it's a a
step in the right direction
because
Um
And, and money isn't going to
solve all those problems as
we've talked about. This is part
of a comprehensive system of
Training and support and all the
things that you mentioned, uh,
as far as accountability that
move that go beyond schools.
Um
But that's where our committee
landed on this particular
proposal.
Thank you. And Mr. Chair.
So we
You know, we try to judge every
student by reading and math.
And so when we're, when we're
talking about at, at risk kids.
Wouldn't anybody that is not up
to grade level, and we talked
about not being able to
evaluate, you know, each state
is a little bit different. I get
that, but reading level is
pretty much nationwide.
So when we get to the 3rd grade
level.
And we're not
We have somebody that's not up
to standards.
Up to the reading level, we'll
just stick with the reading, for
example.
At risk, is there any way we can
pull them out of the classrooms?
And give them, say it's 30
minutes.
Tutor type thing, inexpensively.
Not hiring a teacher just to do
that, but it isn't. Can't we do
something like that?
Mr. Chair and senator.
I think that was part of the
vision originally with extended
learning time and when you talk
with people from Mississippi who
did that retention strategy.
They actually retained students
and make them go to like a
summer school, and then they get
another chance after they've had
additional learning time to be
reassessed, and then there's a
sort of this progression of
intervention after that.
We as a state have given
schools.
The opportunity to opt in to
additional time and to leverage
more operational dollars to
create these programs locally.
Um, at their own discretion.
Um, there's not really aside
from the statute that Senator
Trujillo mentioned, um.
Enforcement of how
Advancement occurs, um, and I'm
not aware of any public
reporting on
On that process at at this
moment.
And Mr. Chair, just very quickly
I'll just add that that the
situation that you just
described probably happens every
day, and, and, and a lot of
school districts and charter
schools are already doing what
you just described.
And, and sometimes it is in
after school or tutoring and
sometimes it is in school when
you have a reading
interventionist.
Who, you know, through the
process that in the edge you
speak is the multi-layer systems
of support, where you identify
students who are struggling
either because they didn't do
well in a standardized test or
because this teacher just says
the student isn't doing well, we
need to help them.
Those things are already
happening.
Um
But to Sonny's point, there's
probably more we can do, and
both LFC and LESC are
recommending continued funding
of the
Uh, statewide summer literacy
Institute, which is intervention
ideally for students who need it
most, so that if they're
Not making or or not scoring
proficient at that time, over
the course of the summer ideally
they've come back and have
improved.
Right
This chair.
So we, we've tried almost
everything in the state of New
Mexico. I mean, I'm sure we
haven't tried everything.
Hopefully we'll come up with
that miracle.
Our own miracle.
But, you know, part of our
problem is like after school
programs is we can't get the
parent to buy it.
The parent doesn't want to.
Come and pick that student up
later or
Whatever.
So we've got to come up with
something else.
And, and I'm, I'm not sure I'm
in favor of lengthening
lengthening lengthening the day.
Because I still think there's a
lot of time in that school day
that that we could be.
Working on these at-risk kids on
a 1 to 1 basis.
Is it
You know, that when I was
teaching history, one of my
biggest scribes was anytime we
had an at-risk kid that was
gonna get a, you know, get
pulled out of class, or did they
take them from?
I always took him from PE and I
always took him from history.
Well I had a brilliant student
in history.
They didn't read very well. You
said, well, how is that
possible? History is reading.
No.
He, he was brilliant, and he
loved history. He just struggled
in exercises, assignments,
things like that.
They always wanted to pulled me
out of my, pull him out of my
class and I used to fight all
the time, no, take him, take him
out of something.
Different every week, whatever
it is, but the one thing the
student loves in this high
school right now is history, and
let's, let's not take him out of
that class.
So I don't know as a legislative
body if we need to, to put
something in there, um,
You know, maybe 15 minutes a day
and rotate the classes or
something. What, what would be
your recommendation.
Mr. Chair, Senator, oh.
We did pilot something a few
years ago where we said,
If you want to provide
additional
Out of school time is what they
would call it.
Um, you could generate
additional funding to do
tutoring or do some sort of
other extracurricular activities
mixed in so that you both had
students who may be needing more
intervention and students who
want to be taking advantage of
what the school has to offer.
Same simultaneously receiving
more time and that helps because
school schedules are.
Uh, pretty complex, as you're
probably well aware, I remember
when I was teaching that, you
know, you would always have
those athletes.
Get sent by their coach to their
teachers because they weren't
making the grade and, and that
really motivates certain
students, um, we have stopped
doing that appropriation and
that intervention, um, but it
was something that there was a
lot of interest from.
Districts to do so.
Uh, right now out of school time
is paid separately from.
The SCG and operational funding,
so.
You could ostensibly create a
program, but
Other than that, it would be
relegated to the local district
to create a program themselves
at this point.
Right, this here, um, I just, I
want to thank you gentlemen. I
know you worked very hard at
this, and if there was a a
billion dollar answer.
We would be on it right now. I,
I do appreciate everything that
you guys do, and I just ask, you
know, keep an open mind and
And
Sometimes it gets pretty tough
of what.
But people are complaining
about.
But I do, I think both of you
for your service as a school
teacher because it, it is a
service, it's very important.
And uh
It was the greatest job I ever
had.
And I retired and do this.
But thank both of you.
care.
Thank you, Senator, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Senator, what you're saying is
you were paid too much as a
teacher, so you thought you'd
come here. Great. OK. So
Directorina, um,
Do you have any kind of study
with our charter schools and
their outcomes because
everything I'm hearing is that
we have some really phenomenal
charter schools that are doing
some things differently, um,
maybe then the regular school
system schools and
Can we extrapolate like how many
at-risk students are at those
charter schools and what those
outcomes are and can we find any
commonality, any, any
determination at all that might
help us move the needle here.
Mr. Chair Senator's advice and,
um, so LESC has not done a
recent study on charter schools.
Um, I want to say the RAND
Corporation did one.
What it's credo out of Stanford.
That's right.
Um, in 2019, 2020, 21, maybe,
um, and found that the results
were mixed.
Um, some did a really great job,
some not as much even the the
assessments or the the
measurements they use.
Um
I don't know if you wanna
We, we're happy to follow up on
that.
Jones's right, Stanford's Credo,
um, group has done studies of
New Mexico charter schools was
really fascinating about their
study is that like,
They did 2 studies, recent
studies. The first one, which
was years ago.
found that charter schools
actually had about the same.
performance level as an
aggregate, as their traditional
district peers and that they
actually had fewer what we would
define as um at-risk students
and their population.
But then they updated their
study a few years later and
found that when you took out the
online charter schools out of
the equation.
Charter schools did better than
their um district peers on
traditional measures of math and
reading. So I think there's
something to be said about the
method of delivery.
That might be affecting their
performance and potentially some
demographic shifts too.
Mm
Thank you Mr. Chair, I, I would
just be interested to see like
how many at risk students are
actually at our current charter
schools, not online, I
understand that that's a whole
different demographic of student
potentially, but it just be
interesting to see, um, I think
the other thing that is a
commonality in what we heard in,
in another committee meeting is
that it's an assumption, maybe
that was the training. There's
an assumption that if mom or dad
are not literate that
One is an at-risk family and
that that child is going to have
a more difficult time at school,
especially learning to read, um,
and I found out since that, that
we are number one in adult
illiteracy. We've now surpassed
California, which to me that's
where we all care and lower,
lower education, higher
education, um, everyone here in
this room.
Maybe there needs to be some
kind of strategic plan that also
incorporates um mom and dad
somehow.
Because if they're not learning
at the same time that the
child's learning, we're gonna
constantly
To Senator Trujillo's comment,
um, Mr. Chair, Bowing all in
different directions, and if we
can move the whole family unit
at one time, maybe we would see
some different results.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Uh, Senator Woods, he walked in.
I don't know if you ever once
had an opportunity to say.
ask questions, do you have
anything that you wanna?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um,
they, I was hoping you'd fix
education before I got back over
here.
It
The, the questions, you know, I
have.
Will we ever
Find
The proper finish point for
this.
For some lofty goals.
But when will we draw the line
and say we've accomplished this.
In
this chair of.
Either one of y'all wanna.
chime in on that.
Mr. Chair, uh, Senator Woods,
um, we were almost there when
you got here, but hopefully
we'll get across the finish line
maybe here in a second.
I don't know, I mean, seriously,
Mr. Chair Senator, um,
At least as far as some of the
some of the core actions are
concerned, I think one thing
that may be missing from the
efforts that that you all have
made in the the agencies have
made local school districts have
made is uh
Doing exactly what you just
described is which is to
describe what those outcomes
are.
Because, um, I liken this sort
of to getting on a road trip
without knowing where you're
going.
And the road takes you all kinds
of places, but you never know
when you get there.
And, and we haven't actually
identified or defined in any
sort of comprehensive
collaborative way.
What that endpoint should look
like.
And so you're right, we have a
lot of lofty goals about.
It should
You reading and do math, and in
a state like New Mexico,
Uh, be bilingual or biliterate.
There are a lot of things that
we could be doing and to improve
education, but we haven't
identified specifically what it
looks like to be successful to
win. And so I think that's
actually something that the
legislature as well as the
executive uh could potentially
would be a very productive
exercise to do with school, with
local school districts and
charter schools.
So that we can all agree,
because part of this is not just
identifying when we but
agreeing.
What that looks like, because
without identifying that, it's
very easy to say from any.
One particular party standpoint
that we didn't get there.
And so we have to agree to on,
on what what success should look
like.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, um,
When I came into the
legislature.
So center of education.
And one of the first things I
heard was, you know, what we're
We're way down in the pack on
education.
In one of the first questions I
asked was
Why don't we go see who's number
one.
Amendment what they're doing.
And we've, we've, we've found a
lot of reasons we can't do that,
but it seemed like there's more
reasons we can't.
The actions that we could.
We keep blaming cultures.
Identifying subgroups.
Saying, well
We're not doing enough for a
subgroup.
But at some point we have to
take.
The median
And say, are we?
Are we moving above?
The media, are we, are we
educating every person.
To the highest of their ability
than rather teaching to the low
point.
And I've often wondered that. I
mean, it, it's hard when you've
got a, a student that that
doesn't show up, Mr. Chair.
That's we've got a real problem
with
With just absenteeism.
And we don't have.
We don't have anybody.
At this point, designated.
To go get those kids and bring
them in school.
And you know, I've had
superintendents tell me,
we are just have a tax credit
and anybody that has their kids
in the school.
98% of the time, we'll give them
a tax credit.
You know, uh, there's been all
kinds of ideas bounced around.
How do we get the kids to come
to school.
Because if we had them in
school, they'd have a chance to
learn.
And then we have the problem.
Of some kids.
all
doing all the work right here.
Take a picture of a math
problem.
Get out. It'll just tell you the
answer. He'll tell you how to do
it.
And the kid's mind is saying,
Why do I have to know how to do
it, Mister chair.
Oh you wants his answer.
So why in the world would I have
to waste my mind, my brain cells
on learning how to do it because
someone else is gonna do it for
me.
Or we.
In the mind.
So to speak of this generation.
Are we
In that position, Mr. Chair.
To figure out how these kids
learned today.
And how can we make it relevant
to them.
And the education that we think
is necessary.
I mean, if we're just talking.
Psychological type stuff, I
mean.
That don't even all that talk,
it don't help unless there's
action.
You know,
We're trying to create a, a, a
billion dollar trust fund for
behavioral health.
Did you
What exactly are we going to try
to do with that.
Because behavioral health is the
exact problems that's in our
school.
Not showing up
Not caring about an education.
On some of my travels, Mr.
Chair, we went to a
A country
It was turkey, and they was.
One school we went to.
But there was
100 kids in if if I remember it
right.
They had
Kids from all over Europe.
In the school.
They had
Like 100,000 kids that were
applying to go to this school.
And the ones that graduated out
of that school, I mean, they
did.
Hugely great things.
And we got to school in New
Mexico like that, Mr. Chair.
And we got a high school in New
Mexico.
That we can point out and say,
The school
It's number one.
The kids graduating out of the
school are doing great things.
Are we still just trying to
educate the masses.
In failing at that, I know, I
know these aren't the questions
that
That you want to hear from me,
Mr. Chair.
But
I think we're missing the point
here somehow.
We're not educating.
The present
Generation.
We're not clicking, we're not.
We're not regional.
Were we missing this?
don't have an answer.
Butchery.
I'm sorry, I didn't have any
good questions for you today.
I apologize. Sorry about being
tardy. I actually had two bills
and
In the
judiciary
And they finally told me it was
going to be another hour before
I got to Brazil, any of them.
Those lawyers, sir.
I don't know what to tell you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Senator. No, your
points are well taken.
Um, we'll try to just a few
minutes, just try to bring his.
But um, I was gonna mention and
I'm looking at this handout, the
one with um.
Hospital 63.
And uh in 1974.
When the t equalization.
Our funding was recognized
nationally.
As being one of the top.
Formulas for.
Distribution of funds on an
equal basis.
And then we have that um.
Uh, it has been modified more
than 80 times within the.
51 years.
So that's maybe like.
You look at it like 1. something
per year.
Now
The courts recognize any of
that. Here we had one of the
best.
And recognized, but also there's
been.
Modifications to the formula.
To really try to stay with up to
date, Mr. Chair, thank you for
the question. I think, um, so
two things, um, and again, most
of you already know this, but
I'll just say it for the for
the.
clarity is that the formula
itself is a distribution method.
And so whatever you put in is
what comes out.
Um, and the court, I think was
we don't do that. It comes by
need.
You know, when, when they tell
us, well, this is not working.
For this, this is when we look
at those modifying Mr. Chair,
just to clarify from, from my,
from my point.
Um
In terms of, uh, plenty as
you've had in the last few
years, you've been able to
appropriate
Increasing amounts to that
formula.
In times when you haven't had as
much money in the state has not
had as much money. You've had to
cut back on those formula. What
I mean by that is the formula
itself.
Doesn't necessarily dictate how
much money flows, it divides the
amount of money that the state
is able to appropriate to
schools. And so, um, what the
court did say was that those,
the inputs and the, the amounts
of money going into the formula.
Um
were insufficient. It didn't
necessarily, it did speak
specifically to to the at-risk
factor and called for that
at-risk factor to be increased
so that more funding would be
directed to students who
generated those at-risk units,
but I don't believe it spoke to
the, to the formula more
generally.
Um, Mr. Chair.
Just a brief history lesson back
in, you know, 50, 60s, 70s there
was.
Um, a lot of concern around the
nation around um equity.
Given that most states still
have a local um wealth approach
to funding their schools, New
Mexico was ahead of that and
changed their formula before
they got an equity lawsuit,
which you saw a huge wave of
lawsuits across all states on
their formulas being
inequitable.
What you saw in the 90s
following Nation at Risk and No
Child Left Behind is new
lawsuits saying
Funding is not adequate. So even
though we've shifted some of the
equity of your formula. Now the
amount is insufficient.
And we have not been immune to
that, so you, you saw with the
filing of the Martinez and Yazi
lawsuits that although our
Formula was seen as equitable.
half a century ago.
Uh, we have not avoided the
argument that the amount of
funding is inadequate. Um,
there's states who have been
under their adequacy lawsuit for
a quarter century at this point.
Um, the court has not yet, I
think.
Reviewed a lot of the state's
efforts since the 2019 order.
So I think it remains to be
seen.
Um, they're still using
Student outcomes as their litmus
test on whether or not we've
achieved a sufficiency at this
point.
OK.
Although I think my point is.
Saying we did come up with an in
formula.
But we made changes.
You know, through those 51
years.
You know, to try and address,
you know, the, I guess
modernization of
You know where it should be, um,
I have quite a few questions,
but I won't go into, I'll just
go more into a 1 to 1 with you
on.
And several of them.
But I still see a weakness, and
this is me.
And where I'm coming from is I
did 30 years in the public
schools, different capacities,
16 years in the education
committee. So I think I know
something, you know, and what
work, what doesn't work and some
of the changes that I that I see
through the years, I think um.
Senator Woods brought a very
good point.
Are we at the modern age of.
What we should be teaching today
or how.
You know, compared to what we
had 2030, 40 years ago.
Um, you know, that's a very good
point, but.
I still see.
A big weakness.
I need you just barely touched
on it.
Yes some school board training.
And parental.
Training.
Now
I know that it works because I
did it.
And if we were just to enhance
this two strands.
I think we would see big
differences.
You know, and at some time I can
spend more time and
But you know how I used to work
with that and uh.
You know, the results that I had
with it.
And uh but he does work but um.
Without perils.
It doesn't matter what level.
It mice.
part of the success.
You know, and school board
members, when you look at
The billions of dollars that
we're putting in.
Once it leaves us.
They're the ones that are
entrusted.
You know, with that funding.
And to go into those.
Decisions and very high
priority.
The other part is that um.
But um
I can't understand.
Any district or charter school.
It doesn't want to follow what
the direction from the public
education department is.
I mean, it's unheard of.
You know, and uh.
You know, that's why we have a
public education department, you
know, the leaders are providing
the regulations.
You know what, we should be
working with.
And, and if that's not happening
in any districts or any of the
charter schools.
There's definitely something
wrong.
And uh back in the days, you
know, like I was sharing this
with the with the governor.
Back in the days, I mean, you
did something like that.
And at that point, it was Harry
Walter who was in charge of
budget.
Very simple. You would just not
send your distribution for a
month.
And why did you see those
districts really.
Get in place and school board
members and everyone.
You know, it's.
You know, we have a job and.
With that, there's a
responsibility and there's
accountability.
You know, and uh
And uh
But you know
We have to do something, the the
last part that I'll bring in.
And uh you don't have to give me
an answer now unless you know it
off the top.
Me, what is our true ranking for
New Mexico.
And what is the ranking with our
surrounding neighbors.
neighboring states.
And if you can provide us with
that at a later date, you know,
that's, that would be fine.
But I want to thank you. I want
to thank both of you and we have
had some very good questions and
some.
Eloquent responses from our
members that
We need to keep tracking, you
know, we need to keep working
with it.
Thank you.
I read we have um.
Secretary Rodriguez and
OK
Hm
You know, uh, while they're
doing that, um, I just want to
mention to the members that um
We, we get a lot of things to
read and a lot of things to
study.
That are on the
You know, the, this was provided
to us, you know, and every year
it is the volume 12 and 3 from
the legislative, um.
Finance Committee.
And uh I finally finished volume
one, you know, now I get to
start looking at volume 2.
And I just want to compliment. I
think the staff did beyond an
excellent.
In preparing this, this has
everything.
Uh, members, if you go through
this and in our audience, if you
ever
I want to check out a copy to
this really gives you the real
foundation of
You know, what we have in our
state.
You know, and it's provided by
The legislative finance staff
and also the direction of our
directors.
Go ahead and start.
let me just ask you.
Um
How much time do you think it's
gonna take you?
I'm trying to balance the time
in fairness too.
We will, we will, uh,
our
OK.
And we have our members, OK,
very well. Go ahead.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, thank you so much for
your time today. Although I know
many of you, um, I still want to
introduce myself. I'm Stephanie
Rodriguez and I'm the cabinet
secretary of the New Mexico
Higher Education Department,
real quickly joining me as chief
of staff, Chief Financial
Officer Gerald Honey and then
director of academic affairs and
Policy, Mark Chisholm, and then
we have a special guest, Sarah
Pingle from the National Center
of Higher Education Management
Systems or ECHAMs who has been
assisting us in our higher.
Education sustainability study.
If you go to slide 2, you'll go
ahead and see that we'll be
running through a few things
today, the project itself,
requirements of the study, its
overall goals, and then of
course the project stages and
next steps that you can look
forward to.
And I now want to dive a little
bit about the study, but before
I do that, we haven't done a
deep dive on the higher
education base since 2012. And
this is the first time that
we're really going in and making
sure we have heard many times,
there's so many winners and
losers. How many times have you
been up in the governor's office
telling her that, and I'm
sitting right next to her. So
I've been charged by the
legislature and the governor to
really make sure we have an
equitable base and an equitable
process moving forward both with
the funding.
formula and research and public
service projects.
So in fiscal year 2023, next
slide, next two slides actually.
We, the higher education
department were charged with
doing a higher education
sustainability study focusing on
instruction in general, also
known as the higher education
funding formula and research in
public service projects known as
RPSPs.
Um, during the interim, we
developed a scope of work with
all stakeholders at the table to
really figure out what we are
going to look at, and then we
issued an RFP, the one that was
awarded the RFP is EEMS once
while they're, while they're
here with me today and meetings
for this has been taking place
with a technical committee since
May 2024.
Next slide.
I'm gonna go ahead and skip
this, Mr. Chair, for the sake of
time, you know it my department
does, and then I'm also going to
check if you want to go ahead
and go to the next slide. I'm
gonna skip NEMs because my
wonderful colleague Sarah will
talk about who they are.
And with that, I want to go
ahead and go to the major
requirements, which is my
colleague, Chief Financial
Officer Gerald Honey, who will
go through those.
Thank you Secretary. Uh thank
you, Mr. Chair and members of
the committee. Um, I wanna just
go through quickly the two
distinct components that were
part of this study, uh, when we
originally put the scope of work
together. The first component
actually addressed the
assessment of different types of
programs that are requested
through the RPSP process. Many
of you are familiar with the
RPSP process at the higher
education department. And so
this study and a portion of this
study was really concentrated.
on whether or not the
recommendations that were being
made for our PSPs, how the
appropriately funded those
different types of projects and
either whether, whether they
were either recurring or
non-recurring.
Uh, examples are in the RPSP
process we have
quasi-governmental entities,
also non-ING serving uh
statewide purposes, uh, RPSPs as
well that we go through.
The process for the RPSPs for
measuring how the programs
achieve their intended goals,
outcomes objectives and operate
within legislative intent was
also part of this, this, uh,
this portion of the evaluation
and then the process is for for
developing performance measures,
which are appropriate for each
program to measure the
attainment of goals, program
effectiveness, and measurable
outcomes.
We also wanted to assess the
process for rolling
formula-related projects into
the funding formula base, as you
all know last year, the
department did bring forward a
proposal in order to roll ING
projects into the base, and we
did that thanks to the support
from this committee and from the
legislature, uh, and that was
very successful and so that
piece is the first part of the
of the study.
The second piece of the study
really concentrates on
determining the base inequities
and recommendations on methods
to resolve for base funding for
all higher education
institutions. This would be
based on peer group analysis
that considers mission,
enrollment level, rural urban
settings, and of course student
characteristics.
Cost and revenue sources to peer
groups was also an expectation
within the scope of work that we
developed and understanding the
differing revenue options
available in different parts of
New Mexico and also from
institution to institution.
Cost sharing was a big component
in the scope of work of the, of
the funding formula study as
well.
And also we wanted to make sure
that we were doing a national
review of best practices. Uh,
that was important to the
department to ensure that we
were looking nationally at what
those standards were and how we
could incorporate them here in
New Mexico.
Understanding student at risk
performance measures,
inflationary cost adjustments
for sustainability measures for
transfer students, student
credit hours, and awards,
waiting mechanisms and
methodologies and matrices that
we disciplines and level of
study by their cost were also
part of the study, uh, and what
we intended when we put forth
the scope of work for the pro
for the project.
Next slide, please. So now we'll
talk a little bit about the
project goals and what
specifically was intended on the
project goals for the project.
Next slide
So one of the reasons why we
chose EEMs as part of the RFP
process is really their guiding
principles and values for the
work that they do that fill very
well into the requirements the
department had set up for this
RFP.
Our higher education
institutions are public assets
and this committee and the
legislature as a whole has been
very supportive of higher
education over the years.
The cost share between state
institutions and students makes
up the revenue streams to
support these assets, and the
balance between these revenues
was something that was very
important for us to look at as
we approach this study.
As we look at the at the slide,
Republic assets, you know, the
the some of the project goals
were to ensure that we were
including public assets as part
of the base funding for higher
ed institutions.
The funding itself, as I noted
earlier, right, there are
different funding streams that
are all deeply interconnected in
higher education, and those were
parts of of the study as well.
And then costs, what costs are
shared between the state and
higher education institutions.
This this means any analysis of
adequacy needs to also consider
the rule that tuition and
financial play together with
state appropriations and that we
also wanted to ensure that
The states and systems are, are
As part of this study that we
identified and addressed any
structural inequities among
institutions that are baked into
the base funding.
Institutions are all a means
toward a robust talent
development ecosystem for New
Mexico that prioritizes access
and completion for all New
Mexicans across the state. So
the work of the study was
intended to be an effective
lever for all of us as policy
makers to further move the
goalpost on how we assess
adequacy funding for higher
education. Now, Mr. Chair, with
that being said, I'd like to
turn it over to Miss Sarah
Pingle with Egems, uh, in order
to talk a little bit about their
role.
And the work that they've done
is NEMs with this project. Next
slide, please.
That's a pretty
Good afternoon. Thank you so
much to Secretary Rodriguez and
the Chiponi and to all of you
senators and committee members
and the chair for, for having us
here today and to check in on
the study.
Um, just a little bit about
Eche, so for the past 55 years
we've been supporting
institutions, systems in states
with doing this kind of work.
Um, specifically evaluating um
governance structures and
funding structures and making
sure that in in higher education
and ensuring that they're
aligned to the outcomes that New
Mexicans need to see from this
system and that all of you, you
know, are, are here to support
the system in achieving.
Um, we're really glad to be a
partner in this study as, you
know, the secretary and chief of
staff alluded to earlier. This
is really a once every, you
know, um, two decades study that
a state might undertake on its
higher education funding
formula, so this has the
potential to be incredibly
consequential for for New
Mexicans, for institutions and
and for this committee as well.
Um, not that many states do
really in depth studies of their
higher education funding
approaches, models and formulas.
And in fact, New Mexico is
joining only two other states in
using the approach that we're
using in this study, Illinois
and Missouri, and the approach
that we're using in this study
is really to center adequacy.
An adequate funding stands in
pretty stark contrast to the
approach that most states across
the country usually use to fund
higher education and the
approach that I would argue the
state uses now, which is
essentially looking back at the
last year and adjusting up or
down based on the economic
conditions of the state, but
without really calculating, OK,
what does it cost to provide
these services to New Mexicans.
What does it cost to keep these
institutions running efficiently
and productively for students.
By using this base plus approach
over time where you're
essentially looking at the last
year and either adding or
subtracting dollars, you really
lack intentionality and you risk
creating inequity between
institutions. And so it also
risks putting the state in a
position where their own assets,
whether that's physical
facilities, the curricula that
are offered by the institutions
and the overall health of the
state's talent development
pipeline might not be
sufficiently resourced for
success. And so doing this.
this type of study is really an
integral part of asking those
questions.
In the context of this study
were operationalizing adequate
funding as the minimum amount of
funding that institutions would
need to meet baseline
administrative expenses to
maintain their facilities and
technology.
To meet personnel expenses to
serve their student population
and meet key state performance
and capacity objectives.
And so we're using an approach
in this study that estimates all
of these necessary funding
amounts for each New Mexico
public institution.
In doing this, I said earlier,
New Mexico is really only the
3rd state to join this group of
states that have done this type
of calculation on the higher
education side.
Um, we recognize that that means
there's not a lot of industry
standards out there for how to
do this work, right? And even if
there were, we wouldn't want to
take a cookie cutter approach
and assume that it would also
work in New Mexico.
And so a lot of the work that
we've done on this study so far
is working with some of the key
stakeholders that the secretary
and chief of staff and CFO just
mentioned around, you know, how
do we want to measure these
things for New Mexico? How does
it make sense to measure them?
And then how does that translate
into funding needs and spending
capacity from the state, from
students through tuition and
where applicable from local
communities for community
colleges and branch campuses.
And so we really look forward to
more engagement with all of
those stakeholders.
It's been productive so far, um,
and we'll continue in the, in
the, the weeks ahead.
Really quickly on the next
slide, I just wanna talk very
quickly, as I said, you know,
Mr. Chair, we're, we're keeping
this quick, um, about the
components that exist within the
formula, right? So the first
major component is fixed costs.
This is the baseline
administrative expenses that it
would take to run an institution
of higher education, we measure
this not just by looking at the
individual institution of
interest, but also looking at a
peer set of institutions that
are similar to that institution
across the country.
So we're trying to benchmark in
a way, OK, here's what you
spend, here's what other
institutions like you spend to
ensure that we have that
productivity and efficiency
built into the model.
We also um calculate um variable
costs. So these are costs that
would vary for each institution
depending on how many students
they're serving, what types of
academic programs, they're
serving them with.
And the characteristics of
individual students as well. How
much does it cost to serve all
all New Mexicans really well, so
those are the variable cost
components that are added in. It
was incredibly important to us
from the start to maintain a
focus on performance, right? Are
the institutions, our students
within these institutions
completing degrees, are they
successful in the workforce? Are
they moving forward and
persisting. These are all key
functions of any state's public
higher education system, and we
want to make sure that the
funding incentives behind that.
really aligned within the
formula.
Also we have funding built in
for capacity building. This is
things like starting new
academic programs or innovating
in certain areas. We want to
make sure that the state is able
to adequately support innovation
and transformation across the
institutions where it's needed,
which it always is, right?
Things are always changing.
And then finally there's a
component for mission-related
activities. So making sure that
we're covering non-instructional
institutional costs for things
that may be largely, largely or
partially self-supporting.
Um, those are the main
components that we kind of stack
up within this formula, as you
can imagine, there's reams of
spreadsheets below that, um, but
really at the conceptual level,
I think this is really the most
effective way for us to talk
about it today. So those are the
main components, and I'll pass
it back over to my colleagues
from the department, and I think
we're happy to answer any
questions about any of that as
well.
Thank you.
Thank you, Sarah. Mr. Chair,
we'll go on to the next slide.
On the next slide, we really
want to talk about the stages of
how we developed this work. So
as I noted earlier, we did start
out with the issuance of an RFP.
Um, and then, of course, as
Sarah noted uh in her
discussion, you know, the
department did make it a point
to ensure full transparency and
stakeholder engagement in the
study. That was extremely
important for us to ensure that
that was possible. To do this,
we developed a framework for
information gathering and
sharing that included the use of
our existing funding formula
technical committee, so as
we've, as you all know, uh, the
department is responsible for
creating a funding formula each
year, and we have
A funding formula technical
committee that actually uh that
we convene every year in order
to discuss the funding formula.
That same committee was utilized
in the preparation and the work
that we have done thus far as it
relates to this study as well.
These individuals are all well
versed in higher education in
our existing higher education
funding formula, and they
represent each of the sectors.
Uh, I want to make sure to note
that it represents the, the
higher education associations,
as well as representatives from
the Department of Finance and
Administration at LFC as well as
a member from each one of the
sectors of higher ed.
This work group was heavily
involved in the study and
instrumental in gathering
feedback from their sectors as
the work on the study continued.
We also wanted to make sure that
we brought forward the chief
financial officers as part of
this study, because a lot of the
work that is included in this
study involves data uh and uh
data related to the financials
for each of the institutions. So
the CFOs were an extremely
important stakeholder in the
study as well, and the major
components of the study which
involve financial data was, was
important for us to bring them
together.
We also wanted to ensure that
the chancellors and the
presidents were also engaged, as
we moved along with this study.
So now let's go into the
specific stages of the study. On
the next slide.
So stage one of the study, uh,
the project was launched in May
of 2024 and included a project
initiation visit with NES, the
department, as well as the
funding formula or group.
Um, and that, that initial
meeting was to in in order to
gather information on what was
going to be expected for this
study.
Um, on, um, on May the
twenty-ninth, there was a
planned meeting to approach how
the study and the committee
expectations were going to be
provided and then a deep dive
was completed by inches on the
current funding model and the
processes currently used for the
funding of our PSPs.
Stage 2. This stage involved use
of the data retrieved from the
NMHED as well as feedback from
the funding formula work group
to develop a conceptual adequacy
model and peer lists for each
institution.
This uh conceptual adequacy
model as well as the peer lists
were shared with the funding
formula technical Committee, and
then that committee also
garnered feedback from all of
the institutions in order to, to
refine that peer group and make
sure that we, that we had all of
the information necessary, um,
and feedback necessary.
For stage 3, the department
hosted separate meetings with
each of the HEI CFOs, research
and Bran's presidents,
Chancellors.
And in and in comprehensive
institution presidents as well
as independent community college
presidents, all of these
meetings were designed to gather
feedback and to ensure that
everybody was aware of what the
conceptual modeling was looking
like.
For these meetings, we gathered
a total of 37 responses from the
stakeholders, and we actually
took that information and we
looked at it carefully and
strategically in order to see
how that feedback would
potentially deal uh address any
changes that we may need to make
in the model.
I want to just note that out of
those 37 responses, we did take
15 of those responses, and we
incorporated them into uh the
conceptual model. And then we
also are reviewing other
responses that have come in in
order to see what those look
like moving forward.
Next slide.
So where are we now? So we've
done a lot of work, uh, again
with all of our stakeholders
with hams in getting us to the
point that we are today.
The other piece that was
extremely important as we had
mentioned earlier, was the
validation of the data that is
being used in the model, and
that's the current stage that
we're at.
We are currently validating all
of the information that is being
utilized in the data in the
model that that information is
being shared with higher
education institutions, so that
way they can again cross
reference and validate what we
are placing into the model to
ensure that there are no
questions about the information
uh that that is that is
currently used.
Next slide.
So now I'll turn it over to
secretary for next steps. Mr.
Chair, we are almost done a pro
promise. There is still work to
do, but we're almost at the
finish line and we're gonna get
ready to go legislative, the
next legislative session with
adjustments to the current
funding formula or moving into
this new model. So that's
something that we will discuss
in the interim. Go ahead and go
to the next slide. There are 4
components of next steps. My
colleague did touch on some of
them. But that includes that
data validation in putting
that into the model, finalizing
the performance metrics and then
review and publishing the
report.
We plan on validating the data
and having internal meetings
with the technical committee
this February and finishing it
up the end of February. In March
will be reviewing the
performance metrics and some of
the research and public service
projects and by the April, we
will have the full report ready
to publish and review with the
legislature, the executive
branch of government, and then
of course during this whole time
of February, March, we're
already going to be engaging the
higher education institutions,
so they
there will be no surprises when
the report is published, and
everybody can look at that and
then get ready for the next
legislative session.
And with that Mr. Chair.
Next slide.
And next slide. I'm really bad
at this new strategy, or this
new thing, Mr. Chair, so I
apologize. I'll go ahead and
turn it over to the committee
for questions.
Thank you. Thank you very much,
uh, members.
Steinborne. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Madam Secretary,
presenters, one question and I
apologize if you said this
before when I was out.
What do we, are there any high
level things that you expect to
change? What are the shifts,
potential shifts.
That we could see.
In this study that will be
recommended to the legislature.
So Mr. Chair Senator Steinborn,
thank you for the question.
You know, I think that that as
we were discussing uh the
initial uh in the initial slides
for the model. I think the
biggest shift is just looking at
this holistically at the base
funding for all higher education
institutions, that's a shift
that we have not done, um, uh,
here at the department, uh, in,
in, I don't think ever actually.
And so, so the, so the largest
shift is going from just looking
at base plus model, uh, to, to
actually look.
at how we address the base for
each institution as a whole.
Uh, and that's, that's really
the, the, the largest shift that
that this study is going to
address and show.
Look forward to it. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you.
Vice chair.
Go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm born.
I would just offer one of the
major shifts in doing this kind
of work that we've seen in other
states as you're shifting your
mindset from allocation to
adequacy.
So your current model right now
asks how much money does the
state have to spend on higher
education, and then the
department goes through a
process through a formula of
determining what piece of that
pie each institution would
receive.
What you'll see in this study is
a definition of what it would
cost to run the system of higher
education at a very minimum
level, and then that may enable
further decision making about
what the appropriations and
then.
to chair it just raises the
intrigue level.
I mean, it is helpful, but um,
you know, we say what it costs
to do it, I mean, we're doing it
right now.
So, I, I mean, what does that
mean, you know what it costs to
do it, I mean.
Are we looking at teacher
salaries, we look in it, yeah,
so I mean, I just, it's, it's
intriguing, right? I mean, it
depends what it is you're really
looking at cause, cause
everything sounds like is on the
table, but, you know, what is it
that you're, what's the goal of
the research and again that on
me. I wasn't here when you
probably said those sentences,
but
Um
Anyway, so yeah, I'm not.
Not really sure, but um.
Thank you, it's intriguing, like
I said.
Mr. Chair. Thank you.
Thank you all, Senator for you.
Thank you and thank you for the
presentation. This is a really
exciting study and um I
appreciate the detailed
information, Mr. Chair, the
detailed information going
forward. Um, it just, you just
perked my interest because you
didn't have any questions but um
if we move to that like
institutional needs to do what
they're doing, there's still a
limited amount of money, like we
don't have unlimited amounts of
funding that we can provide to
higher, higher education, um,
will there be some recommend
uh, Madam Secretary, as to how
we can get to that so that we're
teaching uh we'll just say what
Senator Woods said, we're not
just teaching to the mass to do
it, but we're teaching to what
the state needs and what our
students need to move forward.
Thank you.
Mr. Chair, Senator, that's a
fantastic point. So when we went
out to do this study, the
legislature was really clear how
much do you need as higher
education institutions to keep
the doors open. At the time, it
was a couple years ago you had
institutions coming to your
doors, uh, knocking and saying,
I'm not funded at the level I
want. I'm not funded or the
level I need. I'm not funded at
the level I need and so you put
it in our hands to say, well, is
that
The fact. And can you do that
for us? So the study is that
adequacy point. However, in the
interim, with the technical
committee, the higher education
leaders, we will talk about, all
right, so this is how much money
we know and we estimate that the
state has.
How can we work with the
institutions to make sure that
we're not overspending. So
you'll have the adequacy model
to show you, yes, they need this
much to have the doors open, but
there will be political levers
that we can pull to ensure that
we're not going over and
spending $5 billion.
Center.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Welcome. I'm sorry, um, I missed
part of your first of the
presentation there too.
So
If we, if we
You were here for part of the
last session that we were
talking to public education and
it was about graduation.
Um
Rates and things like that.
As a higher education, are we
keeping those students in what,
what's our graduation rate?
At the, at that level, at your
level.
Mr. Chair members of the
committee, the the graduation
rate of or completion rate, I
should say of New Mexico, um,
nationally is ranked at 49.
However, since 2018, New Mexico
has uh made sure that over
170,000 New Mexicans have
completed credentials ranging
from certificates to graduate
level degrees in the state of
New Mexico and since the passage
of the Opportunity scholarship
that has increased the last two
years.
And Mister Chair soul.
What programs do you have trying
to retain those students to get
them all the way to the finish
line.
Mr. Chair members of the
committee are institutions are
independent go they have
independent governing boards and
have different ways that they
manage retention, but there is a
uniform agreement that student
success needs to be the center
of the work.
And we fund that through the
funding formula, making sure
that they have counselors,
advisors, they have services on
their campuses so that they can
get to the finish line, a really
fantastic model that a lot of
the higher education
institutions have done is called
the one stop shop. So COVID
taught us, we're not doing
things the way we should be
doing and all systems of
education and during that time
we started doing remote work
with our students, and when a
student had an issue instead of
making him walk to another
building remotely you could
just transfer them into the
person that they could help
them. So you'll see at Central
New Mexico Community College,
Dona Ana Community College.
Those are the ones I have I have
visited schools, so don't get
upset with me, but there's many
others. They have a one stop
shop now, so the student walks
in, they have a financial aid
question, they go to that person
and
counselor will actually come
over to that table. They won't
walk anywhere else to support
them and get them to the finish
line. The other thing that we've
been doing is making sure
there's a management system that
we use so students can see and
track their progress through
higher education. So how many
credits do I need to complete if
I'm doing an engineering degree,
what types of courses do I need
to take? There's been a lot more
focus in that, um, I would say
since 2015 in the higher
education system and we've
really developed those systems
and they're pretty advanced now
for a student.
Well, thank you. That's all I
have.
Thank you, Senator Campos. Uh,
thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Just uh quickly as we talk about
the RPSPs and we incorporated
that moving along in terms of
the definition for adequacy, uh,
hope that we're able to uh
further define that as we, we
deal with this. The second part
of that, uh, we start talking
about the Echem study. I know
that uh New Mexico Tech.
I had one of those studies and
in theirs, it was indicated that
they needed an additional 7.2
million for the base.
So again, the question would be,
and not to predetermine any of
the, the findings.
What
Estimate does it look like we're
gonna be headed towards in order
to satisfy, if you will, the
institutions, the adequacy.
And more importantly to uh help
to keep up, if you will, with
the pace of the resources that
are definitely going to be
needed as we move forward.
Mr. Chair, Senator Campos, thank
you for that question. You know,
as, as we, as we noted in the
presentation, there are a lot of
factors that are being taken
into consideration in this
adequacy model.
Um, you know, um, as, uh,
We do have information that can
that that provides the
definition of what adequacy
means for this particular model.
Uh, and we can provide that
information to this committee.
To your second question on the
dollar amount, um, so we don't
have at this moment a dollar
amount, and the reason why that
is, that is not the case is
because we're still going
through the conceptual model.
That conceptual model allows us
an opportunity to do several
things. The first is we're
validating the data and
information that is being
utilized in the model. So until
that data is validated, we, we,
we, we have conceptual numbers,
but we don't have any uh uh
finalized numbers. The second
piece is there are, and it's
important to note this, there
are different levers within the
model that allow an opportunity
for, for, uh, for adjustment.
Those levers within
in that model um also give uh
give opportunities as the
secretary mentioned before, uh,
for, uh, for policymakers in
order to make decisions and so,
so it's important to note that
it's not just as easy as just a
dollar. There are levers within
that model that allow
opportunities. The other
component that I'd like to note
is, you know, the performance
piece of it will be a portion of
this study and the output of
this study.
But the majority of it is really
going to be concentrated on base
funding for institutions based
funding to maintain operations
to keep the doors open for the,
you know, uh, uh, for each of
our higher ed institutions. Then
from there, we talk about
performance measures on top of
that, uh, but I hope that
answers the question, Senator,
Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair and thank
you very much for the response.
Uh, it, it does, but it also
triggers something else as we
design.
you will, the, uh, RPSP if we're
gonna be taking a look, let's
say for example, at providing uh
veteran services throughout the
state and we start looking at
how we're going to tie in some
of these uh issues for a a a
base model in in that course
alone, I think we're probably
going to be talking about at
least $5 billion needed for
in order to go and start to
provide services, so it all goes
back to the definition of the
adequacy and then from there how
we're going to incorporate these
other aspects that are going to
be necessary to provide higher
ed in the services needed.
So, so just if you could, Mr.
Chair, just elaborate a little
bit more in terms of
What, what this is looking like
as you continue to go ahead and
work towards the scope and
sequence of what some of the uh
the final pieces would, would
look like, and I don't, I don't
know, maybe uh the expert would
like to go and comment in terms
of that because I'm, I'm curious
in terms of how we're gonna get
to the RPSP portion that is
going to tie in all of these
additional needs that people
continue to indicate are
important, if you will, for
higher education in New Mexico.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Senator for the follow-up
question. Uh, you, you bring up
a very good point and I think
what's what I, what I want to
also reemphasize is, is that,
uh, you know, as I noted early
on in the presentation, there
are two distinct areas for this
study. One is a review of the
RPSPs and then the second is
review of base funding as the
adequacy or adequacy modeling
for the base funding and so
there is not a direct
correlation or.
high currently within the study
that that ties RPSPs to the
base.
Um, it RPSPs are the standalone
research and public service
request project requests that
come through the department. And
what we've asked NEMS to do as
it relates to our PSPs is to
number one, look at the process
that that the department did
last year, which is to roll our
uh INGR PSPs into the base,
that's the one component and
then the second is to look at
our PSPs as a whole and to and
to give us uh
recommendations on how these
types of appropriations are
managed or or funded uh in, in
other states nationally. So that
way we can have a opportunity to
look at RPSPs and have um and
have ways in which we can
improve or streamline those
processes for how we fund our
PSBs. Thank you very much and
just in closing, Mr. Chair, I
would indicate again the concern
is with the RPS.
beasts. Here we're talking about
possibly non-recurring or maybe
uh a 1 or 2 year study, or if
you will implementation of a
project, now we've rolled it in,
if you will, to the ING, it
becomes part of the recurring,
so the base itself then will
continue to grow, and that's
going to be part of what we
really need to look at as the
final pieces of not only the
study but what the
recommendations will be in the
future. Thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman.
Mm.
Moisture.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh,
just a quick question. Uh, thank
you for the presentation. Uh.
This study is looking at two
distinct components, which is
the R.
RPSPs and the instructional
general and I was just curious.
I know that um at least the
large universities have their
own endowed fund that also have
endowments for various.
Uh, faculty or programs or
scholarships or whatever that
may be, um, I don't know how big
a component that is is part of
the, is that something that will
be looked at as well, uh, just
give us a full picture, uh, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Chair, um, no, endowments
are not part of the
sustainability study, only the
instruction in general base and
research and public service
projects. OK, is it, uh, was
there
What was the rationale behind
that? I mean, I know that I
think I know the answer, but I
want you to say that,
um, when the language is written
into HB2, uh, a couple years
ago, it was very distinctive
that there were two components
of the study, and those were the
two components listed out in the
language in HB2, and I can pull
that language and make sure you
have it, uh, after this
committee as well. OK, I
appreciate that. Thank you.
Thank you, Vice Chair for a 2nd
time, Senator Steinberg.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, so I
have to just bring up an issue
that just dawns on me is, is
kind of an important element if
we're really looking at
Um, adequacy, performance of
higher education, we have to
look at governance.
At the top, and I would.
You know
We've got some really good
proposals in front of the
legislature now to deal with
nominating commissions to make
sure we're, you know, creating
the widest possible interview
process for people who run our
universities, as you said, Madam
Secretary, you know, these
decisions we can appropriate the
money, but to a very good
question from my new colleague
over there about what do we do
to retain students? He said,
well, these are decisions made
at the local level. A lot of
decisions were made at the local
level.
And yeah
We don't really have
A robust process for selecting
these leaders and um and we have
some really good ones. I'm not,
and I've said this about, you
know, Governor Michelle Lujan
Grisham. She is treated this
decision with more care than
I've seen previous governors
about who we select and.
Even doing some interviews, but
too often and they're not
treated that way and um
And so I think that's an
adequacy on a leadership level
that we also deserve.
What is, what are, what's the
input there to make sure that we
have
The best group of people making
decisions, not just
They have right backgrounds but
also thinking about the future
technology. Some of the
questions in the previous
discussion. How are we training
to the future? I mean, it just
Because it is a changing
environment, as we said, and so
it's a dynamic environment, so
I would, you know, I don't know
what's gonna get done this
session, but I would hope that
your study really looks at that,
because that's part of adequacy.
As part of getting the right
result.
I just we throw more money but
we ignore that part of it.
And training. So, uh, I just had
to
To, um, speak to that because
that's a huge missing thing if
we're not really looking at
that.
Especially since, you know,
we're going to have a new
governor a couple of years and
we'll of course just in the
course of things have a whole
new set of regions, a whole new
set of leaders.
So anyway, it's a big
opportunity to.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Senator, or did you want to
respond? No?
Miss Mr. Chair, Senator, would
you like me to respond to that?
I'd be more than happy to. Um,
you're right, so independent
governing boards and higher
education, I will say, and you
and I had a fantastic
conversation about this, um, the
higher education department has
been training our new and
reappointed regents. And we've
been doing that to talk about
fiduciary responsibilities,
including the funding formula
and several other things that
they have to look at, manage
what type of questions to ask to
ensure that they're being good
stewards of public dollars. As
far as
This, the leadership in this
room and the leadership of the
higher education department are
actually the leaders who get to
make decisions for ING funding,
which is really exciting because
if we put that in their hands,
we don't know where that's gonna
go, you know, there's no um
reporting such as open books,
but there is reporting to the
doc uh the department, and so,
but it's not at the same level
as the public education
department. So as far as
leadership is concerned, we are
taking the lead on this and then
we're giving the information to
the regents.
so that they can make decisions
at their level on how ING is
spent, but at least we're
putting performance. We're
putting the right data. We're
looking at metrics that are
making sure that the
institutions can keep the doors
open in this. I know I didn't
answer your question the way you
probably wanted to, Mr. Chair,
um, but we are paying attention
to your bills and we do think
governance is incredibly
important, but also
understanding the role of our
department versus the role of
regents is something we have to
also navigate.
Thank you, Madam Secretary, and
if I may, Mr. Chair, you know,
the University of
Of uh
Gosh.
Wyoming State University or no,
I'm messing that there was there
was a study that said quite a
while ago, looking at Regent
systems and they looked at
outcomes and they found that the
top performing schools in the
country had
Regent qualifications or writing
processes, the lowest performing
ones had none.
We have none, and uh one of our
schools was included in that,
but that looks at a variety of
metrics, so
I, I hear you, but, um, I think.
It's just, you know, it's just
what we would do for any
important job in the world,
right?
That we're saying we should also
do this for these folks who are
Really managing these
institutions. So,
And I appreciate the new
training, I, I.
My feedback is it's been
voluntary and not, not everyone
even knew about it and I, it's a
good start though. I commend you
for that, and I think we can do
what we did for K through 12
schools.
Um, and we can make it
mandatory.
in uniform.
So.
At any rate, thank you, Madam
Secretary. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Very well, anyone else?
With that, we just want to thank
you. Thank you very much.
And uh members just a reminder
that um the chairman starting
tomorrow.
starting at 9.
9 and 1:30.
Yep.
No
OK.
Thank you to everyone that's
here in the audience.
