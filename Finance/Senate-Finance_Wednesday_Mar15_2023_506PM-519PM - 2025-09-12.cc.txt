Tax policy director and we've
been working on this issue with
all the tax policy wonks we're
doing right here.
Is exactly what all the other
states that joined us last year
for currently doing their
changing it from an exemption to
a credit Colorado just that this
and so that's all we're doing
this is really a of a way to
make we passed last year
actually work.
and so that it's a house or
small businesses.
deduct the entire amount of the
state local taxes for the
federal return purposes so it's
a big benefit to them with that
happy to answer any questions.

Thank you Mr chairman of this is
house bill two thirty four to
thirty four of the Senate
sponsor on this bill along with
the Representative Matthews I'm
joined by Sean Sullivan of the
attorney general's office David
Martinez senior policy adviser
for the City of Albuquerque and
of course rob black.
The CEO of a of a New Mexico
chamber of commerce this this is
the retail theft bill that that
that we've been working on the
last two three years you madam
up lifting it creates the crime
of aggravated shoplifting and
increase the crime of organized
retail crime to really crack
down and give police and dust
and judges the tools to crack
down on those who steal for the
purpose of reselling stolen
merchandise but also a peculiar
effect on the Google just system
that leads to efficiencies Mr
chairman elite proficiencies at
the DA's office and the public
defender apartment because it
allows prosecutors to
consolidate different acts so if
somebody
Through a pattern and practice
of sitting chainsaws does it
four five times you can
consolidate those acts into one
indictment instead of having
four five indictments or
complaints in metro court and
then with regards to organized
retail crime it gives
prosecutors the the ability to
to essentially charge co
conspirators
throughout the chain of of the
of the group the persons that
that steal the persons that
fence or or gather those stolen
merchandise and then those who
who who sell it for a retail in
the underground market so I
think
I think the efficiencies
outweighs any costs there may be
a slight cost with regards to
increased incarceration
but that wouldn't be felt for
the two three years and we could
take a look at that but I think
it would cut down on of police
jail guards and and everything
else and we appreciate it thank
you very much hello do that.
The.
The other Mr chair.

Mexico tech for geothermal.
Among other things.
Such a based on the other thing
quick.
it
it defines let's.
We get the bill of.
The fact that of conjecture.
So it I think the primary
mission of this bill is in fact
to create a center of excellence
but it also tasks the energy
minerals and natural resources
department to us specifically
apply to the federal government
for some of the federal funded
federal level to be applied for
geothermal applications in the

It makes it makes distributions
it doesn't make the
appropriations chair thanks to

it back into the fund itself Mr
