Money.
We can get.
Thank you.
The other Mike is live Senator
your committee and health.
This was the other one.
Yeah.
Very well Mr chairman and
members of house memorial of
thirty.
And the.
Mr chairman members so this is
something that has been.
The discussion for a few years.
And the basically.
it started with all the time
with the.
With the the interest with the
senator Tom Udall.
And and what it is is just
looking at the expenditures of
school districts the US there's
an increase.
The administrative cost.
Is that the same level of what
goes to the classroom.
And within this so Mister
chairman we find that there's at
least like nine districts that
you know our way over.
And the it might be a discussion
with the.
Cabinet secretary Kurt Steinhaus
he system.
He really doesn't know flying
you know it may be it is
justifiable that maybe it's a
time that for the department of
that they might have to make an
adjustments on their coding how
the code faster administration.
So this is what this memorial
would do and it would give the
the LFC and an opportunity to
look at this.
Thank you
regard zoom I guess I'm anybody
in support of the moral.
Anybody in opposition.
Anybody in committee and support
the more anybody in opposition
questions from committee
members.
Two
schools that are way over wait
wait over what admin costs are
when you take a comparison you
know like say ill to start in
state with the base say like go
year two thousand.
When you look at how much their
administrative cost has gone
compared to what goes to the
actual classrooms you know
summer way over in the then
there was some discussion
because
You know from a specially from
the cabinet because he says will
work we just have to find out
why.
And this is what it would do so
if the study comes back you know
and I don't know if we were
going to actually something for
to replace it to going to
introduce something that would
be in statute.
That another words if there's a
growth state off like point four
you should be point four and not
over exceed.
Mr chairman and this PED give
our schools now a target
percentage rate for admin costs.
Will.
It never really has been defined
but you know who and when you
see like one districts over by
two hundred percent that's a big
flying.
You know and you know so this is
what this would do and in all
fairness you know I think it's
good for both sides.
Mr Chairman seems long overdue I
would agree thank you.
You sent me the FIR so center.
I just want to.
Chair of all and I was wondering
whether this was a proportional
type of situation where a very
large school district is a pro
is Administration proportional
to the classroom experience
that's what you're trying to to
figure out if it's trying to
make it a of.
You know some.
Very small districts
specifically and it requires a
lot of the administration to be
done personally in a big school
district they've got a large
staff to do the administration
works so you're just trying to
balance it such that it's
proportional to the.
Classroom students Mr Chairman
note to their budget and the it
would not it would not affect no
in the districts that are
thousand and below the rules
with.
So it would be pretty much more
to the mid sized to the higher
and.
Because what you're saying is
correct the superintendent might
be the this this Madam You might
have three hats in the district.
Okay that that specifically work
with the way I understood you is
talking about doing it because I
agree with you sometimes it it
looks like the overhead is huge
in some of these District one we
really want to put the money in
the classroom.
And that that's where the rubber
meets road so to speak and
We also you know we're just
trying to to funded teachers so
more money so that they will
they will be able to.
The.
Six more responsibilities to do
the work through our step.
In two three fiscal.
So
I'm in agreement with you that
we need to.
The study would be worthwhile.
Mr chair thank you very much.
Thank you any other questions
from committee three nine months
of pleasure the committee.
Yeah would you passed by.
Second by Senator Steinborn.
Any objection to the do passed
motion.
There Burke.
No.
No I'm not voting no I have no
objection okay.
No means no
this is.
Senator Stewart will because of.
Thank you
Senator Gonzales we're gonna do
House Bill fifteen.
Madam caucus chair.
Which might do I use that one's
life so you don't have to use
the money of yours right we're
hands free to all right.
Good morning chairman and
committee members.
Representative morning.
Going to proceed with you on
this plane House Bill fifteen as
a means to us very good thank
you chairman I introduced
legislation last year and this
year was introduced on the house
side by Representative Georgene
Louis and I'm pleased to
sponsored in the Senate again.
This bill advocates for New
Mexico tribal problems and
nations to have cooperative
agreements with the New Mexico
taxation and revenue department.
To collect gross receipts tax
that they're right all right
substantially similar to the
gross receipts tax imposed by
the gross receipts in
compensation tax rate.
Why do we have where we
proposing this change in
statute.
It's because of the chairman and
committee members pursuant to
cooperative agreements with
Indian tribal governments in New
Mexico The New Mexico TRD
collects tribal G. R. T. on
transactions on tribal lands.
And we miss the collected taxes
to the tribal governments.
The present definition of a
qualifying tax does not allow
Indian tribes in more than one
county or with the municipality
within their lands to have a
uniform tax rate and still have
a cooperative agreement with the
tax.
And Revenue Department.
It does not allow.
Indian tribes to set their own
tax policy or tax rates
depending upon the needs of the
community.
And this is a impaired
Very important chairman and
committee members because tribal
nations pueblos they do not
collect property tax and so
taxes that they get through G.
R. T. is incredibly important to
take care of the needs of their
municipalities their problems.
So it's it's because of this
that there are tribal
cooperative agreements between
some tribes and the taxation and
revenue department.
For example chairman and
committee members the pueblo
back in was G. R. T. is eight
percent.
But they cannot collect that
status correct that right
because of the statute so for
instance I pulled up the G. R.
T..
Tax right on the website and it
still reads six point eight one
two five percent but that's
because of the statute they
can't raise it to what it really
is which is eight percent.
And so that is the reason for
the the rationale for the change
Mr chairman and committee
members and also the legislation
this legislation was originally
recommended by the New Mexico
taxation and revenue department.
And with that chairman and
committee I am joined by a
subject matter expert agency and
Rogers an attorney for the Acura
Pablo may I introduce her to you
and the committee.
Okay great there she is good
morning and Rodgers is there
anything that you would like to
add to the presentation.
That.
We have always been harms of not
thank you the other communities
around us and originally we were
only seeking maintenance we
could have a tax return then the
you the.
The political division where the
driveway I would locate.
New Mexico taxation and revenue
efficiency in the hi are
suggested she packs from
completely so there was no need
to refer to the
tax the local the local
government entities.
This is incredibly important we.
To the Representative is the
counties I specifically talked
to use the internet for CD
records management practices
you for Linxia.
Programs as well
as to Representative the
statewide association.
We want to work with governance
is very important for us to not
harmed in any way or take action
I think we reform that.
This is particularly important
at this time because the last
actually over here now the.
For the tribes has been
really.
It is close their businesses.
Use the revenue from for tribal
programs and community the same
time those needs have grown
exponentially because it.
So those are the facts as I
think you need to do right away
and answered questions
committee.
Thank you we're gonna go to zoom
in.
Or and we're started time caught
so we can get through this.
All right you know.
Why do not.
The committee my name is Tom
ridge you know and I and the
rest of this month houses here
for support this legislation
just a couple quick points Mr
chairman.
As mentioned tribal governments
have very limited revenue
generating options.
In rural areas and they can fax
a common lands tax personal
income but they can't tax the
delivery services.
And so what this legislation.
Will do is allow tribes she's
receipts tax rate and allow the
state to collectible so the man
known as the tax and just also.
Mentions is tribe's future
funds will be to delivery
services.
this legislation.
Increase.
hostilities
Will.
full publication for those
resources gentleman support of
a.
Thank you.
Thank you initially the.
This not will go to the audience
in support.
In opposition see none of
questions from committee
members.
There's going okay thank you
the.
One of.
The question is that the FY are
talks about how tribal
governments have the authority
to raise around gross receipts
tax so just curious just for my
education why do we need to pass
a law that allows them to raise
their gross receipts tax.
If I put that the right with
this I think requests for that
time thank you.
Committee member of Steinborn
the reason for this is that yes
tribes can.
At any time.
One of the one.
Is that New Mexico and tribes
have a long history of working
together on taxation issues and
cooperative agreements with
Indian TRD pursuant to the
statute that we're talking about
we're in the actually collapses
Tax.
Back to top and it's done
through one computerized system
where.
Address and it is the code and
everything so this is all done
on computer.
A result of that many tribes
that in the past would not.
Gross receipts tax because of
the problems collecting it in
ministry.
Are now doing that through this
cooperative agreement is not
totally voluntary between the
state and try.
This the tribe's utility to
Hi this tax let this revenue.
The same time this provides a
lot of protections for the
tribes in the state one of the
things we always get on.
With is on how I the state or
someone saying I don't know why
to try to through these
cooperative agreements that's
not an issue and on top of that
there are numerous requirements
for authority
and state working on that to
make sure that tax is collected
and allocated pursuant to start
actually.
I think it's important to
realize the state on certain
transactions.
Thanks tweet keeps twenty five
percent tax.
The driver tax.
these are the ones where is this
is a cooperative arrangement but
I have pretty much of Madam and
ones where the state and the
tribes could arguably Tax.
This double taxation is what it
is not.
So.
Twenty five percent Sarah.
What is the ability to exercise
the three percent
administrative.
Through these cooperative
agreements now the state could
do that.
With the cooperative agreements.
The morning chairman my mate.
no I think she answered the
question I don't know who that
is Senator Steinborn
Jeff.
Any other questions with Senator
Woods.
Question Mr chair
It seems that in the FOR it
talks about
If you raise these taxes above
the local of.
Higher than the state tracks.
And the
One quarter three quarter.
Rule doesn't apply the in.
Or is it still no matter how
high the tax gets the state gets
twenty five percent.
This is that the way it's set up
to do Mr chair.
Our chairman and senator so
bottom line has to be
substantially similar and then
I'm gonna let my subject matter
expert referred to the twenty
five percent.
anymore senator and chairman.
Mister Rogers.
My response to.
This is the money is divided
four percent to seventy eight.
For the state introduce our
state and the county Porter in
some cases in the U. S. economy
but the taxation and revenue
department takes the position
that you could also also to try.
No issue with that always.
The.
We're.
Require a twenty five percent be
advised the police power of the
state this is the course of
taxes.
Chairman.
We go over what we're doing
right now is it up so that the
state administered spin gets no
money.
This I guess the question I'm
getting.
Senator it's my understanding
the state most all get the point
two five percent from the G. R.
T. in and whatever they charge
above that rate goes to the
tribe's so we have a base that
that we participate in
Representative dollar rate in
the taxes thirty saints twenty
five percent of that goes to the
state in the five percent of the
tribe so whatever they raise Mr
chair they get to keep the six
with if it's if it's above.
Whenever the percentages point
two five.
Whatever they raise it to the
state still gets point two five
so they raise it to can we still
get point to I think this six
weeks does that.
Okay thank thank thank you.
Correctly any other questions
from committee members
mistrusted explained that
corporate we want to clarify.
Thank you.
We Mr substantially similar.
We have a definition of
substantially similar.
Thank you chairman thank you
senator so it's my understanding
if it went
egregiously too high that The
New Mexico taxation revenue
would would refuse that
but when we get down to the
amount of of percentage to that
I'd like to defer to Mister
Rogers.
This is absolutely correct this.
The discretion to deny on the
state.
Nation one hundred remember the
tribe whose taxes are not
substantially similar.
Now there is no set it and then
she.
Term.
I think you could look at it as
your guide the
taxation present
on taxes in the how Steven
you're very high compared to
other places or you would have
You know almost ninety percent
I have recently.
Substantially similar is also
something as the tribe's
Representative tribe almost
forty years.
They work with it counties
usually because they have to do
it is Mr relationship.
Wants to kill another community.
Right so work together each week
you.
Mr chair of the Senator.
Sorry yellow because we.
What my concern here is is what
we're going to do now is.
This will go to court and the
judge then becomes the.
The the part a single judge
becomes the person who gets to
decide tax rate not the
legislature.
Substantially similar work Regis
are not.
Defined terms and so if the if
the for tribal pueblo nation
decides to raise their tax by
two percent.
The county those no no that's
too much we go to court and the
judge says yeah or nay.
And.
We have once again surrendered
more of the forty more of the
Prague if of the legislative
body unless we have a definition
of what that means.
So I don't have an amendment for
I just know that we're about to
once again give a judge
authority over us.
Thank you.
My only response for that if the
tribes go to two percent
increase the state games twenty
five percent of that.
Automatically in and so that
that's the kind that
substantially and looked in.
Registers dictionary more on.
With that definition is so
Senator Padilla yet Mr funds
going to leverage them thank you
Mr chairman and senator and I
apologize to a lot of stuff what
we have already set of it is
there already in agreement with
the Navajo Nation.
In place of the need to get that
the other senator Senator
there's an amendment in the.
I guess I did see that part of
the amendment that was put on it
to to the for additional.
I have on the.
Okay.
Mr chairman and chairman sorry
still got sorry that's pretty
much it I just know that that
would be a large you know miss
if we didn't do that thank you
Mr chairman I just I'm sorry I
didn't realize you were such a
Senator thank you senator for
bringing this forward I wanted
just to elaborate a little bit
in that it's about the concern
that one of the tribes raise our
taxes two or three or four
percent higher or whatever maybe
it wouldn't be in the tribe's
best interests to do that and
and the reason is that why would
a tribes want to raise our taxes
so high then the state because
everyone would just by things
out of the tribal reservation or
out of the boundaries of the
tribes and of losing so it's in
their best interest to keep it
similar to the states and and
vice versa so we can work
cooperatively in these
agreements that have been on
going it took a long time to
accomplish right I recall so
that's really the purpose to to
work as closely as we can A. yet
respect each other's
sovereignty.
Thank you yes.
And I moved to pass a lesser
said the past.
Thank you question from
committee members work Avenue
past motion from Santo this
second second from sentences all
us.
Direction to the fast motion or.
There Burke.
Well yes.
Here I intended to vote yes come
in.
And I'm still gonna vote yes.
But just because we say we love
each other doesn't mean we're
gonna love each other next week
also because it mean that we
can't say oh let's raise it
because it's going to be a big
state project come through here
and so let's raise it to fifty
percent so we can get fifty
percent tax out of the
construction is going to go on
here and then we'll lower to
get.
I just.
I'm concerned.
Not that it's a bad idea not
that I think there's hatred and
discontent.
I've just been here long enough
to know.
Judges ultimately going to take
more forty away from us.
Somewhere down the line.
Mr Chairman thirty six thank you
I know already through the vote
everything with your permission
I think the amendment to add the
nation was struck in Indian
Affairs.
Senator.
Chairman and senator yes it was
The fort still sports so Apache
tribe and the Navajo Nation were
added and then subsequently
removed.
So Mister chairman it and I know
that you're to securing this now
but if you could please work on
that after I'd like you to look
at that thank you.
I plan to senator and chairman.
Thank you any objection.
Was removed at the request of
senator Tom.
based on the fact the Navajo
Nation several packs of three
men to the state.
May not we should have this is
particularly cooperative with
the state.
Thank
you.
Request.
Any objection to the do passed
motion.
Anybody voting no Senator Burt
is voting yes.
Senator you have a do pass on
house bill thank you chairman
thank you committee members as
amenities.
Every time I think we're gonna
do thirty seven one hundred
thirty seven I don't see the
sponsor I apologize Sir but
there's something working once
we get the STBs lined out.
The probably come off the floor
and try to get those passed out
so we can get them over to the
house in so so we may come up
the smaller do that they'll
excuse us
there may be a few more bills
out of committee but.
Pretty well wrapped up.
The waters of the a lot of the
experts for thirty seven here so
I just wonder is a sponsor
heading back to the room
Representative was sitting in
this chamber I have to say that
there's some other issues
working on Senate bill thirty
seven that that we need to
figure out we thought we'd go
today and then it in the last
few minutes we ask the sponsor
committee so we want to get that
bill done but there's some other
things.
Figure out if we are we are is
that the intent Mr chair than
here at this afternoon.
I don't know because I've been
told.
Muted when they finally.
And start this is.
And so
If they ask you to role as chief
this case Senator what we're
gonna talk about the topics
today.
In FY I okay.
And so what we're trying to get
heard but every time I want to
hear and I told sponsored come
become something.
Deal with and so we'll talk
about that.
Thank.
Thank you we're just.
Hopefully the result will be
here today to go above.
