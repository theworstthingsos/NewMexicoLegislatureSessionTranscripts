Uh amendment that should be
passed out.
This bill simply
Upgrades makes a little bit
higher, the marriage license
fees.
The original bill had it raised
up to $50 with the uh clerk
getting $15 and the
General, uh, fund for the county
general getting their original
$15 which were not changing and
then uh $20 I'm sorry, $20 going
to the clerk, $15 going to the
Children's Fus trust fund.
Our amendment raises it to $55
and puts $20 in the children's
trust fund, and that is the
extent of the subamendment, Mr.
Chairman.
Uh, if I can get a motion to
move, we have a motion to move
the amendments.
OK, Senator Steinbor2 Woods, any
opposition to
The amendment.
For discussion purposes.
You know
Any more further discussion on
the memo, your amendment.
OK, so now we'll move the
amendment, the 2nd
And
OK, good. Any opposition to the
Motion to
the amendment.
You know, you have an amended
bill.
So we're back on the bill.
Thank you. And that's exactly
what it does. It raises the
marriage license fees to $55. 0
boy, that Senator Padilla can't
get married. It's just way too
costly, Mr. Chairman. My expert
witness here can tell you how
long it's been since those fees
have been raised and, and.
Go ahead.
Thank you, Senator Gil, um,
chair members of the committee.
This is a bipartisan support in
Mexico County supported the
clerk's affiliate are very happy
to have this bill, um.
You heard today and the fee has
always been $25 and so, um,
We're excited for uh creating a
sustainable funding source for
clerks' offices for document
preservation.
Thank you.
OK. Thank you stand for. All
right, uh.
First we'll go out to the
audience. Anybody here in
support of this bill.
Do you have anybody on Zoom that
supports the bill?
If you want to come up and say
to the rest of the folks that
are listening can hear you, if
you can introduce yourself and
give you a couple of minutes.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee. I'm Catherine
Clark, the Santa Fe County
clerk. I'm sorry to getting
microphone instructions. Oh.
Uh, I am in support of this
bill. I believe it has been
before I was born that the fee
has been in place, uh, what
we're seeing is that a lot of
the clerk's offices older
records, um, are in need of
preservation and we need a
source of funding to do that,
and this is a good way of
keeping up with the times,
making sure the Children's Fund
gets more money, but also that
clerk's offices has a little
revenue source to help sure that
we preserve our historical and
valuable documents. Thank you.
Great. Thank you.
Anybody in opposition?
See none?
Will the committee, anybody, uh,
Senator Woods, um, Mr. Chair and
Senator, how did you come up
with this amount to raise the
fee?
Mr. Chair, um, uh, Senator,
thank you. I'm gonna let my
expert witness, um, address
that.
So we originally wanted a 2,
sorry, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, we are originally
wanted just the $25 increase.
However, um, the Children Trust
Fund wanted an additional $5 and
so that's why we then increase
it to 55, and that allows the
clerk's affiliate or the clerk's
offices to keep the $20 and then
give an additional $5 to the
Children's Trust Fund.
And Mr. Chairman, Senator, the
reason that they picked that
original amount was because
Then the math and the estimate
that that's what it would cost
them to try to preserve some of
the records that they have.
And um if you've ever been
involved in records
preservation, it, you know, it
entails making sure that the
records are in order, maybe
scanning them, turning them into
digital. So the, the
preservation of very old records
which may include um yours and
mine, uh, wedding, uh,
certificates, uh, they may be
kind of old. Um, that
preservation, they estimate that
this is a good amount that will
begin giving them that
opportunity to
Preserve those olds.
And
Mr. Chair and senator.
Give me an idea how much this
will increase.
Give me 3 counties. Tell me how
much it will increase the money
to 3 counties, any 3 counties.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, this
varies across states. So in
Santa Fe County, we get over a
little bit over 1000 marriage
licenses just in our county
because we are a tourism, you
know, type of county, um, in
Hidalgo County, she mentioned
that they get a little under
like 30 marriage licenses. So in
the first year, you know, the,
the money would just sit there
and over the year it would
create um a fund which they can
use for document preservation.
So those are the two counties I
have. Sandoval County also has
close to.
Santa Fe, if not more, uh, based
on their population.
Uh, Mr. Chair, which one had 30?
Um, Hidalgo County.
OK.
So
The last question.
Is this supported by all county
clerks.
Mr. Chair
Mr. Chair, Senator, yes, so all
county clerks are in support. We
did vote as an affiliate to
support this, and then we took
it to the Mexico counties, and
they also support this bill.
All right, this will be an
interesting test because there's
some people that will vote
against a fee increase every
time. So this will be an
interesting outcome.
Thank you, Mister Chair.
Thank you, Senator. All right,
Senator Campos.
No, Mr. Chairman, I, uh, go
ahead and go on to to Senator, I
just wanted to go and make a
motion.
Do you have questions for you?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And so, um, on behalf of, you
know, Senator Shindo and myself,
we are curious when does a
marriage license expire?
Mr. Chairman, uh, Senator, I do
not believe there's an
expiration. Yeah.
Because the two of us are still
holding out hope that we'll, you
know.
Able to walk down the aisle.
Not together necessarily, but
you know, but um, all right,
thank you very much.
All right, Senator Campos. Thank
you very much, Mr. Chairman,
members of the Senate Finance
Committee, I move a due pass for
Senate Bill 290 is once amended.

Oh, it's presenting the

OK.
Mm
All right, we'll go ahead and uh
Uh, we have Senator Trujillo,
uh, present the bill.
sent a bill 480.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman,
again.
Good afternoon. Um, so the
fiscal impact of this bill is
nothing.
Uh, New Mexico's graduation rate
has hovered between 75 to 80%
since 2016.
A typical senior cohort of just
under 30,000 students. This rate
means approximately 6000
students do not graduate from
high school every year.
That means that over a five-year
period, an equivalent of the
entire statewide senior class,
leaves high school without a
diploma.
Every year we appropriate
millions of dollars to our
institutions of higher
education, workforce solutions
to implement programming that
provide pathways for our
students who may not have
graduated from high school.
And our public schools also
offer re-engagement programs for
students who may not have
graduated.
These programs, high school
diploma reengagement, high
school equivalent, and workforce
credentialing are all
extraordinarily important in
providing pathways for future
success for our students who
have struggled.
The problem is that all of these
programs have no centralized
list of students from which they
can recruit.
Meaning that they can directly
contact students who are
non-graduates, graduates to
encourage them to enroll in
programs that we're offering.
That does seem very inefficient,
and so we've introduced Senate
bill.
480
To try to address that.
What the bill does is it
requires that every summer, the
PED create a list of all
students who were in high school
in any one of the last 4 years
who did not graduate within the
4 years.
This list would be available for
the higher education department.
Public post-secondary
educational institutions.
School districts and charter
schools and New Mexico-based
adult education providers or
workforce development programs
that provide programming for out
of cohort students attaining a
high school diploma.
Or a high school
Equivalency credentials or
workforce credentials.
So these lists will help to
recruit so that those programs
are even more successful.
I do have with me an expert
witness who has helped us
through this, and that's Carrie
Robin Brunder with public
charter schools, New Mexico for
any technical questions. And
with that, Mr. Chair, we stand
for questions.
All right, thank you. Uh, first,
we'll go out to the audience
here in support of uh committee
substitute Senate Bill 480.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, I'm Amina Aragon from
New Mexico, Kids can, and for
all of the reasons articulated
by Senator Trujillo. We really
believe that this bill would
help us identify the students
that this, that our schools are
not currently serving well and
help them understand other
opportunities available to them
to make sure to either get
training or their high school
diploma.
you.
What else?
Uh, anybody in opposition from
this bill.
Umadu pass
Yeah.
Thank you, Chair. Just one
question. So is this data gonna
be pulled together pre uh
typical graduation or to be used
before or after.
Uh, Mr. Chairman and Senator
Padilla in order to count as a
graduate, you have to graduate,
but graduate by the end of June,
so we have them pull the data
July 15th, so it will capture
all of those students who
graduated that year and all of
the non-graduates. That's why
the timing is over the summer
they essentially be adults by
the time the data is made
available for the purposes of
trying to get them through the
process of graduating. Mr.
Chairman and Senator Padilla,
the way the bill is written is
if a student did not graduate
weight within 4 years, but they
attended any one of the four
preceding years, they would land
on the list. So you would have
students who are basically 18 to
22. OK.
All right, thank you.
Thank you.
The motion would do pass, but,
seconded by Senator Gonzalez.
color.
Senator Brent.
Senator Campos, thank you very
much, uh, Madam Secretary. I uh,
go ahead and vote yes on the
committee substitute for Senate
Bill 480.

Senator Munoz.
Yes. Sports, yes, we have a DuP

Chairman. Thank you, members.
He was gonna get labeled the new
Doctor No.
Representative, you're holding
up the committee get up here.
Garrett, you're from the house,
get up here in this chair.
I'm serious, scared, we're not
gonna hear this bill, so you
better support your House
members and no Garrett, you're
coming up here.
Representative Garrett, we're
gonna have to wait till we get
an expert witness. Garrett needs
to move up here. Do you, he
works for the house. You should
order him up here. You're his
employer.
Look back at him
Who
Here.
No, Garrett, come on, sit up
here.
You need the experience. Come
on.
If they fire you, we will hire
you.
And we'll give you a pay
increase. How's that sound?
I'll think about that one. Could
you fire himpresentative Garrett
that way I could hire him back
right now.
Let's go. Who's gonna start us
off? I am Mr. Chairman,
housemaker, let me remind you,
represent Garrett, when you go
to the house that the Senate is
already hearing House bills.
We have Senate bills on Friday
in education. Well, today's
Wednesday.
You know the Senate moves more
efficiently in the House, Mr.
Chairman, members of the
committee, House Bill 69 is
nearly identical to a House Bill
403 that the representative and
I ran in 2023. It passed
unanimously out of the house
bipartisan support includes
their chamber made its way to
the Senate, it passed
unanimously through committees.
We were literally next on the
agenda on the Senate floor.
we signed out so our bill was
not heard. What this bill does,
Mr. Chairman, is it's a public
service loan forgiveness, um, to
the federal program that
provides federal student debt
relief to public service workers
who worked in the public service
for 10 years while making
payments on their federal
student loans. It was enacted by
Congress Mr. Chairman in 2007.
Now this bill tackles two of the
common issues with the public
service loan forgiveness
program, a lack of awareness
about the PSLF.
and its benefits and the issue
of adjunct and contingent
faculty certification to
qualify.
With that, Mr. Chair, we stand
for questions. Garret, do you
have a student loan?
Chair, Senator, yes, I do. And
so this would help you.
Cha
Uh, I'm not completely familiar
with the contents of the bill,
but um you have your iPad right
there read it well read it while
we go to the audience. Anybody
in the audience and support.
We know 2 people are in support,
anybody in opposition seemed on
Zoom.
Then on Zoom, Garrett, did you
finish reading that?
We're gonna wait here until you
read it.
Senator, uh,
Seeing that it is getting late
into the evening, I will refrain
the wheel follow up offline. Um,
do I expect you to see you this
evening is my question.
You do?
Questions from committee
members, Senator Tree Hill.
Now this is not a question, Mr.
Chairman. This is just a
comment. I wanna say that the
the public student or the public
service loan program has been
manipulated by many
administrations to the point
that it doesn't help those who
need it.
And the prior administration
under the Biden administration,
they cleaned some of that up,
and they made it so that people
who had counted on and, and, and
done their service in public
service would reap those
benefits, and I could not be
more grateful for that. I have a
letter that I will keep forever,
um, that acknowledge my service
to the to the state, um, both
here and in another state and
did forgive my student loans.
And I just could not be more
grateful for that. It's life
changing, and so I stand in full
support of this because it's
incredibly important.
Thank you.
Aren't any comment to that?
Chair, Senator, good news.
Any other questions from
committee members.
See none can have and motion for
due pass. We have a second by
Senator Gonzalez, motioned by
Senator Padilla. We called
heron.
Senator Brent
Senator Campos.
Thank you very much, Madam
Secretary. I will do pass, yes,
on House Bill 69.
Senator Gonzalez, Senator
Gonzalez votes yes Senator
Lanier.
Senator Padilla.
Centered by the votes, yes,
Senator Steinborn.
Senator Tobiasin.
Senator Trujillo.
Senator Trujillo votes yes plus.
Senator Woods.
Senator Woods votes, yes,
Senator Sendo.
Senator Shendo votes yes,
Senator Munoz, uh, alternative
motion motion to table.
Nondebatable, no.
Senator Munoz spoke to know. Uh
yes. It's, yes.
You have a do pass 7 in the
affirmative, 0 in the negative.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee.
What do you have to say about
that? Have you ever testified?
I, I, I do this because young
people like you that are working
in the legislature need to come
up and get familiar with what's
happening, right, and I have
young people in the back and
front of knowing you wanted a
job, I'd have hired you.
And that we need young people to
learn the legislative process,
Senator Campos, I mean.
And maybe the youngest, I don't
know how old Senator Padilla is
you.
Mr. Chairman Senator Cumbo,
thank you very much for
referring to me as a young
person that's just getting
started. I really love that.
I'll I'll work harder tomorrow.
Was your hair as curly as
Garrett's when you were younger.
It might have been when I got
started. Thank you, Mr. Chair,
Mr. Mr. Chairman, Senator, to
answer your question, this is
the 2nd time I've sat behind um.
this side of the committee the
first time was during my region
confirmation where was vice
chairing, so.
Yeah, and so young people like
you need to come in and they
need to learn this process.
Because we're losing a lot of
the process as we get older. I
mean, the decorum of the senate
is completely different than the
house, uh, the Senate operates
more efficiently than the house.
You just saw that in action, and
if you deny it, your poker fees
are gonna go up tonight
and so young people like you
need to to experience this, and
if we don't put you at the table
and we don't get you the
experience. There's nobody gonna
be here to, to run the show and
to replace us and so that's why
I did that wasn't any part of
embarrassment, it's for.
experience, we expect you now to
testify on every house bill in
the Senate Finance since you're
gonna be here anyway, so you
should be able to sit up there
and tell us what it does. Uh, I
don't know we'll have the next
one will give you a heads up so
you can do some homework.
But I, I want people like you to
have the experience and to
really realize what this place
does and how it works and how it
functions. Uh, I just appreciate
you working for us, um, would
have been better in the Senate,
but.
I know you had to pick someone
you had to pick the dark side,
not the good side. Mr. Chair, I
just want to say thank you very
much for those comments and
bringing me up here is a cool
experience and just speaking of
decorum, I do think I believe I
heard a senator referred to
another senator as Sleepy Joe
today on Santa, so
she's like, Oh, you're
listening, huh?
Yeah we are quick-witted,
and we have to do work, right?
But there, there has to be a
lightness in this building,
otherwise we're all just gonna
be in this box of
biting each other and Senator
Sleepy Joe's across the hall.
You'd like to pay him a visit.
You can tell him I listened to
that today on the floor.
Mr. Chairman, if I just made uh
tray my analysts and we have
this conversation today that the
younger generation deserves a
seat at the table, and I
appreciate that you stated that,
and I agree with you and thank
you for that. I, I mean, I, I'm
always hired young people.
Cause they need to know what's
happening and sometimes they go
off in different careers and
sometimes they come back like
Adrian did, uh, some become
deputy secretaries, um.
And so it, it's a good
experience for them and get them
into government, so.
Mr. Chairman.
Garrett we'll see you tonight at
7:30. For those of us who don't
know, we have Garrett and I play
cards once a week.
OK
Hickey, we're gonna roll over
your bill. We're already done.
The time ran out.
We're working on overtime right
now.
How long do you think your bill
is gonna take?
disappeared, that depends on
you.
In,
Um, take a seat at the table and
let's try to get your bill out
of here.
You need Adrian is your expert
witness.
Or would you like Garrett?
Adrian left, so you're stuck
with Garrett Garrett, come on
up.
I have.
Um
The OSI
I think you're gonna rely on
Garrett this time, so.
The OSI Office Superintendent
insurance, come on up. Yeah,
you're gonna have to slide over
when you're not quite to the.
still on the sidebar.
You can pull this up on your
iPad and we'll ask some
questions. Senator Hickey.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm
presenting um Senate Bill 120.
And uh this bill does the
following things, uh, in the
original bill 317 and 21, uh, we
passed no cost sharing for
behavioral health services and
medications, including
inpatient.
And um
Since then, we've had a chance,
particularly the OSI to evaluate
the bill or was it called for a
valuation, and we have some
pretty impressive statistics
about the number of people that
are increasing use of services
and how it is not increasing,
um,
Uh, uh.
Premiums, uh, maybe 1.5% in one
plan and now have them testify
that and also corrects an air uh
because health plans were under
outpatient, we thought that
covered for urgent care and ER,
but they were charging cost
sharing, so we clarify that
that's part of outpatient in the
bill.
And it also cleans up high
deductible language that the
black and there's no cost
sharing until the deductible is
uh fully used. So I have
presented something to you, um,
that I'll just, if
And this sheet here, if you just
read where it's green in
outline.
Medical costs for treating, uh,
patients with chronic medical
and comorbid mental health
substance use disorder
conditions are 2 to 3 times
higher on average compared to
cost for those beneficiaries who
don't have comorbid, uh, mental
health uh CD and that's really
the basis of this bill. If
people get access to behavioral
health services, there are high
costs.
chronic disease exacerbations go
down, and if you look at the 2nd
uh summary here, uh, again in
the green, basically, uh, high
cost behavior health subgroup
out of 21 million people, um,
pounded for 44% of the cost of
21 million people and it's
actually the uh the those high
costs consisting of 5.7%. The
average annual cost for
behavioral health groupinnacle
surgical treatment was 2.8 to
6.2 times higher than those who
didn't have it, and half of
these individuals had spent less
than 68.
Uh, dollars annually for
behavioral health and what,
what's the biggest impediment to
behavioral health, the cost
sharing.
And so people don't use it, and
there this is Milliman, the top
actuary in the country in 2020
appropriate consideration.
Basically it says everyone
should be doing this to bring
down healthcare costs. Uh, we
did this at uh when you have
that.
Mr. Chen, thank you for your
question. Um, OSI is charged
with reviewing rates for
qualified health plans in the
individual and small group
market as well as large group
plans doing our qualified health
plan review, um.
We have been trying to track the
impact on recent legislation on
premium increases because
premiums um are very complex and
there's a lot of factors that go
into it on the average we see, I
mean, we've been seeing premium
increases annually, but for the
2025 planning health plans, only
one carrier, uh, reported direct
premium impact of 1.5%.
Everybody said that everybody
else said that the behavior
health cost sharing elimination.
has no impact on premiums.
expert witness to.
Oh good.
Anybody in in the audience in
favor.
Anybody in opposition.
We'll take
One and one, to be fair.
Anybody on Zoom?
on Zoom so take one and one.
wants to go first and support or
in opposition.
and support correct. Yes. Hello,
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee, Emily Pepin,
registered lobbyist with the New
Mexico Behavioral Health
Providers Association. I am also
a licensed clinical social
worker and endorsed infant
mental health specialist, and I
ask you all to vote yes on SB
120 as it supports the
accessibility and availability
of behavioral health services.
When faced with mental health
challenges, as we all are, no
one should have.
to consider whether they can
afford life-saving medicine and
care. Senate Bill 120 diminishes
barriers and supports health for
all New Mexicans. Thank you.
Thank you.
rent your next opposition.
This
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Brent
Moore. I'm a registered lobbyist
for America's Health Insurance
plans and we stand in opposition
to this bill. The reason why we
stand in opposition to this bill
is when the original bill was
adopted, there was a 5-year
period for this to be a test
case to see whether or not this
would improve access to health,
but then also to see what the
impact would be for premiums,
and we believe that this bill is
premature. We're 3 years into
it.
The expiration date or the
sunset date that you see in the
bill is January 1st, 2027. So
there is still a period of time
to look at the data coming in
and to see what's happening in
this space in the other
committee where this bill was
presented, there was a lot of
discussion of this, the studies
that are ongoing to look at this
to see whether or not this is
something that is appropriate.
We think an extension of the
sunset is a better way to go
than to completely take the, the
time or the the sunset off.
Of it and I would note that when
you look to the statements about
whether or not this impacted
premium. There was, there was an
implementation date in the
original bill. Plans were going
through the, the premium or the
rate setting cycle leading up to
the implementation of this bill.
Uh, health plans built in the
increased cost into those plans
and so when the IOSI was looking
for data, they weren't
accounting for the prior year.
That was noted in the OSI's
analysis, so the impact of
premium is there if you look to
the correct years. We
respectfully oppose the bill.
Questions from committee
members.
10 Woods.
So the question is, why don't we
just wait for the sunset, but we
wait one more year and, and get
more data at this, Mr. Senator.
Senator Hickey is asking you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Senator Wood. What, uh, the
opponent to the bill is
referring to as a 6 month study
that was done by Johns Hopkins
and in that bill that are in
that study, uh, that's now
funded by a major grant from
NI the National Institute of
Mental Health, um, they were not
able to collect a lot of data,
um, we now have a yearly report.
that uh our
Expert witness from the OSI will
testify to not only was there
any increase in cost in the
qualified health plans. So the,
the study he's referring to was
at the very beginning of this.
This is from 24 and um so it's
so self obvious that people are
picking it up and that we have
now put together this behavioral
health, uh,
Uh, initiative in New Mexico, it
would be a shame that we can't
get people into all these funded
programs because they do
experience the barrier to care,
and I've asked my expert to
elucidate on that a little bit.
The loosening or.
Who's I'm presenting Pilocybin
next door, maybe it got me.
He should have tested the
sample.
Go ahead,
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, thank you. OSI has
been collecting data, um, as
required pursuant to the
regional behavior health cost
sharing elimination law and
pursuing on to the data that the
carriers reported to OSI in 20
for fiscal year 2023, um, that
was a little bit over 7 million
of savings of cost sharing to
consumers and in FY 24, this
number increased.
to 8 million, uh, pursuant to
the same data, the average
membership of unique individuals
who receive the behavior health
services increased from 20 27.9%
in FY 23 to 36.08% in FY 24,
which shows that there is
significant cost savings to
consumers and increased
utilization, which is
But specifically what the intent
of the bill is to provide access
to services. Thank you.
And Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair.
This sets in, in.
2027.
So we could run one more year
without doing anything, and
would have more data, right?
This chair and senator.
Thank, thank you, Senator Woods
for that question and Mr. Chair,
we could, but uh the reason we
brought this forward now is that
we're going to start to do these
grant programs and we're gonna
have things start to pick up,
uh, after, uh, once people start
getting the grants we're gonna
get treatment programs. We don't
want this to, uh,
Uh, get inhibited, people need
to know that this is going to be
there and it's gonna be part of
the future, and so we want it to
pass this now, we could have
delayed one more year, but it
had been really close. People
wouldn't know for sure, so
that's why we're doing it this
year. In, in what people are we
talking about wouldn't know for
sure is it the, the provider or
the ones that's asking for the
service, Mr. Chair and Senator
Woods that it'd be both.
But it's
Everything is contingent upon
everything. I know that. I mean,
that's
Obvious, but
This
This is a
Pretty big step here. We
I wasn't in for the vote this
morning, I had to leave and
And it was a $70 million vote
and this is a $30 million vote.
We, we've got
quite a little bit of money
here, I think.
That's what I read. I read a, a
30.
27.
The total is going to be 35
million.
A 3 year cost of 63 million.
And we keep talking about gospel
federal cuts.
And we got another year of
sunset here.
Uh
I'm not gonna be able to support
your bill.
Uh, I think we better.
Play this out a little ways,
Miss Chan, Senator, thank you.
Thank you.
Let me correct something cause I
mean, we went over this.
Yesterday
And called the analyst for the
FIR.
And she said she got it wrong.
And now today's FAR.
saying the same thing, 34 to 63.
You have a different FIR that
came out.
I remember that conversation
with me and Adrian and analyst.
Yes, I do, um, and I just spoke
to that analyst and she uh is a
uh PhD in political science who
has just started doing
healthcare analysis at at the
um.
LFC, she really doesn't have any
background to understand the
actuarial science behind this,
um, I'm have agreed to sit down
with her and go through these
two papers to show that the
impact is really very positive
in savings and the uh the, the,
the uh NIMPsia and the retiree
health plans make a lot of
assumptions about, well, if they
can't get it.
and they're gonna go to out of
state and they just keep finding
ways to push up the numbers,
the, uh, I, I, I am.
Given that I started New Mexico
Health Connection, so you're
gonna shorten your answers, so,
OK.
Adrian, this is correct me.
The analysts that we talked to
said that NIMSA in the in the
public school insurance story
entire healthcare are already
doing this. So there's no cost
to the general fund.
That's when we talked to the FIR
did not come out.
According to what she told us,
correct, was it and listening,
uh, Allegra, Allegra, and so.
Just so people know.
Uh, we have it started hearing
money bills yet.
So this FIR is wrong and, and so
it's already done, they're
already paying this cost.
Uh, through NEMC and the retiree
healthcare, so there's no.
So, so.
This chair, you're saying
there's no cost to the general
fund.
You say that this is all wrong.
That we're seeing in front of
us. They're already doing it, so
who's paying the copay right
now?
Sin that well the copay is paid
by the rivers.
Walks in the door.
But
Adrian here.
You, you're, we're talking about
two different things.
The copay is paid by whoever has
the insurance. This is, this
study is already being done.
Here's the updated FIR right?
And so should we get copies of
that to every member.
Like nobody know I made a $34
million mistake.
Um,
That's very important that you
understand the FR. I don't know
why this one.
Is not in the books correct.
earlier today, so it was more of
a timing issue.
But today, this is today's date
5/3 2020 and that's.
This is date backwards.
Mm
All right, so, so, so let's just
clarify in this one.
He does his date backwards.
And
so there's some confusion there.
He's not in the back room,
otherwise you tell him that, but
the FIR that they're making copy
of.
Or it will show you that they're
already doing this and they're
already paying to do this in
retiree healthcare in NIMSA.
That there's no cost, additional
cost to the budget.
They're already doing it at that
cost.
And so
So what you have the floor?
OK.
It says in my analysis.
This makes permanent to
elimination of patients out of
pocket costs for behavior health
services. Is that right or
wrong?
That is correct, Mr. Chair and
Senator Woods. And so there's no
cost to anybody when they quit
paying out of patient, uh,
copays.
Well that's not gonna cost
anybody anything. Who's gonna
absorb that cost for sure.
And senator.
Uh, I'll turn that over to uh
the uh OSI who's head of life
and health, and again, with uh
the, the origins and how they
calculated their studies in
these other agencies is very
difficult to tell, but we're
finding in the qualified health
plans, there was only one plan
that experienced an increase in
premium, and that was 1.5% due
to this bill having been in
place.
Mr. Chair, Senator Woods, and um
based on some of the Merman
studies which were done for
Senator Hickey when he was the
CEO of New Mexico Health
Connections in the past,
eliminating behavior health cost
sharing is actuallyreducing the
total cost of healthcare to the
health plan. Therefore, there is
savings to consumers as well as
savings to the health plans
themselves.
This, this is the same thing.
No, it, it, it does not, and
the, and the yellow one, this
one says the 3-year cost to RCA
is 5140 or 22 14,000, 1450 or
29,000 to NIMSI and it's coming
out of the benefit funds, not a
general fund.
The other FIR said it was a
general fund over 3 years, so.
That's the correction to the
FIR.
Teamwork, I don't if it comes
out of
The healthcare funds.
Then
Someone has to pay that.
And if we
If we eliminate
I go on and uh, so you wanna
roll this over to until tomorrow
until we get the correct FIR so
everybody's not confused. That
would be the best thing to do.
That way we, that way we know
exactly what we're doing and
there's not a lot of questions
on the FIR.
That's they're gonna be the best
thing to do.
I mean, this FIR said it was 34
million. This one shows it's.
In total 63,000 and so we need
to get.
The correct number, Austin.
We're gonna roll this over till
tomorrow, so we get the F
correct FIR and we have
everything correct. Garret.
Mhm
Mr. Chair, I just want to
clarify. So what I, I heard you
say is that Nimsia and the
retirees' Healthcare Authority
have already eliminated the cost
sharing.
But in the FIR in the 2nd page
in the middle, they're talking
about it being so it would, I
think we need to clarify which
is it?
That's what we need to clarify
because we called the analysts
yesterday and said there was no
cost, and now we got.
Every FIR telling us something
different in Austin has brought
in another FIR.
So we need to roll this over so
we can get the correct FIR and
the correct language. There,
real quickly, make sure you do
your homework, the executive
summary on this. Tell me how
this supports this. I mean,
you're not gonna do the homework
tonight because we got other,
OK.
That's the best thing to do is
where everybody's confused, so
let's clarify where we're at,
understand what we're gonna do
before we do that.
Thank you, Mr. Chair we're all
conflicted up here.
Other than that, we can just
table your bill.
I don't hear you.
No, I, I won't roll it over.
My vision is kind of
short-sighted, so I didn't hear
anything from me. So let's roll
over this.
Uh, we're gonna.
We're gonna go through language
tomorrow. Adrian's gonna set up
some meetings and start getting
those subcommittee rolling so we
can.
Capital, all those subcommittees
need to start so we can get that
some of that wrapped up. The
language committee stayed late
till the other night till
anybody that's listening, we do
work late in Senate Finance.
Uh, and Senator Compos, you want
to add some thank you very much
Mr. Chair, members of the Senate
Finance Committee, and you're
correct, uh, in the morning we
should have, if you will, the
modifications and
recommendations that have been
made uh regarding the language,
so we'll deal with that and then
the other thing that I just
wanted to mention, Mr. Chairman,
and it goes back to um as we
continue to deal with people
that are coming in that are that
are young that uh have high
aspirations and that are dealing
with us as we go through not
only the bills but.
FIRs, um, we're here to continue
to, to work through it and I
really appreciate your patience
as we deal with it, uh, because
we want to get it right, but
more importantly, I just really
appreciate all of our analysts
as they continue to work through
all this. I know a lot of times
they're under uh duress under a
quick timelines and uh with that
again, uh, your wisdom has shown
us that we're gonna work through
it, so I appreciate that, Mr.
Chairman.
OK, any other questions or
questions.
Uh, for the chair of the
language committee.
So, uh, are we gonna get a, a,
uh
If you call it a rack up or
something, or like a list of
what what the language committee
did or because I want to make
sure I've sent several things
over there and I want to find
out what their status is. So Mr.
Chair and I'm sorry we were
presented with it, the moment
we're being expected to vote on.
So, so, Mr. Chair and Senator
Palia, you're correct. What
we're gonna do is with the
mockup using that term, but also
with the matrices as we deal
with it, that information will
be provided to you for further
review. It's not going to go
ahead and be what we take
finally.
action on what we discussed the
other evening. We're still going
through that process of trying
to ensure that the language is
clean as we move forward.
Thank you Mr. Chair.
Thank you Senator of the
committee
Are you, uh, uh, uh, eliminating
any submissions that have
already been submitted, or are
you simply going through to make
sure that like you said a little
while ago, that the language is
correct or or are you, are you
eliminating things? Thank you
very much, Mr. Senator Padilla.
We are not eliminating anything.
We're giving recommendations,
uh, to the language committee in
order to go and have that for
their further review. OK, thank
you. Just be well aware of your
language hits general fun.
Or changes moves money out of
the fund for operating.
Because what we think may
happen, it's gonna get very
tight language is not gonna be.
Uh, appropriating money out of a
fund to for operational.
We're gonna have to really be,
but we haven't eliminated
anything. It's the exact came
down there were some more that
came down. There's still more
coming every single day, but at
some point we gotta wrap up and
quit and so we haven't looked at
LinkedIn, so they'll start that
next.
And then che uh just separate uh
full stop if it's all right with
you. I think I heard you say a
little while ago, we'll start
hearing um money bills, which
Can you give us a roadmap on how
if they're already in the
budget, then we'll start with
those.
And some of those money bills
don't need to pass if the
money's in the budget, so it'll
be up to the sponsors, whether
they want to hear them or not.
OK.
statutes that go with them, then
they got to go over and who's
gonna follow up with us on our
list because I have several
here. I know several of us do,
so.
And it depends if there's money
in the budget or if we had to.
We'll go over those. I'm going
over those, we'll start hearing
those.
Oh, we're trying to.
Everybody's coming with money
and I had two notes on my table
today.
I don't know who they're from, I
don't know where they want
money, but it says, can I have
$2 million and I don't know what
for. Oh, that's a silly person
putting that on your desk and we
have actual bills that have real
meaning to them and, and some do
have dollars I'm just telling
you that I mean they've got two
so I just sent them back with
Adrian. I'm like, I don't even,
I can't even read the name, so I
don't even know who they are, so
OK.
Right
And Hickey, we'll see you
tomorrow morning at 6 a.m.
We'll expect coffees, burritos,
donuts.
bringing a toothbrush. I'm going
to the dentist at 7.
I don't want to use toothbrush.
Thank you.
