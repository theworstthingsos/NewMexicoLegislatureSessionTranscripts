Authority number four one three
Amanda thank you.
Miller.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee my name
is Amanda Dick Peddie with the
legislative finance committee as
madam chair noted from the
executive we have Simon Miller
IDFA analyst for the economic
development department the
border Authority and the
spaceport all your bullets are
in one place so the bullets for
the spaceport sorry for border
Authority.
Begin on page two very top of
the page and there's just a
couple notes background on some
border Authority activities for
FY twenty two.
For budget to the house
appropriations and finance
committee adopted the executive
budget recommendations which was
about ten thousand dollars
general fund revenue lower than
the LFC recommendation.
that's all my comments for
border three I can turn it over
to sign in for additional notes.
Madam chair members of the
committee Amanda covered
everything there this is a
relatively small agency budget
an annual budget of less than
six hundred thousand dollars
recommendations are very similar
with the seventy being a ten
thousand dollars lower this man
is that so with that I'll turn
it over to the state.
Thank you very much okay who's
next year let's see.
I think we should have madam
chair executive director Marco
grand on additional I think so
but I can't I can see it earlier
there but go are you there
director thank yes proceed.
Thank you for this opportunity I
just wanted to say quickly and
highlights some of our key
accomplishments since twenty
nineteen I know we're in a tight
schedule but I'll just mention
briefly that we increased agency
revenue by more than fifty eight
percent just we have advanced
still critical infrastructure
projects.
Including the border highway
connector which is now fully
funded as of this summer we work
with our federal partners to
expand the number of commercial
crossings of the oath of our
media reports.
Or maybe for example in terms of
that is only used to cross three
hundred to commercial it is a
day.
Now the number is significantly
higher than the other day.
We are sure of commitments for
future major funding investments
along the border and expand our
reach can increase to.
It and increase our partners.
With that in the
process.
Okay thank you thank you Mister
good is the growth rate is that
how you pronounce your name.
This provision and ciation thank
you thank you very much okay
then do we have any questions
from the committee Senator will
Senator Woods and then we have
served the and then we have
Senator Burt thank you Senator
Woods.
Thank you madam chair.
sure I noticed that your
contract services.
Your request increased by
nearly.
What time.
Why would you need that much
more contract services.
I want to mention.
Budget analysts and turn it over
to him to explain that request.
because of the budget analyst
for the border.
And basically of the members of
chairman
we are requests that
would include our products
services are
Are not.
and then there's engineering
services that are required to
the government projects and we
are how to hire
form to do of limiting work or
whatever projects that highlight
that is.
Okay madam chair
I would request from you.
A list of your vendors you
contract vendors that that is
actually doing their contract
work.
And the amount of their
contracts.
In the services they provide.
Madam chair.
Thanks.
Did you hear that for the ages
it's a request for the agency so
yes.
We we can definitely find thank
you okay.
Thank you very much Senator with
your death thank yes we have
Senator Padilla thank you madam
chairwoman and thank you for
your presentation just a
question on the the overall
project are we keeping pace with
the economic a propensity or or
or opportunities that are you
know available to New Mexico are
we keeping pace with all that
based on everything you've got
going on there at the are you
funded appropriately to to meet
the the pace of the economic the
engine that's that's kind of
become that area.
Members of the committee I would
say that you know we certainly
welcome additional funding
but we we have made incredible
progress in advancing very
important projects including you
know warmer which were in the
last steps to complete that
project is the things one also
you know the point of entry
which has been a priority for us
and and the border have a
connector which is so we've
we've made incredible progress.
This site are limited funds we
will always of course will come
in additional funding but is far
as our project amounts we are
invention of several major
projects we're also looking at
projects to increase our agency
revenue which which again has
has significantly increase the
last two years.
Thank you madam chair and and
thank you to the to the for the
information where where do you
see is going I guess now I mean
the work sort of going to come
to a a weird place with our you
know kind of national politics
as well as and I'm not expecting
you to comment on politics with
you know with everything going
on with with the pandemic and
then you know we have this
massive Revenue infusion into
the state of New Mexico right
now.
Where do you what is your
projection going out in the next
maybe one to three years would
you be willing to comment on
that I'm just curious because
you have a handle on something
that's very important in New
Mexico what direction are we
heading in.
From an economic standpoint.
I would say that we're we're
we're going to see continued
growth you know just last year
we expected another banner year
we will likely be to twenty
nineteen.
In terms of exports you know
economic development the market
price to get better this we have
a lot of interest from the
Taiwanese firms in particular
with the.
Issues that we have an important
LA and Long Beach that will
likely lead to more investment
both in Mexico and on the border
as well so yeah we we definitely
expect a surge.
both in investments on the
private and public.
I'm really happy to hear that I
was really looking forward to
you being here today so I could
can ask you those questions in
terms of what's what's the
outlook because of what we're
gonna really have to have all
hands on deck as soon as the New
Mexico revenue generating
capabilities shift.
You know in in a really big way
over the next couple years thank
you madam chair.
Thank you Sir for the F. okay
we've got Senator Burt your next
thank you madam chair in the
thank you for the report the.
the connector and curious about
the connector between one thirty
six and four ninety eight did
you say that that is now fully
funded.
The center is yes that is really
important okay and plug it in a
speech which was approved in the
Senate okay and how long of a
quarter or is that if I may ask.
Sure that's about five miles as
we're expecting finals in in the
cost for that five miles if you
could.
I don't remember what was in the
in the budget so.
So we don't have the full cost
of this point because when the
feasibility stage however.
I think we were gonna estimates
of about fifty to fifty million.
Fifty nine for five okay
it is the other question I had
madam chair is does the border
authorities addition the certain
routes I I know that we you know
we trade goods back and forth
across the border and that's
really the purpose of places
like Santa Theresa Columbus.
In a certain quarters highway
corridors away from the border
as preferred routes or things of
that nature that might be able
to get some additional funding
because you have this admitted
those is preferred routes.
do you do things like that at
all or do you look into such
things.
Well there's more of that in New
York City role I would say.
We we are looking at developing
order comprehensive water
strategy which will help guide
future strategic investment
which is kind of goes in line
with what you're saying.
Yeah and in I I just a question
madam chair because I know other
states normally on this border
but even on the Canadian border
have designated certain routes
going through states and and it
has enabled certain highways to
acquire additional funds to
enhance those highways in in the
real purpose of asking that
question is I know that you know
twenty five and ten obviously or
or
you know interstate highways
that would have those quarter
designations.
But I have to travel highway
fifty four quite often coming up
from Alamogordo
to Santa Fe and that highway is
attracting more more eighteen
will traffic.
and unfortunately there are
there seems to be to me more
more accidents on that highway
as well because it was initially
supposed to be a four lane
highway now it's only an
enhanced to line in there are
still a couple sections that are
on the books to be repaired or
upgraded haven't been done yet
but we still seem to see some
accidents especially in that
unimproved area there so I'm
just wondering if if you do your
long range planning in your
major planning if that be part
of the process it might allow
other highways to get additional
funding and help the dispersal
of all the materials coming
across the border at those sites
and certainly could help improve
the highway system within the
state of New Mexico so I just
kind of plant that seed with you
Sir and I appreciate your report
thank you madam chair.
Thank you madam chair and Marco
if you don't mind me calling you
by your first name was known
each other a long time and both
guys congratulations on your
appointment first of all.
In your.
Yeah you're doing a great job
and and just taken command
because your course already an
expert in this area you an
actual selections that headed up
question for you is just amazing
to see the explosive growth
happening in this.
You know in our trade in our in
your infrastructure what are the
big.
Big things you're thinking about
as far as the future that you
want us thinking about this for
is continuing the expansion and
planning for that if the
solidity for that.
Yes Sir this is going to do you
like I said we better friends
for for many years.
Very good
you know again I think that is
comprehensive water strategy
will really help us see because.
You know where we're at in this
meeting is is known looking at
and infrastructure investment is
also changes that could lead to
more economic growth this is
yours Hey the issues are point
as long committee LA.
that is really the be more
strategic when it comes to our
investments along the border you
know we're hoping that it that
is would we really develop or
come up with some of the answers
that will help you all when
looking at adding some investors
along border.
Okay thank you well look forward
to that and I know you'll let us
know of whatever we can do to
support your efforts so thank
you very much thank you Mr.
Thank you.
Sorry about that might speaker
was off do we have any other
questions from the committee.
Comments no okay.
Well I want to thank you for
your presentation some for your
comments and requests rationale
behind it thank you so much for
all your work we're going to
move on for the sake of time
that we're getting thank you
again we're gonna be off to the
Economic Development Department
next all right do we have Alicia
keys here there we go.
The mass madam chair I think
that the only cabinet
secretaries of the release from
jail if
we're all present here today in
everybody's yes the money in
person and
what the other one but somebody
made a jailbreak for.
Yes.
But.
I can go ahead and get started
with my opening remarks
again it Mr chairman members of
the committee Amanda Dick Peddie
from the legislative finance
committee we are joined once
again by Simon Miller a DFA
analyst for the economic
development department we have
secretary Alicia keys and that
W. secretary John Clark
testifying in person for us
today.
so couple notes for the economic
development department.
If members are interested in
some supplemental information
that you can use your LFC volume
three pages twenty three three
twenty nine those have lots of
lots of good information
including lead awards that need
to be awards at things that we
know members are interested in
south I direct you there
Budget wise overall the
executive recommendation
increase general fund revenue to
the Department by about thirty
five percent well the LFC
recommendation included a nine
point four percent increase in
general fund revenue.
The house appropriations and
finance committee did adopt the
LFC recommendation.
For one time appropriations V.
executive room recommended about
sixty three point five million
dollars it nonrecurring funding
and the LFC recommendation
included about seven million
dollars for the department.
With that I will turn it over to
provide informational comments
on budget and then we can go to
the secretary.
Thank
you Mr chair members of the
committee on alert on analysts
with the other day so overall
for FY twenty three the
executive recommendation about
three million dollars higher
than the LFC recommendation and
that three million he's
basically made up for this so
first the executive included six
million for job training
incentive program where's the
LFC recommendation includesd
five million so there's a one
million dollar difference there
seventy eight the executive
recommendation includesd one
point one five hundred eighty
to establish justice equity
diversity and inclusion minority
business office the vast
majority of that when we when I
finally is for financing
opportunities for minority owned
small businesses in New Mexico.
Third the executive
recommendation includes four
hundred eight thousand four
grant money makers that amount
is not included in the LFC
reputation and lastly the
executive includes a five
hundred thousand dollar increase
to attract foreign direct
investment in New Mexico and
established export markets for
New Mexico businesses.
Of those four items are what
make us pretty much retired
difference between the executive
recommendation and the LESC.
So with that I'll turn it over
to you secretaries thank you for
your time thank you assignment
thanks for changing your screen
because we're all jealous of the
beach madam secretary of the
committee Mike the other my
company should should pick it up
enough John may have to use it
when the given the third degree.
Thank you Mr chair members of
the committee so we really want
to start by thanking you all and
recognizing that the proposed
LESC budget for the economic
development department
represents an increase of over
nine percent perhaps our largest
recurring general fund expansion
and more than a decade so we're
super grateful for that and want
to recognize this as a
significant effort to promote
economic growth.
And in a normal year that would
be sufficient
and there would be little debate
but this is not a normal year
these are not extra these are
not ordinary times and our
budget request and the executive
budget recommendations for
fiscal twenty twenty three
reflects this.
The governor support for
economic development flows in
part from the just completed
twenty year economic strategic
plan called empower and
collaborate New Mexico's
economic path forward the plan
paints a clear picture of where
we are with the pandemic late
last year and where we remain
today those with professional
jobs health insurance and
Economic Security are doing much
better than those without.
Yes there has been a cruel
physical toll on everybody but
the under served and left behind
communities are bearing a larger
share of the economic cost the
renters service and frontline
workers those in jobs without
benefits or have health care
insurance and those that do not
have an economic nest egg.
The strategic plan calls on the
state to make economic
investments that will not just
get New Mexico back to where it
was before the pandemic but to
attain a long term
transformation into a
diversified resilient and
inclusive economy so today we're
asking you to come along with us
and our economic development
partners and to set a path
forward.
I'm going to highlight a few of
our accomplishments but I know
that there is time constraints
I'm gonna whip through the first
few pages and I also want to say
that I have been spending a
significant time on the border
along with NMDOT with that
Joseph Taylor as a and so any
questions also on the border I'm
happy to take.
Okay if you really quickly look
through this we have really had
our best year over five thousand
jobs and seventy four companies
supported by Lida.
When you look at the graph on
page three this shows you that
over the past since FY ten the
amount of jobs that we've been
able to create and like I said
really a banner year for EDD
just a few of those deals to
highlights and this Intel deal
was actually just recognized
yesterday by a major national
paper as being one of the best
economic development deals in
the United States seven hundred
permanent jobs at thousand
construction jobs and over three
point five billion dollars of
investment fight and tell blue
halo this is in Albuquerque
campus was sixty four jobs with
an average salary of a hundred
and five thousand dollars.
M. T. X. group average salary of
ninety to one seventy five
that's two hundred fifty Travis
green stream farms I was there
with Senator diamonds this is
twenty three jobs using an asset
down in Deming.
That we already had that had
gone vacant one of my favorite
yield WTC energy this is a three
hundred fifteen jobs and chamber
right now very rural area down
in southern New Mexico.
Arctic cold storage this is one
of the deals that we just
announced recently this is sixty
new jobs in the private
investment of thirty million
dollars there's also a trend
here the south is on fire right
now it's fantastic and what's
going on in China in the
political situation that Senator
Padilla referred to can be a
huge bill for New Mexico and
before the pandemic we did go to
Taiwan we have signed three
eight Taiwanese companies down
in Santa Theresa we expect to
sign two more thank you all for
the funding for the St Francis
extension I know we worked with
a lot of you individually on
that and with an MDOT that is a
game changer in that area in
terms of other requests for that
area we do have a federal
request in to expand the point
of Santa Theresa we also have a
request that is soon to come for
infrastructure funds for the
journey and I County Jack point
in order to expand and carry
cargo at that point
so I'm gonna turn it over to W.
secretary Clark to go through
all the details.
Thank you Mr chair members of
the committee us I just want to
echo the sectors comments that
we are very grateful for the
funding enough to you both of
the recommendations as you'll
see here at the top of page
eleven this is really important
for us because after you count
for inflation as well as a
designated uses of funds such as
J. to funding to actually run
our department is two point nine
million dollars less now than it
was a decade ago that's a
reduction of more than thirty
percent of we have an amazing
staff they've helped thousands
of people and businesses during
the pandemic but their capacity
is really maxed out and we need
more staffing and as you can see
here we have fifty two
authorized FTE versus seventy in
FY ten more funding for staff
enough appropriations will make
a huge increase in the number of
businesses number of communities
we can find outreach to and if
you move to slide twelve you can
see graphically how are FTE has
changed over time and you can
see that we dipped right after
the Great Recession and we
stated a very suppressed level.
Switching to slide fourteen.
Again the despite the the
staffing challenges we had a
banner year of the economic
development division there are a
few key differences between the
recommendations one of the
primary ones is FTEs the
executive recommendation as
eight versus five and you'll see
REC and I take even if we don't
get additional funding for the
for more FTE we would love to
have the additional FTE to give
us additional flexibility I know
just the other day you were
talking about high vacancy rates
in departments across the state
a new vacancy rates are often
twenty percent or more for a lot
of the large agencies we're at
six percent so at this point we
really could use additional
authorized FTE additionally of
the executive recommendation
puts an additional million
dollars into the base budget for
need to.
And as Simon Miller mentioned
provides funding for the jet I
minority business office
additionally this is really
important right now is we're
seeing a lot of companies look
to re shore from Asia to the
United States the executive
recommendation that's five
hundred thousand dollars for
international trade and foreign
direct investment.
US keeping real quickly to slide
sixteen this is the other
division EDD that really has a
significant difference between
the two racks bill C.
recommendation keeps the film
division flat the second
recommendation fully funds the
F. T. because the LFC
recommendation does not fully
funded the F. T. that we have
right now the text of a
condition also adds to funded
F. T. and one thing that we
really want to note about this
two FTE these two people would
help provide significantly
greater outreach to rural
communities help more
productions get out to regions
across the state the executive
recommendation also that's
wanted fifty thousand dollars
for minority filmmakers the rest
of the recommendations are
pretty similar so I want to jump
all the way to slide twenty two.
And here's where we see some
significant differences so first
I'll start with what's the same
both the LFC recommendation in
the executive recommendation of
ten million dollars for capital
outlay which is fantastic we
cannot describe how much we
appreciate that level of support
for main street we're also
thrilled that both
recommendations include seven
million dollars and special
appropriation for need to but
we're also asking for a lot of
other one time funding notably
including funding for marketing
the state to the started
industry that's really important
because right now we simply
don't have any money to market
to these nine target sectors as
well we're looking for money for
leader and money to operate the
new bioscience incubator the
money for a new film academy so
we would love to have
discussions with all of you
about how we can arrive at some
funding for these one time
appropriations as well thank
you.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Question from committee members.
There the then Senator Hemphill.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
to the presenters madam
secretary good to see you and
and W. secretary and all the
secretaries and everybody that's
just working really really hard
over there this is all very
fantastic stuff the only
question I had just really
around New Mexico vendors
providing services to the film
industry it just really seems
like it is a nut to crack to get
them you know some of these
companies that come in from out
of state that utilize a lot of
these incentives and lot of
these things that we make
available to them and it's it's
all really very good for the New
Mexico economy but I'm very
concerned that
you know security companies we
we talked earlier last year
madam secretary my recall about
some laboratories wanted to
comment testing for some of
these productions large
productions
No number other items so what
can we do to ensure that they're
utilizing New Mexico vendors and
they're they're not you know
price gouging or anything just
trying to get in the door with
some of these organizations
thank you Mr chair and
representative Cadena it is a
great question we do have a
website under the New Mexico
film office that you can
register as a vendor and that
site is actually use fire
productions and we do not make
any recommendations for Billy we
always say go to the website
there are vendors listed so I
would say the first
recommendation for your
constituents is definitely to
log on to that site and register
themselves so forty percent of
the budgets go to New Mexico
vendors right now I know that
there were some companies that
did wanted to comment testing
here there were some that are
were already established that
we're New Mexico companies it
became and very competitive of
opportunity for people but I
would always say if you feel
like you have a vendor within
your area that's not being
recognized please let me know
because we you know I I'll go
down there I'll see what's going
on I'll see what they or we'll
have our director amber dots and
do that and just really see how
we can help because that is the
key these that the production
companies don't get the
incentive in lessons in New
Mexico vendor so they are
incentivized to use New Mexico
vendors sometimes though we need
to do a better job in marketing
those people and Mr chair
Senator I would also add this
directly ties to our budget
request one of the two FTE that
we're requesting for the film
office is a business and
community outreach coordinator
and this person's job
specifically is to go and find
outreach to New Mexico residents
and businesses for jobs and work
within the industry thank you Mr
chairman thank you madam
secretary and deputy secretary
that's great news I'm so happy
to hear that but you'll have
dedicated head count to get New
Mexico companies in the doors
with in the door with these
these are I I really want to
see.
Yes with that script and and do
sixty percent New Mexico or more
I'm a we have these New Mexico
companies that could truly
benefit from this thing so I
hope that we're going to work
overtime to get them through
those doors and you know a lot
of times when I started my
business I didn't know anything
about how to you know whatever
so it would be really great to
to just you have a development
an on ramp program to get them
into the door with some of these
what what what is there a
specific steps taken I'm just
curious as to to tie these out
of state companies were also
showing up don't know who to
work with I mean you know
they're they're just you know
landing here getting the work
done do we have specific steps
that are taken and what are
they.
I'm Mr chair Senator PD the
specific steps that all of those
vendors need to take is
registered with the NMAA website
thank you and and they do and so
I I just you know and I've even
brought some of them to you to
to have these discussions so I'm
just with this this is not
working because we have only
forty percent of them dealing
with New Mexico companies so I
really need some help there.
At Mr chair US senator pia yes
absolutely we can take this
offline and we can talk about
those certain companies that
don't feel like they have been
serviced properly thank you
thank you Mr chairman thank you
madam secretary I really prefer
I know it's you know it's the
company's job as well to do
their part to get this done but
if you're willing to take that
extra step and I you're gonna
have some dedicated account I
think that's great thank you.
Thank you Mr chairman and thank
you secretary and deputy
secretary for the presentation
and all of your good work really
diversifying our economy and
bringing thousands of jobs to
New Mexico I couldn't be prouder
of the work that you've done and
I'm really excited that fared
just got their first leader
grant for fifty thousand dollars
for G. boys jerky and so I'm
just wondering as a legislature
what can we be focusing on to
really
bring and more of these lead of
funds to our rural community and
help to improve their economies
and in our rural communities so
us chairman then yes and the
members of the committee Senator
Hemphill I think the most
important thing right now is to
get more boots on the ground and
that's why you see our request
for more rural representatives
there's a lot going on in New
Mexico there's a lot of
opportunity and what I always
say is what you can do is help
us identify assets in your
community that might be sitting
vacant or opportunities because
you know your community the best
and we love to travel around and
we're hoping to do a lot more
after the house hopefully once
the numbers get a lot better but
just stay in contact with us and
I know we reached out to you on
the jerky deal we love going
down there our regional reps are
really plugged in so I would say
get to know your regional rep
they're talking to a lot of
companies down there even even
ones that don't necessarily need
leader tetap during during COVID
I think we were taking over two
hundred calls a day on our
hotline of just companies that
needed hand holding which is
like what are the federal
incentives what are the state
incentives how do I do this how
do I fill this out we still have
that hotline going on there are
more funds so.
please reach out we also have a
sustainable recovery.
Whole team that is taking these
calls and his hand holding
companies so please please
please reach out to us.
Go ahead Mr chair Senator I
absolutely agree some of the
sectors comments would you we
would love feedback from the
community it's really important
of reports on the ground but
also we need that funding for
for Lita and that's really
important because the OC
recommendation doesn't include
anything for traditionally to
projects it includes some
funding but it's it's carved out
in a way that we can't use it
for certain traditionally to
projects the executive
recommendation includes fifty
million dollars that we can use
both for traditionally to
projects as well as to provide
infrastructure it rural
industrial and business parks
because that's another really
important part of this is how
are we going to help businesses
expand relocate to a lot of
areas around the state if we
don't have that last mile of
infrastructure if we still need
roads water sewer before they
can start building their
facility.
Thank you for that response and
I was just curious do you have
the capacity to process the
leader requests right now what's
that process look like on your
end.
Mr chairman and senator we
absolutely do so we have not had
a lot of requests for this new
infrastructure yet we've done
three we do have eight million
dollars more in the pipeline
but we can easily handle
additional volume of requests
with additional regional reps
which included in both of the
recommendations what we really
need is the funding to actually
provide to those communities and
those businesses.
Thank you thank you Mr chairman
thank you Secretary.
Senator.
Thank you Mr.
I notice you contract services.
You're asking for another
million dollars there.
I'm sure you.
It's the same thing if you've
been telling us since you've got
here.
That
Your contractors your actual
contractors here the amount of
the contract in the services
they provide.
The national question Sir thank
you.
I'm gonna expand on that a
little bit we get all the
contracts for the film industry
and who they are and where
they're from and located out I
won't care so much about the
dollar amount one know what
their contracts maybe their
total contractors work where
they're from and where they're
located at that may help with
the food the problem.
Senator a Steinborn thank you Mr
chairman and madam secretary and
John and.
That is great to see everybody
an increase for madam secretary
to you and your team you know
I'm a big fan of work you're
doing and a lot of the
division's
the film office is just killing
it and acting the outdoor
division is just punching way
above our weight.
It's just if you take a look and
what the outdoor division is
doing for having one and a half
FTEs or whatever it is
unbelievable so
so anyway I want to want to
number one
Share with the committee I think
it's important that we support
the request for the Film Office.
Representative coming from
technically a rural area and
underserved film area I don't
know if everybody on this
committee right now with the
exception Senator Padilla comes
from an area that we change the
law that I work with all of you
on the administration to create
an extra incentive to actually
grow film outside of Albuquerque
and Santa Fe and call they call
it the up with some bills credit
but the thing about the film
industry I've learned is that
the production so we know you
exist there's a picture of a
location in your community then
I can show you a film production
that then they could put up on
the internet so I know one of
your request madam secretary I
think it's good to see is a
dedicated location person super
powerful because New Mexico we
really are one of the most
amazingly beautiful scenic
places on the planet every
corner of the state.
but we need to document and get
good pictures.
That share that in a location
person I sent with we do that
the business outreach also
business people would love to
play again and it's just such
big business opportunity but
they need to know how to do it
so I I see this other position
is being really helpful with
that so wanted to throw my
support to that and the other
thing madam secretary that may
not be on your radar the
southern New Mexico thank
connected to the outdoor
division is the Rio Grande
tribal this is a project that.
Statement talk about a long time
we finally created a commission
under the last governor to plan
a statewide recreational trail
multi use from Colorado to Texas
trails can bring in millions of
visitors to be big economic
development along the path and
trails is the number one thing
that.
Citizens say they want to the
state recreation plan so I know
with all the funding we've given
for trials let's talk back.
Part of that going toward
infrastructure on the Rio Grande
trail these just can be a great
marquee project for the state
and you might have so we're
doing your phone's going that
direction help with planning on
that I just want to flag that
for you all that I hope that
that's a project that we can
validate and make kind of a
flagship.
Outdoor recreation projects.
Mr chair if I may I failed to
mention the ACSI novice is on
the phone on zoom issues are
director of outdoor recreation
and amber dots in our film
director and mark Roper are EDD
director is also V. as in if
anyone has any specific
questions.
Mr chair that's all I have thank
you.
Senator.
Mr chair madam secretary.
First a I I'm I maybe just
confused so maybe you can help
me out here but I'm looking.
Through all of this stuff for
New Mexico partnership in
funding for them.
Where are the in order it in are
they part of your world yes
that's the first question.
So Mister chairman Senator the
recommendations are almost
identical for the New Mexico
partnership they get about a
million dollars in funding each
year through our department.
Mr you Fund in and so what it
meant something Mr chairman and
senator shared just if it's
helpful page eleven of your
packet contains a high level
of your different she packet for
the economic development
department and you can see
exactly where that New Mexico
partnership funding in both
recommendations is on line item
thirty two yes if that's a
little easier to visualize.
We're that we're the funding for
that is.
Thirty two okay.
Okay I I appreciate that because
well I was looking around and so
long there.
On in the film area here.
under the performance measures
a total gross receipts taxes
paid by the film industry in
millions.
So in twenty
of the twenty twenty two you had
twenty million dollars but then
in the future your projecting
zero.
Mr chair and senator I don't
have that that document I don't
have the the difference she
document I know there is a
problem with the performance
measures system when we were in
putting our requests some
measures were in there that were
never approved measures so that
may be one with that was an
error but we can certainly check
with our DFA in LFC analysts and
make sure that that's correct.
John.
That was when the disc jumped
out at me is why we given them
are we giving you all a hundred
or the film folks hundred fifty
million dollars and we're going
to get zero back that.
Field right release zero gross
receipts tax.
so yes I'd appreciate if
there's.
Something in that hole Mr
chairman Senator share are you
looking at the volume to
document yes okay
I think W. secretary Clark might
be correct we experimented with
a new budget system this year
and some things ended up in that
document that shouldn't be I'll
make sure you get an updated
copy of the actual approved
performance measures with the
consensus measures.
I didn't believe John ever made
in the state.
Mr Senator I certainly do but
this wasn't a mistake on our end
hi I make sure mistakes just
like everyone else.
So Mr chair in the and madam
secretary.
From volume three now on page
two a one I'm looking at to lead
a general fund.
so in twenty twenty it it's of.
Seventy nine million dollars and
now it's sixty.
Twenty twenty one sixty seven
million dollars well.
Struggling with that so.
What's the difference there and
why he said Mister chairman
Senator what you're seeing there
is only to funds even if they're
committed even if they are
encumbered the actual
uncommitted lead a balance today
is about eleven and a half
million of that eleven and a
half million about three and a
half million of that is
specifically set aside for a
Cibola McKinley counties so we
actually are very close to
running dry if we to funds that
have not yet been committed one
of the reasons why you see
higher lead a balances now than
you've seen in the past is that
we no longer give out all of the
we to bump up front we typically
give them out in tranches as
companies meet milestones we do
have a call back requirements
but the legislature and others
encouraged us to give out money
post performance and that's
exactly what we've done as
companies meet milestones they
get transfers of funds those
funds are committed but we are
still holding on to them until
they meet those milestones their
income third are the actual
balance that we have available
today is about eight million
dollars and if I may Mr chair
and senator share we have about
a hundred million dollars a
projects that were actively
tracking which could close in
the next six months.
Well I appreciate that and in
certainly economic development
is.
He.
I appreciate the outdoor
Representative part of all this
I think that's thank you very
important I do like the idea of
telling people where the
pictures were taken.
because I I see some of the
shows in the.
They may claim to be somewhere
but I recognize the landscape
around Santa Fe and they're here
they're not Intel's arousal or
anywhere else there here in but
there was you know.
Thank you Mr bungee they had a
picture of Shiprock up there of.
It's been nice somewhere in
near say Hey it should prompt
New Mexico.
because I think that actually
would help people.
Find those places.
So in the and I think that would
be part of certainly the.
The whole let's bring people to
New Mexico let him spend money
and.
And then go away so we don't
have to pay for Mr chair Senator
share that's a great idea
so currently we have the New
Mexico film logo at the end of
the movie and that's required in
order to get the the incentive
but I love that idea so if if
they won't do it on the tail end
of the movie we can always put
pages on our website so people
who are saying what were some of
the work was shot can look up
we're shut because we have such
iconic scenery here iconic
Townsend you know like Las Vegas
New Mexico is used all the time
and I'm watching Yellowstone
right now and I'm seeing a bunch
of New Mexico actors in New
Mexico scenes to and I know that
some antenna so
So I think it's a great idea
thank you.
All right Mr thank you.
Thank you senator sure
You know the question madam
secretary let me ask you about
the partnership.
I see the only created thirty
seven jobs are gonna look back
here real quick.
The partnership created a
hundred forty seven jobs lecture
that that's it.
Mr chair members of the
committee yes so those those are
their actual numbers that we
have been working to with the
pre partnership to the director
stepped down we have a new
director we have quarterly
meetings with them regarding
projects we also interact with
them I pretty much on a weekly
basis but yes those are the
numbers as the actuals and then
secretary John was a total over
all jobs created and economic
development.
Mr chair is over five thousand
for FY twenty one how many
people are staffing entities are
staffing the partnership.
Mr chair that's a great question
I believe it's seven but I need
to check on that for you.
So.
How do you feel about their
performance.
The fitting less than.
Mr chair members of the
committee we would I think that
our performance measures are
also measured within within the
context of the partnership
because they're supposed to get
two thousand is that right and
we're supposed to get two
thousand so it it.
It's disappointing I'll be
honest with you.
I mean there's sometimes things
change the partnership was
created to be here.
Reach out armory your honor
Morgan entertainment and have
people in and they can go out
and and talk to people at work
but didn't seem like they're
doing it that how long they've
been without director they Mr
chair members of the committee
they actually have a fantastic
director Melinda Allen right now
she was working under the
previous director and she did
travel with us to the space
symposium in Colorado springs
and we worked on that together
so and we're going to plan on
going to the next one together
also but I do think that we
really need to look at those
conferences and how they're done
and how they're paid for and
whether they're effective
I think sometimes they can be a
little old school in their
design we're not seeing a lot of
our EDOs
I'm actually replied to P. R.
owes
the system needs to be looked at
analyzed and indefinitely maybe
better.
We're gonna we're gonna take a
hard look and see the need them
anymore because and seem like
they're functioning very well I
have heard a lot of function
even I know some of the board
members and and I'll how many
people are vacancies we have on
that board.
Mr chair members of the
committee I think we currently
have two vacancies.
Thank.
in reference to Senator
Steinborn.
question about the outdoor
right.
I think there's plenty of their
sins by born there just forty
grants given to.
So that there's not a lot of the
load of workload in outdoor rec
center at the qualifying right
there.
Nothing against it is working
there just want to make sure
that we see that
let's talk about leisure.
tell us where you're on this
what you're on spent lead to.
And where's your commitment set
because I can't find that
anywhere in any reckon this you
know we're looking.
Mr chairman members when we do
our our quarterly report cards
we report that in there that's
not included in this package but
on I know that the secretary
would has the answer.
Mr chair really happy to send
you a spreadsheet showing
exactly what that breakdown is
but we have a roughly eleven and
a half million dollars
uncommitted entering half
million is specifically set
aside to legislation for Cibola
McKinley counties.
Mr chair up sorry right I was
just gonna say at it when we
send that spreadsheet we'll just
put it by industry as opposed to
by a project name or company
name just for NDA requirements.
Thank you yeah and maybe
location might help a little bit
County that city maybe County
yes Mr chair we can do that and
how long does it take a lead a
commitment to go through and and
that's our problem.
Wow that's Mr chair that's a
great question
we've had some deals that we've
gotten done from start to finish
from when we had the phone call
in three months other Wirth we
have had.
Probably a year once they go
past year we kind of put him on
a on a slow boil list and so we
don't consider those and less we
have made the commitment to them
and it's already encumbered I'm
not considering those and that
hundred million that we're
talking about a hundred million
is really people that we are
actively talking to on a weekly
monthly basis that have sent
multiple teams out here we just
met with the company just today
that this is their third time
out I was with the company early
this morning and it's you know
it's a super exciting virtual
reality company that is going to
be doing computing and not only
within the film industry but
doing
they are V. R. X. R. for AFRL
potentially and that you know a
lot of other companies so we
it's it's it's across the board
and it takes it takes weeks it
takes months sometimes takes a
year but once we don't hear from
them for a while we do put them
on put him on a different list
and so.
Maybe John those this how many
how many businesses are on that
list.
Mr chair yeah no members of the
committee I would say on our
active list is twenty right now.
And how many on the one year
over list.
Mr chair members of the
committee I would say probably
the same amount twenty and then
once we they disengage or what
we call them and they're not
doing anything or we just drop
them off.
There are few people that
are big big deals that
we have lost that have recently
told us that because of our
commitment in trying to get the
deal that they could be
interested in putting a facility
here in their next round of
funding so we will keep them on
the list.
That's right to keep asking for
more lead of money when you
don't even know the projects
going to come.
You're betting on the come in
and they're holding the money in
the state and we committed this
amount on it's not really
committed you just keep on the
list that's not our number list.
So I'd like to see that complete
list and how many projects have
have failed or failed to
complete in leader with the job
performance or and how much and
how much of those cities and
counties in default leader
projects kicked back to the
state I don't see any reversions
anywhere and we ever yeah Mister
chair members of the committee
I'm actually going to ask if
mark Roper could be made
panelists because he has those
exact figures and I think we
have had
to to clawbacks in the last year
but I want to check with mark
mark are you there.
Yes so we.
Shusterman those members of the
committee.
from that perspective the we
have you have to projects.
Did you complete each other
activities while that the
hundred percent of the money one
project is rating on now pre
project the.
Fifty thousand dollars the other
one was kind of plastic.
A project.
Two million dollars.
we also had two projects in the
Los crucis area failed to meet
their original commitments and
money was numbers first one was
In the back back to school to be
distributed elsewhere and in
those two projects totaling one
million dollars
S. W. secretary drugs a our
current
balance is eleven million
dollars
which three point five million
as is specifically dedicated to
countering Cibola County.
the secretary keys's talking
about over
that
so obviously if we don't get any
additional funding we would be
able to make offers to those
communities and some of the
current and former money's more
to come back that sounds right
now we don't anticipate and we
don't see a
future.
And and March and you're on
there how many companies have
failed to meet their metrics
because I know of one right now
that has failed to meet their
metrics and I haven't seen them
in a call back at all.
I'm not sure which company
you're talking about there there
is
currently one one company that
is located
in the central part of New
Mexico currently stressing.
The.
That would have.
but I don't have any current
compliance one there and we have
also one in southern added
counties currently on.
Lowcock up flying because I know
there's one they're supposed to
have a hundred employees by.
Prior year and and five cars in
the parking lot so I'm John.
What aren't you telling us.
It may get you fired but I want
to hear.
Mr chair one thing I didn't
mention was that are you brought
up the subject of a versions we
use the money that we're given
the EDD had an unfortunate
history of reverting large
amounts of money for about a
decade it we were typically
reverting three hundred four
hundred sometimes over five
hundred thousand dollars a year
which for a department smallest
hours a significant two years
ago we set a record low with the
reversion of about fifty
thousand dollars and last year
we broke that with the reversion
of about forty thousand dollars
so we are using the staff that
you're giving us we're using the
money they're giving us then let
me ask you about leading need to
because I I seen where the the
the faster job in New Mexico
last year was about thirty nine
thousand.
And why did that almost double
and triple.
Sir Mr chairman the cost per job
is not our favorite measure
because for one thing it
considers all projects is being
equal and all projects aren't
equal we are willing to provide
better incentives for projects
to go to rural areas so one of
the metrics that we look at and
that we added as a performance
measure was what's the value of
this job that's being recruited
compared to the county wage in
that area because that's one
thing we really want to consider
we don't want to just recruit
jobs to Albuquerque but also
we're willing to give better of
a better the to move proportions
to companies to find and find
significant investment provide
better wages better south better
benefits to their employees so
we really can take a look at the
project as a whole every project
goes to an economic impact
analysis and we don't do a
project in less the economic
impact analysis says the state
gets back its money.
And and so I'm looking at some
of the performances and New
Mexico visits to New Mexico for
projects managed by New Mexico
partnership.
Only nine the twenty twenty one.
Mr chair members of the
committee that does not
represent the numbers of visits
that
are.
Performed with EDD staff that is
just for through the New Mexico
partnership.
And then I see him in most
places the same companies trying
to lead a time to need to have
time to other incentives in the
department I mean if we pick one
company and could you give us
the overall cost with Lida J.
tip in any other tax incentives
is that they're getting.
Mr chair members of the
committee yes we do have
numerous incentives including
late NJ tip high wage so we are
able to document that and we
don't have it with us right now
but if you want to ask a few
questions than not we're happy
to get you that information.
to to be given back their lives
we'll get you a couple names can
give us a total cost of the
state costs including G. R. T.
tax credit whatever whatever
we're giving them into what the
total cost for job is is then
then you have to score some
points on how you're gonna score
other than total jobs this is
Mister chair as it's going to
note if we're looking at tax
credits we can't do it on an
individual project basis because
of confidentiality but we could
aggregate.
I think we can look at a pretty
simple if you just take the
Intel which is in your
presentation and what tax
credits they're getting how much
the given and I think just in
five million may be wrong but
thank you in total up there
their total tax credits and can
see for plant that's already
here structure but they're doing
remodeling or additions or
whatever they're doing we want I
want to begin to start seeing
some of those total score costs
in in C. were really at.
Yes Mr chair will take a look at
that.
Take a look good night.
anything else.
Secretary of state there for the
spaceport.
You want to do them next Mr
chair I know we have director
Scott McLaughlin on the line but
I'm happy to stay at the seat
for the spaceport either way if
you just want him online either
way.
Ma'am the woman.
chairman sorry let me get to my
page
All right spaceport authority is
agency for ninety five
from the executive weekend have
Simon Miller filling in for
Diego Fernandez and director
Scott McLaughlin joining us the
as soon and the secretary for
any additional questions.
So.
As you all know the spaceport
has faced some pretty
significant personnel and
administrative challenges in the
last few years that new
spaceport leadership has
addressed many of these
challenges the space point
latest audit time zero findings
all six findings from the
previous year's audit have been
addressed
the biggest thing for the
spaceport budget if you look at
the different sheets you'll
notice that the spaceport
request reduced revenue to the
agency pretty significantly
Spaceport leadership previous
spaceport leadership had
anticipated much higher revenues
and those have not been right
sized so both the executive and
the LFC recommendations
supported that reduction.
Overall the LFC recommendation
included about two hundred
thousand dollars more general
fund revenue for the spaceport
authority than the executive all
that funding was in person of
both recommendation
significantly increase general
fund to the agency to replace
access pledges revenue from Dona
ana and Sierra counties that
revenue was deemed by the
Attorney General are not
available for operational use.
AGFC did adopt the LFC
recommendations.
Mr Miller do you have anything
to add.
Thank.
Sure members of the committee I
do not have any access.
Just over eighty thank you.
Your presentation but.
Sorry.
We're gonna try to run through
your presentation pretty quick
so yes.
As the chairman of the committee
I am presentation saucer
administrative and I will run
through quickly.
So
we see see that now.
Yes.
Okay okay
skip over what we're gonna do
all these Google pictures top
pictures up there is also
no one's talking about that and
that is the bottom pictures when
we get into sunbirds combined
and or from the dais that was
kind of a shopping trip and then
they came back to us and I'll
talk about that a little more in
a few minutes
the budget
Simon
on everybody's mind what we feel
we would more on the
the general fund appropriation
of every place in the final
point reduction of.
LFC recommendation we do this
actually just on the
supplemental there's a one time.
It is from also is here is from
last year so the recommendation
plus some one million which is
our our our **** to.
Act one million we just need
store vaccines or was one time
supplemental.
completed here Representative
losses and finished projects our
budget because tied up
businesses question even held
back a lot of our projects held
back on hiring so that we can
get that fixed really do many
quicker on a thanks we are sixty
percent customers wanted to
reinforce that so it's hard to
tell from.
From the tables that come in
from a government because.
From LESC and others because it
kind of looks like we're not
funding has our sister site has
funded we are non reverted HSD
so we do carry over some more
money really to do that and have
tremendous structure that we
for all our customers we also
our very revenue and other
instances of I have a fund
balance there is no way to
prevent from having come back to
provided over and over.
To fix for us so
I will say that our officials
received process word right
after cope with this issue in
almost two years is really slow
down for months and then
we moving fast a lot of our
customers were requesting to
come of this I.
see moving quickly I will
highlight the space shuttle is
we are applying together with
some other on its season in New
Mexico or some build back better
we made it to shore this is for
your future.
Senator.
Proposals down about sixty
proposals so we are part of that
reduce Mexico central New Mexico
community college and others and
this is really highlighting the
fact that New Mexico is
come in and legislation we came
back from a conference recently
or maybe less said that
spaceport America wins the space
for our state.
Was really Sierra for other
states are also in the sort of
economic development were
ordered.
we did some higher rated.
New business development
director
and a few other hires most
hiring these can help now this
question about.
we are for
level.
Another subject so tablet lines
we did get some project
management support or online
contract project management
that's allowed us to do much
quicker Senator knows when we
were out you had lots of
questions about where wide
extended we are now working hard
several projects
and I want to see those fees.
what she was talking on the
phone I want to thank
legislature's because we have a
product so think about hostages
where we are so something that
is enable real.
Customers are seeing more and
more.
so when they come out in the
this runaway
Lana Turner is the other
recruitment or something
tangible that is you know after
and we're we're we're
means go over all the stuff.
we.
Here's programs I won't go
through all those Virginia Act
did have lots of space launches.
In a lot of the still needed
They're not issues Senator says
a lot so there one way under
instruction is there are states
and if you look at the list here
is just a long list of other
customers Senator last twelve to
eighteen months and we're just
State University.
Also cited customers come to all
highlight the numbers with area
two weeks nine of sixteen and
about seven people and I see
your C. R. or over to the
so that's huge economic impact
for that area.
He.
the other when we look at
We're going to talk about virgin
galactic.
This is
usually I get ready to have a
new.
Coming up next season that is
but the big thing about it is
there funding.
yes to second station they're
working right now on the way to
this they're not operators.
Backs Elijah see in the bottom
here there's a whole series of
testing and then it'll go to
space sometime later in twenty
twenty two in the informers
appropriations to station and
career after twenty twenty three
I'm not a case study still not
planning also looking forward to
various into the year versus
twenty three.
Senator stellarator picture of
the statue of liberty years of
approximately the scale of the
accelerators you can see what
how big is our right Seattle you
Senator so this was over to
Europe it's the largest
evacuated structured world.
inside expenses modify
two three so far with the
projectiles as we want the last
one I think one more response to
thirty thousand the so there's a
lot of your time this is doing
that and I'm very happy to see
to see there's just to the south
your member there's been a lot
of news articles about provided
that it was impossible that were
actually Garcia uncertainty.
this is a Los Alamos national
labs partnership of hers so uses
a lot of.
because of
Us all to work together Los
Alamos realized they could come
to a experiment of the normal in
the Pacific at hospice vitamin a
money thank you and for one
million dollars so this is.
A long term partnership for many
lodges we also have another
launcher
something up and you're going to
have on that partner with a
company called Celestis less is
actually touches of the State
Street global space business
model that they use for a other
rockets it is places and they
will have two hundred one side
versus a four day so it's not a
nice economic impact.
here's our launches.
Other just add.
There is one we've got for a
couple years you're obligating
back.
The human donor facility and
other maintaining the facility
and I have a second back from
new larger version of what we're
seeing right now is on the
twenty twenty three so everyone
of our customers very happy to
have on when they come back on
site.
On site at any time you it's us
there is a small this is the and
we're talking about a future
Mexico and.
Each
other customers state to state
contractor next.
and they're testing the testing
your system Office you
automatically.
order covers architecture we
need to partner with Iraq.
Association we've had to cancel
one twenty million would return
last year and has brought back
about fifty thousand students on
site this is a.
Of course a lot of Senate and
workforce development we're
trying to get.
The people cited about the state
of Mexico workstation America
and lots of we feature jobs so
also if you're gonna have
questions for and I will say
also I Reuters is operation
reminders on and also answers
questions and I apologize
I'm not from
general coffee of course.
And I'm fine.
Well it's never good to hear the
and you're doing good that's the
main.
questions from committee
members.
Their words you want your ashes
yes.
Could I get a recording.
A notice Sir I noticed that your
contract services you're asking
for quite a bit more money for
that.
Could you elaborate on the need
for that.
On a and you're more of an issue
so Senator chairman of the
contracted services.
As a matter of right sizing
the budget based on what was
done before and so primarily are
are not services for fire and
security a sentence on site full
time so I believe that is
some more order four and a half
million dollars four million
dollars in the other parts of
the R. for meetings to services
we offer
for example when we have our own
choices you all water to Thomas
or whitewater treatments is I
have made it available to
spouses or partners on to
address.
And your mom would you like at
eight.
Your.
The storm the.
Mr chairman members of the
committee and the chairman of
the house has exactly one.
The services are needed I want
to see.
legislative committees similar
of sewage water our.
Our customers.
The tables.
All of us.
Providers contractors.
Mr chair that's exactly what I'd
like to have the list of those
contractors the the.
Amount of the contract and the
services they purpose find.
And I found it very interesting
that you said that you find your
own electricity at the site.
Mr chair not a question just
offended interesting they
provide their own electricity at
the site.
Mr chair Senator I might we we
originally this morning for a
substation and that is from that
sub station which is operated
now by the.
Sierra County co op we don't
have any miles of line item in
the wrong the space or are
partially underground one status
as a generous thanks for there
are a hundred around and they
run throughout the state for so
we maintain those lines
underground lines with a
contractor and with some of our
own staff okay that makes sense
thank you Mr thank you Senator
you're not.
Thank you Mr chair so I'm I'm
just looking at.
At the.
The the just a virgin galactic
numbers here so it appears that
six hundred tickets sold two
hundred fifty thousand dollars
each.
It's a hundred and fifty million
dollars.
When we just charging ten
percent then all for the whole
budgets covered.
Could be enterprise on.
Mister chairman Senator share is
that a question for me or for
doctor McLaughlin.
I think it's a question for the
world okay.
What it does it does appear to
me that there's certainly
opportunities chairman what we
see what we've heard since the
spaceport was created is we've
missed our target we need more
money.
In your after here I mean we
could just like Senator Woods to
discuss play that one recording
of everybody I think you could
play the same recording every
year to but as I'm looking at
some distance and when white
white isn't this.
The revenue generator.
It just as a business.
It seems like it seems like it
could be based on some of the
other things we talk about so
the things and.
In this slide.
It just seems to me that.
You all should be paying the
states that the other way around
Mr chairman members I'm happy to
defer to you Secretary keys but
I would note find it for you in
your volume three there is a
sources and uses page that shows
the revenue that the spaceport
brings in the HSD is generating
some revenue a decent amount as
director McLaughlin said about
sixty percent of their funding
is revenue generated so there is
revenue being generated it
hasn't quite become a fully
enterprise agency the way that
we refer to enterprise agencies
words of fully self sustained
but I'm happy to defer to
secretary keys for further
comment Mr chair Senator share I
think that when the spaceport
was envisioned it was way before
its time and we are currently in
that year where the state space
port facility has finally caught
up to the technology and as
we've all seen these space ships
are launching so do we need to
do a better job of recruiting
additional companies besides
virgin galactic besides spend
lunch absolutely and Scott and
his team have been doing a
wonderful job they do have a new
sales director right now we work
with them hand in hand we go to
the right places we have an
opportunity here I hear what
you're saying
but I also feel like the
spaceport is an asset and we
have it and it's built and it's
timely so that's why we spend so
much time down there and.
I go down there quite a bit
and I do see the amount of money
that circulating throughout two
years C. Andoni and county from
those people being there and I
it's the.
That's it's not easy as we've
talked about before to attract
economic development into those
more rural areas and I just
don't think right now we have
this asset it's time to really
hit and really try to get more
people in there and
and just to support the need.
So Mr chair madam secretary I'm
just kind of random pick this
one here son glider.
are they there now are they
doing things now are they paying
rent now.
Mr chair members of the
committee all refer to executive
director Scott McLaughlin for
that.
Mr chair Senator test of
sunlight or is there two years
ago we work with.
For about six months to finding
the type of site
and one of the largest site or
run away on their own buildings
in their hang your loans three
hundred feet by eighty feet they
lost twice to twenty twenty
years ago the sixty thousand
seat to prove that a song
Environment work.
And and then on into a moment
our partner softei and the
meeting on in this is our most
redesign and rebuilding the
system and solar power and
ideas basically a cellphone this
guy and so they are paying rent
right now and they're going to
come back sometime next year
with the new version of the
cider and eighty five million
dollars by becoming a certified
while there you will have on we
expect forty to fifty people and
in the long term goal is that a
new manufactured in Mexico their
plan long term plan for the.
system running when I want to
build on the successes that an
active cell phones is guide and
what they're designed to do is
five or six months at a time so
that they carry on matters solar
power to the for example fly
over a devastated by her created
by to do cell phone numbers and
they can also apply a cell phone
and internet coverage of rural
areas here Representative and
they're one of the long term.
Finally if you have trouble
finding tenants who are going to
be here long term but the east
and west coast is a very proud
of this and it is based on an
idea in your losses this spans
coastlines so we expect over the
years that we will continue to
see more customers and tenants
so Mr chair and and madam
secretary so I I I see this the
the cell phone industry I think
that's great they need to have
one between Farmington and up
Bernalillo so that I can talk on
the phone.
But help.
If you're talking about
manufacturing here as well.
This is the economic development
department say Hey let's let's
recruit these manufacturers as
well in the let's do this the
film industry go out there and
build a little old western town
so you can go from eighteen
whatever to two thousand
whatever in a matter of minutes
of I just whatever of but I
would like to see things tied
together engine what I'm afraid
of is that the so many things
stand alone.
And I and I think we can tie
things together but I also think
that this definitely could be an
enterprise of department this
this really.
More than paying for itself but
just looking at some of these
numbers here and of course you
won't be careful you raise the
price so high that the wrong way
but.
But
But we have that we have the
airspace.
That they don't have on the east
and west coast.
And we so we need to be
protective of that but I also
encourage us to find ways to
make this.
Generate revenue is supposed to
cost Representative.
And Mr chair US senator we do
have a proposal and I'm not
speaking out of turn
confidentiality into virgin
galactic's to spot to have their
manufacturing here so we are
hoping to get that.
But with there is a lot more
collaboration that has happened
in the past and Scott and I have
a call every week and I'm also
the chairperson of the spaceport
so it's between the border and
spaceport I'd say that's
probably sixty five percent of
my time right now.
Thank you Mr chair.
On one of the one of the pieces
something like.
Space Senator faces up to four
liters and so while I'm
gold bring more revenue to be
nice to the point where we're
not using any money from the
state the we have to look at the
full extremity of state from Los
Alamos labs in the US and other
forced laboratory and that is
universities the state
department when we companies
come a look at that completed a
system of when they're trying to
decide be here so the space part
acts as a as a brand and its has
developed outside an operation
side they're also looking at
where they can set up shop in
with the whole state so I I like
to I don't like focus just on
the space for
all state and we are coming very
good destination people to come
and set up shop and small
companies that's kind of our
programs we do want to get more
tennis for long term benefits
Ross is trying to be a system of
state of New Mexico.
Thank you Senator Steinborn.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr chairman and Scott
good to see you and secretary to
see again and on a serious note
kind of I the interesting hot
topic that's come up and and
senator share this was to your
point about the ten percent tax
actually the bill in the
legislature to tax tickets
purchased for virgin galactic in
fact it's a bipartisan bill by
Representative Harper
Representative McQueen that is
germane is moving.
But
So we can stipulate the people
buying these tickets have plenty
of money.
And and I think the tax
according to the news piece that
was done on it would equate to
about thirty four grand a ticket
you do the math on the amount of
tickets purchased I think
actually that could close the
deficit what we pay in all
seriousness so madam secretary
Mr chair I'm curious I mean I
know we want to be attractive
for virgin customers I know that
we have competition blue origin
in Texas and I don't.
I don't know Texas has a sales
tax or not you probably know
that blue origin but I'm just
curious your thoughts on that
proposal in all seriousness
it makes sense to me so I'd love
to hear your thoughts on that.
Mr chair members of the
committee and Senator Steinborn
it there's always a balance
between being the stewards of
the taxpayers money and
and also promoting business so
we are actually as
administration related meeting
about that tomorrow morning so I
think it's a little premature
for me to say anything right now
but I will follow up with you.
Okay thank you very much and
You know that's all I have for
now thank you Mr.
Thank
know I was sitting with the
executive did the state court
the other day and I asked him I
said why don't you go for a ride
and he's in no way.
So that may tell us something a
little bit.
if you want to write it all I
want to get a free one.
So that's interesting to me.
We have a problem in New Mexico
we made a big investment.
And now we're just settle with
this investment that just time
keeps late on and on and on I
don't have a space for directors
of been there wasn't here when
that happened maybe Senator
Campos as well I guess I can
count for the five.
On the two hundred and fifty
million dollars investment.
Compass you know that.
The.
And the problem is.
This is the real problem as I
see it as a businessman New
Mexico you need a business
developer and spaceport well and
I I know Scott's background is
it in aerospace and all that but
you need a business development
guy in your FTEs those
attracting whatever Canada the
spaceport and and move move
forward it's version maybe get
there some day going to be
another twenty years and a long
slow ride into space because
everybody else is B. this.
Origin and in van horn right
maybe this
maybe in the wrong place but or
to maybe in Florida what's the
one the Amazon guy has and then
our they've all beat us there.
And so they know people know
where they can get tickets and
and launches are happening and
we just haven't done that yet
New Mexico and it's a it's a
tough deal to do space period.
Scott.
Yes Scott let me ask you some
questions.
what is the Thunderbirds pay us
for for being there for two
weeks.
Got money for fuel cells we also
got money from the time and
there is well over a hundred
thousand dollars fifty thousand
dollars.
So.
This is a they told us was one
of the most effective winter
training exercises I've ever
had.
When it is a right now we have
about exterior and they needed
extended past two weeks so it
was
It was a.
It was a great day at also
landed on other sites they
tested on other sites but they
are chose us and have a great
experience.
getting back to the you just for
a moment just remember that we
actually would revert stating on
the space so maybe we need more
to but when we talk about some
normal mortgages are prepared to
drive both companies we're very
related in one way estimated at
all from and remember largest
ones funded by just basically
kind of a almost no limited on
streams and they still wanna
years later from when the
senators so you know that
actually that's basically our.
But we're very happy to have you
join a state license here and
plan is three times a month
starting next January.
Thank you for so could determine
how much with the contract was
going to be with the
Thunderbirds.
that tracked and who agree to
that price.
So we we do that it's it's it's
difficult to decide what to
charge our our customers were
not charged for.
You know.
Are not standard so you to look
around the world country across
the state charters we determine
what we think the market compare
in terms of what's desirable
Crisis the Thunderbirds a
renters the ram and runaway
twice is a I also love the
spaceport operations center and
so
And they had again seven people
there I also had we would set up
a separate payers in repairs so
as a with the I am very
successful.
Projects for us.
The federal government has
ability to print money raise
your rates.
I don't know what landing fees
are uncertain aircraft by weight
so that I think we should we
should start and this is exactly
why you should have a business
person there and operations with
the so you go senator reduces
yeah we did I'm sorry excuse me
we did us six hundred seventy
eight hundred buses element
director in just a few weeks ago
there are monsters we are headed
in the right direction.
The very happy later on this
year is responsible for that
hello.
So out of out of everything that
has happened to the spaceport
how much revenue to generate
this just take one year over one
year period with all the
launches including taking your
ashes to space which of.
That knows a thing now.
It is Senator chairman yes this
is a no sauce.
As a business models to work
well.
But we're generating all around
reference is usually dollars
you're not going to.
And your current a five million
dollar contract in that in that
two million dollars shortfall I
think so we're not quite there
yet your capital projects seem
to be very delayed very long
periods of time I don't why that
works not getting done you have
in capital outlay projects have
other programs in various stages
and conceptual design detailed
engineering funds because we
don't know what that is that's
just we're hiding something let
us forgive us more money
this element where are we at
madam secretary with virgin
galactic's lease in item one
number we gonna target in their
rent so that we don't have to
subsidize spaceport anymore.
Mr chair members of the
committee we have yet to start
renegotiating that lease we are
giving the need a little bit of
space with regards to their next
launch to go ahead and do that
so that we have a better
understanding of what's going to
happen and they have a better
understanding of what's going to
happen and how many spaceflights
they'll have per month per year
we did go and visit them the
relationship is still fantastic
and so we will start it but we
negotiating that sin that
provide better relationships
fantastic with the the least
they have a memory has a red and
want something to read other
than the lection bill we're
gonna have Fridays there some
that is a one sided lease that's
not designed in our favor and so
I expect that that lease should
be revenue positive for the
spaceport.
do you have Scott and then we
chat about this do you have the
resources to negotiate that
lease.
this very hard to get in some
more apt to use on we would like
more FTEs supposed to get to
twenty eight right now we have
invented a dedicated.
The staff of the committees for
do you have any with that
anybody in the in the in there
with expertise on lease
negotiations for leases.
But I would say that we don't
have I expertise rely and we've
been talking internally about
whether we contract that out on
the talking secretaries about
how we can do that either
jointly or find some way to get
that done but I I agree to the
it's a complex disease secretary
says.
Radio the Pentagon but lacks
business model which is very
over the years and so if you
give them a little more time is
is is okay when they come back
with the second station and it
is a total of twenty twenty
three o'clock better idea of
what's going to happen.
Well I believe that the as we
told the next year next year
next year next year for for ten
years and and and it hasn't
happened so.
I don't be surprised if we give
you a supplemental for as a
business person so that you can
begin to attract business into
business way not in a way in the
sea of comes over the hill from
the east to the west to money's
a spaceport and then to give you
some expertise in the lease
negotiations and operating
expenses and how you based of
those fees so you have the
expertise to become.
Revenue neutral or are your own
positive because we can no
longer wait on one person to
save us at the spaceport we have
to move past that right now.
It it's done and over with
virgin galactic is going to do
it then let him do it but we can
no longer subsidized at two
hundred fifty million dollar
infrastructure project in New
Mexico with ten million dollars
additional here and if you add
that up you know we're roughly
three or four hundred million I
pretty close to eight hundred
million dollars in interest and
everything else we had to pay
and so it is just getting old
and and somebody's got to fix it
maybe centered I'm gonna be on
the spaceport board and and can
fix that for but something has
to happen for New Mexico there
its way too long we waited on
one person and and it's going to
change Scott how much does it
take to how much does it cost to
send your ashes to space.
Fairman the senators Kamala Khan
the Celestis website but it's on
the order to the three thousand
dollars for a sophomore from
lunch but I should add that Miss
America space launch again this
this is on one of a long term
customer to do scientific
missions when they have a
picture of the space the native
contract with this company and
they have sent me this will be
the second time we've had a
hundred space for.
Well that if anybody goes
missing the space part I don't
think we'll ever find them just
look up in this guide yes
that's very interesting that we
went from a model to take a lot
of people into space and now
we're taking actions into space
for for that amount of dollars
of investment I understand it
people rate I guess if they for
some I can't complain but very
interesting about taxes I'm
secretary of meaning that.
I know Mr chair thank you for
your support and also the
additional funding for the space
part.
We'll see on the space for
funding goes but we have to
change the model is based it's
just it's just kind of thank you
for more precision timing
everything today.
All answers and on answered
answers.
Okay.
Plus your next.
Do you know what.
Okay.
If you are if the governor puts
all the secretaries back in the
jail cell will will try to break
it up.
Please present maybe some space
technology to do that.
All right Mr chairman again all
right Mr chairman members of
this is I believe the last
agency on the agenda again
Amanda Dick Peddie with the LFC
from the executive we are joined
by Donna Rivera on soon and from
the office of superintendent of
insurance we have superintendent
Russell told.
I'm go over very high level two
elements of this office of
superintendents budget and it
does make up the majority of the
difference between the LFC and
the DFA section for
recommendations for more details
you have the.
Different she packet that shows
program by program the
differences inner compass we
chair for one minute.
Thank you thank you Mr chair so
do it health care affordability
fund was created in twenty
twenty one it's a fund intended
to be used to make health care
more affordable and accessible
for individuals and small
businesses the tax revenue
department collects the surtax
for fund revenues some of that
fund goes to some of those us
Sir tax revenues go to the
general fund some go to the
health care affordability find
but the office of the
superintendent of insurance is
charged with managing the fund.
So I'm always side begin
stakeholder meetings to design
it the program in FY twenty one
and requested two million
dollars from the health care
affordability fund in their
recurring budget to contract for
actuarial modeling and financial
and policy services.
The LFC recommendation included
seven hundred fifty thousand for
this purpose from the health
care affordability fund well the
executive recommendation
supported the full two million
dollar request.
In December after conducting
thorough analysis I I requested
eighty additional sixty five
million from the healthcare
affordability fund for
initiatives to reduce premium
costs for small businesses and
individuals.
This is the biggest difference
between the LESC and the
executive recommendation.
The executive recommendation
included this full sixty five
million dollar appropriation
from the health care
affordability fund in the base
budget.
Because the request was
submitted after the LFC budget
was approved house appropriation
and finance committee is
considering this is a special
request to become referring in
the next fiscal year.
The second program I'd like to
review very briefly is the
patient's compensation fund
I think everyone's pretty
familiar with patients
compensation fund I will let the
superintendent elaborate on
questions but the LFC
recommendation does include
thirty million dollars from the
nonrecurring funding to help
address solvency indication
compensation fund.
that being said I can turn it to
Donna for for the comment before
we go to the superintendent
please proceed.
Members of the committee on.
He had a vision just
clarification on thirty.
Patient comments I was general
fund funded SBHCs the LFC
recommended because
this is
sort of.
General fund
that the committee in.
Thank you very much.
Thank you
you Mr chairman members I
apologize if I wasn't clear I
didn't mean to conflates the
health care affordability
provide and the patient
compensation fund of the LFC
recommendation it includes a
thirty million dollars of
general fund revenue to address
solvency for the patient
compensation fund that is in
what would be section ten of the
LFC nonrecurring.
Recommendation thank you.
Mr superintendent please thank
you Mr chairman Madam chairman
members of the committee it's
good to be.
Meeting with you frankly it's
going to be meeting with
anybody's this.
but I'm.
The specially appreciative of
the opportunity to speak to you
because this.
Committee notably has been very
supportive.
Of our efforts over the last two
years to really turn the office
of the superintendent of
insurance.
Around.
I'll just leave it at that but
there was a lot of turning
around that needed to be done
and you've been very supportive.
if you look on your first page
the second page of sensitive
handout.
We generated almost two million
dollars
For the consumers of New Mexico
on insurance through our
consumer systems here on managed
healthcare bill.
But I think you're also aware
that we were able to negotiate
rebates from auto insurers to go
back to New Mexicans that
number's not reflected here but
it was in excess of sixty five
million dollars so we're going
to continue those kinds of four.
Something that's particularly
meaningful to me.
Which I think.
Has to do with the fact that
when I first.
Looked at what was going on in
the art department they had on a
lot it was sixteen findings
which is.
Totally unacceptable and this
year for the first time in ages
we received a not qualified
audit with zero findings.
For state fiscal year twenty one
and we want to thank my staff
movements such an outstanding
effort to ensure that we got our
house in order.
We also got a full five year
accreditation.
For work from the national
association of insurance
commissioners I want to assure
you that that is not a rubber
stamp.
In the this past month the HSD
put two states are
appropriations.
But we flew through with flying
colors.
We increase the dramatically
increase the number of low cost
or.
No closed health plans on the be
well New Mexico New Mexico
health insurance.
Our platform using the new rate
guidance and we were helped of
course by the federal action on
this.
There's a big difference in
terms of affordability and
finally just to give you a
breath.
What we do we licensed over
three thirty one hundred
companies.
We managed to licensed over two
hundred twenty three thousand
active producer licenses.
However we did not have any
space exploration projects this
past year.
One thing we do do as many of
your order is that we updated
and we're much more timely on
regulations.
When I took office I was
surprised to find.
That the office had a practice
of essentially ignoring
legislative mandates so you
would pass a piece of
legislation legislation that
directly impacted the insurance
industry.
And for whatever reason the so I
never issued any regulations on
those statutes we are now doing
that within the year.
We're trying to be very timely
about that and we're also doing
it in an open.
fully engage process and that is
resulted in better regulations.
Better action by the insurance
industry and certainly more
satisfied customers.
You see on slide three that we
are totally self funded.
we generated a projection is
seventy eight million dollars
for the next fiscal year and we
only keep a portion of that but
we're not asking for general
funds have not and will not.
So excited for you see what we
requested.
The what the recommendations
from both LFC and DFA are there
some notable differences both of
which have been highlighted.
Sh main one having to do with
the health care affordability
fund.
Senator words I know you instead
in current practice.
Our most of our contracts are
used for actuarial services and
we're trying to change that so
that we can actually have our
own actuary.
But as you might imagine we've
been battling with the state
personnel office I'm doing that
position approved and approved
at the appropriate salary level
to be able to recruit.
The other two million that you
see that we requested in the
contracts line was specifically
for the health care
affordability fund so that money
was for them would not come for
me the general fund revenues.
the regenerate but they would
come from the affordability fund
itself.
So in terms of what we're asking
on slide fund.
My predecessor gave up almost
thirty six positions.
And we're still trying to
recover from that.
That's why we asked for such a
large number of positions.
We're requesting that you
approved the LESC
recommendation.
But that you increase the
position current.
Two hundred and six instead of
one oh two or one of three.
we're not asking for additional
funding we think we can manage
it within our personal budget
but we need to her position
turned out to be able to.
We're fully staffed.
As was pointed out by the
analysts.
We strongly support the LESC
recommendation for additional
thirty million dollars.
For the compensation
compensation fund I want to
clarify that would that money is
to be used to offset the deficit
the positions are responsible
for this is not an underwriting
of hospital money's.
Without this thirty million
dollars
the range that we would have to
charge physicians to participate
in the malpractice fund would be
exorbitant and it would we
believe would cause them.
To the restrictor practice or
move their practice.
And then finally.
We want to finish up your
talking about the affordability
fund requested sixty five
million this is Donna noted that
because we did not finish.
We're getting our financial
estimates from the consultants.
We did not get that request in
the LESC on November one they
wanted it.
We'll take responsibility for
that we did the best we could
but just could not make the
deadline.
So on the next slide you do see
some explanations what is.
The affordability fund is Amanda
rightly noted.
The twenty twenty one regular
session there was a path past
the stab which this fund.
It's it's funded by a surcharge
on health insurance taxes the
replicates a.
Federal tax surcharge tax the
we're one of the.
The money is in the health care
for the ability Fund do not go
into the general fund however.
The legislature quite
appropriately set the phone up
in a way that there is a split.
Between how much goes to the
fund for us to spend.
On the programs.
And the balance into the general
fund so as you see there the
note that we proposed.
Four year one or the need
proposed.
The legislation is fifty five
percent in the into the health
care affordability fund.
Forty five percent in the
general fund and one of the
reasons needs to have a
significant amount of go into
the general fund.
Did you see on the next we're on
a couple slides later here the
vast majority of the surcharge
tax is paid for by the Medicaid
managed care organizations.
And as you all know.
When we pay that we draw down
federal funds but we have to put
money up to draw those federal
funds so that's the reason for
the split we're estimating.
The general fund revenue from
that surcharge that goes into
the general fund will be higher
than the amount that you need
for the state chair of increased
MCO costs.
So on slide eight.
Use the vast majority of
insurers and clients who have
private insurance are not
subject to the surtax not
subject because there aren't so
for sure to regents.
Those who are self insured
arrangements whether it's the
state employees school personnel
internal.
PNM member who run their own
health plans they don't pay this
insurance taxes they don't pay
the surcharge.
So.
Actually most of this fund as I
said earlier is going to be paid
by.
The Medicaid managed care
organizations.
The locals for us.
To do three things under the
affordability fund.
Want to lower premiums are not
part across to people who are
buying on the New Mexico.
Health insurance fund.
The second to do something to
reduce.
Premiums for small businesses
small diverse businesses are
defined as employers with fifty
or fewer employees.
So we've proposed thirty five
million dollars to reduce the
premiums and out of pocket
costs.
depending on somebody's income.
And to reduce small business
premiums by ten percent would
cost roughly thirty million
dollars both of these would come
directly out of the we're
building fund and I'll be happy
to answer.
Any questions you might have
about the detail of that we
proposed to start the small
business premium reduction July
one.
So businesses would realize
some.
The budget this year.
And then the reduce premiums out
of pocket costs on the exchange
would begin in the open
enrollment period your period.
That starts this fall.
For the calendar year.
Twenty twenty three insurance.
We want to urge you to approve
the LFC recommendations.
With the addition of the health
care affordability.
Funding which I understand is
going to be handled in the me
and my special that's fine with
us we care the group which
proposes to get the money.
But we also urge you to increase
the position count in our twenty
twenty three allocation this is.
Very important for us.
This summer there we are not the
agency that you knew of two or
three years ago we've made.
A dramatic improvement in our
efforts we're doing more
outreach we've gone from
multiple audit findings to non.
We previously carried a large
vacancy rate I think we have six
vacancies right now.
And we've tackled updated rules
and regulations to address the
insurance needs of the twenty
first century which as you all
know our changing quite rapidly.
So.
Insurance members of the
committee we're doing the best
we can we are deeply
appreciative of the support that
you've given us over the last.
A couple years and we ask for
that support again this year
with just a couple of
improvements in the LFC
recommendation thank thank you
thank you very much for The
presentation Amanda is there
anything else that we need to
cover under that.
Not at this time Mr Chairman we
can take questions from
committee members okay thank you
very much for going to questions
from the committee Senator
Steinborn please.
Thank you Mr chair and the
superintendent could afternoon
and first of all thank you for
for our being a affected
advocate for consumers thank
you.
I think it's one of those
distinctions that I'm proud of
to be in New Mexico is that you
know something that we're all
dependent on that that we have a
fighter and Office that's
looking out for us that when I
got an email from your office
saying.
Or press release I guess that we
got that said.
Premiums were going down.
I thought that was like that
broke a lot of economic physics.
Health insurance premiums were
going down for New Mexicans and
I was just blown away
So anyway first will keep up the
good work keep fighting force I
realize that takes resources so
I hope we invest those resources
because it's hard work you know
when you're going to table with
insurance companies you have to
figure out the game and compete
and then and then when one for
the little little guide doubt I
mean that's tough to do we see
that with pharmaceuticals I mean
it's just a constant seven you
got to really have experts on
your side of the table if you
hope to be effective.
In that dance so I'm I hope we
supported question on the health
care affordability fund how much
is that generate in total now.
There's already some surtax
revenue this is new Mr Turks
Revenue surtax revenue and we're
estimating and state fiscal year
twenty three it'll generate a
hundred sixty five million
dollars.
Thank you Mr chairman of that
hundred sixty five million fifty
percent of it goes to the
general fund.
Forty five percent forty five
percent okay and out of that so.
So out of that you're asking for
thirty some odd million dollars
essentially.
Go to your department to help to
to do Mr chairman and Senator
Steinborn for for the total
program this year it's we've
requested sixty five million.
Okay sixty five sixty from from
the fund so right.
So pretty much all of that.
It's is there to if you would
build up reserve so that we can
continue these initiatives in
subsequent years.
Mr Chairman
I would just say I had a
constituents so I was on a kind
of a town hall meeting recently
are constituent talked to me
about hi out of pocket drug
costs.
And I thought about the
affordability fund which really
is for insurance and not for
drug costs.
But I just throw that out there
is a plug
you know somebody on a fixed
income and relying on these
drugs I don't is the
affordability fund at all
structured to even have
flexibility were maybe we can
help people with copays.
We Mister chairman Senator
it is in fact one of the things
we want to do with that thirty
five million.
It's not just lower premiums
what to do with the out of
pocket costs because.
Under the old system of we drove
down premiums let's say we were
able to find a plan on the
exchange for.
Ticket number fifty dollars a
month hundred dollars a month.
Which might seem like a bargain
but the maximum out of pocket
you're subject to is seven or
eight thousand dollars Richard
was under the.
Under the trump administration
that's prohibitive.
you have insurance but who can
afford the kinds of out of
pocket costs we're talking about
so the portability fund will
enable us to drive down and cap
those maximum out of pocket
costs which very well included
the pharmacy so Mr Chairman on
that point is that something
that they can do now is that
something you hope to be able to
do in the future we hope to be
able to do that with the thirty
five million.
That we've just for thank you
well will that be that the
powerful and I hope we can do
that as well I'll just close out
the state you probably get an
email from Legislative Council
soon I'm working on an issue
related to.
Insurance coverage for cancer
care in my community and
something I think probably that
you have some.
Ability to factor I think we're
just on the reserves may so make
people more thank you Mr thank
you very much Senators time any
other questions Senator Woods.
Those it's always a pleasure.
Here you go thank you Sir very
concise you pretty right on on
the subject you don't beat
around the bush the you stay on
subject and I appreciate that.
We pass that the.
Medical malpractice bill during
the special ed.
And there was a lot of talk
about was going to have to put
money in that fund so we did not
do that in the special.
I thought we had done that but
we did not.
Shares I guess I slip through
that I thought that that was
done so please Mister chairman
Senator Woods it was originally
proposed in the special and then
because the medical malpractice
bill was going through it was
not ultimately of finalized in
the special session but it was
proposed out of the converted
General Fund arpa funds which is
still where it lays down so it's
it's essentially from the same
kind of money but we're just
doing it a couple months later.
Okay.
Well that deal yes in the Senate
really easy.
And so I would think that.
Did that just go to a special
bill that would bask in.
Of.
And I would just looking at the.
On page two oh two volume three
here and it shows those
balances.
The trouble is with these
balances we're not too sure how
current the.
and I know that that changes.
Quite a bit of the time.
So.
It shows the November balance of
fifty nine million.
And the of twenty one in
November of twenty of eighty
seven million.
So that's quite a bit of
difference in the two over here.
So.
And that's what we're trying to
make up in it all has to do with
with the malpractice insurance
from what I understand.
The fund that you were talking
about lowering.
Insurance individual insurance
policies is it still the same
funders and a different phone
altogether Mr chairman and
senator what's it is a different
fund it's the health care
affordability fund.
Which is just essentially been
newly created the tax just began
January one.
And then the though the law
authorizing it is very specific
about what those monies can be
used for.
And
Does not permit the money to be
transferred into the patient
compensation fund but on the
fund
I could tell you that we had an
actuarial study that was of the
came in in October in in the
case it indicated that the
projected deficit in the PC of
the patient compensation fund
was about sixty six million
dollars.
And unfortunately a significant
amount of that deficit is due
the decisions that were made
years ago.
on some truly bad
malpractice cases in which there
were multiple claimants.
The decision at that time for
understandable reasons was.
The state we we've got to do
something for all of these
people.
And then the other reason it
occurred the the deficit
occurred on the position side
was again the decision was made
not to charge positions.
The surcharge rates that
probably should have been
charged action we're Lee but.
No I think there was a decision
that part of what you see now
is.
Our belief that we have to do
this is a big our the governor
the legislature ours.
I believe that you have to be we
have to be very sensitive to the
our that our past that we charge
positions for malpractice can
operate.
Totally online with our
surrounding states.
As we simply will lose and Texas
is you know.
has very low malpractice rates
because they have a very
different.
Practice act
Good part because.
Of settlements in the patient
compensation fund.
Continue to go up dramatically.
I want to give due recognition
to.
Senate and house leadership and
in particular to director Avid
who recognize the.
The money needed to go into a
fund to try to keep those.
Right the positions pay a lower
amount and not hold new
physicians responsible for the
decisions of the past.
And that thirty million
essentially represents the cost
of those previous decisions so.
I'm very grateful for that we
strongly support it.
And I hope the legislature will
as well.
And I and I agree Mexico hello
are the mixture that.
That's the way to do it we're.
I live as you know over Najib
New Mexico that much of the
health services done in Lubbock
and Amarillo in my part of the
world just a lot closer to get
service there.
And you know a few years ago we
had.
the law presented that you would
be able to sue a Texas doctor
just like you would New Mexico
drive even though the service
was done in Texas but and we was
able to curve that law.
And still those those physicians
in Texas today make you sign a
waiver before they will give you
service.
So I know there still some.
So
Worries of those doctors over
there of of our legal.
System over here.
And that's a shame that it has
to be that way
the other thing that that I
wanted to to bring out in court
you you know I'm going to ask
for your your contract that's
promised you've heard that three
times already so you don't know
what that request is.
But I do Sir I do appreciate.
We've had some pretty good
talks.
And I would like to Senator
Steinborn realized that there
there's an old joke and I don't
remember the full job Senator
but.
In the end insurance company and
ladies will own all the money.
So I don't remember what that
whole joke but it seems like
they're the ones that that live
longer and and end up with so
whatever we can do to help curb
a little of that and make it
affordable health care is a.
A critical issue in our state.
And specially on the rural areas
and and I'm constantly reminded
of those.
Areas in our state where there's
not good health care were
essentially they slap a band aid
on you and put you on a
helicopter.
And.
It's a tough time.
And I don't know how we can
change it with that attract
young doctors into those areas
there's no the older doctors are
retiring.
And it's hard to attract.
So sure I I don't wanna.
Ramble any further.
I do appreciate you.
I wish we had a whole lot more
clone just like you Sir.
Thank you Mr chairman I hi.
And Senator Woods I really
appreciate advocacy that you do
on behalf of your constituents.
It's commendable if I if I may
Mister chair want to make one
comment please proceed if we can
just try to make it short the
biggest challenge we face right
now in terms of insurance
regulation is with the long term
care insurance industry.
They are pricing themselves out
of reach for most of New Mexico
I'm not exaggerating when I tell
you we get requests from those
insurers of rate increases.
Two three and four hundred
percent.
We say to them you know we live
in the state with the second
lowest per capita income
regrettably.
And these simply are not
affordable and most of the
people who pay them or on a
retiree or fixed income they can
cannot ever handle.
seventy eighty ninety two
hundred percent increase in
their premiums.
And it's almost as if the
industry is just trying to push
people out.
Many of these people have
premiums for long term care
insurance for decades literally
for decades and there are being
faced with having no value
whatsoever.
this is something we want to
focus on the next year that's
part of what we we want the
additional staff in contracting
money for.
So anything you could do to help
us with that would really be
critical critical and and
vitally important to us I am
raising this issue on a national
level with the national
association of insurance
commissioners.
Simply sign.
We just can't afford this.
It's it was not being fair it's
punitive.
And so I want you to know that
we're saying no.
Even though one of those states
are saying yes to these
companies.
But I don't think we have a
choice we we simply have to say
no.
Whether or not all the companies
continue to read long term care
insurance in the state I can
answer some of the
Representative if you don't give
us what we want if we're not
going to write new policies.
When I don't feel like we should
be held over the barrel like
the.
I don't make decisions based at
the end of a gun so we're taking
a firm stand but we really need.
More expertise in house to be
able to we bought these
ridiculous requests thank you
thank you very much and before I
go to Senator Steinborn for the
second time is there anyone else
would like to go and be
recognized for the first time
on this issue.
Okay seeing and then I'm going
to Senator Steinborn and for the
second there's a really
important question I have a
sister I got tasked with first
to money Senator colleague so
the joke I remember I don't
never heard your job but I said
the the representative we serve
with he was putting on an
insurance bill are processed in
a long time ago and he said
insurance companies are like the
casino the house always wins.
And that anyway he's a lot
funnier than I so you would
allow officials said that but.
Anyway Mr pretender you
promulgating rules on Senate
bill three seventeen that was
the bill that eliminated the co
pays for behavioral health yes
we've already issued orders and
directives to the insurance
industry and to providers and.
And we are also taking action
against
Measures our providers who are
doing right okay so I I was
really proud of the to be
accustomed to a Centers Hickey
and that was really gives bill
on and New Mexico is the first
state in the country to
eliminate copays on behavioral
health doctors visits and
prescriptions pretty profound
Of the policy but but I know
there's a lot of confusion
because it's new from providers
about who they charge you a not
charge and I think there's
definitely a need for lots of
education so I appreciate that
you're doing I just kind of the
calls I'm getting or slowing
down a little bit so maybe
there's education is getting out
there but I do want to ask you
there's a huge need with this
new law to do aggressive
