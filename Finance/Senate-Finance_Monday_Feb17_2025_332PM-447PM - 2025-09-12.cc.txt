are they?
Sinners, somebody might need to
get centeronics. We have an
amendment, you wear those that
amendment from Senator
Stephonics.
You are.
You have an expert witness with
you today.
You want us to wait, or you?
We'll get started. Go ahead, you
want to explain the bill and
then we have some amendments.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
committee. So this is Senate
Bill 33 and it's the wildfire
Prepared Act and
Mr. Chair and committee, if you
I know you've seen all the
devastation that's happened in
Lincoln County, Otero County, as
well as Mora and all over the
place.
What this bill is trying to do
is.
We're trying to put something
together to where we can harden
people's homes.
We're going to be able to uh put
in buffer zones and come up to
a.
A standard to where.
Hopefully
I'm, I'm hopeful that we're
gonna be able to get some
insurance companies to come back
after this.
Um
After this has been done and we
can start getting insurance back
into our communities.
And uh most of my legislation
this this uh session.
has to do with.
Getting our forest back to where
they need to be and um I've met
with several of the insurance
companies and uh they're just
Lincoln County right now as, as
well as some of the other places
that are overgrown in their
forests, they're just not that
appealing right now to insurance
companies.
You're an expert in was just
walk back in the room you want
to add to, but.
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee, this is my expert
witness, um, Laura McCar.
Theses are state forester for
New Mexico.
Go ahead.
Mr. Chair and members Senator
Stefaniks is on her way. That's
why I left to.
Uh, tell her it was time.
Senator and uh.
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee.
This is a bill that we've been
working on collaboratively with
the other agencies including the
superintendent of insurance.
Oh,
OK.
The um
State Fire Marshal and the
construction industries
division. We've put a lot of
thought into
Where the gaps are in current
New Mexico law and policy.
And come up with this proposal.
To address the critical need for
homes.
In our state that are in the
high wildfire risk areas to
become safer.
It's, uh, every time we have a
wildfire that destroys homes,
it's a tragedy and unfortunately
in the last 3 years, we've lost
nearly 2000 New Mexico homes.
That's what this bill is about.
If, if you wanted to, I could go
through some of the parts of the
bill, but I know you have it
before you and in the interest
of time, I won't do that.
So there's the product you want
to add anything.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee, uh, did, uh,
Representative Harlan did to get
to speak yet. I know.
Yes. Yeah, he did. He didn't say
much but kind of, you know, the
whole purpose, uh, this past
summer, um,
We all as legislators were
invited to a task force meeting
on this particular issue and
Senator uh Woods and I attended
with the superintendent of
insurance, the state forester,
the insurance industry and
several others.
And because of the constant
state.
Of drought in our state, we have
to address all the issues that
come with it. The wildfire, the
flooding, you know, the winds,
everything that contributes to
disaster here.
So this is an attempt to move
forward, and I see we have an
amendment.
Not us, but your committee.
Thank you, Senator Stefaniks.
Uh, let's see.
We have an amendment.
Senator Stefanis, you wanna
Explain your amendment just so
we have the right one. Where did
I put it? It's Senator Wood's
amendment, I believe, um I have
one from you and one from
Senator Woods.
Mine is just stripping the
appropriation. His is language.
Yep, let's do yours first. OK,
um.
So can I have a motion to
Move the amendment for
discussion purposes.
A motion by Senator Gonzalo, 2
by Senator.
Bison
And you want to explain the
amendment.
Yes, thank you, um.
Mr. Chair and on page 9.
Strike lines 8 through 16.
Yep, that is correct and it
basically does the strips the
appropriations from line 8, page
9, line 8 through 16. That's
correct. And that's all that
amendment, my amendment does.
Right
Questions on the questions on
the amendment seem none. We have
motion.
Mhm
We have a second to adopt the
amendment, Senator Trujil.
Any objection to adopting the
amendment.
None.
And a minute, Bill.
We have one more amendment,
Senator.
Representative you've seen
Senator Woods's amendment, you
know what it does. Yes. And
And it is a friendly amendment.
Thank you.
And what can we have a motion,
move the amendment for
discussion purposes move to for
a.
Discussion move the amendment
for discussion. The motion
second by.
In
She waves, you wink.
Uh.
Thanks, Senator, what do you
want to explain? OK, let me
explain, Mr. Chair.
On page 6.
What I would like to do.
Is, is to rearrange.
That a little bit.
First striking.
On page on page 6, line 14,
striking, consider the benefits
of
And instead inserting.
What is down on line 21.
And making it.
Take other fire suppression, or
prevention measures such as an
insert it to where that strike
was.
So we would be
We would be, uh,
Striking out on page 6 line 18,
strike the comma.
Insert
And Sir
Lu love and of An.
OK, strike the comma.
And and in that.
Since
online.
On page 16, line 1886 line 18,
you are striking.
The coma insert.
Insert in lieu of their poor and
to insert the and and.
Yep
That's what that line does.
OK. And then and then, and then
I'm gonna take.
On page 6, line 21, 22 strike
and taking other fires.
Expression of prevention
measures.
So as it reads on line 6, line
14.
It would read.
Take other fire suspension or
prevention measures such as
thinning overgrown forests.
Conducting control burns,
gleaming spaces around homes and
other structures.
Using and go on.
So, essentially, we're just
moving it around, and I think it
gives it a, a better, more of a
direction instead of saying,
well, consider this.
Instead of making it a more,
make it a little more direct.
Line of thought there is my
thought on that, Mr. Chair.
Questions on the amendment.
See none
And the motion.
And motion by in the woods
second by.
In Stein born any objection to
that motion, OK?
No
amended bill, twice amended.
Questions were back on the bill,
Senator Tobiasson.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
you mentioned that you're
hopeful that insurance companies
will continue to ensure or come
back if they've left and ensure
these areas. Have you actually
talked to insurance companies
and and the industry as a whole.
So, um
Mr. Chair and Senator, uh, that
was part of the workforce, uh,
that was this past summer, the
insurance industry did come to
the table along with parties
from within our state, the
superintendent of insurance and
some of her division directors,
the state forester and some
other interested parties as I
mentioned, Senator Woods and I
attended out of the group of um
legislators that were invited,
but that it was the insurance
companies.
And the national organization
that helped direct us in terms
of the path that which we should
go and Mr. Chair, Senator, I
would definitely let our expert
add to that.
Mr. Chair and Senator.
Uh, everything that was just
said, and they have reviewed
this bill every step of the way
and giving us feedback about how
to improve it.
And, and thank you, Mr. Chair. I
grew up in Florida and actually
I know several people who have
lost their homes this past year
in the town that I grew up in
because of the hurricanes that
came through and what they're
finding is because of Florida
building code now addressing the
damage that hurricanes caused to
the area. A lot of these people
are in a position where they
will not be able to rebuild. So,
This is really focused on
preventing damage before the
fire happens and you're
mentioning
Access to two different grants,
will everyone have access to
that and, and is it guaranteed
that people will have the funds
to do what you're wanting them
to do.
Mr. Chair and senator.
For everyone to have access to
the grant funding we would need
a lot more money than is being
considered for the
appropriation.
So we're gonna have to make some
hard choices based on data about
wildfire risk and
The reason that there are
to
Types of grants that will need
to work together.
Is that random acts of
retrofitting uh home or
structure.
Don't
Lead to the survival rates that
we're looking for in order to
get the true outcomes.
That we need.
Neighborhoods have to be
organized and
Have to get to a commitment.
To get 80% of the neighborhood
into wildfire prepared
standards.
That's the reason for the two
types of grants.
Uh, the amount of the
appropriation that's being
talked about, I would consider
that to be at a pilot level.
And I think that does give us a
good opportunity.
To work out the kinks in this.
Because this isn't something we
have experience doing.
Previously we're modeling the
program after.
A program called Strength in
Alabama Homes. That's very
similar but is oriented towards
roofs and is missing that
component of neighborhood
organizing.
There was a second part to your
question that I've forgotten.
I'm sorry.
I've forgotten it too, Mr.
Chairs, if there was a second
part to that. So just I guess my
concern is thinking of my
friends back in Florida, um,
even though we're talking after
the fact, um, them not being
able to afford, so there's whole
neighborhoods actually in Saint
Pete, where
Those people can't afford to
even come back.
So they'll be selling land at
fire sale prices because they
can't afford to build up, um, so
I just wanna make sure that in
this process that it's mapped
out and that it's clearly
thought out so that the
appropriate people or areas have
access to this money.
So that it makes sense to do it.
Do you see what I'm saying? Is
it, is it well thought out so
that Mr. Chair, people aren't
left behind or we're not using
the money or the or the funds
appropriately to the, you know,
to the best of the ability.
Mr. Chair, Senator, as with all
money that's appropriated by um
the House budget.
Um, or the.
Legislative budget, everything
goes out to RFP.
And the state forester and the
task force would actually help
map out and determine those
areas that were of most need. I
was heartened to see on TV a
week or two ago how Sandoval
County had already received a
grant.
From various sources, private
and governmental and hired a
contractor to help organize uh
neighborhoods and the
communities to start doing this
work in neighborhoods.
So I know that this
can be done and we just
Have the expertise here between
the insurance department and the
state forester and the
engineers, the state engineer
for water, we're gonna know the
areas that are gonna be next
hit.
OK. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
The campus.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you very much, members of
the Senate Finance Committee and
of course the presenters.
So to start with the questions
in terms of the um
Uh, we'll go ahead and we'll say
the task force as it's expanded
or uh there's consideration for
the expansion.
Uh, along with that and as uh
has already been indicated that
this could be uh
Part of a pilot program in terms
of the appropriation. I'm gonna
get into that in a minute. Uh,
can, can someone help me to
better understand who's gonna be
absorbing.
The expenses, if you will, of a
program such as this. Thank you,
Mr. President, Mr. Chairman.
Uh, thank you, uh, Senator and
Mr. Chair, if I understand your
question, we are seeking an
appropriation that we've
stripped and the executive has
supported the appropriation in
her budget.
And, and so Mr. Chairman, the
point that I'm getting to with
that, and that would be the
second question.
Uh, how much has the executive
supported uh that within her
budget and then secondly, uh,
are there any other
appropriations measures where we
indicate or we see that there
could be an amount that is
making its way through the leg.
So, um, Mr. Chair and senator
that uh executive does have 20
million in there um.
Executive budget for this and
the recommendation was another
uh from LFC was a 600,000 for
operations for the staff, uh,
and the administrative overhead
needed to, to do this.
So thank you Mr. Mr. Chair, if I
may, uh, to the sponsors, uh,
and, and of course to the the
expert.
So
Where, where do we anticipate
the 20 million um.
Will, will be, is that gonna be
in, in house Bill 2, is that
gonna go ahead and be and, and
the point that I'm getting to
is, as we continue to see that
making its way through. I
haven't seen that amount
included within that bill yet.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um
Mr. Chair and senator, I'm gonna
let the representative speak to
whether or not it's in the house
budget.
Mr. Chair and senator, it, I
have seen that in the
appropriations in the house
appropriations, but one day I
see it and the next time I
don't, so I'm hoping that it
stays in there, but right now
it's currently in there.
So, so, Mister Chair, if I may,
so it, uh, representative, so
you're indicating that it goes
back and forth one day it's
there, the next day it's not.
And, and so we need to continue
to um to seek the the the
resources. So Mr. Chair, the
second part of that question,
uh, with the 20 million is that
going to be enough even as a
pilot program.
With a number of homes that uh
we are looking at safeguarding.
Um, or how is that gonna work?
first come, first serve, and
then with the grant processes
are those aligned with when the
uh the appropriations are gonna
be available for us to to do
this because you definitely
don't want to go and have some
of the obstacles within.
Setting this up
And in reality we find that uh.
It's gonna take a lot longer to
implement and what, what our
thoughts are. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Well, Mr. Chair and Senator, I'm
gonna have the state forester
speak to this since it would be
administrative. Thank you, Mr.
Chair and Senator.
you've put your finger on the
most challenging aspect of this.
Um, depending on the final
amount that's appropriated and
whether or not there is the
ability to spend some of that or
access to recurring dollars for
staff will determine um
Exactly how quickly this can get
rolled out. We know that there's
gonna be really strong interest
in it.
And we have uh decent mapping
currently for the high-risk
areas in our state and
Uh, the, my vision of this in
terms of a timeline is that in
If this bill passes with the
emergency clause that in April,
the task force will adopt the
wildfire prepared standards and
immediately uh publish that.
Uh, you know,
In a rule format and that, uh,
immediately following that, we
will
Get the grant guidelines for the
first type of grant, which is to
local governments to do the
organizing, and then they come
to us with their proposal or
the, how they will get.
They're high risk area to 80%.
And then those who are in need
of financial assistance, um, we
would go to the direct grants to
those for home hardening who
can't afford the 3000 to $10,000
to make the upgrades in those
specific areas where we know
they'll get to 80%.
So, Mr. Chair, as we go forward,
and I know one of the big issues
that we continue to deal with is
the anti-donation clause, and
we're dealing with it in several
measures as we go forward.
So the political subdivisions
qualify for the resources and
then from there as individuals,
and if you can help me a little
bit to better understand who
those qualified entities would
be.
Um
We definitely want to get the
resources there to harden, if
you will, these, these
properties, the homes, the
barns, the kind of things that
are within the, the, the
property boundary. So in dealing
with that, if you can help me to
better understand who those
other qualified entities would
be, uh, that would also qualify
for the grants that could be
available. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
So, Mr. Chair and Senator, the
political subdivisions of the
state, the list is very long.
It's um cities, counties,
incorporated towns, uh, school
districts, uh, asse, land
grants, uh, mutual domestic
water systems, wastewater, and
uh landfills, etc.
I mean, there's a few other, Mr.
Chair and again to the
presenters, the question that I
am asking.
When it comes to the qualified
entities along with the
political subdivisions.
Who are those? And what I'm
trying to get to is, as we're
dealing with the anti-donation
clause.
How are we going to get the
resources to people that uh are
in dire need of the resources to
protect their properties as we
continue to go ahead and deal
with uh with this specific issue
to think places like Riodoso or
to to Mora County. Thank you,
Mr. Chair.
Um, Mr. Chair and Senator, I'm
gonna have the state forester
respond. Mr. Chair and senator,
there's um there's been a lot of
dialogue with Emner's general
counsel about this exact issue.
There is a body of case law. I
am not an attorney, so I'm not
gonna cite it now, but uhmner
general counsel feels very
confident that
The
Benefit to the private owner is
incidental compared to the
benefit to the neighborhood.
And
If you've watched any of the
Um, information coming out of
the LA fires.
Uh, you know, we, I think we've
all learned that
Ember spray is a critical way
that homes that are adjacent to
one another catch fire.
And once you have enough homes
burning, generating heat, you
have the radiant heat spread.
You add in our spring winds.
And the potential for
conflagration.
Uh, and taking out of entire
neighborhoods is very high.
And so, um, it's a combination
of science and case law to
answer your question. Thank you
very much, Mr. Chair, and I
really appreciate the
explanation because that's one
of the issues we continue to
deal with when we're dealing
with uh any of these bills
dealing with the fires and of
course the floods as we move
forward.
As an example with our co-ops
throughout the state and in
particularly in the Mora area
they have the need to remove
160,000 trees that is definitely
an adversely affecting, if you
will, the uh transmission lines
and making sure people have
reliable electricity.
That being said, the problem
that we're running into is
again, uh, what is considered to
go ahead and be an anti-donation
issue.
And we need to continue to go
ahead and uh deal with this and
be strong advocates for it
because we definitely want the
life safety issues to be
addressed and in order to go
ahead and do that, that means
that um an explanation like you
just provided uh is essential as
we move this bill and hopefully
others as we move forward, um,
to the fruition point to where
hopefully they'd be signed into
law, so that's all I have right
now, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
Thank you let me do some catch
up. Is anybody in support of
this bill?
I'll take 1 or 2. Anybody on
Zoom?
Anybody imposed on you.
We'll take 1 or 2 real quick and
then
Anybody in opposition.
Representative, you raise your
hand.
But.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee. I'm Alyssa
Kenny Guyer representing Sierra
Club and it's 35,000 members and
supporters. We support this
bill, um, we support the
creating of a 16-member state
fire task force to map the fire
risk in New Mexico communities.
The appropriation of 20 million
in direct grants for community
and individual home hardening
and buffering against the fire.
Appreciate your dogging that as
it goes through the budget
process, the and I also
appreciate um Senator Woods'
strength.
ing of the bill. Thank you. The
task force will work with
communities to improve building
codes and adopt safer ecological
forest management practices.
This is a proven cost effective
method to protect homes and
structures in wild land, urban
interface areas and to protect
life rather than depending on
remote forest treatments to
retard, wildfires from entering
urban areas. In addition, Senate
Bill 33 lays the groundwork to
improve accessibility and
affordability of New Mexico's
insurance market an issue
brought to light by some
insurance companies.
stopping their fire insurance
policies in fire-prone areas, a
nationwide study in 2024 found
that counties in eastern New
Mexico saw some of the highest
premium increases nationally in
counties in southern New Mexico
faced the nation's highest
climate premium shock. We
appreciate the inclusion of the
state insurance superintendent
staff on the, on the fire task
force. The Senate Bill 33 will
reduce risk, which should keep
premiums lower by investing the
money in community wildlife fire
resistance and mitigation and
wining community's wildlife
preparedness standards with the
insurance Institute of for
Business and Home Safety. Thank
you, Mr. Chair and members.
Jerk.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee,
SherRoos of the Public Service
Company of New Mexico. SB 33
opens the conversation of
incidental benefit for greater
wealth fire risk reduction over
benefit to a private landowner.
It also introduces the value
stream for tree clearing
byproducts. Both these advances
could reduce overall vegetation
management and support in the in
aligns with the work we are
already doing at PNM SB 33 is uh
policyP&M can support and we
thank the sponsors. Thank you.
Thank you.
There's no opposition.
Go back to questions, any other
questions from committee
members, Senator Steinborn.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Senator.
Good to be with you, sir. I'm
apologize. What's your, oh, you
stay up.
Nice to meet you. Oh, no, sorry
about that. I remember when I
was a new state rap and I showed
up in Senate committees check
your tire the parking lot. Sorry
about that. Nice to meet you. My
apologies, um.
Just one question, the insurance
companies, the inclusion of the
insurance companies. What do
you, what benefit do you see
there? Just like to hear it from
your perspective.
including them on.
This task force
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, Senator Steinborn.
So
All this legislation kind of
really
Revolves around the insurance
industry and I'm running another
um.
A fair plan
So I've met with the fair plan
board.
I've met with the superintendent
of insurance.
And of course there was a little
pushback from the insurance
agencies.
And right now.
I
there's no solution for
insurance, so this compounding
problem that we're having is.
Our financial institutions.
Can't loan money without
insurance.
And our, our real estate agents
can't sell property.
Because they can't get insurance
on it and it just keeps
compounding and compounding.
Well, um.
In my previous life as a fire
chief, I know my area very, very
well, and there I wouldn't want
to take the risk either.
And what we have done is in the
village of Rioso.
We actually
Came up with ordinances, so you
have to have a certificate of
completion.
to take to your insurance
company that says, you know, I
have done my due diligence and I
have hardened as much as I can.
I've been as much as I can in in
this our local forester.
He gives, he signs off on it, so
you're able to get insurance and
with that ordinance, with this
one, even being a little bit
more stringent.
I believe that it's going to
show the, the insurance industry
that New Mexico is at least
trying. We're trying to get
these homes hardened. We're
trying to get this thin, and I
know that it runs into that uh
pesky problem of anti-donation.
But it's to public benefit.
And the way I and and I know
you're going to laugh at this,
Mr. Chair, but I, I kind of, I
think that this has a lot to do
with like the opportunity
scholarship. It's, you know,
it's like public benefit. It, it
works.
Thank you. So really, but even
kind of taking a step further
than your description, Mr.
Chair. It's like making sure
that we're spending that our
strategies are in alignment with
getting a result.
Which is that we're not only
protecting areas, but we're also
keeping them insurable.
In a way.
Which would make sense to have
someone.
With that voice, as long as we
kind of, kind of makes you
wonder if it's gonna be a moving
target where they just, you
know.
I don't know. It'll be
interesting to see the way it
plays out, but congrats on a
great bill representative and
senator, thank you so much.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
to him.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you, Senator and
Representative for bringing this
forward and um just a couple of
questions. On page 6, and this
is already current language. I
just, um
I was gonna ask about it.
On line 7 and line 8, it says,
The task force shall develop
standards for building codes and
then it says an ordinances.
How does that, I mean, is, are
those in connection,
collaboration with
Local jurisdictions that do
their own building with
construction industries, how is
that communicated to make sure
that everybody's on the same
page, doing the same thing.
So, um, Mr. Chair and uh
senator.
This is about developing
standards that cities, counties
and the state would set in
developing those building.
Oats.
OK. Thank you. Um, might be
stronger if we said that they
had to look at those.
But I know that's, that's more
of a big amendment that we can
maybe do later. Um, I was
reading in the FIR that um DFA
thought that there might be some
uh date misalignment with the
grants and such. And as I looked
at it, I, I'm noticing on page 7
line 11.
The task force has to have, you
know, this, uh, guidelines
developed by June 30th of each
year.
And then, um, down on line 17,
it says that they have to report
to the legislature by December
15th, that hardly seems like
enough time, and I'm wondering
if um you might be open to
change that December 15th to
June 30th, so that you're
developing guidelines and then
you're reporting out a year
later so that
Because we could all probably
agree that
Recommendations to the
legislature on December 15th,
they're kind of a day late and a
dollar short to get anything
done for the session. And then
if the legislature were to get
that information by June 30th
after a year of implementation,
then there would be time for
interim committees and
conversation and potentially
legislation. I just think June.
If or December 15th is
Kind of counterproductive,
Mister Chair and Senator.
The December 15th date has been
in there.
For 20 years. I
What you're saying does make
sense with one caveat, and that
is that we're in the height of
our fire season in June.
That's fair. That's fair, Mr.
Chairman. Maybe we can think
about that before it gets to the
floor that there's another time
that would give you plenty of
time to let the legislature
know, maybe even just after the
session is over, so that we
would have that interim
committee time to really kind of
think about what those
recommendations might look like
in legislation. So Mr. Chair,
Senator, um, I do think December
15th is appropriate. And the
reason is that does give us time
to.
prepare any legislation or
additional uh appropriations
requests for the legislative
session.
And if we wait until after the
legislative session, we've lost
an opportunity for another year.
Thank you Mr. Chair, Senator.
Yeah, no, thank you, Mr.
Chairman and Senator. I, I see
that appropriation um request.
That's one part of it, but I
read this legislative
recommendations to be more than
just appropriations to really be
some substantive changes to the
law,
but nonetheless, I will be in
support of this. It just seems
like those dates are a little
wonky for what we're trying to
accomplish. Thank you.
Senator Woods and then Senator
guy goes.
Senators.
I'm sorry,
I'm like
Cascendo told me Gonzalez, I
mean, guy goes.
I blame it on the vice chair.
That's 50,000 on
send no shit you know be more
than willing to pay that.
The only question of reading
this material.
Where does propane tanks fall
in.
Mr. Chair, Senator, I'm gonna
turn that to our state forester.
Mr. Chair and.
Senator
Propane tanks in a wildfire, as
you know, are very dangerous.
I will have to get back to you
as to where.
The insurance for business and
home safety stands on propane
tanks, um, and we'll get that.
Included in our review of, of
wildfire prepared standards.
There is also another bill, the
HOA bill that I believe is in
both the House and the Senate
that
Addresses
A problem of some
Homeowners Association requiring
coyote fences to be put to
screen.
Propane tanks from view, which
is obviously not a very good
idea.
Oh, Mr. Chairman, like, for
example, uh, I live in the
mountains.
And uh we buried ours, you know,
but um.
You can only get one that's
buried only if it's 1000 gallons
pretty expensive.
But uh from uh.
Different uh
I guess the.
Different dealers from um
propane, say that if those get
heated.
That's equivalent to a bomb.
Mm-hmm
You know, and so.
The breaking point on those is
at each end.
So you definitely would not want
to have that facing toward a a
structure.
You know, that's one part and
then so many feet away from the.
Residents also but.
Mr. Chair, if I could send her
Gonzalez. So there's already
state regulations to have a
propane tank. It has to be so
far from a house.
Most residential, most
residential propane tanks.
Um, have a relief valve on them,
and they work, they actually do
their job. They do really good.
What we want is when those
relief valves go off, we want it
to be on fire.
Because it's burning the, the
propane where we get into a
problem is whenever it's
releasing.
And, you know, you have raw gas
out there.
But um as far as.
The fires that we went through,
they call it a levy.
And that's when they they go off
and we didn't have any levy.
The, the relief valves went off
appropriately and they released
all the gas and everything was.
Very well, Mr. Chairman, thank
you.
Thank you haven't seen anybody
else.
Let me ask you some questions we
learned in this committee the
other day. So you're gonna point
this task force which this bill
is almost a memorial.
Right? Do we still need the
emergency clause because
appropriation is gonna be
stripped and we don't know if
it's in in or out of the house.
I don't think you do.
That's one question. Well, Mr.
Chair, we would like the
emergency clause to stay because
we want immediate action by the
department.
Right, that answers that
question. Let me ask you about
the
awards, right? Where did I lose
my place here,
uh, starting on page 4, right?
We learned that
You know,
Um
A representative is not the
person that's gonna make the
decision.
We learned that the other day in
this committee and so everywhere
you have a representative.
If you're looking to get answers
that representative could be.
Maybe not the janitor, but
anybody else in the building,
and they're gonna say, well, I
gotta go back to the
commissioner, or I gotta go back
to the
Federal borough of land
management BLM, right? Uh, the
Forest Service.
Um
A member of the local fire
department appointed by the
governor, what fire department,
I mean, you get one from
Albuquerque that may not even
have a clue what they're doing.
Um
And there's another one pointed
by the forester, there's a
couple of appointments by the
forest, and I don't know why
we're letting them make the
appointments.
We should be making the
appointments represented the
county.
misbelieved.
Representative of the Office of
the Superintendent of insurance.
And, and then a representative
of the Indian nation tribe of
Pueblo appointed by the
governor. Well,
Mm
There's more than one tribe or
Pueblo, and they're going to be
different in all their actions
from the masculeros to Isleta
may have a fire in the river,
right? They had theirs burned
down a couple of years ago, so
you may need to add some more
appointments just because of the
diversity in that section.
But I mean, should we strike a
representative in every place
and make these, like, the land
commissioner.
Commissioner of Public lands.
The federal, we have no
regulation over, right? We're
gonna get what we're gonna get.
But we want, you want decisions
made.
And the representatives are not
going to make those decisions in
whatever reason.
Um, so, Mr. Chair, um,
The drafter is the one who
recommended a representative or
the representative.
I can see your point, uh, very
specifically about authority and
decision making. We also have
another Senate Memorial with
another work group on this from
Senator Woods, and we have a few
other uh groups working on this
as well, but going back to.
The
Um
The identified individual.
It is possible that.
For example,
The state land commissioner
might send a deputy who could
Make a decision, but if they
sent somebody else, they could
not make a decision. So I'm not
sure how the department would
handle this. Well, let's state
forest or be Senate
representative, would you allow
them to make the decision for
you?
Uh, Mr. Chair.
I've been thinking about this a
lot, and I've been kind of
rehearsing in my head the speech
that I give at the first meeting
of this um reformed task force
and it's about getting work
done.
Uh
I, I completely understand
around the decision making, and
I also
Uh, for this to function and for
us to do something as ambitious
as uh we've laid out here.
We need people who are gonna do
the work.
And um whether that's uh the
boss or the subordinate of the
boss, um,
I think it's gonna be up to the
chair to really motivate this
group, um, however you choose to
formulate it.
It is an existing task force and
I've been
Sharing it for 5 years, uh, I
inherited it and
Uh, it was, um,
Not very active until the last 6
months when we started to really
dive into this.
Potential wildfire prepared
program.
And in the last 6 months, how
many meetings that we have and
who's the members currently and
have they shown up?
Uh, Mr. Chair, the members are
those that are shown on pages 4
and 5 that are not in strikeout
or underline. So that's the
current composition and um we've
had really good attendance.
We've also had guest attendance
by homeowners association,
realtors, and insurance
industry, and that's
It's in that forum that we've
had some of the difficult
conversations around how this
program might be structured
going forward.
So
a number of meetings um uh I
don't remember exactly my guess
is 3.
31
3 meetings in the last 6 months.
You mean the last 6 months, OK.
And and then what do you think
are the comments on page 5 of
line 12 cause
The the nation tribe or Pueblo.
appointed by the governor, I
mean, that's just so diverse.
I mean, the mascaleros are not
gonna let you decide anything on
the trial with sovereignty.
You're not gonna get anything
decided.
That's a comment I want to see
what you want to do or not want
to do.
Mr. Chair, the representative
has been from the Indian Affairs
department.
OK.
But it doesn't say that, as a
representative of the Indian
nation tribe of Pueblo by the
governor.
Not by, not Indian Affairs
department.
That's new language.
And so I don't see where there's
one from Indian affairs were
listed in here.
Well, Mr. Chair and uh I'm just
asking because I want to
understand the task force, yeah
we have a Secretary of the
Indian Affairs Department from
one of the states, tribes or
pueblos and the governor
appoints that would meet that
condition. If it is a person
from outside the state or
non-native.
Uh, American, then that might be
an issue.
Yeah, but the forester just said
that Indian affairs was
attending right now, but I don't
seem as an appointee on here.
And she said the task force had
been.
So that's another, some
questions, I think you should
require people to attend.
If you want to get it done
because
And and make the person in
charge go because they're gonna
have a commitment to it if you
want to get this done, I rep
representative.
And I don't know how you're
gonna handle the feds, I mean.
They may or may not appoint him.
Do they currently have someone
on that and do they currently
attend?
Mr. Chair, they do.
That answers that question.
Good. Let me go to page 6.
I, I don't think a task board
should be developing building
codes.
Dispensable spaces, I mean.
You mentioned coyote fencing
well.
If you go to my house, my wife's
gonna tell you to put something
in front of the propane tank, so
I have to look at it every time
I drive in the driveway, right?
Or I want flowers over here. I
want.
A lilac bush over there, right?
And these are all things about
harding your home when fires
happen.
Why do you think that this task
force is gonna have the ability
to, uh,
Develop standards for for
building codes.
And the technical experience.
Mr. Chair.
That language that you're
looking at.
The developed standards for
building codes does date back to
the creation of this law in
2003.
The
Task force does have the
construction industries division
represented, they do attend
regularly.
And there is cross dialogue
between this task force and the
technical advisory committee
that construction industries
division runs.
The standards, despite the fact
that this has been a directive
to the task force for 20 years,
the standards have never been
developed.
Uh, we chose not to have it
struck out, but rather to give
it another attempt.
And, and so being developed
billing codes that have to be
standard. They can't be, this is
the building code in Riidoso,
right?
And this is the building code in
the route, New Mexico.
They have to be standard across
the board and so I, I don't
understand how they're going to
develop different standards and
then how is the municipalities
cities and the counties can, can
they adopt certain standards and
not adopt certain standards,
because they're really not in
control unless they have a local
building code or local building
inspector.
So, um, Mr. Chair, this is about
standards and when we get to
standards for building codes and
the cities and the counties and
the incorporated towns get to
develop.
their own codes.
So for example, if you are in
downtown Santa Fe.
Uh, some people think it's
great, some people think it's
boring.
That the building code requires
a certain type of building.
Uh, no higher than so many
stories, a certain color, um, a
certain style, the territorial
style, whereas if you go out in
the county, they have other
requirements in in outside of
the Santa Fe City, for example,
in Santa Fe County, we've gone
to uh actually identifying how
large the properties have to be.
And cannot be subdivided unless
it's for that specific purpose.
So this is about standards and
then it still leaves your um
The state CID and the cities and
the counties to develop the
codes.
Yeah, but you have to develop
the standard for, for everywhere
across Santa Fe is a lot
different than anybody else,
right? And you got to look at
Santa Fe, what's their standards
currently have and what do you
want to do it to harden homes, I
mean.
If you change that deal, I mean,
a lot of homes in Santa Fe,
they're so tight and compact and
emits in the back, but standards
will change and it's not that
fires can't affect Santa Fe,
just like they affected
everywhere else, the winds blow
correctly.
That's one thing that makes me
Questionable. I mean, something,
I'm just telling you things to
look at. I'm not trying to mend
your bill, but there's certain
things that I look at.
And then
On page 8.
Um
Who's gonna qualify eligible
property owners.
How are you going to determine
that? Cause we, I want to know,
that's one thing I want to know
who is going to be eligible,
right?
I mean, is it
be eligible. I mean, what's
going to determine your
eligibility.
Uh, you have it in here.
What is, what is an eligible
property owner.
These 5 lines have changed about
6 times since the bill's been
drafted and at one time there
was an income threshold in there
at another time.
Uh, it was just for primary
residences, uh, another, and now
what you see, uh, this is an
amendment that Senator Townsend.
Asked for, um, in conjunction
with the chair.
To because some New Mexico
residents own more than one
property and
Uh, it's not perfect. There, I
have come to the conclusion
myself that there is no perfect
way of doing it. What I think
Uh
In a webinar with the
Insurance
Business and home safety
institute.
We asked them about the average
cost of retrofitting, and we're
told that it is typically
between $30,007,000. I think
that's low. I would round that
up.
Uh, that's exclusive of a roof
replacement.
And I think what we're trying to
get at is that the neighborhood
scale of action is important.
That people's ability to pay is
going to vary.
And
I know Representative Vincent
has some examples from his
community where it's not about
where you are relative to the
property.
Uh, or to the poverty level,
it's about the scale of the
losses you've already incurred
from wildfire.
So, um.
What as written this bill would
give the task force some
discretion to
Hammer all those details out.
For eligibility.
Which the legislature may or may
not.
want to do.
Well, the, the problem is, if
you get an elderly person and
they can't afford it.
And they live in the same
neighborhood that someone else
built the $250,000 home and
they're living $100,000 home.
If you say this person is
eligible because of age
criteria, but you're not because
you're value home value is, and
you're trying to harden the
whole neighborhood, save the
whole neighborhood. I don't.
I mean this is gonna probably be
the toughest portion of this
building, you're gonna have to
handle in the building codes
which.
I don't really trust, but I
mean.
How are you gonna pick when
One person has coyote fences and
firewood stacked and
As as a shingle growth and.
Trees around their house and
their wife, you could cut down
the tree and the wife would go
to Home Depot and buy a new tree
and make you dig the hole.
And put the tree back the minute
you're gone after you paid to
have it removed.
Uh, center compass is laughing,
but his wife must tell him the
same thing my wife tells me,
right? And, and so that's my, I
mean, that, that's a tough
question to answer. I mean,
I, I mean, if we're going to do
this, I think, I don't, I don't
know how you're gonna handle
that. That's like the impossible
thing to handle.
I mean
You know, we had wildfires in my
district on the Navajo
reservation in the middle of
winter, right?
Yeah
Are they eligible or ineligible
in tribal lands, right? And what
qualifies the priority.
Um, we know wildfires can
happen. It's so dry out there
right now, I mean.
We know they're gonna happen.
They could be brush fires, they
could be dry land fires, but I
mean,
People are gonna say, well,
Why don't I qualify, right?
I mean, insurance company told
me the other day, oh, we're not
going to insure your house and I
have an insulated concrete form
house, right, that's
pretty much form on the inside
and outside and concrete walls.
I'm like, my house is gonna
burn, right? It's all gravel
around.
Other than the trees, my wife
makes me plant the trioinon
trees made me say, right? And I
have a metal roof and
Everything's pretty much
concrete and asphalt, and, and
so.
But I don't know how you're
going to create the winners and
losers in this, and this, this
is
The hardest part for me to vote
in this bill is
What determines eligibility, and
I want to know that.
Hold on a second.
I mean, denial of insurance does
that determine eligibility?
So,
as we had our sidebar here.
Mr. Chair, we're really talking
about risk areas in the state.
And so your point is well taken
in terms of types of housing,
uh, people who have uh.
Don't have a lot of means,
people who are elderly, people
who have disabilities.
Uh, people who might be in
prefabs.
And uh in terms of the risk
areas, I don't know how.
The state forester with.
Addressed the entire community.
Uh, Mr. Chair, so we do have
decent risk maps already of the
state. We did have a special
appropriation that I don't think
made it into house Bill 2.
To um improve our mapping of
high risk areas and
Get a finer resolution so that
we could target this program.
In addition, the
Your question really goes back
to the reason that we have it
structured into parts and
The who's eligible?
It's gonna be different in
different parts of the state and
depending on different
circumstances where you have
high value homes and in
traditional communities with
elderly that are unable to make
the changes for themselves,
that's a different situation
from say a community like
Cloudcroft, where it's um.
A mix of
Year-round residents and
vacation homes.
So I don't know that.
I've answered your question to
your satisfaction, but I'm
trying.
Well, I mean, that's the
question gonna be put before the
task force, right? So then why
isn't the fire, you brought this
up, not me. Why isn't the fire
mapping not dedicated for this
task force to complete.
Uh, Mr. Chair.
Mm
The mapping is one of the
responsibilities of the task
force and today we've been
accomplishing that with
The, um, the operating funds
that the forestry division has.
We've never before this year
made a special appropriation
request for better mapping the
technology has changed a lot,
even just in the last 3 years,
and that appropriation request
was in the governor's um
executive budget.
And and so, but why isn't that
done?
In
Same time we're doing this task
force, so the task force can
make determinations of who's
going to be eligible in the high
risk areas, and who's not going
to be eligible if the mapping
isn't done, then we're kind of
shooting from the hip and
Go back to your other answer, I
mean, I just gave you an
example. Here's a an older
person in a home that
Is valued at this, and here's a
new person to the neighborhood
and their home is valued at
that.
They're eligible, they're not.
That's gonna be the question and
then before you do that, answer
this too in this other part of
this question. Once we do this
as a state.
And if something happens and
their home does catch on fire.
And we've finished it and
hardened it and said this is
what we recommend, and some for
some reason.
It catches fire and burns.
And they're gonna say
The state forester told me I had
to do this and in the heart of
my home and this would protect
my home from fire and what
liability are we leaving us out
there hanging once we've done
this to a person's home.
As has that been talked about?
Mr. Chair, yes, let me answer
the liability part first. Um,
that has been discussed by Ener
general counsels and
Um
I think they concluded that the.
This is not my area of
expertise, but that New Mexico's
tort law.
Would, um, provide the agency,
um, with the protection it
needed from liability.
Uh
That's what I heard them say. As
to the mapping, um, I see it
exactly the way you laid it out.
We should be doing this all at
the same time, and that's why we
made that, um, special
appropriation request. So but
Sure, the state agencies is not
going to be liable, but the
contractor or whoever is doing
the work on the home.
will be liable in some way,
shape, or form.
Cause they're gonna have an
insurance policy and usually is
a contractor, you have to list
the jobs you worked on during
the year.
I mean, I, I
Is the state gonna say, OK,
we're gonna, here's a waiver,
we're gonna waiver your
liability at you as a
contractor.
If you're digging and you hit
the gas line or
Whatever and
In your home still burns down. I
mean, these are
Real worldly things I think are
gonna happen, but
So, um, Mr. Chair, um,
Unless the general counsel for
Ener was here, um.
Having
run state risk management.
For some years, uh, the state
does pay out on state agencies
claims.
And if we had
I don't want to put this out
there.
I know what you're gonna say
that it's gonna be a big number,
that's why.
You know, if, if we have an
entire neighborhood.
Come through with the class
action.
For this, it would really wipe
out the state's liability funds.
So I think this
Issue of liability cannot be
passed on if we adopt.
A standard
And that's what we've put out.
So I, unless the um and Shelton
is here from Mnerd who's their
general counsel.
I think we would need to think,
hear their reasoning.
I, I think that's one that's a
big question in this, right?
What liability are we accepting
when we go to work on people's
homes.
For me, I'd want to do that. I
don't know.
No, he wasn't, he was late to
conservation on Saturday.
I don't know if he's listening
or not listening, but maybe he
can text you or something
that's.
That's one of the questions.
Senator Steinborn, you had some
questions. Thank you, Mr. Chair,
I do. Um.
So a few questions. So the task
force already exists and it
exists under M nerd under state
forestry, is that right?
Correct, Mr. Chair, Madam
director, um,
And you are requesting new FTEs
is a part of this is that, I
hear you say that as well.
OK, you know, I think a lot of
the questions I heard resonate
with me to the extent that
When you expect task force
members to kind of do work and
create this genius work product
on the bottom up, it sometimes
doesn't work. You need that
leadership from the top down.
So even though you're going to
have a task force, is it fair to
say, maybe, hopefully, that
really this will be kind of
muscle the day in, day out, 40
hour a week work product is
going to be guided by that, by
the forestry staff.
Mr. Chair and Senator, yes, that
is how I see it.
OK. And Mr. Chair, my experience
tells me that's the way it kind
of has to be.
Um
I want to then build on that by
saying, you know, fire wise.
Good building, you know, we've
been talking about this for
decades or longer as a country,
right? I used to work for
Senator Bingham and I remember
the Firewise grants and firewise
workshops and like this is not
rocket science, it's not new.
How to firewise and fire protect
your property and how far to
build out and all these kinds of
things. So,
Um
In a way, a lot of that.
Best practices are kind of
there, aren't they? And
Forrester, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair and senator.
The firewise program has really
fallen short of its stated
goals.
And
I think there are 2 reasons why,
uh, the primary one is that most
people believe that wildfires
won't happen to them until it
does and at that point, it's too
late. And now that the insurance
industry is responding to the
losses that they're
experiencing.
Um, both in New Mexico and in
other states, it's a lot more
immediate to people when you are
faced with your cancellation
notice and that drives behavior.
So one of the reasons for this
bill is to capture that moment.
Sure.
The other problem with Firewise
is that.
Uh, the standards are highly
variable, and right now, I have
people telling me all the time
my insurance company wants this,
a different insurance company
told me I have to do something
different.
But the industry is aligned
around the IBHS standards.
And that would be what we would
adopt. OK.
Thank you. Finally, Mr. Chair,
as far as the grant program
goes, good questions.
I would assume that you, you're
department, your division would
come up with a grant program.
It would look at
Income
Risk
You kind of make a grant program
based upon your capacity to pay,
your risk, etc. etc. Yeah, it
wouldn't be just arbitrary to.
But with a thoughtful grant
program, yeah, Mr. Chair and
Senator, that's correct, we
would have a matrix with ranges
and um an ability to
systematically for those
neighborhoods make those
decisions.
Final question for you is,
Given the changing nature of
risk, insurance exposure, etc.s
insurance companies saying we're
no longer going to cover you,
whatever. Are they?
Putting requirements on
homeowners now to say you have
to take these 5 steps or we're
not going to cover you, such
that you have that leverage.
Going into trying to fire
protect the community, that the
insurance industry themselves is
making a requirement on a large
percentage of those homeowners.
that the case, Mr. Chair and
Senator, that's correct. So in a
sense, that being said, if
that's the case, Mister Chair, a
grant program can help augment
that kind of environment by
taking care of people who maybe
don't have the means to do that.
Whereas a lot of neighbors do.
Mr. Chair and Senator, yes, yes.
So all that being said, I think
this is a great step forward,
and I know it's gonna require a
lot of leadership from the
division to, do you have the FTs
to do this if we didn't give you
the FTEs.
Uh, Mr. Chair and Senator, no.
So I think that's crucial that
if we wanted it to work, we need
to provide.
Fees for the leadership, but,
uh, I think it's really timely
and important a lot of the
Mexicans. So thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you, Director,
Senator and representative.
So there you have a question.
No, I was just, I was, do we
have a motion? No, we don't have
a motion, but let me ask you
something. I really want to see
what the state's liability is in
this before we let this go on.
You heard some comments from
committee members. We'll put it
back on the agenda for tomorrow
morning.
Go right with you man. I, I, I,
I wanna understand the liability
portion. I really want to
understand that. Yes, and Mr.
Chair, I texted, uh, Ben Shelton
and uh we can make sure that
he's available with us tomorrow
to discuss this. OK.
And you heard some of the
comments, I mean, I would really
like to see not represented, but
then require them to be there.
I'd like to see the mapping
portion required in this to get
it done.
Even if we have to fix that a
little bit on the Senate side.
So that we get it completed,
since we don't know what the
house is done.
We don't know if the 20 million
is in there or not, that we
don't know that till the next
week.
Um, and one more question. What
about if a homeowner?
Us as as a VRBO. I mean, there's
a lot of home buyers. This is a
business model for them, and
they buy in certain areas, I
mean, Santa Fe is one of them
that they buy homes in and do
that a lot in Rioidoso and they
use them as ve ROs.
And
Help and they're running it as a
business and this requires under
business that they that they're
covered.
How would that be handled?
That's another question I have.
Mr. Chair, uh, to me that would
be if a person's making an
income off of the property, I
would hope that they would have
the 300 to $10,000 to do the
upgrades.
Uh, to be fire safe and if they
don't, they're jeopardizing the
rest of the neighborhood.
Well, you can't force somebody
to do this, just like you're not
gonna be able to force somebody.
To cut down their tree that
their husband planted 20 some
years ago.
In their front yard.
And so that's gonna be the
question, but I mean,
It, it, I think it's said, I
read in here somewhere it says
businesses too, and if that's a
business model that they're
using in business, then they're
eligible for that.
So that's one other question,
so.
I know those are the questions
that I, I want the task force,
uh,
Fire mapping in the task force
in here so they can get it done
and accomplished. That'll get it
done by December, senator.
In that timeline, it will force
them to do that and not wait to
do that, and then we'll have a
pretty good plan of what it's
gonna look like.
What would that number look like
if we had to put it in, or what
was the exact request for the
fire mapping or.
Mr. Chair
20 million was the executive
request.
Yeah, but what's the real cost,
not the.
Governors
guessing list.
by my maths.
20 million
Gets us about 2000 homes.
No, no, no, no, I'm not talking
about that for the, the fire
mapping the excuse me, Mr.
Chair, um, our request was
800,000 for the mapping.
We can make sure that happens in
order to get this complete, so
we're doing it correctly.
OK.
Because,
uh, Mr. Chair, do you want this
to come back as a Senate Finance
Committee sub.
Uh, whatever the cleanest
version is gonna be if, if it
subs it, I mean, you can tell me
no to some of the things, but I
think
I mean, Senator Padilla and
Senator Steinborn brought this
up and in, in the mental health
bills, right? That we want
decision makers and not people
saying.
That somebody else pick and then
send them when they can because
we know it will happen and
So I think that helps us make
clear decisions, however you
guys want to determine that, but
the liability portion for me is
in this state is probably the
biggest risk that we're gonna
have, and so we got, and we just
need to figure that out.
So, um, Mr. Chair, rather than
tomorrow morning, can we put it
off another day or at least till
tomorrow afternoon tomorrow
afternoon, fine, yeah.
It's fine and if it's not ready,
we'll do it the next morning, I
think that's because I think the
state forester has to consult
with her department.
For us.
Yes, well, to take, to take all
of your recommendations and
ideas and put them together.
I, I, I just and Senator Padilla
and Senator Steinbor made a
great point, and we've done this
for 16 years and then we just
wait for their recommendations
and then it doesn't happen and
if we don't have the decision
makers there, then it doesn't
get done, and I think that
really has to get done,
especially in this situation.
OK
So whenever you're ready, we'll
be ready. OK, thank you very
much, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee. Thank you. We're
gonna roll over 23 probably here
tomorrow morning trying to
figure out some amendments for
that.
We close and then tomorrow
morning, who do we have?
Oh, tomorrow we're gonna hear
SJR1.
So people are aware that's
legislators getting paid.
That Senator Padilla.
She
all those
And uh 80 Cent 81 and 112.
True
This gentleman, right?
Any other questions? We don't
know where they're at with House
Bill 2, we're hearing kind of
rumors, but
We haven't seen any sheets.
And so in a week that it'll be
crossing over.
Uh, and so then we're gonna
start getting prepared and to
kind of track agencies that are
asking stuff. I haven't heard
too many, uh, just a little
chatter here and there and, and
so.
That they're shortened
deficiencies.
So, sure.
Listen, do you want to give us
any indication, is there
anything going on with Gro
Junior at all two amendments, I
mean, there's all sorts of
I mean chatter in the building
there, there is no growth, I
mean.
Be honest with everybody in the
house and take respon they
didn't want to do, bro.
The executive really doesn't
like bro.
I thought girl was still kind of
growing.
I did too and it was a process
that saved us from sending
amendments. And so,
I don't know how we're going to
handle that because we have to
open the budget for the exec.
And while the House members are
getting their stuff in.
We're gonna have to figure out
how we're going to do that on
our side. I'm sure that's
exactly where I was gonna go. I
mean, if, if the thing shows up
with no capacity, but
You know, every house member
under the sun got something into
it. How, what are we gonna say
to our constituents who want
things done badly.
Yeah, and that's why that
And the app on your iPad is very
important.
I was the first one to fill it
out. I'm seriously, I'm just
gonna say of all of you guys, I
was the first one to fill it
out.
Mm
There's an app on your iPad
downstairs that says set a
finance priorities. Can we add
announced.
Can we keep adding we're gonna
gather 3 and then we're gonna
see how many match up so that's.
If you get more than that, we
can't track. It's like you grow,
right? You know, your, your 3
requests so we, we cannot, we
don't have the capacity to track
a lot.
in the morning and
OK.
OK.
Yeah, we're here tomorrow
morning at 9 and then
