The New Mexico achieved
technology maturation of the
business technologies developed
right here in New Mexico with
national laboratories in
increase economic development in
the state that's important Mr
chairman and members of the
committee to note that this is
not a new tax credit this bill
is really simple and it removes
an unnecessary fund which was
initially thought as a creative
idea but in reality doesn't work
the bill extends the credit for
nine years to support innovative
work to support New Mexico
businesses.
So we had initially said ninety
years to extend the sunset we
would like to make an amendment
that we can track and ensure
that it's on the floor that we
change that funds that from nine
years to five years we believe
that will continue to help us
now lastly this bill reverts
money from the existing frontier
back to the general fund.
Trigger is in its second year of
a three year pilot program and
so the trigger investment in New
Mexico are made and growing
technology sector resulting in a
growing pipeline of New Mexico
technology company is working
with the national laboratories
that's Los Alamos National
laboratory and Sandia national
laboratory to bring new
innovations to the market the
bottom line of this bill is
continuing this investment to
New Mexico companies by
stabilizing the funding and
extending the sunset once again
to five years is to invest in
high tech job creation created
creating more start ups and
capital in New Mexico now with
me I have Representative Harper
along with one of my expert
witnesses if they'd like to make
any comments to the bills.
On you talk the quickness and
gentleman it's just great to be
in from your committee.
Stay here.
He's already given up three or
four
we're gonna go to the audience
on June first.
In JD Bullington are you there.
Good ma'am in the audience
anybody in support anybody in
opposition anybody in opposition
on zoom
Center on the bill you said you
want to offer an amendment to
to.
The right now is the bill as
written Mr chairman it's a
ninety year.
It extends the bill by ninety
years we'd like to amend it to
make that a five year sunset
verses nine years of thirty two
might that's twenty twenty seven
is that correct.
So.
The verbal commit the amendment
that we of the amount of we
don't have any writing let's see
what we have available and then
a verbal amendment which is by
any objection to the amendment
seconded if you yeah.
Motion by Senator Rodriguez and
second I center Padilla seeing
no objection to the amendment.
We're on the bill thank you
bill.
Yeah would you pass from Santo.
Gonzales second by Senator.
Rodriguez and that as amended.

that twenty twenty seven would
be the sunset date if I'm
correct.

for the new path.
Senator Rodriguez second any
objection to.
Bill for a bill on.
Of us were informed throughout

Senate bill house bill sixty
seven extending the sunset for
the technology reading this
gross receipts credit right
thank you.
Give me one second look over the
bill if you want their share.
Thank you any objection to the
past motion impact me to call
the roll I think.
Racing some numbers so we got
the right that's what thank you

have that here back.
Get better sponsor.
Can I see your tend thank you
have a do pass we have the thank
you Mr chairman and members of
the committee will make sure
that it then meant is there on
the floor thank you thank we'll
we'll send amendment down on the
bill thank you.
There was a bill one eighty six.
This
to.
Show and tell.
Representative for
is.
Okay.
Your.
There was now that you're in the
chair we're gonna talk right is
really really slow.
Not a problem we'll talk forever
if you want to.
would you and explain Senate
bill one eighty six to us one
eighty six is a bill about
payment in lieu of taxes.
For real property.
We are.
We've had a lot of time in this
state.
And the reason for the show and
tell here in front.
Is to explain to you the
different property owners in the
state of New Mexico.
Then you can see the state of
New Mexico owns quite a bit of
property.
The little map.
What stated Mexico.
Waves.
The drive through over.
The other is the only
one in the green is for service
the.
Yes
Mr this.
The reason that I would show you
the the a lot of the checker
board here the side.
The state trust where.
You.
To the state.
When we became a state as you
know.
So what brought this bill about.
Is that in the budget a couple
places.
They've been asking to purchase
where.
And one of them was the L. bar
ranch and I'm sure you all heard
about it.
They're asking five million
dollars but what direction one
to try by is a thirty three
million dollar range and they're
going to do this with some
federal money and and state
money if what the thirty years
game and fish.
But I wanted to take thoughts
about that a little more
research into you something
about it.
The bar ranch is
The total cost of the deals.
Is around three three.
Thirty three million dollars
it's forty one thousand six
hundred and eighty six acres.
The annual property tax is the
eleven thousand.
Three hundred and forty five
dollars no one is that
important.
One is a property tax important.
That's how the local county and
other local entities get their
money.
So.
When we start talking about
taken that much land out of the
county this is Sandoval County
is what this is.
You start taking that kind of.
Property out in the county and
that much income out of the
county.
It's a big deal to the counties.
Now when I was
Presenting this affects it would
roll over in the question I had
with me is what I want and
school districts there.
If it was a big deal to the
school district why weren't the
school districts there.
Well I had quite a few school
districts.
Come on zoom and talk.
They set prone zoom from two
o'clock to seven o'clock.
To talk about this.
Today I did not get those.
Schools on June for you I'm
hoping you'll believe me that
they were there it's in the FOR.
Another point I want to make.
Is
who the beneficiaries there are
two these land tax.
You think well it's just kind of
government.
No there's of the beneficiaries.
Me I.
The question you might have is
are we the only state that ever
thought of this let me assure
you I'm not smart enough to
think something by myself.
There was actually some other
states it's doing this already
and lo and behold I think
California.
More than a one week low today
Minnesota.
Doing this exact same thing that
would I'm talking about doing
here with.
I'm going down here to it.
All right in the Sandoval County
in this particular Rancho third
talking about buying new sale
more.
Let me show you who the
beneficiaries are.
There's Cuba so on water
conservation district there's
what they call the contracting
hospitals you know we had a bill
in here just will go about
hospitals.
Sandoval County dept Sandoval
County operation Cuba
Independent School District so
Cuba
Capital improvements.
Cuba operation of.
Cuba technical tax.
Mexico state debt and you're
asking me what is New Mexico
state dept lo and behold you
ever hear the G. O. bond.
That's what the New Mexico state
did.
So we've got all these
beneficiaries but we're still in
dollars from when we take land
off the tax rolls.
What I'm trying to do is just
simply a fairness issue.
To get these beneficiaries their
money through a payment in lieu
of taxes so how would I go about
doing that.
I would ask.
This the state treasurer.
To us taxed revenue well
actually connection revenue to
go to the county assessor and
see what that property taxes
today that property was bought.
See what that private
individuals paying for property
tax.
That's what I would expect the
state to pay to that County.
Include taxes.
That amount why why would a
I
would go about how would that go
into the fund will land
proposing through amendments
have got a couple of minutes
here forget one minute here
through an amendment.
Before these for the state not
that much that property.
They would deposit within that
fund in the state treasury.
The amount of money for five
years property tax that property
tax would be as I say
determined.
Whatever that private individual
that private owner was paying
for property tax prior to
purchase.
So Mister chair gunmen for the
bill.
The changes that a little bit
the bills person actually says
that we're going to exclude DOT.
Excluded.
Okay.
In the other part is it tells
you how we're going to finances
Fund.
So Mister chair I would I would
move the amendment for.
And what hold on one second let
me go to the audience.
anybody on the zoo's.
Ford.
Anybody on the main opposition
nobody to anybody in the
audience and support.
You.
Chair Senators.
Really sorry hold the.
As you speak.
Mr Chairman
there we go sorry wrong button.
she chairman senators Robert
Rosen from New Mexico junior
college and we'd like for you to
consider this bill because it
does affect us the junior
college we.
Are supported by property taxes
from our community and that's
what you expect of us to go out
to our community to get that
support so the tax dollars that
are raised and then with this
tax dollars that could
potentially be taken off the
rules affects us and even more
so for the smaller colleges in
the in the more rural
communities because they.
They don't have oil and gas they
have property.
The other thing this just inside
stand rounds just texted me and
wanted to mention that the
superintendents group is also in
favor of this but he wasn't able
to make it here in time so thank
you for your efforts in this
field.
Mr chairman members of the
committee thank you for the
opportunity to comment this
afternoon to the river
registered lobbyist for New
Mexico farm and livestock bureau
we want to think Senator Woods
for bringing this for this is a
long standing issue that has
negatively and
disproportionately impacted our
rural communities our local
counties municipalities school
districts and other entities
such as hospitals institutions
of higher education and various
special districts receive
funding through the payment of
property taxes losses to this
tax base can make offering basic
services more challenging for
our local governments and create
fiscal instant instability
excuse me.
Additionally the reduction of
private property in our rural
communities makes them less
resilient and reduces the
opportunity for economic
expansion and opportunities for
these reasons we ask that you
support Senate bill one eighty
six.
Thank you nobody else in support
anybody else in opposition.
So we're on the bill.
Senator Woods has an amendment
to the bill.
The move I move the minutes for
discussion.
I move the amendment for
discussion purposes all all
second at the discussion
purposes there would you explain
amendment this amendment
actually excludes deal T. from
this payment low taxes and the
other thing it does it does you
have a plan to fund the the.
The fund to pay these.
what's on the amendment how do
you plan to fund that so the
committee plan for the state Mr
chair you fund this piece of
property that you want you say
you're the state in New Mexico
can you find this piece property
you worked you go to the county
assessor in that county can you
find out how much that tax bill
is you put five times that much
into a fund prior to the
purchase.
Senator plan to fund he comes
out of that agency that's want
to purchase that land.
Right.
Senator Gonzales on the
amendment.
Chairman of the Senator Woods
just a couple of questions so
So what happens after the fifty
year.
We chose five years I expect
them to put that in in their
budget from now when they come
into the finance committee in
their present their budget that
tax bill should be in their
budget from now on.
They know what it is want to put
it for five years the FIR says
what happens and we get really
broke and they don't have money
to do that that year they were
there five years ahead rather
for years ahead but they put
that in there graduated from
now.
Hello Mr chairman of the other
part is so.
You sent to put that amount of
what the fact property is.
I would just make a suggestion.
You know I would put maybe a
little higher.
Because you know at least for
all that you know Texas always
go a little bit every year.
Now the other part is no of.
That would keep you in control
even with the yield control.
So you know I would just suggest
to make a little higher than
what the property actually yes
because from year one to year
five you are going to have a
different.
The.
That's a good suggestion that it
could be also that we have we
require them to receive the the
the tax bill from the county so
they will they will know what
next year's bill will be.
That gives a five year window.
But it's still gives them the
county the ability to hand them
a tax bill and so I will this is
what next year taxes are.
Hello very well thank you for
that so suggestions thank you
for thank you center on recent
in thank you Mr chairman thank
you senator was for bringing
this forward and bring in a map
and doing all that good after
work
Just have a question do you have
any idea how much the state
takes under this power of
eminent domain
can't how can we visualize in
other words how much costs this
would be to the state do we have
a number even close to that.
See what we're gonna do start
from this day forward.
Yeah so so if someone if someone
say an agency comes up and wants
to buy the of our you know
that's what we're talking about
right now I've got the different
figures on that so we will know
what the purchase price it.
And we know what the tax bill
is.
So that's how the the agency
will know what the tax bill is
before the purchaser or and
thank you for for that I do
recall you nicely explaining
that Senator my only question I
have and I think it's a good
idea I actually think it's a
fair thing to do but but let me
I'm trying to visualize this
okay
we know that it's going to start
from now on okay but we if we
don't have any historical data
to show how much is it is the
state done in the past how much
land has it condemned through
the power of eminent domain for
example to see what the value
would be and I'm you know I'm
sure that the department would
have that it I don't see it here
only because some of the
concerns that were expressed in
the FIR Senator were having to
do with the the lack of of a
certainty of how much would be
impacted here as far as funds go
and so on even though I
understand that it would be from
from here on did you know one of
the having come from county
government myself I can tell you
that was one of the biggest
issues we have since back then
is that you know the state house
the power of eminent domain and
and you really have to sit there
at the mercy of the State.
Any time the state decides or
even even counties anyone any
government has the power than
the little guy could be anybody
can be private property or
otherwise can sit there and and
just be at the mercy of of the
higher powers right we turn the
governments in that respect and
so you know there has to be a
better way than doing that there
has to be a way to get to
grandpa grab onto the ownership
as an owner and know that you
have some remedies will in in
you're right.
Madam chair thank you senator
chair madam chair at the deal is
one and in a minute the way.
You know they'll say well we're
gonna give you fair market value
for this.
And if you don't think I'm
giving you fair market value you
can go hard proof.
We're gonna have to appraisers
then we're going to argue it out
and if you still don't like it
we go to court and everything is
in the big guy's pocket.
He's got the everybody in his
side he's got the low here she's
got the tax department he's got
everything the little guy got
nothing.
He's losing the property that's
for damn sure he's not going to
get around it.
And and because of that.
This at least keeps.
The county in the other
beneficiaries whole.
Does that.
The little guy may still loses
property.
But the county services part
lost the county chair.
The county route the county
everything they did for the
community colleges they're still
left home.
Yeah thank you center and then
and then this seems like it it
would make them whole
commensurate with the amount of
loss that you talked about at
the time from there on you know
Senator Gonzalez Mister chairman
Senator Woods had a good point
is you know between the first
year second year third year
maybe okay but the fifty year
may be costing more because of
cost inflation and property
going up and so on but that's
hard to do to quantify that when
is the first time right now is
difficult I understand but you
know overall I'm gonna listen
and I I think it's a fair thing
to do
yeah thank you Mr chairman leave
it at that a listen a little
thank you Mr chairman questions
on the amendment.
a motion on the amendment some
of.
Option.
Motion for the past centered in
dollars.
A second by Senator Campos.
Any objection to.
Questions on the bill.
Senator Steinborn.
Thank you Mr chairman this is an
interesting bill Senator
question and I got in a minute
too late how much help the US of
it'll be lost by the purchase of
the part that happens me good
I'm very.
I've got the tax bill from the
right here.
It says.
Rural the.
Statement of taxes due.
To Mr Travis Crawford.
Froome who passively Texas.
Let's see.
Eleven thousand three hundred
and forty five dollars.
Now this is from the tax.
Department this tax assessor in
San Juan County.
Thank you thank you chairman
Senator self.
Now what's interesting.
So have a couple thoughts I want
to express on this bill.
on this particular property.
I think yes they wanna you know
it's it's gonna be probably is
for a lot of hunting as well is
that your understanding Mister
chairman Senator.
Understands the game and fish
that won't find in the game and
fish businesses is is management
of game which is selling hunting
and fishing license right so
Mister chairman says centers so
you know it's all here say that
I hear there's some you know
Alcon the property or whatever
you know that it's it's it's
it's got some prize hunting
values so I guess question
number one is.
You know we can look at this and
lot of examples like let's say
you're requiring a piece of
property to turn into a state
park it's a good analogy because
it makes the point in both cases
yes we may be taking bills off
the table what were inserting
into the equation is maybe more
on taxes gross receipts taxes
for more tourism more activity
that's coming like we would if
we were buying a piece of
property for state park is a
much bigger piece of property.
So.
So I guess I wonder in the case
of no more specifically Mr chair
Senator how much will wash it
actually is maybe someone should
all because we already probably
have.
He plus licenses or whatever
being so right now I don't know
if it's generating local gross
receipts but.
I just I just put that out there
that it's possible that yes
we're taking away some bills
which came in lower taxes
federal money going to the
county with some new economic
activity is to try to mitigate
that fairness issue in a way
taking out one but the other
thing is is I worry with this
bill.
Is that this would apply to gosh
this would set a precedent for
all kinds of well months present
a law for all kinds of state
purchases right could be a state
park could be whatever which
case were literally doing
something to increase economic
activity in a way in an area and
in addition we're saying the
state has to pay money for this
loss of this one economic.
Fusion a pelt even though we're
doing it to create all this new
economic development.
So I don't
I can understand the argument L.
bar the the I think as a general
policy.
I think it's such a bad.
President perhaps for all the
areas of the state that those
things were maybe the community
ends up coming out has frankly.
Okay so those are yes please
okay I'm glad you asked that
question I've been thinking
about this.
Okay if I go by the L. more
myself.
How would not pay those taxes.
LFC.
Axis.
Would would probably manage the
range.
So that I would pay not only the
taxes but the council is that
right Dick see the cattle the
fencing crew that goes after
bills offenses the well then
that goes out there and fixes
the wells I would have to
generate enough income off of it
to do that above the taxes plus
rate mortgage.
Now you're telling me that
there's not a state agency that
can develop a plan to
participate taxes.
If it's a good idea if it's
economic development you're
saying well it's it's we're
going to back park over here but
it's going to bring this money
into the county the the general
group well then we're going to
use those gross receipts and pay
the taxes why would not be a
good idea what could we develop
a business plan to make that
work.
Is that too much to ask if we're
going to take land off the
public world.
Develop a plan to keep the
county hope.
Mr chair Senator it's a fair
point but you can consider some
some variations of your point
let's call it a department
health building what fees are
they supposed to recoup.
To to then cover the bills it's
not a lot of money for me to
Domingo eleven thousand dollars
it just goes to show although
property tax this difference so
anyway I put it out there you
make a great argument for it
so I'll still keep listening to
it
Yes I don't know you know the
FIR raises other issues like
constitutional issues the
committee chair over there with
this topic constitution is
probably research and that one
because that may be an even
bigger issue with this bill I
don't know I just want to raise
those issues that occur to make
but thank you thank you Mr
Senator.
Thank you Mr this is this is
been a problem for a long time
as as.
He deeded land comes out of out
of service so to speak.
Of San Juan County we have six
percent of the entire county six
percent is private property.
it's so you couldn't you
couldn't lose much of San Juan
County if somebody wanted to
come in and turn it into a state
park or something it would be
anything.
Of.
So this is this is been a
concern all over the place for a
while but I also see conceal
while we need the state Parker
it's going to generate something
new.
But that G. R. T. in lodging tax
on doesn't go to count that's
not county funds to the county
still has to take care of.
What the county has to take care
of especially the school.
So again back to San Juan County
loses power plant you lose a of
of money you lose ninety two
percent of the of the property
tax that goes to central
consolidated school district.
When you shut those students
ninety two percent of all her
property tax because what they
have no bonding capacity after
that Sen happens anywhere else
well maybe not to that extent
but that matter where you are in
a state if you take that
property off the.
Of the taxable portion it's the
school district that pays
because they lose the bonding
capacity to what they're going
to do I think this is great
because really it's going to
cost the HSD whoever the HSD is
eleven thousand dollars.
But it's going to save the
county that same amount and I
think that I think that's a fair
exchange we can do something
like that so.
Thank you so that out there for
you Mr thank you any other
questions.
All.
Most part this is not new.
You know we've we've been doing
of they might very you know on
so we've been doing the.
For many years you know we've
been doing exchanges.
And the.
In the twenty eight years that I
have been here I never have have
one come back and say this
really for us.
And also for the most part of it
does work and I'll give you an
example is so.
On the Davis family when they
sold the they're part of the
eagle nest lake.
And then the state required that
any did become part.
Increase the volume you know and
probably three times more than
what it was before so you know
call it does work you know but
in one way or the other than you
have no by the non you had
offered me hope park you know
it's a long list.
You know the so the state has
been involved in the
transactions for the.
Very interesting just want to
share that thank you.
Mr with you and make one more
statement there's not a question
just a contingency plan you know
there's a whole movie it's a
great teachable moment in a way
the whole movie.
To privatize federal lands and
it turned federal lands over the
states this is always been the
argument against doing that is
that you would lose health is it
counties actually get paid for
federal lands they get they pay
for federal wildfire fighting
which in the state of New Mexico
in any given year could be three
hundred plus million dollars of
federal wealth you know that if
you turn federal public lands
over the state ownership you
lose payment in lieu of taxes
you that are responsible for law
enforcement while firefighting
so the bill is an interesting
argument against privatization
lance in a way just on the tilt
issue and so.
Thank you.
Thank you.
With the.
I understand what you're trying
to use trying to offset the cost
of the counties in payment of
the taxes that's why we fought
for impact a because the federal
government sent those that money
to those school districts for
payment and the taxes for those
children same exact scenario
that the Feds are paying for.
I think there's two issues for
me maybe you can let me one is
the liquid color constitution so
when that transfers made from
private ownership to public
ownership in the constitution it
becomes non taxable.
But you're continuing on a tax.
ten agency in some way shape or
form to offset that to the
county.
That's one big question.
Have you guys thought have you
thought about that and how that
will the constitution what is
the drafters of
this.
Now I haven't research this and
put my best legal minds on it
but I I'm assuming that
California has some.
Kind of constitution saying the
same exact thing we did.
I can't say that for sure I'll
have to research but let me tell
you what California did.
California has a program that
roof referred to as bill P. ill
T..
It was established in mid last
century and designed to provide
compensation to counties would
land when and the program
overseen by the wildlife
conservation board now I don't
know exactly what that board.
The land going into this program
has remained static as has the
payment to the counties a bit
over eight hundred thousand.
Which distribution distributed
among two dozen counties.
The man has not changed since
twenty fifteen or thereabouts.
The path the payout ranges from
a thousand to several thousand.
depending on the amount of land
in Wyoming.
It's not for state park lands
however the Wyoming game and
fish page property taxes for
lands it owns throughout
Wyoming.
It says most other state and
local land is exempt from
taxation so yes.
It may it may be or may not be.
Constitution.
And I will have to look that up
but I'm saying that our
constitution is probably not too
much different than the other
western states.
I don't know in California's
constitution is but I don't know
if you want to follow their
trends are not.
That's one thing and then so let
me ask you this what if I don't
make the land.
What is there is there is no
sale it.
I'm saying the same thing you go
down to the sensor and found a
number gently in his work in the
state please the land tax.
Any time private land.
Transfers to State Land.
The state except the tax bill.
Let me ask you another question
just to read the constitution
in.
What about church would donate a
ranch which was a non taxable or
close to the boys get ready the
film on range the Boy Scouts
said we'll just owning that
ranch to the state.
And there was no taxable value
because they're nonprofit in
their exams.
And they're not on the tax rolls
currently in that transfer takes
place so then how do you justify
that base okay they were there
on the county before and the
transfer happens into big range
and what is the value.
By the way this would work
whatever's on the county staff
through this transferred to the
state if there was no taxable.
Value to the state or the county
prior to that transfer it will
be no trance will.
Transfer to the state.
That's all lands.
To keep the county so.
I think you get the gap McKinley
County is is eighty percent
nontaxable and twenty percent
taxable in the in the twenty
percent more at the biggest
burden on the tax and it's it's
hard for the twenty percent the
county to get the tax rate that
I get it.
I get I think what you really
want to try to do is create a
fund uses any transfers that
make.
These these tax funds payment in
lieu of taxes will be made out
of this fund for.
However much of value of the
sale and keep putting money in
that fund the hold harmless
clause for the county that's
what you're looking at is a hold
harmless clause for the
counties.
And transfers and acquisitions
are made.
Only the state properties maybe
not to churches and to other
organizations
I just don't know I understand
what you're doing there I think
your concept is director holding
everybody harmless for what
happens of because a state takes
a large chunk of dollars out of
the tax base for the school
district and everybody else but
I think you need to create a
fund for payment in lieu of
taxes on these transfers.
And do a little bit of research
on how they do that
The my comments to do so that's
a pleasure the committee.
Who
you the motion.
In the injection to the motion.
Join Senator Steinborn.
As objecting.
Sir would you have a do pass.
Thank you Mr thank not take was
shown to with me.
yeah might be interesting on the
floor there's no Valentine's
hearts on their.
Representative Harper you're
here for House Bill.
Let me let me just make the
comments you know whatever
happens and.
someone in the legislature and
what's happening they're still a
member of the legislature until
they resign or no longer there
and so we can proceed with any
action lawsuits that are not
here for other reasons.
Thank you Mr chair much
appreciated.
Representative Harper I think
you're really big on tax
credits.
Mr chair this is not really a
tax credit.
This is station for the American
red.
Exactly right Representative
Harper thank you so chairman and
members the committee.
If you purchase a car outside of
the state.
Depending on the state laws
there and where you take
delivery and first use you may
have to pay taxes in that state
their motor vehicle excise tax.
And if you bring your car here's
into New Mexico and register it.
You're still subject to motor
vehicle excise tax here but the
state provides a credit for any
tax you paid elsewhere.
So is prevents double taxation
like the chair mentioned.
This legislation essentially
provides that same.
Courtesy to the tribes and
pueblos in the state of New
Mexico.
Right now under current law if
you purchased the vehicle into
delivery on tribal land were
subject to that tax.
And then to go to somewhere else
New Mexico is still the subject
motor vehicle excise tax would
be a double taxation.
to pass this you'll get a
credit.
Remoting field excise tax rate
tax you paid to try to the
public and I do have.
Mr Hughes expert witness if
there any questions but without
all our happiest for questions
thank you Representative Harper
do we have anybody on zoom in
support.
Yes.
could you state your name we can
hear you but I don't know who it
is.
Sorry this is Katie this is to
tabling a registered lobbyist
for the public and we support
this legislation thank you.
Thank you anybody else on zoom.
I think that you need then I'll
recognize you with that has in
New Mexico eight but if anybody
in opposition.
The man in the room anybody in
support Mr trainer.
Members of the committee all
right to train the rest of this
The New Mexico all.
We support this bill thank you
very much.
Thank you anybody in opposition.
Then questions from committee
members.
Montoya said so we have a motion
by Senator Padilla the second by
Senator Campos I just have one
question.
The only one that's doing this
right now is yes my understand
right correct chairman yes.
And they are the Pueblo of.
Number on the.
And so does the mass Justice yes
let's see an expansion is cover
repairs or maintenance G. R. T.
or is that only X. only screws
on the sale do you like to use
Mr Chairman
Obviously we can't
predict what the flow of money
to do right now they're only
doing the servicing of vehicles
up in on the facility and then
of course generous gross
receipts tax and that's the that
it that taxes shared between the
state and the tribes percent of
cooperative agreement the
president to undergo provided
passed on the legislature
Presumably if this bill is
enacted yes we could begin
selling vehicles legislative
they can overcome some other
obstacles and state along the
are presently there but but the
fact is that this bill would
apply to any motor vehicle
dealership of the tribe might
want to have to bring onto its
lands to diversify its economy.
From Representative but about
used cars.
Is the the tax applied to same
thing social chairman great
question and and I think it was
maybe about two decades after
the motor vehicle excise tax was
but the fact.
They did it
used cars used to not be subject
to the the more vehicle excise
tax but that was changed so yeah
all used cars are such motor
vehicle excise taxes with.
Working the same way and then so
let me ask you offsetting
question so if I trade in my
vehicle because we did this and
I can't remember exactly so I
traded my vehicle has that value
and they were discounting the
server round numbers it was
fifty thousand dollars for a new
one twenty five thousand trade
there were only County twenty
five thousand dollar difference
on the on the cost House handle
now on how they'll handle this
yeah so chairman great question
and and this legislation is not
change how that's calculated at
all you're you're exactly right
if you if you are purchasing a
vehicle and your offsetting
the purchase price with a used
vehicle your only charge tax on
the price that you were actually
charged by that at the
dealership.
And so this will remain the same
in that office of the number
exactly yes we'll have a.
Sail on gasoline vehicles at
some point.
Very likely chairman thank you
we want to do passed motion from
Senator yes second by Senator

motion.
