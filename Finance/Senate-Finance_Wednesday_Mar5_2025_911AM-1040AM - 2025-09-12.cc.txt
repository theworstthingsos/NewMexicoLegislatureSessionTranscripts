appropriation, Senate Finance
information requests. So we went
through the House Bill 2, the
specials and supplementals in
great detail last week.
You flagged a number of things,
uh, for us to, for more
information, and this is the
follow up to that. So I can go
over this at a
High level or however you'd
like.
OK, Mr. Chairman, high level
will be good, OK.
So I'll just take a couple of
big ones on each page.
So
The first one that'd be good, it
was a house ad that'd be good to
follow up with, um, the house on
more specifics behind that.
69 uh transitional housing.
So there was 40 million that was
included in Senate Bill 2 for
transitional housing. So the
good news is everybody's on the
same page with doing something
about that.
Um
However, as you see in this one,
this, uh, the house version
earmarks 100 and earmarks 90
million from the 110 million for
New Mexico's two largest
population centers, leaving the
balance of 20 for the rest of
the state. So a question might
be, is that the right kind of
earmarked language that you want
to do in Senate Finance or not.
Uh, there was a question about
this small 1, 250,000. This
would be a new program at the
mortgage Finance Authority. It
does not currently exist. Uh,
there's currently not
contingency language in House
Bill 2. That's a
Uh, decision point if you want
to add that, Mr. Chairman. Next
page.
On, on that particular deal has
agency requested this money?
Not to my knowledge, Mr.
Chairman, we'd have to follow up
on that, but there is a bill
associated with the money.
OK.
The next page, Mr. Chairman.
Uh, crime reduction grants.
There was some discussion LFC
had recommended moving this
money to DFA.
Because the way that it was
being administered by the
sentencing commission, the
Grants weren't being evaluated.
There were some issues there. I
think there's a bill making its
way through to kind of reform
how the sentencing commission
does this, uh, so that's why, um
HAFC moved it back to the
sentencing commission.
Uh, Secretary of State, uh, you
probably, uh, been contacted by
them, so the 100,000 is intended
to help them move within the
downtown, uh, campus, uh,
there's space over at the
attorney general's office, uh,
the AOC when it moved out of the
Capitol complex received a much
larger amount, but that was
because they were leasing space
for a period of time. Whereas
the AG's building is state
owned, and so they wouldn't need
that lease money and we believe
the 100,000 would be more than
sufficient for.
uh, covering the moving costs,
if that's what the legislature
wanted to do.
Uh, next one, Mr. Chairman,
500,000 for grants to support
filmmakers, you've got one of
the largest, most generous film
credits in the country, uh,
we're not sure exactly how this
money would be expended.
These economic development ones,
uh, Mr. Chairman.
Uh, this, the first one is for
the New Mexico partnership LFC
had a modest 750,000, there's a
million.
In the recurring uh budget, this
would bump that up
significantly. That might be a
good follow-up with HAFC on the
intent if they can actually use
that.
Uh, within the next year.
He's next to 94 and 95, we had
some questions. They are two
separate ones, even though
they're both 15 million.
Um
The first one is to really help
with uh the ongoing operational
support of these incubators. Uh,
the second one is for
Uh, some of the infrastructure
costs to get the space in place.
Any additional information uh
beyond that I think would be
good to coordinate with the.
With German
They asked for.
They asked for.
525,000.
That was in the LFC
recommendation. It was not part
of the uh executive
recommendation, Mr. Chairman, as
you can see in the far left-hand
column. How did they get from
even 10 million to 15 million,
Mr. Chairman, I believe that
there's been work with the
economic development, uh,
department, uh, since the at
least the beginning of the
session on many of these.
Thank you.
So same for uh 96.
This is really uh to increase an
existing pilot program pretty
significantly that awards uh
grants for proposals and
advanced energy innovation and
commercialization.
I think that's been part of the
department's overall strategic.
Planning, same thing for science
and technology startup cost.
Another pilot program seeking to
expand that was in the LFC
recommendation.
Uh, the site characterization,
there was uh in both in LFC and
LFC and there's a a bill working
its way through. Uh, it's
basically to help
Map out and get out of the way a
bunch of the studies that would
need to be done to
Actually use different business
sites for development so that
when a company comes in, the
state can move much faster than
the way that it can right now,
having already prepped, uh, done
the prep work, uh, for getting
those sites ready to break
ground.
Same thing, uh, small amounts in
LFC for talent recruitment, um,
the HAFC may want to follow up
with them if, if that amount is
the right amount.
Uh, the next one, bioscience
Development Fund, uh, there is a
bill on that.
The next page, and sorry, our
footnotes ran over the, the page
marking, but it's page 5, line
101. Uh this is for an
executive, this is an executive
ass, so the house was meeting
them for technical assistance
for a healthy food financing
program.
102 was in both recommendations.
This is an existing program, the
outdoor equity grant program.
This program also gets funding
from
Uh, that legacy, uh, fund that
you created last year, so the 3
million would be combined with
the 565,000 that gets to help.
I think expose uh disadvantaged
youth to the outdoors.
103, this is an existing uh
program for trails and outdoor
recreation infrastructure
grants.
Uh, this has been wildly popular
and um used effectively by EDD.
This is another tranche to
continue those grant projects.
Line 104, this is creating a new
uh program similar to what you
have in higher education,
another matching uh program for
R&D where in New Mexico's a
national leader in that
particular area, so trying to
build economic development
initiatives off of where we've
already got the capacity and,
and talent. So this provides
matching funds for some of those
uh federal research
opportunities.
Should those continue, Mr.
Chairman, 105.
Uh, this is one.
That was both, no, this was an
executive. This is Lita.
It's got 76 million.
Question is, do you want to put
another 7 towards it on top of
the 10 that you did last time,
especially considering all these
other.
90 million for a trade support,
there's a bill making its way
through that. Uh, that would be
one to flag for HAFC for more
detail.
Beyond what the bill says.
110
Uh, and 1:13 go together as well
as another special that we
don't.
And 114.
Uh, as well as another one
that's not on the the flag list.
But basically, uh, both LFC and
the executive had
Uh, transfers to subsidize this
particular marketplace, one in
the executive was for statewide,
the LFC one was for Lincoln. I
think there's been a lot of
discussion about the best
strategy going forward at the
time this
Recommendation was coming out.
You had fires in LA that are
going to wreck the entire.
Uh, homeowners insurance market
nationally on top of the
hurricane market. So the
thinking in HAFC was set aside
some money to do some more study
to figure out how to do this.
We're not gonna be able, be able
to bail out the insurance
markets with $50 million that
would only cover 500 houses
statewide or even in Lincoln
County.
Uh, but then also set some money
aside as a as maybe a
placeholder, um, for that fair
program to, to keep discussions
going.
119, there's been a coup.
One strategy for these rural
libraries has been set up, uh,
permanent fund, as you
recognize, setting up a
permanent fund requires an
enormous amount of capital
savings versus what you actually
get in spending the thinking
here is let's start just putting
money out to the rural library.
So this would give each of the
rural libraries an extra $50,000
on top of the.
25,000, I think they're getting
from the permanent fund right
now across across the state.
So this one more time. Say that
again. How much would that be
total they would be getting?
So 75,000 total, I believe, Mr.
Chairman, so 25 in the
recurring.
From the permanent fund and
about 50.
We can double check the
recurring number.
I'm rounding.
Senator Gonzalez's question.
Charlesville,
just refresh our memory, how
many rural libraries do we have?
There's like
5858.
Thank you.
Everybody gets a little.
Mr. Chairman, line 131. This is
also related to the fire of
Uh
Just paying for additional
thinning and high-risk areas.
There's money in the capital
framework, uh, as it came into
the session, so there would be a
total of 30 million. Is that
the, the right amount? That's
for Senate Finance, you guys to
start working out, but that's
the thinking there.
Vehicle,
yes sir, Mr. Chair.
You say there's currently 30
million.
Well, there's 2 in House Bill 2,
there's another 10 that was in
the.
Uh, capital outlay framework.
And then there's also 12 million
contingent on.
Uh, a bill making its way
through, that's kind of like uh
preparation thinning uh for fire
season.
Uh, and then they get money from
the feds and then they also get
money from the legacy fund. So
spending money is.
Spread in throughout.
Thank you.
The 133, the vehicle replacement
that was in the capital
framework recommendation as
opposed to the back of House
Bill 2.
state engineer this was.
An executive recommendation you
saw a bunch of Rios um for the
same thing. This would put an
additional 5 million in for um
those litigation costs.
Uh, line 145 for the non-tribal
Indian water rights settlements.
Uh, we had a good discussion
about this in uh last week.
Uh, HAFC increased it from 20 to
25. Currently there's 20 from
last year's amendment that
hasn't been expended yet.
So a question if you want to
lock up another.
25 or not and how much is, how
much is in there right now?
Well you appropriated 20 million
last session that hasn't been
spent yet 20 million that hadn't
been correct. Thank you.
Mm
uh
Thank you, um, Sherman Charles.
And uh how much is required for
the whole settlement?
Well, the 7, there is no
settlement, so we don't know.
Uh, that has to make its way
through Congress. It didn't get
over the finish line in the
The last Congress, so they're
gonna have to start again and,
and, but
You know, the OSC has said that.
Whatever amounts we can put
towards it and get done, will
count towards whatever that
settlement amount is, but we
don't have the overall target
right now, so.
Mr. Chairman, uh.
Just a, uh
comment
But uh just reminding to the
members that this is like 29
years of work.
So it's very attached, very
contingent.
Yeah.
But at the same time.
Extremely important to the
state.
Thank you. Yeah, all I was
asking though, uh, senator was,
how much is the, is in the fund
right now.
And
Do we need to put
Add to that fund if.
If this year we're not going to
need to spend it on it, is what
I was thinking in my mind.
Mr. Chairman, uh, many of the
rest of these probably need to
be uh followed up on with HAFC.
I'm sure.
Go ahead,
chair and Charles, can we go
back to uh the office of
Superintendent of Insurance.
In the
is, are any of these tied to a
specific piece of legislation?
That you're aware of?
My 110, 110 through 114 is not
that's a pure.
Um, the fair program, there
could be, I'd need to research
uh which bill there could be
multiple bills actually related
to that. Is it related to Senate
Bill 81 by any chance?
This, the one that came out of
LFC was not related to any
specific
Legislation at LFC recommended,
but it was tied to legislation
that we expected to be
forthcoming.
But that was focused on Lincoln
County only.
And I think that there was
other.
Interest in doing statewide kind
of program, but to reform the
fair program, there would need
to be legislation if you chose
to appropriately.
Uh, so chair and Charles, I
don't know if someone in the, in
your office can just research
that for me and let me know what
bills those are tied to. I'd
appreciate that. Yes, sir, Mr.
Chairman. OK, thank you.
So I 194.
Uh, this is an ad from
HAFC, that's a good follow-up.
196, this is related to House
Bill 149, we found out, so
probably needs to uh add that
contingency language if you
choose to keep it.
Creating a supported decision
making program and the DDPC.
Item 198 was a recurring item
that was not recommended to LFC.
201
In 205, those were HAFC ads that
would need additional.
Follow up
Next page 213.
This is the strategic water
supply.
Uh, it's been amended.
Significantly from the original
proposal, there's 40 million and
House Bill 2 as it sits before
you today.
214, we found out that there is.
Uh
It should be tied to a bill. We
also found out that
EED wants this to be a fund
transfer because it can't expend
all of it in one year.
Uh, and it, it would be a
multi-year kind of appropriate,
really a multi-year spend.
So tying up 50 million there.
5 million exists with capital
outlay for this river Stuarts
program, this would be an
additional 7 million on top of
that and House Bill 2.
Phos, uh, LFC had recommended 2
million. There are some
questions about, uh, they've
been using some corrective
action fund.
Uh, for contracts to do testing.
Uh, for PFOS.
Senator Trujillo, thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Um, Charles, on that
line, uh, 217.
Would that funding be available
for local water associations.
This would be for enemy to work
with communities that were
affected by PFAS contamination.
Uh, to do testing to make sure
that those plumes aren't moving
into, uh, those water systems or
wells in in other cases that
were privately owned. OK, thank
you.
Uh
ONRT there's been settlements uh
that the AG has helped with.
Uh, this is simply transferring
some of those settlements from
the consumer settlement fund at
the AG into the Office of
Natural Resources Trustee um for
projects that they would
administer.
231
Uh, there's been a number of
appropriations in the past for
Uh, reintegration of offenders
back into our communities. This
would be uh an additional one.
232, uh, we've been making
appropriations to treat
hepatitis C in large
non-recurring multi-year
appropriations going back to
The 2020 GAA, uh, they wouldn't
be able to get through the
entire amount that LFC had
originally um
Uh, proposed out of the general
fund. So HAFC took those
savings, but left them the
penitentiary income fund.
Uh, for 17.8 million to continue
those uh treatments for
hepatitis C.
Next page 223.
This is other state funds
appropriation again, uh,
Many different places within the
budget for reintegration of
offenders back into our
communities. This is coming out
of a, a fund that the
corrections operates or has in
within their operating budget,
no general fund impact.
266 for preparation of
evaluators and school
administrators. This is related
to House Bill 157, so that would
need to be added to the language
if you chose to keep it.
The family income index program
that was a pilot program.
Uh
The spending aspect of it was
found not to be very effective.
The
Formula for determining how to
identify high poverty school
districts was determined to be.
Um, good, and that's built into
a funding formula change, uh,
replacing the at-risk index.
So there'll be more than
Close to $400 million flowed out
to school districts across the
state if that bill passes
through this family income
index, uh, so you don't need
this grant.
Uh, this would need to be a
follow up. You've funded
behavioral health stipends and
scholarships in a significant
way, including endowing them in
the last couple of years. This
was an HAFC ad online 284.
296 is contingent on uh either
House Bill 90 or Senate Bill 8.
For the veterinary loan
repayment fund, that's a new
fund. The, the athletics ones
were a grow type of multi-year
appropriation to allow them to
adjust their um finances.
To not have to fundraise for
basic operations and see if they
can.
Get on a more solid footing at
NMSU and UNM.
So those were multi-year
appropriations for 3 years for
each of them, 130 or 307 is uh
related to House Bill 137 and
complimentary to the strategic
water supply.
This is
This was not in House Bill 2 on
line 317.
To the Department of
Agriculture.
Bureau of uh geology for aquafer
monitoring and mapping. Uh, we
believe there is capacity once
you start drilling operations,
uh, to expand the 19 million.
This is part of a 12 year
proposal to spend over 175
million trying to understand
better, uh, how much
Water, albeit not clean drinking
water in its current form is
available for potential
exploration and being able to
turn it into new uh water
supply.
Uh, I'd like to back up 1 to
317, if I could. Mhm.
You, uh, uh.
You have identified the purpose
for that.
That funding that $10 million
right there we have, we have
not, Mr. Chairman, uh, that was
an executive recommendation.
It's not a program that's
existing that we've seen at
large at NMDA and
Most conservation uh programs
we've seen in agriculture
results in not necessarily water
savings translated to other
things, but, uh, greater
efficiency within the
agricultural.
exactly what we should be doing,
right?
We should grow more food with
less water.
Just, just flag that one, Mr.
Chair, if you would, and we can
follow up with Secretary Whitty,
uh, as well. We'll do that.
Thank you very much Senator
Woods.
Uh, Senator Trujillo, did you?
Um, yes, Mr. Chairman, uh,
Charles, first for some reason I
thought I had heard earlier that
the environment department was
going to do this, um,
groundwater mapping.
The experts for the mapping
itself are the.
Uh
New Mexico Tech.
OK. Hm. All right. Thank you.
They will definitely work with
the Environment Department, Mr.
Chairman.
And we should probably be
strategic with where we start
that for
Economic development purposes as
opposed to just knowing
something that's academic.
Line 419, uh.
Let's see, this is for major
road rehabilitation.
Uh, that was removed from the
LFC recommendation. There's
ongoing, ongoing discussions
about whether, uh,
We should be entering into a
bonding package taking out debt
instead of using general fund
appropriations
chair on that particular one.
But I, I have some.
I have heartburn.
About that, about bonding for
that, especially when we start
talking about
You know.
Maintenance. Have we, have we
got any maintenance money in the
budget, any capital money for
maintenance for our road
departments. Yes, sir, and
they're operating budget you do.
There is yes.
So this is not restricted
maintenance money at all.
No, sir, this is supplementing
road fund appropriations.
OK, this is actually a project
money project design that kind
construction is like, I call
them heavy maintenance projects
and you see them like repave a
portion of the interstate. Yeah.
And, and the thought from the
house was that we would bond
something for this money. Well,
the administration has been
proposing this bonding package
and so if that's the direction
that the legislature chooses the
the thinking was why would we
appropriate this money if we're
going to take out debt for the
same thing.
You, you're flagging, you know,
an opportunity cost of who's
gonna pay back that debt and how
are we going to do it and I'm
not seeing.
Answers to that. There's been
some discussion about taking the
motor vehicle excise taxes if
that's a free.
Free money, that's general fund.
Yeah you've had, I think, a
presentation on some of the um
federal funding discussions
about, you know, reining in
mandatory spending, you might
want to keep that.
Uh, funding stream and not tie
it up into debt.
OK, OK.
But I, I still
It's still not in agreement on,
on bonding for this if we've got
adequate cash.
Senator Tobaison on this point
as well as Lanier.
Thank you this particular topic.
Well, I wanted to go back to the
prior line on this page, is that
OK? OK, line 297 just for my
friends who think that um
student athletics are
overfunded. Um, could you, could
you clarify, you said it's a 3
year grow project for the 9
million, but then in the
additional information we've got
3 million a year for lobo
athletics, which would be the 9
million and then 2 million a
year for New Mexico State. So
can you
clarify that, Mr. Chairman,
there would be a, there's a
separate line item for the New
Mexico State one. We just
combined them in here for um.
Uh, yes, so when we talked to
both departments, they had
Concerns that you know
historically they've had to play
multiple.
Um
Money games in football in order
to just pay for basic
operations, you know, that's
when they're going to UT and
getting paid, getting paid for
that, having to play two of
those is.
Been a a challenge for both
schools, uh, to offset that,
that would cost money.
The schools have also complained
that their main operating
budgets aren't sufficient to
cover some of the, not the.
High dollar coaches salaries
that you see for some coaches,
but basic operations for
Um, meals and support of student
support services and 3 million a
year and 2 million a year, the
figures that we got a little bit
higher for you and him.
For the amount of money that
they're having to fundraise for
basic operations as opposed to
pay for the, the nice things at
athletics, um, normally does.
Thank you for that, um, Mr.
Chair, because I'm a part of
helping raise that money every
year, um, and we're supporters
of athletics and they are
definitely underfunded compared
to other D1 schools just in the
mountain west, um, we might be
one of the least funded in
athletics comparatively
speaking, so, um, you're, so I
just wanna make sure I heard you
correct. This 9 million is
actually what UNM.
Hopefully it's getting in the
grow for the next 3 years and
then there's a separate line
item in the budget for NMSU,
which would be 2 million a year.
Uh, so that'd be 6 million.
That's correct and it's a, I
call it a grow type. It's not
actually coming out of the
grove, but.
I've had conversations with both
athletic directors that we're
gonna want to see results uh and
so they should start developing
how they're gonna
Demonstrate how they're using it
and then what the results are
gonna be as a result of it. And
then how do we figure out a more
sustainable funding path to get
at what you're talking about to
ensure that we've got
competitive programs that take
care of student athletes. OK,
wonderful, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you Senator Lanier and
Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Charles, I just, I wanna
go back to 419.
Transportation.
So the exact as.
For 150
LFC said 188, and then we pulled
all of that back.
Because of the bonding. How much
is the bonding gonna cost us?
I mean, I know, I know you can't
give me an exact number because
the rate will change. Well, the,
the proposal that.
Um, I've seen and it could have
changed by now.
was for 1.5 billion.
With maybe a first tranche of
like
600 million.
And if you did
200 million over the next 3
years in cash.
You probably make money.
Because they wouldn't spend it
all and you get interest income.
If you take that in debt, we'd
estimate you.
Have debt service payments.
For
The next 10 years, probably an
extra.
10, 115 million depending on the
rate. So you'd be
You know, having the
pay a bunch of debt on top of
the 600 you get in cash if you
took it out in finance.
And I think that's exactly my
Mm
I, I don't understand, Mr.
Chair, why we're gonna
spend money
When, when we have the money
now.
Is transportation able to spend
what what we're giving them. If,
if we give them the 188, for
example, could they spin that in
a year?
Mr. Chairman, it likely would
not go out in that year, um, it
likely go out over a 3-year.
3.
OK, thank you.
All right, Senator then Senator
Trull. Well, thank you, uh, Mr.
Chair and, and, uh, Charles and
Senator Lanier's point,
absolutely, I believe they'd be
able to get that money out the
door in one year. As a matter of
fact, maybe 2 or 3 times that
amount. We have so many needs
where roads are concerned. Uh,
the question I had was on the
419. Is this where we can uh
with this at all, uh, help with
local and collector streets or
is this simply state highways.
There's a separate appropriation
that remains.
House Bill 2 for those uh local
roads of 100 million it's 100.
Yes, sir. OK.
And um is it it once it's here,
we can add language to that
line.
That has not historically been
done with the local roads, but
that's something that certainly
the Senate Finance Committee
could discuss it that's a
strategy you want to do. You've
done it for the uh.
State highways and, and
interstates with broad language
allowing flexibility.
Um, but I've not seen that with
the locals, OK.
Um, and, and.
So if we were to bond this
amount one more time, what do
you think we would wind up
paying for it? I'm, I'm with
Senator Lanier on this, and we
have dollars, why don't we just
do it out of out of pocket
rather than finances.
What, what, what are we, what's
the taxpayer gonna wind up
paying for 150 or 188 milder.
Mr. Chairman, I know the
packages are always different,
but can you give us an estimate?
The numbers that I've run are
like
Assuming that they take out 600
million, which is what they want
to do in the first tranche.
Versus if we did this for the
next 3 years and House Bill 2 of
$200 million of pop, we'd make
money doing cash.
They'd expend an extra 114, 120
million in debt service
payments.
Unbelievable, yeah.
Um, OK, thank you.
Senator drill.
Mr. Chairman, um, I note that
the Secretary for Transportation
is here, and I'm just wondering,
um, it's my understanding that
bonding money cannot be used for
maintenance.
Could we get a response from the
secretary on that?
Correct, that'd be for their
major infrastructure.
You have them down below, so
when we wait for that question
when we get the transportation
please and get through this
part. All right, thank you.
This chair, just real quickly.
You know, this is saying right
away accusation planning study
design and construction.
And can we get a list?
From DOT
On what projects they have that
is already that is already
accomplished the, the right way,
the planning, the design.
Up to construction, can we get a
list to see what is ready to go
in one year. We're all wonder
how much money you can spend in
one year.
If we could get that list of
what exactly is out there that
is ready to go.
In approximately amount of money
that they're needing to fire
that.
But
Yeah,
we can follow secretaries back
there listening, so I'm sure, uh
he's putting that together right
now.
I think that if there's a, a
strategy to do these annual
supplemental appropriations.
We'd want to figure out how to
work with the department to get
into a cadence where we're
actually funding that aspect.
Of it to go out the door to the
next fiscal year, as opposed to
here's a new tranche that we've
never had the ability to do in
the past and now we're, we're
programming it, but it's taking
3 years to start getting
programmed and then out the
door. So that's something that
depending on the strategy that
you do, uh, we would want to get
into that cadence of here's
cash, get it out the door this
next year.
So citizens can see the orange
barrels and smoother roads.
All right, thank you. Moving on,
Charles.
OK, great. I appreciate it.
Anything else from the two
gentlemen to your left?
OK
Come on, Joey.
All right, thank you. We'll move
on to economic development.
Do you have anybody here from
Economic Development?
public safety.
I think we were supposed to go
through that flag. Those were
some of the major, so I'm sorry.
OK, well, well, let's get back
to, uh, transportation question
then with Senator Trujillo.
Mm
The sector, I know there was a
question on, on transportation
with the Senator Trujillo.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Senator for the touch on
the Senator Woods's question as
well.
Absolute
Uh, real quickly, Mr. Secretary,
no, uh, Senator Trujillo was on
and the year after.
So Mr. Chairman, Senator
Trujillo, you're absolutely
correct. So, um, the, the rule
of thumb with bonding projects
is the life of the project would
exceed the debt service period
for the project. And so we'd be
looking at major construction.
For those projects, um, just to
clarify, um, Director Soli's
comments, so there is no
expectation that the Department
of Transportation would bond
$600 million immediately after
receiving the authority to do
that. Time to uh Senator Woods's
question. We have identified the
projects and anticipate that we
would exhaust 1 $1.5 billion in
authority between 2026 and 2033,
the initial, um, the initial
bond.
issue wins would be for probably
about $190 million. Those
projects would become
construction ready. We bond,
we'd get them out the door.
And then as we bring other
projects to production and get
them shovel ready, we bond
again, get them out to
construction, and so in no way,
shape or form, would we incur
death for the purposes of
bonding.
And wait for projects to get
ready for construction while
we're paying debt service and so
the calculations of how much we
would spend on debt service have
to take into account that we
would borrow against the 1.5
million over at least 8 years,
and we can provide you a list of
the projects, the construction
dates, um, that we anticipate
those projects would be ready
and then bonding would occur
just before we would let those
projects. To answer the question
about could we.
Spend $150 million in a year, I
answered with this. We spend
$100 million a month at the
Department of Transportation and
if you were to write us a check
for $150 million we would put it
towards 2 projects immediately
that would be Noga Bridge and
the border connector, the sum of
which we would need $143 million
to essentially match the federal
awards that we've received for
those two projects already. So
the strategy is.
We need money for maintenance.
We would like the bonding for
major construction and we would
also like to work with the
legislature, and we intend on
doing so over the next few weeks
on the debt service strategy, so
not only can we bond, but we can
increase our recurring revenue
to pay the debt service on those
projects. One last point,
Senator, and, and all stay
quiet, uh, is right now our bond
advisor is telling us that we
could anticipate a 3.5% rate on
bonds. That's what he's saying
is conservative. We just
refinanced our 2024 A bonds at
3.4%.
And so what we're comparing our
debt service to is what the cost
of inflation is doing for a
project.
If you can do $100 million
project today in a year, it'll
be 104 million.
4% just from inflation, the cost
of doing business. And so what
we're trying to do is do more
projects sooner at the cost of
3.5% in repayment as opposed to
kicking these projects down the
road and waiting for 56 and 9%
of inflation to impact what
they're going to cost the state.
So, I think generally speaking,
we can put a lot of numbers down
to show what the difference is
between what we're gonna pay
them in debt service and what
we're gonna wait to pay for them
based on the cost of inflation,
but the benefit of getting them
done with debt service is that
not only are New Mexicans
waiting for the money to
materialize to do the projects,
they're writing on those roads
while we're waiting for the
money to materialize. So the
benefit of the debt services, at
least we have the road projects
done.
All right, Senator Woods and
then Senator, uh, Truvill, the
only thing I've got to say is
What would help me?
Make decisions.
It's to see a list of projects
in your plan, what you've got
going right now, you, you, you
know, you, you've got them
financed. It's, it's a done
deal. The next one in the queue,
and I know you've got that.
The financing that's available
for that and just going down and
how far in the future are we
right now?
That's, that's kind of what I'm
looking at before I can make a
legitimate decision is
Show me the flow of the money on
how that's going because I know
you, you have money coming in
all the time and you're, you're
matching money and you're, you
know, like you say, uh, a huge
amount of money monthly.
And I don't want you to think
that we're not sensitive to the
fact.
That you're a money manager.
Because that's what you are is a
money manager and a contract
manager, and, you know, we want
great roads out out of the money
we're spent.
And so, but.
The 4 were wanting to commit to
something
what is asking, and you, you've
come in and provided information
before and I'm not.
say you haven't done a good job,
but
This is a point in time where
we're right on the cube, right
on the
Cliff to spend it or not.
So we need that information ASAP
senator the money.
drill.
Thank you, um, Mr. Chairman and
secretary, I, I think when I'm
hearing from this, I agree with
Sender Woods, we want good
roads. Good roads are critical
for, for all kinds of stuff,
economic development, for
tourism, we have to have good
roads. It sounds to me and just
a nod would be OK. We need both.
We need bonding capacity and we
need the funding, the cash for
maintenance.
Chair senator, that, that's it
in a nutshell, right? There are
22 different funding sources for
different purposes and one of
which cannot be used for the
other.
Thank you, Senator Lanier.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good
morning.
Um
I know it feels like you're the
one under the gun right here and
you kind of are right now, but.
There's nobody in the state of
New Mexico and I, I can
guarantee you there's no senator
right here that hasn't had a
phone call about the bad roads.
And so we are on your side. We
want to get you funded. We want
to get the roads in New Mexico
better.
We're just trying to figure out
the best path to do that.
Um, you know, my heartburn on
the bonding.
Uh
You know, 34, 3.5%.
Is, is there not any other way
we can make this work without
the bonding.
Mr. Chair, Senator, first of
all, we, I absolutely don't feel
under the gun. We always
appreciate an opportunity to sit
in front of you and, and, and
explain our position. I think in
in um
simplest terms there there is
that that would essentially be a
strategy that provides the
Department of Transportation
with predictable one-time
appropriations or predictable
recurring appropriations that
support our construction needs.
And the presentation that we did
a few weeks ago shows you that
the risk for us is this inverse
relationship between where our
revenues are going, which are
down and where the cost of
construction is going, which is
up.
And so the only ways to address
that are to add new revenue
distributions to the State Road
Fund, which is Create new
distributions.
Redirect existing distributions,
meaning that things like motor
motor vehicle excise tax come to
us at greater rates, vehicle
registration fees could come to
us at good rates.
Or you increase the amount of
money those distributions
generate, which comes by way of
fee increases and tax increases.
Those are three strategies. And
then the fourth is what one time
cash can be added to the
Department of Transportation's
budget to get these projects
done. And here's the challenge
with that 4th 11 is we don't
know for how long we're gonna
have the surge of revenues for
one-time cash. But 2 is we're
honest about our capacity. If
You give us 600 million or 2 or
$800 million right now, like
Senator Woods is asking, we can
tell you when we will get those
projects ready. Will it be in 3
years? No.
That's a lot of capacity we
would need to do that. And so
our intent with bonding is we'll
take out money as projects
become ready and that way we're
not paying debt service just to
have the cash available, and
we're getting projects done as
they become ready for the
shovels.
And so the alternative would be
as we come to you all, like we
have been in the past and say
this is what we have ready. How
much can you afford to fund? And
that's what's been happening
since 2019. We've received about
1.8 billion in one time
appropriations, the majority of
which has gone to maintenance
and roads.
And in some instances, the road
projects have been identified,
so we've targeted those and in
other instances, we've been
given flexibility, so we go to
our priorities and so we're
appreciative appreciative of the
one-time appropriations, but I
think what we're trying to do is
create this parallel track where
there's predictability. How do
we ensure year after year we can
afford to do things and that's
the challenge that's what
bonding gives us, at least for
the next 8 years.
Thank you. And Mr. Chair, so
that's kind of part of my
question.
So
You've, you've got projects in
the hopper right now. If we bond
a billion dollars.
You know, just for example, we
build a bit of or bond a billion
dollars.
And you spin that right away,
because just like you said, I
mean, we've got all kinds of
projects ready to go.
And, and you spend that bill,
then where are we at?
Then what, then how do we start
funding you again with the
entire scenario you just said.
It's not an endless pot.
Right?
Mr. Chair, Senator, you're
absolutely correct. So we expect
again that the bonding would
support major construction
projects unfunded construction
projects probably through 2033.
And so the bonding bill gives us
some predictability for 8 to 10
years.
But we've got to work on the
recurring revenue.
strategy for the state of New
Mexico. There's no question
other states are moving away
from their reliance on fuel tax
solely. The idea of road user
fees being implemented as a
policy is something that's being
talked about. There's a number
of things that we've already
looked at that we've spent some
time researching that we would
spend the next year exploring as
policy options for us, but the
bonding buys us some
predictability, the future for
the state road fund has to be.
Uh, focused on recurring revenue
distributions that keep up with
the pace of doing business in
road construction.
So Mr. Chars, what you're saying
is even if we bond you out,
we're still
We're still gonna be giving you
150, 100, well, probably 300
million a year on top of that,
correct?
Mr. Chair, Senator, not
necessarily what we would like
to see is beginning this session
is enough revenue to support our
debt service on those bonds.
Keep in mind that we're paying
110 million roughly right now on
debt service.
If we were to bond at our
capacity, which is 1.124
billion. The debt service on
that would be about 108 million,
a little cheaper than what we're
paying now. And so what we would
expect to do is get new revenue
to pay for the debt service,
then the 110 million we're
paying right now would become
capacity for us. We would spend
money on staffing up and that
would give us more capacity for
construction. To be sure
throughout the next several
years, the agency will come
again like Senator Tru.
said, for support, primarily for
maintenance and other areas like
wildlife corridors like
beautification and other things
that are critical that can't be
paid for with bonds. So we can't
say here that if we get this
bonding package done, if we get
the revenue for the debt service
done, we won't ask because I
won't be the secretary forever,
and so I can't commit the agency
to not coming here to ask for
maintenance and support in other
programs. It'll likely occur but
to the tune of 1.8 billion in
five years? Probably not.
OK.
And Mr. Car, so.
What would your agency do if we
just if we pull this money and
you just did bonding.
Mr. Chair, Senator, then we
would continue to work for the
debt service strategy and we
have some ideas that we want to
start working on over the next
few weeks, but 2 is we would
have to make critical priority
decisions around road
maintenance. Essentially using
state road fund to fund our
maintenance in the past few
years we've received to upwards
of 120 million a year for
additional maintenance support.
Without that,
We, we'd scale back to critical
maintenance priorities across
the state and that 120 million
that we receive in maintenance
split up over the 6 districts,
gives them capacity to do some
things.
Right? And Mr. Chair,
You
You said a, a wildlife corridor.
What, what is that exactly?
Sure. um, Mr. Chair, Senator,
going back to 2019, that 1.8
billion that I talked about in
one time appropriations. Some of
those appropriations has
included um funding to support
the mitigation of crashes due to
wildlife crossings in high
incident rate areas. So we
worked, I think in 2020 or 2021
with other state agencies like
Game and Fish to essentially
identify locations on state
corridors across the state that
are high.
incident or high risk rates for
crashes due to wildlife
crossings. And so the corridors
are strategies that don't
minimize the ability for
wildlife to cross the roads, but
facilitate it in a safer way.
And so those crossings are
costly. The number one priority
on those studies point to north
of Cuba on 580. And so we've
been working to close the gap on
funding that first project, but
I believe the
of total um at-risk high
incident rate areas was in
excess of a billion dollars on
their own, just in wildlife.
Cross.
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair
and
So my last question is,
What do you?
What money do you have right now
that that you haven't spent yet.
So, uh, Mr. Chairman, just the
rough math going back to 2019, a
little over $2 billion including
severance tax bonds about 500
million that's sitting
unencumbered of that 500
million, 320 of it came by way
of severance tax bonds just last
year. And so just to tell you a
little bit about the challenges
we're having with STBs for
construction projects. The state
will essentially sell bonds
twice a year in December and
June.
And so we've got a time out the
projects with those bond sales
so that once the bond sale takes
place, those projects are ready
to be awarded within a few
months. And so we, we went out
for bond sale on more than half
of that 320 million back in
December and we just let those
projects. So one project came in
over our budget by about 10
million and one came under
budget by about 10 million,
right? A good money manager
would say that's.
perfect will use the excess on
this one to fund this one, but
we can't do that because in the
STB appropriating language, we
can only spend up to a certain
amount of money on a single
project. So we can't use what we
saved on one project to fund
where we're short in another
project because of the
appropriating language. So we'll
have to fund that $10 million
gap from somewhere else.
And so the lesson learned is
when we go in June, we'll list a
3rd project if we can just in
case they come in under budget
again so that we could use the
excess revenue for that other
project. And so of the 500
million that's left unspent 320
million was appropriated last
year for major construction
projects through Severance tax
bonds, and then the remainder is
peppered out through some other
construction projects that need
to be obligated.
Good, thanks, because you know
what my next question was gonna
be the last question you said
one more question, yeah, no,
that's what I'm saying. He knew
what my next question was gonna
be. That's good. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, uh, Senator Munoz.
Thank you. Uh, Ricky, how much
unspent general fund do you have
at DOT? I mean, you guys
testified in-house
appropriations that you had an
amount. How much is in rural
air, how much in general fun
from last year and years before
that his remains unspent.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, that, that,
thanks for that. That was kind
of the question we were
answering now. So we have, uh,
going back to 2000 laws of 2019,
a total of 2.1 billion
appropriated. That does include
Mr. Chairman, some ARPA funds in
there. We have 529 million that
is not encumbered of that 329,
320 of it are the STB projects.
And so that sum does include
STBs. The largest sums that
remain unencumbered include
about 47 million in construction
that is being obligated to 7
different projects. Another 33
million um in 34 million
construction that is also about
to be obligated to those
projects, and we give you a
breakdown of those. Yeah, I just
want the general phone number
that you have on spent. What
about in rural air service? How
much remaining balances over the
years because I see 1.7 here to
there.
hodgepodge numbers and rural air
service.
Mr. Chair, let me, let me get
that exact number for you. Right
now, Ro air service pretty much
spends year to year. They have
they have statutory obligations
in the aviation division to
obligate 2 years at a time. And
so I'll get that number, but
it's likely a very small one.
OK, yeah, I'm, I'm gonna need to
know that because I know
Farmington is gonna do an
expansion and that's a dollar
amount, and I know there's, I
see 1.7 here balance here,
balance there, so get that in
total so we can get that
corrected. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you. So I think we're,
we're done.
And uh any other questions from
any of these topics from the
committee. If not, we'll go on
to uh Senate Bill 376 as
amended.
Senator Stefaniks.
We're gonna let Senator Wood's
chair for a minute.
He wants to work today, so.
You, you, you want this too?
No, I got it. I
good rap over here.
And a. We have two amendments
for this bill, Senator Woods.
We've got 2 amendments, uh,
Senator Stefani, for this bill.
Do you wanna?
Con.
Mr. Chair, um.
Members of the committee, uh,
the first amendment that I am,
uh, familiar with has to do with
actuarial.
Um, issues and we are totally uh
fine with having this. These are
minor amendments that deal with
the actuarial.
Uh, this is
Mr. Chair, 0.231544.1.
The amendment asks for actual
actuarly sound rates and also
for uh a yearly, an annual
actuarial, um.
Rejection or report and in my
experience in state government,
that's totally expected so we
see this as a very friendly
amendment. OK, so, uh,
Center, I'm gonna ask for a, uh
motion for discussion on this.
Motion for adoption motion for
adoption of Senate Amendment
number 1 for discussion
purposes.
OK.
Any objection?
Second, any objection.
OK.
You explained the amendment. Uh,
is there any questions on the
amendment?
Motion to not there's a motion
to adopt, is there a second, a
second Senator Trujil, all
those, uh.
is a unanimous consent to adopt
this motion.
Oh man
We need, we.
Is there any opposition to this,
any discussion, any opposition.
If not
Uh, I would.
Ask if there's not any
objection, we adopt the motion,
the amendment.
Correct.
Right.
All right, Senator Stefaniks,
we've got a, uh, your bill
amended.
There's one more amendment here.
And uh Mr. Chair Senator, uh
motion to move the amendment for
discussion purposes.
A second
We'll have a discussion on this.
Any, any opposition for a
discussion on this amendment.
OK, we're going to discuss this
amendment. We'll go to the
sponsor first.
OK, the amendment is 0231690.3.
And uh Mr. Chair, I just learned
about this amendment this
morning.
And I'm not clear.
That
Is this directed, uh, Mr. Chair,
at
Legislators. OK. Um,
Senator
Who brought this amendment
forward?
I did. OK, Senator, why don't
you explain the amendment, the
amendment currently says, um,
It is targeted toward
legislators, and if you make
under 150,000, you still pay 20%
of the healthcare costs, uh, so
it is targeted towards
legislators.
So, um, Mr. Chair, I can, uh,
are we on discussion of the
amendment? Yes, we are. OK, so,
um, right now we're not uh
supporting or opposing, but I
will make a couple of political
comments, um, the first is that
uh when legislators have been
able to purchase state
insurance, it turns out to be
pretty expensive.
And that it is possible that a
policy under be well New Mexico.
Might be less money.
Than what might be charged if
you went into this particular
pool.
So, um,
That's the position at this
time. Is there anything else?
So we're not opposed or
supporting.
OK. Any further discussion on
the amendment.
Looks like there's a conference
going on.
I'm asking for discussion on the
amendment.
Adoption of this amendment.
Amendment is the motion to
adopt.
A second commotion.
We're gonna have a roll call
vote on this motion. Looks like
there's a
Some discussion going on
all the wrong right.
Senator Brent.
Tinder compos.
Senator Gonzalez.
Senator Gonzalez votes yes,
Senator Lanier. Senator Lanier
votes yes, Senator Padilla.
Senator Padilla votes yes,
Senator Steinborn.
Senator Tobiasin, yes, Senator
Tobias and votes yes, Senator
Trujillo, Senator Trujillo votes
yes, Senator Woods. Senator
Woods votes no Senator Sendo,
Senator Sindo votes yes, Senator
Munoz.
Senator we've adopted
the and now uh
Well
Sure.
Madam
Stefani
please explain your bill. Uh,
thank you. um, Mr. Chair, uh,
the state health benefits plan,
which offers coverage to state
employees has faced a deficit
for years. At the same time, New
Mexico contributes just 65% of
the cost of insurance, the
lowest level of any state in the
country.
The healthcare authority has
been working on this data-driven
proposal for months.
I identifying ways to set the
state's health plan on a
fiscally responsible paths while
making health coverage more
affordable for our employees.
Senate Bill 376 is a critical
first step to achieve these
goals, the changes in this bill
reduce employee costs by more
than 40% on average, eliminate
the state health benefits budget
shortfall, decrease the
uninsured rate among members of
the National Guard, give public
local public bodies more
certainty around their costs and
save the state general fund 155
million over the next five
years.
I will turn to my expert
witnesses to provide additional
context. I have the dep one of
the deputy secretaries on my
left, Alex Castillo Smith.
And I have Colinbao on my right,
and so Alex will make a few
comments.
Thank you, Senator. Um, good
morning, Cha Munoz. Um.
I'm sorry, apologies. Good
morning, Chair, Senator Woods.
Um, members of the committee. My
name is Alex Castillo Smith and
I'm one of the deputy
secretaries for the healthcare
Authority. I also want to thank
the sponsors who are carrying
this bill, which includes
enerteanics and Sun
Munoz here.
Um, I also want to acknowledge,
um, my boss, Secretary Kerry
Armijo and my colleagues who
work so hard to reform the state
health benefits program,
including Colin and Joe Lu
Trujillo, Tina, who's director
of the program.
Uh, in launching the new
healthcare authority last July,
the governor of charge,
secretary or Mijo, the HCA
leadership team and me to fix
the state of New Mexico health
insurance at more than 60,000
New Mexicans depend on.
Uh, sun and Bell 376 does just
that.
As the largest payer of
healthcare in New Mexico, the
healthcare authority has a
responsibility to the market, to
healthcare providers and New
Mexicans to leverage our
expertise, partnerships, and
purchasing power as the largest
payer of healthcare in the state
to make the state of New Mexico
health insurance more accessible
and affordable, and with that
I'll turn it briefly over to
Colin.
Uh, Mr. Chair and members of the
committee Columbio the coverage
innovations director for the
Healthcare Authority. Um, I'm
just gonna speak at a very high
level about the five core things
that this bill does. The first
is that it requires the
secretary to submit actuar sound
budget requests. The second is
that it replaces outdated salary
brackets for insurance
contributions with an 8020 split
for all employees eligible for
state health benefits. This
brings us much closer to state
and local government.
governments, uh, as well as
private employers and uh when
these tiers were first
established, 1 in 10 state
employees were paying 40% of the
premium. We're now up to 77 and
10. And so that's why this uh
this part of the bill is very
important. Um, 3rd, this bill
provides a program to pay down a
portion or all of the premiums
for lower income employees
through the Healthcare
Affordability Fund. It also
creates patient protections for
initiatives related to the
establish.
man affair, hospital prices and
finally, it creates a program to
lower premiums for members of
the National Guard who qualify
for Tricare Select Reserve. Uh,
many of these folks, uh, are
uninsured right now and this
additional funding will help
them to get more affordable
coverage.
Um, as noted by Senator
Stephanics, this bill is going
to have a lot of positive uh
benefits for state employees,
local public bodies, and the
fiscal sustainability of the
fund, um, Mr. Chair, we have not
yet had a chance to um identify
the fiscal impact of the uh
Third Amendment that was
adopted but because legislators
currently do not um receive the
employer contribution, um.
The, there would be a fiscal
impact to that amendment, um,
and just wanted to make sure
that that that was known by the
committee.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
And, and with that, we should,
uh, unless
Since found that she had
something else to say. No, we
can stand for. I know there's
people here to support, uh, I
maybe I proposed, but I know
support and then we'll stand for
questions. OK, we'll go to the
audience. Hold up your hand if
you're in support.
OK, that wasn't an order
and uh hold up your hand if
you're opposed.
0 showing on a post. How about
on the zoo?
OK. OK, lots of hands of sport.
Let's go with 5 real quickly, uh
support.
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, Carter Bundy with
asked me, We want to thank the
sponsors and HCA, but I also
want to thank the Legislative
Finance Committee and all the
work that you've been doing in
the interim. This has been an
issue for years. It makes a huge
difference in the lives of state
employees and I know it will
help the state budget in the
long run as well, so we urge
your support. Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Chair, uh, my name is
Major Miguel Aguilar. I'm the
adjutant general for the
Department of Military Affairs
and National Guard. We'll just
throw a couple of statistics for
you. Thank you to Senator
Stefaniks and HCA for jumping in
on this. This has been a passion
of mine now for several years,
uh, and I'll just throw some
numbers at you. Right now, uh,
I, I know of at least 422
National Guardsmen who do not
have healthcare insurance. Um,
by the way, demographically, 83%
of them are under 30 years of
age, um.
87% are under the grade of
sergeant. And so this is the
force that when there's a state
of emergency, and we call them
out, they're the ones that come
out fires, floods, um, and the
Department of Defense,
interestingly enough, spends a
lot of money in providing an
opportunity to do Tricare Select
Reserve, um,
But they stop about $50 a month
short.
Uh, of allowing our guardsmen to
have unpaid health insurance.
This $50 would allow uh every
soldier who does not have health
care to have the opportunity to
have health care. Additionally,
if you are an employer of the
state of New Mexico are
including the state of New
Mexico, uh, and they're on
Tricare Select Reserve, you give
that employer an incentive to
hire National Guardsmen. For
example, uh, I, I'm a state
employee, I'm not on state
healthcare, I'm on Tricare and I
pay that premium. But if I were
on the state healthcare
insurance.
It would, um, I would give the
state of New Mexico a $16,000
break on the state's portion of
paying that premium, which under
this bill is about to go up, uh,
in exchange for $247 a month,
uh, and so, um, I asked that you
support this bill, uh, and
support our guardsmen who
support the state of New Mexico
when they, when it's necessary.
Thank you.
Chairman, committee members, um,
Edward Webster, I'm the
government relations director
with NEA in New Mexico. We stand
in support of Senate Bill 376.
Um, any New Mexico members, we
support all workers having
access to affordable health care
here in the state of New Mexico.
We hope the passage of this bill
will lead to an opportunity to
address and add K through 12 and
higher ed employees to uh the
similar relief from the health
care costs which are really
hurting our educators in the
state of New Mexico. We ask you
to vote yes on Senate Bill 376.
Thank you.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Erica
Sanchez. I'm with New Mexico
Center on Law and Poverty and
New Mexico Together for
Healthcare campaign. We stand in
support of Senate Bill 376 is
amended. We have seen firsthand
the impact of the current
coverage system, which is
unaffordable. Thousands of
people including our teachers
and public employees have been
sent into debt or collections
because of high out of pocket
costs that come with the
insurance and
high premiums cut into wages and
undermine the progress that our
state has made to ensure fair
and competitive wages for these
professions. In addition, the
Healthcare Affordability Fund
has had a significant impact on
thousands of New Mexicans by
bringing down costs for
individuals and small
businesses. We support expanding
the, using the fund to to
increase access by also
subsidizing premiums for public
employees under 2.
100% of the federal poverty
level and National Guard
members. Thank you.
Mr. Chair and Committee, thank
you and thanks to the sponsors
for bringing this bill forward.
I'm Megan Greene. I'm the
president of CWA Local 7076, and
I'm also a current state
employee myself. I'm not only
speaking for myself, but my 2000
CWA union siblings across 13
state agencies, um, asking you
to support this bill. Removing
the tiered system from the state
employee insurance system will
be a huge relief to our members.
Every year when we get the
legislative salary increase,
many of us actually end up with
less money in our paychecks
because we're bumped into the
next insurance tier. For
example, a 3% legislative
increase that would move an
employee from the lowest tier to
the next tier would actually
result in a 40% decrease or $40
decrease in that employee's
biweekly paycheck, which is over
$1000 per year, and that's
significant. Removing the tiered
system from state employee
insurance system will support
our low and middle income state
workers and their families.
Thanks for
your support.
OK
I will go to committee for
questions. Senator Padilla.
Uh, thank you, chair, and uh
thank you Senator and, and uh
our presenters, um.
So
The um
Is, is, is uh Neil Cooper here
or Kufer.
Any chance from the uh retired
healthcare authority or maybe
somebody else would be able to
answer this. I don't know, but
uh with the uh discussion we had
a little while ago on the
amendment where legislators
would have retire or would have
healthcare access to healthcare,
which today is just completely
outrageous. We can't even afford
it because it's, you know, so
I'm kind of happy to see that
some of our legislators will be
able to benefit from that. Are
they able to move from that plan
to retiree healthcare, uh,
should they leave the
legislature?
Mr. Chair, I am not aware of
that answer, so I think there's
somebody from the retiree
healthcare would have to address
that. I know that when.
Uh group benefits was at state
risk.
Management that legislators
could buy in at full price and
the full price was very
expensive.
But I don't know about retiree
health care. And thank you,
chair, and I know that's not the
exact focus of what we've made
some changes to your legislation
today. That's why I'm asking.
And then in terms of this
particular, so back to the
specific legislation itself, uh,
chair, uh, this is generally
gonna
Affect every
You know, nook and cranny in
part of the state, is that
right? What you're proposing
here? Because we do have folks
all over the state, is that
right?
Um
Mr. Chair, Senator, um, oh, he's
gone, Mr. Chair, Senator, uh,
are you asking about the state
employees?
Uh, the, yeah, the folks that
this legislation will positively
impact.
It's clear that state employees
and National Guard are all over
the state, uh, as well as the
local and public bodies. The one
thing about the um most recent
amendment we put on is, it
doesn't clarify.
Um, past legislators or
legislators going forward.
So that might have to be uh uh.
A clarifying amendment. Thank
you.
And thank you chair and thank
you, Senator. But, but back to
the actual original purpose of
the legislation, all the folks
that raised their hands behind
you. I mean, I'm just, you know,
kind of scanning the committee
here. I'm assuming that there
are guardsmen, folk all over the
state, San Juan County
specifically. I'm, I'm, I can
think of several that I know
myself there, um, over with
Senator Lanier, Santa Fe County,
obviously multiple, but do you
want to talk a little bit about
where, what the breadth of this
will do for our state.
Uh, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair and Senator Padilla,
um I'll, I'll share this Woods
had to go present bill. That's
why he disappeared. I don't
think you scared him off. He
just had to go in the bill. He
said, heck with this. I'm
walking out of here.
Uh, Mr. Chair and Senator
Padilla, we actually um created
a map um that we're happy to
provide to you, but it shows
that in every single county in
our state, there, there are
individuals who will benefit
from this bill from every
provision of it.
And, and with regard to um
You know, the others are their
levels for various types of
employees or do they all just
fall into the regular shoot with
where the different plans are,
and can you give us a little bit
of detail on what those are.
Sure, uh, Mr. Chair and Senator
Padilla, so right now, if you
are a state employee, you're
making less than $50,000 you're
paying 80 20% of the premium if
you're between 500 and $60,000 a
year, um, you're paying 7 or I'm
sorry, you're paying 30% and
then if you're above 60,000,
you're paying 40% of the
premium. What this bill does is
bring everybody into that 80/20
category and then if you are on
the, the lower income spectrum,
we now will be.
providing funds from the
affordability fund to further
lower that cost for those
employees. And I, I know that
anytime I've received, uh, you
know, the annual letter that we
get as legislator. They just
literally just falls out of my
hand because it's just so out of
reach in a lot of it, but all
the the leveling like the.
Silver, bronze, gold, ABC, all
that would apply to all of these
folks that raised their hands
here.
It would continue to apply to
those ones, Mr. Chair and
Senator, yes, the, this bill
doesn't change anything about
the plans themselves though we
do have a competitive bidding
process coming up where we'll be
looking at making some plan
design changes. All right, thank
you, Chair.
Any other questions, Senator
Lin.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
And the Fury went over this, I'm
really sorry.
So
I, I assume this is going to
come out of the general fund.
Is that correct?
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator, yes.
And how, how much
What
How much is gonna come out with
this, with the amendments and
everything added now. Well, Mr.
Chair, we can tell you what the
original bill did, but we
haven't calculated this new
amendment, so I'm gonna turn to
the deputy secretary.
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator Lanier,
just a clarification, that
For the original cost of the
bill, the 68 million in our
Senate Finance Committee hearing
yesterday. We discussed having
that money has come from the
healthcare affordability fund
potentially.
As it relates to this additional
amendment that was adopted this
morning, um, to the potential
expansion of benefits for
legislators.
I'm not
I, I can't really comment on
that right now as that was new
to me this morning too, but we
can do a fiscal impact analysis
to determine that. But the much
larger cause, um,
As discussed during yesterday's
hearing would come from the
Healthcare Affordability Fund.
That's a non-recurring uh
funding source and so what the
healthcare authority would be
obligated to do is in our fiscal
year 27 budget request, um,
request the needed funding for
this program as part of our base
budget, which we would intend to
do.
Yes sir, Mr. Chair and and
Senator, um, I think another
important point is if we do, if
we don't pass this bill and the
reforms in it, um, we actually
will wind up paying the general
fund will have a greater
obligation because our shortfall
for next year is $87 million
in-house bill too. So in, in
bringing that down to 68
million, we're actually saving
the state $19 million in general
funds. So I think that's an
important piece of context as
well.
I agree.
You think
So I mean this started for me.
Or
Exactly decided not to do
increases in health.
cost, right?
She throws it and
got a hole and dug a
Started backing
General fun.
Lash
was last year, the first year of
prior year was.

It was 86 million.
continue down that path and
we're paying the cities and the
counties.
So yeah, we
subsidize the cities and
counties, no more capital for
you guys.
That's what it'll come to is
what.
healthcare costs. We have to fix
this problem.
Mexico.
Uh, the legislative amendment
that the legislators still pay.
still pay it to the state.
He
on pay 20% of the cost.
Uh, so it'll probably be a
minimal cost to the fund, but
then you now get a bigger pool.
reduces some of the other costs,
but the bigger the pole, the
lower.
Um
We have to fix this. This is one
thing that
the legislature and
Skip the can down the road, and
now we have money, we might as
well fix things that we have.
money because we don't
How
to fix them.
So, let me ask you one question.
How many National Guards are
under the $50,000 limit.
You know.
Mr. Chair, uh, so the guard is a
little bit unique.
In that
State employees, so they don't
fall under the 60-40 split.
asking to do is an add on to
this is that you pay the premium
that the Department of Defense
pays the rest of and so if
Tricare, and I, I wish I had an
actual amount if Tricare was
$30,000 a year that DOD pays,
the state would pay the 50 to
cause them to pay the rest, um,
where, where you see benefit, I
think it's to the employers. One
is that we have guards when
they're now covered by by
healthcare. I think the other
component is for every state
employee that you have that
elects in.
the Tricare.
The state doesn't pay anything
else other than that $50 a
month.
Uh, to cover the premiums for.
Is that, is that helpful?
Uh, it kind of confused me, but
maybe.
So I'll explain that real quick.
I'm not a healthcare expert or a
health insurance expert.
Um
And we've done a preliminary
projection, and we think that
the healthcare affordability
fund could support about 560
members of the National Guard
with the way the bill stands
currently without admit. That's
correct.
I just want to make a comment. I
reached out to retiree
healthcare Authority Director
Neil Kiefer, who said that
legislators do qualify for the
retiree healthcare Authority, if
they had 2 years of service and
are no longer serving as a
legislator.
but they would pay the full cost
of insurance.
That's under current law
current law, yes.
OK.
Thank you guys. I appreciate it.
I don't have any other further
questions, I would move it to
pass a motion for a due pass by
Senator Padilla taken by Senator
Tobiasson.
We call the
Senator Brent
Senator Campos.
Senator Gonzalez. Senator
Gonzalezia, Senator Linier.
Senator Lanier votes, yes,
Senator Padilla.
Senator Padilla Bosa, Senator
Steinborn.
Senator Steinborn votes yes
Senator Tobiasin. Send her
Tobias Sibotia, Senator
Trujillo, Senator Trujillo votes
yes. Senator Woods.
Senator Shino, Senator Sendosia,
Senator Munoz.
Senator Munoz, we have a due
pass 8 in affirmative, 0 in the
negative.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Um
If you have some footnotes you
want to add to this or more
questions. Now's our time
because maybe we want to get
those to Adrian or start scoring
these, I I don't know if.
Bianna is back there listening
or not, but what came up today,
like, I'm sorry I wasn't here. I
had to build another committee,
but
DOT has a cash balance in in
Joey just came up and showed it
to me for the World Air Service,
right? They have 3 million
unspent 1 year and 1.7 the next
year, and I think we have 4 or 5
in the budget. So what is it
gonna take to, to backfill that
because Farmington wants rural
air service too, so we're trying
to get their unspent money
that's general fund that we
appropriated and gather it up
and then make sure it's all
there and we're not.
DC mailing things together and
they're holding cash back on us.
So
Yeah, a question or something,
this is something we're gonna go
over rather deeply again.
That's 1:30.
And, and then when we come off
the floor, whatever time it is
today, we're gonna come back and
do those 4 bills.
Get him out of here and then
we're probably gonna focus on
the budget. I don't think
there's, there's a few more
sitting here, but let's see what
happens, uh, in, in on the
budget, so we'll just start
focusing on the budget,
non-reoccurring, I think the
capital subcommittee needs to
meet, I think.
If you're on that capital
committee, they're gonna try to
meet sometime today, right?
Creson or Shindo is what
Chairman Lenty said sometime
today.
Yeah, yeah, you might.
Sometime today that they're
gonna remeet. There's a little
bit of a difference between the
exec and capital and that needs
to get wrapped up, we can start
moving forward.
OK. Any questions?
I have one on on transportation
again. So if you look on page 58
in our briefing,
It's, there's millions and
millions of unspent dollars in
there for projects. Are we gonna
be able to rake some of that
back, or is that?
I didn't understand what he was
saying.
So some of that he couldn't move
some money but he couldn't, can
move some other money. So if
they let a contract in the
contract is over, they always
hold the reserve, but if a
contract was let and they
haven't started, they're holding
that money.
I, I'll give you the example
that really irritates me. We, we
let DOT last year pick one road
in every one project in every
single district.
And said, OK, here's the money
for it. And then the secretary
went to Hobbs and told him that
oh he had to move their money
for that road down there, which
was the district pick.
And because uh Albuquerque
needed more money.
That's not what we agreed to,
and then he tried to blame it on
I-40 from Arizona to
Albuquerque, and, and I'm, uh,
my friends in amigos lit me up
and say like, why did you move
that money? We didn't.
Reappropriated the word the
agency said that they had their
one pick for everything in
everybody's district, so
everybody's district got one big
project, so that's the
tightening I think we're gonna
have to see.
In in in DOT, I mean, we put 80
million in for maintenance, they
move money off for not
maintenance items now and it's
just getting
Well, chair, that's why I think
we should.
This specific thing so that
there's no fooling around with
it later that bond package, I
think it's House Bill 145 or
something is coming over and so
over the next couple of days,
we're gonna have to figure out
if we're going to do that
bonding, if we're gonna allow
him to do that bonding.
And how much per year and then
how do we create those lists?
So I mean, it could that that
creating the list could just go
crazy. I mean, that's what
caused the problem last year
because we outthought the house
and the house got mad cause they
didn't have any say, but they
did have a say.
And, and so we're gonna have to
figure out how we do that if, if
it's 1 or 2 to to maximize the
whatever we're gonna let them
bond to each year.
But DOT is also come back and I
don't see Joey here, but maybe
Eric, it may not know this, but
we set a bond limit of $50
million all of a sudden they
took all their cash and moved
around and they bonded above the
$50 million.
And so they went excess of their
bond limit and so.
It's another cautionary tale of
Where we're gonna head, I mean,
the package now has $1.5 billion
in bonding, we're at the end of
administration, those projects
will not get better let till
this administration is gone, and
so do we really wanna
Let that thing
Whoever the new governor is.
Change the scope of work that
the legislature set aside, and
so that's the big question on
the roads in the bonding
package.
The house moved, we had 200, 180
million for maintenance in
completely took it out.
0 in in.
In
In the road fund for
maintenance, that's the heaviest
cost to the state. I think my
wife texted me an article that
says, you know, Mexico only
spends $24,000 per mile, and
they're like the 44th worst in
the nation for Rhodes.
So
That will be uh something in
motion. Senator Hill.
Mm
I, I think what I hear you
saying is, is that that 188
million really needs to be in
the budget.
Uh, what, what, what line item
are you talking about? I'm
looking at 419.
That's the Department of
Transportation and
Yeah, I, I mean, so currently, I
think each district gets $6
million for maintenance.
That's a lot. I mean, that's not
enough for just Santa Fe alone,
right? And and this district I
think goes from Santa Fe all the
way to the border.
Colorado border, and then
Almost a Farmington.
I think it does get farmington
and Shiprock, and so that $6
million in that larger area does
nothing, that's why they keep
asking for maintenance money and
maintenance money and.
To play catch up and so.
That's why last year we gave,
we, we left it as maintenance
money at 80 million, and then
they just kind of did what they
wanted.
That's the problem with
flexibility.
Tender Gonzalez.
Just on your point of um.
Where we are and uh if the
bonding was to happen.
One scenario was.
One governor
took all the money
A little.
That legislature was completely
out.
We like
And we might say, OK, 25 million
this year.
25 million once those projects
are bid and started and then
give them another 25 million.
There's ways to control that.
Um, but there may be projects,
you know.
Los Lunas interchange is a big
conversation and then 1 25
million more.
But on the state's portion is
only the bridge.
The DOT secretary agreed to do
the whole project.
So now $23 million short. We
didn't agree to that.
They did. And so now we got to
pay the price to get that done,
and that, I don't know how long
Senator Sanchez has been gone.
8 years, 99 years in that
project is still laying there,
and we gave them ARPA money to
do that project.
Well, I'm just telling you the,
the lay of the land. So I mean
those are, those are situations
they put us in. We, we agreed to
the interchange. We didn't agree
to the
The road and crossing the river
and all that, and, and now we're
on the hook for that.
You can get off the freeway.
can't drive it.
Well you can, but somewhere by
the prison is where that
interchange is going, yeah, but
you can get to, I don't know
it's one goes from Los News to
B.
OK.
Right.
