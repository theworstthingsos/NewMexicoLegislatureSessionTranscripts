Sorry about that know the exact
feeling.
yes Mr chair and committee
members I am presenting house
bill one sixty three.
Which has provided to
provisions.
that replicate I believe it
Senate bill five if that was
Senator Gallegos building on
solid and solid sorry I've been
until midnight last night and
starting at seven AM this
morning so I apologize if I'm
welcome to the club.
The ones that are replicated
from Senator Gonzales's Bill R..
The new solar market development
income tax credit.
The G. R. T. reduction although
Mr chair we added a trigger.
I
think we added a trigger.
That should revenues drop the G.
R. T. revenues dropped by more
than five percent the next year
that the point to I would be
right implemented.
We also have the disclosed
Agency provision.
I believe that's the sum total
of the overlap.
In the house propose.
Adding a so a social security
tax exemption that is means
based and for singles the means
test would be a hundred thousand
dollars for single filers.
Turning fifty thousand for a
dual filer and seventy five
thousand for married filing
separately.
We also added a small tax
deduction that would be applied
to feminine hygiene products.
We have a one time.
Non recurring.
Tax credit for nurses who work
during COVID at hospitals.
And most importantly Mr chair we
propose a child income tax
credit.
For all families in the state.
And we extended by a small
period of time a year and a half
or so on the front end of the
unsustainable building tax.
Credit.
I believe that covers the
overview of our bill.
That Mr speaker Mr chair.

Mr chair members of the
committee my name is Allison
Smith I'm a registered lobbyist
New Mexico restaurant
association we appreciate all
the hard work Sanchez put into
putting this package together we
would ask this committee to
please consider restoring B. R.
G. R. T. tax holiday for
restaurants that was in the
original version of this bill
the pandemic is not over for the
restaurants there's having a
hard time getting back up to
speed skating to their staffing
levels and dealing with this
issue and we think this have.
Tax holiday would be very and
the long way to help please
dining and mom and pop
restaurants and with a little
bit over the thank you for your
time.
Thank you know somebody else
madam secretary did you have for
I do that.
Thank you Mr chairman holidays
it in later ready for support
from.
I'm just here to strongly
support house bill one sixty
three I want to emphasize to
part the quarter percent G. R.
T. right and social security
exemption I want to emphasize on
the G. R. T. rating provides
recurring and significant tax
relief to all consumers and all
businesses across New Mexico and
it will be the first year to
reduction in forty years on the
G. R. T. rating has risen over
the years to five point twenty
five percent and with local
option the the rating something
is how this is now over ninety
percent state tax policy sound
tax policy excuse me tells us to
the tax broad based at a lower
rate since twenty nineteen New
Mexico did private space to
include internet sales and we
also do some reform for the way
we tax hospitals to broaden the
base now is the time to also
lower the rate this is bill will
help New Mexico businesses
compete with out of state
businesses especially in states
that don't tax services helps
lower income New Mexicans
because we know the G. R. T. is
a regressive tax.
And finally just from social
security I only want to
emphasize that this is this
provision extracted will help
tens of thousands of New Mexico
seniors for lower and middle
income they are more likely to
spend the savings and generate
additional economic activity and
tax revenue in the state thank
you.
Thank you madam secretary.
Matt
Representative.
I'm totally with you Mr chairman
I'm exhausted to.
We do have a substitute yes I
can I make one other point for
the record I'm I've failed to
mention that our bill also
includes a tax exemption for
armed forces retirement pay.
It's it's easy and over three
years ten thousand the first for
twenty twenty to ten thousand
dollars it would be exam for
twenty twenty three twenty
thousand dollars would be exempt
and for twenty twenty four
through twenty twenty six thirty
thousand dollars would be exempt
that that represents a sunset
which I would imagine would be
extended but it is good tax
policy to include sunsets on
on tax exemptions deductions
etcetera thank you Mr chair
thank you.
We we do have a service to
build.
Okay good cello bit about it
and.
The circumstances where and
under right.
Actually ninety five percent of
everything you had in the house.
Are you still in there.
I can adds rebate.
Or one fifty.
and seventy five.
And so that's it five hundred or
two hundred fifty dollar rebate
we extend that the tax time line
on the child tax credit.
the military section Singletary
remain the same.
This.
so security tax remain the same
solar tax credits remain the
same.
Okay thank you we disclosed
Disclose agents remain the same.
compensating tax of the G. R.
T..
We change that and figure that
at one eight for this year and
one eight for next year your
triggers remain the same.
sales services G. R. T.
deductions remain the same
amendment hydro drugs remain the
same.
And so
Under the largest cost of the
proposal is that the tax rebate.
Which would be and you have the
initiatives.
Three hundred thirty seven
extending the child tax credit
out for ten years a military
retirement so security so the
market is talked about
disclosed Agency in the section
of the G. R. T. in income tax
reduction
in the manufacturing business to
business G. R. T. we talked.
Have a motion to move the
amendment for Mr chairman yeah
okay it's an amendment notice to
couple times amended would move
the amendment two two two eight
two five to three for purposes
of discussion second.
Have a motion by Senator Padilla
moved amendment second by
Senator Rodriguez discussion
purposes Representative madam
chair do have a comments
Mr chair up I guess I would.
When I visited a little bit
before this meeting and my
understanding is the taught
child income tax credit is not
the same it starts next year if
it does start next year.
so as I said
Mr chair when we were visiting
our expectation is that the
child tax credit would start
this year.
I think I believe you also Mr
chair pulled out the nurses tax
credit is that not correct yes.
Madam chair yes you did.
And I believe you pulled out the
sustainable building tax credit
is that not correct Mr chair.
And.
I believe my understanding Mr
chair is that
the G. R. T. tax reduction is
one eighth the first year and
one eighth the second here is
that correct Mr chair.
So that's different.
Disclosed agents is the same I
would agree.
Mr chairman as I in our
conversation I mentioned we on
the house side on house taxation
and revenue and the leadership
on the house side certainly had
many conversations about whether
or not we should offer rebates.
In our view rebates.
Given the history of many
federal rebates over the last
two years we'll have very little
impact on in terms of support
for families that a G. R. T. tax
cut
would be more impactful in that
the one that we are proposing
would put a hundred and eighty
million dollars back into the
economy.
I recognize that on an
individual basis that seems like
a small amount of money and it
is.
It's our goal as we work through
tax reform over the next year
hopefully impart mischief with
this committee and the Senate
tax committee we will be
developing a long term strategy
for reducing G. R. T. I think it
should be pointed out that is
going to be a very heavy lift.
I'm very heavy left we looked at
proposing a point five percent
G. R. T. tax cut that pencils
out to I believe about.
Eight hundred million dollars.
I could be wrong about that and
secretary Schardin Clarke might
be able to correct me but that's
a lot of money to take out of
the budget.
And I think we're kidding
ourselves if we think we're
going to have one fell swoop of
the year G. R. T. tax reduction
it's going to be a long term
project as we evaluate ways to
replace that revenue.
And so I I believe this is the
time to advance the point two
five as we move forward we have
capacity to address it now the
budget
Created four hundred million
dollars and capacity for tax
expenditures this proposal
exceeds that amount I think by
over a hundred million dollars.
That has not been budgeted for.
So with that Mr chair I'm happy
to visit with you some on.
Questions on the subject
centered in.
I mean amendment.
Mr chairman and members so.
You know.
I probably have looked at this
now for only two minutes.
You know in the don you know she
did her best to going through
what we have here.
The I'm not in agreement with
the one point two five I want to
go with point two five.
I don't want to delay.
Okay.
The other questions substance.
I do have one sister on the.
Thank you Mr chairman I I do
have a question
What that who's amendment is
this one again we're heroes and
with little Russia whose
presented the amendment who did
it come from for me okay thank
you then at least we know where
it's from the net next thank you
Representative Chandler have for
free work on this then I do have
a question the the amendment
that's been proposed on the
gross receipts tax for example
it's been basically cut in half
we're doing half now and half.
Next year in twenty twenty four
the but still for the point
what is this for the quarter
quarter one percent that was in
initially initiated the question
I have is has this been
communicated
With that the parties that have
been working on this now for a
for a good while on this tax
package
can you tell me Mr chairman
since you're the sponsor.
sure.
So what we're trying to
accomplish.
Is the middle ground we got this
bill is in our committee
yesterday.
Read on the floor front
yesterday.
We met about the tax package
yesterday there was some
agreement on.
Everything ninety five percent
of what that house wanted or
what they sent over is in your.
Of the nurses gone missing she's
Mr Chairman I'm sorry I have to
interject here interject okay
well wait for my turn let me let
me tell you what.
So ninety five percent anyone
here this is scalable building
and the nursing is not a.
Everything else is in here.
The the G. R. T. triggers at one
eight this year and when the
next year.
And so.
The tax credit for the refund.
Are the largest portion and the
different.
Thank you Mr chairman and I
still would like to continue my
point is that I just want to
make sure we're on the same page
and that this is this is clearly
being communicated so that we're
all on the same page and can
avoid NA train wrecks in the in
the house to the Senate chamber
and the House and.
you Mr Mr chairman that that you
had been communicating with
other parties that have been
working on this but I do see
Representative Chandler saying
no so we're we're in the middle
here and I just want to make
sure that that we have
communication so that we have an
agreement that we can move
forward with or at least to to
to continue our negotiations or
discussions that's really not my
point
You know I I see that the gross
receipts tax
Reduction that we're talking
about was
you know here in the last few
moments apparently.
Cut in half and and so for now
and then pass the next year
so I don't know if this is going
to be something that's going to
go out here and then costs a
delay or a train wreck somewhere
that we don't want that we want
to make sure that we accomplish
what the intent really just and
so I have to listen a little
more on this and see Mr chairman
yes Madam Mr Mr chair madam
Senator I also point out that
something that is not in our
bill is the Business
destination issue that I believe
was in a in a bill that and that
was not mentioned when the bill
was described I believe that's
the the oil and gas issue that
has arisen in the wee and Eddie
counties if I'm reading section
the summary of section one
correctly.
A separate bill.
Is that not in this bill.
Mr speaker Mr chair.
It was a Senator Peter question
yes yes Mr chairman my apologies
What perhaps I understand miss
understand hello this is new to
house bill one sixty three
according to the summary Mr
chair that I received.
And taxpayer pre porting for
provisions for destination
sourcing.
Perhaps it would be helpful if I
had a better understanding Mr
chair but what that provision is
that is not in our bill.
Mr Chairman.
But I I respect I think that was
a separate bill with a whole
separate line item in a whole
separate I don't think that was
part of the package was it in
your package Mr chair of the.
Representative.
When you sent it over.
Mr chair members of the
committee this type of
destination sourcing alert to
what this committee also passed
in the Senate bill one thirty
seven is only section two from
that bill it would allow for
additional tax payer reporting
on where
are on the destination sourcing
pieces to allow
a better study of the impact to
local governments up
destinations or.
It was part of the package it
wasn't part of house bill one
exactly right but it is part of
the programs that I would.
Yeah.
Mr chair and senator that's my
understanding based on reading
the summary that was handed to
me and just so I may elaborate a
little bit we considered Senate
bill one thirty seven today in
our tax committee and worked out
I guess you might say a
compromise with Senator Kernan
that actually eliminated the
reporting requirement but
created a ten million dollar
fund that would help a
transitional period for two
years for areas that are
impacted by the the shift in
revenues to give us a better
understanding and get our arms
around Mr chair how we might
address that and so that is in
we pass that out of committee
this morning it was read out on
the floor today and has a good
chance of of passing so I just
want to point out to you this
issue is being addressed
and it the secretary of taxation
and revenue we spoke with her
about it and the concern was
the reporting requirements would
place a burden on small
businesses.
And it also would create a
financial burden on the taxation
and revenue tax department to
the tune of two million dollars
and she requested that we work
with Senator Kernan to try to
address that issue and therefore
we did not add we we remove the
reporting requirements at the
request of the secretary of
taxation and revenue and with
the concurrence of Senator
Kernan I believe Senator Kernan
is happy with the bill that we
passed out of committee today Mr
chair.
So thank.
We're moving works.
And so just because we got a
little bit of time.
I guess we could strike that
section if you already have
another bill if it passes.
the destination sources upon
that we created last year in.
Be honest I don't know why that
guy here.
I don't know if it was a
drafting error last something.
Looking at that right now.
I just need to.
Do that.
Questions from committee
members.
I do have a question Mr chairman
Question just as I'm trying to
read through this the changes to
the gross receipts tax of this
been obviously had not been
agreed upon by the house here
and I just wondered what the
outcome would be at this late
hour but I also wonder if it's
been communicated with other
parties who may have that may
have a right to concern and have
to initially propose this for
example
you know to has anybody
communicate with the executive
also to make sure that we if we
have a package that it's
something that we all negotiated
and agreed on or is this
something that we're going to
pass this out to negotiate
afterwards instead of before Mr
Chairman I'm trying to
understand Senator in the palm
of the whole tax back in.
We get in at the last minute.
Instead of having a little time
to work on getting yesterday and
then we're trying to figure out.
Hello we
have something significant
session and try to do it the
right way and.
Conversations pretty much since
we came up for is when things
got in motion and
otherwise we're gonna be issues
on the floor that.
The other bills from.
They have us back here on
Friday.
So we're trying to figure out a
way to make sure that
We get a tax package that.
The house to look at them
because the time.
The time.
We're we're struggling where in
that in a bind.
We're trying the ninety five
percent of what they wanted in
here.
they don't agree with the one
eight in the time frame.
but we also had that added that
rebate.
For the operation of the mist
Mister chair if I could make a
comment our understanding is was
that the Senate had the lead on
the tax package this year.
Senator Gonzales was carrying
the governor's tax package and
it was our expectation that that
package would be making it to
the house in due course as a
consequence we waited until
recently when we saw for some
reason some frankly inexplicable
reason that package had not
moved and I'm not quite sure why
that is but as I said my
understanding was that the
Senate had the lead on the tax
package this year and we work
from that when we created our
pope proposal
Just recently by adopting all of
the provisions that were
presented in.
Senate Bill I and so I just
would like to point out there
has been ample opportunity for
this committee and the Senate to
have made their proposal using
the vehicle of Senate bill five.
Thank you for that reminder.
But.
If we're at we're at today.
I guess
any other questions on the
surface to.
We're working on correcting
something.
The destination sourcing we
have.
Got this.
We're looking at a point four
version.
That that place because it's
been removed out another life
and.
Is that right yes.
As I said our tax committee
moved out Senator currents
Senate bill one thirty seven we
amended it she was satisfied I
believe with the amendments and
we hope and expect to get it off
the floor of the house.
Senator.
Mr chair I just.
On page nineteen I wanted to to
make a a verbal amendment here
if we can look at it under new
material.
This is a resident who is not
independent of another
individual and it was claimed
and was eligible to receive an
exemption pursuant to the level
of law which is liquor.
May be eligible the idea of the
rebate was that it went to.
Anybody making less than seventy
five thousand dollars not just
liquor folks and so I would like
to make a verbal agreement since
we don't have lines on here.
To strike the middle of that
paragraph so that it would read
a resident who is not
independent of another
individual may be eligible for a
tax rebate.
So.
Nineteen.
I thought you wanted me to go
faster when I was on the floor.
The poachers.
Okay so under the new material
on about.
The two thirds the way down.
A it currently says a resident
who is not independent of
another individual.
And who claim to be claimed and
was eligible to receive the
exemption pursuant to level off
of for the tax year would that
Loblaw is is elector.
In the idea of the rebate was
that.
People making less than seventy
five thousand dollars got it
whether they were liquor or not
so my proposal is to remove
those middle to census.
So that it says a resident who
is not independent of another
individual may be eligible for a
tax rebate.
So taking out the.
The middle to census is what I'm
proposing.
That make them.
Exactly Mr.
I it is tough to digest for
trying to to do this quickly and
haven't seen it but.
You know I I'm gonna wait to
listen Senator and see if anyone
else can have more comments
maybe it'll set in thank you Mr
chairman.
Representative.
Madam chair you have any
comment.
It affects the in order for the
rebates to work.
Mr chair I I didn't hear what
you just said I'm sorry because.
I do too many things at one time
like me yes.
And you're you're speaking
softly for change.
I don't have my mic.
I run at oxygen this map here
share made in an amendment
right.
In in center share you want tell
Representative what it is.
Mr chair representative if we go
to page nineteen of yes the
amendment that we're working on
yes many men your.
under new material about two
thirds of the way down.
Under a it says to date a
resident who is not independent
of another individual and who
claimed and was eligible to
receive the exemption under law
may be eligible.
The the blood loss of those
numbers and.
What I would like to do.
Is remove the middle to census
so it says a resident who is not
independent of another
individual may be eligible for a
tax rebate.
So it just it broadens it it
doesn't keep it to the low
income people to keep the people
under seventy five thousand.
Okay.
I hate to tell you this Mr chair
no one handed me that committee
substitute.
I was fumbling around looking
for it thinking surely I have
it.
But I do not.
Well if.
I do not.
Three.
Nineteen.
With.
So.
These lines to
speak to this.
No this these two nine.
Okay.
My apology Senator.
So what you're saying Mr chair
and senator.
Is essentially any resident in
the state of New Mexico that
Medicine means test would be
eligible for a rebate at a
certain level depending on what
their means is.
So Mr Chairman representative
yes if they make less than
seventy five thousand dollars.
Great.
As I said Mr chairman I
appreciate here your efforts
Senator but as I said we looked
at the rebates and felt
regardless of whether it's this
brought or more narrow they
would not be terribly effective
at this point in time I would
also point out to Mr chair and
senator we are entering an afoot
inflationary.
might say spiral I don't know if
it's a spiral or increase it's
you know it's an issue I think
we would agree at this point
and this amount of money I think
it's what three hundred fifty
million so we're talking about
for this rebate Mr chair and
senator three hundred and fifty
million dollars pumped into the
economy at this point in time
could easily add to the
inflationary trends that we are
in right now.
All in one fell swoop.
Madam chair medical.
Mr chair.
Representative.
Hello I'm trying to do is make
this year hi I I believe the
rebates.
Our cash in people's hands which
they will spend it will move
around the economy the gross
receipts tax that we're
proposing that you're proposing
is two dollars a month on a
family.
Two hundred two.
But I am just trying to make it
so that it's not just the lower
income but in trying to get it
up to the.
To the to the nurse in the tier
firefighters.
Mr chair and Center I appreciate
I I truly appreciate where
you're coming from and I I X. I
appreciate your good intentions.
It is our view and as I said we
evaluated that as an option
obviously
is it's not it will not be
terribly effective and
truthfully I I'm not I'm not.
I don't know
I am concerned about the
inflationary effect of pouring
that much money immediately into
people's pockets.
Because I believe we're in that
mode right now and that could Mr
chair and senator be
counterproductive to what your
intended goal is truthfully I'm
I'm just sharing my perspective
from the.
So Senator we're we're on the
amendment on the language.
I think this covers the
eligibility clause for all of
these at the rate there any
questions on center shares
amendments on the language
portion.
Thank you Mr chairman I just
said just to be clear this
doesn't change the fiscal impact
than that fiscal impact it takes
that into consideration.
Center no doesn't change in in
fiscal impacts actually drafting
more so that the ones under one
fifty and one seventy five make
sure they qualify for the
rebates.
Thank you Mr chairman.
You any other questions on the
amendment Mr Chairman and thank
you for for that done did
explained about the last one it
was a fix on the last one that
was brought up I have no
problems with that yeah but I
just I I'd like to just bring
out as short as I can
The comments that were made here
indicating that we're in a
Russian we're trying to we need
to basically get this out and
and we you know and then talk
about the differences later
it seems to me that it would
behoove us if this is for
cessation of time that it would
behoove us to do the agreement
first to make sure we get the
agreement first and then bring
it for a final vote instead of
regular for a vote and then
trying to grieve later the
timing Kurd to do the other to
go in trying to go shade after
we pass a bill here it seems to
me that it would be much longer
than if we went and did it.
And and and agreed on on
something that we know is Hey
passing and then bring it for
about
so the the argument about time
to me I have a problem.
With that because it's not going
to get any better it's going to
get worse in trying to negotiate
the changes we approve here when
in fact obviously the.
the sponsor here is it is not an
agreement for the gross receipts
tax weekly Representative or how
do you feel about the extent Mr
chair and
Senator Rodriguez I would point
out to you that our package tax
passed the Senate.
Revenue committee.
And it was through consultation
with that committee and its
leadership that we developed our
package we did not develop our
package in a vacuum we were
consulting with your the Senate
taxation and revenue leadership
as well as your Senate
leadership on this package and
as I pointed out we adopted all
of the proposals and senator
Gonzalez's and then worked with
the Senate taxation and revenue
chair New York floor leader to
develop this we also consulted
with the governor's office about
this package and they are in
general concurrence so our
package if it's move forward
will delay nothing and it will
likely get signed and and as I
said many of your members have
already endorsed our proposal so
it's Miss Mister chairman so yes
Representative so it's this
ammendment that is is the
discrepancy that you're saying
because the original proposal is
fine is this agree with
basically because it has missed
Mister chair Mister palletizer
mean for not police Mr chair and
Senator yes that's correct and
the idea of rebates were floated
with your taxation and revenue
chair in your leadership and
they concurred with our
assessment that that was not
enough money to go.
R. thank you very much for the
explanation so I have Mister
chairman.
Thank you for any other
questions on the language.
Mr Chairman.
So just to kind of just to try
to frame what's going on here a
little clearer I think what I'm
hearing Mr chairman and and
Madam chairwoman.
In the conversations we had
before we came in here and have
these conversations revving up
here and you've seen this what
is the likelihood that
Do you have any forecast on what
the house might do because we're
burning daylight here we also
have some members of this
committee that have some very.
Distinct requirements and how
this goes over the house
And that is what some of the key
components of what you're seeing
here so you want to give us a
forecast what might happen if we
send this over to your.
Mr chair and Senator Padilla I
think it's likely we will not
concurrent.
Senator Stewart on the let's

Chairman thanks I want to ask a
question about the the Shendo
bill that we added into this yes
just to make sure I'm looking at
this correctly.
The.
This is this up basically sunset
in twenty twenty nine.
I see that correctly on page.
Nine.
Number eight.
This honor after July first goes
down to zero percent.
Mr Chairman can I just interrupt
for just one second can we at
the minimum sentence to
secretary Schardin Clarke I
don't think she has a copy of it
well we're in this discussion
the staff with some of the
secretary she's advising the
commit or advising the committee
right now thank you.
I'm sorry Senator night I just
totally separate senator Kerry.
I'm secretary could you text me
or email I guess we'll run back
and use my personal scanner to
scan and send you.
Did you have a term of this
special she has so those scan it
for you just.
Then secretaries my understand
you have the FIR for.
Okay I'm sorry so we're back on
the.
Senator Steinborn yeah well just
look at it at.
At the FIR that's on your desk
for Senate bill twenty six
which.
Hold harmless for those that has
every provision in the bill and
there is a sense that.
Yeah I'm looking at the actual
bill and I mean I sit in front
of me I just want to verify that
that tracks with what I'm seeing
in which is a suggestion I made
when we have the hearing that
you to sunset so that it's not a
perpetual hold harmless payment
and and I would note all the
other hold harmless payments
since that same day the state
tracks with the whole farm with
sunset from all the other
communities in the state so I
This press.
Okay.
Mr
This to me asking other
questions.
Do we.
In the
that then actually represented
in the G. R. T. reduction do we
have a trigger in here if if
our.
For a tax receipts suddenly
taken those two of those times
with the triggers in this bill.
Mr chair Senator if you're
referring to my our bill we have
a trigger I can't speak to what
you have just amended in to our
bills.
Are not Mr chair and don do we
know that we have to we we leave
the triggers in place for.
Figure for me senator from Maine
in place would it change
anything thirty.
And.
The trick on.
B. and the.
The the thing that I'll note on
the triggers is that because
this G. R. T. right is facing
and and FY twenty three in FY
twenty four the trigger that
says look at revenues from one
you for one year to the next and
if they decline more than five
percent
from one year to the next that
it would resume the five point
one two five that provision
would not begin until twenty
twenty five this was in an
effort to take into
consideration and mentioned on
the FIR for the house bill one
sixty three at that you don't
want that provision to come in
its place the the same years
that you're implementing a tax
rate reduction because you don't
want the reduction itself to
result in the trailer being
trigger right thousands we bring
in
the deduction this is the years
twenty three and twenty four
this trigger with earth that
look back in fiscal year twenty
five.
Thank you.
That's all I have pronounced.
Thank you any other questions on
the amendment.
And we do have.
Secretary of Pam Stokes is
setting you that that amendment.
The other question Senator
Rodriguez thank you thank you Mr
chairman.
The system remember talking
about I guess just a making sure
that I understand the and on the
gross receipts tax deduction
that we're talking about the
point one two five which is a
quarter of one percent that was
initially and has been the
discussion throughout this whole
session that I can remember up
Is indicated here a few moments
ago that it's so small that it
would generate only maybe a two
dollar the two dollar savings
for people well that being said
in our center share brought that
point up I wonder why is it that
if it's if that is so bad why
are we cutting that in half one
eight is even worse so I
understand the rationale behind
this cutting in in in getting a
smaller gross receipts tax
deduction we should if we're
going to do it we should stay
doing something they should
remain doing something
meaningful that'll reach people
in a very this most positive way
that we can
so cutting it in half now one
eighth and given another eight
later on another year later
I just it doesn't make sense to
me at this point I would like to
see myself I would like to see
us go back to the.
Point one two five that we've
been discussing a long it may
not be as much as we would like
to give
you know the the constituent at
one point I said point one two
five yes here is that you have a
quarter of one percent and one.
The point two five I'm sorry to
sign one yes and
And so I just have a concern
about cutting it in half and and
doing that in that way Mr
Chairman thank you.
Thank you for any other
questions I yes Senator Gonzales
Mr chairman the talking about
the full amendment now or you're
still with the in the fall of
mental thing we have an
amendment we haven't a testament
to the million okay one that
will I like to propose an
amendment that all this is on
section ten and eleven.
And this is the reducing the G.
R. T. compensated for the acts.
You know by point two five zero
percent FY twenty three.
Then from there on scratch and
the other part of that sentence.
I'm really not Senator center
Senator Gonzales what it does it
restore the originally to the if
you're in the correct years you
need us to strike at the the
question is so the question
outcomes also can we move them
and for discussion purposes.
The second
second that for discussion.
Questions on Center this my only
comment is we would not be able
to for that that's actually
amended that much is bill and
went back to
Breaking everything and so
that's my comment Senator
Padilla it was the the similar
question what what is that
scored with that cost.
We did we just double what we
see here or.
Mr chair that would be roughly
another four million in FY
twenty.
Not till twenty twenty to twenty
five.
This is a twenty two year three
we take act became active in
twenty.
On the amended.
Representative Senator Gonzales
and that.
And for me yeah okay so if I
understand it right seventy
dollars
Shares of the bill delays the
full impact of the quarter.
Gross receipts tax cut it kind
of phases then what Senator
Gonzales is recommending is a
fully going to affect.
Your one at risk for FY twenty
three FY twenty three which
which would be the coming fiscal
year so immediately that that's
basically effective and to get
rid of the state Senate doesn't
now Mr Chairman just put it back
the way it works for you back
with us that would have
approximately ninety three
million dollar fiscal impact of
doing that that's what we say I
facing and that's what we
possibly going the full
percentage point.
Beyond that all other costs to
the Senate correct I believe so
it would be that's because
that's the perfect okay tension
thank you.
Any other questions on Senator
Padilla.
Just on the proposed amendment
to the amendment to the
amendment I don would you mind
explaining if we just kind of
went through the numbers right
now.
Assured Mister chair if in your
packet that does the summary of
the NM and if you turn to the
very last page.
The cost of a point one two five
percent reduction in FY twenty
three would be ninety four point
one million so in order to make
it eight to restore the other
eight so that it would be point
two five starting in FY twenty
three that would be another
another ninety four million in
FY twenty three would be the
cost of that.
making it effective in FY twenty
three.
And
Senator to the asset I clarify
the number that I just spoke
that later if that is the ninety
four.
Millions what's the other ninety
four yeah so it's on top so it's
a hundred eighty eight million
is what the real cost is yes
Senator Padilla rafia.
That maybe.
No it is it's it's a hundred
eighty three more than one R. F.
R. ninety four point ninety four
more what this costs okay so
nine hundred eighty it the full
cost of the is that but but as
far as what we're here to.
Thank you.
Any other questions on the
amendment.
So so Mister chairman is there
enough money in the operating
reserve to to add the other
ninety four million I I don't
know maybe there is I just.
because of our judgments on that
there would be no more room and
office is our first half.
So what we need to cut them to
make a seven ninety formal.
Ninety four million of the
rating.
Mr chairman and like.
I said I just these are real
numbers and we've got to make
sure we fully understand the
before we take action to enter
this thank you Mr chairman I
just want to mention that the
operate that the reserve itself
would still have a balance of
twenty seven point seven
percent.
Anyway numbers there's a
different one.
Mr chair
Senator this twenty seven point
seven it would be the the full
reserve all reserve I think okay
but the ability to utilize tax
packages and utilize that.
It would only be operating
reserve which would not have the
additional capacity to
accommodate that amendment if
the other rest of the package is
adopted the okay this will just
that reserve balances so I
didn't say which is our thank
you very much no problem all
right Senator Gonzales hello Mr
chairman well with your
permission I would like to defer
to our secretary to verify.
You know what we're talking
about in our numbers.
Madam secretary can years.
Senator Gonzales was asking the
question and we triggered the
full full point two five this
year.
The cost.
In the FIR from the previous
bill the the.
All of you have that from the.
Rex Mr chairman and senator
Gonzales so the question is how
much does the point two five
percent G. R. T. rate cut costs
in the existing house bill one
sixty three pack.
I believe that this question
what is the total cost in
terminal what I like to is that
what what what we have in place
we're being told we we can't
afford it.
And where are we as far as in
balancing that.
Chair and senator thousand I'm
not sure I can find all of that
probably as much as some of the
members of the finance staff can
because it has to do with
reserves the appropriation
levels but what I can say is
that the G. R. T. right because
it is projected to reduce
revenue by a one hundred.
One million in FY twenty three
and then that goes along with it
reductions the compensating tax
of.
Three point three million so
those two go together.
Thank.
Very well thank you.
Thank you any other questions
was small the point here that I
want to make is that the amount
was there in the end here if I
understand correctly prior to
this amendment because the
amount going now into the
rebates is what took
took at the end of some of this
quite a bit actually of this
amount so that changed the
trajectory that was being worked
on and now the the point two
five or did the yep point two
five this is
is not funded in this particular
amendment is this an eight that
it at a time so I wanted just to
clarify that it's and again my
apologies like the same point
zero one two five whatever
quarter of one percent point two
five thank you.
Thank you any other questions
amendments we.
Mr chairman I just on the the
piece of related to the nurses
that came out completely is that
right.
What was the the amount of that
I don't remember what that was I
believe in the prior bill is
nineteen million.
The
impact for Mr chair Senator for.
Nine point three million is what
the FIR showing on the nurses
rebate.
And that is not made up anywhere
else in the budget.
we remove that.
And in that what shifted towards
the the credits.
the rebate to.
So and then so that's that's
that's one item
the the second was on page of
the amendment page I think
thirty
items see.
So does this sunset seven years
and twenty thirty seven.
The thirty I just figured.
Of.
Thank.
That is correct Mr chair those
are the triggers this this
triggered a look back here into
the increase the G. R. T. right
quicker for twenty twenty five
to twenty thirty after which
after twenty thirty they would
no longer be a trigger look back
that would spark increased G. R.
T. really should have the
revenues fall under the
okay so so then after twenty
thirty just we take off the
shackles and you can do whatever
you need to based off at.
okay thank you.
Thank you any other questions
Senators awesome and then have a
motion.
Second that.
The motion by servants also
second by Senator Rodriguez that
we call the roll.
Revert.
Senator no Senator Campos yes
Senator Campos yes Senator
Diamond.
Senator Diamond no Senator
Gonzalez yes Senator Gonzales
yes Senator Hemphill.
Yes.
Senator Padilla yes Senator
Padilla yes Senator share.
Senator sure no Senator
Steinborn.
No.
Senator Steinborn no Senator
Woods.
Senator would know Senator
Rodriguez yes Senator Rodriguez
yes and senator Munoz.
I know.
Thank you no and Senator
Hemphill.
Senator Hemphill no you have
seven no and for yes this is
not.
We're back on the amendment.
Thank you Mr chair.
I want to ask about the trigger
on page thirty.
Well we have a trigger but I'm
disappointed that we ended the
fiscal year.
Thirty to twenty thirty I mean I
think the thing about a trigger
is.
You know
Well anyway I'm hoping to hear
from wrong but what we want to
when we want to get rid of that
all together since we're talking
about.
A reduction in taxes would we
want to have that figure go on
in perpetuity forever.
Welcome here and.
Secretary Schardin Clarke today
that these kind of fiscal
perspective on that.
Like in the case of the.
They miss Richardson tax cuts
for example.
You know that trigger scenario
just theoretically since since
like that that's the kind of
thing that that debate the
wisdom of that didn't end in
five years after we pass that so
then I think we had if we had
years years or we had flat
economic activity it could
happen because now we're on and
we're honest historic high
that's an anomaly really like
yeah we've got high growth but
it hi.
Because it's because of
commodity prices really it's
it's unnaturally.
So you should almost like
expected falloff.
What we're saying that we're
going to reduce taxes because
times are good five years from
now is to say the the the county
market changes drastically and
oil.
We're now now the those taxes
don't adjust I think learning
from the past you would want to
get rid of that twenty thirty.
Time frame that's really what
I'm speculating here that we
should take out that line on in
prior fiscal year twenty three
so we would just leave it after
fiscal year twenty twenty five
and then get rid of the alright
about prior to twenty three
otherwise to trigger only last
for a few years and I don't
think that's appropriate.
Welcome any debate on that.
Etcetera I think the triggers
are in place in case of the
revenues don't score correctly
and then we we've been told that
we're going to do a full tax for
next year and we don't want to
bind future legislatures to a
certain point.
is anything you could use a hold
harmless or the food tax rate
for bound for ever and and we're
never gonna get that back and so
are our solution to doing that
is is putting recruiters and
sets for the bills all along
those lines.
The Mr chairman this this would
sunset the trigger and twenty
twenty thirty.
Seven years center.
This year correct.
That was in your Representative
that was in your bill correct.
That's it Mr chair we did have a
sunset on our bill.
That's it on the trigger.
Mr chair Senator yes okay this
new language in this ammendment.
So I don't I would like to hear
from from David Ensor questions
about David secretary Schardin
Clarke about the wisdom of
having a longer trigger than
just sunsetting at twenty
thirty.
Mr chair Senator I if I can
start I guess
you know I want to emphasize
that businesses are looking for
certainty and I tax policy and I
do understand the
The reasons for having the
trigger but I I would advise
against having it from
indefinite period time just
because of the uncertainty you
know I also want to put out
there is the obvious that
nothing ever will tie the
legislature's hands from dealing
with revenue shortfall whether
it be increasing the G. R. T. or
you know any other number of
actions legislature might take
to balance the budget.
Chairman Sir we would both the
comments of the chair of the
secretary the more the you don't
mind featured you can't really
buy future legislatures in the
more flexibility you have as
appropriators will serve you
better.
This and we're not I just won
close not with the fund USA
supported welcome love to hear
your thoughts to.
No I mean go ahead Sir I just
want to say this true
legislators always have that
prerogative but the but the
politics and the reality of
raising taxes during tough times
is is a different scenario and
so what we saw last ministration
is when the economy tanked you
know that was that was a dogma
of no we won't do any revenue
increases so we were literally
cutting higher education we were
you know we were doing lots of
painful things so and we had
wished we would have some of
those things in place so.
The that's my response the
legislature's have for active
not this is a I think we're
back.
Motion for the amendment.
Then a second.
The motion on the amendment.
A second.
The second from Senator Woods we
call the roll.

your fifth.
you Madam chairwoman.
I don't like doing stuff like
this I I I don't think it's fair
to anybody I don't think it's
fair to you as a sponsor I don't
think it's fair to say means all
us
this is not the way we should be
doing tax policy in New Mexico
is waiting at the last minute
it's it's not in the best
interest of anybody.
but I am I will promise you I'm
not going to do this again tax
policies are going to have to
have a time frame to them cross
over into the policy to be set
we get in this I've seen it
fourteen years I've been in here
and Tax Policy comes down to the
last hours in and it's just not
what we should be doing it's not
correct
just don't think we should do
tax policy this way anymore and
can we just we get forced into
things that we should not be
done in that way so Mr chair
with respect we create the
situations for self.
I agree.
Thank you.
Thank you Representative.
Call us back down to the floor.
Yeah.
Coming back.
