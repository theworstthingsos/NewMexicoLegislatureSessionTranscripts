The tribal provisions that are
in this bill will have
True benefits to these
communities especially these
homes
again our communities are we we
are over burdened.
Our communities are over
polluted.
And the indoor air quality in
these homes is something that is
it does not really get taking
care of when we talk about
Fixing the home and through this
bill there's going to be you
know lasting impact.
For communities
that I work in for my relatives
and for that I ask for for this
committee to pass this.
Anybody else in support anybody
else in.
Junction I'll I'll try to go to
zoom again just to try to get
some other people.
Steve Casey are you there.
Yes right Steve.
Mr chair members of the
committee of good afternoon my
name is Casey then Senator
assistance programs Mexico gas
company.
New Mexico gas company supports
hospital three seven as
currently proposed and just
focus on energy efficiency and
affordability for low income
households Mexico has already
significant portion of its
energy efficiency portfolio
budget to income qualify
programs including its native
American energy assistance
program.
Next
is qualified energy assistance
program would supplemental
pension projects envisioned by
supporters and help reduce the
energy for the underserved
neighborhoods and tribal
communities The New Mexico
Gascons.
Thank you comedia of people men
are you there.
I am thank you so much Mr chair
members of the committee.
Supports this legislation thank
you so much.
Thank you any other comments
we're going to members of the
committee questions.
Chairman of governor which.
Chairman.
Thank understand.
This bill.
But I may have to ask a couple
of questions.
To get the full understanding.
So we are going to implement.
Are they grant program.
To implement energy efficiency
measures and low income.
Us how so.
So we are going to.
from that I understand we're
going to pay.
For energy of.
Well I guess gas a gas company
came on and was in favor of it
so we going to pay the utility
costs for low income.
How so it is that this recession
we what we're talking about here
we're going to pay the the
heating gas utility bill.
Mr chair Senator we we're not
going to pay for utility bills.
What this program does is it
allows a local government or
tried to identify a partner in
the community and together they
identified low income households
that can benefit from energy
efficiency products
and we're and then we implement
those we put those in the homes
and they will see a reduction in
their energy burden and their
utility costs because they've
gone from you know a
a poorly performing
water heater to something that's
energy efficient.
This Mr chair they're going to I
appliances.
Mr stern people Mr chair and
Senator.
Well.
The way it works is you do you
the the part the community
partners will
figure out what makes sense in
that neighborhood it's in my
neighborhood by neighborhood it
might make sense to put in
windows it might make sense to
put in heat pumps it might
Mexico makes sense to do
insulation and so they'll figure
out what makes sense for that
community based on where you are
geographically and then you put
an application in the EMNRD.
And I'm happy for my through it
just to pop in here.
Chairman Senator Woods that's
correct so that grants can be
used for whatever is needed and
that community to improve the
housing stock of the low income
high energy burdens residents
and so that can be any any
combination of measures that
reduces energy use therefore
reducing energy Burt.
How does Mr chair had is is
different from the
weatherization Act.
Senator Rodriguez talked about
in a bit earlier bill Mr chair
Senator that's a great question
they complement each other the
weather is ation program at
mortgage finance authorities as
federal funds and there's it's
it's typically whole house
weather is ation of this this
grant program allows for MFA to
even apply to do some more
targeted energy efficiency
projects so you know you can do
whole house weatherization in
addition to very specific things
as of late the actually the
target each other they they work
with each other to make sure
that that communities have can
reduce their their energy
burden.
One where we double funding this
Mr.
Mr chair Senator Woods so a very
conservative estimate on the
need for low income energy
efficiency provisions in New
Mexico is five hundred million
dollars and so the NMFA's
program is a wonderful program
and it serves lots of people
every year but it's certainly
not reaching everyone and so the
goal here is to to provide an
additional program that can
reach even more people so that
we can help more people living
in poverty to reduce their
energy for.
We've we've in the current bill
that we passed there's a huge
amount of money.
To help these people so.
More.
Okay where you get money for
this program Mr chair.
Mr chair and senator there is
currently money in the budget
on the house side and we there
are things that are happening
right now but there's currently
I believe ten million dollars.
For energy efficiency programs
this is above Senator Rodriguez
is money Mr chair Senator yes.
What is the expected need.
We we we so we've got.
Ten million dollars what is
expected need.
Mr chair Senator you know I
think the estimates are are very
high we know we there are many
people in New Mexico who need
this kind of service as my
expert witness Tammy just
mentions you notice I think if
we had a five hundred million
dollars we would we would be
able to make low income homes
energy efficient but we we want
to we want to get started now.
So this is a a great program
would is going to give them how
do we get around that that
nation this grant program Mr
that's an excellent question so
this legislation was drafted in
in accordance with the
affordable housing act on in
mind drafted with the anti
donation clause in mind this
program will allow for the
integration clause allows for
improvements in infrastructure
to affordable housing and this
is what this is we're improving
affordable affordable housing
stock through energy efficiency
infrastructure projects.
So this is a project for a a low
income house that a low income
person on each.
Mr chair and senator they can
own or they can rent and with
the way it works is that the
local government or the
political subdivisions applies
for that grant working with the
costs of community partners and
the identify the people in the
homes that qualify so a person a
low income person doesn't apply
directly but they there you know
they they work with the local
government.
Okay so you you're talking about
a landlord.
Rich's property up to a low
income person that low income
person is the one that applies
for this grant.
Mr chair Senator Woods so again
the the low income residents
would not be applying for these
funds this is a proposal that
comes from a local government
entities with either city county
tribal unit that would put
together would look at their
community and say okay we have
this you know one block area of
our most impoverished citizens
who have a really high energy
burden and we want to provide
services to them and so that
application that request would
come from the local government
to this fund and then it would
be determined which which ones
are funded through the energy
conservation management division
at energy and minerals so so
much share the the local
government would own a house in.
Mr chair Senator no they
wouldn't.
So there's a there's no hotel
out there.
That's owned by someone.
And local government decides
that's a great place to house
low income people.
Then that owner.
The the local government can to
go tell that owner.
We will re have your property
for you.
What what are the conditions
what are the what are the Mr
chair what are the conditions
for that scenario Mr chair
Senator Woods so the bill lays
out how energy and minerals
would have to look at these
proposals to determine which
ones to fund and it includes
things like what is the overall
energy burden reduction for live
people living in poverty what
kind of jobs that create in the
local community all of those
measures would be considered
when they're deciding who to
apply or who to to give the
funds to so in the example that
you gave could possibly be in in
a proposal but you know you have
to show that you're going to and
it's not it's not full retrofit
so they're not gonna be able to
re have an entire property for
someone it's really going into a
block grant area and saying we
you know we have a couple of
homes or even a hotel that you
mentioned that needs better
insulation so it's going to be
targeted energy efficiency
improvements it's not a full
retrofit program like like the
mortgage finance authority.
So how much how much your how
much dollar value for.
local community are you going to
give out Mr chair.
Mr chair Senator
that hasn't been determined yet
we know that we have a certain
amount of money in the fund
right will we we hope to have a
certain amount of money in the
fund and you know as EMNRD goes
through its rule making you they
they may make that determination
but I I don't know if they will
or not so that it's not there's
nothing in the bill that sets
limits minimums or maximums
As far as I know Mr chair
Senator so the concept is.
That we go out and help.
For full.
That's the concept in the rules
are to be rid.
Mr chair Senator that means
there are did the concept is
absolute to health help low
income New Mexicans thank you Mr
president I Mr.
Raise I gave you right here we
shouldn't call me madam
president.
Any other questions etcetera
share.
This thank you madam president.
So.
Of the somewhere along that same
line.
So I know it's the to help the.
Low income persons living
somewhere.
It is certainly.
There are plenty of duplexes are
for plexus or whatever besides
hotels the people actually live
in today they're not we're not
housing people there there they
voluntarily live there because
of keep enough to live there.
The qualify under whatever
criteria we have.
One of those criteria though I'm
looking at this.
Kind of kind of scares me so if
you have a family of four
underneath this or underneath in
this bill.
A family of four.
Can get this assistance if they
make fifty three thousand
dollars a year.
Fifty three thousand dollars is
not particularly low income in
New Mexico that's higher than
average income in New Mexico.
So whether the living in their
own house or renting a duplex.
Fifty three thousand dollars is
not low.
Why did we draw the line there.
Miss Mr chair Senator visit the
two hundred percent of federal
poverty level is what these
types of programs in general go
for we're trying to make this
consistent with things like the
MFA weatherization program and
the utility energy efficiency
programs and so you know it's
fifty three thousand dollars if
you have a family of four it's
much less if you have less
people in your home and you know
these are the levels that we
we've seen in the community that
they still need assistance at
that level.
Mr chair and.
Then Senator idea of.
I can see where people may need
help with but the federal
poverty in New York City is
dramatically different than
here.
In New York City you're poor it
eighty thousand dollars.
Informing to New Mexico you are
rich at eighty thousand dollars.
Some of the best jobs in the New
Mexico or the power plant in the
coal mines.
And they started eighty thought
well they started seventy eight
thousand dollars but they start
pretty close to eighty.
They're not poor.
In I think Mr chair that we get
ourselves worked up over
poverty.
But.
But if you go to rural in New
Mexico if you're making eighty
thousand dollars in rural here
the richest guy in the whole
county.
In Europe for.
So.
Where we draw this line does it
seem to make a lot of sense to
me.
In fact my very first year here
we were talking about the same
thing at the time I had two
children living at home so I was
a family of four.
At the time that number was
forty six thousand or whatever
it was.
And it freaked me out because of
state senator.
Sitting in this room.
Was poor because I didn't pay
myself the rate myself forty
five thousand dollars.
For.
I had a nice house a nice car
had a mild business wasn't point
forty five thousand dollars but
this number said I was poor
folks under forty six.
So instead of a qualifying for
any of these things I went home
again agency operates the forty
seven seventy point will.
I think the whole number system
that we use I'll be tested for
region.
That's the first part of this so
I could I could have owned a
house.
The clerk to call.
The business and qualified for
the state to come in and put new
windows in my house.
That does not feel right.
Not at all.
Instead of me taking advantage
of that though I gave myself
a resorting qualify anymore.
But I can see people.
You can take advantage of this.
At other peoples other taxpayers
expense.
Some other taxpayer.
Is going to pay for my windows.
And that doesn't feel.
We're going to pay for my water
heater and that doesn't feel I
just replaced one.
Okay hundred fifty dollars and I
did the work myself on the water
heater.
But I would.
I could have qualified to have
somebody else by my water
heater.
In.
Pay somebody to put it in except
for you know is that we put it
in.
Mr chair these things just
really concern me.
Because.
Poverty is not a fixed across
the nation.
It's not even fixed across the
state of New Mexico.
Drawing this line I think is
problematic.
But the other thing you said was
so the city council or whatever
could say all this neighborhood
is impoverished this
neighborhood needs help.
What if I'm a landlord in that
neighborhood so I own a duplex
or four plex or whatever it is.
So I go to the city council then
this is a terrible neighborhood
it's impossible it's ugly and
they took off on that.
I'm the landlord.
And I try really hard to only
pay myself fifty two thousand
nine hundred ninety nine dollars
a year but the people that live
in that in that for plaques are
clearly making something less
than that.
Why is the landlord get to
replace the windows.
For the for the person that's
making something look.
In just their apartment.
Mr chair Senator the way it
works is that that city that the
city government will work with
the community partners to
identify those homes it those
affordable housing units
for low income families and it
could be that they're living in
that four plex.
If they qualify there two ways
to qualify you're living in an
affordable housing units or you
meet the income threshold that
MFA also uses for its weather is
ation programs at two hundred
percent poverty level that's how
you qualify to be part of this
block grant so it's not just you
know house by house it's really
you know it's really
neighborhood by neighborhood.
So Mister chair I get that.
There are entire.
Not just blocks but.
Sections of Farmington that have
ancient steel and single pane
glass windows.
Many of them are in fact
duplexes many of them are single
family homes.
And the people living in them do
not think there point forty
thousand dollars forty five
thousand dollars.
But again if I with the landlord
of a duplex that had those
windows.
The people living in that
particular.
Whatever you probably all four
of them if it's a four plex
following that same income
category.
In because it's in an entire
neighborhood that has that
because all these neighborhoods
were built in nineteen fifty
nine nineteen to nineteen sixty
two.
So everybody that owns a house
in that neighborhood.
Whether to the whether they own
that house or not or the renter
and health or not and I'm the
landlord.
We can get windows put into
every house in that
neighborhood.
When nobody in that neighborhood
views of self this poor.
View themselves as poor.
But they make less than fifty
three thousand dollars.
We would work.
Mr chair Senator yes this bill
was written to be open to both
renters and owners because we
truly believe that you should
have to own a home to have a
home that is efficient and that
you are not having a draft and
it's not a public health hazard
and so we want everyone to have
a basic minimum standard of
living in New Mexico and these
been prove Mentzer not the
improvements that are going to
necessarily improve the value of
the home these are not you know
fancy new floors and things like
that these are things like
insulation just to make sure
that the people living there can
number one be there safely not
have drafts not have indoor air
quality problems and number two
that they can reduce their
energy burden we do have parts
of of rural New Mexico where
people are experiencing energy
burdens of up to thirty seven
percent and so regardless of of
whether we believe that that
that if you're in this two
hundred percent of poverty
what do you believe that that's
that low income person if you're
spending thirty seven percent of
your income on utility bills it
does affect them and I do
believe that we should be
providing them some assistance.
Mr chair I think I want to
support this because I am a
landlord I think the other
citizens of New Mexico should
pay for the windows in my new
property.
Might be a great deal.
I have to disclose the.
I think it's a great deal for
anybody that's a landlord.
I actually have put new windows
in houses I wish I'd seen this
first I believe to put the
windows in my new house.
They can be expensive that went
over there is probably an
eighteen hundred dollar window.
Then I did it because I thought
it was the right thing to do
because you know in some cases
it really sucks as a kid it
really sucked mmhm when the
window in my bedroom you know
was felt like it was open all
winter long it was closed.
I understand that I I get the
idea.
Mr fragrance scent devising the
wrong folks.
What we're really doing is
incentivizing the property
owner.
Who very well may not be the
person living there.
In in a and and I guess my basic
problem Mr chair.
Is.
So now other taxpayers.
I'm gonna pay for the windows in
the property I don't.
To all of those folks want to
pay for the windows in the
property I'll.
I guess if I ask them
individually they would save
health they don't want to pay
for those women for my windows.
In the big picture a whole yes
everybody needs.
When I look great if somebody
said you want to pay for my
windows.
They would say no you make
enough money to pay for your own
windows.
We want you to have good
windows.
To pay for your own.
It's the same with the water
heater it seems that the
insulation in the ceiling.
We get mostly houses built.
In in in the in various
neighborhoods across New Mexico
that were built in the.
In the very late fifties fifty
nine through the sixties and
even into the seventies I don't
have a lot of insulation up
there.
So.
It is something that I think
every house on to do.
I think it makes a huge
difference.
The question is do we need.
On related taxpayers.
Paying for that.
It fifty three thousand dollars
for family for.
The with their own installation
at.
It's not that hard.
So so I am concerned about that
but I'm also concerned that you
have to have tax returns to show
show this how we gonna protect
that tax information if I give
it to somebody.
So so I have tax return that I
show to everybody to hear it is
present no public record.
Thank you Mr Mr chair Senator
the way this is written is that
you have to certify in some way
that the people that you are
applying for the the government
that is putting in application
must certify that the people
that they are applying for our
lowincome are either living in
affordable housing and the the
method of that certification is
left to the rulemaking and
energy and minerals and so
there's no requirement that
tax returns would be used but
there has to be some sort of of
certification from the local
government are the tribal entity
to energy and minerals that the
people that are in their program
our lowincome are living in
affordable housing units.
Nearly everybody in Farmington
lowincome by this group.
We can just say.
Farmington is lowincome
everybody gets a free window
from the taxpayers in
Albuquerque or Santa Fe the
Santa fe's rich can.
I just don't know how Mr
chairman we could.
We can.
Look at this it and make it make
sense to me.
I can certainly see in my own
mind.
There's this lady she's been
living in this house since
nineteen fifty nine.
With the same windows the same
more insulation in the in the it
is in the ceiling.
This water heater.
Which is probably really
inefficient at this point.
In her income really is low
because she's living on social
security.
Of that her now deceased
husband.
Of earned because she never had
a job.
And he's been dead for fifteen
years or more.
Is she can't afford windows and
she can't afford the insulation
and she can't afford the water
heater.
I can I can see helping her.
In fact again.
I have put insulation in
people's houses for free.
Because I can.
But I can also see saying okay
this is a good thing for New
Mexico we're going to cut down
her her
energy bills a lot it is going
to be more comfortable.
But I can't see is helping
people.
That are really poor.
To put insulation in the house.
It's not very expensive if it's
just in the city.
I
understand why they can't do it
themselves.
Can't pay for themselves.
The eighty five year old and I
want to do it herself that's why
she would ask me to do it not
climb up there and I put it in.
But that's that's my main
problem with this thing is I
believe this is a tax break.
For the landlords.
We're certainly making more than
fifty three thousand dollars.
Because they're providing
housing for somebody that's
making less than fifty three
thousand dollars.
It's the landlord the gets the
advantage.
It after work and I is the
landlord replace all the windows
replace all the insulation.
With that family moves out.
I increase the rent of the new
family moves in and I make more
money thank you so this is a
fact of Santa Fe.
It doesn't seem fair to me.
To anyone.
So how do we focus it actually
help people in need help not the
landlord it in this case I'm
serious I am the landlord really
truly.
But I'm also the guy that helps
neighbors for nothing.
Fifty three thousand dollars.
Citizens of Santa Fe you're
gonna replace all my windows.
And that just isn't right.
I should replace my own windows.
Thank you Mr thank you center
Rodriguez now thank you thank
you Mr chairman good afternoon
thank you Representative Ortez
and also your witness here thank
you for Senator Stewart who was
here and had to leave let me
just tell you every saved
enormous amount of phone calls
on this matter all of the
support I have received one
against it and I can see why do
the block grants community
development block grants are
exactly that there for community
development and so you know when
you try to to hear market
certain place there after you've
looked at it and know that the
certain area needs to be
rehabilitated or or have more
energy efficiency they have old
systems very as best as for
example that doesn't even take
care of the situation in a home
or building needs to be removed
and someone it's difficult to
find grant money for that that
doesn't have the ties in the
inhibitions so a block grant
like this really helps to be
able to renovate and having more
energy efficiency so Mister
chairman I I'm in full support
of this I have no problems with
that and I commend the sponsors
for bring in this fourth
Gemini Senator Steinborn the.
Thank you Mr chairman and I'm so
glad the bills being put on I I
really I'm proud to be a co
sponsor you know to Senator
share thank you senator.
Yeah.
Anyway.
I would love to hear this point
but but make another point first
which is that this bill.
Has a real economic stimulative
value that I think can be lost
on people this bill has a really
economic similar value they can
be lost on some people if
they're just looking at the
first.
You know the first step of the
process of giving someone some
assistance
I was really struck by all the
analysis about how much people
spend on energy as a percentage
when you're lower income.
You know and how can you put
money into the economy how can
you support small businesses how
can you do much of anything if
all your money's going energy so
when you help people lower their
energy costs by increasing
efficiency you're actually
stimulating the economy.
So that's one thing to keep in
mind about this bill it's the
same reason why I think
really aggressively deploying
solar panels also helped people
lower their energy costs and you
put more money back in the
county Senator share something
really investment Farmington is
it Farmington has a municipal
utility.
The government owned utility in
Farmington has lower energy
bills because of that which I
was like these.
I would like to use it is right
but you know it's just a
different model and so.
choose to make a point when you
have a publicly owned utility
your incentive is not to build
more infrastructure and more
power plants that you then have
to capture that revenue back to
pay for your incentives to build
less you know to contain energy
costs of and when are you asking
questions I'm gonna make a
really important point thank you
Mr chairman so there's a concept
called demand side management
which is it which is that you
you actually spend money on
energy efficiency so that you
control the growth of
infrastructure and that's the
reason why this will be really
good for Farmington is because
the more energy efficiency the
less it low there is on the
system and the more you keep
rates low that's what I want to
make Mr chairman but this is a
really tremendous Bill
compliment you on it and and
it'll be a really positive thing
for New Mexico so thank you Mr.
Thank you.
The question.
You have one and it's it's kind
of puzzling I mean this kind of
puzzling throughout this because
if your contractor and or
anybody but
In page eight.
nine six it goes in that section
and it talks that the
the revised her partner template
apprentice from a registered
apprenticeship program that
promotes diversity or to find
paid internships to person
targeted and underserved
community.
I don't know how many
apprenticeships there are for
for weatherization window
replacement I mean there's no
license that says that you're a.
Owners have to do with
legislation.
Are you in order to be electors
I forget what you have to you
have to do so much electrical
work for so many years and then
your plan to get your license I
can't think of the word but but
there's no programs that doesn't
mean.
so people have to do this and
you want to traineeship
programme.
I don't know we're gonna find
that.
Mr chair students the point of
this inclusion in the bill is
that we want to grow jobs in the
community where these projects
are going to happen and so the
ability to look over on page
twelve it it becomes clear this
is how you're going to select
which projects are funded and it
says that in that application
you just have to say yes you
were going to have a paid
apprenticeship program or a paid
internship from people living in
the community it's not a
requirement but if that is an
option for your project we want
to highlight that and have it
considered wind energy and
minerals is deciding who to give
the projects to.
And so but.
They're gonna have to choose one
or the other so if if and I'll
use Gallup Catholic charities
contracts with someone else's
okay we have these five houses
scattered Gallup the reservation
where we are putting and we want
somebody to go out and do these
and here's a dollar not here's
what's going to do then they
either have to have an
apprentice with them.
For rate.
But I mean the bill says that
that Mr chair.
Reversing sorry Mr chair on page
eight line six it says in the
application that you want to set
forth any commitment it doesn't
say that you have to have a
commitment for that it just says
that if you are going to use one
of those two things whether it's
an apprenticeship program are
paid internship that you have to
say so in your application and
then that is considered by
energy and minerals when they're
determining who to give the
funds to but it is not a
requirement.
And Representative but by the
NMFA oversees the program.
Mr chair at at NMFA does not
oversee the program EMNRD is
overseeing the grant program.
The grant program but the
funding is going to NMFA.
Is.
Mr chair it is going to EMNRD.
And then maybe I'm an attorney
and I don't need we describe it
and page for Friday.
Fund is created and methane.
Sure sure sure beat or the
secretary of finance and NMFA's
is.
Mr chair on page fourteen
starting at line I it talks
about the community energy
efficiency development block
grant being created is a non
reverting fund in the state
treasury and it goes to energy
and minerals MFA is an applicant
if they can apply for these
grants if they want to do some
of these targeted energy
efficiency development block
grant activities but the fund
will be set up in energy
minerals and that's defined up
in the in the definition section
where it talks about who's the
Department in the division and
that's on page two.
Line seventeen through twenty.
Well I understand the concept
and get it I think you made a
very technical and people are
going to be able to the only
ones gonna be able to do it is
on the road the bill and so
people are going to be
committees are to be able to
understand why they apply and
and what their how they apply
because I'm confused I'm a
contractor.
So I'm I'm confused so much.
I don't know how you gonna get
out that's that's we want to do
is is people mean to to fix
leaks to fix their their issues
to energy savings and I think
you made a very technical and
how that's gonna happen
Representative have Mr chair
thank thank you for that and I
think at I think it's important
to note here that when should
this bill pass that EMNRD will
be making you will be engaging
in that rulemaking and I think
that gives us another
opportunity to make things clear
we we reference Newmarket New
Mexico mortgage finance
authority through this in terms
of eligibility some eligibility
criteria because they're also
allowed to apply for funds to to
complement their own weather is
ation program.
Confusing to me what's pleasure
the committee.
Was senator shares looking at
that.
We want to move a motion for
amendment for discussion
purposes.
A motion by Senator Gonzales
second by Senator Woods.
So this year this is really.
Of.
First of all.
For more in this list for.
So that brings it down.
Still.
Average.
Mexico City of.
Your.
There's no way to get the
current.
This is.
On the New Mexico.
Tax.
Yes.
That is a personal income tax.
Mexico.
so we said we don't have taxed
for.
Representative
says I have.
Is a.
Tax returns to the office.
On the on.
Close C..
So this strikes also that.
The two.
Two of.
Less than thirty percent.
The.
Mexico
City take up half the for
information still on.
Less than two thousand dollars.
This is really language.
Where is the.
Looking.
The.
Representative comments on the
minute.
Mr chair
having had a few minutes to look
at this you know these
amendments really go to reduce
eligibility in the program and
so for example saying that it
would be you anyone with a rent
or mortgage payment of less than
thirty percent of the federal
poverty level for a family of
three seems suspect on a couple
of of fronts
The idea that thirty percent
payment for rent or mortgage is
an acceptable allowance but
there are many many people
living in this state that are
paying much more than that and
they would be excluded from this
program because they don't have
a lower rent or lower the lower
mortgage payment and that seems
unfair I'd also say that you
know including the family of
three in here means that people
with the family of seven for
example I can't imagine that
they would have what does that
mean about a five hundred dollar
mortgage payment I can't imagine
that a family of seven can live
in a house that small so it
really these two seem to be
restricting eligibility and in a
very unfair way for lowincome
New Mexicans and so
We we.
And I and there's also some
inconsistency and seeing that
there's a family of three listed
on number two but a number six
it's it's refers to family of
two
You all and I'll just a way to
reduce eligibility and again
these programs are designed so
that the local governments can
look into their community see
where the most energy burdened
people live and the most low
income people and and help them
and so restricting this
eligibility is counter to the
purpose of the bill.
Committee members on the
amendment.
For non much pressure the
committee and then to.
Can I.
So if we look at the amendment
item number two on page two
strike lines of five through
eight.
So I threw eight says affordable
housing means housing primarily
for low income persons including
housing for the currently
occupied by low income persons.
It is affordable to low income
persons based on assessed value
rent for estimated mortgage.
We struck that that's the first
piece so what we would replace
that with.
Is of the four wheel housing
means residential housing with a
rent or mortgage payment less
than thirty percent of the
federal poverty level.
For a family of three so.
I think what we're trying we we
are trying to to find out more.
but I don't think that it's
cutting out.
It's not cutting out low income
people it's focusing on low
income people.
I think what we're trying to get
to what we say we want to get
to.
And I think that's important the
next thing down on the number
six on page four which is what I
was trying to find for.
We're gonna strike through a
lines three through six one
three two three three through
six eight the median adjusted
gross income which is a New
Mexico personal income tax form.
Verbiage I mean that's that's
the funding K. as defined in in
the in the code.
We're gonna change it to medium
household income as reported in
the most recent American
Community Survey.
So we're going to take a survey
of that area not.
Senator shares income tax form.
So if that's where I live then
we will assume that not based on
my personal income tax form
which really scares me that that
that comes out there in the
world.
So again Mr Mr chair.
I believe this ammendment.
It focuses on what we say we
want to do as opposed to
eliminating people.
Because again.
Why should the citizens of
Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
They for the windows in my
house.
We should.
I should pay for the windows in
my house.
And that's all this is really
about mistress Mr madam
president.
Madam press.
He left.
Mr chair.
So so that's where that that's
that's what this amendment
trying to focus on the people
that.
That needed and keep the
personal income tax thing from
being a public document.
Have a motion to table the
amendment.
Have a second.
I was gonna debate but if he's
that's an individual motions.
The second.
By Senator Padilla we call the
roll.
Senator Steinborn made the
motion to table second by
Senator Padilla on them were on
the amendment.
Hello.
Senator.
Senator no Senator Campos yes
Campos yes Senator Diamond
Senator Diamond no Senator
Gonzales.
Senator Gonzales yes Senator
Hemphill.
Senator Hemphill yes Senator
Padilla yes Senator Padilla yes
Senator share.
No Senator share now Senator
Steinborn
Senator Steinborn yes Senator
Woods.
Senator Woods no Senator
Rodriguez.
Thank you.
Yes.
Seven yes and or not.
Amendments tabled.
We're back on the bill Senator
sure does make some good points
about personal income tax
returns I mean nobody wants
their returns out there public
whether there thank you thank
god I haven't applied for
something
you should be able to find some
type of fix because if an
agency.
A lot of requests to communities
thank you Mr tax returns I don't
think there's any security in in
me giving a tax return to
somebody said a look.
You know that guy over there may
only makes twenty seven thousand
years and and gets out.
I I suggest we figure that out
for the floor Mr chair if I may
so the on page four of the bill
it says that you have to either
say that the people living in in
the area that you're going to
help are at two and percent of
federal poverty level and that
can be proven lots of ways
instead of going through tax
credit or tax report
if they qualify for the state
weather station program with
their qualifying for utility
programs there are a lot of
things that require the same
level which is what we had a
consistent with other programs
or if they live in a hundred and
a high energy burden area which
we have statewide mapping for
that or they have limited access
to energy efficiency services so
there is no intent of using tax
forms for this program for
certification in any way shape
or form.
I have somebody doesn't qualify
for those and they say I want to
use my tax return no walk in the
state I want to get my the door
fixed and here's my tax return
and they qualify.
Then work who holds a tax return
course ago has a document in
that process and who holds that.
Mr chair so again the local
government and the community
partner would choose the area
that is receiving the the
projects and they would certify
so if whatever process that
local government one to certify
they would just been certified
energy minerals that they have
proven that those folks qualify
there would be no transference
of any personal documentation to
energy and minerals in for any
of these programs.
At the local government and
whatever that community agency
that's doing it would have to
look at that tax return and then
say okay look at it they got
have some verification.
Because of so many questions
someone and says well I saw
forward a copy of it the state
alone that your cousin he may
very well be in need and they
say okay we will shows the tax
returns show the state you got
a.
I just.
A little bit question one I
mean.
Even down from the one is tax
traditionally.
So and and and it's different
for people in poverty because
they.
You know when they ask first
supporter health or things in
need it's kind of humbling in
in I just think you need to
tighten up that privacy.
As you go before you may look
for an amendment or something
just to tighten up that privacy
portion of their tax return
otherwise you may be on the
floor for a long time talking
about this
And so I think that's something
you need to get done with the
amendment for the floor
so we can tighten up that
privacy on the tax return.
We're back on the bill.
We have a motion and a motion
for.
We have a motion for to pass a
motion for two passed by Senator
Gonzales second by Senator
Hemphill.
That we call the roll.
So Senator Senator Campos yes
Yes Senator.
Senator Hemphill yes Senator
Padilla yes Senator Padilla yes
senator here no one explain my
vote.

Steinborn.
Senator Steinborn yes Senator
Woods.

Lots of our fair share.
Mr chair I just want to thank

that I've that I'm now going to
buy.
Thank you.
Welcome center share.
You can consider me a
progressive not.
Senator Rodriguez going to have

Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee I have
if the whole here with me who is
my my experts.
We depend on someone to thank
you and that Mr chairman this
I'm gonna start off immediately
getting to the point only for
the sake of time that
I'm gonna move a do not pass on
Senate bill two twelve which is
the capital bill and move for
discussion of Senate finance
committee substitute for Senate
bill to twelfth immediately so
we can start off with that.
And that Mr chairman the the
substitute bill that we're
working with and the charts
listing the projects have been
handed out for review by the
members.
And this is for all your
projects are and in statewide
and someone Senate finance
committee substitute for the
Senate bill twelve with the
emergency clause is the capital
outlay bill for projects
statewide as I sent the bill
authorizes or appropriates eight
hundred and twenty seven point
seven million from the following
funds.
Six hundred eighty one point one
million of severance tax bonds
thirty million from the general
fund and one hundred and sixteen
point six million from other
state funds.
Funded in the bill includes
approximately four hundred and
seven point three million for
state agencies schools and
judicial projects three hundred
and ninety point four million
for projects identified by the
governor in the house and the
Senate members to address local
and regional projects statewide
in thirty million for tribal
projects statewide that's what
it does Mr chairman and have
landed here with me with more
details.
Thank you senator Munoz members
I have nothing to add on this
you have questions.
Thank you anybody and soon.
Anybody in the audience and
support I can tell there's may
not be support but they're here
to see what they got.
Anybody in objection.
Questions from committee
members.
There's time more.
Thank you Mr
Senator Miskito the question I
asked the same question I asked
on the other bill the.
The need of on the land the
severance tax bond projects when
will those bonds to be sold in
the funding be available to the
agencies that are recipients of
this Senator Mignon on Senator
Steinborn
The of bonds are generally
issued around may or June and
then monies available right
after okay and it does take time
for the state agencies to get
grant agreements in place to the
entities that are in this bill.
Thank you for that
He of.
Chairman is there a situation Mr
chair just came over the funds
are unsuccessfully so.
Yes when they're severance tax
bonds is a requirement that the
entity has to certify readiness.
And if they're not ready on then
and and there is in the preamble
of the bill a time limitation
that they have for readiness and
so those bonds to be held out
from sale until they do receive
a certificate of reading this
and then they'll have to wait
for another sale in December.
So they have to get ready for
that to the seller may so
hello with state agencies Mr
Chairman the ski hill with state
agencies to date are they ever
to later is that more like for
local government projects where
the delay may occur initial loss
Mister chairman Senator
Steinborn it's generally local
projects that are delayed okay
very good thank you Mr chairman
thank you yes.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
madam vice chair and and live
thank you very much so I mean
I'm trying to get through this
as quickly as I possibly can
over here so are the governor's
projects in here as well the
statewide so they also in this
document thank you from my
attention to them with.
And
we're kind of pretty much every
around okay don't have a chart
that separates for projects with
the members and so Mr chairman
and madam vice chair so what
what did the governor's projects
come to you have like a figure
there and can you highlight
maybe the big three I'm just
curious what those wound up
being yes Sir on what what the
share was was the house hundred
thirty million the Senator
houses hundred thirty two
million the Senate hundred
thirty two million in the
governor's with a hundred and
thirty million that doesn't
count the state agency projects
that under her room governing.
So the figure the hundred thirty
two million for the for the
governor's office what were the
big three would you say that
wound up in here because outlook
forum but I just was curious you
know with a regional lies for
the what were they.
Mr Chairman just at a glance
because we we receded the charts
late is she did some regional
projects in so far as for water
wastewater.
and generally the the projects
that the governor funds are
larger projects right in the
dollar amounts you often put in.
So was there any additional Mr
chairman and madam vice chair
any additional transportation
dollars out of the governor's
funded fortune here.
There were there were a few of
them but that we're for tribal
entities under the thirty
million general fund that's in
this bill.
Mr Chairman is excited all of
this might be a question for you
but it's hard can you so we we
feel like we're gonna head you
know face worker or directly
into a what I'm being told is an
energy crisis this summer
can capital outlay dollars fee
utilized for projects that can
help in that area.
Senator eight if the agency
requests and then they probably
could but capital should be used
for always for infrastructure is
not for operating or.
Our purchase or anything like
that but if you wanna live power
line for Albuquerque to lay in.
Whatever it you can use that
could be a state media state
owned facilities because the
state bonds.
The if you're not issues might
chapters of engine power lines
ditions and bathroom addition.
In those necessary needs you get
to the to the chapters in the.
Thank you Mr chairman I just
asked because you know it's not
like we don't know we are
heading toward a massive it
sounds and if it's accurate
we're heading toward a massive
energy crisis this summer here
in New Mexico that used to be a
thing of California but when you
think about California you know
consuming a lot of the power
that's being put on the the
grids you know we're gonna do
this little customer over here
if you will come in comparison I
just wonder if anything wound
up.
On the statewide level in that
area because this is a huge you
know it's what we're careening
toward this boulder we can see
it there I want to make sure
that we're doing something in
that area I mean we each
received one point three million
and that's fantastic and I'm
grateful in my district is that
I think three point one at one
point you got point three we we.
About this is bill yeah.
I move to table those are the
three point one million but and
that's that's a lot of money
from my area but I mean just a
project like on on energy or
whatever or making sure that you
know that component is is is you
know is is moved in the right
direction just to be a lot of
money and so I'm just curious if
there was any large projects on
that that you were aware of and
anywhere in the document.
No Mr Chairman Senator Padilla
what I will attempt to do that
just the council to do this by
the time this bill goes on the
floor is that you get a break
down of the members.
Separating the house from the
Senate in the governor's and to
see and I can also probably do
break down by category Mr chair
is this online already not yet
as soon as we know the bill's
going to pass and we put a
fiscal impact report and the
chart on online we can easily do
some searching or so yes Sir I
don't want to ask you to do that
I know that you've been
incredibly busy thank you Mr
chairman thank you madam vice
chair I just really hope we
focus on energy going into the
summer because we know that
that's going to be with the big
problems thank you Senator
Padilla and I just want to touch
on this a little bit the prior
bill we heard.
There was an issue with energy
on the.
that we ran into is PNM did not
by their contract at the rate
that was on the open market and
so when they did the TA and said
you're gonna shut down the San
Juan power plant well PNM went
to the PRC and ask for an
earlier date and they agree to
it.
Well now there's no power and so
now we're hearing the chatter
about how do we fix that how do
we do that the rolling black
outs coming at you seen in the
paper all summer long they said
that but the basic problem is
if you had an opportunity to buy
power at a higher rate but the
ETA was supposed to bring power
at a lower rate which it has
accomplished that's going to be
a big question the governor has
the authority and executive
order to declare emergency and
may have the ability to
require power to get there she
may have to help get some help
from the president but we've
seen in other states all over
California pays fifty cents a
kilowatt so you may or may not
happen I hope it doesn't happen
but that was issue with the
prior bill where we.
Waiting and waiting and waiting
thank you Senator Padilla you're
done the any other questions.
It's also.
Yes.
Thank you senators also I I just
had some cleanup language I I
know that in the Jio's they put
some money for western New
Mexico for the Deming learning
center I see that again there's
a little bit of controversy
about land ownership and how
that is handled down there I
think that needs to be talked
about a U. N. M. I mean they
made out with what almost eighty
million dollars that I've seen
so hard to swallow to watch
other university die on the vine
and you just keep taking and
taking and taking well small
universities and community
colleges shriveling shrink
because somebody says that they
need the money more than LESC
and how successful UNM is I I
don't know
there's a whole lot in here.
And I've come to the personal
choice that I really don't like
capital.
It's one of the hardest things
that we do.
Because we has people and all
use me for an example I have
Representative three counties
thirteen chapters of village the
city.
And there's just not enough to
go around I mean people are
asking for bigger needs and
bigger requests and it's hard to
satisfy a large group like that
Senator Steinborn center for the
part for a little bit luckier of
the because they represent one
city or one County.
And in a lot of us and looking
across the table they may be the
only two in the room from that
representative one city and one
county.
And the rest of us are trying to
federal seat and and water on
there and get the grass to grow
but it starts to get green but
isn't ever succeed and that's a
real issue maybe in the sixty
day that we want to deal with
Senator Campos is taking this on
forever he Hey may have more
counties and anybody because
look at the riding high is.
On is for their they can still
not completely.
in and so becomes an issue of
how we resolved.
So we should really take a hard
look about capital.
We have two point five billion
correct me if I'm wrong then and
that's sitting there stagnant.
At least one point eight
billion.
One point eight billion that's
in their statement we know that
cost over runs are coming.
We know that projects going to
cost more than than what they
wore and some point we're gonna
have to clean up this list and
say let's figure this out
because I mean we can not
continue to do this this is for
me this is one of the worst
processes that we do and I see
everybody in the room shaking
their head that is just hard to
make everybody happy there's not
enough to go around and and
should change so.
That wanted to put us motion by.
Senator Gonzales second by
Senator Rodriguez correct.
Thank you.
Senator Burt.
Yes.
Senator Burt yes Senator Campos
yes Senator Campos yes Senator
Diamond yes Senator Diamond yes
Senator Gonzales yes Senator
Gonzales yes Senator Hemphill
yes Senator Hemphill yes Senator
Padilla yes yes Senator share
excuse Senator Steinborn.
Senator Steinborn yes Senator
Woods use Senator Woods yes
Senator Rodriguez yes Senator
Rodriguez yes and senator Munoz
yes.
Yes and yes and one excuse thank
you center on Senate bill two
thirteen which is that we are
bill.
That thank you Mr chairman and
I still have course Linda here
with us Mr chairman I'm gonna do
the same thing I did on the
first one movie up.
Move Senate bill two thirteen do
not pass that that Senate
finance committee substitute for
Senate bill to thirteen be
consider for discussion and
passage of the chart provides a
listing of the projects re
authorized in this bill the
Senate finance committee
substitute for Senate bill
thirteen re authorizes capital
projects authorized in previous
years from various funds
from various brands period re
authorizations of capital outlay
projects range from changing the
administering agency or the
original purpose of the project
extending the reversion date or
expanding the purpose of the
original project the re
authorization of funds contained
in this bill do not require new
capacity and are nonrecurring
expense to the general fund
severance tax bond fund or other
state funds any unexpected
balances remaining at the end of
the fiscal year is designated in
the bill to revert to the
originating funding sources
three months after the reversion
day.
Thank you Mr chairman.
You know you have anything that.
Mr chairman I think of I think
the biggest concern that's been
expressed during the interim
about re authorizations.
Is the number of projects that
get multi re authorization State
you know year after year
extension of time and I think
the largest concern is been the
re authorization a general fund
money.
and I think there is
approximately how much.
Twenty five million I.
Twenty.
The number of for for general
fund.
So there's about twenty five
projects that we're we authorize
that came from the general fund.
in the F. I. R. that we do will
be talking about the dollar
amount of how much was re
authorize from the general fund.
Thank you anybody on them.
Committee on zoom in the in the
audience and support anybody
against questions from committee
members.
Padilla thank you Mr chairman
madam vice chair so what is this
in terms of dollars which do you
know that yeah that we this came
out the bill just came to us
today so we haven't had an
opportunity to to do the
research for the dollars
hopefully we can have some
approximate numbers for you in
your FIR when it goes down to
the floor I'm interested in
seeing that Mr Chairman the
question I have is is more
specifically and I don't know
madam chair one stand and
minimize your chances of but
what would stop a legislator
like say I had you know is here
to give us a very robust
information every year I get my
report and see if I want to make
sure that project keeps going
that one no one's talked to me
it's you know an older project
there's not enough money it's
gonna happen it just falls off
or we're we're goes it just
expires or whatever what would
stop a legislator from taking
the ones that are going to fall
off or expire or that we don't
want to move forward for that
purpose and and introduce a bill
to turn that money and move that
money to some other project.
I I think there's more than one
way to answer that first of all
there's always been the
gentleman's rule with the
Legislative Council Service that
no one re authorizes a project
if you want the original of the
sponsor of that project unless
multiple members to put into
that money and all agree to
reauthorization.
I think senator Munoz has talked
about kind of re of the
of reforming the process for
reauthorization by not allowing
the authorizations especially if
it's already been re authorised
ones.
And we don't have such a bill
but I know sent to a neurosis
has talked about such a bill.
I would just remind members that
most of the time when there's an
extension of time.
or change of purpose is because
the local entity is not ready.
For the project they sometimes
have not asked.
For the money.
And so they let the money sit
there so that it takes an
automatically version and so we
have situations where a member
will just re authorize it to
change the purpose to another
project.
And that project may sit there.
And not be able to get expended
because it's not sufficient
funding.
And a lot of the reason why if a
local government doesn't want it
didn't ask for the money is
because they have a liability if
there's of equipment
I. T. money for schools or
whatever that they take on the
responsibility for then they
also have the insurance risk in
putting that piece of property
equipment on their inventory.
Thank you so hi I'm thank you
for that thank you for that very
detailed in a Lara long explicit
it was it was very good what
what would stop the legislature
from doing that.
That number is that ever
happened.
Yes it happen now people have
attempted it but I think they've
caught it.
There's an Council where
somebody was trying to re
awesome money that in the long
term and helpful as crowded and
told them that they can do.
What I would be for I would
never even dream of proposing
something that didn't belong to
you know but but what if it were
project that I've been
monitoring time to whatever and
suddenly there's no.
Two hundred thousand but the
thing is going to be five
million to get it done in one
why would I want to have that
two hundred thousand sit there
and eventually just evaporate
and disappear in that capacity
could I take that and move that
to something that's actually
possible the could potentially
occur.
Senator you money and we offer I
sat for a capital project that
you had this year and push more
money for that project to be
another one not not the one that
was originally intended to be on
ICAP last according to.
In order for you to make that
transfer but you kind of move
two hundred thousand to.
Whatever the top line in this
letter on the letter wrote and
we authorize that money for that
project if that money was not in
the state and it was a movie.
This is my question thank you.
Senator Gonzales of Mr chairman
of just to add a little bit more
Senator this question.
For example like when I came
into the Senate.
I assume whatever senator
Cisneros had in place the the
the position I had you know
Representative Ortez has what I
had so whoever's filling within
the position.
Thanks for the question center
we don't.
Questions from committee
members.
This is.
Worse than the last.
If you look at the statewide
agencies right you look at
off the course and from New
Mexico.
I may just pick one or you may
just know one that's getting re
off by state agents and and
let's just look at look at the
very first.
magistrate courts in Santa Fe.
We know reason why re offering
and and why that hasn't.
You may not have that right well
with the just tells you Mr Mr
chairman some of is
I'm sorry to say that some of
them had a difficult time
getting projects moving during
the pandemic.
To get workers to to get the
projects there was there were
eighty five projects that we're
extending time.
There were thirty five re
authorizations that were either
extending time and expanding the
purpose.
And there were ten that we're
just changing the person purpose
of expanding the project so the
list goes on as to the reasons
as to why you're seeing so many
re authorizations in the bill
this year.
But I I do think that the
pandemic caused a slowdown in
the work that needed to be done.
With some of the entities.
As.
Rodriguez but some of these are
a really.
Interstate Stream Commission.
It remains to that is an
authorized care of me.
Next year I I don't think I want
to even entertain a re off.
Because projects will be
underfunded and never gonna get
complete.
This this is going to grow
larges this last.
This list.
When they don't have the money
to finish the project.
We as a legislator have got a
really figure this out because.
It's just not working the way it
should work as nobody is
completely.
right.
I don't know how many times I've
seen the The New Mexico eight
six point training facility in
capital it continues not get
completed.
just.
We've got to figure this out
because.
Until we figure out of the
legislature that we don't want
to re off anymore and your
projects are going to be scored
in some way shape or form as a
brought forward and they have
that time to complete and that
dollar amount and they can
proceed with that dollar amount
completed.
We're just spinning our wheels.
Just.
As a businessman makes no common
sense the why we offer something
for up to six years
and one time I think in in may
maybe close in the pain IRS
penalties.
For selling bonds that I
projects don't use the money are
we close on any of those
projects right now
irises Committee.

very quick on this bill.
Thank you have to.
Thanks Amanda.
Center we understand you do have
an amendment that you brought to
us.
Yes I know you did bring it to
me at the strike of midnight
last night on the floor so
you're good.
Thank you.
Thank you thank you Mr chair for
scheduling this even though
with.
In the fourth quarter also
Committee for bringing up the
problem with the one point eight
billion dollars unspent money in
capital outlay.
I know it's been a passion we
need to fix that problem Senator
Campos and working on that issue
for thirty years and we're gonna
have a you have.
Opportunity.
Hello rookie journal in a couple
weeks to address that problem.
So Mister chair this bill does
three things.
To the credit.
Thanks for the purchase of the.
Motor vehicle and also a plug in
hybrid.
Also turns the.
Thanks for the.
Purchase insulation of the
charging unit.
And also
If you its the
The registration fee for a
registration fee for electric
vehicles in addition to the
circular registration fee that
everybody pays
this ten million dollars
Provided over a period of five
years beginning in may of this
year.
to incentivize the purchase of
electric vehicles which cost.
Before taxes of fifty five
thousand dollars or less.
Let me explain the.
A minute the.
Finance.
Cheers staff had a problem with
the.
Senator problem it will be
available for discussion thank
you Mr thank you very much
Senator and sorry as senator
with us and I were discussing
something very important in some
language staff so please do
there's a motion to move the
amendment for discussion Senator
thank you.
No opposition.
You madam chair.
as I was saying the.
On page ten of the FIR there
with listed several
Technical issues the two.
Were brought up by the taxed
really and this amendment
addresses that the first one
was.
Each time the credit amount to
the taxpayers the adjusted gross
maybe a problematic will
originally.
There was a.
The twenty five hundred dollar
a.
Credit for a.
Everyone except.
People are.
Single taxpayers making fifty
thousand dollars or less married
filing separately thirty seven
thousand or less for married
filing jointly of seventy five
thousand dollars or less we've
eliminated.
so it's this increased to twenty
five hundred.
To a two thousand two hundred
fifty for everybody that limits
that problem it also limits the
second problem that was raised
by tax which was
during language of the bill is
to specify that in the event of
a amended
The P. I. T. return with the
taxpayer.
R. AGL changes without intent so
there's a couple of condoms
not only with trying to
specified of the bill that also
triggered through the ministry
of nightmare and also saves five
hundred thousand dollars in the.
personal cost to administer this
so.
We've simplified the bill.
The also another.
Difficult issue the range with
the bill did not specify any
residency requirements so the
number two.
Item on the amendment takes care
of that issue and finally.
The third.
Item on the amendment two
minutes.
The problem.
With the.
It would be if it's a problem
and they suggested that the the
solution would be to remove the
provision for business entities
which we did so those are
generally to fill.
provided division bill provided
three hundred dollar a tax
credit for the installation and
purchase of the charging unit.
And it also allow business
entities to take advantage of
that tax credit where is the
purchase of.
Electric vehicle is not
something that this is the to
take advantage of so we've
eliminated that and also at the
same time simplified the bill.
So again
The
Ten million dollars available
for a.
Tax credits over a five year
period million dollars available
for insulation and purchase of
A. of charging unit the the FY
are suggestive.
The.
Constant.
The
Sure you could cost anywhere
from four hundred to a thousand
dollars.
I still one in my house for only
two hundred ninety five dollars
so.
Hello I know somebody who paid
eight hundred dollars in Santa
Fe.
So you know we all say that exit
cheaper in the country
everything is more expensive in
Santa Fe.
So the FIR suggests the two we
would bring in two hundred eight
thousand dollars.
In the twenty two twenty three
fiscal year increasing to.
I almost six hundred million and
I mean six hundred thousand in
fiscal year twenty six.
So.
Madam chair the
that concludes my remarks except
to say the.
This bill will encourage the
sale of the visa and
Reduce the emissions and will
help of.
New Mexicans take advantage of
purchasing a political thank you
thank you thank you Senator and
we appreciate very much to bring
in this health bill forward to
normally we do the amendment
would take a vote on the
amendment to accepted at least
and then we proceeded to bill
but you've done it all together
and that's fine for the sake of
time I think it worked so can we
before we go on that can we have
a motion to accept the amendment
is being presented so thank you
again there's a motion by
Senator budget Padilla and a
second by Senator Steinborn to
accept your amendment Senator
and then we so you already
explained the bill so we will
move forward with that with this
go to zoom first do we have
anyone on soon no for additional
one the signed up in four
against hundred and what about
the audience is there anyone for
for the bill can you get out
from reason.
I'm so sorry okay thank you can

accessible and works in harmony
with clean.
Our schools and clean fuels Act
to promote money saving climate
solutions for all New Mexicans
we would like to see it the
increased credit for lower
income buyers to understand.
Explanation the credit can be

the point of sale and the bill
now houses fair roads fee and
for these reasons we support the
bill thank you so much thank you
very much Camilla anyone else on
zoom.
Okay thank you for your all it's
a little delayed I guess so
thank you you can pursue can
state your name I will my name
is Tom Solomon I before needed
in New Mexico and make this
brief
I appreciate the Senator Tallman
of for bringing this bill
forward and promoting extra
purchases of electric vehicles
in the state we'll definitely
Act to reduce the impact of
climate change in New Mexico.
Mexico on behalf of our eight
thousand supporters strongly
support because thank you thank
you all right anyone else on
soon.
Jerry Valdez executive director
for the department of
transportation we want to thank
senator Clemente rings the
forwarded as we stand strong
support of this bill.
Thank you anyone else in support
on zoom.
Okay thank you anyone against on
soon now that you're coming in.
Okay thank you audience we go
and I think we had one that was
in favor correct thank you
Charlie.
The chair members of the
committee Charlie workers for
the alliance for automotive
innovation.
we support these kind of
incentives for the introduction
of the the it is consistent with
the three fuel act
and and their goals
Representative producing
electric vehicles on it the bill
quite frankly doesn't go far
enough.
but it's a beginning and so we
find that in different states
it really takes a lot of
incentive to get electric yes.
People are not you're so
inclined to leave their their
engines work on gasoline and
that they have more predictable
infrastructure and so it takes
again a long time to get the
infrastructure replacement with
the girls but it is in the
beginning and we do stand in
support we thank senator Tom for
bringing this thank you Charlie
we have trials here want to
speak for the bill the current
chair members of the committee
of Charles good marker speaking
on behalf of natural resources
defense council action fund New
Mexico Public Health Association
also southwest energy efficiency
project
we urge you to pass on this bill
what are we here to do parents
simple reducing internal
combustion engines.
Would like to
replacing them with electric
driven up autres is the fastest
lowest cost way that the state
can do to move us towards the
climate goals.
They're into their is actually
zero financial risks that the
investment may create a stranded
asset three zero need to rely on
technologies which are currently
approved in.
Yeah we're still moving towards
the clavicles passes along the
data takes effect you will be
directly contributing to a
healthier New Mexico hopefully
one that our grand children or
grandchildren's grandchildren
can enjoy it just as much as we
do thank you very much thank you
Charles anyone else for the
bill.
Anyone against the bill.
The committee members before we
go to committee let me Senator
Tallman we we accepted your
amendment for discussion earlier
but we didn't vote on the
amendment there's a process of
can we vote on the amendment
individually
let's let me just do it this way
all in favor of the amendment
that we discussed earlier
signify by saying aye.
Opposed anyone opposed so we
don't have to that good path for
your records so we can't because
it started off with the the
amendment and the bill and
discussion thank you so the
amendment has been adopted and
now committee members for any
questions on the bill.
Yes Senator Padilla.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you senator for brains and even
working on these issues since
you've been a part of this this
body is that Madam with your
permission is Mr while they're
still online.
I don't Mr Valdez on zoom are
you still on.
Yes I think yes the ages where.
Okay.
You
just wanted to ask I heard your
support for the legislation Mr
well this can you tell us a
little more about why you feel
that way.
Yeah absolutely madam chair
Senator Padilla we works in
tandem with our sister agencies
or climate action team these
energy minerals in what this
bill does is it puts a it's a
beginning step towards ensuring
that we can begin to.
And make sure that.
Yeah we can absolutely start
charging additional fees through
the registration process and so
this is being allowed to collect
fees to supplements what will be
losing fuel tax and although
this is a little bit lower than
we we hope for it to beginning
point and we can take a look
further on down the road these
have just it so from that with
the additional fees and in
charge this is the beginning
steps to not only promote
section and it not.
Because this is the place to
start ways to improve the loss
of tax as the eagles are
beginning to be more popular in
the state of New Mexico.
I thank you madam chair and and
Senator Tallman and and Mr well
this I appreciate that so if you
have a forecast on
you know so I'm very concerned
about this I mean you know.
Obviously money is not
everything in the you know the
air we breathe and and exactly
how we live here in this is
paramount it's one of the most
beautiful things about our state
but so but if you had the tell
us what what is the offset of
this revenue that's going to
come into the first is the fuel
tax I mean is it anywhere close
to what you're projecting the
fuel tax to decline by.
Yeah I know the forecast in in
this field basically is much
lower than what we would like
forecast basically it's very
concerned department
transportation in regards to the
loss of this revenue and how to
maintain roads moving forward
and so will our our
Our forecast is that looking at
the we're gonna have to of the
solution in today so we're part
with which is looking at
alternative ways to collect rose
sharks and looking at ways that
we can actually give.
Three ways to sustain this
revenue for the maintenance of
our roads this is a step in the
right direction by putting those
additional fees but definitely
from forecast perspective within
the next three to five years.
Collection of revenue he's gonna
have to be considered in our
participation request is helping
us away and planned projects in
the state internet and see what
we can do in New Mexico to
offset the loss of that revenue.
All right well thank you madam
chair and and Center comment I'm
very concerned about that but of
course there's other reasons why
you're doing this so I hear you
loud and clear there but I just
don't think we should not talk
about this is this is a big
issue that we're just heading
right towards thank you.
Thank you madam chair couple
quick comments.
Thank you.
Senator Padilla feel better.
You may feel better knowing
that.
It could.
Sales tax on electricity.
So they would be generating of
course it would be going into
the
Department transportation but
it's dition Revenue then also
failed to mention that the.
They're working on this bill for
three or four years ago start on
a hundred dollars.
Right there was down to eighty
the number down to sixty enough
it's eight fifty four dollars
which is.
That's probably a little agree
with the gentleman from DOT is a
little low but in order to get
the support.
We need to do that but we can
always increase it and then also
the act around the country.
The average is somewhere between
a hundred and fifty in some
states are charging two hundred
dollars so.
yes it's a little low but
how would be the first to
sponsor a bill to raise it with
of course if you are co
sponsored with the senator thank
you madam chair because that's
vital get done and so that's
good but no I appreciate that I
just again you know not not put
the kibosh on your bill or
anything like that I just want
us to all be very well aware
there's going to be a massive
gap that we need to fill here so
far thank you.
Thank you senator thank you is
there tell the Senator share
your next.
thank you madam chair.
So.
For the first.
Yes electric vehicles are coming
they're becoming because that's
what the market wants.
Market once it already that's
where they're coming.
So why do we need to offer.
The tax incentive.
To encourage people to do what
they're already doing.
Thank you thank you madam chair
and thank you for the the.
question it's a an order to
He encouraging folks like the
the gentleman's from DOT said
the.
There is a natural resistance of
people to Prokofiev it's in this
will just to encourage and
incentivize people to purchase
it through the
There's a limit on how much
we're going to spend and also
the.
This.
Drafted late date of the two
thousand twenty six so it's not
a
Great sum of money but I think
it's a.
A lot of people who feel that we
need this in order to
Encourage people to to purchase
the the vehicle specially here
and New Mexico.
Which is not exactly on the.
Leading edge of progress because
in other states there.
Taken off a lot faster.
I'll rattle his nine times more
charging stations and we do.
And I have three times the
population so if you do the math
they have three times more
serving stations per capita than
we do so.
Early here in New Mexico
we need a little more incentive.
So the Senator in.
You madam chair.
What vehicle for coming.
They're here.
Well it's not inertia it's
keeping it's not my it's not my
stubbornness that keeps me from
having electric vehicle.
It's my fear of being able to
try from Farmington Albuquerque
and running out of energy that
that's my fear
it has it all over New Mexico
that's it so it's not the idea
that that I need to be.
Bribed into buying an electric
vehicle all up take the thirty
two hundred dollars.
When we talk about tax
incentives for all kinds of
things we off often in our in
our efforts here to do what we
think is right we incentivize
people to do with thirty doing.
Re doing it.
Very doing.
So I'm I'm just not sure that
any incentive to do what you're
already doing.
The is warranted.
I'll certainly take money.
What do I need to be paid by the
again the tax payers of New
Mexico for me to do that I'm not
sure that's true.
The thing that I would like to
point out though.
This these are electric vehicles
which means you have to have
electric generation somewhere.
In I believe I pointed out this
committee and others if we just
took half of the.
The fleet privately owned fleet
in the United States.
Half of the privately owned
fleet the United States and turn
them into electric vehicles.
You would need to replace two
hundred San Juan generating
station generating station that
we're making are asked to close
right now.
Even though it's going to take
ninety five percent of the CO
two out of it.
You're gonna need two hundred
more.
Not two hundred more.
Wind turbines not two hundred
more solar panels.
You need two hundred more
sixteen hundred megawatt power
station.
What.
What do more these vehicles we
put on the road the more likely
it is that we run out of power
for other things this is only so
much power.
We got to keep that in mind to.
Maybe we ought to be
incentivizing carbon capture.
So that we can have more power
plants so that we can have more
of the electric vehicles on the
road.
Because I think that's a.
Again I've used this term too
many times now it's my office
we're not seeing what is around
us.
other things around us.
We need to figure out who's
going to we're all the power's
going to come from for all these
electric vehicles.
Post electric vehicles.
The fact my son.
He bought to.
Just before the election because
he said you know if Biden wins
this thing the price of gasoline
is going to go to six or seven
dollars a gallon and I don't
want to pay that let me by
electric vehicle.
We've got to.
The bottom too early he could
save himself you know.
Seven thousand dollars sure if
you done it later but.
So.
By the way my son makes me look
like a of a progressive
political.
So
Market forces already after to
make this happen.
In the force that we're not
looking at.
Is where is the power gonna come
from.
We're determined to shut down
coal we're down to determine to
shut down nuclear we're bound
and determined to shut down
natural gas.
There's not if it to to replace
sixteen hundred megawatts you
got to pay for thousands of
acres of land solar panels.
Thousands of acres of land to
replace one San Juan generating
station.
Which currently sits on twenty
acres.
Thousands of acres so.
Not only does this bill I don't
think it's necessary because
people are doing it already.
We're not looking at what else
is out there.
The other the other thing that I
think we need to be concerned
about everybody in the world is
how do these electric vehicles
come into existence they need a
couple of things eight they need
plastic to make a wide enough so
that the electric motor will
move that.
Has to come from oil and gas.
But we want to shut down oil and
gas.
But we also use a lot of rare
earth minerals we use a lot of
rare earth minerals in
everything this electronic this
has were minerals your electric
vehicle has a lot more rare
earth minerals.
Almost every rare earth minerals
that is used in American
industry today for cars for
computers for phones.
Come from China.
Because we refuse to mine them
here we can my we have my name
in New Mexico.
We have my table reverse
minerals in New Mexico right
now.
And we won't do it.
So what we do we say China give
us all your stuff and we do not
care how much pollution do you
because out there there's zero
environmental standards on their
whole fired power plants which
are building a bunch of on their
mining techniques.
You should just just Google
China's rare earth mineral mines
or or or whatever they're nasty.
They have no consideration for
the Human.
Of health no consideration for
for the the health of the earth.
And we're encouraging that.
Because we will take action
here.
We we could do it right we could
do it within fire mental
standards in mind we could do it
with the health of the people in
mind.
We don't have to slave labor
here we could they could be good
paying jobs we're in China they
are slave labor.
With zero effort to to to
protect anything humans or the
environment.
Both those rare earth minerals
come from trying to accept
cobalt which comes from the
Republic of Congo.
By Chinese company.
But the last question madam
chair.
Is based on Senate or house bill
thirty seven can I put charging
stations in front of my new
houses that I'm gonna put new
windows in thanks to the
taxpayers the taxpayers for the
charging stations to.
Because that would be really
cool thank you thirty three
hundred dollars and to the three
hundred dollars for the charging
station in.
Because I'm an entrepreneur and
if you all go to pay for pay let
me do it.
Because its energy efficient.
I don't expected answer from
that but I do expect us to think
about these things.
It's not just electric vehicles
on New Mexico roads.
It's far broader than that.
For the.
I'm gonna vote against this one
not because I oppose electric
vehicles.
Because I think we're not
thinking the whole thing the
whole world through.
And we ought to be thinking a
lot broader than we are.
Thank.
Senator share any other comments
from members of the committee as
senator Gonzalez most tribal for
two plus K. Mandy as Amanda
thank you okay there's emotions
Center Gonzalez and the second
for Senator Padilla all in favor
signify by saying aye.
Opposed hello can you show
Senator share and who said no on
zoom is Senator Burt.
Thank you for okay Senator Burt
we have you on is a no thank you
so you have a do pass Senator
thank you very much for your
bill thank you thank you madam
chair in the thank you members
of the committee thank you very
much appreciate it thank you all
right we're going to move on at
the two one speak Senator yes I
was just gonna say we're gonna
move on to to house bill seven
and that is opportunity
enterprise Act and we have
Representative Linda Serrato
here to put this bill up and
then we're gonna stop there and
head out to the Senate chamber
so Representative thank you good
to see you have I can't see
behind the masks of who's here
is that Marquita all Marquita
I'm sorry.
This is yes thank you good to
see you all right so tell us
about your bill in your building
from thank you madam chairman
thank you to the senators of the
committee on the opportunity
enterprise fund is a partnership
and funding program that's
created within NMFA to support
local communities that want to
build and invest in commercial
and entrepreneurial spaces and
it will directly support
economic development in these
communities a local communities
are the best position to know
what their communities need
whether it's a commercial
kitchen or smart manufacturing
hub are ready industrial space
not just to make sure that
they're fostering micro and
small businesses locally I'm it
would allow us to use one time
access revenue to support
economic diversification
throughout the state with the
multiplier effect and set of
future revenue streams the
program is distinct from Lida
and other existing programs and
fills a gap in our economic
toolbox by addressing the dire
need for industrial space in our
in our state I'll just say very
briefly it essentially provides
two distinct paths for funding
through the frontier first is
financing and leasing a space
and the second is through direct
loans or loan guarantees to
build the space and it is paid
the phone is replenished by rent
paid into it so I'll stop there
and I will we're stand for any
questions thank you thank you
Representative well well said
marketed did you want to add
anything then turn here to
answer any questions you might
have thank you very much do we
have any of the one on zoom for
the bill.
Anyone against the bill on soon.
Okay how about the audience
anyone in the audience support
in the bill.
Anyone against this bill all
right committee members what's
your pleasure your comments if
you have any would no Senator
what that didn't see your hand
out there.
Thank you madam chair.
Okay so madam chair I guess I
need to understand.
How this works.
Let's see here that.
The.
Estimated operating budget table
reflects a three hundred
thousand to twenty million
actual funded to.
Annual financial impact.
So how much money you asking for
start this program thank you
chairman thank you senator
there's actually already in the
budget I believe it's seventy
million to start the project I
believe those were early
estimates before the budget was
put together.
And madam chair to relative to
appropriations is to be placed
in the finance authority we
already have similar functions
within the finance authority for
lending and for construction
management there is in that one
option the for that allows for
the fund to be used to finance
and lease out the space would be
basically owned by the NMFA
through the state partnership in
those instances we would work
with GST to do the leasing and
we also work with economic
development to help bring in the
projects over through the board
that will ultimately vet them so
the finance authority's primary
duties will be those that we
already do we anticipate adding
a staff member to help in those
efforts we are of course not for
budgeted entity
so that's how the operations
would occur thank you Marquita
all right do we have any other
Senator is that.
William and that the.
Okay madam chair it says here.
That the.
Mexico.
Fund it's with the witty and
Economic Development Department.
To provide financing leases
loans and revolving fund.
To applicants who qualify.
So.
Do you think about projects.
Tell me how I can bring a what
kind of project you're talking
about and how I can bring that
to you madam chair.
So if I may offer madam chair
and senator a kind of simple up
in Cuesta for example they have
the question economic
development fund and other they
were able to build with through
that fund that was because the
money had left on their able to
build an industrial space and I
was in consultation with the
community on what they wanted to
build out there and with that
they were able to work to bring
house breaks into the community
and have you know does jobs so
how this would work is it NMFA
through an application process
our communities could apply to
and and private collaborate with
private collaboration could
apply to have a space like that
bills and then the rent to the
would get paid into that too by
the businesses that are there
the risk that we get paid into
that would go back into the
revolving fund on this managed
through NMFA and GST would help
with that leasing process.
From and madam chair the other
thing is that that's one way in
which the fund may be used it
could be that there is somebody
that's willing to build the
facility but need some
additional capital particularly
when you get out into the more
rural areas some of these large
industrial spaces cost more to
build than the appraisal will
come out and so not commercial
facility commercial banks aren't
able to fully land on those
buildings so we're able to use
this Fund in those instances to
either make the loan directly or
to provide a guarantee to the
bank in order for that private
entity to go for a bill that
space in the instance in which
there is not a private entity
interested in building that
space there for the loan
wouldn't work in a guarantee
wouldn't work that's when this
third option that that
representatives about the
mentioned which is that the fund
could then be used to build the
facility itself and then it
would be leased by GST.
but the applications would come
in through the economic
development department and the
opportunity enterprise zones of
board so there is a board that
will best these that's an
important element because the
finance authority is a funding
and to do we're not really and
economic development entity in
that same way so we do rely on
policy partners to bring in the
right projects to us and say
these are good to fund go fund
these projects and then we work
with the financing to make
certain that it makes sense from
a financial perspective.
So we understand you.
The first uses to build a
facility a building.
Thank you use is to.
Attract.
People into the building to rip
the building.
In the third use is to provide
that.
Seed money for.
The guy that threaten the
building from the guy that
you've been built the building
from.
So.
No Senator I don't think I was
clear and I apologize there are
three ways in which the funds
may be used and two of the
require a private entity to want
to build the facility they must
have an idea that worked with
the community and they want to
build a space if they haven't
bank on board but can't get all
the funding it's possible for us
to make a guarantee on that loan
or it's possible for us to make
a portion of the loan or all of
the loan directly through the
frontier so into the instances
you would have an interested
party developer something.
Wanting to.
Bill that space.
When there isn't someone that's
interested in building that
space but the community has
already identified a significant
need and opportunity they can
come to the board and ask for
this board to support the
construction of the facility and
that building would be then
built owned by the state.
And then leased out through by
GST to to private businesses so
in each instance the dollars are
going to be used either
guarantee or
build the actual facility.
The problem madam president of.
Chairman.
Communities of guts and
buildings already there.
But nobody's occupy.
And so it's not the fact that
you they may not be the perfect
size for whatever.
But they're they're big box
stores that have been vacated
in.
That kind of thing that's pretty
big square footage in there.
But we can't attract anybody to.
So how are you going to help me
attract someone to my building
already got a building so how to
attract someone to mobile.
What you're talking about if I
may madam chair and and senator
that's a great question and and
this program would allow NMFA to
acquire currently builds pro
already existing buildings on
this is really working closely
with the community about what is
a tractable what jobs you know
our our working already with the
development of the work force
locally so that you have that
synergy and that way you know
that's something that NMFA can
work with GST to develop that
that existing space so that it
can attract the businesses or
that may already be interested
that fit the work force that
exists in your community.
But I've got I've got a billion
close that to call center.
A bit of trying you know to ask
around the phone someone that
wants to thank you for call
centers already set up for that.
And and you know I've been.
Trying to deal with that and
I've got a a billing in into
from Kerry that's a big box
store that to set up their break
go far cannot only thing renders
they put a food truck up there
once in awhile so who.
Zero.
We live in the country.
Login there was a guy that
wanted to to build a food
manufacturing deal and low.
And.
We tried to find him a building
and maybe this will work for him
because of
We've been talking to.
To economic development
department about you know trying
to to figure out how to get that
food production bill in the Lok.
but then water problem.
So.
Yes I don't quite understand.
How you have been the.
From which.
Because we've got economic
development people trying
everyday to attract business
there.
And we have billions there.
The week eight CM to.
Get the two hooked up.
So I will listen to further
discussion.
Madam chair thank you senator
Wirth thank you Representative a
marketer for your responses any
other committee members Senator
Steinborn.
Thank you.
managed care so Representative
bye and service hi
So a lot of learning in this
bill.
Because I've been the sponsor of
the bill to create the public
bank.
And.
The public thank by the way
similar because we would see
that with about fifty million
the differences it would be
charters a bank it would be run
by someone who successfully run
a financial is institution would
have a diversified portfolio
that without chair just.
I give you just a little nervous
about this
In the last two questions
Number one are we proposing that
the state become a commercial
landlord in a way that it
finance big buildings and then
just take on the responsibility
of.
Owning those buildings and
leasing them and all that.
Madam chair that is one of the
options that is available I
wouldn't call it necessarily
commercial landlord but it to
help support the economic
development in small communities
where there wasn't you know
someone that wanted to do that
but those communities on need
that was you know accepted
invented by that board so they
would be in a landlord in that
instance.
So madam chair I think that's
taking on big time big time
assumption of risk of you know
to on a big asset like that you
know Los crucis just through
unforeseen cascade of economic
events we got a downtown filled
with empty buildings and it can
happen.
And the so how equipped is the
state to suddenly be a
commercial landlord you know and
have to take on that obligation
of running at little leasing at.
But I will say that I know that
sometimes economic develop would
like center which was saying we
need specs spaces we need spaces
and then I could see this
filling that need maybe that's
the purpose of the bill really.
But I don't know so we're
comfortable with some side works
like that I don't know
Question number two is madam
chair representative Marquita of
just trying to find it again in
in the bill that was their
language in here that said that
it would only.
Do financial deals where there
was they didn't have money
available elsewhere.
Chairman and senator can use a
clear that again.
Yeah I thought there was
language in the bill madam chair
said that we that we would only
be allowing this operation to go
into these ventures when money
wasn't available elsewhere.
We're the ones not financing
available elsewhere requirement
for you that the bill.
In other words this is last
resort kind of thank you have a
last resort like madam chair yes
it is in section.
I'm in the section eight.
For Mr some section for
Our subsection for provide
sufficient evidence that other
means of financing over proposed
enterprise Development Act or
unavailable or insufficient.
And again chair thank one of the
things that I would no that is
in those instances in which
you're building a building
particularly in rural areas as I
said earlier often the cost of
construction will out of pace
the size of the the the
appraisal for the facility just
because there's not a lot of
free market use for it.
In if you are not owner occupied
building there are programs
through the federal government
and others that will allow you
to borrow money and they will
subordinate the loan that
doesn't exist for non owner
occupied facilities and so what
this does is really attempt to
do to help in those instances
like the what they call the
espys five A4 program where you
can either bridge the gap with
capital or in the you know the
instance of which there really
is not of an entity willing to
step up and take on the brunt of
the development the to actually
oversee the construction of
that.
No it.
Madam chair
The agency Russell do you.
Do you have staff that can
manage these these projects or
is a seventy million that's in
the budget gonna help with staff
positions to.
To manage these assets thank you
madam chair that's a really
important point we do not have
we don't oversee we don't manage
properties that's not of course
skill set of the finance
authority what's contemplated in
this bill is that the finance
authority would enter into a
lease with GSD a master lease
and that they would do the sub
leasing of all that so there
would be the the lease that we
enter into a GST would basically
be the
source of repayment for the loan
to replenish the revolving fund
and then they would go ahead and
sublease that at market rents
and there's a provision for
excess rents to then go back to
the you know to to return to the
general fund so really in the
instance in which the project
went sideways.
four you know there was an
economic downturn and it could
stay at the because the finance
authority is the lender and
because GST is the lessee we
would be in a position to to
work with GST to abate or
re negotiate the terms of the
lease so that they could so that
the loan would stay good and we
would you know to cast funded
loan so we don't have funds it
wouldn't get paid it would just
take a little longer for the
return of that loan
to come to fruition.
The
Madam chair and representative
has this been done anywhere else
is there another model out there
that were inspired by.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator I don't believe so but
what I'm sorry I shouldn't say
that to my knowledge and I'm not
aware of that however New Mexico
is in a unique position where we
are far behind on industrial
space compared to our
surrounding states so this gives
us an opportunity catch up to
where a lot of our surrounding
states already are and an
industrial space and madam chair
the primary sponsor on this had
done a lot of research with
other she's been working on this
for six months or so
Representative X. and and has
been looking at what other
states offer and tried to pull
the best elements together
for New Mexico's purposes so I
don't think there's a matching
up program but that there are
elements of this program that
you'll see perhaps in
Massachusetts or you know and
others
Or again other states that are
that have similar kinds of
assistance programs.
This indicates that I am still
trying to work through it Madam
this is the big one
So to speak so Madam chair
representative marcado so we'll
TS who will be on point as far
as negotiating these deals and
handling the business aspect of.
Running the financials and I
guess there's a board that will
do that who exactly will the
board hire staff with experience
in commercial real estate.
Not me through that Madam chair
of the board will be
recommending the Economic
Development elements of the
project and will look at
feasibility issues the person I
would hire would be a commercial
real estate lender someone that
understood how those the
financial side works but your
your right to to highlight or
zoom in on the fact that you
need the technical expertise
that GST brings that the finance
authority does not have so the
concept here is to take the best
of the Economic Development
Department GSD in the finance
authority and pair it with a
board that would fit this
projects madam chair I just
really honestly wonder how much
experience GSD has in the
commercial real estate market I
understand the on state building
so they rent buildings to state
agencies but what we're talking
about here is is economically
viable loaned really I mean
that's that's that's a whole
different deal but I doubt we're
probably in the business of it's
not so you could hire someone
without experience into a
contract.
I just really we're a I worry on
one side about us being on the
hook for a bunch of buildings on
the other hand I can see the
opportunity of creating
legislation basically a commune
it can create new opportunity
and I'm sure this was probably
direct driving the bill.
So anyway it's something madam
chair and representative of I
thought a lot about having to
create legislation for public
bank when you think about how to
manage risk how to hire
professionals how you put all
that law to guarantee it
And I'm not sure this has that
level of safeguards in my
opinion like the things that
we're talking about would be
great if they were in the bill
but so anyway I'll
I'll stop right there keep
listening to the debate thank
thank you Senator anyone else
any comments or questions to the
committee all right what's the
pleasure the committee for two
budget Senator Gonzales is move
