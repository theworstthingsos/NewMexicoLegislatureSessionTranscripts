OK, thank you, chair and members
of the committee, um.
Uh, this is a House Bill 191,
uh, sitting here for Senator
Campos and Representative Nathan
Small. It creates two
wildfire-related permanent funds
administered by the uh by MED.
Uh, the post wildfire Fund and
the wildfire suppression Fund,
uh, our expert here uh today has
told me that this is the best
bill that he's seen in, in quite
some time. And uh the wildfire
suppression fund will provide
support for costs associated
with actively fighting
wildfires, including
firefighting tools, equipment
and training and paying
emergency hire well.
I heard wildland firefighters,
no appropriation is included in
the bill or the LFCC GAA for the
suppression fund, which will
continue to be funded
predominantly by emergency
orders and then this is, and
will stand for some.
A you're having that.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, I would just add that
this is an LFC sponsored bill.
There's 12 million currently in
the GA. Thank you in the
audience to support?
Somebody in support this thing
and got to roll over it.
Anybody in opposition.
Zoom
Yes
Nobody, I think Senator Woods is
in opposition. He raised his
hand when you asked.
Uh,
one quick question. So we've got
money, but we don't have fun.
Mr. Chairman, uh, currently
there is money in the bill, and
that is going to be, you know,
essentially if this bill is
passed, then the 12 million
would then go to that fund.
Conti, yes.
Like
Do you have a question, Senator
Bran?
Sarah Lani.
to bison.
Senator Truhill has a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Senator, and thank you for
being here to present this. What
are some of the, what are they
gonna do? I mean, I see the
money is going to Ener, right?
Um, what are some of the things
that they're gonna do to
suppress wildfires? Is it one of
the things that we've talked
about in the past, thinning
forests, cleaning brush.
Uh, Mr. Chairman and senator,
essentially it's, it's
firefighting tools, uh,
equipment, training, and then
paying of the wildland
firefighters. So there's, and I
think we know that that's a
growing a required growing, uh,
um.
Uh, workforce because of what
we're dealing with right now and
and we all know what
Yeah.
So I'm wondering how does this
fit in with some of the other
fire suppression bills. I, I
noticed that there's not a
conflict or duplication or as I
look at the FIR, um, that
doesn't, they don't list any,
but we've had a lot of different
and bills come forward here.
So, so, uh, chair and senator
what I'm understanding uh
because I worked with Senator
Campos a couple of years ago and
he was able to set up that
larger fund, is there's really 3
types of issues going on,
mitigation, suppression and and
post wildfire. And so I think
these
Various groups as you are, you
know, it seems like we have a
lot of hands in the trying to
get this done. I think there's
an awful lot of need on
mitigation so that we don't deal
with this suppression after.
We've got to ensure that
Senator, Mr. Chairman, if I
would just add on to that
answer. I think a good way to
think about these two funds is
that it's the current actions
that Emner does. So I wouldn't
think of them as maybe doing new
things, but it's providing
better financial stability,
better reporting and more
funding towards current action.
Thank you and um Mr. Chairman,
Senator, I'm thinking.
That much of the fires that have
happened.
have not been
How do we, how do we, is this
going to help us in any way.
To prepare for
particularly since we know that
there's been
Forest
Rangers that have been fired.
Um, those who are, who are
taking care of our, um, how are
we going to make sure that
Whatever happens on federal
land, which could be very
unfortunate.
doesn't seep over into state
land.
Will this help with that? Well,
Chairman and Senator, I guess,
you know, I, I don't know that
the two of us could answer that
for you. The state forester is
on her way over here. Maybe
that'd be the
I think it's in all of the above
solution. I mean, these, these
fires on, on the federal lands,
do you, do you carry over into
state lands and I think that
having at least our portion of
the show, uh, set up and ready
to deal with this is, is a good
idea.
That answer, I completely agree.
I would also add one of the key
parts of these two funds is the
reporting mechanism. So these
funds would have all the.
Federal reimbursement
legislature would have a better
idea of how many dollars are
going towards these different
fires.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. So I'll just make a
comment, um, our uncle and aunt
have a cabin up in beautiful I
uh Cow Creek.
And um when the fires start
moving in that direction, it's
hard to get Uncle Amundo out of
there.
As his desire is to protect the
cab is retirement, so I
appreciate that we're going to
invest in trying to help make
sure.
That these, these properties
that many of our families own.
And have invested in over the
years are going to be taken care
of and that their lives are
spared. Thank you.
Tinder um rent.
I think Miss Chairman, thank
you, Senator, um.
So, do, do we usually pay for
Uh, fighting fires that are on
forest land.
National Forest land.
The chair and, and, uh.
And Senator, I happen to learn
about this a couple of years
ago. Uh, we don't, and then, but
if we are forced to because
there are times where we are
forced to the and.
It gets paid
That's your guess is as good as
mine.
So Mr. uh,
Chairman and senator, so when,
when we send to win the national
force decides they want to burn
down the forest because they
really like to do that.
Um
Then
Do we just like put our people
on our part, although we really
don't have much of our own
forest. It's mostly national,
isn't it?
etc. I, I, well, you want to
answer that one. I don't know
that I can answer that for you,
sir.
Mr. Chairman Senator, the state
forester is going to be here in
2 minutes. We'll just say,
broadly speaking, is going to
respond and then federal.
Then the reimbursement process
starts who necessarily is going
to find it. So that's what these
two funds are aimed in the state
forestry is right here.
Maybe, maybe Senator Bran, Mr.
Chair, if you could just repeat
your question, I'm sure that.
Mr. Chairman, um,
Ma'am, would you mind
introducing yourself? I don't
know your name.
I'm sorry.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and
Senator. I'm Laura McCarthy. I'm
the state forester.
Uh, which is, uh,
Forestry division director
within Energy, Minerals and
Natural Resources. Um thank you.
So I was just wondering, um, you
know, most of our forest is
national, you know, just the,
you know, when we became a state
federal government didn't think
we were responsible enough to
take care of our own forest.
And so they kept most of it, um,
and then they burn it down
because they think that's the
right way to manage it, um, so
when, when the National Forest
decides to burn down the forest,
do we send our people in to
fight it?
Mr. Chairman and Senator.
We do all wildfire response as
an interagency effort.
And we have a.
Master cooperative agreement
between.
All the federal land management
agencies and the state of New
Mexico.
And
Whoever's jurisdiction the fire
starts on is in charge of the
ordering of resources.
So if we are ordered.
Through the interagency ordering
system, then our state crews
will respond.
OK, I mean that makes sense, but
um.
Mm
Do we, do we know if the I
talked to the National Force.
Person several years back that
they were trying to get a plan
approved. Do you know if they
ever got that plan approved?
To manage the force.
Uh, Mr. Chair and senator.
The national forest plans.
Time consuming and not
particularly efficient.
And uh as the state of New
Mexico, we comment on their
plans, but I don't invest a lot
of our staff time because I
don't.
So, uh, Mr. Chairman, um.
The
Laura, you're, so you kind of
agree with me then don't do a
very good job managing the
forest.
Uh, Mr. Chair and Senator, I, I
will be in DC as soon as the
topic.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
It's just.
You know, we've got
You know, the, the, the worst
fires we've ever had in this
state.
were caused by
The federal government.
In
The force because.
They think it's a really great
idea to start controlled burns
in
Late March, early April.
Which is the windiest times of
the year that we ever see.
Um
And that our win competes with
most hurricanes.
Uh, during that time of year,
and that's when they think it's
a good idea to start fires, so
um.
I think we need to do something
even if it means, you know, our
AG get off his rear end and
actually sue them.
Um, because it seems like
They're own, that's all they're
afraid of is um.
But
I know you don't want to comment
on any of that, so I'm just
editorializing a little bit.
Um
You know, the fact is that
Um
They claim they can manage the
forest better than us. They've
proven they can't.
And maybe it's time for us to
actually ask for our land back.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman
Thank you, uh, Senator Lin.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Good afternoon.
Um, Laura.
I believe I watched a
presentation you gave when the
Riodoso fires were going on in
Las Vegas.
You remember that? OK. I wanted
to make sure that it was, it was
your presentation first, but you
did a good job and I, I know
that was a time when that was
the hot topic because it was
going on at the time. But one of
the things that you brought up,
Mr. Chair, was that, um,
The mitigation part of it.
Now I know we're here to talk
about the funds and, and we'll
get to that.
But
When you gave that presentation.
You were
We, I mean, we talked about
insurance and we talked about
All kinds of different things,
but the mitigation part of it,
where did that end up because
you were advocating.
For all kinds of things.
Trying to prevent fires.
I just kind of want a little
update. I don't know if it's
appropriate to do it right now,
but
Um, there are two answers to
that, Mr. Chair and Senator.
Um, I'll give the first one and
the first answer is Senate Bill
33 is in fact a home hardening
mitigation bill.
That would set up a wildfire
prepared fund that did come.
And chair and senator, uh, we
passed through this committee
through the Senate's in the
House right now, it's on the
House floor actually. It's in
the Joint Memorial One, which is
a, uh, for, uh, which we can
create actually an economy
development department and uh
and essentially, you know, uh,
clean up, study, all departments
together, old economy that used
to exist in New Mexico, bring
that back.
Which will help with the
mitigation, so.
Yes, and Mr. Chair, I'm a big
fan on logging. I think, I think
we've got to get back to doing
some of that, and that'll be,
that'll take part.
Take care of part of it at
least.
Um, but in your presentation,
you were, you were talking
about.
How
When the fires were over and,
and I do remember those bills,
by the way, and did you have
input on those bills?
Good, good, because I, I really
did enjoy your presentation.
Mr. Chair, so
In that presentation, you were
talking about when we start
rebuilding.
Riodoso
That you were gonna work closely
with
City government, county
governments on the mitigation
part of it. Did, did you get
that?
After the fires were completed.
Mr. Chair and Senator um
Representative Vincent Harlem
Vincent has been extremely
active on that front. We've been
working really closely together.
And another one of the bills is
3 that will
If passed, will set up uh a
system for us to provide
training.
In wood grading so that New
Mexico.
Uh, lumber can be used for
residential purposes, if it's
of.
And I, I appreciate everything
that that you've done and
working on. So now, if we get to
the fund, does the fund have
anything to do with the
mitigation part of it.
Or is this
Just in the suppression
and Senator, um, the committee
substitute for this bill very
purposely set up the suppression
fund and the post wildfire fun
Just in the suppression
and Senator, um, the committee
substitute for this bill very
purposely set up the suppression
fund and the post wildfire fund,
because those are, are two
biggest gaps in terms of funding
mechanisms.
The state already has.
For mitigation of forest land
protection revolving fund.
Which is where, um,
Uh, for example, $20 million ago
was deposited into that fund,
and then used over a 3 year time
period for mitigation projects
that will treat thinning, not
home hardened.
Good, thank you. And Mr. Chair,
Laura.
So in San Juan County, we had a,
we had a flood.
And FEMA came in, you know, we,
we, um,
Declared it an emergency
bea came in.
And it was my first one on one
with FEMA and my uncle has
passed away since then, and he
was a big FEMA guy, so I had to
really watch what I said, but it
was extremely cumbersome to work
with FEMA.
And so that's, if we create a
fund like this, and we throw
money at it first.
Are you, do you feel comfortable
that FEMA will reimburse like
they're supposed to.
um
There's a lot of and
And I, I get it. And I, I don't
mean to prod, but you know.
Well, I appreciate it, Mr.
Chair. um.
I, I think you and I, I know
this is very important work and
uh this fund will be.
One of many steps you're taking,
so I appreciate it. I just want
to say though that one of the
biggest reasons we're trying to
do this is so there's or tacos.
We want them to be able to roam
freely and continue to build
well and Mr. Chair, Senator, I
understand that there is some uh
some mascots out there that are
buffalo mascots and they might
be a little nervous about all of
that. Thank you.
Don't those mascots have wings?
And they're not really buffalo,
they just sell wings, right?
And we're saving the free range
rough buffalo, right?
Senator uh Gonzalez.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman.
And um
Thank you to
A percent or so.
I'm just asking um.
Is there any thought of um.
Introducing more livestock into
grazing.
When, when we have that.
You know, it was so.
We had less of a high potential
fires because, you know, they
would clean.
And is there any discussion to
that?
Mr. Chair, we work very closely
with agriculture.
That would, um.
The grazing is more um.
And in their area of expertise,
I will say though.
That when forests are better
managed and when the oak tree
overgrowth is.
Uh, very well and uh.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, a little bit
to um.
One of the questions that was
brought by Senator Trujillo.
I don't think you can even
picture the imagination of it's
huge.
And um
So, um
How we're gonna break that into
area sections.
And to work with um.
Statewide, you know, it's a big
task.
Gotta start somewhere.
Mr. Chair and Senator, I'm very
much looking forward to seeing
what House Bill 2 looks like.
For a special appropriation that
would.
The that we would be using to
set those priorities because as
you correctly point out, we
can't do it all at one every
time we make a choice to invest
in a project in a certain
location we're doing it right,
implementing
the other part is um.
Several years back
Soil and Conservation program.
They had established in so many.
Like a mapping part.
Of a dry hydrants. I think they
pretty much.
I don't think they're even
working.
But uh that would be another
step to.
Just to make sure that you can
get water.
You know, when, when you need it
on a.
It responds
And do you, do you have any
information on that.
Uh, Mr. Chair and senator.
Um, I don't really, what I hear
from our um.
Late last weeks.
That uh abilities, which then
affect local fire departments
ability to fill their fire
engines with water.
Uh, and we had a discussion
about wildland firefighting and
the techniques that we use that
do not require
Uh, substantial quantities of
water.
But I can follow up with more.
End of Mr. Chairman, the last
part, um.
Is there any thought into uh.
Also see a.
You know, establishing maybe a
better hill of ports.
To her um
For that access to.
To be available.
Mr. Chair and Senator, I can
also get you um a slide that
I viewed last week that shows
the location of all of the, the
number and location.
Of helicopters.
For both New Mexico and Arizona.
Uh, that will be.
Very well, thank you as
Chairman. Thank you.
Senator Shindo and then we'll go
back to Senator Woods.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you for the presentation.
Uh, who is all eligible for this
fund?
Mr. Chairman, Senator, um, I
think currently the framework
for the nerd, um.
Currently the bill is written
for other entities to be
eligible for this.
Explain that again.
Program, it would specifically
be funds tied to Ener for uses
of.
So if the wildfire happened on
tribal land or start on federal
or state.
Get on the tribal land and then
how does that work?
Mr. Chair and
Senator. So every uh wildfire
will, that is
multi-jurisdictional, we'll have
a cost share agreement and
Um, the state of New Mexico.
Forestry division.
Jurisdiction in terms of our
responsibility to pay for
wildfires is.
Non-federal, non-municipal,
non-tribal.
Now, we do enter into those cost
share agreements and the BIA
would be covering the tribal.
That's so, so that's part of the
Depression fund or suppression
part of it.
What about on the post fire
fund?
Mr. Chair and Senator, uh, it
would work the same way.
Now that said, we have a lot
more experience with virus
suppression than we do with
post-fire because it's really
only in the last um decade that
are postfi needs as a state have
ramped up substantially.
Mm
What, what are all the
activities?
That would happen under the post
fire.
Or what will be funded under the
post fire fund Mr. Chair and
senator.
The primary activities are
related to stable of um damaged
watersheds, so slope
stabilization, erosion control,
and then once the slopes are
stable.
Re
So if a tribe, whether it's ya,
hamus, I think, Lagunaa
Mescalero.
Uh, that have forest lands if
they wanted to do seedlings or
whatever, they would not be
eligible for this fund.
Uh
Mr. Chair and Senator, no,
that's not correct. I can give
you an actual specific examples.
So thank you for clarifying in
the special session in 2024.
This body
Appropriated $10 million through
House Bill 1.
To
The energy, minerals and natural
resources department and we have
been working with the mess in
the South Fork and salt fires
and we have recently completed a
$3.5 million.
Agreement wherein that House
bill one money will go to the
Mescalero tribe to do.
I believe there's also a
fencing.
When the lost conscious fire
happened and burn.
The eastern side of the Haus.
Reservation, would they be
eligible?
Even though it was a few years
back, but devastated the entire
reservation on the eastern side.
The forest area, Mr. Chair and,
uh, Senator, I don't, I don't
see why not. um, I will say that
we have active partnerships and
projects with
Uh
He is codi.
And some Felipe Puebloss whom
were affected.
All righty.
I think that's it for now, so.
Thank you.
Senator Woods
Yeah, uh, Mr. Chair.
Tell me about the fire going
right now over the wagon mount.
What do we got on that?
Mr. Chair and Senator, I am out.
Good, um, I wanna, if, if I may
just take this moment to
recognize our state who um
But on that fire and uh did
exactly what needed to be done
in a really dangerous, uh, we're
not in the news.
kind of Mr. Chair and Laura, how
many acres or how many, how much
burned in that fire.
Mr. Chair and Senator, the
estimate is between 10,000 and
12,000 acres.
Pre big far.
So they did a good job
containing that, hitting pretty
high wind situation, wasn't it?
Mr. Chair and senator, it was
pretty dicey.
Um, but they, they, um.
They were prepared, they were
professional, high emotion
around that fire our folks, uh,
state and local just focused on
the work.
On, on that particular fire, was
that right there around wagon
mount off the interstate, or was
it back towards the forest a
little more, uh, I didn't get a
real good area,
it was, um, if you picture where
Wagon Mound is, it was to the.
About 15 miles.
OK, so it was pretty well on the
flats, I mean, out of the force
that.
Mr. Chair and Senator, yes,
although, uh, we were concerned,
um, the canyons have a lot of um
PJ vegetation and we were
concerned about it getting down
in there.
And I will also say up again on
Monday, Tuesday, so it was um.
You know
They do a really good job uh on
the.
Containing the perimeter of that
fire, so again. Yeah, exactly
and, and was that off of a
highway fire or how did, what
was the start of that ignition,
you got any idea, Mr. Chair, Mr.
Chair and Senator, we do know it
was um.
Well what I've seen are pictures
of a pole that burned and a
utility I don't have further
details.
No
That's
exact thing that you've been
working on.
Then didn't get it very far,
but.
We, we've been trying to work on
that right away and that kind of
stuff, trying to, trying to keep
the electricity on in this
state.
And there you go, it's one of
those deals.
Yeah.
Yeah, those high winds and those
wires hanging up in the air and,
and pushing and it just a tough
deal, a tough deal. We've got
technology that can cure some of
that stuff that can turn those
lines off before they, they hit
the ground, but it takes money
to put that technology into use.
I don't know how we're gonna get
that done, but we need to.
We need to do some things on
that in there.
Um, well, thank goodness that
our firemen are safe and
countries are safe and uh.
Animals are safe from.
A wildfire.
That old country right there, it
could sweep across a lot of
country in a hurry. I've seen
some of those wildfires go a
mile every 5 minutes.
I mean, it just
They really move, and it's hard
to fight them because you can't
afford to get in front of them.
And you just nearly have to her
those things.
And it's, it's a son of a gun.
So
Mr. Chair and Senator, may I
also, um, really thank the New,
New Mexico Department of
Transportation we have
agreements with them and we've
been training they do, they were
really the heroes in this one.
Yeah, the blade operators that
get out there and cut those fire
lines is, is a huge deal, yeah.
Yeah, they can, they can stop
it, they can stop a lot of those
sparks from rolling.
And uh I've seen those fires
just roll.
This role and, and I've seen it
come down through there, they'll
be a.
A fire come across from the top
and there'll be another fire
burning blow it. It may be a
quarter mile behind the first
fire.
It's far as uh
Amazing thing to watch.
scary thing to be in.
So
Please.
Extend our
Congratulations.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Senator Truil
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you, uh, Laura for being
here. I really, I, I didn't get
a chance to ask you when I was
asking questions, you weren't
here, so I'm glad you.
Got here. I think most of my
questions have been answered. I
just have one thing I was
wondering about is um with the
money that comes in for this
forest.
Um, you know, to prepare for
wildfires, do you involve our
public schools in any way. I
know other states very much
involve public schools and
things like forest restoration
and, and I, I don't know about
thinning, but I'm, I'm just
wondering, you know, if, if, if
inner includes public schools in
any of these projects.
Mr. Chair and Senator, we do, we
operate out of 6 and we
frequently get requests from
schools for our foresters.
The come do programs and or take
students out on field trips.
That's great. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Thank you. Let me ask you some
questions. I'm gonna go to page
6.
Um, starting a line 20.
One
It says you struck some language
there.
burning on control.
Mm
Forest fire
You struck means and wildfire
area.
a fire and you struck.
Uncontrolled lands, holy parts.
But you put an originating from
an unplanned ignition such as
lightning.
Unauthorized or accidental human
caused fire.
Or prescribed fire that is
declared a wired wire.
Why did we strike lines?
much 2
22 through 20.
Or
Mr. Chair.
So the, that language that was
struck, um.
Dates back to the first
iteration of the forest concert.
Uh, we've been in a process, uh,
through every 60 day session
since I've been state forester
of updating. So if this bill
passes, it will, uh, it will be
contained within the forest
Conservation Act and
Um, the definition that we.
are replacing it with uh
corresponds exactly to the
national definition.
Under the National Wildfire
Coordinating Group glossary.
Which is used will create some
simplicity for us when it's time
to seek reimbursement and cost
shares.
And then on the same page on 6,
you have the language.
Such as
I never heard such as lightning
in a bill.
Never heard of that, such as
lightning. When you say
lightning.
Such as
And then
On, on unauthorized or
accidental human cause fires.
What if somebody lights a fire
on purpose.
Uh, Mr. Chair and Senator, uh,
we are not changing the arson
statute were to light a fire on
purpose.
But then if you don't change the
arson statute and someone lights
it and turns into wildfire, you
still got to find it with these
funds.
That correct, Austin. He shaking
his head, that is,
uh correct. I'm thinking through
what you're saying, um.
So you want flexibility is what
I'm trying to get arson statute
does give us the ability to
recoup um funding and I can know
of at least one example where uh
private landowner, um, did start
a prescribed burn that did
escape and we did use that arson
statute to recoup the state's
losses. Uh, most wildfire.
that, well, that's, that's an
accidental, you didn't want to
get in too deep in the weeds
because you think it would, you
couldn't comprehend it or what.
No, I think I just finished my
thought, Mr. Chair.
Right, so Austin, do you think
we got to put something in there
just in case, I mean, you can
have a prescribed burn, my
father-in-law, South Side River
Road in Farmington had a
prescribed burn one time and got
a tree on fire and the whole
fire department showed up and
Kind of spread and he was
unauthorized fire, but it kind
of spread on them.
And so I just want to make sure
this jumps from one guy's
property to next, next guys when
they're having prescribed burn.
Or an authorized burn.
That that they can get this
fund, Mr. Chair, the, the
standard of practice is that um
if a prescribed burn escapes its
prediction, it's prescription
jumps its boundaries, gets out
of control, then it is declared
a wildfire and would be as a
fire suppression. And that is
also um in the definitions that
we use and how many acres does
it have to burn to be a
wildfire.
Mr. Chair and senator, it's not
determined by acres, it's
determined by.
If it escape
Then let's go to page 7.
And it starts on line 3.
I thought we already have this
in so many bills and.
Mm
Rehabilitation of the forest,
slope stabilation, and how many
places do we have funding for
that?
Why would we need to do this in
this bill when this is mainly
just to control wildfires. I
can't remember the fun that
center worth and Senator Novelle
created.
We put money everywhere. There's
money everywhere for after.
afterwards. Am I right? Austin,
Mr. Chairman, Senator, it is
correct for these funds is to
kind of thinking of it as these
funds are enabling current
actions of the different.
But it also allows them to draw
down the money when the other
funds have money already in them
for the same purpose.
I can't remember all the names
of them but there's so many
reforestation funds and
everything else.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator, uh, it
is correct that there is money
for its post buyer funds and at
that level. So it's really kind
of trying to atomize each of the
actions that the department is
doing.
OK.
Uh, Senator Steinborn.
Emotion for due pass of the
second by Senator Padilla who's
tired of sitting there.
We call it wrong.
We're going to the floor at at

Our our state forester is been a
little under the weather. I'm
gonna.
Well sure.
A good recovery and.
Thank you for coming here today.
It's, I know it's.
Not very convenient for you, so.
Thank you for allowing us the
opportunity to question you
today.
Thank you.
You well soon. I finally known
that I would have probably told
you not to come.
We could have zoomed you in.
So, let's do house Bill 449.
accomplice is not there.
Uh, well, who, who from LLC is
here to do that, Austin.
Or 49. Nobody from LOC to give
any support.
Um
That's is representative Herrera
here.
No
Mhm
Representative Herden, you're
here for defibrillators in high
schools.
Yeah, let's hear that.
Then we're probably gonna quit
right after that cause it's
How much is it going to cost us?
That's what we want to know.
We'll explain the bill and then
we're gonna.
Head to the floor.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair
and members of the committee,
we're before you today with uh
House Bill 54.
Um
House Education Committee
substitute for House Bill 54.
And the bill will add the
definition of automated external
defibrillator in the AED to the
emergency medication in Schools
Act and would require schools in
New Mexico to install an AED.
And Mr. Chair, with that we'll
stand for questions I have with
me today an expert from the
American Heart Association.
Would you please introduce
yourself?
Miss Chairman, members of the
committee, my name is Mahes Sipa
the American Art Association.
Thank you. Anybody in support?
Uh man, anybody in opposition?
On Zoom.
Nobody's up today.
Questions from committee
members.
We, we have questions, it's not
jump the gun here.
Senator Woods.
OK, tell me.
I was an EMT at one time.
So
Tell me exactly, Mr. Chair, and,
and uh representative.
Tell me how this thing works.
Because we put a whole lot of
electricity through someone.
So tell me how the safeguards on
this thing.
Yes, Mr. Chair, and Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, uh, I
want to share with you the
history that has taken us up to
the point where we are right
now. 2 years ago, this body uh
in.
enacted a legislation that will
required every coach and, and
uh.
In an athletic department to
understand and to utilize an
AED.
Then, uh, now you have uh passed
with the help of Senator Campos
legislation that would allow
funding to make sure that others
within a school district are
trained.
So what this piece of
legislation does it and it
embraces what is called the Safe
Schools Act, every single school
in the state of New Mexico has a
safe schools plan in terms of
how they will keep their, uh,
the school members
administration and students
safe. And so what we're doing is
adding this uh defibrillation
aspect.
Training and then the, the uh
instrument itself.
For the purposes and within a
school, in a school, I'm sorry.
Yeah, but that still didn't, how
many, how many, how much voltage
goes through this thing.
Mr.
Uh, Mr. Chairman Senator, I
think, you know, uh AEDs are
used.
When in cases of only in cases
of sudden cardiac arrest.
And you know, the AEDs will
assess if they calibrate how
much shot it needs.
So the machines will kind of
play that and then.
They, you know, the button that
so there's, there's this is
completely automatic. There's
no, there's no chance of
Anything going wrong, Mr. Chair
it's just.
Guaranteed
Mr. Chair, Senator.
I think ADs are, you know, are
proven, but right now you're
saying that the coaches are
trained.
And how many more staff members
are trained.
For that, Mr. Chair and
Representative.
So, Mr. Chair.
members of the committee,
Representative Woods, with each
school having its own safety, it
would depend upon how many
people are in a part of the
safety plan within every school.
So I don't know the number
within every school, but what we
are asking for is more than just
the coaches to be trained.
OK, so you're asking.
All right, I'll, I'll I see here
is.
But they must install. They must
train, and they must install.
And somewhere in here it tells
you how much they cost, Mister
Chair, members of the committee,
if it's not within there, the
cost of the defibrillator will
be at a minimum $1200. $200 yes.
OK. And they're mostly in the
athletic department is where
they're at.
and representative Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, that
is correct.
OK, how many of these that we've
installed so far have been used.
So Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, I'm not exactly sure
how many have been used thus far
but we did do is we passed a
group of students to call every
single school to find how many
did have uh defibrillators
installed.
And how many more we actually
need to look at. We're still
going down that list. I can tell
you that it's truly impressive
looking at the
rural schools that have had that
do have the defibrillators
installed thus far.
Uh, Centennial High School, I
can share with you, Logan High
School, Loving High School, um,
Hondo house.
In halves, so we want to make
sure that all of our schools and
personnel within and students
are safe.
These defibrillators will
It says, Mister Chair, it says
here in my FR that
The training cost alone will be.
$780,000.
Mm.
And then the equipment cost will
be
$262,000.
which Senator.
I think that this, this bill
doesn't require every
Every teacher to be trained in
CPR. What this bill does
establishes, you know, cardiac
emergency response and that plan
involves a team of people.
And
That could be incorporated into
the school safety plan, medical
plan.
And so it doesn't require
everybody to be involved in that
plan, you know, the schools have
the flexible, they want to
enroll.
You know, it could be, you know.
The security guard, you know, it
could be.
front desk, you know, secretary
or principal or a student, so
it's, it's up to the schools to
come up with that.
Cardiac emergency response.
So that, those plans will
include like who's trained, you
know, who maintaining the 80s.
Also important, making sure, you
know, the AEDs are working, you
know, the pads are changed and
the batteries are changed.
So, I mean, this is what, you
know, Imogen, you know, cardiac
emergency response. But, but I
guess.
The question is,
So there's money in.
The, uh, uh
Pit's budget to buy these
defibrillators, Mr. Cha.
And representative
I mean, Mr. Chairman, Senator, I
think uh we, we're working with
Senator Campos on.
Senate Bill 494 that allocates,
you know, $150,000 and so
initially the, the layout, the
implementation plan is in the
fiscal year 207 and 2027 and 28.
I'm, I'm sorry, 26 and 27.
The implementation will be only
on
high schools, publicized charter
schools.
And in the fiscal year 27 and 28
will be implementing in each the
cost of each uh 8Ds is like
range, you know, 2000.
OK.
Thank you very much for
answering my question.
Send the line.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um, good afternoon. Uh,
So I'm a retired school teacher.
I was a coach, so I'm certified
to zap somebody, so we called
it.
My, my question is though, and,
and I had this question when,
when I was still teaching.
If
If I go to use this device.
And something goes wrong.
What cover do would I as an
employee have?
Um, let's say the individual
didn't make it. Is there any
legal thing that they could take
back on?
the chair members of the
committee, Senator Lanier.
What happens is each one of the
schools with the insurance plan,
with the insurance, as long as
there is a plan, a safety plan
in place, there is limited
liability.
OK. And Mr. Chair, is so
That that expense would fall on
the school itself.
Oh
Mr. Chair, uh, Senator, you
know, uh, New Mexico has.
What is called the Good
Samaritan law.
So when when you are trying to
save somebody.
You know, that, that, that the
Good Samaritan law protects, you
know.
That's
And, and really I
You look in the FR on page on
what page that is. It's the
last.
with FYR.
That
protects.
Um
Anybody else, but not.
Does not fully cover the school.
That's what it says.
The New Mexico cardiac arrest
response offers broad immunity.
Schools and staff as well, but I
don't know what offers and what
movie is.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. My, my
real question is an incident
that did happen at my school and
I don't really want to say it
out loud, but I will, I guess.
I we had it installed and
Somebody went
By and picked it up.
And thought it was a good idea
to take it into the locker room
shower.
And
Zap the water to see what it
would happen. So that's the
liability that I'm really
talking about, not, not when
you're really trying to save
somebody's life, but no one was
hurt. I assure you no one was
hurt, but.
It, uh, definitely got a lot of
people's attention.
When we, when we found out about
it. Thank God we have telephones
so we could watch it all.
But anyway, um, so that, that's
kind of my question.
Would that be covered under the
same thing, so you're not trying
to save somebody's life and
I mean, it is a school and we do
have kids in there and they're
pretty brave.
Mr. Chairman, Senator, I think
you know.
Mm
I mean, this has been
implemented in several states
throughout the country.
When, when you have a
team that's responsible, I
think.
You haven't
Sure.
Alright, and Mr. Chair, and uh
I don't know if you've noticed,
but Taco Bell's been the hot
topic here today.
We do have them installed in
every one of our stores.
And they are very easy to use
and you should not be scared of
them.
And uh
Thank, thank goodness we haven't
had to use one yet, but.
But they are there and our
employees are trained.
Use them. So, so thank you for
bringing this.
They have a heart attack special
at Taco Bell.
I
I
Senator Tru Hill, what about the
atomic sauce, Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Representative for being
here and presenting this bill. I
too agree this is a really
important, um, uh.
Really important tool that we
need to have in all places here
at the Roundhouse.
Um, I believe that these
defibrillators are battery
operated, correct?
Mr. Chair, uh, Senator, yes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Representative, and so and you
notice on um.
Number 5 under the new material
section 3A5. It does say that
the plan has to provide for
routine maintenance of the
automated external
defibrillator, and I'm assuming
that that means recharging or
replacing of the batteries,
correct?
Mm
Mr. Chair, Senator, I think it,
it requires changing the
batteries, changing the pads,
and you know, the one of the
things is is.
You know, you, you have a law.
And that log will have like oh.
You know, replaced it when it
was replaced. Thank you Mr.
Chair. Thank you,
Representatives. So I just wanna
This year, just real quickly,
what has happened.
At state buildings, and maybe
not all state buildings, but
definitely in the state. The
plan was created and it was put
where most plans go.
On a shelf.
And nobody
That was there years later.
had any recollection of a plan
or any recollection of when
defibrillators dated and
maintained.
And so I wish that there had
been some language in here
directing NESA, which is the New
Mexico Public Insurance
Authority, public schools
Insurance Authority to send out
a reminder, you might remember
we used to hear when we changed
our clocks, right? Time to
change your batteries, time to
change. I don't know. I don't,
that doesn't seem to be a real
big campaign that we have and
maybe it's because many fire
alarms and such are, are hooked
into the wire.
in our homes, but I wish that
there was something in here that
directed NEMSI to send out a
reminder.
So that even if the person who
created the plan or it's been
passed on to or whoever was in
charge of it, even if 3
generations later, and I don't
mean generations by generation,
I mean, 3 people later, which
could be less than 5 years.
Somebody knows that this needs
to be taken care of.
Not going to try to amend the
bill, but I do wish that there
was something in there that
required.
Constant, um, messages to the
schools at a certain time of the
year to tell them it's time to
check your defibrillators. Thank
you, Mr. Chair. I'm sponsor.
I, I know a little.
about this world, actually one
of our prior clients many years
ago owns a company that sells
AEDs. So I know that the average
AED, I think the batteries last
2 to 5 years. I think the
average unit, the estimated life
span is 8 to 10 years, so
Or is this going out to RFP
where it will be one company
that you buy.
The AEDs for for all the schools
in New Mexico and then will it
also include a maintenance
program and maybe even the plan
that that company executes, that
company follows up with the
schools and changes all the
batteries because I can see this
as an administrative nightmare
because people are gonna forget.
Um, things aren't going to get
done, and if it went out in RFP
to one company that could help
the maintenance and oversee all
of that. To me, that would be
the most efficient way to make
sure it's done properly and
maybe a couple times a year off
for training, etc.
Is that included in this, or?
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, representative, I'm,
I'm sorry, Senator Tobison.
One of the things we didn't talk
about in here was exactly how
the AEDs were gonna be
purchased. We did not know if
PED wanted to allocate the money
to the schools so they could
either go out and purchase them
directly, which would not
Uh we require an RFP or if uh.
ED was gonna do it themselves.
And we can still make that
recommendation to them. I think
your recommendation is a very
good one.
And that is still something that
could happen, but those very uh
intimate details. We didn't
include in the legislation. OK,
and, and Mr. Chair, I, I'd
recommend maybe putting that in
there because it's way more cost
effective to send this out to
bid and an average price of
$1200 is rather high. That's if
you and I jumped on Amazon and
tried to buy one, but as a
state, if we went collectively
and bought, I don't know how
many units we're talking about,
but I'm sure it's substantial. I
know the
price would be a lot lower.
Um
For PED. So I would think that
maybe everything you're needing
to keep this going and going
well, to be incorporated in that
RFP and then you're one and
done. Everyone's saved money and
people are trained and the AEDs
are maintained properly. So
just, just a suggestion, I think
it would be.
Effective. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Center.
Uh, movie Duques.
Um, one quick question before we
do that.
I, I mean, the liability this
portion in NIMSA.
They're probably gonna look at
us and say, well, do they have
this set up right? and what's
the liability?
If a school teacher, cause it
doesn't take covers, it exempts.
Any staff in the school.
says it it good Samaritan law
protects individuals but may not
fully cover their schools.
New Mexico cardiac arrest.
Cardiac arrest response Act
offers broad immunity to school
and staff.
But it doesn't see what that is.
What if it's
Someone that's
Not a staff member.
That's came the basketball game
in.
And then all of a sudden.
It's one of these out and
somebody has a heart attack and
gives it to him. I mean, they're
liable under that.
Law, I mean
So can you explain those two
laws to me.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, uh, Senator Munoz,
when I was researching the
concept of what is going to be
the liability.
What I did find is that if
schools had a plan, a safety
plan for utilizing instruments
like a defibrillator. It did
limit liability.
And so one of the things that um
I thought of as we discussed
this process is that what was
important here is the safety of
the people who are gonna be at
the school.
And the fact that there was a
safety plan in place and that
there were people who were going
to be trained on utilizing these
um defibrillators more than one
person.
So in terms of liability, I
think liability is going to
exist no matter what you do, but
what we're looking at is saving
lives and safety within schools
and uh based upon the
The history of the legal.
aspects of what happens when
there's a safety plan in place.
I think schools are adequately
protected.
So, let me ask you some
questions. Do we have one in the
Capitol right now?
Uh, Mr. Mr. Chair, um, I do not
know, I did not look at that
because that was beyond the
scope of my chair. I've seen one
here.
That
And we're over 20 some years old
and older.
We don't even know where it's
located. Some of us have seen
it, but we don't know where we
saw it.
Or how to use it.
I mean, how is this going to
play out in the school, right?
Kids are gonna be kids like
center Lani, I can tell you a
story about a fire, but you
don't want to hear that one.
And kids are gonna be kids, but
when they need them, they need
them.
But how are they gonna know
where they're located, how
they're gonna say, oh,
somebody's got to run to.
The principles, assistant
principal's office and it's
under the secretary's desk and
I mean that's
That's a life saving things I
think we're talking about.
We, we all want these one by
every door, but it ain't gonna
happen.
If there's one in the school.
I mean, you know how long it
takes someone to run.
I know they have them on the
athletic fields when they're.
practice and during games.
And they also have medics there,
but I mean.
The liability is the big
question for me and and
So we can explain that.
I take representative Her into
the state basketball tournament
last night, and she has a heart
attack and I.
with the
Yeah, who's liable if she passes
away and.
The trial lawyers are gonna have
it.
7 a.m. TV ad, you got killed by
a defibrillator.
We're here to help.
Um
Mr. Chair, um.
I, I do think that it's
important courts to look at the
totality of the circumstances
and what's happened and are you,
what's being um utilized in the
circumstances with the, the
event occurs, so.
I don't
not put the defibrillators in
there.
Um
I hope that you will consider
some of the questions we have a
do pass motion from Senator Ne
second by Senator Trujil.
The cholera, and we're gonna
germ right after this cause it's
one o'clock.
