Chairman representative are you
there.
We sure are Senators.
Do we need to go to public
comment are you guys ready to
wrap this grow up no we're ready
Senator at your disposal what
will we stand for questions
okay.
We do have an amendment Senator
Candelaria amendment for the
bill yes Mr chairman and members
of the committee and sponsors
good morning.
I have an amendment that I'm
gonna propose it was the final
version was sent out this
morning by staff.
And the two oh two number of the
amendment to which I will be
referring Mr chairman members is
point two two zero eight two one
point two.
Mr chairman so I would move the
Senate finance committee
amendment number one to house
Education Committee substitute
for House joint resolution one
for purposes of discussion.
Second on the amendment.
I'm gonna second discussion Mr
chairman I haven't seen the
final moment a look at it on the
screen now thank you.
Thank you senator and thank you
Mr chairman.
So the amendment I am proposing
does a couple important things
before this question goes to the
voters and Mr chairman you've
provided extensive opportunity
not only on this bill but
certainly on house bill two.
for discussion public vetting
input.
On this measure and as a member
of this committee I've really
never seen us
do so much of all of these
prostheses in the public.
and so I think this committee is
to be commended for that.
so here's what the amendment us
as we discussed at the last
meeting Mr chairman in light of.
Martinez Biasi as well as the
other.
Lawsuit that is now challenging
the constitutionality of our.
public school I capital outlay
system.
This can someone else turn off
their Mike please I'm getting a
lot of feedback and it's hard to
follow my own thoughts thank
you.
What this legislation what this
measure does is it a questions
Mister president and permits an
additional one percent
distribution from the land grant
permanent fund.
However thirty eight then
proceeds to apportion that
distribution.
Between both the K. twelve
system and the early education
system on page three.
paragraph twenty three of the
amendment.
I think is the relevant section
part.
It provides that thirty five
percent of this additional
distribution.
I'll be for the public school
permanent fund beneficiary which
is our common schools for the
following purposes enhanced
instruction for at risk students
our students at risk of failure
that is directly the issue we
are facing in this state.
number two extending the school
year as we know making up for
the learning losses of COVID
nineteen is going to be a
significant challenge in our
state it doesn't mean you.
Something went wrong here.
Your money's there Mike's muted.
Thank you.
Here yes now Senator Rodriguez
can you make your might.
Yes yes and now it's not muted
Senator.
We use your might your.
When we get.
So.
Sixty five percent of the
additional distribution Mr
chairman with then go for the
provision of early childhood
education.
What's important in subsection
H. is that the additional
distribution to both early
childhood and the additional
distribution to the COVID
schools would be subject to
legislative appropriation or as
provided by law.
The.
Senator Candelaria there.
I'm here I I get the I just need
everyone zoom master and
everyone to leave my zoom
account alone.
And stop meeting may and I just
really respectfully ask everyone
else to mute themselves it's not
that are.
So.
So the second important piece of
this Mr chairman.
Is it will
Require congressional approval
for distribution or for the
enhanced distributions early
childhood education.
As was discussed at the last
meeting in part through
questioning by Senator what's.
Where I am I'm firmly of the
opinion that we are in fact
creating a new beneficiary and
now the argument has been.
Well the state can just decide
what constitutes a common school
and us we can determine you know
the early childhood education is
a common school but there's a
few problems right and the
number one we have a standalone
departments that is not PED that
manages early childhood
education.
Some of the services for and
with the education are in PDD
but many of the more knocks and
we and and there's been strong
debate this session to.
To make sure that we do not
quote unquote sort of you know
kill or four star Val the
private providers who
can't hear you.
Mr Chairman can you hear me
I can hear you.
Make and in center this her mind
is going in and out I looked at
the connection problem or what
Senator Rodriguez tried we
logging and reconnecting.
Trying let's keep going
the junior Mike.
And then we'll just keep an eye
on and make sure she raised her
hand.
So Mister chairman.
Going on
The.
What the issue is this.
Besides all the structural
challenges for defining early
education is a common school.
If you if we go back to the
Ferguson and enabling act
they're sort of the million
dollar question that's never
been answered in the ten years
this concept has been floating
around.
And that's why ultimately I
believe Congress must be
involved.
If you read the Ferguson Act on
the enabling act Congress
designates particular and
specific tracts of land for the
benefit of the existing
beneficiaries so for example and
and not all of those tracts of
land are worse or produce the
same amount of money.
In fact there is wild variation
in how much the tracts of land
that were granted by Congress to
the beneficiaries of the funds.
Actually receipt how valuable
that land so for example Mr Mr
Chairman the land that the
Congress appropriated or
a lot it through the common
schools and to New Mexico
military institute down in
southeastern New Mexico
is worth a lot more than the
tracts of land that Congress
allocated to the common schools
and to the boys reformatory
school or when I was growing up
we called it Springer or the B.
Hall.
That so that so so ultimately Mr
chairman even if we were to have
the authority.
To.
To siphon off a portion of the
probation map for the common
schools to early education.
We do not just as a state
legislature do not has a state
legislature regardless of how
sympathetic I am of the view of
states rights.
I'm also an attorney who took an
oath to the law and what the law
says that only Congress can re
appropriate those tracts of
land.
I'm sitting here today I think
it's going to be a question for
the voters to discuss.
Is will Congress has to re
appropriate re allocate
reshuffle
those tracts of land and then
the question becomes Mr chairman
well which of the existing
beneficiaries is going to lose
tracks of land.
And that's been I think the the
the discussed and on hidden
complicate and hidden
complication of this proposal
for decades.
So what the legislation does is
it simply states that the
increased distribution for early
education would only go into
effect on congressional.
Thank from the testimony we've
heard.
To this point Mr chairman.
It it doesn't seem like getting
congressional approval is going
to be that onerous when possible
of the task these the last
major.
Revision that the amendments
contemplates is that paragraph
twenty two.
Paragraph twenty two.
Would
Impose or put in place a guard
rail and stand up emergency
safety valves.
Providing that if the fund five
year rolling average were to
ever go below seventeen billion
dollars the additional one
percent distribution
contemplated by this ammendment.
Would stop.
It would then go on and turn on
at any time to fund one about
seventeen billion now I will say
Mr chairman I do think this
provision is sort of a
I'm I would analogize it to an
umbrella insurance coverage it's
very unlikely I I would say that
we are going to ever see the
funds go below seventeen
billion.
Given its current value given
market trends and just given
that it based upon the research
I've done of the country's
largest endowment funds.
There are there it there's never
been a sustained decline in the
double digits that is permanent.
In terms of percentage of the
fund's value and that's what
would have to happen in light of
this ammendment for us to fall
below seventeen billion okay.
So those are what that's what
the amendment does I think Mr
chairman this ammendment.
sense to the voters a question a
very important question.
Dedicating in our constitution a
permanent sustainable
meaningful.
Permanent source of revenue to
support early childhood
education.
This I believe accomplishes the
goals of the Sanchez.
If one percent generates about a
hundred and seventy million
dollars a year.
Point six five percent of that
is going to generate about a
hundred and ten million per
year.
So Mister chairman hi with that
I A. submit this amendment to
the committee thank you.
Question from committee members
on the amendment.
Senator share.
Thank you Mr chair.
Trying to sort out through this
amendment which.
Trying to read
so I know that the the thirty
five percent is going to PED
thirty five percent of the new
money is going to PED R. sixty
five percent of the money is
going to early education is it
going to the early education
department or is it going to
where's where's that new money
for early education going Mr so
really good question Mister
chairman Senator sure under this
proposal
the the distribution.
Isn't Sixtyeight is for a
beneficiary rights for early
education but it does not go to
the Department we are not naming
the early education department.
The early education department.
As the beneficiary and and the
challenge that I've had with
that Mr Chairman is that.
Is that.
It kind of cuts the legislature
out of the equation right
because now the
The the department
basically is guaranteed the
money and can do with that as
well.
The amendment before you does is
it states that the additional
distribution for early childhood
education as well as provided by
law.
What that means Mr chairman is
that this legislature will
appropriate and get to determine
how.
These early education dollars
are spent which I think is
critical and here's the reason I
think that's critical Mr
Chairman I believe in the
testimony on this on this
measure that was presented to
the committee originally.
When understanding here that
there's really no way that the
system could spend a hundred and
seventy and I I I don't think
they'll be able to spend a
hundred and ten million dollars
any time soon because in part
the large amount of federal
money that's coming into the
state.
We now have a trust fund that we
set up with three hundred and
twenty million dollars.
That is going to generate
revenue for this fund.
Sh.
Why that's important is Mr
chairman what the legislature
can do once this money starts to
wrap it up as the legislature
could certainly appropriate some
of the money of the hundred and
ten to the program which would
then be accessible to the early
childhood education department
ordered PED right for both
private and public service
delivery but the legislature
certainly could appropriate
another portion of that hundred
ten million into the early
education trust fund.
So that it can continue to grow
and generate interest and create
a truly perpetual source of
revenue for the fund and I think
that's a better option for us in
the future Mr chairman.
because.
Because
Because we need to
We we need to basically make
sure that the money goes in the
right place now Mr chairman
Yes withdraw this ammendment.
you Senator coach.
I'm just gonna withdraw this I
I think that there are still
some discussion that I'm
understanding that I was just
not made privy to.
about about the distribution
amount and I'd rather just get
this right rather than.
rather than this rather than
just taking a vote on this
amendment at this time so Mr
Chairman I'm gonna turn it back
to you.
Yes.
Thank you we're back on the bill
Senator what.
I guess I have a question or
process Mr Chairman.
The question I have is it is I
was going to speak on the
amendment are are we expecting
another amendment or or where
are we at.
Senator what is that if you were
watching he withdrew the
amendment so we are back on.
So are we going to get in
another amendment shortly to
talk about our are we just going
to.
Go on with the bill as
presented.
Senator what we're on the bill
you have questions about the
bill.
Yeah question about the bill the
same question that the Senator
Candelaria brought up that
You know which beneficiary we
gonna take this money from.
You know I think
you with my assist you want to
answer that question yes thank
you Mr chairman thank you
Senator Woods
we're taking it from the from
the account because is currently
not being spent but it would be
a portion of the COVID schools
or the common school account so
it would be a one percent from
the COVID schools portion of the
distribution
so would you would come out of
the COVID schools account.
So.
Mr Chairman so you're not
talking about of land you're
just talking about a general
account without talking about
we're going to change the
distribution from certain lands
as the way this is set up in in
the constitution to deliver
certain land revenues to
certain.
Ben Fisher age we're going to
say well we're going to set up
another beneficiary but we're
just gonna set it as a sub sub
topic of public get is that we
understand it it is Mr chairman
Senator was once again I don't
believe we're setting up a new
beneficiary but that's.
That's for a the US attorney to
decide but we're not
redistributing tracts of land
were not affecting any other
beneficiaries in any other way
it would merely be a percentage
of the land and the wealth of
accumulated by that land to the
common schools so there would be
no reallocation of tracts of
land it would merely be a
percentage this would be one
percent annually from the up
eighty six percent of the fund
which is which is currently
earmarked for the common schools
so would be five percent to K.
to twelve one percent to early
at.
But it would be done by
actual actual solution reach
thank you Mr chairman.
What are Representative I do
have an amendment do you guys do
wants that amendment on or not.
Yes Mr Chairman would like to
would like to debate the
amendment I would like the
committee to consider the
amendment.
so this is your amendment.
Representative my mask this I'm
sorry I'm sorry yes
I understand that some if.
If the committee in I'm sorry
you are bitter presented.
We need to drive for discussion
purposes first I'm just checking
to all the amendments that have.
Everywhere for bills.
So you want to present that
amendment or not it's not
appropriate unless the committee
adopts an amendment is not
appropriate to this to add at
this right now but if the
committee does adopt an
amendment allocate indicates a
call that may it may become
relevant here.
Yes.
Readers can read this is meant
for discussion purposes and
changes election.
Mr Chairman my understanding is
that this amendment is not
applicables on less it it other
amendments the amendment was
discussed or others are proved
so if it's not applicables then
we won't presented at this time
it doesn't seem like it from
what I understand from
Representative Maestas.
Okay we're back on the bill will
we're we're getting some
clarification Senator Campos.
And.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
members of the US Senate finance
committee and of course Sanchez
I truly appreciate your ongoing
diligence in terms of.
Not only.
Your strong concern for the
future future of our children
but also how we're going to the
if you will the constitutional
amendment.
How we're gonna make this as
presentable as possible and
clear as possible to the general
public.
A few questions that I have in.
I believe that we've gone back
and forth in terms of.
What the language should be what
the percentages would be.
And so what I'm going to do is
just go back to the very basics.
If early childhood education.
We were to take one percent.
And according to numbers.
It would generate two hundred
seventy million.
And those resources do not have
to be used immediately.
If the voters approved a
constitutional amendment.
If the resources start to
generate.
There are three things that are
an essential.
Of course the focus and the
strategy is to how we're going
to provide the services to our
children.
And their families.
The second would be how we
incrementally.
Utilize the resources that would
be available so that within and
it would be an efficient
operation it's not going to be
one we're just because we have
the resources that we apply
those resources.
And we have.
Too much money if you will to
get out there so quickly that we
don't do a good job of doing
that.
And then thirdly.
How we are going to measure the
outcomes for the future
generation in the outcomes being
that we know all.
From prenatal all the way
through that our young people
definitely deserve the best
education home visitation and
services possible for the start.
So my first question is and
we've already gone through some
of this so it may be repetitive.
But for clarity purposes and I
want the general public to
understand as we move forward
how essential these resources
are to build the future for New
Mexico.
Sanchez if you will help me to
better understand.
If we were to generate the
resources and I'm gonna get into
the beneficiaries of the things
in a minute.
But if we were to generate the
resources.
Number one what is the plan.
In order to provide the
education or are you.
And then number two how do we
measure that plant and I realize
that that could be separate from
the question is before us but I
believe it's important for us to
understand them thank you Mr
chairman thank you sponsors and
members of the Senate finance
committee.
Thank you Mr chair and that
request us if you don't mind I
can I can jump in very quickly I
think over the years we've
created an incredible plan from
pre K. to home visitation to
child care assistance and
everything in between to the
creation of the department that
subject against Moquino heads
and she's on this call as well
and and please jump in secretary
we've got the valuation metrics
already in statute we've got
things like the whole visitation
act the pre K. at we've got
different quality metrics in
vetted throughout the system I
think as a result of the good
work of this legislature and the
last two governors including
my **** and now Michelle Lujan
Grisham up we've built that
system what we now need is a
substantive permanent funding
source and Mr chair Senator
Campos you know just to give you
sort of a one line response to
that.
Very good general question
we are investing a portion of
this beautiful land grant
permanent fund.
That is that twenty two billion
dollars into the most precious
recession proof investment we
can make children are recession
proof.
One hundred percent recession
proof and for every dollar we
invest there's a thirteen
percent return on that
investment in many many
different fashions in ways
incarceration rates are there
they're ready for education was
to go into the K. twelve system
graduation rates you know the
tax base folks not on social
welfare programs folks not you
know dealing with drug use
disorders it really is a smart
smart investment and the metrics
are already in law you US this
legislature has built that
system over the last ten years
and we should feel very proud of
that because now that system is
ready for this big investment.
Thank you very much tied in
directly Mr chairman of course
members of the Senate finance
committee and honorable Sanchez
of this this particular
constitutional amendment.
The one of the big concerns
deals directly with the
permanent fund.
And from there the investment
and the resources that.
Are returned if you will to the
general fund and how that corpus
if you will has been significant
and it's been strong over the
years in order for us to go
ahead and provide resources for
early childhood education and
for education and other services
through our general fund.
Part of that question then
becomes.
If we are to adopt this voters
are to pass this.
What then happens if you will to
the corpus and the investments
that are being made as an
example by SI see in those
returns if you will to our.
Our own general coffers.
What happens are we able then to
utilize these resources and what
they do is they take over if you
will.
Area central component which is
early childhood education and
and if we adopt of a full
fledged.
Amendment and we also move and
if you will to
I would just say Hey I K. twelve
then.
How do we continue to insurance
is already been mentioned that
we have the perpetual.
On going resources coming in how
do we set this up how are we
going to deal and in develop it
in such a way so that we get the
best bang for our dollar in
order to educate children
because one of the big
contentious issues continues to
be.
We already have.
Place it's already working and
our indication is this is going
to give us more resources.
A much more stable of the state
general fund.
And then as we move forward or
educational components are going
to be able to be better plan for
the long term.
That's part of the question in
terms of how do we sort this out
so that people understand that
the resources that are going
directly in to fund education
are going to be most effectively
used if this particular
amendment is to be a this to be
a doctor if you will this
constitution to our goes forward
thank you Mr chair.
Thank you Mr chairman Senator
Campos and that's the the wisdom
of of this committee the
secretary of early add this
governor future governors those
metrics that Representative
Martinez spoke about
and and you know LFC staff there
they're all in place and they
can only get better.
This would do would would allow
the appropriators the vast
resources to build out this
system as responsibly as quickly
as humanly possible there would
be no financial constraints are
once the voters approved this
this constitution amendment the
best part is is that we don't
have to spend the money and I
think this gets to your question
if the voters allocate one
hundred seventy million dollars
annually to early educational
programs.
I don't think we can build out
that quickly in one year so if
we build out say for example
thirty million dollars a year.
We allocate next year thirty
million dollars one hundred
forty million dollars earmarked
for early patient remains.
It.
Remains of the.
Apologies and then the next year
we we spend sixty million
dollars and that one hundred and
twenty million that we don't
spend remains in the account so
within twenty two years they'll
be two hundred fifty million
dollars in addition to the
hundred seventy million dollars
annually so by the time we build
out this system which will be
upwards of a half a billion
dollars a year.
there will be air marked money
collecting interest annually and
so we will never ever have to
cut programs even in the worst
economic times and then a prior
in about a decade or so Mister
chairman Senator Campos
even though I don't believe the
one percent will fully fund the
system it will be at the vast
majority of that allocation but
but this is merely
Allowing us to take money from
the savings account to the
checking account from the from
the land grant permanent fund
investment account to the
general fund that money that we
don't transfer and spend remains
in the investment account but
that money that we do transfer
and spend will have the quality
control metrics that that we've
put in place over the past ten
years.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
again members of the committee
and sponsors and thank you for
your intelligence as we move
forward.
There are still two or three
things that are very pressing to
me number one The New Mexico
needs which is over four hundred
million dollars.
The second issue is that the.
Working at this grant.
We don't have the full
consistency to provide.
The educational services across
the board.
For New Mexico.
Third issue going forward is
that in the planning we're
talking about.
EAS are educational assistance
teachers we're talking about
strong educational programs
across the board.
In rural New Mexico as well as
the European parts of our state
we have all of these components
that are out there in each year
depending on if you will the
recession depending on the drop
in resources we continue to make
those adjustments and so our
faculty or parents or students.
Their health if you will to a
system of what resources we have
available.
But yet we continue to go ahead
and be at the bottom of all of
the good lists when it comes to
education.
And so within this movement
within this particular vision
that you all have established.
Help me to better understand the
consistency the stability the
effectiveness in the future
because what you all want to
leave for the future of our
children is a basis for their
education so that they can not
only get into the world we're.
But so it's going to be
considered equal so the same
thing will happen in maybe the
community of Clovis as the
community of farming in the
community of Las Vegas the
community level after.
The whole issue is this is about
the future of our state and so I
I I'm I'm imploring you all to
consider that stability and I'm
not talking directly to the
Sanchez I'm talking to the to
the global
community out there that's
listening because if we don't do
something now for education.
For five years down the road
we're going to continue to deal
with this as an educator I
continue to deal directly with
the issue of unstable miss
tradition for lack there
our young people as they have
high hopes and opportunities and
so my question again to the
sponsors will be.
How do you anticipate with all
of the components that are out
there now how do we bring these
together and ensure that their
strong collaboration in that
there will be an efficient.
Educational program and strategy
so that our young people are
going to be the strongest
beneficiaries of this plan in
the future please help me better
understand that thank you Mr
chairman members of the Senate
finance committee.
Mr Mr chair and senator
My says I was gonna quickly
quickly talk about the the
importance of of our mixed
delivery system and and you know
the good work that's a good
figure against is been doing to
make sure that the services end
up in every corner of the state
every single corner of the state
run by public and private actors
and I think that's important to
note but in terms of the
sustainability of the of the
frontier and sort of the long
term all all all pass it on to
Representative Maestas.
Well thank you Mr Chairman is
Martinez from Santo comes what a
beautiful question we could talk
for days on this but it briefly
we are you know LFC reports talk
about how much money will come
out of the fund and the comp the
the the beauty of compound
interest well there's also the
compound interest as it relates
to human capital and that was
articulated the in the U. N. M.
economic study at your half ago
and like Representative Martinez
said.
A dedication is recession proof.
When COVID hit the fund lost one
point eight billion dollars in
two months that will never
happened by investing in
education and so we have
generational curses of your
domestic violence substance
abuse things that nature that we
will have now compound interest
when it comes to families
children who are healthier
become healthier parents raise
healthier children and we can
overcome this the cycle of
poverty that's in trap many of
our families and communities for
decades and so when a child
receives quality early childhood
education it plays out in their
educational career in high
school higher graduation rates
in high school more susceptible
to a college education higher
income throughout the course of
their life larger tax base for
New Mexico more students staying
home
and and health indicators as
well Mister chairman Senator
Campos one of the studies we've
read is that the health outcomes
of the students at age thirty
five far exceeded their there
appears that did not have the
the opportunity for these
programs so so you know this
just give us the resources we
have the Human we have the human
ability to do this Arizona is
confident in itself it went to
six point nine we need to be
confident in ourselves to spend
wisely at six percent or more.
Thank you very much and I'm just
conclude with the remark I
applaud you for the ongoing
diligence into all of the
advocates is the the this
forward.
It goes back to the brilliance
of our minds are population and
we continue to.
Thank you created in the in the
stronger water future can be and
the only way for a stronger.
State is to ensure that the
brilliance is is is developed.
And the only way to do that is
to ensure that is here the
resources are there.
The young people are given the
opportunity to learn to aspire
to be the best that they can be
and it goes back to your remark
on human capital.
If we do not give our young
people the opportunity to set
goals and to have a whole.
In the be fully prepared for
their future in essence what
we're doing is we're indicating
you have all the money in the
world but the bottom line is
what you've done is you've
diffuse the human spirit.
The human ability and what we
really need to do is to ensure
that that is going to be at the
forefront of everything that we
consider not only with this and
then when it comes to education.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
thank you very much members of
the Senate finance committee
into the Sanchez I really
applaud your ongoing diligence
thank you Sir.
We do have another amendment we
go straight Center can there in
yes Mr chairman.
Seven one oh two yes Mr chairman
so I will move in again this man
was also sent out to the
committee this morning.
I'm sure believed the Sanchez
the two oh two number Mr
chairman is to to seven one zero
point two and I would move that
amendment for purposes of
discussion.
Thank you.
Thank you thank you Mr chairman
members of the committee the
amendment before you
Does everything I was cussing
earlier this morning however the
distribution the increased
distribution from the land grant
permanent fund you will find at
paragraph sixteen.
the main difference between this
amendment to the one I proposed
earlier is this amendment would
set the additional distribution
from the land grant permanent
fund out one point two five
percent of the average of the
year and market value of the
permanent school fund for the
immediately preceding five
calendar years so this amendment
would set the increased
distribution at one point two
five percent if you go down to
page three at paragraph twenty
three the amendment further
provides that of that additional
one point two five percent forty
percent of that.
Amount would go to the common
school.
Fund it doesn't go to PED it
goes to the common school fund
which is then basically the
appropriations accounts for the
state equalization guarantee.
Secondly sixty percent.
Of the additional one point two
five.
Distribution shall be for the
provision of early childhood
education as provided by law and
as appropriated by the
legislature thank you Mr
chairman.
Questions on the amendment.
Senator Gonzales you have
questions.
Yes.
All.
Thank you and thank you to the
senator Candelaria on.
You know well before the
amendment was percent at the end
I was going to bring up
something like this but just a
real quick question to Senator.
So within the sixty percent that
would equate to approximately
how much.
Forty seven and do some math Mr
chairman so if one percent is a
hundred and seventy million
okay.
So I believe point two five
percent would be equivalent to
about forty two million dollars.
So if we add that to the base
this proposal would generate
about a hundred and seventy one
million dollars a year and staff
can correct me if I'm wrong this
is a lawyer attempted to do mass
which quite didn't become a
scientist.
But if we assume a hundred
seventy one million Mister
chairman Senator Gonzales is the
at the point one to one point
two five percent.
Sixty percent of that would be.
Hundred and.
Hundred and three million
dollars a year.
Thereabouts.
Yes that's fine you know I'll
work it out also
Mr chairman and Senator
Candelaria I'd like to call I
like to amendment and I likes
the sure that part of the
seventeen billion in us to
safeguard.
The I also feel that will.
Mr chairman and the and senator
Candelaria and with everyone
that's listening I really feel
that as far as so.
The categorical part of the
beneficiary part will sort out
itself you know even you know as
we go through this the the I
really like your own bed bound
and you know I would support it
thank you.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
senator.
Thank you Senator Rodriguez
thank you Mr chairman thank you
senator Candelaria you know what
of the my question has been
answered now that Senator
Gonzales asked you have to do
with the seventeen years that
threshold that would
Yet nor the seventeen million
I'm sorry that would be treated
that would if that amount that
would trigger the suspension is
because the low the seventeen
million so you billion.
In my mandated thank you no
worries.
A lot of money yeah yeah but
overall if I understand this
correctly let me just reiterate
it it's one point two five
percent instead of one percent
would be in the same.
And wrecked would be sixty
percent of the one point two
five nine of the one percent of
the one point two I would go to
early childhood education and
forty percent would go to public
schools but to the common school
public Fund so I'm in essence
that would be installed yes I'm
going to Senator if I'm wrong
but it seems to me that in
essence instead of being the one
person the one hundred percent
of the one percent.
Early childhood it is sixty
percent however which is
increased by another
but we're increasing the whole
amount by another quarter
percent which is point two five.
To help pick up the additional
loss from the one hundred
percent down to the sixty
percent the early childhood
would still takes.
The.
And on the map yet Mr chairman
and senator on your point I
thank you for bringing this
information out because I think
it's important to lay out I'm
getting better numbers from our
staff and put I think the
professionals to be trusted the
calculators and not meet
the total distribution Mr
chairman and senator ridge Rigas
out one point two five would
equal approximately two hundred
and twelve million per year
roughly one hundred and twenty
seven million dollars that would
be available for early childhood
and eighty four million would be
available to the common schools
for the purposes I discussed
which is number one teacher
compensation number two helping
our kids who are most at risk of
failure and number three
extending the school year and
what I would share Mr chairman
and senator which we guess is.
The budget that we see in early
childhood needs to be sustained
throughout a child's entire
lights and in conversations with
our LFC staff it's just very
clear to me that if we do not.
Expand the at risk services in
K. twelve if we do not extend
the school year if we do not
make those investments in K.
twelve we do not see the
benefits of early childhood
sustained so I think today what
I'm proposing is.
We kind of re we re re imagine
this ammendment as the childhood
amendment.
You know not early childhood not
fitting K. twelve against early
at early at against anybody else
but sending to the voters very
simple question.
Shall we invest in additional
one point two five percent in
the children of New Mexico.
Because they need those services
Mr chairman and senator retreat
yes yes from beginning in early
childhood but we can't forget
about them in kindergarten we
can't forget about them in
elementary we can't forget about
them in middle school that we
never seem to talk about middle
school and if we actually looked
at the drop out rates in middle
school it's actually kind of
terrifying
and then we have to care about
them in high school and then we
have to care about them and in
college or community college so.
You know we need to be fair Mr
Chairman and you know making
available on a permanent basis
an additional hundred and twenty
seven million to start for early
at that is an incredibly
substantial investment.
Thank you Senator Candelaria for
that explanation and the rest of
your amendment remains intact
which you had explained from the
fact from the prior one correct
that this would go it's still
would have to go for a
congressional approval
for the audit for the early
childhood part which is likely
creating and beneficiary Mister
chairman Senator Rodriguez yes
and and as I shared in the
opening my my the reason is I
believe only Congress is going
to have the ability to re
shuffle for a man to the
congressional acts which
currently designate tracts of
land for common schools in for
all the other public
institutions
it's going to need to be
Congress in collaboration with
our state government to
understand and to lay out how
those tracts of land are
reshuffled in an equitable
fashion that doesn't harm the
existing beneficiaries but still
can achieve the aims of the cell
number.
Thank you thank you for that
explanation Senator and I I like
this ammendment also and I'm
happy that you brought up the
the other beneficiaries because
that is most important here is
that as we.
I have fun other areas that we
make sure that the other
beneficiaries including the
special schools that are
established under the
constitution do not have a
negative impact by virtue of us
doing something like this and my
understanding from all my
research and what I have been
discussed in several meetings
also with our education staff
and so on it seems like we're
gonna be okay and so I wanted to
just say thank you for bringing
that up and and thinking about
the other beneficiaries we don't
want unintended consequences
here.
That this is huge and we also
want to make sure that whatever
we do when we send it to the
voters if we do pass this
resolution and I hope it doesn't
pass I am supporting it that
that we are transparent and
simple for the voters the voters
don't want to do something
they're confused about is trying
to race on so I'm that is very
crucial as we proceed to do this
and I think you so much for your
on your working hard work and
trying to do something that is
palatable not only for the
voters that also for
congressional action and to the
legislation ultimately for early
childhood and K. to twelfth
education thank you Mr chairman
thank you Sir.
Senator Rodriguez Senator
Campos.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
of course Senator in the
nineteen thank you very much for
the information that you're
bringing forward because it's
essential we goes back to
stability whenever we start
talking about the SCG or the
state's position here in T. and
and and that's the focus now and
I really appreciate what you're
what you're going for a couple
of reasons I go back to the
start of my career where I was
sent a migrant teacher and at
risk teacher and within that the
resources that we had available
for students within.
Those particular frameworks
we're.
They were not just as stable and
Indian fortunate aspect of it is
there are young people that need
additional work additional
support in order to deal
directly with on their careers
and ensuring that they are going
to be able to be self sufficient
as we move forward help you
better better understand the
formula for the SCG because
that's going to be essential as
we all know we're going to reset
the SCG after the resources that
we have
have passed if you will through
a legislative session and so we
have our school districts they
continue to wait for that
particular formula
within this the stabilization of
the SCG
Has there been any are in terms
of.
When that SCG would be released
so that school districts could
better plan if you will for.
Teacher salaries hiring teachers
in strength in terms of what
they are there educational
platforms would be at the very
school districts including if
you will
the.
The other specialized components
that would would make up if you
will what the SCG which
required.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee of course the
publication time line for the
SCG especially in in our S. and
when the voters approved this
thus making these funds
available to the SCG to the
appropriation account to support
these services for all school
districts the timing of that is
covered in part by statute and I
think in part by the discretion
of the secretary of education.
And so Mr Chairman I think
that's an incredibly important
piece of this and I think you
know that's our challenges
legislators is to ensure that we
always bring forward those
concerns to the table at the
appropriate time with respect
the Mr chairman to the SCG
itself and to its operation Mr
chairman I think Senator Campos
one of the one of the current
one of the critical areas we
need to address is the at risk
unit index right so RSCG does a
really good job of equalizing
funding between school districts
to ensure that we do not have an
unconstitutional variance in the
amount of funding that New
Mexico is actually sending to
its school districts
the amount of money that is sent
to school districts let's say in
the bases Spence supplemented by
an at risk factor
and which generates certain
program units for those students
which translates to more money
for the school district but
there are challenges the at risk
index and I think Senator
Stewart is sort of leading an
important conversation this
session about how we need to go
back and reform and revised the
at risk unit index number one so
that it Dirac's more funding but
in a more targeted way.
you know in my district I have
been critical for example
Senator of the fact that
responding if it's not a charter
school was just sent to a
district and then the district
decides how that funding is sent
around and it too and I've been
working on this for about three
years and so it can still not
get clear data about how many
school districts actually
appropriate they're at risk unit
money.
And so you know this is kind of
step one.
we know we have to fund early
childhood to meet the at the the
meat we know we have to fund at
risk students services more the
courts have told us we know that
we have tremendous learning loss
to the COVID that we have to
make up somehow.
But I think as the legendary
chairman Kiki surveyed once
that.
Where is the money.
Right we can have all of the
greatest intentions of the world
but our responsibility Mr
chairman and senator is to
ensure that there is a
sustainable revenue source that
meets the current needs of our
students not only for early
childhood but across the
education continue and just
Senator Rodriguez pointed out Mr
chairman and senator Campos that
includes schools like the
schools we support for the blind
and for the deaths.
we cannot leave any child at any
point in their development out
of this conversation Mr chair
Senator thank you thank you very
much and senator Candelaria I
really appreciate your passion
your vision in the intellect
that you continue to apply as we
deal with each one of these
issues.
And to go directly to the SCG
once again as the base for
equalization for our school
districts that of course is
going to be essential for long
term planning when it comes to
the success of our educational
platform for the future I'm just
gonna close with a comment on
the the amendment I really
appreciated it's very awful it's
something I believe that we can
support I would like to hear
further from the sponsors of the
joint resolution however because
within that this does expand if
you will of the amount of
resources that we would be
seeking and that we want to
ensure that the parts that
they've been working on it you
have Senator Candelaria.
How all of this is going to be.
Reported as we move forward if
we don't work on this together
and come out with
this particular joint resolution
and all join hands to support
this we take this to the public
again it could be a lot of work
done in the at maybe we fall
short and we cannot afford all
short anymore.
So with that Mr chair if I could
I'd like to hear from Sanchez
reporting on the amendment that
is on the screen.
Thank you Mr chairman Senator
Campos senator Candelaria this
amendment is friendly it's
topple its comprehensive it
deals with Martinez Yazzie as
well we champion one percent not
because the fund couldn't handle
it but we kind of got lost in
the that narrative and we're
grateful we're grateful to the
wisdom of this committee to to
look at the fund and the and the
possibilities from all angles so
it is very very friendly what
I'd ask the committee to
consider in between now and the
floor is on on paragraph twenty
three twenty four and twenty
five.
We use the language early
education early childhood
educational services and
particularly we're gonna create
this new beneficiaries unless
created in our image early
childhood educational services
this amendment changes it too
early childhood education and we
don't want to lock out those
home visiting programs are those
programs that kind of deal with
the health aspects of of early
childhood so would prefer up
early childhood educational
services so that there's no
question that all the programs
administered by the early
educational department qualify
under this under this resolution
but we can clean that up here on
the floor
whatever's quickest and best
thank you Mr chairman.
Mr chairman if I then of course
I'd like to defer to senator
Candelaria because it's better
that we work on this here in
Senate finance if that is going
to be something that would be
acceptable.
Mister Mister president
The.
I I this is one of those moments
where it's sort of six six of
one half dozen the other at and
and I I really respect and and
and recognize representative of
my asked justice concern from a
statutory or constitutional
construction perspective.
The the the issue is I think
that number one the language is
permissive enough.
R. as it is and number two
This is a I think we have to
always recall this is a
supplemental source of revenue.
it is not meant to supplant
general fund revenues that are
already going to support
sort of the at a story or
wraparound services.
That support early edge.
Eight.
Senator I can't hear senator
Candelaria this is Senator
Campos I can't you know I was
just double proposing that right
now as a as a what's your me my
my son you may now yes thank you
and senator Candelaria.
What what I'm saying is I think
I think I I don't think it's
unnecessary amendment quite
frankly but and so I I don't
want to proposed at this moment
Mr Chairman on the fly but what
I will do is I will certainly
commit to ongoing discussion
with my state representative.
prior to this region before
should make it out of this
committee on that issue and keep
the committee informed on that
progress and if the informant is
needed then we can discuss it
there and and that shouldn't be
too much of an issue Mr
chairman.
That's why thank you Mr chairman
in in just conclude and I I
would hope that possibly
Representative Martinez but also
comment on it because again the
inclusivity it's going to be
imperative incumbent upon us as
this reaches the floor because
the messaging is going to be a
essential this is going to be
earth breaking when we really
come to our what the final
outcome is going to be and our
our general public are
definitely looking for
in anticipation of our new steps
to improve our education so then
that if I could also hear from
the other co sponsor of the
resolution thank you.
Thank you Mr chair Senator
Campos as R. Candelaria I share
Michael Sanchez perspective I
think it is a a wise amendment I
think it's awful
you know I share and senator
Candelaria as position you know
that to the extent that we can
up lift all of our children
right and clearly our our work
over the last ten years has been
to build that early childhood
education system from zero up
until five years of age.
but that you know that doesn't
mean that we we also shouldn't
uplift
children once they're they're in
school
you know at the Yazzie Martinez.
Really again.
Us an opportunity to reflect
on that K. twelve system that we
all love and appreciate and I
think this ammendment
as inclusive as this is
reflective of our all of our
values I believe and lastly I
think it really
Furthers the case that Michael
Sanchez Representative Maestas
who I regard as one of the
state's top experts on our land
grant permanent fund that in
fact the Langer premier Fund can
can afford to invest more in our
children and so at that the one
point two five I'm happy and
grateful for the work that
senator Candelaria put into
drafting the amendment I'm
grateful to this committee for
the conversation to be had today
and hopefully to to to have a
vote as well thank you.
Thank you very much in in in in
closing on the amendment and I I
agree with senator Candelaria
when it comes to how permissive
the the the language definitely
be and that in essence is that
education is the field of study
that deals mainly with methods
of teaching and learning in
schools and so within that
that's where all education
begins in our schools and in our
homes and I believe that that
that would be permissible again
I fully support between now and
the time this is to reach the
floor of that that we do have
that discussion because we want
to ensure that that is going to
be clear going back to support
Senator of Regus is indicated we
want a very clear and simple
amendment if it does past
present to the general public so
that they understand that what
we're not talking about is the
full fledged approach to
enhancing improving and making
sure that education is going to
reach all levels again when
we're all together in this all
boats will with thank you very
much Mr chairman thank you very
much members of the Senate
finance committee your
intelligence.
Thank you.
The largest let me clarify I
mean this this helps but I I
still know what it meant one
percent I was a lot better at.
Senator sure we're gonna try to
wrap this up in the next five or
ten minutes on the amendment to
get this bill out here Senator.
thank you Mr chair I'm I'm going
through this ammendment and I
don't see where this is still
going to the early childhood
trust fund so that we can
appropriated it appears to me
that it just falls into the
general fund somewhere what am I
missing Mr chair and sponsor the
amendment thank you Mr chairman
Senator share so that I know
we've had some productive
conversations about potentially
designating the early childhood
trust fund as the sole
beneficiary the challenges that
in so doing we would basically
only make available thirty
million dollars of the one
hundred and some million that I
discussed earlier because that
is the current distribution of
the early childhood trust fund
to its program Fund until that
fund reaches six hundred million
at which point the distribution
will convert to a five percent
or thereabouts distribution so
what this Legisla- this
amendment does Mr chairman is in
order to preserve the
legislature's appropriation
power over that money it does
not designate the executive
agency as the sole beneficiary
of the funds instead what it
does is that states that the
additional distribution may be
used for the provision of early
childhood education as provided
by law meaning the legislature
appropriates that money Mr
chairman and I think in future
years especially given and all
of those circumstances we've
discussed I think it be why that
in the that that some of that
money is going to have to be
appropriated to the early
childhood trust fund and not
used simply to supplement other
general fund activities
in the event I think as a
Sanchez have recognized at least
for the first few years of
implementation we may not be
able to spend that entire
hundred some million dollars.
So some of that's going to have
to be put into the trust fund
which I think is a good idea I
do think it's a good idea that
at least some of this revenue.
Is put into that trust fund to
grow up.
just like I think it may be a
good idea to dedicate some of
the marijuana.
Revenue towards the land grant
permanent fund in the severance
tax permanent fund.
as as new sources of revenue for
those permanent funds.
As as oil and gas you know.
Ms volatile or whatnot but Mr
chairman that's kind of how we
deal with that in this
ammendment.
So.
Mr chair and senator so this is
you know this was my concern on
the other amendment all I like
it amended better.
This now says is provided by law
which means.
That what we do this year is not
necessarily what we do next year
every legislature is so is is
separate and one legislature's
not bound by the next so that
really means that no matter what
we do this year of the two years
from now we can completely
change it we can we can put that
money in PED.
in college early childhood but
it just gets lost in the PED
budget somewhere
or the last time we did this for
education well what we did was
put it in the general fund and
it just got lost in the general
fund so the key issue for me was
where that money's going and and
I think we've missed that mark
now
we do have money if we want to
to put in the in the early child
hood Trust Fund.
You know there's one point six
billion dollars of federal money
out there stick some of it in
there six six hundred million of
it in there if that's we want to
do get up to where it's supposed
to be and I think that solves
the problem one point two five
also disturbs me but where the
money goes is is is and.
That's just too much if we don't
know where that money goes if we
can't.
Put it where the legislature
gets to deal with it in not the
department.
Then I don't think that this is
a achieved what we need to do
thank you Mr chair.
Thank you senator sure motion
and.
Ins.
Second by Senator Candelaria.
Any objection to the motion.
Yes Mister chair I object I
just.
So.
We show Senator shares Center
Burt objecting to the amendment.
Senator Woods to.
Senator Diamond object.
She's.
We are back on the bill
questions on the bill Mr
Chairman.
I would move you past I would
never do passed on.
The measure as amended all.
Thank you
I I just have some questions and
and lots of words of wisdom for.
The house members are presenting
this first of all.
Somebody doesn't get what they
want I don't appreciate the
attack on the members Senate
finance.
Because H. R. was moving forward
and has been moving forward.
Well Mr chairman I don't know
about that but
H. Darr was moving forward and
and.
Now stop or to attack members of
Senate finance because you
didn't think it was getting what
you wanted or what it should be.
This is a historic day for for
each year one
for the members of the Senate
finance committee.
As we move forward
You got something that you never
got before you got a higher
dollar amount than you ever have
before.
We got a structure in place.
We know how the money is spent.
It will not be and and I will
say this bill will not be.
Able to to the early childhood
education.
We are the program body and will
appropriate dollars for this.
Sanchez question really quickly.
So what services are currently
provided.
Representative Martina Sir
Representative Maestas Mr
Chairman.
please Representative.
That's good no I was going to
for the secretary she we're
we're the first state in the
country to have a department
devoted early educational
services we have a nationally
renowned leader as our secretary
would you mind just briefly what
programs that we currently
providing.
Yes thank you Mr chair members
of the committee the services
range everything from our child
care beginning with infants six
weeks old up to children into
childcare programs pre K. of
course one of our signature New
Mexico pre K. programs home
visiting we have a number of
models of home visiting in the
state evidence based and state
funded promising programs those
are and then our early
intervention program funded to
the US department of education
but with a lot of state support
for infants and toddlers with
developmental disabilities and
delays and those are the primary
purpose we also have families
first which is a program that
supports pairing it the
perinatal period of development
but I would say the ones of
fallen strongly into early
childhood education or child
care are pre K. many of our home
visiting models I'm an early
intervention program.
Thank you madam secretary and
could you clarify how much
federal funding you're getting
this year again because you have
called us out once before when
clarify in in the new federal
stimulus later getting.
There have been three different
stimulus funds since the
beginning of the pandemic and so
the first one was about twenty
nine million most of that has
all been expended to support
families with the essential
workers with childcare
supporting child care businesses
supporting our school reentry
program because of so many of
the children whose parents were
working even though they were in
hybrid and remote we're using
our child care facilities as a
place for child supervision and
support the second stimulus that
we just received in December
early in the year was eighty two
million and that is again
directly to support child care
for essential workers to help
wait parent co payments and to
support our child care
businesses many we have three
hundred who are still
temporarily closed over thirty
who permanently closed so we
need to rebuild and make sure we
can have child care so we can re
start our economy and make sure
our families all across New
Mexico can go back to work and
then most recently the American
recovery plan relief plan is
about three hundred and twenty
million now both the eighty two
million and the three hundred
and twenty million we have until
September of twenty twenty three
and we planned to use those
dollars to again rebuild our
child care industry support
families and to support the
social emotional development of
children families and staff that
have been towards so much during
this pandemic so those are the
three pots of money the three
packs of stimulus money that
have come to the Department but
again that's over almost three
years and that we will invest in
things that will be not
recurring I'm as much as
possible because it is about
really filling in the enormous
losses that are childcare
industry have experienced during
the pandemic and our families of
experience in terms of their
lost revenues so those are are
at.
Hopefully that was helpful Mr
chair members of the committee.
and madam secretary that don't
start any new programs we will
be looking at finding any new
programs in the future so don't
start that with one time money
are are you find yourself short
somewhere.
How much did you revert to the
general fund last year for early
childhood.
The haft I don't believe we
reverted any and in FY twenty we
did not out am I a will have to
get back to the committee on
that.
I don't believe.
This yes Kelly are you on with
us.
Charles are you on with us how
much do they revert last year
but.
Mr chairman I can find this is
David I can provide a second
here.
Well it.
The early childhood they I don't
think they would have reverted
any because they don't have a
recurring appropriation from
last year it was this is their
first start up here so.
So
So I don't believe we have a
version for them for last year
for the CCD Mr chairman yeah
thank you CYFD now that
number I thought about that in
the early childhood so I just
wanted to check that
I just want to caution you as
much as you push for H. R. one.
we will be watching how you
spend these dollars.
Turn about it is is fair play if
I see services that are not
happening in my district.
You'll get a call.
And then we'll move forward from
there but.
I know that in my district is
hard to get the services out and
you need to work twice as hard
to get into my area rural areas
are twice as hard to get kids
services as urban areas because
of files we have to travel to
get those services are a lot
further.
And every kid in New Mexico
deserves an opportunity a
chance.
We have a chairman of I could
just say that the cover of our
strategic plan for the agency
says every community every
family every child I couldn't
agree more I want you to hold me
accountable I want you to hold
the department accountable for
the work that we do and that the
money that you appropriate to us
so thank you.
We will hold you accountable the
the.

do is our secretary so.

I don't appreciate the journey
as a land but it is what it is
today and we can move forward
I just reconciling the load a
little bit I mean I think every
kid is what we've got to worry
about but help people low shows
where their passions and and
what they care for in a
district.
And who benefits from formerly
child in the districts of
thank you Mr chair I can't let
you insult the Republicans like
that we didn't vote but this way
because we don't care about
children we voted this way
because we do care about
children this is just the wrong
path to go down I'm not going to
let that stop.
Thank you representatives.
Thank you Mr chairman committee
members thank you chairman thank
a committee.
We'll go to Senate bill four
thirteen next.
By surely Committee thank you Mr
chairman okay we are on line
Canadian seventy two percent of
bills for thirteen regional
broadband franchise Act by
they're not.
Thank you this is part of the
broadband that we've seen
throughout one hundred thirty
three million in in the center
of the is broadband bill and
house bill payment this is the
final piece of that.
It's a difficult pieces we move
forward
and so.
This just adds ability for them
to add the last mile which is
the heart of smile to maintain.
It does not
It does not.
More money more it does not have
the power eminent domain
in Adrian who is our expert
ordinances honestly in this
morning but it allows regional
broadband partnerships and so if
Gallup or someone wants to
partnership for the last mile to
come in or out of Gallup they
can partner with them go to the
other broadband bills with the
formation of the committee in
the funds and then be able to
get a match to help out last
month so I think that will stand
for questions.

Senator well we'll bring that

because we're gonna go court
Senator Steinborn you have
Senate bill four nineteen.
You ready for me Mr chair.
No right colleagues bill for
nineteen seeks to reform
a law I guess commonly known as
Jennings law because out came in
the building but it's really
modifying the rules in which.
Which a landowner can kill
wildlife protected wildlife.
That is perceived to be a threat
to their crops.
And I want to just say very
clearly Mr chair colleagues
number one this does not affect
DTR plus program I know emails
we're getting people.
Read that fearful that course
that's not in the bill it's in a
different section of of of law.
It it doesn't necessarily affect
the ability of landowners to be
able to.
Even legally deal with deal with
animals that they've you are
threats to their crops.
it is what it does do is have
the game commission established
rules reasonable rules for that
to ensure that
there you know preserving and
considering public safety around
them that they're actually
taking care of the problem
itself when using the
appropriate caliber weapon.
This is needed colleagues
because unfortunately the laws
it's written right now is overly
broad it's overly permissive and
frankly has resulted in abuses
almost from the very beginning
the most famous case right now
we allow in order to kill any
number wildlife were no
questions asked by any means and
we we had a horrific case number
years ago where.
Landowner literally tendon.
Over forty prong horn antelope
went around with a four Wheeler
and shot them with a shot gun.
Most of them were having kids.
And it was horrific we've got.
We've got stories like that.
Almost every year the one that
you're gonna hear about very
briefly today.
So that's it so it doesn't
affect on it doesn't affect non
protected species like coyotes.
it's our it also deal has a very
limited waste and want to in
addition to the statute where
you could not leave.
Probably a bear cougar out in
the field without harvesting
acceptable questions and adding
those species the waste in one
statutes so it's it's just a
reasonable tweaking to it will
not affect ninety nine percent
of the people Mr chairman the
bill has a delayed
implementation for literally
year and a half until next
January first which was the date
desired by the game and fish
department your ample time for
everyone's input to get the
right role crafted it's really
just designed to get rid of the
bad actors and again it's not
touchy plus at all so with that
Mr chair I would are
respectfully requested my
experts be allowed to make a
very brief statement and then
not go you know stand for
questions allow for public
comment.
You know we do have a time limit
of fifteen minutes.
Okay my thank you Mr chair I'd
like to just allow me a check I
sent the honest who many of you
know it just a brief minute or
two to share her story.
Thank you.
All good morning chairman then
you know send members of the
committee I am a taken some the
honest and I'm here on behalf of
myself.
I strongly support the creation
of a reasonable policy this sets
boundaries to the mass
slaughtering of animals on
private land and Senate bill
four nineteen does that.
It does that by narrowing the
conditions for a landowner Lacy
taking or killing animals I
revising provisions for taking
or wasting of game.
I want to thank you Senator
Steinborn and Senator Stewart
for sponsoring the legislation.
As many of you know my husband
Jay and I live in Alameda New
Mexico when it's located about
twelve miles north of Sapporo
and on the west side of the
interstate twenty five we live
in unit thirteen the Soviet the
National Wildlife Refuge is
approximately three thousand
feet almost due west of our
property I have great respect
for animals the law the hunting
community and the ranching
community.
Because I am part of those
communities and I believe people
have the right to protect their
property I grew up in Gallup my
family's been hunting since the
nineteen thirties that's five
generations of licensed hunters
my parents enrolled my brothers
and I and the local hunter
safety course at a very young
age I shot a rifle for the first
time at age seven and I continue
to practice shooting sense I
hold the current New Mexico
concealed carry permit my
husband owns a ranch that's been
in his family for five
generations.
The reason I share this with you
is because what I have witnessed
literally brought me to my knees
broke my heart and made me
determined to change the
Jennings law and here is why
this is my story I'd like to
share with you July twenty
nineteen I'm inside my house
just before seven AM I heard a
gunshot to the north I peek out
to see what was going on and
then heard the second shot.
Coming from the same direction I
couldn't see the shooter or a
vehicle because it was blocked
by my father's house at the same
time I saw heard about jumping
over my dad's stance and noticed
several were injured I then
heard two more shots.
And money to the LFC we're
already running across my
father's field and then my field
my good neighbor and I mean that
sincerely we are good neighbors
that lend a hand no questions
asked.
So he has about eleven head of
cattle next door to our family
property he leases approximately
sixteen to seventeen acres to
grow wheat pasture to feed his
cattle.
Has told me several times that
he's going to just shoot that
out because they're tearing up
this past year you mentioned
that is working with the game
and fish department could have
been out fans but the landowner
at the time the landowner didn't
want the fans so it's just going
to shoot that you know the LFC
well and he was within its legal
rights to take this action under
the current law he was within
its legal rights.
And that's exactly what I
witnessed Mr chairman members of
the committee about eighteen now
all beautiful pools many
traumatized and injured from a
shooter that shot repeatedly
into the herd.
I counted eight bowls with a
broken leg it's struggling to
run across my property minutes
later I saw the ball with his
job loan off in another bowl
that it did not only got shot
with a broken leg as well
another bull with the broken leg
said west calendar year cation
direction stating the water
because you couldn't get out
other scattered in various
directions some even jumped over
fences to the east almost ended
up on interstate twenty five the
game warden put I believe six
down now you know back to the
shooter he was shooting towards
a dwelling and across our
property but he was within the
law that's important to note
here it was within the law
because it brought this up with
game and fish captain in our
district.
Great respect for game and fish
and also my husband and I
actually went out and measured
the distance because in my
humble opinion the shooter was
really thread the needle there
where the shooter shooting
towards a dwelling.
And across our property in a
rural village where families
farm and ranch in the area of
where this horrific incident
took place children walk the
walk to the bus stop neighbors
take morning and evening walks
around the ditch bank and
depending on the time of day we
get to see the elk and deer that
have used the same migratory
path for over thirty years.
Again I want to mention that I I
greatly appreciate the game and
fish department and the
commission for their systems
that day you know I support
reforming the jamming Jennings
Law by setting rules promulgated
by the commission the provide
land whether and by what manner
and method a species can be
taken our kids in order to
mitigate damage and Senate bill
four nineteen does that by
giving the commission the
authority to question structure
behind this and limit these
masks lottery situation out
Senate bill four nineteen what
it does not do Mr chairman
members of the committee it
doesn't take my rights away to
use legal action to protect my
family my livestock my pets my
property.
And you know this bill clearly
does not interfere with ranchers
participating in the LFC private
land use system that you plus
system.
Which is the game commission
role governing distribution
about permits to private
landowners and that section is
seventeen dash to dash seven dot
two known as the Jennings law.
So Mister chairman members of
the committee ranchers choose
whether to enroll at U. plus
system and receive our permits
that hunters often rate you know
thousands of dollars for I get
that and I respect that or
choose to take action against
deprecating wildlife including
killing animals under the
Jennings law and related roles I
can't do both but the choice is
there a clear choices there so
chairman Yost members of the
committee I really appreciate
the time and and thank you for
the opportunity to speak with
you today please support the
bill.
Thank you for your brand of
reason or.
