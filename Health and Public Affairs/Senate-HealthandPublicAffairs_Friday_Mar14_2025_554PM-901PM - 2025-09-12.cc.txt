Madam Chair, I have some
questions on this bill. I don't
know whether I would vote yes or
no, but I do have a couple of
questions.
I know you have it on consent.
OK, um, if there's a question
then we remove it from consent
and it goes on to.
OK.
Right, I, I do have some
questions on it's specifically
about repealing the assisted

just
Questions. OK.

So with that, and we have
finished consent agenda.
Yeah, well, what we did on our
last committee on Senate Bill
176, medical malpractice
changes.
We did have um
A presentation from the sponsors
and then we had those in the
audience who were in favor or in
opposition, both in the audience
and of course on Zoom.
And what we are doing today,
there is no more public comment.
This is just for questions from
the committee.
Um, to the sponsors.
So Senator Hickey, if you would
join us up front.
So I think um
Again, there was a presentation
from the sponsors already
previously, and we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
On Senate Bill 176.
Senator Block
Thank you, Madam Chair, and um,
Thank you, uh, Senator Hickey
and um Senator Wood's response
in this bill along with the
other.
Um
Many, many co-sponsors,
Republican and Democrats on this
bill.
Um, Madam Chair, first I, I just
really want to say
Very, very sorry to those.
Um, individuals that
Uh, testified and gave their
stories on um
What day is today?
Friday, on Wednesday, sorry,
everything's a blur.
Um, I was very, very touched,
uh, and saddened by many of
those stories are given.
personal stories in coming here,
and I just
Really want to just give you my
apologies for everything that's
happened to your families on
those stories, um, very sad.
Um
Madam Chair, Senator Hickey.
Those stories you heard those as
well.
And I'd like to ask you,
With those have happened even
with this bill.
Madam Chair, and Senator, yes.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Doctor Hickey.
Um
Senator Hickey, how, how long,
how long have you been
practicing medicine?
Uh, Madam Chair and senator,
actual practice of medicine, uh,
for about
that
25 years and then I've been an
administrator.
In health institutions all over
the country.
including
head of the faculty practice at
UNM CEO at Loveless and started
the health plans here in New
Mexico Health Connections and
True Health.
Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank
you, Madam Chair, and Senator uh
Hickey and Senator Woods, um, I
don't, I don't know who you're
two experts are here.
got a doctor Albert Klen.
AWA.
uh,
he has been my practicing
physician for many years.
He recently for retired and
moved into Albuquerque.
But he practiced.
How many years, Doctor.
I practiced 30 years in clovers
and told to practicing 35 years
of medicine.
And Madam Chair and senator, my
expert is Christina Fisher from
Think New Mexico.
Thank you, Senator. Um, thank
you, panel members. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Um, Senator Hickey or Senator
Woods.
It looks like the
Does this bill inhibit.
Any patient
In the city of New Mexico.
From filing a lawsuit for
malpractice against a healthcare
provider.
Madame Chair and Senator, no.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
So senators.
Does this bill
Reduce
Any
Any award
Any lawsuit award to any
patient.
That follows a malpractice claim
in the state of New Mexico.
Madam Chair and Senator, no.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Um, senators, does this.
Build
Does this bill continually pay
out to the patient, um, after
award of a lawsuit is received.
To provide treatment.
Uh, for a set period of time.
Madame Chair and Senator, uh,
this bill, uh,
Protects the patient's care fund
to be able to pay out.
For the lifetime of uh the
individual and however the
injury may affect the individual
through their lifetime.
Um,
But currently, uh, we understand
that
That is sometimes calculated out
actuarly, um, and that money is
uh
taken by the patient up front
and then however it's spent is
up to the patient, and then
whatever is negotiated between
the patient and their attorney,
uh, that goes to the attorney.
Upfront.
And, and, and senator that, that
is thought of as a
Present value of money.
In other words, you can get.
Less money today, but you get it
today.
So it's, it's a less value, it's
a present value of money, if
that makes sense.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. So, if we have, and
there's a couple of examples uh
here in the audience on
Wednesday of some, some younger
people, uh, Doctor Hickey that
had
Malpractice, um,
Damages awarded.
So for, for this bill.
Is it more beneficial for this
bill, especially for those
younger people that go through
some type of medical malpractice
trauma where there
The costs are
Um, they're not running out of
that money after the lump sum
they're getting the, the
treatment over years.
Madam President and Senator, uh,
yes, that is the case over the
years.
But uh that can potentially can
be negotiated to to be upfront.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Um, Madam Chair, senator, on, on
your bill on page 7.
Where we talk about, I want to
understand what, what this means
here, starting with um
Uh, in section 2.
And let me just read it, so.
I, everyone understood, well,
everyone can hear it, so we can
talk about it real quick.
It says here
Uh, Doctor Hickey, Senator
Hickey.
Sara Woods
In a malpractice claim.
in which punitive damages are
awarded, the court shall divide
the punitive damage award and
enter a judgment as follows.
25% of the punitive damage award
shall be awarded to the
prevailing party.
75% of the punitive damage shall
be awarded to the state.
All amounts awarded to the state
shall be remitted to the state
treasurer to be deposited into
the patient safety Improvement
Fund.
So
The the money that the state
gets, um, can I assume that is
going into a fund where we are
trying to grow that fund where
we are paying out those
Um, malpractice claims over a
long period of time for the
patient.
Madam Chair and senator, that is
one of the possible uses of the
fund. There are other uses of
the fund, such as uh assisting
in some difficult situations
where there are staffing ratios
that aren't up to date, it could
be used for that in facilities,
uh, we also, I think I pointed
out last time, we do not have a
peer review mechanism, which was
established in 1984 by a famous
case.
called Darling and which
hospitals, the hospital boards
had all the liability, um, for
all the quality and it directed
hospitals then henceforth to
have peer review activities
among the physicians, uh, who
were on the staff and uh that
eventually grew into the joint
commission for Quality Assurance
and um
And and what have you.
The um
Ah
I, I'm sorry, repeat the
question. I was just
Imaging my memory, that's OK,
uh, sir, uh, Madam Chair,
Senator.
One of the, the options I think
that we have for the state is,
so you have the 25% of the
damages would go to the, the
patient.
75% would go to the state where
it could potentially grow in a
fund as we do with other other
funds.
I was asking you if if that was
the, the primary
Um
You know, the primary um process
that this would go through, but
it sounds like it could do other
things as well.
Let's face it,
uh, Senator, Madam Chair, I'm
sorry I'm leaving you out of
this discussion, Madam Chair.
And
That's fun. You, you got to
think about patient and long
term.
medical expenses.
Medical expenses increase
sometimes backuarial tables that
that we set up for a patient
recovery is wrong.
There was a fun right here that
can help pay for some of those
extra expenses.
that may occur to that patient.
So
is still tied to these funds.
It's just a managed account
that.
That
Above
of the settlement, it's a, it's
another managed accountant.
can
Possibly more money out of in
the future if they're healthy.
Deteriorates beyond what
The original fault was.
is the way I look at this.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Um
Senator, uh, Senator.
Doctor Fisher, other states set
up like this where part of the
damages go toward uh the state
to take care of the patient for
um a prolonged period of time.
Yes, Madam Chair and senator,
uh, there are 3 states that have
a similar sort of uh split
recovery system where some
portion of the recovery of
punitive damages, not
compensatory damages, which is
meant to compensate the patient
for the harm, but punitive
damages, which are meant to
punish for egregious misconduct.
So if you have a malpractice
that is not just a normal sort
of error shouldn't have been
done, but is so egregious that
it deserves to be punished.
There are 3 states, Alaska,
Pennsylvania, and Oregon that
split that recovery between the
state and
the patient and in this case, we
would use that state portion to
try to prevent incidents of
future malpractice. So that's
why the patient safety fund, we
would like to uh punitive
damages.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Are, are
you, what's your back? Are you
an attorney?
Yes, ma'am Chair, I'm an
attorney.
OK.
Um
So, Madam chair and um Miss
Fisher.
That's OK.
So, Ms. Fisher, how, how long
are those other three states
have been set up like the, like
New Mexico could be set up.
They've been set up like that
for several decades, so I know
Oregon dates to 1977, I believe,
uh, Pennsylvania is in the 90s,
um, I lasted a little bit more
recent, but it's been multiple
decades for those three states.
Madame Chair and Miss Fisher,
of, of those states been
fiscally sol solving for the
patients.
They have, and again the, the
states uh use it in different
ways and so this, uh, has a
really tight nexus between the
fact that the money is coming
from malpractice claim, it's
going to a fund to prevent
future malpractice. The other
states use it in slightly
different ways, so organs goes
into a criminal justice fund for
for victims of criminal justice
issue incidents, um, I believe
Alaska just sends it to the
general fund, so different
states do it differently, but,
um, this is how we're proposing
for New Mexico.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair, and senators, um,
Is this bill more or less
advantageous to the patient that
goes through this medical
malpractice process.
And and why?
As we mentioned,
This bill is to protect the
patient.
Particle on future medical
expenses, we can forecast how
we're going to cope.
Now we've got AI romantic
surgery, this is all in the old,
we never heard of 10 years ago.
Technology will improve.
With the fun
A simple term pay as we need to
pay out, we build the patient
more option for future care.
And that's important is to
protect the patient better
benefit of patient, particularly
like young patient injured may
take a lifelong medical care and
the fund ideas, you're allowed
to provide a patient future more
advanced optional treatment.
Think of it. I'm sure, and uh.
So
thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Doctor Kwan. So, Ms.
Fisher, you're, you're a lawyer
and uh you heard from, in my
opinion, some compelling
arguments from the uh the
attorneys that were here.
Um
What's the disadvantage to the
patient.
Just doing status quo.
And I'm sure some of you're
asking between the, the status
quo in this bill.
So Madam Chair, Miss Fisher.
The other attorneys that spoke
from what, from how I heard it
could be wrong, but from how I
heard it.
Said that this bill puts the
patients at a very big
disadvantage.
Um
How, how is that?
How was that
How's that so? Because to me,
this seems to be taking care of
the patients long term because
when they get their lump sum.
Uh, oh, damage award.
Punitive damages, that money may
run out because you might have
some
Upfront higher costs.
Where you still have some issues
that pop up 5, 10 years down the
road that you might not have the
money to get that chair.
So it
In your opinion, then I guess
maybe.
Senator Hickey or, or Doctor
Kwan.
Probably ask that.
It seems like it would be a
lower risk for the patients who
have this set up like.
Pennsylvania
Alaska
What was the other state?
Out of your organ in Oregon.
Where they're getting the
long-term care because I, I
think, I, again, I'm not a
doctor or anything, but
To me, you're gonna have to have
Um, a lot of upfront.
Healthcare costs, uh, to take
care of whatever is going on, or
it could be actually peanut
butter spread out based on some
of the patients that I've seen
on Wednesday.
That looked like they would
need.
Consistent long-term care.
Um, so I guess doctor, Doctor
Hicke or Senator Hickey.
This seems to be a lower risk,
um.
For, for the patient, is that
accurate?
Uh, Madam Chair and senator,
yes, and it also goes further in
that it does seek to limit the
attorney's fees to 25% in a
settled case and 33%.
Uh, in a, if a case goes to
trial. Now some people may say,
well, you know, geez, that's not
enough, but uh we know that uh
several states, Idaho, Indiana,
Nevada, Florida, Massachusetts,
New Jersey have stricter or
similar, um.
Hey, uh, pay, uh, proportion for
the attorneys and um we've
looked to see that that decrease
the suits, and it hasn't, um,
the suits and all the states are
roughly the same as the national
average. So the, the
The 33 and 25% for compensatory
damages gives more to the
patient.
So again, this is another factor
that this is a patient favorable
bill.
Thank you, sir. Thank you
advantage here. Then lastly,
Madam Chair and Senator Hicke,
Senator Woods.
It seems to me that this bill
would not inhibit a patient from
getting an attorney to file any
type of litigation against
medical malpractice. It seems to
me.
The way it's set up where it, it
actually sets up long term care.
For the patient.
Um, which lowers the risk, I
think, for the patient as well.
In regards, Senator Hickey to
the attorney's fees. Quite
frankly, I don't really care
about the attorneys' fees. I
care more about the care of the
patient.
And as long as there's no
Um
We're not violating their rights
by not letting them
File lawsuits. I don't see that
with this bill at all.
I think this is a
They built in the right
direction for New Mexico to
help.
Keep
Providers here, maybe even
attract some providers because
We're, we're not, we're not
doing it.
We're losing docs. Everyone
knows we're the only state to
lose docs.
Every other state gained we're
losing. So I think this is
In the right direction. I want
to thank uh Madam Chair, I want
to thank Senator Hickey.
Senator Woods
Doctor Kwon for your years of
taking care of Senator Woods,
good job.
And uh uh Miss Fisher,
appreciate it. I, I'm in full
support of the bill. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Senel Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Me chair Senator Hickey, were
you involved in the
In the last fix we did of the
malpractice Act.
I'm sorry, Madam Chair and
Senator involved in what in
negotiating the last fix to the
medical malpractice Act. It was
HB 75.
Of which, uh, can you tell me
when that was, Senator, uh,
Madam Chair. Um, in, well, HB
75.
Um, I, let's see, so that must
have been
would have been passed in 2021.
Um
Man chair and senator, I, I
remember that there was a lot of
activity, but personally, no, I
was not involved.
You were not involved? I was not
involved.
Thank you, um, Madam Chair.
Well, HB 75.
Well, I'll just tell you, I
could not understand and I kept
asking doctors who talk to me
about this.
Why is it that malpractice
premiums in New Mexico.
are higher than those states
that don't have a cap. I, I
don't, I couldn't.
I did that, couldn't compete for
me.
So I looked into this.
And um,
I found out that HB 75 required
that beginning in 2021, and I've
got it right here, it's
41-5-25.
Uh.
No, F and G.
Is what I'm looking at.
Um, says beginning in 2021, the
surcharges.
shall be set with the intention
of bringing the funds to
solvency with no projected
deficit by December 31st, 2026.
All qualified and participating
hospitals and outpatient
healthcare facilities.
Um
The
I think I've
Shall cure any fun deficit
attributable to hospitals and
outpatient healthcare facilities
by December 31st, 2026.
So
So that surcharge.
was so that hospitals would make
the deficit payments.
And my understanding is they
would make the deficit payments
through their insurance
companies.
Until 2026. So these higher
premiums were because of the
deal that was struck in 2021.
Is that correct?
Hampshire.
Um, Madam Chair Senator, if I
may, um, so I think New Mexico
looked into this question this
summer, and there are two
different types of policies for
malpractice holds in New Mexico.
One is the policy for uh
healthcare providers that
participate in the medical
malpractice Act and one is for
providers that don't, so it's,
it's an optional if you
participate, you get the benefit
of those liability caps, but you
then do have to pay into the
fund. However, there are
providers that do not
participate and they buy sort of
standard malpractice policies of
the sort that are sold in other
states.
That do not have, um, the sort
of patient's compensation fund
that New Mexico has. So we
received data from the Office of
uh Superintendent of Insurance
on what those policies that are
outside the fund costs, so sort
of standard policies in New
Mexico compared to surrounding
states and in New Mexico, they
average about twice as high. So
we're comparing apples to
apples. We're not looking at the
surcharges paid into the fund.
We're looking at the cost of
policies for providers outside
the fund.
In New Mexico versus similar
policies in other states and
they are still twice as high in
New Mexico, so it can't just be
the surcharge for the fund, but
the pace, the patient uh
compensation fund itself
reported that the increase of
54.8 year over year, but noted
that the increase is mostly due
to the hospital's deficit
repayment schedule. So how were
you able to separate it out? You
separated out people who
participated in the fund versus
people that didn't, but
hospitals are paying a premium.
increase because they agreed to
do it with the fix last year.
Well, Madam Chair Senator,
hospitals that aren't
participating in the medical
malpractice after not paying
into that fund because they're
not getting the benefit of the
malpractice Act to fund any of
that. So we're looking at
policies that are for providers
that do not participate in the
malpractice Act in the fund any
of that. So it's just saying I
want to fly on my own. I'm not
gonna get the liability caps.
I'm just buying my own policies,
so those would not have that
surcharge attached. But the
whole point of the fun was to
reduce premiums. That was the
point. That was the fix.
Yet, it didn't reduce premiums.
It increased them.
And, and that's my point is what
I've been hearing over and over
again is that hospitals need
this because these premiums are
out of sight. Doctors can't pay
them. Well, the truth is in
hospitals, doctors don't pay
them. The hospitals pay them,
and the hospitals are the ones
complaining about these fees and
the hospitals are the ones that
agreed to pay them because they
had over, they had underpaid and
under contributed for years.
Um
Madam Chair, we have uh the
actuary and attorneys from the
OSI who I think can address your
issues if they would be allowed
to uh answer the question.
Madam Chair,
um, Senator, the way the PCF
works is the, it has no bearing
on the surcharge and to was
drawn on uh medical provider or
a hospital.
To participate, it has to
participate in the fund has no
bearing on the underlying
medical malpractice policy that
the party has to acquire, uh,
the surcharges imposed on the
Hospital or the provider to
become a participant of the um
of the patient compensation
fund.
Uh, Madam chair, but these
aren't the hospitals claiming
that that's part of the
increase. There's they're
claiming exactly this much
increase, and the increase
according to the PCF was due to
Hospitals deficit repayment
schedule.
Oh, so how do you know what
hospitals have been saying about
their premiums,
Senator, first I forgot to
introduce myself. My name is
Stephen. I'm the general counsel
at the office of Superintendent
of insurance.
My name is Steven T I, um,
general counsel at the Office of
Superintendent of Insurance.
Again, the, the surcharge
imposed upon the participant of
patients compensation fund.
is not
It, it does not
impact the premium that they pay
for the
Meta malpractice that these
individuals paid.
Currently they, depending on, on
the um uh.
Provider they pay, they have to
have insurance or cash
equivalent of $250,000 and then
they pay into the patient
compensation. The sur or not the
surcharge, the, the premium that
we calculated, and that includes
a surcharge to make this fun
solvent by the um the
Um,
2026.
Madam Chair, I totally agree
with you. However, the hospitals
have been saying that the
increase is, is exactly the same
amount as the, as the, the
premium plus the surcharge.
So my question to you is, Madam
Chair, how do you know what
hospitals are saying about what
they're paying and whether
they're labeling it malpractice
or whether they're labeling it,
which I think is, is incorrect,
label the whole thing or whether
they're saying, well, this is
our premium and this is a
surcharge.
I, I don't think that you're in
a position to know what they're
saying about it, Madam Chair.
That of Chair Senator, uh, I, I,
I do not, we don't have
knowledge what the
Providers pay for their medical
malpractice coverage. Um, and
they simply pay the
Necessary amount to become a
member of the PC uh patient
compensation, and that's
determined by the uh patient
compensation fund, the governing
board, and the Superintendent of
insurance.
That's correct. And so my
problem is that hospitals are
going around yelling the sky is
falling.
Yeah, the increase is mostly due
to something that they agreed to
when we fixed the malpractice
fund in 2021, and I was here, I
tried to pay attention to what
was going on, but I didn't
remember that.
Until I started looking into
this because I didn't understand
why it could have gone so high
and disproportionate to what
other other states are paying.
Who, who have either higher caps
or no caps.
So in researching it, this is
what I found. So I'll go on, um,
and so I just, I just think that
uh a lot of the sky is falling
falling rhetoric from the
hospitals is due to the deal
they cut in 2021 to repay the
fund, what they should have been
paying.
I don't know why they got into
the fund. Patients compensation
fund. I thought that the
patient's compensation fund was
not for hospitals but for
independent doctors.
I understand that that's not the
case. I understand that
hospitals got in. I don't, you
know, I, I know, but because
they got in,
That's what caused um the fund.
Madam Chair, do we know how much
is in the fund now?
Madam Chair, Senator, um, the
balance in the fun is about 200
and
15 $16 million.
Thank you.
So
I am not comfortable and I've
done this on the floor many
times. When we give gifts to
corporate America. It just
bothers me.
Um, so, and I am also a lawyer.
And has a lawyer and I'm always
doing this, raising the
constitution.
People have a constitutional
right to trial by jury.
And a trial by jury in New
Mexico of their peers.
So this bill's punitive damage
aspect.
Um
I don't know. I think that might
be the part of the bill that
just upsets me the most.
To a
First of all, their tax
implications, we don't even know
what they are. If you win a
punitive damage award.
And then
Um, the provision takes away the
decision that was made by
juries, and it, it takes away
the money of a portion of the
money that the that the victim
should get to punish the
hospital for outrageous behavior
or the hospital or and, and this
gets me into
Um, what I was saying, and I, I
said this to Doctor Hickey.
I don't understand how you can
have a hospital.
Or a corporate entity make
medical decisions instead of
doctors. I think that's gonna
increase malpractice and then
take away the money that was is
there to punish them.
And then
Give it to a fund that is then
gonna go to the hospital to, to
theoretically remedy the
problems that caused the problem
in the first place.
So I, I'm really offended uh by
the idea of taking 75% of the
punitive damage award from an
injured party and giving it to a
state-run uh run fund.
And then, and I think there are
constitutional issues. It hasn't
been decided in New Mexico yet,
but I do think that, you know,
how does that affect the right
to trial by jury if you're
intruding into the juror's face,
uh, the, the jury's decision
making space.
And then,
And there may be takings clause,
equal protection, there are all
kinds of potential arguments.
And then even worse if this
victim ends up with a tax bill.
On, on that.
And we have no way of dealing
with that because it's a federal
issue, the federal, the federal
government uh taxes this, and we
can't.
Control that.
Um
The whole idea, I mean, I'm not
a trial lawyer. I've never been
a trial lawyer. Um,
But I am a lawyer
And I'm proud to be a lawyer. I
know there was some lawyer
bashing on the floor, and I
almost stood up to say, you know
what, lawyers and judges are
gonna save us.
They are gonna save us.
Um, but I didn't, um, but I
really do think they are and how
they've saved us in the context
of torts.
is suing the opioid industry,
suing the tobacco industry, the
oil and gas industry and holding
them accountable.
And that's what lawyers do with
medical malpractice is they
holds the medical profession
accountable. I'm very
disappointed that the medical
The medical
field is no longer a profession.
It's a business.
That just disappoints the heck
out of me.
There are no
Doctors don't use their
professional judgment, their
employees of a corporate entity.
And patients are no longer
people with needs.
Their consumers or their profit
centers.
I, I, I just.
In the time I remember going to
the local doctor in Berlin, and
it was a whole different
experience than going into
A hospital to try to get care
now.
Um
I also think
The punitive damages.
is in the area of what the
courts do.
It's, they have a heightened
standard for getting punitive
damages. It has to be outrageous
behavior.
Not just making a mistake, but
it has to be outrageous
behavior.
And I don't think that the the
legislature should be
interfering with the courts and
their ability to make those
decisions and the juries in
their um
Their ability to make the
decisions.
I have
Is she, I was very disappointed
that we didn't that.
The bill that would require
review of private would require
a review of private equity
buying up our hospitals.
Uh, did not get out of
judiciary.
Because I think that was a root
of a lot of the problems we're
seeing in New Mexico.
Um, and so it was really
disappointing to me, and I think
this idea of giving a gift
basket to these private equity
hospitals that are not letting
doctors make their own decisions
about their cases but
interfering with the decision
making.
And then expecting minimal.
Charges. I mean, I already think
a cat and this cap is hadn't
been raised in a long time, but
there is a cap.
I already think the cap is
unfair for somebody who ends up
um with some some of the damages
that people have and I already
think that
Unitive damages is appropriate
for some of the outrageous,
outrageous decisions that have
been made, but I just can't.
Stomach the idea of then.
Rewarding hospitals because this
is really a reward for
hospitals.
For that behavior. So I, I
can't, I, I, like I said, that's
That's probably the worst part
of the bill.
Um
Is taking away the punitives and
putting it in the front that
that is just outrageous to me.
So with that manager, I have
other, other issues, but
I think I'll stop there, um, I
don't wanna dominate.
I appreciate um that I
appreciate the answers to the
questions.
Um
I didn't ask a question there,
there was no questions asked.
So, there were comments to
Senator Block was making.
But I appreciate Senator and
Senator Scott, your next.
Thank you.
Sure.
Senators and experts.
I've never been.
Believerr
In our state being an outlier.
That is
All right, thank.
All things considered,
We should
Look to our neighboring states.
To see
What they are doing,
particularly.
If they are not experiencing.
Similar problems.
Excuse me.
similar problems
The problems we are
experiencing.
Senators and experts can
address.
Oh
If
New Mexico is an outlier with
respect.
To these damages.
And
If this legislation passes,
How it might bring us back.
Closer to the middle.
Madam Chair and senator, thank
you for that question. Uh, I
could go on and on about our
surrounding states and a number
of things that they do as well
as the experts, but I think we
heard it best from Doctor
Metzger, who was a neurosurgeon
here, uh, and testified and um
you know, he, he was regarded as
really the top neurosurgeon in
the state in Albuquerque, um,
and if you recall his testimony,
um,
After he was being, uh,
sued
For cases that have gone before
the, the board that reviews
cases as to whether they have
their or don't have merit, and
uh usually, usually in the past
before this bill when a case
didn't have merit. That was the
end of it. I mean, they could go
to trial, but that was the end
of it, but uh he he kept being
taken uh to court and with the
threat of punitive damages where
he would lose his home,
livelihood,
family.
It's able to go to school over
and over again.
And so he
Picked up and left.
And one of the most uh
Horrendous things I've heard.
He paid 5 times as much for
malpractice surgery to be a
neurosurgeon in New Mexico than
he pays in Arizona. So that
gives you a sense of how we're
an outlier.
And Madam Chair.
Cents and experts.
Is it safe to assume that those
premiums.
Are directly proportional to
the.
Insurance companies perceived
risks.
Of losses.
That they anticipate here in.
In New Mexico as opposed to
tower surrounding states.
Madam Chair and senator, um,
In 2021 before House Bill 75,
New Mexico had the average
number.
Of
Uh, claims where there was a
settlement recorded in the
national database. There is a
national database where if you
are uh suited for uh something
you, it gets registered there.
And
Back in 21, it was 3.2, uh,
cases per 100,000 people, uh,
within 3 years, it went up to
7.2.
And what I understand from a
number of uh heads of various
single specialty groups that
have been kind of the bedrock,
is that virtually every case now
comes with a threat of punitive
damages if they don't suck.
So they're, they're getting
something, but unfortunately
what hurts is that even though
for Doctor Metzger, these were
cases that found with no merit,
but they went and sued anyway,
and because it cost so much to
defend the suit, the insurance
company usually doesn't go and
they'll settle for uh some
smaller sum along the way, and
that's what puts puts fear into
the hearts of physicians looking
into Mexico. I can go and have a
panel say, no, you, there, there
was nothing malicious here was
OK, but I'm still gonna get
named and go into that database,
which then makes it potentially
more difficult if I decide to
change jobs later on when the
case didn't really have merit,
so with that has uh
Resulted in is that we are, uh,
I don't know, you know, here's
here where
Here were number one or number
2, it changes back and forth in
Pennsylvania is the highest
number of cases, 7.3 or 7.2 per
100,000 now versus the 3.2 in
the national average that we
were at.
So that gives you an idea. So if
you're an insurer and you look
at that, you look at that
dramatic increase since the law
was passed and you go, wow, this
is Florida.
And hurricanes.
I'm not gonna, you know, I'm not
gonna participate. I mean, the,
the medical loss ratio.
For in ensuring New Mexico for
every dollar that gets put into
premium, 1.83.
Uh, or $1.83 get paid out.
That's called losing. This isn't
corporations making money this
time you know corporations uh
don't exist or any business to
go out of business. They, they
have to be able to price for it.
So there, that's why we're
seeing the rates increase so
much because they're the
insurance companies are pricing
to the doctors, um, this, uh,
potential.
Uh, loss, and we may end up like
people who live on the coast of
Florida, no insurance, no
coverage. Just, you know, it's
only so long that the other
states are going to bail us out.
Uh, when, before the insurance
company say, don't want to go
there and then from the doctors,
it's the fear of, wow, you know,
no matter what, I go there. I
didn't turns out it was a
frivolous case, but it still
gets settled and still goes on
my records, so why would I come
to New Mexico?
And that's what we're hearing.
And, you know, this is an
outlier, um, Medscape, I think I
made this comment before was
bound to.
Stated that New Mexico was one
of the
least desirable states to
practice medicine. That was just
within the last year.
So the insurance companies may
think the same.
Oh, thank you, that answered,
doctor.
Now, Madam Chair, Senator.
experts with respect to these.
Punitive images that.
were just discussed.
In the event that this bill
passes.
And a physician loses a case.
We punitive damages are awarded.
If this bill passes.
Is that
Improve the circumstances of the
physician that lost that case.
Or does he still pay those or
the insurance company.
They'll pay those punitive
damages.
It's so tell me.
Oh
A patient or his insurance
company.
would benefit
In the event that this
legislation goes through.
With respect to punitive
damages, right, with, with
respect to punitive damages, um,
that there is no insurance for
punitive damages. No one covers
the punitive damages anywhere.
anything, and that's so the
person who, so a punitive
damages are awarded, yes, the
individual becomes liable, uh,
or the, or in the case of a, a
hospital, the hospital is, is
liable for paying that, um.
For, uh, what, whatever that may
be. The um
What we're trying to do is
actually there there's another
thing that's happening here is
that I believe it's by 27.
That the hospitals are out of
the patient care fund and
without the hospitals in there
be able to back it up with the
increasingly
Decrease. I'm sorry, that's gone
with the
Fewer private practice
physicians, we have to be able
to pay in the fund, then the
fund itself is in real danger.
And so that was one of the
reasons why we thought maybe
these punitive damages would
help balance that fund and keep
it there for people, uh, going
forward.
So, Madam Chair and Senator.
In the event that those damages
are awarded, this would
actually.
sand a portion of them.
To this patient care fund.
Benefiting just the patience.
Is that accurate?
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator, um,
it, the bill doesn't specify
exactly where it goes, it goes
into the treasury, but for uses
such as uh
Being able to balance and bring
that patient care fund to the uh
maximum that actuarly is
determined that it needs to be.
So that was one of the possible
uses of the third part of this
bill. Um, and the punitive
damage is 75% going to the
state.
OK.
And under the current
circumstances in the last few
years.
If if we've been able to
demonstrate
physicians are leaving the state
and, can you tell me how many we
have, how many we have left, and
how many we would need.
To be
Fully staffed
Madam Chair and senator.
Uh, to be fully staffed, uh, the
residents association, uh, uh,
the national one that the
university residents are a part
of, uh, they calculated that by
2030 New Mexico will need an
additional 2,217 physicians. And
as I explained, I think in my
opening statements, uh, the
reason is positions are leaving.
We were the only state to lose.
positions as we went through and
I presented the data or real
data not estimates, um, so it's
uh a combination of the
physicians leaving, but also,
uh, you and I with white hair
entering the uh snake as the
elephant, um, with the demand
for care and with the loss of
physicians and loss of our
specialty groups, and we heard
about one group was 2000 patient
backlog, um.
We're just not gonna be able to
meet that need unless we have
some changes to um the
Uh
Malpractice and again,
malpractice is a good thing.
It's part of the system. We, you
know, I really welcome it, um,
and, and then it's there. But uh
it, it is going to be
progressively more difficult for
us to be able to care for New
Mexicans. And the other issue we
have to fix is compensation. Um,
I did get Medicaid.
Uh, up to 150% of Medicare,
doubling it, uh, with David
Abbey starting out uh from the
and um and, and that's gonna
help, but actually the
specialists are only at 100% of
Medicare and Medicare nationally
keeps going down. So again, we,
we're gonna have to become more
creative, uh, because we just
don't have a commercial sector
to cost shift against for
Medicaid and Medicare.
And Madam chair, Senator, what?
Did we solve a problem.
With HP 75 those years ago that
sort of
Precipitated where we are today.
Did we solve a problem that is,
I guess what I'm trying to get
to is
For New Mexico medical providers
inherently less skilful.
Inherently
Um
growing higher damage awards are
they?
Are they of lower quality.
Then
our surrounding
days.
Man of chair and senator, um,
you know, that, that's always,
you know, question maybe.
Maybe there is more, but uh
there are some organizations who
are looking at New Mexico in
terms of are there more events
that that predispose that that
can be measured in hospitals,
error rates are JCHO uh Joint
Commission on Quality of care
for hospitals and you can look
at a number of things, but
basically, um,
We're pretty much the same as
the rest of the country in first
glance. Now, we're, we're
drilling into that to get more
data and, you know, and that
data is very useful cause it
helps point out where errors may
be, and again this could be
another use of that state fund,
say, wow, you know, this might
be an area where we could put
more money to resolve a
potential uh damaging situation.
Thank you, sir, for your
answers. Thank you.
Thank you.
Other questions?
your
I'm chairing and there's uh um
These may have been asked while
I was out of the room, but just
had a couple of questions, so if
I understand, understand this
care fund.
Um, it's 7525.
But can you explain to me what
the needs are for that fund?
Um, it was asked earlier about
the
Percentages and how much is
going to the state, could you
clarify that for me because I
didn't understand.
I transition coming back.
Madam Chair and Senator
Gallegos, we, we did cover this,
but it basically 75% of the
punitive damages would go into
the spun. This fund would be
used to
Intensely, the patient care
fund, which is going to be in
trouble in 207, because the
hospitals won't be paying into
it. This fund could make up some
of that difference, uh, this one
could also go to.
As I just said, if, if they're,
if we're finding in the reports
as hospitals are reviewed by the
Joint Commission and Medicaid
and Medicare if there are areas
of weaknesses that could go into
trying to document that, seeing
if there's a pattern, if there's
an underlying cause and then
trying to remedy that and also
and this is where I slipped, uh,
uh, my memory and and answering
a question earlier, uh, talking
about the establishment of
quality peer review, so many.
practitioners that work outside
of the hospital, so they aren't
having that peer review, and we
need to as a state set up some
sort of ambulatory care peer
reviewed, to be sure that our
clinicians who aren't routinely
being having their charts
reviewed, etc. uh, have some
sort of basis where they can
find uh real data and evidence
that they could improve their
practices.
Thanks for that matter chair and
ciders and just uh to sort of
get an understanding.
Do we have ranges for like
OBGYNs, what they pay for their
Um
Insurers currently, you know,
we're always talking about
losing docs, losing docs, losing
dogs.
I know that's one of the
The issues that they have
is as we go into lawsuits, their
costs keep increasing. Do we
have any
Any kind of numbers on that?
Madam Chair and Senator, I, I do
have uh some specific numbers
for Loveless health systems, uh,
in the past, uh,
5 years there, there are 4
years, I believe.
Um, the rates have gone up.
Uh, by over 50%, we know.
Uh, and actually let me, let me
turn to one of the experts.
Madam Chair and senators.
To answer
One question is when we received
the bill from our practice
premium, the two sections.
One is the policy covered
250,000.
The elements of surcharge for
patient compensation fund.
We know the patient compensation
fund will be increasing.
And since we are in a state of
high risk insurance company also
increase on malpractice premium.
So we got two tiers of increase
in premium make it close to the
impossible white too.
Lipi senator Mansion is a
difference between seeing a
private practice physician and
corporate physicians.
We need to make it more enticing
to retain and recruit private
practice physicians.
And this bill will help.
Because perception reality.
A physician.
Perceived that we are in a high
risk being sued and most likely
been settled.
The detrimental outcome is all
this action report on the
doctor's.
Uh, uh.
Precision data.
Dead of fate in the whole
nation. The fact the physician's
future employment.
So does hard risk.
We are the only state in the
Union using doctors.
Since the bill 4 years ago, we
lost 8.5% of active physicians.
The
louder.
We lost 8.5% of physicians in
New Mexico since 4 years ago.
The substantial.
If you don't do anything.
To retain and recruit physician,
we cannot afford losing another
8.5% in a few years.
The progression like this.
He was a me.
old enough to be under medical
care, but the difficulty to get
physician and take care of me.
After I served 30 years in
office.
This is something we think
about.
The bill does not discourage
patients to file a lawsuit.
In fact, the bill will
And hands.
Future expenses to be covered
under this bill for the
patients.
They have mentioned
Technology changes, treatment
options also improve in the
future.
If a young patient got injured.
If a lump sum payment deprives
them of future expenses for more
options of treatment.
This bill will protect the
patient of long term run.
And thus it's important, you
know, why do my apprentice
payment goes up, insurance
company was assess risk.
factors
And we are in a high risk
situation. That's why the
premium going up.
And that will stop a lot of
potential physicians coming and
we are losing physics.
I graduated from medical school
at UNM 1983.
Right now, only 25% of graduates
will stay in our state.
Majority of the time on
numerical residents.
An educated at UNL.
We're still losing 75% out of
state.
And this is a concern, why even
people thought life family link,
they still need to migrate out.
Because not a good situation to
practice in our state.
This detrimental to our public
health. It's not about just law
it is about public health in the
future.
Thank you Madam Chair.
Thinking men turned, thank you,
gentlemen. Uh, just for
For clarification, you had 30
years in Clovis.
Um, center and doctor.
Uh, do you know what the
Great is in Texas Clovis is
right there on the state line,
uh, we have a lot during COVID,
we had a lot of people lead Lee
County, where I live, and moved
into Texas to get education and
to be able to.
Um, have docs and other
Uh opportunities, but I was just
wondering since you're right
there, do you have any friends
that are in, in the profession
and you know how
How much the difference is.
Just across straight line.
Madam Chair, Senator.
For my specialty, I'm a general
surgeon to classify as a high
risk.
My friends and
Peter just close the stay and
love it.
They pay less than 1 quarter
what I'm playing for my friends.
I'm doing 4 times more.
4 times more. And since you
mentioned about Texas, they
changed our practice law 3 years
ago.
And 2 years ago the state bought
so proud to inform all the Texas
licensed physician, they had
10,000 new doctors.
They gained 10,000 new doctors
in one year in Texas.
So my pre law does affect
recruitment and retention of
physician.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
thanks sinners and and doctor
and, and I think that goes back
to the percentage of the
students.
They are leaving the state.
We come, doctor, and it's, it's
one of those things we've always
talked here at the legislature.
I opposed the free education for
all, without the caveat of 3 to
5 years of service back to the
state because we lose the
investment.
I lost that vote because it is
free.
My daughter's using it, my
granddaughter's too, but I still
think we need to have that hook
to keep them to get our
investment back, but I think
this proves right here that if
you were to go 1520 miles.
Further east
You'd be 4 times less than your
insurance and, and to me that is
the trick right here for me.
Because if we're going to keep
docs in our state, we need to do
something.
Major
People to provide the difference
because that is what's gonna
happen today, they have to
leave.
At that cost rate at that
difference, they have to leave
because they need to be
successful.
wherever they go, and the
hindrance that we put on you.
It's really hard to overcome, so
with that I'll yield and churn
centers in in both experts. I
appreciate it. I apologize for
being gone for some events of
this repetitive, I just want to
get those numbers to be able to
understand because I live in
Eunice for 4 miles from the
state line.
And it is critical.
But we have the same
opportunities.
As the dachcks in Texas. If not,
we will lose more.
And then what do we do?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
Thank you. Any other questions
from committee?
Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator.
Um
Why not abide by the previous
agreement, as I understand it,
only 5 senators voted against it
last time, so it sounded like it
had
The pork.
here.
Uh, I'm
Um, could you define last time,
uh, Senator Charlie, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair, the agreement that
we're currently operating in
now.
Well, there was the bill be a
chair and Senator Charlie.
There was uh uh because of
errors in the bill, um, a lot of
doctors wouldn't practice past
uh midnight on the 31st of
December as they were the way it
was written was huge risk that I
think was the, the fix that I
did not participate in those
negotiations, um.
And um
Uh, I, I think that the people
who negotiated the bill for, I
mean, we, we were right up
against the time, you know, it
was almost like a
Oh
It was
Something
did get worked out for that
time, but since then we've seen
this progression in a number of
suits and so forth. I can't, I
do not recall what the vote was
or wasn't at that time.
Sorry.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
I am curious if there's a doctor
shortage outside of Mexico just
in general.
Um, Senator Charlie and Madam
Chair, that's what's really
frightening.
Uh, New Mexico is pro is, is in
the worst shape of any state, no
question about it in terms of a
number of uh clinicians uh.
To the are very close to that.
But what's really scary is that
we are projected to be running
somewhere between 75 and
10,075,000 short nationally, um,
I think.
2032, uh, we are not, we are not
uh.
Generating enough medical
students and residencies, and
it's a big national problem,
yes.
Thinking that in turn, Senator.
Why?
Well, if I can figure out.
That why the federal government
in 1997 passed a law limiting
residencies and not thinking
about the impact of the baby
boom. Um, they, they didn't and
um and so we're now in this
desperate situation, uh, we can
go back to the 1928 when Blue
Cross was invented and there
were surgeons and so procedures
got paid more than primary care
when I went to medical school,
half of my class was primary
care, now less than 8% of
medical students go into primary
care. There's a lot of uh events
in the past that have
contributed to what is a
shortage today, no question.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. I think, I think
that's right, right. We're,
we're in this.
Crisis with everyone else in the
country right now, because of
the decisions that were made.
On the federal level, um,
25 years ago to reduce the class
size.
Um, of potential physicians
going into fields to raise um
salaries.
Um
We're not alone in that, madam
chair. And, and, um,
I think what we've heard.
Continuously is that New Mexico
is in the worst shape.
And we're not alone. There is a
doctor shortage across the
country right now.
It is not just us.
Um
Madam Chair and Senator, I kind
of want to switch gears and move
over to
Um, punitive damages. How many
cases in New Mexico.
have had punitive damages
awarded in the last year.
Um
I, I don't have that number at
my uh fingertips, um, I think in
time, probably we'll be looking
into that and be able to come up
with the objective data, um, in
New Mexico, uh, has two recent
cases, one against Gallup
Hospital for a botched hernia,
uh operation for 65 million. Um,
that's a lot, um, and that may
have been negotiated down that
we don't have.
Accessing that information and I
believe it was in
Late November, early December,
412 million, uh,
It
essentially
almost all that as I understand,
punitive damages against the
company that uh promoted uh male
products, but what is notable
about that is that um.
Uh, it's the largest settlement
ever to occur in the United
States at 412 million.
So that is kind of like, you
know, we, we get reputations for
stuff that kind of, that kind of
hangs out there. Uh, that didn't
help the, the cause, so to
speak, to attract people to the
state.
Um
Madam Senator, I completely
agree.
And when it comes to punitive
damages. I want to share with
you.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, and
Ms. Fisher.
Something one of your colleagues
told me today.
Literally today on the Senate
floor.
I had a question about punitive
damages. My question was, um,
that we're punitive damages
going right now.
And he said, well, first of all,
That's like winning the jackpot.
That's like winning the jackpot.
I, I, I, I was so offended. I
had to walk away.
Madam Cha
Because we heard in here on
Wednesday.
Patient stories.
Of what they went through.
That's like hitting the jackpot.
become paraplegic.
Is it like hitting the jackpot?
My aunt was one of the people
who testified here the other
day.
Her husband died.
He's no longer here and she's
going through life by herself
now.
That's like hitting the jackpot.
I don't think that's what
punitive damages are, madam
chair.
They're making a transition into
Um
lump sum.
Um, and the patient composition
fund.
Um, Madam Chair, and senator.
Can you explain to me and just
as simple as possible, um, madam
and Senator, how the patient
compensation fund works and
specifically um what the
hospital's deficit repayment is
in relation to the patient.
Compensation fund.
Madam Senator, could you repeat
the question, please?
mature about mature, um, I just
wanna to overall summary of like
what is the paycheck
compensation fund. Where did it
come from? How did we get here?
And specifically, what can you
speak about the hospital's
deficit repayment in relation to
the patient compensation.
Uh
I don't know the history of the
patient compensation fund. I
haven't been involved in it for
that lengthy period of time. Um,
the
How
works, yes.
Um, the patient compensation
funds pays the past and future
medicals.
Right.
Paced for past and future
medicals, they do not pay
punitive damages, um, they pay,
there's a cap on the amount of
compensatory damages they pay at
that cap is dependent on the
year of the um injury occurred.
Um
The hospitals, the hospitals are
classified separately from a
medical providers, doctors, um,
nurses, and they're, they pay a
different rate and to be a
member of the continent Patient
compensation fund, then the
doctors do. It's based on, it's
a calculation based on the
estimated claims given the
number of procedures that are
performed and then we determine
the, the, the amount that they
need to pay into the patient
compensation.
as I alluded to earlier, the, in
order to become a um uh a member
participant in of the patient
compensation, the doctors or the
hospitals, they have to carry an
underlying uh uh uh uh 200, it's
250 right now. I believe it's up
going.
500,000 for the 50 500,000 for
the um the hospitals. They have
to, they have to get coverage
for that they can pay, they can
give us office the
superintendent of deposit equal
to that amount, um, we don't
have any of those deposits, so,
so they secure medical
malpractice to cover that
initial um expense that they
would pay and then if the
damages exceed that, the the
compensatory damages and um send
the patient compensation fund.
of compensatory damages, and yet
we pay off past medicals and our
future medicals, uh, I, I, I
believe you referenced something
about um lump sum, lump sum is
generally um it was it mentioned
earlier is where the, there's a
um.
Of present value of the
estimated future medical
expenses that the individual
will incur and then that is paid
in a lump sum of of payment.
Aamer Senator and um expert,
thank you.
So, let me just reflect back to
you. I think my understanding of
the compensation, um, the
patient compensation fund is a
fund that was established for
insurance um companies and
hospitals to pay into in the
event of
A patient being injured.
Madam Chair, senators, um, it
wasn't established initially the
hospitals were not eligible to
become members of the patient
compensation fund, they just
became uh were eligible to
become members, um, several
years ago, I believe.
2006 or 2007.
Um, so it wasn't established uh
to benefit insurance companies.
It was established to make sure
there was money available to
compensate the injured party.
And also hopefully hold down
medical malpractice premiums.
Madam Chair, senator and expert,
but isn't that what the patients
are suing for.
is to be made whole.
I guess I'm asking, Madam Chair,
why we need the fund.
Yeah, I'm sure, um, senator,
uh,
the
Theory behind damages is that
the injured party will be made
whole.
Um
From the amount that they
recover.
Madam Chair, Senator,
But not through insurance,
through this fund.
If
I share, um, Senator, if the the
entity whether it's a physician
or a hospital, um.
participate in the fund they
receive money from the fund,
the, the in part.
I don't know if I can explain
any better, but what it is, they
carry a, a, a personal policy.
Up to so much damage.
compensation fund.
Pats over them.
So it's, it's a two-tiered deal.
So the face of compensation, am
I right? The patient
compensation fund.
Is, is what is paid.
Well, will cover the cost that
their personal.
Liability insurance doesn't pay.
So if it's a
And that's why this is present
language in the bill.
that you see here.
That's, that's actual languages
in the bill. That's not new
language.
That's, that's what it is right
today.
So this is a, this is on top.
Of what the doctor carries in
malpractice insurance. That's
why Doctor Kle was telling you
it's a two-tier.
policy.
It's not just one tier policy.
And
What happens
He's got to maintain so much
coverage.
To be in the front.
become, so he's got to maintain
so much coverage.
And what's happening as risk
goes up.
His cost of carrying that
coverage goes up.
That's where it's driving.
The, the
The cost of the insurance.
It's not, he's still carrying a
half a million dollars or
whatever it is.
But the policy cost goes up.
And that's what he's talking
about, the medical malpractice
costs going up.
And then this, this fund here is
a fund that covers.
Patience, compensation.
More of an umbrella.
On top of that
So but
Yeah,
sir, am I understanding that
right?
I'm sure.
Could you turn your microphone
on, please. Thank you. I'm sure
Senator, um, that, that is
accurate. It's a two-tier, um,
structure the um individual or
the hospital that wants to
participate if I has to carry a
medical malpractice up to the
required.
explore um 250.
And, and
If they become a member of the
patient compensation fund
patient compensation fund will
then.
damages above that amount.
But if there's a claim against a
physician or the hospital, they
need to leave.
Initial $250,000 comes from
their medical malpractice
provider.
Madam Chair and senators and
experts, thank you. I, I, I
understand it now. OK. And, and
what I also understand is that
this fund was established to
help independent doctors keep
their, uh,
premiums low. Is that correct?
Yeah.
Uh, Madam Chair and senator.
Uh, no, the patient compensation
fund actually was started in
1976, uh, New Mexico was in a
major malpractice crisis back at
that time. And so, uh
Other states have patient
compensation funds, about 14 of
them, if I recall correctly, and
it's a way, it's put there to be
sure that that while there are
compensatory damages which are
different.
The this the patient
compensation fund pays for
health care to care for the
damages, however long that may
be if it's a young person at 20
and they live to 80, then, but
then it's something that
continues, uh, to like if there
was
Uh, a,
a leg that wasn't set right or
what have you, and that led to a
hip and other things later, that
gets covered by this fund so
that it was established to
protect the patient from not
there not being money through
the initial settlement so that
it could go on and um and I
think we heard if I heard
correctly, uh, Senator Charlie
and Madam Chair, there's about
212 million in in that fund now,
uh, to.
Uh cover uh patients and the uh
future. mhm.
Madam Charan, Senator, um,
And these
We're overrun by private equity
hospitals.
And they not afford?
To pay out these damages from
the billions of dollars that
they rake in, Ma.
Why I, I got on this bill.
It's because I've got small
rural hospitals. I live way out
in the country.
So do I, madam
and
because of that, to get health
care out there
incucurion and Clay.
Those, those hospitals.
are not making any money.
They're, they're, they're county
owned hospitals.
They're not making any money.
And one cost they have that has
just skyrocketed.
is medical malpractice.
And
They, they went to 4 times what
they were paying.
And the claims haven't gone up.
But the risk is gone.
No
A good actuarial.
I tell you
That claims
is what drives the fallacy up.
But it's the atmosphere we've
got in New Mexico.
And I'm not trying to bash.
attorneys
I am telling you.
The, the atmosphere.
Of settlements in our state is
driving risk.
It's not the, the, the, the
claim itself.
The frequency of the claim.
It is just the
Overall
Atmosphere, the, the, the, the
knowledge of what a settlement
might be.
And, and all of a sudden,
They, they had a, a, a union.
Hospital and it was in the
newspaper not too long ago.
I don't know if y'all saw it.
But
They was going to have to close
their doors.
If the state didn't come in and
help them, and we passed a bill.
A couple of years ago to do
that.
help those small hospitals.
10 or 12 hospitals.
We, we, we helped save those
hospitals.
Yeah
The the the main trouble with
those hospitals.
Is the fairer mix, they call it.
Because you got so much
Medicare, so much Medicaid, and
then private pay. If you've got
a pretty high part private pay
insurance?
The hospital can function.
But if you're patients are down
here on the Medicaid and
Medicare.
And even that makes.
As you know, we tried to bring
those Medicaid premiums up to
150 of Medicare.
You remember that?
From last year, why did we do
that? Because we were starving
these small hospitals out.
Because their mix was off.
And when you say, well, it's a
mix of a nation.
You know what's the trouble with
healthcare?
We're a mix of a nation.
And
New Mexico was very different
than, than a lot of people.
We're high coverage state.
And because of that,
The reimbursement rate
was so low
The hospitals in the, in the
location influx in rural areas.
They they couldn't make a
living.
I was fixing to close hospitals,
and these were county supported
hospitals. These weren't.
The corporate hospitals that you
that you're talking about.
And that's my life. That's my
world.
My world is not Albuquerque or
Stanmoe.
My world is so far out in the
country that
I have to borrow a tom cat.
It's.
Madam Tare Senator, I appreciate
that so much, and
Didn't answer my question.
Um
Can be billion dollar insurance
companies that are raking in
profits.
Afford to pay their share.
That's yes or no.
Uh man chair and uh Senator
Charlie.
These in billion dollar
insurance companies that are
raking in the profits.
I do understand medical loss
ratio when I talked about the
ratio earlier, Senators profit
margin, Madam Chair. Yeah, the,
the, the medical loss ratio. I
mean, insurance companies are,
for every dollar that they get
paid in premium, they're losing
$1.83. So I don't think they're
raking in billions of dollars
and I, the, and are you
Conflating or confusing.
Health insurance companies who
do make billions of dollars,
United Healthcare,
not, not so much I'm talking
about the private equity
hospitals that have come into
our state to take advantage of
Our poor, vulnerable communities
that I don't disagree with,
with, um, Senator Woods that
we're, we're a poor state. We
are a poor state.
And, and when, and when you have
vulnerable population, they are
often we are often subject to
people coming in and taking
advantage.
It's just what happens. It
doesn't just happen in
healthcare. It happens
everywhere.
Christunity, I think is what
it's called.
Um
But just to go back, Madam Chair
and Senator to, um, Senator
Woods. I also live.
out in the middle of nowhere.
I live in the country. I can see
the Milky Way every single
night. I don't have neighbors.
Um
And my community and a lot of
the communities I represent are
reliant on rural hospitals.
And also the Indian Health
Service.
Which is subject to the tort
Claims Act.
Which operates on the same lines
as we're trying to move toward
with this legislation.
But a 25% cap on attorney fees.
I can tell you what that means.
That means attorneys will not
take.
A medical malpractice lawsuit.
I don't want for this, listen,
I'm speaking from experience.
I don't want this state.
To have the same kind of
healthcare that we have on the
reservation.
My dad had a toothache a couple
of years ago.
You know what they did at Indian
Health Service to save money.
They pulled out all of his
teeth.
And because he didn't have one
of his daughters there.
say, Dad, you don't need to do
that.
I know what it's like.
To go to a hospital and receive
care.
Or a lack of care.
From an institution that has the
rates that we're trying to
Advocate for here.
That's what it means to come
from the districts that I serve,
Madam Chair and Senator.
Um
I just wanna
Make another point here about
the correlation between medical
malpractice and private equity
owned hospitals.
The private equity owned
hospitals, which we here in New
Mexico have the highest rate of
per capita.
Um
It means we're turning through
Patience.
Quality of care goes down.
Oversight goes down.
We've turned it into a mill.
And I, and I don't blame our
doctors. I, I really don't,
they, they've had to make tough
just my, my primary care doctor
I shared this a while ago. She
had to move to um Optum.
I've been with her for over 10
years, and I sought her out
because she was a woman of
color.
And she owned her own practice.
Over 10 years I've trusted my
doctor.
She moved to Optum.
I went and I was trying my
hardest to bring up my health
issues.
Um, I went in for an annual
checkup and had kind of
Worked up the courage to share.
I have, I've been diagnosed with
depression.
And I need medication.
But it's the last thing I wanted
to say.
I couldn't even get to that
point before she said we're
gonna need to schedule you
another appointment to come in
this month. I can't enter this
much into your
Into your um
One appointment here.
Luckily I was able to get in
with her again, because I have
been with her for over 10 years,
a virtual appointment.
And she was able to prescribe me
the medication that I need, but
I know what it's like to, to
grow up in the Indian Health
Service where you, where you're
trying to take us.
To going to a doctor that has
made the time.
And space to actually care for
me.
Over to being bought out by a
private equity hospital.
And it's not her fault. I love
her.
Um, and she's been great to me
and my family over the years.
I share that
Because that's what we're
experiencing.
When people are calling and
emailing in about I can't get a
doctor's appointment.
You can only see me for 15
minutes, and you can only enter
in so many issues for that
visit.
Um
So anyhow,
We have the highest per capita
private equity operated
hospitals.
And when you're just turning out
hair like that.
We have more injuries because
people make mistakes and they
have oversight.
And things happen. And so then
that's why we have an increase
of lawsuits.
And so Madam Chair, this, it
just, it goes so much deeper
than um than just, you know,
trial lawyers are trying to make
money here.
And if they get a punitive
damage, they've hit the jackpot.
Um, Madam Charing Senator, would
lawyers be suing if there was
not caused.
Why the lawyers do.
Uh, Madam Chair and senator, uh,
again, if, uh, we go through the
history here, but we have
created a board of doctors and
lawyers, and it is in the law
that no case can go to trial
until it's reviewed by that
board.
And uh the, if you talk to, I've
talked to the CEOs and CEOs of
of all the large groups and they
tell me that, uh, cases get
brought, they're found to be
without merit by that board and
then they go and say, well,
we're gonna take it to trial
anyway, and so that's what's
leading to this bad loss ratio
is you have to defend those
tribes. But then they say, and
we'll do punitive damages when
There's no merit. This board,
doctors and lawyers, there's no
merit, and then they threaten
the punitive damages, and so
they settled, and they make, you
know, whatever.
So, that's part of the problem
in this uh behind why we are
having.
The large number of cases, the
highest per 100,000 in the
country, and, and they're being
registered when there's no
merit.
To the cakes
So if you're a doctor, again,
I'll go back to you, why would
you come to a state?
where you can get that smear on
your record undeserved.
Which they're getting here in
New Mexico.
So that, that, that's a big
reason why and then the problem
is we, as we have fewer doctors
and I know that the doctors,
primary care are, are very, uh,
feel pretty overwhelmed and
trying to keep up with and how
do you, you know, the
Is it 15 minutes or 0 minutes?
Uh, I mean, it's, it's, it's a
tough place to be in,
particularly if you're, if
you're a doctor, there's no
question about it.
So, um, no one, you know, wants
to work like that, but then when
we can't attract anyone, then it
becomes even worse for the
physician.
Because they have to see more
people or you get into like uh
one.
Uh, single specialty group, they
have 2000 patient backlog.
2000 patient backlog because
their peers in that specialty
have left the state.
I'll wrap it up, Madam, um.
What I know from
My experience and the experience
of those that I care about and
that testified here.
Was that
It costs a lot of money and
takes a lot of courage to step
forward and try to hold the
system.
Many of the patients who are
wronged could not do that on
their own. You just cannot
afford to do that.
Um
We need comprehensive insurance.
Reform
Not just on the state level, on
the federal level.
We have groups of people being
pitted against each other right
now.
We're actually in the same
fight.
And it's the insurance
companies.
Who are winning.
At all of our expense.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator, Senator
Novi.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator for bringing the
bill forward. I do have a few
questions. Um,
I'll start off with, uh, just,
uh, Madam Chair, Senator, does
this bill do anything to address
the patient injury rate or
health disparities in hospitals
that serve communities of color.
Uh
Did you want to answer
I don't have an answer for that.
I
I don't have an answer for that
because you see,
I know that you look at things.
On a
I
On a different line than I do.
I look at
People
I
Poor people, I know there's
middle class people, I know
there's rich people.
I don't look at the color of
their skin.
Because I look at people.
And I know I'm going to make
people mad in here today.
We have to think about New
Mexico as being
A state of people.
Not a state of color.
We
We have, we, everything y'all
described today.
has been about the lack of
doctors in the state.
Everything you have said.
It's because we don't have
enough doctors in the state.
Why did Texas get 10,000 doctors
in here.
And we lose that.
8.5% a year.
3 years, how much is that? 324.
25.5% less doctor.
What happens then?
All of a sudden
Some corporate deal comes in and
they say, all right, 5 minutes
to finish.
lamin,
yeah, a lot more chances.
A mistakes, right? A lot more
chances.
But even worse than that.
Now the big deal is TAs.
Now one doctor can oversee.
20 PAs.
Now a PA.
is a life sin to the rural
community.
But they're not medical doctors.
days
And
That's what our health care has
come into.
I'm sorry
I'm sorry that you don't like my
bill.
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry,
Madam Chair. I'm sorry, Senator,
I never said I don't like your
bill. Well, but
We're losing doctors.
And I'm trying to figure out a
way.
To bring doctors back for
everybody.
Sorry, I, I'm, I'm, I'm
preacher.
Madam Ch you please to go
through the chair.
Of
Thank you.
And I'm chair, Senator, thank
you.
I will clarify, Senator, that I
do not, Madam Chair, I do not
look at things from a different
lens. I look at things from my
lived experience.
And people as a whole.
Yes, sir.
Yes, Madam Chair, communities.
People who need access.
But I also
Experience where not all people
have the same access.
And that's a reality, Madam
Chair. And I have several
questions, but I'm gonna have to
divert into the reality, Madam
Chair of.
Someone who underwent.
A big procedure.
One random day, massive
headache. Turns out I had a
brain tumor.
This is not what I intended to
do, by the way, Madam Chair, to
speak about this, but because I
think some folks believe that we
see through.
things through a different
manner and that we're not
looking at New Mexico as a
whole. I want to ensure folks
that we do.
Regardless of the color of our
skin or where we come from.
Or a cultural background, we
look at New Mexico, Madam Chair,
and at our communities as a
whole to ensure that we're
serving.
And I come from a poor family,
Madam Chair.
A family who doesn't all speak
English.
I land in the urgent care. They
say I have a brain tumor the
size of a large golf ball.
14 days in the hospital.
Presbyterian UNM.
Madam Chair.
All the uncertainties of a
lifetime that I'd never thought
I would get to expect to to live
at that time in 2021.
And I sat on the hospital bed,
ma'am.
Not gonna cry.
Here you go. Thank you, ma'am.
Madam Chair, I sat on the
hospital bed, thinking about my
parents and thinking about what
if it had been them.
They couldn't communicate with
folks.
They tell you your life is on
the line and you, you don't know
if you're gonna make it the day
after, ma'am.
Madam Chair, I saw health care
through a very different lens.
And thankfully, I had a fabulous
neurosurgeon.
Well until today is one of my
bestest friends.
And Madam Chair, Senator, my
neurosurgeon left New Mexico.
And it wasn't because of me.
It was because of rising crime,
because of other issues that he
dealt with in the state, Madam
Chair, and I tell you that,
Madam Chair and Senator, to, to
acknowledge the fact that
New Mexico issues abroad. We are
a low income, we are a poor
state. We have many low-income
communities. We do struggle and
represent different types of
communities, rural, urban.
Madam Chair and senator.
But at the end of the day, we
are all communities that have
need of healthcare and health
care access, and I literally
And coming into this role.
That was one of my prime things
that I spoke to my constituents
about ensuring that we're
recruiting and retaining medical
professionals that we are
growing our own, Madam Chair.
But when I look at the bill,
Madam Chair, and I look at this.
On the first page immediately
requiring 75% of the punitive
damages awarded in medical
malpractice claims to be awarded
to the state. Madam Chair,
senators, I want to know where
the patient is in all of this.
Madam Chair and senators.
I want to acknowledge the fact
that there is no equity across
the state for healthcare access.
The people who are most
vulnerable are not sitting in
this room right now.
They don't have access, they
can't be spending their time
sitting here with us, Madam
Chair.
And on behalf of those voices
and those people who cannot be
here. I want to ensure that they
are here and at the table.
I want to ensure that we're
investing in our state and in
medical professionals here,
ensuring that we do have them
return, ensuring that we do
recruit them.
My sister-in-law.
graduated from UN a medical
school, a DACA recipient, an
OBGYN.
Now doing her residency at Rush.
She's coming back because she
loves New Mexico.
So how can we incentivize folks
to come back? How can we work
together to actually address the
issues because you never know
when you're gonna end up with a
brain tumor or something else.
And sitting in those hospital
beds is not anything I wish upon
anyone, Madam Chair.
But it is something that makes
me look at healthcare in a very
different lens.
Because I had access and I had a
healthcare insurance that paid,
helped me pay for my big brain
surgery that I had, but not
everyone has the same privilege
and access, Madam Chair.
My father, an immigrant who
works construction fell off of
the ladder ladder, Madam Chair,
a year and a half ago, 15 ft in
the air.
Downtown Santa Fe.
No insurance, no nothing.
His entire leg was shattered.
3 surgeries that he needed to
have.
That was not anything I wish
upon anyone.
Being stuck in those situations
are not things that patients are
asking for, Madam Chair.
And I hope that we can truly
come to a solution in a way that
acknowledges all of the parties
that are affected here.
We need more doctors. We need to
also ensure that our patients
are OK and that they get the
support that they need when they
fall into these situations that
they are not asking for.
So with that
Madam Chair and senator.
I just like to ask one more
question.
Can you tell us if punitive
damages the ward, um.
If taking the punitive damages
award, uh, that from patients
will result in less harm to
patients in New Mexico.
I'm sure Senator, the way that
the bill is structured, that's
75% would go into a patient
safety improvement fund. That
would be at the discretion of
the legislature to appropriate
via the Department of Health for
whatever the legislature feels
would improve patient safety. It
would be up to the legislature
to decide that.
Madam Chair, uh, expert, thank
you very much for that. Um,
And you don't think that's a
bureaucratic process for these
patients that need the funds
immediately.
Oh, Madam Chair, Senator, the
patients received the
compensatory damages to
compensate for them for harm.
The punitive damages is really
about punishment. It is about
saying this medical practitioner
did something that was so
egregious, so above and beyond
what they should have been
doing, that they need to be
punished. So that really isn't
about compensating for the harm
that is about punishing
wrongdoing, and so that is why 3
states and we're proposing with
this bill have said a portion of
that should go to the patient,
essentially, uh.
To incentivize them to punish
that wrongdoing, but a portion
of it should also go to the
state and in this case to
prevent future harm.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you expert. I appreciate that.
I, I see your point. Um, I am
still deeply concerned about the
amount of funds that would go
into this uh into um this
compensation fund. Um, I think
there's lack of specificity in
terms of the definitions as
well. And I really believe that
we need to acknowledge.
Pieces of legislation that are
needed to ensure that we are
continuing to grow our medical
professionals that we're, that
we're investing in them, that we
are providing access and also
recruitment tactics from working
with our institutions to making
them and help them return home
to serve our communities, um,
and I just don't see this piece
of legislation doing that. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you.
Senator Pinto
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
sponsors.
Can you tell us what the highest
premiums are in New Mexico.
I sure son are you asking for,
for specialty?
That just some data.
I ain't close.
Oh
Uh, for
The surgeon that used to be
around $20,000 to $100,000
general surgeon, OBGYN used to
be 20 to 30, and now it's well
over 100,000.
And um, Madam chair and sponsors
and where is the data coming
from?
Uh, this data comes from uh some
doctor groups or people who are
here, um, if you, if you want
them to uh talk about uh their.
The malpractice cause for
general surgery, uh, we did
listen to the head of uh women
specialists in New Mexico. They,
um,
Uh, the lay head of, of the
group um and about their
premiums going up to $100,000.
So Madam Chair, and is this
pertaining just to New Mexico.
Me your center, yes, this is
specific to New Mexico
providers.
And Madam Chair and sponsors,
what do they do with the
premiums?
Madam Cur Center, the premiums
go to the insurance companies,
the insurance companies, um, use
them to run their operations and
they pay out claims.
So, Madam Chair, um,
So they just take this money and
put it back out.
Well, Madam Center, as, as with
any insurance company, they
collect money in premiums and
then they pay out claims as
those occur.
So Madam Chair uh sponsors, it's
my collection that they
invested.
No.
but I'm sure Senator, I'm, I'm
not familiar with how insurance
companies run their operations,
but that would make sense.
Thank you. And Madam Chair, um,
sponsors.
So there's no real data saying
that they're, they're this high
cause we're, we're, it's an
assumption said by someone
coming in testifying of what
they pay.
But we don't have an average for
the whole state, high or low.
Um, we don't know how many
insurance providers there are in
New Mexico, um, and the point
I'm getting to is, I don't think
this issue really has been
studied deep enough.
Because when we talk about the
premiums of insurance companies
and anything relating to the
stock market or any kind of
market and our
you right now, currently, and
much of the uh disasters that
happen nationally, I would say
the insurance companies, um,
even those that buy insurance.
All right, seeing premiums go up
for everything.
And a lot of it too is
fluctuation in the market.
Because you are required to
invest those dollars and try to
come up with the
Be sorrow I can receive um as
they pull it together.
And if we don't have enough
insurance premium providers in
the state of Mexico, and I could
see how the market when we talk
about supply and demand, um,
becomes an issue as far as.
Now, Texas was mentioned.
When you
And go in there and, well, I
want to become a doctor. Let me
find out where the cheapest
school is in the US to go to med
school.
I think almost all the top 6 are
in Texas.
So, how are we as a state.
Trying to do something in the
math, can we speak to exactly um
what our loan repayment.
Its for doctors here in New
Mexico.
Madam Fa and Senator, uh, thank
you for bringing that up. There
is a bill, I think Doctor or
Senator Brant is carrying it.
Um.
Our state currently has pretty
low.
um
Uh, reimbursement for loans for
medical school. Um, I think it's
like $25,000 a year for 3 years
and students are coming out of
medical school and residency
with 34 $500,000 in loans, um,
Senator Brant's bill would pay
up to 75,000 a year, um, for,
uh, I think 4 years and uh and
that gets to be very
competitive, and I, I hope we
get that.
bill passed so that we do
compete with other states and
also have the.
We're kind of in the middle in
terms of, of how we do that, but
with the national shortage that
we talked about, it's gonna get
more competitive uh with other
states. So I certainly hope we
pass uh that bill uh right now,
if you are in New Mexico State
resident, the tuition is $20,000
a year. Um,
But it's the living expenses
that
Then drive up, and I know a
number of uh students who have
finished and, and God bless him
have decided to stay in New
Mexico and um but they're paying
off these 340 $500,000 loans.
Uh, over time and
So, that, that's what, so I, I,
you know, hopefully, you know,
we need to do something now and
this is a now type of thing that
we can do. And again, we have to
remember, and the, the issue of
crime, education, there are lots
of other issues, compensation I
talked about there we're going
to have to address that, uh, but
the malpractice environment is,
is another very uh
Ser issue that we don't compare
well with other states on. So,
um, we've got to address all
those issues and as I said, the,
the elephant is, uh, you know,
moving past the throat to the
larynx of the snake and as it
does, um, the demand for care is
going way outstrip, but we can
supply, so.
passing that bill, the GRT,
there are a number of other
things that would be very
helpful.
Madam Chair and sponsors.
So what else, um, besides just
the, the
factor of the doctor.
Being factored as the premium.
What other things could come in
play as far as acting a premium.
Yeah, other things that could
come into play is the
Right now we lead the nation in
in number of cases where there's
a settlement, a payout, uh,
double the national average if
we with this law or some other
laws, um, that would go a long
way towards lowering the premium
and being a more attractive
state.
Madam Chaon sponsors.
Robus
Hospital
I believe had a breach.
hacked, whatever you want to
call it, um.
And um came a liability. Is this
one of the issues factored into
the premium.
Madam Chair and and Senator, I,
uh,
I, I can't speak to that. I'm
not an expert in um
Accident that occurred, um,
The and and what the liabilities
are around that or that goes
into prem these premiums are all
based.
On injuries to patients, not.
the other
Uh, risk that the, the, uh,
hospital or any business house.
So, um, I can't tell you I would
doubt that they breach of their
IT is something that uh drives
up premiums because again, they
have other insurance that covers
that, that covers IT breaches,
as almost every company that
uses IT does.
Madam Chair and sponsors, though
you could not really say that.
It's just the premium, premium
of this cost that it could also
be.
The other insurance costs.
That are covered by other
insurance policies that the
entities have to pay, but not
this particular one is a cost
they have to cover.
You're saying there's other
costs they have to cover, not
this particular premium.
Well, I don't understand how the
insurance company will have to
raise the premium.
As a practicing surgeon, all I
know is we are still a high
risk.
And that's why the film is going
up.
I can speak as a presidential
surgeon in the past.
The keep going up.
compensation fund.
That would discourage anybody to
stay or come here. My previous
two honorable senator mentioned
they lost their primary care
doctor.
Due to changes of practice
environment.
And this is a concern we talk
about patient accessibility.
I'm not interested expert.
utmost surgeon.
I can tell my personal
experience, it came to be very
difficult to a private practice
to a wide better immediate care
to my patients.
I hope Senator, you think about
it.
On a personal standpoint.
Since I moved back to
Albuquerque after my retirement.
I can even make an appointment
to find a primary care doctor.
I provide care for 30 years in
rural area.
Returned to this big city of the
state, and I cannot get a
primary care physician
appointment.
What happened is we are
totallytaffed by medical
professionals.
Can we do something to improve
that for the well-being of our
citizens. Thank you.
So Madam Chan.
And sponsors.
There seems to be quite a few
unknowns and what we don't know
about insurance premiums.
And in that too, when you talk
about risk and those that are
high risk, especially for
surgeons. Thank you for what you
did.
But
Technology.
technology and where we're at.
Um, the state of New Mexico and
some of our health facilities.
in particular, especially to
IHS.
is not very high, or not very
great. I don't really think, I
don't even think we've ever had
a bill or any kind of funding
that actually kind of invested
even though we have all this
plethora of oil and gas money,
um, to increase that.
Decrease the risk.
To make sure that the doctors
that anybody in the health
profession will want to come to
this state to work here because
we are the best and we give them
everything they need to provide
the service that they are trying
to provide to our patients,
which is health and safety and
welfare of
And but we don't do it.
We haven't done as far as I, I
understand.
Saying, well, the doctors are
leaving just because of this.
Well,
If it's really about the
financial strain.
Well maybe it's because they
can't afford the technology.
Maybe they can't upgrade their,
their facilities.
And so there are strapping every
penny and this might not just be
the only thing that is worrying
them because there's a risk to
with contamination, um, and even
this state of where we're at.
But I haven't heard anybody
mention COVID.
And this population and where we
are, everybody that was affected
as far as I can understand, has
some long-term effects from
that.
So it's not just about the
population. It's all these risk
factors.
Right now we got a dust storm
going on, I wouldn't be
surprised if we see a rise in
people with asthma in there.
There's many, many factors in
this. We're trying to pick one
and say, well, this is just
about the premium, and this is
what's
our doctors out.
They want a lot more for their
families to be here.
Um
And patience too.
You know, I know I ain't just,
we don't really have some really
great patient in that sense, but
when those waiting periods are
so long.
Um
It is crucial that we do get
doctors who, I don't think we're
investing in doctors.
Like we should
We're not giving them
Um
The, the, the, but they really
need here in New Mexico.
Um, thank God we have the
compact.
I wasn't in favor of because I
don't think we were doing enough
for our doctors, but.
Now we have to come back, so
you're still gonna have to
travel and go out of there.
And those instances of what is
happening.
And those other states, they
say, well, people are leaving,
um,
I haven't seen a study.
I don't know if anybody's really
gone out to compile the data,
um, on this. Take a deeper look
at it.
As far as I understand, where we
talk about health care, um, in
this state malpractices the
four-letter word nobody wants
it. Mention and nobody wants to
really work together to find
Um, better ways to bring doctors
in here. We're just still
putting stuff out there.
Oh
That's all I have that too.
Thank you, Senator.
For a second time, we have
Senator Gallegos.
And I hope we keep it brief,
please, because we still have
some other legislation to go
through tonight. Madam is just
going to move too fast for me.
Oh, OK.
There's a motion for a new pass.
Is there a second?
A second from Senator Scott.
There's still discussions,
Senator Scott, you would ask for
a second time also, or?
You're good? OK.
And um
With that what you call the?

Senator Hickey
Yes.
love this.
No, and to explain their vote,
Senator Charlie, thank you,
Madam Chair. Um, I cannot get
past the comment that was made
to me this morning on the Senate
floor about hitting the jackpot
with punitive damages was a
blow.
Um
And it's just, it's been with me
all day, Madam Chair.
Um, that is not
They
No victim.

To be accused.
of benefiting from
Trying to, to, to make
themselves whole again.
After the unspeakable happens.
Adam Chair. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Gallegos.
Madam Chair and senators, I want
to thank you and your experts.
I, I thought this is a really
well rounded meal, 23 sponsors,
12 R's, 11 T's, 9 Hispanic, 5
which were Democrats or that
were Republicans, one Native
American.
And even with the balanced bill.
It's still hard for us to
protect our doctors. I think
we'll fill this for years to
come.
But I thank you for your trying
everything you possibly could do
the right thing by our.
Without a. Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, Senator Nava.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Senators, thank you for bringing
the bill forward.
I agree that we need to ensure
that we're recruiting and
retaining medical professionals
and that we create pathways for
more opportunities, but I just
do not agree with the way the
bill is written, and I want to
ensure that the voices of
patients are at the table when
these things are being crafted
and when we uh are I I would
hope that we take them into
account and that we acknowledge
and respect their lenses. Um,
thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
Thank you and by a vote of 5 in
opposition or in favor.
Senate Bill 176 failed to pass.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, if this is OK, I,
uh,
I got my questions answered
about that, um,
Compact. And so I, I wouldn't
mind if, if you want to put it
back. I, I, like I said, there
are a couple of questions I have
that were stopping me from
voting yes and I got the answer.
OK.
So with that, then we'll put
Senate Bill 502 back on for
consent agenda.
So Senate Bill 502.
If I could please ask you to
carry your conversation outside.
We still have other bills to
hear this evening.
I appreciate everyone's patience
today.
But if you could carry your
conversations outside. Thank
you.
We still have a few more bills
to go through.
We're gonna go back to consent
agenda just to finish one more.
OK, for members?
Originally we had on the
consented genus.
Consent agenda, Senate Bill 502
speech language pathologist
licensure.
Sponsored by Senator Scott.
Uh, Senator Sah Lopez had a few
questions, and it's my
understanding that there was
discussion.
So
He has removed her objections.
Um, so for committee members,
once again Senate Bill 502.
I if you could call the role.
Hispan of Senator B block.
I
Senator Boone is excused.
Senator Charlie, yes.
you gave
Senator Nova, yes.
Senator Pinto.
His
Us
Senator Scott.
Senator Cedillo Lopez.
Yes.
Senator Hickey.
Yes
And Senator Lopez.
Yeah.
I vote is 8.
In favor
He knows and two excused Senate
Bill 502 um has a due pass.
We finished our consent agenda.
And again, it's the intent of
the chair that hopefully about
nine-ish tonight, 9:30, we can
finish our committee.
Um
What I'm looking at and
I know we have some state
representatives who've been and
out, in and out tonight.
So
Uh, Representative de la Cruz.
House Bill 22.
And yes, the chair is going to
skip over her bill to allow you
to present your bill.
So please House Bill 22.
Proceed, Madam, please do. I
want to thank you and, and also
happy to see you well and taking
care of business in this.
in this committee, but I'm sure
I'm gonna apologize first to the
entire committee because my
expert who is representative
Joshua Hernandez couldn't be
here. However, I will do the
very best that I can, man.
A chair HB 22 is a bill that is
an effort to ensure that tipped
workers.
are able to keep the total sum
of their tips that they earned.
Presently New Mexico along with
a few other states. I do not
have a prohibition on an
establishment who wants to pay
their the card fees. Now we're
not talking about cash, but I'm
sure we're talking about card
fees.
They you that establishment can
literally take part of the
tipped the earth tipped money
and use it towards the cost of
the car expense. This bill would
disallow that and allow our tip
workers to keep the the total
sum of their of their tips. Man
with a yield.
Hm
Thank you, Representative. Is
there anyone in the audience in
support of House Bill 22.
Anyone in opposition.
Is there anyone on Zoom?
No, in favor or against?
No.
Is it Friday night?
No, I'm sorry.
OK. That happened last Friday
night too.
OK, so with that, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Senator Pinto
um, my chair and uh
representative.
This
You're saying that the
card fee.
So are they gonna sign a paper
or how are we gonna enforce
that?
Madam chair, the, the
establishments would be no
longer allowed to program and
it's actually programmed into
the machine itself at certain
establishments, so they are able
to do that. We would have to,
uh, assure or enforce that that
is no longer the case.
To, Madam Chan and
representative.
Madame Sir, this is why I needed
my expert Josh Hernandez, that
was, that was his, his aspect of
this particular thing. My
understanding is that we would
have to as part of the.
Has, uh
Eff of the state be able to
review those mechanisms, those
machines, and ensure that
they're not programmed to
deduct.
Some chair and representative
out.
You can send somebody around and
have the the.
The US police, but
Mountur it's a good question. I
am at a disadvantage.
So Madam Chair and
representative.
Because there are establishments
that um and I don't think
they're always open about it.
Uh, I don't recall, I don't even
think we have any um legislation
that requires them at the door
to
say that they are, if you use a
card, you're gonna have to pay
3% more of your, your what,
whenever your total is, um,
It's not every establishment is
like that, but I don't think we
have.
require them to do that, do we?
Ma I'm sure senator, so not
every establishment does that.
But right now there's no
prohibition to do that.
This bill would disallow that.
Now, that percentage at 3%, they
can use the the tipped workers'
fees, I mean tips to pay for
that and that.
That is the nick amount in time.
So Madam Chair and so.
Have anybody really here and
support or opposition, so
Who's who's supporting this bill
to Fernande that from a business
perspective or from the.
To the employees or thank you,
ma'am. So I will tell you that
the Restaurant Association is in
favor of this. They don't have a
problem with it, and I think
that was a big aspect of this
bill. We passed the two House
committees because we actually
had the restaurant association
there. This evening, we don't
have that, and I don't have my
expert.
So Madam Chair and
representative. I think that's
one of the things that probably
should be attached to the bill
is that the establishment
require to under daughter before
even um
Consuming or that you're aware
that they're gonna charge you 3%
fee if you pay with the card.
Because
It's
Um
Its caught me off guard
sometimes if that was the case,
then I would rather pay cash,
especially if I met it.
But
What happens too if they don't
know that.
And the establishment is still
Um, charging the 3% if they pass
it on to the consumer is
That I will bless.
Thinking that, oh, this is what,
this is my total bill now, but
I'm still gonna put this this
much in, but they like that
because they're charging me 3%
more.
Senator, that's a perfect
example. Uh, most customers,
they think that when they tip
that server that that amount
that they're tipping is
specifically for them and
unfortunately that's not always
the case.
So when they asked you about a
madam chair and represent how
are we gonna do this? That's why
I'm saying, well, how is the
consumer gonna know?
That
Aspect unless you actually put
this in the bill saying this is
what the business has to do.
There has to be a 3 by 5 sign
and so much lettering at the
front door, um.
Putting it there or
I'm sure I think uh the senator
makes an excellent point. I, I,
I would like to see that be
made, uh, available to
customers, but in the situation
that if we outlaw it.
That we know a lot, we no longer
allow businesses to do that,
then that is like any other law
that we minimum wage is a good
example. When I was a county
commissioner, we were the first
to lead the way to increase
minimum wage, there was still
restaurants that were not paying
the minimum wage, and when
they're found out, they're in
trouble.
about chair representative. How,
how will this, um, affect our
mind myself.
I apologize, Iam Chair, Senator,
please repeat that.
Internet online sales
representative.
Uh, man, this is only for tipped
workers at establishments in New
Mexico. It's not for online
activity.
Thank you, Madam Chair, not.
Thank you, Senator. Other
questions? Senator Scott.
Uh
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Is this going to require
One swipe of that card.
Go out with 3% discount.
In the second swipe to go out
with her.
No discount.
Or
What charge you.
Yes, ma'am,
madam chair, Senator, that's
exactly right. You would no
longer be able to program it to
deduct from that tipped worker.
And Madam Chair and
Representative is that.
Possible
With the machines that
Most restaurants have.
Senator, absolutely. And that's
why Josh Hernandez, who's very
well versed versed in that
specific thing that you're
asking is why I'm at a
disadvantage, but in the
committees that we've attended,
he's been very specific to say
that that would be taken care of
by the programming of the
machine itself.
Thank you.
Thank you. Any other questions?
No.
I move with you. There's a
motion for a due pass from
Senator Seria Lopez with the 2nd
from Senator Charley.
You could call the role, please.
It's been their signature block

Represented Borago, if you would
join us up front.
For House Bill 49.
captioning act.
representative
Good evening, um, senators.
Um, really great to see.
Um, Madam Chair.
That you're feeling better.
Um, I wanna, uh,
introduced tonight, House Bill
49.
And this is a committee
substitute.
Um
So I'll put that on the floor
first.
Uh, I also want to introduce my
guests to you this evening.
Um
Will it give me just a second
here and I'll find all of their
names. Um, first of all, I have
Johnny Hooper.
And Norm gone.
Who are with the hearing loss
association of America and the
National Association for the
Deaf.
And uh Madam Chair, um, our
signer also tonight is Amy
Burke.
And um
So those are our guests tonight
and my witnesses.
Um, madam chair, did you want to
uh go ahead and move the
You want me to move the
And I'm not not sure exactly how
that works. I'm still learning
this protocol, but do I move the
house committee stuff?
Representative, um.
We are just listening to your
bill as you came over from the
house. OK. So let me tell you
what this bill is that.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair, and,
and, uh, representatives, uh, or
senators, I'm sorry, um, you
heard this bill a couple of
years ago actually, and it's,
it's a similar bill. It's a
little different now, um, but it
went, got all the way to the
Senate floor. I'll just say
that. And then we ran out of
time, but basically what this
bill does is it creates an
accessibility.
Uh, a fundamental right for
closed caption.
And local businesses.
And what it does is it mandates
uh closed captioning for all
telephone receivers in public
areas of business and
institutions.
And uh, basically that would
also
Uh, apply to restaurants, bars,
hotels, retail stores,
hospitals, gyms, transportation
hubs, and other establishments
of the general public.
And if there are multiple
televisions.
That one of them is required to
be close captured.
And that's basically what it
does, um.
And there is uh
There is a right.
For a person of private right of
action, um, if, uh, the business
is
Has is not in compliance, um,
and basically that's
The bill
OK, that's all, that's all.
Thank you expert witnesses wish
to say anything.
Yes.
Aga I of with the uh.
I'm the chairman of the party
hearing as well of hearing loss
association of America,
but, you know, it just.
We go to a restaurant or any
places, you know, that the TV's
always gifted anyway, and if you
see something you want to hear
or see.
Uh, I'd rather have the captain
on just like uh we have this.
storm out there, you know one
storm, uh, we need to know what
what's the new guys or the
weather and the same, uh, plus
it just not the benefit from the
de part hear it benefit by
everybody in general.
OK.
So, I think if we pass this,
it's be beneficial for everyone.
And everybody's out com
community.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Um, no.
for the record.
And chair members Committee,
thank you. Uh.
I, I guess some norm, uh, I'm
Nathan.
Uh
Um.
The since the 1990s, the
televisions had increasingly
grown more and more capable of
providing captioning on the
televisions, anything above 13
inches on a television would be
capable of showing closed
captioning, uh, since 2010,
almost all available televisions
are able to do it since 2014,
they're also able to do it in
Spanish, um, televisions have
not come a long way. You just
press a button and turn them on,
but this boat is doing is
enshrining the rights of.
people who have a hearing loss
to be able to press that button,
turn it on, if they go to a
hotel, they can press the button
and turn it on, to go to a
restaurant, they can ask
somebody to press up and turn it
on.
The captions were shot.
And that this state is
enshrining and supporting that
right of all individuals, which
is already federal right in
Mexico.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, I didn't read the
uh number, the reference number
and I'd like to, for the record,
uh, 0.230511.3. OK, thank you.
With this, we'll go in the
audience. Is there anyone here
in support of Senate, excuse me,
House bills, see if we get this
one. House Bill 49.
Anyone in support?
Anyone in opposition?
Is there anyone on Zoom?
OK.
So we're going to zoom.
Jerry Dawson.
Yes, Madam Chair and members of
the committee, my name is uh
Sherie Dotson, and I am a
volunteer advocate for AARP, uh,
we are, uh, in favor of HB 49 as
older New Mexicans age and begin
to experience hearing loss. They
want their communities to be
livable and inclusive places to
be a part of. Close captioning
is just one way to get our state
closer to these ideals. We ask
you to pass this important
legislation. Thank you so much.
Thank you.
That was all.
OK.
So with that, we'll go to
questions from committee.
Senator Savio Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I do
remember this bill and I
remember supporting it, but I
don't remember it was a $1 civil
penalty in the private right of
action, is that, is that what is
different, Madam Chair?
Madam Chair, and uh Senator
Sidia Lopez that is correct.
That is the difference in this
bill from the bill that you
heard two years ago. We changed
the, the whole structure, uh,
the previous bill was giving the
Attorney General the right to
enforce, and so in in
consultations with the Attorney
General's office and um
Other attorneys, um,
Within uh the state, we, this is
a better option, we thought.
Um
Thank you, Madam Chair. I
When you're ready for motion,
I'll go ahead and and make them.
Thank you.
Senator Senator Pinto and then
Senator Scott.
Madam Chair and representative,
um.
And is there anywhere in the
bill that requires that it be in
uh in the other language.
I'm sorry, ma'am sure I didn't
understand the question,
Madam Chair and representative.
So only the English language.
Um
Madam Chair, and uh
uh, Senator, when you do the
closed captioning on your TV, I
think, um,
Typically it's English.
So, Madam Chair and
Representative I no any other,
other languages that the
technology that, Senator Pinto,
um,
In this particular bill.
representative,
Why not?
Manchas Committee, uh, they
can't caption in Spanish. Uh,
it's just a matter of switching
it to uh Spanish, um, the FCC is
always supported English and
Spanish thus far, uh, and it is
up to the FCC how they decide.
Uh, what's caption and what's
not, it is not up to the state
of Mexico.
For.
So
mediterian representative no
capability of the technology.
To do so.
There it is.
Matt chair murmursin, there is,
uh, they in 2014 introduced the
ability to do it in Spanish.
They are working with various
different techno.
AI companies to improve
captioning, so in the long term,
there will be more languages
added.
at this time it's only English
and Spanish, according to the
SEC.
Madam Chair Representative not
included in the bill.
Um, madam chair and, and
senator, honestly, that issue
had not been raised until now
and I'm certainly open to, you
know, having the option of
what's available in the closed
captioning and if we needed to
amend it, we could certainly do
that. That would be a simple
amendment, I think.
No more questions.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Uh, thank you, madam chair.
Because several penalties.
Representative for they apply if
uh
hearing impaired person walked
in.
To establishment close
captioning was not turned on.
But
They then asked for it to beat
him.
Is that absolve that.
Restaurant owner if they
complied.
Of any
opportunity to collect civil.
Ma'am chair and uh
Senator Scott, um,
We don't have our attorney with
us tonight. He was with us at
our last hearing and he wasn't
able to join us tonight, but I
will tell you that if that, if
they request if they walked into
an establishment, and they
requested that it be that it be
um
The closed caption be turned on,
then in fact, if they didn't
comply, then they could the the
person that
was harmed per se, I guess could
file a suit or a civil action.
OK. Yeah.
And madam chair of
Representative.
And I'm not an attorney, let me
preface that
program's currently broadcast
withloca.
I members committee, all
televisions have the capability
of showing close captioning, not
all programs have it. So for
example, uh, some of the local
news may not have it in the
immediate live shot that's going
on and let's say they were to
film something that's happening
right this moment, the captions
wouldn't show up necessarily in
that moment, they would show up
later. That's not the
responsibility of the bar or
restaurant or the gym, also just
to be clear, the ask is very
important.
Nobody asked for the close
captioning to be turned on, and
there's no reason to go through
this process. So we do uh in
this talk about making the
request and that request being
part of the whole process, it
doesn't just say that the uh
The, the TVs always have to have
it, but the implication is it's
just easier to turn it off.
Turn it on, have it on, somebody
walks in, if they say, hey
Timson, turn it off.
Yeah
OK.
Madam Chair and representative
and experts, it would be
important to me.
It's proprietor not be subject
to civil penalty.
It's
It is either not requested or
beyond their control.
To have
Close caption.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Any other
questions?
I'mber Duin. There's a motion
for a do pass from Senator Serio
Lopez with the second from
Senator Charlie
If you could call the role,
please.
Yes, kind of Senator Block is
excused Senator Boone is
excused, Senator Charlie.
Yes, Senator Gallegos excused.
Then another.
Then Pinto
Senator Scott
Lopez, yes.
Senator Hickin
Yes.
And Senator Lopez, yes.
I thought of 7 to 0 with 3
excuses you have a
recommendation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
And the chair did mention that
we extended the time for
committee this evening.
So
Um, I know that representative
Chavez has been waiting
patiently for House Bill 9.
The Immigrant Safety Act.
And then the other intent is to
finish even with House Bill 129.
Representative Chavis.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
I share the
House Bill 9, the immigrant
Safety Act is a simple, narrow
bill that does 3 things. HB 9 is
instructs New Mexico public
bodies not to enter into
agreements to detain people for
civil immigration violations.
It constructs the three counties
with existing agreements to use
their contractual rights to
terminate those agreements and
it instructs New Mexico public
bodies not to lease or sell
publicly owned property to
facilitate immigration
detention.
New Mexico has 3 immigration
facility detention facilities.
The Sebono County Correctional
Center in Milan, the Otero
County Processing Center in
Chaparral and the Torrance
County Detention Facility in
Estancia.
The federal government relies on
the type of agreements HB 9
addresses at each of these
facilities.
How do these agreements work?
The federal government enters
into no-bid contracts with
counties which then enter into
no bid.
subcontracts with out of state
entities for for
Without with an out of state
for-profit prison company.
Federal law usually requires the
federal government to
competitively bid contracts like
this, but going through a local
government lets them exploit a
loophole to get around that.
New Mexico's counties therefore
act as pass-throughs as shields
to facilitate federal
immigration detention to get
around basic scrutiny in the
federal system.
New Mexico hosts a
disproportionate number of
immigration detention beds per
capita is about 5 times the
typical state.
Passing the immigrant Safety Act
gets us out of the business of
immigration detention and stops
incentivizing eyes to place
detention beds here.
HB 9 makes New Mexico safer in
three ways.
One, ice is more likely to carry
out raids and arrests close to
where it has immigration vets,
HB 9 lowers that risk.
HB 9 protects public safety.
Breaking the connection between
New Mexico's counties and
federal immigration enforcement
authorities builds trust with
our immigrant communities. So
they feel safe to call 911 or to
seek medical care.
And HB 9 delivers accountability
for for a track record of human
rights abuses and New Mexico's 3
detention centers.
We have the power to hold the
line in New Mexico and not let
the current administration and
ICE
used New Mexico's own local
governments, the facilitate
cruelty and mistreatment.
Madam Chair, committee, I have
uh with me a senator Nava, uh,
and she's gonna make some brief
remarks and then I have two
expert witnesses that I will ask
to introduce themselves and also
make very brief remarks.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative, uh, Madam
Chair, members.
I'm happy to be joining uh
Representative Chavez here, uh,
to talk about public safety once
again.
This is simple. It instructs New
Mexico's public bodies. They
cannot be parties to agreements
to detain people for civil
immigration violations and that
they can't use public property,
public property for the purpose
of either.
It does not ban immigration
detention wholesale in New
Mexico. It does not bar
immigration and customs
Enforcement from arresting
people in New Mexico. It does
not change, which uh which
people with criminal records are
subject to mandatory detention
under federal immigration law.
And it does not stop court
judges from making decisions
about bail if a non-citizen is
charged with a crime.
It also does not stop low state
and local law enforcement
officers from enforcing state
criminal law or cooperating with
federal agencies and enforcing
federal criminal law.
It just withdraws our public
bodies from being involved in
civil immigration detention. We
have every right to take this
step. There is no federal law
that requires a states help
federal government carry out
civil immigration detention.
And if there were, that law
would be unconstitutional.
That's not how our federal
system works and that's why we
are here to take this step, and
I would also note Madam Chair
and members, uh, there are
others, there's 7 states who
have already passed laws that
are nearly identical to this and
those uh states are Colorado,
Illinois, Maryland, Oregon,
California, New Jersey, and
Washington. And with that, I
will yield to our experts.
Good evening, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Jessica Inez Martinez,
and I'm an immigration attorney
and the director of policy and
coalition building at New Mexico
Immigrant Law Center. I stand
proudly in my intersection as an
indigenous woman, my father's
family has been here since time
immemorial, and my mother
immigrated from Mexico. I have
lived in New Mexico all of my
life. I have lived in the north,
south, and central New Mexico.
I am proud to be a New Mexican.
We are community centered and it
is deeply ingrained in us to
fiercely protect our people and
ensure that our communities are
safe.
That is exactly what this bill
is about.
Right now, New Mexico hosts a
disproportionate amount of US
immigration detention capacity.
Any reduction in the number of
ice detention beds in New Mexico
will make our immigrant
communities safer because data
shows ice is more likely to
conduct arrests and raids closer
to where it has existing
detention beds, and we know that
collaboration between local
governments and federal
immigration enforcement
authorities dramatically
increases fear within our
immigrant communities.
just makes it significantly less
likely that immigrants will seek
assistance from local public
safety officials and pushes
immigrant and mixed status
families into the shadows.
Breaking the connection between
New Mexico's counties and
federal immigration enforcement
authorities will promote
cooperation and communication
between New Mexico's immigrant
communities and local officials
and make everyone in our
community safer. We have the
power to stop New Mexico's
complicity in human rights
abuses, protect New Mexico's
immigrant families and
stand up against fear and
bullying and for New Mexico
Mexican values and now is the
time to act. We urge you to keep
our community safe and pass HB
9, the Immigrant Safety Act.
Thank you.
Good evening, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Rebecca Scheff, and I am
a senior staff attorney with the
ACLU of New Mexico.
HB 9 is on solid legal footing.
It's simply regulates the
behavior of New Mexico's public
bodies. It does not attempt to
regulate the federal government,
nor its private contractors.
We have seen firsthand the harms
that immigration detention
causes in New Mexico.
We are here asking this
committee to stand strong for
the safety of our communities
and to get Mexico out of the
business of immigration
detention. Thank you.
you.
Thank you. We'll go to the
audience. Is there anyone here
in support of this legislation?
Thank you.
I would ask at least for 5 of
you to choose self-select.
to come forward.
Introduce yourselves and then a
2 minute statement each.
Thank you, man and chair and
committee members. My name is
Edwin Garcia. I consider myself
a survivor of the Torrance
County Detention facility. I now
live in Tennessee, but I
returned to New Mexico to share
my experience at TCDF with you
at TCDF there was an awful
smell. The water was dirty and
mold grew in the pots. There was
not enough staff, so I
translated and help people
request sick calls and use the
phone system to talk with their
families. I met men who did not
speak English or Spanish, told
me they could not communicate
with them, so they had not eaten
for 3 days. I didn't speak their
language either, but I tried and
I learned that they were
vegetarian, and I hope to get
the food that they could eat. I
met men who have not been
outside for months. I met, man,
my father's age contemplating
suicide, I sat down with them
with no stop for at TCDF. If
you're distressed or suicidal,
you get locked up in a cold room
alone for days and given pills
that make you feel like a
zombie. I promised the men out
there that I would fight for
them and fight for the
foreclosure of these places the
day I left TCDF. I tend to keep
that promise. New Mexico should
not support places like TCDF. A
human life should not be
profited off.
I urge you to vote this past HB
9. Thank you. God bless.
Madam Chair and committee
members, I'm Ota Chavez, EDF NM
Native vote. We are in deep
support of HB 9. Each person, no
matter the circumstances should
be treated with a basic level of
decency. Instead, we have people
being held in New Mexico
immigration detention centers,
subject to inhumane, unhygienic
conditions. Medical treatment is
withheld, and people are
suffering. This is cruel and
unacceptable. Immigrants
strengthened the diversity of
our.
and nation. Pueblo and tribal
leaders throughout this
continent long welcomed
newcomers onto the sacred land,
and in that spirit we carry that
sacred trust forward. The border
crossed us. Many of these people
targeted are just like us so
similar that members from the
Navajo Nation have been wrongly
detained by ICE. Having so many
immigrant dictation beds in New
Mexico only makes it more likely
that traumatizing arrests will
continue to happen. Our own
local government.
should not be involved in the
abuses we see in these
facilities and as an indigenous
person, I respectfully
respectfully ask that you vote
to pass HB 9. Let's treat each
other better. Thank you.
Good evening, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
Marshall Martinez, the executive
director of equality in New
Mexico. And we stand in strong
support of House Bill 9.
There is not a jail, prison or
detention center in the world,
where queer and trans people are
safe, but that is even more true
of the federal detention centers
now with the Trump
administration detaining trans
women in men's units. We should
not allow New Mexico local
government to facilitate abuse
of LGBTQ people just so that ICE
and private prison companies can
avoid normal scrutiny of their
contracts. We cannot stand by
and listen to more horror
stories of trans people being
denied their medications of
people living with HIV.
being denied their medications
and the neglect, abuse and
harassment that queer people
face on a daily basis. It is
time for New Mexico to take a
firm stand against these
violations of human rights and
get its state and local
governments out of the business
of immigration detention.
Uh, madam chairs and members of
the committee. My name is Arturo
Castillo, and I'm the director
of Equity and Culture at
Conservation Voters New Mexico.
I'm also a queer non-binary
Mexican-American from a mixed
status family, and I know all
too well the dreadful fear of
receiving a phone call that I
has detained a loved one.
And that they are headed to a
detention center that will
undoubtedly abuse and neglect
them.
Conservation voters in Mexico,
we believe it is our
responsibility to care for our
land, air, and water, and we do
that because we care about the
people of New Mexico, all people
of New Mexico. It is time to
stop using our public resources
to harm them and stop allowing
private companies to use our
local governments to get around
basic scrutiny of these
detention centers just so they
can make more profit.
So long as we let them, private
prison companies will continue
to worry more about keeping
profit margins high than ending
dangerous conditions. CVNM
supports holding these corporate
bad actors to a basic standard
of care for our communities, our
air, land, and water. It is time
for New Mexicans to start to
show that we care for all of our
people and get New Mexico
government out of the business
of immigration detention. Thank
you very much.
Um, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Alan
Sanchez. I'm the executive
director of the New Mexico
Conference of Catholic Bishops,
uh, we're here not to impose but
to propose. The bishops propose
that you support this
legislation. Recently, uh, Pope
Francis wrote to the bishops of
the United States and to all men
and women of goodwill, reminding
us about the dignity of the
human being.
And he mentions for us to
remember the Nazarene family
that was migrant.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph as they
fled, the wrath of an ungodly
king.
We're called by recognizing the
dignity of the human being, to
treat people ethically.
Our system, both sides of the
aisle agree that the immigration
system is broken and therefore
we should be even more vigilant
and caring for those who are
vulnerable until that system is
fixed, it is everyone's
responsibility, every American,
to protect the person who has
come to our country because of
the dignity of the human being.
That means ethical treatment and
what we've learned about these.
He's a detention centers, that's
not being met. That's not
dignity. That's not dignity.
Is there anyone in opposition?
Here in the room
OK, we'll go to
you
I know I have a full list, but
I'm just going to go for the 1st
5 that I have that are in favor.
Elsie Pillio.
OK.
Isaiah Torres.
Good um good afternoon
Chairwoman members of the
committee. Um thank you for the
opportunity to speak. Um, my
name is Isaiah Torres, and I'm
the statewide policy manager at
the Center for Civic Policy, and
we strongly support House Bill
9. House Bill 9 would end the
use of state and local
government resources to
facilitate immigration detention
in New Mexico. Immigration
detention facilities have a
well-documented history of human
rights violations, inadequate
medical care, and unsafe
conditions that put detained
individuals at severe risk, HP9
protects fundamental human
rights, improves community.
safety and builds trust in local
government. I urge the committee
to pass House Bill 9 and thank
you for the work that you do for
the state of New Mexico.
Thank you
And this is Micah Wells.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members. I am Michael
Wells, Youth and Families case
navigator at the Transgender
Resource Center of New Mexico.
For too long, New Mexico's ICE
detention centers have been
sites of abuse for queer and
trans immigrants seeking safety
in the US. We remember Roxana
Hernandez, a trans woman from
Honduras who died in 2018 after
being shackled to a hospital bed
and denied humane care under ice
and core civic detention in
Cibola County.
We remember Johanna Joa Medina
Leon, a trans woman from El
Salvador who died in 2019, after
two months of pleading for care
at the Otero County Processing
Center. We remember Kessley
Vile, a bisexual man from Brazil
who's blatant neglect at the
hands of co civic guards and
medical staff at the Torrance
County Detention Center led to
his suicide in 2022. New Mexico
must change course and protect
vulnerable people in need,
please vote for the immigrant.
Safety Act. Thank you.
Thank you
Olga
Um, hi, Madam Chair and members
of the committee. My name is
Olga Santana with El Centro. We
support HB 9 because our state
and local government should not
be complicit in supporting a
system that violates human
rights, incentivizes eye
enforcement and makes us less
safe. I will now share the
testimony of a member for 26
years my family and
I have lived in Albuquerque as
college graduates, business
owners, workers, and tech
taxpayers, one day everything
changed during a traffic stop. I
was cold and I was detained,
shackled and sent to a detention
center. It was freezing cold.
The bathrooms lacked privacy.
The food was awful and the
officers intimidated us,
demanded we sign deportation.
papers or stay locked up, and
parents were told that their
children will be taken away if
they refuse. Please stand with
New Mexico families and support
HB 9. Thank you.
Thank you, Kurt Roger.
Good evening, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. This
is Kurt Reger, director of
Lutheran Advocacy Ministry of
New Mexico, Lutheran advocacy
also speaks the position of the
New Mexico conference of
Churches, and I'm here this
evening to express her strong
support for HB 9.
Immigration, refugee and asylum
policies express who we are as a
nation, and I would argue who we
are as a state. They influence
our present and future character
and the impact the lives of
thousands. Thus we advocate for
policies that provide vigorous
protection for asylum seekers as
organizations are advocacy
advocacy is rooted in our faith
and our faith teaches us that we
should protect, embrace, and
empower all asylum seekers
within just and welcoming
communities, Lutheran advocacy
ministry and the conference
churches urge your support for
HB 9. Thank you for the
opportunity to speak to you this
evening.
Thank you. And the last, for
those in favor, Usario.
This
It says Usario de zoo.
Rodriguez.
So you remember regal migrator.
Ya
aldos travajos
Ya
aldos travajosal deli
de la la la gracias.
Gracias.
And then we do have one in
opposition.
And I believe this is law lab.
Um
OK.
And that ends all of our public
comment on Zoom.
So with that, we'll go to
questions from the committee,
and I have Senator Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Are any of these three
facilities going to be.
Compensated at the consequence
of this bill.
Madame Chair, Senator, this bill
is simply removes one
contracting option from the
equation for ice. It would
restrict New Mexico's state and
local governments from
contracting with ICE for civil
immigration detention. It was
not for any facility to close
and each facility, uh, that has
a contract currently already has
a bargain for provision allowing
for termination based on notice
alone.
Now, Madam Chair.
Senators representative and
expert.
My concern
Just for the Otero County.
Processing facility.
that employs some 300 people.
And I believe it's carrying
about a $24 million.
Bond note.
With those contracts.
As the
Revenue stream intended to pay
up.
So
Is that all go away?
Madam Chair, senator the Otero
County would be welcome to
repurpose the existing facility,
including for detention of other
incarcerated populations or an
alternative use entirely. The
bond in question is a revenue
bond, not a general obligation
bond, and investors have already
assumed the risk that it bills
such as this one would affect
the bond.
And the 300 employees.
As chair
An expert.
Be out of a job.
Madam chair and while this bill
would not require facilities to
be permanently shut down and
that they could be repurposed.
We are also aware that there are
chronic staffing shortages at
correctional facilities across
the state and people with
existing skill sets, could that
really transfer to other
employment opportunities within
the same industry.
Madam chair
Everyone
Do we really believe that the
folks that are.
that are passing through these
processing facilities.
Are safe for being on the
street.
Subject to
Coyotes.
Human traffic
The
People that would be
already willing and able.
prey on folks with.
Little or no other reason.
Madam Chair, senators, civil
immigration detention is neither
protective nor punitive. It is
administrative. What we've seen
at these facilities within our
state are horrifically inhumane
conditions, rampant medical
neglect, 3 preventable deaths in
recent years of the LGBTQ
individuals who are
disproportionately affected by
the harms of immigration
detention and our July as New
Mexicans to get out of this
business.
So, Madam Chair, expert answer
to my question was.
They are better off on the
street.
Madam Chair, Senator, is not
within the scope of New Mexico's
authority as one of the 50
states to determine who remains
in custody and who does not,
that's exclusively within the
domain of ice. What this bill
would do is promote public
safety by getting Mexico out of
the business of immigration
detention.
OK.
Thank you.
Thank you. Senator Serio Lopez,
I move a do pass.
There's a motion for a due
passed from Senator Senio Lopez
with the 2nd from Senator
Charlie.
And if you could call the wrong
place.
Yes, madam Chair, and at your
block is excused.
Senator Boone is excused.
Then Mister Charlie
Senator Gallegos is excused.
Senator Nova.
Yes.
Be your Pinto.
Then you Scott.
Seddio Lopez.
Yes, and to explain my vote.
Senator Hickey. Yes.
love it.
Yes.
Senator Sidia Lopez to explain
her vote.
Um
As you remember last year I
carried this bill on the Senate
floor and Representative Alcorn.
Ask me to go visit the facility
in Cibola, and I said I would be
happy to if it would be.
Surprise visit.
And he would, they would not do
that.
That tells you a lot.
I'm very pleased to be able to
support this, this bill, and I
hope it makes it all the way.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you and by a vote of 6 to
16 in favor, 1 in in say noetri
excused, you have as you pass
recommendations. Thank you,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. Thank you.
Oh
Oh
So this
The floor leader.
We have a qua present with the
Democrats, but um are probably
can.
What remain
ranking member just walked.
