I have more questions,
information that my colleagues
may wish to ask for.
And uh see where it goes at this
point.
So Senator, if you'd like to
join us up front.
Um, Madam Superintendent, if you
would join us also.
And before we start, of course,
um, I will ask our committee
secretary to take role.
Senator Bluff here
Senator,
Senator Charlie.
Senator Gallegos.
And another.
Senator Pinto.
Senator Scott
Yeah. Center Serio Lopez.
And hicky Senor Lopez.
Here.
Right? We haveorum present and
Senator, the floor is yours.
Great. Thank you, Madam Chair.
So just as a reminder, this is a
bill that
I would create an oversight
process for.
Transactions, dealing that
involve hospitals.
Um
Or involved, non-hospital
entities only to the extent that
there is an insurance company or
insurance affiliated company.
Uh, that is seeking to to
acquire them.
The purpose of the school is to
make sure that when these
transactions happen, it's not at
the expense of the
accessibility, availability,
affordability and quality of
healthcare in New Mexico.
So with that, uh, Madam Chair.
OK, thank you, Senator. Um.
Questions, comments from
committee members.
No questions?
Senator Scott.
Oh, thank you, Madam Chair.
But before
I started asking questions, I
would.
Respectfully requested the chair
that
This discussion drafts of
community substitutes.
And amendments
Be made available to
Be made widely available.
At least 24 hours before.
The
because
I have had a lot of complaints
on.
I sighed about
Not having access to
Uh, documentation that will be
coming up.
With that said, I'll start
asking questions.
Thank you, ma'am.
I believe I saw Madam Chair and
senator.
That there were uh
In in these mergers and
acquisition.
Activities.
That there are specialists
involved.
At the OSI would not have the
expertise.
To evaluate.
Um
The financial viability or
Sustainability or
Advantage
Accruing to the merger.
And that
The OSR would need to hire.
Ex.
In these fields.
Could you elaborate a little bit
about how that madam, senator,
so.
This is actually a process that
already exists within the OSI uh
when looking at mergers
involving insurance companies.
Um
And it is going, it is getting
these outside experts who do
have expertise in those specific
areas.
to look at things, but this is
This is an established process
there, the superintendent can
tell you a little bit more about
it.
Madam Chair, Senator, uh, thank
you for your question, uh, we
built this bill pretty much on
the uh insofar as a lot of the
review was based on the
insurance holding Company Act,
which is pretty much widespread
throughout the country, each
state has adopted it.
Uh, we do have experts looking
at some uh we're.
And we have done it in a
transaction this year on the
financial viability of of.
Of a transaction. We do know the
people to hire when we need to
look for financial expertise in
our in our in the insurance
area, it's usually actuaries.
But that's, but we're not
limited to that. We also are
gonna be consulting with the
healthcare authority with their
expertise when we look at
accessibility and quality, uh,
of, of health care and uh the
attorney General's office would
also be involved.
Madam chair, it's Miss Kane is
it?
Madam Chair, Miss Kane is there.
Is there um
Is there expertise within.
Any of these organizations.
Specifically
Directed toward M&A activity, I
see that there's a likelihood
that outside experts.
Would need to be consulted.
Is that
Still true
Yeah, the Madam Chair, senator.
there are some expertise based
on the insurance side looking at
mergers and acquisitions, but
we've put in our budget uh a
request uh to hire staff that
would provide the oversight as
we look at these transactions.
We don't have, I think we need
more people if we're gonna take
on this, these kinds of
transactions as well as what we
have traditionally in the
insurance industry, and they
would have the background in
reviewing transactions. As a
matter of fact, when I was in
private practices, a lot of what
I did.
Personally
Yeah
So, Madam Chair, Ms. King, there
would be no expense.
Well, how often do these, let me
ask first, how often do these
M&A activities in the state
occur.
And would
In-house expertise be justified.
Uh, with the expense of that be
justified?
Given the level of activity.
Madam Chair, Senator, I, the
people that would be involved, I
think, I think we need the
expertise to provide the
oversight for the for the
experts that would probably be
hired to do this when we've
looked in other states, they've
taken on about 3 people with
different areas of expertise,
which is what we're looking at,
um.
The uh, the frequency, um, this
year we had one transaction, but
the definition was smaller, uh,
I think we can use the expertise
on the insurance side as well as
the as.
For transactions along these
lines that can build more
expertise in my in in OSI for
both.
Because again we're gonna be
focused on what what OSI brought
to the table when we looked at
this one transaction is really
understanding who was the
ultimate owner.
Uh, what was their background
looking at the financials,
working with outside counsel is
and then doing our due diligence
to determine if there were any
other regulatory issues, which
was in our sphere of expertise,
and then we we we linked with
the healthcare authority, um,
uh, again, to look at, have
their input on the need
accessibility and what they saw.
We had a transaction that I
think the uh the participants,
uh, announced it's supposed to
be confidential, but.
Because they announced, I think
I could speak about it called
oceans and it was a behavioral
group.
Owned by two private equity
groups, they had one facility in
New Mexico but because they had
one facility, they had to come
here and, and work with us and
the the statute that's in effect
now is B15. We have the CEOs
come, we went through the
process and uh from what I
understand from some of the uh
Uh, the people, and I haven't
looked at it, but from some of
the hospitals that they uh
they've represented that the
process went very well and they
were pleased with it.
And we did use that we use
in-house experts and outside
experts and the HCA.
if I
you asked how often these
transactions happen, uh, we, we
don't know because we haven't
until we just have this bare
bones uh SB 15 from last year.
There's been no oversight.
Tracking it, so.
We don't have that data because
we have not historically.
Provide an oversight in that
area.
Uh
Madam Chair Senator, surely that
wouldn't be.
That would be one of the best
kept secrets on the planet.
When the hospital was merged
into another organization, would
it not?
Madam Chair, Senator, not
necessarily when youth is so
ardent owns Loveless, do you
think of Ardent when you think
of Loveless?
Uh, United Health, uh, owns
Optum. Uh, I don't know that a
lot of folks know that, um,
Apollo as a private equity
company that owns uh Memorial,
uh, Hospital in Las Cruces, I
think a lot of these
transactions happen at a very
high level that most people, I
think a lot of people don't know
and that's happening.
Madam Chair, and Senator, I have
I've received uh.
Some negative comments from
Number of rural hospitals
including
The hospital district in
My county
Yeah, this piece of legislation
takes away.
The local control.
Uh, over the operations and
management of
Local board members.
Could you
Address those concerns.
Sure, madam Chair, Senator, I
don't think that's correct. This
doesn't take control away.
From anyone, all it does is
require that and uh a process
where.
They are talent telling me the
superintendent, what their plans
are.
And she's making sure that those
plans aren't going to harm the
availability, accessibility,
quality, and affordability of
healthcare. And if it looks like
they are.
inappropriate conditions on that
transaction.
Like things like maybe.
You can't fire all your docs and
replace them only with
mid-levels, you can't get rid of
labor and delivery when this is
the only labor and delivery
service, uh, within hours of any
of these communities, things
like that.
So that would be those are
appropriate conditions that
would apply to approval of a
transaction, but it doesn't mean
that the board.
Doesn't have control over their
hospital. It means that if they
want to do
do one of these transactions
that they can't
Have a negative impact on
essential services for the
people they are serving.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator,
nonetheless.
Approval or disapproval implies.
Significant level of control
which you.
Not agree with that
Madam Chair, senator, I mean,
the whole point of oversight as
a state is to
is to oversee.
Whatever it is we're we're
overseeing, so, so yes, having,
having 00 regulation or zero
oversight of something.
You can do whatever you want,
um, we are suggesting an
approach to oversight that is
focused on preserving, uh,
Access to quality affordable
healthcare for New Mexicans.
Yeah, Madam Chair and Senator, I
certainly appreciate that, but
Would you
I would use.
In one circumstance, the word
permission.
And in the other circumstance,
the word oversight.
And those are too vastly
different words.
Madam Chair, that's all I have
for now, but I would like to
reserve another bite of the
apple depending on
The questions that my colleagues
have. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Any other
questions?
Senator
Senator Black.
I'll defer to Doctor Hickey,
Madam Chair.
OK
Senator Hickey.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
And uh thinking.
The uh hard work that you all
did over the summer.
Um
Uh, yeah, I, I wish that I had
been available.
To participate.
But uh looks like it.
I might not have been here at
all.
Um, because my first, uh,
Polls showed that I was gonna
lose the election.
Around crime and so I dropped.
Work on a number of
Issues, uh, in order to focus on
the campaign and
And be here.
And uh and it worked out well. I
got 58% of the vote.
When
I was supposed to lose in a
district that's fifty-fifty. So,
So at least I'm sitting here,
but I do, I do have a ton of
questions about this and.
And I do, uh, and one of the
reasons that I ran again.
is because, and, and I don't
mean this in a pejorative way,
but it it is oh.
And, and, and this is not in any
way critical of
My colleagues, but
Um
You know, no one in this
legislature has had the
experience that I've had.
In healthcare.
Not even close.
The um
Starting with the head of the
faculty practice at the
University of New Mexico,
setting up the first VA rural
clinics in the country.
That then became a pattern all
over the nation.
Um
CEO of Loveless.
I've worked for Cigna for
profit.
Uh, I've worked for not for
profit systems, the Catholic
systems, and with all due
respect to
Those of my faith, uh, I would
tell you that the Catholic
Hospitals and the systems.
Are
The
Really, even more than a lot of
private equity firms. They are
more focused on putting money
away than anyone I've ever.
And, and, and upping their
salary.
They're really, it's, it's a
shame. I mean, here's a
Theoretically and organizations
built around Christ.
And uh
Um
It's uh
The the Sisters of
charity in Saint Louis, um.
Uh, oh, what was the sisters of
Essentially.
Bank accounts.
is a New York Times article.
And so, um,
I, I, I, in the introduction, it
was kind of like private
equities is a bad word.
Um
And, and maybe we feel that way
now because
Of our current president and his
focus.
Um, the private equity.
is really what
But so much together and
In this country. And so they're
not evil.
Some of them are
Some of the not for profits.
are potentially evil, and I, and
I think we're getting things
completely.
Mixed up here in, in our focus.
That for profit institutions.
are somehow badly.
People who put out the
newsletter.
Safety
profits for safety and so forth
are saying the issue with the
lack of physicians is
Based on
P
Terrible private
So, um, and again, these are
some that we could go back and
look at the tape, but there was,
there's certainly a sense of the
presentation.
And that that's why you, you
were doing this.
Um
The
I, I have, uh, participated in
multiple transactions, private
equity, uh.
And they're critical to funding
in Mexico Health Connections
turned into true health.
Because we had to get private
equity. We couldn't go because
we couldn't get money from the
federal government.
So we went out and found a Wall
Street firm.
And brought him in and, and
built up.
Our reserves that we can grow.
And so there really is a role.
For them, and I, and I know
you're saying, oh, we just want
to do the oversight and, and
I'll come back to how they're
asking you how you're gonna do
that, but I
I want to
That's the stage.
That
Um
I mean, I think really in the
long run, this bill is gonna be
harmful.
New Mexico and the people that
we will do more harm in quality
and access to care.
Passing this bill.
In this form.
With the sweeping bag.
Ours.
That
is presumed to be taken.
I
I'm not sure who your experts
are.
But
Um, and, and I'll, and I'll pull
that together, we talked about
the rural hospitals.
Um
But I, I, again, the answer to
your question was a presumption.
Oh, we can't let someone cut
surfaces.
OK
This is America.
Not Russia, not China.
You know, a lot of services.
Get delivered if you have the
personnel to deliver them.
OBGYN is not being
Offered up
Because no one wants to come
here and work as an OBGYN.
The their insurance, their
malpractice insurance is
incredibly high.
And so, so you're gonna go and,
and say to a hospital that
doesn't have the volume.
That would only potentially look
at losing money.
And say you have to do.
We want to prove your ability to
get a loan.
Unless you do OB.
Well, that's what money loser,
people with money are not gonna
bring it forward.
Maybe they're just not gonna
come.
And I don't know how I, I again,
I, I worry about the rural
hospitals in the state with this
kind of approach.
So
The um
So with with that kind of
context.
The questions that I have.
Focus on
How is the office of the
superintendent of insurance.
Going to know or the healthcare
authority.
Going to know
What constitutes good expert.
I've been in the consulting
business.
And in the consulting business,
and you've probably seen the
article.
Because the the the big ones,
um, Accenture, Deloitte, what
have you.
You know, they're, they're
consulting both sides of the
equation, employers and PBMs.
And the, these quote expert
consultants.
Basically, what they do is they
their their business is to grow
business.
And bring more in.
I mean, that, that's what it's
about.
You get your bonuses if you
bring in more business, not if
you do a great job and that's
what they're all about. So I'm
very concerned on how
People here without that
expertise.
And it's not in the HCA.
Without that expertise or even
gonna be able to
Define
What a good expert is.
Or because again, the experts
are by and large because they
want to increase the business,
they figure out
What you want to know or what
what where you want to get to.
And then they get there.
And they can go either way.
In order to keep their business
going.
So
I guess I'd really like to hear
in much more detail, oh,
experts.
Give me more granular detail how
The Office of Insurance.
And the HCA which
are trying to get the eye back
somehow off the grounds, taking
a long time.
How are you going to define the
expertise.
And know that you're really
getting
Expert services.
Madam Chair, Senator, I'm gonna
defer in a moment to Miss
Johnson. We have Elizabeth
Johnson here with us, who is a
deputy counsel.
At the OSI. But first, I want, I
want to correct some.
Some uh.
Misstatements that I heard.
This is not about private equity
being evil.
Private equity is not inherently
evil.
Uh, this is not about for-profit
versus non-profit.
All this is about is about
making sure.
That when transaction happens,
it's not at the expense.
Of New Mexicans.
Because whoever's doing the
transaction wants more profit.
Now you framed, he said, well,
how, how your entire analysis
was based on what is most
profitable.
And I get it, the
corporatization of medicine is
rampant.
In America.
That doesn't make it right. That
doesn't mean that healthcare
should always
You seen
Primarily through a a profit
lens. I think doing that there's
a, a profound disservice, uh,
especially when you're saying,
hey, if we are not making money.
Uh, then who cares?
What, how we're going to treat
the patients of New Mexico that
when, when your first priority.
Is profit
And not the healthcare of New
Mexicans. I, I personally, I
think that is a, a bad approach
and I I don't think it serves.
Serves uh New Mexico well.
Um
Now that said, I will kick it
to, uh, Miss Johnson to talk
about the process.
Is this better?
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
Doctor Hickey, um, to answer
your question regarding how OSI
is going to know what
constitutes a good expert. We're
gonna know what constitutes a
good expert, cause we already
know what constitutes a good
expert. We employ several
experts skilled, um, in the
present time under our
examinations bureau of which I'm
the assigned counsel to, um,
that are very skilled at uh
evaluating business structures,
legal structures, um,
financial schemes to determine
what constitutes a business that
is profitable, a business that
can actually serve its clients,
um, and in addition, we may need
more and I would also say that
regarding the draft of this
bill, we consulted with an
expert in healthcare mergess and
acquisitions from Norton Rose,
Fulbright in New York City who
um brought a lot of expertise to
the table, so that's just our
starting point. We, uh, realize
that we may need more than that.
But um we've, we employ skilled
experts as it is, and we would
like to bring uh more value to
our table as well.
Senator Hockey.
Yes, that
that that is one firm.
Um
The, you mentioned that you were
gonna hire.
Several people. I mean, if
you're gonna
Do these reviews and get
reports.
You're gonna have to have
knowledgeable people to do that.
And I don't see that in this
bill.
Um, as an appropriation, Madam
Chair, Senator, it is in my
budget.
I asked for 1.5 million in my
budget.
And in, in that budget, you're
going to hire what kind of
People who uh what kind of
background will they have? Well,
I, I'm obviously I'm gonna look
for transaction people that
under, you know, that understand
transactions, financial people
and people that have been
involved in healthcare, ah, the
healthcare industry looking at
acquisitions and mergers and.
Things along those lines.
It's, it's been done in other
states we've uh looked at Oregon
and uh they've pulled in people
and have been able to do a
pretty, uh, we think a pretty
reputable job. They've been very
helpful to us as we.
Gone down this, uh, year-long
trail, uh talking to us about a
what expertise they thought they
needed, the number of people
that they, they ended up needing
and and we've they've learned
from.
You know, doing it for 3 years,
um, so I think that's been
extremely helpful. We've been,
uh, looking after Ashby and
again my career.
Uh, has been, uh, hiring, uh,
you know, as a general counsel
of major.
Two major insurance companies,
um, I have.
Had to hire experts throughout
my career and I.
Pretty good at it.
And I think well, what I'm gonna
try to do is bring that
expertise into the office
looking at these people, so
they.
We know that you have to have a
certain amount of knowledge to
have uh oversight and and uh uh
deal with experts. You can't be
naive and think that the experts
have all the all the answers, so
uh what we need is people with
that oversight capability
because we will never have the
staff that can really look at a
whole transaction like this, as
a matter of fact, when we, we,
we've had a little joke with the
hospitals last year when they
said, well, we think you, how
about $10,000 to look at?
a major transaction like
Presbyterian and Unity and I
jokingly because I do have that
sense of humor, apologize that
Irish sense of humor, senator,
uh, that basically said, well,
give me 10% of what you've
spent, and I think I'll be fine.
So I, I think in today we had a
conversation with the hospitals
and what we are gonna be talking
to them about, we would be
talking to them about who we're
hiring, so they know we're not,
you know, sort of like doctors
want to pick people in their
field to look at their, whether
they think it's a medical
necessity. We're gonna be
talking to.
hospitals about the experts were
hiring so that they think
they're valid and we're also
going to be giving them an
estimate.
is, uh, Madam Chair, and, uh.
Superintendent
Who hire someone who has
experience.
Um, and as you said, you, you
did an insurance companies and
they're able to pay the wages.
To bring those type of people
along $250,000 or more.
To get that, will you be able to
uh get wage.
relief so that you can bring
True people to help you overseas
really got experience. Senator,
I've had, oh madam, sure, excuse
me, Senator, I've had uh some
incredible success this year.
Some of it's been with the help
of Spo. Uh, obviously I'm not
paying.
Industry wages, but we've been
able to hire a pharmacist, uh, a
doctor's coming on board, uh, I
have a financial expert that
came out of Pricewaterhouse and
was uh in the audit the auditing
and finance department of a
major international company.
There are a lot of people at a
certain point in their career
that want to come in and give
back.
And uh we've been able to hire
them, uh, the in an actuary
which we found a tremendous
actuary that's come to us from
California.
So, uh, again, with the help of
Spo and with and, you know, uh,
we've been very successful so
far, so I think we'd be able to
duplicate that in this area.
Madam Chair, Senator, to the
extent that you're referring to
pain, the outside experts, those
are paid for by the parties.
Not that they're not state
employees.
And your senator just to.
Add to that, that's the way the
insurance mergers and
acquisitions work, the parties
pay for the experts, legal,
financial, actuarial.
So it's something we're used to
in in another sphere.
In our traditional sphere.
Thank you.
Um
In taking this on, and, and, and
I do understand that you are
definitely uh superintendent and
Madam Chair, you, you're
definitely an expert in the area
and we really appreciate.
You're coming to the state of
New Mexico.
Um, to bring us
That expertise, um,
But
You is
I'm, I'm just, I'm wondering, is
this?
Your exercising this authority.
Because you, you are doing some
oversight, but it does there
need to be legislation that
allows you to have
The oversight, uh, I guess
you're saying it's just gonna be
in this bill.
Um
And uh
Um
But again, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a
little bit worried, particularly
as the way the industry is, is.
apart
Between providers and insurers.
That mixing all of this into
one.
Place and, you know, this, this
goes on for a long time, you and
I is is energetic as we.
believe we are, uh, at our age.
Um, at some point, um, we'll be
done.
And you'll get replaced, I'll
get replaced, what have you, and
it's kind of who comes after you
and
And, and that's part of what I,
I have paused about again in the
bill.
Is the uh is this really the
right place to put it, and if we
really building up a department
can do this expertise.
Uh, you're right, Oregon, and,
and those of you who've been to
LHHS you've, you've heard me,
you know, that.
The uh the ability to understand
hospital financials and what
have you is absolutely.
Critical to a state. I mean
there's one hospital in the
state.
The charges 800% of Medicare for
outpatient facility visits on a
commercial basis.
I mean that's, that's the kind
of expertise we need, and if I
didn't have so many pills this
year and had to do an election
first, I would have copied the
Indiana bill that outlaws that
stuff.
And that to me is
Where we, we really kind of need
to be focused, not so much in an
area.
Of, uh
Where we, we, we don't have the,
the innate expertise going
forward.
So, um,
I, I agree that there needs to
be oversight.
It's just
And, and I, I was prepared to go
through section by section and
piece by piece in the bill and
ask questions, but I, I won't
torture everyone with that.
Madam chair,
Yeah, because they're there's so
many vague vague reason now
we've got the new bill, and I
tried to digest some of it and I
can't quite.
See what's different, um.
And uh
Again, the, the factor of time
to really understand all the
pieces of it because of the
vagaries and the broad
authorities that.
Seemed to be implied and, and if
you build that into some sort of
regulatory component isn't
really going to be fair to the
hospitals, but
Again, I'm, I'm really troubled
by the the statements that that
Senator Dohe said. We just want
to assure that there's gonna be
access and quality of care.
And
Other than
Depending the state's money.
I don't know how you can assure
That there's gonna be quality
and access of care to every area
of the state.
I mean that it depends on so
many other variables that we
have no control over.
People have gotta want to come.
And, and you also said,
That
You know, you, you want
companies that
But
Patience over profit.
No, and in an ideal world, if I
had a magic wand, that would be
wonderful.
Um, and, and healthcare,
unfortunately has evolved to a
place where
Profits do, as I was talking
about the Catholic systems and
some of the other, the steward,
uh speaking of experts, I was an
expert to help sell Stewart in
Massachusetts when I worked for
Navigate.
Um, you know, and they made it
sound very rosy.
That uh the outcome and how much
value-based care there would be
and
And uh the sophistication nobody
had at that point to understand
what the prime.
Uh, driver of of that was doing
to to Massachusetts, and again,
I just
You can talk about bringing in
the experts and what have you,
but at the end of the day,
Um
It really comes down to what, to
assure that there's access and
quality.
by the state, the state.
is gonna have to fund that.
If if they want, if you want
OBs.
You have to be prepared to pay
for obstetricians, it's called.
It's terrible.
Uh
My wife's an OBGYN and I
sometimes
They get us mixed up and I get
her offers $500,000 for an OB.
In Arizona.
Come now
$500,000 a year, we guarantee
you.
That's what we're up against.
And we just don't have a
commercial infrastructure here.
To support that, to do the cost
shifting.
Uh, for the low payments and,
and
Medicaid
Uh, I, I think a bill went on
the floor today, 250%.
Yeah
Um, you know, and maybe I'll
sign on to that, as it isn't
just OBGYN, it's, it's, it's
everything else as well. I mean,
the large specialty groups.
Are unable to go talk to him. I
said.
Over a year, they can't get
anyone to take a bite.
Even a bite
I think
I, they've had like a few phone
calls.
But no one's coming here.
So, I'm, I'm just not sure how
we're going to.
To demand that
Uh, someone who's potentially
putting money in, uh, is gonna
be good.
In a way that, I mean, when you
don't have enough deliveries
that you need for OBs to cover
the cost situation, if you don't
have enough revenue coming
through the deliveries to make
it work.
Yeah, aren't going to get people
just like malpractice insurers
to go lose money.
I mean, if there, if, if money
is coming in.
There is an expectation of a
return.
And, and we all have to
recognize that.
And so
Um, again, I, I, what I worry is
that
That
We're coming at this with a
preordained attitude.
That I don't think fits the
economic reality of America.
That you can't, you, you can't.
Um
Demand that their services and
so forth.
That people put in place and
overrule boards.
And take that authority away
from the boards.
And what services are going to
be provided.
And, and so you said that's,
that's what's motivating you to
drive this bill that people have
access to quality of care. The
reality is we're a very poor
state.
We don't generate
Enough commercial
Business to generate income to
Commercial business is 25% here.
Most other states 60 to 75%.
The rest of its governmental,
Medicaid.
Um
is hugely at risk.
And so
Um
If, if we have an onerous
process.
That someone who wants to invest
And it's a very onerous process
with the mother Mai.
And at 15% threshold for every
mother Mai.
Um
They're not gonna come.
And
Trump, you know, Senate Bill 17
from last year.
Great Bill
That bill is based on a waiver.
And that waiver, while it was
approved by CMS.
has to go through OMB.
Office of Management in the
budget. It doesn't go out the
door.
Without going through OMB. I
learned that when I did the co
op.
And
I just, I, I do not see.
Mr. Vogue
It was just
Named as the director for OMB,
letting that money go.
As some very worried.
About what's gonna happen to
FMAP.
And other things, and
When that happens, we're gonna
get to a point where we just
don't have
Mm
Much choice but to go to
External sources of capital.
But
Most
Companies who would
potentially bring capital to
bear.
To be able to provide the
services, build the
infrastructures, and, and, and
healthcare is very capital
intensive that I worry that we
aren't going to get people who
will want to come to New Mexico.
It's kind of like the position
situation when you're facing
very, very low income compared
to other states.
And when you're facing a
Hostile medical malpractice
environment.
Um
They, they just aren't gonna
come, and so
I, I worry for the rural
hospitals in the state. I, I
don't know.
Where they're gonna get.
The capital that they need,
because we can't build it
through
We aren't gonna be able to get
it out of what's being made out
of Medicaid.
Uh, and we will probably get cut
back significantly in terms of
what the federal government
gives us to be able to put it in
and then you're left with.
Private equity
But, but private equity has a
choice.
You can't tell him you have to
come here and do this.
And they are not going to go to
a place.
Where you have such excess.
In their mind, in a 15%
threshold.
Such excess and the mother may
is that can occur if they
You need to bring in some
additional money.
Um, it's just there are lots of
other places that are much more
attractive to do it.
And so when I said I think this
bill is gonna do more harm.
I think it's gonna end up
closing rural hospitals.
And
Then access to care.
And so those are, those are my
concerns.
Um, Madam Chair, I'm, I'm gonna
end up with a
Uh
Hopefully, maybe a resolution to
at least the issue where we're
at now. I, I believe this needs
a lot more time.
Um
You know, I was told that
You know, when we've been
working hard on something and it
it doesn't make it.
Well I've learned in 4 years, it
takes 3 or 4 years to pass tough
bills.
And I think really a better
approach.
is to
Renew or to
Add an additional sunset year.
The current bill
So that we can stop
Big mergers do the examination
that was being done with the
Presbyterians.
And then go back.
And bring in experts from the
outside. I mean, I understand
people everywhere in the state
want all the services that they
can get, but we have to bring in
people from the outside. What
would we need to do be
attractive to them.
That they would want to invest.
In the state and then put that
into the parameters of a bill
next year.
And given all the experience
that I've had.
In having to raise
Doing startups, raising capital,
and so forth.
Without an election. I'm, I'm
happy to participate in that
process and, and bring in people
I know a whole lot of folks.
In New York and Boston,
California, who
Who invest in different things
and bring in folks and and get
really kind of an extra point of
view. How do we make this
attractive?
And at the same time, get
services funded one way or the
other, and then how do we be
sure that we're gonna figure out
what's happening in Medicaid.
So that we, we have the we have
the other funds to keep the
hospitals going. I think it's a
very complex process, but I
don't think this bill, the way
it stands,
I
going to do what you want to do.
I believe it's gonna do the
opposite.
And so, you know, my
recommendation.
Is that
We
Defer this
And, and yes, it's hard work.
Healthcare is complicated. It is
phenomenally complicated. In the
finances are outrageously
complicated.
But really bring in the experts
to help us.
Write these bills, and I think
that is the optimal solution.
And so, Madam Chair,
Um, I'm gonna, I'm, I've
Uh, uh, procedurally, I, I may
be out of order on this cause
there may be others who want to
speak, but I would propose that
we
You and no rack on this.
So that we can do more thinking.
Around how we bring.
Experts
To the table
We're not just us here.
But others, and, and maybe we
can do that. I think it goes
through the judiciary, you get
some of that done, but if not,
then maybe we can all agree,
let's do one more year.
Under the current
Bill
And really take the time to do
this well and not risk.
Posing
Many
Of our rural hospitals, which is
what I see this bill in the
current form.
They'll do.
And, and, and as I say, it will
have the opposite effect of what
you desire.
So
Anyway, it's the point of
motions or after questions, I
would.
Make a motion that uh
and over that can pass it on to
another committee. Give it a
little more time to think some
of this up.
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
So Senator Hickey, um, you're
gonna hold that for a bit. There
are a few more persons who'd
like to ask questions.
with that, um.
Literature, said the Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um.
I like this bill. I think it's
well written, it's clear, you
understand what has to happen.
Um, and I got a lot of calls. I,
they used to call my area Pill
Hill. It's nob Hill because
there are so many doctors that
live in the area.
And I've been talking to a lot
of doctors in the district, and
they've told me horror stories
about why their colleagues have
left. It wasn't malpractice, it
was the sale of hospitals to
these equity, these out of state
equity firms.
Basically changed the practice
of medicine for them.
And so I'm, I'm very happy to
see this bill. Um, there was a
couple of things in the and and
maybe it was because we, I just
got the
The analysis now, um.
It's, there was, I think it was
um the healthcare authority who
thought that uh.
The physician owner bills.
Independent group, oh here it
is, independent provider groups
should be excluded from this
act.
Who preserve the important
points of care they provide for
patients through New Mexico.
I couldn't figure out if that
happened in the in the
The substitute did it, Madam
Chair.
So Madam Chair, Senator, uh, it
is greatly narrowed for those
folks. Now it would only apply
to them, uh, to the extent that
they are being acquired by an
insurance company or affiliated
company.
So often
Optum, which is owned by
UnitedHealth.
Uh, goes around buying up.
Independent medical practices.
So it's really.
That will get captured, but not
by those practices wouldn't be
captured otherwise.
OK.
So it would be a more, more,
more a slimmer review.
Of, of
Of what happens or what their
plans are.
Because, um, at least a lot of
my.
Uh, people in my district really
bemoaned.
A loss of physician owned
hospitals and the, the way that
they're allowed to practice.
The way that they had to spend
no more than 150 minutes per
patient, the way they, they were
just, um,
It was fascinating to talk to
physicians and how the practice
has changed, particularly
As umin Hickey points out, the
finances.
Of, of medical um care because
of course it's not a right,
although I believe it should be.
Um, it's, it's a, it's a thing
that you purchase, and I think
when you take something that is
such an important fundamental
right in.
That there should be state
oversight about what is
happening and what these whether
this entity is buying it up.
Just to jack up.
Their profit margin or whether
This is actually indeed good.
For our state and, and I, like I
said, I think that this bill is.
is understandable. I was trying
to um figure out that issue.
Because it's not listed as an
exemption, um.
Of, of uh independent
physicians, I, I didn't see it
as a, so if, if you wouldn't
mind just telling me where it is
so that I can.
Better understand it.
Madam Madam Chair, Senator, yes,
let us find that for you.
And the truth be told is I was
just doing it very quickly here,
so I might have skipped it.
So Madam Chair, Senator, look on
page 6.
Down at the bottom, starting at
line 22.
And so this is
This is on this.
First page, it's saying uh what.
What the oversight applies to.
And so it also applies to
Number 3, proposed acquisitions
of one or more healthcare
provider organizations located
there in or in whole or in part
in New Mexico where the
employment of a healthcare
provider by a health insurer or
a person that is owned by or
affiliated with a help. So that
is an exemption. No, no, no,
that's who it applies to the
exemptions start on page 7.
That's sub B. Sub A is saying
who this applies to B is saying
who the what the exemptions are.
Yeah, I found that a little
confusing.
Um, so a changing control of the
hospital resulting from
election.
Hiring
So, so how can I tell that the
review of a.
An entity
That is.
One of the things that they
talked about are a few.
Um
Groups that were purchased by
Doctors.
And so where, what kind of
review with that change get if
they would just not happen.
More on, right, that just would
not be subject to this review.
Excellent. OK. That, um,
That was important to me to to
look at that and also to
because.
I just think that doctors should
be allowed to be doctors.
And when you have, um, and this
is just like the, the lawyer's
lawyer's profession, when you
have non-lawyers owning a
corporation.
The rules are that the lawyers
are supposed to be independent
from the corporate.
And, and that's what I think is
really important in medical care
as well.
And so, um, you know, and it's
something that we want to value.
Uh, but I do like this bill. I
think uh.
A lot of work into went into it,
and I thank you for all of that
work.
And as I said, um, the doctors
on Pill Hill.
Um
Almost uniformly were very uh
supportive of this idea.
Because they see it happening
and they've seen what it, what
happens in other states.
And some of them very much want
to work.
Want to see robust review.
Of these kind of financial
transactions it could be.
Purely for profit. I'm not
saying they always are, but
could be purely for profit and
not for the best interests of
the people of New Mexico.
So thank you for bringing
Thank you. Um, any other
questions?
Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
thank you.
My other madam chair, I have my
two favorite madam chairs in the
room at the same time, it's fun.
Appreciate that. And I wanna uh
just think, um,
Senator Sidil Lopez, um.
For her, her comments as well,
but I especially wanna thank uh
Doctor Hickey uh for his because
Um
He may be a young doctor right
out of med school.
But I think he's uh.
Linky's an expert and uh really
appreciate his opinion on this.
I have 2 hospitals in my
district, Rust and um Loveless
West side.
And I've talked to 3 CEOs.
The CEO of SRMC, the CEO of Russ
and the CEO of Loveless West
Side, and they're all against
this, and I've also talked to
several providers in my
district, um, at those
hospitals.
That are against this.
Um, I just kind of want to
understand the thought process
here of I, I looked and I think
you said or counsel said there
are other states that provide
the oversight, um, is that
correct?
Madam Chair, Senator, yes.
Uh, thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. Do we provide, does the
state of New Mexico, um, because
some states have it with the
attorney General that provides
the oversight, like, for
instance.
I was looking up the healthcare
of Massachusetts, um, and New
Hampshire and those two states
are in the top 3 of healthcare,
uh, providers, um, in the
country for various reasons of
access and cost and a bunch of
other things.
Um
But New Hampshire.
As an attorney general that does
the oversight, does New Mexico
have no oversight right now?
Madam Chair, Senator, yes, we
have no the only oversight we
have in place is that temporary
band-aid.
That we put in place last year.
Now you're right, oftentimes,
uh, this lives with the agent or
that state's version of RHCA.
Um, in this case, we are really
bringing well would primarily
live with the OSI because they
already do these kinds of
reviews in the insurance
contract context. It also would
bring in, it also brings in. And
so the AG, uh, we talked to the
AG's office when we were working
on this. They wanted to make
sure that
They would still have their
jurisdiction to.
Go after antitrust issues.
Um, and that they would be
getting notice of these
transactions so that they could
do that evaluation.
Thank, thank you, thank you,
Madam Chair, that brings up a
good point. So if
So they currently have some type
of oversight authority today in
New Mexico. Is that correct on,
on mergers?
Madam Chair,
Senator, no, they don't.
One of the, the issues that the
AG is tasked with.
Keeping an eye on is antitrust.
issues. Um, but that does not
mean that they have oversight
over over these transactions.
Uh, we also don't have.
Super strong antitrust laws
here.
So
They, that alone is not an
adequate remedy. It would also
be one that's too late.
That would, would come after.
Uh, New Mexican patients have.
Presumably, uh, been harmed by
the effects of.
Of that antitrust action.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, uh,
this sort of began with the
Presbyterian Unity merger.
Uh, I had
Sort of just come to the state
and uh ah I was Senator Hickey
and I spoke, uh, we call the
AG's office to see if they had
any jurisdiction and they
didn't, uh, the issue is a lot
of these transactions to avoid
oversight, have been doing what
they call cross market mergers,
so there is no traditional
antitrust issue and our attorney
general, unlike in some other
states like New York doesn't
have jurisdiction over mergers
and acquisitions of nonprofits.
So that's sort of how we.
We sort of got involved.
In that issue, and the only
reason.
The OSI had any view of what was
going on was because the
Presbyterian owned two insurance
companies and under the
insurance holding company law,
we, we had to go and look at who
the ultimate owner was and where
the ultimate control was gonna
be and it was gonna be in, I
think this was Idaho or Iowa,
Iowa, and that group, so that
that that was sort of how this
sort of came into play.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Um
You know, Doctor Hickey.
Uh, has worked in hospitals
either as a provider or on the,
on the business side, um, and
you talked about consultants and
I, I do business development and
consulting.
Uh, in a, in a different type of
market.
Uh, nuclear
And then with his experience, he
also talked, uh,
He talked to you guys about his
concerns on lack of investment
coming in.
Uh, how this would affect, uh,
access.
Healthcare costs to the
consumers, how poor New Mexico
is, which would just exacerbates
the problem as well as
potentially closing.
Rural hospitals.
Do you, do you share his
concerns?
Uh, with his years and years of
expertise on the provider side
and on the business development
side.
Uh, you, you share those
concerns as well with him?
Madam chair under, no.
So, let's take the rural
hospital that, the rural
hospitals will close down if
this happens.
So first of all, there is an
emergency closet here. It
essentially says,
If this, if there is an
emergency, if you are going to
shut down without this influx of
capital.
You get to bypass.
The process.
But no one is going to anyone
who is on the brink of closure.
It's not going to close because
they had this this oversight
happened.
And I just forgot what else I
was gonna say that's maybe I'll
jog your memory here
concerns regarding uh
investment.
Um, no, one, I mean, we've seen
that we folks are still coming
that we with SB 15 in place.
I mean,
I'm sorry, with, with the, the
what we have and put that
temporary band aid we have in
place right now.
We see folks continuing to come
in.
The other states where this has
happened, they don't see that no
one comes in anymore, but also,
Madam Chair Senator.
You feed a starving person
poisoned food.
Are you doing them much good?
We want healthy investment. We
want healthy capital coming into
our state. We don't want
Someone who comes in.
Extracts as much profits as
humanly possible, and then
leaves after an average of 7
years, sticking the hospital
with the debt. That is typically
what happens, especially with
the, the private equity
transactions. They come in, they
do this debt financing where the
hospital actually hasn't that
the debt, use the hospitals as
the asset, as the collateral.
And then they'd leave and then,
and they, and then they.
They shut down labor and
delivery, they get rid of a
bunch of their docs. They do all
this cost cutting stuff to
extract the maximum profit from
it.
And then they leave.
In an average of 7 years, and
the hospital.
is left with that debt.
It is a terrible deal.
Or New Mexicans and for our
hospitals. So folks who want to
do that, folks who want to
exploit our state.
Purely for their own profit.
That's not the kind of capital.
We, that, that New Mexico needs.
New Mexico definitely needs
capital. New Mexico needs
investment.
With good partners who care
about the impact that they're
going to have on New Mexicans.
That's what and that is what
we're.
We're aiming to, to attract with
this bill. Thank you, thank you,
Madam Chair. I, I, I would agree
wholeheartedly with you about
exploitation of uh New Mexicans
because.
New Mexicans have been
exploited.
With some of the legislation
passed.
Here in this house
malpractice with lawyers making
a lot of money.
And leaving us on the table.
Without with less access and
with higher costs.
So, yeah, there is different
variations of exploitation of
New Mexicans and as senator and
Doctor Hickey rightly pointed
out.
That's been a disaster for the
healthcare of New Mexico, uh,
which is why we're ranked near
the bottom.
One thing I want to say here is,
um,
Maybe you can just fill me in
on.
Your thoughts here, the, the
bill does not have a timeline
for approval. Is that correct?
Madam chair Senator, no, that's
not correct.
There, there is. Is it July 1st.
Various timelines in there for
the process. Uh, do you mean
when it would go into effect?
Is that what you mean?
It would be 90 days after, after
we adjourn.
I didn't have that highlighted.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
How, how does the bill ensure
the regulatory oversight that
you're advocating for does not.
Unintentionally make it more
difficult.
A rural hospitals to sustain
their operations.
And track needed investment uh
to provide the access to care.
Because
Sandoval County is an
interesting example.
Rust Hospital, uh, was, was
built with the help of, of
bonds. I think we would all
Agree with that back in.
Oh, back 202,010, 2012,
something like that, and it
became operational about 2015 or
so.
And one of the things that we
did in Sandoval County, the
voters did was they approved a
neonatal.
Um
Capability there
And when the voters a few years
later decided to
Not support that bond.
Um, we had a huge gap for need
neonatal care.
Uh, up in Sandoval County.
So that being said, when it
comes to the tax dollars aren't
being able to support it from
the bond side.
That's additional government
oversight, will that, do you
think, impact
Let's not talk about closures,
but let's talk about some of the
specialty cares, uh, that these
hospitals, uh,
May serve
Some chair and senator, correct
me if I am, I am misinterpreting
your question.
Um, you're saying so if there's
a
A proposed transaction.
With a and perhaps one of the
conditions of approval of that
transaction was you have to keep
providing that care.
And, and then they can't.
For for some reason either
because.
Because they don't have the
resources for for some purposes
that.
Uh, am I, am I signing up the
accurate scenario of what you're
asking about.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes, so
basically what I'm saying is,
If, if there is a, a merger
between
Um
Let's say it's an out of state
hospital.
And
Texas.
And they want to merge with one
of our hospitals here that
includes maybe a rural, couple
of rural hospitals or whatever.
And those hospitals are
providing some some type of
specialty care, urology or
oncology, whatever it is.
Would it be the role of this new
Um, oversight.
To not just either approve or
disapprove, but would they have
the option of doing
Of modifying
Uh, that merger.
As well
So, Madam Chair, so in a in a
situation like that.
They would, they would look at
the, the, the proposed
transaction.
And if the proposed transaction
included cutting essential
services, as they're defined in
here.
And a condition.
Could be placed on there, so you
have to keep the essential
services, but let's say
something happens, something
unexpected happens, who knows
what? And they just can't, they
cannot meet that condition. We
have created a pathway in here
for them to come to the
superintendent and say, look,
here's what's going on. I know
that condition was placed on us.
We can't meet it because of X,
Y, and Z. Will you excuse us?
Can, can we amend our conditions
and take that out.
And
She would say, and then assuming
the XYZ were legitimate, uh, she
would say yes, and those
conditions would be amended.
Thank, thank you, Madam Chair.
So they're, you're telling me
there is that flexibility
between
On each side of the spectrum of
disapproving and approving and
somewhere in between you would
modify that merger language.
Uh
Madam Chair, Senator, the way
this works, uh, is that we have
the the tiered approval or
disapproval or approval with
conditions process, and after
that there's what we call
monitoring and oversight to see
if you said you were gonna if
there are conditions you live up
to them, but there's also a
process after the after the
approval with conditions is in
place and the transactions
closed for the parties to come
back and say for valid reasons
we can't, you know, as as
Senator Hickey point.
out there may be a financial
issue they may not be able to
get a provider and they can't
keep up the quality, they can
come back and say.
For legitimate reasons, we can't
do this and we relieve them of
that, that obligation. Thank you
for that. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
What, what type of objective
risk management framework.
Uh, Senator Duha knows where I'm
going with this because we use
that in my private business.
When you're looking at as the
government oversight for these
mergers.
What type of objective?
Risk
Framework are you looking at?
to
Actually put empirical data.
To decide through your little
Um, a little flow chart, yes or
no. Madam Chair, so there's.
There's a list of the, the, the
issues that are are considered
in the bill, but in large part,
I think probably every
transaction is unique.
Uh, every transaction will, will
have its own unique issues, um.
And that that need to be looked
at. I think it would.
Other than establishing kind of
the basic issue, uh, categories
that are looked at.
I don't think we would want to
be.
Super duper duper, uh,
prescriptive about that because.
The way the these these
transactions happen in very
different ways and with very
different entities. So there
needs to be that flexibility to
adjust that's, that's fair.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I
appreciate that answer. Doctor
Hickey talked about on page 8
and section C. Let me just read
it to you here. Control is
presumed to exist if a person
directly or indirectly owns,
controls or holds 15% or more of
the power to vote.
Uh, or holds, I'm not gonna read
the rest, um, where, where did
you come up with the 15% number.
Why not, why not 15.7, why not?
50. Why not 22?
Madam Chair, Senator, that was
somewhat of a negotiated number
based uh when we were dealing
with uh when we were working
with the hospitals last year and
we, we came to a compromise on
15%, uh, in the insurance
industry, it's even lower, but
when we, when you talk to the
experts in these.
Transactions, there are many
ways people get control and uh
and can influence what's
happening in the hospital and,
and it isn't uh a simple 51%,
you know, voting like uh like
you do in uh, you know, security
situation.
Thank you. I appreciate that
answer. Thank you, Madam Chair.
I want to turn to section.
Um, 11, real quick.
I believe it's 6.
Uh, it's related to the fines.
Um, you are allowed OSI is
allowed to provide fines up to
$15,000 per day.
Uh, was that a negotiated number
with the hospital, um.
Folks.
Or is that like a standard
across the country on this.
Oversight stuff.
Madam Chair, senator, the fact
that they are civil fines as
opposed to criminal penalties
was a negotiated agreement.
With, with them, uh.
It started out with with
criminal penalties as there are
in the for for these insurance
transactions.
We heard loud and clear from
folks that they were very
uncomfortable with that and so
we changed that to a civil
approach.
Um, I'm sorry, could you repeat
that? Who was that? I didn't
catch that last part so we, we,
we did profound stakeholder
engagement on this bill over the
last year. And we heard loud and
clear from from hospitals from
providers, uh.
That that they were really
worried about having criminal
penalties. So one of the first
things we agreed to was to take
those out. OK, thank you. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Um, I
appreciate you working with the
stakeholders on that, just, uh,
real quick, um, when, when
you're assessing that fine.
Is there something built into
the policy of um appealing.
Uh, those findings and what's
the process of that and who
decides if it's a uh appealed or
not.
Madam Chair, uh, senator, all
these rulings, you can see we're
subject to the administrative
code. So if a party doesn't feel
the fine is fair, they can go to
the district court and raise
that. We were also very careful.
Uh, we looked at some of the
things that we do in the
insurance code to look at this,
you know, what, what really we
think uh changes behavior, of
course, we're not, it's not
scientifically done, but we're
if there's a.
What we were trying to do is is
just to understand that this is
a complex bill with somebody
make uh an inadvertent.
Um, mistake. We didn't want to
penalize them very.
Partially, but we did want to
and the $100,000 fine, we use
the phrase willful violation if
somebody knew they either were
ignoring this or gave us
misinformation, uh, that was
where we, we, those are the two
standards we were looking at.
OK.
Thank you, uh, thank you, Madam
Chair. Uh, lastly, I'll, I'll
just say that, um.
Senator Dee, you mentioned that
you had extensive stakeholder
collaboration, I believe, um,
even with those extensive
discussions.
The New Mexico Hospital
Association still cannot support
this bill.
And talking to the CEOs of 3
hospitals, 2 in my district, as
well as healthcare providers and
hearing Doctor Hickey.
Um
On here as
A Republican and a Democrat,
both with a lot of concerns, um,
I, I, I think we might need
based on, you know, the word I
just heard, this is very, very
complex, and
I think there's a lot of risk
involved, especially in New
Mexico. We have a lot of issues
already that we need to fix with
malpractice and tort reform, in
my opinion.
Losing too many doctors.
It worries me that some of our
providers that
Might be getting in their 50s
and 60s are gonna be gone soon
and we're not replacing them
here in New Mexico because we're
about 3000 nurses short and
roughly 700 doctors that we've
lost recently. I, I think this,
when I listened to, in my
opinion.
We all have opinions on who
experts are. My opinions on the
business side, the CEOs, my
opinion on the
Doctors and the nurses and the
PAs who have come out against
this.
Um, my two hospitals in my
district are adamantly against
this and would like to work with
you.
I and
And, and reach, you know, some
type of better agreement, like
Doctor Hickey was talking about
because there's
We, we got a mess, we got to
clean up first. I think this is
just um
More confusion
Uh, to our healthcare system in
New Mexico.
And I, I, I look forward to
seeing this bill come back at a
later time with some
Uh, a lot more support from the
hospital association.
And I know you did a lot of work
under Du Hague on this and
working with uh uh our partners.
I, I just think um.
We're not quite there yet.
But um
I want to thank you for the hard
work that you did and and you
as, as counsel and
You and the insured, what's your
title again?
That's right, so you're the big
part of this.
Absolutely, and I know you
worked hard too, so, uh, I am a,
a no, but
When people put forward a a good
4th effort to fix something,
it's
It's a good thing.
So thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Senator. Any other
senators for the first time for
a 2nd time, Senator Scott.
You're good?
OK. All right. I had you down
for a second.
Any other questions, Senator
Charley.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair, and
senator, um, DuPig, I uh wanna
to untangle a little bit what of
what I heard up here, um.
Um, from one of my colleagues,
which was.
Healthcare providers.
Aren't coming to New Mexico
right now.
And this would further
Inhibit
Providers
From coming here right now, if
we did this.
Um
That just feels a little.
It off to me because.
If we didn't, we'd still be in
that situation.
So putting this in place.
Wouldn't
Inhibit providers from coming.
Mantras under, no, in fact I
have, I have all along seen this
as a provider protection
measure.
This ensures that providers can
come and and work and not have.
are a for profit.
Focused persons interfering with
how they practice medicine, and
telling them you can only spend
5 minutes with your patients.
and you are not allowed to do
this and you can't do that
because that's not profitable
for us or you need to do all
these things, because that is
profitable for us. If that's not
what they think is appropriate
for the patients. So I think
this makes us a better
environment for providers.
Madam Chair, Senator, uh, we
have worked very closely with
the hospitals. Uh, we have a few
issues where we disagree, but I
think if you talk to them, they
would basically say, uh, we have
modified the bill and heard them
in many issues were probably
this far apart, but.
We are far apart and they're not
supporting it.
What we heard during the
outreach and again this was
something that the hospitals did
not uh object to was that a lot
of the hospital employees felt
that they were, you know, in
prior transactions, we heard,
you know, felt that they weren't
being able to practice the
quality of medicine that they
wanted to and so some of what
this is here, which when uh
senator do he mentions and also
representative Sapansky, uh, of
some of what we put in.
this bill was in response to
what we heard during that
outreach process.
Madam Chair, um.
Senator Duhe, thank you for
that. I always appreciate
intentional, um, outreach when
we're developing policy,
especially for impacted
communities, you know, some
people call them stakeholders,
but I, I think it's really the
people who are impacted, that we
should be centering in, in any
policy we're moving forward.
Um
About how much money do these
corporations who have merged.
Make on Medicaid reimbursement.
I don't know the answer to that.
Uh, I do know, as, as Senator
Hickey said, we don't have a big
commercial market here.
And a lot of people on Medicaid.
Um, so Medicaid is, is a large
percentage of
Of the revenue that does come
in.
Um, and Madam Chair, Senator, is
it safe for us to make the
assumption that they're making a
lot of money off of Medicaid
reimbursements in New Mexico.
Mocha senator, they're certainly
making money off of it. I can
tell you so, so ardent, which is
what owns Loveless. Uh, they
recently went public.
And when you go public, you, you
have to file a prospectus.
With the, the SEC.
Um, and so because I am, have
way too much time on my hands,
apparently I read that
perspective.
I can tell you in there, ardent.
Senator Hickey mentioned uh SB
17 that we passed last year.
Which gives hospitals in New
Mexico, uh, over a billion
dollars in in new revenue.
Ah, each year
Um
And Arden.
One of the things they said to
self, to, to, to try to get
people to buy their stock was,
oh my gosh, we're making so much
money off New Mexico.
Look at this state giving us all
this money with this bill that
they just passed, and we are
raking it in.
In New Mexico, so come invest in
us. So they are certainly
representing that to the public.
And to the SEC.
And they're representation is
under uh, you know, pain of uh
of incredible love perjury,
whatever these prospectuses are
held to a very high standard.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. What
I, what I'm trying to drive home
is that these billion dollar
corporations receive taxpayer
money in Medicaid, yet we have
no oversight, and they have no
accountability to us. So, um,
thank you. Um,
Why isn't this, uh, Madam Chair,
why isn't this easy? Why, why
don't these entities? Madam
Chair, senator.
I think it is very rare that
people want oversight, uh, and
that they invite oversight and
anything that can limit, uh,
their ability to, to profit as
they see fit, that it does not
surprise me.
That they don't want it, um, I
don't think we've ever.
Made decisions as a state about
what when we should do
appropriate oversight.
Or we should not make decisions
about.
Doing appropriate oversight
based on whether someone wants
to be regular.
Madam Chair, thank you.
Um
I just want to share a quick
story about when I moved back to
New Mexico about 11 years ago.
Um, I sought out a PCP with real
intentionality. I wanted to see
a woman of color. I wanted
someone who had her own
practice.
Um, I wanted someone who that I
that I felt safe with and could
relate to.
Um, and I had Tricare at that
time. I was a military spouse.
And she accepted my insurance.
And then I went through a
divorce and had Medicaid.
And she accepted that insurance.
And so I've been with this
doctor for over 10 years. Um,
she was just.
purchased by Optum.
Now she does not accept my
insurance.
And so I've paid out of pocket
because I trust my care
provider. Um, we have a over a
decade of a relationship built.
Um
And
I can tell you.
Through my lived experience.
That my that my care has
changed.
It's quicker
I used to go in there and be
able to lay everything out.
And this last time that I was in
there, she needed to schedule
another appointment for me or
something I thought we could get
through.
Um, and so I
I don't live in the city. I, I,
I go into the city for my
healthcare and it creates.
All of these additional
barriers.
Because the type of healthcare
that I received has changed,
because she, she has been
purchased by Optum.
Um
And I shared that from a place
of real privilege, um.
Knowing that patients were
experiencing this every day.
might not be able to navigate
the system the same ways that
many of us up here are able to
do.
Um, so I just have a
more questions, Madam Chair, um.
Senator to Hi, what's at risk if
we don't pass this legislation.
Madam Chair, uh, senator, um.
We are already
The state with the highest
percentage of hospitals owned by
private equity in the nation.
Uh, it is a continuing trend
around the country. It will get
more and more and more so, and
all of our healthcare.
Will be owned by.
By folks who don't have the best
interests of New Mexicans as
their primary focus.
I think
I, I, I, Madam Chair, senator.
But when we went out for the
outreach, a lot of the things we
found out with the past
transactions and what were the
problems? And they pretty much
duplicated what you're hearing
around the nation. And, and my
fear is that if other
transactions come, we're just
gonna repeat it. Many people
said, Can't you fix what
happened in the past? I said no,
this bill is only gonna be going
forward, but I think we'll just
replicate some of the some of
the terrible situations that we
heard about during the outreach.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator. I can completely
understand why it's needed right
now. My last question, Madam
Chair is, um, what is possible
if we do pass this legislation.
Maunder, that's a good question.
Um, I think, I think what's
possible is that we can ensure
as a state that we have healthy
investment.
That we have um.
That, that our medical system
is, is prioritizing the wellness
of New Mexicans. Uh, and
That we are making.
Thoughtful and better informed
policy decisions.
He as a body, uh, because we
have the benefit of this
oversight.
Madam Chair, thank you, I yield.
Thank you, Senator. Any other
questions?
Senator Novin.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator, for bringing the
bill forward.
Um
Madam Chair, uh, and senator.
This is a complex bill
nonetheless, um.
But I am grateful for.
The uplifting of transparency
and accountability.
And
In all clarity, I think it's
important that we note.
What the definition of an expert
is, uh, Madam Chair, and also.
The lived experiences of the
patients who we should be
absolutely standing up for.
And
Following, uh, Senator
Charlie's.
Um, comments.
I think it's important to note
that we absolutely have a
shortage of healthcare
providers, and we need to ensure
that we're working together to
incentivize and bring them
forward. And I appreciate you
acknowledging that.
Um, the way that I'm seeing this
is a bill to really bring
transparency forward to ensure
that
Medical providers are not being
taken advantage of. I will tell
you, uh, my sister-in-law is an
OBGYN.
She is doing her residence yet
rush.
She's an immigrant, she's a DACA
recipient, and Madam Chair, I
talked, I talk about this often
with her in terms of returning
home and what it's going to
take.
And we have a lot of these
conversations, Madam Chair.
And she wants to ensure that she
comes home to work.
With the people
Or an entity that will
appreciate and support her.
And not to be utilized by
private equity firms and the
concern here in terms of rural
and urban, um, is vast.
But
I think
The experiences of the
communities that are served by
our medical providers.
are extremely important.
And especially when I think of
underserved communities who has
access to this knowledge, who is
here testifying for or against.
speaks loudly.
And
Many of us may not be.
Subject matter experts, madam
chair and uh.
Senator
But many of us have been the
patient.
And as someone who had brain
surgery 3 years ago, and sound
repetitive now, but I think it's
important to note that we are
here to ensure that we do work
strategically and
collaboratively to recruit and
incentivize and uplift our
medical providers, but that we
also do it with accountability,
and the way that I'm seeing and
reading this, it is
accountability at the table, and
I appreciate that.
Um, and on that note, uh, Madam
Chairwoman and senator, I do
want to ask what happens, uh, to
the debt that the hospitals
acquired through private equity,
um, private acquisition after
the private equity corporation
resells after
Several years.
So Madam Chair, senator.
So during the interim, we have
these some folks, some
specialists from Harvard come
out and testify at a CCJ meeting
uh in Las Cruces all about this
and the hospital's stuck with
it.
Um, so what we saw with.
This is what happened with the
stewart, uh, transaction in
Massachusetts as well, um, they
are saddled with the debt and
then.
The private equity company moves
on.
Uh, keeping the profits.
With keeping the debt.
Uh, in the hospital is, is left
with it and is as and is and
has.
Be pared down.
Significantly, at the same time,
so.
Um, so they're.
Their services are, are reduced
and they're stuck with this
debt, um.
There in a big hole.
But I think it was Stewart was
impossible to to climb out of.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you
very much, Senator.
Thank you. Any other questions?
See none, Senator Hickey, I
think you.
had uh
Something to propose?
Thank you, Madam Chair. There
has been a lot of work in this,
but it's still not in the right
place and
potential outcomes.
They're also negative outcomes.
And this there are that there
are strong possibility and I
Um
Having worked in in the business
for a long time.
Uh, again.
What is missing in this.
So far
Is the input.
Of people who long money to
hospitals.
And what kind of oversight makes
it attractive, I believe there
needs to be.
I'm oversight. I was the one who
actually initiated this bill.
Last year
The um
With the Presbyterian mercher,
because I was so concerned that
it was a cultural.
mismatch.
The and and there are
Definitely situations like the
Stewart Hospital, but it's not
every
It's not every hospital. We're
kind of using anecdata.
Anecdotes
Make a point. We aren't looking
again, bringing people in who
can help us look across the
nation.
And in that vein.
Um, I believe that.
During the time that
This bill moves forward to the
judiciary.
That the sides.
Come together
Who, in my judgment, we need to
do this, we need to do it right,
and not, uh, you know, not have
a good intention.
End this up, you know, this is.
Yeah, end up paving the way to
hell for us and and we don't
get, we don't, we can't save
our, our rural hospital. We have
to be mindful of that.
And getting experts in who would
say under what conditions would
I find this an attractive place
to invest money, because
Unless we, unless we take our
billions.
That we're getting now and
literally build state hospitals
for, we're not gonna have.
Money to invest and, and the
federal government. I mean,
that's the other thing is is
that I really worry the damage
that is going to be done to this
state.
In about 3 months.
Bye.
The Trump administration.
And its impact on Medicaid, and
I think we need to understand
that.
We need to understand.
Uh, as someone
And me, I bet we have another
special session.
After the impact.
Of what the Trump administration
does to Mediate us.
And we need to consider all of
those things. And, and so I'm
hoping
That we could before the next
committee.
Find a way to put together.
Not just
One group of people, but again,
bring in
Experts who can say, how do you
become attractive?
To get the capital because I
just don't think we're gonna get
it otherwise. And it's a capital
intensive industry.
Uh
So in that vein.
Um
And, and, and I would hope then
that we would really bring in
experts over the next year and
write a bill where we know we're
gonna be able to attract.
The funding
One way or the other, and we'll
also know what's going to happen
with Medicaid.
Which I think is
Right now, the prognosis is
really
Not good.
So, um,
If that could be worked out.
between the committee meetings
and the judiciary.
I think that is the way to to go
forward. We really need to know.
Um, before we put this bill in
place, which I think number of
potential investors, and this is
from my experience in Phil, and
there are good investors.
That they would
Find it attractive.
To invest in New Mexico, and
that's what I'd like to see done
over the next year. So I am
proposing.
Uh, with that.
A little soliloquy that we
Uh, move this forward.
The judiciary with a no wreck.
And that we start looking at how
do we bring in experts.
And I would hope that there'd be
an agreement.
put this off for one more year
to get that expert advice on how
to be a place.
It really works and, and perhaps
we can get some insight into how
do we make it attractive.
For clinicians as well.
Um
But
That
We
We get that done in the interim
as you work with the hospital
association and the other
hospitals who are opposed to
this.
Um, and see if maybe we can roll
it one more year and really set
up a true
Unbiased.
Set of experts looking at
multiple issues, and, and I
agree.
There's a lot of bad things that
are happening. I mean, I'm, I
was the one who identified New
Mexico 2013 is the fifth most
profitable state for hospitals.
When you look at cost reports,
but it's being able to bring in
that kind of expertise, looking
at how do we do a really good
regulatory format. We look at
with all due respect, where is
the best place?
Or that oversight.
Is it in the attorney general's
office. Is it in the insurance
office. Is it in the HCA.
But I think we need the time,
so.
I, I propose a uh
Uh, that we do a note, we passed
this bill with a no
recommendation and let it go on
to
Thank you. Uh, thank you,
Senator. Is there a second?
Madam Chair,
If that was a motion, it was out
of order.
Because of
Question and answer.
Right.
Yeah
Oh, all right, I made a speech
and someone else needs to make
the motion.
No, I appreciate that the
clarification. Thank you.
Madam Chair, I will move.
The table
OK, there's a motion to table.
There is no debate.
And uh there's no second needed
on a motion to table. If you
could call the roll, please.

And before we call the vote,
Senator Gallegos to explain your
vote.
I appreciate it, um.
I guess before I left the room,
I was very, very impressed with
Senator Hickey and all the
reasons he found fault in your
bill.
Um, because of what he had said.
Uh, I see the value in looking
at this here in this committee,
the people bring us to the point
that we are supposed to correct
issues.
I kicking down the road to the
next committee, so I
Regretfully
Um
And in opposition to just
Making someone else repair.
For a bad bill to go somewhere
else to be repaired.
I find fault in that so.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, so on a vote of 6 to
4, uh, your measure.
Moves forward to Senate
Judiciary.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, members.
Senator Si Lopez.
Cenel 26.
Protection against abuse and
violence.
Good afternoon, madam chair, um,
This is a bill that um
Was worked on by a task force.
Over the course of a full year,
and then it's been kind of
reviewed a little bit since
then.
Um, including by members of this
committee.
And conversations with
individuals.
Um, in judiciary, different,
different things, so it's um
It's really been a labor of
love. The the and who I have
here with me is my expert Mary
Ellen Garcia, who served on the
task force.
Of course, when she was with the
CVRC they led the task force and
the CBRC is the
The commission, what is it?
Crime victims reparations
commission, um, and then, and I
apologize for taking out my off
my mask, is that OK, madam
Chair, I just was.
Um
Thank you. So, um,
So where was, so she both served
on the task force when she was a
member of the CBRC, the Crime
Reparations Victims Commission,
and also is now the executive
director of the Coalition to
Stop Violence Against Women.
Um, and so she was very familiar
with this bill, um.
And this bill, it looks like a
long bill, but it's not, um, and
I noticed in the FIR they
referred to things in the bill
like removing firearms as if it
was new in the bill. That was
not the case. That was an
amendment to this bill that was
passed in 2019, so that is not
part of this new, new bill. What
is part of this bill is it has a
definition of credible threat.
Uh, because the bill before then
said a firearm could not be
removed without a credible
threat, and that's really
important because the US Supreme
Court, um, upheld the removal of
firearms from uh individuals who
have um who are credible threat
of victims of domestic violence,
uh, just believe it was last
year or the year before, um,
that was actually one of the
stumbling block blocks for this
bill when it first came up
because that case was had just
been um granted.
to go to the Supreme Court and
so they, uh, uh, the judiciary
Committee wanted to see what was
going to happen with the court
and whether these kinds of bills
were going to be found to be
constitutional and under this
present court this kind of bill
was found to be constitutional,
um, and so what we're doing is
we're defining credible threat
for consistency and to help any
courts review it, understand
what is meant by credible
threat, um, and by consist
consistency, I mean, just having
the language of credible.
meant that some judges would
say, well, he never, uh,
threatened her with a firearm,
so not a credible threat and
some judges would say, oh my
God, there's 5 times more likely
to be uh a murder in a home with
domestic violence and the
presence of firearms, that's a
credible threat. So that
inconsistency um would be
addressed by the definition of
credible threat. Now it's, it's
a.
A lot of the bill is just.
Um, updates to the language to
address issues that have been
raised in uh clarity issues that
have been raised in in prior
committees and also um
To update the bill to prior to
current practice, like now, uh,
for example, it gets rid of the
idea of a mutual restraining
order. And the reason for that
is a mutual restraining order,
um, is not granted by the courts
um anymore, and they have been
they've had training and they
understand it's better to
identify the primary aggressor.
Um, and that way they can make
sure that there's protections.
What happens with the m mutual
uh restraining order is both of
the individuals are
disadvantaged by the mutual
restraining order and so that
again it's really um an
amendment to change practices, I
mean, you know, to, to make it
consistent.
The other big change is that
we're adding the the task force
has had plenty of experience
with um.
Abuse of animals.
Um, and that is now um regarded
as abuse, abusing um animals is
now um.
A factor that would be
considered in determining
whether there should be a
restraining order.
Um, there is also definitions of
stocking, um, oh, and, and most
importantly, um, family violence
is changed.
Um
To abuse and is uh what is it P?
Yeah, protection against the
juices and abuse and violence,
partly because animals are not
necessarily, although many of us
think they are family, um, but
to, to broaden it, and it also
broadens it, um, broadens it to
include, for example, stalkers
who are not necessarily a family
members and it broadens it to
include um.
Um
Yeah, kidnapping, false
imprisonment restrictions on
prohibiting movement, telephone
harassment, internet harassment,
um, these are on page 30
interference with communication,
exploitation, or forced criminal
activity, criminal damage to or
deprivation of real or personal
property or damage to jointly
owned or community property,
harm or threatened harm to
children.
Harm or threatened harm to an
animal, as I just said, and
authorized distribution of
sensitive images, one change to
the bill since last time we
brought it is we define
sensitive images. Um, I noticed
in the fur, it said, oh, they
need to decide to uh define um.
Sensitive images and I guess
they may have gotten that from a
prior file because we did in
this bill it's um images are are
uh sensitive images are defined
and then a criminal trespass or
threats to disclose immigration
status, and this is very
important when I was the
executive director of Elasse
that was a huge tool of abuse,
uh, and control was to threaten
uh authorities. In fact, one of
the cases that was most
heartbreaking to me at in Los
Meario was when we had a young
woman from Mexico. She's only 19
years old. Come with her
boyfriend to the United States
and then uh he put her out for
prostitution.
And so, um,
And of course he kept her under
control with threats to disclose
immigration status, um, on page
33 is the definition that I just
mentioned, sensitive images
means images, photographs,
videos, or other likenesses
depicting or simulating an
intimate act or depicting any
portion of a person's genitals
or of a woman's breast below the
top of the areola that is either
uncovered or visible through
less than fully opaque clothing,
which images may reasonably be
considered to be private,
intimate, or inappropriate for
distribution or publication
without that person's consent.
So that, that is now considered
abusive under this protection
against violent act.
Um
This, um, it also, and the truth
is, is AOC is very good about
providing language access, but
this just puts in statute that
language access is required, um.
You know, and AOC understands
that's a that's an aspect of.
Of due process and so it's
really just recording what they
actually do, um.
Then it says, um, oh, and
another difference that's pretty
significant is an order of
protection may be issued to
protect or restrain a minor.
Um, before that, individuals had
to be of the age.
That is over the age of 18, and
a lot of this happens with
minors as well, especially in a
teenage abuse situations.
Um
And so, um, that specified on
page 35, a minor who is 13, age
of years of age or older and a
victim of abuse may petition the
court for an order of protection
on the minor's own behalf of the
minor files a petition.
For protection against a person
with whom the minor shares a
child or a person with whom the
minor has a continuing romantic
relationship or that contains
allegations of stalking and
sexual assault. So this is a
pretty important because
sometimes parents.
Don't help their child with this
kind of situation, they're
embarrassed for whatever reason,
and that, that allows the minor
to do it on her own.
Um, there we, there's also um a
part on page 37 that's pretty
important because um.
This allows a law enforcement
officer to to petition for an
emergency order protection in
writing or orally in person by
telephone or other electronic or
digital means. Um, and this is
really important because in the
heat of the moment, sometimes
you need an immediate order of
protection. You can't wait for
the victim to go to prison, to
go to the courthouse to apply to
wait for a hearing and do that.
We need police offices to
officers to to take um immediate
um.
Action. The task force included
law enforcement personnel, and
they wanted this. They wanted to
be able to protect the victim.
This, this wasn't seen as a
burden on them. This was seen as
a as a tool.
Um
And then, of course, um it just
specifies the process for that,
which is, which is actually the
process for in in other um.
In other situations, especially
during COVID, which is they
could get this by phone.
Um
Then you'll notice that family
violence is is stricken out
throughout um throughout the
bill and put protections.
Protection against abuse and
Violence Act again to to further
the theme that you don't have to
be a family member to uh to get
this, I would say more intimate
partner violence and violence
against animals, um.
Then, um then it also um.
On page 40 again, this is just
to um.
Document with the courts are
actually doing in the processes
that they've they've uh.
They've developed, um, when
appropriate award temporary
custody and visitation or
supervised visitation with any
child and give primary
consideration to the safety of
the protected party and the
children.
Um, that needs to be at the
forefront.
Um
And then D on page 41 is pretty
important because sometimes when
people go get their petition,
they're very emotional and they
don't write enough there to
justify a petition, so this
allows the court to have a
hearing within 72 hours to allow
the petitioner to provide
additional information.
Um, instead of having this just
denied and again, because people
are so emotional. This is really
important to allow them to kind
of calm down, get their
situation, and look at the look
at the request and make sure
that all of the elements of
getting um an order are met.
Um, and then let's see um.
The other, these other ones are
just language changes.
Oh, on page 43, a child custody
and visitation order issued with
the order of the protection may
only be effective for a period
of 6 months.
Any custody or visitation order
may be extended for good cause
shown for no longer than
additional 6 months. This is
because we want people who are
in a domestic violence to have
time to make a choice about what
they're gonna do. Are they gonna
leave the situation or they, you
know, what's gonna happen and
the 6 month deadline allows, uh,
you know, requires that if
they're gonna have to go back to
court, um, there, you know, it's
just not gonna be indefinite and
so it's gonna require them that
they go to court.
Um
And then, um.
Of course they may issue the
order of protection between the
parties for a period of time
independent of any custody or
property action. This is when,
um, parties are in a divorce
section and then an incident of
abuse happens, um, so that the
court can, and the truth is many
of them already did issue an
order in the middle of a divorce
proceeding.
Um, and, and that's important
because sometimes the most
dangerous time is when an
individual leaves a domestic
violence situation that's.
That's when violence occurs.
Um
And then 43, I believe the
animal rights people, I don't
know if they're here, but they
really love the idea about um.
custody.
They may grant to a party the
exclusive or shared possession
and control of any animal kept,
owned, or leased by either party
or by the minor child or minor
minor children, cause we found
that sometimes people don't
leave an abusive household
because of the pets.
Um, and so, and we know and I
know that uh my expert has more
details about this. A lot of the
shelters are taking that into
account in allowing pets, um,
now, um.
So, and then the court may order
a party to stay away from the
animal and may forbid a party
from taking, transfer, and
concealing, mistreating,
harming, or disposing of the
animal, because those kind of
threats can really affect an
individual's ability to leave
the home or or to take further
action, not necessarily leave
the home, but to take further
action.
Um, this on page 44 that the
court may not order that the
protected party participate in
treatment or counseling related
to abuse this is actually um
very critical. It's a
requirement of voa in, you know,
this is what states should do.
They should not force, um, the
individuals when I was in Unas
we actually had one of our
clients, they did.
A mutual order of protection and
they put our client in a
batter's intervention program,
and she was not the primary
batterer, so here she was
participating in a batter's
intervention program that was
really inappropriate for her and
it was a huge hassle to get her
out of it, um, so number 10 is,
is, uh, very important.
Um
And then, and then I'm 45 is
the.
The, this is just clarifying
that the order of protection
when appropriate, will contain
notice that restrained parties
are prohibited from owning or
possessing a firearm while the
order of protection is in
effect.
Um, and again this is just
clarifying what is existing law
this already was here. Firearms
prohibition shall apply to
stipulated orders and to
contested orders when the
response has been served.
And in addition to this being
existing state law, it's also
federal law.
Um, so it's not, it's not new,
this, this provision is, is
really not new.
Um
And then on page 46, um.
This is just about uh proof of
service and clarifying if a
party fails to appear, um, then
the court can issue an order and
then mail it and that's adequate
service. It's just clarifying
again, this is what courts have
been doing, uh, but just
clarifying in statute that that
that is appropriate.
Um
Um, again, it just explains
service of order is again what
they've uh.
They've uh done the order is
provided to the parties or the
party's attorneys, it should be
filed and provided to the
parties and the local law
enforcement agency without cost
to the protected party, and
that's also um important to
because a lot of people don't
have money to make sure that the
order is served.
Um
See if there's anything else
that's of note.
Again, these are just uh changes
in language, um.
You know, changing family
violence protection to
protection against abuse and
violence.
On these pages.
Oh, and this, um, on page 50,
there has been some confusion
around the state about um.
People have some courts have
thought that an anger
management.
Program is sufficient to deal
with domestic violence and what
the data shows is really what is
required is a specific program
dealing with.
With um
Well, they call them bis,
batter's intervention program
dealing specifically with the
abuse of power and control in a
relationship which is different
from anger management.
Um
And so that just clarifies that
the data supports it.
Um
Again, these are just language
changes.
Um, the courts again just
language changes to make to make
the, the thing hang together
saying what this is protection
against violence is abuse and
abuse instead family violence
protection.
Um
On page 52.
Um
This is actually addressing the
mutual restraining order issue.
Um, this says instead of when
appropriate.
It it's clear when the officer
has information, if one of the
parties acted in self-defense.
Or the party arrested was a
predominant aggressor. It's just
asking the and and there's been
a lot of training on this asking
law enforcement to evaluate the
situation and not just do the
easy thing and cite both of
them.
But to really look at the the
circumstances and and gather
that evidence about who's the
who's the primary abuser instead
of just saying this looks like a
free for all fight.
Um, and
A lot of times people who were
defending themselves end up in.
In trouble
Um
So
Um, and again this is just again
what good police officers do,
they identify and document in
the criminal complaint and
police report names and
relationships between people
present at the incident,
including any additional victims
or witnesses, and this, this is
really important to be able to
prosecute the case if the victim
decides she.
Sometimes victims do not want to
proceed for whatever reason they
could be intimidated. They
could, you know, in all honesty,
these victims.
are often in relationships where
they really love their partner.
Um, and so this just allows for
more evidence to be gathered so
the case might be carried
forward even if the victim does
not want to proceed, although I
will say that most um most law
enforcement kind of relies on
the victim and with the victim
because the victim is really the
best um.
The best individual to know
about her safety or his safety.
Um
Then, um,
Oh, and this is uh the next one,
We changed a reasonable attempt
to on page 52 to reasonable
efforts to notify the arresting
law enforcement agent agency and
the victim if the alleged perpe.
Perpetrator of abuse escapes
from custody or is released from
custody or is transferred to
another facility. Again, that is
another.
period of time in which.
The victim is at most risk.
Um, and so it's very important
that they that the victim be
notified and the victim have an
opportunity to go to safety.
Um
Again, these are just language
changes changing family violence
protection against abuse and
violence, um.
Oh, and this, uh, just a def a a
clarification on medical
personnel. The old language said
medical personnel is a little
bit confusing about who what's
who's a medical personnel, so a
health care professional who's
interviewing, examining,
attending, or treating a person
and that um.
And that receives a report. So
this is just broadening who can
document the nature of the abuse
in the elec uh.
Perpetrator if they're disclosed
again just broadening who can
who can uh take these cases on.
Um
Again, health language changes,
medical personnel change to
health care professional on page
54.
Page 55.
Goes on to again to uh define.
Um, who's a health care
practitioner, somebody and when
expansion is a person who works
under the guidance and
supervision of a licensed
healthcare practitioner.
Um
And then a health care
practitioner in training,
including a student, a resident
or an intern and then a licensed
emergency medical technician, so
it doesn't always have to be a
doctor or a nurse, and it can be
someone trained.
Um
And
Um
The 57 was actually AOC asked
for this because they wanted
clarity about which orders
needed to be filed in a national
database and um and this does
that for uh AOC just makes it
absolutely clear, and that was
requested by them, as I
understand it, um.
And I believe that's it, um, I
would like to ask my expert if
she has anything to say.
Thank you, Senator, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, thank
you so much, um, I just wanna
kind of highlight uh Senator
Sadia Lopez said in the 2020
session it was incredibly um
powerful for senator Soo Lopez
to call the crime victims
reparation commission and say we
need to really look at the
Family Violence Protection Act
and amend it and ensure that it
aligns with what we know as best
practices regarding serving
survivors of intimate partner
violence in the state of New
Mexico and address some of the
issue.
issues that we had seen where in
practice we were doing what
aligned with federal laws and
best practices, but in statute
was not happening. And so during
that legislative, uh, during
that time in 2020, so it's been
five years. So as Senator Hickey
said, I, I, I agree sometimes
really complex legislation, it
takes 234, well, we're on your
5, so this is the the golden
year in which I hope that it
gets, it gets passed, and I
wanna highlight that it was over
30 professionals, 3 of which are
here in the room today.
Who sat and spent over 700
committee hours looking line by
line, word by word, comma by
comma, um, and those are just
the the committee hours that
does not include the
subcommittees that looked at
certain sections and really
addressed what uh we needed to
change, and those were experts
from survivor services, law
enforcement, judiciary, civil
legal services, criminal legal
services, child protective
healthcare, we had our
indigenous relatives who
participated.
And we engaged in, um, what I'd
like to call rigorous
discussions, uh, which often
ended up in heated debates, um,
and there were times in which
folks did storm out of the room
because you have incredibly
passionate people who are
talking about something that
impacts everything that we do
every day, intimate partner
violence affects every aspects
of our lives, and we wanted for
this to be done well and done
right. And so even the name
protection against abuse.
and Violence Act was something
that was talked about for many,
many sessions to really look at
how do we as a state, um, look
at the act and and create um,
you know, those experiences that
we have in the field. You know,
for example, we know that under
the Violence Against Women Act,
it mandates that you cannot just
say no to an order of protection
being filed, that you have to
offer a hearing.
And so we know that in practice
that was happening. But it was
not clearly articulated and
defined. We know that mutual
orders of protection, as Senator
Celia Lopez said, is actually
against federal statute and
federal law, but we still had it
on the books and so how do we
and counseling mandates, that is
something that cannot be
mandated, we know in best
practices, we know that, you
know, requiring survivors to
attend counseling is something
that is counter to what we know
in the movement and what we know
federally to be acceptable. And
So we looked at all of those
pieces and, and, um.
And addressed what credible
threat meant, renaming and
redefining each section to align
with what was being um, what we
know was happening in community,
what we know is happening in our
criminal and civil justice
systems and what our
community-based providers, um,
were defining it expanded and
clarified the definitions. We
really looked for plain language
so that it was clear to those
who are executing those, this,
this piece of legislation, our
law enforcement, our judiciary,
that it is.
clear that it is clear what
credible threat means so that we
can ensure survivor safety and
offender accountability, um, you
know, some of the pieces that
have been talked about in the
last couple of years in which
it's been presented was
conversations around what does
pets mean? And many of us had
long conversations because I can
sit here for hours, um, and tell
you stories of individuals who
did not leave relationships, not
just for their pets, but for
their for each animals where you
have children who have, you
know.
The goats and the lambs and the
pigs, and they, the, the spouse
who's being abused and the
children who are being abused
wouldn't flee that relationship
because they couldn't securely
get themselves and those pets
out of that or those animals,
um, uh, my nephew would be
remiss if I called his his
forage animals pets, um, but you
know, really helping them get
out of those relationships and
so we really looked at those,
those definitions and that
process, um, you know, some of
the pieces around police reports
and ensure.
that it was very clear to law
enforcement, this needs to be
done. We know many of you are
doing it, you're trained to do
it, but let's put it in statute
so that it's a requirement,
because we know that when you
list those individuals, it can
assist in the prosecution
process. It can also assist in
the victim compensation process,
which is an afterthought, right?
But if you think about that, if
you include the children in the
police report, which are not
often included. They are
victims. They are survivors in
our opinion. Once.
added in that police report,
what it does is it opens up
eligibility for victim
compensation and long-term
access to the to the
compensation process, which
reduces adverse childhood
experiences, so.
I, you know, I wanna, I don't
wanna reiterate all the
wonderful things that Senator
Celia Lopez has said, but I
think with any massive piece of
legislation that changes the
fabric of what we do to align
with who we are and and what we
know about this, about abuse in
our homes, um, it, it had
compromise. Is it absolutely
perfect?
No
There's no piece of legislation
can be, but it is as close to
perfect as we can be, and I can
say that in reviewing other um
abuse and violence against
prevention and Acts of the 52
states in the 56 states and
territories across the country.
This is gonna be one of the
strongest that is out there, and
I think as you know, as a state,
that is something that we should
put our mark on is to say that
we have built a community of
intolerance for abuse in our
homes and that our legislation
supports that, and.
our community and coordinated
systems are well equipped and
prepared to handle that.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, thank
you, Senator Celia Lopez for
bringing this forward.
And I would be remiss in in
neglecting that uh Senator
Charlie was part of this task
force and I believe today signed
on to the bill.
Very pleased about that. Should
probably sit here, but
Thank you, Senator. We'll go to
the audience. Is there anyone in
the audience in support of this
legislation.
And if you are, if you could
please stand here in the middle.
And use the microphone.
Identify yourself and.
Your statement, please.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
Deborah Conda with Animal
Protection voters, and boy, this
has been a long road, this bell,
and I, I think in the early
2000s, it was your be where we
included the animals. So, um, so
I, we stand in strong support of
this legislation. I just wanna
highlight a couple of
statistics, uh, on the links
between animal abuse and human
violence, 68% of survivors, uh,
delay leaving their abuser out
of fear for the safety of
animals if the animals are left
behind.
71% of abused survivors entering
domestic violence shelters
report that they're a batter had
harmed, killed, or threatened
family pets for revenge or
control. 91% of survivors say
their animals emotional support
and protection are significant
in their ability to survive and
heal. We urge you to vote yes
and help both the animals and
the human family stay safe and
escape abuse. Thank you.
Good afternoon, chair and
members of committee. My name is
Kat Sanchez, the policy director
for Bold Futures. We are a
reproductive justice
organization by and for Black
indigenous women and people of
color in New Mexico. Uh, we
stand in support of this bill
and urge it to pass. Thank you.
Anyone else's support?
Anyone in opposition?
See none. We'll go to Zoom.
Was there anyone? No? No? OK.
Uh, with that, then we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Senator Pinto.
So in here you had something
listed about current address.
You, um, expand on that.
Secretary of State will forward
it to the address, keeping the
address confidential.
In man chair members of the
committee, so I'm looking on.
I
Something about the application,
uh.
Method of registration.
Uh, what page, Madam Chair?
For
age 14.
statement informing the
applicant that if the form is
submitted by mail, the
applicant, blah blah blah,
registering.
utility bill, bank statement.
shows the name and current
address of the.
I really think
I'm not sure how to.
Um
When you talk about utility
bill.
Ending on where they're
residing.
You talk about bank statement.
check.
Cause I don't think student
identification and I'm not sure
I know we have a Navajo Nation
identification, but I'm not sure
what address they're using. I
don't know if they're using
physical address.
Because I know our voter
registration and I ran into it
with this year's voter
registration.
is the county clerk entered the
register address differently
than what I had.
my motor vehicle department.
Mm
Physical and then the the system
rejected.
What I'd put in.
So there's some
Some issues with that.
Um
When we talk about the second
form, I, I
Trying to
Yeah, that name and
I just wanna make that come.
Thank you, Madam Chair. That's
an excellent point. Um, it is
existing language, um, because
it's so expansive, including
identification issued by an
Indian nation tribe or Pueblo
that shows the name and current
address of the applicant and if
the applicant does not submit da
da da um.
This is, this is actually um was
a uh voting rights thing.
To allow people to be able to
vote without having their cuz
the thing is our voting records
are.
Uh, public.
And this was to protect that
information and if there's
better language to ensure that
no tribal members are left
behind by this, uh, this was
originally drafted, that's not,
it's not something that the task
force considered amending, but
if you have a better language
that would be more inclusive.
Um, I think it's clarity.
Because
Some people, my current address
is my mailing address.
And when you fill it out and and
that's where we run into some of
the forums, uh, with the.
Government forms when I fill
out.
This current address, then I put
my
That's where I get my mail,
yeah.
Go to the bank, that's what I
put on there.
And then they want my physical
address. I put that in and then
the bank tries to send.
My bank statement to my physical
address where there's no and
then I don't have, yeah, and
then I don't get it because it
does and it gets returned to
them.
Um
I think it just needs clarity. I
don't know if we put mailing
address, physical address, I'm
not sure what to.
where to go from there as far
as.
that's an excellent point. May
I, uh, defer to my expert, uh,
Madam Chair, Senator Pinto, so
this is this this section was
origin is was in there and the
task force left it as it was, as
it.
Discusses the safe at home
project.
That specifically goes through
the Secretary of State. And so
they do that through the um
applicability, the way in which
it's uh administered through the
Secretary of State and
particularly the, the deputy
secretary Sharon Pino, they,
that is incredibly expansive. So
they try to include the.
Um, for lack of a better word,
Senator Pinto, the kitchen sink
so that they could utilize any
documentation to allow an
individual who's a survivor to
then enroll in that that
program, so that they're male
and mailing address and voting
records could go through the
Secretary of State, and then
they could utilize their, their
information to send that that
information to either personal
mailbox or whatever, and so, um,
it's really through the delivery
of that service through the
Secretary of State.
In their policies that creates
that expansiveness.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my understanding.
I.
Ma I'm sure that's, that's
absolutely correct, and I've had
to deal with this with uh
election challenges.
Um, because of the, the
complication of these addresses,
um, because many people in rural
communities only have a PO box
and their physical address is,
you know, going down road 55
miles and turning it the.
You know, turning at the mile
marker or or whatever, um, but
this.
Our understanding is this has.
Works, um.
And so it hasn't uh been
changed.
If you believe that it needs to
be.
Um, let us know and we'll, uh,
Really figure that out, but we,
we did get real positive
feedback about this program.
But certainly we.
You know, the more people who
have eyes on this to make sure
this is the best bill we can
have.
Is is better has over time we've
fixed little things that people
have raised and so that would be
another one we'd be happy to
fix.
Madam Chair, the committee. The
reason I say because some of
I wouldn't say so in several
instances in different ways, um.
Like people because of their
address.
And saying, well, you live on
the reservation.
Yeah, but it
But I get my mail over here.
Um
And then vice versa.
You know, in the
The physical address thing and
then there's, well, go back to
your tribunal or anything.
Um, even though.
Some of this, and sometimes they
get off the reservation because
they know.
Well, they're hoping to get
service.
And yet they're not able to.
Establishing
Ah
The reservation because of
So, I'm just trying to really
make sure I don't have people
coming back to me.
And saying, yeah, this, this is
my, this is the story I have and
then I went to the CBRC went to
and I got rejected.
Because of this.
Knowing that they're really
trying to.
Getaway or because of the
situation.
So I think they're they're.
I understand the clarity and the
way it worked, um, but.
There are some instances where
people were um they'll put back,
it's not very great and then I
lose confidence.
And
Off of it
Madam Chair, absolutely, and um
I'd be happy to connect you with
the Secretary of State's office.
Um, so maybe we could come up
with language that was better.
It was viewed that this was
very.
Expansive and inclusive of
people's situations, but if
it's.
Insufficient
We, we'd be happy to work on
that. Madam Chair, in that sense
too, do we, um
You're saying now
Um, so electronic forms not
talked about time of of the
committee.
In which the police officer, you
know.
Let's do this right here and
make sure we establish
protection right away.
But you see, well, this
application is not to mail it
in, wait for the mail to go
through.
Over many days, um, is there any
alternative to make sure we have
a even quicker.
Application process.
Madam Chair, uh, Senator Pinto,
so this particular section that
you're speaking of is very
specific only to the safe at
home project, which is
specifically for male only, not
electronic mail or other forms.
It's specific for male and
protection of voter rights, um,
and we've been actually working
with deputies, um.
Deputy Secretary Sharon Pino to
um expand that program, um, as
it's now under her um purview,
um, and um she is, you know,
been one of the experts in the
state of New Mexico around
intimate partner violence and so
they're definitely working on
that particular section to
ensure that it is expansive as
possible and we work with
survivors frequently and
actually, um, all of the staff
at the secretary of uh.
Secretary of State just attended
the core of this advocacy
training last week, um, to
continue to expand the uh the
services that they offer, um,
with regard to service of orders
of protection. I can't say that
the task force in looking at
this really did expand
accessibility in the service of
orders of protection, including,
um, um, ensuring that um.
Um, you know, uh, that it could
be served by mail or email or
other provisions to the um to
the respondent to um, you know,
in in our line to the offender
to the offending party, and so
it's really expanded that
because we know that without
this change, the respondent
frequently decides to evade
service and then that order
continues to get continued and
it never gets issued, and then
it's never enforceable.
This really looked at what was
happening in the field to fix
that, that, that those who, you
know, know the system we're
evading it or they couldn't be
found because they're the
physical address wasn't
something easy to to articulate
and so on that section with
orders of protection, um, we
tribal law enforcement,
indigenous law enforcement
really looked at how do we, how
do we increase?
Service of orders, um, in our
rural communities and in
communities and and really look
at where we are technologically
that, um, you know, some of us
don't check our mail for 357, 15
days, but we check our email.
Every 30 seconds. And so they
really did look at that.
And uh Madam Chair, that would
be on page 37, at least of my
copy.
I, I think it might be different
on the online.
Yeah, it's on uh section 12.
Um,
Section 12A.
And be.
Is the expansion.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee.
Um, through the bill too, you
have um from a local law
enforcement agency and a um
Are we
And I presume.
Assume that our
Federal officers, tribal
officers don't have to be
listed.
Or is that?
tribes nations,
our understanding is there must
be an MOU that we, we couldn't.
That
I put it, um, that that process
must take place.
That reciprocity thing, we can't
just like magically say.
The state has jurisdiction, you
know what I mean? It has to be
an MOU process.
Yeah, members of the clean, and
I just want to clarify that it's
an opt in because of the
sovereign nation. Absolutely.
That's why.
That has not changed Mr. Chair.
Mm
Thank you.
But thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr.
Chair, I believe, uh, Senator
Gallegos had a question.
Trying to multitask.
Upcoming though.
The uh Senator Gallegos.
Mr. Chair, thank you for that,
Senator. Thank you for
remembering me and caring.
I want to start
With just a little bit I see a
lot in this bill.
I'm glad the governor put out
her prime package in one pill,
uh, I see that there's a lot of
moving parts, uh, but I wanted
to ask you on, I noticed that I
remember the spill from last
year in.
2024, it died as the bill before
it was sent over to the
judiciary to get fixed.
I'd rather fix when we have it,
uh, can you tell me in a.
nutshell, what the changes from
24 to now are.
Um, gosh, I'm not positive I
remember.
all of them, but I did notice
that um in the in the just as an
example, the FIR says you need
to put a definition of sensitive
information.
You know, sensitive, and we did
that. So that was a change that
wasn't, wasn't there before.
Um, there was a recommendation.
Which we ultimately rejected
because
of uh
Because of what was said about
4H animals that animals be
changed to pets.
But we were very aware that
beyond pets, um, received abuse
as well.
And so that was a request that
was made during this committee,
you may remember that we
ultimately ended up rejecting.
Um
There were a couple of a couple
of of language changes and a lot
of corrections, we did not, um,
consider, oh yeah, the, the
credible threat.
Um, we made it, uh, clear that
it does not necessarily mean the
use of a firearm.
Um, because some judges say.
If he threatened her with a gun.
Then that's a credible threat,
but if he did not threaten her
with a gun.
That's not a credible threat and
so.
That was a correction that was
made.
Um
To be honest, it was more than
a, it was a year ago, so I don't
remember. Oh you
um, oh, updates reporting of
record record keeping standards
for missing person cases.
Um
That that was also something
that was raised that we, we
fixed.
Um, so we, and we've also
consulted with some members of
judiciary.
Um
To to see, I was really
intrigued by uh Madam Chair's.
Uh, task force on uh child
safety.
Because what they're doing is
they're doing piece by piece.
Instead of trying to update the
whole thing, they have various
pieces, uh, that they're, um,
introducing legislation for and
that that uh might have been the
best way to do it, but the truth
is the task force worked on the
entire
Family violence Protection Act.
And they spent hours and hours
working on it.
Um, and again, it was a very
diverse group of people,
including law enforcement,
including social workers,
including
Case managers.
Um, including advocates,
including victims as judges,
judges were um.
You would probably I should
defer to my expert.
I did meet with the task force a
couple of times. I
Once I was sick.
And, and, uh, on, on Zoom, um, I
think they were laughing at me
because I was falling asleep.
Um, but it was, it was a very
extended process with lots of
discussion.
Uh, by what I would consider
experts in the field, and we
have taken into account.
The suggestions that have been
made.
Over here, the first year it
wasn't the 1st and 2nd year.
It stopped in judiciary because
they're waiting for the Supreme
Court.
Issue that ruling.
I
Yeah, so what was it, the,
yeah, Rahimi case.
Because why do anything if the
Supreme Court is gonna overrule.
And
Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr Chair
Senator, I, I appreciate that
and, and I'm just going back to
your testimony, uh, when you're
going through the whole bill,
did I not hear you say that, um.
Removal of guns or the lack of
firearms was already in the law.
That's correct, Madam Chair.
Then I'd like to take you men
Meeren page 45.
Line 2 to lines 8.
And I'm wondering if it's
already in the law while you
have it as new language.
That was just clarification of
existing law.
So if um.
Where is it?
I, I don't know if you recall,
yeah, inappropriate, the order
of, of protection. I don't, I
know very well cuz it was my
first year here, and I
co-sponsored the bill, uh,
senator, uh, saidvantes was the
lead attorney.
Um, amending this act.
And adding removal of firearms.
Um
Upon a credible threat.
Not just if there's domestic
violence and a firearm in the
home.
But
If there was a credible threat.
Unfortunately, the bill did not.
Uh, define credible threat.
So what we're doing is defining
credible threat.
And then, um, I'm lining it, uh,
aligning it with the federal,
the protections in the VOA Act
and in the
Um, what do you call it, the
federal.
Um
They call them prohibitors in
federal law, people who are not
supposed to have firearms and we
just made the alignment.
But the original authority to
take firearms away.
If there was a credible threat.
Um, was, was in 2019.
I appreciate it
I'm chairing Senator, I guess,
uh, in, in the testimony I
thought like.
Has already done deal you didn't
have to re-clarify, didn't have
to, uh, I'll change, uh, courses
now and chair and senator, uh,
if you'll go to page 30.
Uh, line 7.
Item H
It, it's talking about
restricting or prohibiting
movement.
And then it brings interference
with communication.
Would that include a cell phone?
Let me give you some history.
Uh, I had a daughter, uh, early
on in phones.
That had misbehaved Senator
without her phone.
With that now with this enacted
now make me a criminal.
And why not? Because if you're
talking about uh.
Interference with communication.
A cell phone right now.
As far as my kids look at it is
a legal right.
And Cha Singer.
Madam chair, um, very
interesting question. I'm gonna
defer to my expert about this
and maybe tell you a little
story about uh phones, madam
chair, Senator Gaos, um.
Uh, being the mother of a 14
year old and a 30-year-old, I
absolutely agree. My son gets
very upset when he thinks that I
interfere with his
communications, uh, which are
being interfered with right now
as he does his homework, um,
sir, Madam Chair, Senator
Gallegos, the under the family
Violence Protection Act and the
the revisions that we're looking
at. In addition to the violence
against Women Act that was
written, um, which we've also
now, it's it's named improperly,
it should have been the intimate
partner Violence Act, right, to
to look at.
Who, who is abused.
Regardless of that, um.
It was very specific in
legislative intent that this act
itself does not interfere with a
parent's authority to um
Discipline their child. So it's
very, that's why it's very, very
specific, you cannot be charged
with battery or assault on a
household member or any
household member cries against
your children because you need,
I mean, that's why it's child
abuse, but it's very, it was
very clear and legislative
intent. And so in that and in
the definitions and who who can
get orders of protection and all
of those pieces, um, taking your
child's phone away would be
considered parenting.
As opposed to interference with
communication, but this is
looking at is when a person who
is causing harm when an abuser
and uh a person who is in a
power and control relationship,
um, turns off the phone, takes
the phone away, um, hides the
phone from the individual in the
act of actually interference of
communications in the act of
calling 911 or seeking help.
Taking that phone away from you.
Um, that would be what
interference of communications
would be, so it's very clear
that um disciplinary, you know,
disciplining your children, um,
in the, you know, going back to
1994 when Vaa first came to be
and when we first did this, it
was very clear that this should
not interfere with our ability
to be a parent.
Well thank for them, and I'm
chairing center.
And lady, I, I guess, uh, being
in the legislature since 2013,
I've learned how to, how
attorneys read.
The law
And then it scares me because I
think that there's some gray
area here. I see throughout this
document places that you might
call me out on just being a
parent, but I'd like to refer
you then to page 37.
Of your bill
And anywhere from line 6.
Line 19, but I'd like to start
on that line 19.
And the part that scares me
there is may occur if abuse has
occurred or may occur.
So the abuse hasn't happened.
But going back to the same
doctor.
Uh, she works for CYFD now, uh,
we had a lot of fun when she's
growing up, so she was in her
room a lot.
And uh.
I look at it uh for one
instance, uh, she replaced our
sewer line.
From the house to the alley all
summer long.
I think that's a lesson.
You could look at this abuse.
I think she learned a lesson.
But my thing is, if nothing had
happened to her physically weary
this, if it may occur that I've
stepped it up to a different
level instead of just giving her
a.
A shovel, uh.
whooped along the way, uh, I was
raised in an abusive family.
So I understand the need for uh
barriers.
But I think now some of this is
is the way it's looking at is
with putting may occur, it's not
even happened.
And my dad, my friend beat the
shit out of me, that happened.
But that was back then and that
was normal life.
So to me this may occur really
bothers me because it's taken
away my parenting skill or the
threat to my child because it's
not a curved, but I also wanted
to ask humanitarian center and
and a lady on this section.
It sung about law enforcement.
They may petition emergency
order.
Our law enforcement officers
asking for this kind of
Um
Authority
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, um,
yes, they were part of the task
force and this just gives them
more tools to protect the
victims, so the answer is yes.
And you also have to trust the
judges.
And they're um
The
experience and discretion.
So, um, may occur.
The way the judges interpret it
is based on the totality of the
circumstances.
If this young woman has been
beaten, and I.
can think of so many examples.
Over and over again, and she.
Um, I think the domestic abuse,
um,
And she runs away, so she's not.
Uh, well, I'll just tell you the
story of, of one young woman.
She ran away from home and um.
She had suffered incredible
abuse on the, on the part of her
father.
And um
The, uh, the thing was, um.
She had been run away so long.
That we had to focus on the
risks of going back to the
house.
Because that was important to
the judge.
And the judge looked at the
entire, all of the circumstances
and said, based on the history
of this family, I believe that
abuse may occur.
Um, and that's what we have to
trust judges, they, they look at
the entire circumstance. Um, if
the young woman had never been
beaten and had run away.
Um
I that might not rise to the
level.
Depending, I mean, maybe if
there were threats, maybe if
there are threats to pets, you
know, looking at the whole
circumstance.
Um, the judge may conclude.
Well, this, this looks more
likely than not, or.
Uh, this child is in danger.
So again, you have to trust the
judges.
I think, and that's what with
this, you know, they're the ones
who really run this program.
Um, they're the ones that
Ensure the safety and
That's where we, we put them we
don't have a separate commission
on domestic violence.
We have judges.
Thank you Madam Chair and
Senator and and lady, I I guess
um.
I guess I'll finish with this
question. If I could have you go
to page 43.
Line 8
And in in that area talking
about providing child custody
with visitation order issued
with the order of protection may
only be in effect for a period
of.
6 months, so if.
If I'd created a problem, my
child was taken for 6 months.
Do they go to CYFD?
live in their offices.
And hopefully not get raped.
Oh gosh,
um,
uh, Madam Chair, I'm gonna defer
that to my expert, um.
Miss Ms Garcia and also uh I may
add something.
Madam Chair, uh, Senator Geos,
so just a couple of things, this
means that the the judiciary
only has authority to change
child custody and visitation for
up to 6 months, so it can
determine that the petitioning
party, uh, gets primary custody
and that the respondents may get
visitation, may not get
visitation, may have to have,
um, visitation, um, in, uh,
supervised visitation. It does
not, this does not include
criminal charges that that's not
a criminal charge piece, it's
just.
I've gone in as a petitioner of
intimate partner violence to
file against um my husband and
we have children together. I
have proven to the the judiciary
that I that more likely than
not, the abuse that I allege has
happened, the judge agrees, um,
because of the evidence that I
presented, and I've requested
that because of the abuse, the
children are experiencing as
well that while we go through
the domestic matters case, I
would like to have primary
custodianship. So that is what
the
And this gives the authority for
this to supersede any additional
what if we already were
divorced, right? And let's say
the, you know, or in separation,
this would supersede that
domestic matters case until the
domestic matters case is
concluded, so that would answer
that and then to follow up on
your last question, uh, Senator
Gayos, if I may, um, with regard
to, so.
A a child cannot get an order
protection at a minor child
cannot get an order of
protection against their parent.
Because that would be considered
child abuse and to further
hopefully um.
Satisfy your curiosity, um, and
concerns, right, like as a
parent, I, um.
I don't see, you know, making
your child dig a ditch as as as
as punishment, right, or as as.
Abusive, right? Um, you know,
my, my children have done that
as just part of the the home
that we hold, um, but what we do
know is that our law
enforcement, our judiciary and
our victim services conduct
legality assessments, which are,
um, conducted through Doctor
Campbell and Doctor Zoe Hilton,
who are national international
experts on looking at what a
pattern of abuse is, and so
that's really what we're looking
at is.
Is there a pattern of abuse and
is there, um, you know, maybe,
maybe not in that instance when
that individual called 911,
abuse happened that day that
constitutes a prime or something
that an officer can act upon,
but the fact that abuse has
happened in the past and that
lethality assessment
demonstrates that abuse may
happen again.
That allows the judiciary to
then enter into an order
protection and protect that
individual and their children.
It does not create a criminal
charge that then, um, you know,
constitutes, um, child abuse or
neglect. It really creates that
protective factor based upon the
tools that we as a state have
required our judiciary, our law
enforcement, and actually one of
the things we're working on is
to have Doctor Campbell and
Doctor Hilton create a New
Mexico specific.
Um, lethality assessment that is
then gonna further law
enforcement's ability to be able
to predict the prevalence and
incidents of lethal domestic
violence in our, in our homes
that addresses our indigenous
populations and the rural and
frontier nature of New Mexico.
Thanks for that, Madam Chair.
Senator and gentle lady, uh
short answers child would go to
the mom.
For the other parent, uh, and I
appreciate that and I, I uh just
wanted to get down to the
dialogue, I think.
And Senator, I would have rather
seen this in smaller bites, I
think, uh.
Historically you've done too
much.
And it ends up in judiciary.
And it dies, you might try next
year.
A smaller increments with that I
yield.
Thank you, uh, thank you for
that advice, Madam Chair, and I
noticed that Madam Chair did
that with the, with her task
force.
That she created, um.
It definitely is a thought.
It's just that they worked on
the whole thing, um.
And they were experts in the
whole thing, but I certainly
understand.
And I
And I didn't want to have 15
bills.
Madam Chair.
Is that all senator?
Mhm
OK.
Senator Hickey.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
I think this is an important
bill that is uh
Almost as complex as the one
before it, um, in some ways, and
uh well, I certainly don't have
the lived experience of this,
um,
I do my wife was the medical
director for SA for
A number of years and and was on
the board and uh the stories.
That I would
Here
We just unbelievable and um.
So we definitely need to keep
chipping away at it, but I think
one of the
Tips that I don't see in here
and, and maybe, maybe it is
there.
is
The
While the the individual, the
offending individual can be
recommended, as I understand it,
to uh a program in therapy.
Does that program in therapy
involve any
Uh, partner counseling.
Uh, how to, uh,
work, how, how to be able to
usually, I mean, it's poverty,
finance and and and finances
that that lead to a lot of abuse
and some people are just
unfortunately that way, that's
Culture of how they were brought
up.
But, uh, one of the areas that
we don't recognize in the state
is
Um
Reimbursing
Uh
Parts, couples, family therapy.
The you can't get a commercial
on and probably not an MCO.
Reimbursement
Unless one of the individuals is
diagnosed with a
Uh, a DSM-5 mental illness.
And then, then, then they'll pay
for it, and, and actually in the
mental health parity bill that I
passed last year, it does
require that the
Yeah
Counseling does get paid for
because the MCO is a part of the
exchange, they have to do it as
well.
And I think that there is great
value, but we don't, as a
society, we don't reward that.
Um, we don't emphasize it just
like we have not emphasized
mental health, behavioral
health, missed the boat in that
so many ways. So are there
provisions within this where
Uh, or a couple, if there is is
some reason for hope.
to enter into
Not just the program, but also
uh
Partner uh relationship uh
counseling and therapy.
Um,
It's
that because, um.
I remember doing one of the uh
newsletters and inlaitario about
just that.
The, the, uh, our client was.
An, an immigrant.
And her husband was a physician.
And they ended up getting back
together because he participated
in a batter's intervention
program, and she participated in
counseling, uh, at in la
secuitario.
And they got back together.
Um, so it's, it's possible, of
course, most um.
Reputable programs do not push.
The client anyway, it's up to
the client and with regard to,
um, I would love it and if
you're your bill uh covers it,
but on page 44 we have the.
Uh, the judge can order the
restrained party to reimburse
the protected party.
Or any other household member
for expenses reasonably related
to the occurrence of abuse.
Including medical expenses,
counseling expenses, the expense
of seeking temporary shel
shelter expenses for the
replacement or repair of damaged
property or the expense of lost
wages.
Um
That, that's a real important
thing if they're not gonna be
able to get.
Counseling paid for by insurance
either they're uninsured or
Uh, God forbid the, the policy
doesn't provide for it,
although.
My experience, they've been
pretty good. Maybe it was
because of your bill.
Uh
Madam Chair, thank you for that
answer. Actually, uh, because
it, it is complex in terms of
how the bill is written based on
federal legislation. It is the
law.
That it has to be reimbursed,
and I'm thinking of they're
called Z codes.
Um, and, uh, coding parlance.
Uh, and I thought maybe I need
to clarify that a little bit
further, because again,
implementing it in the
superintendent has done a great
job of hiring people, but
because it is so complex, it's
gonna take a year or two to put
it into effect, but it is the
law.
That
There has to be reimbursement.
From a commercial or an MCO.
Excellent.
Thank you Madam Chair, that's a
a very important point for all
of us to know about.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
I think you, Madam Chair, very
briefly.
Senator, I'm on page 32 line 1.
And I heard.
And red in my literature that
the
Definition of credible threat.
Has been an issue in, in past
iterations.
Of this legislation.
And I see that.
The evidence may be demonstrated
maybe demonstrated by evidence.
Of a statement.
Is there any?
Corroboration is there any
physical
Is there any witness? Is there?
Anything else.
That is needed to support.
The state
Madam Chair, absolutely, if you
look at that provision, it says.
A condition or situation that
causes a reasonable person based
on the totality of the
circumstances, so that's
everything to fear for the
person's physical safety or for
the physical safety of another
and may be demonstrated by
evidence of a statement, an
actor course of conduct
attributed to the respondent and
does not require the use of
threatened use of the firearm.
Um, that was specifically done
because so many judges said.
He threatened her, he beat her,
but he never used a firearm, so
I'm not gonna take away the gun.
And what we know is that there
is a 5 time.
5 times more likely that there
will be a murder in a home where
there is a presence of domestic
violence and firearms.
And so this requires the judge,
and again this is where they
have the judge has to review all
of the evidence, the totality of
the circumstance.
It depends if this individual is
a really
Scary individual and has other
history of violence, and then
just says once to her, I'm gonna
shoot you.
That might be, you know,
depending on the, the whole case
that is presented, that might be
enough.
Um, but it could be a, a casual,
and I don't know, this is
casual, but I'm gonna kill you
kind of thing.
And, and no evidence of abuse?
Um, that might not be enough, it
just depends on the
circumstances.
Um, and, and that's again where
you have to for the judges and
we have delegated it to the
judges for them to look at at
the entire circumstance.
So this wouldn't normally be.
A situation that somebody just
owns guns and also as an abusive
relationship. The credible that
requires a connection or a nexus
between those two things before
uh a a gun will be temporarily
taken and it's not even taken,
they have to turn it in.
Under under this
Um, the police don't come and
pick it up or whatever they have
to certify that they either own
no firearms or turn in their
firearms voluntarily,
temporarily.
Madam Chair and enter the person
seeking the order.
As their burden is.
Making a statement.
Is that
Thank
Um
Most judges require more than.
Well, it depends on the
statement, um, you know, you
just really have to.
Um, how do I put this?
I, we've had several clients
that didn't meet the burden of
proof.
Because the judge.
Didn't think it was credible or
didn't think the statement was
all that threatening, and there
was no history of abuse.
So
The, the, the request for a
temporary restraining order.
was denied.
Um, and that, that happens, um,
and then we have people who have
a history of violence.
And they, you know, in whatever
maybe they.
The drug traffickers, who knows
what their history is, and then
they go to court.
And
I believe it's easier for them
to take threats.
To look at threats and have the
judge take them more seriously
because of the history of
violence.
Um, and so, again, this is one
of those discretionary areas for
the judge.
Based on the totality of the
circumstances, and in, in law,
That requires a a lot of
evidence, um.
When you're talking about
totality of the circumstances,
you usually just can't go in
with one little thing.
You have to paint the picture.
For the judge to determine
whether it's appropriate in
these circumstances.
OK
OK. Uh, well, Mr. Chair and
Senator, let me give, I had a
for example here.
OK.
A private investigator tailing.
A party
Looking for proof of infidelity.
Would that be considered?
A credible threat.
Is that in that circumstance.
No, they wouldn't come under
this this um.
This act and then.
Like I don't even think they
they'd qualify for relief under
this act, um, and, uh, for that
person in the first place and
then uh I, you'd have a hard
time showing a threat.
Unless, and again, that would be
under a different code if
they're not a family member.
Um, you know, cause this is
about family members and
intimate partners and whatever.
So they um.
Probably not.
However, if they showed up in
the hotel.
And started threatening people
and whatever, that would be a
different.
That would be under the criminal
code, not this.
And Madam Chair, since I'm
struck the asymmetry here.
Between
One side of this conflict in the
other.
Uh, and I'll use.
The
On one hand,
Uh, party may be.
Uh, ordered to go to counseling
on the other hand,
The party cannot be ordered.
to go to counseling. Is there no
circumstance or level of
provocation that would
Rise to the point.
We both of those folks.
Might need some intervention.
Thank you for the question, um,
um.
This there's so many situations
where people who are not the
primary aggressors.
Ended up having difficulties.
Um
By having
Guns removed all of the
consequences of this.
That um the best practices are
that the.
That the officer, the arresting
officer.
Looks again at all of the
circumstances, and you can see
it in the police reports, um,
you can almost, it's funny,
they'll say, OK, uh.
This gentleman.
That's 64 300 pounds claims his.
You know, 90 pound wife, uh,
beat him up.
And however, upon evaluation and
looking at the bruises and
looking at the history, uh, I
think that he was a primary
aggressor and she was
Defensive, but they, they
usually list why they think
that.
Um, could be the size, it could
be the history, could be the
aggressiveness of the
individual, um, and this goes
both ways, um, we had a client
once that um.
It was a male and uh he refused
to, we refuses to get a
restraining order.
Because, um.
His wife beat him up and she
even beat him up with a with a.
With a pan.
And the reason she did that is
she was raised in a domestic
violence home, and she felt that
he didn't love her because he
didn't beat her.
It was really a very difficult
circumstance, um.
And he, he really didn't want to
go to court or get any kind of
restraining order because he was
raised that you don't beat up on
women.
Um, and so
Um, he, we, of course, did we,
our policy was to follow the
lead of the victim.
But he would have been in the
place of he would have been in a
victim.
Position
And so he would be entitled to
choose to get counseling.
Um, it's clear she needed
counseling.
Um
And so
Um, that case, it would ended up
happening was, um.
They did separate.
Um
And, but it didn't end up being
a long drawn out case.
Thank you, Senator for your
answers and.
What's that, Madam Chair, I
yield.
Thank you very much. Are there
any other questions?
Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and um
well aware of the, the time here
and I'd be more than willing to
put my questions off until
Friday cause I know Madam Chair,
that you, you have a schedule to
keep to, so I'll, I'll be more
than happy to leave that, leave
that up to you.
Um
Senator block, if you'd like to
ask your question or two, I
think we could entertain that.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Maybe
more, there's been a lot of
discussion on this, and, and
again, I, I'm, I'm more
concerned about your schedule.
On this because of everything
you're going through, and I'd be
more than happy to wait until.
Uh, Friday for that.
Well, um, I'd prefer not to roll
this one over cause we still,
we've already rolled over two
other bills from Senator Woods,
Ramos.
Um, and Senator, but I like you
better than Senator Woods and
Ramos.
I don't think they heard that,
senator.
OK, um, I'll, I'll proceed then.
um.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator Sidil Lopez.
Um
I want to talk about the animal
issue here for, for a moment.
So
This, this bill allows the court
to order a party, uh, to stay
away from an animal belonging to
a protected party.
Um
There and there are some other
portions here like the firearms
piece that's already covered
under current law.
Where, where does the animal go
and who's responsible for the
cost of that particular animal.
And then if the animal is not
picked up and it goes to a
shelter or whatever else, um.
Is, is the animal gonna be
surrendered and then.
Maybe put down.
Thank you for that question.
That's why this was so
important.
And that's why some of the
programs at the shelters have to
allow pets and other and other
animals to go is so important
because so many victims.
Um
Survivors of domestic violence
wouldn't leave the situation,
wouldn't go to a shelter.
In order to protect their
animals.
Um
And so they had to turn them
over, and that was devastating
to them.
Uh
If, if they chose to leave, but
so many of them would just put
up with the abuse because they
wanted to protect the animals.
Um, what this does is it gives,
it potentially gives the victim
custody of the animal.
And allows the victim, you know,
they, there can be a temporary
order of uh.
The port
Um, and
One of the things in the
temporary support that you
present evidence of is what the
leads, what the expenses and
needs of the family, so that
could be listed as an expense.
Um, and the judge tries to
figure out, um, figure that out.
Thank you for that. Thank you,
but I'm sure because I, I worry
about that um.
Very familiar with animal
shelters. They're overcrowded
already.
So I, I, I kind of worry about
that, um.
Especially in Albuquerque and in
Rio Rancho in Sandoval County,
uh, we have, you know, major
issues. I'm, I'm sorry, go
ahead, Madam Chair, Senator,
they actually wouldn't go to a
shelter. We actually have the,
we have a a a network of
providers who are uh funded to
provide um.
Shelter, um
For the animals for the animals'
adoption, there's the word is
evading me. I apologize, Senator
Foster, thank you. Thank you,
Foster, you said shelter. I'm
like, no, no, no, that's not the
right word. They foster the
animals, so there's an entire
network that fosters the
animals. In addition, many of
our domestic violence shelters
have the ability for, um,
certain pets, but we're talking
large animals such as horses,
cattle, etc. those could
potentially be um fostered um by
the the network that is held in
addition, the provisions in the
order of protection would allow.
The protected party to stay
within the residences and remove
the restrained party so that
that individual can stay there
with the pets and the animals,
particularly in those situations
that I've seen orders with, um,
where it's been issued that the
protected party and the children
stay or the protected party
stays with the animals, um, and
so those provisions are in
there. Sorry, sir. I'll, I'll
be, tell me to be quiet. Thank
you. Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
I'd like to just talk about on
page 55, the special
commissioners.
And it says.
So we're talking about their
appointed, correct?
Yes, madam Chair.
OK. And so a domestic violence
special commissioner shall be an
attorney licensed to practice
law in New Mexico. Is, is that
gonna be a contract through um
through the core system to
contract a private attorney.
Or is that going to be a public
Public attorney, Madam Chair,
most of these, I'm not a, I
guess there are a few that might
have a um.
Especially the smaller
jurisdictions might have a
contract with an attorney to do
it part time, but the
commissioners in the larger
cities are all employees of the
AOC.
OK
Thank you for that. Uh, thank
you, Madam Sharon.
Senator Sidil Lopez, I mean, we,
you and I have talked about the
AOC in regards to um SB.
3, I think this looks like it
could be an additional burden.
On the AOC, um.
Uh, with this, um, bill here.
And I think there's gonna be
some additional costs, and I, I
don't know if those were in the
fiscal impact report.
Um, Madam Chair or Mr. Chair,
I'm sorry, Mr. Chair, um.
I hadn't
realized that Madam Chair was
gone, um.
This is existing law, and this
is what they do already.
Thank you for that. Thank you,
Mr. Chair, if it's existing law,
do we need it in here?
Um, well, they, they have to go
to like, remember there's some
changes on that page.
Um, and that's why this bill
looks so overwhelming because
there's so many changes, but
that the domestic violence
commissioners are, it's already
existing law.
And so they already have the
budget for them.
Um, most ju, the larger
jurisdictions, their employees
of the AOC.
Of the courts of the courts.
And um.
There are some, I was aware that
um Valenta County for a while
had a part time.
Contraced.
Um
I mean finding 3 attorneys, uh,
Mr. Chair, finding 3 attorneys
is very difficult. I mean, even
in Sandoval County, for
instance, we have
Um, our county attorney, Michael
Echelman, and we have two,
deputy attorneys, so it adds up.
Quite a lot of work uh to this.
I think there's gonna be a
burden.
On the counties, uh, quite
frankly, with this bill, and I
don't know if we've really
thought that out or not because
You know that our, our county
attorneys are inundated with
numerous IPA requests as, as you
know, that's another issue we've
had to hire more and more people
to deal with that, so I'm a
little, little concerned about
the.
Um
Burden
On the AOC and on the counties
in relation to some legislation
coming down. Uh, Madam Chair,
that might, that I totally
recognize the legislation that
you're referring to, but this, I
encourage you to talk to the, I
believe the 13th judicial
district.
Um, quartz and see exactly what
they do for this. There aren't
as many cases in the 13 judicial
district, as there are in uh the
2nd judicial district.
So they may have um.
You know, it really depends on
the on the case load, but my
guess is they only have one.
Thank you for that. Thank you,
Mr. Chair and Madam Chair. Well,
the issue with the 13th judicial
district right now is they're
actually overloaded on cases and
we're trying, that's why we're
building a huge judicial complex
there and we had a new judge.
Um, added a new judge because of
the amount of caseload growing
up in that district.
Absolutely madam chair and this
is to take the burden off the
judges. The special
commissioners because they're
very evidence heavy cases.
As you could tell, um, and so
the commissioners.
Take the burden off those judges
and lastly, um, I, I got a lot
more questions, but out of
respect for, for the chair and
for her um, her time. The
firearms piece here.
You know, we talked about the
commission is already being
codified in law, and it's in
here and I've had some struggles
where I've tried to add
something to other bills, and
they said, well, it's already in
law so you don't have to worry
about that.
Um
The firearms are mentioned in
here.
Um, a few times in the bill, um.
And one of the things you hear
on page 45 line 2.
Um, when appropriate, the order
of protection shall also contain
notice that all restrained
parties are prohibited from
owning or possessing a firearm.
While the order of protection is
in effect.
Firearms protection, I'm sorry,
firearms prohibition shall apply
to stipulated orders.
And to contested orders when the
respondent has been served with
notice of a hearing. This had
the
Opportunity to participate.
One of the things that this bill
does.
Um,
That I, I see kind of missing
here is, is the word alleged.
You, you have the word alleged
sprinkled through here for for
victims, not everywhere.
Um, and you have it alleged most
of the places, I think 7 out of
8 for perpetrators.
I'm worried about.
This particular piece of
Of law you're trying to write in
here.
Because it doesn't really show a
due process or how the
individual gets those weapons
back.
This reminds me of a Maryland
law where we had numerous
False accusations in Maryland
after a red flag, red flag law
was passed.
Where the
I'll say the um.
Alleged
The perpetrator alleged
aggressor.
I had to uh cost a lot of money
to get his or her.
Weapons back
And I think what you're hearing
here, what you're saying here is
You would have to turn
You would have to turn in your
weapons.
If there's a an allegation
against you of
Not domestic violence, but abuse
now, correct?
Um
Madam Chair, there has to be a
hearing and a judicial finding
that there is a credible threat.
That the ownership of the weapon
and the history and pattern of
abuse.
Creates a credible threat of
future abuse.
So, um
And, and this is actually
required by uh the federal
firearms, so the the way the
federal laws works.
Is it um
During the time period that you
have an order in effect, you're
not supposed to own or possess a
gun.
And so this just really enforces
that federal law because without
this provision.
Um
The court wasn't aware whether
there were there were firearms
in the home, wasn't aware of
whether there's credible threat.
Uh, and again that happened in
20 2019.
Um, and the way to get the
firearms back, my understanding
is the order of protection
expires.
And then they just go to.
Wherever they turned in the
firearm and say the order of
protection has expired. I need
my firearms back.
No charges, no, it, it's
supposed to be easy.
Thank you, just 2 more quick
questions, uh, Madam Chair, um.
What is when when they
I don't know if the right term
is aggressor or perpetrator, but
The alleged bad guy. Yeah.
What, what happened,
what's the timeline where he or
she has to turn in, uh, the
weapons that they possess.
I don't know what's to stop that
person from
Taken my weapons, I'm the bad
guy, and I give him the Senator
Boone.
Hey hey, hold these, I don't
have any weapons, and then, but
you know, cause you and I have a
relationship that yeah, Jay's
got weapons called the police
that come to my house.
There's nothing there.
That's, that's the part I'm
trying to get around or
understand here.
It, well, if you can supplement
with so.
The hearings that I've been to.
Is they, uh, there's an
allegation that.
Uh
This person has firearms,
there's an allegation that this
person has threatened.
Use those firearms or not even
use those firearms, but given
the pattern of abuse, the person
is in has ears and has a
credible threat that they will
be used.
Only then does the court ask the
individual to identify whether
he has weapons or she has
weapons or not.
Then they certified to the
court, they can file a uh and
these are all pleadings in the
in the court.
That they don't own firearms.
where they could file something
that says I have 3 firearms, but
I gave them to my
brother-in-law.
Or I have, you know, whatever,
and so then the court has to
decide what to do about that.
Normally, the court will say.
Because of this pattern of
abuse.
And because I fear there's
credible threat.
You need to turn your firearm
and then it's in the court's
order. You need to turn it to
APD by such and such date.
And then only if he, if they
to turn in the firearm.
Will the judge do anything about
it?
Most people
Turn in the firearms.
Get in trouble, you know, you,
uh, and then lastly, Madam
Cheryl, I'll just say that's the
problem here is that
The good people
We are going to comply with
laws.
The bad people are not, and that
puts the good people at risk,
uh, here.
I, I would, I would love to see.
This part, section.
Uh, I think it's, is it 1413?
It's 4, I think it's 14 on page
41, and it goes down.
I, I, I think from what I
understand, you, but you did add
some stuff in here.
Child custody and stuff, but I
think you'd have a lot more
support.
On this side of the aisle.
If, if you took out those issues
with the firearms because we
already have that law that was
already passed here in 2019.
Um, but I like the animal part
uh of the bill.
Mm
So I, I just want to say thank
you that I have a hard time with
uh the 2nd Amendment piece here
because it's already in law. I
don't think it needs to be here.
But, um, you've done a lot of
great work here, a lot of good
work, and I, I think my
colleagues may agree with me if
that part was taken out, this
would be more palatable because
you already, we already do this
in New Mexico.
Madam Chair, with that, I
Well, yield the rest of my
questions and turn over to you.
Madam Chairman
Blonde and I hope the orders of
protection on page 44.
Um, and number 3.
That's all they used to say.
Um
The notice may be notice the
violation of the order of
protection is a violation of
state law and that federal law,
and this is the gun federal gun
control law.
Prohibits possession of firearms
by certain persons.
That was all these people got in
small print.
On the order of protection.
And so what this did was make it
more clear to the individual,
what federal law actually is, so
that they wouldn't inadvertently
violate it.
Um, because that, that's really
meaningless.
To just have a citation to
federal law.
Uh, and then says certain
persons, you don't even know if
you're a person.
It applies, so all this did was
clarify.
What federal law requires.
It, it's, it didn't intend to
expand the removal of firearms
in any way, shape or form, just
to clarify notice to the
individual.
Um, because I thought that was
weird.
Honestly, just this, this little
thing was in small print on the
bottom of the order.
It would be very easy to
overlook it and then get in
trouble with federal law.
Because you didn't know.
And so that's what this is
intended to do. It's not
intended to expand.
Or contract or do anything to
the 2nd Amendment. Thank you for
that. Thank you, Madam Chair. I,
I will say if that was the only
piece of that.
And and the other stuff was
gone, I, I'd be, I'd be in
support.
If that's something you're
willing to look at, um,
In a different committee or on
the Senate floor if this goes to
the floor.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you
Senator Sidil Lopez.
That I'm sure I'd be willing to
talk about it, I'm not sure
exactly what the what the point
is, but I, I, with the
correction would be, but I'm, I
definitely don't want to make
sausage here with Madam Chair's
time. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Senator
Pinto.
I motion for a due pass.
There's a motion for to pass.
Um, Senate Bill 26 with a second
from Senator Nava.
If you could call the roll,
please.
Oh, Senator Charlie, I'm sorry.
My senator wearing pink.
I was gonna go with the with
the, it's the senator wearing
pink. So you pass from Senator
Pinto.
With a second from Senator
Charlie.
I stand corrected. If you could
please call the roll.
Senator Block. No.
Senator Boone.
Senator Charlie, yes, and I'd
like to explain.
Gallegos.
In her nova.
Yes, explained my vote.
Pinto.
Scott. No.
Then said Lopez, yes.
And Hickey. Yes.
And I Lopez
Yes, before I announce, Senator
Charlie to explain her vote.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um, and
thank you Senator Senator Siio
Lopez and Mary Ellen.
Um, this is a big bill in volume
and intention and it has been a
labor of love. Uh, I served on
the task force that worked on
this with so many other
community organizations.
And what's reflected in this is
a depth of experience, um.
But also care, fierce, ferocious
care and attention to detail
that only a survivor.
Who was engaged in the system
will understand.
And so I see all of that in here
and I thank you so much for
bringing this bill forward. It
is my true honor to be on this
side.
And to be able to vote for it.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Gallegos to
explain your vote.
There was Miss Mala first.
I'll take the time.
Um
Madam Chair and Senator, I just,
I was yielding the ladies first,
but, uh, as I said earlier, I
think this is a large bite.
I would say this is leading the
whole apple at one time, I think
you'd get a lot better.
When, when you go to the
judiciary, if they could take
smaller looks at it, I think
you'd have this bill through.
I hope it doesn't delay again
this year.
But I think that's the direction
it'll be going, but thank you
for your time. Thank you for
looking into this.
Ontario.
Senator Novas, to explain your
vote.
Thank you, Chairwoman, um,
Senator, an advocate, uh, just
wanted to thank you for bringing
the bill forward, um.
I believe that this is a Senator
Charlie said, a labor of love,
um, and intentionality, uh, and
having a cousin who was almost
murdered by
Her partner
2 years ago, um, this is deeply
personal and and and
understanding the complexities
of the system that victims have
to undergo. Um, I just want to
thank you on behalf of all of
those individuals who are not
here with us today. Um, thank
you, Madam Chairwoman. Thank you
very much.
Thank you. On a vote of 6 to 4,
