I don't really buy clean up I
said I I think I said to try to
modernize the statute.
Over the summer we can look at
this act what i'd like to do
mister
all of the.
There's kind of a contradiction.
Boxing promoters don't have to
pay grt but they get nickel and
dim for so much because
essentially this agency is self
finance.
So what i'm hoping to do over
the course the next year's is
this budget in the house built
two thousand there's that way
with their tax and more whatever
and.
And
and everything's you know
everything is transparent and
and fair as opposed to
as opposed to maybe the the way
it's done now it's done totally
by rule now and so so I want to
move some of the good rules in
the statute.
That's a bit odd for for most
agencies they want things in the
regulations and not in this at
okay that's the only questions I
have.
Just to follow up on that
are these weight classes
consistent with
the
national and international
boxing association in the road
boxing association with their
classification chairman center
or teasing penal yes.
And if they change their so
you're going to have to come
back and change 'cause evidence
evolved over the determinance
that hurt his bill they have in.
The.
Over a hundred years old really.
That.
They haven't even gone to.
They haven't gone to kilos that
state pounds though the still
get these weight class of
existed even in the philippines.
All right.
Any other discussion.
Oh good senator mckenna and
senator said you look as well.
This this is.
Senator said the olympics you're
you're on.
Mister chair there were some
points that were made that seem
kind of important on page tear
online five to
five and six.
A thousand dollars to me seems
very low.
Considering wet.
The.
If you are modernizing seems
like that would be an important
point to.
It's more realistic page ten
line.
It seems like a dangerous.
Not that i've ever.
The.
Which.
The.
Mr chair be an appropriate to
notice that.
Well.
I move
mister chair that on page ten
minutes six.
At five and six would that be
changed to two thousand.
To two thousand five hundred
dollars.
Able to the boxer.
Could we do a minimum with would
it be okay mister chair to say
in the amount of a minimum of
two thousand five hundred.
The commission
my understanding is that the
commission sets up these rules
and though the commission I
guess I want to signal to the
commission they could go higher.
Is is my thought mrperiod chair.
It that so since the
commissioner since the
commission.
A the commission made by rural
require insurance coverage for
blood bla.
For while preparing in a
professional in an amount.
It's i'm not an expert on on
this it just seemed low to me.
The.
So I deferred to the experience
mister chair.
So thank you mister city low
please so.
The.
So the commission would require
the insurance policy.
But i'm not sure who would pay
it but each but each other
combating so to speak with would
have to have this policy i'm not
sure how it's administered now.
This is another opportunity to
see if we had medicare for all
this wouldn't be an issue but I
think it is an issue.
The.
And I mister chair I deferred
to.
People who are more expert in
what is an appropriate amount
and my thought is if we put a
minimum of two thousand five
hundred then we wouldn't h.
Later
it would be up to the commission
in establishing its rules and
they would know what makes sense
for the damages that can be
caused to a.
Oxer.
Or kick boxer martial art all
about.
So it would say it in the
minimum in an amount of the
minute of a minimum.
Of twenty five hundred dollars
or one thousand five hundred.
In a minimum amount.
A minimum amount.
Of twenty five.
I have two thousand five hundred
dollars that way the commission
could that would be the floor
and then the commission could
figure out what thank you mister
chairman thank you since you're
a little bit all we could also
say or more.
Okay of twenty five workers keep
in mind on page nine it's the
commission may by rule.
So will find out over the
interim how this is actually
done in nuts and bolts I think.
Affordable correct and things
like that I would imagine they
all have.
Thank you mister chair you'd be
surprised but.
The.
Yes yes.
Okay so mister chair I make a
formal amendment that we amend
line five of on page ten.
To after the word.
Of to insert.
Twenty thousand two thousand
five hundred dollars or more
payable to the box or kick boxer
martin etcetera a friend.
I don't think you need minimal
because redundant.
Mr chair and the other one is
kind of a bigger question
sure oh yes i'm sorry.
Senator pay everything
yeah it's all because the
athletic commission I don't know
what happens with that after
that but yeah so we have to
insure every single performer
and then the way it's written in
rule.
Before I was born.
That it's everyone who is the
ring so it's everyone insist in
the ring it's ring announcers
it's referees it's guys who ring
the bell it's the girl that
holds the ring sign it's the guy
that helped you park your car.
So.
It's very unnecessary
we could if we can be I know we
are I pay it all so and I have
to pay an out of state company
because it is not supported here
in the mexico by an organization
because there's been a poor
history of that.
Thank you mister chair is it for
how much based in new jersey
mister chair how much do you is
it a thousand dollars yeah
that's the current minimum
and then we personally insure up
to I think
twenty thousand dollars per guy
but i'm a progressive promoter
so none of my guys get hurt
cause it's not real but
yeah if a boxer takes a shot
then sure that they definitely
need that
but also they need.
Not a physician on hand there's
a ambulance right there that
takes them to the care and then
once that ambulance leaves we
have to shut down the event
cause we have to buy roll always
have an ambulance and.
We could rept this all thing
apart.
If you want.
Thank you mister chair i'm not
trying to rip it apart i'm just
trying to protect boxers.
Thank you mister chairman series
as I the gentleman was referring
to the.
To the statute and the rules the
statute is four pages the rule
book is happening because it's
been forty five years old rumo.
But it mister chair it looks
like what's being paid is only a
thousand dollars per boxer and
as you said if this is in
nineteen eighty dollars that
seems grossly inadequate so
mister chair and if you said
it's friendly i'd like to put a
min I mean a.
What I just said
or more.
Mister chair my question will be
with that increase.
Then
cause the promoters to not have
the events would that be an
amount that would be detrimental
to the hosting of the event.
If I might so I was on the
athletic.
Missioners albeit a fairly short
amount of time but that being
said one of the assets that you
have is it is a financial
situation they made my it is a a
minimal amount that is paid and
they have to carry insurance as
was referred to earlier so
that's that's covered as it is.
So so this won't affect the
ability of the promoters to sees
events if we increase the amount
from one thousand.
German senator okay thank you
I just noticed though that this
bill have you read this build
what's the promotion mister
slow.
The.
The this section of the bill
excludes rustlers from.
The commission the commission
made by rule it require
insurance coverage for each
licensed professional boxer and
then its slashes or professional
wrestler.
The.
This.
You still have to have you guys.
Mister chairman so I think we
crossed out the word resting and
we put in a sports entertainment
wrestler sports interest or I
see what you do.
The.
You only just make this real
simple and just do away with the
the sun said is it worth doing
though the rest of this right
now mister chairman says there
are or these benefit none of the
stuff in this bill is
controversial.
What what what the amendment was
made on this is current law but
the members that we made to this
section of law are not
controversial there we have
unity by the commission we have
unity by RLD
and we have unity by the two
sponsors so um so for you guys
want to.
Look at current line amend
current law that.
But to answer your questions and
no we would prefer to modernize
the statute a little bit and
then fully modernize it next
year
I got a good luck.
Okay so it senator never you
still had the floor okay anybody
else.
No I think we're voting on your
amendment.
You you made an omen amendment a
motion for an amendment we were
debating the amendment and now
we're going to vote on it
is there any opposition to the
amendment.
Seeing none will consider the
amendment adopted and will go to
you thank you mister this is
about the sunset which was the
purpose of the sunset mister
chair in the first place.
Thank you
mister chairman center city
lopez there's a sunset act in
statute
in which various boards and
commissions have a sunset in
order to review them so
legislative finance committee
reviews them makes a
recommendation whether we should
post upon the sunset so many of
these boards and commissions in
fact all of them have sent at by
law
thing thank you mister chair
because I noticed that the
recommendation by the lfc when
they reviewed it is to extend
the sense of date.
For two more years which seemed.
Mhm.
Like why would we remove it
completely if the recommendation
is to extend it for two years so
that it could be reviewed again
thank you thank you mister
chairman center ciloper so that
recommendation was made two
years ago.
For whatever reason the sense
that did not get extended last
year.
I'm gonna look at i'm gonna look
at this bill as well as reps and
of the cruise look at this
active serious law we got
commitments from the commission
and the.
And the director to do a bill
next year so
we're not going to wait until
the.
But we believe this commission
this commission is worthwhile
and.
Chair but sunsets light of fire
under people to actually get
that done and the other thing
that this recommended is it
recommended a penalty be
increased because they felt that
the the te of a thousand
dollars.
Wasn't sufficient and was the
much of a deterrent so.
I I guess i'm opposed to the
sunset
so I mean to removing the sunset
i'm not opposed to extending it
so that you can do which you
suggested which is updated the
bill work on work on that and
also um really look at the
penalties because I see those
local penalties so my second
amendment would be to extend the
sunset
two years.
This extensive till twenty
thirty
I thought it was the builders to
build nothing or the bill last
page of the bill okay section.
Okay so.
Thank you because the f r s that
it was removing the sense.
So my questions do need till
twenty thirty.
Is that is that mister chair
with.
The.
Instead of what the
recommendation was an elephant
in the thank you mister chairman
seriously look as the.
We usually extend him out five
six years.
This one were extending out six
years.
Um I understand that point about
lighting a fire but we weren't
extended one or two years I come
back next year w.
We're not the exact same
conversational what are you just
when you just bump this.
But I assure this committee that
will be cleaning up this entire
section of law over the summer
and next year to fully modernize
it.
A lot of the stuff is in
contract.
Literally the term boxing.
On today swallows up.
Theoretically those and amazing
legal it's not in statute would
like to put it.
So if you're going to do it in a
couple of years why do you need
to send it to be extended to
twenty third oh thank you um we
don't need the sunset mister
chairman see the best to be
extended till nineteen thirty
twenty thirty but we do need it
to be extended past this july.
Absolutely.
Mister german seriously opened
that's the way the bill was
dropped I didn't pick the year.
So this was usually we usually
extended five years renewed I
believe.
Because the reason it's six
years it's because we're doing
it in a thirty session.
Mall sense that's our in a sixty
day
let me go but I don't know ok
that that makes sense I I just
was curious in the fire said was
removed so that kind of cut my
attention
so thank you mister
any other discussion of the
bill.
Seeing none what's the will of
the committee.
So we have a motion for due pass
from saturday to niber seconded
from senator in the curtain any
other discussion of the bill as
a m.
The secretary will call the role
senator hiki.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
With the ninety zero vote you
have a due pass and will go now
to send it bill one forty five
senators so the alo.
The.
The.
Yeah but i'm just determined
that.
Yeah
they thank you mister chair
apologies have a little bit of a
heady.
Um but we do have or I have.
Twelve.
The.
After may fifteenth twenty
twenty four.
Um before the period.
For the earliest effective date
permissible under the
termination provision.
Four
no page two.
Before the period.
After me fifteenth twenty
twenty.
For four the earliest or four.
Did I say four.
The earliest effective date
permissible under the termi.
And there should be a comma
after twenty twenty four.
So it's.
May fifteenth comma twenty
twenty four.
Comma.
Four the earliest.
Effective date.
Permissible under the
termination provision period.
That's in three months.
Performance.
Um mister president the reason
for the change is because of
what you said me fifteenth
twenty twenty four.
The contract so different.
That.
The.
Allows for that pla.
So.
The the other thing is.
Senator neighborhood you're
you're we have several lawyers
in this committee including it.
If this doesn't have an
emergency provision.
It does not take effect until
june thirtieth twenty twenty
four or july first twenty twenty
four I guess is that right I
think it's so many days after
ninety to figure maybe earlier
in a thirty day session the
normal so I first mister chair
my understanding is it's made
fift.
The effect of the.
The.
So so mister chair so the let's
just see if if we got the
wording of the amendment.
No for she says four.
That's right.
Just cution of the amendment.
You so you really saying if
they're contact current contract
says this is good for them for
how long it is run out.
So whatever the contract that
would be the earliest
termination under that.
The.
Video discussion any
opposition to the amendment.
Senator neighbor to your
postless you want to discuss it
just take about you and explain
why you've.
Or.
According to.
My understanding mr chair and
i'd be happy to turn it over to
my expert who is really worked
very hard on this uhm
the reason it's important that
it be four is because if if it
were.
Or and then somebody wanted to
game the system and try to do
some kind of a amendment before
the statute is effective um.
They might end up negotiating
something for five hundred days
for a couple years or or
whatever and we don't want that
to happen we want to.
To make clear that what we mean
is as soon as a statute is
effective.
The termination.
The termination needs to be for
the earliest effective.
It gives them clear guidance
about what they're supposed to
do which is terminate a s AP and
not game play.
Every day a better word you find
a better word.
All right let's take a board on
the amendment and we have
somebody of close we can't do it
by unanimous secretary will call
the rule this is on the
amendment.
To insert that phrase on page
two line twelve.
The.
A passage I don't have the
amendment
where it's written it was just
language okay okay yes that's
yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
So by six to three vote the
amendment is adopted now was
going to the heart of the bill
what's this bill going to do
thank you thank you mister chair
this bill would prohibit new
mexico public entities from
entering into contracts to
detain people for civil
immigration violations and
require any new mexico public
entities with the existing
intergovernmental contracts.
To terminate the contract in
their called igs
word for them.
And I just want to say that it's
really important that banning
this contract is not a bound on
private prisons doesn't ban
private prisons nor require that
prisons be closed.
Up it only regulates the
behavior of public entities new
mexico public entities it does
not regulate the behavior of
private entities nor the fit
federal government.
These bands have been held has
federally constitutional they've
been passed in florida in
california washington illinois
maryland organ new jersey and
most recently this year in
colorado and all of them have
been upheld is lawful.
It does not violate the state
constitution for requiring
contract termination new mexico
case line temple temple best
baptist church the city of
albuquerque states and existing
contracts are subject to the
legitimate extra size of the
state's police power.
Um and each other new mexico's
contracts intergovernmental.
Contain contract termination
provisions.
Um in the the most important
thing
is that these ice immigration
centers have well documented
histories of inhumane living
conditions restricted access to
limit to legal council and
inadequate health care and even
death.
And to me it is just shocking
and up setting to think that.
The state can be involved in
this kind of.
Expert here.
Of.
Of these bands and her name is
sophia jennifer john genevis she
is the managing.
Well thank you good afternoon
mister chair and members of the
committee many of us of the
january seven managing attorney
for the asylum and detention
programs at the new mexico
immigrant law center and due to
ongoing concerns for the health
and safety of my grandson new
mexico's three ice attention
facilities we are advocating for
the passage of speech
the bill would prohibit new
mexico public entities from
entering into an
intergovernmental services
agreements I guess says that
facilitate civil immigration to
tension the urgency of the spill
can not be understated i'm as a
lawyer who represents and works
with asylum seekers in each of
our three facilities along with
my coalition colleagues we have
been able to track troubling
trends and systemic abu says in
all three facilities asylum
seekers are subjected to
physical violence and abuse and
outrage races in xenophobia
people and detention repeatedly
and consistently report being
treated worse than animals man
and women are losing way and all
facilities because of an
adequate and inadible food there
is a completely unacceptable
lack of access to clean drinking
water people report going
without water for hours on end
despite repeated requests to be
referred.
Man in women are getting sick
they look emaciated request for
medical assistance are ignored.
They're their regular bug and
rode and investation sewage
leaks on the ground
invormatories paper spray
attacks excessive use of force
force labor in so many other
agreed just conditions but on
top of this men and women are
subjected to do process
violations during their asylum
proceedings in new mexico we
regulately see victims of
torture people with credible and
strong asylum claims be denied
the opportunity to even file an
asylum application there is
recently a young man who is
death who was unrepresented
because he could not access
legal services through the phone
and deprived of constitutionally
required accommodations for his
preliminary asylum screening.
Because you cannot meaningfully
participate and his asylum
proceedings he was ordered to
ported my organization by chance
ran into him in the hallway and
the facility we immediately
stopped and and we filed a civil
rights complaint and we won his
case but we know we are not able
to catch and rectify every do
process violation they're only
six non profit attorneys
providing proboner
representation to detained
immigrants and new mexico a
population of nearly two
thousand people we simply cannot
keep up every single day we see
people are disabilities not
receive a commodation lg bt
asylum seekers and slurs and
abuse survivors of sexual
assaults in torture before
they're victimized and
retrovertized by prison and is
officials with each children
under the age of twenty one
forced into new mexico's adult
ace facilities in the private of
the opportunity to seek special
immigrant juvenile status
something they are entitled to
up until the age of twenty one
things to new mexico passing
each be fifteen last year.
But despite that law ice is
actively preventing these
shouldered from accessing
justice and instead to point
them back to danger every single
day.
All of these conditions have
been verified by multiple
government oversight bodies
legal service providers and the
new mexico congressional
delegation it is clear that
there are systemic abuses and
these facilities it is
exceedingly well documented and
so no new mexico now has the
opportunity to stop its
complicity and these and
justices by passing speed one
forty five i've sent her citio
though passes already i'm
a summary of of the
constitutionality of these laws
and and we're happy to answer
additional questions but i'll
stop there.
Thank you.
Okay let's go to the audience
then just for the show of hands.
Thank you
i'll take a few comments how
many people are here in our
position to the.
The.
Why don't we take.
Five anybody of this is the one
that a lot of people
nobody's online for this okay
five in opposition and or five
in favor of five and.
You're going to fix
five in in support.
Try to keep your comments brief
use their handheld mike.
Show him turn on for.
Capitol top to see if it's
working yep it's working.
Okay thank you mister chairman
and members of the committee my
name is real brother and the
director of civic engagement for
innovation law a member of the
dignity not the tension
coalition and the torrents kind
of listening project.
And i'm speaking in support of
this bill.
When we exam in the ways I can't
tell where to hold this can you
hear me if I hold it here.
The.
How's that testing close okay
when we examine the ways that
immigration prisons and flick
suffering on our communities
supporters of immigration
presents shift the focus to the
economic role that these sites
of human suffering play and
rural communities.
In doing so they would have used
believe that rural economic
distress begins when prison's
close.
They avoid harder conversations
about rural economic development
that is actually responsive to
the needs of early communities.
If we care about rural economic
development and we should.
We should support the
association of counties when
they ask for funds for rural
emergency medical services.
We should support the local
solar access fund and help roll
communities save on utility
costs.
Support jobs trainings after
school programs investment in
existing community centers and
senior centers and royal
communities.
Please do not accept the premise
that other immigrant communities
must suffer.
Or rural communities my suffer.
State funding for the things
that residents of real
communities actually need can
help great jobs that people
actually want.
Thank you mister chairman.
Thank you mister chair and
members of the committee my name
is mariscon I am a student at
the mexico state university and
I am the legislative fellow for
the new mexico dream team I grew
up in a terrible county where
one of the detention centers is
located.
In my community of alan gardo
the detention center does not
bring anything valuable to our
community.
In fact the detention center
pulls resources that could be
put towards community building
away from our valuable programs
these detention centers are
places that not only bring harm
to the community but people
seeking asylum and refuge my
grandparents were immigrants the
united states from mexico and
met and crawls bad new mexico.
I am grateful every day that
they had come during the present
day.
A because if they had come
because if they.
Excuse me.
Yes thank you if they had not
come.
When they did and come during
the present day I would not be
standing before you because they
may never have met.
My grandparents both of
beautiful life together.
But we're only able to do so
because they met and were not
forced into isolation.
I urge you chair and members of
the committee to vote yes on sb
one forty five thank you.
Thank you mister chairman and
members of the committee my name
is so we bowman and I am an
attorney working with detained
asylum seekers at less than me
because immigrant advocacy
center.
The majority of my clients are
detained at the otero county
processing center the four
profit detention center thirty
minutes from all passo in the
past six months alone we have
seen people in other being
denied access to healthy even
edible food women not being
given basic hygiene supplies and
guards their consistently making
its in a phobec discriminatory
comments towards asylum seekers.
For example this past july one
of our clients reported
homophobic mistreatment sexual
harassment intimidation and
threats of retaliation at the
hands of a terrible guards.
One guard mocked him when he was
sick saying in front of other
detainees that he had let
himself be impregnated by the
men and his barracks and then
proceeded to call him anti
decuselers
the next month in august one of
our clients was yelled at by her
deportation officer and told she
would never get out of detention
after she attempted to report
his abuse of behavior we
reported the incident to various
government oversight agencies
but no for their actions were
public publicly taken to protect
other women in detention from
this officer.
These are just two of the many
horrific stories that we hear
coming out of our terror all the
time this detention center and
the others in new mexico do not
have to exist I urge you to
support the digging out
detention act and end the
suffering in these facilities.
Thank you mister chair members
of the committee i'm not looking
together with the ace of new
mexico here to support sp one
forty five because this is
critical legislation to get our
state out of the business of
facilitating the detention of
our neighbor's friend's family
members for immigrants as well
of its asylum seekers who came
to our doorstep seeking refuge
and safety and shelter we should
not be involved in being
complicit in this process he's
facilities as these folks have
mentioned have a wall
documentary history of problems
and abuses has been decommended
by the office of investigating
of the investigator general at
the has as well as visited by a
congressional delegation and an
out of that soup of other
oversight agencies this bill is
well within your mexico's
constitutional rate not to be an
active participant in the
detention of immigrants it
doesn't prevent the government
from doing whatever the
government wants to do it just
ensures that new mexico doesn't
get its hands dirty to make a
bug out of this business thank
you.
Thank you mister chairman my
name is the reverend michael and
manipesca will priest and the
rector at st michael and all the
piscable church and overcooking
new mexico.
Our church runs a small shelter
for folks that since I have been
there the summer have entirely
been released from the ice
attention facility is that this
bellwood close.
And we hear a story after story
from the guests at our landing
ministry about the abuse that
they have received in these
facilities earlier this summer a
group of our volunteers and
clergy were given a tour at
torrents county and were
actively lied to we have come to
believe by personnel there about
the facility about the treatment
about the dietary support in the
place we believe they're they're
willing to lie to church people
they are probably willing to lie
to others as well because we
have heard from person after
person about inadequate few food
and abuse.
I reach scripture and every so
often we hear that command from
god to welcome the stranger
among you one of the best
translations from both hebrew
and greek of that word stranger
is immigrant are stated in new
mexico is not a welcoming place
for many of our immigrant
neighbors right now I would urge
you to get out of this business
of human rights abuse and as
quickly as we can.
Okay now we'll hear from
still nobody online right.
We'll hear now from five people
who want to speak against the
bill and if you'll simply
identify yourself when you.
I'm not sure it's.
The strip thank you so much
members the board
three inches here my name is
david peter on that can you turn
you for civil accounting and i'm
here to speak on behalf of the
impact this legislation would
have on spoiled county new
mexico she keep that close to
your mouth because if you drop
down to low we miss it.
I'll try that sir thank you so
despite calls from advocates to
decrease bunding for ice
detention congress appropriate
two point nine billion dollars
to hold thirty four thousand
people in iced attention each
day for FY twenty twenty three
this proposed legislation would
have absolutely no impact on the
number of detainees house by ice
in a given year which seems to
be the objective of the sponsors
rather this legislation would
only change the location of
detention ultimately this
legislation would make a very
costly statement that that look
government that mets goes
disgusted with the federal
government's treatment of human
beings at an exorbitant cost
those communities that are
reliant upon those up operations
course that it is the largest
employer in syphola county and
has an annual of payroll at ten
point eight million dollars
behind that number is the nearly
two hundred and fifty employees
who have children that attend
sabola county schools employees
who have spouses that work at
our county offices our hospitals
and our schools these employees
own and rent homes at our
community they shop in the
community they are parents and
grandparents that live in the
community and they formed the
fabric of our community.
A prohibition against private
detention contracts would leave
these two hundred fifty
employees and their families
without an income source.
It would result in the
displacement of countless
families many of whom have lived
in civil account for generations
it results in the fracturing of
family units as former employees
the corsic facility scrambled to
find positions somewhere else in
the community and throughout the
state.
It wouldn't reduce the thirty
four thousand people that I
swell the team this year it will
not reduce the two point nine
billion dollars that congress is
appropriate to house them.
The.
The immigrants being detained by
our federal government would
simply be moved elsewhere in the
process the legislature would
fracture community and our
families the weight of this
action would fall on the hard
working count residents who are
simply trying to make a living
and support their families.
The impact would not end with
the impact on just these
families instead with the exodus
of these members of our
communities we anticipate a
corresponding decline in our
housing market in our local
economy in general.
Removing ten point eight million
dollars a year and payroll from
our community from the largest
deploring our community would
have a direct impact on the
struggling retailers who managed
by the skin of their teeth to
keep the doors opened through
the pandemic the values of the
property least and owned by such
businesses and on our housing
market.
The county would additionally
experience a substantial decline
in our property tax revenue to
the tune of her approximately
eight hundred eighty thousand
dollars a year which property
taxes serve to support not just
the county but the village is a
belong the city of grants the
cibola county schools and the
state of new mexico.
With that decline in both
property taxes and gross
receipts tax revenue the county
would be forced to pair down the
essential services we offer to
our residence.
This.
Including road maintenance and
law enforcement services which
means the loss of get additional
drops in our community.
The last disable account he
extends beyond the lost property
taxes lost reduced school and
roman and the impact on the
local economy and housing market
similar county contracts of
course the big to house the
county detainees several years
back spo county made the
difficult decision to close the
county detention facility set
facility as a result of staffing
challenges litigation
difficulties assessing accessing
health care services for
detention population increased
premiums decrease coverage and
increase exposure course of
extept up to the plate employed
the county detention staff that
the county was forced to lay off
and allowed course and it
allowed to blow county to keep
our county detainees house
within our.
Course of because advise that it
can not maintain its contract
with the county for housing its
detainees where the county
statutory perhaps it from
maintaining its contract with
course that it to detain
individuals for federal symbol
immigration violations.
We understand that other
counties that have been forced
to close their detention centers
have had to transport or
detainees as far as an hour and
a half each way away from their
families in the courts which
transport exposes the detainees
and the correctional officers to
the risk of parm in the
transport along isolated.
This is broken I would respect
the requests
that benning contracts with
private attention facilities is
not the fix or even the first
step towards i'm fixing the
broken system rather I might
suggest the state consider a
resolution setting for its
position with respect to the
broken immigration system
partnering with our federal
legislative delegation and the
president to dress.
The failures of our immigration
system and that it worked to
develop an adopt safeguards to
insure safe keeping those
immigrants detained by the
federal government in new mexico
and I stamp for any questions by
the committee.
Could you just share with this
at the similar county coursivic
facility.
What number of ice detainees are
in the facility and what's the
total size of the yes mister
chairman so presently the
facility holds a thousand
detainees nine hundred and
federal civil immigration
detainees and one hundred of the
county detainees
they did interrupt well yeah
thank you
so we'll go to the next thank
you.
The.
Is there still.
The.
Can you hear me ok that good
afternoon mr chairman members of
the committee I am torrents
county manager janice borrella
in two thousand nineteen
torrents county entered into an
inner governmental service
agreement with the US department
of homeland security for the
detention and care of detainees
at the torrents can you
detention facility prior to that
the detention facility had been
closed since two thousand and
seventeen course they were
comploys two hundred and five
staff at the torrents county
detention facility there are the
they are the largest employer in
the region this is the fiscal
impact from when they shut down
in two thousand seventeen each
figure is for one year.
In two thousand and seventeen
corsific laid off two hundred
and three staff average salary
twenty dollars an hour total
grace gross wages eight point
four million dollars by using
employment multiplier of three
point zero three indirect jobs
that support this industry total
wage impact was twenty five
point five million dollars
translating to eight hundred and
eighteen jobs lost told us of
money spent in the county twelve
point seven million dollars
overall required increase in
torrents county service office
budget two point five million
dollars well swargo and other
local businesses closed no
viable repurposing options where
identified for the detention
facility.
Torrents can a detention
facility was deemed an expedited
credible fear location by the
enforcement and removal
operations ice headquarters out
of washington DC because of the
capability of their facility and
equipment they facilitate the
required hearings and interviews
necessary for the day detainees
to continue in their asylum
process seeking a positive
outcome while detained in the
united states.
Torrents county commissioner
samuel shrup is diligent to
conduct unhindered soup surprise
inspections are the torrents
county detention facility he has
an open line of communication
with non governmental
organizations and he actively
investigates every alleged
infraction reported to him he
continues to report favorably on
his inspections and
investigations towards canada
requests for the supremacy class
to be taken into consideration
and respectfully requests that
the county's igsa with the US
department of homeland security
beyond hindered in its execution
thank you us answer the same
question how big is the facility
and how many of the inmates or
ice detainees mister chairman I
don't have the accurate
information in the last thing I
want to do is give you an
accurate information I don't
have that current with me out I
do believe that missus
jennifer's probably has a
two wouldn't be able to assess
with that I could get it for the
next commitment next hearing ok
thank you
next.
Welcome.
Thank you hold it up close to
your mouth yes good.
Hello everyone I really do think
that we need ice as a minimal
level of border security we have
seen criminal games coming from
mexico and rabbish the people
that will pretty soon be voting
on whether to keep you as a
senator
good
I ask that instead of completely
getting rid of rich in new
mexico we could maybe send a few
health inspectors to make sure
that they treat their detention
is marshumane and that
they tried yes
maybe we could also
get it easier to have it be
immigrated legally instead of
having to cross the border
illegally so that would mean
getting more assistance to get
legally registered come to the
united states and so I think
that we need this minimal level
of border security to protect
our citizens in new mexico thank
you very much god bless you.
Conservations your price.
You're less name surprised.
Period.
See your fuss
thank you thank you service
anybody else speaking opposition
we do have online the otero
county.
Is that the hotel conny
commission.
It just says of terrorist county
is online would like to come.
What do you know the names of
the center.
Okay it's are being nichols.
You have an.
Okay mr nichols go ahead please.
The.
Mister
right now yes
and thank you
my name's arbi neckland's
county attorney speaking behind
their carrier date.
Supposed to ask you one forty
five
next i'd like to know that last
time I invited the phone it's an
app it's this legislation and
any interest of legislators to
tour though terrible counting
processes with me the date no
one is taking me up on that
offer but it remains on the
table
and available in terror county
is demanded to the beginning of
fighting compassion treatment a
ball in the most past three
terror county processing
consolidate and the points that
would mentioned earlier if not
come to our attention and we
would appreciate it that it's
nation because to a submit in
the last finally and briefly i'd
like to state likely and not
outcomes from the passive less
beyond forty five in the middle
small continue to be detained
their detention of this
perspectively in red states
weren't have no sign our ability
for all the site can the
advocates promise the migrants
will not just go to texas for
detention and with new mexico.
Next they will be placing an
unfaint unfunded mandate on
local governments and communist
provide resources and needs that
the currently provided in the
processing still things by eyes
such as freedom medical shopper
and policy new york human dinner
for example.
Where things.
The cities are being overrun and
unable to adequately meet the
needs of the migrants colorado
pass the version of this bill
and end to affect january first
binber is family overwhelmed by
the needs more than forty
thousand migrants is to speak.
The litigation passed will curve
and state it's almost certain
beautiful challenges from
counties and corporations
involved.
Pennsylvania's dollars and
economic damage lost jobs
terrible county will be fault on
its bond with an outstanding
amount around twenty five
million dollars represents the
same time that's not lost the
bondholders.
And with that there will be
credit damage to a terrible
county's credit rating
that be substantial economic
costume terrible purpose of the
solely money we do not have.
There'll be a loss of an
immigration port of the story
the five youngest foreign
congressional research service
one thousand more judges are
firm we needed to have a hope of
planning in silent backlog by
twenty thirty two so we need
more judging
don't need to affect their
ability and then space and
switch in spot.
And there being increased in a
leading labor and criminal
exploitation of thousands of men
with most will unable to work
for a member of one hundred and
eighty days often longer than
the technical issues and police.
One minute more leasers the
wires from
legislation stand for nick
questions maybe
maybe yeah well I have the same
question for you mister roberts
how big is the facility and what
percentage of inmates are ice
detainees.
This master chairman I am
unfortunately do not have that
my finger tips right now but I
will have that I can provide
that to me maybe the email and
also the next future okay if you
could provide that that would be
helpful thank you.
But then we have two people
online who want to speak in
support of the bill.
Uh current rigor.
And diana busteos.
The start with mister rigger.
A good afternoon mister chairman
members of the committee this is
girt rigger director of luther
literature and about similar
drive new mexico luthern
advocacy also expresses the
position of any mexical
conference of churches and i'm
here today to express her strong
support for sd one forty five we
are asking you to end
immigration to tension in new
mexico you've heard of the
verified cases of immigrant
detained ease living and
unacceptable conditions and of
the harm that resulted of the
fear and even death these are
reasons enough for new mexico's
involvement in this inhuman and
life threatening practice to end
I was shocked to learn
of the absolute randomness of
the current immigration system
regarding detention this is an
important point two individuals
with very similar experiences
could come with you could have
two opposite outcomes upon
entering our state one is chosen
for detainment and the other is
allowed to travel to a sponsor
while waiting for their
immigration court hearing more
sharkingly was learning that
under federal law detention of
immigrants is completely
discretionary thus we can choose
as a state not to detain as
organizations are advocacy as
rooted in our faith and our
faith teachers that we should
protect embrace in empower all
immigrants and refugees within a
just in welcoming community
lutheran avexue minister of next
go in the confidence of churches
urges your support for sd forty
one forty five and thank you for
the stop to speak thank you
reverend rigger diana boost the
us.
Then
chairman and members of the
committee my name is legal and
sat.
The.
I am a mother a proud mother and
a member of its central with
over five thousand members I I
feel very proud because after
fleeing the violence that I was
subject to in my country on the
desk I have now managed to
receive training as a community
worker going my certification
brand the health department and
I am a volunteer and within last
meet that you.
The.
Any anything else.
Hello yes go ahead.
Do you guys hear me yes yeah we
can hear you fine good.
Okay.
The.
Again i'm nearly incurrence that
and I am a proud mother they
don't know
it just go ahead.
I arrived to this country
seeking refugee when I was eight
months pregnant and
and I had my eleven year old son
but the first thing I found was
verbal attacks from the officers
who detained me and made racist
comments why did you come here
this is in your country the
immediately took me to the
detention standard what where we
all know it's called the freezer
where in addition to their there
is no bands and they only gave
us.
Cold bread and cookies to my
children the worst came when
they separated me and my
children.
And we thought that we would
never see each other again I
remember.
That back then they charged
around five thousand per person.
To leave the detention center.
All all of this left us
psychologically marked for life
my son has lived with a lot of
fear that is why we asked that
these attention centers close
there should be no.
Corporations benefiting from
human suffering and detaining
our communities we support
dignity not detentions we are
due to support SB one forty
five.
Thank you very much miss who
steals okay let's go to the
committee then.
The.
Well first did you want to
respond to anything you're heard
yes mister chair I do about the
tour.
I believe.
I don't remember if it is.
Two years ago four years ago I
went because there is a state
law that requires that if the
legislature goes to a prison
estate prison that they have to
let you in into toward the
facility that state law.
So I went to the torrents county
facility of course it's not a
state prison and they refused.
So I am glad to hear that they
are offering towards but I would
like to be able to go at my time
and not at a time that they can
prepare for the tour so I would
definitely take that tick that
up.
If they have my name there and
let me in I will definitely go
at some point the other point I
wanted to make is that
intergovernmental service agree
agreements.
Our contracts between the
federal government and local
governments to provide this
service.
An unfortunately what ice does
is it uses these excise to
acquire iced attention space
instead of a
contracting directly with the
private entities.
Because there are fewer
requirements for documentation
and competition in an agreement
between the federal government
and a governmental agency.
In other words what ice is doing
is their using these agreements
as a shield of things that are
ordinarily expected in
government in federal
governmental contracting such
has assessment of past
performance that simply does not
happen and other requirements of
the federal government has so
that's what's happening they
could do this directly
if they wanted to if if the if
the private company was willing
to jump through all of the hoops
and to allow themselves to be
inspected by the federal
government so I want also want
to turn to my expert to address
a couple of th.
Members of the committee and i'm
i'm happy to quickly clarify
your michael these detention
numbers and provide a more
accurate
popular shane at similar there
are a hundred and fifty men in
ice attention at seven county
correctional center the marshals
population is is several hundred
of the only ones it would be
affected by this bill as a
hundred and ice detainees of
which they're only a hundred and
fifty misser chair members of
the committee yes.
And ado terror there is a little
under a thousand men and women
how that the other county
processing center there is a
prison across the street which
holds individuals and uperiod.
Anything else
anything else no mister chair
thank you i'm happy to answer
anything you could let's go to
the committee for discussion in
question senator neighborhood
true
the cutting.
Senator neighborhood start with
you
thank you mister chair
mister and senator is public
body to find were is that just
the common.
Definition that that we should
expect.
Thank you for that question it's
a great when i'm so the
definition of public body is
used in the new mexico civil
rates act and ave in
conversation with legislative
council services it is
disfavored to include a
definition section in a bell
with a term has already been
defined elsewhere.
I'm we're happy to give that
definition as while I have it in
front of me would you like that
okay as used in the new mexico
civil rates act public body
means a state or local
government and advisory board a
commission in agency or an
entity created by the
constitution of new mexico or
any branch of government that
receives public funding
including political subdivision
special tax districts school
districts in the institutions of
higher education.
And misreturned senator.
I didn't hear the word federal
government but the breath of
that definition seemed with the
same to include.
The federal government would
that be.
Mr president the s.
The.
I'm not worried about a forty
i'm worried about whether it's
included in the definition.
No when
um I just went through this in
another case in actually a legal
case when um
uh there was an ordinance that
purported to bind the c.
That that ordinance could not
find the county so when you
don't have authority to find
something even if you purport to
it it doesn't.
So mister chair to be clear
public body does not include the
federal government in this case
absolutely mister president
that's right.
Yeah.
Mr chair and and senator.
I believe I heard in your
opening comment said it was not.
The breath of this act to
include private.
Detention for saw these did i.
Mr president the federal
government can still contract
directly with the private.
What will explore that a second.
So.
But there was some
mention of.
Facilities and I wrote down or
terrible county torrents county
similar county and then there
were other facilities so I could
could you go over which
facilities would be impacted by
this that are public facilities
and let's start with state so
which state facilities would be
impacted by this
act or this bill mr chair
senator you've listed the those
of the facilities that have
detention one of those are state
facilities.
No there are county that's
correct you ask me
which they facilities would be
impacted by your bill
missed mr terrible t.
Yes mr chair senator so otero
county owns a terror county
processing center it is
privately operated corse back
owns and operates both torrents
county detention facility and
see below county correctional
center the way the contractual
relationship works is the
federal government contracts
with a county and then the
county has a separate agreement
with their detention facility to
run the operations so it in the
case of torrents and see belong
particular it is igs are quite
literally being used as a
shield.
Okay mister chair asked my
question again which state of
new mexico facilities are
impacted by this bill.
Mr chair senator nine.
One nine nine okay so not
talking about any new mexico
facilities any state of new
mexico facilities under the
apartment of corrections that is
correct
it would prohibit them in the
future from doing it so all of
them
are
affected by this.
Correct.
Mrperiod chairman I understand
it.
Ultimately it would impact all
of them because it has a
prohibition but but i'm i'm
worried about the immediate
impact of the determination
provisions and so let's talk
about the at least the believe
three
somewhat associated county
positions
so let's look at mister chair
and senator.
In oteral county is that a
country for stility or is it a
private
mr chair senator o terror county
owns the otero county processing
center they contracts with
management and.
Opera.
So if it is a county owned
facility and they're under a
contract we've seen the facility
out.
Does this bill.
Provide for the termination of a
lease agreement.
Mr chair senator the current
contractual relationship doesn't
inc.
Manage operations.
Yeah.
That so mr chair and um center
as as I understand it then this
bill would not impact the oteral
county facility.
As it's currently written as
that correct mystery chair
senator their spell would impact
the otero county processing
center at their igsa agreement
with ice.
Were you just as I understood
the answer to the question the
prior question was whether or
not the lease agreement between
our terrible county and the
private facility.
Would be terminated as a result
of this provision right up
mrperiod charit senator it
wouldn't impact
agreement there's no such lease
agreement.
I have an authority to a
management agreement and as such
because the ads they would be
terminated any agreements to
operate the facility to detain
people for federal federal civil
immigration violations would
also similarly have to be
terminated so so so if I
understand the
if I understand the answer
if i'm terrible county is.
Maybe not leasing that is making
available its property to engage
in this activity.
This bill would apply
and therefore even though it's a
private contractor operating the
facility this bill would apply
to the alteral county facility
mr chairs senator that's cracked
okay.
Let's look at torrents county.
Could this return and center
could you tell us what the
ownership's situation is and
torrents and whether that solely
would be subject to this this
bill
yes mr chair senator corseback
owns an operates torrent county
detention facility as well as
see blah county correctional
center.
The.
So with respect to those two
counties.
This bill would have no
application to those two
facilities as that correct mr
chair senator that's not correct
it's a complicated contractual
relationship and i'm happy to
explain it the way it is
the way up works is the federal
government contracts with
counties through inter
governmental services agreements
igsa's accounties ban go around
in turn to private prison
companies and subcontract with
them to perform the duties under
the igsa so that is the way that
currently works at porance and
siebel and as I mentioned
earlier the igs are being used
as shields to you ordinary
competition requirements asus is
quickly jumping into the
agreement without looking into
the history of performance by
the companies that are
ultimately sell operating these
facilities.
If mr chairman center if ice
wanted to contract directly with
the course
to provide those services could
it do so mr chair senator that's
correct.
So it's just
a mechanism.
To terminate a contract but
there would be a direct way of I
so chose to contract directly
with these two for so reason and
our sensibly keep them out and
is that correct.
Mr chair I thought I made that
clear that the reason they don't
is because they don't go through
all of the hoops that were.
Yeah.
And they don't have.
Yes and the question was the ice
would not be prevented from
going through whatever process
it has to privately contract
with a owner of a facility in
new mexico and this bill would
not apply if there were that
direct relationship that cut the
county out that correct mister
chairs.
The.
You know what.
We we have a facility I don't
know why it's getting echoes but
we have of the solidarity in our
community
in our teases a matter of fact
that is operated by the
department of homeland security
and yeah as the the people from
some of these counties expressed
their concern about employment
i'm concerned about employment
and that's a federal law
enforcement training center.
And the federal law enforcement
training center in our teacher
actually trends
I believe every border patrol
agent across the united states
and so I want to know whether
there's anything in this bill
that would have any impact upon
the training that goes on in our
teasing new mexico at fletsy
mister chairs and I don't know
what would happen.
Okay.
Mrperiod chairman senator
could you briefly tell me what
year would be a common
termination provision what what
would be the gesture of a
termination provision that uh
we're talking about in the bill
mister chair i'm turning that
over twenty
mr chairs senator thank you for
that question each igsa has
termination provision language
at each one of them does a new
mexico requiring either sixty
days notice or a hundred and
twenty days notice to terminate
the contract and there's no
terms that have to be made it
can be it's out well so so
either party mrperiod chair can
terminate the contract upon the
appropriate number of days
notice
mr chair senator that's correct.
Is there anything mr chair that
would prevent.
Well terrible county I guess be
out but torrents or siebel
accounting from uh
you know having a five year
contract with ice
tomorrow.
Mr chair senator that's why we
made that amendment is to reduce
that game plan to try to get out
of this
well because I think you still
have the game plan.
Because
it talks about.
Certain dates and this bill is
not in effect this bill is not
law.
And even it makes it through the
system it's not going to be law
for a little while.
So what would prevent those
counties from.
February first from entering
into a five year contract with.
Mr chair senator the bill
requires contract termination
and that the parties the count
to use exercise the termination
provision in the igsa on may
fifteenth twenty twenty four and
that they do so for their
earliest effective date
permissible under the contract
so they're sixty days or a
hundred and twenty days so they
can certainly try and contract
for five years ten years twenty
years but the the law requires
termination of the contract
well if if I were the travelers
counting commissioner that I
once was and I told this bill.
I think I would begin wanting to
protect the economic driver my
community as was expressed was
expressed.
And I would look to our existing
contracts and seem
what I could do to make sure
that that contract didn't
did terminate under the terms of
this act for a substantial wind
of time.
And I don't I mean we're not
reaching back to we're
prohibited by the constitution
from reaching back so it seems
to me that that county could
good american its contractual
relationship with eyes on
february first
be a little later because
adapted to a public reading that
they could do this.
Yeah avoid at least right time
period of years terminating
their contract even if we passes
bill and the law
mister chair senator
they clinton do that if they
thought that was prudent and
wise I don't know whether it
would be improvement and wise to
lock themselves in to rates
certain other provisions for
five years and the other thing
that I would be surprised is
whether the federal government
would be willing to lock them in
because has we've seen they like
to terminate these things at a
moment's notice so I mean yes
you can do that as long as this
bill is not effect you can try
don't know whether they meet all
of the visions in addition
they'd have to jump to the cooks
required I don't know whether
they have enough time but
certainly they could they could
try and has we said ice doesn't
like to go
directly with the private
companies because of the review
that is required but if there's
additional review
that is still a benefit of that
that would happen sufficient but
it would be a benefit to I see
to have more transparency and
should have additional review of
their prior.
Trying to be diplomatic
performance yes that's the their
prior.
Other than the other torrents
and siebel county for
celebrities.
Is there any facility like in my
part of the state the county are
do any of the facilities and we
count
how
detainees
now not the number of I I don't
know represent people.
Yeah.
Mr chair and center well I
do not believe that
this nation this state this
county or any of the counties
should treat individuals in the
way that you have described
yeah and I find that to be
deplorable
III do have a concern that we
are
not really addressing.
That is you and we're causing
termination of maybe contracts
in in our state that some
communities are apparently
reliant on
if the majority of of uh their
work forces is related to that
for so that's going to impact a
county impact a lot of people
that live in that county uh
drive their income drive there
economic base what have you.
And and so i'm concerned that
that these measures.
While they may be successful in
removing the detainees out.
They're going to go somewhere
federal governments probably not
I mean I don't know what they do
but they're probably not going
to just simply lot on walk out
the door they're probably going
to send them some place out and
if those conditions exist in new
mexico.
I would suspect if it's same
deplorable conditions exists
elsewhere were not really
enhancing many bit more just
it's just geography for their
grounds or whether it's
the stance here some place
elsewhere you know some place in
taxes or wherever else these for
soldiers are located and so you
know i'm concerned that that uh
we're going to impact citizens
of these communities
potentially uh not have the
economic uh base for those
communities and yet we're not
enhancing the
conditions of the details when
they get moved elsewhere and so
in my mind I think we're we're
somewhat uh harming.
Some of our communities.
And we're really not benefited
the people that you want to be
able to so i'm concerned about
that you can comment if you want
that that's my last question
wireless statement.
At least we would not be
complicit in it and in addition
by his my expert has done there
there have been a lot of studies
about the economic impact and I
would like to turn it over to my
expert.
Let me just say that those were
passed out we do have the
studies there's no reason to go
through them now.
The.
So senator catching your next
followed by senators mechanic
and told me.
Mr chair and center
thank you thank you very much
one just a question I don't I
don't see you on the bill.
Okay
okay I don't even know where to
go with that I was added
yesterday but somehow I was wide
off this bill and
I signed this bill I believe on
the first of a second day of the
session and then I discovered
when I agreed to be the prime
sponsor if there was a white out
of my name if you notice on the
bill there is you can see like
this little weight out thing
that was my name with a plus
they're trying to rub you and so
I have to see I am I I am still
hot you can tell i'm still hot
about that but I signed it
yesterday and it was added
yesterday so thank you for that
question you allowed me to vent
my frustration about being
waited out okay and I believe
that that's illegal to white a
senator out without
and I don't know what I don't
know what happened to the truth
be told I don't know what
happened but i'm still hot and
this does explain why that
amendment and house bill one
deleted all purchase of white
out in the next year.
Alright
mr chair and and senator I am I
am appalled at the living
conditions that the bid
administration is allowing.
Matter fact I just don't like
those clowns every time I hear a
new thing about.
Speaker man am I able to yell if
I speak up so
many I didn't know there were
such atrocity still going on in
the buy and administration
having not seen anything in the
news about this.
So
just a couple of housekeeping
issues.
The does this bill in any way
prevent the building of the
tents that we saw during the
afghan.
When they pulled out of
afghanistan
mr chair senator no it's a the
bill is quite narrow and says
that it is igsa agreements or
any other agreements to detain
people for civil immigration
violations in the case of that
afghans they were evacuated and
processed and that wasn't
detention okay it
would that be that mister
chairman center would that be an
option if this was if these
facilities were shut down in
their reserve.
Overwhelming mass of people that
still had to be the tain and
controlled would I still have
the ability or power to build
temporary facilities in which
the house these people in.
Mr chair senator the bill
prevents the igsa agreements
with county is the federal
government is free to build on
its own land as as they see
better okay so mister jones
center so if they wanted to
build tensities to house people
they could in yesterday's far.
Mister chair senator yes okay.
So but mischair center what
would be the plan the same may
the fifteenth these things are
just shut in what would be the
plan or what what would happen
to the people at that point mr
chair senator think you'll so
there is a wine down period
contemplated in all of these
contracts as I mentioned earlier
sixty days are a hundred and
twenty days and most of the
individuals we work with and all
three facilities have sponsors
people that they can go to
communities who can receive them
all throughout the united states
okay mister charles air so these
people will be shipped at that
point two other facilities round
united states mr chair senator
of variety of things can happen
people who have deportation
orders could be deported people
who are eligible for release can
be released to their community
is all throughout the united
states and pursue asylum from
thought their homes people can
be transferred to other
facilities we see that all the
time now of people are regularly
transferred out of torrents
county with regularity.
Mister chairman center speaking
just directly in the elpasso
sector.
Cause as the sector that
directly affects us your new
mexico do we know how many
encounters and how many
deportations or.
I guess we encounters and
deportations as two separate
questions so let's keep that
straight in counters
and I guess maybe a restaurant
or deep her detention detained
he's on the high hours at all to
clarify my language there miss
your chair senator out
unfortunately don't have those
numbers in front of me.
Okay
i'd like to share him I did
mister chairman center I did a
tour of the border not too long
ago and we went down to the
johnson ranch and and rode
around where the wall ends we
had the
we were escorted by the border
patrol and their experiencing
around twelve hundred and
counters a day and that's from
that's from clinton to about
lordsburg.
And that's you know capturing us
a certain amount of people that
come across and from the border
patrol agent smells they said
this these are not this is not a
peaceful invasion it's a
military action and that most of
the people who are apprehended
now I understand a lot of the
the detainees come to the border
and a lot of time that's that's
orchestrated in order to sin out
the security on the border so
they bring a lot of people to
the facilities or to the to the
border and it'll be processed in
and and moved across but
they are coming across
with a whole lot of
you know a lot of them in full
regalia several several hundred
dollars worth of worth of prime
honey gear and and things like
that.
So it seems to me that we're
talking again in this.
Committee about a problem far
too late in the sequence of
problems and I am.
Concerned if we shut these
facilities down we will now only
we have not stopped the influx.
Of illegal immigrants.
And now we will.
Stop the now we will less than
the number of beds if there are
any or.
You know as as you reported
earlier square footage of
concrete for them to sleep on is
that.
In my misreading the situation
mr chair senator immigrations of
big topic and the federal
government has the the pervies
you
implement policies at the border
what we know is advocates as
that you know no amount of
policies at the border stop
people from coming so how can we
be smart at the federal level in
the state levels tier.
Humanly deal with the situation
as far as we're concerned with
the spell of course the state of
new mexico doesn't have any
authority over the border so
that's a bit beyond the scope of
their spell in terms of what we
see as you know there's there's
two different issues we have
people who are in detention who
do have communities to go to or
there's a separate am issue of
course with people who are and
house and major cities and
there's a variety of reasons for
that and a variety of federal
policies at play and but
the two situations are much
different thank you mister jaren
and and senders here I am just
like sandra nibert.
I don't think the treatment of
of people.
Like this is ever acceptable
absolutely not.
But going back to one of your
prior statements at no level of
effort on the border will make a
difference i'll just leave with
one question.
And that is asking both of you
all and everybody in this room
if you lock your door when you
go to bed it.
And with that.
Thank you senator I I just want
to get clear it for my own mind
I I thought I remembered from
last year in this bill the
people were talking about in the
detention program.
Are those who were signed there
they're all seeking asylum.
These are not people who were
coming in with military regalia
or anything I mean these are
people are saying i'm fleeing
for political asylum religious
asylum or protection from
violence.
And so a lot of them were just
sent on their way there's all
you ever you have an uncle in
denver
will will visit for a couple of
days the church will and we put
join a bus and you go up to
denver or you have an aunt in
tampa okay here's a bus ticket
to temper but some then it's
it's at least somebody today.
Said in their testimony it's a
it's a fairly arbitrary process
who gets detained in these three
facilities in new mexico and who
gets given a bus ticket and said
to go see your uncle and show up
in three months or whenever we
get in touch with you for your
hearing is my giving the the
picture a little
mister chair that's absolutely
right.
So all of the folks we're
talking about people who are
asking for asylum they want to
remain.
Because of political or
religious or other kinds of
persecution wherever they came
from.
Yes mister chair.
And there will be a hearing on
each of them it's just that we
have so few judges.
And so if you resources to get
to them that I understand how
long will it take before the
earnings are.
Couple years two three years mr
chair senator there's a lot more
before that including
preliminary screenings called
credible fear interviews and
that's a huge issue at torrents
actually we're seeing people be
deprived of due process during
the credible fear interview
process before they can even
seek asylum with their judge and
but you're absolutely correct
these are asylum seekers under
federal law their detention is
completely discretionary.
And and they're not violating a
look
there not violated a lot they're
being put in to jail awaiting a
hearing of some kind but they're
not charged with any offense
they are that is correct mr
chair.
It was one of their angle we
wanted to ask about that now
slip my mind that i'm sure it'll
pop back we have two other
cynician mccanning senator
tomorrow and then senator most
this we actually get three
senator mckenna.
Remote to for awa.
How's that is that better
okay.
Thank you chairman thank you
colleague and senators to deal
opens
thank you senator pope
is just.
He is keeping my seat warm.
I'm gonna chairman and senator.
I'm gonna say something and that
i'm going to back up with set
it.
This.
I'll ****.
I said uphor four profit
detention organizations that are
committing human rights
offences.
And i'll tell you why.
I'm reading from the national
immigrant justice center.
And.
This doesn't just reflect on new
mexico the torrents county
detention facility but as you
see when I read it it's system
wide
now this is mark feldman's
senior attorney at the national
immigrant justice center quote
ice's failure to hold detention
facilities accountable for a
greatest substandard conditions
is not new.
And it is not you need to
torrents county detention
facility
it is endemic across the ice
detention system and quote.
Now chairman and senator
chairman you mentioned that
something that i've been.
Well where for years now and
that is refugees that are coming
to our border
they're not coming to attack us.
They are fleeing for safety and
requesting asylum.
Why
because of threats of death
maiming
their family friends have been
murdered.
Their governments have been
fractured for example cuba haiti
venos well on nicaragua.
Persecuted for who they are.
The lgbt plus a community.
They are persecuted in some of
these countries.
They come here so they can
survive and live.
And climate change don't be
surprised because of crop
failures and drought.
I'm chairman and senator
last year
senators my estus and or
teasipino based sponsored sp one
seven two no detaining for
federal immigration violations
it failed to pass the senate by
two boats
the tally was eighteen to
twenty.
Chairman senator
would we be in this room on this
day thirty one january twenty
twenty four if that bill had
passed last year and was in law.
Thank you chairman thank you
senator.
Literally concerns me chairman
and senator.
Had we changed it they're
probably the lateless abuses
that have gone on this past
year.
When I was growing up.
And really got involved with
civics and government.
The the usa was always described
as beacon of hope for the world.
When these.
Immigrants refugees flame.
Cross to our country.
And then they are treated.
The way I know they've been
treated
what do they think of their
country then.
Chairman and senator I went to a
sorry this thing is back farn on
me.
I went to a rally last year and
the rally was about
and remember it for those who
are committed suicide while in
detention of a ice facility
and so for this present for this
meeting today want to look up
what's what is the rate of
suicide in ice facilities.
And one of the studies I found
is seventeen per one hundred
thousand.
Seventeen per one hundred
thousand.
Some of them here in new mexico.
How can this state how can this
country.
Condone a business that commits
human rights abuses for profit.
A colleague of mine chairman and
senator has visited a nice
facility in new mexico.
And he's been there more than
once.
And he always comes away telling
me a debrief.
Of the horrendous treatment he
gets.
From the staff.
They're believe you're into him
they don't want to answer his
questions.
Difficult to interact with and
they refuse to let.
Those detained to meet with him.
And i'm and other congressional
staff members.
Chairman and senator I think if
we were ticket take a pole in
this room.
I can just imagine how many arms
would go up of how many of our
ancestors.
Fleet at this country.
Because of those reasons that I
mentioned before.
My hand would definitely go up
sherman.
Senator.
My grandfather fled ireland
because of drought and because
there's needed to survive.
And he was welcome to this
country.
Thought I was stepped dancing in
new york city served in world
more one.
He was treated well.
What happened to that country
thank you chairman thank you
senator.
Thank you senator mckenna
senator tom and followed by
senator my esther
thank you mister schuer and
thank you senator for bringing
this go forward at three or four
questions are written down but.
Already sure these bills are
going to be here a midnight i'm
going to stay here in midnight.
The.
We're folks doing where they can
feed their families that work
for somebody who abuses people.
Thank you senator tom and
senator miss thank you mister
and thank you thank you very
much all the folks that are
here.
And for the tremendous work
done.
You know leaving up to this
point you know i'm getting a
message and things like that.
I am worked with up
representative of an electoral
young and introduced hospital
six twenty four
way back in the day which tried
to provide oversight it was a
two thousand nineteen six twenty
four try to provide oversight.
On these.
That all of for these federal
inmates than to stop the
contracting with ice you know so
anyway so tribute to the to the
organizing in the leaders in the
room that this is happening
but a couple just couple
questions on the bill itself so
so mister chairman
representative center city
little perception section one.
I get section two.
If we could look at section two
and page three it says you know
no public bodie entity shall.
The.
This.
You know no public body may sell
a facility you know that that's
you that's going to be used to
house.
Iced teenes but what is.
What is two and three and four
what is that prohibit I don't
understand those.
Mr chair senator think you we
are covering all rbc and make
sure making sure that public
entities are attempt to find
work around to sell participate
in the civil immigration
attention of of asylum seekers
so we quite literally you know
through through the the source
here but we're making sure that
we're covering all of our basis
so we're not selling property
where night helping construct
property we're not otherwise
profiting from the kitching and
torturing of my grand.
No thank you mister chairman
thank you generally no I
understand the policy as I was
just going to get into the words
because the words that doesn't
it they're just like section a
one is I get.
Section two it just.
They just seem word to me what
i'll talk to guys offline but I
understand the policy no
question about it um.
And you are covering all the
basis cause i'm the bottom of
his three lines twenty two
through twenty four essentially
no other lock in.
Can a violate this law you know
we need to put that in every
single bill just
and then
but here's my question i'm i'm
in france.
When I hear news well let me
just give a quick wrap in then
i'll ask the question that you
know when when there's a huge
economic downturn there's a
rising anti immigrant sentiment
it's advantageous politically
too to espouse anti emergency
sentiment.
We all know how advantages it
can get.
When we look at certain examples
of people's rise to power what
not.
So so there was heavy entire
movement sent to minute oh nine
o ten or eleven oh twelve US
I think it was ten eighty in
arizona you had the laws and
alabama.
It was then later found out
mister you know that that some
of the private prison industry
folks were
at the table in drafting those
anti immigrant loss in arizona
with the agenda of housing more
immigrants so my point is is
that up two fold one is that the
even though the recession is
over and economies growing we
still live under antamogra
sentiment in this country so
it's very unusual that it's
prolonged this long.
So even though in certain
communities we may not see it or
hear it it exists so we we got
to be aware of it without a be
vigilant at all times.
Particularly if if if the
unthinkable happens in november
and next january.
Which I believe is a possibility
so when I see.
Human rights violations at
facilities in texas and all the
crazy that's going on in other
states I feel powerless to do
something.
The there isn't a law that we
can visit prisons in the mexico
but the doc has always a loud
legislators to show up in any
given time like a general
general lady's agreement and and
we never go and if we do go we
call me at a time but anyway we
are.
We have that agreement with with
doc as we you know it's part of
our government so my question is
if we close these three
facilities down.
Um.
And they're still that you know
billion dollar appropriation in
congress.
How are why are we closing these
to be facilities down if for
example there's going to go to
the panhandle i'd I
just need to know I just need to
tell people you need to educate
me on that because.
Cause that's that's my best
legit concern mr chair senator
thank you at a few of you
responses to that first this is
a growing movement amongst eight
two no longer participate in
these contracts we would be the
eighth c and what we've seen in
the seven previous states as
these facilities are no longer
to teen people for federal
immigration violations no longer
have ice contracts or in some
key says the facilities shut
down you take away national ace
bed space so in the case of
asylum seekers as was mentioned
before in the public comment by
acre it's truly random who is
the teams and who has released
with instructions to come to
court at a later dates which
rives that decision to the team
somewhere is the availability of
aspect space so effectively by
taking away I spend space we are
helping asylum seekers have the
opportunity to actually seek
asylum from comfort of their
home have access to legal
resources that the otherwise
were not have access to you if
they were detained have access
for integration surfaces social
services things of that nature
we of course can't control and
that attention outside of our
state but this is something that
we have the opportunity to deal
and in it would send a strong
message to the federal
government that this this abuse
needs to stop nationwide yeah
thank you for that thank you
very much for that and then I
see mister chairman center city
up as the.
The the private market
incentives cannot be a part of
government detention of human
beings just cannot and so.
We cannot incinerate in any way
now granted theoretically the
federal government could
appropriate you know two point
nine billion but but at least
the peril government would own
and manage the facilities and
feel that crunch would come
budget time.
Arm as opposed to economic
incentives and and an interest.
Influence in that that
appropriation process
so no way we can go on and
hopefully wouldn't spend the
next five years debating
immigration policy and in this
building because it drained us
for five years.
But but we're prepared to do
that if necessary thank you
mister chairman
thank you senator masters and
and I did remember the three
other point that I wanted to
make that mayors of the cities
texas has been and florida have
been sending lots of these
asylum seekers up there.
I don't know they just show up
in a bus in the
they then saying of for some
time now.
That if the people are waiting
there are sylem hearings could
work.
The problem with bench very
quickly.
Because if they were allowed to
work.
They would do the jobs that were
dying to people do.
They wouldn't have to be
detained because they could they
could rent their own places.
This is this is a problem of of
of our own making of the federal
government's own making by
trying to be tough on
immigration they're hitting the
people that have not billy that
are following the law.
And making it harder for for
everybody as a result so I want
to thank you for bringing this
for any other discussion.
Seeing none what's the will of
the committee.
We have emotion from senator
mechanic for a dupless second
from senator said the locus and
the secretary will call the
rule.
As amended.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
So by a vote of six to three you
have a do passes thank you very
much thank you mister check and
and
members yep please just file out
because we still have a number
of bills but it's not as bad as
it looks
because some of the some of the
less persistent some of the
senators would listen
have said role me over to friday
so if anybody is here for the.
You're persistent I know you
have insurance yeah
i'm sorry
please we hit we have to move on
here if you're here for either
of these bills they've been
rolled over
senate bill two ten senator by
the as bill health care fund
purpose funding if you're here
for that one it's not going to
be heard tonight it'll be added
to the friday agenda
or if you're here for
the last bill on our agenda one
ninety five felony entering
retail establishment centre
monos is going home already
rolled over to fray those of the
two were rolling over as of now
but there are the others as
people fall by the way side.
One ninety five the last bill on
the agenda the earlier one was a
two ten which would be the one
after this were nearly.
So we're we're moving right
along here.
Senator saving a look because
you're going to carry this one
to brain injury program
to build two
two oh three perfect.
Mr chair if you were if you were
recall
with legislative health and
human services the interim
committee that you share
we had a presentation by the
brain injury program also known
his the brains interest services
found
we have a committee sub yes mr
go ahead and explain what it is
and will do the rigor roll
around.
Okay.
Those those of the those of the
of **** were members of the
legislative healthy numerous
services may recall and I know
that the chair recalls of very
well
that we had a presentation by
the brain injury program.
The.
Uh in during the interim.
And what we learned was that
this this program last is
funding when HB one thirty nine
was hast if you were called hb
one thirty nine was to eliminate
all these fees all these court
fees.
And so this.
This is probably a product this
this.
The understanding was that these
funds would be restored but the
presentation was more than that
the presentation was also about
the need for a registry.
And so.
Has I volunteered and senator
tomorrow volunteered to to carry
this.
Because you know and to ensure
that the funding what we were
volunteered for was to try to
get the additional funding but
what we also discover it on the
way here is that hb to didn't.
Didn't take care of what needed
to be taken care of.
So that is the the source of the
bill and we
senator told me and I had a.
Two different bills and we that
the reason you have the
committee substitute is because
we put these bills together and
we will then let go of our
individual bills and have this
one bill go forward and that was
all point.
I'm not going to object
I would like to make sure that
our analysts get the committee
so
so they can at least look at it
I thought a bunch of them today
but I didn't with this one
so I mean this is a simple one
that we just like to read.
I I apologies i'm not sure where
that is.
Thank you mister it was a
commitment that the state
government gave these programs
that if we you know don't
nicholand I am all these
score flood drivers though it
would be there would be held
harmless so you know the math is
understandable that was off but
we have to correct the matter
thank you.
Anything else it's going to say
about the bill.
Well I know in the interest of
time
just think it would introduce
your expert witness
this this is it sibly and
appropriation bill to restore
the funds but also an increase
beyond what they used to
collect.
Yes it actually your your
absolutely right it's it's
undergrad which means we zip
through this and nothing flat.
The.
Did you introduce your
experience.
So is your michael not is okay
thank you so my name is margo
feld label I am a clinical
social worker I service the
president of the brain injury
alliance have new mexico I am in
private practice serving adults
living with brain injury and I
did serve on the
task force that grew out of
senate memorial thirty last year
when we were asked to evaluate.
The state of brain injury care
in new mexico and make
recommendations and we are here
today to address just a couple
of those recommendations one of
which is to increase funding for
the brain injury services fund
this is the fund that works with
people who do now qualify for
medicaid who have had often
times their lives utterly
devastated by brain injury
it will if someone has other
insurance it will pay copays and
premiums and it provide or for
people who don't have medicaid
it provides home care
rehabilitation therapies i'm
home and and vehicle
modifications counseling a
number of different services
right now the annual cap per
person is four thousand dollars
per year it's very very low it
used to be twenty five thousand
but because of any make traffic
fees it's four thousand dollars
year that pays for three point
two five hours of home care for
a single person for a year it's
seventy seven dollars a week
this is for someone who also
needs physical therapy
occupational therapies speech
therapy to get there mobility
their cognition there ability to
live independently back and
instead they're getting three
hours often times of home care
care providers do not want to
drive out to someone's house for
an hour a day three times a week
it's not worth it for them
it's really quite unconscionable
how low the services are at this
point I have a couple of
just examples I would like to
share with you
one is this.
The ask is okay
okay all right thank you getting
educated so we are asking for
two point five million dollars
on the majority of which about
two hundred and.
Two point two five million
dollars would go to the brain
injury services fund which is
this crisis gap program that
provides services for people
this would allow
a cap of about eight thousand
dollars per year or possibly ten
thousand depending on how many
people are served and then
another quarter of a million
would go to the other part of
the program which is the brain
injury resource center and the
brain injury resource center
takes calls from all over the
state from families individuals
doctors different people looking
for services for people guidance
and how to work with people with
brain injury and the reserve
center is funded to the level of
sixty thousand dollars a year
right now it's not enough to pay
rent and staff fully so this is
what we're asking for okay
actually you're asking for more
than that
we're you're asking for two
point five for the brand injury
services fund a million for the
brain injury services fund
for to establish and support a
brain injury registry
and then six hundred thousand to
the department of health.
Uh to conduct surveillance of
the prevalence and incidents of
brain injury and three hundred
thousand.
To the health care authority to
provide brain educate a brain
injury education problem so
there's a providers by combining
them into one
building a little more expensive
than originally right and that
way we take care of people who
own our medicaid and people who
are okay the fitted think you
mister chair and the prepared
for two oh three
thank you so let's go to the
audience who in the audiences
and support of this bill
is there anyone here in
opposition to the bill
nope nobody in opposition that
did you want to say something
and can you keep the chart and
we have your hand out here.
Mister chair we do have experts
but we're not we're we don't
think it's necessary.
Okay net can you sure how to
turn that
up you got it.
Thank you mister chair members
of the committee answer and an
experts.
The hand out doesn't have a name
on it but it's just.
The topics who know today
on the left lower corner is
where I was a month prior to my
first head injury and the on the
right is.
My head is.
And it's already been mentioned
about hospital one thirty nine
the sponsor her house bill when
thirty nine and monitor in the
final house in the final
committee when that was heard
and passed last year it's on you
the agencies to put the money in
the budgets that would be
replicated that would be funding
the last revenue stream from
traffic it ticket fees not find
speeds.
And that that was made quite
clear and it's not only the
brain injury service but it's
also the administrative office
with courts we will have no
juries at seven million dollars
does not go to the courts and
other flights when you all know
that it's been a long day but
what was said about me was has
been forty years since my first
hand injury so the comment was
nineteen eighty four reads like
a novel and from a nineteen
ninety six to two thousand four
they've been four hundred and
thirty five bills and memorials
regarding bright injury that's
over twenty eight years
I spent six years drinking
liquids I had two ten hour
facebook reconstructive
surgeries which led to the non
diagnosis of a brain injury
because also nineteen eighty
four was earlier and reads like
a naval
our first very significant
legislation with sixteen years
ago.
One of the comments that I have
been make is be the change you
want to see in the world and the
how can I do what I do today why
I do this since I make lemonade
out of my lemons because the
other alternative is to not make
a difference there three three
things that are guaranteed we
arrive we're here and then we
leave nobody gets alive it's
what we do with the space in
between the makes the difference
in the mention of pace programs
pace is a possible alternative
but only for someone who's over
the age of fifty five who is on
social security disability or as
the site has medicaid medicare
and then they need to purchase
an additional part d plan which
is the drug coverage under
medicare and anything outside of
a pace program would be an out
of pocket cost of additional
costs that might be something
that would be provided i'm sorry
for the ipration it might be
something that could be provided
by the brain injury service fund
but if the individuals has
medicaid it would not be covered
so there are some complications
and that's part of why I do what
I do after the time in policy
and half of the time in serving
the individuals address because
the it's complex and that's why
resourceness so important but we
really need resource center
individuals to be highly trading
and really understand the impact
of policy and the impact of
insurance and how we navigate
that thank you very much for
your time mister chairman
members of the committee answer
an expert thank you net thank
you so much.
Members of the committee what's
will the committee I think there
were some.
Someone online maybe no there
was a gym you wanted to say
something.
Mr mister chair members had the
committee jim jackson for a
disability of written new mexico
and for the disability coalition
I promise i'll be really quick
you've heard about why this is
so important the crucial issue
here is that with the current
funding going away we need to
replace that and as senator my
estimate says pointed out we
kind of made that commitment as
a state but it hasn't happened
and it's not in hospital too so
i'm here to encourage you to
support this on the bus
substitute bill that's great but
I would just also ask all of you
as senators the key is issue is
we have to get at least some
money into a house bill to for
this fun so i'd ask all of you
to talk to your colleagues on
the senate finance committee to
try to make sure that when this
bill comes over which is just
about now I think they passed
about their bill today when it
comes over please have the
senate finance committee put
some money into the separate
injury service thanks thank you
jim was there somebody else yes
ma'am.
The.
Thank you
my name is chair salt
closer I put it up.
My name is chassault
come today because I won't you
to understand how important this
program was four years ago four
years ago o is badly injured in
suffered a severe brain into my
life has been as a business
woman for thirty years I
developed in help start up
companies who was no place to
turn when it happened there were
no resources this this was the
first resource that could help
me they stepped in immediately
with home care the help stepped
in a mediately with giving me
what I needed at that moment and
there was nothing else can do
this I kept tell your house
strongly I feel about this but I
speak for myself and I speak for
many many people in terms of why
this is so important.
Thank you thank you chose that's
much okay anybody else.
Members of the committee what's
will the committee senator
mccutching.
The mister chair insider does
this or does this not
apply to people that are
eligible for medicare cause we
heard both
may I speak to that medicate i'm
so for example one of the
examples that I brought on a
flyer today is about a gentleman
who had a brain injury he was on
medicare he could not afford his
co insurance and so the fun
stepped in and paid his premiums
and his co insurance
after.
Two years is coordinator
successfully enrolled him in
medicaid which now pays his
medicare premiums and his copays
she also enrolled him in pace
medicares program of all
inclusive care for the elderly
he now has full health insurance
and care and exited the short
term program so
it can help people with no
insurance but it can also help
people with some form of
insurance that is not fall
medicaid
so mister chairman in center it
does go to both medicaid and non
medicaid okay customer care so
non medicaid medicare and
private insurance but not people
who are on phone.
Okay that that.
We did here during the interim
some comment of some discussion
of the need possibly to create a
waiver program for brain injury
so that it medicaid would begin
covering these services that the
services they need or not the
kind of services not all of them
are the kind of services that
medicaid typically pays for so
that that that it would be a
different.
Agenda a different array a menu
of services that would.
Anybody else.
Said if you had him has
emotioned to pass seconded by
senator tomorrow any other
discussion the secretary will
call the rule.
Senator senator neighborhood
discussion
yes yes we have a motion it's a
it's a substitute committee
substantial.
That's close enough
the term will exercise
okay secretary will call the
role on the committee subject to
bill two or three.
Center my yes.
Yes.
Neighborhood.
Yes.
Yes.
By a vote of eight in the
affirmative zero in the negative
you have a dupassed energy
now will go to senator hickey
tobacco fund
where you go did he slip out.
Yeah
okay senator source let's get
you appear
he lost his place in line.
One twenty seven
as amended.
I think it was amended we did
over to get a minute and we have
a.
Mr chair and committee this is a
bill that was passed out of this
committee unanimously last year
it went through both sides got
up to the governor the governor
vetoed it she had some
disagreements with the medical
board and this had a part of the
medical board and we got caught
up in that disagreement there we
do have a message from the
governor on this particular
piece of legislation there is an
amendment that it is some of the
things with the medical board
just is an overview from last
year I know there are two brand
new members on here is this
deals with prescribing
psychologists new mexico was the
very first state to authorize
prescribing psychologist who are
highly trained professionals in
the area of psychotropic drugs
and using medications in
behavioral health and we have to
highly qualify experts doctor
joe velascust and then also
leslie dozo is president of the
prescribing psychologist group
in new mexico if there are any
other kinds of questions around
it but it's to allow them to
supervise their own within this
area with additional training in
order to be able to do that and
with your permission mister
chair if I could have linda
explain what the amendment does
in the change over what we have
last year.
The.
Thank you let it go ahead thank
you mister members of the
committee so this was a
compromise that we worked out
with the new mexico medical
society because in this bill we
are not putting the prescribe in
psychologist under the board of
medicine but we are creating an
avenue form designated um
members of the board of
medicine.
To develop the education.
Addison in addition to the
psychology to approve the
training and.
As part of the amendment is that
this committee m.
Will review quarterly
anything that's happening within
the br.
So the new addition in the first
party amendment allows
prescribing psychologists who
have been practicing in the
mexico since two thousand and
four two actually prescribed the
medication necessary.
To counter act.
Medical situations that the side
effects thank you the drugs that
they prescribe and right now
they can prescribe the
psychotropic medication they can
not prescribe the medication to.
So they have to sound.
Another visit waiting weeks.
First section to do and they
also.
Okay.
Any discussion of the amendment.
Do we have a motion on the
amendment.
We have emotion to adopt the
amendment.
Any opposition
seeing none will consider the
bill to be amended and the whole
bill you've kind of explained it
already.
Any any anybody in the audience
yet you have expert witnesses to
they want to speak on.
Mr chair I think they're here
for technical support we know
the time is late and you know it
if they needed great but they
not feel that they have to speak
if it's not needed you're
reading the room very well since
I I have coached my team sir.
Anybody in the audience want to
raise their hand indicating
support for this.
Anybody in the audience want to
raise their hand indicating
opposition to the.
Nobody's online we're all alone
and.
Any questions from the committee
senator
mr chair senator just speaking
for myself I may need your
experts.
Many of us appear or up or in
the same situation yes
you can talk with them
afterwards they may be able to
give you a quick dose of some.
Okay seeing no designer we can.
If your chairman if you're ready
for way not emotion okay
chairman I moved to
approve
speed one twenty seven as
amended
seconded by senator tomorrow any
other discussion.
Secretary will call the role.
Senator.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Congratulations senator involved
in seven and the affirmative
zero in the negative
thank you all you'll have a good
evening
senator hicky we skipped over
you because you went out for a
cigarette.
Okay.
So said a bill one sixteen.
The.
Okay thank you mister chair I
can make this short or we can
prolong it to people want but
it's relatively simple
thank you yeah well you're the
problem if it's long
as me
mister chair and senator.
The this basically without going
back into the history we've had
a reserve we've had tobacco
settlements going into a fund
it's about up to four hundred
and thirty six million dollars
but back in the dark days the
state took a lot of it and for
it into a reserve fund in the
general fund and it's it's
sitting there but the problem
with the money sitting in the
general fund is that it doesn't
earn the kind of interest and
return that it can earn outside
of a reserve fund so basically
what this says is that this fund
is no longer a reserve fund and
that can be invested
appropriately to get more return
now I can give you a lot of
color over
how word or they were doing
around getting prevention
education and vaping and lots of
other things that this is simply
to allow the fund to generate
more return so that we can
eventually get to what we call
are basically a tipping point
where the returns are greater
than what we're earning from the
tobacco settlement on the yearly
basis and when that happens that
money becomes usable for
prevention and other activities
so that's an essence with this
bill list I do want to be
straight forward however and let
you know that there is
consideration of an amendment to
put it off for another year we
did this last year we got the
bills we always regard to build
through then it was put off for
a year and then it was park at
vetoed apparently it's good this
year but I got noticed that
because four hundred and thirty
six million dollars impacts the
reserve amount which I believe
is ever in pre negotiated rate
before all the budgetary stuff
and this with lower it below
whereas i'm understanding this
agreement.
And i'm told that negotiations
can probably save this so i'm
not bringing the amendment in
today
I will bring it in later at the
at the will of the two
committees but the principle is
we didn't just money in the fund
we need it earning the the
principle i'm sorry the interest
and.
And I would like to see it
past and I think that are
our senate finance committee is
is over the tune to do that but
will in at least if you get it
into law then next year when
they come up with their budget
they can't take advantage of it
and it won't be
where is it we put it off
through
who knows what they'll do next
year in hospital thank you
mister chair anybody here in
support of this bill.
Anybody in opposition anybody
online the members of the
committee.
The.
Senator
if you want to make a motion
senator tomorrow
so just thomas moves to do
pass seconded by senator or t
pino.
The.
Repairlessly close but we have a
we have you to six yes we're
good.
Secretary will call the rule.
Senator yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I bought a seven in the
affirmative zero in the negative
you have a duplice thank you
mister chair thank you committee
so now we'll move to step there
the guidelines and build one
thirty five and we have a
committee subon this one.
Ape a little
heavy communities.
Thank you mister chair members
of the committee
this is senator stephanic since
center I resodo and senator
brant was here for a while he
was one of the coast bunches but
he is left and one of our
advocates vanessa alleried will
be in and we have an technical
expert from the officer's
superintendent of insurance who
switched to be on line or by
soon
can you notify her that.
The.
That will receive.
The.
Okay we'll will keep working on
it.
We get her online.
Just trying to get onto the line
right now
let me see if there's a way that
she can should have access to it
today so i'm in a.
Yeah.
We will list and when we get to
so what is this all about first
of all you went to adopt the
committee suburb discussion.
So yes please mechanical yes
chairman I moved that we do not
pass and a bill one thirty five
but that we do for discussion
purposes adopt senate bill one
thirty five substitute the
committee substitute thank
mr chair and members of the
committee do you have a point
one we have point one o k so I
will give us the novels of the
committee substitute which will
basically explain the bill it
amends the health care
purchasing act so that
individuals who are having
problems getting authorization
higher authorization for
specially drugs.
Like for very specific
conditions like cancer and other
immunitory.
Diseases they can sometimes take
up to two years to get that
authorization even though the
step therapy bill that we passed
here in our state legislature
indicates that decisions have to
be made in a rapid manner within
seventy two hours then doctors
health care providers it's not
just doctors any health care
provider nurspection.
Can get a timely answer in
relation to the insurance
company.
The issue is that insurance
companies medical directors may
or may not be a health care
provider but.
Regardless they do not know the
patient it is the it is the
patience doctor or other health
care provider who really knows
what that patient has gone
through whether they have
already tried a series of drugs
and they finally found something
that's going to help them and
they want to keep that person
stable and on a particular drug.
With me today I can go into more
details about the bill but with
me is center I be sodo and miss
vanessa alleried seven or so is
one of the many
sponsors of this bill said as I
indicated senator brand had to
leave but center share is one of
our.
Co sponsors along with many
other people and I can read all
the names in a minute center
i've been sort of would like to
say something and then miss a
vanessa alleryed as an advocate
unpaid.
This bill is about the secre.
In this bill.
And this bill is.
Actually fairly narrow bill in
its school.
The the exceptions to step
therapy that we have.
The.
The exceptions to to step
therapy that we have in this
bill
you'll be able to see.
If you turn to.
I got.
Uh it's the nature of the
insurance code.
And the page nineteen.
Order a behavioral health
condition or cancer we already
have.
But so we're not talking about
everything.
Which i've made an automated
disorder a behavior h.
That's fairly narrow.
Well we're talking about is.
Is whether or not those people.
Should have to go through the
very step there be.
Protocols drugs.
I'm.
I'm somebody who.
Suffers from product conditions.
The.
I will relieve at this hour this
committee from all the details
of my credit conditions.
And what i've gone through.
It would take the better part of
an hour for me to go I I won't
do that.
I will share a couple of the
highlights of my struggle.
What are the highlights of the
struggle is getting a denial
letter.
From an insurance company.
And said saying.
We would.
We can approve you if you do the
following things and there's a
list.
Of nine things that I had to do
to be approved and I did the
nine things that I had to be and
had to be done.
To be approved.
And then we resubmitted and I
was do not.
And I called the insurance
company and I asked why was I
don't i.
This of lead and meet the
conditions I said i.
Did the nine things.
That was in the letter.
They said well if you keep
really further down in the
letter it says there may be
additional requirements.
That are that that will be
expected.
I said well what does that mean.
The.
You specified nine things I did
the nine things that you
specify.
And the person said to me.
And I quote.
If we told patience what they
really needed to do to be
approved.
They would just do it.
If we told patience what they
really needed to do to be
approved.
They would just do it.
The.
So that's what I leave they
always put at the bottom.
There may be other things and
then they do not.
By the way.
The person will lie was at a
medical doctor now.
Was it a best practition now.
Was it a physicians assisted no.
I believe the person was a
pharmacist not a farm I don't
want the doctor and
pharmacology.
But a person who had the men on
training to be license.
Who second guest the decision.
Of my primary care physician.
Who inserted themselves in the
relationship.
Between me.
Am I primary care.
Position.
List of night things to do which
I do flee dead and then said
i'll never mind we're going to
play hide the ball anyway.
I.
That's what this bell is about
for people who have an audio
auto immune disorder a
behavioral health.
In.
Out i'm one of the sponsors.
On this bill for a couple of
reasons one is because of what I
personally have gone through.
Another is because my mother
passed away this last year.
A little over a year ago from
break.
Actually.
I blame covered.
And I blame covered for my mom
done because at the very
beginning of it.
The.
My mom was up with some friends
she felt rocker rib.
In that process they found the
very earliest.
Detection of lunch answer.
Which if she had gotten
treatment for that.
Without delay.
The cancer likely I guarantee a
likely would not a metasticise.
But because of covered there
were delays.
There were delays people weren't
the office they weren't doing
medically.
And unless it was demerically
necessary early on wasn't
necessarily etcetera right.
What happens where you're going
through step therapy there are
delay.
The.
And some treatments simply need
to be.
This they'll the other thing
this bill does which is the
central.
Is that it also says that once
you ban.
For certain conditions once
you've been approved.
At the approval you'll see this
for example and page five.
There's similar language and
elsewhere.
Shall authorize continuing
coverage for the life of the
relief.
Of the prescription drug that is
a subject of the exception
request why because right now
what happens is what you get
prior authorization that per
authorization is good for one
year.
If it's greater condition it's
not going to wait a year.
Chronic means it's never going
away.
Never.
So that you had to go back
through.
Rare authorization.
Every year.
The priorities process can take
three months.
You finally get through that
you've got comfortable again.
And then you have to go back
through practication again.
And then the next year you have
to do it again.
Your condition hasn't changed.
If you have an automated and
condition.
That automated condition has not
changed.
And so that's what this bill is
about now let me just say this
one last thing.
Earlier today I was forced to
receive an award.
From the divided association.
Because I can't read the belt
that new mexico has the lowest
ops or
or insulin in the nation.
Agrees past thirty five dollars
three years before that we pass
twenty five dollars into my
school I negotiated that with
their shorts companies.
I got twenty five dollars
please.
But.
What we did was with that.
Referred formulary or medically
necessary alternative now both
of those prices are very
important referred formulary yes
it should start with the
preferred formula it should
start with what's approved in
the insurance place.
But if what's in the insurance
plan.
What isn't.
Proper for that asia.
A medically necessary
alternative is essential.
And what.
The insurance companies agreed
to was the twenty five dollar
copay would include a medically
necessary alternative now
medical necessarily turns much
more expensive.
But they agreed it's a lot less
expensive.
Then covering blindness or an
appetition.
So in the end of what we're
talking about here is.
And it's about the secret rel.
I'd like to.
Mr chairman members of the
committee my name is alleried I
am a registered labour new
mexico I am in no way working
for any company as their
lobbyists on behalf of this
piece of legislation I just
wanted to make that clear I am I
have been a pharmaceutical
obvious for twelve years so I am
really aware of the intricacies
of.
As well as pharmaceutical
aspect.
I've been working on many bills
started off with I am a
standardization bill in twenty
fourteen about prior
authorizations.
Worked on that worked in sixteen
seventeen and eighteen first up
therapy bill and thank you very
much senator for carrying that
bill we got that passing me to
big tremendous change in
people's lives so I really
appreciate that.
I'm here today as somebody who
has been an impact by not having
access to the medication I
needed I have severe plaques
arises and it is manner faster
really this last year.
Ah I do not have a doctor my
doctor closed up shop in your
mexico so I had to find a doctor
to provide me at referral to go
to the dermatologist so I could
then go onto the step therapy
protocols so I had to get a
protestation and then start step
where I would have appointments
on my body.
The thing about step therapy
about the thing about sarah says
is it's.
So when I was provided it did
help somewhat with the burning
and sensation that you have on
that when I had one way skin.
But at night i'm it was
impacting me not even just
mentally because of.
But I had physical
manifestations of my legs
burning.
Itchiness I would scratch my
legs I would I would wake up
being stuck to sheets with blood
on my shoots there's pass
and now i've talked to all of
you about this you can't even do
basic bodily functions I have
showed some of you photos of
what I look like and that was
uhm.
When I actually started getting
better they tell you all this
because I had to go through this
step therapy and fill multiple
times in order to get access to
the medication that I need it.
Or because of the background
that explained earlier.
I understand how the system
works so I called my doctor i'm
got the the prescription.
Was immediately denied on the
same day by my insurance company
I had called my insurance
company three times that day.
The very next that was on monday
they're very next day was a
tuesday.
Called my doctor asked her to
prescribe my medication again.
And she said I just did this
account we have we waste so much
resource in that way but there
is it takes a tremendous minute
of resources to do
prioritization all the time so
we can act dedicate.
A practication.
I am so middle for you two days
in a row like we have one person
that they will.
Because you've all heard this
i've been talking about you
today I had my medication within
four days.
And I had my injection in four
days and started it the next
week.
The reason I am here today it's
not because I need this
medication i've got it I was
able to utilize the resources
that I know in the knowledge
that I have because of working
in this building for eighteen
years.
The reason i'm here today is
because your constituents might
not.
They might not know the
governor's office office of the
superintendent insurance they
may not know what a medical
director is or how to navigate
their own insurance company or
understand the pbms and things
of that so I want to just make
it very clear that i'm I have my
injection this bill is not about
me this is about the folks in.
They are needing this types of
money medication.
I I am better now I had an
injectable a confunction I can
see but i'm a mother again i'm a
wife again I mean I was.
And it's it's suffering i'm and
I I brought this your attention
because i've been working on
this and in the various
conversations I have had with
your colleagues and some of your
constituents and other people in
this building th.
And you all are here and you are
elected officials that represent
a community and there's a
community out there that needs
access to this and i'm really
trying not to get emotional
right now because th.
Have access to medication that
changes their lives and their
livelihood is tremendous you all
have the power to make that
decision and have us move on.
So with that I will.
Thank you and I said very much.

chair this did receive a message
and so we worked with the offer
office of the superintendent of
insurance in the draft great.
Let's go to the audiences or
anyone here in support of this
bill if you indicate with
na.
Yeah.
My name is smith dean on a
person with multiple
disabilities that I must
legislability advocate this is
something I have not revealed to
committee before but I have
blood cancer and
after I was twenty when I
sustained my person injury I was
forty two when I was diagnosed
with this former blood cancer
which is treatable as long as I
can
apologies
he's trying to sungrade we're
all tired hungry and thank you
so much members that mister
chairman of the committee it's
it's not something every deal
very often but as long as I
treat it i'll still be here that
will probably not be the thing
that takes me down but it is a
hereditary blood cancer which
doesn't bother me and the fact
that I can receive treatment and
it's treatable I am so very
lucky and so very bless thank
you members that maybe sponsors
and advocate sudden chair thank
you net
is there anyone online okay
anybody in the audience was to
speak against this.
Okay let's let's just start here
yes you sir in the front room.
Will just go right right down
the line yeah come up and use
the mike please when you welcome
line up
sorry about that getting a
certain in my mister chairman
members of the committee of
minimum brent more i'm a
registered lobbyist for
america's health insurance plans
it's the national trade
association for health insurers
and first I would say this this
is definitely an emotional bill
you can hear it in the voices of
the sponsors and sin arrived he
sotto and I understand the
difficulty that comes with a
working through a process and
trying to find an appropriate
therapy treatment for various
conditions so I am empathetic to
that
what I would say as it relates
to this bill is in this is a
proposal that he had passed seen
in other places as it relates to
the lifetime exemption so that
is a new concept and we would
say we had heard that miss
alleried had been working on a
proposal but we've really hadn't
seen it until a couple of weeks
ago working through a process of
dealing with lifetime exemptions
and how people would move
through plans because not
everybody stays with one health
insurer throughout the course of
their life that is something
that we would definitely need to
try to understand better and
work through the other part of
this bill that is curious to us
is why I don't disorder why
behavioral health condition why
cancer just those where the
question in my mind is
I understand that but why draw
the distinction you're you're
calling out specific diseases
and not others it doesn't make
sense to simply focus on those
two was I would say this just as
a general matter and this is for
some of the newer members of the
committee.
When you start talking about
making changes within the
insurance code understand that
the the universe of folks that
are covered by the insurance
code in the state in the mexico
is quite small I don't have
exact numbers but I know that it
is below fifteen percent of on
the mexicans are impacted by the
provisions in the insurance code
you all are well aware that the
medicaid population in the state
killing you guys with that I
apologize.
Does the medicaid population is.
North of 40 percent climbing to
fifty at times the majority of
folks are on medicaid so when we
start wanting to control of the
environment as it relates to
insurance you're controlling the
insurance code you're talking
about a very small population
and every additional requirement
that you put on that population
makes it harder and harder for
america's health insurance plans
and our members to provide
coverage would be more than
welcome we would be more than
willing to work with the
sponsors and talk about this
concept but in all honesty we
haven't had this bill or this
proposal for very long to truly
understand the impact the cost
of associated with it and I will
note it is effect it is aimed at
the public assistance act and
the healthcare purchasing act so
you are addressing other
populations medicaid and I back
and I suspect those are very
large numbers in terms of the
state trying to deal with their
proposals there but I don't know
those exact numbers I think we
need more time to address us up
i'll leave my comments with that
thank you thank you thank you
brian
yes ma'am.
Good evening mr chairman and
members of the board i'm not
sure in car and chief medical
officer with blue cross and blue
shield of new mexico i'm also a
practicing physician in the
community and a consumer of new
mexico health care for myself my
family and extended family
members and have consumed a lot
more than I ever wanted to in
the last few years so the
challenges and frustrations.
Is this okay
is this better.
So that of the oldest to say
that i'm below that of the
challenges and frustration with
health care new mexico and I
impetize I would senator ib sort
of story
venice shading shouting your
stories completely empathised
with that and does not discount.
We recommend.
A robust stake older work group
with a robbers stakeholders to
discuss some of the call
operational and cost concerns
and how few examples I think I
read the room correctly and i'll
give you but concise to the best
I can
number one if a drug gets ever
to you approval that does not
automatically help us align with
the national um guidelines these
are evidence because guidelines
for providers insurers and
patients are like example would
be the ncc and guidelines the
national comprehensive cancer
network guidelines.
Secondly.
We appreciate making an
exclusion for generic drugs but
there's also
a larger group of exceptions
that we can discuss and look at
example would be bio similars
example would be opred
medications benzo dies have been
drugs that are have addiction
potential drugs there are meant
for short term utilisation drugs
think about placing a cap
because on one hand we have a
million of rapidly evolving
dynamic new drugs.
On the other hand we do not be
lacked there's an absence of
national drug pricing reforms
and what is left the little
tools that we have to contain
caused if we were to take rid of
him quickly and without
thoughtful discussions then our
cost of care is going to
increase our premiums are
subjected to increase.
At lowers affordability and
again in petes with access to
care and there are some
notations in the in there for
your another details there.
An operational challenges well
i'm also have with axis of care
limitations in new mexico
providers under pressure last
week a patient asked me if I can
prescribe multiple scrolls as
drug because the neurologist
refused so we need to insure
that prescribers have the
subject matter expedies.
The.
And also we have drug shortages
that we hear about recently
heard about drug shortages
cancer drug shortages and
washington and the state of
washington and how they had to
make really difficult decisions
to cope with that and if we
start not containing how
appropriately these drugs are
used then the uninappropriate
use.
It hurts the others who really
need those drugs.
An of the other operational
challenges I think the bill just
talk about medical necessity but
if we do not have a process to
obtain medical necessity at the
frontient and if you figure out
there is no medical necessity of
the high indian how do you
operation and I start usually
what happens is depending on the
lines of businesses how it's
wondered and also depending on
whether or not it providers
network order network either the
patient all the provider best
those cost once the services are
completed.
Um.
And I also if I may quickly
respond to some of the things
that I heard from senator ivy
sodo and miss vanessa number one
is md did not issue a denial
can talk to talk to this we have
medical
we have status that adverse
determinations have to be done
by md so we want to look into
that further second decisions
took two years to be made.
If we do not make a decision on
time it has to be deemed a brute
so we need to look at that and
understand what's happening
there delays and care I I think
senator ivy sort of you talked
about that it's related to
various different it's a
multiproned act I think out of
school for a discussions but we
need to work at it chronic
conditions some of the chronic
conditions for example cancers
going to remission we talk about
diabetes reversals we talk about
drugs not working for some are
human conditions anymore and
there subjected to changes
they're not always constant um.
The.
And and again miss venice are
you said that you knew people
and and that helped her people
who knows we don't have to I
guess no new mexican should know
someone in the senate to get the
treatment that they need that
that's a problem we need to work
at it.
I rode something else I couldn't
see.
Well I guess i'd said them
for the opportunity mister
terman members of the.
Good evening mister chairman
members of the committee i'm pet
block with otero consulting
registered lobbyists for prime
therapeutics of pharmacy
benefits manager and we rise
today and respectful opposition
to senate bill one thirty five I
haven't had an opportunity to
see how the substitute differs
from the original bell so i'm
gonna talk about concerns with
the original bill I think
they're mostly still going to
hold among our concerns are
several overly broad provisions
in this bill i'll give two
examples first as the undefined
and general medical conditions
included in the bill and also
the requirement that the drug
becovered for the lifetime of
the patient rather than allowing
for periodic review to ensure
both patient safety and cost
effective treatment in an ideal
world.
Plans would provide coverage is
that as though money were no
object unfortunately costs or a
consideration in health care and
must be one of the factors
included and finding balance
when setting policies for
coverage as evidence in the fire
this bill increase health care
costs not just in the public
sector as evidence or has
verified by gsd albuquerque
public schools retiree
healthcare and others but across
the entire range of the health
care plans were also concerned
that these changes have the
potential compromise patient
safety this bill has the
potential to undermine evidence
based clinically veteran
programs in place to make sure
the planet released get the
right medicine at the right time
at the lowest cost this is a a
big change a significant policy
modification it really needs a
lot of stakeholder involvement
we stand ready to engage with
all stakeholders over the
interim to look at what
solutions are out there that
directly address the issues and
that go beyond the protection's
currently in place in new mexico
statute including those related
to step therapy that we just did
in twenty nineteen so thank you
very much mister chair thank you
per.
The.
National association
representing pbm's and I guess
i'm bad and clean up so
everybody took my good ideas
but I do rise an opposition to
this bill we haven't seen the
committee substitute we're two
weeks before the intersession
this bill
is now had been sounds like a
complete rewrite we have a lot
of concerns because prior
authors though I will read at
this evening prior authorization
is not just about cost
containment our authorization is
about patient safety and if we
remove that tool it puts
patience at risk and so finding
a way to sit down and address
some of the friction that
patience and providers have seen
regarding step therapy and prior
authorization is something we is
the pcma and our members are
committed to doing but that's a
process that takes time i'm
ready to show up i'm ready to
have my feet held to the fire to
try to find some solutions but
that is that to make such a
fundamental shift in the way
insurance is provided is
something that probably needs a
little bit more thought and we
can stand committed to make
investing the time in the effort
to do that but we just don't
believe this bill is pretty for
prime time yet thank you very
much for you to we have
copies of the substitute
available for you
senator and the catch in the
start with you
okay
thank you guys i'll try to be
quick and my questions and.
Rudimentary in them as well
seeing as how I am not a medical
doctor so the one thing that
pops out to me is.
The.
You know when I got a look at
medic medication like cattle
because I doctor a lot of cattle
and I want to like it but I
don't look at him and be like a
circum in a giving the step
programs even makes it you know
I look at my god this is gonna
fix it and I giving that to
start out with so mister.
The senators that that's how I
do that so my question is is to
what you live to hear me to go
senator ivy soldo is.
Why have we limited it to auto
mean to sort of behave your
health cancer or substance use
disorder.
Love to make it
robbed everything.
We recognize that there's a new
possible.
Requirement to give me we
recognize that there's a need
for cost containment okay
because and that there's a
purpose for stop therapy.
When you're dealing with with a
behaviour home.
Right
a lot of times you're dealing
with someone who can be on the
edge.
And if you don't through too
much up there be you turn up
with an explosive situation.
We'd like.
Automatic disease.
You're dealing with someone who
if you mess around too long
you're dealing with the end of
the life.
We'd like to avoid.
So so that's where we.
Despite the council that's where
we decided to actually bring in.
What is in the end of the day of
very limited.
Well.
Compared to what the needed.
That the critic condition that I
have.
Is a condition.
That.
For which I was told if we.
If you if we if we actually told
patience what they needed they
would do it.
What it is
to do
that would not be covered by
this bill.
It it educates me in terms of
what people.
With these conditions
go through and and and so
so in fact.
Part of what we're hoping for is
that the the annual articles by
os I will have to educate
future
decisions in these areas.
But we are bringing the cent and
a very limited manner and and I
do want to say by the way that I
completely agree that people go
under remission even at running.
Situations and that sometimes
drugs stop working I completely
agree with that.
And that is the matter to be
dealt with with the primary care
physician and the patient.
That's where that is handled
that's not handled with somebody
who may may not be in the.
The.
The.
Yeah.
Mister chairman center.
Thank you again and and again
i'm under the impression again
rudimentary understanding of of
health care and I do know that
it is messed up and insurance
and you know me and my family
got off of insurance several
years ago we're you know.
We just were purchasing a health
insurance plan and we had you
know on eight or nine thousand
dollars deductible you know
fifteen eighteen hundred dollars
a month so you know we're on on
on medicine or christian
healthcare ministries are one of
those deals to it to avoid
insurance and
you know able to pay for those
expenses front and then they
reimburse us later and we've
been extremely happy with that
and I hate the insurance racket.
But just as bad so you and I
were speaking in office earlier
today
you know you almost have to have
a hook with a doctor to get the
right dope to fix yourself if
you've got a problem and that's
not and that's not how it out of
work right so I look at him I
think well we've got
we being the state colon court I
guess certified medical
physician and say that he is
licensed to practice he's gone
through the proper training and
we certify him and trust
patience to him for him to offer
you not relief for various
elements and the seams redundant
that we wouldn't just have him.
Or her give them
the correct drug to begin with
in order to
uh
in order to remediate the the
pain that seems like insurance
companies are are there and
they're the ones
dictating if I understand that.
You know how insurance is in
state new mexico is definitely
not ideal and so we don't want
to cost
anybody pushing body outside on
the fringes with care.
But at the same time we have
medical doctors and if they are
not precarious prescribing you
know the correct medication than
they stand in risk of losing our
licence I meant
it's i'm so that's that's kind
of what I meant on the deal I I
would know why we would limit it
to this and and others there's
there's cost involved there but.
Boy they just don't seem don't
seem like the right thing to do
just looking at it for me so
with mister senator.
Mrperiod chairperson or
president mr mister press either
away
thank you mister president so
hicky followed by senator.
Mister chair i'd be willing to
have a senator nibert go before
i'm I may take a while.
No go
we are hoping group pressure who
had shortened
okay send it to your
neighborhood good
mr chair center hickey doesn't
know me very well doesn't
know why
thank you mister chairman and
sen
for bringing this.
I'm no expert on health care
most of subjects that are coming
before us but I do know one
thing I know that in insurance.
The whole idea behind insurance
is a spread the risk.
The.
The cost of insurance are
absorbed by ultimately the
people who purchase the
insurance
and won't cost
rise premium drives
and so we have this.
I guess tag a war if you will
between
try to make things affordable on
the one hand and then try to
give the people who pay for that
insurance that coverage that
that states they paid for it and
to help spread the risk among a
population and and I think
mister war.
Highlighted one of the things
that we dealt with in the
mexico.
Not a really big market not a
big market to spread those risk
maybe as far as we would like
that would help reduce insurance
cost help reduce a lot of other
things and i'm not just talking
about this insurance and talk
about insurance generally so you
know I look at these things with
some concern as to its impact
on.
The people who are purchasing
the insurance on one hand but
also as you all brought out the
need for those who have
purchased insurance to get the
benefit of what they'd paid for
and not to be
having to jump through hoops in
fact you're
your example sent arrived so it
was sounded like a building
spectrum
to me
we did this
but all by the way you have to
do these other things before
i'll give you your certificate
of occupancy so so you know that
that concerned me I think
anybody.
Gets upset.
They think they've completed.
The task.
To receive whatever whether it's
a certificate of occupants or
whether it's uh prescription
medication
they do those things and then
all the certain
there's five other things that
they have to do sometimes you
know it's on time you don't but
but uh that that does concern a
couple things that uh.
Really bothered me about
about some of the language and
i'm going to I be so do you so
look on page I think it's old my
first question is because I read
the.
House health and human services
subcommittee or committee
substitute for house bill one
eighty five and now we were
handed a committee substitute
here so I want to know are they
exactly the same mister chair
senator they are exactly the
same and interested some of the
plane which we might refer to
the office of insurance because
they have set language
throughout their statutes.
Okay i'm pleased to hear that
because my notes are all on the
house virgin
so i'm going to be trying to get
it to the right place but.
Mr members of the committee this
is yeah seeking
apologies for the technical
difficulties I just wanted you
out that we did work with the
bill sponsor and there was some
conflict
that story conflicts they were
specific to the definition of
medical necessity and we work
with them to correct that in the
committee substitute question of
the bill.
Thank you miss.
Well.
Mr chair i'd like to point out
to uh
I be sort of a I receive this
from that now so was told to
read it side I did exactly what
I was instructed to
have just happened to come from
the house
but over on page five.
Wine eleven and twelve.
And you said it in some of your
comments that the the coverage
would continue for the life of
the enrollee in you said that
these conditions are wife.
And I would like to challenge
you on that because I think I
know a number of people
including family members who
have had cancer and no longer
have cancer so I wonder if the
language should really be for so
long as needed by the role or
something somewhere.
Cause if the prescription drug
richer wanting to
be prescribed to the patient and
the patient take it it should be
for as long as they need it but
there are instances where people
no longer need the prescribed
drugs you know having the life
of the enrolling maybe
maybe that doesn't make sense in
I would say a majority of the
the cases I think there's
probably more people cancel the
occurred from cancer than them
suffer some of these other
things but I don't everything
the back me up on that but i'm I
just know of a lot of people who
have a cancer and then
prescribed drugs for that cancer
and then no longer need it so
mister chair senator bierra at
the office of the superintendent
of insurance I think has
recommendation regarding.
That language of lifetime for
something else.
Mr care members of the committee
we did recommend that the
language is changed to your
policy from a lifetime
to address them of the concern.
So it was your recommendation.
Yes.
Well mr chair that I disagree
with their recommendation
that night I just don't think
it's not clear on her
recommendation we are are you
wanting to change the lifetime
language to a sunset.
This.
I'm sorry I I am so sorry
having really technical issues
and it's really hard to hear no
we I also did recommend that we
do have a sunset so that we see
what the impact of the
legislation would be make
evaluation
and be able to study the result
in maybe one or two or three
years okay so that's at the end
of the bill not that lifetime
language for the patient.
That is correct I apologize that
is correct it's at the end of
the bill they'll have a sense
that similar to with the
surprise dealing act we did have
a three or something
the legislation
so mister chair senator she's
intending to keep the lifetime
language and here and that's the
end of the bill's sunset at
three or four years so there
could be a assessment of how
this is working or the costs etc
I remember you've already heard
this sentence neighborhood to
health care authority but we're
going to be bringing forward the
health care authority bill that
combines the anything that's not
medicaid and medicare into it
back purchasing that would
actually
create a larger fool actually
not only for the conditions in
the medical treatments but also
for the purchase of all the
drugs in our state as well so
that's going to have an impact
upon.
This and any other health care
buildings you have as well
coming in front of you
so I mean this internet
the.
What what i'm pack a little bit
about about the lifetime
and if you look at it there are
past five.
The language i'm paying for is
what the group help plans
medicator.
Language on page five is not
what the persons.
Medical provider.
Shelter.
So what the language up it's
five percent
is that is that on the ranting
exception healthcare plans got
their people protocol.
The health plan and
administrator for the lifetime
within ruling.
Won't get involved on the
question of that rough.
That's not to say that the
medical provider
at some point isn't that a value
with their patience should you
considered around the struck.
The medical provider showed a
value patient should you
continue to be on this.
But that should be a medical
decision made between the
medical provider and the patient
without the interference
of the administrator.
So I want to be clear who the
actor is here.
And and the necessary of the
lifetime.
Exception that is going on here
the exception is not that the
that the patient shocked you to
take the drop.
The exception here is not the
medical providers.
The exception is that the health
and medicator.
Shall not interview in that
relationship.
In terms of that's right.
But that doesn't mean that the
medical provider and the patient
aren't being considering
if they should continue to take
the front of the drug consumers
to be a practice or not.
Those thanks the problem that
happens in chairman and
the problem that happens is you
get somebody who's on a drug
they they think they get into
routine with the drug the drug
is working for them.
And then and then you get.
The health plan administration
that says you know there's a
cheaper drug that came on we
want you to we're gonna we're
gonna disallow the drug.
And we're gonna force you to try
the cheaper drug that just came
online.
Which might have fifty percent
after the but we don't know if
you're in the fifty percent or
not.
We know the drive that you're on
right now is working or we're
going to just rup that therapy.
On the off chance that person.
Okay does it get to you.
It gets to the heart of my
question but it's still raises a
question
mister
senator.
So if the administrators require
to do that for the lights of the
role
there's never any opportunity
for the
for the administrator
with respect to that patient
to to change
their
offering of that particular
family or drugs or whatever to
that place.
M and g to me it makes no sense
because of if they've been
current and they're off the
drive the administrators should
have the ability to to do
something maybe the lower cost
may be new drugs that come out
whatever
but this walks in a minute
forever well for the lives of
the patient
when it doesn't make sense on
that so it's so to me that the
ideas if the person gone it they
all be able to stay on it until
they no longer need it once I
don't need it then the
administrator ought to be able
to.
Make other decisions that are in
the best interest of the group
of people that they've insured
try to reduce the cost so you
know I would still argue with
you on that point
so mister chairs senator i'd
like to offer comment on that.
The decision to take somebody
off and drug and say so.
Might really be their health
care provider
not the medical director of the
insurance company
so this bill like our original
step therapy bill and this bill
put those decisions into your
individual health care provider.
So we do know people go into
remiss
some people have an organ taken
out and it takes care of a
problem.
Um so but it's a health care
your own personal health care
provider that would decide that
not the insurance company
but the administrator.
Again i'm going to show my
ignorance on
how this stuff works but it just
seems to lock in the
administrator that they can't
change.
With her respect to new patients
or whatever they can't change
the offering of pharmaceuticals
to do the people that they have
insurance with and and that's
what
you say and know why
the ten center so
this is chairman center i'm
working so all of this is it
first one specific to an
unrolling not.
Second of all.
It is it I go off a drug
it doesn't cost them anything
that i'm even if i'm approved
for that right let's say
there might be a better cross
there may not be there.
It may be possible to go back on
the drug.
It may not that's a decision for
my medical provider to be wrong.
I'm already proof of the drive.
The but
as long as i'm not using the.
There's no cost to the insurance
company
not the hard offer
so it doesn't have any
at that moment and mr chair what
i'm saying is
if you're cure you're off the
drug.
The insurance company may.
Change and the new people that
are coming in they know what
their deal is but this provision
blocks you in for life
that change in the policy
is not picked up.
Applies everybody else but as to
you you have an exception
because at one time in your life
you had to have that that
particular drug even though it's
changed and so let me give a
different example mr chair
we had this issue not for these
conditions but we have this
issue with under medicaid with
dd patients develop
developmently disabled.
Who
might have a change in the
insurance plan and they start
all with a new
and physician and we had to put
in to the rules they could stay
on the medication is that they
were on under the old
medicaid plan so we recognized
even within medicaid that there
were certain people and certain
conditions but this would be
very disruptive in their lives.
For example we heard when we
were doing stuff therapy that m
s was if somebody got on a
particular drug for ms it could
keep them out of the wheelchair
it could keep them living a
productive life and that those
people should be protected if
they impact went to a different
insurance company so we have add
those situations mister chair
senator will we've protected
people when they've had to cha.
Um
terror similars we heard remarks
from the
insurance companies that uh
maybe they would like to engage
in discussion and so my question
is.
Have were there discussions with
those
groups prior to this.
Or would you be willing to to uh
engage in that because one of
the things that I have a real
concern with.
We make policy because we're
compelled by by very
stories and hurt people we react
to those and and we want to we
want to help people whirl appear
to try to help people
but we do things and then it
restores backed it has some long
lasting.
Implications in the health care
reno were seen today with with
the exitists of doctors from our
state
because we.
Were sensitive that people's
needs and this and that and
we've made public policy that we
thought we were doing good and
in retrospect I would argue with
we've done our citizens at this
service
and think this all right said
she couldn't find a doctor her
doctor left.
I I would point the fingered us
the legislature and state
government to it to a certain
extent for some of that so
mike I would relieve encourage
you if we have an engaged in
those discretions that we do
engage in those discussions
because overall
we're not only talking about the
coverage that they provide but
we're talking about the class to
the
subscribe of those if you will.
So mister chair senator
we have no objection to
negotiate but we don't want.
The non negotiations to stop
this bill
so that if in fact
we negotiated and we still had
individuals or companies or
association staunchly opposed.
We would then bring in the
twenty five advocacy groups who
are standard and support
and.
A physicians are totally
frustrated with our rules and
regulations regarding
phymasuticals my reubantalities
who I only see once or twice a
year as threatened she's young
she threatens to quit every time
I see your and of course it's a
political visit and it's like
you can't believe what the state
of new mexico is doing to me.
And the rules of the regulation
and for her I don't have a
serious condition but for all of
her patience with serious
conditions she can't get
approval for the uh therapies
that she would like even for the
blood tests that she needs to
make sure that that individual
is doing okay with a new drug
that she's prescribing so she
threatens to quit a lot so I
send it am not opposed to
negotiations but I also would
not want.
Lack of negotiations to stop
this bill and to give it direct
answer to absolutely.
Will come ourselves which is
sitting down with all the
insurance companies
whose job is.
Mrperiod jerem so I appreciate
that and you know i'd point out
that in some of the fires that
that they raise those concerns
about increased costs to uh
their association or or whatever
and I do think having that
dialogue would be uh beneficial
I
you know this this is a tough
issue for me
because I believe in the free
market system and you know we
buy insurance uh to protect us
and and uh people have insurance
for a reason but they also
expect to receive the benefit to
that insurance when when things
happen without having the jump
through too many hoops so III
would encourage you to sit down
with them
I am going to support this to
move on to the next committee
but i'm sure mr more and there
shows and others will be talking
to me as the progressive of
those discussions and and uh I
hope you will linda near to him
and try to address some of their
concerns thank you mister.
Help mediate
thank you
okay senator hickey we're going
to go to you now but if you
could try to keep it.
Focused and
as brief as possible because
it's our the hour is late.
Thank you mister chairman and I
want to thank you after bringing
this bill this is a very
important bill.
And there is no question that
people have difficulty g.
And I think it's admirable that
you're looking at the step
therapy.
But when I graduated from
medical s.
First doctor.
The.
This bills.
But it is fundamentally flawed
in the harm that it will cost to
a number of people.
I am so gratified that as a
doctor you think that I am all
knowing.
All powerful.
And know every drug that's
coming out.
And all the side effects in you
only have to watch.
The news channels in ce all the
side effects I mean that
basically there are smart by
these new drugs coming out and
i'm again flattered that you
think that I as a physician have
all that knowledge and that i've
kept up with it
everywhere and and I know you're
shaking your head
some people come to me for
advice in and I said I stopped
tractors in.
I am not current.
And as much as we all want to
idealize a relationship with our
caregiver.
And as you called it.
The senate river sold sacrifice
some like with the priest in
confession.
But.
Doctors available.
Priests are falling.
I only need to remind you of
what has happened with the.
Pedia file issues in the church
they are not sacrificing those
individuals.
I also want to remind you of the
opined prices.
What happened in the upper york
prices some drug companies came
along and said their axication
was besting since I spread.
And dentists and orthopons and
practically everyone said oh
yeah
cotton for everyone.
In.
We addicted I don't know what
percent of the popular it's
overwhelming and phenomenal in
people's lives are ruined but
their doctors prescribe those
drugs.
And cause major harm and that is
what I fear is going on.
With this deal rushing it
through.
Without.
Focused.
What clinicians should be
prescribing more.
I will take you back to my metal
health parity bill.
I very purposely purposefully
exclude it.
Metal health drugs.
From no step there.
I did put addicted addiction
drugs
no barriers no stepped
specifically it's in the bill
because they're all well known
and they can be prescribed
basically the objection drugs
almost by anyone and so that
makes sense but the mental
health therapy.
These drugs are changing
increasingly rapidly.
And in many ways I would hate to
see someone who has an empathy
with the situation prescribing
the latest drug rap who came by
with some new scheduled frank
drug and they may not even they
may think oh yeah they got
schizoy disorder disorder and
that's good supreme court.
We don't we are not all knowing
we are not all perfect.
But basically what this bill
does it allows anyone with
prescriptive authority unless
look at anyone with prescriptive
authority.
Doctors.
Nurse practitioners.
Who would all to respect to a
great job but they don't have
the years and years of training.
Physicians assistance device.
They all can prescribe the
structure and I heard of a
decision.
Recently prescribing in their
mean authority hello.
The.
They see the the patient asked
and for you not wait patients
are watching these commercials
and say I got that I need I want
to go via me personally I want
that drug
to lose my fifteen pounds really
cool.
The fact is wegovia does come
beside effects and again think
back they they say it really
fast in the commercials but
there are tons of side of.
And those have to be considered
and I don't know any physician
practicing in this state who is
keeping up with a side effects
of all the drugs that they have
access and can prescribe and in
doing so they will cause her.
And again they list all those
side effects that will cause
harm.
Again I go back to my own.
First physician.
Do know how.
I want to spill but I want it
sort through and it isn't just
with the insurance companies I
mean I i.
Yeah we talked about credentials
so i've got answers.
I'm a doctor I went to the one
of the top residencies in the
country.
And practice for many years I
taught at you and am I round the
fact the practice that you are
now I then started insurance
company under the coa.
And I know insurance companies
inside now I I led the medicare
and medicaid division of
excellent blue cross.
With a multi billion dollar
budget.
So I i've got some pretty good
insight to this and then the
health plan I started here new
mexico health connections and
true out.
Work did everything they could
and I and because it was my
accountability responsibility I
was sure and i'm i'm you know
most of the help plans I think
are very dedicated to pharmacy
and therapeutics committees were
the ones who make the decisions
a about what to effications and
yes many of them are housed in.
I don't like in pbs.
But they are very well thought
through now they do
unfortunately make decisions
about which of a class of drugs
are going to buy and they have
this rebate scheme and it's a
scam and we're all paying for it
and it definitely needs to be
reformed.
I miser chairman use the money
that you got this last year
sixty thousand dollars to engage
too research folks to look at
how we how do we stop the pbms
from taking the unnecessary
money drug costs and going from
seventeen to twenty three
percent in the last few years of
of health care and allowed it is
because of that but that whole
ski matter while it needs to be
reformed and why I brought them
in and as their paper is due to
day at midnight and i'll be
sending it to you it's dance
i've seen that there are lots of
good suggestions and i've the
reason I had a commission is
that I knew that in twenty five
in a long session we would come
forward with how to get how to
stop the pbm's from the.
The.
Maries.
I caught in appropriate way that
money is is brilliant and
through the mechanism said the
exercise
and but in the process I also
think we want to be sure that as
we're doing this we're doing it
safely.
You identified for conditions.
The.
No I think it's for three.
Or
therefore.
Look in the bill I believe
therefore I don't have it right
in front of me.
There.
Yeah.
The other already in existing
laws only the underlined that is
new language right so
right so so the other that's
that's a problem I have I mean
how did those conditions get
chosen was that a rational issue
what is the most expensive
disease.
In america.
The.
No
hurt.
They're not mentioned most
expensive what are people die
mostly from in the united
states.
Until we're not prioritizing
where the bank through the
buckets in this bill
and I know you can okay we'll
add that
but still I go back to the
safety concerns that you are
having people who don't have
specialized education or
expertise to have access to any
drug and rid and it happens as
it happened in the.
What I am hoping is that we can.
Take what work has been done
here and by the way I want to
comment.
Senator stepanics were
incredible stepped therapy bill
that was written in a number i'm
it's a really good bill mid
seventy two hours and and you
did hear that you know you have
to have medical doctors denying
stuff I mean there may be there
was a lot of crap going on back
in the past I understand that
but there's less than less of it
is regulated today and I think
that someone who needs to get on
a drug with a seventy two hour
and if you don't you know you
don't come back and you have the
appeal mechanisms within there
and you can go beyond in terms
of appeals as well yes it's it's
a it's a pain but when I would
really like to see is that you
do and you have the mechanism
and
be able to get to a drug and I
would like people not to have to
go through as much but I think
it has to be carefully thought
out and so my main objection to
this bill is that it hasn't had
the time to be valid and it's
not just betting it with the
insurance company that's one
part of it it's betting it with
the medical specialties in the
state in the different areas and
how do we have certain classes
of drugs they can be rapidly
approved or not have so much of
a a delay particularly when
we're doing pharmacy and
therapeutics committee this is
really complicated stuff this is
not simple
right I i've got it issue and
and you were very eloquent
senator in your jury
presentation or whatever you
have his in your laws and i'm
taking notes I hope to be as
skilled as you someday but this
is not in individual emotional
type of issue this is something
that we need to get done but we
need.
And this is too wrap it and you
will never in the two weeks that
are left be able to bring in
medical special against it isn't
so much the insurance company
it's a medical specialties about
who should be prescribing the
drugs and we need to save guard.
All of our potential patience in
the state literally the state.
From getting prescribed the
wrong drugs and it happens all
the time.
It happens all the time and
these drugs do have side effects
in the people who are
prescribing him should be very
knowledgeable the drug drug
interaction.
That some of these new drugs
that we all want to get our
hands on we're watching in the
new shows every night we want
that draw.
But the drug drug interactions
that can happen out of that need
to be carefully thought through
by people who are highly
schooled in that area.
So.
I.
I.
You know.
I'm gonna vote where i'm going
to vote because I I have my and
and I and anyone votes anywhere
that's not your stick and you
you vote is you think you need
to both.
But I really believe the
potential for harm here is
amounts.
And I wish I had other
conditions.
Other than with health plans and
i'm sure that doctor is very
skilled the other conditions in
your telling you the dangers.
Of this bill and yes there are
stories where the that the the
conditions are frustrated and
because they have to go through
a process
in order to get it approved but
at the end of that process these
drugs have been valid and they
dear there really are major
safety concerns that we're gonna
wipe out.
By allowing anyone to cart
blanche order any drug they want
with this bill.
And that will cause her.
That will cost her.
And i.
I cannot in good conscience.
Endorse this build the way I
endorse the direction and
endorse the.
I want to get it through so that
it is much easier but I want it
done carefully.
And I don't want to cause harm
in the process.
Okay just
i'm sorry just a couple other
things that I think is really
important to point out the cost
of drugs.
People who get on a branch plan
they have a six seven thousand
dollar deductible now.
If the doctor prescribes the
drugs that is not on that health
plans for me.
Then.
It'll be a drug that they have
to pay the full market price
for.
That's huge some of these drugs
are three to four thousand a
month in their market price and
not making excuses that for them
to be able to price that high
but that patient will start on
the drug love it in then two
months later they're done.
Because the reductibles and
that's the other thing this
lifetime thing and holding
health care plan
administrators accountable I
mean if they go to a different
health plan what authority does
the old plan administrator
I don't get that it's just it's
a destinate and and so I think
that you're going to end up in
court as as minnesota did as
they tried to do something like
this.
And I would rather solve this.
Sitting down bringing the
medical expertise necessary.
To write this bill is complex as
it would be.
In the areas of cardiology in
the areas of immediately and
a diabetes and an affinished
with this mister too last thing
the other side
god bless you you've got three
seven vacant positions so the
ability to enforce this is going
to be really difficult for them
they have very few examiners
almost no health plan
examiners and so for them to go
in and and actually do an exam
is going to be very difficult
and I don't want to put that
kind of pressure on him in this
next year I would be sure that
we're getting those positions
funded to be able to go in and
do rational examples.
But the other thing is that and
so this is not personal but I
just want to point it out the
mental health peace.
I I said very specifically in my
bill I won't step there.
Because of the expertise.
I did away with it.
In a d.
And so I I urge you colleagues.
Not in need your reactor this
and and we do very often
emotional stories are very very
powerful i've got mine I often
use the stories of my kids in
their addiction to relate to all
of you because we all know we
have it in our family and
they're very powerful.
In addiction was horrible.
But.
The.
We'd need to bring common sense
and we need to bring expertise
to the table to move this bill
forward and that's going to take
a year and i'm begging you in
the interest of the patient
safety that that we all want to
see.
To not do this build this year
but to bring the appropriate
people together and i'll
participate i've got this major
research pbm bill that this
would fit into but it's gonna
take a throughout the interim to
figure out how to write a bill
to a increase the access as you
all want to do and and without
the without the difficulties
the physicians in the patients
are experiencing but this is not
just something you do simply
overnight and so
I I will I am going to be voting
no.
On this bill and I urge my
colleagues up here not to have
an emotional reaction but to
have a common sense reaction and
reject this bill at this time.
And come back and then those of
you who want to join me and
commit to work with
vanessa and and others and
the sponsor of the bill work
with you to put a much better
bill that keeps patience safe.
During the year put it together
for n.
Thank you mr chair while the
senator was speaking
we decided that I would work
with highly.
Some physicians with a high
expertise in some of these areas
of who are ready to do that and
that center I be sort of would
work with the insurance
companies so if this if this
bill moves on we will have
serious negotiations and serious
consultation with medical
providers who are in practice
and our specialist.
Yes we don't miss
absolutely mister chair may I
respond to that I i'm not asking
for a response i'm just saying
that we will take your
recommendations and we will look
at experts or we will consult
with experts.
III understand i'm trying to
save people from uninten.
It
it it
did get your point when they
when the insurance companies
were seeing that it was getting
large it did not and then it was
well on its way and III that.
Well intention and and again
they didn't have the facts it's
really important and I just I do
not believe that in two weeks
you can write the type of
guidelines that are needed in
these specially areas and in
these particular areas there is
a great potential to do harm and
that that's you know I I believe
practicing physician for a long
time you're starting we're
starting to repeat ourselves
said if you're told me followed
by center to my stuff.
The.
No no masters
is yielding to you thank you
thank you mister chairman thank
you centers to up on extra
result thank you I am
before I get to my colleagues
remarks the medicine make a few
points one is the um.
I'm pretty sure I got what you
are saying the seller mister
chairman when you were talking
about knowing the governor
knowing a center or whatever
that you're just describing how
empowered you are you're not
suggesting that the governor or
a center helped you get your
medication correct evidence
that's absolutely correct in
fact I didn't.
And I didn't as was just
mentioned was turning I I don't
participate I don't know how to
do that
I don't know how to fight the
insurance companies but i'm
grateful that's and I was there
and and benefit do know how to
fight them.
Because
and then I bet I listen
incredibly attention to the
doctor in that it's a school of
a citizen legilator as someone
bringing their their their
profession into the the dialogue
but III didn't quite.
I was in persuaded
because it seems to me mister
chairman center hickey that you.
On all new drugs to be
prescribed by committee.
Because the insurance company
when they denied the
prescription then deny the drug.
They didn't put a block on the
drug mister chairman didn't they
hold the phone that this drug
could cause harm we're going to
do not you access to this drug.
They just said we are gonna pay
for it.
And so
step there doesn't you the
concerns the doctor he get laid
out don't.
Don't pan out if you have the
cash.
So these and I don't know how it
works and how works but I think
these insurance companies
are looking at an economic
interest not at a health
interest when denying these
prescriptions.
So maybe we can do a bill over
new drugs that come on the
market that that aren't fully
better or prescribed by
committee but I don't believe
this
did this law already exists
mister chairman
and an and let me get to the
substip cause I know it is it's
not too cool to drop a
substitute right before the
committee with fifteen days to
go appreciate what's focusing
but actually the substitute is
much better to read as the
original bill mischairman center
is the bonnet center I was a
though has new material it
deletes sections and puts new
materials you don't know what's
really new but the the
substitute doesn't do that the
substitute keeps the sections in
the bill and then just adds
what's what's changed so I want
to thank up centers the products
for working diligently with the
bill dropped her center we saw
though because because that the
the substitutes incredibly
easier to read and incredibly
easier to understand so warner
creating love mister chairman
we're not changing the game.
We're just adding.
We're just adding elements.
Under current law mister
chairman center steronics if if
someone has a substance use
disorder.
They don't need this bill
correct.
That is correct and for all of
these is based on a medical.
That's what's already that's
what i'm offer so to the boats
who already benefit from this
existing law that have a
substance used to sort out
you're just including folks who
have an auto amundence order.
Behave your health condition or
or cancer.
And so and also with regards to.
You know i.
Try to criticize bills on the
text of the bill.
When you start suggesting it's
too fast or need your when you
start suggesting those things
that that probably means that
you can really criticize the
words on the page we have this
ridiculous mister chairman
thirty days session that is out
of the eighteen eighties
you know and you have to get a
governor's executive message no
dispected this governor any
governor but it's ridiculous
that legislature has as
permission from the executive to
enter this legislation.
But but we have an executive
message that the governor's
committed to this governor
understands the importance of
this and there wasn't a lot of
executive messages plotting
around but this is important to
the governor and I think that
they give tremendous credibility
to this endeavour.
And and we just got to do the
best we can in thirty days if
this were to be come up mister
chairman.
Since the punics it wouldn't
really check in till january
first anyway correct.
They wouldn't affect existing
plans correct
mr chair it would come into
place january first twenty
twenty five so if I bought a
plan was german on new year's
eve that plan wouldn't be
affected by this bill i'd have
to buy a a plan in january of
twenty five.
It'll be a plan that just
delivered issue for delivery or
renewed okay I think thank you
mister thank you sir he said the
so I could I could go online
change my planner
you know not do anything and get
the same plan that kicks in
january one so in other words of
this this process wouldn't be
available the folks until
january january.
There's there's time for the
shows right right and so it's
kind of like a delayed
implementation and then what
happens two weeks after january
one we're back here in session
so so we can be working on
legislation in the interim.
And improve on this on this bill
but to me I might actually
actually again step there fee.
III think
I think that
you know I mean england went to
a national plan in a nineteen
forty eight
I don't think we'll get there in
this country by twenty forty so
what that that's how behind the
times this country is but the
massachusetts plan became the
affordable caract.
And the key to that plan was
that everybody has to get
insurers that if you spread
spread the cast.
You can lower costs for
everybody and so I get the point
that the gentleman made the
insurance pull in the state is
so small it doesn't do that as
well as we would want it to do
so I would ask the super dentive
insurance to look at these
numbers there's no numbers of
numbers to look at between now
in december but maybe ask
itself.
How many prior us were denied or
whatever come up with some
numbers how much is the
insurance cost going to go up if
any and is that in the interest
of our constituents because
you can't.
You can't go to the crabstable
bed on red thirteen and then
that guys as one or no you're
not allowed to be on that square
case if we lose it with a payout
is more you know me like words
insurance companies when they
operate plant should be for
everything under the sun and you
pay a courtingly.
You know you can't buy insurance
over you don't get this drug
because you know it's going to
cost us money on the margin so
so anyway my point is we got to
be cognizing of rates going up.
And be sensitive to that
situation are and then make us
make an informed decision at
that time but.
But these elements that are
added mister these ailments are
no joke and
and perhaps somebody you know.
The.
I'd be sitting to see how many
people actually succeed in in
the last five years I mean this
bill at the time was awesome but
after seeing.
The hearing these two stories
that the current legislation
doesn't play out.
But but the new language I think
I think does the trexor anyway I
think it's I think it's worth
doing I think it's a step
forward and.
And then we could work on this
concept.
In the interim and hopefully the
federal government will.
You know disincentivised.
The.
And get the incentives right
with our store healthcare system
because it because markets have
don't apply to to the old
doctors to medicine and things
of that nature to to have a
healthy healthy community thank
you mister
thank you senator masters and
last on our list is senator
tomorrow.
Bill forward just follow up and.
Yeah.
They just kept.
Denying you and then because of
your persistence.
He got the drug exact correct no
let's clarify that.
Ah
the salary at her drug.
I never did you never did I
never did I am I been called the
lobbyist or that insurance
company because i'm a senator
and I took advantage of that
situation I still didn't get
so what I mean
in my experience
that the step therapy not for
one of these conditions but
because of that earlier bill
required me to go through the
different steps my roommate just
just was in rage and dealt with
the insurance company and got
nowhere then dealt with the
superintendent of insurance not
nowhere and that's what was the
message behind the original step
therapy bill not only for me but
for many different groups that
came forward there were like
fifteen twenty groups but they
want you to go through the first
level the second level and not
just for like a day or a week
they want you to be honest for
three to six months to prove
that it doesn't work well I
remember you had a bill
september two or three years ago
you had
witnesses in here right
here
because they
insurance company wouldn't.
That's correct
the underlying sections in this
bill is new language the rest of
the bill is the original step
therapy bill.
This bill identifies those three
conditions.
And provides a lifetime
perspective for these drugs so
that these individuals cannot be
denied when they urge change
insurance companies or.
And just to make the point that
there messages make it about
this isn't my health is about
money.
Well is that is that so I
ultimately was never able to get
the drug.
That was being preferred by my
doctor my doctor ultimately
found a different drug which was
also denied by my insurance
company but through good iraq's
I could pay for cash.
At a cheaper rate at the at the.
Using a good arts coupon at the
pharmacy because at the end of
the day what they were blocking
wasn't me getting the drive they
were blocking but
sorry if you had to rather be
yes he thought about money.
At the end of the day that was
about the money it wasn't about
my health
I can move on because it's it's
like just one of four
again and that is senator my
house this is absolutely right
these three day sessions are are
disaster and it is too short
actually really there like
twenty day sessions when you get
down to it because we don't work
up every weekend then the first
week is a waste we don't hear
any bills is only so really
talking about twenty two day
maybe a twenty three day session
is ridiculous
and then you have to wait a
whole year.
It is situation like this.
They want to some people with
good attention one as to wait a
year so in the meantime people
have to uh
suffer debilitating
circumstances and suffer for
another year because
we're only meet once a year for
twenty two days
and that every other evening
number years and in the meantime
the science
life is moving life that the
fast moving world it we're not
keeping up with it because more
meeting for a short period of
time it's ridiculous.
So finally
so deceptive clarification so.
Are you gonna be gonna put in
writing and this build if it
isn't already that you're going
to consult with experts
now what I said missed your
chair members of the committee
is if this bill most forward
before we go to the next bill.
I
was sorry next committee I will
consult with medical experts
plural and these particular
fields and centered I be so will
try to negotiate with the
insurance companies a post to
see if there's changes in
language so I would bring back
changes
I would bring them I would bring
back changes related to the
medical language he would bring
back changes that might be their
needs thank you for getting one
less comment saring ivor it says
he
supports free market wife
support to free market system
but not for health and any
service or good that everybody's
entirely too free market doesn't
work that's why we don't have
the private sector running
libraries please departments in
fire departments because it
wouldn't be able to make any
money but so health care was
something that everybody has a
right to it's not working
and in my world we would even
have insurance companies we have
a
single payer so I could go in
and out but the hours late we
got to move on to god I kind of
build my here so effort
listening to me if some people
might vote against my building
because
you just realize the.
With that with that than in
conclusion we will now see what
the committee wants to do
about this bill is there emotion
with emotion
yeah I moved I do not ask for.
Any discussion.
The.
We have heard all the passion or
the emotion of the rational well
the smoke.
Well when last passion is
in your discussions.
Let's with a health plans if
there's some way that we can see
how inappropriate prescribing
his armed people and come back
with some data and that cause it
act as you you have to face that
part of it as well yet I mean
you really do and and and it can
be weighing and I get that but
the the potential for harm in
this bill mister chair.
Is very significant as well as
major cost issues for people
predicted the brands plan which
is the most popular plan.
The secretary will call the rule
nope center he give up snow
center master yes
yes.
Yes.
Yes in a brief explanation.
Yes they don't have an
information
yes and the list go for
explanation
I would in the senator video
opens but not just
thank you mister chair
I voted yes because I think the
dialogue needs to continue but I
don't think center hickey needs
to feel like he takes a back
seat to center arriving sodo on
anything you were very
personally and so I think having
those discussions and I hope
i've not just discussions the
next couple days but I think
your long term solution needs to
be
part of this saying am I made
some suggestions to the senators
well thank you senator said the
olympics thank you I voted yes
and this is just another
opportunity to prove to point
out the failures of our current
system and why we need medicare
for all thank you mister
president thank you very sanders
thank you michael members of the
committee of the final italian
good if I voted seven in the
affirmative one in the negative
you have to do fast very much
and it also mister just to
mention to the committee the
medical director from blue cross
brush health who came and test
but I guess about her just
reading
is our
own
sector designate of information
technology russia summed up a
summer number okay and doesn't
read service to the state of
mexico
good all right center to
tomorrow and your bill and then
I will carry the less bill for
senator goods all.
Yeah.
One forty nine to behave your
house facilities fund act.
Go ahead senator we're already
for you.
The.
Thank you mister chairman
members of the
council
briefly read reiterate with.
Has this better yeah
okay well.
The hours late will try and
exploit this and a bill one
forty nine
tracy behavior health facilities
fun.
It's this is not a typical
appropriation to this one.
With the used over ten.
The five or ten year period.
The provider.
Grants to plan and purchase
renovator construct behavior
health.
Treatment facilities.
Not only do we have a shortage
of treatment facilities but we
also have a shortage of
providers and correct me if I am
wrong senator or t p which
you're sponsoring a bill to
provide money for education and
expand the full so that I go
companion bill.
So we're really in a crisis I
don't use that we're likely some
people everything's a crisis but
really as far as behavior are
health.
But thanks for that
so it's
it's up your crisis in our
actually in in new mexico.
Forty two percent of people are
getting.
Of the care that they need and
what so that's almost six out of
ten people are not getting every
health care even only need it
and they want it we only have
five treatments the stories then
the mexico a lot of folks have
to go out out of state.
As we all know new mexico next
number one and alcohol related
destinative top five and suicide
and there is a connection you
know people who die from over
you said alcohol met suicide.
Oh could have.
Maybe as that suffered so much
if they've had if there had
been.
Treatment readily available.
Are new mexico.
Over the last two decades.
Our suicide rate is one and I
have to two times higher than
the national national rate.
And according to the
national organization called
community behavioral health
research council.
They are found at one point two.
One million two hundred and
forty thousand new mexicans.
Do not have access.
To adequate mental health care.
The.
So.
The said before we only have
five facilities this
bill narrowly provide money for
construction but it will.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Suggesting wearing that only
and.
Health care about an education.
Infrastructure believe or not in
two thousand four seventy lopes
past the bill to provide money
to do a strategic plan it was
never done.
Last year the state that a plan.
It was so bad that they didn't
want my understanding is they
wouldn't release it to the
public.
This bill provides the strategic
planning.
Not only on a statewide basis.
But in eight different counties.
The.
Also have a higher institution
of higher learning that could be
a community college so I was a
regularly the usual suspects
like.
Ascruces cars bad farming.
We have people working in
silence.
Not even the city of alba
crookie and county of that third
only or working together.
Um it's just a claim is so
so important as I said we
thought along history and I stay
of not doing that
in fact I did it I bet in it was
published in the journal in
october last year.
As stating
the so that we have a long
history not doing strategic
planning.
So
I have a expert witness with me
unpaid lobbyist who was a
citizen advocate who was a very
very knowledgeable about this
issue and she's heard that
working very hard and this
for years as tarted.
Literally hundreds of people and
you are.
Add something.
It's kind of.
They didn't forget that got her
name and I said everything
better than
i'm sorry
thank you sent can you hear me
all right is it on yes can you
hear me now you're gonna have to
project a little bit more can
you hear me now
okay a better stay still um
thank you chairman members of
this committee we were just here
last week with thus b twenty
three this is a bill that will
combine efforts with with that
bill as senator tom and said
along with senator rotisan spill
which will compliment educating
students at our own universities
to pipeline them into the
treatment facilities providing
good jobs for those students
retaining them in the state and
helping us build a regional
center i'd like to acknowledge
two people on the line doctor
know a pain or davis from you
and am his a professor he'll be
talking as well as mair caught
from hopes
I wanted to sprively say this
bill sp one forty nine I want to
acknowledge everyone in this
committee who has ever attended
one of our assumed meetings
which everyone has senator my
estus was that I assume hittings
about three years ago senator
internationally allocus has been
in meetings with patrick alan
last year and brent and senator
talmin of course senator
artising pena has been all of
our meetings and others that are
just new to our meeting scrape
neighbor and I have had many
communications so I acknowledged
people that aren't in the room
who were very instrumental in
helping us to develop the spill
namely bower or a state public
defender has told us what they
need i'm casey kirk is the
social work director for the
public defender our own district
attorney some bragman came in
term meeting soon after he was
appointed and said he was all in
we've had nick bocus who is now
our director of hst.
We've talked to her carrier meho
senator tomorrow
did a talk to the governor's
office and and we do have a a.
Basically a report card from hs
which in july will become the
health authority
should we go hidden here from
the
doctor david fader yes
that would be fine and if there
is any further questions I can
delineate on that thank you.
Could evening mister chairman
and members of the committee
it's going to see everybody my
name is no a pain or david simon
professor in the sociology and
criminality department with the
secondary appointments in the
behavioral sciences division at
unm I study practices to
redirect youth and young adults
from the legal system who have
substance user mental health
challenges in the treatment
services and primarily work in
the first district with the
first district attorney's office
which covers los alamo santa fe
and real riber i'm also the
undergraduate directorate you
and am's sociology and
criminality department i'm not
an expert on legislation on or
on every aspect of the bill that
I wanted to provide some
insights said of the group can
make more informed decisions at
substance used to mental health
challenges have long been dealt
with by the criminal legal
system and often not effectively
leading to many consequences
there's also dramatic salary as
the senator as senator tolman
said a cross
sectors have society including
across the admiral health and
across fields i'm in the
criminality and sociology
department we hardly ever talk
to the public health people
across on hfc to help sciences
center these silos or major
issues that prevent an
improviding better health care
and public safety to our
citizens there is a few things
that I really like about the
bill first is that counties can
apply for these funds and that
their applications will be
evaluated based on criteria
which are based on evidence
based practices based on this
appointment intercept model the
sequential intercept model
describes how individuals were
substantial settlemental health
challenges encountered their
criminal legal system it helps
redirect them into treatment and
it helps identify resources and
service gaps with in the
community evidence repeatedly
suggests that this model helps
reduce horrible substance use.
And mitigate deliterous
consequences of criminal legal
system involvement.
It's also system focused this
equation intercept model it
encourages collaborations which
is something that really needs
to be done to improve behavioral
health and public safety in new
mexico war collaborations across
our sideload sectors including
across nonprofit organizations
health care and our universities
are not an expert on regional
approaches but I do what I do
know that for my work with the
first district that there's
tremendous inequalities across
the counties in the first
district and a tremendous
difference is in the ability of
citizens throughout those
counties to access care a
regional approach
can offer can help address some
of those inequities by drawing
on resources are more well
resourced areas it can also
regional approaches can be a way
that you build towards more
comprehensive care you can place
placer place facility in a
region and strategically start
growing from there one of the
things I like most about the
bill and I know there's some I
think still being refined about
it is that the research practice
partnerships trying to get the
universities more involved so
that we can create a behavioral
health work force and research
practice partnerships that are
so that our universities can
start providing more value to
the communities they serve and
then last I think there's a lot
of synergy here with this bill
and some of the other bills
including mister chairman your
bill which looks to develop work
force
so those are some of my thoughts
thank you for the time thank you
doctor and then we have mayor
cub from hubs.
Good evening everyone mister
chairman members of the
committee
thanks for the opportunity for
us to talk to you about our
story
if you give me about one minute
up I want to give you some
background where we are in our
community
I became mayor about thirteen
years ago and one of the things
that our community wanted us to
address was first of all housing
and we have effectively done
that the second thing was health
care and so a partnership with a
normally hospital district which
is one of the premier hospital
primary care providers in the
state
we were able to address those
issues and then we looked
especially care and covered at
hospital which is based in love
up texas which is the premier
specially care provider in our
area and they are part of the
saint joseph healthcare
organization with us the
country's largest private
nonprofit health care provider
we had mutual discussions with
them about
them becoming part of our
community they made a decision
to build a new hospital in hobs.
Which they did and went when we
announced that.
Our existing hospital provider
columbia health services which
had the existing facility
decided they wanted out of the
market and so they called
cabinet and said.
We want to sell our existing
facility to you we do not want
to compete with you for health
care services in the market so
can it call me.
And said.
We have this opportunity to buy
the facility which was at two
hundred thousand square foot one
hundred bad acute care facility
fully a credited that was
serving the public and so.
Two of us the sea of hobbs in
the jay of madix foundations
were just the second largest
private foundation of state we
came together to put together
and incentive program for them
to continue to build a new
hospital in hobs which says
cover that spend about a hundred
twenty million dollars and as a
result of that that left a two
hundred thousand square foot one
hundred bed fully credited
hospital they could as of
september twenty twenty two.
So.
The city of hobs and our
commission.
Took that challenge to try to
address the behavioral health
gaps in our community we engaged
a nationally known architectural
firm to look at themselves what
it would take to
repurpose it for behavioral
health based on the miami dade
model which the gentleman
previously talked about whereby
individuals that.
Our ems in our law enforcement
community engaged on a daily
basis and not taken to the
emergency room in the hospital
but take him to another facility
whereby they could be properly
treated by professionals in the
in behavioral health and so we
have done that we spent approx
me hundred thousand dollars on
the repurposing of the facility
you need to understand that this
facility was a hundred bay at a
cute care facility fully
credited for emergency care all
those gains so
the current plan we have is too
have two.
Yeah.
Entries into our emergency care
one would be for adults the
other would be for at lessons
where they are properly
segregated and then based on the
evaluation this done based on it
miami dade model.
Those individuals would either
be.
Put into
behavioral health for outpatient
purposes or they could be put in
to behavioral health for
impatient purposes I think it's
an important for this committee
to understand that.
This is something that our
community cares about and so.
We are going to miami date to
study their program the first
week of march in here of the
attendees the chief of police of
the hob least department
that under sheriff of blee
county sheriff's department
a representative from the fifth
judicial district district
attorney's office a
representative from.
They fit judicial district
public defender's office.
The jay of madix foundation
which is interesting funding.
Myself as a serious hobs.
We have also had we have some
local legislators and interested
in doing that and so we believe
that this bill would give us the
opportunity to address the
behavioral issues that are
community is experiencing as
well as the rest of the state
because we've I think over the
years we've proven.
Then in carceration of
individuals that have.
Either sacred logical issues or
where they have issues related
to drug and alcohol addiction
incarceration.
It's not the solution
intervention is the solution and
so I want you your committee
mister chairman and you're
committed to know how committed
are community ears to repurpose
this facility also another as we
had this discussion another
representative will be a
representative of remember
junior college which has one of
the most outstanding nursing
programs in our state and in the
country and they are looking at
changing their curriculum to
provide behavioral health as
part of their curriculum.
For nurses in the program
because.
The building without the people
to properly administrate.
Will not be successful and we
understand that.
But I would encourage this
committee to.
Seriously consider.
The proving this bill to move
forward so that we can not only
for our local community but for
the state.
For us to take an aggressive and
positive stance.
To address the behavioral health
issues in our communities.
Thank you very much mayor cub
appreciate your input members of
the connection questions in the
committee.
Anybody here in the
ebay here in the audience that
wants to speak

members of the committee senator
neighborhood

center for bringing this and
connecting I know that this is a
malta year project for you and I
appreciate not only bringing a
fourth but but you spent a lot
of your own money and the lot of
your own time to to go see miami
dave and see how that works and
and you know as I see it we have
no choice but to go down this
path
every community in the state of
suffering from.
An increasing population that
is.
Presenting challenges for the
cities in the counties and we
need to have some.
I think you're proposing some
regional centers that will
address the
mental health issues and I see
that in the bill that uh
behavioral health includes the
the metal health component so
i'm really pleased to see that
and I wish you the greatest
success in their son are fully
supported thank you mister chair

move and and just need a little
bit extra support there so
they've done tons of work ahead
of time and
offered proud of the guys down
there in in in my district so I
I think both of your districts
have already started down this
past initiative so it's really I
think it's something that really
has great potential yes possible

pass from senator neighborhood

like for did you pay back
this reference earlier the app
but in all seriousness I think
this is really a good bill and
needs to go forward thank you
it's great thank you carney
thank you very much.
Less bill.
One eighty eight century senator
consolacious bill and he asked
to roll it over and I said my
gosh already rolling over so
many we will just couldn't hear
it but with me today as my
expert witness on this who has
been patiently saying here for
five hours
five and a half hours to hear
what will be a final bill of the
night senate bill when monica
bases the director of the north
central economic development
district and she's one is going
explain that this bill is all
about since senator consolidates
is not here thank you mr
chairman members of the
committee this is a very bland
and
basic bill compared to what
you've heard tonight so i'll
explain it briefly I think the
statute was written in nineteen
seventy three so it proceeds me
a little bit
basically the I mentioned the
other day that we were in here
testifying about the money for
are the growth fund that would
come to the car because I made a
statement to senator neighbor
that we receive a hundred
thousand dollars in base funding
the every year and that is what
this is the state grant to need
is funding that that's been
coming to the cars every year I
guess since nineteen seventy
three apparently and we receive
different amounts dfa decides
the amounts every year but in
the recent history it spend
ninety nine thousand per c we
are required to provide a one
hundred percent on federal match
on those funds with this bill
does is remove the match
requirement and the reason this
is being removed is there's
discussion of increasing this
amount if the amount is
increased like say to two
hundred thousand dollars some of
the cogs could not actually meet
the one hundred percent match
requirement so that's that's the
bill in that shall i'd be glad
to answer any questio.
Anyone they audience
and support of this bill.
Thank you
position.
Hearing one will turn to the
members of the committee first
