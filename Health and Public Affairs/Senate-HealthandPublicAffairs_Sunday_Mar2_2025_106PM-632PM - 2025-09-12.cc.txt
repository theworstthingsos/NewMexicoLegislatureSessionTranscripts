Senor Pinto Senator Scott center
Serio Lopez.
Senator Hickey, Senator Lopez.
here.
We have a quorum.
And there was a carryover from
our meeting on Friday, so
Senator Trujillo, if you would
join us up front.
And this is on Senate Bill 105.
Social work licensure compact.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. Happy
Sunday. I hope you've had a
lovely morning.
Um, nice to see the weather as
sunny as it is.
So I'm here with you with a 3rd
compact.
And I look around and I
recognize that you all have been
here for the 1st 2.
And I suspect that you're
pretty.
Up to speed on compact, so I'm
not gonna.
Thank you.
I'm not going to, um.
Take too much time to go over
it, but I do just want to remind
you that compacts.
Are related or are being
supported by the Department of
Defense, and again, I do want to
thank my co-sponsorenered Lopez
for opening the file and being
very supportive during this.
Um, I'm sure she'll have some
things to say too.
You've got in front of you a
letter that we have a copy of.
For each of you from the
Department of Defense,
expressing their support.
Or compacts, and their reasoning
for again that it's a family
friendly policy that allows
spouses and other family members
to be employed, gainfully
employed almost immediately
upon.
Uh, entering into and taking a
new assignment at a new so
again, the one that we're
hearing today is social work.
And there's a couple of things
about social work that.
Are important for you to know.
The social work licenses are
just like the speech licenses,
they're not being issued yet.
So it's still in the development
phase.
But they do expect the language
in the bill is almost exactly
the same as the other so as the
other compact bills, and again I
will just state that that's
because.
The um NCSL.
And the Department of Defense
have partnered together to get
these drafted.
I know that there's been um.
Uh, uh, amendments, Madam Chair,
I'm not sure if there's an
amendment for this one, I didn't
bring one for, OK, perfect.
So we won't go into that issue,
um, with that, Mr. Madam Chair,
I'm, I'm happy to answer any
questions.
OK, thank you. We'll go to the
audience. Is there anyone here
in support of Senate Bill 105.
And if you are they stand um
here behind the Senator
Trujillo. There's a microphone
if you'd like to introduce
yourself and make your
statement, please.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and
committee members. You all know
I'm Melissa Salzar, director of
boards and commissions at
regulation and licensing.
Um, department to which the
board of Social Work examiner
examiners is administratively
attached.
We do not speak in favor or
against the proposed bill. We
wish only to point out that the
operating budget impact
contained an RFIR of 56,000 was
not included in our current
submitted budget.
Therefore, if the bill is passed
and authorization or
appropriation will need to be
made to allow boards and
commissions division to carry
out the mandate required by the
bill. In addition, if the bill
is passed for requesting an
extension until January 1st,
2026 to apply and obtain
approval to conduct the required
background checks as we
currently do not run background
checks for social work board.
As well as to update the NM plus
licensing system. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Dan Weeks, a
represent uh UNM hospital and uh
uh Bern Leo County given the
workforce, uh, issues with
relative to healthcare workers
and social workers in the state,
we need this compact.
We have a very, very, uh,
significant shortage.
And these compacts definitely
help and especially since we
have so many uh military
installations in the state.
It's very important that those
folks when they get stationed
here,
Uh, their, their spouses or
their family members that are uh
social workers need to be able
to license quickly and be able
to be working here. Thank you.
Thank you. Is there anyone else
in support here in the room?
Is there anyone in opposition?
See none, um, on the web, on
Zoom, we do have.
Adrian Gomez, who is in support
of Senate Bill 105.
Uh, good afternoon, committee.
Good afternoon committee members
and Madam Chair, Adrian Gomez
from the Greater Albuquerque
Chamber of Commerce.
Uh, entering the social work
license or interstate compact
will make it easier for licensed
providers in other states to
treat New Mexicans in person or
in a telehealth setting.
The bill is a real way to get
more New Mexicans the care they
need.
and address our serious lack of
providers. It also helps New
Mexico remain competitive.
The chamber is pleased to
support this bill as it aims to
bring more care to to Mexicans,
and we ask you to vote.
Vote to pass it. Thank you for
your time.
Thank you.
So with that, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Senator Pinto.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
Uh thank you for bringing this
bill forward.
His competency based on passing
the state social work licensure
exam for clinical.
Madam Chair, um, senator, that's
a really good question, and I'm
glad that you're actually asking
it because I wanted to talk on
this subject.
Um, the, uh, ability to practice
in the compact, so to be,
remember, keep in mind that you
can get a state license that
doesn't grant you compact
privileges, which is gonna be
just the same as the license
that you can get today.
Or you can get a compact
privilege which then allows you
to practice in other states.
If you have, um, if you desire
to get the compact privilege,
then you have to have passed the
national social work exam.
And my my my frustration with
the national exam.
Um, and I I I'll just say it, I,
I support this compact, and I
think we need to have the
compact.
But there is concern about the
national exam at the national
level by the national social
work
um organization that the exam
has some bias to it.
Because what's happened is that
minorities have not passed it at
the same level as non-minorities
and so that's a little bit of an
of a of a.
Irk for me, um, but that's the
reality of what you have to do.
And in New Mexico, you at this
time have to pass that exam
also.
So there's no difference between
the compact and what we require
at the state level at this
moment.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
What are the questions on the
state license or exam that
address services contained in
the states in the Indian Family
Protection Act.
Madam Chair, Senator, I have no,
I have no, um, information about
questions that are asked on the
exam examinations are, are
proctored and are kept
confidential, so that's not.
Has there been a review of these
state.
That I could be in this los to
determine compatibility of
service requirements with the
New Mexico state law.
Uh, Madam Chair, senator, um,
our standards for social work.
Um, do, in fact match the
standards for the national.
And Madam Chair, members can be
section 28.
Well, each member state, the
educated.
In the family
In the Indian family Protection
Act.
Be able to determine whether or
not.
A regulated state social worker
is.
biting by a member state's laws,
regulations and applicable
professional standards in the
member state in which a client
is located at the time the care
is rendered.
Um, Madam Chair, um, senator,
good question. The um, the
requirements for the compact
license.
Um, and we talked about this
before, it's the same for social
work.
You must follow and adhere to
the laws of the state that you
practice in and the state that
you practice in isn't or the um
customer that you're serving is
located.
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. Do you understand my
concerns about this.
Because I don't think it will
adequately address state of New
Mexico in particular.
With our
Populations of tribes nation to.
And I was there anything else
besides this done to address the
shortage. Um, Madam Chair,
Senator, we do have expedited
licensure.
And expedited license for.
Um, licensing boards to have a
requirement that upon completion
of an application that they need
to if they're from out of state.
That on completion of a complete
application, then there to be
licensed within 30 days.
The hiccup with that um process
that we've implemented, I think
4 years ago now, is that it's
upon completion of the
application.
And with the compact, your
application is complete once
you're licensed in one state and
you're registered as the compact
than to be a practicing in any
other state is not required to
get the license, so you may
remember the medical board, I
said, you have to get licensed
in each state that you practice
in, but that your information is
housed with the national level.
Social work is a little bit
different.
More like the speech, um,
pathology, and that is that you
are licensed in your home state,
and then you have the privilege
to practice in any other state
that's within the compact.
In that respect, it's the same
as the nursing board.
The nursing board compact is the
exact same philosophy, your're
licensed in one home state, then
you have the opportunity to work
in any other compact state.
Madam Chair, members of I, I
don't really see how there can
be a comparison we talk about
medical.
And nurses first.
Because
Where we are right now with CYFD
and many of the issues that are
circumvented within the
department.
It, it's
They're still having someone
outside of the outside.
But that is not adequately.
some terms.
Mm
Educated.
In IA
Or even have a supervised
clinical experience.
Dealing with our Indian family
Protection Act.
Bring them in, to me it's a
liability.
In which the state
It's frowned upon to create
liability.
And I believe this compact will.
Probably be detrimental to our
tribes nation.
Is that all, Senator?
OK, thank you. Senator Serio
Lopez.
Thank you Madam Chair, um.
My nephew had a social worker
and was doing a master's of
social worker has his therapist
and um she moved.
And of course, this thing about
telehealth, she was not, he was
not able to continue therapy
with her.
So that's one of the reasons I
really support these compacts
because we are short.
Um
Social workers
And if they move,
It's really, really hard on
individuals who abruptly lose.
Um
Lose their therapist, and it's
hard to replace a therapist.
That's just not uh
You don't just kind of get
assigned when and and work it
out, it's.
It's a whole long process, so
that's, that's another reason I
support it. And then I just
wanted to point out, Madam
Chair, that it
Um, what page is it?
I sometimes I get confused with
these uh compacts because we, we
worked on, on so many and I, I
just have to say I've
appreciated learning so much
from the sponsor of this, the
lead sponsor of this, um, about
compacts.
Um
So
It says here,
On page 49. Nothing in the
social work licensure interstate
compact shall prevent.
Or inhibit the enforcement of
any other law of a member state
that is not inconsistent with
the compact, Madam Chair, would
it be inconsistent with the
compact to require an
additional, um,
In order to practice in New
Mexico and it an additional
certification of IPRA.
Uh, wait, it, what is it, Ira.
If
I, what was it, if, uh, the, the
Indian family.
But
Protection Act IFA, um, which
was passed a couple of years
ago, um, because it does, it's
relevant to the work here in New
Mexico, would it be inconsistent
to
You know, I know it'll take a
little while to get this going,
but to pass a law or if the.
If the
Local board passed a regulation
to require some certification or
it doesn't have to be certain
some coursework in if uh.
Um, would it satisfy this?
Or through continuing it or
through continuing education
credits.
Actually, that's probably the
easiest way, isn't it, through
continuing requiring, would that
be inconsistent with the
compact, um, Madam Chair, what
the what the compact requires,
it, it doesn't require you to
take to take continuing
education in each state that
you're gonna practice in, it
requires you to take continuing
education and report that in.
So if someone, if this was their
home state and then they would
be required to have.
Um, you know, if they got
licensed as a home state, um,
our regular license, they would
be required to get that in order
to get the license in the first
place.
But if it's someone that's
outside, then they're not
required to take the courses,
um, the social competency course
cultural competency courses that
are required here for in-state
licensing.
So that is, I, I, I, I
understand the senator's
concerns about that. I
absolutely do.
Um, but I will just point back
to the fact that.
They are required to adhere to
state law and so they are have
a.
Of, of responsibility to learn
what the the standards of
practice in New Mexico are.
And it wouldn't be inconsistent
for us to amend the social work.
Act, the authorizing act to
require that um to practice in
New Mexico, you would have to
be, you would have to take this
or you would have to be
competent in this area, which
could be achieved through.
And, and, and the board, I mean,
we could write the law that says
that that would not be
inconsistent. If we made it a
requirement of practicing in New
Mexico, not a requirement of
licensure.
Uh, Madam Chair, that seems like
a, a good idea, and I know this
isn't going to go into effect
like like that, and so that's
something that we could work on,
um, in the interim.
And, and you having to place by
the time this.
This actually works, because I
think it is a um.
Cultural competence of
Language access.
Um
A really important values in
our, in our multicultural state.
And so I, and I'm happy to to
work with you or with anyone
else on getting that done,
certainly we would uh invite uh
Senator Pinto.
Um
And perhaps if she's interested,
Senator Charlie, who to make
sure that we um.
We can get that in place by the
time this.
This goes into effect.
Um, I strongly support these
compacts again, just because of
the problems we have in our
state with adequate services.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair and thank you, senators
for bringing this to our
attention, and I would be more
than happy to work on that for
the authorizing social work.
Practice Act here in New Mexico.
Thank you, Senator Hickey.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Senator, for bringing
this bill.
Would
The social workers, if they.
Uh, are engaged in.
Uh, behavioral health therapy.
Um, would they be able to do
telehealth this.
Act enables them to undertake
that activity. Um, Madam Chair,
Senator, that is one of the
benefits.
Is that you could in fact, um,
be in another compact state.
And you could in fact provide um
an individual in another in a
different compact state, which
if we enter.
I again, the practice is
considered to be.
Under the the patient.
Um, being treated.
Thank you for that, Madam Chair
and Senator, so this could help,
uh, while we have it, uh, are
significant shortage of
behavioral health therapists
they
and
Are you saying that you would go
back and look at
Our our our lies.
licensing to look at.
Practice
And look at the cultural
sensitivity component of it in
some format, it would help
address those issues.
And, and that would be, uh, I'm
sorry, um.
And and that would be something
we'd see next year, is that
correct, Madam Chair, Senator,
I'm just kind of trying to think
here really quickly and my
intention would be to
immediately leaving this table,
go up and talk to the drafter,
and, um, uh, I don't see any
reason that I couldn't find a
way of amending that in in the
next committee.
So it could be amended it,
Madam Chair. Thank you. Are
there other questions, Senator
Block? Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator.
Um, I, I'd just like to talk
about this letter. Do you have
that in front of you, the DOD
letter from.
The Office of Assistant
Secretary of Defense. Yes. Yes,
madam, I do.
So relatively familiar with this
stuff.
The 25 years serving in the Air
Force, moving around all over
the world.
Um, and some of the issues with
military spouses.
When
When someone PCSs when a family
PCS is to
Holloman
Cannon, Kirtland.
Or even you and them to teach
ROTC or something like that.
And the uh the spouse.
Is license will just say social
work.
Uh, tell me the process that
that spouse has to go through
real quick to um start work in
New Mexico.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. So, um, they
would have to apply for a
license and off the top of my
head, I don't know the exact
requirements, but I do know that
we've got the division director
for the year, um, right here and
I would be happy to bring her up
as an expert witness if you, if,
if you're amenable to that,
Madam Chair.
Madam chair.
May I bring up an expert
witness. Sure. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Uh, director, I know that
you've said you were neither in
favor nor oppose this, this
particular bill, so, um,
When a spouse, um,
PCSs to New Mexico.
This particular case for and
they have a degree in social
work and they might have had.
It might have been practicing in
Um
Well, Hanscom Air Force Base,
Massachusetts.
Right, so they come into New
Mexico from Massachusetts.
And now, tell me what the
process is for that.
Uh, spouse to get licensed in
New Mexico.
OK, madam Chair, I'm Senator
Block Currently, we do offer
military licensing.
To um military regulation and
licensing. So a um.
A person would apply online
through NM plus.
They would be, um.
Granted
Um, authorization to practice,
we usually, we are required to
turn those around within 10
days.
Those um licenses, they are
granted the privilege to license
to practice in the state.
For a period, I believe of I
wanna say it's 3 years. I, I
might be wrong on that, but I
think it is a 3 year period that
they're allowed to practice in
the state at that time when
their renewal comes up, they do
have to show that they have met
all of the requirements that are
needed to practice in the state,
so if, um, an exam, for example,
was required in New Mexico that
wasn't required in
Massachusetts, they would need
to complete that exam.
Before they renew to continue
practicing here.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So
director, I want to make sure I
understand you here, so they
would really have 3 years to
meet the
Continuing education
requirements or what other
certifications they would need
in New Mexico.
Um
To take that exam.
At the 3 year mark when they
started the 3-year mark when
they got their license.
They're, they're little
I want to put it.
When they got kind of fast
tracked because they're
military.
They would have 3 years from the
day they get their license to
take the exam to be
Certified in New Mexico for
another 3 years or is it a
longer time after that. At that
time, um, Madam chair, Senator
Block, they would then fall into
regular licensing, the regular
licensing schedule for the
state.
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair. So
they're one of us then is what
you're telling me, OK.
Um
The Air Force
Has Madam Chair and director.
And I don't know if they're
certified here, but they have
social workers in the medical
group, Emily, uh, family airmen
and family readiness center.
Um, the old family advocacy.
How, how does that work?
Or the social workers that are
doing behavioral health.
On a uh military installation in
the state of New Mexico is the
same rules or not?
Madam Chair, um, senator, so,
um, individuals who are um
serving in the military on an on
a base are exempt from New
Mexico laws. So what the, the
Department of Defense requires
is that they be licensed in one
state.
And then they have the
opportunity of practicing in any
state that they're deployed to
on federal land.
If they, if they practice off of
the base, then that does not,
that doesn't carry over.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. Well, there, they
may not be uniform.
It could be contractors or they
could be civilians. So is your
answer the same then?
OK, perfect. Thank you. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Uh, Senator,
one of the things I
We've had these compacts, and I
really like them because I think
it provides access to New
Mexicans, and we've had this
chat and I think you know where
I'm going with my question on
immunity here.
Um, on page.
By the way, director, thank.
Thanks. I, I don't need you
anymore. That was good. Thanks.
I'm gonna keep her here OK, she
did great, by the way, so.
But I'm done with you for now.
On, on page 32.
Line 8
Uh, kilo or k, Madam Chair, with
respect to qualified immunity,
defense, and indemnification.
No
Good?
You, you got it? OK, perfect.
So,
We keep putting this.
These this in in compact tell,
tell me again, I just want to
read it so
I can understand it one more
time or try to understand why
we're doing this.
With respect to qualified
immunity.
Defense and indemn
indemnification.
The members, officers, executive
director, employees and
representatives of the
commission.
shall be immune from suit and
liability.
Both personally.
And in their official capacity
for any claim for damage to or
loss of property, personal
injury.
Or other civil liability caused
by or arising out of any actual
or alleged act and it goes on
error or omission or anything.
Why, why are we setting aside
the members of the commission in
regards to qualified immunity.
Um, Madam Chair, senator, that's
why I asked it for this. There's
not an amenity, and I was really
prepared because I thought there
was gonna be an amendment, but I
just want to point out, I, uh,
this continues to be added.
Because because of course they
would want to be immune from any
suits.
But I want to point out that I
did some for some really kind of
concise research that I can
share with the committees and
with the members of the Senate,
but I found an excellent article
on the Cato Institute.
And the Cato Institute, as
you're probably aware, is a much
more libertarian, um, not left
uh leaning, but I be aware
because it's libertarian.
So it's a,
it's a fair point I do,
I do. Thank you.
And, and, and the article that
that I found there is qualified
immunity, a legal practical, and
moral failure.
It's a very good article about
why qualified immunity should be
Should be eliminated in every
state and so.
This, the, this judiciary, in
fact, if it's not done in this
committee, it will happen in, in
judiciary and, and I do have the
information here that I got
earlier.
That the two states and I
misspoke about the states,
they're actually Montana and
Alabama.
That have eliminated that
language from their compacts.
And have continued to be.
Within the combat, and that
includes for Alabama did it in
2021 for psychology.
A audiology and speech and then
the.
Thank, thank you for bringing
that up. I truly appreciate
that. um.
Madam Chair, because, well, let
me ask you this, uh, senator.
Did you do any other compact
bills?
Or is it just a social work one?
Did you, or is it another
senator that did a compact bill
related.
But
Madam Chair, I've been the
compact queen. You're the
compact queen? OK,
it is the one with the compacts
in the center I see Senators to
trying to be in a princess to
the.
So
Um
I, I, I really like these
compact laws. Like I said, it
helps out New Mexico, and I
think you and I have chatted and
I, I have not voted for any of
them because of this. Well, let
me ask it this way, can a social
worker
Have qualified immunity.
Madam Chair, Senator, Social
Works.
Social workers do not have
qualified immunity, you and I
don't have qualified immunity.
Perfect.
So, Madam Chair, uh, Senator,
that's exactly why I, I can't
support this bill unless that's
out of there because it treats
people differently.
And
And, and I hope it gets fixed. I
think the others are in
judiciary getting held, but.
I give you my word.
If, if this whole thing here.
From
Line 8
Line 24 is out of the bill.
You have my vote.
I give you my word. You have my
vote on this and on the others.
If those are kicked out.
I'm, I'm all in.
I just don't like it where,
Madam Chair and Senator,
Hey, you, you're protected.
But you're not.
You're protected, but you're
not.
It, it just doesn't
I can't explain that to mom.
As we used to say in the Air
Force, it makes no sense to me.
It's some.
Legal trickery or whatever it
is, I'm just a nuclear weapons
guy, but
That, that's something that
I really, and I appreciate
Senator Pinto's comments too.
But
This
This is the hill to die on in
this bill on these compact bills
for me and um and I know you're
doing.
You're doing some great work on
these things, and I, and I
greatly appreciate it. So.
You don't have my vote today,
but hopefully in Judiciary
Committee that gets fixed and uh
you'll have my vote on the
floor.
Senator Trujillo, thank you for
all your work being the compact
queen.
Um
Very much appreciate you trying
to move the ball forward. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Madam Chair,
Senator, thank you for that with
all due respect, I do believe
that.
Um, the last two that came
through, we took that out and I
lost votes because of it, so
I'm, I'm appreciative that that
you're willing to do that and I
will say that it would not be an
unfriendly amendment, um, to do
that here in committee if
anybody.
Madam Chair.
Not at this time.
Thank you.
Any other questions from
committee?
I move the
I move you. There's a motion for
a due pass from Senator Cynthia
Lopez with the 2nd from Senator
Hickey, but there's still
discussion.
No.
Um
Senator Trujillo on.
The issue with regards to um
The issue I qualified immunity.
Um
Uh
As I was reading through the
bill, I have some concerns.
Um, and I didn't propose an
amendment at this time because I
figured the next committee,
there's a lot more in here that
needs, I think needs a a very
thorough look.
Um, at what is currently in, in
this particular uh proposal.
And I'm sure that they will go
through it, um, even more so
than what we will.
Um
So, just so you know, I don't
like it.
Period.
And it's just, it's just what I
think.
Um, on page 41.
And I, I know there's always.
Exceptions.
But on page 41, line 10.
It does say as except as
otherwise provided in this
compact.
Venue was proper and judicial
proceedings by or against the
commission shall be brought
solely and exclusively.
In a court of competent
jurisdiction where the principal
office of the commission is
located, which is in Washington
DC.
And
But those of us who understand
how you.
Be you. I just talk with my
hands. Um.
The the commission may waive
venue and jurisdictional defense
to the extent that it adopts or
consents to participate in an
alternative dispute resolution
proceeding.
And of course, nothing in the
section shall affect or limit
the selection or propriety of
venue in any action against a
licensee for professional
malpractice, misconduct, or any
similar matter.
So
I, I understand the whole thing
of the venue, but I think for
maybe some of those who may be
watching, could you explain?
how this process would work when
you choose a venue.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and, um,
so another amendment that will
be.
Um, forthcoming in judiciary and
again I, I'm, I was trying to
keep the legal issues, um, over
for judiciary so that I could
try to address them all at one
time and have been working very
closely with attorneys to try to
figure out what do we need to
amend in there, um, but I do
have language to address that
issue, and it would be except as
to judicial proceedings.
For the enforcement of this
compact among member states.
Individuals may pursue judicial
proceedings related to this
compact in any New Mexico state
or federal court that would
otherwise have competent
jurisdiction.
That's language that I already
have.
And I appreciate that because
it's a concern for us to agree
to something that's even here at
this point, gives me.
Thanks.
Just to put it lightly on that.
Um
And some of us, as I say, who've
who've gone through other
legislation before it just a
little points, but.
Um, and then on page 47.
13
It says this compact may be
amended by the member states.
No amendment to this compact
shall become effective and
binding.
Upon any member state.
Until it is enacted into the
laws of all member states.
And Senator, could you explain
that one, please? Yes, um, so
keep in mind that the first
sentence is the defining
sentence, and that is that this
compact may be amended by member
states.
We're not a member state.
We're amending this and again,
and I've said this before that
if they choose not to let us
into the compact, we've done
everything that we possibly can
to get in there. I do have
evidence that other states have
amended their compact, and it's
been applicable and so amending
the compact and making it the
way that we want it for New
Mexico before we get accepted
into the compact is absolutely
crucial for us.
And Senator.
So for consideration purposes,
the states that you mentioned,
Alabama and the other state.
Did they amend the social
workers?
Compact? Is that what you're
referring to?
Madam Chair, uh what I have that
they amended was psychology,
audiology and speech and
physical therapy.
And but keep in mind that.
These compacts are almost.
Exactly regardless of the.
I'm, I I haven't looked at the
nursing one because it was.
Already in place and it has been
drafted years and years ago, but
the Department of Defense and
NCSL has been involved in the
drafting of all these more
recent ones, so they're very
similar.
So then would it hold of?
Any amendment when in
consideration then that the
member states as they're
considering New Mexico's
application.
If they
Decide that we're good, they
will join the compact, then does
the, the next sentence hold
where the other states would
also have to adopt similar.
Um
Laws in their states, if it's
something that's in ours.
Thank you for that question,
Madam Chair. If we amend this
after we're a member in the
compact, then that would be more
likely to hold.
But we're amending this before
we ask permission to join the
compact.
Which means if they accept us
into the compact.
Our statute as written would
hold.
It would be much more difficult
for us if we get accepted into
the compact to then amend it and
think that it would be
applicable. I think that would
be a legal challenge for us.
But if we amend it before we're
accepted and they accept it,
they're accepting our compact as
it's written.
And how many
States are already part of this
compact. I apologize. I didn't
take the notes.
Um, Madam Chair, uh, it took 7
states before the compact could
become.
Um, and actual.
Uh
Compact that could be um
enforceable. I don't have the
numbers for the social work
compact. I found it a little
challenging on their website.
To figure that out. I do have a
list of members that have
participated in it.
Um, but it says.
I, I'm just, I wasn't able to
locate that information.
Salazar, do you have the number?
It appears that there are 7
states that have joined the
compact, but I'm not aware of
which 7 they are, and Madam Char
it's actually more than 7
because 7 is what it took for it
to get over the edge, and I
don't know how many have I just.
We have entered after that.
OK. Just, just a question I
asked on the numbers.
So we don't know.
At this point, maybe by the time
you get into judiciary.
It's to knowing exactly how many
states are part of this compact.
And then how many states have
amended.
There
compact as they have applied to
enter.
I think that would be um some
good information for us to know
too.
Um
So
Yeah
Those are just a few of the
concerns that I had as I was
reading through this compact.
Um
I, I did not propose. I had a
few amendments ready, but I
figured.
You're going over to Judiciary,
and I think they have a few more
things that they're gonna be
going through and
Probably have a committee
substitute that comes out.
With some of the amendments. So.
Um, but those are a couple.
Of my concerns at this point.
Thank you, madam. So that's all
I have.
So that we are on a do pass
motion.
And a 2nd, and if you would call
the roll, please.
In her block.
No
And our boon.
Senator Charlie.
And our Gallegos.
No, ma'am.
And nova, yes, and pinto.
And Scott
Yes
Serio Lopez, yes.
Senator Hickey.
And our love is
No.
by a vote of 5 to 4, you have a
due pass on to the judiciary.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you members of the committee for
your um comments. I really
appreciate them.
OK. Next to move on with Senate
Bill 144.
And I believe Senator Nava.
Oh no, Senator Pinto. I'm sorry,
my bad.
Senator Pinto will be
presenting.
Uh, Senate Bill 144.
And I believe 145 for Senator
Gonzalez.
So we'll start with Senate Bill
144. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
Senate Bill 144, the Affordable
housing Act funding.
Uh, Senator Gonzalez is the.
sponsor.
But this bill makes it one time
appropriation of 500.
I was in
From the general fund to the
Department of Finance to DFA.
For the New Mexico mortgage
finance Authority MFA.
To carry out the provisions of
the Affordable Housing Act.
This bill allows expenditures to
begin in fiscal year.
2026 in his non-reverting.
And
In
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair and
thank you, Senator Pinto for
stepping in and, uh, uh, for
Senator Gonzalez and for your
support.
Um, good afternoon, uh,
committee members, uh, Amisidoro
Hernandez, I'm the executive
director and CEO of Housing New
Mexico. He recently rebranded
from the mortgage Finance
Authority or MFA. We believe it
better describes uh what we do
as an organization.
I realized we have some new
members here, so I would like to
take just a minute to give you
an overview of uh of housing in
Mexico if that's OK with you. I
shouldn't take too long.
MFA, as you all know us, uh, was
created in 1975 in June of this
year, we'll complete our 50th
anniversary.
Initially we were created a very
narrow focus to provide a loans
to first-time home buyers.
we were given the authority and
thereby your name comes uh uh or
the authorities included in
there, the authority to issue
tax-exempt bonds.
The investors that uh invest in
these bonds except lower yields
on their bonds because they
don't have to pay taxes.
And we pass those savings on to
uh the borrowers out there that
meet the requirements with below
market interest rates and that
is still the program that we're
mostly known for and is still
going strong.
Uh, in 1997, our mission really
expanded significantly. We not
provide the full spectrum of
housing from homelessness to
home ownership.
And with most of the programs
that we have, I would say uh
definitely north of a 90% our
loans uh to the individuals or
families that we assist.
We have 40+ programs, uh, 40
various different funding
sources, uh, the vast majority
of our programs uh go to the
working families. Um, we have
one office in Albuquerque with
116 employees, uh, many, many
years of experience, and we are
very proud to say that we have
over 300 partners across the
state that deliver services at
the local level.
With regard to oversight of uh
MFA. We have 7 board members,
uh, the lieutenant governor, the
Attorney General, and the state
treasurer are ex officio
members.
Or appointees by the governor,
and I believe we may have one or
two in the audience here.
We also have a legislative
oversight committee that meets
on a regular basis 5 times a
year, uh, this last year we had
19 members uh that were uh
members of the advisory
committee, both the voting and
advisory members.
We also report at least annually
to LFC, other interim committees
as requested, DFA and all of the
various funding sources that we
have. We also undergo over 12
audits on an annual basis and we
have 3 decades of unmodified
audits.
Uh, with regard to this bill,
the Affordable Housing Act was
signed into law in 2004 like
Lida, uh, it is an exemption to
the anti-donation clause. Um, it
permits state, local governments
and school districts to
contribute public funds, lands,
buildings, and other resources,
uh, with the purpose of creating
and preserving affordable
housing.
Housing New Mexico is charged
with rulemaking and oversight of
the Affordable Housing Act.
To date, there are 39 local
governments that are able to
contribute by having in place an
affordable housing plan that we
have approved and approved
ordinances by either the
commission or their council.
To date, there's been 117
million in donations, uh, that
have been made towards
affordable housing.
This funding should you approve,
uh, will help with the
implementation of plans in
ordinances, uh, will help
provide training and technical
assistance and help fund some of
the oversight, I will say that
out of the 39 uh local
governments that have plans or
has the ability to uh uh
Donate towards affordable
housing, there are only about a
dozen that are active, so our
focus would be on implementation
for those other entities that
are not currently donating but
have the ability to do so.
With that, uh, Madam Chair, uh,
We greatly appreciate uh your uh
your consideration. Thank you.
Thank you, senator. Is that all?
We'll go to the audience. Is
there anyone here in support of
Senate Bill 144.
And if you are, if you'd like to
stand, um.
Introduce yourself and make a
short statement, and I'm hoping
to limit it to about 57 people,
that's it.
We have a long agenda to go
through today.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee,
especially for being here on a
Sunday. I'm Alyssa Kenny Guyer.
I'm a former chair of housing
and Human Services in the Oregon
legislature. I'm also a former
advisory member of the Housing
Trust Fund, the part of MFA. And
I currently am a commissioner on
the Community Development
commission in the city of Santa
Fe. So I'm passionate about
housing, and so much of the
housing issues that we have come
down to supply. I think this is
one of the most bipartisan
issues in the legislation.
At least I was in Oregon, and I
think it is here as well.
So, um,
Uh, funding for projects to
increase supply is really
important.
But in addition to the funding
that's leveraged by the
technical assistants that um
Local governments.
Need in order to do their
planning, development,
financing, etc. of development
projects. And so this is a
really critical piece to the
whole picture of providing more
supply. Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Madam Chair members of the
committee, Roger Valdez with the
Center for Housing Economics and
we support this legislation and
allocation, the housing in New
Mexico has been a great partner
with us so far, uh, particularly
on our
Cottage project with some of you
have been good enough to
contribute capital outlay for
that partnership is innovative
and um we believe that the, the,
that housing in New Mexico is
going to continue to be really
critical as the state addresses
housing issues, uh, both rural,
urban, and throughout the whole
state. Thank you. Thank you,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is David
Sara. I'm the director of
government affairs for the New
Mexico Association of Realtors.
This bill's proposal is an
appropriation.
to our friends at Housing New
Mexico to support the Affordable
Housing Act, which can
significantly stimulate local
economies through increased
construction activity related
jobs and increased availability
to affordable housing units,
helping to address the current
housing shortage and making home
ownership more accessible to
more families. We stand in
strong support and thank the
sponsor. Thank you Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Randy
Traynor representing the New
Mexico Home Builders
Association, the apartment
Association, and I'm also a
board member for Housing New
Mexico. Uh, we support the bill.
And I just want to highlight the
uh anti-donation provision of
this bill has never been more
critical than it is right now,
because we're, excuse me, we're
looking for all the special
tools we can and that particular
provision uh really opens up a
lot of opportunities to address
housing. Thank you.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
opposition?
You're in the room?
See none will go to Zoom.
I do have Richard Mason.
Richard
Madam Chairman of the committee,
my name is Dick Mason. I'm a
board member of the League of
Women voters of New Mexico and
Leland voters in Mexico stands
in strong support of the 500,000
appropriation in SB 1452 MFA to
carry out the functions of the
Affordable Care Act.
The Affordable Care Act funding
ensures access to affordable
housing for all people of income
of all income levels, adequate
and affordable housing is
crucial for a well functioning
economy. The league wants to
thank the sponsors for bringing
forward, and we urge us to pass
on SB 145. Thank you.
Thank you. Todd.
Is that Clark?
Madam Chair, my name is Todd
Clark. My family's been doing
commercial real estate now for
over 100 years. I speak in
support of Senate Bill 145 with
the housing shortage of 91,000
units. It's a $27 billion
problem and we need more
legislation like this to bring
on more supply. Thank you, Madam
Chair and committee members.
Thank you, Maria Grigo.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Maria Grego. I'm with
the New Mexico Center on Law and
Poverty, and we thank the
sponsor for this bill.
We stand in support of this bill
because New Mexicans deserve an
affordable place to live.
With skyrocketing housing costs,
many low and moderate income New
Mexicans struggle to find
affordable housing.
This $500,000 appropriation, um,
excuse me, empowers local
governments to address the
affordable housing crisis,
creating solutions tailored to
each community's individual
individual needs. These funds
can be leveraged with other
investments, multiplying the
impact of every dollar spent.
Investing in affordable housing
strengthens local economies by
creating jobs and supporting
community development. For these
reasons, we strongly urge the
committee to vote in favor of
this appropriation. Thank you.
Thank you. Chris Herbert.
Uh, good afternoon, uh,
Chairman, members of the
committee, uh, I'm the executive
director of the Eastern Regional
Housing Authority, and we
stranded, we stand in strong
support of this bill, um, my
points have been made by
previous speakers, so I won't
take up the time, but I
appreciate uh the opportunity to
support this bill.
Thank you, Natasha Martinez.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, thank you. I am
Natasha Martinez. I'm the
executive director for Northern
Regional Housing Authority, and
I'm just going to echo my
colleague's sentiments, uh, up
in the north, and I will not
take up any more of the
committee's time. Thank you.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
opposition?
OK, thank you.
We'll go to questions or
comments from committee members.
Senator Scott
Oh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator.
Expert
Just
144 is $500,000 to administer.
Over the next couple of years, a
$500 million.
Program is that
Am I getting that correctly.
Madam Chair and Senator Scott,
uh, this $500,000 is to
administer the Affordable
Housing Act, which is separate
and Senate Bill 145, where we're
requesting 500 million for the
housing Trust Fund of two
different acts, two different.
activities.
So
Madame Chair and expert.
How much money are you going to
be?
Administering with this
father00,000.
Madam Chair and Senator Scott,
uh.
At this point, there would not
be uh we would be administering
the Affordable Housing Act or
providing oversight, providing
implementation of the affordable
housing plans and ordinances and
implementation of those for 30,
currently 39 local governments
that have that with all the
funding is going to depend on
any contributions that those
local governments make based on
their plans. Uh, there's not a
specified dollar amount.
Um
Um
That is projected at this point.
OK.
So
Madam Chair and expert, can you
tell me how?
144 and 145.
Interact
Madama chair and Senator Scott,
uh.
I, I can see how it's a little
confusing. They are two
different acts, the affordable
housing Act, uh,
As you know, allows for
donations towards affordable
housing without violating the
anti-Donation clause. There are
local governments that donate
towards that. I'll just give one
example as how they can kind of
uh overlap with 145. We could
have the city of Albuquerque
donating a million dollars to a
rental development in
Albuquerque.
Uh, they, uh, the entity that's
building that uh development XYZ
uh developer will also come to
housing New Mexico and ask for
some gap financing to help
complete that 100 unit
development, and they would
request funding from the housing
trust fund, say 34 $5 million
that we would provide to them,
but they are two different
funding sources, one that would
come from the city and their
donation and then some gap
financing or a loan that would
come from housing in Mexico. I
hope that that.
a little bit.
And Madam Chair and Senator,
that's why there's two different
bills instead of one.
OK, I'll hold my questions on
145 to week.
Until we get there. Thank you,
doctor.
Thank you. Other questions?
Senator Savio Lopez, Madam
Chair, There's a motion for a
due passed from Senator Sidil
Lopez.
And a second from them.
A second from Senator Pinto.
And then, uh, a question we're
still open for discussion.
Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator, um.
In reviewing the FIR, it looks
like 250,000 was allocated for
the same purpose, which.
If my math is correct, was for 6
years of administering the fund.
So are we to expect that this
500,000.
Would last for 12 years.
Madam Chair and Senator Charlie,
uh, the, the last, you're
correct, the last allocation
that we received was in 2019 for
250,000 I believe with that
funding we assisted 9 local
governments and implementing
their plans, uh, don't know how
far the 500,000 would go and it
really depend on uh.
The, the work that is needed
with the local governments to
provide training technical
assistance and or to help others
implement their their plans so
uh that's something I can
project at this time,
so I
and Senator.
There's 39 local governments in
need of support, is that?
Correct.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Charley, there are 39 local
governments that currently
qualify uh to donate towards
affordable housing, they have an
affordable housing plan that has
been approved by us and
ordinances that have been
approved at their level, uh, out
of those 39, there's
approximately 12 that are
consistently or active in
donating the other 27 need some
assistance, but I'll tell you
that we're also trying to work
with other local governments to
also have the ability, uh, uh,
to donate in the
Future by submitting, uh,
getting affordable housing plans
at Nordinance is approved, so,
uh, we hope that that 39 expands
to uh 50+ in the future.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator, and then my last
question is.
Do, does your agency have a
relationship with Homewise and
why I asked is because they were
just given $25 million.
Um, by the Yield Foundation to
address that.
Madame Chair and uh Senator
Charlie, yes, we have a very
good partnership with the
Homewise and Mr. Lofton. Uh, we
fund some of the programs that
they uh that they administer and
uh we are grateful that they
were successful in getting that
uh that large donation to him
and I'm sure that's gonna help
further housing in the areas
that they do work in.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you. Other questions,
Senator Locke.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um,
thank you, Senator, and
I'm sorry, what was your name,
sir?
Isidoro Hernandez Hernandez, you
can call me Izzy if you'd like.
Most people do. Yes, sir.
I like it.
Right.
It's awesome. All right. Um,
Madam Chair, uh, Senator Izzy.
Uh
Kind of along the same line.
Senator Charlie was talking
about, um,
In 2019,
Uh, the MFA did receive 250,000
for the same purpose is what I
understand. Uh, that is correct.
Um, you you verify that?
Madam Chair Senator Block, that
is correct. OK.
Madam Chair, Izzy, it looks like
that was able to help 9 local
governments achieve aid uh
affordable housing compliance.
Uh, do you agree with that?
Madame Cheer blocked, that is
correct. OK.
Um, Madam Chair, sir, what, what
were those 9 local governments.
Madam Chair and Senator Block, I
do not have that information
right in front of me right now,
um.
But I can definitely get it uh
to the entire committee here. I
can send an email that lists the
39 and uh specifically those 9
that came online here within the
last 5 years. I do not have that
right in front of me right now.
OK, that's all right, um, Madam
Chair.
Um
Is there anyone here who might
know that's here with you by
chance?
Madam Chair, Senator Block, I do
have uh Robin that works with me
sitting back here, uh, behind my
right side. I think she's on
your left.
Oh, never mind, I thought this
young lady here was.
Uh, Madam Chair, would it be OK
if, um, Izzy brought forward
Robin to.
Let us know what those
communities are.
If you would just move the
microphone to.
A little closer or there's
actually.
microphone.
The hand bikes are also for you.
Um, thank you, um, Madam Chair
and Senator Block. I, I will
need a second to pull up a list
of those communities. Um, I, of
the last 9 in particular you're
doing that, Robin, I will have
just a couple of questions, so
take your time. Thank you for
doing that, Madam Chair.
Uh, is he, so the
Let me, let me just ask him at
$250,000 for these nine
communities.
Where, where exactly, I mean,
did the money go toward um
Let's just say the city of Rio
Rancho or the county of Sandoval
for them to
Help people get the affordable
housing. How, how does that work
exactly?
Madame Chair and Senator Blo uh.
You know, Robin will give us
the, the, the communities here
in a, in a little bit, but
generally, uh, what we do is the
The Affordable Housing Act
requires two things to be
eligible to donate. It's having
a housing plan together that has
different components within it
and then also ordinances that
get past the costly part of it,
uh, is putting the housing plan
together. So sometimes it's
paying for that local government
to uh bring some resources in to
help them put that plan
together. It includes a lot of
data on planning and zoning and
uh
uh population and housing needs,
uh, uh, condition of housing,
etc. so.
I would, uh, without having the
data right in front of me, I
would say that the vast majority
of those funds go to pay to put
the plan together, uh, which,
uh, if you look at the assisting
9 with 250 in round numbers,
maybe $25,000 per entity, a
little bit more than that. Uh, I
would say in today's age, those
uh housing studies are probably
north of $50,000. Thank you,
Izzy. Thank you, Madam Chair. So
the money is not going toward.
And it's a small amount of
money, 500,000. The money is not
going toward any type of
Rehabilitation, whether
weatherized houses or
Uh, provide any efficiency
upgrades, correct? It's not
going to any of those, this
particular pot of money. Is that
correct, Madam Chair Senator
Block, that is correct. OK. So,
Madam Chair, is this money is
really going for
Government studies.
At different municipalities,
it's, it's, it's funding the the
state.
Does the state have to hire
additional people or or there is
the money funneled down to the
counties and municipalities to
hire contractor.
Or another government worker to
put together.
He's uh plans and programs.
Madam Chair and Senator Block.
So the state is not involved the
housing in New Mexico is not a
state agency where a
quasi-governmental agency, we do
have one FTE that's allocated to
assisting these local
governments and overseeing the
act, uh, some local governments
have the capacity to do a lot of
this work internally, the larger
ones do, some of the smaller
local governments do not have
the capacity to put this housing
plans together and they would
then seek a consultant or an
entity to help them put those
plans together. OK, thank you,
Izzy for that. Thank you, Madam
Chair. So I want to make sure I
understand now, I think.
I'm a little bit more clear. So
the money goes to the Department
of Finance and administration,
and then it goes down to your
organization, which is not a
state government organization,
the
New Mexico mortgage Finance
Authority, correct?
Madam Chair in your block, that
is correct. OK. All right. I
think we're all in the same,
same page now, Madam Chair. Um,
then you take that 5, your your
company, your agency takes the
$500,000 of taxpayer money.
And you work
With
Local municipalities and
governments. So basically it's,
it's funding people in your
organization to work with local
Municipalities and governments
to put together their
Their their plans, is that
correct?
Madam Chair and Senator Blaca,
that is correct. The other part
of it is that those entities
that already have their plans
and their ordinances together
may need some assistance in
actually implementing their
plans uh by, say, potentially
issuing RFPs, uh, to donate to
attract developers to come say
Lee County to develop uh homes
there so we help them with that
or make it of a consultant to
help him with that.
Hm
OK.
So, Madam Che Izzy, um.
When
When you guys had the 250,000
bucks back in 2019 and you were
able to
Get these 9
Or um municipalities.
In compliance
Uh, what, what is compliance
mean like for real Rancho or
Sandoval County, I mean, you can
go in and out of compliance the
following day, can you not? I
mean, what's, what's the, the
threshold for being in
compliance versus
non-compliance.
Madam Chair and uh Senator
Block, uh, I'll go back to the
two requirements to be able to
donate, uh, one of them is
having an affordable housing
plan that hasn't been approved
by our agency and then secondly,
is having an ordinance that is
passed by, if it's uh a city,
you know their council or if
it's a county, they're uh
commission. Once they have those
in place, uh, then they can
donate land buildings,
infrastructure or funding uh
towards that when they make that
donation.
report to us uh at least on a
annual basis on the donation
that they made, we make sure
that they, uh, when they report
that we that the development
that was uh
Uh
Developed with a funding or the
land that was donated that they
meet the compliance requirements
by housing people that are uh
moderate or low or moderate
income levels stay in there and
then uh on a case by case basis,
we go out and we monitor to make
sure the facility is in good
order, uh, and meeting all of
the requirements.
Um, so that's, that would be
with uh those that make
donations as far as those that
are looking to uh
Become an eligible local
government, we helped them in
reviewing their housing plans to
make sure it has all the
components that the act requires
in there and then we also uh
provide some guidance,
obviously, the approval of the
ordinances is that the local
level, but we provide some best
practices and what other uh
other local governments have
done to allow them to make those
donations. I I hope that
clarifies a little bit.
And
Senator, there's actually an
interim committee.
That's just dedicated with with
MMA
that does all the.
All of this
Thank you, Senator. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So out
of the 33 counties in New
Mexico.
Um,
How many of them
Have these ordinances, uh, to
help them comply.
Madame Maer and Senator Black,
those are the 39 that are listed
on here and I am thinking, uh,
Robin uh is uh.
Getting close to, I know we have
the 39, I don't know if we had
nailed it down to the 9 that
were most recently helped, but
uh I think Robin is getting real
close to identifying those, uh,
some of them are local
governments or cities and some
of them are counties, but Robin,
are you ready to
over that problem.
OK, so, madam chair and uh Izzy
Robins, so I guess there's two
questions.
Um, one is, what were the nine
local governments that
The uh
New Mexico mortgage Finance
Authority helped.
Achieve AHA compliance.
And then what, if any, of the 33
counties are not in compliance.
Uh, Jaren syndrola uh.
Robin is getting to that. I will
say that we don't consider the
other counties or local
governments being in
noncompliance, they have just
chosen at this point that they
don't want to donate and they,
they would be out of compliance
if they're donating, uh,
that's a fair and uh met the
requirements, but just because
they are, don't have an
affordable housing plan or
ordinance in place does not mean
they're out of compliance. They
may have chosen not to do that.
No, that's a good answer. I
appreciate that. And um, Madam
Chair, the 250,000 that your
company received in 2019. Is
that the last amount of uh money
funding that you have received 6
years ago, 250,000.
Sorry, Madam Chair, my senator
block.
Uh, that is the last bomb
before, so I'm a little a little
jumpy. I, I understand that the
uh.
That is the last amount of money
we received towards the.
in the administration of the
Affordable Housing Act.
Madam Chair, I'm sorry. Did you
say that was the last funding
you received, Madam Chair,
Senator, that is correct for the
Affordable Housing Act, that is
correct.
And then lastly, Madam Chair and
uh Izzy and Robin, do, do you
have those names?
Ah
Yes, uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Block, so the counties that have
um approved uh plans and
ordinances include Bernalo, Dona
Anna.
Guadalupe
Lee
Los Alamos.
Luna.
Rio Ariva.
Santa Fe
The Coral
House and Valencia.
Again, those are the counties
that.
Have
Affordable Housing Act.
Uh, in their ordinance.
The other part of your question
regarding which um.
Local governments were funded
with the $250,000 appropriation
that we received in 2019. Right,
Madam Chair, the, the 9 Robin.
Yes, Madam Chair and um,
senator.
It was Espanola.
Fox
Uh, and I believe Epiola
included Rio Riva County.
Uh, Colfax.
Carl's Bad Eddie County.
Uh, Taos.
And Questa, the town of Taos.
The town of Artesia.
So the appropriations that were
made, um.
Added up to $220,000 between
those entities.
And they provided $44,000 in
match contribution towards those
plans.
Uh, we did have some
administrative costs that we
also um had for admin, you know,
for, for the oversight piece of
that.
Anything that we've done, um, I
don't think that adds up to 9 to
your point, but anything that we
did after that and I can um.
I can give you that information
as well would have been done
without any funding from.
At at MFA's expense.
Thank you, Robin, that's, that's
perfect. um.
One of the
Madam Chair is, there's 2 Class
A counties that are missing.
Uh, San Juan in in Sandoval, um.
I'm trying to understand why,
why that would be, especially
Sandovals, the fastest growing
county.
In the state of New Mexico.
Um, Madam Chair and the senator,
not every, every county has the
capacity to leverage it's a,
it's an opt in so if they don't.
Choose to provide affordable
housing or administer a plan
that is entirely up to them.
Well, Senator, Madam Chair, we
do affordable housing. You
probably you probably know is he
in Real Rancho and Enchanted
Hills, we've have, we do have
affordable housing up there,
which is why I'm surprised me
that Sandoval is not going this
particular way through the MFA,
uh, on that, um, that's one that
really kind of stumps me and
I'll give uh
Wayne Johnson a call to ask him
why, unless Izzy, you have
something to say.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Bloch, I actually do. He just
mentioned the counties there
cause you uh I believe the
question was on the counties.
There are some local governments
and cities that also have that
in place and I'll let Robin go
through that list. I believe it
includes Rio Rancho, local
government or a city that
municipality that
is also in compliance or has a
plan and an ordinance in place,
but I'll let uh Robin.
With your permission to go over
that.
Well, thanks, Madam Chair and
senator, yes, I would just, uh,
if you want me to list all the
cities I can, um, but, but Rio
Rancho is uh is an approved
entity. Thank you, Robin. Thank
you, Izzy. Thank you, Senator,
Madam Chair, thank you. Um.
I'm a lot more educated on this
when you read the bill, you just
think of like what the hell is
this? and then uh you got to
kind of do a little bit of a, a
deep dive to understand it, so
I'm, I'm in support and uh I
appreciate uh your indulgence in
your patience.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Other questions?
You're on a do pass motion.
And Senator Sidil Lopez with the
2nd from Senator Pinto. If you
could please call the roll.
Senator Block.
Senator Boom.
Senator Charlie.
Senator Gallego, yes ma'am.
Nova. Yes.
Senator Pinto.
Senator Scott
Senator Serio Lopez, yes,
Senator Hickey. Yes. Senator
Lopez.
Yes.
By a vote of 9 to 0, you have a
due pass motion on Senate Bill
144.
And now we'll move on to Senate
Bill 145.
And his
And this is a housing trust fund
and affordable housing.
Senator
Thank you Madam Chair and
members of the committee, Senate
Bill 145 adds a couple more
zeros appropriates 500 million
from the general fund to the New
Mexico Housing Trust Fund.
For expenditure in fiscal year
2026.
Uh, for the purposes of the New
Mexico housing Trust Fund Act.
Bill and marks 10% of the
appropriated amount of funding
to a municipality or county for
affordable housing projects,
including the construction or
rehabilitation of existing
affordable housing.
The municipality or county is to
provide no less than 3 times
matching funds from sources
other than the state. They have
adopted affordable housing plans
and ordinances pursuant to the
act and shall administer the
project pursuant to the act.
And Mr. Fernandez, if we would
like to add anything.
Senator Black, I apologize. Uh,
so I, I'll add a just a Madam
Chair, if you can give me just
another minute, I'll, I'll go
through some of the housing need
and then some of the production
and then hit on the housing uh
trust fund and then I'll explain
that the bill in a little bit
more detail. Um.
So the in uh, I'm gonna go over
housing need real quick, uh, uh,
we developed a house in New
Mexico housing strategy, the
first of its kind in the state a
couple of years ago. Intent was
to identify the need for
affordable housing, uh, the
resources that are available to
meet that need, uh, the gap and
then develop some strategies.
Uh, there's an over overwhelming
need for affordable housing
across the state as I, I'm sure
you're aware, the need is
estimated to be at $42 billion.
I'll give you.
Some examples, there's a
shortage of 32,000 affordable
rental units for very low income
households.
We are short about 25,000 single
family homes across the state.
Uh, there's 40,000 homes that
lack complete plumbing, kitchen,
a facilities, and those are
mostly focused on tribes and
colonials in the southern part
of the state, uh, there's
350,000 homes that were built
prior to 1980 that uh very
likely like rehab.
Uh, so that's just a synopsis of
some of the need we have more
detail.
On the production site, uh, and
this is all thanks to the
infrastructure of partners that
we have across the state and
the, the great staff and support
of the board, uh, over our last
50 years, uh, you, you, you're
not gonna believe the number
here. Uh, it's just, uh, we were
adding up the numbers and it's
505,000 families have been a
sister over the last 50 years of
the 505 somehow came up as we
were adding up the numbers.
Uh, last year we were able to
assist just under 19,000
families, uh, 3700 families plus
became a first time home buyers.
The impact of uh affordable
housing and all that we do at
Housing New Mexico with the help
of our partners as a great
economic impact. It's estimated
that $434 million in direct and
indirect local impact uh that uh
was made through those
investments and over 5900
construction jobs.
Uh, just to give you a synopsis
of some of the stuff we have in
the pipeline. Currently we have
51 different rental developments
in various stages of development
across the state that composes
about 4800 units, uh, 20
different municipalities and 15
counties. Uh, I'll just give you
a quick synopsis of those we
have for on tribal lands or in
Sandoval County, 15 in Bernalo
County.
Um, on the single family
development site, which is where
an area where we really need uh
some homes as well. Uh, we have
9 separate developments, uh, in
one phase of construction or
another, just under 500 units in
8 different communities across
the state.
In the 32 years that I've been
at the house in New Mexico. Uh,
we've made a great use of all
the funds that you've entrusted
it with entrusted us with and
that we've had from the federal
government as well, uh, with no
funds returned back.
Uh, now with the
Focusing on the housing trust
fund, uh, which is a bill
that'll be before you.
Our board has made 52 separate
awards in the last 18 months.
Uh, that'll help develop or
assist over 5400 households
across the state.
Uh, the money has gone out to
all 33 counties and with 36
different partners that uh
applying for some of those funds
and putting it to work.
Uh, we've been very fortunate to
receive 122 million in the last
18 months, 72 million is uh.
Due to the severance tax bond,
uh, where we get 2.5% of the
severance tax bond capacity,
another 50 million is the
legislative appropriation we
received it last year.
$84 million of that 122 million
became available to us just
seven months ago on July 1st of
uh 24.
In that short period of time,
we've been able to encumber 19
million of those funds uh that
have been awarded to projects or
programs, so the money is being
put to work very efficiently.
They help support all of the
across the spectrum for
affordable housing.
We currently have the act
requires that there's a 3 to 1
leverage requirement in the uh
uh housing trust fund. We are
currently leveraging 16 to 1,
which means that for every $1 we
invest in the housing trust
fund, we're attracting or using
$16 for another funding source.
Uh
The total assisted, I, I just
went over some of the uh monies
there, the recent monies uh over
the last 18 months, but since
the act has been in existence
since 2005, we've been able to
assist over 10,000 families with
a total funding of $183 million
which includes not only the
appropriations and the
investments from the state, but
also the program income uh that
uh from repayments of those
loans, and I have several
examples I can give you, but in
the essence of time, I will uh
not go over those. I would like
to
s um mar ize that uh we have a
50 year history at uh Housing
New Mexico, 50 years of success,
uh, due to the 300 partners of
the seasoned staff that we have
across the state, uh, I went
over our oversight. We have very
strong oversight with our board
and oversight committee, um,
there's a great housing need as
I just explained, uh, and we
have a proven record of
effectively utilizing the funds
as I just went over our
production of 505,000 families
that have been assisted in how
we
the Housing Trust Fund. We have
a very strong belief that
housing is the foundation for
strong families and communities,
and we're confident that any
funds you entrust us with will
be effectively used across the
state.
This, uh
Senate Bill 145, I asked or
request $500 million investment
to the housing Trust Fund.
There's a table in the FIR that
you have available to you that
indicates we could use those
funds within a two-year period,
um, across the various
activities to include single
family development, multi-family
development, down payment
assistance, uh, housing re rehab
and some to homeless prevention
and building permanent
supportive housing units.
One of the things that is
different with this particular
bill, and I'm almost done, Madam
Chair, is that it has a set a
site for local governments, um,
local governments already have
the ability to request funds and
we have some examples of what
they have, but in this case the
set aside would allow him to
have a set of sites specifically
for local governments, um, and
that would be available for 12
months. Any funds not requested
or used or encumbered during
that time frame would just
revert back to the housing trust
fund, uh, and available to all
the other entities across the
state.
Um,
now I understand that, uh,
Senator Gonzalez was working on
an amendment. I'm not sure if
you have that in front of you or
if that'll come up at the next
uh committee hearing with that,
uh, Madam Chair, I stand for any
questions.
Well, thank you.
Um, we do have an amendment and
it's 230714.1.
Um, are you prepared to explain
the amendment?
Senator Pinto, have you seen it
also?
When he gave this up, uh, Madam
Chair, members of the committee
when he gave this to me, I did
not have it. OK.
And I know that
it is his amendment, but.
Uh, are you prepared to explain
and walk us through it.
OK, for purposes of discussion.
The chair will move.
Um, the amendment.
235
No, 230714.1.
Um, so I'll move that and then a
second from Senator Hickey.
So if you could please present.
The amendment
Madam Chair, and I don't have in
front of me what you have right
in front of you, but I can go
over the highlights, uh, real
quick on, uh, the main changes
to that, uh, would be the set of
site that was in the original
bill before the amendment was a
10% set aside for local
governments that has changed to
30%. Uh, the
know that what is in front of us
is changing, striking 10 and er
inserting in there of 15.
OK.
I apologize, Madam Chair, so,
uh, it is the copy there in
front of you, Senator.
So you can see.
The main uh changes, uh, Madam
Chair, as we are a striking the
tin and inserting uh.
15 in there I believe the, the
15 is for uh
The large metropolitan areas and
then 15 for the rural areas for
a total of about 30, so that's
where I was off a little bit,
madam chair, so I apologize.
Um
Secondly, uh, we are also, uh,
striking, uh,
The, on page 2 line 6, including
and inserting in lieu of thereof
affordable housing projects
include um
I'm getting a little lost here
just cause I hadn't seen it this
format here, so I apologize and
I'll let, uh, Robin explain it
if you don't mind.
Madam, what the, um, I'll just
summarizes the microphone to
your face, Miss Robin, please.
Thank you.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair, what
the amendment does is it
increases the, um, thank you, it
increases the set aside uh to be
um 30% in total with the 15% for
Um, rural and 15% for um
non-rule um entities or local
governments.
It also um removes the
requirement for the 3 to 1
funding.
Match uh from other sources, so
that is completely removed.
Um, and then it amends paragraph
or section C, um, to, um,
To be a part of section C,
excuse me, um, becomes a part of
section B, um,
Online and I'm not sure if this
is the same line.
Uh, so where I'm at is on
Uh, page 2 between lines 13 and
14. So that um moved to section
B, um, which requires that and
um applicant have the
demonstrated ability to expedite
zoning processes that support
affordable housing.
And I believe that was all of
the amendments, Madam Chair.
OK, we'll go to the audience
who's.
Is there anyone in support of
the amendment?
If you wish to make a statement.
Please stand.
Identify yourself in a short
statement, please.
Again, this is on the amendment.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I
support the entire bill, but I
also support the amendment, um,
having been on the advisory
board for the housing Trust
Fund. Sometimes I know it's hard
to get out the money,
particularly for smaller
municipalities and counties,
rural counties, it's hard for
them to find the 3 to 1 match,
and we really need to get going
with this. So I'm, I'm
particularly supportive of that.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I am also in support
of the amendment I too um uh
prefer the reduction of the or
elimination of the 3 to 1 match
as well as allocation specific
allocation to local entities and
the division of that between the
metro and rural areas because
our rural areas have a, have an
even harder time of attracting
development than do our um metro
areas. Thank you.
Thank you and I apologize. I was
speaking, ma'am.
Excuse me, just to make sure I
was talking to my secretary.
What is your name again, please?
Sorry, Winter Torres, um, CEO
and founder of New Mexico
Eviction Prevention and
diversion.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, David Sara, the New
Mexico Association of Realtors,
um, in support of the amendment
and support of the bill, the
appropriation of $500 million to
the New Mexico Housing Trust
Fund for affordable housing
projects is a transformative
investment that will catalyze
significant developments in both
urban and rural areas across the
state, we stand in strong
support. Thank you.
Anyone else in support?
Anyone in oppos did you want to
say something, Mr. Weeks?
Please join us.
Uh, Mr. Weeks, you're supposed
to use the microphone.
OK, madam Chair, thank you. My
name is Dan Weeks. I represent
Berlio County and the new
collaborative uh housing
collaborative we put together
the last 6 months, and we're in
support of this.
Thank you, just so we can
capture it on the web.
Anyone in opposition?
See none, and for those who are
on Zoom.
Um, Mr. Richard Mason.
Mr. Mason, this is on the
amendment.
Yes, oh, I.
No, not only by.
Thank you.
Um, Todd Clark.
Again, on the amendment.
OK, so this is, these are the
names that I'm mentioning now,
just say the bill, so we'll hold
off on that for a second.
So
Is there anyone in support of
the amendment?
OK. Anyone in opposed to the
amendment?
OK. So with that, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee on the amendment. See
no. Oh, Senator Scott on the
amendment.
Well, thank you, Madam Chair.
So,
the way that I'm reading this
is.
Prior to this amendment $50
million was allocated to
The municipality or county for
affordable housing, and now
we're going to
Out of this.
$500 billion 15% will be to
Non-rural and 15% to
Rural, so a total of
$150 million.
So who's not getting
The 100.
Who's not getting the 100
million that's going.
For these two entities.
Ma
Madam Chair and uh Senator
Scott.
The uh
As you mentioned that initially
it was 10% if we received the
full $500 million it would be
uh, you know, $50 million that
would be available to local
governments.
Now with the 30% set aside, that
would be 150 million. Uh, the
total amount of money that it
would be available is 500
million, as I mentioned earlier,
local governments already have
the ability to uh
pursue those funds.
And uh
uh to come in and ask for those
funds, request those funds, so
that there's not, there's just
more money available or set
aside to the local governments,
not at the expense of others,
uh, if you will, uh, I guess it
would be at the expense of
non-local governments that would
come and ask for those funds,
which would be a private
developers, not for profits,
etc.
So
Madam Chair and easy ain.
And just a developer.
Come request these monies?
I, I
Why wouldn't all of this 500
million go through.
Those folks that you just
qualified in the last bill.
Madam Chair in uh Senator Scott,
the housing Trust Fund is very
flexible and we currently allow
uh for profit and nonprofit
developers, local governments,
tribal governments to come and
uh request those funds. Uh, I
would say that the vast majority
of the requests to date have
been from non-local governments.
We do have a couple of examples
of uh say Las Cruces and uh
Ridoso that have received or
requested funds here.
recently, but uh mostly it's
been other folks that are
developers, uh, developing
single family, multifamily
developments across the state.
And Madame Chane you don't run
aground.
On anti donation issues with
Madama chair and Senator Scott,
we do not the uh previous bill
that we just uh talked about in
144, there's uh
Uh, an exception to the
anti-donation clause with
affordable housing, so if the
donation is made from a local
government or in this case from
the state towards affordable
housing, uh, it is not violate
the anti-donation clause, and I
would say that the vast majority
of these funds that are made
available are made in the form
of loans.
OK.
And I believe I heard
represented Madam Chair.
And Izzy in the last
presentation.
That you were we were far
exceeding.
The 3 to 1 leverage with these
funds, I believe the number was
16 to 1.
But now here in this.
Amendment we are eliminating the
requirement.
Or even a 3 to 1 match, so
instead of
$600 million going to these.
$150 million going to these.
Two entities generating another
$450 million. There's no
requirement for them.
To generate any, have any
additional.
Skin in the game if you will.
Madame Chain, Senator Scott, uh,
that, uh, is correct. The, the
language in the bill does not
require that, uh.
We, and you're correct, 16 to 1
is our current uh lab leverage
ratio that we have, we are, the
reason we took that out if we
have uh some small local rural.
Governments that want to access
the funds and they don't have
the capacity or the funding to
provide that 3 to 1 match. Uh,
we did not want to uh.
Exclude them from this funding
being available to them. I can
tell you that while we'll plan
on doing is, uh, with the funds
that are allocated under this
bill is we'll do a request for
proposals and we'll have some
priority points in there for
local governments that are able
to provide that leverage,
they'll receive points for that.
We'll also be giving uh probably
preference to smaller local
governments that are trying to
do something where they could
get some points so that they're
not eliminated, so we definitely
need to make sure that overall
we're meeting the 3 to 1 minimum
match that the.
Housing Trust Fund has, uh, but
we realized that there may be
some smaller local governments
uh that may not have the
capacity to provide that match
upfront.
So
Madam Charon is a, why then the
non-rural.
These would be larger
communities.
Lots of capacity and.
They also.
would not be required to come up
with any kind of.
Madama Cheri that cinderscota.
At the house in New Mexico, what
we'll do is we'll issue a
request for proposals or notice
of funding availability where we
have those additional
requirements and give priority
points to those local
governments that do provide
leverage. So we'll have some
requirements in there if they
don't score high enough and we
don't have the criteria
developed right now. This is the
first time that we've had it set
aside, but I can assure you
we'll have criteria where we'll,
at the end of the day, we need
to make sure that we do our
meeting the uh statutory.
requirements of 3 to 1 leverage
so we, we're gonna be drafting
our procurement documents to
make sure at the end of the day,
we had a minimum meet those
requirements and uh I would
likely say that the larger local
governments that have the
capacity, uh, I'm sure they
would be forthcoming and able to
provide that leverage at some of
the uh smaller local community
or rural communities would not
be able to.
OK.
Izzy, thank you, thank you for
the answers. That's all on the
amendment.
I'll have some more questions on
the bill.
Thank you, Senator Scott. Any
further questions on the
amendment?
seen no if you could call the
roll on the amendment, please.
her block.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes
Yes, the bill is amended.
82 1
And so now we'll go back on the
amended bill.
And I do believe we still have,
I I.
I don't think there's going to
be any change for those who
stood up earlier but either in
favor.
Or against um on the amended
bill.
And then for those who spoke, of
course, um.
Unless you all want to stand up
again and say something. Would
you like to stand?
If you'd like to stand again,
please.
And again, this is on the
amended bill for Senate Bill
145. Thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
Melissa Kenny Guyer in support
of the amended bill, as you've
heard earlier, there's over
91,000 housing units needed
here, and that can cost tens of
billions of problems, and we
need to chip away, so supply,
supply, supply is so incredibly
important. This bill is one of
the, if fully funded, is one of
the most transformative housing
bills that we can possibly pass
in the legislature.
along with the new proposed
Office of Housing, Planning and
Production, we need to start
chipping away. We have a huge
issue, and it will help our
economic development,
educational attainment, health
and safety of our residents,
please pass the bill. Thank you.
Madam Chair, Senators, my name
is Daniel Wealth. I'm the
director of the Governor's
Office of Housing, Planning and
Production here to support this
bill and the largest investment
we can make in housing.
Um, we can't overinvest in
housing right now in New Mexico,
and housing is unlike any other
investment we make in the state.
It has so many benefits from
local economic development
benefits to uh gross receipts
tax generation to local property
tax generation, but mostly in
saving downstream costs, things
that US senators struggle with
all the time, educational
attainment, behavioral health.
Child and welfare. These are all
things that are impacted by
housing and housing
affordability, and I encourage
you to uh make as big of an
investment in housing as you
can. Thank you.
Um, Madam Chair, members of the
community, my name is Joseph
Montoya. I represent the city of
Albuquerque, uh, both the city
of Albuquerque and Ber County
have officially endorsed this
bill. We are in vastly in need
of more affordable housing
resources. We work very closely
with the governor's office and
MFA in order to achieve those
goals, but one of the areas that
we're all lacking is more
capital that's needed to be able
to achieve these goals in the
city itself we're lacking over
30,000 units, 18,000 units for
low and moderate income people.
this bill would go a long way in
terms of putting in mechanisms
for us to be able to achieve the
goals that we all need to be
able to uh house all New
Mexicans. Thank you very much.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Winter
Torres, um, CEO and founder of
New Mexico Eviction Prevention
and diversion. Just quickly, I
wanted to mention now with the
amendment with the zoning
issues, um, this sort of follows
the model of Colorado, you have
to encourage the local
municipalities to be progressive
with their zoning, otherwise,
they just don't do it, such as
in Albuquerque, 76% of the
housing is a single family, and
that just does not
allow for the number of units
and speed with which we need
them to be um to be built. So
zoning, um, this tackling zoning
is a very key piece of this.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
opposition?
See none will go to zoom.
And I do have Richard Mason
again in support of Senate Bill
145 as amended.
Yes, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Dick
Mason. I'm a board member of the
League of Women Voters in
Mexico. The League of Women
Voters in Mexico stands in
strong support of the $500
million request for New Mexico
Healthing Trust, um, NSB 145,
according to two recent studies,
state and national studies, the
need for affordable housing in
our state is at a critical
juncture. This appropriation
will provide the needed funding
to rehabilitate.
Rehabilitate or build new
housing to help alleviate the
current housing market, uh,
supply crisis.
We, we really support the
provision of the set aside for
um municipalities and counties
and we like the fact that that
was um increased. This provides
a strategic tool for local
communities to directly address
the housing needs in their
community. So the league urges
the committee to give a due pass
to SB 145, and we want to thank
uh Senator Gonzalez and the
others for putting this
legislation forward. Thank you.
Thank you, Todd Clark. Madam
Chair, committee members is an
owner, investor, developer,
former public housing
commissioner and board member of
a number of nonprofits that work
in the affordable housing space.
I've been able to partner with
MFA and Housing New Mexico for
over 30 years and believe this
investment is an investment in
our future, and I would
encourage your support of Senate
Bill 145 as amended. Thank you.
Thank you, Natalie Green.
Good afternoon, uh, chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Natalie Green, the
housing administrator for the
city of Las Cruces. We strongly
support this bill to expand
affordable housing. Over the
past two years, Las Cruces has
leveraged our trust fund dollars
with New Mexico Housing Trust
Fund dollars to construct
hundreds of new housing units to
directly address the pressing
need for safe and stable
housing. This funding is
essential for tackling an
unprecedented housing crisis and
rising homelessness across the
state and unprecedented problems
require unprecedented
investment.
Investing in affordable housing
stimulates the economy,
increases tax revenue, all while
ensuring our families have
stability. This will help
communities all across New
Mexico increased production and
meet the urgent demand. Thank
you.
Thank you, Maria Grego.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee, Maria
Grego with the New Mexico Center
on Law and Poverty, um, and in
the interest of time, I will um
just echo um everything said by
my fellow housing advocates who
spoke before me and who are in
the room today. Um, this $500
500 million dollars
appropriation is an important
step toward tackling New
Mexico's housing crisis and
providing long term support for
both low and moderate income
families in New Mexico, and for
that reason, the center on law
and poverty strongly supports
the bill and urges
committee uh to give a due pass.
Thank you.
Thank you. And then there's
someone with Zoom user.
I'm sorry?
All right, Zoom user has left.
All right.
So with that, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Senator Nava.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you, Senator, for bringing
the bill forward. um, and thank
you, Mr. Izzy. Uh, I come from
the US Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and I'm very
proud to see this bill here. Um,
I saw many of these initiatives
across the country, so this is
not new nationally, but it is
absolutely new to New Mexico,
um, and I just wanna, um, ensure
that we have an understanding of
what the funds will be sort of
broken up into, um, and just
wanna reassure and I think these
are included in the FIR and some
of the other.
ana ly s is that we've received,
um, but sort of, it breaks it
down into areas from building
rental and homeownership housing
to supplying down payments,
housing assistance to rehab
aging housing stock to funding
homelessness and homelessness
prevention programs and
investing in innovative,
affordable housing projects are
all of those prongs correct?
Madam Chair, Senator Nava, that
is correct.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um.
Senator and uh expert uh is
there a prioritization of those
areas that will be taking place.
Madam Chair, in uh Senator Nava,
it's uh.
You might guess that there's a
need to across the state and all
of those areas, so we do not
prioritize one over the other.
What we do is, uh, with a
guidance from our board, uh, and
the housing needs assessment
that I mentioned that we had
conducted earlier, uh, we put
monies in each of those areas
and then uh as the demand or the
request come in, we have the
flexibility to move money from
one pot to the other, so if uh
demand in one area does not
materialize, we're able to move
it into other areas where it
does materialize. I can say that
all of those.
activities that you mentioned,
we've been able to use that $122
million that I mentioned earlier
to touch in each of those areas.
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
Thank you, Mr. Izzy. Um, Madam
Chairwoman and, uh, Senator Mr.
Izzy, do you all receive any
direct, uh, federal funding?
Madam Chair and uh Senator Nava,
yes, we do. We receive uh funds
from the federal government, uh,
from HUD.
Home, uh, funds, uh, some RHP
funds, some ESG HAPA, a lot of
acronyms you may not be aware
of, but I know Senator Navaes,
uh, on the, uh, DOE side, we
received some money from uh DOE
for weatherization program, both
the regular weatherization and
BIL funds and some money from my
EPA for those activities and
then, uh, well, it's not direct
funding, we also have uh
Uh, funding or tax credits that
we award that come to us from
the US Treasury or that
authority to do that.
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
Thank you, Mr. Izzy. Um, do you,
how much funding do you directly
receive from HUD.
Madamaer and Senator Nava Amuna
had some of my numbers up here
from the top of my head, uh.
If you could help me, Robin,
here, I think from uh
How'd we get approximately $6
million a year on the home.
About 1.2 on uh ESG about
$600,000 on hapu.
The RHP is about 900,000, maybe
uh maybe a million dollars
there.
Um
And I
Am I missing anything, Robin, on
the uh
I think, I think that that may
be uh about it. So if you add
those up, uh, you're probably
much better at math than I am,
but I would probably in the, uh,
close to $10 million from a hut
that we get.
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and
thank you, Mr. Izzy. You are
good with numbers and good with
your brain, so I acknowledge
that and really applaud it. uh,
Madam Chairwoman, uh, Mr. Izzy.
Do you foresee, um.
A cut in that funding.
Uh, Madam Chair and, uh, Senator
Nava, that is uh.
Hard question to answer. I think
we've all been following the
news and what's been going on.
I, I can tell you that when the
initial funding freeze uh
happened uh 2-3 weeks ago. Uh,
we felt comfortable that uh we
did not want to stop any of the
services that were, were being
provided, so we were told all
our providers to continue doing
what they were doing until we
got further notice and at this
point, we continue to do that.
Um, so I'm hopeful that it does
not get cut, uh, but uh we'll
just have to wait and see how
things develop at the at the
national level.
Madam Chairwoman, Mr. Izzy,
thank you very much for that.
Um, I do share the concern
across the board, and that is
just a fact, um, so I appreciate
the initiative that you're all
taking to ensure that you are
Assessing and accounting um at
the statewide level to ensure
that these funds are allocated
and ready for you to use and
distribute in these areas of
high need across the state, and
so I stand in full support and
really applaud your efforts.
Thank you.
Uh, thank you, Senator Sio
Lopez. I'm Duas.
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Serio Lopez with a
second from Senator Cindy Nava,
uh, but we're still open for
discussion.
And Senator Scott.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
I, I believe I've heard
representatives that y'all have
already deployed.
Uh, about $100 million into this
program is.
Did I hear that correctly?
Madame Cheerson and her Scott,
that is correct, I believe the
number was 109 million of the
122 that has been encumbered to
programs uh or uh actual
projects.
OK.
And the next question is,
What percentage
Of these expenditures so far
have been loans.
Will they be generating revenue
back into your program.
And out of the
$500 million.
How much of that.
Percentage wise what you
anticipate.
Being loans and
Do you, Madam Chair, is he ever
Envision this program becoming.
With those revenues coming back
in, you ever envisioned this
program.
Becoming self-sustaining.
Madame Cherina, Senator Scott,
so I think the, uh, let me make
sure I have the questions
correct. The first one is, uh,
what percentage or loans and
then secondly, do I envision
this program eventually becoming
self-sustaining.
So, uh, the first question on
the percentage of loans, uh, I
would say that uh we are over
90% of the awards that have been
made out of that $122 million
have been loans, um, I, uh, with
regard to the program income
that is generates with those
loans, uh, I'll, I'll just give
you an actual fact, and this is
prior to the $122 million that
we received, uh, over the last
18 months. Prior to that, we had
received.
$7 million over us 18 year
period out of that $27 million
we generated, uh, and this is
over an 18 year period, $42
million in program income.
So I do see that with the
additional investment, uh, in
the loans that we're making, it
takes a while obviously for
those loans to pay off some of
those are 30-year mortgages, if
you will, uh, but I do see that
the uh the our projections on
program income will continue to
grow. Uh, I don't know that
we'll ever say that.
There's going to be sufficient
money in the housing trust fund
to meet all of the need out
there, one of our projections
from the housing needs
assessment that we did was that
there's about $42 billion in
need based on some of those
figures that I showed you, and I
don't know that we'll ever grow
the fund that big, but uh we do
want to invest it wisely and
continue to bring that program
and come in, so it will continue
to grow, uh, but do not feel
that it's gonna be sufficient to
meet all of the need out there.
Mature Izzie up.
For these anywhere near.
Commercial rates.
Or is this
Uh, would, would you consider
this a
A substantial.
Madame Chary in a
Senator, uh
Scott, the uh
I think, uh, I'm gonna answer
this in two different ways, uh,
and I'm gonna use maybe uh
Senator Gallegos here going out
on a limb and Senator Block.
There are some developments that
are going on in their
communities that you can look at
these uh apartment complexes are
the examples in this case, and
you cannot distinguish those
from market rate units. Now the
individuals that are moving into
those are moderate income
families, so they are not making
tons of money, but they're at uh
working families that may work
as police officers, teachers
are.
in the service industry, uh, the
subsidy that we provide is that
uh while they are loans that are
below market interest rate loan,
so instead of getting uh say uh
8 or 9% construction loan at the
bank, we're offering 2 or 3% uh
construction loans, so there are
some subsidy that goes in there,
but those monies are repaid
back, uh, another example would
be, uh, we just recently
launched a uh uh program for
single family development called
the Zip program eroter
HomeBuilder program that is a 0.
uh construction loan or entry
level homes, uh, defined as
homes that are uh moderately
priced and as for certain square
footage, uh, so they're gonna
get a 0% interest rate loan
during the construction period
versus uh, say 8 or 9% on a
construction loan that they can
get in a, in a bank, but once
they build that house, they're
gonna sell it and sell it at the
market rate uh for that home and
get a 30-year mortgage on it.
So, I hope that gives you some
examples of uh
Some of the things that we're
doing with the funding and
whether you consider it heavily
subsidized or not, uh, is just a
a matter of uh how you see those
numbers.
Last question, Madam Chair, this
one's for the senator.
That in the budget
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Senator Rodriguez had
anything to do with it before
she left, I'm pretty sure it is
because this was these two bills
are.
I would be amiss to not.
Yeah
Recognizing Senator Rodriguez's
work and her genius, um, to
develop all of this so.
Believe so.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Other questions?
Senator Block?
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, senator, Izzy.
Good to talk to you again.
You know, we keep talking about
the housing crisis in New
Mexico, uh, is a, um.
Would, would you agree?
That
Since
2018 to 2024.
There's less than half of the
availability of houses available
in New Mexico. Would you agree
to that?
Madam Chair and uh Senator
Block, I don't have the exact
number, but there has been a
decrease in the availability, so
you're probably, if you're
looking at numbers, I would rely
on that.
And what you're looking at.
So, Madam Chair, is the one of
the reasons that just my
opinion, I think the housing
crisis has hit hard here in New
Mexico.
It's probably because of COVID.
You had a lot of people move out
from
California or other states that
sold their house.
And probably bought a better
house at a lower price here in
New Mexico, and I've seen it.
And uh Sandoval County with.
You know, Placidus and town of
Bernalillo and in Rio Rancho
with some.
Beautiful homes out there have a
lot of.
Out of state buyers because of
COVID they've been able to work
remote. Um, would you?
Would you agree that's probably
um one of the reasons home
prices have increased.
Madame Chair and uh Senator
Bloch, I think that it was
definitely uh one of the
contributing factors.
Thank you, sir. Thank you Madam
Chair. Would you also agree
For the past 4 years with 20%
compounded inflation that has
caused the housing prices.
To increase as well.
Madam Chair and Senator Bloch,
uh, some of the components, uh,
you know, in the increase, I, I
think as the increased demand by
people moving in, there's the
interest rates going up, there's
the increase in uh materials.
That we've seen there's also a
shortage of labor, I think, and
then uh another factor that's
been mentioned a little bit is
the uh entitlement process, if
you will, or the planning and
zoning, the length of time it
takes to get uh to actually
building the house. So I think
those are some of the components
uh and here recently too, one of
the other factors is the
Cost of insurance has really
gone up on on homes.
Madam Chair members of the
committee, are we here to
speculate on the market or
really just to address the bill
and the funding and what we're
trying to address um with the
policies that work.
Well, Madam Chair, Senator Izzy,
I'm getting to this amount of
money, there's a lot of factors
that go into eating through all
that money.
Um, inflation, you talked about
increases in um
Building houses because of the
materials, that's, that's part
of inflation.
That's, that's my point, and I
think everyone has felt that,
including my family.
One of the things is also
regulations.
When you do just a little bit of
research, you find out here, you
can go on
Zillow.com/research/land use
regulation, Albuquerque.
is one of the most restrictive
places to build.
And that also regulations right
uh increased prices as well.
So my point is, um, is he, uh,
Senator, Madam Chair, is there's
a lot of factors that go into
the.
The housing market, whether it's
out of state people coming into
Mexico, which it is inflation,
which it is, which is um um
regulations, which it is.
And, and all those well, in my
opinion, uh disrupt community
ties and it makes it more
expensive for New Mexicans who
are.
We've been living here to to be
able to own a home or even
Rent
Um, real quick, Madam Cherry, is
he, how long is your
organization been around?
Madam Chair and Senator Block,
I'm not proud to say that we
will be celebrating our 50th
anniversary on June 26th of uh
this year.
Awesome, happy birthday. You,
you look very young.
So, thank you for that. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Um, I want to just
Talk about
The loans, I think that Senator
Scott, I don't know where he
went.
Senator Scott talked about
So you're getting, so we can
trace this back so I understand
how this whole process works. So
the state will give you a
certain percentage of this 500
million, I think it's now 15%.
Uh, that we could spend up to
And then your organization will
go out for RFPs with
municipalities and developers.
Is that correct?
Madam Chair and, uh, Senator
Block, uh, I think, uh,
We are hopeful that whatever.
The legislature approves and the
governor signs off 100% of that
will come to us, not 15%, the
15% set aside or the 15 and 15
uh total of 30 is actually just
to set aside that will be made
available to local governments,
uh, to come, we will get the
full $500 million if that's what
the legislature and the governor
approved that comes to us it's
just that the remaining part of
it will be open to other than
local governments.
OK, would that be part of the
thanks for the clarification,
sir, uh, Madam Chair.
So, but your company will
Do request for proposal RFPs for
uh loans, is that correct?
Madame Cheronen or blocked that
is uh correct.
OK.
Uh, Madam Chair, is the, uh,
those loans, I wanna make sure I
understand this, are they?
To
Um, developers.
For one of them and
municipalities.
And any personal or not?
Madam Chair and Senator Bloch,
uh, it is to, uh, organizations,
developers, municipalities, we
do not make loans available to
individuals for their personal
purchase of the house, although
we do, uh.
As close as it gets to that, if
you will, is we have a down
payment assistance program
whereby if they go and apply for
a, a mortgage, uh, and they
qualify, uh, then they would
also potentially get a down
payment assistance loan that
goes to the individual, but that
is made available to
a network of lenders we have
across the state. OK, thank you.
Uh, Madam Chair, so Izzy, when
you're, uh,
Doing RFPs on these loans for
developers. What, what type of
criteria?
Are you looking at?
Madam Chair, in uh Senator
Block, uh.
First of all, we looked at to
make sure that the developer has
the capacity and the experience
to develop.
Holmes, uh, in this, in this
particular example of a say a
single family developer. We also
make sure that they have the
capacity uh to administer the
program and that they have the
financial whereabouts that if uh
there's a development doesn't go
through that they provide
warranties to us they'll be able
to pay the funds back to make
the uh the housing trust fund
hold for the loans that were
made to them.
Um
Uh, thank you, Izzy. So Madam
Chair, any other type of uh
criteria that you score these uh
developers on at all?
Madam Chair, and, uh, Senator
block there is a
Long list, uh, of things that we
require. I don't know, I'm off
the top of my head. I will also
say that uh uh you know, some of
the things that we look at is if
they're going to build a house
that uh we request an appraisal
upfront, uh.
You know, on as built appraisal,
what's that gonna cost if they
tell us we're gonna build a home
and we're gonna sell it for, uh,
say $250,000 but the appraisal
comes back and they tell us that
our home is only gonna price for
$200,000. We take that into
account in our analysis. Uh, we
also make sure that there's a
market study done so that we
know the absorption rate is
there and if they're gonna build
100 units subdivision that
they're gonna be able to sell
those homes and it's not gonna
be something where there's not
the demand for it, but there's
Uh, other list of things on the
financial side that I just don't
know on the off the top of my
head, uh, that we could
definitely provide you the
application and things that we
look at, uh, to make you feel a
little more comfortable. Thank
you. Thank you, yeah. I don't
need that. I was just curious.
Um, it sounds to me like it is a
Uh, in equal playing field and
you guys make your decisions
based on a business decision,
because you do have taxpayer
dollars that you are responsible
for, correct?
That is, uh, Madam chair and uh
Senator Black, that is correct,
and I, I will say that in the
Uh, close to 20 year history of
the uh housing trust fund. Uh,
we've only had one loan uh go be
on us and uh we actually
recovered all of the funds from
that loan. So, uh, if you look
at the 10,000 plus families that
we've assisted. It just has a
great track record and we make
sure that these funds are used
effectively, uh, and, uh, only
to developers are gonna be able
to deliver and uh put them to
good use.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So Izzy,
when you also make these loans
to municipalities. What happens
to any of those um funds that
may not be expended. Do they go
back to the MFA or where do they
or do they stay at the min.
Madam Chair and Senator Bloch
under this particular bill, uh,
if we award funds to local
government, say a million
dollars for a particular
development and they end up only
spending $900,000. Uh, there's
a, the requirement under this
bill is that the extra $100,000
be returned to MFA at the
completion of the project.
That would go into the housing
trust fund back to the housing
trust fund. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Izzy, and
again, I just want to understand
when you make these loans to
developers, you have clawbacks
built in the um
Built into the uh the loan
agreement. Is that fair to say?
Madam Chair, and Senator Block,
you are correct.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
Is he
These, what's, what's the
current when you are
Loaning the money out.
Is it a standardized rate, or do
you guys look at um
municipalities differently and
developers differently when it
comes to the rates.
Madame Macherina Senator Blanca,
we do not currently different
differentiate between uh
municipalities and other
developers out there in this
case, uh,
We've never had a set aside for
local governments before, so in
this case, the local governments
would come in and apply, uh, and
get the funds, they will tell us
in their application how they
propose to use those funds where
it's for single family or
multifamily development and give
us a structure of how they're
gonna use those funds, uh, to,
to make sure that uh
You know, they're
They're using in each of those
areas, so they're, we're, I
don't foresee us charging the
municipalities an interest rate.
As they were redeveloping their
programs and they're gonna be
charging the interest rate on
that housing trust fund on the
funds that they're successful at
obtaining from the housing Trust
Fund.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So Izzy,
I, I.
I want to make sure I understood
that right.
So you are
You're gonna be
Transferring the money from MFA
to a municipality.
But the municipality would have
the loan in charge an interest
rate to the developer. Did, did
I understand you correctly, did
you also say you've never done
loans to municipalities before?
Madam Chair, and uh Senator
Block, we have made loans to
municipalities before uh but we
have not had a set aside under
the housing trust fund, which is
what this proposing that we have
an actual set aside for the
local governments in this case,
uh, and I'm gonna use Mr.
Montoya sitting here to, to my
right. They may apply under the
city of Albuquerque and say out
of that set aside, we want $5
million that we're going to use
to do uh uh rental development
in due gap.
financing under that structure,
they're gonna tell us we're
gonna make uh
You know, say to
Say 5 awards at a million
dollars each to developers in
the city of Albuquerque area and
we're going to charge X amount
of interest rate.
Uh, and that's gonna generate
some programming income for the
developments and that $5 million
pot that's the city of
Albuquerque has.
Um, does that explain it a
little bit better, that's uh
yes, sir, Madam Chair, um, it
does a little bit and I'm trying
to, I just wanna make sure I
understand the process.
Um, thoroughly here before I I
make a decision because I also
want to just uh chat real quick
about the fund itself.
Uh, you said this fund started
50 years ago.
Madam Chair and uh Senator
Block, uh, no, it started in
2005, so, uh, about uh 20 years
ago.
OK, thank you, uh, Madam Chair,
thank you, Izzy for that.
So,
I is the fund?
You know, you get spikes, spikes
and lows in the market.
And then you'll also get um
supply and demand for the
municipalities and the
developers as well.
Do you for how, how financially
secure is this?
I just um trust fund.
They in the near mid and far
term.
Madam Chair and Senator B block,
uh,
You know, the, I think maybe the
uh
The title of the trust one
calling it a trust fund is a
little misleading in that we do
not, uh,
Put money into this fund and
only work off of the interest
that it earns, we actually put
the entire money out there
available for awards. So if we
were to, uh, I gave you the
example, uh, a little earlier of
$122 million that that was made
available to us versus 3
different funding sources in the
last 18 months. We've put that
all of that money out there
available and we've awarded or
encumbered $109 million of that.
Uh, so that'll generate.
Some programming come over the
life of that, and I give the
example of uh 42 million with uh
$27 million investment over 18
years a little earlier.
So
What we envision, uh, if you
invest $500 million into this.
Trust fund is that we
But the RFPs out there, uh, and
have developers come in or local
governments come in and uh
request those funds. Uh, we have
projections that might be in
your that are in your FIR that
indicate that our projections
that we could use the first year
about $246 million and about
$250 million that second year.
All those monies would go out in
a loans, uh, and start
generating income. We do have,
uh, as you may be aware, um,
Some recurring money coming into
the housing Trust Fund under the
severance tax bond capacity
2.5%.
The first year of that, which
was, uh, July of 23, we received
$37 million.
Uh, July of last year, we
received $34 million and uh we
anticipate this coming year,
there may be between 30 and $40
million. So we do have a
recurring source of funds coming
into this, but uh definitely not
enough to meet the, the need out
there, which is the reason we're
here before you to request
additional appropriations
towards the housing trust fund.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So Izzy,
what you're telling me is you
are not a
Um
Self-sustaining organization,
you're, you're gonna need some
more funding.
Down the road, is that correct?
Madam Chair, in uh Senator
Block, uh, house in New Mexico
is a self-sustaining
organization, uh, we have 40
different uh programs to address
the full continuum of uh
housing, uh, this is one of the
funding sources here is the
housing trust fund that allows
us to do some of the activities
that have been before you here,
uh, the other one that I
mentioned earlier, uh, is our
first time homebuyer program
where we issue tax-exempt bonds
we do between 4 to 500.
0 $0 million a year and make
loans, uh, you know, over 2000
loans a year to first-time home
buyers. That is a different
program, uh, that we don't come
to the legislature for funding
for this is just one of the very
few activities where we come to
the legislature uh to request
funding for that allow, gives us
more flexibility as you might
imagine than some of the federal
dollars that we receive.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Izzy.
But the reason I say that is
right now oil is about $69 a
barrel.
And
If oil drops to
You know, say,
Save $40 say even $50. I mean,
that's a huge hit for revenue in
the state of New Mexico.
So how does the oil and gas
revenues.
Uh, Madam chair and Izzy.
How do you plan for that?
Um, when, when this is such a,
it could be potentially a
volatile market.
Where we have all these trust
funds in the state of New Mexico
that we, you know, theoretically
or legally, whatever you want to
call it, constitutionally can't
touch.
And then all of a sudden,
Oil just tanks for whatever
reason. There's a glut on the
market of oil, prices dropped.
How does that affect
Um, how does that affect you and
the Mexico finance or mortgage.
Your, what do you guys call uh
New Mexico mortgage Finance
Authority?
Uh, Madame Macherina cinder
block, it's a New Mexico
mortgage Finance Authority
legally or uh we rebranded to
house in New Mexico. So, some
very uh good questions there uh
and uh with regard to the oil
industry and how it may impact
us. Currently the way we are.
Reliant on that directly is
through the severance tax bonds
and getting 2.5% of the
severance tax bond capacity. So
if the revenues that are
generated there go down uh in
the 2.5% would be a much lesser
instead of getting, say, $37
million we may be down to.
15 $20 million depending on how
far uh uh down the, the oil
goes, uh, so those are things
that we would look at and uh
then we would come to when
we're, if we're that that is the
only source of funds that we're
receiving into the housing Trust
Fund, uh, then we would have to
make some tough decisions and
prioritize, uh, you know, the
Senator Nava asked some
questions about how we
prioritize and uh we'd have to
make some tough decisions at
that point and figure out how we
limit and uh what awards we make
and the amounts of uh awards
that we make and uh hopefully by
that.
Point that we've had uh
Some programming can be
generated that's gonna
supplement and continue to
supplement the allocations that
are coming from the recurring
funds.
Um, Madam Chair, Izzy, I agree
100%. The reason why you're, you
would have to prioritize.
Is your private business, like
other private businesses have to
figure out, you know,
Holy crap, this is, this is a
bad economy. There's more rules
or regulations coming down and
we just can't.
Businesses just can't go out and
get money.
The government can, can go out
and get money very easily and
print it, it can tax you, it can
do different things.
Um
Lastly
Madam Chair and Izzy.
How, how do we know you're doing
well, Madam Ma chair in uh
Senator Block, uh.
You know, I'm, I'm proud to say
that we have a uh.
A, a lot of uh
First of all, we have a 50 year
proven track record, uh.
Uh, of what we've been doing as
an organization, uh, secondly,
we have very strong oversight.
I, I mentioned our uh very
strong board of directors, which
includes a lieutenant Governor,
Attorney general, state
treasurer, and Ford members
appointed by the governor, we
also have a legislative
oversight committee, uh, that
meets and we report to them. We
provide reports to LSC to DFA
and all of the various funding
sources that we have, we have a,
I mentioned that we get at a
minimum 12 different audits on
an annual basis.
Uh, and very proud to, to say
that with a strong team that we
have, um, that, that we have 3
decades of unmodified audits, so
we're doing well as an
organization. We have a good
infrastructure, uh good systems
in place that we.
I want to make sure that we
maintain, uh, and we're also uh
always looking for innovation
and change, uh, to make sure
that we stay at the, at the top
of our game, if you will, uh,
and with the reporting
requirements that we have and
the board that we have, we know
we will maintain that.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Izzy. So, so what's your,
what's your goal for
homeownership in New Mexico?
What's the mission? What's the
goal of, of your organization.
New Mexican for New Mexican
homeownership.
Madam Chair, in uh Senator
block, uh, you know, our vision
is that uh all New Mexicans will
have affordable housing
opportunities, uh, ideally, we
can get everybody into home
ownership because we believe
that housing and home ownership
is uh the foundation for strong,
uh, communities, uh, and strong
families, uh, realistically, we
know that some people are not
there yet. Some people are, uh,
without homes and in shelters,
so getting those folks that are
currently uh unsheltered into a
shelters and the.
supportive services that'll help
keep them there. There's people
that are currently in uh the
rental market, uh, that we hope
will graduate and make enough
income and uh I get financially
in a position where they can
purchase a home ideally for me,
uh, we, I think we're currently
one of the states that has a
high one of the highest
homeownership rates, uh, but,
uh, maybe 71% or so, the nations
in the 60s, uh, it'd be nice to
see us get up close to the, to
the 80s, uh, it's not gonna
happen overnight, but I think
the opportunities that we offer.
Hopefully we can tame some of
this uh inflation and uh
provides some entry level homes
so we, we can get there. That
would be the ideal goal, but not
something that's gonna happen
overnight. Well, thank you,
Madam Chair and Izzy, I gotta
tell you, you did your homework
because the latest numbers is
70.3%, so you're off by 0.7%,
which is unacceptable, but I'll
accept that one, OK? Madam
Chair, um, Senator, it's really
under our purview that this was
created. I think the goal is
really our goal as a state
legislature to put people in
housing.
and make sure their house.
And, and then lastly, Madam
Chair and Izzy, and you, you
probably know this, but, you
know, maybe the crowd doesn't.
In 2008, we were at 70.4% for
homeownership when the big uh
Great Recession happened and we
dropped down.
To a low of 66.3 in 2014.
And
Interesting is COVID, we are at
70.3, and then we dropped and
then we gained and now we
dropped again to 70.3, so, um,
I, uh, I just want to thank, uh,
You for answering all my
questions and Senator Pinto for
uh being there to answer those
as well.
Um
It's a lot of money and it's the
problem, um, Izzy is that we
don't know what's gonna happen
in the next 5 years with oil and
gas, and we have
Expanded our budget tremendously
with a lot of recurring
spending, and that should keep
people up at night because we're
underwater on er and we'll talk
about Per here soon, so.
Izzy, I appreciate everything
you're doing and put people in
houses. Thank you. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Block, and
you might be interested in uh
during the interim.
You do have an opportunity to
ask your leadership.
Um, to be assigned a certain
interim committees, and I think
you would be a wonderful member
on the uh mortgage finance
Authority oversight interim
committee.
Your questions are spot on for
what the oversight does.
No, I love numbers.
Well, this is a good numbers
committee.
That's for sure. Uh, other
questions, um, Senator Gallegos,
and then Senator Charlie.
Madam Chair, thank you, Senator
Izzy, I appreciate it. Uh, I was
going through some of the fiscal
impact and and it's got uh er
talks about significant issues.
One of them talks about
investing in innovative
affordable housing projects you
brought up earlier that we both
have in our areas some projects,
but I want to go back in time
just to ask on on this.
Point, uh, is this going into
city and counties for
infrastructure for housing
development.
Inur center.
Madam Cha and uh Senator
Gallegos, we have made some
loans here recently, uh, not to
actual local governments, uh,
but to, uh,
Some developers, uh, that are
using the funds for uh
infrastructure, uh, one of them
right in your area.
Uh, OS 40, I believe, a single
family, uh, manufactured housing
development, um, in Lee County,
uh, and they're gonna use the
money to do some infrastructure
on some land and eventually uh
over 3 phases, I think 239
manufactured homes that'll be
placed there. Those money can be
used for infrastructure. We
haven't done a whole lot of
that. It's mostly been the, the
vertical construction, but it is
eligible in some communities or
developers have taken advantage
of that?
Thank them and churen uh Senator
and Izzy, so on the.
A 15%.
What does it go to?
As far as the
Uh, counties
And uh municipalities.
Madame Chair and uh Senator
Gallegos, that is gonna be, uh,
that is pretty wide open, uh.
It'll be dependent on what that
local government or uh.
Uh, municipality request and
what they want to do with those
funds, they could say we want to
use it to build infrastructure
for a subdivision, single family
or we're gonna use it to build
uh uh a rental uh complex or
we're gonna use it to uh
You know, do other things within
the community, uh, there, so,
uh, it's wide open, uh, as long
as it's affordable housing and
it fits with some of the
criteria of the housing trust
fund, uh, they have some
flexibility, uh, based on their
needs to request the the
funding, uh, and for the
purposes of what they want to
use it for.
Thank for that
man
Senorizzi, so going back in time
in 2012 before I ran for the
legislature, we did a
subdivision in Lovington.
Mexico. First time in 25 years,
but at that time, uh the city
and county.
Would give $4000.
Towards the lot.
Uh, it helped us as the
developer.
To put in the infrastructure
pieces, but the money had to
come off of the total value of
the lot, so the homeowner is the
one that got the benefit.
Is that something that this
would allow?
I sooner and easy.
Madam Chair and uh Senator
Gallegos without knowing the
details and uh with the uh
limited facts that you gave me.
I, I believe there's a program
that can be structured to do
something like that to lower the
price of the cost of the house
for a for a family.
Yes.
And Senator and Izzy, I like
that because it's uh one of
those things that would.
Ultimately does go into
infrastructure which is uh
pretty important for every city
and county member Senator E on
just uh wondering how did you
come up with the 15%. I, I know
you went from 10 to 15%. There's
a large amount of money here.
And I think if it were in the
hands of the cities and counties
it could go further in just
about infrastructure you've got
places around the state that
have water and sewer issues, and
if they were able to do some
important things on trying to
get uh subdivision or low income
housing in the area would help
them with that infrastructure.
And insurance center is.
Madam Chair and Senator
Gallegosa, I agree with you,
the, uh, the need is a vast and
uh infrastructure is very
costly, uh, we started out with
a 10% set aside. This is the
first time we've done something
like this. Uh, it's been
negotiated up to 30% now, which
is the 15 and the 15, um, I, I
think I did mention earlier that
uh
Local governments have applied
in the past without to set aside
and uh they have the ability to
come in even if that's set aside
is exceeded and say for example,
the 30% is used between all the
local governments, that does not
preclude them as funds are
available to come in and request
more funds. I will remind uh uh
you senator, that uh last year
there was a a bill that was
passed, I don't remember the
name of it, but it was the
Opportunity Enterprise Fund,
$125 million was allocated.
c ated towards the New Mexico.
Finance Authority, which is
different than us, a similar
names, uh, but, uh, one of the
focuses under those funding
sources or that funding source
was to do infrastructure, uh, so
that could be a way for us to
leverage our funding with the
opportunity enterprise fund to
be able to get a full
development and then uh focusing
on the infrastructure.
Thank for them in turn.
Senator Izzy and and I
appreciate that there's other
opportunities out there, um, I,
I actually liked, um, both of
the amendment.
Uh, because I like to go from 10
to 15% so I saw the math and so
how little actually goes to the
uh cities and counties on their
infrastructure.
Uh, I do have one final
question, Madam Chair.
Senator Izzy, uh, so being a
developer and
And I, that's my daytime job. I
don't.
Uh, go to the job sites. I do
stuff in the house, uh, or we
can be required.
Uh, to pay for some of the uh
The sewage, the iron, the, uh,
cost.
Uh, thinking about impact fees
and and what it does to the um
developer and or the community.
Does this bill help us in any of
that?
Madam Chair and Senator
Gallego's, uh, this bill does
not help you with that, although
it could provide funding that
would pay for some of that
infrastructure. I think the uh
The Affordable Housing Act,
which is a bill we discussed
earlier, allows local
governments to waive some of
those fees and some local
governments have done that as
part of that $117 million that
they've invested in over uh the,
the course of that uh that act,
but it would be up to each
individual local government or
community to determine if they
want to waive some of those
fees, uh, this money here could
help pay for some or all of
those feeses, that's what the
proposal is that comes in.
For us to really
I'm chairing center and easy
just I promised this the last
one.
I, I think it'd be important for
us to look at the amount, you
know, the 15%, uh, because it's
a pretty big hit.
If those costs go down to the
consumers.
Uh, you know, you think about it
when you're building a home and
all your costs are yours.
But ultimately, if you're doing
city.
Or counting
And so I think the more you give
to the uh local entities able to
absorb those costs, the better
it'll be for the homeowner. The
reality will be drop that cost
for the uh process so that it is
actually affordable. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you, Izzy.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator. Um,
I I was able to scan through the
uh.
72 page audit on your website.
Well folks were talking and I
had a couple of questions.
Um, related to that, so it looks
like the housing, um, I'm sorry,
I and I really apologize for
this. Tell me what MFA has been
renamed to.
Uh, Madam Chair, and, uh,
Senator Charlie, I'm sorry, your
question was to what what is the
name that MFE has changed to?
Oh, I'm sorry, Madam Chair and
uh Senator Charlie is housing,
New Mexico. New Mexico. OK,
thank you. Um, and in here it's,
it says that housing New Mexico
utilizes the 10% deminimis rate
for administrative overhead, is
that correct?
Madama chair and Senator
Charlie.
We do that, and I think that is
with respect to a lot of the
federal programs uh that are out
there that require a de minimis
rate or to uh for us to
determine that, uh, that is a
little bit different with each
of the funding sources and if
you'd like, I can give you some
details on the housing trust
fund and what we use there.
Um, well, Madam Chair and
Senator and Izzy, I, what I'd be
really curious about is what is
that overhead rate for this.
$500 million. OK.
Uh
Madam Chair and uh Senator
Charlie, uh, the housing Trust
Fund Act allows 5% of
administrative be to go to house
in New Mexico. Uh, we looked up
some numbers in anticipation of
this potential question and over
the life of the program.
Uh
Plus to 20 years now, we've only
instead of the 5%, we've only
been able to use or we've only
charged the program 2.1%, so
less than half of what is
allowed. Uh, we only use it to
pay for the expenses that we
actually have, we don't make any
profit off of it, but we do pay
for our expenses with it and at
this point it's 2.1% versus the
5% that is allowed.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator,
and Izzy. So with my quick math
here, 5% would be $25 million
overhead, but the rate that you
utilize the little bit more than
1, 2%. It's 10,500 for overhead.
Is that correct?
Madam Chair and ener Charlie
that your math is, uh, correct,
I will say that uh we have
programs in place now, so we're
not going to be developing new
programs, so I would anticipate
that the larger the dollar
amount, uh, that we have that
percentage will continue to go
down, um.
So
That would be uh my, my
projection at this point.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator,
and Izzy. So why did we just
approve $500,000 to administer
this if you're utilizing a 2%
administration rate.
Adam Chair.
Madama chair and Senator Charlie
uh
the there's probably a little
bit of confusion, so the uh the
housing trust Fund Act passed in
2005 has a 5% administrative.
Be that it allows, uh.
The affordable housing Act,
which was sent to Bill 144, 2
different things to different
activities, uh, not, uh.
Yeah, separate entities, uh
separate activities if you will.
OK, Adam Terr and Senator and
Izzy, thank you for that. Um,
also in getting into the
financials.
stated that you do about 18% of
your loans you sell off.
To secondary markets. Could you
talk a little bit about that?
If it is applicable to this $500
million investment.
Madame Mache and Senator
Charlie, uh, I don't have that
uh report right in front of me
that you're looking at, but I
will say that uh we have many
different uh programs that are
uh program that we're mostly
known for and what we were
initially created for was I
think the program that you're
referring to, which is our first
time homebuyer program. We issue
mortgage revenue bonds, uh, once
those loans are made, we pull
them together and we sell them
off into the secondary market,
uh, I'm unsure on that
percentage there because I would
say that uh probably 90
9 % of our loans we sell off
into the secondary market,
they're securitized with uh
Fannie Mae or Jenny May, um.
The way that is related to this
fund is that we do provide some
down payment assistance that
would come from the housing
Trust Fund, uh, those loans are
serviced internally. Those are
not serviced or those are not
sold off. Those are kept in
within the confines of the
housing trust fund and we
service those loans internally.
They are not sold off to the
secondary market.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair,
Senator and Izzy, um.
And from what I can tell, just
this quick scan, it looks like
the housing New Mexico Agency is
working hard to diversify,
including selling $70 million of
bonds that look like it happened
in December of last year. When
will you see the returns on
those investments, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair and, uh, Senator
Charlie, the, uh
What on a annual basis, uh,
We get allocations for private
activity, bond cap from the
state Board of Finance or tax
exempt bonds, uh, last year we
issued about 3040 $350 million
in tax exempt bonds.
We blend those with some taxable
bonds, so in total we did over
$500 million in taxable bonds.
The way the bonds work uh is we
are allowed a uh.
Um
A profit, if you will, uh, of
1.18%. We don't always hit that
top there, sometimes it's lower
than 1%. It's like an annuity
once we issue the bonds, uh, and
the loans start making payments
we can keep a certain part of
it, so that those bonds, 70
million that you mentioned, uh,
will probably be getting some
annuities over the next 10 to 15
years from those bonds that were
issued, if you multiply that
times 5, 500 million that we did
on doing on an annual basis.
if you will, and over the last,
uh,
Uh, 10 years, that's kind of the
driver of some of the income
that we get that allows us to
invest into other parts of uh
the housing spectrum.
That's helpful, Madam Chair, um,
and senator and Izzy, thank you.
Um.
But what I'm, what is your
annual operating Madam Chair and
uh Senator Charlie, uh, I don't
have that off. I think it's uh
we're at about 2.
Uh, $4 million operating a
budget.
Uh, Madam chair, Senator and
Izzy, thank you. So this is
gonna be a nice boost to your
budget. Um, I think, and, and
it's needed. I, I don't mean it
facetiously at all, but one
question I do have that was in
your audit. It looks like
there's some pending li
litigation right now to New
Mexico housing in New Mexico,
and I want to ensure that.
In no way, shape or form will
this $500 million investment
into the agency program and all
of its intents and purposes will
be affected by that pending
litigation.
Madame Chair and uh Senator
Charlie, I want to go back a
little bit if you don't mind on
our budget. Those are operating
budget expenses, those are, do
not take into account the
programmatic money that uh that
we have for programs, so the
$500 million would not be part
of our operating budget, uh,
that $500 million is part of the
housing trust fund that gets
accounted for separately and
independently, a similar to the
500 million in mortgage revenue
bonds that I mentioned earlier.
So
$24 million are are expenses and
operating aside from
programmatic uh funds, Madam
Chair, Senator and Izzy, I've
run nonprofits before, so when I
asked for an agency budget, I
wanna know, um.
Program at the whole thing that,
that's a helpful number to me.
OK, and I apologize, Madam Chair
and I Senator Charlie. So, uh,
the total operating budget that
we had last year was about $736
million with all of the various
programs that, uh, that we have.
Uh, madam, uh, chair and uh
Senator Charlie with regard to
the pending litigation, uh, you
stumped me there. I am not aware
of a pending litigation that we
have, so I'd be happy to talk to
you right after this, so maybe
you can
Point me there, but uh it is uh.
Whatever it may be that you have
in front of you there is not a
significant and not something
that impacts our operations in
the way we administer our
programs.
Oh, Madam Chair, Senator and
Izzy, thank you. I'll find it in
here and share it with you.
Um, that I, that's it, Madam
Chair.
So is that all, Senator?
OK.
We are on a do pass motion.
And a second, I'm sorry,
Senator, please short and sweet.
We do have several other
measures to still try to get
through today. I will. Thank
you, Madam Chair Senator and
Izzy, just really quickly, uh,
has gone through the list of,
you know, all the opportunities
you have the down payments, the
single file family homes the.
Um, rehabs, and I'm just
wondering if you have any
guarantees I didn't read them in
the bill that any of these would
go to New Mexico developers, is
there any guidance you can give
us to have it in, uh, something
you guys have in your rules, or
are these going to outside state
entities.
And insurance center.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Gallego's uh, there is no
guarantees that this goes to
reinstate uh developers. I will
tell you that the vast majority
of what we've done have been
some uh to developers in the
state, there have been some
awards that we've made to
investors and people uh
developers that come from out of
state. The good thing about that
is that we're bringing external
capital from outside the state
to develop apartment complexes
here in the state where it's
much needed, so I see that as an
actual positive that we're
attracting money from outside.
the state to come and build here
but uh we do not uh.
Uh
Disallow uh investors from
outside the state to come in
here and obtain some of these
funds.
In humanitarian Izzy, I was just
hoping you had percentages, but
I'll yield with that. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you.
And Senator Charlie, you might
be interested also in
petitioning to be on the
oversight committee for, oh, OK,
all right.
I know.
Anyway, we are on a do pass
motion and a second, if you
could call the roll, please.
Senator Block.
No, to explain my vote.
Senator Boone, Senator Charley.
Yes.
Gallegos. No, ma'am.
In our nova, yes.
Senor Pinto Senator Scott.
Senator Cer Lopez, yes.
And her hickey.
Yes
And our Lopez.
Yes
I vote by a vote of 6 to 3, you
have a due pass recommendations.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair and members of the
committee.
On Amanda.
Oh, I apologize. Just a minute.
My bad. Senator Block wanted to
explain his vote. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Um, Izzy, first of
all, great job on answering the
questions, but I have some deep
concerns about the future
financial viability of this. I'd
like you to come by the office
to talk to me as well. And
Senator Gallegas' uh questions
regarding
Um
Um
I would prefer, I'd like to know
what the percentages are for New
Mexico developers as well as the
impact fees are a huge concern,
especially in Rio Rancho. So not
saying I'm gonna be a no on the
Senate floor, but there's a lot
more information I'd like to get
from you in my office. Thank
you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you.
We'll go on to Senate Bill 216,
so my vice chair, Senator Hickey
will be running the committee.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
And
Senator, uh, Lopez and Cedillo
Lopez, are you going up as well?
Very good.
I
Senator Lopez, the floor is
yours.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair
and members of the committee.
Um, I sit here 216.
Um.
Yeah.
We are attempting to do with
this.
Measure is just.
Simply
Uh, to remove the prohibition.
Or rent control.
And Mr. Chair, you do have in
front of you a little sheet of
paper.
Because as is statutory
structure.
Um, we just list in the bill
itself what sections of law that
we are to.
Repeal
So the language that was handed
out for you.
Um, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee.
is a simple, um.
For the wording of what we are
striking ready for.
Consideration
And essentially, Mr. Chair, it's
uh removing the, the control,
the the prohibition on rent
control for a discussion in any
political subdivision.
Or any home rule municipality.
Where they could um enact an
ordinance or resolution.
That controls you would have the
effect of controlling rental
rates for privately owned.
Uh, property, rental property.
So, um, Mr. Chair, who I have
here with me.
You can also add um.
Some more testimony is
Beckhampton, who is here on my
right, and then is it it's Lila
Nezar.
On my left, you will also, if I
could, Mr. Chair, say a few
words about the bill.
Welcome to the committee.
Thank you so much for having us,
Mrs. Chairman and senators. Um,
so my name is Liaizar. I am a um
community organizer with the
People's Housing Project, which
is an all grassroots
organization. Um, we're all
volunteers, no one gets paid to
do this work. I'm also a
lifelong New Mexican lifelong
burkenya and um Senate Bill 216
is simple. It is a bill that
would strike the current ban on
rent control in New Mexico,
striking this bill would restore
the democratic right to all New
Mexicans to pursue rent control
in their city. This bill,
importantly, does not enact rent
control. It is simply a repeal.
on the undemocratic prohibition
of rent control established in
1991 that denies New Mexicans
the freedom to use rent control,
rent control as a tool to
address the housing crisis in
their local communities. Thank
you. Hi. Oh, sorry. Um, yes, my
name is Beck Hampton. Uh, great
to see all of you, Mr. Chair,
and um all the Senate committee
members, like Lila and Senator
Lopez have made very clear, it's
a very simple bill. It does not
enact rent control, um, but it
gives us the
right to have it in our local
communities to be able to
address whatever local
conditions um for housing, um,
that we have, like, for example,
in Albuquerque in District 2
where I live, uh, myself and,
um, my peers were struggling,
uh, to afford rent, and we, we
love New Mexico. We don't want
to be displaced, um, and it's,
it's just difficult to even
enjoy our lives because we spend
so much money on rent that it's
actually um
Harder and harder to not just
buy food, but also spend money
elsewhere, which we believe is
negatively impacting really.
A variety of different um
businesses. We think it's um
unfair and undemocratic that
this law is um intact and the
rent control is prohibited, um,
and we really hope that um this
committee, this year can get
this bill through, and thank you
all so much.
Mr. Chair, I'd just like to add
a little bit more.
As we were talking about
housing, if you haven't noticed,
there's a theme for today.
Um, it's important for us to
talk about affordable housing,
which is important for our
communities across the state of
New Mexico.
But there's also another group
of persons who don't own a home.
And who are renting
And it, it could be a single
families, it could be a single
person.
It could also be those of us who
are older.
And Mr. Chair, I know I've had,
as we just finished a campaign
season, I had an opportunity to
knock on doors for some of the
um.
Women primarily in my community
who live in an apartment.
And they shared with me the
story and showed me exactly how
much since they had.
First rented the the apartment
is how much the rent has gone up
in the last 3 years.
They're on a fixed income and
there are many of us across the
state who are in that.
Cohort, as I say, Mister Chair.
That really um would appreciate,
I think an opportunity for their
local government to begin to
have a discussion as to what
else do we offer for those in
our community for some relief.
Um, so I think that's what we're
here for, Mr. Chair, and, uh.
We'll stand for questions.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, for presenting this bill.
Uh, can we see the hands of
those who are in support in the
audience.
OK.
And you self-select about 5 of
you.
We, there are about 10 hands to
come up and make your comments,
please.
And when you are making your
comment, try and keep it to just
2 minutes. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chair, uh, members of the
committee, my name is Dylan
Schweegel.
I am the uh president of
Allianzsa tenant union based in
Espanola to the north of here,
um, Espanola in recent years has
been hit hard by the housing
crisis, especially at the uh the
three major affordable housing
complexes that we have up there,
2 of them, uh, one of them is,
uh, shut down and the other one
partially shut down due to
mismanagement by the uh out of
state company that owns it, that
leaves the complex where our
members either currently or
formerly reside, that being
less.
apartments, um, in the past few
years since the uh company based
in Utah had acquired that
property. We've seen our rent at
Las Lomas increase, uh, roughly
100%.
Um, in the last 4 years, um,
what 2 or 3 bedrooms that had
previously gone from roughly
6000 to 800 now being anywhere
from uh 130 to 1600, um, with
the expectation that with each
lease renewal that's going to
increase by $100 each time. And
so that means that the clock is
ticking for many of our
neighbors as to uh when they'll
be able to afford to live there
and certainly in the past 4
years, um, we're not paying for
any improvement in quality or
improvement in the grounds or
anything like that.
Um, the consequence of this has
been that we've already seen
many of our neighbors.
Priced out of the apartments
priced out of Espanola in
general. Espanola being uh a
community that has struggled
with generational poverty, the
housing crisis has created a new
wrinkle that's really disrupting
the delicate balance there.
We've seen many members of our
community, um, left destitute,
um, stranded, stuck between
these housing markets, um.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello, uh, my name is Eric
Vicente Eller Reed White. I'm a
Santa Fe resident. I also
volunteer with the People's
Housing Project and I have my
family has been here in Santa Fe
for many, many generations, and
those around me that I've grown
up with have often been priced
out of Santa Fe. Most of them
are renters and many of the
people I grew up with have
either had to move to different
cities within New Mexico or out
of the state, uh, just because
of the affordability of housing.
So this is an issue I care
deeply about just because I
would like New Mexico residents
that have a deep tie to the
history and culture here to be
able to continue living here,
and thank you for hearing our
comments today.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Senators. My
name is Alex Stevenson. I'm a
resident of Albuquerque, um, a
father of 3, local community
organizer. Been living in New
Mexico for 14 years, and
frankly, I'm angry to discover
the existence of the law that
this bill is trying to repeal.
I didn't know until recently
that not only is there no rent
control in my community, but in
fact, there's a state law
prohibiting the establishment
of, of such a measure.
Now, I'm aware that the
establishment of rent control
itself is a contentious process
with lots of public debate,
probably heated arguments and
such, not really relevant to
this bill. This bill is not
implementing any sort of uh ring
control policies, specifically,
merely repeals this law
prohibiting local communities
from making their own choices
and enacting such policies, and
frankly, I'm perplexed at how
this law ever came into
existence in the first place.
Apparently it happened in 1991
when I was 4 years old, so maybe
other people can speak to the
conditions.
Of that time, but frankly, the
law is or this bill is just a
baby step towards meeting the
needs and giving dignity to the
people of the state.
Uh, in the 14 years since I've
lived here, I've noticed every
year there are more and more
people panhandling intersections
and that breaks my heart. These
people, they get blamed for
personal choices, but as we've
heard, they're more victims of a
system that doesn't value their
humanity. We all know about how
the uh cost of living, the cost
of uh housing has gone up much
faster than wages have gone up
in the past several decades, and
frankly, this brings up larger
connects uh questions that
society has.
to address such as understanding
that housing is not an asset to
be invested in, but a basic
human need that a decent society
would provide for all of its
members.
By keeping laws on the books
like this, the people of our
state are simply not being
served and the time to start
listening to, to the needs of
the people and empower them to
make their own decisions is now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Kristen Foy and I
am a strong Ayai crew member and
I've been doing my job for well
over 10 years.
So rent control saves lives, but
I'm not here today to speak
about enacting rent control. I
am here to beg you to allow the
prohibition to be lifted so we
can have the tools.
To give this community that
empowers, empowers it and
improves their quality of life.
We need to take responsibility
and do something for the quality
of life in New Mexico now, and
this is one of the first steps.
As a strong union member and
future union organizer, I have
been a safe place for many
concerns for myazi comrades. I'm
also in a high profile job
position where am I in the ear
of talent as well as producers
and directors. So I hear it all
and more often than not, when
the out of town crew comes to
New Mexico, they are shocked at
how dangerous it is in
Albuquerque. How many houses
folks don't have access to a
bathroom and how much they would
want to move here, but the
biggest deterrent is the state
of the city of Albuquerque,
as well as how high the rent is.
And both are intrinsically
connected. The lack of safety is
due to us leaving citizens
behind when they couldn't afford
their rent. What we're asking
today is that you make a
decision that opens the
conversation. New Mexico
deserves better than what we are
being provided. The state, this
state is full of hardworking
people with big dreams. Don't we
have an obligation to provide
opportunity for a better life.
What a better gift to give them
than the promise of taking care
of our community, a legacy you
can start today. Abolish the
prohibition on rent control.
Give this community what it
deserves, which is the ability
to democratically ensure
citizens have their basic human
rights. Thank you.
And
Try and keep your comments to 2
minutes.
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Noranisa Tan. I'm
a resident of Santa Fe and a
volunteer with the People's
housing project. I'm here to
express support for SB 216. I'm
alarmed by the housing crisis
that continues to grow across
New Mexico. About half of New
Mexico renters are cost
burdened, meaning that they
spend more than.
A third of their income on rent.
This burden is even more severe
in cities like Albuquerque and
Santa Fe, wherever half of
renters fall into this category.
The home security of New Mexican
residents shouldn't depend on
the goodwill of landlords whose
main priority is to profit.
Individuals and families are
having to move from home to
home, apartment to apartment,
because I can't keep up, keep up
with the continuous rise of rent
costs.
The connection between
skyrocketing rents and rising
homelessness is undeniable.
Since 2015, New Mexico is ranked
among the top states
experiencing an increase in
homelessness, with a staggering
20% rise in just 2024.
As rents outpace incomes,
especially for lower income
households, more and more of our
neighbors are left without
stable housing.
I'm a filmmaker and I've worked
on multimedia projects about
displacement in Santa Fe and
worked on a video project.
With the Santa Fe habitat for
humanity, and repeatedly heard
stories of of families having to
relocate multiple times because
they simply cannot afford.
The increase in rent.
SB 216 is an important step
towards giving
Municipalities the power to
address the crisis head on.
Housing stability is essential
for the health, safety and
prosperity of our communities
and local leaders must have the
tools to prevent future
displacement and homelessness. I
urge you to vote yes to SB 216,
and I stand with New Mexicans
striving for affordable and
secure housing. Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, I'd like to go online or
people who are in support of the
bill.
OK, and Beverly Neil Clinton,
Neil Clinton.
And support
Good afternoon. My name, good
afternoon, Madam Chair and
members of the committee.
My name is Beverly Neil Clinton,
and I'm a proud member of the
Veterans and Military Families
Caucus, which is a caucus of
more than 560+ members.
I rise in support of SB 216.
I'm here today to urge you to
support Senate Bill 216 because
no veteran, no hardworking New
Mexican should have to choose
between paying rent and putting
food on the table.
Like many others who've served
our country, we demonstrate the
values of discipline, sacrifice,
and taking care of my sisters
and brothers.
I see how the rising cost of
rent is pushing too many of my
fellow veterans and neighbors to
the brink of homelessness.
Many live on fixed incomes, and
when rents skyrocket without
limits. They have nowhere to
turn.
SB 216 doesn't force rent
control on anyone. It simply
gives local communities the
freedom to make their own
decisions. It's ultimately about
letting cities and towns decide
how to protect their most
vulnerable residents, including
veterans who fought for this
country.
I ask you to stand with us,
stand with those who served and
passed SB 216.
Give our community the power to
keep the housing affordable for
those who defended our freedoms.
Thank you for allowing me to
testify, and again, we urge that
you vote in favor of passing SB
216.
Thank you very much. Next is
Bernadette Hardy.
And after that to get ready is
ED. But now Bernadette Hardy,
please.
Uh, hello committee members,
chair, and, uh, my name is Berna
Hardy. I'm here with uh, can you
hear me?
Hello?
Yeah
Yes.
Oh, sorry, I heard something.
Um, so I'm here with the
animative vote as a lobbyist,
but I'm also here as a community
member of District 17. Um, I
live in the international
district, which most people, you
know, sometimes that derogatory
term of the, the war zone, which
is mostly renters and my story
is not different from many of
them. Um, I'm an urban native
that lives in the International
District, um, I lived in an
apartment off of Valencia, which
was like $740 and a developer
from
Arizona came in and purchased
the whole apartment complex, not
only my apartment complex, but a
couple of others in the area of,
of, um, South San Pedro
neighborhood. They raised my
rent to 1600, which was more
than double, um,
They didn't, they, and it was
really strange because we used
to pay with checks, a lot of our
elder community members used to
pay with checks. They had
required us to pay through a
portal, which is really hard for
many of us, especially our, our
elderly there that were there,
um, and then they got all these
different fees that were added
on, um, which we never had
before. Our utilities were
included in the rent. Now it was
separate, um, so we ended up
paying almost $300 extra on top
of the 1600.
Uh,
Bill, rent bill, so it's really
strange for us to to try to find
a way to get out of out out of
this lease because we couldn't
afford it anymore, um, but it's
really difficult for people who,
who could, who were on fixed
incomes. Um, this current law,
uh,
That really stops us from having
a place, a good place to live,
um, is, is just driving up
homelessness, pushing our people
to live on the streets,
perpetuating poverty, especially
in my home, the International
District, um, New Mexicans need
this ban on rent control
removed, it's time. I like to
thank the sponsors for bringing
this bill up, um, this lot is
outdated. It gives development
corporations and investment
groups, the power.
to ruin and displace families,
leaving us with no choice but to
abandon our communities we love,
causing more harm than good. um
Thank you, thank you. Thank you
very much.
Next is Dei.
Followed by Maria Griego.
ED
Hello. Um, my name is.
Thank you. My name is Danielle
DeAngelis, um, I'm a resident in
San Miguel County, but I'm a
preschool teacher in Santa Fe. I
live 35 miles out of town
because my family cannot afford
to live in town.
And I really just hope to echo
the sentiments of those who have
spoken before me that the
prohibition on rent control is
undemocratic, and the right to
make a decision about rent
control should lie with
communities. Um, thank you for
your time today.
Thank you.
And Maria Griegos of the
committee, my name is Maria
Grego. I'm an attorney with the
New Mexico Center on Law and
Poverty and director of the
center's economic equity team.
Um, right now, nearly half of
all renters in New Mexico are
cost burdened, meaning they
spend more than 30% of their
income on housing, and for many
that number is even higher. It
forces um our low income, uh,
friends and neighbors to choose
between rent, food, health care,
and other necessities.
New Mexico cities and towns face
different housing challenges.
Uh, what works in Albuquerque,
for example, may not work in Las
Cruces or Santa Fe. Yet under
this current law, local decision
makers have their hands tied.
They can't even consider a rent
stabilization policies that
could protect working families,
seniors, and low income renters
from displacement.
Local leaders are closest to
these issues and should have the
power to enact targeted
solutions that fit their
community's needs. Repealing
this ban does not mandate rent
control. It's simply gives
communities the option to act if
needed. For these reasons, the
New Mexico Center on La Poverty
strongly encourages the
committee to pass this important
piece of legislation. Thank you.
Thank you.
And now we'll go to the room for
those in opposition. Can I see a
show of hands?
May you both step forward,
please.
Um, Mr. Chair and senators, my
name is Alan Lesek.
Executive director of the
apartment Association of New
Mexico. We respectfully oppose
this policy. You know, I think
as we keep hearing this
continuing sentiment that this
does not impose rent control.
While that is true, what this
bill does is this bill creates
winners and losers, and it's
evident when we saw it in Saint
Paul, Saint Paul in Minnesota
and Minneapolis, Minneapolis
enacted rent control and lost
80% of their development
overnight. Saint Paul, the next
day was up by 60%. That's
what this bill does. So while we
understand and we do feel the,
you know, the constraints of uh
what's going on in the market.
This bill does not encourage
development. This bill does not
decrease rents. This bill is not
good for New Mexico. Thank you.
Thank you.
Right?
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Brent
Moore. I'm a registered lobbyist
for the Mexico Association of
Realtors and with all due
respect to the sponsors, we
stand in opposition to this
bill. I will say that the
realtors are in favor of more
housing. We're in favor of more
affordable housing. We just
don't believe that this bill
gets us to that point. We
believe the existing law, the
statewide prohibition is good
policy because it allows for uh
folks to chase development and
investment throughout the state.
Uh, when you restrict, uh, when
you enact rent control locally,
you provide a disincentive for
investment, and that is a choice
that is made by developers in
terms of where they want to go
with their investment dollars.
It is highly likely that if a
local entity were to enact rent
control, they would not uh
investment would not follow to
those places of rent control,
repealing the prohibition on
rent control leads to the
potential, it starts you on the
path towards a patch
work of jurisdictions. You will
see investment in places that
don't have rent control and
investment moving away from
places that have rent control.
We don't think that's a good
housing policy. As you've heard
throughout the day.
Housing is an issue in the state
of New Mexico. We don't believe
that restricting the approach to
housing is the appropriate
approach, especially in the
rental market. We believe the
more appropriate approach uh for
more housing is to get
investment, build new housing,
and that is the best approach
towards solving New Mexico's
problems. Thank you very much,
Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
Jason.
Chairman, members of the
committee, Jason Espinoza
speaking on behalf of the
Associated General Contractors
in New Mexico and they up the
commercial real estate
development association as well.
Uh, we fully understand the
need for more housing and the,
and we understand the plight
that many renters are facing. We
just do not believe this is a
good solution. Consistent
statewide housing policies, such
as in statute currently promotes
stability, prevents a patchwork
of regulation and encourages
investment in housing. Uh, New
Mexico is already.
facing a housing shortage if we
want to make housing and rental
units more affordable, we must
build more of, more of it. This
bill creates an unpredictable
environment and a rent control
policies put in place that will
discourage investment in new
housing drive developers away
and reduce the very supply we
need to bring rent down. It's
not enough to just protect
existing renters, we must also
ensure that future, future
renters, young families, and
hardworking New Mexicans have
access to affordable, uh,
Options moving forward instead
of restricting the market, we
should continue with pursuing
policies that encourage housing
development. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you.
And now to those online in
opposition.
Starting with Kent Simpson and
Josh Price on deck.
Can
Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. My
name is Kent Simpson. I'm a New
Mexico realtor living in Las
Cruces.
And I speak against the measure,
uh, allowing rent control in New
Mexico will not solve the
problem of affordability.
Affordability is directly tied
to availability, which is basic
economics 101.
It would behoove this
legislature to focus on building
more units and enhancing rental
assistance programs to solve the
problem, instead of harming
those who invest in providing
housing to others.
Quit chasing uh
The symptoms and invest in the
cure. We need more housing.
Period.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Next, in opposition, Josh Price
with Mark Elleher on deck.
Gosh
Can you hear me, sir? Yes, I can
now. Thank you. All right. Thank
you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen of the
committee, um, as I appreciate
the, the sponsor and the
intention of of this bill and
the idea that we want to make
housing more affordable and more
available for for every member
of our community. Um, I do speak
in opposition of Senate Bill
216. Um, I am a property
manager.
In the city of Albuquerque, my,
the company that I worked for
manages somewhere near 1000
properties, um, of those
properties about 400, uh, uh, I
only manage or I only represent
about 400 to 500 different
investors. Most of the people
that I manage, most of the
properties I manage are only um
um owned by or they only own one
or two properties. So making it
basically mom and pop operation.
And I think most of the, the
rental market in the in the
state of New Mexico is just
exactly that. Um, I am a, a
grandson, a son, a husband, um,
a brother and a father in the
state of New Mexico and my main
job is to um represent all of
those generations and, and, and
protect private property rights
and, and they're um economic
development. It's
been said in my, in my industry
that the best two ways to stop
economic development in the
community is one atomic bomb and
two rank control. Um, red
control worsens New Mexico's
housing shortage. We're already
91,000 units in the state,
short, there's no reason to stop
the idea that we should build
more, that we don't want to
discourage property investment.
We don't want to hurt small and
local landlords. Most rental
properties in New Mexico are
owned.
by individual investors, not
large cor corporations. Josh, I
need you to uh finish up,
please.
Yes, sir. Um, basically, the
idea is that we are in, in, in
support of more housing and the
idea that we need to fix the
housing market for rent control
is, is not the way to do it. I
thank you very much. Please
oppose.
Mark Kelleher, followed by
Alicia Begay.
Hi, my name is Mark Kelleher,
um,
And just to give you an idea of
my background, I have an MBA in
finance from the Wharton School
of the University of Mexico. I
spent about 30 years at the Bank
of New York Mellon, where I
served as the CEO of their
transition management unit where
I advised some of the largest
investors in the world.
Uh, and transaction over $80
billion in securities.
Annually. Uh, most recently, I
served as a trustee for the San
Jose Federated Pension Plan with
over $3 billion in assets. I
live in San Francisco,
California. I've seen firsthand
what rent control does to the
housing stock.
It's a disaster. It does not
help with rents, not really.
It's a very short term solution.
And I also invest in real
estate. I'm invested in several
properties in New Mexico as well
as several development
properties in New Mexico. I was
born in New Mexico. I consider
myself a New Mexican.
And I think that this will harm
the state, it will harm the long
term viability of the state. And
so I would urge you not to vote
to repeal this law that
prohibits rent control.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Alicia Begay, followed by Bill
Fox.
Alyssa.
Hi.
Good afternoon. I wanted to ask,
uh, for opposition of 216
because
Rent control is something that
could worsen the, well, it would
be worsening the housing
shortage, and also could affect
our workforce housing and
economic growth.
A lot of employers who are in
growing industries do rely on a
flexible housing market to
attract talent, employees from
out of state, rent control
actually discourages new
development, making it harder
for businesses to recruit and
retain employees. So I would
urge you to oppose 216. Thank
you for your time.
Thank you, Alyssa. Next is Bill
Fox.
Followed by the final uh Enrique
Nel.
No.
Thank you, Vice Chair. I have
specialized in multi-family in
Albuquerque for over 30 years
with both market rate and light
tech properties.
Uh
Markets that have tried rent
control have seen negative
effects across the board as
mentioned.
It curtails new development,
increasing the already shortage
of housing. Uh,
When Santa Fe City Council
Enacted legislation to that said
that all new developments had to
have 150% affordable. Nothing
was built in the city for almost
17 years because the builders
just wouldn't come to a rent
control type environment.
It, as mentioned, it curtails
new development.
The existing inventory
languishes without the ability
to offset the yearly operational
costs by raising rents.
And the rent structures
currently already make
developing hard to pencil and
developers avoid markets with
rent control altogether.
Regulate regulating rents would
further hamper New Mexico's
ability to attract new
developments and adding needed
housing, keeping rates down due
to decreased demand.
At the National uh National
Multi-housing Council meeting.
Albuquerque was already being
avoided as a market to transact
or develop in because of the
current property tax.
Environment.
So, rent control would just be
another nail in the coffin.
Thank you, and I do certainly
oppose SB 216. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Fox Enrique.
Thank you so much, Mr. Vice
Chair, members of the committee,
Enrique Nel on behalf of the
Greater Albuquerque Chamber of
Commerce, uh, New Mexicans need
and deserve affordable housing.
We certainly understand that.
Um, we do not feel that rent
control is the solution,
however, freezing rents will
stop new development at a time
that we most need it, and that
ripple effect will have the
effect of killing local
construction jobs, and severely
hampering our economic
development efforts. The only
real solution for our current
housing shortage.
is to build more units, build
more places for people to live
in. In other words, we need more
housing, not more regulations.
We need things like streamline
permitting, zoning reform, and
incentives to help lower rents.
Uh, we respectfully ask for you
to oppose Senate Bill 216. Thank
you.
Thank you. Uh, just one last
person, uh, Allison Riley, if
you could keep it very brief,
please.
Yes, thank you chair members of
the committee, Alison Riley with
the New Mexico Chamber of
Commerce. We understand this
bill is only lifting the
prohibition on rent control,
however, the next step would be
rent control, which has
unintended consequences. It
drives up prices for
uncontrolled units, making the
overall market even less
affordable for businesses, this
is an economic development
killer, growing industries need
a flexible housing market to
attract and retain talent. If
you make it hard to build, we
make it harder for businesses to
succeed. The real
is increasing housing supply. We
must build more housing, not
create policies that discourage
investments and for those
reasons, I urge you to vote no.
Thank you.
Thank you. Um, I'm going to draw
the line there, Todd Clark will
note your opposition. Um, and,
um,
With that
Uh, Madam Chair, do you have any
comments that you want to make.
Uh, in terms of those who
supporters oppose.
OK, very good. We will now go to
committee.
Yes.
OK.
And now Senator Sedil Lopez.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you, Mr. President, um.
Senator, is it typical for state
legislatures to take power away
from municipalities or counties,
that a typical thing that you
see legislators do.
What our bill, Mr. Chair
Senator, as we're trying to give
the authority back to local
government.
That's all this bill is doing.
Um, absolutely, and the original
bill took the bill that that is
that we're trying to appeal to
repeal here, took that power
away.
And so municipalities that are
in the best position to know
what kinds of
Regulations, what kind of
incentives, what kinds of of
tools, and this took a tool out
of the toolbox.
Um
I'm gonna tell you what I
believe the incentive that was
created by, by 47-88-1.
It was an incentive to open open
us up to exploitation.
I represented, I've represented
now a couple of clients pro
bono.
Who have been in
Newly acquired.
Apartment complex, because what
does it, does, uh, forbidding uh
uh local.
Municipality from dealing with
this problem do, it attracts.
Speculative investors.
And what they're doing is
they're buying up these
apartment complexes, they're not
putting any kind of resources
into them. They're jacking up
the rents, which makes it.
Um
More valuable because rent is
how the rent rolls is how you
determine the.
The value of the of the complex,
and then they're selling them.
This is such an outrageous,
outrageous exploitation, and
this
47-8.
47-88-1.
Cause that
It caused us to basically say
come and invest here and exploit
us because we can't do anything.
None of the local jurisdictions
can do anything. They can't even
make an inquiry into what these
people are doing when they come
and they buy up these complexes,
strip them, and then flip them.
So I am very, very proud to have
signed this bill, um.
The two situations, the two
cases I've I've dealt with.
Um, I had to deal with counsel
from out of state.
Who weren't licensed to practice
in New Mexico and didn't even
know what the heck.
was going on had no clue about
some of them didn't even know
which unit which uh apartment
complex they were dealing with,
and they were very difficult to
to deal with. We were successful
in both cases because the
Company did not even understand
local law.
did not even understand that you
can't uh provide an apartment
with no carpet to rip out the
carpet to deal with flooding,
and then
And then just leave it there
like that, and they were shocked
that we used the remedy of
reducing the rent.
They didn't even know that that
is a remedy available in New
Mexico.
So I looked into some of this,
some of this, and
This is very unlikely to affect
mom and pop landlords, because
The cities and the
municipalities know that mom and
pop landlords don't do that.
Uh, what they do is they try to
keep rent stable to keep good
tenants.
They don't jack up the rent just
to make their properties
worthwhile. They care about
their properties, they put, they
put money into it.
And they charge reasonable
rents.
Um, what we're seeing is out of
state.
Equity investors who are just
trying to turn a profit.
So I, um, I think that local.
Local municipalities, local
counties should be in the place
to have all of the tools
available, including the
potential of this one, which is
not necessarily rent control.
Um, but it, it, it is an option
for local counties, so I want to
thank the senator for allowing
me to to sign on, um, has a
secondary.
A sponsor of this bill, I, and I
think I was hearing about
Espanola, I was hearing about
these other places. I think this
is a great bill. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Cedilia
Lopez. I
I think I next have Senator
Nava, followed by Senator Scott,
followed by Senator Pinto.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Senator, for bringing the
bill forward.
I have a couple of uh questions
um as someone who grew up in an
apartment homes my entire life.
I know the meaning of rent and
um I found it a little
conflicting that the title of
the bill was rent control and
certain entities and where, so I
think that's very important
matter, um, Mr. President. um,
Mr. Chairman, um, and, uh,
Senator to note because I think
It's been a bit confusing for
folks.
Um, because the title is not
correlating with.
The information given, um,
because it is not rent control,
um,
But
Yeah, it certainly opens up the
ability for a municipalities to
enact rent control. Um, and
coming from the US Department of
Housing. I saw this across the
country. This is not nothing
new, um, and I think it's
important to note, uh, Mr.
Chairman, that this is not.
Actually enacting rank control.
Um, however,
We know that there is a lot of
research out there, um, that
studies and examines the impacts
of rent control, um, which, yes,
the folks have been correct, it
lowers supply of rental
accommodation. It's, uh, it
provides also less new rental
housing construction, um, and
sometimes there is a fall in the
quality of rental housing as
well, um.
So I see the both sides of this
coin, Mr. Chairman and Senator
Lopez, um, and I believe that
serving our communities is
extremely important, I believe
in local autonomy, um.
But I'm concerned about
That autonomy and what that
would mean in terms of
affordability, and then the
housing stock issue that we
have.
Um, so I wanted to ask you,
would you consider this bill a
rents a rent stabilization bill.
Mr. Chair
I think that's a discussion to
be had at the local community.
And I think in working with the
different advocates around the
state for over many years.
Um, it, it's an issue of
talking, you know, to local
leaders.
And
We need a stabilizing.
Factor, and I think this is
something that if we are.
Able to remove the prohibition
for local government to really
sit and have a discussion.
I think it's a start. It's the
beginning.
And if I say I may also say Mr.
Chair, this is not going to be
something that's going to be
enacted overnight.
The other influences that'll
come to the table, but I think
that's also part of what.
Needs to be had.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Senator Lopez. Um,
I also just want to note the
concern of housing stock, um, in
New Mexico specifically, uh,
where prices have been up by 13%
from 2023, um, and supply has
been non-existent, um, and we
have a severe housing shortage,
which I think there's now
overlapping issues that have
come together, um, Mr. Chairman.
And on the other hand, um,
there's plenty of research and
there's a really great article
by uh the Urban Institute, um,
that specifically notes that
renters particularly low income
renters and renters of color are
less likely represented and
engaged, then are their
homeowner counterparts in formal
land use, zoning, and overall
policymaking processes.
That's not, that's also a fact,
Mr. Chairman. Um, and as someone
who comes from a low-income
family who grew up in
apartments, um, I absolutely
understand it and
This, uh, puts some of us, I
believe, in a bind just because
I, I can see both sides of the
coin.
Um, and Mr. Chairman, Senator
Lopez, I am also concerned
about, I know Senator Sidia
Lopez mentioned that the mom, a
typical mom and pop shop,
wouldn't necessarily be
affected, but I would also like
to take into account, Mr.
Chairman, that in New Mexico,
residential property has a 3%
tax increase every year, and I
want to ensure that folks can,
um, meet their needs if they
are, you know, a mom and pop
shop and that they can account
for those expenses, um,
Um, and I wanted to ensure that
we take all of those things into
account as we make a decision
moving forward, um, and Mr.
Chairman, Senator Lopez, uh, I,
I do appreciate the fact that
this bill
Sends essentially uh the um
Sends uh the ability for local
control because I do believe
that our communities are very
different across the entire
state, um, but I also believe
that it is important to
acknowledge the lack of how
affordable housing across the
state, um, and the issues with
housing stock as well as the
lack of workforce to ensure that
we are building what we need to
build, um, again, I just wanna
thank you for bringing the bill
forward, um, and look forward to
the to the.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair, do you know why?
And this is a subject.
I have some experience with.
You know why?
The apartment
Developers.
In Albuquerque.
Do so well.
Um, Mr. Chair, Senator Scott,
what do you mean by so well?
Mr. Chair, Madam Chair.
There is no competition to the
local development community.
In Albuquerque
What that means is.
The folks there that have
That have committed.
To overcoming the red tape.
And the regulatory environment.
To put these projects together.
We're making good but.
reasons why that's the case is
the lack of competition.
Mr. Chair, Madam, Chair.
I think
Senator Nava was right on
target.
Rent control.
Will reduce.
The number of available housing
units, high or low.
They will reduce the supply, and
we just spent the last hour.
Trying to figure out how to
increase the supply.
I'm looking at.
I'm looking at the Federal
Reserve Economic data.
Of the house price index.
In New Mexico.
And it's gone from 300.
This index is going from
300 to 500 and
39 in a period of just a few
years.
So if we're going to say today
that we're going to control.
Rants on these properties.
You won't have anyone coming in
to build them.
Because you've got no way to
recover.
The considerable investment.
It is required.
In both time and treasure.
Mr. Chairman, Madam Chair.
Supply
Supply, supply, supply supply.
Yes
The magic and our.
Public policy.
Inhibits
Economical supply.
I too
And the local control guy.
I believe it
And I am struggling.
Mr. Chair, Madam Chair, with the
way that I'm going to vote on
this.
My fear is.
That unsophisticated.
Municipal authority.
Will engage.
In some of these.
Rent control.
Ordinances
Which will serve to exacerbate.
Whatever problems we
So I'm gonna listen
Mr. Chair, Madam Chair, to the
rest.
Of the conversation as public
policy, this is a terrible idea.
From a local control standpoint,
it's a great.
But we don't want
This
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, Senator Scott. Next
Senator, Senator Pinto.
Thank you Mr. Chair and all my
questions have been answered. I
motion for DuPint.
We have a motion for a due pass
in the 2nd. We also have
Additional discussion and uh
Senator Block.
You are neck.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Madam
Chair, panel.
Um
You might be surprised, but I'm
actually torn on this bill as
well.
Because of local control.
And
I, I think in my political
philosophy I, Mr. Chair, Doctor
Hickey and um Madam Chair.
I have a lot of libertarian in
me of limited government and the
less government the better, in
my opinion.
You know, government, uh imposed
price controls have never
worked.
Um, let me just make sure
everyone understands my
position. I am totally against
rent control, without a doubt.
Without a doubt
You know, one of the senators
talked about local control and
many of the municipalities have
tried local control, but they
got sacked.
By the state.
We had 1/3 of the counties in
New Mexico say we want local
control and go right to work.
They got sacked by the state.
Because
Some up here didn't like any.
County or municipality having a
right to work, so they said,
nope, you can't do that, no
local control, so the state
passed the bill to schwack that.
We also had
The state said, Well, if you're
a local municipality, you can
control your own elections.
While the state just came back
in this session in a bill that
said nope.
You can't control your own
elections. Absolutely not.
You're gonna come under the
Secretary of State, you're gonna
have your elections at this
time, this time, and this time.
And that's it.
I posed
Um, that bill, by the way, and
we had.
Bipartisanship from mayors of
Espinola.
Bernard Leo and Rio Rancho.
Local control.
The Individual
You're shaking your head, yes. I
understand uh where I'm coming
from here.
I believe, Mr. Chair, Madam
Chair, that the individual knows
a hell of a lot better.
Then the government on how to
control his or her life, and I
see you shaking your heads.
Which kind of reminds me of
small business,
small businesses being forced on
family medical uh paid leave.
We're not going to trust them.
To take care of their employees,
we're going to tell them how to
take care of their employees.
I don't think that's right.
I don't think it's right for the
Washington DC or Santa Fe to
tell local municipalities or
school boards.
And how to act.
Local control, the individual.
That's in my DNA.
But rent control.
Something I am absolutely
against. So I wanted to
understand why I'm against it
because I just think it's a
price control, you're against
the Ja because government say
you can only do this.
So I wanted to look at some
conservative.
Um
Studies here or uh examples.
So I went to, Mr. Chair, Madam
Chair.
I looked at Berkeley.
University of California
Berkeley.
Berkeley
First voted in rank controls in
the late 1970s.
Number of University of
California Berkeley students
simply stayed in their
apartments long after graduation
because they had rent control.
Creating a massive shortage.
Of housing for new students.
Who then had to look for housing
in nearby cities like Oakland,
which also has rent control, by
the way.
Studies also showed
Mr. Chair, Madam Chair, panel.
That rent controlled apartments
have tended to fall into the
hands of middle-class
professionals.
Middle class professionals have
benefited not the poor.
Not the low income,
The middle class professionals,
and I grew up
In poverty, like one of the
other centers and a three decker
apartment building in a crappy
neighborhood in Manchester, New
Hampshire.
3rd floor, by the way.
Apartment building owned by my
grandparents, 1994 study.
In the Cambridge, Massachusetts
of housing in Cambridge.
By housing consultant Rolf Rolf
Goetz.
Showed that rent control
apartments in Cambridge were
concentrated among the highly
educated professionals.
While the poor
The elderly and students were
generally excluded.
Now I firmly believe in my heart
of hearts.
Mr. Chair, Madam Chair, that you
are putting this.
Together because you generally
care about people and, and want
to get them in housing where
people are safe, secure, and
they have the opportunity to
Pursue the American dream.
Well, I also want to bring you
to
Michael Saint John
A sociologist at University of
California Berkeley.
He found similar results of what
I just talked about in
Massachusetts in California.
Similar results in California.
He said rent control has
actually accelerated
gentrification in Berkeley.
In Santa Monica.
Poor working class people have
been forced out of their
communities faster than in the
surrounding municipalities that
did not have. And Mr. Chair,
Doc and uh Madam Chair.
The gentleman who spoke from San
Francisco, I thought this was
pretty uh interesting.
Rent control is tied in San
Francisco is benefiting
minorities and lower income
people.
However, the numbers tell a
different story.
In the late 1970s, blacks
comprised about 13% of the
city's population, but after 40
years of rent control,
That number was down to about
6%. I can go on with Brookings,
a left of center think tank
who's against rent control as
well as many studies that show
the downsides of rent control.
I just want everyone to be
understand, Mr. Chair, and
Uh, Madam chair
I'm against rent control.
But I'm not against local
control, and that is exactly
where I'm struggling because
this state, oops, sorry, that
was me.
This state
Has been totally against local
control.
Numerous times when the
Cities like Rio Rancho.
Hobbs
Grants
Who can carry
Clovis
I said, we want to do this.
And the state said no.
No
But this
The states like, let's get the
local, let's give local control
to the municipalities on this.
But let's not give the
individual or the small business
owners, local control on their
own businesses when it comes to
taking care of their employees.
So, I gotta tell you, I really
don't know which way I'm going
to vote on this.
Because in my heart of heart, my
DNA, I think.
Local municipalities.
Know their people.
Much better than Santa Fe.
Knows the people of Rio Ronana
County.
Definitely the tribes in the
pueblos that I represented as a
commission. So,
I guess
Mr. Chair
Madam chair, panel.
Mm
I do have
And that is
Did you do any consultation with
the
Real realtor group or there's an
apartment, uh, lobby here as
well. Did you sit down and talk?
Uh, to them about this bill at
all?
Every time that we have seen a
bill like this proposed, like in
city council in 2022, there is
a, a memorial, a symbolic bill
with no binding, um, law that
just said we should legalize
rent control, uh, landlords came
out in full opposition they
haven't been interested.
Um, and discussing this.
And, and I think it's very clear
from.
They're consistent opposition to
anything even considering uh
giving local communities back.
Sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Senator, I'm not so good with
the formalities.
That's, thank you, Mr. Chairman,
that's OK. I'm, I'm new at this
too.
So
Simple yes or no. Did you
consult with uh the lobbyists
that are representing.
Uh, the realtor organization or
any uh apartment or no? Uh mis
Mr. Chair, Madam Chair, do you,
do you think it might have been
a good idea to kind of maybe
talk to them to.
Understand where they're coming
from, uh, empirical data.
Mr. Chair, I think.
Part of the discussion when we
talk about local.
Government to be able to make
their decision.
If we are able just to.
Allow them to have a
conversation. I think that's
where the real conversation
dialogue.
Agreements, whatever can come
up, will take place. Look at our
local leadership that we have
around the state of New Mexico.
Working with local, um, you
know, businesses, those who are
um in.
You know, owning the different
apartment complexes that that
are around the state.
At the state, you know, we're,
we're proposing this at least to
allow local governments to have
the dialogue. At this point they
can't do it.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Mr. Chair.
You know,
I gotta tell you, I, I hope.
Everyone who's watching and
especially the other senators
now that we got HB 11.
When we're sitting here praising
and pushing local control.
And the uh individual freedom.
I really hope the senators here
remember.
That when it comes to
Some of the regulations and some
of the.
Stuff being pushed down on the
cities and municipalities
because we're being so
hypocritical.
When it comes to this particular
bill.
Compared to other bills where
we've talked about.
Um
Said
Talked about preemption.
You know, a, uh
A great man once
Sent me a quote
Mr. Chair, Madam Chair.
So you cannot legislate the poor
into prosperity by legislation,
and I personally believe, Mr.
Chair, that you cannot.
Legislate freedom.
When you're legislating
Control
at the local.
So, Madam Chair.
I'm actually thinking about
voting for this damn bill.
Because it's local control, and
I hope, Madam Chair and Mr.
Chair.
And all the other senators, I
hope you take that same.
Argument
When it comes to family medical
leave and when it comes to
election.
Election bills of lead in the
municipalities run their own
damn elections.
Instead of having the state come
down and say, no, you're not
doing it, we don't trust you.
Because that's what the state
does with small businesses. We
don't trust you.
I don't trust that you can take
care of.
You really put me, Madam Chair,
in a really tough position.
Politically, well, not
politically.
Yeah, maybe, but who cares about
politics, philosophical. I, I
actually think we're gonna vote
for this bill, you know what's
gonna happen to me, Mr. Chair.
In like 3 years.
Some Republicans got a primary
me and call me a rhino because I
said I support local.
But you can't be
Bullied by your political party,
you have to do what's right in
your heart.
And you have to be consistent,
Mr. Chair and Madam Chair.
In this state is not consistent,
and I hope these senators
And start being consistent when
it comes to
Individual and local control.
So with that, Mr. Chair.
I, I, I yield and I wanna say
thanks for bringing this local
control bill forward that I
absolutely despise, but I feel
in some way I got to support the
damn thing based on my
philosophy.
Well done, madam chair.
Thank you, Senator.
And Gallego.
Miss, Madam Chair, um.
Just gonna give a stable uh due
to time there's a lot of
Issues with this bill, um, Madam
Chair and.
Senator and expert witnesses,
uh, in testimony they're
talking.
About the cost here in
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, those
areas, I would ask your
residents to come to Eunice,
Mexico, where I live.
I've got 2 houses for rent and
and they're very low income, but
it's all due to supply and
demand, um, my colleague brought
that up earlier, uh, the issue
here is what you're willing to
pay to live in Santa Fe.
But I, I also agree I like local
control, you know, school board,
but I don't think that.
This bill does what it's asking
to do. I think there's poison
pill in it. uh, I've worked with
Habitat for Humanity get homes
out the people that are in need,
but also I go back to just
talking about earlier that uh we
need to remember this as other
bills come up we forgot this
dialogue.
Back just an hour ago on Senate
Bill 145 for my colleague said
that we need to make sure that
we uh take out those that are
out of state equity owners,
that's what I try to do, Madam
Chair,
Miss Man chair earlier about
asking how many of those were
out of state.
Uh, vendors
We didn't seem to care. My
colleagues voted for that bill
just a moment ago and thinking
through that, Madam Chair.
Mr. Madam chair, uh, that's one
of the problems I have with your
bill is I think the poison pill
in there is we really don't
compare or care about those that
are investing.
In these areas, uh, the owners
of homeowners of the, the
apartments I've got a mortgage.
Miss Chair, Madam Chair, that I
have to pay for.
And I should not do that at a
discount when I end up having to
owe the bank more than what I
can rent it for.
With that you'll just, madam
chair.
Thank you, Senator. Do we have
any others?
Being
And
pass?
We, we have, we, we already
have, we have a due pass I'll
give you 30 seconds
Senator.
Thank you, thank you, Doctor uh
Senator Hickey.
OK, uh, Madam Chair, um,
The one thing related to local
control is also the freedoms of
the owner.
To run his or her properties as
he. I have a second home I'm
renting.
Some of us here might have
second homes that they're
investing in.
But one of the things that
I have an issue with is the
private property rights of the
individual.
And to me that that takes
precedence.
So I, I hope, I hope, um, that
would.
Uh, be in your calculus. Thank
you, Mr. Chair.
OK, I get.
My time
Uh
Then we'll cover for a close,
uh, this is somewhat of a
I want to think
Senator Nava for your insights
into this. This is really
Art
damned if you do and damned if
you don't.
Uh, the issues about housing
supply that this could inhibit
or certainly true, there's lots
of data to support that.
Yeah, I also look out.
On different streets in
Albuquerque and see the
homeless.
And I know a lot of homeless and
As I know a lot about.
Uh
addiction and so forth, and a
lot of people who are homeless
or basically because they can't
afford it.
Then they are that stress with
drugs and then it gets worse and
Continues to go on, and so,
Um
I
I, I'm, I'm really, I'm, I'm
desperately torn in between the
two because I know the economic.
Right in this, but I also know
you've got a huge problem with
housing crime.
Behavioral health state.
I can't wait for this to get to
judiciary Committee, which is
not a bastion of local control,
as I recall.
Um
They feels preemptive.
Anyway, but, uh, but, you know,
they're also wanting to do
behavioral health and
And uh maybe that's a facet
where this can be.
Further
Deliberated. I, I, I wish it
could go.
Or it could go both ways, and so
with that,
I will close the debate and we
will call the roll. Thank you.
In block
No, to explain my vote.
And our boon
Charlie.
And Gallegos, no, ma'am.
In our nova.
Yes, to explain my vote.
Pinto
Scott
No, also.
And Iserio Lopez, yes.
Hickey
Yes.
Senor Lopez
Yes.
We have a pass.
is the numbers.
6 to 3.
And, and uh we have both
explanations from Senator Block
followed by Senator Charlie,
followed by Senator.
And Senator.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I, I just
want to tell the panel and those
in the committee room and
watching, uh, we have a serious
problem in New Mexico and
something has to be done.
Um, I think the local control is
exactly what we need in this
state, in this country.
But not at the expense, as I
think about it more of
infringing upon the private
property owner's rights since he
or she is the one that took the
risk.
In the investment for this, so.
Um, I'm interested to see how
this, how this works in
judiciary. Thank you.
And Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um, Senator Lopez, thank you for
bringing this bill forward, um.
When all of the opposition is
the system. I know you're doing
something right.
So thank you for thinking about
people protecting people.
Um, thank you, Mr. Hair.
Senator Scott
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Without the system, nobody has a
place to live.
Madam Chair, I came down on the
side of Private property rights.
Which is the ultimate.
Expression
Of local control.
Thank you
Thank you and Senator Nava.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Senator, for bringing the bill
forward, and I was conflicted
because I've seen this happen
across the country, but yeah, I
come from a low income family,
and I know the hardships of our
communities, and I know what it
takes to become a first
generation homeowner and I
believe that the this
conversation, um, would be
extremely fruitful to have uh on
the, on the Senate floor, uh,
Mr. Chairman, and I hope that we
get that opportunity. Thank you
all.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
And now we will move on to
And her her meal.
And family infant, toddler
funding. Thank you, Mr. Chair,
none of us consent for a 30
minute break. Just kidding.
Are you ready, Mr. Chairman?
We are ready, Senator Harramio.
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, this bill is being
brought forward after there was
an issue raised by Los Cumbres.
Which is an organization that
helps developmentally delayed
New Mexicans in Rio Riba and
Santa Fe counties. We then
brought the issue to the interim
committee this interim committee
and came up with the solution.
Now, Senate Bill 198 makes an
appropriation for current FY 25
supplemental.
To reinstate provider rate
increases for the family, infant
and toddler program in the early
childhood education and care
department.
The fit program, as it's known,
operates in accordance with the
requirements of the federal
individuals with disabilities
Education Act.
EC ECD is the lead agency for
the FI program, which is
responsible for identifying and
providing early intervention
services.
To children with disabilities,
delays undeveloped, excuse me,
developmental delays on
disabilities or who are at risk
of developing delays or
disabilities.
Each year, Mr. Chairman, that
provides service to more than
14,000 children, children birth
to age 3 and their families.
Here's where the issue lied.
NFI 25 fit staff executed a rate
increase for providers and
communicated the increase to
provider agencies.
Provider agencies planned on
that increased revenue in their
FY 25 budgets, but used it for
providing wages increases and
other changes to the options.
Due to some miscommunication in
the ECEC EC ECD those rates were
rescinded. The raids were
reimbursable from July 1st
through August 18th.
Now what this bill does is
funding to reinstate those rates
retroactive to January 2025, to
reimburse providers for the 3rd
and 4th quarters of FY 25.
And the amount is calculated at
1.1 million per quarter to fund
the rate increase approximately
70% of the infants and toddlers
in the fit program are Medicaid
eligible, and Mr. Chairman, it's
important to note that this
funding is already built into
House Bill 2.
To my right of Jim Copland, who
will serve as my expert witness
if I should need him when
there's questions. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Senator.
And
Um, may I see show of hands of
those in support.
Uh, are we having people who
supported were waving hot.
So I, I don't see anyone.
Uh
The audience for support, uh,
and online we have Nat Dean for
support, and please go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee, I, my name is
Nadine. I'm a disability
advocate and I'm a person with
multiple disabilities, um, my
concern is that there's a
continuity of following up on
fit program funding being
provided to individuals and the
families. I have been tasked
multiple times in helping
families with what happens when
they have not learned what
resources will come next, be
that be
the age of 3 between 4 and 5,
between 5 and 10, between 11 and
20, between 21 and 30, between
31 and 40. Thank you very much
for considering this when always
examining what comes next. It's
not a chicken or the egg, it's
there is an egg and there is a
chicken, and we all eventually
get there. Thank you very much,
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, and sponsor.
Thank you, Nat. That's the first
egg I've seen in a long time.
Uh, Karen Lucero, uh, who is in
support and you uh
These, uh, go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee. My
name is Karen Lucero. I am the
CEO of a family infantile
program provider agency in
Albuquerque, and I have worked
with the interagency
coordinating committee, uh,
finance committee to look at um
remedying this situation. A lot
of agencies plan their budgets
to uh incorporate the increased
rates.
and found it a great hardship to
continue when these were
rescinded. This uh bill will
allow us to be made whole and be
able and allow us to recruit and
retain much needed professionals
in the service system, including
physical therapists,
occupational therapists, speech
language pathologist,
dieticians, which are all uh in
short supply and we have to be
able to compete with our um
Um, with the marketplace. So
thank you very much for your
support.
Thank you, Karen. Uh, do we have
anyone in opposition?
In the audience or online.
Seeing, hearing none.
Uh, we will go to the
Committee and uh
Senator Pinto, Mr. Chairman, if
you don't mind, Senator Pinto, I
would like to make a one word
amendment to the bill, if that's
OK with you, Madam Chair.
If you look at page 1 line 22,
we did see an error in the bill
that we hadn't caught until
earlier this afternoon that we
would like to change the word
second to the word 3rd.
We would then read from line 21
toddler program provider rate
increases for the strike the
word second on line 22 and
replace it with the word 3
through 4th quarters of fiscal
year 2025.
They, um
Who, who's moving?
Senator Lopez, OK, and second
by.
Senator Pinto
OK, so we are now on the
amendment.
There's no discussion motion to
um adopt the amendment.
Does anyone have any opposition
to the amendment.
Seeing none
Uh, we'll consider it adopted.
And we'll go ahead uh with the
bill, Senator Pino.
sick.
Second,
We have a motion to pass, and
second, do we have any
discussion?
And that we'll go ahead and take
a roll vote, please.
Thank you.
Center Block.
Senator Boon, Senator Charlie,
yes.
And Gallegos.
Senor Nova, yes, Senator Pinto.
Senator Scott and Anerio Lopez,
yes, and Hickey.
Yes. Senator Lopez. Yes.
have a, uh, 9 or 8090.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and Madam
Chair. Have a great evening. See
you tomorrow.
Thank you. Thank you.
And now, uh the
Adam chairs back and I will turn
it back.
Thank you.
Mr. Vice Chair.
A set of Bill 232, Senator
O'Malley.
Go ahead, Senator, please.
Senator, do you have the
microphone on?
You just have to,
yeah, yeah.
So stay with me, uh.
So my co-sponsor Senator Duha
had a family obligation today.
With me though is uh say a few
words and answer any questions
is Joseph Montoya, he's the.
Deputy housing director of
Health Homelessness and
Housing at the city of
Albuquerque.
So, um, just a quick synopsis.
This bill is to provide the
necessary funding for the next 2
years for master planning.
Including developing site plans
for future phases of permanently
affordable housing on
undeveloped.
City loan land in the sawmill
district.
In partnership with the Sawmill
Community Land Trust and not for
profit community housing
developer that was established
in 1998.
The la is partnered with City of
Albuquerque since 2000.
And has developed or partnered
with private developers and
builders to build over 200
units.
Of permanently affordable
housing over the years for sale
and rental, including retail
office space. Additionally, the
land trust is also home.
The Flamenco Institute.
The two parcels that are still
undeveloped are circled on the
handout that I.
Set up send it out.
And, uh, uh,
Through the master planning
process, the hope is to build
the first.
multi-generational, multi-family
housing.
In New Mexico using the
cooperative model.
The fiscal sponsor for this
request is the city of
Albuquerque.
And any appropriation would
follow their procurement
procedures.
As you can imagine, the growing
popularity of the sawmill
district has attracted a lot of
private investment.
the choco Hotel.
Sawmill Market.
Another planned market rate
housing.
As a result, housing in the
surrounding area is no longer
affordable.
A low to moderate income houses
except for the sawmill land
trust.
Which is why it's so important
to build and maintain more
affordable housing stock.
In the area.
And that's a short synopsis of.
This say a few words.
Madam Chair, members of the
Senate, um.
She said it all. So if you have
any questions, I'd be happy to
answer anything you might have.
Thank you.
Um, let's go to the audience. Is
there anyone here in support of
Senate Bill 232.
If you'd like to
Stand over here and
State your name.
Senator, it's nice to see you.
Madam Chair senator, nice to see
you as always and uh this is my
first opportunity to, uh, my
name is Kent Cravens. I am.
The, um, I'm a registered
lobbyist for the New Mexico
Association of Realtors, and
this is my first time to be able
to support one of your bills,
senator, so congratulations on
that.
Um,
no, we are in in full support.
This is actually how you solve,
um,
Supply problems, doing things
like this, so I will, I will say
no more, Madam Chair. Thank you
so much.
Thank you. Anyone else's
support?
Anyone in opposition?
See none are there?
No one on Zoom, all right.
And with that, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Senator Pin Pinto.
Madam Chair,
Senator
On there
Um, using the FIR.
There's something about
permanent.
How, how are you gonna justify
that this is gonna be.
Permanent affordable.
Madam Chair, Senator Pinto.
The way the the land trust
builds houses is.
There is an understanding
between the uh.
Homebuyer this is for for for
sale product.
Uh, that they are um.
They, they know they have a
limited equity share.
So, um, they get what they put
in the house plus the percentage
of the increased uh value.
Which keeps it affordable for
the next buyer, and so any
subsidies.
Any taxpayer subsidies that go
into the house stay in the home.
And that's what keeps it
affordable and I'll use a good
example.
The some of the first housing
was built in 2000.
Um
The average price of a resale
this didn't and and I think I
believe that the housing was on
the market and, and if you're
not familiar with this project,
it's, it's.
Really high quality housing.
Um
I believe the value if it were
on the market would be close to
$400,000 a unit, a house.
And the average sales price is
150,000.
So
It's the purview of the
ownership of the land district.
Or the, these.
District.
Right, so that development
corporation.
Um
Madam Chair, senator, uh, Pinto.
The land trust is acts similar
to.
A um
I guess uh
Probably
A trust of some kind that the
the the land is held in trust by
the community. It's a nonprofit.
corporations. So
The anything that's sold is has
some sort of a lease agreement,
so we separated the land from
the improvements.
So it's what what's sold is the
improvements and then what a
homebuyer gets is a 99 year
renewable lease to the property.
And so that's essentially what
keeps it affordable because just
to put a lien on a house.
You can't put a lien on it for
that long, for one thing.
And um
But that's what keeps it
affordable and and folks
understand when they're buying a
home.
That they're getting that
benefit they get into their
first home.
And um it's been very
successful. We've had folks who.
You know there is some turnover,
I think we have about 4 units
for sale.
Uh, and a lot of it is people
who've gotten in uh with young
families and now they're able to
recoup uh.
Some of the investment they have
to turn around and and.
My house on
So they'll still have the option
to sell home. Oh, absolutely.
So how can you guarantee it's
gonna stay affordable. So we
have a formula.
It's called a resell formula.
And so when someone buys into
the house and sells the leaf and
and signs a lease.
They're able to um recoup what
they uh the down payment. The
house has a a praise value
later.
Yeah, when they want to sell.
Third party appraisal.
And um they uh, so there's a
formula that says you're gonna
get a percentage of the
increased value plus what you
paid into it.
And so that's what keeps it
affordable and sometimes an
additional subsidy is added, but
it stays in the house for for
improvements and things like
that.
So are we still abide by HUUD
guidelines for income.
So most of the housing is for
people at 80% or below.
members of the committees and
presenter.
So is there a timeline on this?
saying that they have to live in
appraisal so they can just go
in, be in there for a year, reap
whatever, get out, and then the
appraisal value will go up.
No, well, the appraisal value
will go up, but in in a year's
time.
You know, they, they still, they
still have to abide by a
formula.
So they're not gonna be able to
take the the 100% of the profit
or increased value with them.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee, will they be part of
an uh HOA.
There is, yes, there is for, it
depends, right, so there's a
portion that is responsible for
maintenance of one of the.
Community parks, that's part
that's an HOA.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. Thank you.
answers.
Thank you.
Thank you. Other question in the
office?
Senator, I just wanted to to say
that this is when I first met
you when you started, this is
what it was decades ago working
on on the sawmill development
and it's so amazing, it's grown.
And how it has brought it it it
it it met its its objectives in
bringing private investment in
and and keeping uh housing.
Affordable and making a
community, so I'm very proud to
uh.
To support this bill.
Um
A little bit of, I'll just, I
don't know if you read the, the
FIR.
But it, but we have this bill
creating the Office of Housing
Planning and production, there's
no, um, we don't know whether
that's gonna pass.
But if it does,
Um, the idea of that was to
centralize these projects, um,
But
I actually did just been reading
a little bit about conflicting
legislation and what I learned
is there's a case saying that if
that uh one of the things that
the compilers are supposed to do
is to put them together and
harmonize them.
And so I think, I mean, I, I
think you should talk to
somebody in legislative council
service about
About this, what if both bills
passed, but I actually think
they can be harmonized, that
office can be created and this
appropriation can be made.
And then in the future, future
appropriations will have to go
to the centralized authority.
But I, um, I'm proud to support
this bill and really proud of
all the work that you've done in
the sawmill area and throughout
all of Albuquerque. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, madam chair, Senator.
Thank you. Other questions?
Senator Scott.
Uh, real quick, Madam Chair,
Senator.
Why is this not a private sector
project.
Between the developer and the
city of Albuquerque.
So, um.
So there's a number of things,
so we have the land that we're
holding in trust as a nonprofit.
That's what keeps it affordable.
If we did not have that, if the
if the community did not control
the land.
Um, we, it's just like with
anything, it would be private
land and we would not be able to
put any kind of regulation on it
to keep it affordable.
Adam chair, Senator, um, the
city of Albuquerque actually
views this as a private public
partnership with the private
entity, the
The nonprofit is a private
entity. We provide in this case,
land, and we do have actual
contractual obligations right
now both using city funds and
federal funds in order to make
sure that the system is
developed, um.
The conversations that happened
um previously with the
Affordable Housing Act, that is
the mechanism by which we use
state funds in order to be able
to legally provide this kind of
funds to affordable housing
developments. So in this case
just just because they're not
profit, we don't treat them any
way than a for-profit
organization in terms of
developing affordable housing.
So what's unique about this
particular uh type of
development though is the land
trusts model. And I'm gonna say
it the laches model used
throughout the nation it's
not unique to New Mexico at all,
so.
Hispanic land grants have been
using them for hundreds of
years, um, Native American
reservations have been used in
pubs for hundreds of years in
terms of the land is held in
trust and in common.
And that's what provides the
legal authority to be able to
kind of monitor the housing
prices, but we view this as a
public private partnership, uh,
in order to develop affordable
housing in a much needed area.
And
Madam Chair, an expert.
The private party is a
nonprofit.
organization.
Adam Chair, Senator, that's
correct.
Thank you. Oh my.
Thank you. Other questions?
I move a Duin. There's a motion
for a do pass from Senator Celia
Lopez with a second from Senator
Hickey, and if you could call
the roll, please.
In her block
and boon, Senator Charlie.
And Gallegos.
And nova.
Senator Pinto
And stop
Yeah.
The city of Lopez, yes.
Hickey. Yes. And our Lopez.
Yes, you have a do pass motion.
With a 7 to 1.
So
Madam Chair and committee
members, thank you all very
much. Thank you.
Next, Senator Sewell's on Senate
Bill 235.
And I believe we have, yeah, is
school math changes.
Because
Senator, please.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um, as
we all know, uh, after the
Martinez Yazi lawsuit. Uh,
there's been a large focus on
reading and instruction in that
area, uh though when Judge
Singleton came down with the
ruling, math was actually a
larger concern, and we've kind
of put off the math side of all
of that as we put in the science
of reading that is starting to
see some fairly significant
results as that's rolling
through the curriculum and it's
now time.
that we start focusing in
education on the changes that we
need in math.
Uh, that's what this bill does
is it sets up that process.
Uh, it, let me see if I can kind
of walk you through kind of
quickly. Actually, before I do
that, let me let the
The deputy,
um, yes, Madam Chair, Amanda
Debelle, deputy secretary at the
New Mexico Department of
Education. Thank you.
So, what this bill does is it
sets up first the framework for
how we're going to go about
doing math in the professional
development of math and the
learning plans at the secondary
level. That will be on the
department to set up and then
professional learning plans will
be developed in cooperation with
teachers and school officials at
least once every 2 years at
each.
School or at each district site.
Uh, the department also will set
up the minimum math required
courses or people that are going
through the licensing program
for kindergarten, 5th grade, 6th
grade, special education, etc.
Uh, also, if there are math
coaches that sets up minimum
requirements for them.
Uh, the public schools then
beginning in 2026, and this was
one of the amendments or the
changes that was made in the
committee's substitute was to
delay a year because the
department currently doesn't
have all the framework, doesn't
have all of the pieces ready and
so it delays a year
for districts to adopt, then
that math framework.
And also having the districts
actually identify students who
have characteristics of math
difficulties. One of the
amendments that was made was it
had this calculia in there, and
that is a formal designation in
the DSM-5 and to put it in here.
would start requiring all sorts
of other mechanisms for
identifying math problems and so
all the references to
dyscalculia were taken out and
just replaced with math
difficulties.
Um, it goes through and talks
about the things that then have
to take place starting in 206.
And then the last portion of it.
He talks about that beginning
this year that the department
will work with early adopters.
To get information about how
it's working, what kinds of
things are they using to
determine when their math
difficulties, uh, the LESC then
is also committed to study this
over the interim. We want to
make sure that we get it right.
And so that's the reason for
the, the year-long delay. Um,
Anything that you'd like to.
Um, I think just in adding to
what Senator Souls has, um,
commented on. We know that um
school leaders need to be
supported and when they are
walking into classrooms and how
they support their teachers. We
also know, um, that many
families, um, feel like they are
left out of the loop when it
comes to two things, really
truly understanding where their
students are when it comes to
math proficiency and how to
support with that.
learning at home.
Um, and, um, next we also know
that we want to make sure that
we have very highly qualified
teachers, creating parity with
our uh traditional teacher
preparation programs and our
alternative programs, so I think
that those would just be a few
things that I would add to what
Senator Souls has shared with
you so far. Thank you.
Thank you. Is that all, Senator?
We'll go to the audience. Is
there anyone here in support of
Senate Bill 235.
If you'd like to come forward,
there's a microphone.
Please state your name and then
um.
Your short statement of support.
Thank you.
I'm Madam Chair and members of
the committee, Jason Espinoza
registered lobbyist with New
Mexico Kids can, an organization
that advocates for community
informed, student centered and
research-backed education
policies that work best for the
children in Mexico, stand in
strong support of this
legislation which will really
make New Mexico a leader in math
instruction. We are particularly
interested in the parent
notification component as a
recent survey of 400 New Mexico
parents show that 80% of parents
believe their child is on grade
level, but we know only 25% of
those students actually.
We support this legislation and
applaud Senator Soles and public
education department for the
work on this critical issue.
Thank you. Good afternoon. Uh,
Madam Chair, uh, members of the
committee, um, I, I do want to
acknowledge, being that you're
an all voluntary legislative
body that you've been sitting
here for a long time today. So I
appreciate you. I see you. Thank
you. Uh, I'm Jacqueline
Costales. I'm the division
director of curriculum
instruction at the Public
Education department.
And I, I would like to urge you
to vote yes on this. We have
come a long way.
Uh, in bringing a statewide
solidified focus on literacy,
this bill does the same for
mathematics. And as you know,
coming out of the pandemic, and
not just in New Mexico, but
across the country, our kids
have fared worse in the area of
mathematics, and we would like
your help and support in
bringing a focus to the uh to
mathematics instruction and
bringing that focus in a
collective way across the state.
Where we can assure that all
teachers have the professional
development and they need that
all parents have the information
they need and that all students
have high quality instruction in
their classroom. So I urge you,
please vote yes and help us, uh,
to bring the academic focus that
is necessary to help every
student in New Mexico be
successful in mathematics.
Thank you. Is there any, oh,
anyone and not anyone in
opposition.
See none. We'll go to Zoom.
Uh, we have those in support of
235.
Angela Alvare.
Hello, can you hear me?
Yes
OK. On behalf of the math and
science advisory council. I
would like to thank you, Madam
Chair, for the opportunity to
provide comment on Senate Bill
235. My name is Angela Alderete,
and I'm a high school algebra 2
educator, as well as the
co-chair of MSAC, the council
advises the math and Science
Bureau and the legislature on
ways to improve STEM education
and student achievement. We
produce an annual report on the
state of STEM in New Mexico and
offer recommendations to
strengthen education and promote
equity in
stem for all New Mexico
students. Um, MSA reviewed the
SB 235 and discussed it at our
last meeting on Friday, February
7th, and we prepared a statement
for the committee with
recommendations supporting the
bill's intent. Um,
First, we'd like to highlight
the importance of the early math
interventions, high quality math
instruction depends on
identifying student
developmental math skills, as
math builds upon prior
knowledge. This bill is crucial
because early interventions can
significantly improve long-term
math skills and confidence, and
MSA would like to emphasize that
math intervention intervention
should occur within core
instruction at grade level
rather than its pull out
programs.
Second highlight is professional
development for math educators
and such strongly supports
funding for professional
development and math
instruction. Our latest annual
report highlights the need for
ongoing job embedded
professional learning and math
content and pedagogy as a
requirement for maintaining
licensure, staying current with
research-based practices allows
educators to better support
students learning interests and
aspirations. This bill would
encourage school leaders to
implement high quality
professional development.
and ensure educators receive
training and best coaching
practices for math instruction.
Um, MSAC also recommends that
all elementary schools have at
least one math specialist. We
have successfully advocated for
the creation of an elementary
math specialist endorsement, and
this bill would further support
and highlight the need for every
elementary school to include an
elementary math specialist on
staff. And finally, as I stated
before, the parental engagement
in this bill is really um
important.
Educational success does not
happen in isolation. Parents
play a critical role. It is
important to help parents
understand math difficulties
identified by screeners are not
diagnostic of a learning
disability, but rather a tool to
support students in their math
education journey, promoting
this understanding can help
reduce stigma and foster a
growth mindset, ultimately
leading to stronger math
literacy among students. The
updates provided to parents on
student progress should not
increase teacher workload and
should coincide with already
established.
Progress reporting. Thank you
for considering our
recommendations and for your
continued support of education
in New Mexico.
Thank you.
Lawrence Scott
And for those who are coming to
speak um on Zoom, if you could
please keep your words down to
no more than 2 minutes. Thank
you.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Lauren Scott and I'm a
TeachPlus policy fellow and a
kindergarten teacher here in
Albuquerque. I support this bill
because we need a statewide plan
to address map performance.
Individual school or district
interventions are not increasing
achievement. SB 235 will help
all students because it
correctly intervenes in the
earliest grades, rather than
waiting until the deficits are
apparent on state testing. Key
to this bill is that all
students will be
screened for math difficulty by
the 2nd grade. This winter, I
assessed all my kindergartners,
using a universal screener for
Number sense from forefront
education, uh, the screener was
easy to use. It took about 3
minutes of one on one time with
each student and gave me
actionable data. Compare this to
the iStation math assessment,
which requires us at least 20
minutes to administer student
access to computers, and then
after I have to dig into each
question on the online platform
to figure out why a student
performed one.
way or the other.
When all the conclusion that I
can usually draw is that the
student had difficulty with the
technology.
Um, this brief and in-person
mass screener immediately gave
me information on how my
students and I and I could help
them. And I could also easily
communicate to parents about
this data, because I really knew
it myself. According to the
research, universal numeracy
screeners can't be used in
isolation. In fact, without the
other components of this bill,
such as math professional
learning plans and
research-based interventions,
universal screeners would not be
as effective at changing
outcomes. I urge you to support
this bill.
In its entirety, so that math
outcomes can change for all
students. Thank you for your
time.
Thank you, Nat Dean.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um, Mr.
Vice Chair and sponsor schools.
My name is Nat Dee and I'm a
disability advocate and a person
with multiple disabilities, I
will not sing Tom Lear for you,
but most of you will know the
song New mouth. Financial
literacy is the byproduct of
math literacy and literacy with
numbers and financials leads to
a trajectory that's improved,
which can create access to
education, access to housing,
us to a supplemental programs
that assist us and build up
someone's life. Thank you very
much. I support.
Thank you.
Jay, are you there?
There we go. I apologize. I had
to get my microphone to work.
Um, good afternoon, Madam Chair
and committee members. My name
is Chee Bushy. I'm an elementary
school principal here in New
Mexico. And I support this bill,
it will support all aspects of
improving mathematics education
for all stakeholders.
School leaders will learn how to
best coach teachers in
delivering high quality math
instruction.
Classroom teachers will benefit
from learning how to develop
individual focused student
improvement plans, which will
ensure students receive targeted
instruction.
Along with school supports, this
bill will provide families with
the support for their children
at home.
But the biggest part of this
bill is the support the teachers
receive. These supports will
help provide the quality
professional development and
insists and assist early grade
level educators to provide
focused math instructions. I had
an opportunity with along with
staff members to attend a
professional development from
the New Mexico Public Education
Department last year. This
program demonstrates why the
skills learned in younger grades
are critical for later students'
success.
We've seen the success in our
school with this math
instruction and the professional
developments, and I ask that you
vote.
Yes, to support this bill, as it
would allow quality professional
development programs for
teachers, administrators, and
families across the state.
And provide those attendees to
be trained to bring in quality
math training back to their
districts and families. Thank
you, Madam Chair and committee.
Thank you, Mandy Torres.
Good afternoon, chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Mandy Torres, Education
reform director for I think New
Mexico and the 2020 New Mexico
Teacher of the Year. We are in
support of SB 235 because nearly
3 out of 4 of our students are
not proficient in math, and we
have done little to remedy this
as a state, including the fact
that the state did not even fund
math and science at the public
education department last fiscal
year, and that is simply not
acceptable. A great piece in
this bill is the required
screener, which we hope will
simply not entail sitting a
student in front
a computer screen, but is an
in-person assessment. Teachers
must understand where there
might be holes in a student's
foundational skills. A second
important piece is ensuring that
families are communicated with
about student progress and that
they are provided with supports
to help at home. As a former
elementary teacher, I can tell
you that the way math is taught
today is not how most of us
learned it in school, even in
3rd and 4th grade math
strategies being taught start to
get much more complicated than
what parents remember. I
remember one parent in
particular who had
text me to say she had never
seen this math before, and could
I please help with the homework.
It's important to support
families through this new math.
As a former teacher, I can also
tell you that even teachers
themselves are not always
completely comfortable with math
content and are often too afraid
to ask for help by ensuring that
our teachers receive quality
training and coaching, and by
ensuring that they fully
understand the standards
themselves, they can focus on
math instruction and turn to
planning for hands-on engaging
experiences that make math fun,
and it is so important that we
show students that math is fun
and relevant to their everyday
lives. We think the sponsor and
the PED for working
on this legislation to raise the
standards for math instruction,
and we urge you to vote yes on
235. Thank you.
Thank you, Lynface, where,
where?
I probably botched your name,
sorry.
But ling faith
That's thank you, um, it's, it's
OK, everybody watches my name.
Um, so, good afternoon, Madam
Chair.
Committee. Thank you to Senator
Souls and the PED Math and
Science Bureau for their hard
work on this legislation. My
name is Lane Faith Hearts. I'm
the executive director for New
Mexico Mesa, which stands for
math, Engineering, Science
Achievement. We are a nonprofit
statewide STEM educational
organization serving 16 middle
schools and high schools across
the state. Our goal is to
provide students with informal
problem-based learning that
will, that they will utilize the
skills learned from
classrooms. Students will not
have success in STEM without a
solid foundation of mathematics.
This bill provides early
identification and support that
includes parent involvement,
provides opportunities for
teachers and professional
development and gives enough
flexibility for district
autonomy.
This is a strong beginning for
us to revise how we support the
language of mathematics in our
culture. Please help support
this bill. I thank you for your
time.
Thank you, Andrea Lopez.
Can you hear me?
Yes, we can.
Um, good afternoon, Madam Chair
and members of the committee. My
name is Andrea Lopez, and I am
the special education director
of Cottonwood Classical
Preparatory School in
Albuquerque, as well as a Teach
Plus fellow, but I'm not talking
to you as a teacher today. I am
talking to you as a person with
a specific learning disability
in math.
I hated math when I was in
school, and I made it all the
way to college without people
realizing that I actually had a
disability.
So the question really was how I
made it through 12 years of
public school without anybody
acknowledging that there was a
problem and graduating high
school without the math skills
to go to college. Nobody ever
identified the fact that I was
dyscalculated.
In 2024, SAT math proficiency
rates for New Mexico in 11th
graders fell to 11%, down from
15% in 2023.
Those, these are 11th grade
statistics. The problem is
systematic and should be
addressed at every level
beginning in kindergarten.
SB 235 would require that we
monitor student math progress
every year in elementary school
by implementing math improvement
plans for students not on grade
level and ensure improvement
collaboration with families.
As a special education director
at the secondary level, I see
firsthand what happens when kids
slip through the cracks. They
lack not only skills, but the
confidence as well in their own
abilities. Though my experience
in school made me what I am
today. I don't think that the
kids this stage should have to
face the struggles that I did if
systems can be put in place to
avoid them. Please don't, yes,
on SB 230. Thank you.
Um, I have been trying to limit
where we have no more than 7
persons, whether it's in person
or online. So for Hope Morales
and Enrique now, your names will
be added to those in support,
um, and I appreciate your
patience, but we're gonna go
forward and continue on with
discussion for the bill. Thank
you.
So with that, um,
Was there anybody in opposition?
No? OK.
Questions or comments from
committee members, Senator
Pinto.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee.
So, with this bill.
The, um
Public education department does
not monitor the implementation
of instructional and
professional development.
Madam Chair, Senator, where are
you looking at on the bill,
please?
On the title.
I'm, I guess I'm Madam Chair,
I'm not sure I understand
I'm, I guess I'm Madam Chair,
I'm not sure I understands is
providing that the mathematics
and science bureau of the public
education department monitor the
implementation of instructional
and professional development
program.
Madam Chair and senator, they do
this, I believe is focused more
specifically on the math
programs that each district is
going to be developing and
turning in that they will be
overseen by the
That part of the public ed
department.
Madam Chair and um sponsors.
Now in details is required
school districts and charter
schools to develop mathematics,
professional learning plans.
So PED or the bureau.
All right. So nobody's
monitoring or having or
assisting the school districts
or charter schools.
To develop mathematics,
professional learning plans,
saying they don't exist.
Adam or Mr. Chair and senator, I
don't think it's that they don't
exist. They may not be in every
school. They are not formalized
like this requires. They're not
as specific as this now will
require them to be.
And Madam chair and or Mr. Chair
and answers.
Also in the title says required
the public education department
to establish a mathematics
instructional leadership
framework.
So there's no framework that
exists.
Mr. Chair and senator.
She like
Sure, um, yes, Mr. Chair and
senator, uh, we will through the
rulemaking process, go back
through, so we currently have
draft versions of the
instructional leadership
framework that would would be
used in this process.
And then, and then we would also
be formalizing, um, our
collection of so that we can
monitor those professional
development plans from school
districts and charters.
So you're saying it exists, but
Can't do it right now.
Well, um, yes, Mr. Chair and
senator, um, we, we did this
pilot, we ran a pilot the year
before last, um, and so we had
several participating schools
and teachers as we began the
development of the leadership
framework and so, um, it is
ready to roll out.
Statewide now.
So Mr. Chan sponsors.
So
To monitor.
And there's no.
Allocations here or anything.
So you have the capacity to
monitor currently.
Mr. Chair and senator, there is
money currently in the budget
and uh budget as we know right
now is very fluid, but there are
several different places where
there is math or where there is
money to begin moving this
forward similar to what we have
been doing with reading
instruction over the last couple
of years.
And Madam Jones sponsors because
there's a line in there that
says on the availability of
funding.
So
We make them do this, there's
money there.
But they exist already, but they
don't do this already, but they
have the framework.
And they're going to monitor.
I, I, I.
I'm having trouble trying to
understand why we have.
Have legislation, I guess,
madam.
Chair and senator, there's a
number of these things that are
not currently in law.
How in that require that there
be out and some of the math and
science bureau was created, you
know, that's already there.
But
Setting up the framework is in
process. It is not done yet. The
districts need that in order to
implement there is money in the
budget, the expectation is there
will continue to be money in the
budget.
But that's why it says
contingent upon funding.
I'm not sure I'm completely
following this Madam Chair,
Senator.
Didn't, Madam Chair and
sponsors.
So we have the PED.
And we're having issues with
their education.
And there's this bureau that was
set up.
That
It's not
It sounds like we haven't been
doing anything.
Um, if we're having to put this
in legislation.
So we're
That's where I'm, what did they
do? What did the bureau do?
If they already had the
framework existing.
And now they're going to
monitor, but if they weren't
monitoring before, and now we
have to put it in statute.
Tell them to monitor.
I and this is about education.
Of one of the two criteria of
reading and math, which are so
crucial.
Um, that's where I'm having the
problem of understanding why we
need legislation.
Understood, and Madam Chair and
senator, so the instructional
framework, um, has been in place
and so this is actually like
upping the ante of that work.
Work that needs to be rolled out
statewide is around the
leadership framework, so
supporting.
Principle, and then as well as
district leadership and and in
addition to that, to be able to
know how to make sure that they
can identify high quality
classroom.
And how when a teacher might
need some support, how to really
lend their expertise to that
area.
Um, and so I think there's one
more component there to your
question as well, madam chair,
um, and that is, um.
That um the math and science
bureau has been working over the
last several years.
In order to support schools and
um districts with the teaching
of mathematics. We feel like
now.
The work needs to be a codified
so that we can ensure that all
districts are working towards
the same level, um.
And then I I would just ask
Senator souls, we do have.
out of cherry members sponsors.
Because I stations.
When was that implemented?
Madam Chair and senator, uh.
I don't know, they've been used
for a while and
I don't where's, I don't
understand where your question
is coming from.
So Ma of chair members of the
committee and sponsors.
So it was mentioned about ice
stations.
And
Actually, the person that
mentioned it was.
teacher
Saying that there's something
else that's out there, but yet,
PED.
Is the supporter of ice
stations.
Finding it.
In the schools, and it sounds
like they never even came
forward.
who are
Teachers
You have something else that is
better as far as screaming
implemented.
Uh, it just sounds like nobody's
so we're, we're in the situation
where we are now because.
But now we got to put it in line
because there's something that's
not being met.
Um
So, uh, what are we gonna do
about ice station?
Take that away or what do you?
To
Sure, madam, madam chair and
senator, so I station um for the
elementary school year, so it
has been around as a formative
assessment for the last couple
of years. The screener, um, we
would work, so the PED we, we
would work um with several
groups, stakeholders, um, around
the state and we would help to
identify options for screeners
mentioned by one of the um
supporters there.
Um,
That could be used as not a
formative assessment, but a
quick numeracy screener, um,
much like our early adopter, we
haven't asked for that to happen
yet, but um we know that there
are several screeners,
especially because nationwide
math has seen sort of decreases
over the last couple of years
and so more math screeners are
coming onto the market, so we
will help identify those.
So Madam Chair, and where will
you get the?
Um, Madam Chair and senator,
the.
There, they're a product that
can be purchased.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
Will this affect our national
board certified teachers.
Madam Chair and Senator, I don't
think this affects the national
board certified teachers in any
way other than in their regular.
Math instruction, most of them
have had high quality uh
professional development in
those areas, you know, have lots
of extent, but this doesn't
really affect them in any direct
way other than as a teacher.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
At some of the schools in my
district.
The
You know there's a teacher
shortage.
And then we're like, oh, we're
gonna create these other, what
did you call it, uh, math
specialist.
You can take my teachers out of
the classroom.
Like doing this and implementing
something which I don't even
have the basic need of meeting
the need of a teacher in my
classrooms.
Um, you create all of this.
And even the uh
You know, that you're saying,
well, they need to have a math
uh even raising the bar.
um some of the classes they have
to have.
And it going into effect.
But I got into teaching.
Thank God I didn't have to do
the the other standards, but it
was common core.
That the uh
Elementary level.
was supposed to have a college
algebra degree.
At least our taking college
algebra.
During that time.
College algebra used to be 11
course for one semester.
And he said, no, not enough
people are passing it.
So they split it.
Became a 2 semester course.
It takes longer to get through.
A lot of my teachers that were
there were grandfathered in.
Um
Didn't have that much of a
strong.
Bass
Teaching math.
But there was no way for them to
get back out of the classroom to
raise that bar to go back to
school. That support was not
there. They just continued.
Or they were teaching.
Is there a plan to address that
in this.
Madam Chair and and senator, I,
I think it's addressed in a
couple of places and you had a
couple of questions embedded in
that, um, on see on page 5 where
it says a public school that has
a math coach shall require the
math coach to hold a math
specialist endorsement. If a
school currently doesn't have a
math coach, that wouldn't fall
under it and those math coaches,
the specialist endorsement is
something that can be done
through professional development
with the department.
And in other mechanisms and so
that really is moving forward,
not going to to take someone out
of the classroom and as this law
is written, it does not require
that every elementary have a
school, have a math specialist.
I think that might be a long
term goal as we move towards
that, but certainly math
teachers.
Our uh difficult ones to find on
a regular basis. Similarly, uh,
right above that on B on page 5.
It talks about the minimum
professional learning courses
required for the licenses that
again would be moving forward
for people that are in our
teacher preparation program. So
this really is focused towards
the teacher preparation
programs, uh, most of the
teacher preparation programs.
I'm very familiar with the one
at New Mexico State University
does not require
college algebra, doesn't even
require intermediate algebra
currently. It requires that you
have two elementary math.
Horses, it used to be called
Math 111 and 112 might still be
there and the methods course.
That's part of the reason that
these pieces are currently in
there is that those have shown
to be insufficient for someone
to be comfortable teaching all
levels of math. And so this list
on page 5 of the math courses
are to up the teacher
preparation programs in math.
It's believed that that's one of
the reasons that we have low
scores is the teachers
themselves are.
not comfortable with the math
content.
I hope that that addressed kind
of what you were asking about
with those questions.
Thank you for your answer, Madam
Chair, members of the committee
there's a section B, the Bureau
shall.
Item 3.
Work with the council to develop
a statewide strategic plan.
Um, in public, in the public
schools coordinate education
activities with other state
agencies, the federal
government. Why the federal
government?
Madam Chair and Senator, which
page are you on, please?
Page 3, OK.
Page 4.
One
Yeah.
Yes, uh, Madam Chair and
senator that is existing
language I'm going to make a big
guess, it's because we get
federal dollars for, for
example, Title One schools or
title. Thank you, Madam Chair,
and uh and and sponsors, so how
will BIE schools be affected.
Madam Chair and senator, they
are not part of the public
education programs within the
state of New Mexico, so I don't
believe that they are affected
directly, they would be treated
similarly to religious or
private schools.
So Madam Cha members of the
committee, as far as I know, the
BIE schools um when they hire
teachers and contracts they
follow part of the um or they
try to follow the.
Um
EED
So, it's interesting, um.
We're just gonna
leave them out even though
they're students of New Mexico.
Even though they go from the
public.
I can for special education.
Um
They'll be left out of the loop.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator.
Any other questions? We have
Senator Cedil Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um, how did the pilot project
go?
Madam Chair, and Senator, are
you talking about the, the last
paragraph.
Well, well, you, uh, what was in
the presentation was that this
was based on a pilot project.
I'd like to know what were the
results of the pilot project?
I'm sorry.
Yes, uh, Madam Chair and
Senator, there were about 400
teachers who participated, um,
in, um, for, um, uh, modules of
professional development, um,
and based on feedback, so we
have anecdotal feedback from
surveys. Teachers noticed that
the work that they were doing
and learning around um the those
modules had an immediate impact
on their classroom instruction,
um, where we have gotten a
little bit stuck is that we
started to do um a data project
with that, and we um due to
funding, um, we had to put a
halt to it, so we are going to
simultaneously.
Um, continue that work of
actually compiling the data,
analyzing the data, working with
our data partner, um, to be able
to have more significance, um,
um, study research and through
the project also, then we will
continue to work with the LESC,
um, as this continues to roll
out.
Madam Chair, so you didn't
measure any.
Performance outcome of the
students affected by the
teachers, is that correct?
Uh, Madam chair and senator, so
this, the teachers were early
elementary and our students
start taking their I'ma
systemsative assessments in 3rd
grade, so we have not yet seen
the results of those, those
exams.
Um
I'm disappointed that this bill
does not disagree disaggregate
data.
Um, about
Performance of the students in
math.
There are lots of material about
English language learners and
special strategies that you have
to use with problem, you know,
with the math problems and
written math problems, and I
don't see anything in here it
was stated, Senator, you stated
at the very beginning that this
was addressing the Yazi Martinez
case, but there is nothing
multicultural. This is there's
nothing English language learner
in this, there is nothing about
analyzing the effective.
ness by disaggregating the data
by race and ethnicity, I find it
extremely disappointing.
Manager.
Madam Chair and senator, the
results of the Martinez Yazi
lawsuit looked at the
differences between
Um
The plaintive groups, you know,
if you will.
And Native American, Mexican,
yes.
And we're looking at the math
difficulties with that, and the
Mhm
And the problems are that
everybody is scoring low.
And we don't know what the
difficulties and the differences
are, there is not strong
research about differences among
groups, uh, most of it is that
they are not getting high
quality instruction as it is
now. And so we don't have the
information or the data I
As I read through the entire set
of research. I didn't see where
there was any specific
information about which areas
different groups were performing
higher performing low in, uh, or
that it was anything related
specifically to cultural types
of difficulties or problems of
that sort. I am not aware
nationally that there is
research effectively looking at
that either, and, you know, I
keep up on lots of those things.
Now, you know, I don't know
whether you have other
information.
But that's part of what we need
to deal with as we start looking
at the math and set up
frameworks for how we're going
to manage and deal with all of
this is what are the measures
that we are going to use to
determine if we are making
progress.
Madam, oh, Mr. Chair, I'm sorry,
Mr. Chair, may I commend the
article supporting English
language learners in the
mathematics classroom in the
United States, and it's
published in the Journal of
Mathematics Education.
May I ask you to start there and
to look at the body. This is,
this is a literature review.
And it's a literary literature
review of a lot of studies. So
I'm really shocked to hear that
you haven't seen any studies
about English language learning
and its impact on math and
strategies that are used. One of
the things that the article
talks about is it talks about
when children, um, are learning
a second language, math is yet
another language, and so they
don't have confidence in in
English in the first place and
then.
To understand story problems and
they give examples of story
problems that don't make sense
to them.
And so to me, the most
disappointing about this thing,
this, this thing is it doesn't
to me this doesn't address.
The Yazi problem. It feels like
we've put money toward the Yazi
problem, but we haven't
developed strategies toward the
Yazi problem. And this
I don't see anything about this.
There's no, in fact, it's really
hard to find New Mexico data
that disaggregates performance
based on whether somebody's in
English language learner whether
somebody comes from a a a.
A different culture.
Um, I, my experience with uh
with different uh educational
styles in Mexico and the United
States was I was in Guanajuato
when my son was.
I believe he's going to 3rd
grade, so he finished 2nd grade,
and my daughter was in
kindergarten.
The Kindergartners
Already knew how to read.
In Mexico because it's such a
phonetic language.
The 3rd graders were already or
the the 2nd going into 3rd
graders, already we're dealing
with multiplications which my
kids had not.
Um, yet you have the same
children coming to this country
and then their performance just
sinks.
And I'd like to, and I believe a
lot of it has to do with, of
course, the, the trauma and the
disruption of of coming here,
but also the the learning
strategies that don't take into
account what they've
experienced.
And
I don't know that I can support
and and then then there's a
screener thing, which is a great
specific non-diagnostic
assessment and what we said is
that that's gonna be purchased.
A lot of these national uh.
Tools, assessment tools, whether
it's a screening tool or whether
it's actually a summative
assessment.
Um, our normed on a Midwestern
population.
And we know that that's been
true for decades and decades.
It's not going to take into
account the whole all of the
issues that were raised in the
Yazi case.
It it just fails in in that
regard.
You don't call for any kind of
analysis based on any kind of
disaggregation of data in this,
and so it, it feels like it's
throwing.
Money
Buying all these screening tools
and throwing
Uh, these professional learning
plans.
Without specifying that they
needed to take into account the
differences among the student
populations. If we don't address
the problems that were
highlighted in the Yazi in the
Yazi case, we're not gonna move
the needle.
And, and that's why I am so
passionate about the Hispanic
Education Act, which didn't go
anywhere. Um, however,
We keep passing these things
that don't take into account.
With the Yazi case screams at
us.
And so I, I don't think I can
support this at this committee.
I don't know where it's gonna go
from here, but I'm extremely
disappointed in it. It fails to
take into account.
So much, so much, and I, I, I
think I, I'm not gonna go
through. I could go through all
of the Yazi failures that we,
where we have done, but money is
not the problem. It's
strategies, and this.
To me, does not address the the
real issue, uh, and I'm very
disappointed that, you know,
you're gonna use a screening
tool that's normed in the
Midwest on our children.
Thank you Madam Chair, and I,
I'm gonna stop there because I'm
getting aggravated.
OK, thank you, Senator. Senator
Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator, I'll vote for your
bill.
If you can articulate for me.
Olds an objectives.
With respect to student
achievement.
A timeline
Madam Chair and senator,
um,
I will do my best. I cannot
promise anything into the
future, as you well know. The
plan is our, our
Math scores are abysmal.
Uh, we have been focused on
reading. We are seeing that turn
by putting in the science of
reading. This essentially is now
highlighting and focusing on
math in a similar way in our
districts.
Everything that we do in
education takes time. I would be
lying to you if I said we're
going to pass this and by August
when kids start school, their
scores are gonna be up because
that would not be true.
But what we need to do is start
turning the ship, if you will,
um, and some of it is a society
problem. I mean, it's regularly
lawyers say they go into law
because they don't like math, or
aren't good at math.
And so this really is trying to
get all of our teachers who
teach math to be better at it,
which means they're going to be
more enthusiastic. Students are
going to learn better and so my
hope, my guess is that once this
is implemented and again, we'll
have some earlier doctors this
first year as the other pieces
are getting worked out on the
framework that we will start
seeing some improvements within
a year or two.
I'm not gonna say we're going to
be in the top of the country
within 5 years, that would be
lying. What I would like to see
is a trend upward as we start
putting more focus and energy
into math and uh within 3 to 4
years, I, my guess is that we
will see 4 to 5% percentage
increases at least, um, and I
think I'm being fairly
pessimistic about what's
possible from what we've seen
from some districts that have
been early adopters of some of
these strategies.
Madam Chair and Senator.
This moves forward.
I would encourage you.
To make some predictions.
We would like to know.
When we're successful in where
we have not been.
And that's one of the issues
with.
With legislation of this kind.
I we don't.
And
Concrete goals and objectives.
You
Try to achieve
With respect to the kids. Thank
you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you. Are there other
questions? Thank you, Madam
Chair. Um.
Thank you, Senator Souls for
being here.
Um, I apologize if a couple of
these questions were asked, uh,
when I stepped out, but just,
uh,
Real quick, uh, do you have the
bill in front of you by chance?
Madam Chair and Senator, I, I
have it on my iPad so I can
scroll up and down.
Perfect. iPad is great for
flying too.
OK, Madam Chair, uh, senator,
um.
OK, um,
In regards to the definitions
and in section 2.
Um, math difficulty.
means a student's inability.
Before my grade level. So when
we mean inability, um,
I heard the word screener used,
but are we, we talking about
testing.
Yeah
Mr. Chair, uh, senator a screen,
you know, some people might
think it's a test, but at the
youngest grades, it might be
more like, please count to, you
know, from 1 to 2, you know, for
a kindergartner, uh, which
number is bigger, uh, what does,
what does it mean to have a
negative number? I mean, there
are a number of kinds of
questions that you can ask as a
screening to find out whether
somebody has appropriate level
of knowledge for that grade
level and so this is not like
everybody sits down and takes
the test.
get standardized and norms and
everything of that sort. It
really is uh probably the
teacher, as was indicated by one
of the, the online people
sitting one on one with the
student and asking him about
numbers and what they know about
numbers and things of that
nature.
Alright, thank you, uh, Mr.
Chair, uh, Senator, so.
I, can I assume that the
screener, the, the assessment,
the testing, the evaluation,
whatever you wanna call it, it's
standardized for those
particular kids in that grade
level or yes.
Mr. Chair and Senator, it could
be standardized, but it could
also be relatively informal,
depending on the abilities of
the teacher and, and what
they're looking for.
So, Mr. Chair, Senator, wouldn't
we want something that's
standardized to get some good
data on the assessments of the
kids.
Yes, uh, Mr. Chair and senator,
what we call it is the work of
the great, so what are the work
of the grade. So what is the
work that that or the standards
because we use um standards at
each grade level. What are the
standards for each grade level
and how is a student performing
relative to that standard and
where is the student in terms of
proficiency toward the standard.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
ma'am. So it's really a, a
standardized.
Requirement or of where they're
at. Is that fair to say, Mr.
Chair and Senator,
Madam Chair and senator, I, I
would caution a little bit
because standardized means in
some of the concerns that uh
Senator Sadia Lopez had about
which population is it normed
on, so a screening really is not
standardized and normed as such,
but is more these are the kinds
of things that a typical 2nd
grader would know how to do.
And so, you know, and that grade
in particular, there is so much
variance among students that
standardized numbers have
Or less effective and and.
You know, useful.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
thank you, ma'am. Thank you,
Madam Chair. So,
But when you take a group of 2nd
graders, um, at.
Lincoln
I don't know. Well,
Real Rancho Elementary School.
Are, are you telling me that?
We're not gonna take.
They're gonna, because, well,
they're all individuals, so
we're gonna test them.
On not on a standardized
screener.
Or evaluate them on standardized
screener, we're gonna, we're
gonna.
Look at them, look at the
different kids and, and, um.
Screen them in different ways.
Madam Chair, and senator, uh,
Some that's still to be
determined. There are a number
of different ways of doing
screening, and I think that's
where the department is going to
come up with the various
mechanisms that could be used
and so it's not a standardized.
Screening mechanism that all
will use, it's much more for the
local teacher to
Know where each student is so
they know where to begin and how
to move forward with that child.
OK, thank you, senator. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Hold, hold
that thought for a minute.
Um
I want to get right back to
that. I just wanna go if you
just answer me very quickly
below here says bureau.
Created the math and science
bureaus created in the
department, um, is that how many
additional bodies are you
looking at to create there? Are
you just kind of, are you good
with what you got?
Um, madam chair, um, and
senator, we, we have the math
and science bureau so uh
currently we have staff to do
that. Yeah, it's existing, yes,
perfect. Thank you. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Um
When you say provide staff uh to
coordinate um for activities on
the council that staff already
there coming out of the bureau.
Can I assume that?
Senator Lopez, Madam Chair, and
Senator, um, two things there,
so yes, we have the staff who
work um with the steering
committee, then we have several
volunteers from across the state
who are math and science experts
who volunteer their time on the
committee. OK, thank you, thank
you, Madam Chair.
Um, page 5 new material, um,
mathematics professional
learning plans, a school
district or charter schools
shall develop and implement an
elementary mathematics
professional learning plan in a
secondary professional learning
plan.
In accordance with the standards
set by the department.
OK, so you're developing this
plan, these standards, and
you're gonna shockgun it out to
all the school districts, and
they have to implement that. Is
that do I understand that
correctly?
Um, Madam Chair and Senator,
standards are already existing
and so what we are doing is we
are helping the districts to
create the professional
development to help their
teachers become better or well
versed or more well versed with
the standards and with the
teaching of mathematics, yes.
OK, thank you, ma'am. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Uh, page 6 real quick, um.
Looks like uh on
Under echo 1 E1, a public school
shall began assessing students'
mathematical performance. She's
in the department approved
early.
Numeracy screener.
Uh, prior to students completion
in 2nd grade, so are you telling
me that they just have to take
the screener before they go on
to 3rd grade and is that, is
that correct?
Madam Chair and Senator, that is
correct. So we have given a
window working with our
partners, so teachers at a
school with that plan, um, they
may determine that they want to
test kids anywhere from
kindergarten until the end of
2nd grade, so that before the
student moves on to 2nd grade if
the student is struggling, that
the family will be notified and
the intervention plan will be
put into place. OK, thank you.
That's exactly where I'm going
in the bill here. Thank you,
Madam Chair. All right, so,
Um
Little Johnny, little Susie, 2nd
grade, they take the screener.
Both of them just.
They, they don't meet the
standards, OK?
So then you talk to the parents,
you have all this planned stuff,
correct? and then it looks like
Uh, you'll do an interim
assessment.
Um
student in the 3rd and 5th
grade.
OK, that's the kindergarten
through 5. OK, so you'll do an
interim assessment, correct?
Is the, so here, here's the
issue that I have with another
bill is, so we're testing.
Testing kids, you know, at.
At this gate, right? So they
don't do well.
OK, fine. So then we kind of
pull them aside and give them
this remedial training,
remedial, um.
Whatever it is to kind of get
him up to speed with their
peers, um, Madam Chair, Senator,
is that, is that kind of uh.
Where you're going with this?
Madam Chair and Senator, yes.
Uh, so once they're identified
as, as needing help and
assistance in the area of math
that they would get specialized
help and training. The parents
would get information on how
they can help their child with
their math. Uh, they may be
getting a differential
instruction during the regular
math, they may be getting pull
out math types of.
Additional help, all of those
kinds of things, uh, and the
parents notified that there's a
concern.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. So.
Are they tested again when
they're when they're set aside.
The remedial training.
They go, they go through all
that training, uh, they tested
again to get back in with their
peers.
Madam Chair and senator, you
know, my guess is that how this
is going to be working is, it's
going to be an almost ongoing
type of things. The teachers,
once the student has been
identified as having needs,
teachers are constantly doing
assessments, giving tests,
checking to see whether the
student is caught up with his
peers doing that on a regular
ongoing basis. There are not
hard discrete times which are
the only times they're given
screening and doing things.
It's.
an ongoing process.
And, and if I may, madam chair
and senator, I think it's a
widely held practice among
teachers, so that we do
something fancy that's called
progress monitoring. So once a
student has been identified as
needing targeted intervention or
personalized learning plan, then
the teacher is doing frequent
check-ins with them, and that
formative assessment is then
used periodically, um, or not.
Maybe the student just needs a
little bit of attention. They
need to understand a concept.
And then they can move right
back in with their peers, um, to
use your words and so it's
frequent check-ins to make sure
that the reason that they needed
the individualized instruction
or support is actually going
back to fill in those gaps and
then they're right alongside of
their peers in getting the the
grade level content.
OK, Madam Chair, Senator, um,
Yeah
If they are getting
Screened, it's a test. I mean,
you can call it what you will,
it's a test.
And if they're failing that
screen of that test, they go
into this group, which by the
way, I, I support you 100% to
get them the individual training
or uh remedial learning that
they need.
I shouldn't there be?
Something that where they test
again after the training and
then they, you boom, you pass,
you tell mom and dad, the kid
goes back into the class,
doesn't get pulled out or
whatever, um, are there
standardized tests, I guess
that's what I'm looking for,
cause I
I can relate to this as a kid
who got pulled out of class in
2nd grade when I was diagnosed
with dyslexia, when you got this
remedial training from.
I don't remember who the hell it
was, it was years ago.
Um, and then I, for a few years,
it took me to catch up to the
reading level where my peers
were, and then, you know, I
asked them, but.
That's, I was constantly tested
to make sure that I was good to
go. It, they constantly tested
on a standard test that every
kid's gonna kinda get the same
test when they fail a a uh a
gate test that they go into this
program. So Adam Sharon Senator,
the answer is yes, um, and the
test was actually specifically
named by Senator Pin Pinto, we
use a test that's called ice
station, um, for our grades 1
through 3 as a formative
assessment, and it's done at the
school site level 3 times per
year.
Thank you Madam Chair. So.
Lastly, um,
You said, did someone say this
is a pilot program?
We have a pilot program on this?
Um, Madam Chair and Senator, the
pilot was complete, um, the year
before last. OK, so Madam Chair
and Senator and ma'am, how
What, what were the results of
that and how long was the pilot
program and what schools did it
use? Was it just one school
district or around the state,
um, a sampling. Yes, um, Madam
chair and senator, um, it was
about 400 teachers who
participated from around the
state, so not one single
district, um, and anecdotally
the teachers were able to take
the professional development, um
that was offered and start
instructional supports directly
into their classroom and um then
we will start to see as.
Those students start to take the
Imaa in 3rd grade, there was
actual results and the residual
effects or impacts that the the
professional development had on
the teachers. OK, so Madam
Sheridan, ma'am, so going back
to what Senator Scott was
saying, have you had enough time
to look at the, the data that I
think uh Senator Suil Lopez was
also discussing.
Um, Madam chair and Senator, um,
at the Department of Education,
we believe, yes, that we have,
um, and, um, to, um, Senator
Scott's point, um, our goal is
to see an increase over the next
3 years of between 3 and 4%
growth in our math performance
scores. Madam Chair, ma'am, real
quick.
Uh, what year did the pilot
program start?
in the 25, 26 school year and
24, 25, 23, 24.
So, Madam Cher was 2 years ago.
Um, and I'm sure, yes. OK, so,
uh, Madam Chair, uh, ma'am.
Um
Let me just ask it this way real
simple, so say, say 100 kids,
um.
Failed to scream.
And what was the percentage?
That we're able to um
get back caught up to to where
they need to be. Madam Chair and
Senator, so that is a different
point. We piloted the
professional development. We
have not yet piloted teachers
using the screener.
I'm sorry if I misunderstood the
question before. Yes, we, we
don't have any data on the kids
yet.
For 2 years. Senator Lopez with
the screener and getting
individualized instruction, the
answer to that is no, we are
modeling this, um, piece of
legislation after the work that
we have done with Cen bill 298
for um uh literacy, so we're
doing something very similar
here. OK, alright, so, uh, Madam
Chair, Senator, I'll, I'll
support the bill.
Um, but I, I got some.
Concerns as well.
And, you know, I, I'd like cause
I, I think you have to have
goals, and you know, I, I don't
know what your goals are, yeah,
I mean, Senator, you said, well,
I hope, you know, and, and I'm
with you. I hope it's 34%, but
it'd be great if we saw like a
You know, we're here, our goal
is here.
And then in 2 years, maybe we're
a little under it, but we have
the data to know why we didn't
quite get there.
Or maybe we exceed that goal and
we're like, holy crap, this is a
great program. We, this is no
longer a pilot program, this is
policy in in across the state,
so, um, I'll, I'll support the
bill. I gotta give you a chance.
It's just that simple. I gotta
give you a chance uh to do this,
so, uh, I'll support it and um.
Appreciate you coming in. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. I just one quick
question, um, is this bill
endorsed by any of our teacher?
Union.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair and Senator, I
believe that the, the unions are
very in support of this. They
recognize the need for now, I
Don't have a letter in front of
me from them, but they certainly
have not stood up in in
opposition in any way and
recognize the need for the
professional development and
wanting to improve the scores of
students. I mean, everyone in
education is not happy with the
scores of our students and want
to make sure that we're making a
difference for them.
OK, thank you.
Are there any other questions,
Senator said the Lopez for a
second time. Yeah, for a 2nd
time was this endorsed by the
Hispanic, the, the commission
that it was created by the
Hispanic Education Act.
Or any or the Indian um.
Education Act and was, were they
consulted?
Madam Chair and senator, I
I don't have a direct
endorsement from any of them.
They did not stand up in the
education committee in
opposition in any way, uh,
certainly I know the department
is regularly working with all of
those stakeholder groups on
improving scores and I think all
of them want to make sure that
we're doing better by all of our
students.
But do you have any
Um,
Madame Chair and Senator, uh, we
ran several, um, uh.
Stakeholder group meetings and
for sure IED was there.
I am not.
Remembering right now with any
of our um Hispanic Advisory
Committee members were in any of
those meetings, but I do
remember because I didn't, I
wasn't in all of them, but I do
remember um our Indian advisory
folks were um on the meeting.
And then I'm sure, none of them
have asked you to disaggregate
the data so that you could see
how the kids are doing, you
know.
To see
I, I just find it astonishing
that Senator would say all of
the kids are doing badly.
Um, so what's the need to
disaggregate? I believe that the
data needs to be disaggregated.
Madam Chair and senator, you
know, and in my office I've got
the LESC book that shows what
the scores for 4th and 8th
graders, and it is disaggregated
there, uh, and the, the various
groups of special education, uh,
low income, all of those score
below the other students, and
so, you know, there is a
concern. Now there's always a
confounding that often it's
confounded by um affluence and
all kinds of other things of
saying specifically it so it's
not puzzle.
But its correlator correlated. I
looked at, I looked at that, and
it is not desegregated by race
or ethnicity, it's not
disaggregated about whether
somebody's an English language
learner. It, it's just, it says,
uh, poverty, and there's
assumption, there's an
assumption in there that that
um.
Or late
With uh race and ethnicity,
which I find offensive.
And, and Madam Chair and
Senator, we can get that data. I
know the LESC has it. We've had
it presented in our committees.
I, I know the public ed
department has it also is, I can
see in my mind the, the, the
spaghetti graph that shows the 4
or 5 different disaggregated
groups out of, of that for both
the reading and the math areas.
on Saturday.
