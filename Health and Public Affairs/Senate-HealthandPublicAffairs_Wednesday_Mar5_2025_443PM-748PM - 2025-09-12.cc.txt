Right?
We have a quorum present.
Um, as you've noticed, committee
members on the agenda, we have a
consent agenda.
And for information is um
The chair had a list of several
bills, um, that
I was thinking could be possibly
on the consent agenda.
I did share the information with
our ranking member.
And I know he discussed and did
what, what they do in their
process also. So from that is
where we have the consent agenda
in front of us this evening.
So, what I will do is I will go.
And mention each bill, the
title.
And uh see if there's any
Opposition
From committee members.
If there is no opposition, um,
Then our committee secretary
will do her magic that she does
on the committee reports.
If there is an objection from
anybody on the committee, then
that will pull the bill off of
the consent agenda.
And they'll go on to the regular
at the bottom of our list for
today.
Which may go on until Friday,
depending.
It's just the way it rolls.

So we did a lot of work tonight.
I really appreciate. Thank you.
Right, and of course, I forgot
to mention, but the, the bills
are in your rings. I apologize,
I didn't mention that, but thank
you to our team for doing that.
So where we left off at our last
meeting.
With Senate Bill 250.
State enforcement of immigration
law.
And we'd already, um, there was
a presentation on the bill.
We already had public input or
we had those in favor and those
who are against, and where we
come to today is an actual
discussion on Senate Bill 250.
Sennava, would you like to join
us up front, please?
Um
I think Senator Maassas will
come also, but
Somebody sent for him or not
yet? He did? OK.
OK.
So for committee members, um,
Let me just make sure I send him
a message also.
Senator Nava, did you want to
give like a short synopsis recap
of the bill itself, and then we
can go into questions.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, and
thank you members for welcoming
us back. Um, Senate Bill 250
will ensure that all local and
state jurisdictions do not use
local resources to aid federal
agencies in the enforcement of
immigration laws. Resources
include but are not limited to
public funds, personnel, time,
and use of property and
equipment. It will also stop
local resources from being used
for the purposes of identifying,
detecting, apprehending,
arresting, detaining, or
prolonging the detention of a
person based on a suspicion.
belief that the person has
entered or is residing in the US
in violation of federal
immigration laws, and it will
ensure that only people with
criminal warrants are being
detained for federal immigration
purposes and local jails. The
bill would require a criminal
warrant or orders from a federal
court for a county to detain a
federal prisoner. This ensures
that jails do not use local
funds to detain a person based
on civil immigration violations,
helping prevent costly lawsuits
when civil rights violations
occur as a.
result of unlawful detentions
and also Madam Chair would like
to note. Thank you.
That the bill will not limit or
prevent law enforcement
officials from arresting a
person who has been charged with
a crime, if an undocumented
person is arrested for a crime,
he or she will be held
accountable by the justice
system, and the bill will not
prevent federal public policy
safety dollars from coming.
In New Mexico, Multiple federal
courts have ruled that federal
government cannot obligate
states or local governments to
use state resources to help
enforce federal immigration
laws, nor can it deny federal
funds on that basis. And with
that, uh, Madam Cha will yield.
OK, thank you, Senator for the
recap.
So now to questions or comments
from committee members.
Senator Gallegos.
And Cha I'll start with this,
uh, Madam Chair and Senator, can
you explain to me how this will
not affected.
Resources.
And child my expert.
Marcello, you can move the
microphone if you need. It
doesn't move, but at least for
the yeah.
Madam Chair, San Gallego's
members of the committee, uh,
It wouldn't affect federal
resources. Our state will
continue just like many of the 2
dozen jurisdictions that have
similar policies on the books at
the city and county levels, uh,
will continue to be able to
receive federal funding
resources just as they have, um,
for the last 10 years,
irrespective of this particular
president, they'd still been
able to receive federal funding
because of various court cases
that have mandated that they
continue to receive federal
funding despite the policies
that they have on the books.
which also are much stronger
than the policy that is being
put forth today.
Madam Sharon senator and.
And a lady can uh
If you looked at NS hours.
Madam Chairman, Senator, we
have.
Uh, can we go to insurance
center.
The, the one that is NMCD it is
lets see register.
Then turned Senator on.
Page 21 of the significant
issues is that we could lose.
National Crime Information
Center Center of what happens, I
understand this is because if we
take away
Uh, participating in the
federal.
Um
immigration.
Would you see that we lose that.
That significant issue.
So Mr. Chairman now.
Cents apologies for being late.
I, I, I believe that was um
I believe that's incorrect. It
was an incorrect analysis from a
previous bill, this.
this bill before you
specifically does not include.
Jails
Me in the center, then I guess
we need to look at all our
analysis if I can get you to
look at the next one.
Department of Public Safety.
insurance centers and senator.
Um
And that one says that the
performance implications.
Within the last year in Mexico
state public.
take place as assisted the
mission and federal authorities
in human trafficking, micro
rescue operations in the Mexico
State Police is dedicated to
combating injury.
Ascial criminal organizations
involved in drug trafficking,
human trafficking, and arms
trafficking.
And turn both senators, do you
look at that as a
Performance implication and or
OK
issue that we might lose.
Working with the feds and terms
center.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator
Gaels not very important, uh,
point, if you'll read further
down from that exact same
paragraph you were reading.
The Department of Public Safety
assures us the passage of this
bill will not inhibit the New
Mexico State Police from
continuing this important work,
working against.
Uh, human trafficking, working
with
populations of criminals or
victims that are, that are in
the migrant community will not
cease as a result of this spill.
Thank for that man turned
senator, and I guess I'm gonna
ask you, did you understand that
we currently don't work with ice
as important public safety are
state police.
Do not work with them currently
looking for criminals in our
state.
In terms
Benham, Senator Gangel, could
you say that again? I didn't
quite get that. Let me back up
the 4th session.
Uh, we had a list of
Immigrants that were actually
Venezuela.
The word
On a list with rimlo.
Elements
The Department of Public Safety
would not.
Help eyes in retrieving
criminals. Just thinking about
Southeast where we're at.
Over 200 individuals.
It did not catch them.
Because when they're going in my
senator.
They're going in looking for
only David Gallegos.
Because I had a rap sheet on it.
Using my
456 10 guys in it.
They took one
By the time they got to the next
facility.
Couldn't find them at our
addresses knew where they're at,
knew who they were.
But the state police would not
participate, so city and
counties.
For transporting not.
Um
Entering their willing to
transport to help out, and we
actually had a facility in Lee
County that was had a pod open I
spoke to the schools and
centers, uh, because at that
age, because they're all minors,
you have to provide them
education.
In Spanish. They didn't speak
English.
He had to have offered them.
Um
A guidance counselor, a
counselor.
In Spanish, so I talked to the
teacher who would have been over
that.
It already does for that.
Facility
And to guidance counselor or
counselor.
be able to give
Um
Assistant or offer assistance.
They don't have to take it.
But Madame Chair and senator,
The state police.
We're told to stand down, not.
To help the criminal.
Elements.
In our area
And, and that's not what it's
saying here.
In, in your proposed meal and
this FIR
is house we're gonna participate
on criminal side.
Can you explain this then turn
center by I don't have to worry
about the can I tell you the
clarity, I think.
Those individuals went to all
the sanctuary cities.
We've had legislators here,
their vehicle broken into.
Could have been there, I don't
know.
But I would bet that they went
to.
Las Cruces, which one's asking
for more money for indigent
care.
He's got more people there that
he
I had not participated or
anticipated.
Uh, I would anticipate they're
going to Albuquerque, which is
already
Crime hub.
The state of Mexico or our
nation.
You know, you listen to.
And or here is Santa Fe.
I'm just trying to understand
when Senator,
if you have any indicators that
are state police.
Will help ice.
If you've actually talked to
him.
Thank
you Madam I think guy goes, let
me get your first question first
and your last question last.
If you look at the bill as to
what's prohibited.
It's, it's merely
It's merely
Interacting with New Mexicans
based on a suspicion or
knowledge that the person has
entered or is residing in the US
in violation of federal
immigration laws. In other
words, where were they born?
Nothing in section one, Nothing
in section one prohibits.
Police or any other state, uh,
Uh
Resources
To deal with, with criminals who
have felony warrants.
Or with persons who were
suspected of criminal activity.
Um, nothing would prohibit in in
that scenario, the state police
working with any other agency,
whether it's DEA, I, FBI,
whomever in apprehending
suspected criminal activity, so
we can be assured that that that
would not, this bill would not
prohibit that with regards to
Your, your last question.
Um
This girl would not prohibit
that from happening. This is
merely prohibiting local
enforcement spending unneeded.
Uh, time and effort to determine
where someone was born.
But dealing with criminal
activity, dealing with criminal
warrants, dealing with persons
in custody and nothing would
prohibit the state from doing
what it, I would hope it's
currently doing now, but it's a
shame that that didn't happen,
but nothing would prohibit that
from happening in the future
based on this bill. Madam Chair
and senators, I would hope that
I can have your
word that the governor would
allow that.
That didn't happen right before
session.
Right the four session.
The asked to stand down.
And not participate, so
municipals which you have in
here, understand the counties
and cities can't look for
someone.
The illegal.
Illegally
They can't look for it.
But if they find him shooting
someone, possibly.
Still, it's something possibly
Senator Scott had 2 vehicle
break-ins here in San.
The steps might personal
opinion.
Sam was fa Py give a shit. I
mean, they don't look for
people.
Because they don't want to get
caught up in.
Are the immigrants or are they
not? Uh, so I don't know that
he'll ever resolve his double
breaking to different places or
times.
Uh, so I guess what I'm asking
Mr. Dan, I'm chairing Senator.
Have you had any discussions
with the government on allowing
Our own state police.
Help with criminals.
Madam Chair, Senator Gregos, I
have no.
Well that
had adjourned sooner than I'll
go on to the next.
Point of contention for me.
Um
It's actually coming off of the
And the Mexico Department of
Justice.
If I
It says, um,
Its section 3 of the bill would
disqualify law enforcement.
From O office of adjusted
programs in the Mexico
Department of Justice could lose
funding.
For certain law enforcement
programs.
Such as ICAC human trafficking.
Caros. That's a 2nd time.
To different FRs have brought
up.
Human trafficking
One of the problems Mr.
Van Man.
Senator's ears.
We continue to have problems
with cartels bringing people in
that are being human trafficked,
and there again, we're talking
about.
Criminals
And in this part, it talks about
Section 3 of the bill.
Would disqualify law
enforcement.
I'd like to understand that.
So.
I'm sorry, sir?
you
Um, which FIR are we referring
to?
On the front page, it says uh
LFC requester and says an agency
named code number 305 Aextro
Department of Justice.
Right side about
1/3 of the way down.
Meta Senator Gallegos, I think
that this particular piece of
the New Mexico Department of
Justice analysis is referring to
uh section 29-1-10.
Uh, and, and it's repeal in
this.
Bill and that law is actually an
obsolete law, and that's why
it's being repealed.
has happened
helping staff try to figure out
where the FIR was. Can you
explain to me that, uh, I am
looking, uh, madam chair,
Senators, I am looking at the
FIR.
It says LFC requestster Scott
Sanchez on the very top.
They prepared 2, 5:25, bill
number SB 250.
Analysis was Van Snow.
This.
Yeah.
OK.
So
Madame Chair, Senator, are you
referring to the FIR that reads
assuming that section 29-1-10
authorizes law enforcement
agency to access federal funding
and training under the OJP.
It is unclear what effect
repealing the statute would
have.
I do not see that in mine. OK.
Uh, section 3 with a bill NMSA
78 1978, section 291, is that
what you're looking?
10, 1966.
Which permits permits all states
and local law enforcement
agents.
agencies to participate in
federal law enforcement
assistance
as 1965,
Madam Chair, Senator, if you
continue down in the middle of
that paragraph.
Uh, the original public law to
which section 29-1-10 refers
public law 197 has been
repealed.
So as Miss Diaz said it, it is
obsolete and that's why.
We are removing it in this bill.
I'm chairing, and I don't know
if we're on the same page, but
then my question is, even if
that's done, how would they
consider this an implication,
says fiscal implication of sin
free of the bill, which we're
talking about.
Disqual law enforcement.
From office of justice programs
in the Mexico Department of
Justice.
Good
Loose funding for certain law
enforcement programs such as the
ICAC and human trafficking task
forces.
Madam Chair, Senator Gallegos,
um, as a senator my previously
mentioned, there's nothing in
this bill that is going to
prevent or stop or halt or
interfere with a criminal
investigation and if um
Federal agents and state a state
law enforcement are undertaking
a criminal investigation,
nothing in this bill will
prevent that from happening.
attorney.
Will you tell me just Department
of Justice.
doesn't understand your bill, is
that what it is?
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Senator Geels.
I'm, I'm reading the DOJ
analysis right now and.
I, I would likely disagree with
the gentleman, what, what
they're saying is that
Removing that statute may
disqualify us from federal
funding.
It simply does not. This was not
part of the original draft. It
was just
As added by the bill drafter,
but it's, it's become obsolete
as a result of changes in other
laws. That's my understanding.
Then I'll go on, let him
chairing senators and
witness in that same FIR.
go to 3.
Which starts up there.
Prince versus US it's got a case
number. I'm not looking at that
one. The paragraph right under
that says section one.
But prohibit the use.
The public resources for
purposes of identifying
individuals who reside in the
United States in violation of
immigration laws.
says this could be.
Conflict could conflict with 8
USC.
1373 under section 1373A state
government cannot prohibit or in
any way restrict any
governmental entity or official.
Consenting to or receiving from
immigration Naturalization
Services.
Information regarding
citizenship or immigration
status lawful or unlawful, or
any individual.
As the 2nd circuit as.
Held that Section 1373 is
factually constitutional under
the 10th Amendment.
And it says it left the door
open for certain as applied
challenges, so it's says see New
York versus US.
It's got the, the
Case number, but I'm wondering
why they would have in there
that this would could.
Conflict with 8 USC.
There again states.
State government cannot prohibit
running away restrict.
centers.
Madam Chair, Senator Gallegos,
that um USC 1373 um has been has
been found to be
unconstitutional by a number of
courts, the 2nd Circuit case
that you mentioned was on its
way up to SCOTUS, uh, in January
of 2021 and um it the, the
hearing was delayed and later um
It was agreed by the change in
the Biden administration to um
let that case dismiss that case
and so SCOTUS never heard the
merits of 1373, but there have
been a number of other circuit
courts other than the 2nd
Circuit that have found that.
1373 violates the 10th
Amendment, anti-commandeering
principle which prevents the
federal government from
compelling states or localities
to enforce federal law, and so,
um, one of the other key
understandings of this bill,
Senator Gallegos is that nothing
in this bill will prevent local
law enforcement from enforcing
local state.
And nothing in this bill will
prevent federal immigration
officials from doing their job
in the state of New Mexico.
Thanks for that. I think I'll
still have a question about it
because
Um, there again,
Hey
I guess what's happening in
other jurisdictions. I don't
know if it qualifies from here
because it's not on the Supreme
Court, but Madam Chair and
Senator, then I, I, I want to go
back to actually the first time,
uh,
The first page of Senate Bill
250.
And I'm trying to find out.
Um, you know, in the discussion
just now, it wouldn't prohibit.
The city municipal or.
Counties to have any kind of
Issue with
detaining.
Criminals
But, um, the way I read this
here.
Uh, immigration starts off
section one.
Non-enforcement of federal
immigration laws.
Doesn't say
of criminals.
And it says except as provided
in section 33.
3-16 MSA 1978, neither state nor
the political subdivision of the
state, including Horo
municipalities.
Which I'm wondering why we're
dealing with those.
Reminder
And or other agencies and
instrumentality shell use or
authorize use of public funds,
personnel.
Property, equipment, and other
resources for the purpose of
identifying detecting
apprehending arresting,
detaining or prolonging
detention persons face.
On suspicion of knowledge a
person that is entered.
reside in the US in violation of
federal immigration.
Knowing that
I'm wondering, my insurance
senators, how would they find
out that they're criminals.
If they do not have contact.
You've taken away all the
possibilities for them to pull
someone over.
Even if they consider, I think
if they have intent.
And try to figure out
Not, not if they're legal.
I guess that's, that's what this
is trying to protect, but how
does law enforcement know
If they're chasing someone or
they're trying to apprehend
something. Someone's running
from a group.
Not in a fight, but someone
leaves the place suddenly.
How are they to use this to be
able to apprehend that person to
find out, question that person
find out?
Are you, are you David Davis?
And where were you at? What were
you doing?
And what's your status? What I
understand from this, there's
questions they can't ask.
I'm wondering how they get to
the point to find out first off
on the criminal.
And where do I live and what do
I do?
Because I think in that
paragraph, it's pretty
restrictive.
On what they can't.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair, Senator Gaos.
Appreciate you reading the the
bill. They do it the same way
they've always done it when
you're running some, it's
irrelevant to the criminal
investigation. If they're
chasing a bank robber, it's
irrelevant where that bank
robber was born.
What's relevant is which
direction he's going, and do you
catch him, you apprehend him,
you book him, you fingerprint
him, you cuff him, stuff them,
you put him in jello. The
immigration status of that
person is irrelevant to the to
all all.
from the criminal's proceeding
from apprehension till final
sentencing, what this bill does
is not take away those scarce
resources from that very basic.
Public safety aspect of, of
policing and prosecuting and
jailing. Well thank you for
that.
Chan senators, uh, I guess that
would be relevant if I were
robbing a bank.
I'm saying I'm fleeing from a
location.
The officer has no clue.
I'm Hispanic
They don't know if I'm here
legally, illegally. I've done
anything.
But how are they gonna apprehend
me and how are they gonna to
question me? How are they gonna
find out?
If I'd done anything.
I, I mean, I could be drunk,
suspicious, I could be doing
anything.
How did they ever stop me.
the fear of this to me.
Enforcement can be afraid that
Now
As a statue as it goes in play,
they're gonna be penalized by
This group of people in this
room.
on what they're going to do
going forward if this bill
passes, how would they know?
If um Hispanic, if um.
Out of country or even a family
friend. If I'm running from a
group of people.
How would they be able to
disseminate.
And I'm a criminal.
Without finding out who I am.
where I'm from.
Madam Chair, Senator Gaels.
I don't
I don't think that would be
relevant to them chasing you.
For example, it's, it's just
good old fashioned policing. You
need a reasonable suspicion to
pull someone over, you need
probable cause to arrest them.
A cop can actually
Stay at your front door and
follow you all day long. That's
not against the constitution.
A police officer can chase you
or jog behind you all day long.
It's not against the
constitution. So good old
fashioned policing would not be
deterred if someone were to be
running away in a suspicious
manner. The now granted there
may be instances where
Or police may be apprehensive to
do this, that or the other for
whatever reason, but that's in
training and in supervision and
in leadership, but not as a
result of this bill. This, this
bill in the four corners of the
bill would not prohibit any
police officer from doing any
constitutional policing by any
means, uh, moving forward.
Thanks for the humanitarian
center, I guess my thing is it
looks to me or feels to me, this
is a reverse discrimination
field.
Uh, in order to protect anyone
that's Hispanic.
So that way we don't qualify as
we are.
Illegal or not, um, they should
be looking at me if I am a
criminal, but I can see that I
would be
Protected now.
I can do anything I want as long
as they don't catch me doing it.
That I would have an out, you
know, I'll go on to know there's
some other questions and turn
center because um now I'm gonna
go to an app um
This is uh this is uh my agency
Bill I analysis it says is from
995 NMC.
Hispanic case Woods.
And what I want in there, Madam
Madam Chair, which analysis?
It is the agency code 995.
And MC
Madam Chair and senators, it's

Corrections.
already found an error in the
bill but or in the.
Analysis
For the folks listening at home,
it's the analysis by New Mexico
County.
Oh
chair and centers on page 2.
It starts out with section 3,
going down the bill summary is
wrong because it's got the
wrong, it says HBO 009.
But the intent of that synopsis
is right.
Um, but Madam chair and Senator,
what I'm trying to get to you on
this, is this your fiscal
implications.
And it talks about Seville
County and what they would lose.
Not participating with the
federal government.
He says, and there again, I
didn't write the summary, uh,
Sabula County would lose.
300 jobs paying 42,000 to
65,000.
A year totaling 10.8 million
annually.
Has under their next is $180,000
tax revenue.
And then

And I understand I'm turning
senators that
Um
Your bill is just looking at
severing the
The police departments.
The ice
Investigation of

not.
In this scenario, we're starting
to lose money in the federal
government.
I'm just trying to get to that
point because Madam Chas and
senators.
I think as you heard even
yesterday and the president's
address.
We're gonna be held accountable
for the pieces that we
participate in or don't
participate in federally. What I
would hate would happen and
chair senators is that we've
already been notified.
If we start doing things that
aren't considered right from the
federal level.
We're gonna start losing money.
And hordes of bleeding stop?
And that bleeding's going to
start right here in this room
right now. I just want to make
sure that we understand that
because I think at some point in
time, people will look back on
this and know that we're
notified.
On the kinds of money we'll
lose.
Federally
That state is a federal monies
unturned centers. I was
wondering if you'd looked at
that.
fiscal implication.
Madam chair and members of the
committee, uh, we have looked at
this and I just want to point
out
Again, that
The analysis by New Mexico
counties is an analysis on a
completely different bill. And
so this bill, Senate Bill 250,
will not impact the contracts
that any of those counties have
with ice. Um, apparently, that
is another bill that they
analyzed and so we're not, I
didn't check today to see if
they corrected their analysis
and actually analyze Seneal 250,
but everything in this analysis
pertains to
A completely different bill then
a bill 250 will not impact those
contracts between those counties
and ICE, and so these fiscal
impacts will not occur as a
result of the passage of Senate
Bill 250.
Unching sinners, I wanna.
page one.
It says bill number.
SB 250. I did lurch to that on
page 2.
Because it does show the
difference in HB 009.
I don't know we've ever had.
3 digit house bill.
After you get to the 100 field.
Uh, but
I'll take your word on it that
you don't see that we're gonna
lose any federal funds, any.
And I want to go to
The separation of, of um
Opportunities with federal.
Uh, so now I'd like to to just
ask you because I've had some
random questions on
Um, as we go through this, Madam
Chair and senators.
Uh, do you see?
Going back to the speech last
night.
As we go forward this and we're
starting to
Weak immigration law.
For the betterment of whoever.
Do you see that we would lose
federal funding and insurance
centers.
Madam,
Madam Cha Senor was absolutely
not.
Aventura, uh, senator, I hope, I
hope you're right.
I want to give you some numbers,
uh, we work currently in the
last administration.
If we'd severed ties with
federal government.
Peak and canyon Caf?
fires
Urban
It was destruction anyway, but
it had been a complete
devastation to this state
because of the dependency we had
on the federal government.
coming in with funding
personnel and assistants.
And you're telling me aboutarian
senator.
In the world
You do not believe this bill
will stop that?
Inur center
Senators, that's correct.
Manar and senator, I hope you're
right. I, I'll, I'll yield.
Um
I have
huge of concerns that
All the departments would be
wrong.
In many centers, you too would
be the only ones, right.
And that this will not affect
us.
Fly to our state, again, I would
hope that we, the people are the
people that hold a scandal.
I think there's a lot of
Unknowns out there
I think this is the first major.
Crop
is getting legs.
In order to protect New Mexico.
Fer.
Assistance to us, so with that
you.
Thank you, Senator.
Any other questions, Senator
Block?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
thank you, senators and panel.
So
Let me just read something just
to give you a little context to
where I'm coming from. You just
bear with me for this.
This is taken from the Secretary
of State's office.
And this is near and dear to my
heart.
It's I, state your name, do
solemnly swear that I'll support
the Constitution of the United
States.
And the Constitutional laws of
the state of New Mexico and that
I will faithfully and
impartially.
Discharge the duties of that
office upon which I'm about to
enter to the best of my ability,
so help me God.
We've all taken that oath, if
you've been elected.
I've also taken a similar oath
as a Air Force officer for
20 plus whatever the hell I
served 2+ years.
So.
We, we know the feds are
watching this.
I think we can all agree with
that.
So Madam Chair and senators, um,
Let's just say this passes.
What will the Justice Department
and ICE do.
If this gets enacted.
Well, New Mexico gets sued?
The sheriffs and police
departments get sued?
Madam Chair, Senor, uh, I don't
believe so. I don't believe so.
to both those questions,
there's, there's no cause of
action.
There's no legal remedy. It's
not against the law for local.
governments to choose not to
participate in in a federal
program.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. So,
You don't think we'll lose any
federal funding. You just think
the feds are gonna say,
All right.
We'll step back and do
absolutely nothing in business
as usual. That's, that's what
you think is gonna happen.
Madam in our block.
They, we've been through this
before, um.
The that was 4 years of uh
similar of the similar
administration and there was no
federal funding that was lost.
OK.
Thank you Madam Chair.
What if there are sheriffs in
different counties that said
similar to what we faced um had
in 2019 with the red flag laws.
We had, I think, 29 out of 33
sheriffs come up here and said,
there's no way we're complying.
With this red flag law because
we just can't.
Uh, there would potentially be
sheriffs who would support
assisting ICE, I think you
would, um, concede that point.
Do you think any of the sheriffs
would sue the state.
If this is enacted.
came out of church center block.
I don't believe so. There's like
I said, there's no cause of
action. There's no nothing on
the books that would give them a
remedy, and frankly, I think uh
Although I can see that there
may be officers who want to
participate with ICE, they're
welcome to join ICE.
But I think a lot of officers
will be relieved because
officers joined the force to
serve the local community and we
have a huge, huge problem with
street crime, and this will free
up every single law enforcement
resource to devote itself to
local law enforcement of street
crime. I think a lot of officers
in this state, sheriffs included
deputies will be relieved if
this becomes law.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. I, I think
the officers want to do their
jobs to get people off the
street, whether they're here
illegally or or not.
Um
I don't think they'd have a
problem complying with this.
But let's just say for instance,
We pass this to Governor signs
it, and all of a sudden,
The Trump administration
Says
We're done.
We're not going to fund you.
We're stopping all funding to
New Mexico.
What do we do then?
How do we make up that? How do
we, how do we uh keep uh
operating and, um,
How do we keep the funding going
to the critical programs that
our people need. How do we do
that when they cut off the
spigot of funding.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senor
Buck. Just this morning, the
Supreme Court denied cert on a
similar case, a lower court
ruling, but
The courts during the 4 years of
the previous Trump
administration in the last two
months of
Have, uh, have denied.
That
have denied that ability of the
federal government just to cut
off the so to speak, it's just,
it's against the law. It's
patently against the law, so.
Uh
If the feds can threaten it.
But then they would be denied
doing it if they were to manage
to do it.
And the courts would have to
undo it.
Let's let the case law is clear.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator Maestas. So let's
just assume though they do it.
And it gets tied up.
In the court system.
And after appeal after appeal
after appeal. It could take some
time to go through the judicial
process.
Um, I, I, in my opinion.
But the other thing that's
interesting, uh, that you said
that I'm not quite, I
understand.
When you're talking about law
enforcement and the sheriffs.
I, I believe law enforcement and
sheriffs, they, they want to
enforce the law.
Um, for, for you to say, hey,
they'd rather go do this,
that's, that's not true. I don't
think police.
And sheriffs are saying,
I'm gonna ignore that law.
Go to enforce this one.
Gonna ignore this.
Go to enforce this. I, I, I have
a hard time, and I wish there
was law enforcement here. I have
a hard time that law enforcement
from the men and women I've been
around, they've never ever told
me.
Hey, we're, we're not going to
enforce certain laws on the
books related to crimes that are
committed that, you know, we
see.
Um
Because it's just, I've never
heard a lot, law enforcement
officer told me that.
Um, are you familiar, Madam
Chair, Senator with the
Department of Justice.
Executive order that came down
on
January 21st from the office of
the Deputy Attorney General.
Chain.
Vaguely
Uh
What?
like, I'm not, I mean, I heard a
snippet about it, um, but yeah,
I couldn't talk, talk about it.
Uh, Madam Chair, I, I can.
Um, submit this to the record.
Uh, for the panel to, to take a
look at, uh, if
If uh anyone wants this letter.
But it talks about
And I'd be more than happy to
share it with you if you want me
to email it to one of you right
now, I can do that.
But it's basically for
The subject is interim policy
changes regarding charging,
sentencing, and immigration
enforcement.
And again, if you want to Google
it, it's
Uh, the letter dated January
21st, 2025. US Department of
Justice Office of the Deputy
Attorney General.
And it has an introduction and
then it's broken on to the core
principal pursuing the most
serious readily provable
offense.
And the second piece is faithful
execution of the immigration
laws.
And then it goes.
And that, that's it, but in the
second part, it's interesting
because
Madam Chair and um Senator it
talks about the supremacy
clause.
Which I know you're uh very
familiar with both of.
Thank
3 of you lawyers there out of 4,
right?
Are you a lawyer too?
No, not you, you're a lawyer,
ma'am? Yeah, OK, so there's 3
lawyers there.
Um, let me just read this
paragraph here from the
Department of Justice, so
everyone can see this.
The Supremacy clause and other
authorities required state and
local actors to comply with the
executive branch's immigration
enforcement initiative.
Federal law prohibits state and
local actors from resisting,
obstructing, and otherwise
failing to comply with lawful
immigration-related commands and
requests pursuant to, for
example, the president's
extensive Article 2 authority.
With respect to foreign affairs
and national security.
Immigration and nationally.
Act, that's, I'm sorry, the
immigration and Nationality Act.
In the alien Enemies Act.
The US attorney's offices and
litigating components of the
Department of Justice shall
investigate incidents involving
Any such misconduct for
potential prosecution.
Including
Or official.
obstructing federal functions
and violations of 18 US codes.
Section 371.
And violations of other statutes
such as 8 US Code sections.
1324 and 1373.
And there's another interesting
piece on 1373.
Declination describes with
respect to resistance,
obstruction, and other
non-compliance with lawful
immigration-related commands and
requests from federal
authorities.
shall disclose as urgent reports
pursuant to Justice manual
Section 1-13.130.
How, how does the supremacy
clause, uh, Madam Chair and
panel.
Um, relate to this particular
bill.
Madam Ch Center block, it does
not.
So when Madam Chair 1373 was
mentioned.
With 8, in the 8th US code.
But I just did a couple.
Couple little Google things
there and actually that wasn't
found unconstitutional.
For instance, in the 3rd Circuit
case, which is called Ocean City
versus Attorney General of New
Jersey decided in August of
2021.
The footnote
Uh, number 4 of the opinion
says, well, we do not opine.
On the Attorney General's
argument that sections 1373 and
1644 violate the
anti-commandeering doctrine.
We nevertheless acknowledge, uh,
OK. So, they don't find it
unconstitutional, so the third
court did not say the law is
unconstitutional.
So there's that. So then we go
back to
Section 1373.
Madam Chair, Senator enacted as
section 6642.
Of the illegal immigration
reform and immigrant
responsibility Act of 1996.
Which has
Not been found.
Um, or I guess you could not do
the double negative, which has
been found to be constitutional.
Um
Section A, in general.
An interesting part here is a
federal, state, or local
government entity or official
may not prohibit.
Or in any way restrict.
Any government entity or
official from sending to or
receiving from the immigration
and Naturalization Service
Information.
Regarding the citizenship of
immigration status, lawful or
unlawful or any individual. Uh,
Madam Chair, uh, panel, is, is
that
Uh, did I, did, did I read that
accurately? Is that how you know
the law to read?
Do, do you, do you dispute
that's not correct how the law
is written there? Um, Madam
Chair, Senator, um,
One of the key cases regarding
um.
Anti-commandeering came down in
2018, Murphy B NCAA that was
regarding the professional
amateur sports Protection Act,
which prohibited states from
engaging in sports betting.
And uh since that case was
decided by SCOTUS in 2018.
You have, um, Philadelphia v.
Sessions coming down also in
2018, post Murphy saying the
court found that 1373 violated
the anti-commandeering doctrine,
the 10th Amendment.
Um, ruling that it was
unconstitutional.
You have the state of New York.
Versus DOJ Southern District of
New York.
Ruling that 1373 was
unconstitutional, citing to
Murphy.
As president
And then in 2019,
You have the city of Chicago
versus Sessions, um, the court
was addressing.
France coming from DOJ that was
trying to tie additional um
requirements.
To those of federal grants and
said that 1373 was
unconstitutional again under.
Murphy.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair. So
again, the question was,
Did I read that law correctly?
Did I read this section
accurately.
Madam Chair
Senator, uh, I believe you read
that, uh, correctly, but um it
has been found by federal courts
to be unconstitutional. Well,
Madam Chair, panel in New York
versus US Department of Justice.
The 2nd circuit court ruling in
2020, the appeals court found
that 1,373 did not violate the
10th Amendment in regard to
federal grants. In fact, it said
we conclude that notion 1373
does not violate the 10th
Amendment, has applied here to
federal funding requirements.
I would also argue that the US
Supreme Court, when it refuses
to hear a case.
Provides no precedent.
It's not an endorsement or a
rejection of the lower court
decision, I think you would
agree with that.
In addition to going back to
1373.
The Additional authority of
government entities.
Uh, Madam Chair and panel.
It says here no person or agency
may prohibit in any way restrict
a federal, state, or local
government entity from doing any
of the following with respect to
information regarding
immigration status.
So when I read, I read that.
And then I go to the uh
analysis.
That
Senator Gallegos brought up in
regards to
I believe it was.
The corrections department.
It's it's interesting, Madam
Chair, in, in panel because if
If the police pull somebody
over.
Has all the time.
And I've seen this sitting in
the dispatch center actually
looking at the National Crime
Information Center. Obviously, I
had to sign an NDA.
On the information I saw there,
but anytime
An officer pulls somebody over.
And that officer
Calls into the dispatch center.
The license plate number and the
name.
Uh, Madam chair center, what is
that, what is that, that
dispatcher do?
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair Block. It's not the
dispatcher, but it's the um
necessarily, but he's trying to
obtain information on the
vehicles, see if the vehicle is
stolen, get information on the
drivers, see if the driver has a
warrant, but more importantly,
to identify the driver, uh, to
communicate with that driver,
whether whether it would be a
trip traffic ticket or criminal
summons or things of that
nature.
But, OK, Madam Chair, Senator,
but the police officer has to
Ask the dispatcher for that
information, and the dispatcher
plugs that into the NCI II uh
NCI NCIC, correct?
Correct. OK. So, Madam Chair and
senator,
When that happens,
And let me just read the uh
analysis here. So we're all on
the same sheet.
Um, on the second paragraph of
the significant issues of the uh
corrections department analysis.
The corrections department uses
the NCIC system during the
intake process.
Whether for individuals entering
a prison facility or for
community supervision.
However, the corrections
department only becomes involved
in immigration-related matters
when a warrant is entered into
the NCIC system.
The department does not actively
search for individuals based on
immigration status and instead
it responds only when alerted by
the presence of a federal
immigration warrant.
When flagged, the corrections
department may coordinate with
federal immigration authorities,
which could include actions.
Transferring individuals for
deportation.
Corrections department
involvement is limited but only
happens in response to an
established legal, legal, legal
warrant. So in, in that case,
Madam Chair and senator,
Now the dispatcher.
Relays the information back.
For the individual, whoever it
is.
Go bag of donuts. I don't really
care what the name is.
Uh, that person then the
dispatcher tells the officer,
hey,
This guy is wanted by the feds.
For an immigration
Uh
Violation, whatever it is.
Are are you telling me that you
would
And we're gonna bring him in.
He's getting arrested for
something, DUI, let's just say
it's a DUI.
So he comes in, or she, they get
intake into the Sandoval County.
Detention center
We know there's a
Immigration warrant from the
feds.
Are you telling me with this
bill, Madam Chair and panel, we
do not notify.
The feds that we have somebody
who is
Wanted by the feds for an
immigration violation.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator
Block. That, that person,
assuming they get a
Arrested on the DWI, they would
be booked in on the DWI and on
the felony warrant. I'd imagine
the felony warrant has a hold in
the federal, federal authorities
will be notified at that time.
But if that person was not
arrested on Dita Bay, they still
would be arrested on a felony
warrant, uh, once that officer
is notified of that, of that uh
warrant.
So, Madam chair, Senator,
Federal warrant on the federal
warrant.
Uh, well, which is would be
because of an immigration
violation, correct?
So put it this way, let me ask
it this way then. So, Madam
Chair, Senator, we, we have
somebody who crosses the border
illegally.
Right?
They end up getting they they
want to apply for.
Asylum or or something, they
don't go to their asylum
hearing, which is what we saw
about 90% of the people did not
go. So now they violated that.
So now we're looking for them,
right?
So
Now there's a warrant because
they didn't show up as they're
supposed to.
So this guy or woman.
Has to get pulled over for DWI
or DUI, whatever you want to
call it.
We know in the database that
he's wanted by the feds for
illegal immigrant violation.
Your bill here though would,
would not notify the feds, is
that correct? Because it says
here.
In section one,
Section one,
That
You're not allowed to, you don't
have the authorization to use
public funds, personnel,
property, equipment, or other
reasons for the purpose of
identifying.
Detecting, apprehending,
arresting, detaining, or
prolonging the detention of a
person based on suspicion or
knowledge. Now we know.
That the person has entered or
is residing in the United States
in violation of federal
immigration laws.
So, you, you guys would not say
anything, then to the feds,
because we, you have knowledge
according to section one.
But now you're saying
Thank you, Madam Chair Charlan.
It depends on the, on the
warrant.
It's a criminal warrant by all
means, yes, yes, if it's a civil
warrant, once again, this, this
bill is geared towards public
safety.
Public safety and it's a civil
warrant.
Uh, then that person would not
be treated differently if they
were a witness to a crime. They
were a 911 caller. They were.
Victim of a car accident or if
they were pulled over.
For
For speeding.
OK. So, Madam chair, Senator.
Like, so
We know, we have knowledge
though that this person
I wanted, and you're saying that
We would notify the feds.
Because this person's in the
NCIC.
And we would notify the feds
that we got him.
For whatever reason, we got
them, we're holding him, we're
detaining him.
You're OK with that, to notify
the feds and turn them over.
But um, Madam chair center
block, absolutely, if they're an
NCIC, absolutely they the feds
will be notified.
Guaranteed because the NCIC is a
criminal database. The person
you described that that's
violating civil immigration laws
would not, that would not be in
an NCIC.
OK, so Madam Chair and Senator,
OK, so if he violated civil
immigration laws.
Is that what you said?
Can you tell me what that is?
Madam Chair, Senator Block,
members of the committee, um.
Civil immigration law or civil
immigration violation could be
overstaying a visa, failure to
maintain legal status or being
unlawfully present in the
country. It's not a criminal.
Violation, um, a criminal
violation could be a
misdemeanor, but a local law
enforcement would not.
So entering into the country
without inspection is a
misdemeanor, but a local law
enforcement official doesn't.
Have the authority to arrest a
person for a misdemeanor if it's
not committed in his or her
presence. So those are the two
things that this bill would
cover.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, ma'am. So basically,
we are going to ignore all
violations of civil law. If
someone is here illegally.
We're gonna ignore those.
We're not going to pursue those.
Thank you, Madam Chair, as we do
all other civil laws.
If someone has a carport that's
3 ft longer than the civil code.
cop that pulls you over doesn't
really spend much time on that.
With regards to whether that
person is
is in the country.
Uh, without papers.
That would be determined as a
result of
Of an interrogation. We don't
want that interrogation to
happen. There's no way that
officer would even know.
And so, uh, there's no database,
uh, that, that an officer can
enter into to disseminate that
information. We don't want
officers spending.
Important scarce resource time
delving into where a person was
born, as opposed to
investigating what's in front of
them, whether it be a DWI, uh,
domestic violence or something
like that we want officers to
focus on public safety, public
safety only, and let the feds do
what the feds do.
And let local law enforcement do
what they do best and that's
protect our communities and, and
fight criminals.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. Well, I, I would
argue
Um, you know, a carport being 3
ft longer than uh someone who's
violated immigration laws.
The the pri the priorities are
totally different.
Way different, um, I, I, I just
can't buy that. I can't buy that
argument. Well, it's the same
thing as having your carport 2
ft longer than the zoning or
whatever. That, that, that one
doesn't, doesn't fly, just my
opinion.
So
I guess, Madam Chair, uh,
Senator.
What, what other laws
Or what other, yeah, I guess
laws, are we not cooperating
with the feds on? Is it just
these or are there other laws
that we, you, that we don't
coordinate with the feds on.
What I'm saying is
Madam chair, senator is
You said civil law, we're not
gonna, we're not gonna do
anything. We're going to ignore
that if they break civil law, we
don't really care. We're gonna
ignore it because no one really
cares anyway, is your argument,
which I have a hard time with.
But what other, what other laws
do we not
Coordinate with the feds on.
Or is it just this? Is it only
civil laws?
Senator Lopez.
Uh, the alcohol, tobacco, and
firearms, explosives.
Agency, federal agency, they
can't come in and tell the state
police how they're going to
regulate.
And, and to go pick up firearms.
You know, it just can't. That's
the whole heart of the Prince
case is you can't commandeer a
state.
Agency to enforce a federal
regulatory program.
And I think you would be very
unhappy if for some reason we
had an alcohol.
Tobacco, firearms, explosives.
Organization that came around
and started poking into people's
lives and trying to take their
federal firearms and asking the
state to help with that.
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. Uh, I, as an
American citizen who's bound by
my oath.
I'd be upset if we're not
following any law. We're just
ignoring certain laws.
That's, that's the rub.
This is not about anything
political. The rub for me is
Why ignore one set of laws but
not but not another.
Because the argument is,
And it just doesn't make sense
to me is
Well
We're not going to really
enforce those.
But we're going to force these.
We're gonna look the other way
for this.
Not for this.
And that doesn't make sense in
my mind as, as a guy who's taken
numerous oaths either as a
military officer or as an
elected official, 34 times.
So I, I think we're in
Um
A lot of, a lot of danger, madam
Chair, and, and I, I don't think
this is really like
Prince
Um, I
Remember correctly, that case.
sheriffs they had to do
background checks for the Brady
law.
Uh, let me just double check
that to make sure that's
correct.
Uh, you know, this is the state
telling local governments they
cannot cooperate with the
federal government.
That, that right there is an
issue and um
And Madam Chair, I'm gonna yield
that I, I, I can't support this
bill.
At all, because we're setting in
my mind a bad precedent of
And we've done it so many times
up here in Santa Fe, this
session of treating everybody
differently.
It drives me through the roof.
And law enforcement's there.
To keep us safe, no matter what.
We've had.
Millions and millions of people
come to this country unvetted.
All the gotaways
We don't know.
Any backgrounds on them at all.
Now listen,
This is a sensitive sensitive
issue, and I get that. My wife
is an immigrant, Madam Chair.
He's from China.
him here legally.
And she did it the right way.
And I understand things are
different with certain people,
but my wife wanted to do it the
right way.
It took her years to do it.
So, I can't.
Report something where
Based on my oath that we're
going to look the other way on
certain laws.
But otherwise, we're going to
enforce them. Thank you, Madam
Chair, I yield for now.
Thank you add something.
Thank you, Senator.
Um, Senator Scott.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Let me
start by saying.
I hate questioning.
OK.
I'm on your bill, section one.
July 19.
Except as provided in section
33-3-16.
NMSA 1978.
That someone read me the first
paragraph.
Of 33-3-16, please, Madam Chair.
Senate.
me. Thank you, Madam Senator. I
can read you, um,
It is, it is a difficult read.
It is a difficult read because
it was written in um
1865.
So in crafting this bill,
instead of amending the
1365
Statute, what we did, uh, Madam
Chair on page 2.
is on line 7, we repealed the
existing 33316.
And we rewrote it in 2025.
Language, so on page 2 lines 10
to 25.
That is the new.
the new wording of of that and
the proposed wording rather of
of a 33-3-16.
So we're um
So essentially,
The bill, the law would read
except as provided by section 2.
Section one applies, but section
2 is dealing with jails.
We do, and, and so section 2.
The sheriff, the jailer, the
jail administrator, an
independent contractor of a
jail, uh, shall honor um the
warrants and orders of a federal
judge.
are dealing with a criminal.
was.
Senator Scott.
but it is a difficult way to
read that 1865 statue.
What happened in front of me if
you need it.
OK, so
Madam Chair, Senator.
Section 1 is the existing
33-3-16 repealed.
section 2.
No, sir. Thank you, Madam Chair,
Senator, uh.
Senator Scott, section one is
new language.
Section one is new material.
Section 2.
The wording is also new
material.
But the law doesn't necessarily
change.
We
The bill drafter suggested that
we put it in modern readable
language.
So even though section 2, which
is the 33316 that you referenced
is new language. It's
It's, it's, it's the law that's
currently on the books dealing
with federal inmates and, and
local jails.
OK, that's
The chair and
Senator, that's at least.
Confusing that the Madam Chair,
Senator Scott the, the, the 1865
statute is even more confusing.
That's why we changed it to
modern language.
OK.
Um
Madam Chair.
I believe
Under
The new 33-3-16.
That a sheriff, jail, or jail
administrator, independent
contractor.
And
Oh someone merely for being.
Mm
In the country illegally.
Is that accurate?
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, that
is correct. OK.
something to refer you to.
Some information that we have
here, Madam Chair.
About a 3 facilities in the
state, one of which
is owned by Otero County.
Which is now
I believe
The Otero County.
The tension
Uh, uh, excuse me, Otero County
Processing Center.
County facility
will not be allowed.
To house
Undocumented
Is that
Uh, is that accurate?
me, I was reading Madam Cha and
Scott, your end of your
question, but I believe
You asked it. I believe the way
you asked it is accurate because
Any
Any
Federal inmate
That gets
Sent to those detention centers
in Cebula County or the one down
in Otero will remain there under
this.
statute and that receives
custody of a person through a
warrant by a federal judge may
keep that person in custody
until that person is released
under the laws of the United
States.
But
Madam Chair and senator, these
They spoke this is a facility.
Designed and built to process.
Undocumented people.
And it, in the, in the county of
Otero is a political subdivision
of the state.
And I believe.
This now prohibits.
A political subdivision of the
state.
From housing
Undocumented.
People
Are we on the same page?
exact question, Senator.
Yeah, a county facility.
Owned by
a political subdivision of the
state designed.
To house.
Undocumented people.
We'll have to close as a
consequence of this.
Legislation
That's a question.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair, Senator Scott. I believe
this would do that, but that's
certainly not the purpose of
this bill.
Uh, the folks can be assured
that
that contracts cannot be usurped
by any bill that we do.
But we will make sure that that
language, uh,
It's correct. That's not the
intent of this bill at all. I
don't believe this language
would would prohibit that, but
we'll make sure, uh, we'll check
with the bell rafter and make
sure that it certainly does not.
Look, look, madam chair and
senator, there are significant
consequences here.
Because the county issued a
court to this.
And that remains outstanding.
$22 million in principle.
And $5 million of interest.
On bonds.
That they will have no way to
repay.
That actor?
Madam Chan's got, so.
They weren't house bills the
last 2 years, but the Senate
bills that tried to do that
died.
So it's the policies so far of
the city of Mexico that that
those contracts remain in place.
This bill is not intended at all
to usurp those contracts or to
deal with with those ice
facilities. I believe this would
allow those ice facilities to
continue on as they do now, but
we will, if this were to
If were to pass, we will double
check that with the uh.
The bill drop service and ensure
that that.
That's Senator plain reading of
the bill.
Is a plain reading of the bill.
And
In addition,
In addition
$6 million of revenue.
In addition
250.
Madam Chair and Senator, there's
there's no way that thank, thank
you Ma Senator Scott No I
appreciate your concern. I
believe those contracts are
through the Marshal's office,
but we will double check that it
is not the intent of this bill.
Jails
Uh, we, we do not want to mess
with jails because if you're in
jail, you're there because of
alleged criminal activity. We
want to deal with, with
interactions on the streets,
this is not a jail.
This is a, this is an illegal.
Processing facility.
It's not right and so the jail
well a jail by any other name is
kind of a jail, but Madam Chair,
Senator Scott, that facility in
Otero has a contract with the
Marshal's Office, not with ICE,
but once again we can go round
and round. That's not the intent
of this bill. We were assured
that it didn't do that. We will
make darn sure uh that there is
no uh uh uh room for
interpretation with regards to
that.
So, Madam Chair and Senator, you
are representing.
That these uh
Well, here's another one.
There's federal tax dollars will
be spent relocating.
4 courtrooms, 4 judges.
A 10 officers for the court area
8 officers for court security to
officers.
For escort 7 IC attorneys.
And 10 ice attorney offices, all
of which apparently
Or leased by the county.
Not sure this looks bad.
And
Thank you for
Thank you.
Thank you. Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
I, I
Just, um,
Well, I guess I, I just have a
brief statement, I think.
When the prince case came down,
the whole purpose of it was to,
to do
Um
To help the Brady Act was about
law enforcement.
Getting involved in doing
background checks, forcing.
State law enforcement to getting
involved.
And do a background checks for
people with guns.
And I was actually kind of
disappointed when the Prince
case came down just personally
cause I thought
You know, we need to get these
awful weapons off the streets
and, you know, this kind of a
good federal program to get
these weapons off the street.
But now you kind of look at the
wisdom of the case from the
other side. You always do that
when you're
When you're teaching or studying
law.
When you think about it.
Do you want to live in the
country.
Where something like
Where the federal government
comes and tells the state
government what
To do and what they may or may
not enforce. So the states
didn't want to get involved in
the background check business
they filed the lawsuit and the
court said, you're right.
The federal government cannot
commandeer.
Your state officials who do a to
to have to enforce a federal
program, which was the federal,
uh, the Brady Act.
And that's exactly what's going
on here.
Is this bill is a statement of
policy of the state of New
Mexico that we do not submit.
To having to
to being forced to do with the
federal government wants to do
here.
And I think it's important that
the states
stand up and say,
You know,
The federal government has its
policy, but we also have our
policies.
And I've done research into this
whole, the different, you know,
federal laws and state laws and,
and when the federal government
has to comply with the state
laws and, and that uh
relationship. In fact, I'm sort
of thinking of a lot of the
article.
But
Um
I believe very strongly.
That the states should not
involve themselves.
With immigration enforcement.
And I am very proud to support
this bill.
Because it is not our business.
This is a public safety bill.
And we have immigrants that if
we, if, if the states are
starting to collaborate with an
agency.
that has done so much harm to
our communities, not to demonize
them, but if you read a lot of
the reports about what IC has
done, it's not good.
There report after report has
shown that ice.
Um
Fails to respect basic human
rights.
And so I am very, very proud.
That we can pass a policy.
To not collaborate with an
agency with such a terrible
track record.
And I'll just tell a personal
story about
Um
One of the things I've seen I or
I'm aware that I did, I wasn't
present for this one.
But I, um,
Went for one of our clients went
to her home.
And said
We're here to pick up and it
happened to be her ex-boyfriend
who used to live there.
But she had a U visa.
And he said he's not here. He
hasn't lived here for 3 years.
And
At that point, I was supposed
to, and then she said, do you
have a warrant? They did not
have a warrant.
So then they're supposed to say,
sorry, ma'am. Thank you very
much. We'll either go get a
warrant or whatever. But what
they did,
they went in through a window.
It was the summer.
They went into a window of the
home.
chased her
Found her under a bed and then
pulled her out and she had legal
documentation.
Thank goodness the 14 year old
daughter filmed the whole thing
with her phone.
And I took her, even though she
had, you know, she had temporary
status with the application for
the U visa.
her and detained her. It took a
week to get her out of there.
And what really helped was the
video of ISIS's outrageous
behavior by going into a
violating.
All kinds of law and policy.
There is a report and I, I
didn't, but there is, every year
there's a report about ISIS's
conduct.
And it's not pretty.
So I am very, very proud to
support a bill.
It states a policy that we are
not going to collaborate with an
agency that has done so much
harm.
To our communities and to people
within our communities.
Federal policy is federal
policy.
State policy is state policy,
and I think we should, I, I'm
proud that this.
Hopefully will become our state
policy.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you.
Other questions?
Any other questions, Senator
Charlie and Senator Galos,
you'll go for a second time.
Senator, thank you, Madam Chair,
um, and thank you, senators.
Why do we need this bill?
What's happening right now to
bring us to this point.
Adam Chair, uh, Senator Charlie,
um, I think it's very clear, uh,
where we stand right now uh in
terms of our federal government
and in terms of our state
government, and there's fear
across the country, across the
state, and that is very clear.
And
There's no direct delineation of
who we are.
Apprehending and who we are not.
Madam Chairwoman, Senator
Charlie, I think.
There's an aspect of humanity
that is dismissed here, um, and
a lot has been said.
And I appreciate our colleagues
for embracing the things that
are moving forward here and the
things that we're presenting and
questioning it.
Um, I believe there's several.
Things that have been said about
oaths of office that I think are
also pertinent to note, uh,
Madam Chair and Senator Charlie.
Because
Understanding.
People who are undocumented.
is a complex notion.
And understanding immigration
process is another complexity.
Understanding access and
privilege is another one. I
appreciate all of you, Madam
Chairwoman and Senator Charlie.
And I appreciate the service.
Uh, of all of those who've
served, including Senator Block.
And I will note Senator Charlie,
that I too have taken an oath,
just as many of you have.
But I've taken an oath of
citizenship.
Madam Chairwoman, I took an
oath.
As a federal appointee.
And Madam Chairwoman, I took an
oath as an elected official.
And I think we are here to
ensure that we are standing and
protecting our communities while
respecting the law.
Madam Chair, Senator Charlie, I
would like to also ensure that
we take us back to the analysis
that also notes.
That it's very clear, and this
is the FIR specifically noting.
New Mexico State Police would
still be able to assist federal
authorities in human and other
illegal trafficking and migrant
rescue operations. The
corrections department noted
that it coordinates with federal
immigration authorities.
If and when a federal
immigration warrant is
presented.
And again, Madam Chairwoman and
Senator Charlie. Under the 10th
Amendment, states do not have to
cooperate with federal
immigration law.
Especially at a time.
Like now?
Where the fear is very pleasant
across our communities, Madam
Chair and Senator Charlie.
And
I believe that humanity is
important, and I believe that
respect matters.
yield.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator Nava.
We have 3 sovereigns in this
country.
If the federal government.
We have state government, we
have tribal government.
Each one of those three
sovereigns.
As unique governance powers.
Each has the ability
The self-govern.
But there's also a clear
separation of power, especially
between the federal.
And the state government.
And that is what this is coming
down to.
We don't enforce the federal law
when it comes to cannabis.
It's in practice.
Now
We can point to very clear
examples.
Where we have delineated as a
state.
Who enforce what's best for our
citizens.
And so I thank you.
For bringing this forward, Madam
Chair and senators.
And I think some of the
questions that we're asking.
this afternoon.
the wrong question.
It's asking for being asked.
What happens if we don't stand
down?
Not what happens if we don't
stand up.
And we are a state.
Or a state of people in New
Mexico that resist hate.
And embraced community care.
We resist
Inhumanity
And we fight for one another's
dignity, and we must resist mass
deportation.
To continue protecting belonging
in New Mexico.
Yes, criminals need to be
detained and held accountable.
I've spent my career dedicated.
So
ensuring the safety and security
of some of the most vulnerable.
This is not the way to do it.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. Thank you. Any
other questions?
For a 2nd time, Senator Gallegos
or Senator Pinto, I'm sorry, did
you?
OK, Senator Finto.
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Pinto with a second
from Senator Nava.
And Senator Guy goes for a 2nd
time.
chair that I was gonna go to a
question, but after the last
dialogue, uh, I don't know if
there's any reason for it. I
just want to remind everyone
that um I, I believe this should
be a public safety bill, but I
think we should protect the
Mexicans first, Madam Governor
has already called for a special
session, probably in October.
Because of the same fear she
has.
As I have
If we do not do what is mandated
by federal government.
From its peak, we asked them to
help us.
They did.
Now we're saying we won't help
you.
I think there's penalties in
that, but I, I would say that uh
I think they just shows.
That we are putting others ahead
of.
native New Mexicans or Mexicans
as a whole, I think that we
consider
Protecting people.
But not
Criminals and with that on.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator.
So we're on the do pass motion
in a second.
Senator
Senator Black for a 2nd time.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, just
real quick.
You know, um, one of the
senators
I wrote it down cause I, I
couldn't agree more.
And this is the crux of the
situation of discussion, the
debate, and it's been a
respectful debate, and I greatly
appreciate that.
And you and I have talked.
A lot, so thank you.
One of the senators said, and I
quote, Criminals need to be
detained and held accountable.
Madam chair and in panel, this
is, this is what
One of our great presidents,
Abraham Lincoln, one of the
tenets of our country that he
believed in the rule of law and
the importance of the
Constitution.
As a safeguard of liberty?
He advocated for our nation to
always uphold the law and the
Constitution.
That's what that's what we're
arguing.
Which is fine. I think everyone
will agree lawyers.
Have a different opinions. They
can argue on type of green this
is right here.
But
I want everyone to understand.
Those who are against this bill,
it's not anti-immigration by any
means.
I'll tell you a personal story.
for me.
It was Afghanistan 2006.
I think we talked about this.
I was almost killed in
Afghanistan.
My life was saved by my Muslim
interpreter.
Amra Samir
Wonderful, wonderful young man.
Hamraz and his family were
targeted by the Taliban.
They're gonna get killed.
Unfortunately, we left many
people behind in Afghanistan
have been wiped out by the
Taliban.
I did everything I could, Madam
Chair, in panel.
To get Hamraz here in this
family to the United States.
And they did it the right way.
Like millions of other
Americans.
Coming from
Every country around the world,
I would argue, did it the right
way.
That's the argument.
That we're making
We're a root nation of laws.
If we are no longer a nation of
laws, we're no longer a nation.
This isn't about being
anti-immigrant.
This is about being a nation of
laws is how we look at it. And
everyone's got their personal
story and I respect it. I really
do.
Because I think that's what
makes this country so unique is
the diversity that we have in
this.
We all come from somewhere.
For the most part.
My family
Jews emigrated.
From Russia, Ukraine, Belarus.
Or from Quebec.
Or from England.
For me.
We all have different stories.
But we come here as Americans.
Legally, we want people here to
contribute.
I was talking to my wife, Madam
Chair.
Senators, panel.
Last night about this bill.
And I told her
You know, it's interesting.
She can come here from China.
He's American.
I can never be
Chinese
Never be China.
I'll never be accepted as
Chinese.
I'll never be accepted as German
when I was living in Germany.
But when you come here, you're
accepted as an American, and I
think that's a great thing when
you're an American here.
You believe in the tenets of our
republic, not democracy, we're a
republic.
The tenants are
We believe in the rule of law,
no matter what we treat
everybody.
Again, I appreciate the
respectful debate. um.
And be interested to see what
happens to this bill.
Look forward to it. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you.
It's called the wrong.
Senator Block.
Senator
Senator Charlie.
guy.
And another.
He asked him to explain.
Pinto, Senator Scott.
Center Lopez, yes.
Hickey, Senor Lopez.
Yes.
To explain your vote, Senator
Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um, once again, I offer the
reminder that if you are not
Native American or American
Indian.
Then you're people immigrated
here.
Someone in your lineage came to
the United States in the hope of
a better future.
And I can't help but sit here.
And wonder
But your forefathers.
would say to you.
After this conversation.
I'd also like to read something.
Just a short promise.
For all those who continue to
seek refuge in this country.
Give me your tired.
You're poor.
Your huddled masses yearning to
breathe free.
It is nothing short of terrorism
against a vulnerable group of
people.
We want nothing more than to
exist.
Here
To answer that call.
I promise you, they are yearning
to breathe free.
The majority of people who
immigrate to this country and to
our state are not criminals.
And we must stop treating them.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Nava.
Explain your vote.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
This is a public safety bill.
And I just want to remind
everyone.
And thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
Thank you, Senator Charlie for
your words.
And not everyone has the same
type of access and that we have
a broken immigration system.
Many of our parents did not
choose to come to this country
without legal status. They
sacrificed to see their children
have a better life.
Hence, here I am sitting here as
a reflection of the many who
don't have a voice or a mic.
And I would like to remind
everyone about the humanity.
And to have respect for what you
do not know.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator, Senator
Pinto.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
People who do not break the law.
Have various complexion.
you.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair, when I
signed up for this job. I signed
up.
To support and defend the
Constitution of the United
States.
The Constitution and laws.
With the state of New Mexico.
Not
Just those that I deemed.
Convenient
Thank you.
Thank you.
And by a vote of 5 to 4, you
have a Du pass recommendation.
Thank you.
Next, Senator Stephanic, I think
you're, here you are.
Senate Bill 39.
Add classes to prior
authorization drugs.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, um, hopefully
this won't take me too long.
I am here tonight to present a
Senate Bill 39 as amended. It is
the governor, uh, governor's
bill.
It uh takes away
preauthorization.
Or rare diseases.
Rare diseases are defined by the
National Institutes of Health,
which is under the FDA.
As under 200,000 people in the
country.
And um we, the first amendment
that we put on had to deal with
identifying that the off-label
and on label drugs for a disease
had to be FDA approved.
So my expert witness is online,
uh, Miss Debbie Armstrong. I
also have members of the Office
of the Superintendent of
Insurance here who can speak to
any questions about how this
would work.
But we have already taken away
some of the barriers for step
therapy.
The original bill that we did
for step therapy, and insurance
company says you have to start
with aspirin or something
similar to that before you can
go to the next level, the next
level, the next level.
If you had certain diseases.
When we did our step therapy
bill.
had actually said that your
health care provider, if they
said you needed extra drug, you
should have extra drug.
And if the insurance company
denied you.
You had the right to appeal to
the Office of the Superintendent
of Insurance and get a response
back within a certain period of
time.
So we did that first bill, and
then we and the list was long.
It included MS, uh, rheumatoid
arthritis, cancer, etc. The next
step therapy build that we did.
Had to deal with immunological
diseases.
And we passed that, and it was
very bipartisan that we passed
that one as well.
So this tonight is a
pre-authorization bill to do
away with pre-authorization for
off-label and on-label
prescription drugs for rare
diseases.
And I'd like uh my expert to
speak, Miss Debbie Armstrong.
Miss Armstrong, would you like
to say a few words?
Thank you. Um, thank you, Madam
Chair, members of the committee
for allowing me to participate,
um, by Zoom, um, and if I can,
and I'm representing the
governor's office. Um, but I'm
also, um,
Uh, someone who this directly
impacts, and I thought, putting
a face um in a story is uh um
Useful and understanding um the
complexities and, and issues.
And so, um,
I'll tell you my story and I'll,
I'll, I'll be brief. Um, last
year, I was diagnosed with a
rare autoimmune disease, uh
called necrotizing myopathy.
And it is um as bad as it
sounds, my own body was, um, uh,
damaging and killing my muscle
cells.
And uh it took me um a little
while to get a diagnosis cause
it's uh very rare and um as
Senator Stefaniks said rare is
defined as under 200,000 cases
in the US, uh, this particular
um form of myopathy, there's
under 10,000 cases in the US,
um,
And so by the time I was um
diagnosed, I had lost a lot of,
of muscles and a lot of uh
function.
And uh immediately my uh oh my,
and my doctor confirmed my
diagnosis by a muscle biopsy and
antibody tests and um the um
Treatment that has shown the
most promise uh for this
particular type of myopathy is
immunoglobulin infusion and so
that's what uh he ordered and
went about the process of uh
doing prior auth.
I was denied 3 times.
Um, uh, peer to peer review and,
and additional, um,
Uh, denials, uh, I was denied
first because it wasn't an FDA
approved drug specific to the
disease, denied by under peer to
peer and then denied again.
Um, and it took um and uh you,
those who know me know that as a
um
Former state representative and
chair of the House Health and
Human Services Committee. I know
people. I, and I run an
insurance program for people
with um high risk conditions. So
I am well aware of how insurance
works. I know the players, uh,
at my insurance company, I can
pick up the phone and call the
CEO. Uh, it, that didn't do me
any good. And by the time I
managed to um fight the referral
that denials.
And get approval for treatment.
I was almost completely
dependent. Um, I was, um, on the
verge of having to think about
um a different living
arrangement, uh, it's I
couldn't, um,
Uh, probably live on my own and
I'm also the caretaker for my
mother, which means she would
also had to be um differently um
how it's probably put in a
nursing home. Uh, so this was,
um, very rapidly progressing
every day, and um,
Uh, so the issue, um, really is
when you have a rare disease and
there aren't very many people uh
impacted. There's not enough to
do clinical studies.
And, uh, or and enough clinical
studies to get FDA approval. So,
rare diseases, uh, usually, um,
most often do not have an FDA
approved drug that is specific
for that disease because uh for
FDA approval, you require it,
you have to have clinical
trials. And so while this uh
treatment regime was uh written
up uh in, in uh peer-reviewed
journals, and it was
um, uh, which I found on NIH uh
um uh website, um, and there was
uh
Um, clinics that specialize in
myopathies including this one
around the country who uh wrote
case studies about the
effectiveness of the treatment,
uh, some of which were even uh
quoted in the medical
guidelines, um, in the
insurances, um, uh, guidelines
for, um, prior.
And yet it was not enough. Peer
to peer wasn't enough, um, uh,
and so that's uh that's why, um,
Uh, this is so important. This
bill is so important. Uh, last
year, you um approved, um,
That, uh, in past legislation,
uh, uh, that prior auth was not
required for autoimmune cancer
and
Uh, substance use disorders, uh,
for an FDA approved drug, but
the carriers, and mine was
autoimmune, but also rare. Um,
my carrier interpreted and when
I talked to other carriers, they
interpret it as not including
off-label use. Uh, so the FDA
drug had to still be
specifically approved for the
specific disease, and that's not
gonna happen in rare disease,
so.
Um, I humbly ask for your
support. Uh, if I, if I had
trouble.
And I know how to pursue, um, an
appeal. And I know who to call
and I know how to apply
pressure, and I know the words
to use. I can't imagine the
people who don't.
Um, who, who don't have that
knowledge, who are sick and
being hit with a, uh, a denial.
It says they can't have their
treatment. And if they don't
have a very cooperative doctor
willing to fight for him, uh,
which I did and it still took um
weeks, um, to, uh, get approval,
um, during which I was
Um, going down in function every
single day.
So with that, uh, I will stop.
I'm happy to answer questions
and I, I ask for your support of
Senate Bill 39. Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Armstrong, and
it's nice to hear you.
So madam chair with us today is
Viera, uh, who is from OSI who's
the director of Life and Health
Insurances, Doctor Alejandro,
uh, who is our the their
pharmacist and also Doctor
Monica who's online and she's a
consulting physician with them
right now. Uh, I would stand for
support, opposition, comments,
questions.
Thank you very much, Senator.
We go to the audience. Is there
anyone here in support of Senate
Bill 39.
And if so, if you'd like to.
stand and make a comment.
There's a microphone like to
just stand behind senator
Stephanics.
Please.
Um, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Vara Akiva
and I'm the life and how
division director with the
office of the Superintendent of
Insurance, patients with rare
diseases often require
specialized time-sensitive
therapies and any delays in
treatment can lead to worse than
health outcomes or irreversible
disease progression.
Eliminating prior authorization
for off-label use of FDA
approved medication, removes
unnecessary barriers, ensuring
that individuals with rare
diseases receive the appropriate
care in a timely manner, or as I
think Miss Armstrong and Senator
Stephanics for bringing this
bill forward and urges your
support. Thank you.
Is there anyone else in support?
Anyone in opposition?
If you would please.
Again, introduce yourself and
then your statement.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Jonathan Buxton. I'm with the
pharmaceutical Care Management
Association. We are the National
Association representing
pharmacy benefit managers and
More, more than um.
Excuse me, more than in
opposition, we are rising to
express concerns related
specifically. I mean, there's
significant concerns about
patient safety with off-label
use of drugs, there's condition.
There are very large
implications related to the
fiscal impact that you see in
your report. But also there's
issues related to
implementation, um, and we're
going to continue to work with
this sponsors and try to find
ways to make sure that if this
were to pass, that it's actually
implemental implementable,
that's not even a word, but that
we could be implemented. So,
working with the sponsors and
grateful for the ongoing
conversations they're having
related to other amendments.
Thank you. Anyone else in
opposition?
Is there anyone online?
No one online.
So with that, Senator, we'll go
to questions or comments from
committee members. Senator
Pinto.
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Pinto with a 2nd
from Senator Siddiel Lopez.
Any questions? We're still in
discussion. Senator Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Madam
Chair, a note here.
Let's see.
Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services.
Have uh
But an established protocol for
the use.
Of these off-label medications.
Is that the first thing that
you're gonna try?
I guess my question is, how will
this piece of legislation
comport with these established
processes.
For the Medicaid, uh, Medicare.
reimbursement
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator Scott, as with the other
step therapy and prior auth
bills if um uh.
drug or pharma pharmaceutical is
denied, the patient and the
health care provider has to
appeal it to the office of the
Superintendent of Insurance. So
it does go through a peer review
to determine that this um
Recommended drugs. Now remember
we're only talking about your
healthcare providers saying you
should use this.
Or we haven't had success with
other drugs, so you should go
ahead and try this next one. And
we're talking about physicians,
we're talking about um nurse
practitioners and physicians'
assistants who have prescribing
authority in our state, but if
the health insurance company
decides they don't want to go
along with the prescription,
then there would be an appeal to
a peer reviewed uh group at the
uh OSI and Vara, do you want to
come?
Madam Chair and Senator, will
that remain the process.
Yes, we have a process in place,
uh, Madam Chair, Senator, for um
appeals.
When an individual is denied. So
I think VR would like to speak
to them.
Briefly.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair,
Senator Scott, I also want to
clarify that this legislation
does not apply to Medicaid and
Medicare policies. It's, it only
applies to policies in the
commercial market which are
subject to LSI jurisdiction.
Um, as well as the, um, yeah,
that's it. Thank you.
Dinner.
OK. So,
Yes, the next obvious question
would be.
Madam Chair, Madam chair.
The people on Medicare, Medicaid
don't get rare diseases.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, of
course, we get, I'm on Medicare,
of course, rare diseases occur
and uh remember we also did the
prescription donation bill that
went through here as well, and
the board of Pharmacy would uh
take care of that with some
national groups.
So it is my hope that we are
building a support system for
individuals who really are very
ill and need that kind of
support, but in the case of
Medicare, I will tell you that I
have been denied.
Some, some pharmaceuticals that
I was on for 20 years.
And then I had to appeal it and
finally the supplemental um
Company and talked with Medicare
and we got the approval for what
I needed, but
There are glitches in the
system.
Even for Medicare patients.
So, Madam Chair, Madam Chair,
this only applies to in the
private market.
And uh have to assume.
that the reason why this is not
Available in the Medicare
Medicaid.
Market is for a reason.
That's
That is correct, Madam Chair,
Senator. It's for cost
containment.
Now, I, the only other comment I
would make, uh, man center is we
are talking about a very, very
small population.
As Mr. Armstrong said, he's one
of less than 10,000 in the
entire country.
Uh, Senator Harramio in the last
committee talked about how his
brother had a rare form of
hemophilia, and he would um have
benefited from it if he had had
that available.
OK, I believe I saw in the write
up, madam chair.
Madam Chair, that there's 2 less
than 200,000 in the nation. Do
we know how many in New Mexico.
Well, OK, so a rare disease,
there can be several rare
diseases, and we had and we
actually I talked to Doctor
Monica Snowden, uh, who works
with the Office of
Superintendent of Insurance at
the last meeting, and we were
trying to get a list, but
there's not a list because.
Physicians are daily identifying
people with something new that
is not in the textbooks, that is
not in uh what they have learned
and so they are having to reach
out to the um National
Institutes of Health to
determine if there is a category
for that and whether or not
there are uh.
Prescribed pharmaceuticals for
that condition, and that's why
things are constantly what
that's why pharmaceuticals are
constantly being developed
because we have new conditions
all the time.
So, uh, Miss Armstrong is one of
10,000 in the entire country
just for her own disease.
Not for any others, just for her
own.
So, um,
Every
Illness that would qualify.
Has to be under that 200,000
mark for the entire country.
So
Madam Chair, madam chair, the
rigorous process.
For diagnosing one of these
custom diseases.
Uh, relies on uh
single physician.
is that
I would not say that, um, Madam
Chair, Senator, when you have a
rare disease, it's because
you've gone from uh provider to
provider to provider who says
you might have this. I'm gonna
send you to the next one. So
let's say I go to my primary
care, who sends me to a
rheumatologist who then sends me
to a specialist in osteoporosis,
who then sends me to the
endocrinologist who then sends
me to the cancer doc. And so
there are, there could be
several um
Healthcare providers in a string
trying to diagnose a particular
person, uh, and their condition.
That's not based upon one
person.
Thank you for your answers.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Any other
questions?
Being none we're on a due pass
motion.
And if you could please call the
roll.
Tinner block
our boon.
Yes.
Charlie.
Diegos.
And no, yes,
and her pain.
Then I stopped.
Andero Lopez.
Yes.
And hickey and Lopez.
Yes.
he wrote of 9 to 0, you have a
Du pass recommendation center.
Thank you. Thank you very much,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee.
Next we have Senate Bill 305.
Senator
Tobiasin, if you joined us up
front, please.
Hey, Senator.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
today I bring forward committee
sub for SB 305 creating a
quality foster parent
recruitment and retention task
force.
Since making the decision to run
for public office, I felt a deep
and commitment, a deep
commitment to work to improve
the outcomes of our children and
families of the foster care
system.
As a mother of two, I was
horrified to learn last week
that there are at least 41
children whom CYFD is a legal
guardian for that are on the
run.
Or missing.
As we see from the news reports,
children of all ages continue to
be forced to sleep in state
office buildings, and we don't
have an end in sight.
The situation is untenable.
This child protective services
system was designed to protect
our most at-risk youth.
But today the system seems to
cause more harm instead of
helping children and families
thrive.
In 2020 CYFD and HSD settled a
system reform lawsuit with 13
children in youth and foster
care.
Referred to as the Kevin S.
Settlement, CYFD and HSD
promised to fix New Mexico's
broken foster care system.
To recruit and retain an
adequate number of foster homes,
increased behavioral health
services to develop an adequate
workforce trained in
trauma-informed care.
Today.
5 years later,
The once groundbreaking reform
effort is at a standstill.
And the plainest invoked
arbitration to enforce these
broken promises.
Our kids can't wait.
And I'm committed to finding
solutions.
Nationally 1 in 3 foster
families will quit within their
first year of fostering.
New Mexico has unique challenges
that make it even harder to
foster.
Quality foster parent
recruitment and retention is the
foundation of fixing our broken
foster care system and keeping
already traumatized children
from sleeping in state offices.
This committee serve is a work
of collaborating with community
members and ensuring critical
voices at the table for this
task force.
With that, I stand for
questions.
Oh thank you, and I failed to do
the proper.
Motion
Um, I didn't realize we had a
committee substitute in front of
us, so my bad.
So, um, would you like to
Senator Pinto, please?
So I motion for a do not pass
bill 305.
And for you pass on.
And it helped and public affairs
Committee substitute for Senate
Bill 305.
23164 8.1.
Thank you, and the chair will
second it, and it's just for
purposes of discussion.
So, and you've already done your
explanation, so we kind of did
this backwards, but.
It's a little late for the
evening.
me and my time frame.
Oh, OK, so then with that,
you've already done, did your
expert witness wish to say a few
words?
Thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Marilyn Beck. I'm the founder
and executive director of the
Mexico Child First Network, were
dedicated to improving the lives
of children in foster care, and
empowering those who serve them,
including foster parents,
kinship caregivers, and
professionals. Um, I'm also on a
national child welfare
innovation Committee that, um,
Has been looking for solutions
to get kids sleeping out of the
kids sleeping in the office, out
of the offices that's happening
pretty consistently statewide,
um, and
As we've brought forward
solutions, this task force
brings forward a couple ideas.
You and I were on the SM5 task
force. Um, this task force would
convene a group of 16 um experts
and dedicated individuals, um,
Utah is a unique model. The
governor 25 years ago
statutorily created a non-profit
to remove the foster parent
recruitment, retention and
education piece out of what is
their CYFD, um, and so that
model, they've never to this day
had a child sleep in the.
Office and it's an it's a
nonprofit statutorily created.
Another idea that was brought up
several times in our task force
that this task force could
specifically look at is
county-run systems. A lot of
states, 9 in particular, have
county runs state systems
instead and and is that a better
outcome for foster parent
recruitment and retention. And
so with that, I think we're
happy this year.
Thank you. Let's go to the
audience. Is there anyone in
support of this.
Memorial, not memorial. This is
a bill. Sorry.
I'm thinking memorial.
Is there anyone here in support?
Anyone in opposition?
Is there anyone on Zoom?
OK, see, we'll go to questions
or comments from committee
members. Senator Pinto, thank
you, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, and thank you for the
bill.
On, um, page 3.
13 to 15.
To the task force of collaborate
with the institution of higher
education.
The Institution of.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members. It's been
suggested, especially even after
our task force that if you can
bring in a research entity like
a UNM or an NMSU. They have the
School of Social Work and and
Center of Innovation that they
could help actually do some
evidence-based practices in the
recommendations.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee,
so who is the fair institution,
um, willing to
do this or do I guess in some
sense, do they have experience?
There to to move forward on
such.
Or have we had such
As course
Yeah,
yeah, great question. Thank you,
Madam Chair and committee
members. Um, Eastern New Mexico
University has a great social
work program as in Mexico
Highlands, um, and so in past on
the health side of things, um,
house health is always
encouraged partnership with one
of those to really have
evidence-based research entity,
and if we're going to do this
and, and again, figure out what
is working and what is not an
evidence-based practice and a
research entity partnering with
BBER at UNM or a school of
Social Work.
Um, would be a really good way
to do it.
So, Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
And um
Any, anything in here, um.
Of who they would report to,
would they be reporting to us or
just?
So just to the HHSC.
But no report to CYFD.
Um, Madam Chair, yes, they would
report to CYFD and then the
legislative finance Committee.
And on page 4.
That last paragraph.
I don't, I'm not sure what
you're, Madam Chair, I don't
know, I'm not sure what you're
looking at.
Well, on the committee, Senator
on the committee substitute, it
did.
I add the legislative finance
committee.
But not
I don't see
CD, I'm sorry.
Senator CYFD is the entity that
will be
Hosting, organizing.
Whatever you want to call him.
Sorry.
Is that all?
OK.
Senator Sio Lopez.
Um
Oh, thank you. I think it's a
good idea and I think that it'll
um
probably results in productive
ideas and it, it's really good.
Um,
Is the only difference between
the committee sub and the
And the original bill is the
stripping of the appropriation,
but the only difference.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members. We actually
added a few members at the
request of feedback from
stakeholders including um
specifying relative kinship
caregiver, which would be
appointed by aging and long-term
services. Um, we had the, um,
We had someone, one member who's
a tribal member with lived
experience, um, they would be
appointed by the Indian Affairs
department. Um, and then one
member of the lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, queer, or
expansive community, and they
would be appointed by CYFD as
well as with the FIR it said it
would be a negligible expense,
so it just made sense that if we
were going to strike it in
Senate Finance to just strike it
cleanly here.
Great. Thank you. I, and I
appreciate that, that those were
probably very good additions,
um, do you, did you get money to
do this in HB 2?
Oh, thank you. That's actually a
great question. So FIR said it
would be the negligible expense.
Also, there's undergrowth from
FY 25. There's three separate,
we're now in the 2nd year of it,
$1.25 million explicitly to CYFD
to recruit and retain foster
parents, so that money is
existing.
Excellent, um, that, that's just
awesome. I'm so glad. I just
wanted to share with you that I
did a similar thing for the task
force of updating the Family
Violence Protection Act, the way
I did it was as a Senate
memorial with growth funds.
To, to get that done. Um,
So I, I just think it's a
terrific idea and thank you for
bringing it.
I can't because I spoke.
OK. Thank you very much, um,
Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, and
thank you, senators, Senator for
bringing this forward and um
this fact.
I apologize for not, um, having
a conversation reached out and
they want to acknowledge that,
um.
Just
My really quick math to reach
parody on the task force.
for the number of native
children, um, it, it says 2.85.
I'm wondering if um
Before this moves for an
accommodation for a equa tribal.
social worker.
Um, I see the lived experience
here, but I think they bring a
really unique perspective.
That would be really helpful to
the task.
Madam Chair, Senator Charlie, I
think that's a fantastic
recommendation. OK. Yes, thank
you for that. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Senator.
So Senator Charlie, did you want
to amend it?
Or you want to just as it moves
forward to have.
Madam Chair, yeah, I don't want
to slow us down. I'll work with
Senator Tobias then too.
OK. All right. Just to clarify.
Um, right, and then any other
questions, Senator Scott?
Uh, Madam Chair Marilyn.
on page 3.
Line 16.
Bold experiment.
That's not
Terminology we see a lot.
in legislature.
Did you offer a bit of an
explanation.
could I
Madam Chair and committee
members, um, it's time to be
audacious. We have kids sleeping
in the office. It's
unacceptable. We need to do
something and so when we were
drafting this, we explicitly
told the bill drafter we wanted
to be a little bit audacious,
and so that's what when the Utah
was doing their legislation,
they ran a similar settlement
agreement, and their governor
called for a bold experiment and
so we called for a bold
experiment.
And Madam chair, if I can add to
that your question on that
terminology this past Christmas,
we had, I think 20 plus children
sleeping in offices. And so that
staff could go home with their
families, they took those
children to an empty jail.
For Christmas.
Madam Chair, I would absolutely
agree.
I was just wondering if there
was a requirement in here.
To think outside of the box.
Madam Chair and committee
members, absolutely.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you for
Presenters and senator, that's
all. Madam Chair, if I can add
for you, Senator, um, our idea
of thinking out of the box is
not sending children to a cold
empty jail for Christmas.
Madam chair duly noted.
Thank you. Other questions?
And
Madam Chair, thank you.
Tobias and appreciate this I've
worked with Miss Beck forever.
um my quickest question because
we've got the attorney from
CYFD. I understand you're using
COAFD as a host.
Are they accepting that?
Oh, he's not seen, no, that
gentleman up front, sorry, so
the long beard. I apologize, and
Jansen, with no one from CYFD
here.
The cares
Uh, are you actually have an
agreement with the secretary on
this?
His house anderson.
Mister Tarrant, we, I've reached
out. I haven't heard back. They
were wonderful to work with on
the SM 5 task force, um, I think
we got a lot done, so kind of
been following suit from the SM5
task force, um, they were
extraordinarily collaborative.
So thank you for that my turn.
Center and Miss Becca, I bite my
tongue often because they
reneged on our deal in July.
On Saint Haven bill, so I'd say.
Uh tread carefully. I do want to
ask because I, I do not know the
Utah model you're using.
Uh, Is that where you get
I guess, could you explain to me
how we're using that model of
what it's gonna do for us here
in the state.
insurance
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members. Again, this
does not say we have to follow
the Utah model. It says that we
should look at the Utah model
because they were out of the,
they were in a consent decree 25
years ago, and their governor
called it a bold experiment and
said we have to figure out, and
they've never had a child sleep
in the office. They are the only
state I can find that can say
that. Um, they promoted a bold
experiment with the legislature
statutorily created. It's called
Utah Fostercare.org. You should
look it up. What
they are doing for foster
parents, rural caregivers,
native sovereign nations, native
tribes, pueblos, I mean, they
have thought outside of the box,
and they have made it work.
Um, I've looked, I've worked on
national groups. There's nothing
like it. And so it's time for us
to think outside of the box. Um,
there are just so that I can
count this, um, county-based
administration systems that are
worth looking at as well are
California, Colorado, Minnesota,
New York, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
Virginia. Um, so we have a we
have kind of have the 5 systems
and and regions, um, then there
are two hybrid states that also
are partially administered by
state and partially by counties,
and those are.
Nevada and Wisconsin, and I
think that one of the things we
can identify is that New Mexico
is a really diverse state in all
of our communities. So what
works in Bernalillo might not
work in um Clovis or Farmington.
So that's also worth looking at,
but
Um, other states are doing this
better, and it's time that also
we're putting a lot on CYFD. The
idea that we could take a piece
out and possibly really have a
sys systemic and systematic way
to support foster parent
caregivers, kinship as House
Bill 252 is going to make its
way over. It's time to do
everything we can in the kitchen
sink, um, when I was with Utah
foster care people, their entire
philosophy is get to yes.
It's incredible. It's incredible
to witness that for getting kids
out of the office and they do
get to yes and thank you for
allowing us to present this
because solutions do exist.
Thank you for that, ma'am chair
and center and.
Miss Beck, uh, in, in.
And go back in time, you know,
my daughter works for CY team,
my other daughter works also.
Uh, but if you'd remember, uh,
we broke the system or CYFDU did
after the Montelise issue in Lee
County, where we have really
good foster parents and see why
D sued and lost.
Because of the way they my
policy.
And I'm, I'm thinking just as
you're talking about task force
and center and respect is Mary,
uh, the last task force, and I
see everyone that you got
participating. I don't know if
you remember when I traveled
from Lee County to Albuquerque.
As a state wreck.
And see whyFD would not allow me
in to the task force meeting.
You perceive these people all
being accepted by
CYFT
Senator in America.
Madam, I, I can, I feel very
confident. I don't want to speak
for the secretary. I do think
she's working on transparency
and, and our SM 5 task force did
a great job of ensuring every
one of our, um, committee
meetings and 5 was open to the
public on Zoom, um, LFC convened
that they did not want to
convene this one. They asked not
to, um, so that's where it ended
with CYFD.
Well, thank you for that, Madam
Chair and Senator and Maryland,
uh, and I appreciate you going
to LFC because I've been put on
the LMC and I'd like to watch
it.
Uh, just historically, uh, to,
to see that there's, you know,
grateful you think she's trying
to fix CYD and have.
But we've never had
We talked year after year after
year on helping CYD fixing. I
like this is coming outside the
CYD and find other groups to be
able to fulfill the need, my
daughter same my works for CYD
spends many nights.
In the office
With children
We've never done a jail.
Thankfully
But it's just one of those
things that I know those
children are suffering.
Because of the way we handle
there, so uh I will be
supporting your bill as
Usually cause it's
It's got to change.
Uh, I, I hope.
I can't bite my tongue. You can
trust the secretary. I, I think
she's got transparency I've not
seen it, and I've talked often.
Uh, says something on Monday.
There's something different on
Tuesday.
So good luck, I'll be praying
for you and
Look for success and.
That's
Mount Gerald
Thank you, Senator Pinto.
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Pinto, the second
from the chair.
Um, and I would just like to
add, um, as
was being referred to the Senate
last year some of you were not
with us at the time.
Um, we did pass Senate Memorial
5.
Which passed the legislative
Finance Committee with uh
different membership that was
appointed by um both chambers.
Both sides of the aisle and
Miss Beck, of course, was part
of the task force and others.
I think we had the most open.
opportunity for dialogue all
summer.
And I believe that there is
Willingness from the executive
persons who were there, other
community members, we had
representation from
Lived experience, so that the
young people who've lived
through foster care, we're
actually present.
And I believe that um
With this moving forward.
that we will continue to have
this open dialogue because I, I
really believe there's a
commitment.
And we, Miss Beck and I were
there. We had some good
conversations too, um, but I
appreciate this being brought
forward.
What I will mention before we go
to the vote is that this is a
bill now.
What made me a better mode for
your consideration is to move it
into a memorial.
Because normally we don't put.
task forces and statute.
OK. It was an appropriation
before, which is why you had to
have a bill since the
appropriation has been stripped.
Um, because normally this would
go to finance, the appropriation
stripped, and it kind of moves
on from there. But without an
appropriation right now. It
doesn't go to finance.
per se.
So it's just a suggestion for it
to be converted into a memorial
as you move on to the next
committee.
Um, there can be some, some
movement that, that can be
helped with.
Because normally we don't put
task forces and statute.
So just definitely.
OK, but I think this will move
forward and then.
Oh, you can work with um ledge
counsel service to do a
conversion and such, but uh
that's just, we don't do that.
Thank you, Madam Chair. We'll,
we'll talk to the ledge counsel
and see.
So this bill may move forward,
it may mean that you may have
and memorials or I'm sorry, I'm
just.
s har ing information, but you
can always introduce a memorial
that this could be converted
into one working with
leadership, you know, Senator
Sheer and Senator Worth to
figure out maybe just a one
committee and you've already had
the hearing on this, um, at
least one more committee to go
through for a memorial only.
But work with the leadership on
where it gets designated, so a
suggestion.
So with that, if you could call
the role.
Senator B block.
And boom.
Charlie.
And our Gallegos.
And another, yes, and herinto.
Sinners.
Yeah.
The city of Lopez, yes.
Hickey and her love.
Yes.
And by a vote of 9 to 0, you
have a due pass recommendation.
Thank you.
Senator Padilla.
State Office of housing,
Planning and production.
And just so committee members
know, you may not have heard it
earlier, but I, I, I'm.
At 8 o'clock, we're done.
OK
So, just FYI.
We're doing good so far.
OK,
madam, for allowing us to do
this
this evening. I will say that uh
I do have my co-sponsor here,
Senator Nava. I invited her to
be a part of this bill because
of her vast experience in this
area, you may recall uh members
of this committee that were on
the committee last year.
And uh Madam Chair, I did
present this to this committee
last year. We did get out of
this committee and um I do have
other co-sponsors, so Senator
Nava, Senator Gonzalez,
Representatives Dixon and Anya
Nonu.
Uh, I have with me today also
the director of housing in the
governor's office, Daniel
Warworth, and then I also have
Taylor Cook, who is the um
homelessness um project manager
for the governor's office as
well. And I'm gonna go ahead and
Madam Chair, with your
permission, I'm gonna jump into
our description of what we're
trying to accomplish here. And
then uh I'll ask my co-sponsor
to say a couple of words, Mr.
Weor and Ms. Cook, and then we
go in whatever direction you'd
like, and I know you're limited
on, on time, so we'll be as
quick as we can. Um, again, this
is Senate Bill 205. This is our
an effort, and I will tell you,
Madam Chair, just like the uh
Boston Red Sox. I will keep
pushing this bill until I get
this thing done, just like in
2004 and it took those Red Sox
all that time to get there. Um,
Essentially what we're doing
here is we're proposing the
creation of the Office of
Housing, Planning and
Production, we thought we would
add those two words, Madam
Chair, very, very important
words in this, in this uh type
of work, which would be
administered, uh,
administratively attached to the
Department of Finance
Administration, but then being
in the governor's office.
The purpose for the legislation,
the primary objectives are to
reduce housing costs, increased
housing availability, including
low income and workforce
housing, uh maximize resources
to address statewide housing
issues, address factors
impacting housing costs and
limited supply, uh, enhanced
local capacity to address
housing needed to promote fair
housing, which we all know is
just a massive need out there.
We also intend to identify state
resources for housing that are
very scattered and
uncoordinated.
Um, and then also track how the
housing progress is going
through setting goals and making
sure that we're looking at those
on a regular basis and all of
that. Uh, the Office of Housing,
Planning and Production would be
set up this way. They would be
developing a statewide strategy.
They would provide technical
assistance to local governments.
Uh, they would align resources
across state agencies. They
would address underlying factors
which we all know I did serve
for a full year on the Housing
Investment Council, Madam Chair,
with Representative Dixon, and
we identified and that's where
we met this gentleman to my
right, by the way, and thought,
there's a great guy, we should
have him come and help us with
housing. And uh and there's a
whole number of slew of things
that are going on that are
preventing housing here in New
Mexico and the stalwart there
also coordinating across state
agencies, uh, collecting and
reporting housing data including
land use, etc.
Uh, so essentially that, that's
essentially where we're at. And,
and what are we trying to
accomplish here, uh, Madam Chair
and, and, uh, uh, vice chair and
ranking member, we at the moment
have about a 42,000 hole in the
doughnut, if you will, on
housing right now within the
next 10 years, that is, if we
don't do something yesterday, we
are expected to see that rise to
about 85,000 over the next
decade. Very, very, you know,
that for all of us. Um, rents
have gone up anywhere from 27 to
60%.
In different parts of New
Mexico, Madam Chair, uh, we
believe that there's a number of
regulatory issues that are
facing us there. We need some
coordination again, um.
You know, I was lucky enough to
sponsor the bills that created
the early childhood education
and care department, the
broadband office, the
cybersecurity office, and the
reason I'm a business owner and
I look at things from a
problematic and how do we make
the throughput where it needs to
be. We have so many different
agencies delivering early
education. Well, now we've got
coordination there. We had 17
agencies trying to deliver
broadband. Now we have
coordination there. We have 76,
77 officers trying to manage our
privacy. There's the
cybersecurity office.
I see this as another step in
the right direction, Madam
Chair, to coordinate our housing
needs and to make sure that
someone is waking up every day,
eating, sleeping, and drinking.
How do I deliver housing in New
Mexico to the people who need it
the most. Um, and then I'll wrap
my comments up, Madam Chair,
with we do have in different
parts of the budget, I serve on
finance and um when we, when we
kind of rack it all up, we did
125 or so million last year
through the office of
Opportunity Enterprise Act,
which
So and Representative Dixon
created 2 or 3 years ago. This
year we see about a total of
$130 million available for
housing, and we need some
coordination, we need some
governance to make sure that
this is getting done the right
way. I'm gonna ask my co-sponsor
to say a few words, Mr. Warworth
and Miss Cook.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you, Senator. I am very
proud to co-sponsor this bill
within our Padilla, as he
stated, um, we are at a time of
urgency in housing in New Mexico
and as some of you know, I did
come from the US Department of
Housing and Urban Development,
where I saw the work nationally
and what happens when we don't
take action, and I think New
Mexico is in a prime time to
take action and implementing the
Office of housing will not be
unprecedented states.
across the country have offices
of housing, madam, uh, chair,
uh, that have been extremely
successful, um, and I believe a
few of the, a few of them are
actually our neighbors in
Colorado and Arizona, and I
think it's really important to
note that having an office of
housing, um, within, uh, within
us would really help in funding
and resource allocation. It
would essentially be a mini hu
within this at the state level,
which I think would really be
supportive of all of the things
that we do.
with from homelessness
prevention to regulation of our
housing uh enforcement to
disaster and recovery, um, and
also I would know that some of
the probably best states that I
saw do this very efficiently. We
probably California and New York
have really good examples of how
they have implemented their uh
their offices of housing and
something also that I wanted to
highlight is that the Office of
Housing here in New Mexico would
work with local regional, tribal
and state-level stakeholders to
identify existing barriers for
housing.
production. I will pass it over
to our experts now. Thank you
Madam Chair, Mr. We.
Thank you, Senator, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. Um, my
name is Dana Warworth. I've
spent the last 20 years working
on housing in New Mexico, um,
doing housing plans for local
communities from Lee County to
Taos County and uh also building
affordable housing um under the
same sort of models that
everyone does and have seen the
issues that are holding us back,
um, uh, Senator Padilla
mentioned the service on the
governor's housing Investment
Council.
And um that was an amazing
opportunity. And part of why I
chose to join her administration
a year ago was to stand up this
office. This is something I've
seen for the last 10 years as a
huge need. We do housing across
state government right now in a
completely uncoordinated way.
Um, I think, uh, there's a
number of examples, but I think
homelessness is a great example.
It probably takes 8 different,
uh, state offices or agencies to
assist someone who's unhoused,
uh, to get stabilized. Um, right
now they work without
coordinating
Um, the other big one is
regulatory frameworks. We've
included in the handout that
we've just provided a recent
article from Pew Charitable
Trusts regulatory frameworks are
different in New Mexico. They
take longer, it adds cost to
housing, whether it's market
rate or affordable housing.
Uh, this is a whole realm where
government can actually impact
the cost of housing. We can't
necessarily lower the cost of a
2 x 4. We can't necessarily
increase our construction
workforce overnight, although I
will try. Um, but what we can do
is work in these areas where we
can actually meaningfully lower
the cost of housing, um, to make
new housing, make it happen
faster, um, and the supply
shortage, which will shrink our
affordability problems. We'll
make our state dollars go
further, um, and hopefully, uh,
occurrences of homelessness, uh,
brief and rare in New Mexico,
um, with that I'd hand it over
to Taylor Cook, our director of
homelessness initiatives.
Thank you. Uh, thank you,
Senator. Thank you, Danielle.
Um, yeah, I'm Taylor Cook, the
director of Homeless
initiatives. I just started
about 2 months ago, uh office of
the governor. Um, we come to you
from Texas. I worked in the city
of Austin for a long time and
with our balance estate in
Texas, um, and most recently
I've been doing some research
with the city of Houston about
their um homelessness
initiatives as well.
Um, I'm really excited to be
here, particularly the
opportunity to work in an office
that's focused on housing. Uh,
we know that affordable housing
is our best prevention for
homelessness, and then housing
is gonna be our best cure and
help us get out of this.
Um, and I would just add to
that, you know, we've talked
about some coordination. Um,
we've already started to do some
of that work. I see a huge
opportunity in the stage around
coordination and prevention of
homelessness. I think that's
probably the best way for us to
get ahead of the problem. Um,
it's to just ensure that people
don't suffer, um the tragic
consequences of homelessness,
um, during their lifetimes. And
then just finally, um, I would
add that, um, I, I'm excited to
be here in New Mexico and doing
this work. I think this is gonna
be a huge innovation.
um I just across the nation like
being here on the ground floor,
working with housing and
homelessness.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. We had a
lot to say. Thank you.
Take it away.
Thank you, senators. We'll go to
the audience. Is there anyone
here in support of
Senate bill 205.
If you'd like to stand.
Um, using the microphone,
introduce yourself and your
statement, please. Thank you,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Randy train and
registered lobbyist for the New
Mexico homebuilders in the
apartment Association of New
Mexico, uh, I also served on the
state Investment council a year
or so ago and um uh I always, I,
I kind of hate to have to say
this, but housing has no home
and state government.
Uh, we have bits and pieces like
Daniel said, scattered all over,
but there's no central place for
this and our housing issues are
many and varied and are
significant and we deal with
these by introducing legislation
that addresses these issues on
just a piecemeal basis. And
that's how we set our policy for
housing in state government.
Um, it's time to start baking
housing decisions based on good
data rather than piecemeal
legislation. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Dan
Weeks, I'm representing Burnley
County. We, uh, recently, uh,
set up a collaborative for
housing in the middle of Rio
Grande Valley with the city of
Albuquerque and it's working
pretty well. Um, we're trying to
do the same thing at the local
level, that these folks will be
doing at the at the statewide
level, breaking down the silos
is absolutely essential,
streamlining the regulatory
process is absolutely essential.
And so this coordination at the
level will be a very, very good
thing. Thank you.
Thank you. Is there anyone here
in opposition?
See, that is, and I do have a
list of those who are on Zoom.
Natalie Green.
Uh, thank you, chair, members of
the committee. My name is
Natalie Green, the housing
administrator for the city of
Las Cruces. The city is
supporting Senate Bill 205,
access to housing is a critical
issue across New Mexico and many
communities, particularly rural
ones, lack the dedicated staff
and resources needed to develop
housing programs. This bill will
provide the necessary statewide
support to help both rural and
urban communities increase our
housing production, address
homelessness, and develop
programs tailored to our unique
needs. This legislation ensures
that every
regardless of our size or
capacity has the tools and
expertise to create some housing
solutions for our residents.
Thank you.
Thank you, Walter Borton.
Mr. Borton, uh, my apologies. I
didn't see that on screen. Uh,
good evening, ma'am, uh, chair
and senators, uh, I'm Walt
Borton, a Navy vet, and members
of the veterans and Military
Families caucus. Our caucus has
more than 560 members.
And we support this bill because
the needs, this new office will
address a legitimate and
significant in our community of
veterans and military families.
Many of us who are already
facing staggering housing costs
that are still on the rise.
We urge that you vote in favor
of Senate Bill 205. Thank you
very much for allowing me to
testify.
Thank you. Lisa Huva.
Good evening.
Good evening, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
here tonight, uh, on behalf of
Homewise, which is a nonprofit
organization committed to
helping people become homeowners
in New Mexico. We believe that
the creation of an office of
housing, planning, and
production will be an important
step in addressing the
affordable housing crisis in New
Mexico, and we urge the
committee to vote in support of
Senate Bill 205. Thank you.
Thank you. And there was no one
in opposition?
No? OK. Thank you.
So with that, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Senator Scott
Senator, I saw.
The FIR the that we already have
a
Department of Housing
Um, Madam Chair and senator, um,
ranking member.
We have a loosely put together.
Effort right now and we have a
one-man show essentially and now
we have a two-person show for.
There might be up to 4 and we're
at about 2.1 million people in
this state. We need 42,000
houses. I just need somebody
waking up every day, eating,
sleeping, and drinking to get
this thing done and coordinate
people to make this happen.
And Madam chair Senator would be
accurate to say.
Yeah
Our problems.
With housing development.
would be equally attributable.
To local issues.
As well as state issues.
Um, Madam Chair and, and
Senator, uh, when we met, uh,
for it was a total of 11 months,
the two of us were on the
housing investment council. That
was probably about 1/3 to 50% of
our conversation. So to answer
your question, yes. Uh, what we,
what you're going to see out of
this office is there's going to
be best practices that are
happening all over the state.
There's going to be
identification of things that
are holding up or string,
putting a stranglehold on
development, and those things
will be worked out. Uh there's
will be assistance to work these
things out, uh, to reduce that.
stress on the system. So yes,
you, you are right.
So Madam Chair, Senator
specifically with.
Regard to goals and objectives.
Or we're going to put a report
together for local communities
that says you have to do this,
this, and this to get your
Oh
develop a potential of how, how
is that going? Chair and
senator, if you go to page 4
starting on line 2, there is a
collect and report housing and
land use data and outcomes, and
there's a whole slew of items
there, um, evaluate needs and
progress toward those housing
goals identified geographic gaps
in housing availability. I said
I'm not going to read to you. I
know you can, can read all that.
But essentially ABCD, there's
specific items there. Um, also,
if you look back to
Um, page 3.
If you look over at line 16, uh,
also, you know, this office is
going to be helping all of us
analyze regulatory frame
frameworks surrounding land use
and zoning, building codes,
permitting those were some of
the things that we discussed
that were some of the biggest
problems that we're that we're
dealing with here. Um, we are,
you know, for the moment at
least, we are flushing cash and
we feel very good about that.
But I also want there to be some
governance on how that money is
going to be spent that we've
allocated for these purposes.
Uh, but to answer your question
on, on, on analysis, it's
absolutely lined out in the
bill, but we don't want to
restrict it just to what's here.
There will be a lot of creative
innovation in this office, and,
and I think that will help. And
I I I don't want to take all the
time with my co-sponsor wants to
say anything. Happy to do. Madam
Chair and senator now with
respect to
The state
Pos public.
Inhibiting housing development.
Well,
I'll uh use.
Just one example that I'm aware
of the
date
For the
Installation of EV.
charging stations in all new
construction.
And then another example that I
think we just passed.
Madam chair out of here a day or
two ago.
Rent control.
Is there going to be?
Some sort of adult in the room.
Developing best practices
recommendations so that that
kind of stuff.
Yes
get through this legislature.
So, uh, Madam Chair and senator,
um, this is a, a, an effort I've
been on for quite some time and
I will say that it's swimming in
its own swim lane. I like to use
that terminology a lot. So
that's a whole other set of
bills. This is on planning and
production of housing, not, not
rent, not, you know, that kind
of stuff, so.
that this office will have very
little to do with that.
Mm
Madam Chair, senators.
Rent control would have a huge
impact.
On the
Capital investment decisions
that were would be made.
Why housing.
Yeah, so, Madam Chair and
senator, again, that is a whole
other piece of legislation that
has nothing to do with what,
what we're working on.
I'm assuming that at some point
there may be data collection
that will be interesting for
this office to be looking at,
but they will have a little to
know oversight or things of that
nature.
Madam Chair and senators, I
would submit that it would be
important.
To have everything.
Going into those.
Capital investment decisions
that are being made.
As to whether or not
to deploy that in the state or
somewhere else.
And
And our public policy.
Contributing
To increasing those expenses or
reducing.
The projected return.
Absolutely imperative.
and I say Daniel shaking his
head, yes, over there.
Absolutely imperative that all
of that.
Be taken into.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Serio Lopez.
Me chair.
We did not pass the rent control
bill, we returned the issue of
whether to pass any kind of
Filled by any kind of
legislation dealing with the
control of rents to cities and
municipalities and.
We did not ask the rent control
bill, um, and on that topic.
Um, I really like that the ideas
here are going to be fresh and
outside the box, and you might
come for legislation or maybe go
to cities or counties or try to,
try to, uh
Move the needle and, and I said,
I think that's very, very
exciting, but one of the issues
that I've, I've mentioned it
several times that I felt
That I ran into kind of by
accident, was the fact that out
of state uh investment,
investors have been purchasing
large apartment complexes within
the city of Albuquerque and then
painting them. In fact, I found
out recently that there's a
company that just helps people
identify properties.
to be purchased, they might
paint them, but they don't put
any effort into increasing the
quality of the habitation.
And then they raised the rents,
kick out Section 8 or do
whatever to raise the rents so
that it then the
property is worth more.
And they flip it.
And of course that has a
devastating impact on
The cost of housing in
Albuquerque.
Um, I say that because I hope
that that's one of the things
that I don't know what could be
done about it, if anything, I'm
hopeful that work went control
might discourage that because I
think we're wide open, open,
saying, hey, do whatever you
want, if you come here.
And we won't do anything about
it, um, but I'm hoping that
that's something at least you
look into, publicize, make
people aware of, encourage.
In state owners not to sell to
out of state. I don't know uh
what can be done about it, but
it's been disturbing for me to
To see that, um, and then end up
negotiating with attorneys who
don't, don't even practice in
the state are not even located
located in the state.
Um, so,
I'm really delighted to support
this, and I also want to say I'm
so glad that the MFA, I mean,
it's on board and everybody's
singing the same tune, but, and
I'm really happy that you came
and talked to me about it
because just seeing, I thought,
oh my God, are we gonna have the
same issue? It's really great
that you have taken the time to
work this out, to show
You know, to make the pieces fit
together, and I'm really
delighted. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Senator. Other
questions?
Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, panel.
Just a couple quick things here,
um, Senator Padilla, you, you
talked a lot about duplication
in your opening statement
talking about
I don't know if you have the
notes in front of you, but can
you repeat that for me again,
please?
I think what we wind up having
is um
necessity being the mother of
invention.
You know, in a lot of ways, you
know we got this problem with
let's get a task force, a group
or whatever to work on that. I
think this department could
could produce that Madam Chair
or that department whatever.
This is actually gonna bring
everything into alignment.
which we have not had in this
very, very critical area of our
communities.
found that in the early
education area, the broadband
area, the cybersecurity area, I
think we're seeing the fruits of
that of that come out. I, I hope
and I anticipate that that's
what's going to happen here.
Um, I see this almost as a
business enterprise in my office
when we have issues like this,
we have employees all over this
country and, and that's what we
do. We align resources. You see
a tremendous amount of
throughput and energy I'm sorry,
and efficiency on the use of a
dollar also.
And I think that's what we're
going to find.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. So,
I just wanted to make sure, I
mean, you mentioned a lot of
duplication in other
departments, and it sounds like
we want to make sure that we
don't have that in here since it
is in the bill on the very last
couple line talk about there's
no duplication, correct?
Yes, Madam Chair. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um.
Uh, senators, uh, panel.
How many
The Offices right now are
working housing issues at the
state, state government.
So Madam Chair, um, last year we
went through this exercise, I
personally, and I, I'm sure I
didn't find them all, but I, I
think I found something like 17
agencies working on housing, and
I asked Mr. War what if he has
any additional input on that
particular item.
Oh
Madam Chair, uh, Senator Block,
we're still mapping that out,
um, you know, we're discovering
new activities all the time. We
started with a financial
analysis we identified $19
million in housing spending in
last year's EFA budget, um, that
doesn't even get into
programmatic or individual
appropriation. So it's part of
the mapping, mapping work we
want to do right away is just
understand everything that's
happening related to housing
where there's duplication, where
there's opportunity to leverage.
things where things are working
cross purposes.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you, uh, Dan.
Um
All right, so I just wanna make
sure I understand. So 17
agencies that we know of right
now, we're still mapping.
A working housing or working
housing issues across the state.
OK, got it.
So, let's, let's go to the bill.
Let's talk about that.
So section C on page 2, line 3.
The purpose of the Office of
Housing, Planning and Production
is to reduce housing costs.
Out of those 17 agencies, how
many of them are reducing
housing costs right now. How
many are focused on that?
Uh, Madam Chair, and Senator, we
don't know. And, and the last
thing I want to be able to stand
here in front of anybody is uh
not know what we don't know, but
I can tell you that I can almost
guarantee you that there's very
few actually working on the
reduction in the cost.
Probably working on providing,
but I would like there to be a
focus, and that's why we made
that the number one item there
because the escalation in cost
is outrageous. My sons are
twins. They're 29 now, and, and
they're having a very difficult
time moving into their own
housing.
All right, thank you, sir. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
of those 17 agencies, how many
are, um,
How many are focused on or work
with increased statewide housing
availability, including housing
for low income and homeless
households.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator, I
would give you this. I'm, I'm
not being flippant, I promise,
but we don't know. We don't
know. OK. I mean, we know some,
but we don't know it all, so.
So,
and I
Madam Chair, Senator Buck, I
would, I would offer that aside
from MFA, which is not a state
agency. We have housing programs
operating, but none of them are
dedicated to lowering the cost
of housing. They subsidize
housing through lowering what
someone pays. We're talking
about trying to lower the
underlying cost of housing that
affect everyone regardless of
income. OK, thanks for that
that's unique. OK, thank you,
madam.
chair. So right now, we're,
you're telling me we're not.
You're telling me we're, we're
not doing anything that you just
said.
They were doing some of it.
We're doing everything that he
just mentioned, but what we're
what we're lacking though, Madam
Chair and senator is
is is is a complete laser beam
focus and coordination, and
that's really what you're going
to get out of this effort here.
OK, no, that's a, that's a good
answer. I, I like that cause
we're, we're gonna get to that
here in a second.
Um, from a top level, but the
devil's in the details, so to
speak, and so, Madam Chair, and
panel, I can assume then.
On items
3 through 7, we don't know, not,
and I'll read those for the
record.
Maximize resources to address
statewide housing needs.
We don't know how many of those
17 agencies of the people doing
that, and, and that's OK.
Uh, address the underlying
factors that are impacting
housing costs and limited supply
out of the 17 agencies, we don't
know how many people are doing
that.
Grow local programs and capacity
to address housing needs and
further fair housing.
of the 17 agencies, we don't
know how many are doing.
Identify state resources for
housing, 17 agencies, we don't
know how many people are doing
that.
Track housing progress through
goal setting and data.
We don't know out of the 17
agencies who's doing that.
So, I think if I understand you
correctly, is
What you're talking about, um,
Mr. Chair and senators and
panel.
You're talking about
integration.
Is that a fair assessment?
Madam Chair and senator, that,
that would be one of them, yes,
I mean, when you look at items 1
through 7, you know, we're doing
some of this. I can't tell you
what we're doing. We're not
measuring it. We're not.
Producing trend lines, etc. I
will say though that the
year-long effort on the housing
investment council that I served
on with Representative uh Dixon
and Mr. Wawa and and other and
actually industry, we had a lot
of industry included there as
well on that, on that uh
investment council. These were
actually 7 of the things that we
identified.
These were what they were and
then when we started talking
about what sort of data do we
want to be looking at, that's
what you see in the reporting
and analytic portion, OK? And
then the structure of how it
would come together is how the,
the, the um
The rest of the bill.
But
Mr. Chair, and, and panel, you
do concede.
Items C1 through C7.
17 agencies in the state working
in these issues, but
About 17, there's 17 agencies
working housing issues.
And we don't know how many of
those people are working any of
these, and that's OK if we don't
know the answer.
So how does this office
Work with
Maybe Senator Scott brought it
up, but how do you work with
Um
Organizations like
Area in Albuquerque or Sandoval
Economic Alliance or the
chambers.
Are you
Do you envision pulling data?
From what sources to pull data
from like federal sources.
Local sources, nonprofit
sources, how, how's that gonna
work, Madam Chair and Senator,
everything you just mentioned.
And I will tell you that in the
housing Investment Council, we
had the chambers involved,
including the Albuquerque
Chamber, uh, we had private um
um.
Contractors involved, we wanted
the widest breath possible to
design what you're seeing here
now. OK. All right. Thank you,
sir. Thank you, Madam Chair.
So the Office of Housing,
Planning and Production, uh,
it's, it's going to develop a
statewide strategy to build
partnerships among state
agencies, local stakeholders.
Adressing housing and
homelessness. Do, do we not do
that now?
We never done that?
We don't have any strategic
plans for housing in the state
of New Mexico.
Madam Chair, we, we, we are, we
have the framework for that. We
have some, we produced a housing
report as a result of the work
done by the the housing
investment council that I spoke
of. We do have a, we're standing
up a little bit of a housing
office here and they're they're
just doing the yeoman's work
there because they're so
understaffed and they have, so
yeah, we're, we're moving in
that direction. I'm glad you
pointed all that out.
Yeah, well, thank, thank you,
uh, sir. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Yeah, because
It should already be done and we
don't know if it's already being
That data is already being
gathered with these 17 agencies
because, or even more because we
haven't even finished mapping
them out yet.
So
That's, that's an issue here,
and I
And I don't want to take up much
time cause I know there's
another be you want to get to,
but Madam Chair,
Senators panel
I, I think you guys got to
figure out if the state has to
figure out.
Maybe it's you in the office of
governor.
Maybe you have to come up with a
plan to figure out the roles and
responsibilities of these 17
agencies and figure out what
people are doing and then come
back.
With some type of integration
plan with this office.
Because
Right now we
But what we're doing is, well,
You know, we, we think, we think
we know what's out there, but
we're not done mapping it, but
we think this is the solution to
help us out.
That's
That's, that's not working.
And um
I will support this bill if
there is a plan in here of
integration.
Of gathering all these different
housing agencies together, laser
focused, like you said, Senator.
Because right now it's not laser
focused, it's all over the map,
and we don't even know.
Where what the map is.
So
I think there's a lot more
homework to be done.
From the state
And um
Once we get our stuff organized
and integrated.
With a good plan to tell the
people.
Not gonna be having duplication
because right now in your bill.
It says here, perform
non-duplicative duties assigned
by the governor.
Or the legislature to ensure
that the state meets or exceeds
the state's housing goals.
And by the way, what are those
housing goals? What are the
numbers for those?
Madam Chair and Senator uh at
the moment, the housing hold on
it and my introduction was
42,000 dwelling units.
fast approaching 85,000 within
the next decade.
There are, uh, the reason that
we want to stand this office up
is so that the long range
planning can occur. The goals
can be set, which is called out
in the legislation, and they can
be looked at regularly. I will
tell you that, uh, Madam Chair
and Senator, I'm not a fan of
insanity.
And if we don't do something to
get this coordination and this
laser focused effort put
together in this office. We're
going to be looking at each
other in 2 or 3 years from now
wondering why we're at an 85,000
dwelling unit hole. Uh, I would
like to see, you know, the
definition of insanity is doing
the same thing over and over
again expecting a different
result. I don't operate that
way. I know you don't operate
that way, and this is one.
solid effort here to move us in
that right direction.
I appreciate that, sir. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Again though.
It, what
What is
The goal
What is the state's housing
goals? Where, where is that
written down like on a website
somewhere? What's the state's
housing goals because we know
what the hole is, the donut, as
you said.
But what is the, what's the
goal?
So Madam Chair and senator, I'll
draw you again to page 2, line 3
through 15 goals are to reduce
housing costs.
Increased statewide housing
availability, including housing
for low-income and homeless
households.
Maximize resources to address
statewide housing needs.
Address the underlying factors
that are impacting housing costs
and limited, so I want to make
sure I read it to you because
there's where the goals are,
grow local programs and capacity
to address housing needs and
further housing, fair housing.
identify state resources for
housing and track. There's our
reporting mechanism, track
housing progress through goal
setting and data.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Well, it's
On line 3, see what's the
purpose, that's the purpose of
what you just read. Now, I will
say,
Yeah, track housing progress
through goal setting. So what's
the, what's the goal?
What, what are we, tell me, tell
me what the metrics are gonna be
the objective.
Oh
Where, where is that written
down? Is the goal to say we only
want
1% of the population to be
homeless, we want the average
median household to be 400,000
we want.
The the donut hole of housing to
be only 10,000 houses.
In 5 years
What, what's, what's the goal?
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator and Mr. We, I think we
found your next employee for the
office. Yeah, yeah, uh, but
essentially, uh, you know, the
goals are to reduce that 42,000
dwelling unit hole that we talk
about what though?
That'll be established. That's
one of the strategies here is to
set those goals and monitor
them, look at them, track them
as it's laid out in the
legislation, OK.
Well, Madam Chair, uh, senators,
this
First of all, there, there's a
lot of work that needs to be
done at the state government
and, and you, and you have
agreed to that as well with
these multiple agencies. We
haven't finished mapping.
And we're putting the cart
before the horse here on this.
I would really like you guys to
And again,
Just my opinion.
recommendation really would like
to see the state.
Have some type of reorganization
to look at the total
integration.
Total integration of housing of
roles and responsibilities with
Empirical data sets.
That shows what the goals are
for New Mexico in the next 5
years because we can just come
back in like 23 years like you
said, Senator, and say, you
know, well, did we meet the
goal? Well, we don't know, uh,
keep throwing money at it, so I,
I just, I, I.
I appreciate the effort. I
appreciate your time. I
appreciate the debate and the
discussion on this, but um
This state is nowhere near ready
to set up.
A housing and planning
production.
With various organizations doing
the same thing across the state
and there's some places that we
don't even know what they're.
So, um
Um, Madam Chair, I, I yield.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair. We appreciate the
senator's comments.
Thank you. Are there other
questions from committee
members?
