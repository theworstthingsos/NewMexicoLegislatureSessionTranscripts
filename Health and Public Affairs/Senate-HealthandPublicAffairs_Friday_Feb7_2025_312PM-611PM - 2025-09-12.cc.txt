Senator.
Charlie.
Senator Gallegos.
In her nova
And our Pinto
And Scott.
Center Serio Lopez.
Here
Hickey, Senator Lopez here.
OK, we have a corn present.
Um, what I wanted to mention,
um, to announce one of our first
announcements is that we will
not be hearing Senate Bill 14
tonight.
So if you are here for Senate
Bill 14, we will not be hearing
that bill.
Um, it was scheduled previously,
but
Um, the committee, I've asked
for any amendments or committee
substitutes to be given to the
committee 24 hours, and we
received it this morning, so.
The bill will be heard on
Monday.
So Senate Bill 14, we will not
hear it today.
Um
And as I ask as a courtesy.
My, my life history, um, I was
uh hospitalized, double
pneumonia, a whole list. I'm
still on antibiotics.
So I have, I'm still
immunocompromised, so I do ask
for consideration.
If you would consider wearing a
mask.
It just, and as the crowd starts
to go around the where the
roundhouse, that's, that's
already going around too.
But it's just a consideration.
Thank you.
Um, where we left off on
Wednesday.
Um, we'd already gone through a
discussion on the bill, we
adopted an amendment.
We already did public comments.
Um, from both the audience and
online.
And where we were proceeding
with for now is to go through.
Uh, questions or comments uh
from committee members and
Senator Sadil Lopez, is there
anything you wanted to add?
Um, oh, and I wanted to do one
more thing.
You have here as a handout.
There's um
A letter from
New Mexico Medical Board.
Uh, committee members will also
have
A handout from
Uh, telehealth policy to
transform healthcare.
Uh, there's a letter, um,
To our attention.
There's also some information.
Um, from the Center for
Connected Health Policy.
And this is um a good read and
it's the cost state license.
Continuum
So I wanted, this is just
information.
Um, for you to peruse through as
you're listening to questions
or.
And answers from the sponsor.
So, um, with that,
Oops.
We'll go to questions or
comments from, oh, Senator, if
you wish to say a few words
before we go to questions.
Maybe it it may just come out in
committee. I did have some
concerns about um some of the
statements here, um, because the
interest here is an independent
saying that it also it allows
for a physician to consult.
I know that and and that's fine,
we're looking the what this bill
does is it changes the
regulations that they passed to
allow for a independent.
Second opinion. And, and I just
want to make that clear for the
committee that that's, that's
what we're seeking. This isn't
allowing doctors from across
borders to provide anything but
a.
Thank you, Senator.
And we'll go to questions or
comments from committee.
Senator Black
Thank you, Madam Chair, um, and,
uh, I wanna, I wanna thank, um,
Senator Antoinette Sidil Lopez.
Um, because you and I have
talked about this privately and
um.
I just want to say you, you have
an amazing heart and uh you care
for so many people in New Mexico
and I very much appreciate you,
um, doing this bill.
Uh, I just wanna ask you just a
few questions here because I
have seen a little bit of
Uh, difference between some of
the language, well sort of
between what Senator Duha had on
the bill and what you had, and
I'll get to that in a second in
SB 14.
But I want to ask you to
Really to clarify.
Well, let me ask you this.
So some of these health care or
all of these healthcare, uh,
providers that you mentioned uh
in your bill.
Do we do anything similar to the
concept that you have here with
other people that have licenses
in other states that provide
services in New Mexico.
Well, interesting, um, that you
would ask that because, um,
during COVID, there were a lot
of a lot of emergency measures
taken, um, but a lot of them
were were taken away, um, even
in the legal profession, but a
lot of these problems would be
addressed if we had compacts.
If we had uh licensure compacts
we wouldn't, um.
As you know we're gonna be
looking at licensure compacts
again this year.
Uh, Linda Trujillo, I think of
them.
Um, so,
yes, and even legal um.
You know, for getting a second
opinion, you can get it.
Through telehealth from a legal
uh from a law firm in another
state, they just can't practice
it, but you could call by
sending your documents and have
a.
Um
A video, so that would be
something with these
professions, I believe not. I,
I'm not sure though.
Uh, thank you, Senator. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Yeah, cause I,
I don't, I don't know if we're
treating.
Um, all the professional
licensed.
Professions
Equally, when we look at this
bill, if it opens the door.
Uh, senator to other other
licenses from other states. The
point you made is, is a really
good one, on the compact because
Military families want those as
a, as a retired military
officer, I, I know that.
With the moving around of the of
the dependents and their
licenses, it's not recognized in
different states and um I, I
hope that's something we can fix
here.
I appreciate you bringing that
up.
On page 3.
It says, um, originating site
needs a place where the patient
may receive healthcare via
telehealth.
Uh, and you have all these,
what, what wouldn't qualify?
As an originating site.
I'm sorry, page 3. Yes, ma'am,
um, section C on line 8,
hopefully have the updated bill.
Um, just the originating site
heading.
Oh, wouldn't qualify on there.
Well, it's, it's it, or what
would not OK.
I hadn't thought about what
wouldn't we were trying to be
kind of comprehensive.
Like the pre the patient's
residence. Well, I know how you
are. We've worked together on
trying to capture everything.
I'm just, I'm just curious
to be comprehensive, so to be
honest, I can't think of
something that wouldn't that's
something you can just think
about later if we this thing
keeps going we could amend that
because I want to make sure it
does capture.
Um, those, everything, yes,
ma'am. Thank you, Madam Chair
point well taken. Thank you,
thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. If I could just go
back to section B.
Healthcare provider line 3.
It says health care provider
means a person licensed,
certified, or registered to
provide health care to patients
in New Mexico.
This is, this is, I think, the
concern that some may have is if
I am doing telehealth.
And I'm getting a second opinion
from a.
dermatologists in Kentucky.
And that dermatologist is not um
licensed because I currently
going through skin cancer as
well.
What, what risk does that
Doctor, that dermatologist carry
and what risk does the patient
here carry with this bill doing
telehealth.
Through a non-licensed.
Provider in New Mexico.
You, um, normally get a second
opinion because.
You are
Uh
Concerned about the treatment
you're getting.
And you just want to assure
yourself getting is exactly what
should be done. I know we did
that for my mother-in-law, we
went to a different cancer
center, and we got a second
opinion and uh getting
cheap, flus are about it.
Or you get a second opinion
because you're hoping that maybe
like, like uh, um, my
constituent, you're hoping to
transfer there.
Uh, because it's such an
extraordinary place and in of
the emails I've gotten about
this, uh, most of these.
The individuals who wanted an
independent second opinion who
emailed me were of the latter
type they were hoping against
hope because they got a bad
diagnosis here to see if there
was some specialized treatment
in another, in another
jurisdiction. It turns out that
some won't even take out of
state uh patients unless they
have a video. That's the problem
with UCLA's policy. They want a
video conference. They don't
want you going all the way all
the way over there.
Um
And to get treatment if they're
not gonna accept you.
So they want to see your
documents that your medical
records and they want to have a
video consultation with you, and
then they'll tell you whether
they think it's worth it for you
to travel there.
So those are the, those are the
two kinds that uh I'm most
familiar with. Um, I'm gonna, I
want to change doctors,
possibly, or I want to.
feel better.
the treatment I'm getting now.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Just, just, uh, a
few more questions and, and just
short answers so we can uh move
on to this, but that, that
brings up a great point.
Because I would imagine, um,
And again, just in all
transparency when I was
diagnosed with PTSD coming back
from Afghanistan, I had to do a
video.
Uh, teleconference over with
another VA counselor somewhere
else, and does this bill
Just remind me cause I haven't
read it for a few days. Is this
bill?
Uh, require New Mexican, it's
not citizens though, it's
residents, and I wanna just get
your thought on that. Does this
bill require New Mexico or New
Mexicans who have a video
health, um,
teleconference with the provider
or can you do it over the phone?
Because I would argue that you,
you have to do it over over
video, so the, the dock, the
provider, the PA or the nurse
practitioner or the nurse can,
can lay eyes on you.
The definition of telehealth.
is
Means on page 4, telehealth for
purposes of this act means the
use of electronic information,
imaging and communication
technologies including
interactive audio video.
Data communications as well as
store and forward technologies
to provide and support
healthcare delivery diagnosis
consultation, treatment,
transfer of medical data and
education. I will say that this
is an aside and not something
necessarily that this.
Bill deals with, but um there's
an issue with the rules that
were passed by the medical board
in that they don't permits
consultations, uh, under their
telehealth rules where I believe
that this statute is very clear
that uh I think straight forward
technologies are a synchronous,
you know what a synchron did I?
OK, sorry. I'm going off on a
tent, that's OK. Uh, thank you,
thank you, Madam Chair, because
the reason I asked that is
interactive audio.
Interactive audio is not getting
the eyes on, on the patient. So
I, I, I think
Um, that's, that's an area of
concern, um for, for me, and I
don't know about you or the
healthcare providers out there,
that's something I wanna.
Make sure that's addressed. Um,
and then real quick on page 5,
Senator, line one, the word
citizens is crossed out in
residence.
What, what is the difference
between that residence is the
New Mexico residency, I'm good,
thank you. Thank you, uh,
Senator. Thank you, madam.
Uh, chair
Um
One of the other thing here, I
think that.
Would, would make some of these
providers nervous is what is the
legal liabilities of treating
someone.
Getting care when they don't
have, they're not licensed in
the state of New Mexico. How
does that open up the aperture?
The legal liability for
Maybe, maybe both parties.
If you get a second opinion and
you think that somehow the
second opinion affected your
treatment, um, you would have to
sue that person in in the state
where they are because of our of
venue statutes and jurisdiction
statutes usually, um, so you'd
have to sue like if you got the
Kentucky consultation, you'd
have to sue them in Kentucky.
for a lawyer,
usually don't generate a
lawsuits, it's Indians just, you
know, like I said.
If the person changed and moved
to Kentucky for the liability
for any malpractice would be in
Kentucky with if the treatment
plan perhaps was influenced uh
like what what New Mexico, with
the regulations that they passed
do is they do allow a doctor to
call.
And, and get um a consultation
which I would argue is not
necessarily a second, so if they
get the consultation and.
It, it's the doctor who
performed the treatment that
would be liable if he relied on
a he or she relied on a second
consultation they might want to
bring that person into the
lawsuit and say I, I made this
mistake, but I made the mistake
relying on bringing them in.
But normally you see the doctor
who did whatever they did,
uh, thank you, Senator. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Um, in regards
to uh the healthcare, the
billing.
Uh, would this be billed to New
Mexico or would it be built out
of New Mexico and, and who pays
for that uh expense of the
telehealth with the
Equipment and maintaining that
equipment.
this, um.
This does not deal with.
Uh
Is it reasonable to assume it's
normal healthcare billing like
we have. Um, even if you cross
the state lines, and that
happens now, right now, I, I was
uh.
My medical insurance uh allowed
me to cross state lines because
they did my treatment.
Uh, didn't exist here so yeah
thank you, sir. And lastly, but
this bill doesn't address
insurance. This has, this is
very separate. I understand.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you
very much. And lastly, um,
I'm sorry. I need to look at the
chair and remind myself it's
been very gracious not saying.
Uh, lastly here,
There's no appropriation for
this bill. I'm not sure what the
um
Uh, Madam Chair, what, what the
appropriation for this bill
would be.
Um
How, how we would figure that
out and that's, and that's OK,
cause this is kind of one of
those sunk costs I kind of, I, I
think of when I think of um.
patient sitting at home, uh, on
a laptop or a phone.
Uh, doing, doing the uh
consultation.
But
I think one of the things
That
Makes me a little bit nervous
is, do you, do you see in your,
in your just opinion.
With the
With the amount of doctors and
healthcare providers that have
left New Mexico.
If this became law.
Do you think other professional
healthcare providers would leave
New Mexico because then they
don't have to and find licensing
somewhere else that's cheaper,
but they could still practice,
madam chair, is limited. It
doesn't allow for a continuing
relationship with that
physician.
It's just, it's a very narrow
exception and um you, the loss
they they predict would be a
loss of fees.
The licensing fees to the state
is minimal.
And, and, um
I
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. I, I really wanna,
you know, I was very concerned
with the hospital said here that
the doctors, uh, the
pediatrician, I think the other
general physician or whatever he
was, um.
That's the part that really
worries me with this bill and
So you're telling me now when
you said second opinion only, no
New Mexican right now can.
Do telehealth with on a
consistent basis where they're
checking in once a quarter on.
That's correct, that's correct,
Madam Chair, that's not
permitted by the regulations
that were passed by the.
OK, Senator Cedillo, uh, Lopez,
I want to thank you for um
Put this together
I'm, I'm a little on the fence.
Because I know you and I just, I
just love you to death, and I
know how much you care about
this. It's very important. I
think there's a lot of
liabilities and some gaps that
maybe could be tightened up in
this, um, Madam, Madam Chair,
and I, I hope you can accept
this friendly amendment. Madam
Chair, I would like to make an
amendment to the bill, um.
Possible.
Um
How long was an amendment is it?
It's a short one, Madam Chair,
and I think it would be friendly
to the senator. OK. The reason
why I ask is
I have asked if we do an
extensive amendment that it'd
be.
Written by large counsel to deal
with, but if it's short.
Go ahead, please. Thank you,
Madam Chair. On page 4 line 11.
My amendment would be.
To strike the words interactive
audio.
And that would be it. So the
sentence would read.
Starting from
telehealth means the use of
electronic information, imaging
and communication technologies,
including video.
Data communications as well as
storage and for technologies to
provide and support healthcare
delivery, diagnosis,
consultation, treatment,
transfer of medical data, and
education.
You're striking, if I may also
add.
Again, there's still not a
second, but um.
You're striking including in if
you're striking on.
Page 4, line 11 interactive
audio.
Maybe we should also strike the
comma.
Uh
Great catch, Madam Chair.
OK
I would agree with that
completely. I've been brushing
up on my English.
But that's just because it's
thank you, Madam Chair. I
quickly consulted with the
medical board, and they said
that would be a problem for the
for the in remember they're
defending intrastate.
Um,
Access to care and so there are
many people in the state that
don't have um.
Zoom technology or whatever, so
they have to uh get it.
Especially from the rural
community with audio.
And so I consulted with them and
because.
They are the experts I uh.
Have to decline.
Madam Chair,
Senator, um, I, I would be
willing to with withdraw the
amendment.
Understanding
My county, uh, with the 14
tribes and pueblos and the rural
areas. I, I totally understand
that.
Um, I can draw that amendment.
Thank thank you Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. Madam Chair,
I yield.
OK, thank you.
Any other questions, Senator
Scott?
Mm
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Mm
After Senator.
Is the consultation or the
second opinion have to be
recommended by the attending
physician.
Or does
was an individual just.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um.
That's
That's why.
This big can, uh, a, a physician
can refer or get or consult with
another doctor.
Um
A lot of people get an
independent second opinion.
When my mother-in-law was
diagnosed with cancer, with
stomach cancer.
I knew that we had excellent
cancer centers here.
And so
Without consulting.
She came and we got a 2nd
opinion here.
Um, they said she's getting to
be fine.
That's what I'm talking about,
we didn't ask for and that's
what.
I think that's give the patient
the option to do that and not to
rely.
You know,
Honestly, if that had happened
with my mother-in-law that the
cancer center had said we have
this amazing new treatment for
stomach cancer, and we'd like to
invite her to be a patient, we
would have done that, and that's
what this is about is allowing
New Mexicans through video with
all of these specialized um
centers or um you know, to
reassure themselves that they're
getting the best treatment here
in New Mexico or perhaps to
change. OK.
Oh.
Madam Chair, this piece of
legislation does not appear to
require.
A license to practice medicine
in New Mexico.
Um, that's correct. It does
require them to be licensed.
Somewhere uh where they are, um.
Certified or registered um.
Yeah, somewhere.
And
Madam Chair and Senator, could
you
Describe for me the process.
Of acquiring a license to
practice.
In New Mexico, is that onerous
is, is that a hard thing to do
to get a license of full blown
license to to practice in New
Mexico is a vetting process by
the the medical board, they
would be in a better position to
tell you, but my understanding
is that it's a long process,
that is why so many people are
pushing us to adopt the compact.
So that the process of getting
new physicians from other.
Um, but this is a very, very
narrow exception.
It's just reversing the rules
that they.
Created pursuant to this
legislation to allow in one
circumstance.
An independent second evaluation
to be made by video. And that
would satisfy last last week or
last time, whenever it was.
I gave you uh a website from
UCLA um that excludes New
Mexicans from being seen by them
at all.
And it is because they require.
A video before you go out and
see them, they want to.
You know, they have all these
specialties, um, and so if you
want specialties.
They want to see your records
and they want to consult with
you. They don't want you to go
unless they decide to to and
when I said, well, there's this
interactive or there's this.
Process telehealth lies with the
regulations that the medical
board practices, why doesn't
UCLA get that?
Because it's physician by
physician.
And UCLA has
Thousands of doctors. They
cannot be getting an uh a
telehealth, and I forgot what
the, well, I guess it's in the.
Or whatever the fee is.
Um
The UCLA said they just can't be
bothered with it. It's, it's
expensive and time consuming and
they're not gonna have each of
their 1000 doctors try to get.
I mean, it might work if UCLA
could just get a telehealth.
Licensed from um the medical
board, but that's not how the
medical board works. It's
physician by physician. So
that's why we're on the list of
States
That will not be seen by UCLA.
Through telehealth.
You have to travel over there uh
the dilemma is for so many of
their specialties, they, they
don't want you to go there
unless you have a telehealth,
it's.
I'm trying to deal with that.
As I told you, it came up
because one individual pointed
it out, but other individuals
have told me they have the
advocacy group I was surprised
that we got a letter by.
This organization.
Um
This organization called the.
What is it, the telehealth.
Uh, where you, you got that
letter today?
That was they just monitoring
this and we're an outlier.
We, New Mexico is an outlier.
And I'm trying to reverse the
regulations that were passed by
the board that um make us an
outlier.
You know, all, all that said,
Madam Chair and Senator, would,
would you agree with me that
even
A very minimal consultation
would be in fact practicing
medicine in New Mexico.
Well, my understanding um.
And maybe but um a lot of these
cases, medical malpractice cases
turn on whether a
Adopt a physician patient
relationship.
Um, and so there is a definition
of practicing medicine in the
regulations passed by the
medical board, um, but that's
not necessarily binding on the
courts when they're determining
that issue for malpractice. So
the answer to your question is
actually a little complex, um.
But giving a second opinion.
I would say if, if I were a
judge and I'm just predicting
what a judge might do, I would
say yes, that creates a
physician of of.
physician patient relationship.
You're evaluating to me that's
the heart of a physician
relationship.
Well, Madam Chair and senator
with that answer.
It seems like
This piece of legislation.
That you are advocating.
What, would seem to be contrary
to that statement because
We're not requiring a license to
practice medicine in New Mexico.
For a very limited purpose. The
second opinion. I'm not, I'm not
saying.
They, they, you can do this and
establish an ongoing patient
relationship. All I'm saying is
for that limited, perhaps
judiciary might want to uh.
play with the definition more
more clear definition of of
independent second opinion. I, I
think it's pretty clear and
everybody knows what a second
opinion is why
uh individuals get a second
opinion?
Um, but it's, I'm not, we're not
opening the doors to.
Doctors practicing here through
video health. All we're doing is
allowing.
And a physician in another state
to give a second opinion.
They cannot, they cannot uh
continue under this bill, all
they can do is give their second
opinion written or orally
however they give it, and then
it's over.
And the patient has to decide. I
like the second opinion, I'm
going to travel to that state
and get treatment or the patient
says,
They, there's nothing that can
be done.
That those are the results of a
second opinion.
Madam Chair and senator, this
would be
This would involve
Uh, transfer of medical records,
review of those records by
Whoever they were sent to,
perhaps multiple.
Uh
Um
Calls or
Or or telephone.
Absolutely, absolutely, and
patients have a right to send
their records to whoever they
like.
They cannot be withheld by a New
Mexico physician.
So, Madam Chair and senator, in
fact, this could be a fairly
extensive process.
Before the second opinion.
Was
Resolved, I guess.
I think depending on the I
depending on the disease or the
medical condition.
Perhaps, um, it took for the
second opinion for stomach
cancer from my mother-in-law.
Required the transfer of her
medical records, they did a
couple more tests when she came
here. It took her blood
pressure.
And they talked to her that way.
Thank you, Senator, for your
answers. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Scott. Any
other questions?
I'm sorry, Senator Gallegos
apologize, I stepped out for a
phone call with
OSI, but um I'm chair and
center. I do have a few
questions and
It's come up a couple of times.
Um, I wanted to go back to Yale
you UCLA video that you talked
about, um.
Is that specific to them, or
just for instance, cotton white.
Out of Houston
Would they have similar
requirements that you have to go
to.
A video and all the paperwork to
be just for if you're talking
about just a second opinion.
Why would you need that much
detail for just a second page.
And, and would anyone else
required other than
UCLA records.
Well, you're talking about and
I'm gonna apologize. I came in
late, you're talking about a
video from just UCLA.
And
Oh, it's because UCLA prefers to
many, many people apply to go to
UCLA and be seen by UCLA and
some of their departments, I
don't know about all of them,
but a few of their department
won't even talk to you, we'll
make an appointment. They ask
you to make a video appointment.
And we're of list on a list of
people they won't deal with
because of the regulations that
were passed by the medical
board.
Well,
thank you.
Thank you for that, but I guess
my question was, is it just
UCLA? Have you looked anywhere
else? I thought it was cotton
white out of Houston.
My wife's got cancer, they're
very good at what they do.
Would they require for a second
opinion for me to jump through
the hoops at UC yelled at UCLA
does.
I don't know about that. I do
know about um.
Johns Hopkins.
Permits it, said, says, you
know, you can send your records
and I don't think it's required
by, but I, I have not done a
survey of different.
Hospitals, I think it's hospital
by I mean uh.
Medical center by medical
center.
Doctor by doctor.
And and and and center, I, I can
do accounts so I know this bill
will go on, but in the next page
you might look into that because
I think you're gonna find areas
that are welcome.
The opportunity to work with
people that may be different
from UCLA, um.
And
Chair and and center uh going
back to the second opinion only.
Discussion
On your bill, page 5.
Line 7
And 8
Uh, to me, the way I read that.
This provided second opinions
and consultations.
For perspective treatment.
patients in New Mexico. If
you're doing just
Second opinions, wouldn't you
cross the rest of that line out
an amendment? Um.
Just using your words
just second opinion.
Too much stuff here, but I'm not
looking at the bill. The idea I
as I recall when we were
drafting it, you want the
perspective you would want that
language in in case um.
Let's say you
You had this cluster of
symptoms. UCLA was a specialty,
and you were gonna change and
you were gonna go there, they
would need to to further view.
OK, well thank you for that,
Madam Chair and Senator, then I
guess instead of just saying the
word just.
Second opinions
Because I think in some of the
dialogue we've had, I see. Thank
you. I have the language. OK,
and consultations for thing, in
other words, I'm consulting them
so that I can possibly go to
them.
Right.
But in the intent of the bill
that we're explained to is just
for second opinions, period.
That's not the way it reads,
OK, uh so a second opinion is
you you you'd normally get a
second opinion for two reasons,
to assure is good, or the second
reason is to change physicians.
And that consultation for
prospective treatment is I wanna
go to UCLA if they'll have me.
So I'm getting a consultation
for prospective treatment.
So that's the 2nd reason you get
a a consultation. OK, well, and
I guess I've got a difference in
just the proposed bill, so I'll
go on Madam Chair, Senator, um.
And just, and it may be and I'm
gonna apologize if.
Senator Scott asked these
questions uh when I was out of
the room is a vetting of license
or license in this bill.
Uh, how hard is betting?
Uh, for licensed or
non-licensed.
Uh, providers, is that something
through the board or is that
something?
How's that handled for
physicians who practice in New
Mexico and with a telehealth
regulations that they adopted in
NMAC, um, they vet anybody who
wants to provide.
Uh, telehealth.
They asked them to pay a fee.
Get a telehealth.
I don't know what they do
exactly. I'm sure they do
background checks. I'm sure they
do whether they have
malpractice.
Aces in the past I'm. And, and
that.
carries me on to the other
question which is a non-issue
now because I was trying to
figure out if it's just in state
or out of state but in page one
line 23, it talks about out of
state health care providers, and
I just, uh, in, in my
Fears
is we're going to be doing
things that um
We're gonna be harming
Are people from
Some of that's not vetted or or
invested with us, so, uh, as it
stands, um.
I'll be voting no, but it's just
one of those things that I think
as you go forward, if there's
any of the questions, even the
public had earlier, uh, that you
could look at.
Because I think that we just
need to do what's best for New
Mexicans not.
Uh
I'm not gonna even throw out the
CLA not in Houston,
let's say it that way. I think
we need to do what's best for
New Mexicans, not other
entities. With that, I thank
you. Madam Chair.
Uh, thank you very much,
Senator.
Um, other questions? Yes,
Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Entering
access.
Um, I do have a couple of
questions about, sorry, madam
chairs the mic on because I, I,
I can't, I can't hear. I'm, I'm
sick, so I don't wanna.
Is the mic on? I, I can't hear.
Can you hear me now? OK, there
we go.
Um
I'm thinking about folks who
might not have insurance that
would cover.
Out of state.
So, um,
This is a rhetorical question,
but who can afford to pay for
it.
The, the thing is, is who can
afford to travel, it saves a lot
of travel costs. It also helps
people who are too frail.
Um
Some medical insurances, but
this bill is not.
Is not an insurance bill.
But some medical insurers may
choose to cover it because it'll
be a lot cheaper than sending
them there.
Um, for a second opinion, so I'm
just guessing I'm not, I'm just.
Thinking about the insurance
industry, they'd say, oh, we
could lie you over there or we
could have pay for a second
opinion.
With a video.
I'm pretty sure they pay for the
video, even, you know, might
make them easier, make it for
more second opinions if they
were video.
OK.
Um, I, I still think though.
And, and maybe I just need more
clarity around this, um.
If if insurance doesn't cover a
medical provider out of state.
Then that cost is incurred
directly by the patient.
That's true now.
That's true now.
Right, right, right.
Um
And then I'm curious about HIPAA
standards. I know it's a
federal, but does New Mexico
have more stringent HIPAA
standards than other states.
It doesn't, the HIPAA standards
are uniform for all of the
states. OK.
Um
And then, uh, Madam Chair,
Senator Sadi Lopez, how do we
ensure cultural competency
across state lines.
cultural competency within state
lines, but, uh.
Um, we can't, but what what this
is is remember this is a
patient's choice, the patient,
for example, I'm trying the
patient may find that there's a
culturally a a a more culturally
competent physician in here.
Um, so they might want to get a
2nd from that position in
Arizona determined that they're
more culturally competent and
then but you can't insure it.
Train themselves and.
Madam Chair, Senator, who pro
who will provide oversight and
moderate like quality of ethics.
Um, to out of state providers.
The patients will have to deal
with a second opinion, how they
see fit. This is a patient
choice thing.
They will have to look at the
second opinion and say, I'm
going to change my position to
this other physician or I'm
gonna stay with my physician.
Because either I can't afford it
or because.
Um, I feel better about what
they're doing because I had my
second the the way this bill is
written, it's, it's up to it,
um, now, um.
Gross problem.
Uh, they, the patient could file
a complaint. OK.
Um
Maybe going a little bit deeper,
who provides oversight on
quality of ethics right now.
Quality of quality of like
ethics or ethics providers I
wasn't sure what you said.
Quality of ethics, the medical
board, um, I think deals with
the New Mexico Medical Board
deals with ethics problems. OK.
And um, Madam Chair, Senator Sio
Lopez.
Would our medical board have
oversight of any of the
providers in any way, shape or
form that patients, um,
are seeking second opinions of.
No, I, I think if only if they
had a license, um, but.
This is to allow, I mean, if
they had a license, they
wouldn't even beexico. This is
to allow patient choice to go to
someone who um.
You know, there are some states
that have really incredible
specialties I know for a long
time people went to Colorado.
This would allow somebody like
that to have a video
consultation with that person in
Colorado before they decided to
go there.
Um, and then Madame Senator, I
just have one more question and
that's a little bit of a
hypothetical, so stick with me
here. Um, I reached out to a
medical provider in my district
and.
Talk to this through.
Um, one of the concerns that
they brought up for me was um.
I get
An original diagnosis for an
in-state provider.
Then I go get a second opinion.
And
Maybe it just reaffirm that
original, right?
Um
Have we created liability for
that original provider.
Because they diagnosis was
challenged.
Um
There
People are sued by their.
Uh, for their treatment.
Modalities, whatever it is they
did.
So how would it open up
liability?
Actually, OK, maybe this is what
they're thinking of, but this
is, it's not this bill, OK?
If I uh don't like the treatment
I'm getting, I might get a
second, and that happens, uh,
that happens now you normally
get a second if you're gonna
sue.
I guess, oh, maybe that's why
there's so OK, I'm sorry. Um.
Normally if you sue, you get a
specialist in that area to give
you a second opinion.
And actually I hadn't even
thought about that.
Perhaps this would allow them to
get a second opinion video
outside. Oh, that's all of my
questions, Madam Chair, Senator,
thank you.
Thank you very much, Senator
Charlie. Any other questions?
Senator Nava.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator C Lopez for
bringing the bill forward.
I, uh, to have a few questions.
Um, I did consult with some
folks in my district as well,
um, and
I'm sort of coming off Madam
Chair out of the angle that
Senator Charlie was, was asking
as well.
Um, I'm a little concerned about
vulnerability and risk,
accountability.
And, uh, Madam Charison or Cio
Lopez, I know that you said that
this is limited to a second
opinion, right?
Um, and I understand the concept
of a second opinion, um.
Because I had to undergo brain
surgery 3 years ago.
And Madam Chair, when they ask
you.
I, you know, why you didn't get
a second opinion of or anything
um as such.
Madam Chair, I don't necessarily
think that every single
constituent has the ability to
to have a second opinion for a
million reasons, um.
So it makes me think Madam Chair
just.
Question, what's the percentage
of folks that are actually going
to benefit from this.
Um, and Madam Chair,
additionally,
I know that it's a, it's a
second opinion, and we don't
believe that medical
professionals in New Mexico will
be impacted.
But it concerns me because if
the patient essentially chooses
to continue with that second
opinion instead of someone in
New Mexico, and they will leave.
Um
Madam Chair
Not everyone in New Mexico has
the ability to do that.
So I um.
Concerned about the language,
um.
And I am concerned about who it
would apply to, who would
actually benefit from this, um.
And I received concern from the
district as well. So I think
just further clarity would be
incredibly important to
understand
How we would be impacted, who
would legitimately benefit? What
percentage of our communities,
Madam Chair, um, and Senator,
um, and
As we continue moving forward, I
think clarity is extremely
important and also holding
ourselves accountable to our
medical professionals in the
state, and we clearly know we
have a problem, um.
But I, I'm concerned about the
factors mentioned. Thank you,
ma'am.
Um, Madam Chair, I too am very
concerned about that.
Those are questions of
insurance, 5 of the people in
the state of New Mexico are
covered by Medicaid.
Um, that's why this any other
healthcare provision
professional who's received a
Medicaid provider identification
number from the healthcare
authority is there for that very
reason, because half of our um.
This bill cannot address.
I believe it'll be cheaper for
insurance companies to have this
bill in place. I believe it'll
be better for New Mexicans and
it'll enhance the quality of.
Doctors
Um, if they can potentially
have.
Uh, a second, you know, if.
The quality of care for our
patients, if they can get a
second opinion, as I mentioned
and I understand we're in a very
privileged position to pay for
my mother-in-law's second
opinion when she got cancer, uh,
my mother-in-law all her life
was not on everything.
But when there is a life
threatening disease.
You do everything you can.
Or your loved one.
And this is allowing a
potential.
Opportunity for someone. I don't
know how I have passed
legislation that first year and
I was very grateful.
If 46 people benefit from this
bill?
That is
Madam Chair, uh, Senator, thank
you for that. Um, and I
certainly understand
life-threatening positions and
positions.
after having a brain tumor.
Um, Madam Chair, but again,
I don't know that every single
New Mexican and every single
person in our districts has the
ability to do this. And I am
concerned about
Not having the data to back this
up.
Madam Chair, I totally agree
that um we are a person, we have
a a population with this state
where many of them couldn't
afford to pay for them
themselves, I think having this.
Bill in place will make
insurance companies and Medicaid
providers.
Rethink their rules.
This doesn't deal with that.
This this first you have to
right now, it's a closed door
for them, opens the door, opens
the possibility for Medicaid to
cover it, opens the possibility
for insurance companies to cover
it.
But it opens the door and it's
a.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator.
Thank you. Any other questions?
And for a second time, um,
Senator Gallegos, you want, you
want to go first or you want the
senator Black to go first before
you.
Oh, I saw yours first, but OK.
Senator
was the nicest thing, Madam
Chair, Senator Gallegos has ever
done for me. Um,
Madam Chair, Senator Cia Lopez,
maybe I can kind of help a
little bit, put some of the
concerns that uh the valid
concerns in my opinion, Senator,
Senator Charlie and
Scott and center Gallegos have
on this.
I don't know if this has become
lie yet, but there was a
Wisconsin congressman.
um
Who wrote a bill on telehealth,
a Republican. Are you familiar
with that?
Yes, madam Chair, I am.
Can you tell us a little bit
about that, uh, how it relates
to what you're talking about
here.
Well, um, as I understand it,
and I, I probably should say I'm
just familiar with it. I
wouldn't say I'm I'm an expert,
but the Republican bill at the
federal level is to try to deal
with, um, expansion.
Actually, probably made like
maybe like this organization,
uh, to try to help make video
um.
Consultations neutral.
Um, to, um, and that's what, um.
What that bill is trying to do.
My bill does that too in a very
narrow space for second
opinions, um, that I understand
his bill is broader.
Thank you, Southerner. I just
wanted to bring that forward for
everyone's education if they
haven't heard of that bill,
because I think it's a
It's a great bill, um.
One of the things you said.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair. One
of the things that you said that
really hit home to me was
Compacts between states.
And that's to me, that's
something that we really need on
the medical side because of the
lack of access and people
leaving New Mexico.
It's
It's also what Senator Nova said
is I don't know if this captures
everybody, and I don't know what
the right answer is because
people will be doing
Telehealth, quite frankly, on
the tribes and pueblos and rural
areas, you know what they're
gonna do at libraries.
And I, I kind of worry about
that as well. Um,
But
I, I, I love this concept. I
don't think it covers everywhere
it should, but the one thing I
it does for me.
It does improve access.
And I, I like that, but it does
treat different licenses
differently.
Um, across the state and, and
that's where I'm having a hard
time because we're treating.
Granted very narrow, like you
said, we're, we're treating.
These people completely
different than this wide
spectrum of other people who
have these licenses in New
Mexico.
And
That's something I just can't
get my arms around, but I'd like
to just get your opinion.
When it comes to our tribes and
pueblos.
How we would, to me, we got to
build a better infrastructure of
fiber and Starlink and um kind
of activity.
And we don't have that, and I'm
not sure that I think we're
gonna be leaving a lot of
people.
Out of your idea, which is a
great idea.
Um
How do we, how do we fix that
big gap in your opinion. Thank
you.
Madam Chair, that gap is a huge
gap, I totally agree with you,
um, I can be libraries, it's
that gap exists.
Um, and this bill doesn't fill
that gap.
Um, it just allows them the
possibility.
Um
And as I believe his telehealth,
if the federal government like
the Congress, the congressman
who passed, uh, who's trying to
uh work on that telehealth bill,
that's gonna open more doors,
um, and we will even be more of
an outlier in, in how we uh.
I mean, it's amazing to me that
we're the only state um that
UCLA will not treat, um, and
honestly when I call them I
think they just thought we were
put on state.
Behind the times, you know,
whatever out of date, um, but,
um, I'm sorry, I, I just, I just
want to ask one question. I, um,
because I want to let Senator
Gallegosco. He was kind enough
for once to let me go first, um.
The compact piece here.
Why didn't you think about him,
chair, I'm sorry. Why didn't you
write a bill?
Instead, to me, step one would
mean the compact, the agreements
between the states to allow
Healthcare professionals.
Into New Mexico and vice versa.
Why why aren't we doing that
first, Madam Chair, Madame Chair
knows very well we have been
trying to get compacts in this
state for.
For 3 years, um, and, uh.
Uh
I made a joke, but it wasn't
taken very well, uh, when I made
the joke that I thought it was
just protection.
I don't know.
And I made the joke about
protectionist attorneys because
the argument and I, I don't
know, maybe it hit you home, the
argument is for in Mexico
lawyers, but it was just a joke,
just a joke, and everybody, it's
just a joke, but uh. Thank you,
Senator. I, I, I think the,
thank you, Madam Chair, I think
the time is ripe where we could
definitely get bipartisan
support.
Or some type of medical compact
between states, in my opinion,
that I would be supporting 100%
because that closes the gap, in
my opinion on the, on the
liability, then we have to work
on the piece that Senator Nava
and Senator Charlie were talking
about, I think that would be
step 2. I would love to help and
we need this exactly have a
chip.
Or that
If we get the compact this year.
I made for.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair. My, my, I, I would
definitely work with anybody on
a compact.
To take care of step one, and
then obviously the
infrastructure to take care of
step 2, but the part of treating
different licenses differently
for me, that's, that's where I'm
I'm lost and I have some of the
concerns about leaving some
people behind because
We're we're not at step 1, step
2 yet.
And um I I would love to work
with you on that because I think
you're probably the best person
you are Senator Hickey, uh, to
work on medical compacts around
the state or or uh
representative Jones on the
House side. Um, I'm gonna be
voting probably no on this, but
I really love your idea and I, I
just think.
If we had a couple other things
in place.
And you're, you're, you're hero
anyway, you'd be a bigger
superhero.
Madam Chair, um, I appreciate
that, uh, he's leading the, the
charge health compact for
physicians. I think I'm signed
on to the the health with her on
the impact for social workers,
um, they're they're, I believe 5
or 6 compacts that, and I agree
with you, if you got the
compacts.
This, this is. Thank you,
Senator for that. Thank you,
Madam Chair, because after
COVID, the way we do medical
operations, um, not the
operations, the way we do.
Uh, consultations in practice
medicine between patients and
doctors and healthcare
providers, it's totally
different in the compact is so
critical, especially in this
state.
And um I look forward to seeing
that bill here and uh and
supporting it again, I want to
thank you for everything that
you're doing to get care to uh.
those less fortunate and those
underprivileged here in New
Mexico. Thank you, Madam Chair
I.
Thank you, Senator Gallegos for
a 2nd time.
man turn center, appreciate it,
um.
I like how my colleagues trying
to give really good advice on,
on how to get things resolved,
and I wanted to go back to a
conversation with Senator
Charlie was having on the cost
and I'm wondering is if you
could
UCLA
Uh, if you could ask them to
look at, so, um, with my wife.
When we're looking at second
opinion on her cancer, if we'd
gone to Houston, she'd have to
go to Houston.
And the call that I had earlier
with OSI that I stepped out on
was trying to negotiate.
A half cost value.
From the work they did in Texas.
The value of the metro, not for
my wife, but for uh um
constituent that doesn't have
insurance, so Lubbock, Texas,
um, is cutting their cost
because the New Mexican couldn't
afford them, even though they
had no other choice, and I would
see that that'd be a really good
conversation to to have not only
with uh UCLA or anyone else
because if I get a second
opinion, if I'm gonna take time
for a second opinion, my wife
would go. The Scott and white.
For my comfort.
Uh whatever the cost is, but as
Senator Charton put it.
And, and even uh er nova there's
not a lot of people that could
handle that without insurance
during that conversation with
OSI, I asked them, we need to
get a broader pool.
The poor people into to drop the
rate.
Because they cannot afford that
across the state line this
projects across state line.
And I think there's gonna be
some.
unattended consequences after we
go to pay the bill after I'm
only gone for a second opinion.
I'm gonna take, if it's a
benefit for my wife.
I'm gonna follow that second
opinion at whatever cost.
Eventually I'll have to pay
that. I just wanted to give you
another piece of advice I call
colleague not sure about it, but
I think that that's kind of
information that we have so that
we're not hurting.
Basic New Mexicans that don't
have insurance, so with that all
you, thank you, man.
Thank you.
Any other questions?
Senator Pinto
the committee
Oh
How strict is Mexico compared to
the rest of the nation.
We're, we're an outlier.
We are, uh, is, well, I see the
medical board. No, but the
letter that you got says yes,
that we are you're an outlier.
And that's my understanding,
that's what UCLA said, they're
not gonna, they're not gonna
have the fee.
And
Go through the vetting process.
Um, and I don't know, I mean, if
the medical board were to allow
a whole medical center maybe
wouldn't be such an outlier, but
my understanding is.
We're the strictest.
compared to the rest of.
Don't you for when to say that
we're not um that they're
unlicensed, but yet you say we
have a.
But you have to get a tele um.
The way they did their
rulemaking is they established
the fee. And um there were
several copy of the letter that
they
Um
That they did during the
rulemaking process and they
have.
They had all kinds of problems
with it, they thought that the
medical board went outside of
their authority, they were um
they were not happy campers
about what the medical board did
it did land us in.
The land of the most
registration which some states
have, they have to get a
telehealth in Madam Chair, um.
That telehealth license.
Would you say it's equivalent
like, why don't you go ahead and
stand and use the microphone to
answer the question.
That way we're not going back
and forth between
the Madam chair uh with, with
your permission, um, the medical
board was. I know, but like. Go
ahead and shaking
so I, I am confused, Senator,
let me, let's just, if you would
mind please answering.
I think some of the, the
confusion.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um,
senator and members of the
board, um, are members of the
committee, I apologize. I'm
Doctor Karen Carson and I'm the
chair of the New Mexico Medical
Board. Every state in the US and
the nation has a telemedicine
regulation. If you look at that
CCHPA um website. It will give
you exact delineations of what
is required. There is no state
that allows practice.
Without
a license of telemedicine
license or uh any kind of
license except for Utah, which
allows
Fre practice for a public
service where uh it is very
infrequent and you uh are not
allowed to practice in Utah, and
you cannot charge, and it is for
uh a very limited um service. So
that's the only state every
other state has a either a
registration or telemedicine.
Arizona has a registration. It
still costs money. You still
have to register.
you still have to go through a
specific process. So every state
has something that requires a
licensure because if you're not
licensed, then the board has no
recourse. We cannot do any kind
of, we have no regular
regulatory authority over you,
if you are practicing in our
state without a license and
Madam Chair, maybe I need to
rephrase that.
So throughout the United States.
I should say uh the license.
Sure
For every state is not
equivalent all the way around.
Each one is different.
So
Anyone practicing in another
state, going through this
process.
could say yes, I do have a
license, but it will not be
equivalent to what we require in
New Mexico.
Madam Chair, may I speak? Yes,
and, and Senator Pinto, members
of the committee. Yes, that's
correct. Every state has
different licensure
requirements. The states also
have different types of
licensure, so there is a full
license, and there, there can be
telemedicine licenses or
telemedicine registries. Our
telemedicine license is an
expedited license.
If we receive your application,
we give you that license in
approximately 9 days. Um, the,
uh, cost for that license is
$400 and is it for 1 year or 3?
It's good for 3 years. Other
states have different
requirements. Some of their
licensure costs are much higher,
some are lower. Um, they have
registries that make maybe
different and again, I don't
have all of that memorized, but
it is in that website.
And Madame Chair,
thank you for your um answers.
So
I have a doctor here.
As a license here in New Mexico.
Doctor from another state.
And I want a second opinion
from.
You can't really say that they
really have an equivalent
license to the doctor here.
Just that they're licensed in
that state for whatever the
maybe the same specialty.
But it's not in parody.
Madam Chair, Senator Pinto,
members of the committee, the
licenses are not portable, so
it's not the same as a driver's
license or a uh a nurse compact
license, which is portable from
state to state, each state has
separate licensure requirements,
and each state has a separate
license. Yes, ma'am.
So I
Not knowing there's not really
um.
Anything to say that.
That second opinion.
Um, by that person.
Really is kind of like an
equivalent second opinion.
Um, to the person here in New
Mexico.
Based on this variation in
licenser.
Which is probably education.
Uh, continued learning and stuff
like that requirements.
of
Madam Chair, uh, Senator Pinto
and members of the committee.
Yes, that's correct. Some, um,
Some states have much different
requirements for licensure. They
may require it, they may have
required examinations. Um, they
may not allow certain things to
be performed by a licensee and
also, which is important with
this bill is that these are not,
this, the opinion is not an
equivalent opinions, so somebody
who perhaps is a dietician could
give an opinion.
To somebody who would be a uh
Maybe from somebody who's been
seen by a physician.
Madam Chair, no.
Thank you for your answer.
And I know some of the economics
was put in there, but.
If you have someone uh in an
area or the life insurance um at
a higher.
Expectancy based on school,
based on uh training and all of
that that they put in that money
to get that licensure.
practice there.
And then we have an under
individual in another place.
Um
Achieve the same
Babies
idol of the license, but still
does not have the same um
education and training, um, and
we're still gonna pay them.
But we would pay the person
here.
That we're thing has more
expertise in some sense.
So, I, I know that's a little
bit uh we're not really uh
question but more of a comment.
That I and it's going back to
education.
We, we had our kids, you know,
out of school, and we're like,
well, we did a virtual.
The learning and stuff.
And there was always this pug
back that needs to be in person
needs to be, um, understandable,
but I know we need to, you know,
have that.
Access, um.
But I think it should be almost
standard across.
The nation and when we have a
compact, I believe when we go
into that compact.
That is what we are requiring.
That all of them are in that
same.
Um
venue of education and keeping
up those standards.
So it's, uh, I don't know how we
can work that so that we're.
And to make sure we're
protecting the our, our
patients, um, that they just
can't expect that.
Oh, if I go and get that second
opinion.
Um, that it's really
Valid in that sense or just
value base.
Um, in there. So, but
I completely understand how like
Madam Chair, if you look at the,
uh, the chart on page 7, if we
had a compact that would solve
this whole problem, the
telehealth license that people
get is actually not for the
second opinion, it's for any
what for practicing.
Uh, across state lines, so we
already allow that. It's just
the medical board wants to vet.
Every single person that anybody
in New Mexico.
Um, talks to, which limits New
Mexicans.
to New Mexican physicians. I
started thinking my mind and
maybe I shouldn't go here, but
um.
If you're gonna sue a
malpractice case, maybe even
though the standard of care in
New Mexico would be the standard
of care of a New Mexico
physician.
Um
You might, because this is a
tight community wanna get that
second opinion out of state.
Um, I don't know, you know, and,
and I don't know.
But I'm really, I'm just trying
a very, very narrow exception
for a second opinion they're not
gonna be practicing having a
continuing relationship like
somebody with a telehealth
license or a regular license
would have very narrow
exception.
OK. Thank you.
Um
I appreciate the conversation
we've been having.
This is always something very
interesting for us to.
To learn more about, especially
when you talk about access to
healthcare.
And I've been on the fence.
OK. I've had some concerns. I
still have some concerns on the
legislation here in front of us
and just a couple of questions
of clarification.
Um, on page 2.
Line 4
Um
You are
Once again, just to, to, I guess
refresh my mind.
You are listing certified or
registered wife?
Why are you adding that part?
Um
Because other states allow
people to do this if they just
register. This is a signal that
basically we're reversing the
regulations that were passed by
the medical board and basically
asking them to set up uh a
registration system instead of
a.
Um
You know, I think if they had
done that we wouldn't have so
many problems.
But instead they created a whole
licensing system for telehealth.
So what I'm.
And I appreciate that
clarification, so currently, you
have to have a license.
In the state of New Mexico in
order to provide.
Telehealth service, you know.
Whatever we want to call it.
And what you're wanting to
change it to is to say certified
or registered.
So certified means what?
Um, well, some of these, some of
these like physician assistant,
um.
I believe those are certified.
They're not licenses.
Um, some of it's to be inclusive
of the various uh.
A certified nurse midwife.
Would be have a certification.
So it's just to have inclusive
language that does, you know.
To include these these
individuals, whether they have a
license, they're certified or
registered.
OK, and the same then, um,
senator would then be the same.
Uh, reasoning that you're saying
also for registered.
For for any of these who are
listed here.
Um, number 2, well, 25.
As we add a dietician.
Is that what you're saying? Yes.
And, um,
So the list that's here.
Is that a new list that we're
adding into a statute, or is
that an existing list? No, that
is an existing law. The only
thing we added was dietitian,
this is already existing law.
OK, so previously it says means
a person licensed.
and this is before your
amendment.
A person licensed to provide
health care to patients in New
Mexico, including.
So did license?
Refer to everybody that was on
this list before.
Uh, certified or registered. Oh
yeah, I guess you see what I'm
saying. I guess it did, maybe
that's why they did it the way
they did it with the rulemaking.
So yeah,
this would solve that problem.
If you're looking at this
before, what is currently
written without your amendment.
It already says that means a
person licensed.
So that would be the that's
currently here.
Um, and of course, we did add a
dietician.
And then a certified peer
support worker, you're also
adding in.
And a certified peer support
worker doesn't necessarily need
a license.
And I know that from other
testimony that we've heard in
the Health and Human Services
Committee. That's correct.
So what you're trying to do is
to make sure that we can include
Um, a, a dietician.
And a certified peer support,
yes.
Um, and then you've also added
in here.
And, um, number 26 because we
have to remember.
Any other health care
professional.
Who has received a Medicaid
provider identification number
from the healthcare authority.
So, um,
Is there a list?
And the healthcare authority of
who these other health care
professionals are.
I believe they're that list
could be created, I don't have
it with me now.
It would be interesting to see,
and I think um.
More information for us to see
who that other healthcare.
Who is listed under other
healthcare professional.
Um, because as you know, if you
want to expand.
How expansive do we get? And I
think what would be good is to
see, uh, in, in other words,
Senator, what process do they
have to go through?
To receive a Medicaid provider
identification number that was
put there is to.
Um
To make sure that people on
Medicaid could get this benefit.
So, so that the purpose there
was to, because the Medicaid
provider identification number,
all of these people probably
have one or most of them do, I'm
not sure. I'm not sure if they
all do, but most of them do, but
I guess it just like what popped
into my head when you were
talking is maybe I I don't know
if doulas are covered by
Medicaid, but if, what if.
If that list
Doesn't cover any of these.
That that it would be kind of a
guardrail that Medicaid would
uh.
Would dictate and also if.
If they're on the Medicaid
provider.
That means Medicaid covers them
and the decision about whether
the second would be covered,
would be covered by Medicaid, so
the door that is opened by this
bill would hopefully.
Um, with the Medicaid providers
would see, oh, this is.
A loud in New Mexico.
And it's videotapes so we don't
have to pay for the person to go
there, we're going to cover it.
This bill doesn't require it. I
want to really emphasize, but it
That's, that's what we're trying
to accomplish.
And, and um
Senator Block was talking about
steps. I view this as a first
step.
Um, in
In opening the doors for our
people to reach out beyond the
borders of our state since we
don't have, um,
Specialists in so many areas.
Yeah, and I mean, New Mexico, we
are short.
Um, a healthcare professionals,
um, in our state and especially
Madam Chair and special so for
me those are.
It's just
Questions, concerns?
Um, because how expensive do we
say any other healthcare
professional. Madam Chair, I'd
be happy to, to research that
and get that list to you. I
don't have it, yeah, because,
um.
I think without some of that
information, it it's.
What are we doing? He says or
any other healthcare
professional and I, I still
think we have to have some.
I say, we call it, you know,
guard rails, but it's just to
see who else is on that list and
how expansive.
Um, with regards to we see any
other healthcare professional
who has received.
I, I res I respect that. I'm
just guessing that.
Yeah. Uh, it's probably this
list.
But, um,
I will certainly check that out.
OK.
Um
And I guess the only other thing
I wanted to mention too is that.
On this handout that we were
that.
We um handed out about the cross
state licensure continuum.
Uh, California is not listed as
on this list anyway.
In participating in interstate
license or compacts. Right.
So
Um, California, of course, is
its own entity and its own.
Gross product and everything
else, but
Mm
I always find it interesting
when you have your larger states
do what they do.
Just because and Madam Chair,
if, if I may, you made a good
point because then, uh, since
they don't have a compact, even
if we pass the compact.
This would still serve a
purpose.
Um, I know you're shaking your
head it's so unlikely we'd pass
the compact, but um,
This was still still serve a
purpose.
For those, for those states, I
apologize, I don't know what I
did. No, this thing does that
for for those states that don't
have a compact.
I always look at reciprocity
from some of these states.
Anyway, that's just another
comment.
OK, um, I appreciate your
answers. Thank you.
Any other questions or comments
from committee?
What's the wish of the
committee?
I move a do pass.
There's a motion for a due pass
from
Senator Sadil Lopez, is there a
second?
Second from Senator Block.
OK.
If you could call the roll,
please.
Senator Block.
He block
No
And our boon.
And Charlie.
No, and I'd like to explain.
And Gallegos
Oh
In her nova.
No.
Senator Pinto
And nurse
No, and I would like to explain
my
And Isidio Lopez, yes.
Hickey
And
I'll say no.
I still have some questions.
And before I announced the vote,
we'll go to uh explain both. Um,
thank you, Madam Chair, again.
Senator Lovez, I absolutely
appreciate the intention here. I
support the intention.
Um, there's just too much
uncertainty around.
There's too much uncertainty in
it, it around unintended, um,
and when our system regardless
of improvements needed when our
system doesn't have oversight, I
can't help but see risks.
Um
But I, I really do appreciate
this, and it is a need. It's,
it's something we do need.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Explain your vote. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Senator well.
I also certainly appreciate.
Well, went behind this.
I have to believe.
That these second opinions can
be comprehensive enough.
Process comprehensive enough.
Hm
To make them.
The practice of medicine in the
state.
And I heard
Mm
I believe a couple of comments
that said.
Well this opens just a crack.
But if we're going to require a
license to practice medicine in
the state.
I believe this sets a precedent.
That we might not want to
follow.
With respect to life.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you, Senator.
Thank you, um, on a voter 2 yes
and 6 no, um.
Senate, your, your Senate bill
has failed to pass.
Thank you.
Senator Stephanic, yes.
Center Stepanex is still be on
Cen bill 30.
Parents 2% cost of living
adjustments. Yes, ma'am.
This is
Thank you, madam.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Now am I out?
Madam Chair, there is um.
A very short amendment, but I'd
rather explain.
Why don't you go ahead and
present the bill first and then
we'll go to the amendment. OK,
so the uh the bill is basically
restoring.
The 2% cost of living
adjustment.
Cola for public retirees.
Over the age of 65.
For people who are retired from
the state.
Before the end of this fiscal
year.
Until 2020, New Mexico state
statutes.
stipulated that public employees
are a fund.
Earned pensions according to a
specific formula.
And that those pensions would be
accompanied.
My cost of living adjustments
that would basically keep their
pensions close to inflation.
Public employees contributed a
specific amount.
From every paycheck into the P P
E R A retirement system for
their future pensions and cola
as well contributed into PERA.
In 2020 in response to concerns
about the solvency of the PERA
fund, the legislature.
Eliminated the cola.
Rose retiree colas and 0% for 3
years, followed by a risk
sharing model.
Based on fund solvency and
investment returns.
I was one of the very few
legislators who voted against
this in the first place.
The effect of the 2020 change on
retirees.
As is that in the past 5 years
while inflation has risen.
22%.
Retirees have had only a 1% cost
of living adjustment.
Meaning that they have lost
almost 20%.
Of their buying power.
And the hopes that elimination
of the colis would somehow help
the fund become solvent.
did not materialize as fund
insolvency continues.
While PEA finds solvency is a
problem that must be solved.
We have learned that it cannot
be solved on the backs of
retirees.
Cost of living adjustments are
not salary increases.
They are simply adjustments made
to try to ensure that people are
able to pay the same amount in
expenditures as they did the
year before.
This is especially important as
we age because at some point we
can no longer work, at least not
at jobs with significant pay.
And our expenses continue to
rise through healthcare.
And in many cases assistance
with daily living either in our
own homes or moving into
assisted living facilities.
Many retirees made life choices
based on knowing what their
retirement income would be.
I venture to guess that every
retiree every retiree felt.
When they retired that they had
just enough.
Enough to get by, not to get
rich, and they were counting on
those colas that were stipulated
in law.
To keep them able to get by.
This bill includes an
appropriation of $10 million.
From state general fund
recurring.
To support retirees from state
government.
The appropriation is adequate to
maintain the compounding colas
for 5 years.
The bill includes a mechanism
for retirees from local
governments to receive the 2%
colors when the respective local
government contributes funding
into the PA fund to cover the
costs.
And Madam Chair, the um.
Amendments that I have is uh 5
years sunset.
So we had $10 million for 5
years.
So we had language if you have
the um the amendment should be
passed out.
Yes, let me go ahead and move
the amendment for discussion if
you wish to do that, please.
Um, I will move, uh, for
discussion purposes.
And this is uh
Amendment number 1 to Senate
Bill 30.
And then
230476.1.
So I will move and a second by
Senator Nava.
For purposes of discussion.
Um
Was that your
Your explanation and so Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
On page one, it inserts the word
temporarily on page 6 and 2
spots, line 1 and line 7, it
goes until January 1, 2030.
And the handout, there's a
second handout, not an amendment
that explains or shows how the
tent actually covered the costs.
For that
This does go on, Madam Chair, I,
I should stop.
And then before we go to.
I appreciate that.
Um, as with all amendments, uh,
we will go, is there anyone in
the audience in support or in
opposition to this amendment.
Will that be in support of the
amendment?
OK. Did any of you want to make
a statement or you're just in
support?
You in support.
OK. Did you wish to make a
statement?
OK, if you do, would you please
come up here in front?
And use the microphone.
And this is adding a a sunset
temporary for 5 years, in 5
years.
I'm sorry?
that
OK. All right.
Is there anyone in opposition?
Senan, is there anybody on Zoom?
OK.
And we'll go to questions or
comments from committee members
see none. Is there any
opposition to adopting the
amendment?
If you call the road real quick
on that one, please.
Mm
Senator Block.
I
And our boon, Senator Charlie.
Senator Gallegos.
In her nova.
Center Pinto center Scott. Yeah.
Senator Serio Lopez.
And hickey, Senor Lopez, yes.
You have an amended bill?
Thank you Madam Chair um
my expert today uh this is
brought to me by advocates, um,
and I sit on the investments and
pensions oversight committee
during the interim.
And this issue was brought to
the committee several times over
the interim.
But that committee did not um
endorse a bill and I actually
missed the very last meeting of
the interim where they discussed
bills and endorsed.
But this bill was brought to me
by some advocates.
Specifically state retirees.
Who felt like we needed to bring
attention to the issue.
And I have spoken with Senator
Munoz, um.
He has acknowledged that yes,
it's a problem.
I've spoken with Greg Trujillo,
the director of PERA.
And who's acknowledged it's a
problem.
And Senator Munoz thought he
might have a a different fix
than this bill, but he hasn't
shared that with me, so I've
moved ahead.
I'd like Anne Green Romig, who
is a state retiree to make a
statement.
Uh-huh. Thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, and
bringing this bill forward.
Um
I just wanna say that when.
Uh
Retirees are not asking for a
handout. They're asking to be
paid what the law said they
earned.
Every day that they retired, the
law was, that's the basis for
this when.
Um, the state wasn't look like
the economy was going down
again, we had all just survived
through the 2008.
Crash and that was horrible for
all government.
Um
For all governments dealing
with, for everybody, but
governments having to figure out
how to navigate that, so the
state was really nervous and
then.
Uh, the PERA fund solvency was a
huge what was coming to the
state through.
New money. He knew that at the
time.
So this solution was decided.
Uh, it was, it did involve a lot
of work was not part of it, I
didn't know about it at the
time, um.
But
Times have changed since then.
And we are in a different
situation and now we know how
critical it is, I don't think
anybody.
And for retirees, if they live
another dropping almost to half
their pension income.
So again, they're not looking
for a raise, they're looking
for.
Um, a pension. We in trying to
solve this problem, we have
consulted with the best vitamin.
Not current employees because
current
you'll hear from some of them
testifying against this bill but
current financial mindsets are
much more geared towards
unsolvency than they are towards
David Abbey. We consulted with.
James Jimenez, we've consulted
with Duffy Rodriguez. We've
consulted with financial experts
we're not making this up out of
the blue.
And
Um
They have presented us with the
this.
I mean, they haven't present is
a is solvent for 5 years, at
least while everybody
recognizes.
Something needs to be done.
It's just
So Madam chair members of the
committee will stand for
proponents, opponents in your
questions and comments.
OK, thank you very much. We'll
go back to the audience on the
bill as amended.
Is there anyone here in support
of this measure?
And if there is, um, looks like
there's a reasonable number if
you would line up here.
Again and use the microphone.
identify yourself and your
statement, please. Short and
sweet.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Carter Bundy with
asks me. We want to thank the
expert and the sponsor for
bringing this, um, our retirees
cola has been wholly
insufficient to keep pace with
inflation. We do caveat all of
our parables in saying that we
support bills that will be
adequate to preserve the
solvency of the fund. So I will
leave it to those experts to
decide that, but this is
certainly the kind of thing that
we need for our people. We also
want to say that
We support uh the sponsors SB
117 as well. Uh, that matches
Cola to uh the Social Security
index, so we, uh, support this
bill, and we also hope that
you'll be able to include local
government retirees as well.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, John Lipshutz
with the New Mexico Federation
of Labor AFL-CIO representing
over 40,000 workers throughout
the state and both the private
and public sectors, and for all
the reasons that have been
stated already, we are stand in
strong support of this bill.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Joy Poole.
Um, I retired after nearly 30
years of working for the state
of New Mexico as a public
servant, and um
It probably goes without saying
that the wages I earned as a
female employee were less than
my male counterpart, which now
have, of course, a direct impact
on my monthly pension. So as a
single woman on a fixed income,
I heartily support um Senate
Bill 30, and I am very concerned
about the solvency of PERA and
res respectfully request you to
um support this bill and give it
a due pass through the
committee.
Good afternoon, Madame Chair and
committee members. I am Ron
Lucero, farmer State employee,
and I am here in support of
Senate Bill 30. This is about
promises made and promises not
kept. I speak for myself, but
more importantly in support of
my fellow public servants who
depend on their retirements to
keep up with the cost of living.
Folks are hurting in their
pocketbooks today.
As you know, many retirees are
having to go back to work to
make ends meet. Perhaps you
Perhaps you know some of these
folks working here at the
Capitol during this session. I
respectfully ask you to address
The decline in projected future
per pension values. Thank you.
Um, good afternoon, uh, Madam
Chair and committee members. My
name is Sabrina Pratt. I'm a
local government retiree city of
Santa Fe. I worked for them for
27 years.
As others have said, expecting
with the reductions of every
paycheck that we're going into
PERA that I would have a
pension.
And that it would keep up with
inflation. And so,
Um, I've heard that there may be
some
Objection by uh local
governments to pitching in for
this increase, but I really want
to challenge them to come up
with what a solution would be if
this isn't it, because of the um
reducing buying power that very
much.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Paula Tackett, um,
I started working at the uh the
legislature in 1982, and Cola
was tied to inflation.
You know, sort of the cost of
living. In 1992, I was still
working, and it shifted to 3%,
which sounded great.
In 2013, and I had retired in
2010, so I got, I got a couple
of years of 3% at 2013, it
changed to 2%.
And that was in response to the
fact that the data showed that
inflationary rate was really
2.5% average, and since the
retirement coal had been
Making more than since we had
been making more than we should
have been because we're not, if
this isn't about making more.
It's about being even. Um, the
increase made sense. I mean, to
go, you know, to go down from 3
to 3 to 2. Um.
And my brain goes off. Sometimes
age just does that to you. I'm
sorry. Um.
In 2020 is they've expressed
the, the profit sharing model.
Which
I must confess I didn't pay much
attention to until the last
couple of years when I sort of
Read it
Um, and I guess what I really
want to say is, this is a
problem.
As a legislative staff person,
we used to be thrilled when it
was time to change something
because it's job security for
legislative staff, and that was
great. This is a time
When I think we really need to
address this, this issue, and
I'm glad I'm not drafting it,
but
Uh, there's good staff who can,
and I just think that
The diminishing amount in
comparison to the increasing
cost of living really impacts
all of us.
Who worked for the state and,
and a lot of whom are still
working for the state. I know
that.
I know there may be other
solutions.
But this is the one where
proposing, at least for the next
5 years. Thank you.
Speak. My name is Roxanna
Knight. I retired from the
legislative council service at
the end of 2012.
It was only a few years after
that that my husband passed of
cancer.
At that point, it really dawned
on me that there's only gonna be
one Social Security check, and
I'm sure that
I'm very similar.
To a lot of the retirees that
I agree with everything that's
been said before and what I do
hope you'll.
Pass this on
And to the next committee to let
in allowing me to speak. Thank
you. Thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, uh for
looking at this proposal. Uh, my
name is Cindy Graves. I live
here in Santa Fe, and I worked
for the cultural affairs
department for a little over 10
years, and I took time with age
for my retirement, so it is um
minimal to say the least, um,
and I did some calculation on
what this would mean personally
for me, and it's a very small
amount. It's $17 a month.
Um, but any little bit helps,
and I know it's very um costly
to in this day and age, and it's
only going to go up, um, so the
small amount increase will
really assist those who put
their, their time and their
lives into working for the
state.
Thank you.
I'm Shannon Robinson. I'm a
former state senator. I served
here for 20 years.
Um, I was here for the
Um, the time period that Manny
oughtone and Richard Romero were
our, our pro tems.
I, I survived the lucky Varilla
years.
Where we literally worked every
Per page in every line that had
to do with public employees. Let
me tell you, we drafted constant
revisions to this, to make sure
that our word to the PERA
employees was going to be solid.
Just wanted to be something they
could rely on. Many people
changed their lives.
Based upon the really good
retirement that we gave to the
PERA employees. They didn't get
a great salary.
You've heard that, but they got
a great retirement.
And to for us to now turn our
backs and say, oh no,
a uh uh a cola is not part of
your pension.
Well, obviously it is because
when we didn't put the cola in,
these people lost 200 and
$30,000.
And that is just not right. That
has nothing to do with our
intention.
Don't be afraid to say the
Supreme Court could be wrong for
them to say that this is, I
believe, is, it's in the
Constitution for them to ignore
the Constitution and now make
this ruling that PERA cola is
not the same as a pension.
Believe me, they all vest at the
same time, they all come with
the same check. It's a
distinction without a
difference. It's like a.
Look at a dog and and thinking
that his tail is something
separate from the animal.
Can't get, you can't say that to
a monkey either.
And I'll tell you, it goes
together.
Please let us keep our word to
our employees and give them the
call that we agreed to a long
time ago. I know that local
government can withstand that,
and I've discussed that with
your some of your members, and I
personally believe that local
government can carry the load.
Thank you very much, Senator
Stefanis for carrying this pill,
Madam Chairman, it's great to be
here with you. Thank you very
much and just FYI.
Senator Robinson used to sit in
this chair,
this chair. Well, it wasn't
public.
That it was sent a public
affairs committee.
had a healthier.
So
Nice to see you, Mr. Chairman.
bridge
Oh
Uh, thank you, Senator.
Is there anyone in opposition to
this measure in the audience?
In opposition, please, if you
would.
Again stand with the microphone
and
Thank you, Madam Chair. Senators
AJ 40 with the municipal League.
So Madam Chair, senators, I want
to give the local government
perspective on this.
Are we carrying our load?
Yes, we are following through.
On the 2018, 2019 commission's
recommendation to the governor.
The governor put current
employees.
Unions, retirees, local
governments on the commission
for a year to come up with what
should pension reform be?
And through that year-long
process.
We all agreed on the current
statutory structure. Local
governments.
We had to pay 2% more.
And we are currently doing that.
Retirees agreed to the matrix of
solvency and rate of return.
We all knew what the skin in the
game was.
That was only 4 years ago.
Many of you here today voted for
that because we all stood up
here and said we support it.
We all agree
This is the next step to make
the fund solvent over time.
And to make it clear.
We do not get to share local
governments in the oil money
that the state gets to receive.
So in the bill, yes, there's
general fund to support.
The state employees. There's no
general fund to support local
governments.
Our budgets have not grown like
the state has. We do not have
general fund to subsidize our
budgets.
They are very lean.
Our larger cities, some of them
half their budget is public
safety.
When you think about 2%,
That's real money that affects
public safety, that affects
services.
Our concern on this is if every
city opt in.
We're paying $38 million
collectively.
Well the appropriation in the
bill.
It's 10 million
So we then, local governments
who don't have the oil money are
then cross-subsidizing the
general fund.
The state employees.
That's a huge we ask.
That any changes that are made
to the pensions.
are not done with budgetary
minds, but with actuarial minds.
anything that we do.
The PERA fund affects.
All employees.
future employees and retirees.
And if we do anything to
increase the deficit in the PERA
fund, the next time we do
solvency.
It's worse for everybody.
We all pay more of a
contribution than we do today.
Which affects services.
And the retirees
It's the same issue.
Theirs isn't a property right.
What they have today can change.
What we pay can change, and then
the services that come along
with it are different in all of
our communities.
So Madam Chair, senators, we ask
that we stick with the
agreement.
We all agreed on in 2020. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members,
uh, Greg Trujillo, executive
director of PERA, um,
First, we do care about our
retirees. We understand the
financial hardships they're in,
um, some of you are around in
2020 when this pension reform
was done, uh, it's not a fun
process. It's not fun decisions
to make. There's only only two
levers we have. We can increase
the amount coming in, which we
did by increasing the
contributions for both the
employers and employees in
reducing the amount of money
that's going out. That was in
the form of reducing the cola.
Nobody wanted to do it, but
actuarially looking at where we
were going to be going in the
future. It had to be done.
Uh, today, returning the 2% even
if it was state employees, uh,
it is very costly. It's very
costly benefit. The funding in
the bill is not adequate, but we
have provided an actuarial
analysis on that. Um, the other
issue that we're struggling with
is our retiree population keeps
growing.
The next probably year or two
we're gonna be paying more
retirees, then we will have
active employees paying into the
fund.
On average, our retiree
population is 69 years old. The
life expectancy is also
improving. We expect females in
our population to live till
they're 85, or I'm sorry, males
who live till they're 85,
females till they live till
they're 87. That's a huge
financial commitment we have to
these populations going forward.
So increasing cola even at a
five-year period, you know, on
average, a retiree is gonna be
74.
We're still going to be paying
them for another 10+ years.
I mean, that's the issue that
we're trying to manage is that
demographic issue and just the
sheer numbers of where our
population is going.
Um, so we're, we're not
anti-Cola. We, we just need a
way to fund it. Um, and with
that, Madam Chair, I will stop
and be available for any
questions. Thank you.
Thank you. Is there, is there
anyone on zoo?
No? OK, no one on Zoom.
So with that, um, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members. Lopez.
Thank you, um.
You know, I serve on iPod 2.
And um I know you know this
article 22, um section Article
20 section 22 of the New Mexico
Constitution.
Um, prohibits us from enacting
any law that increases the
benefits paid by the PERA unless
there's adequate funding.
Then it goes on to say that
there must be a report.
On, on the funding.
Um, and it says the PERA let's
let's do the actu actuarials,
um, is that
Report
Uh, in the FIR is the report
that PIP.
ERA has to do under the
constitutional provision is it?
Or is there a separate document
that they created.
Man, I, I defer to the uh uh
PERA for that question, but uh
this bill does have an
appropriation for those 5 years.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes,
that analysis is in the FIR um I
believe on a, and that's just on
the original bill, not on the
amendment that was just passed.
And if you would like the
numbers.
Uh, Madam Chair, will we and and
PRA looks out on a 25 year
period, not just a 123 year
period, uh, to fund a 2% COLA
for just state retirees that are
65, and then adding them to that
2% model as they age to 65. We
anticipate $33 million is what's
needed as an annual
appropriation, uh, that same
model for the municipalities is
383 and then that doesn't
include the contributions, Madam
Chair, by the um municipalities.
Uh, Madam Chair and nurses.
Lopez, it's 33 million for state
retirees, 38 million for the
municipalities.
Um
is so, Madam Chair.
I, I noticed that there's a lot
of bills listed in the FIR um.
Involving uh temporary or just
different uh cola increases
cause I support the idea of a
cola.
But we can't do it unless
there's funding under our
constitution and
It's just not not good.
Not good to do that. So my
question is, is, is, um,
If we move this forward, it's
going to finance. Is there going
to be a final.
Figure that finance will work on
at that time, how is this gonna
work?
So, Madam Chair, senator, thank
you for the question.
This is going on to finance,
finance will determine whether
or not the 10 million could
address uh the state employees,
they also could amend the bill
for the um city and county
employees with uh an additional
amount of money or with the
enabling legislation so at this
time, I just decided to come
forward with the state employee
section and let.
Finance chat about.
What they would do fact it moves
on from this committee. So,
Madam Chair, I, um.
I support the idea of a cola.
Um, I'm gonna vote to pass this
forward to finance, but I may
not be able to vote for it on
the floor if it doesn't satisfy
the requirement.
That we have the funding for it.
Um, and that that cause that's
just not.
It violates the Constitution and
they pass that constitution.
Make sure we were responsible.
Um, and I
It's hard when you pass a bill
and you don't have enough.
Funding for something this
important, so I, I like I said,
I'm gonna vote for it.
But I think that I got the
report from the municipalities
and it's concerning. There's not
enough money.
I mean, the Constitution only I
think required uh applies, I
don't know I'd have to.
really read cases about this,
but I think the Constitution
only applies to the state part.
Or does it apply for the full,
Madam Senator Lopez.
Sopera is a multi-employer cost
sharing plan, so it applies to
all benefits, not just the
state, the ultimate plan sponsor
if, if something really negative
happened to our funding, the
ultimate plan sponsor is.
So yeah, I, I just think um
there's not enough in the bill,
there's not not enough in the
allocation.
And we can't do anything about
that, it really has to be
financed.
It does it.
So while I'm gonna vote to pass
it on to finance.
Um
I just hope it gets worked out.
By the time this gets to the
floor.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, thank you, Senator, Senator
Block.
I, um, Madam Chair, I believe
Senator Scott, he, he actually
had his hand up first.
OK.
We'll put I'd be more than happy
to cut in front of him.
No.
So if.
It's OK if you're willing to
then Senator Scott.
Oh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, what was your name again,
sir?
Mr.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, Greg
Trujil.
Uh, Madam Chair and Mr.
Trujillo.
I haven't been on the.
Apo interim committee for quite
a few years now, but
When I left there, the PERA
funds were what I would call
underwater.
That is
Projected liabilities exceeding.
Rejected revenues by
some very substantial amount.
Can you describe that how, how
much that is.
Madam Chairman and Senator
Scott, um, today, the state has
promised uh over $26 billion in
benefits, the cash that we have
on hand is about $18 billion so
our unfunded liability, which
you are talking about is about
$8.7 billion.
Uh, thank you for that, Madam
Chair and Mr. Trurilo.
And would you say that if this
bill becomes law, we, we add to
that.
Unfunded
Liability
No, Madam Chair and Senator
Scott, that is correct.
Bye
70 70+ million dollars per year.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Scott, I believe the amounts
were uh over 25 year period for
the state plan. Uh, it was about
600 million, uh, and for the
counties, it was, I believe,
about 300 and something million,
but I can get you those exact
numbers,
madam chair, I was going to
assume that this was going to
sunset.
And I'm gonna visit with.
With the senator Stefaniks here
about that sunset here in just a
minute, but
If it's sunsets.
As
These folks are.
Or
wanting to do now with the
amendment.
What would those
Increases in unfunded liability.
We haven't done an analysis on
the amendment quite yet, um, but
I, I believe it's, it may be
even be higher because
Uh
After 5 years.
These retirees are going to
continue, you know, living, we
hope.
Um, so if there's no additional
funding coming in after the
sunset, there are benefits don't
readjust after that 5 years.
They're going to stay at the
level they are, and we're gonna
have to fund those higher
amounts going forward. Madam
Chair, Miss Truhill, I
understand that perfectly.
So now let me, Madam Chair.
Move over to Senator Stefaniks.
And ask how that.
Issue
Might be resolved.
For the long term.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, senator for that question,
you know, as a member of IPAC,
I've also recommended that a
very large amount of money.
We put into PERA.
During every budget year.
And the recommendation has been
accepted in very small amounts
in past years and nothing has
been recommended.
As of this year.
And with a very large state
surplus.
And knowing not just PEA, but
any other.
Liabilities, whether it's risk
management liability, whether
it's the state.
Whether it's retiree healthcare.
This is the time the state
should be looking at all of its
liabilities.
And
That has not been something that
I. Madam Chair, senator.
It does not seem reasonable.
That we solve that problem
first.
Before proposing.
2%
Madam Chair, Senator.
It might seem reasonable, but
We have a very large number of
retirees in the state.
who are feeling the pinch.
We have a very large number of
people who are paying more for
the retiree health care.
Just because we have given.
Stayed a lot of those increases
are paying for their increased
medical costs for their health
insurance.
But when these.
Retirees receive a flat pension
with no cola.
They are receiving no assistance
in paying for higher medical
care.
And yet we are raising the
retired healthcare rates.
So
We need to look at what and what
we are doing for our state
retirees.
And that is
I know there might not be a
perfect solution in this bill.
But I do think it's something
that.
Well, Madam Chair and senator, I
can certainly appreciate.
That we've made promises that we
can't keep.
I guess I would question the
wisdom.
A stack in more promises on top
of those.
Without first taking some steps.
To solve the problem. Let me,
Madam Chair and senator, let me
move over to
The local governments would to.
Stood up in opposition.
I think mainly because there are
no funds.
Earmarked
From
From those entities that they
would have to come up with on
their own.
Without the benefit of these oil
and gas revenues, could you
Address those concerns.
Thank you Madam Chair and thank
you, senator. I did have another
backup, um.
Amendment that would strike one
of the sections of the bill that
would open it up to um.
The city and county employees,
but it would need an increase in
the amount of money the
appropriation that the state
would make.
And all of the experts that um
Anne has worked with who worked
with our budgets and uh DFA and
LFC over the years.
You know, they indicated that.
Cities and counties contribute.
Themselves. The state did not
subsidize them.
The steak, put money into the
state employees. So there is an
amendment that could be put on
this bill.
They could open it up groups,
but we would have to put Madam
Chair, senator, we don't really
know actuarly how that would
work at this point, do we?
Madam Chair, Senator, we don't
know actuarly because uh we did
not provide all this to uh Mr.
Trujillo in advance, he received
the same worksheets that we had
yesterday.
But the individuals that did
work with us, you know, and
we're.
You know they're learned people.
You know we're talking about
John Gasbridge, James Siene.
Duffy Rodriguez, uh, David
Abbey, people who have worked
with a lot of numbers.
And they indicated to us.
That this 10 million per
5 years could cover the costs
for those 5 years.
If we wanted to jump and open it
up to the municipal.
We had an amendment in our
amendment 20 million, but we're
not really positive that that is
why I believe this really is a
discussion if it moves on that
finance should really, you know,
study and tear apart.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um.
First I'd like to thank all the
the workers for showing up and
advocating for this, and I
definitely appreciate um
Senator Stefaniks and
Um, your other, uh, sponsors
here.
Uh, bipartisan, by the way, with
uh Representative Martinez from
Rio Rancho.
Uh, working on this.
And um
You know, there's a lot of tough
stories out there, whether it's
um, I believe her name was
Roxette.
Uh, Roxy, I can't remember the
loss of her husband and takes
away some of the income.
Um
But Senator Stefaniks, you
mentioned that uh you've talked
to Senator Munoz about a
potential solution, but, but you
didn't get into that too much.
Is there, you give us a little
bit of detail into that cause
that might sway some people in
here.
So Madam Chair Senator, um, I
wish I had more detail. I said,
though, would he like to sign
on? and he said, no, that's not
gonna work, I have my own ideas.
That was the extent of it.
Oh, OK.
Thank you, uh, senator. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Well, that'd
be nice to get a glimpse under
his uh
His melon to think, understand
what's going on in there.
You know, I, I, I come here and
I don't know if I'm the only
person on here that was a
previous county commissioner or
not, um, but you, you were OK.
And, and I got my county
commissioner hat on here when I
look at this.
And I gotta tell you the, the
director of Paris awards were
very compelling and true.
But this, this does squeeze.
The local governments.
It does, um.
And when I think about that, I
think about.
My county Sandoval.
And how it would take away from
our tribal services from our
infrastructure, meals on Wheels,
senior centers, behavioral
health in indigent fund.
Uh, with also increases uh that
we've seen in um
Detention center operations with
different um
Legislation passed out onto the
counties' fire sheriff, police.
And then I think about um my
friends up in Cuba, um, who are
on a very, very lean, lean
budget as well as Sandoval
County.
And
It's squeezing the local
governments is how I see this
and and the retirees as well.
And
I, I guess I, the, the question
I have is someone mentioned like
a 2% rate is $17 a month.
And there's a bill coming down
from Senator Thornton and I to
talk about oil and gas rebates,
which quite frankly will be a
lot more than $17 a month.
Uh, to help out the people in
Mexico cause as you rightly
said,
They're squeezed under
inflation, uh, it's, it's been a
tough economy for the past few
years. We all get that.
Um
Can you tell me, um, where
Where
Local or municipal league may
have said they would have to
make cuts at the local level if
we implement this.
Um, madam chair and senator, I
think.
Thank you, Senator, uh, Madam
Chair, I just like to, I know
the municipal league is here,
I'd just like to hear their
thoughts on where
Um
You know, they, they represent
all these different entities and
municipalities and counties,
what they're telling them of
potential customers to services
to, to people across New Mexico.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator,
this is the unknown. So there's
If a local government chooses to
opt in today, right? That's a
choice that they would be
making.
So you have the immediate issue
of we would then be contributing
more.
proportionally than what is in
the bill for state employees,
right? We are one pool.
Therefore, we local governments
are now subsidizing.
Problem number one. Problem
number 2 is the unknown, right?
When we do pension reform every
decade.
Right? The unfunded liability
just continues to add up.
So as it adds up, that means we
local governments will have to
contribute more just like we did
the last round, than we did
previously. That is where it
affects our budgets.
What we cut
You all know what we spend our
money on.
Roads
Water, wastewater, public
safety.
Those are our options.
Uh, thank you, sir. Thank you,
Madam Chair, uh, and those are
quite frankly,
Those are options that are are
non-negotiable uh for me uh and
those folks in my district and
uh both counties.
Um, especially in Sandoval
County, uh, with the diversity
of the county uh from tribal and
rural and how they are
contingent like you said, I'm
sorry, they are dependent on
those services, uh, big time.
Um
One of the uh
Madam,
Madam Chair, let me, let me just
ask Senator Stefaniks in your
group, why did you pick uh 5
years. Why, why not 7, why not
10? Why not 3? Why 5?
So, Madam Chair and senator
after we um developed the bill.
And uh some of our experts, uh,
10 million per year for 5 years
and determined that the amount
would be adequate to cover the
state Thank you, Senator. Thank
you, Madam Chair. And, uh,
Senator, let me just ask you in
the bill here,
Um, the, the word contingent is
troublesome.
On page 6, line 10, as you know.
Um,
What, what happens if a
municipality.
The village of Cuba, the city of
Rio Rancho.
Sandoval County, Berlio County.
San Miguel County, Moore County,
what happens if they don't?
Uh, contribute.
If they're not participating.
So madam, madam chair, senator,
I'm probably not gonna be the
legal expert on my answer, but.
I would assume that
They would not be eligible then
if they're not contributing.
Thank you, Senator. I, uh, thank
you. I, I agree 100% with that,
and that's why this is leaving
people off the table.
Potentially and it really does.
Uh, increased risk for our
Uh, are
Our travel partners, uh, those
uh that are
Right at or above the poverty
line, especially those below the
poverty line that are.
I
Counting on these services that
some of these municipalities and
counties.
Uh, provide
And right now, I can tell you
doing budgets for 8 years at the
county level.
It's, it's tight, especially
when we have.
In increased insurance premiums
that the legislator has mandated
on on local government. It has
increased our risk and increased
our our budget.
Uh, hugely. So I'm very
interested in what Senator
Munoz.
has to say, because I, I think
the guy is brilliant when it
comes to that, and I really want
to get a, a peek under the,
under the melon.
Uh, before I
I, I, uh, see this.
Um, but I think you're, you're
trying to solve a problem which
I completely appreciate as I am
with Senator Thornton on the oil
and gas rebates for the, for the
citizens or residents of New
Mexico because they will get
more money in an oil and gas
rebate than they're getting with
a 2%.
Uh, cola increase, so.
Um
I, I look forward to like, I, I
gotta tell you, um.
Who knew, Senator Antonedilla
Lopez and I would agree on so
much, and she's exactly right on
this where she doesn't know if
she's gonna do the Senate floor
or not and prove this.
Uh, but I
I'm willing to listen to Senator
Munoz first to hear what he has
to say to work with the
municipal League and the power
director to get a good solution
for the people of New Mexico,
but I just want to say thank you
again for for bringing this
forward because it's a huge
issue, and I'm sure you read.
Uh, this piece of paper here.
Um, that had some really, really
big numbers of an increase the
unfunded liability by 839
million.
Uh, I'm not Elon Musk. I don't
have that type of dough.
Um, to help out and that's a
problem.
Because like Senator Scott said,
the government makes all types
of promises, and they never ever
keep them.
I'm a prime example as a retired
military guy where they made me
promises and so many other
retired vets on healthcare, and
they just said, well, we don't
have the funding anymore, so now
you're gonna increase my, my
healthcare costs or other
veterans' health, healthcare
costs. So I, I appreciate uh the
great effort here uh to do this,
but I'm, I'm gonna be
respectfully a note today and um
I'm looking forward to um all
the boojie woogie going on in
Serna Munoz's head, uh, uh, get
this thing going.
All right. Thank you, Senator,
uh, and director and municipal
League guy, um, thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you. Any other questions
from committee members?
Senator Gallegos.
I'm sure I'll be brief. I just
wanted to clarify and turn
center, uh, earlier you talked
about you had a backup
amendment. Can you tell me what
the cost of that would be, I
don't know if you stated that or
if I just missed that.
So, um, Madam Chair and Senator
Gallegos, if you removed uh on
page 6.
Section J and a few other words.
On page 6.
And change the 10 million to 20
million. The question would be
whether that would be enough,
and we, and I couldn't answer
you today because the worksheet
we have is for state employees
at 10 million for 5 years.
Madam Char I said way back here,
um.
And, and, and that brought me to
my question cause I was told
already at the current 10
million.
For 5 years is actually 28
million short.
Of what was needed and you
calculate that out, it brings
you the $140 million short in
the five year period.
And so I'm wondering even, even
if you do.
The math on the from 10 to 20, I
think there's gonna be huge.
deficit there and and and I know
I'm sure I'm, I'm chairing
center that um.
There's some other options in
the mind of uh.
er Minos.
But it's one of those things
reality piece for me and, and
just going back, I've had.
Constituents had called.
And wanting help that they're
not state employees.
Just with the increases in the
last 4 years.
You know, when you're on a base
budget.
It's hard for all of us to
maneuver and to live. You look
at, uh, food, 20% higher than it
was 4 years ago, so if we do
this, not only is it gonna hurt?
Uh, those are paying taxes,
they're going to hurt those that
are on reduced incomes
statewide, so, uh, I just, uh,
my thought is I'd
I would hope that as you go
forward.
That you guys would get with
someone to really, really do the
deep dive into the math, uh, I
have a bill.
On adding a telecommunicators to
uh.
First responders
He pair
And Madame Chair and senator.
The gentleman for you or next to
you has me on hold because they
don't know what it's gonna do.
Overall, I've had this bill for
like 4 years.
And it's never been moved.
Because we don't want to hurt.
The process in itself.
So I've held on to it.
Reluctantly waiting for the
numbers to look right.
So that it's a benefit to the
state.
And not a detriment.
So as with my colleague at this
time.
I'm gonna have to vote no just
because I don't see how I can do
the math.
And with that I'll yield chair,
thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Is there,
are there any other questions?
what is the will of the
committee.
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Savia Lopez with a
second from Senator Charlie.
And if you could call the roll,
please.
Senator Block. No.
boon
Senator Charlie.
And her G Gallegos
Nova.
Pinto
And Scott
Yeah
Serio Lopez, yes.
And her hickey and her Lopez.
Yes, you have a due pass
recommendation, Senator, on to
finance. Thank you very much,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
We have one more measure,
Senator Steinborn.
Senator, why don't you, I know
you have an amendment. I believe
this is your amendment. Is that
correct?
Why don't you do a presentation
first on your bill and then
we'll go to the amendment.
Sounds good.
OK. Hello,
Hello committee. Boy, I'm really
reluctant to touch this
microphone.
These things are
Peculiar. Anyway, uh, Madam
Chair, colleagues, it's great to
be with you. I know it's been a
long day for all of us. I think
this is hopefully a little bit
simpler, Bill.
Um
So I present to you Senate Bill
45. That'll be a little bit
better.
Senate Bill 45, which um
Seeks to add to the statutorily
approved purposes for basically
what we know is indigent funds
in the county. The Mexico law.
a source of funds to pay for
help with indigent costs of
healthcare, um, by creating a
mechanism called a county
healthcare assistance fund
created through a small uh
percentage of 1% of gross
receipts tax, counties can
charge. My understanding is
every county in New Mexico has a
county healthcare assistance
fund with the exception of
Brolio County, who has a
different funding mechanism.
What this bill does, Madam
Chair, colleagues, is it?
Allows the use of it really to
its full intended purpose when
it was created.
Which is to allow counties to
directly cover um costs of
health premiums for people as
well as direct healthcare costs
and not just kind of around the
edges kind of costs like
transportation.
Um, it is not
These funds already exist.
Counties already have them in my
county, they collect about $9
million a year. It would just
vastly enable them to cover more
people, indigent people, which
would help all of society,
frankly, um, and then, um, and
then I'm in hospitals who have
to pay indent funds and doctors.
Now we'd have a population
that'd be covered in my county
alone, we think this would help
as many as 3500 people.
Which is pretty remarkable.
I don't want to overstate that,
um, and so I'll stop right
there. We do have the Donana
County, um.
Probably messed up her title.
She's in charge of
Uh, health policy and managing
all these programs for Donana
County. She's on the line right
now. She's as close as I have as
an expert witness who can answer
questions about the way this
works and any questions you may
have.
And uh I'll stop there, ma'am
chair and then talk about the
amendment when you're ready.
OK, well, thank you.
So for the amendment for
purposes of discussion, I will
move.
The First Amendment to
Um, Senate Bill 45, so I will
move in a second for discussion.
Senator Pinto
present your amendment. Sure,
madam Chair. So the amendment
clarifies because it says that
they can pay for premiums. It
clarifies that that can also
include public program premiums.
That could be anything from a
Medicaid buy-in to.
Um, you know, the high risk
pool, I suppose, although
they're very restrictive, but
the fact is, it's a, it's a
publicly funded thing and that
would be a great option for
many. Some are fighting for
that. It doesn't specify that.
It just basically adds and
clarifies that the coverage can
include public programs.
Not just like a private
commercial insurance program.
And that's what the amendment
does, ma'am. Thank you, Senator.
So on the amendment,
Um, is there anyone in the
audience in favor of the
amendment.
Yes.
Did you wish to add any comment
or no? OK.
Is there anyone in opposition?
Sinan on Zoom, is there any? No?
OK.
Um
Any questions or comments from
committee members on the
amendment.
Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you, uh, Senator Steinmo
for being here.
Um
In, in relation, it's, it's an
interesting, um.
Amendment because you're adding
the private health in there now
for, for indigent, it looks
like, correct? Well, ma'am
Chair, the bill starts with,
well, it says.
insurance and we're saying um
Well, we're actually adding
public.
really what we've added to the
bill. It's the public part of
the insurance policies are
struck out and then it looks
like it's more narrowly focused
now is how I read that.
opposite, madam.
health insurance and now we're,
we're, we're saying and there a
public or private insurance.
We're adding the public part to
the insurance part that was
already kind of in the original
I didn't read it that way, so
the clarification. So on the
private, on the private
coverage, um, for indigenous
patients here.
Do we know how many people um
on, on the indigent tough word
to say, I apologize.
On the indigent side have
private health insurance?
I don't, Madam Chair, Senator, I
don't know. I, I know that I
believe there's 3500 people
enrolled, kind of getting some
of those benefits and doingana
County, um, so that's the
closest answer I can give you,
but, um, and I don't Jamie
Michael may be on the line who
can answer. I don't know if
she's.
She's texting me right now. So,
you know, if you'd like to hear
from Jamie, otherwise, that's
the best answer I have for you.
That'd be helpful, I'm sure you,
Senator Madam Chair. Jamie
happens to have the number, if
not, uh, senator, it's not, it's
not a big deal. I was, it's more
of a curiosity.
Uh, how many are covered. Yeah,
she did text me this is the pay
of last resort. So it's not,
it's not, you know.
First resort, people are coming.
It's just people who have no
other way to you. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you. Any other questions
on the amendment?
Senatoryia Lopez.
Um,
This is gonna be a question on
the bill, but then I, I was.
I, I think it may be related. So
in the
In the fur, it says um
It may be prudent to specify
that the county may cover the
premium net of other federal or
state premium affordability
programs or employer
contributions, which makes sense
to me to just be clear that
exactly what you just said, this
is the the.
Source of last resort.
Um, and so does your amendment,
by putting
Um
Public or private health
insurance policy, does it kind
of get there? Or do we need more
language?
Um
Well, Madam Chair, Senator Sidil
Lopez, from my standpoint, it
doesn't need more language
because I think these programs
are working, we're just
expanding their use. I think
they already have criteria,
these programs that already
exist, um, they know a
population, they can't serve
now. So I don't think there's
anything broke there.
That we need to now go and add
some language in law.
Um
Again, Jamie can answer further
beyond that if you'd like, but I
don't, I wouldn't recommend that
unless we have their guidance on
what that language should be.
And this is the guidance this
amendment is the guidance that
she's recommended to. Well,
maybe we'll discuss it with the.
With the bill because I have
other other questions kind of
related to the first so.
Um, but I, I support the
amendment.
Thank you. Any other questions
on the amendment?
Sina, if you would call the role
on the amendment.
Senator Block.
I
And her boon, Senator Charlie.
Senator Gallegos.
In her nova.
And Pinto
And Scott
Yes
And I said Lopez, yes.
And a hickey and her lous.
Yes.
You have an amended bill.
Um, so we'll go back now on
Uh, you had your expert witness.
Did she wish you?
She's on the line, ma'am chair
and maybe uh it would be great
if she would wanted to offer
some comments. Jamie, would you
like to
Um, explain more of the bill as
an expert witness.
There we go. Yes, yes, madam
Chair, are you able to hear me?
Are you able to hear me?
Still cannot hear you. Hello.
Madam Chair, are you able to
hear me now?
No, cannot hear you, Jamie.
I'm still here. Is anyone able
to hear me?
We're OK.
We're not able to make the
connection voucher, I think.
My mic is working, not sure
what's happening, Jamie,
um.
We can't hear you, so I think
we'll still continue as best.
If maybe you can.
She says her mic is working,
but.
Uh
Yeah.
They're checking over here, but
we're OK from our side, it seems
to be OK.
All right, well,
I don't have much to add.
Proceed and maybe Miss Michael
you can text information or
speak, and we can read it.
How's that? Um.
So let's go to the audience, um,
on the bill as amended. Is there
anyone here in support?
If you'd like to join us up
here, please, in the microphone.
Good evening, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
Erica Sanchez with New Mexico
Center on Law and Poverty. We
stand in support of Senate Bill
45 as amendment, as amended and
thank the sponsor for bringing
it forward. We believe all New
Mexicans deserve access to
quality affordable health care,
and counties provide an
important safety net for New
Mexicans who face the greatest
barriers to access.
This bill gives counties the
option of additional flexibility
in administering county
healthcare assistance funds to
cover premiums and out of pocket
costs.
Meeting a need identified by
counties and by patients. And
while also offering
Leverage these funds to have an
even greater impact. So we asked
the committee to vote in favor
of Senate Bill 45 as amended.
Thank you.
Anyone else in support?
Anyone in opposition?
See, is there anyone online?
So with that, um, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Senator.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, uh.
Thank you again, Senator
Steinborn. It real quick, what,
what is, what is uh Jamie's
background? Is she a county
employee or senator, she is, and
Jamie, maybe you can text me
your official job title. She
like community service, uh,
whatever she's like the director
of like health programs, yeah,
all right, just trying to
understand that. So, uh, thank
you Senator. Thank you Health
and Human Services director for
Donana County.
Health and Human Services
director for Donana County.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. So it's a little
bit different set up than, than
what I'm used to that that's OK.
Um
I
I want it, so I, I talked to my
uh county manager on this Wayne
Johnson, um, and some other
people that were
Not favoring this, and I wanna
I talked to them about the
process, how we fund this.
Um, again, no gotcha questions.
this is important stuff.
So
There's a budget is there
currently a line item in the
budget to uh in Donana um
specifically maybe Jamie can
text it. Is there a line item.
Uh, for funds to cover health
care costs in the budget for
donating.
I mean, Madam Chair, senator, I
can't speak to that. I know that
by law they have this fund.
And this expands the use of this
fund and that's all the bill
does.
Or this population.
So I, but I don't know if you're
asking about.
that
population or anything else but.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
man. Let me ask it this way.
When the county has to pay the
out of pocket expenses on top of
the premiums that they're gonna
have to pay with this bill. How,
where are they going to get
those additional funds because
every county is totally
different.
And for my particular county
that I'm familiar with.
It's mostly used.
On the um
The, the travel, um, our tribal
partners have access to it, of
course, and, and in the rural
areas are a little bit more,
they're, they're more poor than
real ranch, and they have
limited access. So when those
funds
Um, run out based on the
increase in premiums and out of
cost expenses, where do we,
where do we go for healthcare
then?
So, Madam Chair, Senator, so
This is just an option. This is,
you know what, this doesn't
require a county to do anything
to cover people, you know,
including it's, it's like
available funds, expanding the
use of what they can use that
fund for. It's also their choice
if they frankly wanna supplement
this with other county general
funds, right? A county could
presumably do that if they
wanted, but they're not
compelled to do that. So,
Um
My understanding of my county is
that they're just wanting to use
this fund that they have funds
available unlike maybe your
county, maybe in Donana County,
maybe they charge a slightly
bigger GRT rate for it, um.
But they, uh, but they have
available funds that they could
cover more people if they had
it. In your case, maybe you feel
like you're kind of using them
all in your county, and then
having more authority.
Doesn't get you more because
you're already using all the
funds. So it's really maybe a
case by case situation and
Including if they choose to
find.
Supplemental funds in the county
to do this, but it's not a
mandate, so.
It's not gonna necessarily
trigger that unless the county
wants to do that.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
I, I think that's an important
piece to know. It, it's not a
mandate, so all 33 counties here
in the great state of New
Mexico, the land of enchantment,
they can decide either at the
commissioner level, I would
imagine, is, is that what you
envision where this would come
before all the board of
commissioners to decide which
way the county's going to go in
adopting this particular fund or
not.
I chair Senator, so Jamie's
texting me, yes. OK.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. And
And I don't know if, if, um,
Donna County is this way, but
our county indigent uh support.
Uh, it's provided by up to
0.1875% of each county's taxable
gross receipts.
Which is different again and how
much you raise across all 33
counties, that number is 0.1875%
of each county's taxable gross
receipts.
Um
And then the health care
authority has noted a possible
indirect impact in counties that
would adopt the expansion would,
would this again, Senator, based
on the option of opting in.
The counties would have the
option if it's not working out
of opting out.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, I
don't
That's a good question. I mean,
that, that would be, that would
not be impacted by this law,
right? This law.
Uh, authorized the creation of
this fund which every single
county, 32 out of 33 counties in
New Mexico have done.
So they've opted in, right? This
just expands the use of what
they can use those sorts of for
healthcare.
Um
So,
The opt in or opt out, it's not
well it's not written here, it's
explicit. They're, they're,
they're not.
in here for them to use this for
anything.
It's just authorizes it, so I
suppose.
They wanted, they, they probably
the law would allow them to not
tax themselves if they wanted to
just do away with it altogether.
I'm not sure. It's not in my
bill.
But that, that would be existing
statute.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair, uh, in regards to
Um
Medicaid, uh,
Does not require a monthly
premiums, co-payments or
deductibles. Is that fair to
say?
I'm sorry, did you say Medicaid?
New Mexico Medicaid does not
require monthly premiums,
co-payments, or deductibles. Is
that fair to say? Uh, as I
understand it, Madam Chair.
I just want to verify that
that's true for this, um, thank
you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair. So out of pocket expenses
on this.
Depending on, I assume there's
some type of deductible built
in.
Those would, those would not,
would those be outside the scope
of uh Medicaid benefits.
Um, they could be, Madam Chair.
I, I don't really
No, you know, if a deductible or
copays involved with Medicaid,
um,
Jamie knows, maybe others know,
but
But if it was, this could help
cover it. We'll say that much.
Thank you, sir and thank you,
Mare. I'm not, well, I, I don't
know if I agree with that 100%
because we'd have to kind of
talk through that a little bit.
But if an indigent person goes
to get health care under this
program, and, and there's a
premium paid by the county, it
sounds like, correct? But the
out of pocket expenses.
That's, that's, that's the rub
right there because they may or
may not be paid by the person or
the county.
Is that fair to say?
All right, this your, this might
be helpful, madam Chair,
Senator. So Jamie texted me,
this is for people that do not
qualify for Medicaid.
Yes, sir. Thank, thank you, man.
Exactly. So those out of pocket
expenses, is there a deductible
or is that different for each,
each person in this program? Are
there deductibles?
Ma'am, Chair, senator, I suppose
it would depend upon the policy
that they was procured for.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair, and Senator, um, if
a county does implement this.
Uh, have you guys done any type
of cost analysis to see
Uh, with a pilot program to see
if this is gonna be an increased
cost to the county or not?
I wish Jamie was here by the
way, Jamie, come on, fix that
audio. Um.
Well, I think Jamie knows the
numbers very well. I mean, we,
we've been working, you know,
we, we try to get a message on
this a year ago. She, and by the
way, not just her, but last year
the association of counties
endorsed this bill, hospital
support this bill. I think in
our county, she has a very good
sense of how this would benefit
the available funds. If the
funding wasn't there, Jamie
would be the first one saying
that.
Um, or if it was some mandate.
So I think
She knows the population size
that it would help, which she
has put in the thousands.
And uh
I, I, I think
Are you able to hear me now
So, yeah, last, last one. Thank
you, sir. Thank you Madam Chair.
So there's no there's currently
uh Don and did, did not do a
pilot program.
Did they, did the county
commission implement this,
uh, to get some good data to
say, hey, Senator Steinborn, we,
we gotta write a bill. This is
really good stuff. Actually,
Madam Chair didn't come from
Donana County. It didn't come
from Donana County. It came from
a woman who advocates for people
with cancer.
don't
Who, who are, who are indigent
amazing woman named Yoli Diaz.
And Yoli knew.
You know, that this can be a
lifesaver for people who don't
have healthcare. Jamie was fully
in support when the bill came to
4.
Um
But yeah, I don't, she's saying
we do not have the authority to
do a pilot program. So this is
new, so they haven't been able
to do a pilot under this. It
sounds like they haven't done
their own program outside of
this.
To just, but I mean, insurance
costs what insurance costs,
right? So it's a knowable
number.
what it costs and
There's an available pot of
money.
No.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair, I yield.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um, I
was just looking up 27-10-4, um,
And this is actually relating to
an earlier bill that that
failed, but out of pocket costs.
Because I know including doesn't
limit, so including means
including but not limited to in
statutory language.
Copayments and deductibles.
Deductibles, does that mean
means other things incurred by
indigent patient insured
pursuant to the terms of a
health insurance policy, would
that possibly um cover the cost
of going to another state for a
second opinion.
Oh, that sounds like a different
bill. Speaking of other bills,
Madam Chair, I vaguely rings the
bell from popping in here
earlier in the day.
Uh
Yeah, I don't know, ma'am. Sure,
Senator. I suppose it could.
Um, well, because I'm looking at
it cuz including the is means in
legislation, including but not
limited to. I don't know, like I
said, I just, um, it really
bothers me if that provider
um, so in New Mexico and we
don't have was part of the
policy.
Um, the people most affected by
this would be people on Medicaid
or even worse, people who aren't
eligible for Medicaid.
So, um, of course I support this
bill, and uh.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator.
In our population is not
eligible for.
I'm gonna, madam chair, senator.
I'm going to defer to Jamie on
that one, because primarily
people who make too much trauma.
um
Documented.
And uh Jamie.
You could text me an answer on
that one.
That'd be great.
She's she's texting away,
senator.
Oh
Whilst while we're waiting on
the text to arrive, madam chair
and senator.
Oh
His aunt, as I read the bill,
this basically.
Makes
Yeah OK.
To buy insurance.
For those
People not eligible for
Medicare.
Medicaid
Excuse me.
Mediate
Um, yes, Madam Church Center,
that's correct.
OK.
How's the text coming, so she
said it's primarily for people
who make too much money or
people who are undocumented.
People who make too much money.
Madam Chair and senator that are
indigent.
Well
It's called the indigent fund,
but they might make a little,
might make more than a just over
the threshold for Medicaid,
so.
But I'm just reading the text
back to you.
OK.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator for your answer.
Thank you. Any other questions?
Um,
Is this, with this program.
In a certain county be limited
to the residents of that.
Oh, madam Chair, I would assume
so. It, it.
And I'm sure would that happen
maybe in.
Um, I think I read in the FIR.
Um, that the local county
hospital, they would set up the
process. Um, Madam Chair,
Senator, this would be the
county government itself, not
the hospital. Yeah. Mhm.
Um
And I ask that question, Madam
Chair, because I wonder, um, if
it, if it's not limited to the
county residents. There may be
an influx of.
Patient.
And a and a strain on a county
who's able to provide.
So I, I just
Yeah. Well, so Jamie gave a
little clarification. She said
these are, some of these people
are people who make just over
the threshold for Medicaid, so
we're not talking about people
who are flesh.
People who are just above that
line. Um,
Jamie, I assume this also is
just for residents of the
county.
Is that
The statues already says people
on the filed and your counting
Madam Chair, you know, 32 out of
33 counties have it. So,
Um
They have that benefit in their
own county,
so are they gonna move when
their own county has the
benefit, probably not.
Uh, could someone move here from
another state, I guess it's
possible, it's just very
circumstantial, right? I still
need a job and lots of other
things. They're not gonna just.
But for that, I wouldn't think,
but.
Madam Chair, um, Senator, thank
you that just, it's a great
segue into my next question.
Um, which is, it would be
wonderful if all 32 out of 33
get into this program, um, and.
What is the plan to socialize
it?
And outreach to let um.
Intended I'm senator, that's a
good question. Uh, it's probably
county by county how they would
do that and how they would.
depending upon how effectively
they're doing it now, right? How
connected they are to those
communities now would probably
be a segue into how they could
do more.
Um
So I don't know.
Answer your question, that's the
county government then and also
up to them depending upon their
resources, right? If a different
county, really, this doesn't
give more capacity, they're
probably not gonna market that
or be able to provide that in
case of Donana County, this
really, they have the capacity
to be able to do more.
So, uh, it's county by county.
And, and Jamie also sent a text
that the law already says only
people domiciled in your county
and get your county.
Androgen funds.
Madam Chair, thank you.
Sure.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Gallegos.
Madam Chair, thank you and
Senator, I appreciate it, uh, as
I stated earlier on the other
bill, I've been doing some
insurance stuff and I've got
just a few questions, so
currently I thought that a
county could act ask for more
slots.
In either the poor HCA.
Or and I, I guess I'd really
thought about this. It was Donan
only if you had more indigent
people coming in, um, earlier
you talked about uh the
undocumented and then later you
talk it had to be just residents
of the county.
Uh, I'm trying to figure out.
If there's a mass population out
there that we're trying to to
help or is it one or two
individuals because I thought
the pool would allow the county
to buy into bring them into the
pool and I'm just wondering if
Jamie could look at that.
Thank you. Ma'am chair center.
I'm not quite sure I understand
your question.
Uh
Maybe you could ask it again
if you have an individual right
now counting.
You've got Eagles new one he's
an indigent.
And you don't have room.
Or capacity, you could ask the
pool.
And then you guys would pay for
another slot in the pool or HCA.
And then that would cover my
Posh, whatever that is for the
indigency for the county and I'm
just wondering why we're not
doing that or you have to have a
bill.
Uh, to go forward, I'm wondering
if it's a capacity thing.
Or what's causing this.
I know you talked about one.
I assume that young lady
but it it's, I'm wondering if
it's a broader problem.
Or if the pool can already
handle it.
Well,
I'm kind of on the edge of my
knowledge, but what I
understand, if you mean, you
mean the high-risk insurance
pool, is that what you're
referring to? Yes.
I'm sure, I risk insurance pool.
As I understand it,
Actually, probably needs a
little bit of reform because it
doesn't allow a third party to
pay a premium for it.
I actually think the premise of
the question is not necessarily
correct.
That the county can just
register somebody into the pool.
Now this.
added
Saying that the county can
participate into a public
program, I would hope that would
be the case.
County insurance pool is also a,
an insurance option of last
resort.
It is, but it is higher cost,
but for people who have no other
insurance option. But I think
the premise that they have that
option, so why do we need this?
I don't think that's actually
accurate. I don't think they
have that option.
And they don't have it through
this funding source.
Which I think is more to the
point of this bill.
That taxing the residents for
this fund for this purpose, and
this would allow them to use the
fund.
So even if they could pay into
it.
This is about a funding source
bill, really.
As well as, of course, being
able to provide that with that
funding source. That kind of
help answer the question.
Mo chair and center now
confused, so I thought
originally you said these were
people that didn't call for
Medicaid, so they're not poor.
They're just above Medicaid
level was that?
Not an earlier testimony and
Terrence Center. No, that,
that's what I said, Madam Chair,
but I wouldn't, I wouldn't
classify someone who makes just
a little more than the Medicaid
level is, is.
You know, I wouldn't necessarily
use the word not poor cause I
think that's still very low
income, you know.
Um, that's on the means, so.
Uh
stop right there.
Well, Mr. and
and turn a senator, I, I, I
totally understand. Maybe I need
to choose my words wisely. They
always call me minority here and
I take personal offense, but
Uh, I guess I was just trying to
figure out the status of the
person because I think that uh
some of the qualifications to
ACCA.
could fit if not in the.
Um, helpful, I, I guess I'm just
trying to still figure out where
the need is if we're talking
about one person statewide.
Would it not be easier to solve
that one person's issue.
And, uh, and I know it's knocked
in.
Uh, to the other 32 counties.
I'm just wondering if we're not
putting this out there for the
wrong reason.
I think we're, Madam Chair,
Senator, with all due respect, I
think we're putting it out there
for the best of reasons. And
it's more than one person. It's
3500 people in my county alone.
You're talking this is gonna
help thousands and thousands of
people.
Who
Um
You know, don't have access to
healthcare. So what happens?
They're showing up in hospitals.
They're uncompensated care.
They're exacerbating the problem
of doctors in this state, and
they're income viability. So I
think this is, this solves a lot
of problems. If you can get more
people covered then they're
healthier. They have fewer
chronic conditions later on
there productive taxpayers. I
mean, yeah, it's just this, this
is just an important part of
living, you know. So I think
this is
This solves a big problem out
there, not just a little one.
Now I will say this though,
under state law,
Um, governments can help buy
into the marketplace.
So, um, exchange programs, and
because of that income level
you're talking about it is
heavily subsidized thing through
the healthcare affordability
fund through federal tax
credits, right?
So that's the good news is that
these premiums are
are not very expensive. Well,
Madam Chair and senator, I'm
glad we got in the weeds because
earlier I'd heard that this
wasn't about.
On County
Or Donana County now you're
telling me it's 3500 in your
county alone, so, uh, are these
all
Residents are they?
Um
Undocumented
I guess my clarification Madam
Chair,
as Jamie put it there, domiciled
in the county and that clarifies
me
and turning senator, so I will
vote against your bill. Thank
you. Thank you, Senator.
OK. Any other common? What is
the will of the committee?
Motion for a due pass from
Senator Pinto.
With a second from Senator Nava.
If you could call the roll,
please.
Senator Block
I'm going to vote I, but I want
to explain my vote after Madam
chair.
And our moon, Senator Charlie.
And Gallegos.
In her nova.
Pinto
And her Scott
No.
Insidio Lopez, yes.
And Hickey, Senor Lopez.
Yes, and before I announced the
votes to explain his
His vote, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Senator Steinborn,
um, fellow members. The reason
I'm voting yes is because
there's an option for the local
governments. If this was
mandated, I would be a, a, a no
100%. And with the uh the uh
association of counties
endorsing this as well.
I think they endorsed it because
it's an option. It gives the
county's flexibility if this
particular program, uh, works
better for one county over
another, so that was my reason
for voting yes. Thank you,
Senator Steam, just to be clear,
and I had said this, but I wanna
say it again before the vote is
fully baked in ink. I said they
endorsed it the previous
session.
So they're looking at it now
again because they have a
process where they have to do
it, but they voted, they, they
endorsed it last session.
But I couldn't get a message
last session on the bill, but
they're now considering it now.
So if that, if you, if that
affects your vote, I just want
to be.
Well, thank you. Thank you,
Senator Steinborn, for bringing
that up. So the association of
counties has not endorsed this
bill this session.
Same exact bill that they
endorsed last session, but they
have a process and they have a
meeting and I just talked to
them about a couple of days ago.
So they have not endorsed this
bill, this session, and I said
that, I said they endorsed that
last session, but
I'm saying it again, just so
you're clear, since you brought
that up.
If you wanted to change your
vote.
Sure.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Uh, Senator
Steinborn, I'm, I'm gonna trust
you on this one.
Stick with my vote.
If it turns out to be wrong, you
and I will have words privately
and verify with them by all
means. Thank you, sir. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. You have a 6 to 2.
You have a due pass motion.
Thank you, appreciate the
discussion.
Have a good weekend everybody.
We'll see you Monday.
