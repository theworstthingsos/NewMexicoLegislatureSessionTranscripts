So we did we have life exacts a.
Procedure.
That is it is not to share until
I yield above the need for the
course of the.
And there is a public that.
In our base I just get a lot of
our work.
Session date.

Existing language right now.

But all of the cases that would
be subject to a for.
A visual picture of an
individual sector part of our.
Whether or not this also causes.
that would be suppressed.
A visual our audition of the
verification of member of the
public a family member staff.
That would not be releasable to
the public.
Sources or appropriations is
existing which.
Representative.
Representative is well let's

You need to ask.
With the computing dispatch

All of this for.
Yes.
It also asked.
By providing the day per day
which is.
And the more law enforcement
officer or.
Oxidants or the consultation.
And that's fine.
Hey everyone least the local
through and the vision leaves
scare those reserves are
section.
Well if you want to spend your
time watching the videos.
And not our topic.
Rejected.
Then you can come on site.
And other governmental sources
that for information.
Eight years.
You cannot copy the.
You get up.
Of.
Really.
Jessica with you.
I was looking for and then you
know what to ask or specificity
and something needs to be
redacted well.
The definition of what our our
records in the existing
language.
The final date of this bill.
Missions.
Representative would cause
definitions come that would
leave them in order to give the
racks is a definition leverage
technology systems.
Which is the Senate definition
we're using in three different.
Of forty for two bills this
year.
What.
Again whatever that definition
is that is limited.
In terms of what would not be
released to those things the
publication which was no
specific.
Finally some of the definitions.
With regard to protect personal
identifier information.
For including credit debit card
numbers the rules included with
regard to not elected employee
of public body.
The employee's Business home at.
We still related.
The city states that.
That's well.
But exactly where the person
lives we don't need a release.
For the employees who work for
public.
So does this.
Is this does this make it
perfect not to stop there are
other things we'd like to do.
We have committed to continue to
talk this year for a while we
had precludes our structure as
one of the things that will be
protected we need to get to
that.
When we have definitions this
year.
We're gonna continue this
conversation.
Yield to my co sponsor
Representative yeah did a
fantastic job of them get this
through the house.
issue lexical Committee separate
everything thank you chairman
thank you Representative thanks
for being here.
That was generally like stand
for questions okay I'd like to
hear from the tourism sector in
state police for sure and the I.
T. people.
Could you say something about
this bill that secretary to
thank you Mr chair members of
the committee and Jen share
secretary of tourism this year
we announced that will be the
first state in the nation to
subscribe to a new technology
called the TIRS exchange this is
being used across the globe but
here in the United States New
Mexico is the first and what
this does that elevates New
Mexico into a global platform
where are.
These have a better chance of
some parity having global
recognition so that we can
increase our international
travel and domestic travel and
so it connects suppliers and
distributors an online
marketplace so we're very
excited about this is going to
support businesses throughout
New Mexico with different
service fees with Expedia
Travelocity bringing those fees
down so that with profit margins
within the small businesses
increase and they get better
recognition globally so thank
you for considering this bill
how does this bill help you with
that yes so we use a global
provider the answer.
To explain the problem if you
are on Expedia and you decide I
want to stay in the fund.
Then your information as a
consumer goes through Expedia
through the exchange with the
tourism department over to look
on.
And then in turn we have all of
the fund as rooms and computer
systems are connected into the
exchange that.
Those rooms are available for
booking and so this particular
legislation stops the ability
for someone to impress all of
your personal information and
all of the information the
businesses that have opted in to
use this technology to serve
their interests that thank you
very much miss what state police
what's your view on this is Mr
chair members of the committee
we're very supportive of this
measure for us to come a.
It's like we have all the
different department we have
approximately fifteen years we
have about fifty thousand for
the year well Department safety
that might be something simple
for those three pages or that
might be.
Us a major incident as hundreds
of hundreds of pages with
hundreds of hours of video I I
give you an example so well for
one so if for a this is not an
update with the time that we
have so much more data and so
many things that we did not have
before like some of the
exceptions related to you know
video that we might have a into
the parts or or or deceased
individuals and stuff like that
that.
With that was not even really
when they're certainly captured
before but nobody can everything
are you the example of you saw
Act size because I never
provider in the country acts I'm
the only person what's more
videos Act funds you.
The amount of data that we just
have to echo the is.
Issues so this helps one with a
couple of things one
make sure that we don't really
sell this thing I think people
who have.
People would be shocked if
people that it for us this
looking for stuff because most
other you to we have to put it
for a.
Gruesome whatever dead bodies of
I mean it is that we had a
couple years ago we wrote the
Aztecs school shooting and then
post all that of the website
they make many of to make money
off of that so I mean we have
the state that people in that
state I don't think they realize
that at this point like you can
just ask for it and we're some
help to get it the other part is
there is the specificity we get
these project yes blanket
requests that what every video
that has X. Y. and Z. or like a
two year period I mean that's
hundreds and hundreds of hours
of service had house near that
down like yes you can still get
you can get with you
flexibility.
It was more of the burden on
them to be specific in that just
give us all fishing experiencing
that.
Thank you thank you is very
helpful.
yes.
Thank you Mr chair summers what
instruments also on the
secretary designate for the
information technology and this
bill will simply protect
taxpayers I. T. investment
tour is in particular I have
with me why chief information
security officer Raju's
involvement of.
We don't want to tell that guys
which windows or unlocked.
The guard comes by we understand
you know all the government is
that we need to lock the windows
and get more secure.
What no we're not going to tell
them where.
Most vulnerable place to attack
is also a with the the term
local STRUZZI operations manager
broadband they're doing a lot of
work to bring broadband out
especially since communities the
large underserved population
that we have in order to do so
they reveal competitive
information on how much pricing
it would be pro life per se or
you know for talking to or what
we might be going through and
these other companies to simply
use that say oh well we're gonna
be eight dollars less and and.
Just
subterfuge the whole process so
we support this bill of
scampering questions great thank
you Mr secretary
okay let's go to the audience is
already.
It was very very from Wagner
let's hear from fog yes basis of
chairman members of the justice
for those of the writers and
lobbyists for Mexico foundation
for open government we don't
stand in support or opposition
legislative solution really do
you think of both a sponsors
legislation for freeing us to
the table early these
discussions and working out of
this language to make sure that
it is there are only two years I
specific to these items so at
this point with the ability to
not stand.
Good to have you here of not in
opposition to thank.
Yes.
Thank you Mr chairman committee
my name is Joyce person on the
executive director for New
Mexico counties we see this is
very important legislation is
but a priority that's been
discussed again throughout our
members just as an example
McKinley County recently
reported that English me to
speak individual is actually
sending different quests and
mandarins simply as an
obstructionist measure to trip
up the counties in there ever
responses that level this is
because our clerks and talked
about how this is.
Simply to obstruct their
services rather than actually
get vital information we also
see this is important for
protecting victims rights and
disposing arson keeping that
disclosure very sensitive
materials out of the hands that
really should be and as they
popped up with you to so thank
you with that we do stand in
strong support of this thank you
thank you anybody else want to
stand in support of this yes
please.
Morning Mister chair members of
the committee findings working
is and I am the president of the
Courts in finance officers
association I hear
representing the subsection of
the Mexico municipal league as
you all probably know that
subsection representative about
a hundred and sixty to schools
parks so this is a really
important bill to us in the
right direction.
In for it for us which was
enacted over thirty years ago as
you've heard from other speaking
there's been major investments
in technology once safeguards
that were applicable to.
Are no longer applicable to the
digital world that we live in
today is so with most of us
which have received substantial
increases in it brought some of
us ten thousand a year some of
its four thousand a year and
everything we what we're asking
Legislature to basically provide
us with the procedures related
to how we providing us hold our
statutory requirement has chief
records custodians as well as
the privacy and secrecy to that
members of the community and
also to the infrastructure
systems we think the US sponsors
and look forward to speaking
with you com.
C. bills for thank you great
thank you miss Martinez okay we
have on the online.
Four people amended all the
time.
It was.
Okay I just want to.
He took were up to yes there are
okay well let's hear from Ethan
Watson the the Albuquerque city
clerk.
Good morning.
I'm good morning members of the
committee Mr chairman
city state corporate City of
Albuquerque.
Yes I'm here.
Thank you to you here today.
Hello can you hear me.
Since the last of how about you
that would let you know that
they have seventeen people that
do nothing but if a review of
police videos and here seventy
seventeen people because two
years ago he talked to me about
this at that time yet six right
it's not up to seventeen part of
it is they have a couple left
you two channels that could not
the.
An eighty.
That whatever solution stuff
they confide to put our money to
make money.
Okay how
about anticipation of my
collection recollection of.
yes Mr chairman my name's
Michael excellent I'm the county
attorney in Santa Fe County and
I'm chairman of the county
attorney affiliate of the
counties association I would
like to you to support this bill
as Senator Ivey Soto said would
like to see some additional the
chair of the Tories of COVID
from Mexico.
And what the session of those of
competitors of look at us and
they think that this will be
very helpful.
particularly with regard to the
rights of and a lot of the
visual information that people
request so they can fight off
and get out there on their own
websites are distribute to focus
and that.
Very good okay well let's see is
there anyone here in opposition
to the bill.
Anybody on the line in
opposition to it members of the
committee senator I just a new
focus.
As there's no physical.
Okay of the Mike is picking
yourself up all the time okay
thank thank you Mr chair I am so
impressed with how
how many of.
Sen introduce you worked with
but I was wondering did you work
with the imprint of advocacy
organization for LGBTQ I
So of this gentleman and
Senator Lopez they are part of
the coalition
that was behind the so you.
They when they approach and
indicated that they had some
interest in often what we're
doing they took a look at this
they ask for a couple of changes
the economy there changes after
the changes they dropped their
opposition to the.
The reason I ask Miss Mister
chair is that protected personal
identifier information includes
everything working on with
regard to the personal
information protection bill
would amend that.
In the.
The.
State employment at.
So that
so that the.
Employees of the state would be
trained not to release that
information and what it doesn't
include in this immigration
status and L. we and the sexual
orientation and gender.
That was in that bill that bill
was pocket vetoed by the
governor so is not lost but this
governor has protected stick
through of.
And protected through government
to the governor governor borders
that information I'm concerned
about what is not being
protected here.
Releasing that information could
subject of those individuals to
harm.
And I'm surprised as anybody
from the ACLU here or I don't
know if there any immigrant
advocacy groups or other groups
because that was very big and
very important with care that
will and I don't see it here
Charlie the Sherin and Services
all of us these are the issues
that we're able to agree on this
year as I indicated we have a
number of issues that we that we
need to have a conversation
about over the coming year
I do think it's appropriate for
us.
issues of gender identity and
orientation.
as well as information status.
protected I didn't.
As as protected information as
stated that the services going
forward.
Well those in this case up one
dryer yes whatever major on the
very bottom of the page the two.
Twelve yes
well.
This is been working.
Renegotiated refined.
What about this word what about
this race.
All this kind of stuff.
It is.
Because there are competing
interests we had.
The lot of consequences with
that.
And so that's why at some point
we said.
What this bill.
Wed Representative Sarinana is
for so like I said cybersecurity
bills that I added critical
infrastructure.
The last revision before we
finalize this I am dropped.
I wanted to build.
Just.
And so these are those things
that we're able to get through
now.
With a commitment to continue
the conversation about this and
that regard I really do want to
appreciate up that the
governor's office we really
patient this as a good actor
just bring people to the table
and making sure there was a
table.
Hosted to bring table to to have
these conversations and try to
get people to the right which.
Thank you Mr chair I I support
the bill and because certainly.
Acting right now is crucial I
just want to put on the table
an invitation to those groups
whose when release of that
information really hurts their
communities and so I I just I
thank you Mr chair.
Mr chair yes the second one yes.
Sure apparently the webcast food
here the the the thing Watson.
If.
And and and and the webcast we
just couldn't hear him here.
So they're gonna try to fix.
This
is a call and let's hope that
the.
And fishing yes there was.
This is the case.
Senator.
The first.
Sure tracing in yes.
Senator try you again we hear
you.
reviews.
The committee losses it or use
it on over.
Last year
There

issues will for future
conversations cities support.
Okay.
Thank you isn't.
but Mr Eshelman.
Sure yes yes we can.
Well we could.
Still is.
Take three okay we can sing.
This
is
what
the county attorney and county
certification Senator county
attorney rise and support of the
this is the.
couple that examples stated that
is the main the downs also yes
hi this is the new owners.
All across
the state lawsuits to force and
these are things like business
partners a listed taxless
properties.
These are the S. R. no actually
need mortgages he's trying to
get into four pieces so usage of
stone the district here we're
seeing or violently lawsuits or
advanced.
The state police talk about
massive amount of data we see
here in Santa over case
involving security the.
there was a reason.
Photos of the dead man in his
house the autopsy report.
The massive of data downloader
people's phones guesses and
these are normal.
Through this many groups make us
do the research or the services
there's a group employer.
This request is there this is a
whole is this.
So students because we refused
to the use of.
These these that they so.
And we're doing their research
for for the so we were.
And the other Sanchez and
committee your committee hearing
talk about these issues because
we're we're driving so this call
these brought this up we have a
situation glad everybody's.
We really need some help and we
love this.
Thank you Mr chairman great
thank you very much mistrust
one.
Okay members of the committee
Senator McKenna you're next.
I thank you chairman.
Representative I have more of a
COVID chairman of questions.
So I'm really pleased that this
is.
Four the past year I've been
hearing from Catholic Church and
Santa Fe County just how
inundated they've sent and just
is what credible wasted time
because like someone said in
here and I've heard of before
they are weaponizing defraud I
know New Mexico livestock board
director Belinda garland have to
hire someone just to do it
requests for office so this
whole time the and so what has
emergency calls on it.
Thank you for the last four.
The
use of cattle.
Okay Senator Geiger students are
looking for the names of the
cattle.
So that Mr center Representative
Thank you for the often see that
the.
Ivey Soto twelve times.
But my question for you and I
appreciate we talked earlier
about the restrictions on
addresses I I have a bill for.
Senator single and date but I
think there are certain things
we need to be able to protect
for minor selected.
commitment to protect and
people don't know exactly where
to go to their home but on my
question for your bill Mr
Senator Representative is is
there a difference in the in per
request for how would you
designate it's our citizens
verses out of state our citizens
persons.
anyway to capture that to be
able to see that residents of
the state would have already if
they have concerns.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Senator Paypen is that is
something that some states to
distinguish we do not and that
is part of the conversation.
Appreciated the.
Gentleman bank talk about in
this is it pretty of my screen
or
Lancaster you know for.
How many times I've been opposed
in in school board elections
which user will speed up your
like this winter but it is just
one of those things but every
time that he's actually come to
me ask for something he had
rationale for so I just want to
make sure that as we go forward
we look at citizens versus you
know the the you to tell so
maybe I can see that they're
using it for their monetary
gains Albuquerque's well known
problems they have in law
enforcement in so there to speak
about that but that's not
happening find out so that way
when he corners me online.
Yes on this bill will come along
we'll take care of you sense
with that are you thank you.
Thank you if you put anybody
else centers okay let me let me
just a couple of questions and
we can take a motion
If the police have to set up a
viewing room I mean is that is
it feasible for every police
department have a viewing room
where people want to come in for
over hours and hours of video
looking for something.
The state is that is that is
that something that you would be
able to do.
Mr chairman committee Senator
Ortiz Y. Pino so I would say
this I think.
About work that it will say for
the most part of probably make
up for metal work that is
involved in making that
successful.
Very good I just maybe making it
they have to commend would keep
the people from Florida from
driving into our yeah yes and
the guy Hobbs with just a look I
think for the most part will
probably happen is a lot of
those the use of like.
Those stop those requests
I think Act is very easily see
like in the Albuquerque area I
mean it probably helps.
Media stuff too like if they
want to come see stuff they can
review it and they can do for
exactly what they need is the
so good this is thank you thank
you to a couple of the questions
so collected officials addresses
would still be available Senator
yes.
And Senator Popo Bill earlier
this session reversion here I
think on the police campus of
the bill comes how does that
measures your bills proceed it
was restricting what could be
revealed.
So Mister chairman of that was
so that bill had to do with with
the cameras need to be turned on
R. this bill has to do after the
records of the court something
what do we share okay good and
then what was the last one hello
does your bill's deal yet you
have or is this one of the
topics you have to look into the
future the issue that was
brought up of of the.
By people who don't want to do
the research themselves a they
expect the clerk's office to do
it for them the.
This this start system that that
direction by distinguishing
between the release a video or
if you just want to have a view
of the new year's.
Your job on it the things like
searching the the records for
for staff to file their.
Cases that have been filed yeah
this this this doesn't quite get
there on everything the special
public records act really has
become the delivery of public
records act.
We need to grapple.
J..
members of the committee for
this yes Senator told thank you
Mr thank yous Senator and
Representative for working on
this precocious this here is
what.
Hello this is this issue became
so overwhelming and why is it
taking so long to get a bill.
So and Senator.
This is been growing over time.
And we that we are I think it's
been a problem for the last four
years at least.
Part of it is getting to where
we got a critical mass.
And getting to where people are
willing to sit down have a
conversation.
That's one of the places where
again.
The fact that the governor's
office was willing to make
available one of the conference
rooms.
And if I could log.
To the table Representative
Sarinana being in contact
regularly with the ACLU
Throssell process.
has really helped in terms of
making sure that this is done in
a properly balanced.
So thank you for that answer.
The the only to be critical so
this so I missed the first part
of the.
Presentation it can I assume
that with the one the last
states to do this one first Mr
chairman and Madam
we.
So so that was what was regarded
by whatever's.
We're one of the states and has
the most open this on it there
are a lot of states we have to
go to court that a judge
authorize was.
We're not going down that
direction.
We just want to just keep it
appropriate.
Both thank thank you Mr thank
you for that answer looking for
a motion or a question for
secretary.
And.
Senator Representative Mr just
for clarification so community
plan may on page ten.
I.
I thought more protection I see
the reason that is they give the
detail but not city state
prison.
Direction from identification.
Because so on page ten yeah for
the new language yes I thought
there's more protections for the
identity yeah it's just most
state city or zip code actually
no it's just the opposite.
No street address.
Right so so we don't release a
street address.
The city state zip and by the
way.
Information the the program
starts and with tactically yeah
we about three years ago just
search you know.
are you aware of the situation
because implausible and a lot of
group of people who I got caught
stand trial and one of the roof.
Started every home addresses
Walters.
For both of her a little while
the police officers.
And that will protection law to
say the.
Mr chairman Sir
that's the thanks for ninety six
we had B. I. agent.
They should.
Yes ma'am and then after the
shooting.
Legislators I put that bill out
to protect all of us in going to
court but that's what I want to
make sure that there's
protections in here as well
right now at first I thought
there were and when the chair
asked the.
All the different views implied
assertions what the impact thank
you Senator Sedillo Lopez and I
I just wanna said I just got a
text saying that sexual assault
and probably to Mr find people
want to be at the table to in
the specifically to sexual
assault because they said they
have the DA's offices of
receiving it question child
forensic interviews from people
who have been convicted of child
abuse and child sex abuse from
within facility so that's
another.
Improve the W. S..
They're not in the area no this
is but that is actually moving
forward this is exactly that so
please continue to work.
Yes
children what we had sexual
exploitation of children.
Okay yeah we're just talk more
over chat for friends you can
right.
Members of the committee with
some of the committee that's so.
Told to.
Secretary will call the roll
call.

And New Mexico Representative I

February twenty first nineteen
twenty and the daughters of the
American revolution to who I
have here
I commemorating the historic
passage of the nineteenth
amendment to the constitution of
would be sitting at this time so
with that whole district it over
to this team.
Employees of the this will
welcome back to the three twenty
sixteen still as hot as.
What I said.
Thank you Mr chair Senators we
appreciate your time this
morning will be very my name is
Tina last week I am region of
the Stephen watts Kearny chapter
of the daughters of the American
revolution that's the Santa Fe
chapter Michael Morton's Elena
Ortiz who is a retired public
educator school administrator
and survivability three terms of
elected term on the state this
president of the state board of
education
through the crazy D. A. R.
ladies okay I would like to
thank our sponsors Senator
courageous Bill and Senator Mimi
Stewart who could not be with us
what we are excited to have city
admin Senator Sedillo Lopez with
us today because she is a
descendant of one of these
ladies we are trying to honor
okay we are asking for no
appropriation G. R. pace its own
way we always of paid for our
monuments and plaques and
markers like the ones we have at
the Santa Fe national cemetery
for the Santa Fe pro talkers and
the new Viet nam veterans mind
in the Santa Fe national
cemetery and also also a trail
markers that you might see if
you travel through northeastern
New Mexico ending right here
Santa Claus daughters of the
American revolution commonly
called the A. R. is a lineage
and service organization we are
lineage because we track of
dissent through revolutionary
service from that war we are
nonpartisan and nonpolitical.
We are open to all women
contract that dissent and prove
their lineage New Mexico has a
wonderful connection to the
American revolution through
their for city of soldiers who
served here in Santa Fe they
were required by king Carlos of
Spain to donate back to pesos of
their May measly little salaries
to king Carl says efforts to
thwart the English it's not
because Spain or France actually
love the colonies I hated that
so it was called the donor and
the presidio here in Santa Fe
has some of the best records
exist of their soldiers much
better than state California
Arizona presidio.
So we are proud that our state
can do that and we boast a
number of women of that descent
we're just or Wisconsin they
probably can't find a those
scales to join your organization
we are the largest women's
service organization.
Last year New Mexico members put
in more than thirty thousand
hours of community service
across the state nationally were
already up to four hundred
thousand hours this year and my
chapter itself with eighty five
eighty seven members put in five
thousand hours last year in our
schools our faith communities
serving the homeless serving
veterans women shelters food
banks handing out constitution
but looks at the county fair and
working on historic preservation
part of projects and public
gardens.
We were founded in eighteen
ninety in DC when when asked to
join the newly formed sons of
the American revolution and
return now watch out folks the
ladies went ahead and organized
and started the daughters of the
American revolution in eighteen
ninety our chapter here was
formed in eighteen ninety eight
this eight years later while we
were still territory under the
tutelage of Mary Catherine
prints the wife of territorial
governor territorial judge and
then governor Bradford requests.
Our daughters always focus on
historic preservation patriotism
for honoring our veterans and
active duty military personnel
and educating of those around us
about our founding fathers in
our founding documents today we
simply want to honor the women
and men that Senator Sedillo
Lopez mention we work tirelessly
here in the state two passed
suffrage we did not pass it
until the federal government
forced us to consider
ratification it was passed in
nineteen nineteen in DC and that
it was finally ratified here
issue mentioned in February of
nineteen twenty we try to move
this forward and twenty twenty
the one hundredth anniversary of
women's suffrage but of course
we all know what happened right
about this and low morals for
not being heard.
New Mexico is not at the
forefront of any of these
efforts by the way we were
forced to consider for
ratification after it passed at
the national level we could have
done what state Wyoming this
which gave women the right to
vote in nineteen of eighteen
seventy six when they became a
territory.
We also realize that native
Americans were still
disenfranchised even with the
passage of the nineteenth
amendment in fact they were not
given the right to citizenship
until nineteen twenty four under
the help desk president then the
right to vote in nineteen forty
eight some aspects regarding
voting rights for native
Americans did not pass until
support New Mexico Supreme Court
dealt with it in the nineteen
sixties.
Eight AM to four o'clock in the
rotunda simply recognizes New
Mexicans who work hard and are
here toward women on more equal
footing no names will be listed
on the plaque and like the year
two thousand Flack we already
have in the rotunda hallway we
will list the New Mexico state
organization D. A. R. rather
than our own specific chapter
Stephen watts Kearny on that
plaque.
The these people include Andrés
error status Jones from Las
Vegas he went by a Johns can't
wait for that and
he was elected to the Senate in
DC to represent New Mexico and
he chaired the Senate suffrage
Committee into critical years
nineteen seventeen to nineteen
nineteen and maneuvered so good
politics there to make sure this
stayed alive until it passed in
nineteen nineteen the women
that.
Some of you will be related to
as Senator Sedillo Lopez is and
senator Cory Bill R. Nina Otero
Warren who is an educator and
superintendent of schools and
she is featured on the new
quarter that the US mail out.
Lois this day are me hope this
was the first female state
government employee she was the
librarian and she had decided to
keep that position she went to
the New Mexico Supreme Court
overly zero who was a teacher
and activist Marguerite Fund
array Baca who was secretary of
state for New Mexico I need a
Romero.
Arabella Romero and her daughter
read I just sizer Cassidy the
weather was Gerald the artist
Julia brown Asplund Ellen J.
Lente lar Fraser you will hear
about these women.
more and more I think it's just
replacing the honor they deserve

the course today and with that I
stand for questions very good
did you want to say anything the
sorties.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee senators they
bring you along the Mr chair of
one of the only so just to make
sure that you all know that
there's some of those that did
not fight in the room for.
Thank you very much and thank
each and everyone of you for
your support then also just
working with you.
Thank you senator let's go to
the audience and see is there
anyone here who wants to sit as
show support for this memorial.

a I just so years back I went to
the Holocaust is in Dallas and
they have really good needs of.
I DO and I liked it were
actually to and our veterans
memorial in loving.
You go by these plaques they
have an audio version so you
could hear the names of stories
of these years so that way is
people come up to the.
Learn to fall just for thought I
don't know if the capital of San
I think it's just something that
is there is a large amount of
people to come here to see the
capitol along review so if
you're able to put these names
and information and to make
Senator.
Sam our state is as a whole and
how we got to so just a thank
you that's lovely.
The sister thank you they have
to go before the capitol what is
the capitol building commission
or something we go to the floor
next week but when you get and
then we go to the capital
recognition subcommittee Mr
chair and most of those people
have already heard this bill by
sitting on committees at this
point and then and that will
probably convene shortly after
the session in the house after
this session ends and then we go
through the national channels
with D. A. R. itself we have to
gain local approval and building
approval before we can take it
to the national level D. A. R.
and then we hope to have that
installed very quickly but they
haven't Albuquerque vendors but
that the committee is the one
that can say yea or nay to you
yes Senator Wirth Senator Mimi
Stewart Senator Baca of equal
number of representatives on the
other side also yes.
Good point all right any other
any other discussion from the
committee but so will the
committee.
So do press says seconded by
Senator McKenna secretary call

thank you
read the plaque of.
The commission for.
Okay I will use you have a a
memorial for it and senator
Munoz could be here but also the
on his and I'll just do it right
here.
is memorials Senate Joint
Memorial to I think there's
several people here who want to
speak of for that so I'll just
start with the.
The Senate Joint Memorial to
call for.
the legislative executive and
judicial branches to convene a
task force to study employee
classification of compensation
systems and budget practices
across all branches of state
government.
Can you imagine being as radical
as that actually trying to
figure out whether we need to
reinvent our personal
reimbursement system.
And the Legislative Council
Service to commission a
government wide study.
Employee classifications
compensation systems the task
force will report its findings
and recommendations to the
legislative executive and
judicial branches by December
first of twenty twenty four like
us
is years in the making.
Two year study.
Including a mechanism requiring
regular updating classifications
officers.
Thank god here in support of
this bill.
But I saw some of the.
The.
An online we.
And killer.
There.
Yes we can hear
you.
Chair members writing.
The.
I want to bring.
And you're going.
Everyone for.
The.
Your.
Public
hearing working.
Department.
Where we need.
Did.
Right.
For
memorial.
Thank you so much for your time
and your support.
Thank you miss Keller anybody
else in the audience were to
speak in support of or against
the bill members of the
committee.
Senator again.
Thank you Mr and.
I guess two of the center I go
to for question Mr is I'm just
trying to understand why we're
having to have the study where
it is I look at it is they come
to this is legislative body for
increase in this budget is not
given the allocation planning to
go into the internet there are
Mr I think I think the issue
here is that over the last
several years we've attempted to
find out why there's such hi
they can see rates and to apply
is becoming more and more
difficult to attract.
State employees and the
conclusion is that
we're just not keeping up and so
to rely on the departments who
are under some pressure from the
executive to hold down spending
to ask for positions they still
have to go to the state
personnel office to get approved
and so it's it's the the the the
problem seems to be focusing on
the personnel office and and
whether they can figure out a
way to constantly update those
pay bands and and make and make
sure that we have in the job
when when they're vacancy rates
at agencies like CYFD or the the
health department for they can
attract the prison guards.
Over and over again we keep
bumping into that so that's kind
of the idea to have a task force
to work with the personnel
office to figure out how we can
get this maintains our ongoing
basis those payments could get
good keep up with the market
well their games Jr I I just
figured with the amount of money
that would.
For spending this year thanks to
all guests.
Result in that but all of which
you have the well yes but we'll
be but we've done the last
couple years given races with
given raises in the but that
doesn't change the fact that the
positions may not be competitive
with with because what we're
getting five and six percent
raises the market place first of
all places gonna more than that
but then the market places going
up even more because everybody's
fighting hard to attract
attorneys and social workers and
nurses and all the teachers and
all the rest of it makes it very
hard so I think that's that's
the idea behind is yes I then
they come back with the
recommendations if we need to
change personnel laws we can do
that.
Thank you Senator taking up yes
thank you yeah this this really
isn't so much I mean it is about
salaries of question
were and I I'm just gonna be
blunt this is one of the most
shocking thing Senator found out
about state government this job
and I often use a comparison
that was.
This is an eight track tape
system that we've been running
year after year.
The having run businesses I've
I've managed up to eight
thousand people in different
businesses and and I've been in
corporations with many more than
that
Our process is our whole
approach are are banding of
individuals.
Is this basically in nineteen
eighties style and it continues
and what happens is it it's so
it's so dysfunctional they can't
even get an approval moving from
one department to another so
they provide a candidate who's
who actually wants to work for
their crappy salaries that we
offer and then you know god
bless and but then they go
through three or four months of
approvals here there and
elsewhere system totally
antiquated system number two
while they have P. eight PM
please systems the.
From counseling and so forth
they don't really have what is a
modern way be able to share than
place you need to get counseling
it is just personal counseling
it's also training and how do
you deal with the difficult
superior how do you deal with a
difficult subordinate how do you
actually come a team player in
the process I mean it's just
it's modern person practices
that we are woefully out of date
with and
no I I I I had a chance to speak
to this in the finance committee
and that we're what we do here
is we invent square results in
New Mexico and and this one is
trying to our
that's and
in my my fear is we're gonna
look for a up for an act against
it but we.
And what we really need to do is
make you can document all the
strong enemy and that should
take about a month I mean
because so many people now then
they need to bring in some of
the H. R. consultant people and
what is done in twenty twenties
any large organization and
should just be it's the state
and so my hope is and and I
expresses them don't take what's
appropriate and try to put it
back together triangles and the
gun.
Go and find that we are.
It's perfected.
Some other states concerning
also large corporations who are
you know large corporations know
that the only way they succeed
is what you have just capital to
start and supportive that that
most important and to do it any
enterprise we NMFA you know this
is what is the people who work
there and how they feel about
themselves how they feel about
their jobs New York in state we
say well no one really cares
about compensation number that's
a myth we are here I mean maybe
what we're starting out but once
you get kids when you start
looking at college tuition once
you start looking at paying back
school loans for people for
coming up we've got to compete
with the private sector so I'm
sorry to go on and on about this
and I'll be fired from around
most of the races thanks I am
absolutely passionate I mean
I've I've been in business for
sensually forty years as a
manager in most of is the CEO.
And the most important person I
learned in my first the CEO job
at Loftus the person I four two
incidences the most important
person on your team is your H.
R..
And job I went to about four
people I found the right H. R.
director and that person made
all the difference in the
organization the morale and the
morale is up in again.
Love the scent they had to not
only make money there also is a
leader and care management and.
Delivery care upstream
preventing bad things happening
seeing a lot of work downstream
but to get everyone around that
concept and energized around
that concept that's what a great
HR department us our HR doesn't
even think about that they just
think about all can I maybe in
three or four months get this
form moved from one place to
another so I really hope in this
study and I will refer people
back to the state that they look
at a modern system and don't get
bogged down by people who like
it the way it is because it's
always been that way or people
who say New Mexico is a second
rate state solution this pace
rate salaries and that that is a
major problem that that we have
so that I'm I said my piece Mr
chair but if we really want to
fix our problems we have to
attract the best and brightest
people to the state and retain
and get him on board fast and
and compensated and investable
make them feel really good about
what they're doing and there are
lots of page our practices and
culture that can be built that
we'll do that force thank you
one little example of from the
actual memorial three through
it's got some pretty good
examples of precisely what
you're talking about but just
one thing they say for us job
classifications in the state
have resulted in an inflated
system of more than one thousand
two hundred different positions
each of which are unique and you
can't move freely along that
we've we've we've just created a
real.
That provides system that just
cannot change the so this is I
think very important I've got
City locus and then tell thank
you Mr chair I was on the
governor's transition team for
slow and one of the things that
happened during the last
administration was an attempt to
centralized so because they have
this problem of all these
different H. ours in all the
different agencies and
inconsistent what happens when
they try to socialize those most
of the employees quit because
they didn't want to leave their
agency and work in Santa Fe
incentivized Office which
devastated the agency and so so
is one of the first ones to
suffer from lack of continuity
lack of and then they themselves
the nature direction from
different agencies have
different is a different it was
such and such a mess but I think
the city is
way we do and I'm happy to still
right.
And senator tone thank you
should as of the real brief I
just want to.
To echo in wholeheartedly
support and I agree with what
you and Dr Hickey said about the
importance of of.
H. R..
Dr if you are muted form of
organization eight thousand
people on the largest
organization I or manager at
seven hundred fifty people and
has a
The person director whose
employees because of the anti
personal director.
They said to get rid of him.
because it's such an important
and I've seen a lot of studies.
Management.
Say that the manager of an
organisation Spence fifty
percent this time person on
board wasn't I didn't for a
while I did keep track of how
much time I spent with personal
issues resources it is close to
fifty percent that's how
important it is and activity of
the excellent analogy that we
have a Traxxas.
Some people might say we have a
crystal crystal radius.
It's it's it's it's it's it's
gone should be corrected decades
ago and it's a four wheel system
it's it's Kommersant slacks
there's a lack of clarity and
kids the.
Long overdue.
The the the new system also best
practices also tells issued you
should redo or we think your
classification system every five
to ten years hello this is David
but.
And thank you for giving me
opportunity.
Which one are you here for just
did you want to say anything
about the advisor chair members
of the committee.
Mexico has originally were just
standing very strong support of

click to set up there to.
And then go ahead and put it on
D. Wonda folder.
I.
Schools.
Right.
Yep do.
The if I'm just going to read
the thing off of our grid just
for the soon as the Senate
memorial thirty seven requests
in Mexico collision of sexual
assault programs.
To convene a task force to make
recommendations for policy and
legislative changes to improve
local county state and federal
jails and detention.
And correctional facilities
compliance with the federal.
Prison rape elimination act two
thousand three.
And there to make a report to
the court's ability to improve
the.
To improve.
Reports recommendations for
policy legislative changes to
improve.
To the Legislative Health and
Human Services Committee hearing
Canadian dealers courts
corrections and justice issues
and the growing victims
reparation commission by
November this year.
So did you want to explain why
we're what we need to do this
yes Mr chair thank you my name
is Alexandria Taylor and
executive director of the New
Mexico coalition of sexual
assault program thank you for
introducing that we are
introducing this memorial to
study the issue of the prison
rape elimination act of two
thousand and three to determine
if there are any additional
measures that should be taken in
introducing any state
legislation to improve or
enhance the federal protections
as the chairs that the prison
rape elimination act of two
thousand and three with the
first federal law implemented to
specifically to Turkey sexual
assault against people who are
currently in cost encrusted
rated I also just wanted to know
very briefly that just recently
in February of twenty twenty
three.
The department of justice
released a study that showed how
few consequences are actually
held accountable for sexual
violence within incarceration
facilities and that only thirty
percent thirty six percent of
those who reported resulted in a
survivor being provided
counseling services which is
part of the federal preempt
redelineation Act and only forty
percent receives medical
treatment Mr chair I wanted to
correct myself the rules I told
you that only three percent
expects the infants and report
it was thirteen percent that was
resulted in a substantiate
substantiated and charges of so
we don't know what the
disposition so all we have a
substantiation data we wouldn't
know if those ended up in
charges or terminations or
disciplinary action just the
report says thirteen percent or
a total of fifteen resulted in a
substantiation and that was out
of a hundred.
Hundred nine cases where
somebody and and those of the
reported incidents also reported
which may be a fraction of the
total actual results that's
correct Mr chair and this also
mentioned that this task force
this memorial is being proposed
because two years ago there was
an interest and a bill drafted
to implement a state pre-filled
Mexico coalition special order
programs has worked for the past
ten years our number is in every
facility in the state ring star
right crisis centers the hotline
and someone is seeking
confidential support after a
sexual assault on the ACLU of
New Mexico is you know works on
these cases as well we didn't
feel that that proposed
legislation was actually going
to provide meaningful
protections and potentially
might create more harm so we
want to intentionally in meeting
police study if there is
legislation that should be
brought before the body before
that happens.
Is there anybody here in the
audience who wants it to put did
you want to add anything Mr
Chairman your comments questions
is there anybody in the audience
was to speak in support of this
bill.
Or in opposition to this bill
and nobody answered okay members
of the committee of the due
process.
We have a motion from Senator
Sedillo Lopez seconded by
Senator Hickey any discussion.
Secretary will call the roll
Senator.
Yes Senator Hickey yes
Center Maestas Senator McKenna
yes synergies Senator Sedillo
Lopez yes senator Clemente yes
Senator is it enough yes.
Congratulations you have a to
pass on a six zero got the
folders you can return.
Okay
Who's here for the brain
injuries is somebody here okay
good let's do that next month up
and and who was there somebody
who's gonna be my expert witness
owner presented from here.
This is a memorial thirty health
coverage for brain injuries.
And this of oil calls for the
governor's commission on
disability to conduct a study
that evaluates the feasibility
of providing health coverage to
all brain injury patients and
the feasibility of establishing
a brain injury registry that
tracks range recent testing
across New Mexico
and just to make a report to the
task force to make a report for
the commission would make a
report to the Legislative Health
and Human Services Committee.
And the LESC by November.
So I'll turn it over to my
experts with this who is.
I felt marble.
Mr Chairman is the committee
market that we I think that is
also here today on this one as
the next great so I'll speak
briefly and then I hope you can
hear from him yes
Our food drive.
Okay good morning my name is not
found table and this is because
social worker I'm a currently
services will definitely need to
be aligned Mexico also
temporarily as it's into that
interim executive director I
also in private practice serving
adults with brain injury and my
secretary practice I've been
working in the brain injury
community this is my eleventh
year and what we find is that
there do not have sort of that
comprehensive continuum of care
people who are very very
disabled they get on the waiver
that provides them certain
services
Other people who maybe don't
have Medicaid can get some care
from through the brain injury
services Fund but there is a
vast vast probably majority of
people do not qualify for any of
those programs and we provide a
couple of major problems one is
our health care force is not
well educated above the knee
injury so even people's primary
care physicians do not feel
confident to for for them for
physical therapy occupational
therapy speech therapy I've
heard people getting responses
like of what you need after the
stuff there before you're not
going to be working or why do
need speech therapy you can top
when speech therapy is one of
the main yes because of
cognitive rehabilitation after
brain surgery so people aren't
necessarily getting services
that they are qualified to get
but we also think even if they
can get those services it might
be one to three hours a week for
a few weeks and we need to serve
more on going care it is a three
to five years sometimes less is
more in general kind of a three
to five year rehabilitation
program for many people with
brain injuries so they can
return to the workforce so they
can return to adequately
volunteering going to school and
that sort of thing so we're
looking for the governor's
commission on disability to do
some research into ways that we
can you know sort of expand
services for people living with
brain injury who are kind of
falling through the cracks right
now and with that said I'd like
to turn it over to doctor ready
if he is available on.
Right here you there.
To the new
it is time can you are muted yes
go this.

Thank you very much now is there
anyone else in the audience here
who wants to speak on this bill.
Yes.
Go ahead hello.
Sure that this figure judges
speak about project I couldn't
hear what they were saying so
thank you.
All.
Thank you Mr chairman and
members of the committee affects
Representative disability
coalition.
This is my fourth.
All but we stand in support of
this memorial brain injury is
one of those invisible
disabilities that tend to be
therefore less well identified
less well understood in the
healthcare profession as well as
the broader society and there
are gaps in access to care and
gaps in the services available
office of that exists both on
the commercial insurance side
and the Medicaid side to all
well you over the service chair
because you've been around a lot
of and the other members of the
committee may not be on site to
set up a waiver program in
Medicaid for people with Rangers
and that was ultimately
successful it was part of the
disabled elderly one request a
separate Medicaid waiver but
with the advent of centennial
Care that disappear so we no
longer have that people who are
already on that program have
been grandfathered in through
centennial Care but new people
coming in are frequently denied
access because they don't meet
the criteria the current
assessment processes so that
helps the people who are already
on but it doesn't help all those
people who are coming up so we
really need to look at this and
make sure that the services are
available and accessible that
people can actually get the the
particular services that people
find your site we purchase part
of this bill and it would be
fair to say you would your
organization will be actively
involved in this task force if
I.
Well the governor's commission
We support you if you have
across the.
Your program right.
I.
Come back to us if you were
developed prostate right.
Our illustrious.
Nero our departures to really is
knowledge of our framework
really happy but what workers so
so you were able to get social
security disability for a brain
injury.
Right but they they told me if I
I prostate cancer was.
Our bills but because of I have
a TV are over the last two more
for and what she said to is.
but especially the normal again
because I don't look at your.
more of.
The brain is soft so.
A lot of issues well actually
that are happened boxes.
Thank you Sir you could you
identify yourself.
Our records could you identify
yourself and.
Need to do things thank you
somebody else did Jim Jackson
yes Jim Johnson for disability
rights New Mexico I want to
prolong this I'll just say we
support this as well.
Good thanks yes ma'am acted
sister I also have a brain
injury
I was told by the neuro
psychologist and I was speaking
in.
I was told my inner only just
here in Santa Fe that I have to
mention not to worry.
I want to drive house office and
dealt with frontal lobe injury
emotional control Jeez physical
disabilities.
When my brother thank you did
that our was completely
paralyzed.
For six weeks they wanted to put
it just a practice manager
nursing home.
Skilled nursing homes or feeding
to they didn't think you would
make it dispensing Dr house
since November he can walk you
talk the listings can function.
The debate when I had a head
injury said us numerologist we
can diagnose but we have no idea
what to do about injuries neural
acupuncture knows what to do.
I've watched people came in with
strokes or head injuries going
from being in wheelchairs to
walking out my brother's first
session he walked in on a
Walker.
After how treated M. to map in
the front room and he walked
back into the treatment room
without.
We can help people if we do.
Western medicine doesn't believe
in they need to do the research.
Thank you very much okay let's
go to the committee so what I
would just throw in one of the
things and so I'm filling in
this is my and my more.
One of the problems is that
Medicaid has a has a list of
services that it provides and
many of the services that the
people with brain injury rig
would would benefit from our
included under the Medicaid lace
and so we do need to to to have
this task force take a look at.
Whether a special waiver might
be the way to go or whether you
know some branch of state
government as develop that
whatever the solution is we need
to find ways to have the right
services that would respond the
the effective in the treatment
of brain injury provide so let's
go to the committee Dr Hickey
Senator.
Dr this
One of the areas that I happen
to love story something about I
I have one question first of the
experts and
in terms of speech therapy
occupational therapy sure and
and and other therapies can be
very helpful of do you commute
do you work at all with stroke
patience is WAF and that because
that
you know the human brain is the
closest football movie about the
guy Pittsburgh and so forth you
know we were never meant to
knock our head around and
you know we're not woodpeckers
it's amazing you know
woodpeckers they have they have
a the phone is just I mean the
brain cannot move at all inside
there is there any reason so
with and that's why they can do
what they do we we are not like
that so certainly has since when
have you Connell now it's going
to become a spokesperson for you
all this is the.
We do have a yeah he found
interesting question it was
severe enough that they put in
an observation a few days and
did you see the same time
everything which if they have to
bring it but what what I wanted
to point out is that I had the
opportunity to spend that a six
but long time not a long time a
week or so it the Tronto
neuroscience and to and they're
probably the leading
neuroscience and the
Certainly the western hemisphere
and it's amazing what they're
finding out that it before the
stroke patients being here Dr
that's why mostly deal with that
do trauma firsts per se but you
know we after stroke of static
okay this just says some of them
it's gonna take a couple weeks
and then we'll see where we need
to focus of therapy what what
they have discovered is that
it's kind of surgery no the day
after you get amount that you
get the I'm working it's amazing
how the brain can is an area in
a stroke say if you lose your
right arm near that times on the
opposite side there is brain
functions from the apps side but
it's amazing how that left arm
rain area will grow and take
over some of that function or
how some other areas of rain is
not being used very much can be
recruited.
yeah and and meditation and and
be aware this top medical
schools that you're born with
brain cells yeah and then you
just right away over time
during.
There is no your own genesis is
amazing and so
this is an area where again I I
think we were dealing with eight
tracks not to
be redundant but I mean in terms
of our thinking and our therapy
and again I don't know so much
about dramatic but I do know in
and and and medical
that.
Progress that with that the
ability to make progress in
particular in terms of their
fees to there was no chance is
very important and so we need to
remove that eight track thank
you and wherever it's and
stealth and bring more modern
thinking and experimentation
that's going on is we ability
people.
speech function and so I I just
the the that this is very
important and important because
you can do the commission but
despondent fears does fall on
someone with an eight track
player you know we need to get
them up to date with why I this
so I hope that you've got a
strategy together learn to get
information to the people take
seventeen years for for a new
approach in medical therapy
eventually work its way through.
I could go on and on about an
eight in early could stop all
heart disease today we know how
to do a simple but you know what
it's gonna take another ten to
twelve years before we get
people doing this was to happen
there so I don't want to see
this happen here yes I can
Senate will talk a long time but
I just really wanted the courage
to take your I.
And broadened and not just in
person New Mexico broadened to
the medical community there is
hope where before we kind of
gave a final step so thank you
good thank you doctor Senator
anybody else.
The defense with motion for it
to pass some Senator Sedillo
Lopez seconded by Senator
McKenna I want to throw Lessing
Evans trying to remember the
name of the author but I just
recently listened to a marvelous
book on disk
I think the name of it is a
hundred names for love about of
a
and she's well known author her
husband was also well known
author
he had a stroke.
And it's the story of his
rehabilitation and of what it
took but it but what what I
heard you saying about speech
there I mean just talking to him
constantly in the they were they
stumbled on a on a housekeeper
who would come in and just chat
away all day long to choose one
of those people just like to.
You know that any and everything
she ended it didn't matter that
he didn't respond much at first
but.
They credited Sheet� the author
credits this housekeeper and her
constant but stimulation of her
husband's brain with making huge
river the incident Rosen and
very rapid recovery so that he
ultimately began writing novels
again it was and the doctors
that you know you have to be
prepared to deal payment linger
for a few months that this is
going to take you from here and
he said if he did die two years
later but of heart trouble or
something else it was to get by
city bus I think either of them
something else got in the but
one of us from.
That we were okay so we have a
motion for a few tests and
secretary will call the roll
Senator Harris yes ma'am Senator
Hickey yes Senator Ingle
also amassed Senator McKenna yes
Senators metes Senator Sedillo
Lopez yes explained.
Senator AUMENT this is if you
know yes thanks senators of the
lowest explainable I just want
to give a shout out to my
constituent marked lack of the
druggies who has worked on this
for a long time into thank all
for work and this is really.
Yes thank you all for coming and
speaking in support of this and
as it turns out we now have
another bill that you're
interested in Senator o'neill's
Bill Senate memorials this is
the fifty two acupuncture study
acupuncture for neurological
issues.
Your small room to the this is
like the old days.
So thank you Mr chair members
Senate Bill Senator more fifty
two request and in the office
too Department of Health you age
in their acupuncture services
Saturday that's a giant step
study of health effects of
excess of acupuncture and neuro
acupuncture which is why we're
here today in the treatment of a
variety of neurological
disorders restructures
your expenses that master
automatic range the offices of
Parkinson's Alzheimer's disease
so
This is a I'm here today with
doctor how who's already been
mentioned is quite the felon
people come from all over the
world honestly to table that has
of neurological acupuncture
treatment
It's and then the state of
commissioner Justin requests on
the board of as well the office
of so just and did you want to
talk.
thank you Committee members Mr
chair and thank you to the
sponsor first off it is really
an honor to this is the first
time I've gotten to present
anything before your committee
but that as many times that you
write and so this is an honor to
be part of your committee for
over a decade but the first time
to actually get the committee at
present something so thank you
very much
so the direct picture institute
founded about seven years ago to
work on a study deeper
understanding of what neural
acupuncture can do and so as the
Morissette in this this
treatment the doctor how are
chasing hearing his wife Linda
how have created is a fusion of
western or ology where we've
made great strides in the last
fifty years and with the Eastern
Europe acupuncture and oriental
medicine that fusion it is the
magic that is that is come from
this and
a from work I've as somebody's
mentioned earlier I've been in
I've witnessed people be wheeled
in a wheelchair after stroke and
walk out of this and so one of
the things that I tell people
god forbid not problem with that
you ever need this bus thank god
it is available if you do so
the the opportunity here before
this in this memorial is for our
institution here to to work with
the department of health and the
U. N. M. operating in behavioral
health Institute and any other
group that you just hospitals or
institutions we'd be happy to
work with them to further
understand this but the impact
would be both on the patients
but also for the state of New
Mexico this is the fact is
people who are bedridden in
wheel chairs unable to take care
of themselves get so much relief
and our ability of restored to
that the cost of the burden of
care that the state has could
be.
Right the reduced and so part of
this should be the study should
be how we can reduce the cost of
the state of New Mexico I find
this into our us we do things
here Dr house with us we have a
bunch of patients are we've seen
doctor how years I will keep
this as short as humanly
possible but I would like guys

the audience and that all of
those of you who would like to
show support would would stand
up or or wait a raise your hand
the state right here and and
then we'll take up will take
comments from two or three what
we start with you ma'am you you
step forward yeah my name is sue
Randall I'm the registered nurse
have a master's degree and
hospice nurse and doctor.
Seven or eight years ago I was
injured I patients and ended up
during the after my arthroscopy.
Hello twenty regional pain
Center.
The next three years the doctors
just kept trucking and trucking
in the paying took over to my
body I couldn't get out of that
and I couldn't work anymore you
can disable and kept trying to
find a way out of it and after I
moved to Cleveland Clinic the
top clinic I was told the
specialist that might be able to
help me get out of this mess I
thought he was in and he says to
you've been through everything
you're on every drive we could
possibly put you on all that's
left to do is to put and then
what enter the coupon to infuse
more fame for the rest of my
time.
And
Still it Terry I'm hospice
Representative I know that we
don't ever do that to a patient
hello it's the very last option
because it takes away their
cognition and quality of life
but I heard what the doctors are
telling me is this is it and
this is your quality of life and
it's only gonna get worse if you
could only get more dropped and
I was already on every drug
possible and so at that point
when I left the clinic I said
okay.
I realize and western medicine
I've been to every specialists
nobody can help me I want my
life back not to say on drugs so
I decided to try alternative
medicine and I tried anything
and everything anyone suggested
and televised sound drive how
nothing works I still in
excruciating pain and trucks
when I found out there house
she's said to me at fountain to
someone who are in peril as your
husband and paralyze and the
reverse for Alice's and he was
back running marathons so I was
like okay that's why single day
at least four times and I found
Dr how and he began to get my
pain down and down and down and
my life to mobility basket and
my whole quality of life back to
work now I think I've stated my
GP to I and I couldn't move I
was on state tell those I
couldn't move my leg my husband
could tell you I was just
screaming at nine payment on
drugs
and what I found while getting
my own feeling is watching kids
with autism and five or seven
treatments come back to life
speak have their families back
everyone benefits when you're in
a world where some.
I know as a nurse with a
master's degree that there's not
much we have it set jobs and
western medicine and that's
where I really hope we can look
at this because I know how much
research helps to validate
things that you can go to this
office and see all these novels
happening I has that relies
Dynasty is a go with Alzheimer's
and was Mr because we could get
help he was really severely all
I miss the call centers and
we're like oh now this is a good
chance that the clinic we look
at still is in the hospital
financing when I'm in nursing
mother died.
Call centers and other things
but I knew it wasn't so that and
about six months into COVID
where he was supposed to be
crocheting.
And that doing things to prepare
to be home and I was trying to
prepare myself for that life
that all those and I I Dr have
called him and said have you
ever worked with Sanders
appeared chance to do spring and
he's.
First and he started treating my
husband and after several
treatments he was back Senator
Steinborn sorted connect two
plus two we can sell for he
could function and
And he is now he went back to
hungry last summer after getting
treated by doctor how to treat
again he's taught at the Art
Institute intensity and hungry
for the International Center for
forty years thank you anyway
that's all that's all say is
that you can do more.
So this is a doctor who can the
program to stroke come with a
one stroke they just talk so
wanted to talk to your who are
you trying to think about what
thank you that was two okay a
few minutes left yes please.
Chairman members of the
committee and all that is my
name is Theresa by this is my
chips sorry it yes years ago and
large in it was it was really
to that states have.
He can see everything.
I was able to speak.
The only of to look at yeah move
your the company's current that
was one the very first treatment
hi I hello.
To the.
Dance.
And.
Recent I've and so emotional
about it is because he was under
so much medication there was
like seven of high blood
pressure pills okay and all he
was was was our when you get up
I have to portion to get a key
he wasn't eating he went from
two hundred thirty six pounds
down to a hundred and seventy
two pounds in a matter of
probably well it was a matter of
seconds sixty two days.
And so would emergency
legislation dropped and I took
him to the emergency room of the
hospital and they couldn't they
said will you know the pressure
drops through going to do.
Is that he's with with several
session medicines I said here's
the Bob's I took and I took the
bag to Calder thank goodness
there was an associate of doctor
health in the emergency room as
doctors in the two rooms at get
your appointment later we were
able to get into Dr house and
this is my husband today you can
walk you can talk he goes with
me on my appointments for in
real state of he takes care of
family to take care of our
animals home indicating to visit
with you today to show you play
a stroke we could big Jim it can
deal with acupuncture was for
the fairly well off in the in
the car could needs couldn't
talk had a hard time.
Every one thank you Mr.
Okay is there anybody on the
zoom.
Or members of the committee.
We have a motion for due process
seconded by Senator Hickey any
discussion of yes I
Read things that you learn about
me in caucuses days took me five
years to get through high school
tune and grace but also took me
five years to get through
medical school because my last
year I received a fellowship to
study alternative medicine
around the world and was in the
dock and that the policy in
Micronesia and actually so I
ended up here is I
Part of the fellowship was
working with the medicine man
around okay and Arizona which is
for I work for seven ended up
working for seven years and
again with so hired.
We have this allopathic medicine
in this country which is is
based on physiology and it's
amazing and and pharmco I mean
some incredible drugs are doing
things today but because we have
that such a strong culture there
we don't really appreciate asset
levels on average CEO I started
the first Department of
alternative medicine there and
I myself to fusions and like
that and I did Michael said
Michael micro electric therapy
and also micro acupuncture prior
to and eventually having to
search it but talked a lot and
and so the the thing that we we
we hear these anecdotes and but
it's critically important
particularly for my colleagues
to understand is that we do
sisig what you're proposing here
and I know and I H. I.
representative review panels for
and I grants for about seven
years back in the day and they
are opening up Morrison just
allopathic approaches to issues
and again and and we know so
little about the brains have so
little about the.
and I'm hoping that we spend
credible amount of money
discovering it it's kind of like
we go to that we go to the moon
right at that we have no idea
what's going on in the oceans of
the world we just ignored it and
so that's kind of a simple
example so once again I'm sorry
all these medical things just
happen to.
Move with my experience and I I
I do speak with university a lot
I know they have a great
neurology department very strong
General surgeon portion we took
a tumble a few years ago but
it's building back up but they
have a very strong riles
research department but getting
more into those areas and I
think doctors it down this is
the kind of individual very
receptive to that.
The leader he's a psychologist
addiction knowledges he knows
out how important the mind is to
serve the state around various
bills so I think that the answer
to carry on here but the
frustration is that
getting my college to understand
swarming the building today
medical malpractice but you know
over time evidence and so forth
leadership.
As well as the leadership of
what you're doing I think we'll
we'll could and and particularly
with what goes after and Santa
Fe and also different approaches
to care I would just love to see
that merch more and I really
applaud.
Fell Senator this forward and
understanding of but I will also
tell you to make change in
medicine just tap.
At the thank thank.
Thank you senator and and and
All of I think this is really
important step I I love the fact
that he's working with L. timers
with autism with for yeah with
the the the the scope of of of
of.
Problems that people are
experiencing that this could be
a real health for is is just
really encouraging so let's see
with this of the graph sounds
secretary will call the roll
Senator yes ma'am Senator Hickey
yes Senator center my access
Senator McKenna yes Senators
meetings Senator Sedillo Lopez
yes Senator Tallman yes Senator
Ortiz Y. Pino yes.
Congratulations sanity of a do
pass on the sixties of zero
vote.
Your nose if you are you over
there healthy and the chair of
the funds hello.
The current year.
So.
Members are less bill is money
Senate bill five hundred.
So I would move that do not fast
Senate Bill I.
Into.
Sure and to do this thank you
doctor.
To do just for Senate.
Public health and public affairs
committee substitute Senate
Bill.
This will be very familiar to
you because saying bill like
tried last year.
Unfortunately forgot about it.
Was on my to do list.
So I had to use one of my
emergency bills.
It may be too late but I wanted
to leave it in New York keep the
the idea of fresh this is a
bill.
That sets up registries.
For organ donors.
In the.
In the various licensing
departments the motor vehicle
department of.
They would separate the central
registry for the ten whenever
you applied to renew your
license as a.
Of concealed handgun carrier as
a for the next one.
As a of.
The motor vehicle okay.
Then as a
anatomical this is the uniform
licensing act any of those state
licensing programs they would
always have on the form a box to
check.
And that box would be sent to
the the information that box
that you're willing to be a
donor would be sent to the motor
vehicle department and that
would be part of the central
street that's all the bill does
and it's an attempted getting
more people to be aware of organ
donation of the fact that it is
because who think about it until
you have the opportunity to
answer questions that's the
whole idea behind that is
that'll stand for questions.
And the password to.
I have
those bills or the just stepping
out that.
Thank.
For.
I think it's a good idea.
Yeah that happens is it is
common sense.
I governor number of people as I
said last year the governor's
veto for some reason so I
thought that.
Was it to reach the burden on
track that down maybe enrollment
member is this fall Lester's
version of this bill if I with
that of.
This.
So what we're gonna do
Syrian center.
Act of.
This.
All.
Thank you for this.
Schlegel local folk here.
Employment and director of item
for.
Of Sharon for these share those.
Okay okay so we have a a of just
explaining that my bill is a
five hundred is it it's a
emergency bill Bennett's for
that's a repeat of a bill that I
introduced last year an organ
donor registry bill so whatever
you fill out of license for any
of the state licenses they would
ask you if you like to be
considered to be an organ donor
just to try to promote the idea
and also to get the central
registry that people can then
follow up with this not just
drivers licenses are not just
our any of the licenses to
action permits any of the
licenses from the RLD from the
occupational therapy act from
the pharmacy act whenever you're
renewing any respiratory Care
Act
massage therapy practice act
whatever your reads the implied
for license or be a little
paragraph would you consider
being an organ donor.
Initially doing it more than
once.
If you are you done with this
well it comes central registry
and so however many times you
have it your name is already at
least once and then and then I
my assumption is that somebody
follows up and says I notice you
the.
offered to have your organs if
you're in a condition in which
that would be possible your
organs donated and we would just
like to give you this
information how you can make
sure it happens this is really
valuable.
I mean right now you're right I
mean centers on my license
I if there would be a registry
chair of the emergency rules
where yeah.
Posted could donate all these
that good or donate
yep they'll have another
registry there K. otherwise it
this check the driver's license
that there.
Family this is their families
well where.
I'm here to serve you brought us
and.
This pathway the signed up for
that.
Willingdon because sometimes on
family members.
Not a great time an emergency
road your loved one just been
learn more about our past way
people don't necessarily very
rational at this time but
knowing that Representative
streets yes that the individual
that this is this will
that they want to do it so
that's for the bad guys Mr chair
the session question for law but
the so when my mother went to
hospice she's home are we in
she was done she passes.
Were approaches on the invasion
building because I can't I'm
just wondering why.
She's in good health for the
cancer.
And I'm just wondering why no
work or make sure that there's
registry out of well we're
approached by officers rating
one hundred the
And
and and and some of the more
rural areas of the bills the
ability to harvest.
In a timely manner could be an
issue in other words getting out
and organ harvester.
Surgeon to the point where or
getting the body I mean that
there's potentially the expense
your insurance isn't going to
cover the flight of the body up
to
about Albuquerque for for the
harvesting
secondly and and now I'm I'm I'm
way out of date I helped bring a
liver transplant program to you
and and which probably wasn't a
good idea so often because it's
never could do enough of that
you do you do want to have the
individual to be in relatively
good health and as you said and
I don't know what kind of cancer
it is kind of cancer they could
metastasize for preferentially
to the the kidneys and so forth
heart's you definitely want
younger people as a director so
That is that this is my attempt
to answer your question
Representative in just a okay
have you.
To grow the bindle I don't
receive anything out of my
mother's always gotten Christmas
colors don't so they look at it
as an opportunity thank you
connection I didn't.
It's always.
So that.
I've got drug lists of the
internet on that point the
declined my father's kidneys
content cancer cancer that in
that sense metastasize into
twins the decline.
They could have been that they
just never product discussion
even though we told.
Hello and I just I just thought
about it too ma'am for actually
issue this is why what if we get
caught and and she was in
hospice correct yes.
no it is I I I.
Actually in the of I go back to
that hospice organization that
might need because I think
knowing.
Was it because she had cancer
was a certain sort of that that
that has a high prevalence of
kidney metastasis anyway just it
is interesting to note kind help
this registry and and a half
hour forty four because we don't
have enough for so you have
noticed we need.
We'll try it and I do need to
correct it was going to go
through the door of the to just
never got a house taxed to his
business.
After we heard what to tax
businesses thirty day session.
So so we will if if it doesn't
get through this year we will
keep trying until we get through
was it on the call.
This I think we got a I think we
did get but maybe late it may
have been like that we got a who
would to a message.
And if if if it does get to the
issue of the work that goes into
a message really try to get it
done.

pass in the second.
