Pinto, Senator Scott.
And Serio Lopez.
Senator Hickey.
Senator Lopez
Present.
Right, we now have an
established decorum.
And I do appreciate everybody
wearing a mask, um, I've had
health issues and I'm still
immunocompromised, so thank you
very much for your
consideration.
So Senator Ramos, is Senator
Woods going to join you or is
he? No, ma'am, he's in another
committee.
Um, if you try to present your
bill, please, uh, Madam Chair,
committee members, thank you
very much for allowing me to, to
present this bill.
Um
Senate bill 55, what it does,
it, uh, it's the Bill mandates
that insurers pay the
replacement costs less
depreciation upfront with the
remainder paid only upon
completion of repairs or
replacements um a good example
of the of why this is being
brought is, you know, back in uh
the eastern part of the state,
we have a lot of hill claims,
for instance, and what happens
is the insurance company will
pay the consumer up front and
the work never gets.
Stunts, so they'll spend the
money and 5 years later they
have the same claim trying to
recoup the same amount of money.
So we're trying to avoid that
by, by, uh, uh.
Like paying the replacement
costs less depreciation upfront
and then the remainder gets paid
when the project is complete.
And I do have some expert
witnesses. I'd like to let them
go ahead and introduce
themselves.
Madam Chair, senators, I'm
Melissa Robertson. I'm the
property and casualty bureau
chief at OSI.
Madam Senator Elizabeth Johnson,
um, associate general counsel at
the Superintendent.
Did you wish to add anything
else to the presentation?
Madam Cherry
As Senator Ramos pointed out,
and in doing this.
Doing this process, what happens
is it's actually also driving up
insurance rates. And right now
in our statute.
It says that we have to and
agents have to cover companies
have to cover for replacement
costs, but we do not have a
statute saying how companies
Thank you you.
Senator Ramos, is that all of
your presentation? Yes, ma'am,
that's that's it.
Go ahead and entertain that
question.
OK.
Thank you. Thank you.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
Are you going to questions on
the bill? Yes. Let me go to the
audience first. Oh, I'm sorry.
It's OK. It's all right.
Is there anyone in the audience
in support of Senate Bill 55.
OK, if you'd like to make a few
comments, if you would stand
here.
If you wish to say a few words,
you can also uh speak into the
microphone.
Nobody wishes to?
OK. Is there anyone in
opposition?
See none, is there anyone on?
Nobody? OK.
Thank you and Senator Sidil
Lopez.
Thank you, ma'am.
I'm, I don't know that much
about um insurance, so.
I just, um
All I know is what we buy.
And what we buy is replacement
cost.
That's, that's what we, um, sign
up for, so this bill kind of
bothers me.
Does it displace what's in your
contract?
With the insurance company.
Matt, Madam Chair, um, Senator,
that's a very good question and
it is replacement costs, but
what's happening is, is uh uh
insurance with this bill
insurance companies would pay
the replacement costs minus the
depreation depreciation and at
the end of the project when it's
complete, we'll pay, pay the
rest of that's owed to the
customer to complete the
replacement cost.
But what if, Madam Chair,
But what if I don't have money
to replace it, um, and I need
the insurance money to replace
it. That's why I buy insurance.
And.
Madam Chair, Senator.
Right now, what we've seen
historically is the companies
are working with the
contractors, so as the project
moves forward, and most of the
time if it's a total loss or a
large loss, they will pay the
contractor directly. So as the
work is being completed, those
payments are being made up to
the replacement cost value, and
then just to add on to that
right now we are seeing an
industry on a total loss, they
are actually even depreciating
the actual cash value.
So they're depreciating it even
further than the depreciated
replacement cost.
And this is mandating front.
Of the replacement costs minus
depreciation and then the
remainder is the project goes on
or is completed in the statute
where what you described is
Cause it looks, uh, it doesn't.
In my opinion, it doesn't say
what you just said.
Madam.
Madam Chair, Senator.
And section C, so page 2, line
4.
This is the original where it
says that we must provide
coverage for cost to repair,
replace without depreciation
deduction for depreciation. That
is how the policy must be wrote.
What we've added in is at the
time of the settlement, the
insurer shall pay 100% of the
replacement cost less
depreciation.
And the remainder of the cost to
rebuild or replace shall be paid
upon completion of the rebuild
or replacement in the amount not
to exceed replacement cost or
policy limits.
So, what I understood you, what
I understood you to say was that
um they would work with the
builder and they would, they
would do all that. That's not,
that's not in the book.
Mm
Do you use the microphones right
here in the middle that way.
We can better capture your
voice.
Mm
Madam Chair, and senator, it's
uh, it's my understanding that
that, uh, procedure is actually
not covered in statute, that's
just standard industry practice.
So Madam Chair,
Um
I just, every time I look at
legislation, proposed
legislation, what I look for is
what is the problem we're
solving.
What is the benefit that we're
going to achieve?
And this looks like this is not
a problem.
I, I, I don't, well, I don't
understand the nature of the
problem and the benefit seems to
be to the insurance agency to
not have to pay.
Upfront.
That and, you know, I'm like,
I mean, is the insurance
company, is the insurance
industry in trouble and we need
to help them out or, or why are
we doing this, Madam Chair.
Uh, Madam Chair senator, as I
opened up with my comments, a
lot of what's happening right
now is uh is that if there's a
claim out there, say it's a hell
claim, um, the insurance company
is, is paying out the insurance
claim currently up to
replacement cost.
And when uh
When, when the person receives
the funds, they utilize those
funds to do something else, and
5 years later, they're claiming
the same claim, trying to recoup
more funds on that same claim.
So that that's what should be
avoided now with this type of uh
of a bill now. Madam, I
understand that, but that is
insurance fraud. So when you
told me, when you give that
example, that's illegal now.
Yes, ma'am. That is, that is
insurance, insurance fraud. So I
ask again, what is the problem
that we're trying to solve with
this bill.
If the problem is the industry
doesn't have the money and they
need time to pay it.
OK, that's a problem. If the, if
the problem is, uh,
I don't know. I mean, that's the
only problem that I can see that
we're solving, and for me,
that's not a huge priority
problem unless the industry is
in trouble.
Um, Madam Chair.
Madame Chair and Senator, um,
another issue that we were
seeking to address with this
legislation is we have had some
bad actors in the industry that
um are not taking the
depreciation. They're, they're
actually depreciating the actual
cash value essentially double
depreciating someone's claims,
so we really wanted to hit that
home on a page. I think it's
page.
To lines 9 through 13 to say the
depreciation comes out of the
replacement cost and only out of
the replacement cost.
Um, and I, I
totally understand your
Question because I've grappled
with this a few times too, so,
um, hopefully that helps explain
at least, at least part madam,
insurance coverage provided in
residential property insurance
policies shall, and I always
make students.
provide coverage for the cost to
repair a place without deduction
for depreciation. So if
insurance companies are doing
that, that also is in violation
of the statute.
So Madam Chair, and senator, um,
I've also grappled with this in
the first sentence in subsection
C is talking about the coverage
that they shall provide in the
policy. It's not talking about
the mechanism of how they pay
out a claim, which is where the
new language comes in.
Um, Madam Chair, when I've had
to make an insurance claim, I
get a check.
And that makes me very happy
because then I can, I can.
A for the couch or whatever,
we've had roof damage, we've had
uh
Water damage we've had flood
damage and.
I, I get the check and that
makes me really happy because I
have enough to replace it.
Um
Or
Not get the check up front means
I'm gonna have to find somebody
who's gonna work with me or work
with the insurance company.
Which means that limits the pool
of people that I could.
Um, that I can
Um, shoes to to make the repairs
or to do that and I just, again,
I, I'm still having trouble
finding.
The problem that this is
addressing without putting a
burden on the person who's
paying the pro the
The policy.
And Madame Chair and Senator, I
just want to clarify one point.
It's not that you're not going
to get a check. You're going to
get a check in an amount of
actual cash value in the
remainder later. Exactly, the
remainder upon completion of the
rebuild.
So I'm gonna have to bring the
insurance company over, they're
gonna have to check the, check
the.
A rebuild, which is a lot more
expense on the insurance
company, because they're gonna
have to have to hire people to
come in and inspect it.
Which is that going to cause
higher premiums, Madam Chair and
Senator, the way, um,
replacement cost is structured
now is actually causing higher
premiums because insurance
companies are having to account
for several claims where no
repairs are undertaken, the
asset continues to depreciate
and then later the the insured
files another claim.
For the same thing and and and
this could be a chain of several
events where the insurers never
undertakes a repair.
Madam chair again, that is
insurance fraud.
To file a claim where you've
already received a payment.
Is insurance fraud, so that's
already taken care of by
statute. I don't see that this.
Uh
I mean, if you could explain it
to me, Madam Chair, um, but what
you're describing is insurance
fraud.
Madam Chair and senator, it's
certainly insurance fraud to
file one claim on one excuse me,
multiple claims on one
transaction or in occurrence and
never have it repaired. It is
not insurance fraud to file one
claim, wait 2 years, you never
fixed your roof, your roof
continues to depreciate. Another
natural disaster occurs, you
file another claim you never
intend to repair, which is
What we're seeing.
But the insurance company would
not pay the full amount on the
2nd, on the 2nd check, if you
had never repaired it.
They come out and they look and
they see what was the prior
damage they
I, I again, I'm really
Having
trouble
Figuring out exactly what the,
what this is trying to do. And
for that reason, I, like I said,
our my in my view, our job is
to.
to do that.
Provide a benefit or so solve a
problem.
And what we do has to be
reasonably related to what we're
trying to do.
When you're talking about uh
Possible insurance fraud that
happens that this might
Have to might help, there's not
a connection between what.
The problem that you identify
and what we're trying to do, and
that's just for me, that's like
the basic basic.
Underpinnings of constitutional
law and legislative authority.
And so for that reason, I, I, I
have not been convinced that
this is a a problem.
That this legislate that there's
a taking it or not even tight,
there's not even a reasonable
relationship between what
is the problem. I'm having
trouble figuring out the problem
and what we're, what we're
trying to do here. So for that,
I just.
I, I'm not going to support this
legislation.
Madam Chair, Senator, I.
One thing
And I think
This is something very hard for
a lot of people, but I'll use
Riodoso as an example right now
cause it's fresh on everybody's
minds.
is by doing this also, we have
seen inflation and building
costs and contractor costs go
through the roof.
So essentially, if you were
insured properly to replacement
cost. This is gonna get a check
in your hands immediately, but
it's also gonna account for the
inflation that's coming up to
your policy limit, you know, if
somebody was insured properly or
even a little over insured.
And then this inflation is
building. It's going to assure
that they actually get the full
replacement cost.
They're not going to be left
shortchanged. Madam Chair, I
would see that if it's said
that.
But it doesn't say that.
It says the remainder of the
cost to rebuild the way shall be
paid upon completion of the
rebuild or replacement amount
not to exceed replacement costs
or policy limits.
That's
Prove now
That that that's the, that's
what they're gonna pay.
Now
So it doesn't say that inflate
including inflation.
If that were added.
If, if including inflation in
including
Increased inflate cost, then I
would say, oh well, there's
there's something you're trying
to protect the consumer from
inflation, but it doesn't do
that. It doesn't say that.
Well, and there is another area
within the policy that would,
that would cover it, which
should be an increased dwelling
coverage on your policy, which
is sometimes 125% of the actual
value of your home is, and that
would help out in that portion
on the replacement.
Uh, cost, so, um,
I
Did you want to cover, do you
wanna go ahead and expand on
that?
A little bit
Madam Chair and Senator, on this
increased option, companies do
range anywhere between 10 and
25. I've seen them up to 35%.
Again, that is to assist if the
home was not insured properly or
inflation has stepped in in the
cases that we've seen now with
the recent fires.
Madam chair, but that is
something that you purchase when
you so you're gonna get it if
you purchased it or if, if you
didn't purchase it, you're not
gonna get it.
Madam Chair, some and senator,
some companies automatically
include it and some.
And and then there'd be a charge
for that.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. Senator
Block.
Um, thank you, Ma. I, I, I
thought Senator Gallegos had
something before me if you want.
Senator
You can go first and then we'll
go to your colleague after.
Madam Chair, thank you.
Senator
So I, I'm just trying to go back
and some of the discussions, uh,
when I have a roof repair.
Uh, we get a dollar amount for
the full replacement.
Uh, they will hold.
they'll do the whole job but
anticipation they'll hold until
the job's done for the secondary
payment, I guess what I'm
looking at.
Center is people that say, OK,
let's say it's a $400 repair.
The insurance company cuts me
the.
The check
I buy a jacuzzi
Outside the house and never take
care of the repair.
But then what if I understand my
chair Senator.
Uh, is that in 5 years from now,
whenever the next hailstorm
occurs.
And I refile and that's what you
guys are looking at is how to
keep it right so that I either
Pay for the repair.
As as we go
Or not pocket the money, is that
what I understand, Madam Chair
and Senator?
Yes, you
Yes, sir, that's exactly what
uh.
We're talking about.
A chair and Senator, even when
Uh
Years ago I had a friend of mine
asked me to help him re-roof the
house.
And we did it for free.
But he didn't get
The payment
Until it was checked off by an
inspector.
So there have to be checks and
balances and what I'd look at
this is this is a check and
balance mechanism.
Make sure that I'm not
pocketing.
And then readdressing later.
Is that correct? I'm.
Madam Chan and Senator, that is
100% correct. Now, if they do,
they, they are also um to be
allowed reasonable overhead.
So that is exactly and it's
going to.
In a market of raising.
Well, thank you for that, Madam
chair and and ladies, uh, I
guess in in my purview, whether
you do it on your own.
Or if I play pay a contractor.
Gist of this is to make sure I
either get the job done.
I don't pocket it and I expect
even later, so I will be
standing in support of your bill
because I think that uh at the
end.
Uh, if we take advantage of the
insurance.
Uh, it's gonna be raising our
deductibles later because we're
all in in the same group where
we're trying to protect our
homes and if I shortchange you
as insurance company or in the
contractor.
Uh, it could be that they're
short change the contractor too,
I've known contractors to take
the minimum payment.
In hopes they'd get something
never receive anything else, but
that's just I wanted to clarify,
but I appreciate that.
Madam Chan Senator and gentle
ladies, I appreciate the
dialogue because I see a
problem.
And I understand the need, uh,
being a contractor, I know when
we get stiffed.
It doesn't come off my check.
It comes on old owners equity.
I get paid weekly.
It's the owners that don't get
paid and it's could be the
corporation, could be an
individual insurance agent. It
could be someone is footing the
bill if I take advantage of the
system, so with that I yield.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
Sona Ramos in your private
employment, you're in the
insurance business.
manager.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair. What
Do you mind just kind of just
telling us what what you do in
the insurance business real
quick. Um, I sell property
casualty and health and and uh.
Commercial insurance.
OK, all right.
Thank you, sir. um.
Madam Chair, um.
And then I, I'm sorry, what was
your name?
Melissa
You mentioned something about
bad actors out there.
Is that in New Mexico? Bad actor
insurance companies?
Madam Chair, Senator, yes, our
consumer assistance Bureau has
been.
Overrun with complaints in
regards to bad actors and
companies, yes.
Thank you, Melissa. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Who, who are they?
Um, right now we have the number
one leader in
The nation and in the state,
which is State Farm.
State Farm, OK.
Just wanted to make sure it
wasn't my USAA, so.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Melissa, um, Senator
Ramos or uh Melissa.
Um
If this bill passes,
What, what effects would it have
on the public's premiums, would
they go up or would they go
down, or would they stay the
same?
Uh, I, I, a madam chair of
Senator, that's a good question.
I, I think we'll start seeing
some stabilization, so we'll be,
we'll be seen as consumers,
believe me, I'm, I'm my best
customer.
So I, I totally see where, where
people are coming from.
I mean, my, my rates went up
from $1300 a year, three years
ago to $4800 a year this year as
we speak.
So I definitely feel the same
pain that everyone else is since
it's regulated, we don't get any
special rates, any special
treatment on, on claims, so
that's thank you Senator. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Um, Melissa,
you mentioned uh a safety net
from OSI.
I think that was you, right?
Or was that you?
Someone talked about a safety
net in regards to Senator
Antoinette Cedilla Lopez's
question on, on payments that
there was a safety net from the
state. Did I hear that wrong?
Did anyone else hear that? I
swear I'm, am I the only one
hearing things?
Madam Chair, Senator, I think
that was when we were talking
about the increased dwelling
endorsement. Yep, OK, and
that's, that's something some
companies automatically have
some you can do an endorsement
with
Thank you, Madam Chair. So I
wasn't hearing something. I was
just writing it down trying to
listen.
Um, I
Madam Chair, Senator Ramos, walk
me through this real quick so I
understand it as just a member
of the I'm just a dumb nuclear
weapons expert. So just walk me
through this.
When it comes to insurance.
I got a house.
Real Rancho.
Just say for sake uh big hail
storm comes.
Um
Damages my roof, leaky roof.
Uh, but my home insurance, say
it covers my home insurance, so
just say $11,000 say my house is
worth $1000 we can do the math
easy here.
Um, the damaged roof, let's just
say it's, it's, it's the roof
like $500 right? So,
The, I'm going to get a check
from USAA or some other company.
In regards to the damage.
As I know with USAA.
They will come out and look at
this to prevent fraud, um.
Because they want me buying a
hot tub like yours. Um,
So I, I find a USAA sponsored
contractor is how this process
works for me. I assume it's
pretty normal across insurance
companies.
Contractor comes out, looks at
it, and he said that's gonna
cost you.
$600 right?
So Madam chair, Senator, how,
I'm gonna get a check for $600.
To get that fixed.
Um
Even though
It might say cost of contractor,
it cost me $800 to fix it.
So that delta of the $800 to fix
it versus the 600.
That's coming out of my own
pocket, correct?
What, what happens is this, you
have a claim.
They usually uh.
Practice or, or everyday
practice is a claims adjuster
will go visit your home. Look at
your
You're hail damage. They're
going to uh look at and
calculate the cost to fix or
replace that portion of your
home.
And uh if you, if you have your
own uh
Contractor look at it and
there's a difference between the
two then there there'd be a a
meeting they compromise and
figure out exactly how much
they're going to pay out.
OK, because the contract might
be adding something that the
insurance company isn't looking
at. So it's common practice that
they get together and figure out
how much they're going to
actually pay out or what or what
is it gonna cost to replace that
portion of the roof.
At that point, you receive a
check. Usually you receive a
replacement cost check.
OK, for that part that you uh
that you're having your claim
on.
Then if you replace it or you
turn on by the hot tub as you're
talking about is strictly up to
you, but what we're trying to
avoid is that next claim coming
in trying to claim the same
damage on that same roof that
was never replaced.
Perfect. All right. I, thank
you, uh, Senator Ros. Thank you,
Madam Chair. So I understand
that.
So there has to be a
documentation trail.
Um, you know, prime example is
Probably a better example would
have been hail damage to the
car.
Um, you know, I send it in, they
say, hey, you go to this garage,
get the assessment and get the
damage and then if you
So how, how do you, how do you
do that oversight in the
insurance business with this
regarding like hail damage to a
car where I might not
Get it repaired
And just say I'll just live with
a little dents in there, take
the check.
And then another hailstorm comes
a month later and I file another
claim. I think that was the
fraud thing, uh, the senator was
talking about.
How, how do you, how do you
How do you stop that?
Madam Chair, company should be
doing due diligence when the
roof is replaced, there should
be photo evidence.
Um, they are also utilizing
drones now in multiple
companies. I take the filing
they are using so many are using
drones, many are using satellite
imagery and some still have on
the ground adjusters that are
going out, um, we've also seen
where companies are doing photos
of the first initial damage.
So they can compare.
OK, all right, thank you, thank
you, Melissa. Thank you, Madam
Chair, and then just to
I, I, I didn't hear.
Really enough
From you with Senator Sidil
Lopez's.
Concerns on insurance fraud.
Um
You know, she's she's an
attorney as well. I know you're
an attorney.
Um, but I, I wasn't really kind
of.
A little sketchy on.
The insurance fraud piece that
you, you couldn't really answer
clearly. I, I just wanna give
you another opportunity to
answer.
Her concern regarding insurance
fraud with this bill because she
thinks it's her opinion and I
respect it that well.
You're, you're actually filing a
second claim.
Because you're getting the
depreciation first, that check
up front or whatever that is,
and then it's the work gets
done, there's another check for
you.
Um
In, in layman's terms.
Can you explain why that is not
fraud in in your opinion. I, I
guess I'll turn it over to you
as the attorney.
Madam Chair and senator.
Um, and I hate to do this to
you, but as an attorney would
say, it's all about your intent,
so some behavior may or may not
be criminal. Some behavior.
Mm
could be, you could be less
culpable for it. However, it's
my belief that that's why we
need to set this in statute
because right now, some of the
more nefarious actors can easily
just say, well, well, you didn't
tell me how to do it.
So I wasn't doing anything
wrong. Your statute doesn't say
it. And so, again, whether
behavior is, is fraud or not,
depends a lot on the specific
facts of the case, but also on
the intent behind it, it's
possible some of these cases
could be considered fraud. It's
also possible, some of them
might not rise to that level.
Thank you, counselor. Thank you,
Madam Chair. That was not
helpful, but
But that's what I'm paid for.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator
last, last question I'll ask you
is, um,
If this bill is not passed.
Will insurance premiums rise for
the public.
Um, Madam Chair, senator, uh
currently they're, they're
rising a lot faster than anybody
wants them to.
And we're hoping that this bill
will put some brakes on on the.
The cash rising is is Madam
Chair, uh, thank you, Senator
Ramos. Thank you, Melissa.
Thank you, attorney for that
non-answer.
Um
I appreciate it and I, um.
extend in support of this bill,
uh, based, based on those
answers, uh, which are helpful.
So thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Any other questions
from committee, Senator Pinto.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
So
We put it in.
Committee members
But
Me, it's like any insurance
company can are.
And to kind of.
Put up the guard rails in that
sense.
Is it still on? Oh, Madam Chair
and Senator.
That's correct to some degree,
but when things are set forth in
statute and are provided
otherwise in law, um, an
insurance company cannot write
policies that contradict those
laws, so something in statute.
would supersede a policy.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
In lie of all the
A trees
Is
It seems like.
Well
And an insurance company.
In order to leverage losses.
Well, anything happens over
here, they're able to cover it.
Do we know? I'm chairing members
of the committee.
If doing this, it's really gonna
out its company.
Especially when you talk about
State Farm.
Being one of those.
That is not uh
wearing the white hat at the
time.
So is this gonna be to their
advantage and the smaller
insurance company.
Madam Chair, Senator, no.
And
I say that because looking at
the initial statue, all the
companies are required to write
to replacement costs right now.
What we're running into is we
have nothing saying how they
have to pay out, so they're
paying even less than actual
cash, those large companies on
the line immediately to actually
first pay actual cash value, the
amount fully up to the repair.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, so this is really.
Or the little.
In which though
If the policy is written.
A small company.
And they don't have that many
members of the.
Um
And they sell to a certain area.
There's a catastrophe within
that area.
Basically, the company will go
under and they're not.
Madam Chan and Senator, no. And
the reason is, is they have to
value their plans to stay
solvent, and they do have to
file their rate um.
And I just lost the word, but
they do have to file their rates
and they do have to be actually
justified to be able to stay in
the market, so that smaller
company that is writing in a
specific area, must be able to
justify their rates to loss.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
I don't really know that long,
but um.
I don't think anybody's ever
really.
That in
Uh, the real value.
Or any kind of insurance claim.
And it's always undervalued.
And they're always fighting with
the insurance, hey.
You know, what they feel like.
There's always an adjustment, an
adjustment.
And when we talk about homes.
You know, the cooking to homes
is.
That when someone buys a home.
We feel that it is um I'm going
to appreciate, not depreciate.
But even with the vehicles too.
You know, drive it off the lot,
that's it, but there's gap
insurance cover.
That's why I'm a little bit that
there's probably a way around
this without putting it into law
underlying factors are that are
not really.
Within this bill that I guess in
some sense, the unintended.
Of us putting in it
But the and and madam chair, um,
senator, those are good
comments. Um, bottom line, this
is going to
Help all the insurance companies
throughout the industry and,
and, and everyone's gonna be on
the same balance and how they're
going to be paying uh the, the
consumer or the customer
whenever they do have their
claims. So they'll be everyone
will have to make sure that uh
the uh
Pay the replacement costs minus
the depreciation upfront and the
remainder will be paid at the
uh.
At the end of of uh.
Project.
So it, it'll kind of put a level
field between all companies.
And Madam Chair, members of the.
But
If we're gonna put this in
statute and state law, but if
you're
Madam Chair and senator, if
they're operating within this
state, this statute applies.
Madam Chair members some of the
examples you use too, and that's
why we put in Bill.
He's out of state companies.
contract somebody else.
come and assess.
Am I not mistaken, Madam
Chairman.
Madam Chair and senator, uh,
different companies use
different protocols, so many of
the larger companies actually
have in-field claims adjusters
actually, um, the companies that
represent 80, almost 90% of our
market have in-field claims
adjusters.
At the time of catastrophes
occasionally and it's up to our
discretion, we will allow out of
state adjusters.
But
2 things. Number 1, the company
must, even if they're an outside
company, they must be licensed
to do business here to sell
policies. Secondly, they're
adjusters whether they are.
If they're in state, they must
actually hold an adjuster's
license if they come from out of
state, they still have
requirements they have to meet
in New Mexico to be able to
adjust claims here with our
statute.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee, is there a shot clock
on? In other words.
Um, you make that claim.
with your licensing that says,
well, this is my claim because
you're saying, well, there's a
claim here and then, you know,
doesn't get it gets depreciated
all this time. Basically, the
claim was not paid.
In a timely manner, it seems,
um.
But who's who does that fall on
anybody?
Madam Chair and senator.
We did not add a time frame to
this, and there's a very logical
reason why.
You look at the people of with
hermits peak Caf Canyon.
We are now 3 years out.
And there's still floodplains
being determined, they might not
be able to rebuild right now.
They may still be trying to
figure out where they what their
next plan is. I can speak from
experience. I've lost a home in
a wildfire.
And it took a good 4 to 5 years
to figure out really what our
next step was going to be.
Secondly, there's a shortage on
contractors.
So people have contracts that
were signed 2 years ago that
still have not been able to
start the build process.
So we did not put a time frame.
Now it's up to the customers to
also.
Do their due diligence and keep
moving forward with the repair
or the replacement because if
they do have an open claim that
they have just sat there and
they try to find another
insurance company, it will show
an open claim on their record.
So really it works on both
sides. It allows the insured to
figure out what their next steps
are, but yet there's a driving
factor for them to continue to
move forward. Madam Chair and
members of the, I'm glad you.
Mention that you lost.
If you would like to enlighten
us is.
What did, where did you live
during that time?
Hey, in a certain amount of
time.
And you have nowhere to live.
And
Madam Chair and senator, I'll
get into more specifics in a
minute cause I gotta pull myself
together for that one.
But included in the policy,
there is a loss of use.
Endorsement in all policies have
it minus 2 companies, which is a
first place policy.
And the fair plan.
At the time that you structure
is not livable, they will pay.
The amount for you to find
housing.
With that being said, um,
We lost our home in Los Amos.
Um, we were very fortunate to
have FEMA step in.
And provide housing and to find
a replacement home.
Ma
Um, me too.
Bring that up, but
Where did you stay? That's what
I'm saying like there's, um, you
know, especially when we talk
about rural New Mexico.
And having a hotel or a long
stay place.
And being displaced.
I
Madam Senator.
You couldn't have summed that up
better. We ended up, um, living
with my aunt.
For about 6 to 8 months until
FEMA bill got put in.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee with this particular
legislation alleviate that.
Madam Chair and Senator, this
particular legislation and just
his backstory, I also lost a
home in the Hermit's Peak calf
Canyon fire, but fortunately it
was a second home. So I was very
blessed to not have to relocate.
Um
This is just one piece in the
giant puzzle that everybody's
having to navigate during this
traumatic time, uh, a large
portion of
people's worries are stemming
from FEMA, a large portion are
stemming from insurance, a large
portion or stemming from water
quality, and so on and so on.
This is just one mechanism we
have in a huge toolbox of tools,
and we believe that not only
will it help insurance
companies, but it is consumer
friendly, and it will actually
drive down the cost of insurance
for people that are already
having so much to deal with on
their plate.
Madam Chance, so with this
particular legislation.
help with the situation she had.
Is that
Madam Chair, Senator, yes.
Thank you, Senator Hickey.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator,
and experts from the OSI in
2012, I came back to New Mexico
to start in New Mexico Health
Connections, the Obamacare plan
co op.
Um
I'm starting it from scratch,
which hadn't been done in New
Mexico for probably 20 years.
Um
There was a lot of insurance
code and so forth, but
Uh, I can't assure the committee
that even though that's
completely different from
Home
Uh, per se.
The, the regulations.
Really are put together so as to
and and and this is one of them
that has to come in to box out
bad actors and understand what
it is they do, so when and
theresedil Lopez says, well, you
know, fra doesn't it.
You know, it should be dealing
with fraud. Well, fraud happens
and this will help stop the
fraud from happening, even
though this is not a fraud
regulation per se.
But it will stop it and it will
lower, it will keep pressure, it
will allow the insurance
companies to be able to sell for
less going in the future, and I
do appreciate maybe others not
being in the insurance business.
But you have to have with uh
resource-based capital.
Which is a very complex formula
which basically says you've got
to have gobsmack reserves.
Or when the
It's the fan and um and then on
top of that, you have to have
reinsurance so that even if your
reserves.
Don't cover the most awful thing
you have another insurer like
Lloyd's of London or I mean,
there are many of them in the
country.
That stand behind that. So there
are a number of layers, um, it
is a business that you, you
learn as you go, but I can also
tell you that if you end up
With a questionable activity,
the department is there.
Uh, to the extent of even taking
over your business, uh, and
running it or bringing someone
in. So I think this is a very
important bill.
You keep the cost of insurance
down. Uh, we are all getting
amateurized for California, I
mean.
For better or for worse, uh,
nationally, it's we're paying
for it for hurricanes in Florida
and other uninsurable uh
potential areas. So, uh, I thank
you for bringing this. I
understand the complexity, uh,
but it is complex, but it really
is a consumer rights bill.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Charlie.
Um
Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator,
my question might not be
relevant, but I'm going to ask
it anyhow. I was actually
looking it up to see because it
is residential.
Um, what protection, if any, or
what relationship, if any, is.
Would this have on um military
families during permanent change
of stations. And so the reason I
ask this is because I have PCS
or permanent change several
times.
And my things get my my for
everything's been damaged during
the PCS move, especially, um.
Transcontinental.
Um
And it would have been helpful
insurance to have because I got
the depreciated value and just
the depreciated value for my
household items.
Um, so does this have any
bearing on protection for
military families.
through either rental property,
um, insurance. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Madam Madam Chair,
Senator, that's a really good
question. Um, what happens is if
you, if you currently have your
policy and you and you and it's
for anyone if they're moving
safe from Albuquerque down to
Silver City. And for instance,
they have a generator and a
trailer comes loose and it's
Smashed up and it's no longer
usable.
What happens then is they'll go
to their insurance company. What
they'll do is they'll the
insurance company will turn
around and pay them.
Um
The actual cash value for it,
OK, because that's with
depreciation. And then when the
person goes and buys an actual
generator.
Then they'll get the replacement
value.
OK, at that point. So they're
covered for the whole
replacement after they get the
receipt that they purchased it.
Otherwise, what happens a lot of
times though is once they get
that first check, they'll go buy
a used one over at the flea
market and not even bothered to
get the replacement cost.
So, which is up to them. They
might save $500 what have you.
But that's, that's the way it
happens in, in real, real life
in real time.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator.
Thank you.
Any
Senator Pinto, for a 2nd time?
Yes, madam chair members of the
committee.
Depending on your need.
We feel like we're
In a way
Finishing the consumer.
Or
Filling the need the generator
and maybe they get a 2nd.
Because if it's not available.
Um
You know that that's
I think you should have the
preview to make that decision if
you're going to not spend all of
it on the.
Old generator.
Uh, when you talk about hail
damage.
Um, you know, some of that.
it
Working with the adjusters, oh
well, you.
The damage can be covered with
the, you know.
The guardrails or something.
And then they decrease the cost,
but it's like something basic.
There's some things I'm like,
well, yes, but they try to call
it fraud.
Um
That actual decision by the
consumer. It's like we're
overriding it, Madam Chair,
Senator good comments. Just
going back to the generator, OK?
Say that it's a 8300.
type of generator just for
simple discussion and the A300
is no longer available. Now they
went to a 305. Usually what cus
what what insurance companies
will do is is go ahead and let
you purchase that A305 because
it's, that's what the next step
that's available or the next
product that's available and go
ahead and pay your replacement
cost uh for that uh generator.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I hardly see.
raise costs, but you're saying
it's gonna drive stuff down or.
You know, the cost of insurance
down, but yet you're saying,
well, we're still gonna end up
paying more than.
Madam Chan, Senator.
I'm trying to think of
Easy ways to insurance is
complicated.
Um,
So I'm gonna touch first on the
personal property in my own
experience.
We had older furniture, it was
not made anymore, so as we
replaced it, they paid the
additional amount, OK, to
replace that.
When you're talking about damage
to the same item over and over
and over.
When the cost to repair it
totally would have been cheaper
than these reoccurring claims?
That's where it's gonna help
stabilize the rate.
A new Ruth is less likely to be
as heavily damaged as one that
keeps repetitively being damaged
and then the damage goes
further. Now it's went from hail
damage to water damage inside
the home.
Thank you, Senator Pinto. Any
other questions, Senator Block,
for a second time? Thank you,
Madam Chair. Um, Senator Charlie
mentioned something interesting
and caught my ear, uh, Senator
Ramos, in regards to military
PCS.
Which I'm intimately familiar
with with 12 moves in 21 years.
Uh, going back and forth between
here and Europe.
Um, when we go through.
Uh, when a person has private
insurance whether it's like USA
or anything, but they go through
the
The TMO office on the base, the
travel management office.
Um, any damage is already
covered.
Through the military under under
TMO through the PCS money, so
trying to understand what, what
exactly did you say in regards
to
If I have a
Antique rolltop desk.
Which happened and you know the
good old US Air Force totaled
it.
Um, I got, they did a, um,
They they do an assessment a
little evaluation or whatever.
I, I never, we don't claim that
as military members because we
can't claim it again with our
private insurance with our home
insurance. That's the way I
understood it.
But are you, what did I hear you
right? where you guys would
cover, it would cover that
outside of the military.
That already covers it anyway.
Because they go back to the
mover, United Van Lines or, or
whoever to get that cost back,
so can you just tell me again
what you said?
Madam Chair, Senator.
Essentially
Yes, you have the TMO, but we
have seen issues where.
And I have come out of an area
that was highly military and
occasionally, especially if they
were deployed overseas.
They would hire somebody to pack
up their house. The items would
have to be delivered to a
shipping facility and in the
process of that shipping
facility because it was under
the TMO, but the people chose to
use their own.
I'll say vendor, shipping
company, and that is damaged,
then under your homeowners or
your renters, it would still
cover your personal belongings.
Melissa, thank you, thank you,
Madam Chair. So what you're
talking about is what we call
the Diddy.
That's a do it-yourself move.
That's a different story. So
that, that kind of clears it up
for me because under the, if you
didn't do a did he move? By the
way, I'm very sorry about your
home. I, I hope, I hope you and
your family are, are recovering
very, very sorry.
But that's a totally different
story than the piece, the
regular PCS through TMO
sponsored move.
Because that's where there's
potential fraud, and I've seen
it in the military.
Where a, you know, an airman who
thinks he or she is super smart,
um.
And there can be kind of dumb
sometimes where they try to.
Do another claim for something
that's already paid for on a TMO
sponsored move.
And, and they'll get caught and
they'll get hammered as they
should, so I just want, I
appreciate you clarifying that,
uh, Melissa. I wish uh Senator
Ramos could have answered that,
but.
You know, that's my friend, but
thank you so much. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you. Any other questions?
What is the wish of the
committee?
Senator Hickey.
Pa.
motion for a due pass from
Senator Hickey.
With a second from Senator
Block.
If you could call the role
place.
in our block.
Ion, yes, Senator Charley.
Yes, and to explain.
And our Gallegos
And nova.
Senor Pinto.
And
Yes.
And I said Lopez, no.
Hickey.
Senor Lopez.
Yes.
And to explain her vote, Senator
Charlie.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, Senator Ramos, I do think,
um, there needs to be more
explicit language around
inflation on page 2, 11 lines 11
through 13, um, to account for
the intent.
Of the bill that that would be
my, my recommendation. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, Senator, we'll
definitely work on that.
For for the next committee.
And with a vote of 9 to 1, you
have a due pass.
Onto judiciary.
Yes, thank you.
Uh, Senator Wirth, would you
join us up front for Senate Bill
57.
I'm Adam. We're here on Senate
Bill 57.
Uh, with me is Doctor Lisa
Hofler from UNM Health Sciences.
Is the interim chair of the
OBGYN.
apartment
A Senate Bill 57 creates a new
exemption to the inspection of
public Records Act.
Uh, currently, uh, IPRA applies
to employees of public
institutions.
And for doctors providing
abortion services.
Uh, at a public institution.
There has been a huge volume of
IPRA.
Requests that have been made.
In a typical year UNM receives
600 to 650 requests, but
providers, uh, UNMH have been
receiving 100 IPRA requests a
year on all kinds of different
issues.
Uh, so what this does is create
an exception or records
containing personal identifying
information or sensitive
information related to the
practice of a medical provider.
Employed by a public body who
performs medical services
related to abortion.
Uh, so, essentially, that's what
the bill does, and I would yield
to
Um
Doctor
A.
Uh, if she has any comments, and
then we're happy to.
Stanford questions.
Thank you, good afternoon, um,
thank you, Madam Chair for the
opportunity to come before this
committee, um, as you heard, my
name is Doctor Lisa Hofler, I'm
a board certified obstetrician
gynecologist. I'm also the vice
chair of the New Mexico section
of the American College of
OBGYNs and so I can speak in
both of those, those, um,
regards. Above all, it preserves
an important purpose in our
state and I am a firm believer
in transparency. However, my
team of OBGYN physicians has
been subject to continuous.
random and essentially anonymous
out of state requests for large
volumes of documents.
These are targeted at OBGYNs who
are subject to IPRA who provide
the full spectrum of OBGYN care
and also provide abortion care.
The problems with IPRA and its
current form, that this
legislation would address our
overwhelmingly safety.
Abortion providers already faced
violence and disruption that
have been increasing over the
last few years, and I proable
information provides enough
detail for targeting like other
personal information, clinical
schedules, travel plans,
upcoming um healthcare plans
around the state and calendar
information, which feels very
unsafe. These expansive requests
encompass hundreds or thousands
of documents that contain all of
that, including other personal
details, not only of public.
employees, but also trainees,
staff, colleagues across the
state and the country who
otherwise would not be part of
of.
Public records, um, although a
strong attempt is made to redact
personal information, the sheer
volume and the fact that I'm the
safety net for my IPA requests
can be dangerous to clinicians.
Second workforce protections.
This feels like and is
harassment of clinicians who
dedicate their careers to
serving our communities. We need
every OBGYN that we can get in
New Mexico, and these voluminous
and onerous requests are frankly
demoralizing to people that care
deeply about our communities.
Regarding sensitive information,
um, it's difficult to define
sensitive information, so some
examples might include related
to safety, the names of
residents or other trainees who
are not students and therefore
protected by FERPA, um, those
people's uh personal information
could potentially come out.
mentees from other institutions,
colleagues from other
institutions, abortion providers
and other physicians from around
the state who are not state
employees, um.
And calendars shift coverage,
um, clinical schedules, travel
plans that might make it easy to
physically target second
academic work is sensitive
information, so unpublished
academic manuscripts, original
research articles, confidential
work that we do for medical
societies, emails related to
creation, creating national, um,
certification exams that then if
found and published online by a
member of the public could no
longer be used.
Um, and so, so I just wanna say
that New Mexico has rightly put
into place many other
protections for those physicians
that provide reproductive
healthcare and abortion care,
and this bill addresses a gap in
provider safety by extending
those important protections into
EPRA.
Thank you.
So man, I'm sure we have a
different set of rules for this
very limited scope that
This practice when it's in a
public institution, uh, if
you're not in the public
institution, it's not applying
and you heard the breath of the
requests that are coming.
Uh, I think this would be an
important step to just level the
playing field for all providers
in this area and quite frankly,
stop what's become.
Borderline dangerous, um.
Expansion of the documents being
requested from all over the
country. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. Um, there is
an amendment.
For your bill, did you get a
copy?
Um, I just was handed it, yes.
OK. And it's not, it's not for
me.
No, this is from.
Um
And um Senator Block, would you
like to move your amendment?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
Senator Wirth, uh, welcome, my
friend. Um, I hope this is not
as painful as SB 3 on the floor.
Oh
It'd be pretty quick.
Um,
I'll just go through this real
quick, and I just wanna know if
this is a friendly, uh, two of
the pieces here are basically
the same information.
Um, because what the doctor
said, I completely agree with in
regards to the safety of, of
individuals we don't want.
Um, addresses or names or emails
or phone numbers, uh, out there,
um, the public, and I understand
that, which is why I think it
should be protected.
Um, Senator, so I would like to
make a, uh, Madam Chair, I
propose to the Senate Health and
Public Affairs Committee, the
following amendments to Senate
bill.
57
Senator, if I could just for
Procedure, you need to move your
amendment.
So
I'm sure I'd love to move the
amendment.
OK. And is there a second?
OK, there's a motion in a
second.
Please proceed. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Just procedure. Thank
you. 4 weeks.
That was fine.
Thank you.
Uh, Senator Worth, um,
On page one, Madam Chair, uh,
Senator Wirth, Doctor, I'd like
to
Lines 13 and 14 strike.
The following verbiage.
Personal identifying information
or sensitive information related
to the practice.
End quote
An insert in lieu thereof the
following.
Personal home address?
Personal phone number?
Personal email.
Uh, correspondence.
On the 2nd piece of that
amendment, Madam Chair, Senator
Wirth, Doctor, on page 3.
Basically, it's the same
language on lines 11 and 12 to
strike.
Per identifying information or
sensitive information related to
the practice, end quote.
And insert
In lieu thereof, quote, the
person, the personal home
address.
Personal phone number.
Or personal email
correspondence, end quote, which
is the same as the first change
of the amendment.
And then the last one, Madam
Chair, Senator Wirth is on page
3, line 14.
Um, after the semicolon insert
should be strike the word and.
And insert the following.
Provided that this exception
Does not extend to information
in aggregated data.
Related to abortion services
provided by a public body.
End quote.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator Warre. Thank you,
doctor.
Oh, Senator.
Awesome I appreciate that this
certainly has a couple of the
pieces that we're trying to
protect, but I think as you
heard from
Uh, Doctor Hofler, the range of
different issues that
They're facing and what this.
Bill as drafted would cover is
much broader than what's
proposed in here, and I
appreciate, you know, what
you're trying to do here, but
This is far narrower than what.
We're trying to do with the
bill, so it would not be a
friendly amendment.
OK, thank you.
So with that, we'll go to the
audience and for the amendment
only.
Is there anyone in support of
the amendment?
If you're in support of the
amendment, would you like to
come forward and make a
statement or just raise your
hand.
OK.
Is there anyone in opposition?
the amendment.
Would you like to come forward
just to raise your hand? OK.
Is there anyone on Zoom?
No? OK.
So we'll go to questions or
comments regarding the amendment
from committee members.
Senator said the Olous.
Uh, madam chair with the
sponsor, the amendment yield to
um
Uh, talk about the relationship
to this and and HIPAA.
You're asking Senator Block? OK,
Senator Block.
I, I yield, madam chair.
Um, thank you for, uh, for the
question, uh, senator. So this
would not because what we wanted
to do is take out any, any HIPAA
information and email. HIPAA is
not available anyway, nor does
anyone have any business, uh,
looking at personal information,
so.
That would be not included in
this, not part of it, um, I'm
very sensitive to HIPAA from,
from my, my, my background, what
I was doing before.
So this is not the intent, the
spirit and intent of that is to
not, um,
IPR any HIPA information. We, I,
I don't, I don't wanna know, nor
am I entitled to know the names
of anyone being treated for
whatever it is that any care
facility in the state of New
Mexico.
All this is to do like Senator
Wirth and the doctor was talking
about.
is to protect and they should be
protected, the providers, and
I'm very sorry if you've had any
uh type of threats or anything
like that. I know some elected
officials.
have had threats and we're not
covered under this for one
thing, um.
Our address and phone numbers,
everything's public for us, but
I want to make sure that our
providers are, are protected
with your name, your personal
phone number, your personal uh
home address, uh, and your email
correspondence is protected, so
no HIPAA.
Um
OK, I, I guess this amendment,
um, to me, this information is
already protected by HIPA, I
guess what you're saying is this
relates to the providers.
The provider's information not
being provided, which was
patient information would be.
Um, I'm sorry, Madam Chair, um,
I'm sorry, Senator, could you
repeat that? My, my hearing's a
a little bad.
Um, so my understanding is this
would be.
The strike personally um.
I guess I, I agree that it, it's
uh you're this, this amendment
is narrower than what.
They're attempting to do, but I
guess I'm thinking that what
you're doing is already covered
by HIPAA.
And I guess the answer is no
because you're protecting.
I'm just trying to understand
this. So this is protecting the
provider's information as well,
which would be broader than
HIPAA.
It's a, it's a, I'm just trying
to understand this in my own
mind.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh, Senator
Suil Lopez, again, this
amendment protects HIPAA.
I mean, we, we, that's against
the law anyway, providing HIPAA,
my question was the relationship
between the two. Does this
protect more than HIPAA
protects, and my understanding
is it does because you're
providing, you're protecting the
provider information.
That's what I was trying to
understand, yes ma'am, uh, I
want to protect the provider's
information, this particular
doctor here.
Whatever or any, any doctor.
I want to protect their
information as much as possible
from the public, whether or not
any citizen agrees or disagrees
with that person's practice.
Um, they deserve to be
protected.
Under this, um,
The doctor's name, address, and
email correspondence should be
private, should be protected.
OK
Uh, thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. I, I'm not, I'm not going
to support the amendment just
because it is narrower than
what. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. I'm Senator
Hickey.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and uh
Thank you for bringing this very
important uh
piece of legislation, but I
would like to address
Uh
The amendment and
Uh, so this may be to Senator
Block as well. Um,
Senator Black having been
involved in medical information.
Most my career and
Generally, um,
When
Personal identifying information
that basically that's name,
address, phone number, date of
birth.
Um
And
Uh
Those, those are the key pieces,
but also the sensitive
information related to the
practice. And I think what we're
hearing is that they're able to
get schedules, having a OBGYN to
train the wife who trained at
UNM, um, years ago in the
schedules and so forth. I mean,
why anyone would ever want that,
but if someone has a nefarious
purpose.
I think that your amendment does
not cover that.
And because it's very specific.
Secondly, I'd point out that
your amendment talks only about
personal.
Email correspondence. So that's
kind of like what they have in
their own personal email, not
the email from Salud, uh, that
they could have.
Going back and forth or even
text information, uh,
um.
Never mind the text, but
basically they're they're using
a lot of the email
correspondence back and forth
with each other. So, I think
that this
This actually
You, you, uh, the, the scope of
information that needs to be
covered, as I heard the bill
introduce actually gets narrowed
by your first two amendments.
That's, that's my observation.
Um, secondly, and I, I need
clarification on this, uh,
doctor and, and women.
Um
I don't think, except
In the case of
Necessity for protecting the
mother's life or in a situation
where
A fetus is not viable. I don't
believe you and them does
abortion.
Uh, am I correct? Uh elective
abortions.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator. Um, UNM does provide
abortion care earlier in
pregnancy outside of those
contexts as well. Oh, OK, then.
Um
I, I was wrong in my, in my
assumption there.
Um
OK, so anyway, um, I, I don't.
I, I don't know what the
relevance is to the bill where
we're protecting.
Individual information about the
provider, their schedules and so
forth that the last.
Uh, point has relevance to the
bill. So, uh, Senator Black, if,
if you want to counter that,
happy to have you do it, but
those are my observations.
Thank you Madam Chair. Uh, thank
you, Senator Hickey.
Um, I, I would concede the point
that personally, the word
personal before email.
Uh, probably should be official,
um.
Actually should be official.
There's that would that's an
oversight on my part's good
catch on your part.
Because in my opinion, your
personal emails personal. I
don't think they can IPRA your
personal email that should be
official.
Um, in regards to the third
piece.
Um, well, back to the first
piece.
These are still
Um
Let me ask you this, um,
Doctor Icky to get some
clarification.
These, these providers, it
doesn't matter what they provide
to me the, the, the, that's not
the issue to me at all. It's
about the um these providers are
receiving taxpayer.
Buns, are they, are they not?
Uh, Madam Chair, if I could.
As Senator Vicky to yield to
that question.
Uh
Madam Chair, Senator, um,
The
They, they are, yes, there are
federal indirect payments, uh,
residency payments do come in,
so that is tax base, uh, there
is probably some state tax base
that goes into supporting the
medical school, but there's also
um, I, I think an amazing amount
of the
Uh, compensation for
Professors.
Instructors, whatever level at
UNM, um, most of that is from
clinical care income. Matter of
fact, I think we are one of the
lowest supporting states for a
public institution medical
school in terms of the
proportion of compensation. Uh,
the average or
Public institutions, uh, being
contributed.
In their compensation by the
state is about 18% and we only
do 6.
Um, and so that, that's kind of
always been an issue because we
are not competitive with other
states for our.
For our faculty.
So, thank you for providing that
little platform for me to get
that out because that's
something we've definitely got
to fix going forward into the
future, but I will agree that
yes, there is a, a taxpayer
component, but I don't know that
I as a taxpayer can go and find
out the individual information
or whatever on anyone, uh, that
is uh supported through some
sort of tax or grant.
If, if that's where you're
going.
Editor. Thank you, ma'am, chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator Hickey. Oh.
You're exactly right. If it's,
this is about taxpayer
transparency.
This is not about anything else
related to any procedures or
Or whatever
Whatever medical care is
provided, this is about.
This, this prevents the public
and the media.
Cause we're going down the
slippery slope in my, my
opinion.
Because like Senator Wirth
talked about.
It's a narrow scope of we're
setting aside these people that
are going to be treated
differently.
By the taxpayer or by statute.
Who are paid for and there's
funding from our from New Mexico
taxpayers.
That's the issue. We're not
treating them, we're treating
them completely different, which
is a slippery slope to
Other
Taxpayer funded
Employees are elected officials.
Where this, where we can use
this rule to apply to other
people that we say, well,
You know
Some, some idiot shot up a
politician's home.
We want to provide
And make sure that this
amendment or this concept.
I applied equally across all
public employees.
Because
You know
There are certain things that we
can't do for like the police
reports and investigation, you
can't IPRA those until the
investigation is over.
To to see certain reports or, or
videos. So all this does
The priority is protecting.
The provider
And the providers' personal
information with name.
Phone number
Email
In their official email.
That's, that's what we're
talking about here on in
regards, um, Madam Chair, uh,
Senator Hickey, Senator Worth
and Doctor.
For the third part of the
amendment.
I
Again, this is taxpayer funds.
is not
We're not saying stop funding.
You or any other provider, not
saying that at all in this. What
we're saying is we all talk
about transparency and how
important transparency is.
There has to be transparency.
Of taxpayer dollars. In fact, I
would argue the LFC can't do
reports that we need to make
informed decisions without some
aggregated data, no matter what
it is. That's the important
piece. So,
The amendment there for number 3
is basically, you know, how, how
do we even know what money was
spent and how. I think the
taxpayers deserve to know that.
It's a transparency issue. It's
not about an abortion. This is
transparency of our tax dollars.
Across
The state
How do we further, for instance,
if the doctor is having some
issues.
Funding issues at her clinic.
Or her hospital, I'm sorry, I
don't know where, where you
work. Don't tell me.
Um, how do we know without some
data, some metrics coming back.
If we need to provide additional
funding or, or, or maybe they're
too well funded, whoever it is.
So if we can't even get the data
back and the transparent manner.
We're the leg we're the
oversight bodies is the
legislature for that and and
I'll, I'll yield because it
looks like worthless something.
So Madam Chair, we're talking
about two different things. This
is inspection of Public Records
Act.
I think that we as
the LFC and as appropriators
absolutely need to understand
what's going on and I'm sure
UNMH.
And it's process, we certainly
shouldn't have to be using IPRA
to get information about what a
university is spending. And I've
never seen that.
Situation. That's what we're
talking about here is very
narrow, so again, I think that
RLFC.
Obviously, I agree with you. He
needs to have the information to
be able to make the decisions
and I don't think we're using
IPRA.
Against the state institution. I
think that's in the budget
process. This is a very specific
to IPRA.
Senator Hickey, I think, wants
to also add, please.
Yes, um, thank you for the
observation, but I think we are
apples and oranges, although I
want to tell you I like your
oranges a lot, because uh we do
have an oppayer claims database
that we as a legislature, need
to have full, easy.
Uh, access to, to de-identified
data which would give you all
the aggregate information that
you're looking for. And I think
all that information probably is
available to you upon request
from the university if at this
moment, but we as a legislature
don't have legal access to that.
Now, I will be putting forth a
bill to cover that. Um, but, uh,
uh, you talk about a slippery
slope, but where OBGYNs are and
with the politicalization that
is occurring.
po lar ization that is occurring
in the country that there are a
deadly part of the slope.
And that's what this is here to
all uh eliminate if we find
others um who might be on the
slope and are really at risk,
and we need to consider them as
well. But I think this is very
specific and doesn't set a
precedent but protects. And
again, makes New Mexico a place
where people want to come and do
their residency and practice,
uh, without this, uh, again,
we'll have another, it's like uh
a number of other issues,
compensation, what have you,
detractors from practicing.
here in New Mexico.
Thank you, Senator Hickey.
Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, I
appreciate, um.
Both senators on this, and I
would agree.
1 and 2 would be apples and 3
would be an orange on this
because
This, this is way too broad.
And
It has
The ability and the capability
of the way this bill is written.
To not be transparent in regards
to the funding.
Uh, the way it is written, where
you cannot the public cannot.
Uh, see, see the records of how
we are spending their, their tax
dollars.
Um
I
I appreciate the debate very
respectful.
Make sure that our providers are
protected like you, I will say,
uh, Madam Chair, Senator Hickey,
Senator Wirth as a county
commissioner, I've had death
threats myself with my picture
up with a target on my head.
Uh, because of my
Views on the issue of energy.
Uh
And my
My wife's name, you know, I have
a home. I have a.
Little, little girl and that's
open.
Um, and again,
This this broad focus, Madam
Sheriff Senator Hickey, uh,
Senator Worth and Doctor.
It
It it treats one.
Treats certain taxpayer funded
employees totally different than
others when it comes to
transparency.
Uh, same thing on the funding
piece for
People in New Mexico deserve to
know where their tax dollars are
spent, they should be able to
that and um
You know, we have differences of
opinion, and I appreciate that
and uh I'll yield.
Thank you, Senator Charlie on
the amendment.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair, I
actually don't think that this
is um.
The the the actual bill as it
sits right now is too broad in
scope and that the amendment is.
Um
An attempt to gut the intent of
this bill.
Um, especially because we don't
have name in here, right, we
talked about name, um, Madam
Chair, Senator Black, but name
isn't.
In here and all anyone needs to
have is someone's name to go
online and then get all of the
other information that you've.
Outlined here, um.
For doxing purposes.
Um, and I, I appreciate the
consideration for taxpayer
transparency and would argue
that we've had a couple of bills
up here.
That should have had greater
support from this committee
along that same vein and didn't.
So, um, with that, madam.
OK, thank you.
No other questions. Um.
We are in a motion and a second
on the amendment, and if you
could call the roll, please.
Senator Block
I
And our boon.
Senator Charlie.
No.
Senator Gallegos.
And nova.
Pinto.
And our
Yes
Senatorio Lopez, no, Senator
Hickey.
And Lopez, no.
Uh, your amendment test, we're
back on the bill.
And uh
What I will do is that I, I only
went to the audience in favor of
the amendments, so I still need
to go back and ask.
Um, if there's anyone in favor
of the bill.
That was not amended.
Raise your hand, please.
Did you wish to come forward and
make a statement?
Chair and members of committee.
My name is Kat Sanchez. I'm with
Bold Futures, we are a statewide
organization by and for black
indigenous women and people of
color.
In ensuring community leaders
and their lived experience, we
are aware of the time that we're
living in where people's
personal information is made
public or doxed.
In addition, people's logistics
and activities are tracked and
they can be targeted for
nefarious reasons. We know that
individuals receiving
reproductive healthcare in New
Mexico could have their personal
information released as part of
an IPA request, and while there
is a balance of transparency via
the IPRA process, we know the
reality for individuals getting
the care they need and the
privacy they should have to keep
as patients, as well as the
privacy and safety of providers
and clinicians is is important.
We urge you.
Pass.
Thank you. Is there anyone else
in favor in the audience?
Anyone in opposition?
Yes, would you like to come
forward and make a statement?
I identify yourself also. Thank
you.
Uh, good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee.
My name is Ruth Porta. I'm a
resident of New Mexico. I am a
Christian, um.
My lord Jesus Christ, and
according to the Bible, abortion
is murder, so I am a woman too.
I won't, I would like to get
access to this information
because I don't want to get
services.
Uh, OBG services from the
provider that performs
abortions. So this is against my
right to know.
This time, yeah. Thank you.
Is there anyone else in
opposition?
We'll go to Zoom.
Nobody, all right, no one.
Now, we'll go back on the bill
and I do have Senator Gallegos
start.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator floor leader.
Doctor, uh, just a couple of
questions, um.
I'd ran a bill, um, actually
one.
Ser Lopez's house got shot and
others, uh, to try to protect
the legislators, and it went
absolutely nowhere.
And uh
I'm just wondering if we have
other doctors or areas in our
state that this would.
Protect or is it just you and
him?
Uh, and I know Las Cruces isn't
built yet.
I'm trying to figure out if it's
a broader area than one office
or
What all this affects, Manchin.
So Mount I can't give you a list
of
Others other than you and them,
but if it's a public
institution. I mean, I think
that's when it kicks in.
So if there were other
Public institutions.
With employees that were
providing these services.
You're correct. This would, this
would apply. So it's not just
I mean, it's for any, any public
institution in my understanding
right now is that UNMH is
is the one that I, I know of
sitting here today.
Ma Charon centered on that, I
guess, uh, even though they
are out there, it's sort of
already.
Protected, we actually don't
know anyone but you having an
age, so, uh, my next question is
uh why now, uh, you know, just
trying to figure out.
Uh, in the, we have gentlemen
from Lee County.
Nick Maxwell.
That is very adamant on Apri
requests. I do not know if this
is Nick Maxwell issue, but uh
he's called cities, counties,
everyone about clarification on
HIPAA releases, uh, I got asked
years ago for a map for the
school board district.
Our school district did not have
one and it called for one.
So then we decided we're gonna
change our uh school boards
structure to have uh no maps,
but everybody be
Open to, you know, the whole
community, uh, so I see some
value in people having IPAs or
or asking questions because it's
clarifying.
Or issues we might have.
But Madam Chair and Senator
floor leader is.
Um, why, why now? Why is it of
importance currently?
So I'm sure, let me just speak
as to why I agreed to introduce
this bill and then I'll let the
Doctors speak specifically.
Uh, I actually was on a Zoom.
With
One of Miss Hofler's colleagues.
And when she was describing the
amount of time she is spending
each week.
And she was describing the types
of requests she was getting from
people that don't live in New
Mexico all over the country.
I just, I was like, this, this
does not make sense to me.
And so
Again, I'm sensitive about
opening up this statute and
we've done it very rarely, but
on occasion in 2019, we did it
for police reports disclosing
rape victims.
And again, it's a policy
decision we each need to make,
but I just
It just
Doesn't make sense as a
professional and as as a lawyer,
as a professional.
have someone who is, as Doctor
Hickey said, is, is here, is
dedicating her life.
Uh, to what she believes in and
then to be spending the amount
of time.
On, on request that.
This is were described to me,
just seemed completely
extraneous designed for a
different purpose.
That's when I said we should see
if we can.
address this, and I can yield
for.
Anything else.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
senators, um, in my experience
being probably the 2nd most
applicable person in the I find
that um if our requests are not
coming from New Mexico
addresses. I don't know if
they're coming from real
addresses at all. They're mostly
PO boxes, not in this state,
from names which may or may not
be true names, but as an
example, this is public record.
Blanco White, um, may or may not
be a person, um, the requests
are becoming more voluminous and
broad.
And um.
And, and
Also specific that make me
concerned about safety. We would
like to see the schedules of all
of the learners and whether or
not and to what extent they
participate in abortion care. We
would like to understand where
people might be working on any
particular day, we would like to
read all of the emails.
That I sent for a series of
months and then, and then I'm
looking through to redact all of
the.
Purpa
The HEPA
The other, um, non-operable
information when I could be
providing patient care or
helping to teach or do any of
those other things that the
state of New Mexico also pays me
to do and probably wants me to
do more.
So that's been my personal
experience, that the volume is
increasing and, um, and I think
the the pinpoint at New Mexico,
particularly from around the
country.
Thank you.
Thanks for that, Madam Chan.
Or later in Doctor, I guess
we've had a bill in here
earlier.
Uh, last week that talked about
domicile.
In Donana.
And I'm wondering why you
couldn't just refer to.
Any Era
In a way that it would just be.
Uh, requested by them.
If they have a current address
or
Uh, something in our state that
to prove the viability or the
need for it.
I'm just wondering if you'd look
through that and cherished.
Or later and doctor, have you
guys looked at that direction
instead of opening up.
April
So man I'm chair senator.
I think that would be.
Opening up the emperor law, I
mean, right now it's very, very
broad.
And again, it's, it basically I
was looking at the statute, and,
you know, the statute.
Uh, 142-1. Every person has a
right to inspect public records
of this state except.
It's a very broad deal, and I
know there's some other, and I
think you may have looked at, I
can't remember which bills you
had in front of you, but
Um
I mean, there, this is an issue
in our local governments have
been trying to figure out the
right lane. This though is such
a specific.
Narrow exception that I think.
To me, it justified.
An exception. And I think it's
interesting, you'll know that we
didn't have a room full.
Of all of the
Open government folks that
normally
That forward
It was silence. I don't want to
speak for anybody, but having
been involved in these bills in
2019 on the other bill, Senator
Lopez is shaking her head. We
had everyone was newspapers did
not want us to.
Put an exception in place to
disclose.
Police reports with rape victims
in them, and I think we made a
policy decision to do that.
I think this is a very, very
narrow.
exception.
Ma turn and floor leader and
doctor, I just, I guess my
thought is there's a way to do
it for New Mexico only.
Uh, I would prefer that over
what we have the Madam Chan sent
floor leader and doctor my
original question is why now?
Um, it shows your EPA request
spiked.
In 2022.
Not in 2025, actually they show
244 and 2022.
76 and 2023.
And 24 in 2024.
So why was this bill not
important enough.
Back in 2022 and now that the
numbers are dropping to 24.
That it's of importance to this
state.
And uh
And to uh have us look at it in
the.
So, I can't speak to the
specific numbers. Maybe the
doctor can.
Um
Had I been aware that this was
the problem that it appears to
be 2 years ago, I would have
introduced the bill then.
again, I just wasn't, it was
brought to my attention and
I said we should introduce a
bill, but I can't speak
specifically to those. Um, can
you speak to the specific
numbers?
Um, thank you, Madam Chair and
senators. I, I can't speak to
the specific numbers, except
that 2022 was a very busy year
with respect to reproductive
health around the country. Um,
and certainly all of the
healthcare providers between the
COVID pandemic and the major
reproductive health legislative
changes around the country
where, um, you know, dealing
with a lot of things all at
once. Um, this has been an in an
ongoing issue, it feels like the
the.
specific
physician targeted IPA requests
have increased even though the
total volume as you see on this
chart looks different, um, and I
can only speak to, you know, my
faculty who I know are dealing
with this work when they should
be doing other work.
Thank you.
Thank you for that, Madam Chair.
Florier and doctor, I was just
trying to get some
understanding. I, I've heard and
I know we're working towards
Trump proofing.
Of the state in abortion is a
state decision. I didn't vote
for it.
But it's a state decision, so
I'm not sure what this does to
Trump proof this or not, but
with that, Madam Chair, I'll
yield.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Oh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator.
Looking through.
This piece of legislation.
Sensitive information related.
To the practice of a medical
providers.
Very, very broad.
My question is,
With this legislation provide.
Protection from
A statistical requests.
That is
Of how many of these procedures
are performed.
Within this department.
Oh
What were the outcomes?
Of these various procedures in
the department.
Is there
A list of uh various providers
and how many providers, how many
of these procedures.
Provider A performed.
And so on and so forth.
It looks like
This should be read as
protecting.
That broad-based data.
As oppose
In, in addition, individual.
Names and
Thank you, um, Madam Chair and
Senator, um, you know, I, I.
When I'm thinking about.
Clinician safety and um the
types of sensitive information
which might make someone a
target.
Certainly in my mind, how many
abortion procedures did Doctor A
perform and in what context and
Doctor B, you know that feels
like it.
It the spirit of this would
address that public safety, you
know, to that level of
granularity to to.
Prevent that person's
information from coming out and
from that person from being
targeted. The state, um, the
Department of Health already
collects this information
statistically, and, um, and of
course everyone around the state
who provides, you know, anything
related to pregnancy outcomes,
you know, there are vital
statistics for births and for
pregnancy loss and for abortion,
um, and all of that is already.
So what would the answer to the
question be that
The number of procedures
performed.
In your department.
Would that be
detective.
Madam, Madam Chair and senator,
you know, I actually now that I
think about it, don't know that
such a document or responsive
document exists that there is a
public record that lists every
physician and what exact
procedures and abortions they
have performed so, you know, IPA
requires the inspection of
public records, but it doesn't
require the creation of new
records.
And so, um, so I think on an
aggregate statistical level, uh,
it, it may not, um, and again,
I'm, I'm not a lawyer. I'm a
doctor who's answered IPA
requests, and so I'm speaking a
little bit about my own
experience.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, and
doctor, those records.
Would in fact exist as a
Normal course of.
Carrying on your business.
Is that accurate?
Um, madam chair and senator.
I don't actually think so, like
Doctor Hofler provided this many
abortions and Doctor SB provided
this many abortions and doctor
Scott provided this many
abortions, um.
You know, the, the data that we
have are not that granular,
certainly you could have
individual, you know, did this
person was on my clinical
schedule and did I care for them
that day and that's HIPAA
protected.
But the aggregate numbers, we
don't always have um records of
in that way.
Mm
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, and
Doctor, that.
Really does.
Surprise me
That you
Wouldn't have that information.
Available for statistical
analysis.
As a matter of.
As a matter of
Your normal course of business.
Because
I suppose those records could
prove valuable.
Identifying.
Uh
Substandard care or.
pattern
If you will, a substandard care.
Thank you.
Of your answers, Doctor and
senator. Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, Senator Nava.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator for bringing the
bill forward.
Um, I do have a question and
also want to acknowledge, um,
the reality of the times in
which we live.
Uh, Madam Chairwoman, I think
it's very clear that we are not
mentioning.
The situation in which we are in
terms of
Policies that aim to criminalize
reproductive healthcare across
the country. And being in a
state that provides abortions
and abortion care.
Looking at our medical
providers, or OBGYNs, looking at
our issues with recruitment and
retain retainment of medical
professionals.
Um, I think it would be in our
best interest to ensure that we
are protecting these providers,
uh, Madam Chair, uh, my question
would be, uh, if, uh, Madam
Chair and Senator and doctor,
has there been an increase in
IPRA requests since the Dobbs B.
Jackson Supreme Court decision
overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair and
senator. Uh, there have.
Not to my knowledge been um.
There wasn't a spike you'll see.
Um, in the UNM agency bill
analysis, they include a graph
that sort of has.
A river requests related to the
UNM Center for Reproductive
Health, which is where, um, most
abortion care happens at UNM,
but not necessarily the specific
physicians being targeted, which
anecdotally, this is why I, I
answered the senator earlier
that we've felt an escalation
since that time just in requests
for.
Any information, multiple
requests, voluminous requests
for that feel very broad.
That feel targeted to us too.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, doctor. Um, I would like to
note.
That
Data is available out there on
the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists
website about the increase, um,
of incidents, um, in terms of
looking at the time frame after
2022, when Roe v. Wade was
overturned. Um, so I would
encourage folks to look at that
and look at the scrutiny that
these OBGYNs are put through, so
I would think the sponsor for
bringing this forward, um, and
thank you for uh representing
our OBGYNs and medical
providers.
in this fashion. And, uh, Madam
Chairwoman, um,
Thank you. Also, I wanted to
thank the, um, the sponsor.
For ensuring that the voices of
many folks who are unheard are
at the table.
Thank you. Any other questions?
Senator
In office
Thank you, um, I guess I just
wanna make a comment, and I
think IPR is such an important
statue, it's such a good idea.
However, it really pains me to
see how it's been weaponized in
so many contexts.
And this to me is just fighting
back on the weaponization of it.
Um, it's unfortunate that it's
been used this way, um, and so
I'm happy to support this bill.
Thank, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you.
Uh, what is the wish of the
committee?
Senator Nava with a motion for a
due pass with the second from
Senator Seria Lopez.
We still are in discussion. Yes,
Senators for a 2nd time.
Madam Chair, thank you and uh
Senator Nova had brought up a
really good point, and I just
wanted to clarify for her page
two of the University of New
Mexico.
Analysis
Stated that in 2022, there's
fear44IPAA requests, and they
dropped to 23 at 76 requests in
2024.
With only 24 request so it looks
after the Dobbs decision, they
fell off the map, but Madam
Chair in center of my actual
question for you was the
reimbursement for services, uh,
Mearian center and Doctor You
said that they don't keep track
of Doctor A doing these
procedures, Doctor B doing. How
do you get reimbursed for
Uh, jobs and she actually you
don't keep track of.
Madam Chair and Senator, um.
I, I.
My impression is that there are
specific sort of line items,
right? You create a uh.
Uh
Bill that includes all of the
services provided, you know, 9
months of prenatal care and then
in hospital admission and
delivery and postpartum care.
And you, you've affixed whoever
has provided that care and you
send it away with the codes to
be to the insurance company as a
claim.
And I think that sort of line
item document exists, but the
aggregate data was what Senator
Scott was asking about, do I
have aggregate data of
Of, of provider A, provider B,
Provider C to my knowledge, I do
not have such a document, and so
they're IPR doesn't require me
to produce that and um if there
was such a document, I think it
would also lead physicians again
to be targeted and unsafe.
Which was the intent.
Thank you for that, Madam Chair
and Senator and doctor, I
appreciate that. I was just
trying to get down to that
because I couldn't understand
how you could, I, I understand
not having it available, you'd
stated you, uh, when the emperor
that's not something you build
up a format for.
But I was just wondering how you
get credit for services due or
or.
Uh, issues, uh, resolved, so
with that I yield. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you. And we're still in
discussion.
For a 2nd time, Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
Thank you, doctor, for that. I
I understand some people would
probably want
Doctor
Many whatever it is, I think.
When Senator Scott was asking
the question of
What are you, what are you
keeping track of in regards to
various procedures. Can I, can I
assume, Madam Chair, Doctor,
that you keep track of how many
people come through your door
for.
Broad treatment of whatever it
is to to receive some type of
Healthcare, or some type of
procedure.
I assume that.
Madam Chair and senator, um,
yes, so I can tell you how many
arrived visits I had on any
specific day. OK. Thank you,
doctor. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Can I assume that you keep track
of.
Again, I don't know what you do
there. We've only been talking
about abortion. I don't know if
you provide some type of um
And where you put your little
thing over our belly, um.
What do you call that?
What?
Appreciate the participation
from the audience. Um, Madam
Chair, Doctor, do you, do you
keep track of how many
ultrasounds you do?
And Madam Chair and senator, it
is, it is an equivalent
question, um, to, to Senator
Scott's question earlier, um,
and to my knowledge, if you
asked.
Um, I, I don't know that there's
a responsive document for any
type of procedure.
For example. Thank you, thank
you, Madam Chair.
Go ahead, I'm sorry. No, I might
say I'm, I might not be the
right person to answer that
because I'm here, you know, to
speak about specifically, but I,
but I don't know. OK, um, Madam
chair, uh, Doctor, let me ask it
uh this way.
What do you keep track of?
At
Madam Cha Senator, um.
You know, you and I, and I'm
Center for Reproductive Health,
UNM Hospital, um.
Tracks
A lot of different things. There
are quality outcomes. There are
a number of patient visits.
There are a number of like
inpatients per year and
outpatients per year. There are
a number of employees and
numbers of faculty. You know, I
think, I think that's a very
general question about kind of
what do we keep track of how
many faculty are there, all of
that, um, so, so I'm not sure
what you're asking. Yes, OK.
Thank you, doctor. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Um.
In in all transparency, my wife
works.
At UNM Health through Sandoval
Regional. So, um, just wanna
make, make that public, um.
So, Madam Chad, uh, doctor, can
I assume then?
That, you know, you have a
budget.
Uh, correct?
OK.
Thank you, uh, doctor. Thank
you, Madam Chair. So can I
assume in that budget,
throughout the year, you guys
have to.
Program or budget for certain
things, so you are keeping track
of different things that you
have to budget for, whether you
see a surge in something or
Or a dip in something, you do
keep track of that too.
To ask for a certain amount of a
line item in a budget, uh, can I
assume that?
But that would just be good good
government.
Madam Chair and senator, yes, we
do have budgets.
Thank, thank you, doctor. Thank
you, Madam Chair. So,
Um
Building those budgets.
Would, and having those line
items with various different
budgets.
Would, would those be and maybe
Senator Worth knows this.
Would, would, uh, the public be
able to IPRA.
That with the cost associated
with those line items in the
budget.
With this bill
So, Madam Chair, and multiple
questions there, I think that
certainly.
general budget is something
that.
Could be Irod.
I think the uh the internal
documents again, this is
In the doctor's.
World
Not mine, I think under this
bill.
If they're, if there were
specific internal documents, and
I think she's saying she
doesn't.
Know the answer to that, yeah,
that that.
If this bill passes, then those
specific.
What what
Senator Scott was looking for if
those documents did exist,
potentially they would be
protected under this bill.
So this is, we talked about
this. I mean, you've got a
budgeting side to it, you've
got.
The individual document side to
it.
Thanks, Senator Wirth. Uh, thank
you, Madam Chair, yeah, because
when I, when I look at the
budget, like for instance, um,
as a, as a county commissioner
for 8 years in Sandoval.
You know, each department has a
line item.
Uh, in their budget, behavioral
health, public works, whatever
it is.
And not only are they posted on
the web.
Uh, cause there's really no
private information in regards
to a budget you're shaking your
head, you would agree to that.
That, that was, that was my
question is, those are budget
items, they're not personal
information or really sensitive,
so when, when the public be able
to
Ask for that information.
Ma'am, to the extent that
they're not.
Sensitive and it's public and
it's part of the budget process.
I think that wouldn't fall under
this.
Thank you, sir. Thank you,
doctor. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. You could call the
roll, please.
Senator.
No.
Senator Boone? No.
Charlie.
Gallegos.
Center Nova. Yes, the Pinto.
And enerio Lopez. Yes.
Senator Hickey.
Senor Lopez. Yes.
By about a 63 senator, you have
a GP pass recommendation.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, members. Thank you.
Senator Padilla, good evening.
You are here for Senate Bill 58.
And Bill 58. Yes.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee, and I
do want to remind you that we do
have a uh committee substitute
that we presented to your
committee on February 4th. Do
you have that?
Uh, yes, Senator, we do have the
committee substitute. OK. Would
you like to present the original
bill, or do you wish just to go
ahead and move forward with the
committee substitute.
I substitute and I can explain
why it was important to do that.
OK. Uh, thank you very much,
Madam Chair, and I do have with
me as experts.
I need to do the procedure.
So
I will need a motion if someone
can.
Or the chair can do it.
Um, we do not pass on Senate
Bill 58 for purposes of
discussion, but then a due pass
for Senate Health and Public
Affairs Committee substitute for
Senate Bill 58.
Which is 0.230043.3.
So with that, Senator, you.
Please proceed with presenting
the committee substitute. Thank
you very much, Madam Chair and
members of vice chair and
ranking member.
Um
As an overall statement on
Senate Bill 58, essentially it
strengthens the statutory
framework for a universal high
quality early childhood system
by reducing administrative
burden for providers
streamlining process,
streamlining process is an
improving access to services.
For our family as you families,
as you know, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, we did
make a very large decision about
6 years ago.
Move forward and create an early
childhood education and care
department and uh I know, Madam
Chair, you and I both worked on
a lot of things in this year and
many others did too. And as a
result, we continue to further
professionalize the workforce
and the options made available
to families and um and so our
our work now is on a facility
licensing and how can we raise
that to the highest level
quality standard to ensure that
the service is being delivered
are meeting those requirements.
The substitute moves ECECD's
existing childcare facility
licensing Authority from the
Public Health Act to the
Children's Code and adds a
couple of updates. It creates a
procurement exemption for
purchase of child care by ECECD.
It updates the pre-kindergarten
Act to provide for continuity of
care and inclusion in services
for 3 year olds with IEPs and
those on in Head Start and puts
current pre-K educator
qualifications in the pre-K Act.
And then 4th is one of the more
important it clarifies that ECC
is the department which the
childcare facility Licensing Act
applies.
Um, and Madam Chair, I think,
you know, just as an overall set
of statements on why we're doing
this and why we're coming to you
with this is, it does, it
encapsulates all the licensing
requirements, inspection
protocols, uh, training and
certification and then there are
enforcement measures when those
are not being met for whatever
reason, some of the more um
important um issues that are
addressed here in this
legislation or that we enhance
child safety. We improve quality
of care. Uh, we're gonna build,
continue to build public
confidence.
So that the adoption of these
services across the state
continues to grow and increase
and then of course, consistency
across
Uh, facilities.
Um, further professionalizing
ECCD services is a huge step
forward because, you know, we do
have other measures in this
legislature, in this session
that we're considering right
now, much like the one that we
passed through the rules
committee earlier today to make
sure that the funding is always
there in perpetuity. So that's
essentially what the legislation
does, that's what the substitute
does. And I'm gonna ask the
secretary to say a couple of
words and then we'll move
whatever direction you like.
Oh, good afternoon, uh, evening,
madam Chair, members of the
committee, thank you, Senator
Padilla for sponsoring the
childcare facility licensing
Act, um, as, as he said, uh, the
main part of the licensing and
is moving why it says new
material, it's moved from the
Public Health Act to the
Children's code.
And we realized this was
necessary last year when the
healthcare authority was being
formed, and we almost lost all
of our authority in that, and
then they did a substitute, so
it was really this body that
said you really need to codify
your authority, uh, in the
children's code and so that's
what the main part, not newly
that we're licensing childcare
facilities, we have been doing
it, but it's now under and then
just I think Senator Padilla
laid out everything. The other
really important thing is we're
moving to 3 year licenses, so
that.
was one thing that we, you know,
the administrative burden piece
also the procurement code
exemption is to align with the
pre-K exemption we have to allow
us to pay providers
prospectively like a private uh
tuition paying family would you
come in to get your services,
you pay for that month that
you're getting services. That's
another good support for our
childcare industry and also
allowing them as we do with
pre-K to have childcare
contracted slots, making it more
um easy for providers of all
sizes.
To be able to um come and join
and be competitive um for those
for those contracted slots.
So with that, um, I will stand
for questions. I will say, Madam
Chair, that um in leading up to
you scheduling us, we did have
conversations with virtually
everybody in the committee. We
had some great feedback that
came from uh the minority here
in the committee and and we uh
we have an agreements on various
things that we will continue to
work on should we get through
here today. So thank you.
Uh, thank you. Um, we do have a
committee, we do have a sub,
what do you call it an
amendment.
Um, but if I may.
Um, Senator Gallegos.
There's an amendment that we
have from you.
But it was to the original bill.
Right
Madam Chair, thank you, we were
not doing that. Uh, there's some
discussion.
Before
After he did his uh sub.
That uh there's a little bit of
clarification, but it'll be
handled in the next committee.
OK. All right.
If we were to get through all
the paperwork, so we will
thank you for clarifying that.
Thank you so much.
I'd uh not even considered it
because I thought everyone was
in the loop, but.
That's already been in
discussion for later.
Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate
you clarifying that, Madam
Chair. Thank you. Just to make
sure we.
I clarify.
OK, so then with that, we'll go
to the audience. Is there anyone
here in support.
Of Senate Bill 58, the committee
substitute, yes, would you like
to come forward and make a
statement?
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Barbara Linaedro and I'm
a provider in Farmington, New
Mexico for 25 years, and more
importantly, I am policy chair
for the New Mexico Early
Childhood Association, which
represents over 1/3 of the
licensed childcare centers in
the state of New Mexico.
With this piece of legislation,
we have worked very hard. If you
take a look at the substitute
before you, there are some
changes that have been made and
that is through the work
together with the sponsor and
with the department. We are
private providers, we are the
people on the ground doing the
work and when we took a look at
this bill, we did have some
concerns and we were hurt.
The important thing to remember
here. There are still some
tweaks that we would like to
see, but we have gotten word
from the sponsor and from the
department that they will sit
and listen to us if this has
moved on. The thing that I would
urge is to see that we have
worked very hard on this piece
of legislation. It's not
perfect, but we won't, don't
want to stop the momentum. If we
do not pass it out of this
committee, we will be losing the
very important aspects that we
need to move forward. There are
some things that we would like
to continue to work on and we
and I urge you strongly to
please support and pass it on to
the next committee. Thank you.
Thank you. And I'm not a pro, so
I need to read.
Um, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Daisy Lita
and I own Bubble Bee Learning
Center, New Mexico Children
First and the higher education,
uh, down south in Southern Park.
I'm also the vice chair for Full
Circle Advocacy group that
represents uh home providers and
childcare centers in the South.
We do want to thank the sponsor,
Senator Palia for being a true
leader in the early childhood
education, and for always
ensuring those of us working
closest with the children that
are included in these important
issues.
I also want to recognize
Secretary ginsky for her
commitment on this bill and with
her department to partner with
us.
And truly do what's best for our
youngest, New Mexicans. We stand
in support for SB 58, we believe
that accountability is crucial
in child care field as a safety
and the security of the children
is paramount.
This bill strikes a balance
between protecting businesses
that provide quality care in
ensuring accountability for
those that do not.
It also brings stability in
programs budgets while ensuring
that we comply with the changes
in the federal mandate for
slots-based funding. Please vote
yes on SB 58.
Thank you. Is there anyone else
in support?
Audience.
Anyone in opposition?
See none. Is there anyone on
Zoom?
I'm sorry I didn't have.
Your
Uh, Deborah Baca.
chair
Members of the Senate House.
Committee
I'm Deborah Baca, vice president
of the YDI Early Childhood
Education and Family Development
Division, and I always emphasize
and family development because
we cannot do this very important
work.
Of educating our youngest
children without the full
engagement of our parents, our
caregivers, and our guardians.
Why did I operates 26 licensed
centers in New Mexico and
Bernalillo, Ria Riba, and Taos.
We've provided high quality
services for 30 years. Why do I
stands in support of Senate Bill
58 for several reasons. One, it
allows Head Start to serve
children that turn 3 and also
children with IEPs who are
enrolled in the Mexico pre-K
whenever they turn 3 years old.
We also support the change in
licenses from
annual to a 3-year licensing.
Well also maintaining annual
licensing visits with 26 centers
and all different licensing
dates. This will streamline our
paperwork and under teacher
qualifications, we support the
flexibility and qualifications
due to staff shortages and
competition for early educators.
We appreciate the flexibility to
build our workforce while
they're enrolled in early
childhood courses for their BA
and their AA degree.
I want to thank Senator Padilla
and Secretary Gurginsky for
listening to Head Start, as
we're allowed to voice our
opinions, suggestions,
recommendations, working through
this process for the best
interests of our children and
families. Thank you.
Thank you.
There was um
Yes? OK.
And with that, we'll go to.
From committee members. Senator
said the Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for bringing this bill
forward, um.
And if, if you got this in the.
Amendments. I'm, I'm sorry, I'm
really just looking fast. But as
I read the last one, I didn't
see that there was um.
A provision where if somebody uh
like to correct something before
they lose their license or
before they get a fine, a
procedure.
Cause it seems normal to me that
you would say, hey, um.
You need to do something like
that furniture or hey, you need
to be whatever, um.
There's a safety issue here, you
need to fix it.
Before, before there's any
consequence, and I, I didn't see
it in the last one. If it's
here, I apologize. I did. Is, is
that
Madam Chair and uh Senator Salio
Lopez, that is one of the
primary um
Points that we're having in
discussion with the association,
um, there was also, uh, so we,
we have, and I'm gonna ask the
department now to talk about,
you know, what we have agreed to
up to this point.
There do need to be penalties of
some kind, but I'm totally with
you. I'm a business owner
myself. You can't.
Hit me with a fine and not give
me an opportunity to turn that
thing around and uh a fine has
actually um as I understand it,
it's never actually been
followed all the way through
because most uh are all have
been given the opportunity to
repair the situation. I think we
should formalize that. I think
it should be something that's uh
to know what to expect in that
area. So I'll ask the department
to comment on that, but that's
when you heard from Barbara
Tedro, the president of the
association, saying that, you
know, we're working together on
a few things. We still have a
little bit of work to do on
that.
I'm secretary.
Madam Chair, um, Senator Sidia
Lopez, I'm gonna ask our general
counsel. Thank you, Madam Chair,
uh, senator.
The, uh, that that has not been
included and we have reviewed
some language that was proposed
related to you. Thank you so
much, um, so there, uh, we are
reviewing language that um would
require that, um, it gets a
little bit tricky because if a
opportunity to correct any
violation, um, prior to any
sanction were to be included,
then even the most severe
violations, we wouldn't be able
to take action, also.
It could become very difficult
for us to have an encouragement
for facilities to follow those
regulations prior to us coming
and then pointing out all the
things that they need to work
on, and then they say, OK, well,
we'll we'll fix those, but
there's no incentive for them to
have been complying.
Prior to us being there. But
what we do, um, on a regular
basis is when we do the survey
visits, when we go into the
centers, we will look and, you
know, right up, these are the
things, you know, we'll work
with you on them. The sanctions
that you were talking about the,
the monetary sanctions in
regulation actually have a
pretty strong um requirement for
us to issue a sanction and every
level of sanction requires
either uh
A possibility of serious bodily
injury or actually bodily injury
or abuse or neglect. It's
actually very structured as to
when we can issue those civil
monetary sanctions in the
regulations, um, so there's some
space to work in there, but that
is how we currently use the
civil monetary penalties. And
what they said is most of the
time, all all the time they are
given the opportunity when we
issue those sanctions to use
those sanctions to improve
part of the facility that may
be, um, needed to be adjusted to
help them continue compliance.
They don't have to do that if
they choose, they can also pay
the sanction and within a
certain amount of time and then
it's cut in half. So we have
multiple ways that we continue
to work with the centers, rather
than just
Slapping them with a fine.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I
haven't looked at the
regulations and, and like you
said, um, you have authority to
make the regulations to
implement it.
Um
But yeah, that it's just, that's
the only thing, of course I, I
support it and I just thank you,
ma'am.
Thank you. Other questions? Um,
Senator Gallegos before Senator
Black.
I'm sure.
I'm sure, thank you.
Center and uh Madam Secretary,
uh, just a few questions, so,
uh.
Earlier, Madam Secretary, you'd
stated that you're trying to
codify the authority in
Children's code. This all of the
information is currently in the
health code. Is that not right?
in Senator.
Madam Sharon, that's correct,
what you just described.
And this clarifies that so that
there's no
Gray area it's where it needs to
be.
A man senator and
Madam Secretary, what caused the
discrepancy you want to take
from health to children's
school.
What caused that
Mo
Shaing center, I didn't set it
up right to begin with.
And it needs to be corrected,
but, but yeah.
Uh, madam chair, Senator
Gallegos, thank you for that
question. Um, originally, uh,
the
Child's, um, the ability to
license child facilities and um.
Have the inspections and all of
the other authority lived in the
Public Health Act along with the
um the CYFD, I think it was a
holdover Department of Health is
a part of that for their health
facilities as well. Um, when you
see ECD was created, there was
an under there was a
thought that all of that
authority got transferred to the
Children's code, but it hadn't.
Um, so when the healthcare
authority was created, and that,
um, authority for the healthcare
facilities was moved over to the
healthcare Authority Act. They,
um, we're going to delete the
rest of the Public Health Act
areas where we actually had our
authority, and we came and we're
like, you know, please just
leave that part there and move
the healthcare authority, but
leave this part there. And at
that time, the legislature
legislative body that committee
suggested, you know, you really
should move this to the
children's code so that this is
protected and it doesn't happen
again, so that's part of why
we're here today.
Thank you for that, madam chair
and Senator.
And our legal adviser, uh, I
appreciate that because my
concern is there's something we
always, even with the best
intentions we have unintended
consequences, so I, I'm grateful
you're looking into that. I do
have, uh, my next question, I'm
chairing Senator is during uh
the.
Entry won't when you guys are
talking about this, uh, I
believe you had said this would
build confidence in the foster
care system.
Could you explain to me how this
change would do that?
Madam Chair,
Senator Adam and senator, I
don't believe I said the word.
We could look back at the tape,
but but I guess it's also
possible because I
And a whole other giant effort
and build just a few moments ago
related to fostering, so it's
possible, but, but I meant
confidence in the in the world.
Oh, I, I, I think I'm this mask
might have.
muffled my words, but confidence
in the adoption.
Of early education services by
New Mexico families because as
you know, you've been here as
long as I have senator and Madam
Chair here a little bit longer
than us, of the adoption for
early education services was a
very slow effort. Folks didn't
know what to expect on visiting
as an example. What do you mean?
You're going to come into my
home and tell me how to raise
my, that kind of stuff. So I
believe that by further
professionalizing you're going
to see more confidence in the
adoption of
The services that are provided
by this department.
Maybe that's where it got a
little confused.
Um, Madam Chair and senator, I
appreciate it. It's probably
like another colleague of mine
uses uh assumption before, uh, I
may have heard adoption and then
uh foster care, so I apologize
for that. Uh, I do, um.
Wonder why in the bill.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator,
there's a restriction on 4
children and less.
Is there a reason for that, uh,
give you a little background. My
mom had 5 boys.
But she uh also.
Uh, cared for 5 kids.
Uh, along with us when we moved
to Denver and I think there's a
lot of for me uh.
Those 5 children are still
really good friends with us
because we are sort of raised
together, uh, but it was her and
a friend of hers that did it
from home and just wondered why
the restriction on 4 and if
there's a reason for that and
send.
I'll ask the uh council or legal
counsel to address that. We were
literally rehearsing with this
answer might be in the hallway
before we came in here. So why
don't we have that uh
description. Thanks.
Yes, Madam Chair, uh, Senator
Gaos, thank you, uh, for that
question. Um.
But you for or I'm sorry, 4 or
fewer, uh, non-resident children
can be cared for in a home
without needing to be licensed.
It's kind of the national
standard. It's, um, also, uh,
the standard for the federal
requirements, and this is for or
fewer non-resident children. So
you can have 5 kids and then
also care for for or fewer
non-resident children. The
standard in New Mexico has been
more than 4 non-resident
children.
need to be licensed since back
since forever when the licensing
authority, um, existed with
CYFD. I think back in the 90s is
when um that standard was set.
It wasn't explicit in the public
health.
Why we're including it in our
definitions now, is because
that's been the practice. It's
what uh the system is built
around and it's uh the national
best practice. Well thank you
for that, man.
Certain Madam Chair center and
our expert witness, uh, I
appreciate that it's a national
standard, uh, looking back, and
these were in the 70s, we
actually use that money to put
food on the table. How much more
important is that here now?
As the escalation of costs, so I
just wanted to make sure we
wouldn't put
was at home of uh daycare
issues, uh, out of business but
that was my last question, Madam
Chairing your highly surprised.
Thank you, Madam and we've been
very sensitive to that because
we know that
Communities across New Mexico do
it in many different ways. So,
thank you.
Thank you, Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
thank you, Senator Padilla for
sponsoring this.
Um
There, there was some
interesting when I was, uh,
looking through the bill in
regards to the procurement code.
There it looked like there are
some additional risk in there in
the uh procurement code and then
I was just checking the analysis
as well. Can you tell me what
the difference is.
Um, in regards to the
procurement process.
For this bill compared to what
we're doing
before the council to address
that, but really what the, the,
the uh sections related to
procurement were simply to
Document everything and to
clarify it and to further
streamline it, but I'd like some
more.
That's what a politician would
say. I want to make sure that we
get the right legal answer.
That's a great answer,
uh, Madam Chair, Senator Black,
thank you. Uh, the
What we've been doing now, um,
is we would for contracted slots
and for childcare assistants.
One is that due to the
requirements of the procurement
code is we pay them after the
fact. And private, you know,
families when they go in for
childcare, they're gonna be
paying prospectively, they're
gonna pay at the beginning of
the month for the month's
services, right? That sort of
industry standard, but due to
limitations of the procurement
code we currently can't do that
for a childcare assistant's
family.
So we then have to pay after the
fact and we pay sort of we we
have the contract with the
family and then we pay the
center on behalf of the family.
So, and the other thing that we
do is that when we have
contracted slots, so we have
slots available in child care
centers for people with
childcare assistance. Um, we are
issuing an RFP which, if anyone
has ever tried to do an RFP. It
is a very cumbersome process.
Um
Right now for our
pre-kindergarten, um,
procurements, we have an
exemption from the procurement
code, as you can see in that
section, and we use an
application process that's still
competitive process, but it's a
much more friendly reduced
process. And so what we wanna do
is use that same process for our
childcare centers for the
childcare assistance slots. So
one, we can pay them
prospectively or, uh, we can pay
them earlier, the same as the
private industry and so that we
can um be stream.
line d in the process of have
the same, the childcare programs
that know how to apply for the
pre-K programs are going to be
able to know how to apply for
the childcare assistance slots,
and it just makes it easier for
even the smaller, more rural
communities and the smaller
providers to actually compete on
that larger level.
OK. Thank you, uh, counsel.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
Can, can I assume the way this
particular bill is written on
the procurement side.
That you could take that model.
And apply it to
Madam Chair and senator, that is
possible, yes. OK. Thank you,
sir. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
That, that makes me a little bit
nervous because, I mean,
I, I want to
We had a very robust.
Procurement process at the
county a little bit tighter than
what the state has.
And you always wanna, you always
get a little nervous on
procurement and.
This perception can be reality
viewed by citizens of so so and
so knows commissioner so and so
or a state rep so and so, so
they get that contract.
Um, because the RFP process is
so, so vital, vital importance
as well as making sure bids are
sealed and source selection is,
is fair.
Uh, that, that concerns me a
little bit. Um,
So, uh, let me put that aside.
Um, Madam Chair, uh, senator.
The
Are the penalties the same for
licensed and non-licensed uh
data.
Ah, Madam Chair, Senator Black.
I guess you're gonna answer
the lawyer.
I am, um, currently the
penalties and under the Public
Health Act, um, we have
different types of penalties
that we can use. We can issue a
conditions of operation. Here's
how we want you to do things to
come into compliance. We can
issue sanctions, um, we can do a
suspension or revocation, those
types of things. Those are
things that we would do for an
unlicensed censor, we would
issue a cease and desist, um,
and tell them you have
To stop operating. Currently
under the Public Health Act, any
violation of rule or even
operating a childcare center in
an unlicensed way is a criminal
act. It's a petty misdemeanor,
and that's in the Public Health
Act now. What this proposal
would do, would actually reduce
the criminal liability for
providers who are operating with
um with a license, so if they
violate a rule, they're not
subject to any criminal
penalties, just the other
penalties like the conditions of
operation that we've been
talking about.
that someone who is operating a
childcare facility unlicensed,
who's been given a cease and
desist isn't is failing to
assist and is continuing to
operate, we would be able to use
those criminal penalties.
Thank you, uh, counselor. Thank
you, Madam Chair. So this, this
particular bill increases.
The penalty from
50 to 10,000, is that, is that
correct? Well, Madam Chair and
Senator, we're, we're actually
in the middle of working on
that. You are, OK, yeah, I
actually felt like
They were being a little too
tough, so OK, so that, that
part, Senator, sorry to
interrupt you, that's going to
be worked out in the policy
after the association and
I'll I'll withdraw that then,
so.
Um
Just out of curiosity, uh, Madam
Chair, Senator Padilla, cause
you said an interesting thing as
a business owner, when the state
comes down or or the city or
county comes down to your
business and they find you, they
should give you an opportunity.
Have we had in um your
department, Madam Secretary,
with these fines. Have you, have
we actually fined anybody?
Uh, in these finds.
Uh, I'm sorry, um.
In this area
We have find um in cases where a
child was injured or, um,
significant, you know, seriously
hurt or injured, uh, spines in
those cases, but again,
oftentimes if they pay it up
early, it's in half or they're
gonna invest the fine in fixing
the problem, and we work with
them on that way.
OK. Thank you for that answer.
I also appreciate Senator
Padilla looking at these fines
because, I mean, doubling is
very burdensome on on these
businesses, but sometimes they
might deserve it. I mean, it
could be that egregious where
it's like, no, you ain't getting
second chance, uh, nor should
you.
So I, I appreciate you guys
going back and looking at that,
um, I'm sorry, yes, sir. And
Madam Chair and Senator, I think
you're absolutely right. You hit
the nail right on the head.
I have found in working with
this department from its
infancy, no pun intended, uh,
that they are always finding
ways to support these facilities
cause we want the further
expansion, as I mentioned
earlier with Senator Gallegos,
the adoption, the further
adoption of these services, um,
and, and I think it's a
beautiful thing that when the
fines do occur, they're given an
option to
Essentially reinvest that fine
into their own business to make
sure that that's where the
correction goes, where the money
goes.
Um, so I think, I think it's a
really good, and, and I felt
like, you know, doubling the
fine was just outrageous. And so
I think that we're, we're we're
very close to how that's going
to work and you'll hear more
about that if we get out of
here.
Thank
you thank you plan to get out of
here, but we get out,
um, I, I think that's uh very
well said because a lot of these
small businesses can't absorb.
A $10,000 fine and probably not
a $5000 fine because a lot of
these businesses, um,
From what I've talked to them,
we're working on the margins,
and they're trying to do a good
job and going back and looking
at this, I'm more than willing
to support this bill.
Even though I'm a little nervous
that the policy hasn't been
completely worked out yet and
the procurement code to me
increases some liability.
Um, and I would ask, uh, Senator
Padilla and Madam Secretary.
That you just go back in uh in
this bill uh before it comes to
this and I'll support it today.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair, thank
you Senator um and secretary for
bringing this forward. I have a
couple of questions related to
section 4 beginning on page 5.
one-ish, it can starts at the.
925 says A, but we can just go
to lane one, temporary license
shall not be issued for a period
exceeding 120 days, nor shall
more than 2 consecutive
temporary licenses.
Be issued to the same childcare
facility. I understand the
intent, but what if it is?
ECECD or the licensing. What if
it's us who can't get over there
and get them a a second
inspection related to that
violation, and we shut down that
childcare facility for all of
the parents and children that
are there. Thank you, Chair and
Senator, I just want to make
sure maybe I got a little bit
lost, but did you say page 5.
Oh I'm at the right one.
I think, I don't know if you're
looking at the substitute or the
actual original.
vi ll e
It is in this, OK, we can
address it, but I just want to
make sure that we're tracking
with your question. OK, very
good.
Go ahead.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair,
Senator Charlie, thank you so
much. um, so this is the
language that is currently in
the Public Health Act. Um, so
there is no change here, um.
It, we give them time to, um,
it, it.
Trying to answer, um, the exact
question which is if
We can't ECECD can't get to a
center in time to renew a
temporary license.
Would we hold them accountable
for that? And the answer is, um,
is no. We wouldn't shut them
down because we weren't able to
make it out there on time that
has not happened currently in
this, this is what's in the
existing law. Um, so we would
either make it out there or give
them an extension of that time.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
well, then this may be existing
law to in section D,
the department uh line 18 may
charge the childcare facility or
license exempt childcare
facility, a reasonable fee not
to exceed.
$1000. I think like that's a lot
of.
Discretion between a reasonable
fee and a
Uh, that was more of a comment,
I think. Madam Chair, Senator
Charlie, thank you. Um, there's
also a requirement that a tiered
structure be adopted in rule by
the department on what those
fees will be. So a small home, I
think currently pays like $15
for a licensing fee. These these
are gonna be increased to 3 year
licenses, um, the fees might go
up a little bit because they're
only gonna have to pay every 3
years, but it, it, we would be
required to put in rule what
that tiered licensing structure
is.
And so the um reasonable fee, uh
that is the current language,
but the tiered requirement for
the tiered structure is new
language that we're including
now so that it stays in rural
and there's public comment on
it, and it's um.
It's, it's a transparent
process.
So there's likely to be, I'm
guessing 3 tiers at a minimum.
And it's not to exceeded. Thank
you for that clarity, madam.
Yes.
Thank you. Um, and then my last
question, and it really is for
my own understanding and not
understanding how it works right
now, Madam Chair, um, sex
section 6 starting on line 16
with particular attention to
lines.
Beginning at 18, so a childcare
facility without a license.
In violation of the act.
It's guilty of a petty
misdemeanor and she'll be
punished by a fine not to exceed
$500.
Or imprisonment in the county
jail for a definitive term I.
Um, I have a real hesitancy of
engaging the carceral system for
perhaps a childcare provider who
is um
Like, uh, Senator Gallegos's
example about, you know, taking
care of 5 kids, but you've got 5
kids on your own, just some
unintended consequences here
makes me a little bit nervous.
I'm definitely gonna have our
council address that one just
because of what it is, but, but
I will say that there's, there's
a lot changing and moving on
that one. OK.
Madam Chair, Senator Charlie,
thank you for that question. So
currently under the Public
Health Act, this, um, same
language actually applies to
those who are licensed as well
and just simply violate a rule
of the department, which we
definitely thought was excessive
and not something that we have
historically used or even want
the power to use, which is why
we've reduced this simply to
only when they're operating
without a license. So it's not
providers, um, that are
operating within the law, which
is far fewer non-resident
children. So if you have 5 kids
of your own and then for, you
know, watching 9 Kids, that's
not gonna be a violation, um, in
practice, what happens is is
that we go out and there's a
cease and desist process in here
as well. And we would go out and
issue a cease and desist and
tell them you are operating
without a license. We need you
to stop. We give them all the
information on how to become
licensed. We work with them on
becoming licensed, um, and then
if they choose not to become
licensed and.
to operate in often very unsafe
ways, um, and with that outside
of the um the law.
Very, very, very few times I
think I remember once in a very,
very long time ago when I used
to work at CYFD and that this
was actually used and
We needed the
The criminal penalty for um
those actions, but it's not
something that's used very often
and we really do want to reduce
it only to those serious
situations where they're
operating without a license.
Madam Chair, Senator um
secretary and.
Ma'am.
Thank, thank you for that. I
appreciate the, um, the clarity,
and it sounds like you as well,
so thank you, Madam Chair.
dinner.
Thank you. Any other questions?
No. What's the wish of the
committee, Senator Pinto.
Motion for a due pass from
Senator Pinto.
Yes, yes.
Motion for a due pass.
Yes.
Thank you. With a second from
Senator Nava.
And if you, yes.
Yes.
the committee substitute if you
could call the roll please,
Senator Brock.
I
Yes.
Senor Nova, yes, Senator Pinto.
And Scott
And Ario Lopez, yes.
And a hickey.
And Lopez.
Yes.
Um, on a vote of 9 to 0, you
have a do you pass
recommendation, Senator. Thank
you, Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
Senator Campos, you want to.
Wrap us up for the evening in
committee.
We saved the best for last.
This will be Senate Bill 61.
Senator Campos place thank you
very much, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. It's great to
go ahead and be here before you
this evening.
Uh, in essence, Senate Bill 61
amends the landscape architects
Act.
I modifying the experience
requirements for landscape,
architect, licensure in New
Mexico.
And in that I have a couple of
experts with me who Madam Chair,
members of the committee, uh, if
you would allow them to make a
brief statement in terms of uh
what this uh Senate Bill 61
would do, and then of course,
would be available for
questions, uh, with us today, we
have Mr. Rob Loftus, who is
chair of the landscape
architecture Board and also
Christina uhreco, who is the New
Mexico Association of Landscape
Architects, uh, who is with the
New Mexico Association.
of landscape architects.
So again, madam, uh madam chair,
members of the committee, if I
can uh further defer to them to
make a brief statement in
regards to the changes that
we're asking for.
Madam chair, Senator, uh, just
one quick correction. Rob Loftus
was not able to attend today. So
I'm here in his stead. My name
is Brian Gerardo. I'm a
landscape architect.
Uh, practicing in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, and I'm also a
member of the Council of
Landscape Architectural
Registration Boards, which is
our national, um,
Thank you again, Senator Campos
for sponsoring this legislation,
um, this bill is really just a
simple cleanup to help align our
act here in New Mexico with
uniform national standards that
have been passed by our national
licensing organization.
Um, it's to make sure that we
have um
Some uniformity between um
additional jurisdictions. There
are several states within our
region that are starting to pass
um
Legislation that aligns with the
same standard. This really helps
to make some parity amongst um
uh with our state and some of
our competitive states around
the, the region. It allows for
ease of uh reciprocity of
licensure cross boundaries or
other jurisdictions, people
coming here that want to
practice and, and most
importantly, I think it, it
allows us for some alternative
paths to licensure for people
who are following different
educational credited landscape
architecture degree pathway.
Which are in in business here in
this profession gives us
additional
Thank you very much. Just, uh,
if I may, Madam Chair, just
again.
Oh
Oh, there it is. Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Kristina Morenko as a
licensed landscape architect in
New Mexico and past president of
the New Mexico Association,
Mexico chapter of the American
Association of Landscape
Architects. I'm supporting this
bill.
To uh align our act with the
uniform standard.
These changes will reduce
barriers to licensure while
keeping standards high in a
state with only one accredited
landscape architecture program,
and that at the master's level
only, this will allow more New
Mexicans to achieve licensure
and secure well-paying jobs that
are critical to many of the
public improvement projects
throughout the state funded by
legislative outlay requests.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, members of the committee
were available for questions.
Thank you, Senator. Is there
anyone in the audience in
support?
Of Senate Bill 61.
Yes, if you'd like to stand and
Make a statement.
There's a microphone there. Good
afternoon, Madam Chair and
committee members. I'm Melissa
Salazar, director of boards and
commissions at regulation and
licensing department. We wish
only to point out that the
operating budget impact
contained an RFIR was not
included in our current
submitted budget.
Therefore, if the bills passed
an authorization or
appropriation will need to be
made to allow boards and
commissions division to carry
out the mandate required by the
bill.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I'm Claudia
Meyerhorn. I'm a licensed
landscape architect, and I'm
also a business owner, um, I
have a practice here in Santa Fe
that, uh, practices landscape
architecture, and I'm also a
former president of the New
Mexico chapter of the American
Society of Landscape Architects.
I'm here on behalf of the board
in support of this bill, we feel
that this bill will help reduce
barriers to entry to the.
profession and like my
colleagues have mentioned here
too that
It will increase the pipeline of
professions, professionals that
will
Will addressed some of the
shortfalls that, uh, we're
experiencing as business owners,
both current and future, and it
will also help help grow the
industry that will meet the
demands of some of the capital
outlay projects that you
support.
So, with that, we thank you for
your consideration of this bill.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
opposition?
See no. Is there anyone on Zoom?
OK.
The attendees.
Um, with that, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Me
I'm sorry
I
There's a motion for do pass
from Senator Silvia Lopez and
who was the second?
Senator Charlie
Second, but we're still in
discussion.
The senator guy goes go before
Senator Black or?
Senator Block first this time
and then Senator Guygo.
OK.
Thank you Madam Chair.
Appreciate that. Uh thank you,
Senator Campos, and um.
People
Uh, real quick here, um, this is
all new to me and it's a pretty
simple bill, but it's it's got
just a couple vagaries that I
just want to answer so I can say
right, I'm good, I can support.
Um, on, on page 2 and section 1
there on line 4.
It has graduated from accredited
program landscape architecture.
How many, how many accredited
programs are there in New
Mexico?
Madam chair, Senator Block,
there is one accredited program
in New Mexico at the University
of New Mexico. Um, it's a map.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair. So UNM is the only one.
New Mexico State.
Be in a land grant school,
agriculture and engineering
doesn't have one.
Madam Chair, Senator Block, that
is correct.
OK, thank you.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair, um.
Then on section 2 line 9.
has graduated from a
non-accredited program of
landscape architecture.
As a minimum of 4 years prior to
experience, so let's just say
they graduated with an
agriculture degree from New
Mexico State.
Fair enough.
Um, and then you're telling me
that they would have to have 4
years working for a landscape
company doing design or hands-on
work to
to be eligible for this license,
Madam Chair, Senator Block, um,
the way the, the, the language
is written, it just is 4 years
of practical experience
acceptable to the board. The
board, um,
would determine through
regulation, um,
And rules what the what the
actual experience required, the
way that Clar model, um, uniform
standards speaks, it does speak
to.
Um, practice within certain
areas of landscape architectural
practice, but it could be
working for, say, a developer or
some other. Perfect, thank you,
sir. Thank you, Madam Chair. I,
I just don't mean to cut you off
what some just quick answers so
we can get out of here. So,
What you just said was if a
particular person, Senator Boone
is working for Acme Landscaping,
um,
With the company, how do you
document that with the company
write a letter saying, Senator
Boone was mowing lawns, put in
astroturf, planted trees, that
would all qualify, can I assume
that?
Um, Madam Chair, Senator Block,
yes, there is a affidavit that
employer would sign saying yes.
Thank you, thank you, sir. Thank
you, Madam Chair. The, the other
one here is um.
On, on line 16, section 3 has
graduated from a program in a
related.
That's a little vague, and I'm
trying to just.
Get an idea of what you mean by
that. Can I assume agriculture,
uh, Madam Chair, sir?
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, yes, I
think similar programs would be
like a bachelor's degree,
perhaps in architecture, uh, UNM
also has a program that's a
bachelor's in environmental
design that's not an accredited
program, but it's a design field
so that would be um
qualified as a um.
You know, a similar adjacent
profession.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair. So why, why don't we just
list out some of the some of the
potential majors to
So people know they understand
what what's what they need to
qualify. Why don't we do that?
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, I
think the intent is to be fairly
broad so that we can allow
people to find different
pathways, as we all know,
there's different education
modes that people are adopting
now, higher ed is not
necessarily or a master's degree
or accredited degree may not be
the only path. That's why New
Mexico already has an experience
only pathway that requires 10
years of experience. This
reduces that to 8.
But, uh, a degree from
university could be substituted
for some of those years of
schooling and the design
professions.
And we're just acknowledging
that we want to give people
credit for any kind of education
they might be getting as long as
they're still supplementing that
with a certain number of years
of education, practical job
training under um under our
profession.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair. So what you're telling me
is you're throwing the net.
You're casting it out wide to
capture as many potential.
Um, options that people might
have chosen in their life to uh
get them licensed with the
appropriate or proper or
required amount of Madam Chair,
yes, Senator, that's, that's
correct. We're trying to um
Provide as many different
pathways as possible, um,
licensure requires not just the
education experience but also
examination. That's standard
across.
All jurisdictions and
consistent, so we're maintaining
a high standard but allowing for
different ways of how you get
there.
Thank you, sir. Thank you Madam
Chair. Lastly, I, I would
assume.
Looking at this and casting this
to a wider, um,
Population
This would be an economic
development.
Bill, uh, would you agree with
that?
Madam Chair, Senator Block, I
would agree with that. That is a
uh a great great way to classify
this.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Uh, I yield.
Thank you, Senator Gallegos.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator.
Uh, Brian and Christina, I just
wanted to ask really quick,
Senator, I, and I've worked
forever on the cooperative
education caps, but I was
wondering, did we not hear this
bill last year? If so,
What happened to that bill?
I'm sure. Uh thank you very
much, Madam Chair and Senator
Gallegos, uh, not this, uh,
specific bill. This one is gonna
go ahead and deal a little bit
differently in terms of the
requirements uh as we continue
to go and work with landscape.
Thank you for that, Madam Chair
and Senator, uh, then my last
question is, and appreciate, uh.
I call it given uh shout out to
my landscaping.
Come after me, so
this thank you.
Uh, but, but no, I did want to
ask Mister Bear and Center, uh,
so if I understand right, uh,
we, we built, uh, Buffalo Wild
Wings in Hobbs and a lot of
their subs were from Texas. This
would bridge that relationship.
From Texas into New Mexico that
they'd be able to come without.
Any kind of issue as far as
landscaping is that recommend
care center.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator Gays,
it would certainly help with the
re reciprocity process. Um,
right now, that, those
relationships exist, but this is
helping to make sure that we're
all on common standards, so.
I think right now there's 7
states that have adopted this
uniform standard. There's about
10 more that are considering it.
We're hopeful that within the
next several years, all the
states will have adopted it so
that it will make a very, very
simple, uh, 1 to 1 cross
borders.
Well, thank you for that, Madam
Chair and Senator and.
Uh, I appreciate that you guys
are from in-state.
I know there's times when we
need to reach out beyond, so I
will you, thank you.
Thank you.
