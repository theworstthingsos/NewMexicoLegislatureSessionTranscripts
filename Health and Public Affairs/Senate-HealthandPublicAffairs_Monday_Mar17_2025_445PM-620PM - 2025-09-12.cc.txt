Um, when we began a committee, I
always ask our committee
secretary to establish a quorum,
if you could please.
Send her a block.
Charlie.
And ours.
And Nova.
Pinto.
got
Senator city of Lopez, yeah,
Senator Dickey,
Senator Lopez.
Here
We have a corn present. So,
thank you.
Uh, we have consent agenda to
begin today.
And a consent agenda, of course,
consent agenda, working with our
Of ranking member, we have 2
measures.
The first one is the committee
substitute for House Bill 618.
Clarify Dear role on agency
projects.
And uh this, of course, that we
have heard.
This measure and the Senate
version.
And
I would like to say, is there
any objection?
If you could call them all just
to.
Verify on that one, please
center block.
Hi
Charlie.
Senator Gallego.
another. Yes.
Pinto.
Andro
Serio Lopez, yes, Senator
Hickey.
Yes. And I Lopez, yes.
So there's a do pass.
By a vote of 9 to 0
on committee substitute for
House Bill 618.
Next on our consent agenda is
House Bill 468.
Retiring of state flags.

And by a vote of 9 to 0.
There is a Du pass
recommendation and the motion
for a due pass was made by the
chair, and a second by Senator
Scott on both of those measures.
Sorry.
So what we can proceed with is,
I know that
Uh, going to some house bills,
uh, may substitute for House
Bill 78 prohibit discrimination
against 340B entities.
Senator Stephanics, um, was
going to present.
Uh, but as we know, there was a,
a death in the family.
So Senator Saviel Lopez is going
to present the bill.
Um, on her behalf as well as
Representative Thompson, they're
on the House floor right now.
So we're trying to help and make
sure we can.
Have a hearing.
So Senator, if you would do the
honors, please.
And again, this is on the
committee substitute for House
Bill 78 prohibit discrimination
against 340B and.
Senator
Thank you, Madam President. I um
am just covering for Senator
Stefaniks. I don't know that
much about this bill, um, but
what I will say that the idea of
this bill is to um
To stretch scarce federal
resources as far as possible in
order to reach more eligible
patients and to provide more
comprehensive services. And with
that, I will introduce my
expert.
Hello, I'm Eva Ramirez Ammerman.
I'm CEO of the Mexico Primary
Care Association.
We have uh 200 clinic sites all
over New Mexico, 80% of them in
the rural areas.
The 340B discount program is
very important to these clinics.
Maintaining our ability to have
contract pharmacies.
It's very important, um,
especially in the rural areas.
I will say that right now, 20
states have passed.
Introduced very similar bills to
this at the thing that is the
same in all those states pretty
much.
Is that it's um for rural areas
especially.
To continue to have access, our
clinics provide comprehensive
primary preventative.
Behavioral health care, medical
care, and dental care.
For the people who need it most,
we operate with the sliding fee
scale based on your ability to
pay.
We accept all people regardless
of their ability to pay.
And we are community-based,
meaning 51% of our boards of
directors must be patients of
the clinic services.
And with that.
And Miss Sammerman, if I could
ask the microphone if you could
just kind of move it towards.
They seen your, there you go,
that way it picks up better.
So,
Thank you, Senator, is at the
end of your
Your presentation? Yes, it is.
OK, thank you. We'll go to the
audience. Is there anyone here
in support?
Uh house Bill 78.
Would you like to come forward?
No? OK.
Is there anyone in opposition
here in the room, the house Bill
78.
none. Is there anyone on Zoom?
We do have one person on Zoom.
And this will be Kyle Picola.
All right, can you hear me?
Yes, we can hear you.
Good evening. My name is Kyle
Paola. I am the director of
state policy for pharmaceutical
research and manufacturers of
America, I am here respectfully
in opposition to House Bill 78,
Pharma agrees that it's
important to ensure the 340B
program truly benefits the
safety net that helps
underserved communities in New
Mexico. The 340B program is a
comprehensive federal program
that is governed exclusively by
federal law, states don't have
the authority to create new
requirements that are not in the
federal.
Statute or that conflict with
federal statute. We agree that
significant reform is needed at
the federal level to
systemically address the
problems that have permitted the
program to stray from its
original intent due to weak
oversight, the program has
expanded in a way that has
allowed covered entities to
divert this money as a result,
the 340B program has grown
dramatically since its
establishment.
There is also significant
concerns with oversight of this
program. New Mexico.
covered entities have only had
18 audits from Hsa, which is the
Federal department that oversees
this program over the last
decade, 14 of the 18 audits came
back with adverse findings.
This means a majority of the
covered entities in New Mexico
have not had a single audit in
the last decade.
The bill the bill's provisions
directly conflict with the
federal 340B program's rules and
enforcement regime and restrict
manufacturers' ability to impose
reasonable guidelines.
In December of 2024, the US
District Court of the Southern
District of West Virginia ruled
in favor of pharma over whether
or not states have domain over a
federal program, the court found
that the prohibition on seeking
claims data in their bill stands
as an obstacle to achieving the
federal objective of preventing
fraud in the 340B program. The
prohibition is very similar to
the provision in Section B3 on
page 2 of House Bill 78. I
appreciate your time and
respectfully ask for your no.
vote on House Bill 78.
Thank you. And there was all,
nobody else? OK.
And with that, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Scott
Thank you, Madam Chair, I
But someone
Madam Chair, Senator, would
someone explain to me, I am
completely unfamiliar.
With 340B drugs.
Somebody explained to me how
that works.
Madam, I'm gonna turn it over to
the to our expert.
chairs, senator Scott, um, the
340B program has been around for
quite some time.
It was created to
staunch, um,
Inflated prices of
pharmaceuticals in 1992, and to
make sure that these
pharmaceuticals were discounted
in a way that provided care for
um underserved populations. So
it's been around for a long
time.
Um
I, uh
So
Bill that
We have before us here is only
for federally qualified health
centers. It does not include
hospitals, so of the 18 audits
that the
Um, person who spoke with.
Um, just now in opposition, I, I
highly doubt that those were
federally qualified health
centers. We are nonprofit.
We have like a 2% operating
margin. We put the money that
Comes from the discounted drugs
right back into the clinics and
serve uninsured folks.
OK.
So that chair.
For some generally in favor.
Of transparency.
So, let's
And work from that direction.
You buy a drug.
Your
Federally approved clinics by a
drug.
Um
manufacturer.
And is that at a any kind of a
discount?
Madam Chair, senator Scott, so
the federal government
determines the price for these
drugs. We don't have any.
Impact on that.
Um, but yes, it is a discounted
rate that that discount we're
allowed to use for uninsured
patients or underinsured
patients, so can leave someone
on Medicare Part B that doesn't
have enough money to get their
pharmaceuticals, they can get it
at a discounted rate if they are
a patient of a federally
qualified health center and look
like. OK.
So manufacturer sells your
clinic.
Drugs at
50, 60, 40% discount?
Do you guys receive those and
then you are in turn.
Supposed to
Ask that
savings
Along to your patients
that my right page here.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, that
is correct.
OK.
Do you do anything else with
those drugs?
Metal chair.
Senator Scott.
Uh, we are allowed to use those
discounted prices for uninsured
and underinsured patients of the
clinic only.
OK.
I guess what I'm trying to get
to here is.
On on section 3 of the bill, it
requires an applicable entity.
to submit any claims,
utilization, purchasing, or
other data.
As a condition for allowing the
acquisition of the 340B drugs.
So that's the manufacturer
asking for data.
With respect to the utilization.
Of the 340B drug.
So why?
Is that
on
Something that we would.
that the manufacturer would be
entitled to note.
Me chair Senator Scott, um, so
we are annually recertified as
covered entities.
And we do have to use those
drugs on a sliding fee scale,
but her son helps
resourceservices Administration
oversees the program and
Um, they are allowed to do any
kind of audits, manufacturers
are also allowed to do audits,
but we do provide reporting
information.
But, madam,
Madam Chair, this.
Actually
In, in plain English.
shall not directly or indirectly
ask for this information and,
and the reason I'm
The reason I'm asking this
Is that I have seen.
The New York Times article that
That references
These 340B.
Clinics.
Reselling these drugs.
Or selling them at full price.
To people with
Insurance
So the, the question becomes
whether all of these
transactions are, in fact, going
to
Low income, underserved, or
whatever, and it looks like.
This would provide the
transparency to know.
Whether or not that was
occurring.
Can you address those.
Madam Chair, Senators kind of
going to try. Uh, first of all,
the New York Times article was
dealing with a hospital-based
system, not a federally
qualified health center, very
different things.
Um
And the, the part that you're
quoting, if I understand you
correctly, you're only quoting
part of it, which is require an
applicable entity to submit any
claims utilization, purchasing,
or other data as a condition for
as a condition.
For allowing the acquisition of
the 340B. So, so it's just
trying to prevent very onerous
burdensome requirements that
each pharmaceutical manufacturer
has started to
Make us do. So some of the
manufacturers are saying you can
only have one contract pharmacy.
Some of them are saying, you
have to go to our portal and if
you have to report all of this
data. Well, if you have 200
pharmaceuticals in a clinic.
Reporting for each of those
different manufacturers is
incredibly burdensome, and we,
we literally don't have the
staff or the capability to
continue to on down this road.
Of this burdensome reporting.
OK.
Madam chair expert, do you?
Do you
Transfer these drugs.
To other entities outside of
your.
Clinics.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, we
have contracted pharmacies who
are bound by contract who we are
responsible for if there's an
audit either by the manufacturer
or health research and services
and
administration. We're
responsible for proving that it
was a patient of our clinic that
got that pharmaceutical at the
contract entity, so in that way,
yes.
OK.
And to all of those contracts
and those drugs out.
At the same price that you buy
them.
340B government program.
So, if they are a patient.
All right, Madam Chair, Senator
Scott.
Um
If they are a 340B patient, you
know, if they are uh
Patient of a betterly qualified
health center.
Then they should get the 340B
drug discount.
But Madam Chair and expert.
That did not answer the
question.
Question is,
To those drugs leave your.
clinical facilities.
At the same price in all
circumstances.
Same price that you
required
Or
In some circumstances.
Are there markups involved.
Which
Then
can form to your bottom line as
Obviously, the difference
between cost of sales and
And
same points.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
there are dispensing fees.
Um, they're moderate dispensing
fees that can't be allowed for
340 be just
discounted drugs.
OK. And Madam Chair and expert,
can you tell me on average what
those percentage markups are.
Madam Chair, uh, senator Scott.
I don't know that I have an
average. I have, um, information
about a couple of clinics who
reported they're dispensing fees
somewhere around $5 for 340B,
um, but I don't have an average
across the state.
OK.
Well
Madam Chair
M
And Senator and expert, I think
I may be working my way toward
the heart of the issue here.
And that
And that you as a 340B clinical
facility would prefer.
The manufacturers not to know
how much of the, how many of
those drugs.
Or
Consumed within your facilities
and how.
Many are going out.
to other facilities that are
not.
340B that
That my
Well, they actually will.
Make a difference.
In the pro profitability of your
facilities and the profitability
of the manufacturers.
I
In, in my own target.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott.
When we were in House Judiciary
Committee.
The pharmaceutical manufacturer
representative said, federally
qualified health centers are not
the problem.
There has been a consistent
effort, um, on their part to
make this bill about getting
information from pharmacies,
that's not what this bill is.
This bill is simply protecting
safety net providers across the
state.
If Arma wants to get that
information, it is possible for
them to get that information,
but that is separate from what
we are trying to do in this
bill.
Oh that senator an expert in
these.
These
3 paragraphs in this
legislation.
Seemed to me.
To inhibit transparency.
As to whose
Fine what at what price?
Whose selling it at what price?
And where
The difference in those numbers.
Preside
And that
That concerns me, that bothers
me.
That we do not have.
Full transparency.
As to who's taking advantage.
Of those 340B.
drug price discounts.
Can, can you understand that
concern and would you attempt to
overcome it.
Perfect.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator Scott.
So we have to do a certain
amount of reporting. Like I
said, FQHC is uniquely are made
to report to the health
resources Services
Administration. Not all covered
entities under the 340B program
have the same reporting
requirements.
Um, so it's not only, you know,
federal law, it's health
resourceservices Administration
specifically for federally
qualified health centers.
Cannot speak to what happens
with other provider groups.
OK.
Well, with a, with a
computerized acquisition and
dispensing system.
The
The
Against the
The problem
Being able to report this data.
should be trivial.
You've got a spreadsheet.
Within your organization that's
kept
Minute by minute would be.
My suspicion, so
You know, why are we in this
legislation.
Trying to inhibit.
That transparency back to the
manufacturer.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott.
We are trying to prohibit.
Um
Many pharmaceutical
manufacturers that we deal with.
From limiting contract
pharmacies. Some of them say
only one.
And from putting onerous
burdensome requirements on us
for reporting.
May I, uh, may I also add that
we had a presentation about this
in um legislative Health and
Human Services Committee and
what was
What these PBMs were interfering
in a way that affected clinics.
That's why this bill only
applies to clinics and not the
private equity hospitals.
And so their activities such as
putting onerous requirements,
having portals, and there was
really burdensome on the
clinics, and so this is really
about protecting the federally
qualified.
What is the acronym is
Healthcare clinics in New
Mexico.
But there is, they do in clinics
have to make reports.
It may not have full and
complete transparency, uh, but
it, these reports are available
and, and can be read and, and
that's what I think is important
about this bill.
No
Madam Chair, Senator.
quadro if the reports are
readily available.
Why are we prohibiting
These folks asking for the
information.
Because they can get it from the
report.
OK.
Madam Chair, Senator, I'm going
to let somebody else ask a few
questions, but
Uh,
I still have concerns here.
That what this may be about is
protecting.
Ay.
That allows some of these
clinics.
To buy drugs.
Yeah, very high discounted
rates.
Sell them at
Something like retail.
To other entities.
And guards there profits as a
consequence of that activity.
From prying eyes.
And if that's the case,
I would not be able to support
this.
Uh, thank you. I'm sure that's
all for you.
Thank you, Senator, Senator
Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I, I
don't have any questions per se,
but I just wanted to share with
the um the committee in
particular that this is
important for tribes who have
undergone the 638 process to
divest from IHS, um, and have
established their own health
corporations. Um, it also helps
VA hospitals, right? Like this
is so important, this program
to, to VA hospitals.
Um, and regarding the type of
regulations, Senator, um,
But
is bringing up, which I actually
do support um.
I think that that has happened
at the federal level, though,
because this is a federal
program. So all of that
transparency, um, that we want
and need cause they actually, I,
I agree with you. I think um
there is
Robust opportunity, um, for a
federal 340B entity to contract
out their access and do exactly
what you are saying.
Um, but that, that has to happen
at the federal level, not here.
And what I understand this bill
to be doing is to
Again, protect, um, local clinic
access, yeah, um.
So, uh, just, just in general,
I, I do support this. It, it's
important for us to have access
to these drugs at a lower cost
um for hospitals that are
operating in negative margins,
quite frankly. Um, thank you,
madam chair.
Thank you.
Any other questions, Senator
Black?
Thank you Madam Chair. Um,
I'm sorry, what was your name?
E
That
You know. Are you a doctor?
I'm not. I am CEO of the New
Mexico Primary Care Association.
Got you.
OK. Thank you, ma'am. Um,
Yvette, the health resources and
services administration, they
They provide um oversight, is
that correct with audits?
Madam Chair, representative
block, that is correct. Um, the
audits can be
Provided either by persona.
Or by the manufacturers
themselves, the ones that are
provided by Hsa are available
publicly on the website, the
findings.
So, Madam Sherry, that there
have been um
And I can go over some of the
notes I have in the
In the research, but there have
been some major issues with
audits at the state level.
In fact, here in New Mexico,
The uh health resources and
Services Administration.
Over the last decade, they've
only audited it in New Mexico,
covered entities.
18 times over the last decade.
And of those 18 audits, 14 came
back with adverse findings,
including illegal distribution.
Of the 340B uh purchase drugs.
That, that doesn't sound like a
great track record, 14 out of
18.
Um, for those audits right
there. I is that, is that the
normal, um,
Is that normal or is that just
those are bad audits.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, I
would submit that probably of
those 18 audits.
Maybe none.
We're done with federally
qualified health centers.
It, it would, I clarification is
needed on that. We are
Much more regulated than any of
the other entities that are
covered entities under the 340B
program. We are not the problem.
Uh, Madam Cherryvette.
Well, when you get 14 out of 18
audits that find serious issues
that, that is a problem and
And is it true?
Um, a drug manufacturer.
Can request
Um, at the expense of that
manufacturer, um, for knotted.
Is that true?
Um, Madam Chair, Senator Block,
that, that is correct. Um, they
definitely need to um
show cause in order to
Begin an audit, so they have to
show that there's something.
Going on before they start the
audit.
Right, that exactly, madam
chair, because that audit
request can be denied by the
HRSA, can I not?
Madam Chair.
Senator Block, I don't know the
answer to that.
We can go look at it together
after the hearing. I'd be more
than happy to do that to you,
but it is true, they're the ones
that can say to the
manufacturer, we're gonna deny
the audience.
Mm
This, that's, that's not
transparency at all.
That's, that's a problem.
The, uh, Madam Chair Yvette the
Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, are
you familiar with that
organization?
Madam Chair, Senator Black, I
am, and they oppose this bill,
correct?
Madam Chair, Senator Block, I
believe that are all of the
pharmaceutical companies are
opposing these types of bills in
20 different states, right,
exactly, because Madam Chair
Yvette, there's ongoing
litigation across the country
about HRSA's 3 340B contract
pharmacy policy.
Uh, and I believe that New
Mexico should allow the federal
courts to run its course.
To address and resolve those
issues before considering any
legislative action.
Um, it's probably the prudent
way to go.
One of the things uh that we've
had here in New Mexico. Are you
familiar with, uh, Madam Chair,
a lady named Virginia King.
Madam Chair, Senator Blo, I am
not. OK.
Uh, Virginia King is in this
article and I can give that to
you if you want. I think maybe,
maybe now you might be aware of
it. She was a patient, a cancer
patient here in Santa Fe, by the
way.
She was billed $22,700.
For
Thank you.
For a drug with the list price
of $2700.
I mean, just, just wrong, uh,
that led to about a $2500 out of
pocket expense, which was more
than half her monthly salary.
And
If you look at this program,
there's been a lot of Virginia
Kings around the country.
North Carolina.
For instance,
From the North Carolina state
treasurer.
Uh, North Carolina hospitals use
federal 340B program to profit
at the expense of patients,
teachers, and state employees.
So this is one of the reasons
why there's a lot of stuff going
on around the country with
these, with the litigation. In
fact, North Carolina, um,
They charge their own state
employees on average in price
mark of 5.4 times the hospital's
discounted 340B acquisition
costs.
Outpatient infused cancer
medicines.
So, I guess, you know, when it
comes to transparency because we
do all believe in transparency.
Absolutely. I appreciate and I
know what you do as well.
Uh, Madam Char and um Yvette,
why would a manufacturer
As for claims data and why would
it be important to them and
providing that 340B pricing to a
covered entity.
I would think that it would be
so that they don't, uh, so it's
not misused like it was in this
article in The New York Times,
but I want to say the reason
that I think this bill is so
important is it doesn't, it
doesn't cover hospitals,
equity-owned hospitals like the
problems in the New York Times.
This bill is just about
federally qualified clinics in
our state. Those are the
nonprofits that are serving our
most vulnerable populations.
But thank you, Senator, uh,
Madam Chair, what the problem is
the feds have
They really have a lack of
oversight.
There's so many issues with this
program at the federal level,
they have a complete lack of
oversight in the states are not
liking it because the states are
Like
Uh, over a dozen states are in
litigation about this because of
the price gouging for for um for
people.
So, you know, we, we talked
about controlling the, the
growth of
Healthcare and pharmacy costs,
but yet this program, I'm not
blaming you by the way. You're,
you're trying to do the right
thing. Um, but Madam Chair, this
and that, this program.
It's overcharging people
massively across the country.
Why wouldn't we as New Mexicans
want to just kind of sit back
and wait until
The, the, um,
The lawsuit process
Kind of figures it out because I
don't think we need any more
Virginia Kings in New Mexico.
Madam Chair, Senator Block.
The reason we're bringing this
legislation forward is because
we can't wait.
We are very
Um,
We operate at the very low
margin.
We have um a lot of Medicaid, a
lot of uninsured, a lot of
underinsured. We serve 3 330,000
New Mexicans.
One of the lawsuits was against
Hersa.
Because Hesa pushed back when
Johnson and Johnson wanted to
create a rebate program. So
right now we get the discounts
on the front end, Johnson and
Johnson, and now
Bristol Squid and another
manufacturer want to create a
rebate program so that we'd have
to pay that money upfront in
order to get the pharmaceuticals
and then on the back end, they
pay us back.
We can't front that kind of
money. This will gut the program
and maybe get the clinics with
it, if that rebate program
actually goes into action. We
can't wait.
So, Madam Chair Yvette.
You said that this program
serves 330, roughly 330,000
people in New Mexico.
It, it's where, where's, but
there's zero transparency on
that.
We don't, we don't see that.
That's, that's the issue from
the federal level, is there's
zero transparency in the states
are are are litigating back, are
they not?
Because there's nothing that
requires hospitals to provide
this data to prove the program's
intent is being met.
There's nothing there, and they
don't have to do it.
That's, that's the transparency
problem with this bill.
And I think
I think it would be best for the
state of New Mexico.
They let the lawsuits run their
course before we can act because
We're gonna have a lot more
Virginia Kings in the state of
New Mexico that are getting
price gouged.
Because of the lack of
oversight.
And the lack of transparency
with the bill, just, just my
opinion.
But um, I, I
greatly appreciate the debate
and, and we'll look together
after this on um.
For the HRSA, absolutely. And uh
I, I can't support the bill, but
thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you. Any other questions?
none will move a do pass.
With the 2nd presenter Sid
Lopez. If you could call the
roll, please.
And our block. No.
And Senator Charlie.
And everybody else.
And I know
Yes, and I pinto.
S
Center Cio Lopez, yes, hicky.
And her love is.
Yes, and to explain your vote,
Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
For, for all the reasons that I
said before, I support, support
the bill, but also, um,
I can clearly understand why Big
Pharma would oppose a bill like
this.
Um
And so it is not lost on me that
this is about profit.
Thank you, Ma.
Thank you. Good bye, by a vote
of 5 to 3, you have a due pass
recommendation.
Thank you.
Representative Martinez.
Hello.
Please join us up front to
present House Bill 336.
Certain retirees returning to
work.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, I bring you
House Bill 336.
Um, last year we passed the
return to work bill for law
enforcement.
Um, and we fail to include
Uh, the law enforcement agents
that work for the Livestock
Board.
And this is a fix to that bill.
Uh, and with that, um,
of an expert. Oh.
Mr. Sean Davis.
Uh, I brought him so he could
answer any hard questions that
you might have.
Uh, good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Sean
Davis, New Mexico Labs.org.
Thank you very much. Was that?
The end of your presentation,
representative.
That's it, nice and simple. Sir,
OK. Thank you. Is there anyone
in the audience who is in
support of House Bill 336.
Anyone in opposition?
See none. Is there anyone on
Zoom?
House Bill 336.
OK.
Are there any questions from
committee members on House Bill
336.
Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Martinez,
welcome.
So
Uh, so I, I didn't have a chance
to like get in depth on the bill
here I talked to you before, but
why, why are you bringing this
sport? Is there a workforce
shortage at the state that we
want to bring forward or what,
what's the issue?
Uh
I think Madam Chair, Senator B
block, when it comes to law
enforcement, yes, there is.
Um, and especially with
specialized agencies like the
Livestock Board.
And I'm gonna have uh Mr. Davis
comment on on what's happening
with his agency.
Uh, but that's why we passed
that bill last year.
Making it a little bit easier to
hire these.
Retired law enforcement officers
who can come back and serve as
mentors.
some of the younger officers.
It was
Metal chairs, Senator Block, uh,
we, we really looked forward to
the enactment of this bill last
year in order to to allow us to
hire some retired veteran
officers, maybe for even some
supervisory positions, uh, to,
to help guide and lead some of
our younger officers at the New
Mexico Livestock Board, we have
33 law enforcement officers at
the New Mexico Livestock Board.
We don't have a lot of
vacancies, but where we do lack
is, is those veteran.
officers coming back that this
bill would allow them to come
back and, and fill those roles,
and we had two very good
candidates last summer for two
supervisory positions that uh
once we dug down into this uh
with PERA we were told that we
didn't fit the limited
description in the, in the law
that was passed last year. And
so this is just an expansion of
that limited, limited uh
definition.
think about him chair. uh, sir,
you mentioned
Uh, you have
is 33 the uh the required
manpower or do you, do you have
uh openings?
Madam Chair, Senator Block, we
have a total of 50 inspectors
statewide with 60 part-time
inspectors. 33 is the number of
uh investigators and law
enforcement officers we have at
the New Mexico Livestock Board.
We only have 3 vacancies within
that parameter of law
enforcement officers. This would
allow us to feel two of those uh
vacancies, um, and those guys
are still on hold kind of
waiting to see if we're gonna
get this passed so they can come
to work.
For
OK, so, um, Madam Chair and uh
Representative Martinez, uh,
this, this pool could be for
state police, county deputies,
and municipality law
enforcement, is that correct?
Um
Madam Chair, Senator blocked for
any certified law enforcement.
OK, um,
I just want to understand how
this works here real quick. So
Madam Chair and Representative
Martinez.
Is it, is it based on vacancies
at the various departments at
various levels that, and they
will, they will decide if these
guys are, are these men and
women are qualified to come back
to fill those spots.
Madame Chairen block, yes, uh,
they wouldn't.
Create new positions. These
would be for actual uh
Budge and bacon vacant
positions.
And uh lastly, um, Madam Chair
and Representative Martinez.
If, if they've been retired for
like
10 years or something like that.
Is there a cutoff where they
have to go back to some sort of
Refresher academy training
before they can be certified
once again to go uh do law
enforcement activities.
Madam Chair, Senator Block as
long as they maintain that
certification, they can be
higher at any time.
Um
They do need to be retired for
12 months.
Before they can come back, but
as long as they maintain their
their law enforcement
certification, uh, they can come
back.
I'm sure that each agency will
have a small
Oh
Training session for them to
familiarize them with, with
internal.
policies.
OK, um, and, and last one I
promised, Madam Shaing
Representative Martinez. So it
also applies to our tribes and
pueblos.
Law enforcement agencies as
well, correct? if they so choose
to hire them.
Madam Chair Representative, were
you talking search my tribal
officers coming to
Uh, an agency. No, sir, um,
Madam Chair, uh, Representative
Martinez, I'm talking about if,
if these folks are on Para.
In their openings, like at Santa
Ana, um, or, or Santo Domingo,
they would be eligible if they
meet the requirements of those
tribal um law enforcement
agencies, is that fair to say,
Madam Chair, Senator, I believe
that the tribal officers have a
different
Um
Retirement, I'm, I'm not, I
don't think they're part of
PERA.
OK
OK. Thank you, sir. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. Any other
questions?
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Charlie with the
2nd from Senator Nava.
If you could call the wrong
place.
And a block.

Thank you.
expenditure had on me.
Where are you?
And the representative, I'll
bring you up um after Senator
Jara meal.
had a meal sent a bill 498.
writer as official state
vehicle.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, thank you so much for
having me here today. This bill
comes forward by a request from
a city councilor in Albuquerque,
Clarissa Penny. Now, as you
know, the writers are a work of
art, expressions of faith and
culture and cornerstones of
families not only in the
Espanilla Valley but across our
great state.
Low end cultures alive and well
in New Mexico, Madam Chair, and
it's one that I'm so proud of.
There's an energy, enthusiasm,
and beauty surrounding the
riders.
That this bill aims to celebrate
across New Mexico and
communities embracing low
riderculture.
60 Minutes has done a whole
episode on low riding and
Espanola.
But it's not just in the valley,
it's across New Mexico. And so
my expert witness stepped out. I
wanted him to say a few words,
but with that, I can entertain
any questions.
Thank you, Senator.
Um, I know that a gentleman that
we call house.
was here earlier, but I think he
had to leave.
Um, but anyway,
We'll go to the audiences or
anyone here in support of Senate
Bill 498.
Anyone in opposition?
Is there anyone online?
Senate Bill 498? No? OK.
So with that, we'll go to any
questions or comments from
committee members and senators
thought.
Adam's chair, senator.
Very obvious question.
One of.
amount of chairs the center,
you're gonna like this northern
New Mexico College is going to
try to start a program on
getting electric vehicles to
become low riders. And so it'd
be the first of its kind where
we would train mechanics and es
and electric vehicles to become
low riders.
the Tesla would fit in that
category.
Madam Chair and Senator of.
to submit that the first time
you try to make one of those
mounts.
You're gonna end up with a
roadway full of batteries.
That's all I have. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Scott. That,
that's, yeah, that's a good
visual.
Anyway, other questions,
Senator, uh, Madam Chair, not a
question, but to respond to
Senator Block, which I know
we're not supposed to do. I will
just say Tesla has a feature
right now that allows the car to
bounce.
It's already got low rider
capabilities, Madam Chair, I
yelled.
Thank you. Any other questions,
Senator Pinto, uh, Madam Chair
and.
Is uh lower low rider defined in
your bill.
Madam Chair, Senator, I don't
believe it is, and I don't think
it would need a definition, but
if I need to put one in, I
definitely would.
And Madam Chair and Senator I
cashing.
is in fashion.
Lorider has a whole different
another meaning.
Great point.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator.
Um,
Senator Gallegos
Senator, I'm just wondering, is
your expert witness second as a
bodyguard.
Madam Chair, Senator, he does.
And turn center, I'll start
being nicer to you.
my actual question for you,
Mister Madam Chair and Senator,
uh, my brother's got all kinds
of old marks, he's gotten over
the ground, uh, they've got
lifts in them, uh, you know, for
their drives and stuff. Are
these required or is it have to
be
Did you get an old car that's
standard high.
that show because they're old.
He considered lowrider or do
they need to be, what you say
brown and close to the ground?
Madam chair, Senator, the one
thing I have been told by the
lowrider community throughout
New Mexico. They need to have
Das in order to be considered a
low rider.
and Jansen, can you say that one
more time?
They need to have Jas, Madam
Chairwoman, in order to be
considered an official lowrider.
and turns, then I, what is that?
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, so Dayton's are,
it's, it's a wire wheel.
Uh, 13 7s.
And the whole with the low
riding.
Yeah, it's a beautiful thing.
It's part of it. You can
actually run um
You can actually run regular
stocks, the old, the old stock
rooms, you remember how they
are, and you can lower the car
and so the whole entire body
will sayuelo.
And what sweatro means is on the
floor.
And so, uh, the low with the low
riding community with the
Daytons, with the regular, it's
just a, a New Mexico way of
life. It's part of our culture.
It's as much as our culture is
red and green cheery.
And uh you know,
Lowri started here in New Mexico
even though others have tried to
claim it.
But we're here espanola Valley,
you know, we, uh.
We are, are the home of the
lowrider. It's, you'll find a
low rider in from the biggest of
cities to the smallest of towns.
And you see them all over. We
have low riders in airports. We
have
Law enforcement
With um
We, we have couples.
That are fully custom can be
painted.
Uh, have switches, which is
hydraulics.
And uh it's good to be the
community.
It's good to bring each other
together, uh, this culture is
deeply enriched.
here in New Mexico, it's, it's
part of our makeup.
Thanks to them and chair and
center and expert with us on, on
my brother later day and make
him understand I'm smart, or the
chair and center, uh, on those
Daytons. Do you do white waltz
or is it just standard black?
Madam Chair, uh, senators, um,
so you can have any there's,
there's 3 different kinds, so
you can run a half inch.
A full inch or you can run a
5-inch custom white wall.
So you remember in the 50s, the
50s had the big, the big white
wall, it's a beautiful thing you
see him out there all the time,
so.
You can put any kind of uh, you
can put any kind of tire on the
Dayton.
Uh, me, myself, I, I actually
have a, a roadster, so the, the
rosters, I have a
I have a big oy truck.
And it's because I wasn't small
enough to fit in a regular car.
So I built the Dooley and we put
hydraulics, and we chromed out
and go to the whole entire
undercarriage and we've been
able to show.
Our cars and our trucks here in
New Mexico, we have world
champions that are from here.
We have people that have been
born and raised from different
parts of our cities, from our
culture, from everything and
have gone out and competed
against the best and have won.
So to answer your question,
Senator.
Yes, sir, we can do any kind of
tire you want, let me know and
I'll make it happen. Thank you
for that, Madam Chair and
Senator experts with us. I have
one last question.
Um, the costly low riders, a
youngest my youngest brother,
uh, just bought a 39 me
yesterday, 0 39. It's all
original.
It's not been painted chopped or
anything.
Uh, what, what does tip the
lowrider cause
during the next turn.
And
Madam Senator, um, it could cost
as much or as little as you
want. That's the beautiful thing
about low riding.
Uh, the, the originality of the
39 merch that all that chrome
that's coming through, it's
beautiful, right?
The different things and that's
the thing about the lowrider.
Is that it's not a specific kind
of car.
We can have, you can have
anything from an impeller to
afford our duty, you can have a
Merck, you can have a Chevy, you
can have a Ford.
You can have any kind of cars
you want. It's your expression.
And as you know, as a New
Mexicans is our, is our gente
and is our culture.
We're very expressive.
We'd like to show our culture.
A manera apologized, said that
was my last question. Actually I
haven't fun with this right down
notes and chair and center for
witness. So, um, my brother has
an El Camino.
That's a full or it's a
Uh, it doesn't separate the
the bed. It's a full body.
So,
but I was trying to understand
cause he lives in Denver and I
thought there's uh
Laws
Uh, on, on what you could have,
because I, I know that they've
checked in for, and I don't know
if it's a height requirement
while you're traveling or if
it's, I know when he's at a
show, he drops it down very to
the bottom.
But are there issues with speed
bumps, um,
Oh, it is
Does any of that cause you
citations?
As you're traveling, this term.
Jason
Senator.
You, uh, that's the whole point
of you can have an air ride
system or hydraulics point is,
is when you're coming up.
You see that speed bump?
You can come up
Lift it up
I go over it and as soon as you
go down, you will drop to back,
drop the front.
Just keep on going, but we've
never had.
Citations you've never really
had any issues like that.
A man churns senator and
gentlemen, I'm gonna call my
little brother after we get off
Florida tonight at 10. I don't
even change my oil, so I've
learned a lot, so thank you now.
Thank you, Senator Nova.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator, for bringing the
bill forward. Two serious
questions, um, are there
factions of lowrider clubs in
accordance to our districts.
Madam Chair senators, so there
are lowrider clubs in every
district throughout New Mexico
if that's what you're asking. If
you're going to ask me the names
of them, I wouldn't be able to
name them. You'd be amazed how
many lowrider clubs from
throughout the state of New
Mexico have called in support of
this bill and the license plate
bill.
Thank you, madam, sure. Thank
you, Senator. Uh, I think it
would be extremely um
I think it would be an enormous
incentive for us to be educated
on our pertinent clubs to ensure
in case that they're recruiting
and we may have some members
here who may be interested in
joining the club just to make
sure that would be a recruitment
efforts are on point, um, and
then Madam, uh, chair and
senator, if your bill is passed,
will there be um a course that
will be taught by yourself or
your expert witness on the
history of lowriders and will
there be any engagement or
A tour of these low riders, the
lowrider cars. Madam Chair
Senator, we're working on the
low rider capital of the world,
museum and Espanilla. So when
those doors open, I'd invite
everyone from both chambers to
come and visit where you'll get
a history of low riders. You'll
also get to partake in some
hands-on activities, so
definitely, um, and I'll invite
you to come and do a a cruise of
the lowrider capital of the
world when you're ready. I have
promised all of the freshmen
legislators that they can come
with me where we'll have a
police es.
of tour, which is one that
Senator Pinto partaked in in um.
In the summer she was in a low
rider and cruised along with 17
other House and Senate members.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you. uh, thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator.
Good Afternoon.
Um, so, what was your name?
Senator Black, my name is
Lorenzo Otero. Lorenzo Otero,
yes sir, but everybody calls me
house.
I can see that.
Because you're big, because I
ate it.
Right, you ate one. What?
So the way I got my nickname
was, uh, I played high school
and college football, and I had
switched over. I went from
Albuquerque High to Rio Grande.
Um, I had lost my mom.
And so I went to Roland High
School.
Well, when I walked in,
the, uh, the football coach.
Uh, who was, who was out and uh
Sanchez and the uh the principal
looked at me and said, oh my
God, he's as big as a house.
From that point on it just suck.
So that's how I got my nickname.
Madam Chair, Mr. Rodeo that
makes a lot of sense.
Where'd you play college ball?
Texas Tech.
Boucher.
Suck.
Uh, Madam Chair, Mr. uh Raiders,
correct?
Cowboys
Is it, is it Cowboys? Oh yeah,
Red Raiders, yeah, Red Raiders,
jeez, OK. All right. So, um,
Mr. Ta, let me just ask you a
couple of questions, uh, Madam
Chair, Mr. Tara, I kind of
understand your background as an
expert, Senator Har.
Why, why are you an expert on
this?
Mer said Blanc.
I've been bull riding since
birth, uh, and growing up, I
grew up in a neighborhood in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, uh, in
Balas right next to the zoo.
From the time I was a kid.
Growing up in the neighborhood
that I did.
There was no riders everywhere.
I remember being a kid and my
next door neighbor.
He had, um, it was a, a 1966
Impela.
One of my, I matter of fact, I
own it now.
Um
I remember being a kid.
and the
we went cruising, we have a, a,
a place in, in Albuquerque
called San Gabriel.
And so we would go into San
Gabriel, and that was just as a
kid, so as I, as I grew up and I
got older, I started building
them, so I started building a
low rider bike, first of all.
And then went from the low rider
bikes. I got my first car, which
was a '64 Impala.
And being able to take this car
apart.
And see what I can do.
And having the community around
us because it's a community
thing, it's a family thing.
They came together and they
helped me, and I remember being
a kid and putting these things
back together.
And then as we got older, we
started, we would cruise, we
would go to functions, we'd go
to birthday parties. If there
was something going on, if we
had to, we
We've been able to raise money
for families who um
Who needed
To have the funeral
Uh, the funeral arrangements
taken care of. We've been able
to help kids.
Get medicine that they needed.
So as a low riding community,
we've been able this whole
entire time to be able to help
each other. So what makes me an
expert
I would say is the passion and
the love that I have for the low
rider, the passion and love that
I have for the community and the
passion I love and the love that
I have for my state.
That's a great answer. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr.
Otero.
I assume when um
You and your friends are, are
repairing them or have some type
of uh mechanical issues to
repair. I, I assume you're the
guy lifting the car and then
they just do the work.
But Senator Block, yes, sir. OK.
Um, Madam Chair, Mr. Otero.
Did you know, you probably did,
and I know New Mexico.
Love it, loves to take credit
for this, especially
The great senator from uh the
Espanola area.
But low riders were actually
started by returning World War
II.
Mexican American veterans, did
you know that in Southern
California?
Madam Chair, Senator, we did.
They stole it from Espanola, OK,
um, I thought that was pretty
interesting actually.
Uh, Madam Chair and Mr. Otero.
What is
The most popular lowrider
vehicle.
Madam Cha, Senator Black.
The most
I, I would have to say.
Well
There there's a matter of
opinion, so in Palace is is
probably the most traditional.
What year? So I, I would have
that once again, so you have the
58 was the first year that
Impala was ever made.
So 58 is kind of like the king,
the 59 is the queen, you know,
the 60s, the bishop, so we start
playing chess, but uh.
As you go along the most, I
would say.
The most sought after is
probably.
64 in power, so with 64, but the
one that everybody wants is the
58. Mr. Otero or Madam Chair,
Mr. Otero, you're exactly right.
It's the 64 Impala is the most
popular lowrider vehicle
and um lastly, just to test your
expert.
Credentials.
Um
How many headlights are on the
front.
Of the 64 Impala.
Madam Senator Buck.
How many lights are on a 64
Impala headlights.
On the, on the headlights, sir?
Yeah.
So you have 4 total.
Perfect. Thank you.
And uh lastly, Madam Chair and
Mr. Teo, how many um are on the
tail lights.
Madam chair Senator Block on the
64 Impala.
6, exactly.
That's awesome, Madam Chair, I
will support the bill.
All right.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
There's one ahead of you,
Senator.
said locos and then we'll come
back to you.
I think this
Why it's, I think this may be
along the lines of a
qualification. Mr. Otero, are
you related to Damasio Otero who
is uh one of the sergeant at
arms.
Here in the capital.
Senator Lopez, no man, but I'm
sure he's just as good looking
as me,
my mother's last name is Otero
and Tomaso and my mother are
first cousins.
So when I saw the last name
Otero, it's not the most common
last name in New Mexico, and I
offered, so do you know if one
of your ancestors is Cayetano
Otero.
Um
Ma
Um
That
Senator Lopez.
Um, I'm not too sure. So my
family, I know when my family
settled, we settled in Manzano,
so my family were Manzanerros,
so we're from Manzano and Junto
Diabo.
And then my family, so when my
grandparents.
My grandfather served in World
War II. They sold some of the
land in Manzano.
And settled in butter.
So we, I know we have family all
over New Mexico. But that is
definitely something I, I would
love to look into.
Thank you. The only reason, and
I don't see your whole face, but
your eyes look a little bit like
my cousin's eyes, so I was like,
oh my God, um, so again, just,
just
Seeing about the qualifications
here. Thank you, thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Gallegos for
a 2nd time.
And sure, thank you. I'm gonna
still call your house. I really
don't care about your last day.
You're a big boy. I want to be
friends. Uh, I did have a
question what you're talking
about, um, the South Valley. Uh,
I had a cousin, well, I still
have a cousin, a lot older now,
but uh back in the day, he had
lived on a Riverside Drive.
There was a Louis Lebo.
That had impella. Do you
remember that or do you have any
reference to?
So, um, Madam Chair, Senator A
was.
Um, I remember a Louis that
lived on Riverside Road.
I don't remember if that was his
last name, but he had it, I
believe it's a '69, am I
correct?
I'm, I'm thinking that's right.
He used to have dump trucks, but
uh I just remember seeing he
would get that out whenever we
had family out in there, but um
I just wondered because that's
area of the state or that at
that area of the community
always does a lot of things
together, so I'll yield with
that, uh, very, very.
Impressed with your expertise
and your knowledge and
If he fires you as a bodyguard,
please call me.
Thank you Madam chair.
Thank you.
I see no other.
Questions or comments?
And a do pass motion from
Senator Savio Lopez with the 2nd
from Senator Pinto.
And if you could call the role,
please.
center of block.
Yes, to the house.
In our
Senator attorney.
And
Then Nova.
See.
Pinto.
Senator Scott.
Lopez.
Yes, and a hickey.
And I love it.
Yes.
And before I announced the vote,
um, this is New Mexico, so
actually house, but.
Um, we're related.
We're all from Monzano, New
Mexico, where my father was from
too.
And my son, Lorenzo loves to
drive a ride in your truck,
Lorenzo, Lorenzo.
In a Spanish we call it Tocayo.
Oh, it's just uh.
And and what
We see in our community, and I,
it's the same community that um
Mr. Otero and I live in, it's,
it's beautiful.
It's wonderful.
Um, we see our young people
getting engaged and involved.
And I've learned a few things,
um, as I talked to some of our
young people over time. It,
it's, uh, as everybody who's
talked here, a few of you who've
talked about cars.
It's um
It's a way to learn and a way to
communicate, and a way to build
family.
So, I appreciate both of you
being here.
I look forward to the discussion
on the floor, which I think is
going to be really fun.
So by a vote of 8 to 0, you have
a Du pass recommendation center.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, senator. Thank you. Keep it
low and slow.
Mass thank you. God bless each
and every one of you. I
appreciate you.
Thank you. Good to see you.
And next, I think representative
um
And Representative Dao and
Romero, if both of you would
like to come forward.
We have um housevi 554.
And as residential home building
authorization.
After this bill we'll do Senate
Bill 512 and that will be the
end of our agenda for today.
And police representatives.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members,
um, House Bill 554 um is an
effort that came out of a weekly
uh housing, uh, form that we
started the beginning of this
year, um, looking at housing in
New Mexico and how it was that
we could improve the opportunity
here. The bill before you came
out of the knowledge base from
Pew Research that was presented
about rezoning essentially for
the opportunity.
to build housing across the
state.
The bill does two things. It
essentially allows in every
commercial district, the ability
to build residential housing.
And the second part of this is
helping us build um
Accessory dwelling units across
the state as well. So it allows
for that build as well for
private owners of their lands to
make those decisions. Um, this
creates that statewide element
that makes it easier for folks
to make those decisions, um, to,
to empower them to build that
housing with me is
Representative Dao, who
co-chaired um
Our housing forum. I probably
spam you all 100 times, so I
appreciate you taking the email,
but really it was an effort to
to learn a lot about housing and
this was the preeminent way in
which we could um look at how to
build housing in our state and
solve this housing crisis.
Bye.
Thank you, um, Madam Chair and
thank you, Representatives. I
originally did not sign on to
this bill. Um, I was concerned
about the local control, uh, for
zoning, but also very aware of
private property rights. And so,
the three amendments, uh, the 2
amendments that were made, uh,
I, I do think there's a lot of
bipartisan support to take
vacant commercial properties and
revitalize them as residential,
originally the bill had the word
that you could build
multi-family housing at a bus
stop.
at a transit stop. That was
amended to say at a um
rail frail stuff, rail stop. So
it's a passenger rail stop.
And that is about also helping
people travel and in
multi-family housing. The other
thing was the additional
dwelling unit, and there are
some folks who don't want
additional dwelling units, and
there's some folks who do. So if
it's your private property as
conservatives who believe in
private property rights, we want
you to be able to build an
additional dwelling unit if you
want to, if it meets the
requirements. So, we did make an
amendment that says uh that
excludes the requirements.
Of a private property owner
being able to add additional
dwelling unit in an existing uh
housing, if there's a HCO or or
the housing, yeah, HOA or um
covenants.
And with us, uh, Madam Chair is
Danny Warpath with the Office of
Housing, the Governor, um, who
is at all of our uh forum
hearings and obviously expert on
housing and residents, so with
that we'll stand for questions.
Thank you very much. With that,
lets go, is there anyone in the
audience in support of House
Bill 554.
Anyone in opposition.
We go to Zoom. Is there any?
OK, there's no one on Zoom.
And with that we'll go to
questions from committee
members.
Senatorerolocas.
Um
I know that Albuquerque recently
did this.
Um, and I, I think that that's
fine that Albuquerque did this.
I'm concerned because in I guess
in the 90s, we passed a bill
prohibiting all cities from
enacting rent control, and we
took that decision out of the
local government's hands, and
I think it's a good idea for
this kind of thing to be in the
local communities instead of
having the state.
Dictate.
What's happening in the local
communities, um,
Could you explain to me why you
think this is a state matter.
The zoning is traditionally been
a local thing, you know, Landy's
planning has been a local thing
for obvious reasons, the people
who live there should be
deciding their own fate.
Uh, if I can with our.
Madam Chair, Senator, um,
So I would start with the
construct of our state law,
which is zoning authorities
actually delegated by the state.
It's not something that's
inherent to local governments,
and it's up to local governments
to make the choice about what is
and isn't delegated.
I think the challenge that we
see is that many local
communities have inconsistent
policies. They have outdated
policies.
The fact remains that we're one
of 5 states with less building
permits this year than last
year, and we have 40,000 units
that are needed. So that
indicates that there's some
problem at the local level where
these permits are being
approved. Um, and so this is an
attempt to address it in a way
that many other states have
done, um, we're actually one of
the only states.
In our region that haven't
tackled some of these state
level issues and generally what
they do is create consistency.
So all three of our major urban
areas have guesthouse rules,
right? But they're very
different and that makes it hard
to apply, and it makes it hard
for the market to operate in.
This gives consistent property
rights to everyone across the
state and it gives the people
who build these things very
consistent rules around how they
can be built and designed.
So Madam Chair, it gives the big
developers.
Consistently, consistency in how
they do those rules, not the
local developers, right? Because
the local developers know what
they have to comply with in in
their
In their municipality or in
their county.
Madam Chair, um, senator. So
firstly, we're also one of the
only states that went up in cost
for the last 40% of cost for the
permitting process where one of
the most expensive states to
build.
So whether you're big or small
right now, we are asking
everyone to come to New Mexico
to actually help us with
building. Um, it's not, it's not
a matter, unfortunately of, of
big or small. It's really all of
the above. Um, so this is within
the consistency, the competitive
way in which we've done that is
actually pricing builders out of
being able to build at all
because of the challenge of
meeting the demand in um our
regulatory framework. Madam
Chair, how expensive are permits
in?
In New Mexico.
Um, it varies by jurisdiction,
permit, and impact fees, for
instance, in Santa Fe or close
to $10,000 a unit.
That's exactly right, and it, it
varies by jurisdiction. Is it
not gonna vary by jurisdiction?
Madam Chair, Senator, this does
not impact the cost of of fees,
uh, it's more designed to handle
the approval processes and where
they are and aren't approved.
That's right, this bill doesn't
do anything about fees. What
this bill does is it says on
page 3, zoning authorities,
including the zoning authorities
of Homero municipalities, that's
Albuquerque.
Shall
Accommodate housing by creating
a mechanism to allow up to 2
kitchens within a single family
zoning districts such as the
conditional such as conditional
use permits.
Can you explain?
What you intend by the
conditional use permit.
Um, for two conditions, cause if
it's a conditional use permit,
it's still gonna be a permit.
Isn't that correct, madam chair?
Madam Chair, Senator, this bill
would have minimal effect on
Albuquerque, who is already
legalized guest houses citywide.
Madam Chair, they don't do by
conditional use permit.
Madam Chair, Senator, yes, this,
that's restricting the ability
to apply conditional use
pertinent, which is usually an
additional level of hearing and
public hearing to do a permit
activity, so would have no
effect in any of the home rule
jurisdictions, none of which
currently require conditional
permitting for ADs.
OK, then, this is an accommodate
housing by creating a mechanism,
maybe I'm reading it wrong,
creating a mechanism to allow up
to 2 kitchens within a single
room, single family zoning
district.
Such as conditional use permits.
Is this saying you don't have to
apply for conditional use permit
or is it saying you must apply
for a conditional use permit.
It's kind of unclear.
It's on page 3.
Chair representative of, or
sorry, Senator, excuse me. This
is all existing language that,
uh the
multi-generational is crossed
out.
Madam Chair representative
that's just in order to be able
to um
Right. We've, we've stricken
multi-generational in order to
be able to talk about the new
accommodated housing with
accessory dwelling units in the
multi-family residential. We
don't use the term
multigenerational anymore. We
use multi-family residential,
um, and define it at the front
of the bill.
And so we're just accommodating
numbers 2 and 3 in that part of
the statue, um, and striking
multi-generational just to be
consistent with that language.
So that's that's the same.
This is already current law,
Madam Chair. So then it shall
accommodate multi-family
residential housing and
commercial zoning districts and
areas near transits as a
permitted use. That means no
permit. It's permitted. They
have, they will have to modify
their zoning.
Uh, Madam Chair, they will have
to modify their zoning
regulations. I'm referring to
anybody who doesn't have this
in.
I don't know real ranchers done
this or what, what other.
Committee communities have done
this, but that means they're
gonna have to amend their zoning
code.
To be consistent with this, is
that correct?
Mountain Chair Senator, yes, if
they some current zoning codes
may be out of compliance with
that.
So Madam Chair, what's the
consequence for failing to do
this?
Madam Senator, do you mean
failing to redesign a code
within the local jurisdiction.
Yes, ma'am.
Madam Chair, represented our
Senator, excuse me, I mean.
Because this would be, you know,
should this be enacted,
essentially if somebody came
with a permit opportunity to
want to build an EDU, they would
be able to essentially do that
under this, this statewide code.
The jurisdiction would then have
to figure out how to accommodate
essentially that request and
look at the local jurisdictional
framework about what would be
allowed or disallowed with this
is law. So essentially looking
at the accommodation for this
type of.
if the private um
The property owner wanted to do
so, but they would have to work
with that property owner about
how to do that.
Madam Chair, when um, God, I
can't believe I'm quoting
Cervantes.
We, um, I've been here too long.
Um,
It, when you have love and you
ask us a city to do it, to do
something, and the city doesn't
do it.
Is there any kind of consequence
for the city's failure to do it.
Madam Chair, senator.
We're asking this as an
opportunity and as far as a
mandate goes, there are no
consequences for enacting that.
I mean, a lawsuit could be
threatened perhaps from the
landowner for them not being
able to comply with the law
statewide, that would be up to
the landowner to take that
action should they not be
accommodated, um, but that would
be the only repercussion, you
know, the ultimately it's it's
to the will of the people to be
able to do something like this,
right? It's not a must do. It's
really the landowner opting.
So if they're not accommodated
by the city, you know, there's a
number of actions that could be
taken, as you know, um, but
nevertheless,
It it would really be up to the
city to to accommodate. Madam
chair, yes, um, this would
invite lawsuits if the if the if
the county and we've seen this
all over New Mexico. If the
county or the city, the
municipality, whoever's doing
the zoning code in the
particular area, did not like
this, and they refused to do it.
Basically, it creates a private
action for the
Person, the landowner or the
developer who wants to do this.
To bring a lawsuit against the
city and in the county.
Um
And that's all. That's, that's
all it creates, I'm sure.
Madam Chair Senator, so as we've
seen this enacted in other
states that has not been the
case, because of course, these
landowners and the builders of
these accessory dwelling units
are helping us solve a statewide
problem. Very many of, uh, we
haven't heard of a single case
where a lawsuit was threatened
and was um went through without
uh an ability to help that
landowner use that in order to
help us solve the housing
crisis. Many of these
jurisdictions are asking for
this, and again it's something
that we've seen.
studied across the country. This
is an opportunity for folks to
really help solve that crisis,
um, never have we heard of a
situation where lawsuits have
been, you know, promulgated.
This is now a systemic issue
where this these laws were
changed and, you know, we've
we've seen a real backlash in
any meaningful way at all. Um,
in fact, there's I don't think
of, we hadn't heard of a single
lawsuit filed um through this
course of of work.
Um, in, in every way we've
understood that these local
jurisdictions are trying to
accommodate this to help those
local landowners and to, to
ensure that these become
opportunities for people to
live.
Madam Chair, I'll listen to the
debate, but that's where I think
it belongs. If the local
jurisdictions are asking for
this, there's no reason that the
state should step in and tell
And, and do they have the power
right now to do it.
So if they want to do it, they
could do it.
Jurisdiction by jurisdiction in
Albuquerque is extremely
controversial thing. It finally
passed.
And I think it's good, and I
think it's because Albuquerque
is facing such a huge housing
crisis.
But I'm thinking about
Other jurisdictions that may not
have this problem, but yet they
forced to amend their zoning
code and if they're, they're
different kinds of communities
around the state, Ridoso is a
certain kind of community versus
a house with a certain kind of
community, and that's why we
have local
Zoning and that's why the state
delegates it to the communities.
I know because I'm dealing with
the, with the
Prohibition on rent control.
Once you do this, it's very hard
to reverse.
And it just stops the local, it
takes a tool away from the local
governments to address local
needs and so that's what
concerns me about this bill is
that the local government is
Going to be
Forced to do something.
It may not want to do. Um,
And I'll just leave it there,
madam chair.
Thank you. Any other questions?
Pinto. Thank you, Madam Chair.
answers
Um, how do HOAs factor into it?
Thank you, Senator, and thank
you, uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Pinto, um, they are exempt now
after the amendment. That is
something that concerned me
because people would talk about
their property value going up,
and they don't want to pay extra
taxes or the property value
going down and they don't want
to have less equity. And so, um,
that, that was a concern that I
shared. So we made an amendment,
uh, which is why I signed on,
was one of 3 amendments, but one
of the changes to say that in
existing um developments.
Maybe one's down the street from
here or where there are cabinets
that those are exempt.
Mass.
So if you have a multi-generate.
we went to. These are two
buildings.
Are they required then to
disclose that it's a rental
property or they just
that it's not what you're
getting around.
Um, especially when we talk
about insurance and appraisal.
Madam Madam Chair and senator,
well, who would they disclose it
to? So I mean a lot of folks
have garage apartments or they
have a casita, um, and I, I
don't think you, you have to be
properly insured if you have a
mortgage, you know, you, and I
don't think that changes
anything.
So Madam Chair, I would think
that if there's
think that it's a rental
property or if they're um
near not disclosing it then that
income too. It really
jeopardized the the owners.
especially if they're called out
on it. There's some kind of
issue.
Um
They have like rental insurance
or something.
Our family disputes.
Um, Madam Chair and senator, I
think that's, it would be sort
of status quo around those
things, um, the typical things
that property owners deal with.
I, I don't, I don't believe that
there would be any change
regardless.
Of whether this bill passed or
not.
If someone has a rental property
that's handled differently.
So Madam Chair and, um.
I think it's just that, that
amount of
of any kind of uh
Income or loss of income or
changes or people with fixed
incomes.
Because it's, as far as we're
seeing with the market
insurance.
It's gonna go up.
I hanged it down.
detrimental in some sense that
and another property seems to
Increase the risk
of the
a place, but
that is the
Mourners prerogative, but yeah.
We're not putting people out of.
by increasing unforeseen.
He did not factor
by doing so.
Thank you ma'am.
Madam Chair and Senator, I think
what we would hope to see was,
would be the opposite, um, as we
add housing capacity, we'd hope
to see some stabilization to the
cost and the rising rents and
mortgages and uh of course, we
also need to deregulate. So I
hope that would be a friendly
villain here, but um this one's
about having the opportunity to
create. We also have a silver
tsunami in New Mexico. So in my
district, for example, in Sierra
County, the average age is 58,
and I'm actually building an
additional dwelling.
unit for my mother right now. It
was quite a heavy lift to do and
it's not even a place where
there's high property value.
It's behind a dry dock marina
where I've moved to, and it was
quite a heavy lift.
and
Which is what we see is that the
lower end properties are being
bought out and then the.
Ma'am, thank you, Senator just
comment.
No, no, answer required.
Any other questions from
committee members?
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Nava.
With a second from Senator
Charlie.
And you can call the office.
center of luck. No.
In her boobs than our Charlie.
And our Gallegos.
And I know, yes, explain my
vote.
And Argento.
And I
Serio Lopez, no.
And Hickey, yeah.
And I love this.
No.
And to explain her remote,
Senator Nova.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representatives for
bringing the bill forward as
someone who's worked on housing
at the national level. I know
the importance of zoning reform
to ensure that we are driving
more construction and more
development in our state, so I
just want to commend you for
bringing the bill forward. I
know we're not the only state
we're quite behind other states,
uh, Madam Chair, uh, and members
in terms of development and
implementation of zoning laws
that allow for this to take.
Thank you.
Thank you. And with the vote of
3 in the in the affirmative and
6 in the negative, um, you're
building that pass.
Thank you.
When the Senate Bill 512.
this
Madam Chalico is your son of
Bill 512.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair
and members of the committee.
Um, I have Senate Bill 512 in
front of you.
Um, which is amending the
surprise billing Protection Act.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Um, that will, um,
Change the reimbursement rate,
Mr. Chair, just to be simple and
straightforward.
I do have an expert witness with
me if you'd like to add a few
words, Mister Chair, and then
we'll stand for questions.
Thank you very much. Do we have
anyone in the audience in
support.
Yes, if you would come forward.
No? OK. Anywhere in opposition?
Seeing none anyone online in
support.
Anyone in the opposition online.
OK, uh.
Now go to the committee for
questions and comments.
In that case, um,
I will just make one comment and
then we will proceed with the
roll call vote, um,
This is, uh, uh,
The surprise billing bill was a
great bill. I remember
consulting on it back in 2017,
before I came to the legislature
that in this updates the uh
payment methodologies so that
they're fair and equitable, um,
and so I certainly support the
bill and urge my colleagues to
do the same.
We called the role or if I can
have emotion.
OK.
OK, uh,
Senator Pinto, uh, made the
motion and the second by
Senator.
we call the.
And I
and I Charlie.
And
And Inova, yes, Senor Pinto.
Senator Scott.
Centerio Lopez, yes, and a
hickey, and I love this.
Yes.
Mr. Chair, if I may add one
comment, Senator Scherer and I
were both co-sponsors of the
Surprise Billing Act when it was
in the legislature back in the
day.
Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
By a vote of 7 to 2, you have a
due pack. Thank you very much.
And Madam Chair, I think we're
adjourned for the evening for
the evening.
Thank you very much. Thank you,
everybody.
I'm sorry. Is that done with
committee, yes.
But, but.
We go to the floor, so there's
Irish stew is awaiting all of
us.
No, no, not yet. We're, we're in
recess. We're recessed.
