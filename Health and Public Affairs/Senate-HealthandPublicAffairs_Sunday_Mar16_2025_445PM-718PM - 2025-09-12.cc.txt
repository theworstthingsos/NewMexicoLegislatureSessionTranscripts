Half of that 8% were terminated.
Within 180 days, that gives me
pause.
The
If those folks.
The other 4% of those folks.
That were terminated uh
would now be permanent employees
and does that make that
termination process.
Significantly more arduous.
Madam Chair, Senator, that's a
really good question. And so let
me, I, I.
I do personnel as an attorney,
not for the state. Um, I've been
on the other side of what the
state um uh personnel act is as
a supervisor. And what I will
say is that whether you
terminate someone at one month.
Or you terminate someone at 8
months.
There is no such thing as
terminating someone for no
reason. I just want to make that
really clear.
You always have to have some
sort of a reason. The law
doesn't require that you have a
reason.
But because of filing could be
made to the HRB.
The Human Rights Bureau, a
filing could be made of
discrimination as an attorney,
it's always my recommendation to
the employer that you have to
have a reason because you have
to be able to show that that
reason wasn't discriminatory.
So what happens right now at the
end of one year is, yes, there
is more due process.
Um, and this due process would
be applicable at 6 months in
this case. So it's not more
arduous. It may take a little
more effort and a little more
time, but you always have to
have a reason for why someone's
being terminated.
Would you like an explanation of
what the process is.
a chair and Senator, I'd like an
explanation of the
A delta, the differential
between
Probationary and
non-probationary terminations
because this could have.
on this.
Thank you, um, Madam Chair,
Senator, I'm gonna let the
expert witness answer that
question.
And who are you expert with it?
Madam Chair and Senator, my, my
name is Lindsay Hurst, um, I'm
currently serving as the
executive vice president of CWA
7076. We represent uh state
employees at 13 state agencies.
It's about 2700 positions. I am
also a state employee of over 10
years.
Um, so that's who I am. And then
to get back to your question,
uh, so, so once someone is off
probation, um,
Well, let me, let me back up
just a moment.
Employees are evaluated a couple
times a year, OK? So at the
beginning of the year, and this
is for probationary and off
probation.
Um, there is a meeting where you
set goals for the year and
expectations of the job.
There is an interim evaluation
halfway through the year about
where the uh manager and the
employee will sit down and see,
OK, how's it going? Where are we
at? What needs improvement, um,
and where are you meeting
expectations. And then at the
end of the year, there's a final
evaluation.
So, essentially,
That continues throughout an
entire career.
And if um a career status
employee who's off probation is
having troubles not meeting
expectations. They are given the
opportunity to improve. But the
same thing is true, typically
when you're on probation. So if
someone's having a little
trouble getting the hang of
something, they're gonna be told
that their interim evaluation
and given the opportunity.
To improve. So that, that's for
um essentially job duties. If
there is a different type of
situation where um there's
unprofessional conduct or
something like that, depending
on how egregious it is, then,
um, the, the employer can
proceed with disciplinary action
through those processes.
And Madam Chair, is
all that accelerate with the 6
month time limit.
instead of 6 months.
Evaluating 3 months, etc.
Uh, Madam Chair and senator, um,
Uh, the, the time period to be
evaluated and have your interim
evaluations. Yes, that will
accelerate a little bit. But
essentially the, the, um, the
same process applies.
Last question, Madam Chair.
editor, what prompted the names
for this.
OK
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator,
excellent question. Um, I
appreciate it. Uh, basically we
are losing, um, I, well, let me
let me uh give you a little
background. In FY 24, 1/3, 34%
of new hires did not complete
probation. Of those, 75% chose
to resign.
During probation, workers are
not able to access the full
benefits of state employment,
including alternative work
schedules, fitness and wellness
time, 2 additional personal
leave days and union membership.
And where this, let me, let me
give you an example a brief
example, uh, alternative work
schedules are really critical,
especially for employees that
are coming in from a previous
career where they're gonna
expect a little bit of
flexibility in scheduling. Um,
on probation, employees who are
not uh shift workers are
required to work a strict 8 to 5
schedule with a 1-hour lunch.
Uh, a lot of employees who are
commuting to Santa Fe for their
positions or, or commuting into
Albuquerque from New Mexico. Um,
This means that they may have
additional time before and after
work, they may not be able to
pick their children up on time.
We have lost people because they
could not leave at 4:30 to make
it in time to pick their child
up from daycare during the
probationary period. So, so
those are the reasons.
That this is important.
Adam Chair, Senator, and you may
have lost me.
With that
Flexible schedule.
Because
I can't get my constituents.
Can get a live person.
that answer the telephone in
state government.
I cannot tell you.
The number of times I have
Constituent coming to me
pleading.
was a problem.
They called.
Secretary of State's office, tax
and Rev.
You, you name the agency.
We just can't get anybody to
call us back, and that's got to
change.
Madam chair and senator, we need
a little customer service in
this state.
Yeah
From, from the
The fact that I get from my
constituents on so many
occasions.
If I call.
And I say this is state
representative Larry Scott.
District 62 and Hobbs. Here's my
problem.
The problems invariably are
solved.
In a day or two.
I have to get home.
That's wrong
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
Madam Chair, could I just
respond, or would you rather?
So we'll just, there wasn't a
question. It was, it was a
statement. Senator Block.
think about a chair, um,
I, I have some of those concerns
that Senator Scott has, but
I also
I think I kind of like this and
I wanna, I need you to convince
me here on a couple of things.
Um, 6 months. You mentioned
training.
Training is critical. Um,
And um, Madam Chair and um.
I'm sorry, what? I didn't catch
your, your, your name.
No
Did you, did you say? I know
you. Oh, Lindsay.
Lindsay, you're a state worker,
right? And, and where do you
work?
Me and Senator, I, I am
currently an employee of the New
Mexico Environment department.
OK.
Uh, do you, uh, Madam Chair
Lindsey, do you, do, uh, human
resources or training in that
department?
Madam and senator, uh, no, I do
not do human resources. I do do
training.
Of other employees a lot of
employees do.
OK, uh, Madam Chair, Lindsay,
are you like maybe the head,
head trainer?
Instructor in in that
department.
Madam Cha Senator, no, I'm not.
OK.
Um, well, Madam Chair, Lindsay,
you're, you're, you're gonna
have to answer these training
questions anyway.
Um,
And I understand it's just the
environment department.
So, when a new person gets hired
in the environment department.
Uh, Depending on what job they
have to.
What percentage of those
employees
Um, have training that takes
less than 6.
Madam Chair and senator to, to
be clear, I am here today
speaking in my capacity as a
union officer. I cannot speak
for the environment department,
um, in answer to your question,
um, it, it depends on the, the
position. So it depends on the
complexity of the position. So
for our professionals, our
environmental scientists, etc.
um, training can be ongoing, um,
a lot of times there are
processes put in place so that
newer employees who are doing
the
work, um, are still meeting
expectations where they're
paired with more senior
employees for peer review.
of work.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I, I
guess what I'm trying to, I'm
trying to find a comparison
between
How we did it in the Air Force.
And versus how you guys are
doing in the states because you
come in the Air Force, you go
through.
Baer training or you go through
a commissioning program then you
go off to a tech school and you
get certified.
Level 3 or whatever it is, and,
and there's a lot of schools in
the Air Force that are
Well, less than 6 months and
more than 6.
Um
So, uh, the reason why I asked
that is because
Based on the amount of training
you need, 6 months is a is a
tough time to kind of gauge if
that employees the right fit or
not if they're.
Progressing through the
training. That's, that's where I
was going with that.
And um I know you don't know the
entire state government when it
comes to that, and I was just
trying to kind of get a gauge
of, of
your department where you've
been working for 10 years.
As a trainer, um.
So in the in the bill, I
Madam Chair, can you, can you go
back and just tell us why, why
are people not getting through
the 6 months is because of a
flexible schedule.
Madam Chair and senator, it,
it's, it's a number of things. I
mean, some people, uh, resigned
of their own accord for, for
unknown reasons, but we have
heard a lot of feedback that the
scheduling is causing a lot of
challenges. And so that's,
that's our primary example we
bring up.
OK, thank you. So, Madam Chair,
if it's
180 days or 365.
It's really not gonna matter, is
it? Because the jobs the job,
and if you don't get the
flexible scheduling.
You're not gonna make it through
the probationary period because
Uh
If that's the number one answer,
I, I don't know if it is, but if
that's the number one answer,
flexible schedule, it doesn't
matter if you have 180 day
probationary period or a year
long. Is that, is that a fair
assumption?
Madame Chair, Senator, uh, I, I
think it is a fair assumption to
say whether it's 6 months, 180
days, or a year, that there's
going to be some folks who are
just going to
I do not, uh, I don't think what
we're saying is that the
flexible schedule is the only
reason because a flexible
schedule doesn't mean that
there's not gonna be workforce
there during the 8 to 5, right,
a flexible schedule means that
you and an employee never
automatically gets a flexible
schedule. The supervisor has a
responsibility and the head of
the agency.
To make sure that there's
adequate personnel there to
answer the phone to review
emails to accept people who are
walking into the agency.
But think about how it was in.
military.
For example,
What I find with individuals who
are on probation is, I do kind
of know what their what their
work ethic is by the 1st 3
months, quite on.
Um, if you don't know what their
work ethic is and what their
ability to learn the the
material that they're being
trained in by that time period,
I think you're just not.
And so what happens though is
that for a whole year,
They feel like they're not
really part of the team.
That they're not really part of
what the agency is doing.
And making them part of the
team, giving them access to a
flexible schedule if it's
possible, giving them access to
the ability to have 30 extra
minutes, um, for exercise, uh,
during their lunch break or, you
know, any of those other
benefits, the additional time
off, the um the, the accrual of
personal leave, it does, in
fact, make a difference.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair. I, I would agree
with that.
And, and where I was going is,
in my opinion, if you're
training, you get hired.
On
January 1st.
You have to go through and get
certified on a bunch of
different tabs.
It takes you
2 or 3 months.
You know, you might be a little
bit of a slow learner, and that
might not be.
an adequate gauge to say, all
right, I don't think you're
gonna really do well the next 3
months before we can yeah.
Um
But then again, you know, you
could be a fast learner and do
really well and, and you're
gonna excel. I, I was really on
this, I was, I was trying to
support it based on the amount
of time it takes somebody to get
trained, get certified, get up
to speed, and be productive in
the office doing the mission.
And then boom, they're good,
because quite frankly, I, I
don't think 6 months is good
enough because in the Air Force.
If you're a
I'll just say like for me as a
missile launch officer going
through almost a year of school
learning the weapon system.
And you get to the unit and
you're on alert.
You're, you got to meet all
these milestones of training and
your, it, it takes a while. And
if you don't do good, you're,
you know,
Don
Um
Yeah, you don't need to be in
that job.
So
I guess I'm giving the worker
the benefit of the doubt.
That 6 months is probably not
enough time to really
Learn how the office works.
all the training then you're
starting to do the job. That's
where I was going with that, but
Senator Scott's concerns, I
mean, I, I think we all hear
that, you know, they're all
working from home or something,
or a lot of people are, I don't
know, but no one's answering the
phone whether they're at home or
work.
No one gets back to you. That's
a big in government.
Um, no one ever responds back to
you.
So
I think the feds.
Uh, Madam Sheriff Senator, it's
a one year probation.
Uh, with the federal government.
Is that correct?
Just say yes. Um, Madam Chair, I
think the answer yes
OK.
And I think that matches up
pretty well. I think one year is
a fair amount of time, but quite
frankly,
I, I think some of these people
are gonna be gone.
Because you just don't wanna
They want to do something,
they're not getting their way on
something, they're gonna be gone
anyway.
Um, how do you, how do you, uh,
terminate an employee, Madam
Chair, Senator?
After one year if they're not
performing.
Madam Chair, Senator, I, I just,
I wanna just really quickly
speak up on behalf of state
employees. I, I spent over 25
years with state employees and,
and I just have to say that I, I
very few found very few that
didn't do the job that they
hired to do.
Dedicated people, there are
families, there are neighbors,
and, and they do for the most
part, come on. I have had
determinate people. I, you know,
will admit that, um, but for the
most part, they really do their
job and so, um,
You
Repeat it. Yeah, thank you. I'm
sorry, I just got caught up on
so I don't senator, uh, you
know, I know the vast majority
of these workers are good. We,
we all know that there's some.
Some non-performance. Got it.
So after one year,
How, how do you terminate after
a year? Thank you. Sorry I lost
track of my thoughts. Um, Madam
Chair, Senator, uh, so a notice
of contemplated action would be
issued and then the employee
would have, and that's just to
say like we're, we're, we're
notifying you that we're
contemplating taking this
action.
Call it an MCA.
And then the employee has, I
believe, 11 days to respond to
that and to request, I believe,
a hearing, um, or an opportunity
to meet with their supervisor,
and, and, and then the process,
you know, can go further, but
the notice of contemplated
action is the first. OK. So,
Madam Chair, Senator, you can
still terminate somebody after
the probationary.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator, you
can still terminate somebody up
through that probationary
period, but you still have to
give them a notice that you're,
you know what I mean, you still
have to go through some of that
madam, Senator, that you still
have to go through the due
process of what no, Madam Chair,
Senator, no due process doesn't
doesn't assign to um individuals
that are on probation.
No, no, no, um, Senator, Madam
Chair, after one year, they have
to go through some type of due
process to get terminated is
where I was going within the
probationary period, it's
It, it's, it's pretty quick, I
would imagine, Madam Chair,
Senator, it is. There is no, no
true due process.
um
that connected to a probationary
employee, um, Madam Chair
Senator.
Can, do you, do you have the
statistics if, if an employee
can't make it through training
or whatever it is, um,
Is that grounds for dismissal
within the probationary period?
And do you see that? that's
something you guys keep track of
that does happen at times,
right? For example, if you're um
going through the police
academy.
And you can't pass it, then your
job is there.
Based upon the fact that you're
going to be a police officer.
If you can't obtain being a
police officer, then you're, you
would be terminated.
And there would be due, you
know, there would be just cause
for you to be terminated, um,
because you weren't
OK.
Um, Madam chair, Senator, I'm,
I'm leaning towards supporting
it cause I, I think
It should match up with kind of
what the feds have, you can
still terminate people if
they're not performing by going
through the due process after
they've had probationary period.
I'm good with that.
Uh, 6 months is
There's not a lot of time
because in my opinion, you know,
sometimes life happens in 6
months where there's something
that goes on in a person's life
and they, hey, they got to take
2 weeks off unpaid leave or
something.
Uh, to take care of an issue,
so.
Um
I, I just think 6 months is
probably not a good gauge.
um
see where this person is, so um.
Thanks for answering the
questions and um I look forward
to hearing any other um
discussion. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. Um, why not just
offer the benefits upfront.
Without having to get through
the probationary period while
still having a probationary.
Madam Chair Senator, um, I think
you may, I'm not sure if you
read in the FIR but those
benefits, um, the, the
additional time, believe, those
are determined by rules, and so
they could in fact be changed,
but they've been the way that
they are in rules for many,
many, many.
And um I don't, I, I can't
answer why the state personnel
office hasn't changed that, so
that they are available during
probation, but they did make it
very clear in the FIR that
extending, uh, I mean,
shortening the probationary
period, um, is not, um, uh,
Doesn't
Doesn't stop those benefits or
confer those benefits. What
confers it and doesn't confer it
is the term of what you are.
probationary or not.
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator,
thank you for that. Uh, well,
like, the workforce is changing.
It has changed.
Um
I've run several
Organization and
Um
How to adjust the way that I
was.
Managing those organizations,
running those organizations day
to day to meet, meet the, the
real demands of workers.
Um, they expect flexibility, the
tenure is 2 years, at least in
the nonprofit world, it's 2
years before somebody decides to
move on to another position. So
the 6 month period is a quarter
of their time if it's the if
it's
It matches what happens um for
people's tenure in state
government, they expect um
benefits and pay time off. I
mean, it has just changed. That
is just the reality of where we
are now.
Um
So that, that was my only
question. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Pinto.
Thank you and my chair and
the bill.
New Mexico is and fire at will
state.
I'm sorry, could you, Madam
chair, a senator, New Mexico's
at will state.
fire at will.
Madam Chair, that is correct.
Madam Chair and senator.
How come we have to go?
It right in half.
Good question.
Why don't we just incrementally
go from 12 to 11.
And then see what happens.
I go all the way down to 6.
Madam Chair, Senator, um, so the
state Personnel Act is what
confers those rights upon an
employee, and that's what this
is proposing to amend.
Um, uh, why not go down to 11
months or 6 months. I think the
6 months is plenty of time, and
I do think that it's much more
in line with what private
business does, um, in regards to
probation, and they do it for
many of the same reasons that
have already been stated, which
is they become a member of the
team, um, they have benefits
that are conferred on them, um,
so, so it, the 6 month is just
much more in line and if with
All due respect for the work
that we do, I think changing law
is like growing a second head.
So Madam Jain, Senator.
The current climate right now.
I think it doesn't gonna be very
crucial.
Um
I find it hard to support it.
Because I think there's some
when it's out there that
After COVID, that.
They think they have this.
Luxury of kind of performing.
Or
Yeah, have a luxury of saying,
well, this is when I want to
work.
But
State government, um, and having
those services available.
I think it's, it's, it's
necessary as Senator Scott
mentioned.
I still go to some of these uh
state offices and at lunchtime.
Nobody's there.
They're like, oh, well,
You can wait, came in like 5
minutes to 12, everybody's at
lunch, so you have to wait there
for an hour.
Um
But yeah, we are this we are
providing this service.
I think it's
I don't know what where the
perception is.
To think that they have that.
Luxury in that sense, but she
wouldn't we're in state
government trying to make sure
our constituents and our New
Mexicans have the
Ability
Come in.
to a state office.
Monday through Friday.
8 to 5 and really have
The services that are to be
provided, someone's there to do
the work.
And
Maybe it's just also because of
where I come from, the way my
government, um, performs to.
People in the rural areas do not
have the ability.
you
Just
Come back. I'll come back in
about an hour back in or the
next day because so and so's not
here.
It is detrimental to some of the
services that we have, that they
Yet
But they need that, they almost
like.
That they get seen, they get
what they need and taken care of
within a reasonable amount of
time.
And
Some
It seems like there's some that
get very comfortable.
Where they're at that they.
But now it's very critical and
uh it's.
Um
I don't know if it's the
culture.
it's just a very different time
for some of our workers that men
with, I don't know if it's a
generational thing, but
It seems like we are having a
real big issue.
All around when I talked to
several people that are
supervisors.
About
Coming in and just thinking, oh
well, I'm gonna step out and
we'll get whatever for for me or
pick up my child, knowing that
you're supposed to be there too.
So
It
I don't know for public
employees.
That's something
that we should need to, we need
for.
Thank you, Senator. Senator
Galgos.
Thank you chair and center and
Lindsey, I did catch it.
Uh, I was just gonna ask, I, I
want to go back for a moment and
your discussion, you're talking
about uh 34% that did not stay
and then uh 75% that it quit.
Go over those numbers again. Uh,
here's where my thought is.
Um,
That's a lot of employees. I
I run a construction.
Uh, we've got
2nd and 3rd generation employees
for the ramp of the dad and the
son work there.
Um, for your 5th generation
family.
loans coming, but we don't get a
lot of lungs.
After the year.
Or we get our laws up close and
up front.
A lot of it is too man churn.
So
And he is
of the training, so, uh, since
we do construction, we've got uh
multiple hours in the first day
of safety, just nothing but
safety. They don't leave the
facility.
And the next day if they're
going to crush.
And they've got because of.
Mine Safety Act
They have days of training out
there.
And I'm just wondering.
on your cutting the hours or
cutting down to 6 months.
Now that's planned or if you
looked at.
Affect those numbers because I
think that in my reality where I
live.
What we do
Uh
That shorter period of time.
Isn't going to give me the
evaluation.
be able to, I, I know we're
talking about public.
employees?
But you've referred to private
sector.
And private sector.
And I don't think the 6 months
gives me the amount.
But I need to look at and I'm
just wondering if you guys have
researched those numbers.
If, if any, or where you're at
now.
If you cut it in half.
What it would do to
in
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator, if
I'm following, um,
Uh, yes, it is, it is a high
percentage that choose to resign
in the current one year
probationary period. Um, and you
were right. So, so again, the
numbers were uh 34% of new hires
did not complete probation and
75% of those chose to resign.
So, so those are the numbers,
um.
Yeah
It is our hope that that the
retention will increase.
With this change and with
getting some of the, the, um,
career status employee benefits
sooner. Uh, there are a lot of
things impacting uh vacancy rate
in state government. Um, many of
you have, have talked about uh
concerns around scheduling
around available services and
such, and, and vacancy rates are
chronically high, uh, right now,
which is, which is really our
biggest problem, and that is a
result of, of salaries.
That is a result of um in, in
some work units, the, the
culture, um.
And
So it's not all this um.
Madam Chair, Senator. Um, so,
so.
As has been said.
It really is a different
environment. I want to remind
the committee that every day
10,000 people on average in the
United States turned 65.
The baby boom generation is
retiring.
And there's not enough employees
to fill the positions. And so,
you know, we, we could try to
equate it to COVID, but the
reality is, is that our
workforce is shrinking, and the
services that need to be
provided are increasing. And so
there are people, so, so
employers are competing with one
another. They're competing with
one another, for some of an
employees.
We are looking for that kind of
life work balance.
They're working for um uh pay
their work look looking for.
And um, you know, if you just,
if you ask a young person who's
in the workforce. What is
Looking for in their jobs, it's
gonna be a variety of things,
and the state has the ability to
be an employer of choice. It
used to be when I was younger,
that the state was an employer
of choice because it had a
really good retirement plan, and
it had excellent healthcare
benefits.
That's still the case. It's
still good retirement plan, and
it's still good healthcare
benefits for the most part, but
the reality is, is that younger
generations are looking for that
flexibility.
My daughters worked remotely for
10 years now, and she does it
because she prefers to work at
home and have that flexibility,
but she performs better than
than many people who come into
the office every day.
And so, you know, the state is
transitioning into ways that are
going to have that kind of
environment so that you can
still get the customer service,
and the customer service comes
through programs like
Having a voice message that or a
phone. I don't mean a voice
message a phone system that
traffics, right? It tracks the
calls that are coming in. I
cannot tell you how many times
as a superintendent that I would
have a representative or a
senator or someone call me and
say, this person has tried 20
times and they can't get anybody
to answer the phone. Once I set
it up so that I have a specific
call center where I could
monitor what calls were coming
in and who was.
I promise you that 9 times out
of 10, they haven't called.
And so, you know, people get
frustrated and sometimes the the
number might be wrong. There's,
there's a variety of reasons it
happens, but
But I, I do think for the most
part that states state agencies
are really doing the best they
can with a shortage of
employees, and this is truly a a
way for us to have that one
more, you know, benefit for
balancing out work and life.
Thank for that man turning
center at all agree with you on
the
the number didn't go through.
It continued change of
secretaries.
I can't even get to a secretary.
Without trying to find out.
who else I would contact uh to
find that number.
Uh, a lot of times I go end up
going into the regular.
Website and get
A person and then asked to speak
to the, so I know there's some
that goes on, but I guess my
thing going back to these 34%,
75%.
And if I understood right, other
states around us.
Already use this, we looked at
any of the benefits they've
received.
I do this turned center and.
And
I'm chairing Senator, um, I, I
have not looked at that.
I have not looked at that. We,
we just simply looked at, you
know, the amount of the duration
of probationary periods.
For comparison. I appreciate the
honestyarian sector.
Madam Charon, Senator Lindsey,
uh.
I would try to look into that
because if this bill doesn't
pass this year.
Probably need the detail like
that next year,
uh, just because of the, the on
assessment.
It's what someone else has done
with this, but uh I do have
center
my last question is, so my other
hat is not on school board. Now,
we don't hire and fire staff.
In more
But I do know.
And it's really hardship on us
thinking through a school year.
Uh, because it's, it's different
than the calendar year.
And if you're cutting 6 months.
And down
How does that affect the school
system?
and
Madam Chair, um, Senator, you've
actually asked me something that
I actually have a lot of
experience on because I, that's
what I do as an attorney. I work
within the school personnel Act,
and so keep in mind though, as
you know, teachers are different
because they get a contract for
the first year and then they get
a contract for renewal the 2nd
year, and what the courts have
said is that once you get that
second contract and you accept
it, you're basically a full
time, you know, you're a
permanent employee and now the.
process right. But you may
remember a couple of years ago,
and this is when I was still in
the house. We passed legislation
to get classified employees
non-licensed employees is what
we call them in the schools, um,
to get not unlicensed employees
of one year probation, so that
they were more in line with um
the state.
Because of the the state has the
one year. And so a custodian or
a uh secretary, yeah, yeah,
yeah, food service, um, those
individuals can be terminated at
any time. Um, you don't have to
wait till the end of the year
with the licensed employees you
actually have to go through the
due process during the contract
because now you're talking
contract law, so it's really
hard to compare apples and
oranges with state employees.
It's a very, it's a whole
different personal like state
personnel act and the school
employees and very, very
different, so I can't make that
kind of comparison.
Thanks for that. That was my
last question. I just wanted to
make sure we weren't.
Creating a conflict with the
contract.
So we had lawsuit just straight
again.
It was
and I thank you.
Thank you, Senator Synvia Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I've um,
in the times that I have
supervised employees at the
clinical law program.
The law school and um it in
Lasario.
And to more limited extent as an
attorney, I've known way before
6 months, whether this is gonna
work out. Um, and so I, I think
6 months is plenty. I think it's
great that it aligns us with the
city. That's what we lose a lot
of employees to them, so, um, I,
I think this is a, a good idea,
um, especially when people
I, I really, I hadn't thought
about what you said before about
it makes them feel part of a
team, but that's really true.
When they pass the, the
probationary period is a shift
and they're, you know, they
start engaging more with, with
common activities and uh
parties and and all of that. So
I uh
When you're ready for a a
motion, Madam Chair, I'm happy
to make one.
Thank you. Any other questions?
Oh, Senator Black for a second
time. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um, Senator,
If this bill
In my opinion, and I don't know
if you agree with it, you can
tell me if I'm just
in left field, but
The state of New Mexico, the
state government is gonna have
some labor shortages, whether
this is 6 months or a year
probation period anyway.
In I in left field on that or am
I?
Be Care Center, that's why I, I
said there's 10,000 baby boomers
a day.
A
states that are retired.
The, the generation that's
retiring is is needing a lot of
of assistance and um
A a lot of different reasons,
but the workforce is just, it's
a worker's.
Workforce very moment, so you're
right. This is not the one fix
all for uh it reducing.
The um uh employment vacancy
rate for state government, but
we do believe and that's why
we're here today, that it's,
it's something that
Madam Chair and senator, because
I
I, I read somewhere where we had
a high turnover rate.
Um
Even after the provisionary
period was over.
New Mexico.
I'm not sure what the numbers
were, but I, I read a report
somewhere that showed that
I think the average state worker
Starting out
I don't know if I still working,
but there was a pretty high
percentage of of state workers
that didn't even last like 3
years they quit.
Or something like that, so the
probationary period, in my
opinion, whether it's 6 months
or a year.
I like, I like the.
Um
I don't think it really matters.
Senator, it really just depends.
I mean, we've read that CYFD
struggles keeping people after
their 6 month training program.
And the reason being that people
get into that job and they think
it's gonna be something that
it's not.
Or the stress of it is just
really hard, and they just
decide this is not for me.
I think the same thing happens
with the um, uh, you know,
other, other, um employment jobs
that are just really we're
asking really difficult things.
Um, and so it's not surprising
to me. We know that teachers,
and again, it's a whole
different area, but 50% of the
teachers that enter the
workforce leave within the 1st 5
years. And so it's not uncommon
for a high um uh responsibility
and high stress job to lose
employees, they just self select
that this is not the thing for
them. The other thing, and I
think Senator Charlie had
already mentioned it, is that
You know, the, the workforce
isn't like it was when I was
growing up, where people stayed
in a job for a whole lifetime.
My dad was a truck driver his
whole life.
And, um, you know, he wouldn't
have dreamed of doing some of
the stuff that I've done.
But now, if you can keep an
employee for 2 years, you're in
really good shape if you keep
them beyond that, then, you
know, you're, you're doing
something, you know, really
right, or they just really like
what they do, but, but people
move jobs and they move jobs for
different reasons.
OK, and, and benefits and
sometimes it's just location.
And, and Madam chair and
Senator, I, I'll just close with
these last two points is
You know, there are so many
departments in so many different
diversity of jobs where I think
in some departments that
turnover would be higher than
others that maybe CYFD because
It can just be depressing and
grind you down where.
For other other guys might just
like working on robes and
they're just happy being out
there, you know, outside and.
doing, doing whatever, um.
But I also just think it's a, a
culture like you were talking
about.
And uh in a work ethic.
Some people that
Probably need a little bit of a
Push to
their work ethic.
My opinion, but I, I think I
support this.
Um, I don't think it's gonna
matter. I think we're still
gonna be short staffed and some
of the rural areas maybe that's
Pinto was talking about or some
of the urban areas.
My district
But
6 months doesn't really give you
A
get a bunch of people still
going through some training and
trying to understand the
organization. So, um,
support
Thank you, man. Thank you.
Thank
you, Senator Sinello.
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Silvio Lopez with
the second.
No.
Can you please call the roll.
center of luck. I
Then boon, Charlie.
And our Gallegos.
And another, yes, and Ito.
The scope
Lopez,
yes.
And no hickey,
and Lopez.
Yes.
And just one final comment. It's
a mix of what we need to do to
help.
He retain employees.
So
And it's a different generation.
And if you talk to the young
people, it's they have a whole
different set of.
Whatever, um they consider is
work.
And part of it, I believe too
is.
listening
Because they could do so much on
this.
And the expectation is, why
can't they do it work?
And just talking to a few 19
year olds recently opened my
eyes.
So thank you you have a Duplass
recommendation.
By a vote of 63.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and, and
I have great respect for the
younger generation's work ethic.
I really do.
Um
Is there anyone here for house
Bill 77?
Thompson we'll come back to that
one.
Um
And I know that uh also 117.
I'm sorry. You, you're here for
House Bill 77. I'm sorry.
OK, Senator, then go ahead and
come back.
Just
OK, here she comes.
OK, how's Bill 77 annual federal
Snap state outreach plans.
Senator Burham.
On behalf of Representative
Thompson.
Yes.
Thank you, Madam Chair. The
House Bill 77 is a simple bill
that was presented to the
Interim Legislative Health and
Human Services Committee has
passed unanimously its whole way
here.
And would require the domeso
Healthcare Authority to seek
federal funding to match
charitable or other funds used
for community outreach.
To enroll in the Mexicans in
SNAP programs.
The federal government permits
states to submit annual snap
outreach plans to seek federal
matches for charitable or
government funds, and this bill
simply requires
That each submit a plan
annually.
And without question.
Or sorry, my experts who would
like to introduce themselves.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and
senators. My name is Shanice
Satrian, and I'm a healthcare
advocate and clinical social
worker with the New Mexico
Center on non-poverty.
Every New Mexican deserves
access to affordable, high
quality food, yet far too many
of our families continue to
struggle with food insecurity.
Currently, 1 in 5 children.
And 1 in 7 adults in New Mexico
face this challenge.
The supplemental nutrition
assistance program, SNAP, or
formerly known as food stamps is
our primary tool for adjusting
food insecurity.
It does this by providing
families with federally funded
with a federally funded monthly
benefit that can be used to
purchase not unprepared food.
Uh, Snap is critical in
supporting families,
particularly those with
children, older adults, and
individuals with disabilities.
Despite this, we know that many
New Mexicans qualify for this
assistance, but they do not
receive it. This is especially
true for our older adults.
According to the 2022 report
from the ARP just 38% of
eligible adults age 50 or older
participate in staff in New
Mexico.
So HB 77 would leverage federal
funding to increase staff access
to those who qualify through the
snap outreach class.
The bill is very simple. It
requires that HCA submit an
annual plan to the USDA.
Detailing staff outreach efforts
in New Mexico and seeking
federal matching funds for
non-profit or other state funds
used for snap outreach.
New Mexico has already begun
submitting Snap outreach funds
in 2023 and has mashed funds
used by Roadrunner Foodbank for
snap enrollment.
The benefits of Snap are
extensive and very well
documented. They reduced food
insecurity, which improves um
health outcomes, especially for
very young children and older
adults.
It's been documented to improve
both educational and economic
outcomes for families by
reducing food costs.
And it also benefits
Uh, New Mexico because these,
this money is is spent in over
1700 of our businesses,
generating $1 150 cents in
economic activity for every uh
For every $1 of SNAP benefits
that are spent. I want to thank
the sponsor for HB 77, is
community-based enrollment and
outreach ensures that when New
Mexican families can access SAP.
Including those who face
language barriers,
transportation challenges, and
limited internet access.
And with that, I'll turn it over
to my colleague Jason Riggs.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh, senators,
uh, my name is Jason Riggs. I'm
with Road Runner Food Bank. I'm
the director of advocacy and
public policy, and I very much
welcome this opportunity to be
here with you all on a Sunday
afternoon, uh, in 2013,
Roadrunner Food Bank started a
Snap outreach program. Uh, a lot
of food banks around the country
did at that time.
Uh, simply put, Snap can provide
9 times the amount of meals as
the entire nationwide food bank
system. So it's imperative that
we connect every person that
qualifies for that benefit to
it. Um,
I was the one who spearheaded
the program and it started out
just me, one man show, uh,
eventually we were able to grow
through grants and we spent a
lot of time not in the field and
instead trying to get grants to
finance the program, come to
find out other states were
drawing down matching funds by
submitting state snap outreach
plans to the USDA. So this is
something, uh, our neighbors in
Nebraska, and Texas,
Pennsylvania have been doing for
a long, long time.
Uh, finally, after quite some
time, uh, we did start
partnering with uh the HCA more
and more. Uh, this allowed for a
lot of communication.
So when Snap allotments drop,
say, in uh March of 2023, we
were able to communicate through
the Foodbank network to people
that might be receiving it to
your benefits are going to go
down.
And uh we were able to really
increase our, our outreach, uh,
eventually the state did file a
state outreach plan and fiscal,
uh, federal fiscal year 24, and
Road Runner Food Bank was the
first community-based
organization to work with the
state on this plan. Uh, the
money that we, uh, received from
matching funds paid for half of
our program, and allowed us to
expand our outreach, uh, in the
communities where we worked
before.
Our Snap Outreach team.
Compled about 371 SNAP
applications.
When we look at those numbers,
According to the Feeding America
Snap Impact calculator.
Uh, 371 completed submitted
approved Snap applications
equals about 284,931 meals in
the state of New Mexico that
wouldn't have been there.
That means $1,57,094 in benefits
coming through Snap allotment
from the feds.
being spent here in New Mexico.
And with economic impact that my
colleague just mentioned of a $1
to $1.50 it comes out to about
$1.6 million in economic impact
here in New Mexico, uh, during a
time when food costs are going
up. So the, the value of the
state committing to an outreach
plan and working with
community-based organizations
like Road Runner Food Bank.
We're now joined by Echo and
there's a possibility for a lot
more community-based
organizations to start doing
snap Outreach and to uh really
reach the community.
that they serve in ways that
only they can do.
I'll leave you with this.
Thanks to the uh matching funds
we've gotten, we have been able
to expand our outreach, uh,
we've been able to do a regular
outreach at the at the VA
hospital in Albuquerque, and uh
I remember a few years back
before we had all this, I, I was
at the VA, uh, I was helping,
uh, a Vietnam era veteran on
oxygen. This was a gentleman who
I don't think was going to be
able to wait in line at the
healthcare authority office.
Um
Going online to apply that was
not going to be a possibility
for him, but I, uh, helped him
out with the application, we
submitted it, and I very, very
much remember him telling me.
That he's never ever had to ask
for help before.
And he really, uh, he felt a
shame in that. I, I did my best
to try to make him feel better
about it, uh, but
This is kind of individual we're
talking about folks that might
not be able to apply on their
own, might not understand how it
works or that there even is a
SNAP program, uh, they might
think that Snap is just for
people with children. Uh, they
don't know that this is a
possibility. This is something
their taxpayer dollars have gone
to in a program that they can
utilize when they need it, and
they can apply, uh, so for that
reason alone, I, I very much
hope that you all consider
voting in favor of this. Thank
you.
Thank you, Senator. And is that
all?
Yes, that's all. Thank you.
OK, thank you. Is there anyone
in the audience who is in
support of House Bill 77.
Would you like to come forward
and make a statement?
No.
No, OK.
Anyone in opposition?
We'll go to Zoom, and I do have
one person in favor for House
Bill 77, and that's Judith
Nessel.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. I'm
Judy Mesel speaking on behalf of
Lutheran advocacy Ministry in
New Mexico and the New Mexico
Conference of Churches. We
strongly support House Bill 77,
um, we think of that it ensures
that eligible senior citizens
and others who experience food
insecurity can access an
important source of food. We
especially appreciate the
leveraging and barrier removal
aspects.
of the bill. Thank you very
much.
Thank you. And there was no one
in opposition. OK.
With that, we'll go to questions
or comments from committee
members.
Senator Lopez, I'm a Du past.
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Sen Lopez with the
2nd Senator Hickey.
Senator Block with a question.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you, Senator, and, um,
Good to see you, Jason. I catch
her.
What?
A
Thank you. Um,
chat real quick about this. So I
mean it looks like it flew right
by the house. She made the
support, I just got a, a couple
of quick questions here.
With the authority will develop
this, when they developed this
um
Federal snap.
Outreach plan
Um
What, what happens because you
guys talked about a timeline
here.
That you have a uh
A deadline here. What's, what's
the deadline to submit that
every year?
Is it yearly or every 2 years?
Madam Tera and Senator, that's
going to be annually, so it's
every year. Um, it's whatever
the, whenever the USDA has their
application out. Um, I believe
that it's in August, um, so it's
in August of every year.
Madam Chair and Sinead, did we
do that last August? Did we
submit one or not?
You did.
Madam Chair, Senator, yes.
OK, Madam Chair and Shamay, what
did, what did we get for it
exactly, um.
We got grants, we got uh
Literally food. What, what did
we get for?
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator.
Uh, so we submitted, um, we, we
did this for federal fiscal year
24 and then for federal fiscal
year 25.
Um, the first year it was Road
Runner Foodbank, the 2nd year
Road Runner Food Bank and Echo
Food Bank, uh, in the
application we submitted our
budget for Snap Outreach so that
we could draw down a 60% match
on that.
So reimbursement funds is what
we're talking about.
OK, so, Madam Chair and Jason,
we're getting money.
Back from the feds are matching
type of funds, right? That's
correct. OK. So, Madam Cha
Jason, what do you, let's just
talk about Roadrunner, uh, by
the way, incredible facility
there in Albuquerque. Thanks for
giving me a tour there.
Uh, so what do you do with the
money?
Uh, madam, Madam Chair, Senator,
uh, that money goes to reimburse
the money we've already spent on
our Snap Outreach program.
So, uh, the matching funds, our,
our budget was somewhere around
120,000. So we were able to take
that 60,000 and um
Yeah, reimburse ourselves for
that, uh, that allows us to
budget better, knowing we're
gonna get this. So we were able
to expand our outreach, as I
mentioned, a regular VA visits,
um, expanding our outreach and
the field operations at chapter
houses around the state and uh
really helps us to, to grow our
program.
OK, so, Madam Chair, Jason, when
you mean outreach,
What exactly do you mean?
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator,
outreach, uh, yeah, uh, kind of
a big loose term, but
essentially, um, it's, it's uh
Road Runner Foodbank able to
reach out into the community
whether that is through um um
social media campaigns to let
people know that you can call
our help center and we can help
you apply for SNAP over the
phone or having individuals go
out in the field to some of our
mobile food pantry operations
hand out information, uh, talk
with folks about Snaps, um.
Do some eligibility guideline,
let them know if they might
qualify or not, that way we're
not wasting the, the person's
time and then the state's time
processing application that
might not qualify.
Madam Jason, um, you would work
with places like Storehouse West
or Saint Felix Pantry.
Is that fair to say? Uh, Madam
Chair, Senator, uh, Storehouse
West and in the past we have
worked with Saint Felix Pantry.
OK, OK. So, Madam Chair, uh,
Jason Howe.
Um, is this something?
I mean, I, I'm, I'm gonna
support this, but I just want to
understand this. Is this?
Just a, a thing that we're gonna
do every single year.
Uh, correct, uh, uh, madam
chair, senator, yeah, that is
the plan we've been doing it for
years past as well. We've only
done it for the last 2 federal
fiscal years, sir.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, we've
only, uh, the state has only
submitted this plan to
healthcare authority for the
last 2 federal fiscal years.
We're in the middle of federal
fiscal year 25.
And um, Madam Cha says in Jason,
it says here the authority may
partner with one or more
counties and municipalities or
tribal governments.
Non nonprofit or well, well,
what, what are you doing in, how
do you partner with like
The county governments with
Sandoval and Bernal Leo or the
town of
The city of Rio Rancho or
Albuquerque.
You, you have outreach with them
that what tell me what type of
outreach you've done with those
four, Albuquerque Riar Rancho
Bern Cove in Sandoval.
Well, uh, Madam Chair, Senator,
the great thing about this is
that allows us the opportunity
to actually expand our
operations. So, you know, we can
start getting out more in those
communities and we can have the
personnel that can go and do
that. Um, as far as specific
county governments, uh, we've
not really worked other than
doing accounting resource fair
here and there. Uh, we haven't
worked like in a formal
relationship with the county
government to do Snap Outreach,
uh, but that's it's certainly a
possibility and um again,
reimbursement money already
spent on uh various social media
campaigns, Google ads, uh,
publications that we've printed
that are handed out at
distributions and made available
to our network of food pantries
such as the ones in Sandoval
County.
And, and Madam Chair, Jason, how
do we know that we're, we're
actually doing the outreach are
we, do you guys get numbers back
and how many people have
Uh, applied for the benefits.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator,
absolutely, we keep uh detailed
information about uh where the
outreaches are done, um, and
also don't forget, we, we do
have a call center that we're
helping people over the phone,
so we're, we're able to track,
uh, what county the individuals
live in and report back on a lot
of the demographics were, was
the household uh non-identifying
demographics, I should say, uh,
was the household we assisted,
uh, experiencing homelessness to
the household can uh include a
veteran, uh, is a Spanish
speaking house.
So, uh, those kind of
information, so there's a quite
a few data points that we have
to report with the state and
this is something that
Roadrunner actually developed,
uh, working with the healthcare
authority.
OK. So lastly, I, I don't, I
don't think you're capturing
everybody.
I don't, and I don't think you
even know your some people that
you are, you know what I mean,
because they can go online.
And apply for these benefits and
Jason, you don't have a damn
clue.
If they're, you know,
You're, you're not getting
credit for a lot of these people
is what I'm telling you.
Because they can go online and
apply, but you don't really
know.
Really how many people you're
doing outreach on that are
getting the benefits. Is that,
is that fair to say, uh, Madam
Chair, Senator, um,
Uh, it, yes, uh, just like any
form of, of outreach or even
advertising for that matter,
you, you don't always know the,
the extent you, uh, you, you may
not know the fruits of your
labor, as it were, um, and
honestly, the best situation is
if we can provide information,
uh, to a person and that person
is able to seek out the
assistance on their own and uh
and apply on their own and and
be able to do that. That's,
that's a wonderful thing when it
happens, uh, so yeah, to answer
your question, we
We don't always know when
someone takes one of our Snap
application cards, uh, if
they're gonna apply on their
own, I've many a time I've been
in the middle of trying to help
someone set up an application,
and they told me, well, can I
just do this on my own, in which
case, uh, our team is gonna
reply what I said, uh,
absolutely, here's the
information you need, uh, you
know, uh, but, you know, we do
know last year that we did help,
uh, 371 separate households, so
reasonable to assume that most
of these people might not have
applied on their own, uh,
without our help, but yeah, the
The whole purpose of the
outreach isn't just so that Road
Runner Food bank or
community-based organization can
have that privilege of helping
someone the idea is really to
get word out there about the
program and encourage people to
to look into it on their own as
well.
And Madam.
Senator
Um, I will also add that.
He's the outreach is also for
help with complete applications,
right? So Road Runner, for
example, or any.
That would be able to get a a
snap outreach plan, um, would
help these individuals complete
a full application to submit to
HCA so that way when it does get
to HCA and they go through it,
they're not having to call this
family back and say, hey, you're
missing, um, this type of
document we need it to be sent
in. Roadrunner automatically
gets all of that information and
helps send it in right away. So
it, it also reduces the,
yeah, it reduces the, the
um
HCA backlog as well.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair, and um,
Uh, you know, bottom line is
this is federal dollars coming.
You know, that's, which is nice,
um.
We depend a lot on federal
dollars.
Mexico
And um
I just want to say thanks.
Senator Bergman's for uh running
down here to, to take care of
this and sit there with our
experts and are you with uh Road
Road Runner Food Bank as well or
senator, I'm with New Mexico
Center on Law and Poverty.
But
I'm with New Mexico Center on
Law and Poverty
you talk to the food bank guy,
so.
Um, well, thank you for what you
do, uh, Jason.
Great organization. I thank you
for everything that uh you've
educated me on the Roadrunner
and the tentacles that they have
across the state, including
Like you said in my district as
well, so, um.
Appreciate you walking me
through this to get me educated
once again, my friend.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Pinto.
Thank you Madam Chair.
Thank you for the bill, um.
So it's Roadrunner food bank,
the only entity.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh, senator,
um, the first year we were, the
2nd year that's expanded to us
in Eco Food Bank.
And uh the next year, so let me
clarify to this, the, the
healthcare authority has been
submitting these plans, so the
bill would just make it a
requirement so that we can
continue this great work, uh, so
the second year was uh Echo Food
Bank joined us in our effort and
uh set up to receive the
matching funds, uh, and I was
just in a meeting the other day
with the healthcare authority
with some other community-based
organizations such as the Food
Depot and help New Mexico that
are looking into this option.
So you are not, um, Madam Chair,
you are not the only entity.
That is Mountain Sheriff Center,
that's correct.
And who is the largest.
Uh, runners, Madam Chair,
Senator Rubb runner Food Bank,
uh, would be the largest in the
sense of the the most investment
in Snap Outreach and and doing
it the longest, but
Uh, you know, that's what's
great about this legislation is
that it gives smaller
organizations, uh, that ability
as well.
So Madame Chass.
So this plant can only come from
a state agency.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, that,
that is correct. Uh, the
healthcare authority is the
state administer for SNAP, um,
so yeah, it would, it would have
to be, it'd have to come from
the healthcare authority to um
to the uh the USDA.
To let him Chas.
Like the state agency.
But yet you're the largest.
But you're not gonna do anything
with the.
Even though you already do
outreach.
Madam Chair, Senator, um, you
know, any, as my, my colleague
is a social worker and there are
many social workers that have
helped out clients to fill out
applications, uh, probably a lot
of church groups, a lot of
grandchildren doing it for their
grandparents, helping them
apply. There's really no rules
or regulation on helping someone
apply for, for Snap or filling
out the application.
Uh, so a lot of organizations
have done it to some degree and
even Road Runner Food Bank, uh,
you know, we've been doing it
since 2013, uh, without any sort
of matching funds from USDA, uh,
but, um, there is this
opportunity to tap into those,
uh those dollars and again, a
lot of other states have been
doing it for a long time.
To sponsors ultimately the
client benefits.
But yet your organization being
the largest seems it would be.
benefitted from us doing it, but
that's why I want to verify if I
don't this plan can only come
from a state agency, but yet
you're doing the outreach, which
seems like in if outreach is
doing this.
All over in other places to
actually submit a plan would
require to bring all these
agencies into one area, which
seems like that's a missing
puzzle piece in some sense.
If they're only asking for one
FTE and HDA.
Madam Chair, Senator, if I could
just clarify a little bit, the,
the bill is only asking HCA to
Submit this type of plan
annually to the federal
government.
And then the federal government
should provide these types of
grants.
And additional money to help.
Anyone in the state who wants to
utilize that.
To reach out to individuals to
help them apply for federal
SNAP.
Federal and state SNAP benefits.
So really the bill is about
making sure HCA applies for this
money federally, and then
Whoever wants to use that
service with HCA. All they're
doing with the money is then
helping individuals across the
entire state apply for SNAP.
Benefits.
That's all it is.
Madam Charing
or a comment that some of these
nonprofits get so big that uh
Seems like most of them.
Really swallow most of the
administrative costs before it
actually
Comes the larger part of the
benefit of those that they need
to serve.
just crushing on that part.
But I'm starting to see some.
especially after COVID, all
these
coming in, swooping in and
scooping up all the money and
then scoop out. Thank you, Madam
Jack.
Thank you. Any other questions?
see none of you would call the
roll, please.
Center Buck.
I
And her moon
Senator Charlie.
And our
And our nova, yes. Pinto.
Senator Scott
Senator Serio Lopez.
And Hickey, yes.
And her love is
Yeah.
I vote of 9 to 0, you have a due
pass recommendation. Thank you,
Madam Chair members.
Thank you.
Senator Stephanics.
I know you were here on behalf
of Representative Ferrari.
And Representative Terasas.
House Bill 117.
Death certificate by physician
assistant.
If you would join us so please.
House Bill 117.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. This
is a bipartisan bill, uh,
Representative Joanne Ferrari
and Representative Luis
Terrassas and others, and um
this is being brought
By recommendation of both the
Department of Health and the
Office of the Medical
Investigator, and there is an
amendment to put on, if you'd
like me to explain the bill or
to do the amendment.
I need to see that.
I'm sorry, even a microphone.
Why don't you first explain the
bill and then we'll go to the
amendment. Thank you, uh, Madam
Chair.
Right now, um,
Physicians and nurse
practitioners.
Can uh declare death.
And physician's assistants, it's
always a question, uh, a few
years ago, we passed a bill. In
fact, I was a sponsor that
allowed physician assistants and
nurse practitioners to
Uh, declared death in nursing
homes, but this is a different
matter. This would open it up
for a physician's assistants,
who was attending to a person
to uh declared death.
So that's the body would not
have to be referred to the
office of the Medical
Investigator.
There are some conditions, of
course. Um, there are, if the
primary care um provider has
seen the individual.
Made a prescription for a
certain condition or diagnose
the person with a certain
condition, and the PA, the
physician's assistant could
determine that that's what the
person died from, and they would
be able to to pronounce death.
And there's been a
A mix up with amendments, and
they thought that the amendment
that I would providing today was
actually put on on the house
floor and it did not get put on
on the house floor.
So it strikes, uh, it identifies
first the bill started with uh
within 10 days of death.
Then it went to 180 days, and
now it's saying not after death,
sorry, 10 days.
Uh, 180 days and now the
amendment says 365 days.
And this is the purpose of the
days. So if Doctor Hickey
Where Senator Doctor Hickey were
to say that uh this person had
this particular illness.
Or made a prescription.
That
Originally, the bill said within
10 days of death.
That person, the sician
assistant could um
Use that diagnosis, but this is
saying that after 365 days of
seeing Doctor Hickey that
physician's assistant could
still pronounce death.
So it's saying that within the
year,
Of being diagnosed, having a
prescription, having um seen a
primary care physician with
notes to this effect that that
could occur.
So the amendment before you
strikes only.
One item of the house, Health
and Human Services Committee,
Amendment 2.
And then on page 4, it strikes
10.
for days and puts in 3065 days.
So that's the bill and the
amendment, and I'd be happy to
have somebody move the amendment
and then see the Office of
Medical Investigator offered to
be here today to show their
support, and I indicated that if
we really have problems with
this bill.
We'd roll it over and have them
zoom tomorrow, but of course you
know that they're overburdened.
They don't have enough.
How am I investigators, so
Um
If we needed to have them, we
could roll this.
But I, I'm happy to answer
questions.
Well, thank you, Senator. You
kind of did 2 for 1, so thank
you. Um,
What I will do is I will move um
amendment number 12, and this is
the number 23133.
3.1. Yes. So I will move it a
second from Senator Hickey.
You've already explained the
amendment.
So, which I said 2 for 1, so it,
it was OK.
Um, is, are there any questions
on the amendment?
Senator Scott on the amendment.
Oh, thank you.
So, Madam Cha center, this would
say that if the
Deceased has seen a physician.
Within a year
Yes, uh,
Madame Chair and senator on page
4.
It's the section starts at F
line 22.
When death occurs without
medical attendance as set forth
in the earlier section.
Or when death occurs more than
365 days after the decedent was
last provided a medical exam,
medical advice, or prescription
by a primary care physician,
physician's assistant or nurse
practitioner.
So it's saying more than.
365 days. So if I saw a
physician.
January 1
And I had a diagnosis.
That for a full year, somebody
could pronounce death for that
condition.
If it went longer than a year,
then the case would have to be
referred to the Office of
Medical Investigator.
The both the Department of
Health and the OMI has indicated
that this would assist with the
backlog of cases.
And in fact,
Well
I could add more commentary but
You should stop.
So Madame Cha and Senator, the
condition.
has to have been diagnosed with
a year.
And it has to be the same
condition.
And the condition have to be
terminal.
Uh, no, Madam Chair, um, it does
this bill does not say it has to
be terminal terminal. It says,
after this scene was last
provided a medical exam and
medical advice, or prescription.
So that it would give
information to the physician's
assistant that this person might
have a specific condition.
So, for example, people who have
cancer, Madam Chair, Senator,
not necessarily die.
But if there's um prescriptions
within the year that's been for
from an oncologist or been um.
Uh, the cancer drugs,
pharmaceuticals, then you, the
physician's assistant might
know.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Any other questions?
editor
OK.
Go to Duke House.
Senator Hickey with the 2nd from
Senator Silvio Lopez on the
amendment is just.
This is just on the amendment.
Is there any opposition to the
amendment?
no
House Bill 117 is now amended.
And so with that, we'll go uh to
public comment and then to
questions from the committee.
Is there anyone in the audience
in support of House Bill 117.
Anyone in opposition.
Is there anyone online?
In favor of opposition?
No, OK. No one online for house
Bill 177. So with that, we'll go
to questions or comments from
committee.
Senator, on the bill as amended,
he senator Pinto.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator for the bill.
So
the death certificate and this
was one of an issue because
The presiding officer.
Um
came in really didn't do an
investigation, but the position
assistant would not really be
authorized.
to sign
Ah
Right, in this case with this
bill.
Madam Chair, senator, in this
case, the physician's assistant
could sign the death certificate
because uh first of all, the
Office of Medical Investigator,
Senator, can take hours to come
to anybody's.
At home or facility. And so the
idea is that people who, medical
professionals who are around an
individual would know what's
going on with that individual
and so nurse practitioners are
already allowed to sign the
death certificates as well as a
physicians, but physicians'
assistants have the same uh
authority under law. We just
haven't given him this, this
particular authority to sign the
death certificate.
Madam Chair and senator.
The issue with this particular
one was that it was an
unintended death.
The presiding officer didn't
assume there was any criminal
activity, although there were
signs.
Over step didn't send the body
to OMI.
sent it right to the mortuary,
but the cause of death, um,
was questioned
But yeah, that overstepping, and
I don't know if it was because
they didn't want to mess with
all of my.
But I think the family was very
concerned about what the real
cause of death was because
The
The person was not um
There was some questions about
how that person got that area.
In which there was no one in
attendance.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator. So this bill
specifically says
That the physician's assistant
can only be involved in the
pronouncement and signing the
death certificate within the
year of the primary care
physician or, you know, having
diagnosed.
Seeing the person given them in
uh an exam advices or
prescription. So,
I do understand what you're
bringing up about, um,
Possible criminal activity, but
there has to be this
circumstance.
Where the medical
The scene has been, you know,
painted. Thank you, madam chair.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Senator block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator.
Um
Just real quick.
Will this help
Speed up
Getting a death certificate
signed so the family can start
going through the process of
Claims life insurance claims
and, and all that stuff.
Uh, Madam chair Senator,
exactly, and uh I was gonna say
earlier to Senator Scott, while
I was sitting here waiting, I
just got an email to sign on to
a letter to Congress that many
veterans.
are having to wait 4 weeks or
longer for their families to get
their death certificates, and
it's really causing a lot of
consternation in the uh FIR
analysis, it indicates
From the um
Department of Health, which has
the vital statistics that this
would in fact speed up the death
certificates for the families.
Perfect. Thank you. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you. Any other questions,
Senator Gallegos?
And turned center, I'm just
trying to
Its assuming and things, so if,
let's say they get a cancer
diagnosis within that year.
Whatever the cause of the death.
The cancer would be what is
qualified as cause of death. Now
what I understand, Ma'amerson.
I, Madam Chair senator, I do not
believe.
That this bill goes.
That far.
A turn center.
I thought that you were saying
that it had been in that
calendar year.
That diagnosis had been given,
and it would be.
Um, signed off as
Cause of death.
Madam chair, since I'm not the
original sponsor, I'm just
following.
The um
Comments from the Department of
Health, the OMI and the
healthcare Authority.
It's
It improves timeliness.
Miss Man chair Senator, I will
need to get that clarified for
you.
I, it, I don't think the bill
speaks to the cause of death. It
just indicates about signing the
death certificate.
Madam chair and Senator.
Um
And
The doctor that
announce my mom did.
OK
That is cancer.
So I think at that time.
Or whoever's doing it would use.
Some kind of knowledge base to
be able to do that, but it might
be a question to be ready for on
the floor.
Uh just because
I think it's relevant if the doc
knows.
And
The position system.
may know if, if something else
occurred, but uh I just want to
bring that up.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Any other questions?
There's a motion for a due pass
from Senator Hickey with the 2nd
from Senator Pinto.
And if you could call the roll,
please.
And I.
And our bone, and our Charlie.
Gallegos.
And they're not, yes, and I pin
off.
Senator Scott
Center city of Lopez.
Yes.
And Hickey and Lopez, yes.
There's a Duke has
recommendation.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
I a vote of 9 to 0.
So thank you.
Very well done, son.
Thank you.
Um, representative.
you correctly pronounce your
last name?
All of us.
Please.
OK.
I have to ask.
Just to make sure, cause
sometimes I kind of
Mess up people's last name.
No problem, madam chair. It, it
is a difficult one, but yes, it
is representative Ana Nonu.
And I am here, uh, which bill
would you like to start with,
Madam Chair? Let's see, you are
listed as do House Bill 453. OK.
Housing creditworthiness
assistance program. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry?
Did we not have to have a
senator in the room.
For the bill
I
thought.
One of the bills I was trying to
fulfill.
Because Ramos wasn't here.
He asked me to sit out there.
Just wondering.
Without the same manager, I
guess I'm.
OK, so just clarify the question
on House Bill 453 is?
The chair andin almost had a
billiard.
And he was not here. Yes, I had
to go sit in.
I'm just asking a representative
does not have a senator.
So Salava was saying, I'm just
trying to keep things even. I
thought I had to fill in
the scripts and I'm sorry
the picture she's not a senator.
same situation
Same
reason why is because it was a
Senate bill.
And Senator Ramos was not here.
So you graciously sat in to
present the bill, which was a
Senate bill.
And then we had Representative
Doll who was presenting the bill
in front of our committee.
And
Proper procedure is that we have
the senator presenting a Senate
bill.
Is correct. Yeah, this is a
house bill, so the
representative will present her
bill here in the committee,
which is, which is proper. It's
OK.
Thank you very much.
So we're good.
And
Right, so it's just, it's just,
it, it's.
The decorum that we try and
keep, so we have a senator
presenting a Senate bill.
And a representative
And in the other chamber
presenting house bill.
They both consider there if they
wish, but we look at the
House member or the Senate
member to I guess since my bills
never make it out of maybe I
don't know.
It's just what happens sometimes
we, you know, as we keep going
back and forth.
OK, Representative.
Thank you, ma'am Chair, and
thank you committee members. So
yes, I'm here presenting House
Bill 453, which creates an MFA
managed program through which
property managers can feel
secure renting to applicants who
in all parameters qualify for a
rental except for a less than
desirable credit rating. The
program also includes a
financial literacy piece for
qualifying applicants on the
importance of budgeting and the
operation of um credit histories
and credit scores.
So essentially what the bill
does,
is when a property manager or a
landlord is taking applications
if they find a renter who they
like, who has a good job, they
qualify for the apartment except
for that issue of having a less
than great credit score, they
can still rent to that person,
the tenant will then attend the
financial literacy course along.
Like through the course of their
rental, and then at that point,
if that tenant should still then
after completing the course,
default on the lease within that
first year, the fund that we're
creating, which is in the House
Bill 2, will fulfill the
remainder of the lease. So
before we continue, I just think
it's important to highlight some
of the things that this bill
does not do. This bill is not
rental assistance or eviction
prevention at all. If the tenant
is unable to make their
payments, the
property manager landlord will
still follow their usual
procedures or eviction or
whatever process to be they that
they do for a regular tenant.
This bill also does not mandate
any participation by the
property manager, it is entirely
optional, and this bill does not
require any changes to how a
property manager selects their
tenants. There's no mandate or
requirement that the property
manager or landlord must rent to
a particular tenant, and with
that, madam chair, I stand for
questions.
Thank you, Representative.
go to the audience. Is there
anyone here in support?
Uh house Bill 453.
Um, looks like there's 5 of you,
345. If you'd like to stand,
please, you're more than
welcome.
To stand, um, introduce yourself
in a two-minute statement,
please.
It should be fine if they if
all.
OK.
If there's 3, there's 3.
Up to you.
But no matter
Thank you, Madam Chair, Daniel
Orant, the Governor's Office of
Housing, uh, speaking in favor
of this legislation, uh, rents
have gone up.
Maybe as much as 60% since 2017
so the obstacles for lower
income people to renting become
harder than ever. You can't have
an affordable rental, you can
never become a homeowner. So
this is an important step in the
spectrum of housing assistance.
Thank you.
Uh, Madam Chair, Randy training
with a partner association, uh,
with the sponsor asked me to
support her bill. I, I actually
questioned her on that because
I, I thought if she really
wanted her bill passed, that
maybe I should oppose it. But um
in all seriousness, I want to
thank the sponsor for taking the
time to talk to us.
About what she was trying to do
with this bill. That doesn't
happen a whole lot for us
lately. So we support the bill.
Thank you very much.
Um, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Roger Bede is with
the Center for Housing
Economics. This is a very
important bill. It takes the um
idea that rental housing or
operating rental housing is a
risky.
Operation, it takes that risk
seriously and offsets that with
um a program that will, um, back
up, um people who are in the
rental housing business trying
to rent housing, but it also
invests in people that are
working hard and uh who are who
just have like a black mark on
their credit.
But who need a place to go, and
if they couldn't get an
apartment, they might be
sleeping on a couch or in a car,
so it's, it's a really important
step, and we hope that um it
will get everyone's support.
Oh, good afternoon. Uh, my name
is Charlton Simmons. I'm with
pay for New Mexico, as well as
New Mexico Black Leadership
Council and the reason why I
think this bill should be
supported is because it looks at
both sides. It's good for the
client who's working hard and
trying to secure stable housing
and just, you know, um, has one
additional barrier up in front
of them. There's also good for
the landlord slash property
management because it gives them
that reassurance that they need
to conduct.
good business, and so this bill
um assists in the, you know, the
nation's current housing crisis,
and um it's a good thing for
both sides involved.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
the room in opposition?
No, I do have a list.
those on Zoom.
Uh, we'll start with Anne Lim.
Good evening, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Anne Lyn Hall, and I am the CEO
of Prosperity Works. I'm here
today to ask your support of HB
453. New Mexico is facing a
housing crisis. We have many New
Mexicans that are unhoused or
precariously housed. This bill
is an important step that
supports households who have
funds to pay for housing, but
have lower credit scores. This
program will give landlords the
ability to say yes to potential
tenants, knowing that if they
are
able to pay their rent, that the
housing creditworthiness
assistance program would be able
to help. As a state, we need
multiple solutions to the
housing crisis. This is one
piece of the puzzle to
affordable housing for New
Mexicans. I urge your support of
this bill and thank the sponsor
for all of her work on this
bill. Thank you.
Thank you. Next, we have Kurt
Roger.
Good evening, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. This
is Kurt Reeger, the director of
Lutheran Advocacy Ministry of
New Mexico and Lutheran advocacy
also speaks the position of the
Mexico conference of churches,
and I'm here to express our
support for HP 453 to keep your
schedule moving along, I'll
simply concur with the reasoning
and comments of the bill's
sponsors and previous proponents
and urge you to support this
bill. Thanks for the opportunity
to speak to you tonight.
Thank you. Next we have Anita
Cordova.
Hello?
We can hear you. Oh, great.
Thank you. Yes, this is Anita
Cordova. I am the immediate past
president of the Albuquerque
Affordable Housing Coalition for
well over a decade. I have seen
firsthand how our housing crisis
is hurting everyone in New
Mexico. I urge you to support
this House bill today and this
evening to make sure that
people, that New Mexicans get
the housing that they require
and need and that people who are
providing housing have the
support that they require and
need.
Thank you for all the time and
our sponsor and all of our
supporters who have worked to
make this possible, please
support this bill this evening.
Thank you for all you do in our
uh our poli political world.
Thank you.
Thank you. And no one in
opposition.
OK. So with that, we'll go to
questions from committee.
Senator Pinter.
Madam Chair I think to
representatives.
Um, do you know the demographics
of these.
But do, do we have any data as
far as the demographics of those
that are not being able to uh
I guess
The creditworthiness.
Population.
Thank you, ma'am Chair and thank
you, Senator Pinto. Um, I don't
have the exact numbers in front
of me that I have had
conversations with um the
professors from UNM Law who have
like a little housing coalition
at the school, um, and they tell
me that this will mostly benefit
and impact single mothers, um,
unfortunately, what we see is um
When people get married really
young or get into a relationship
really young, and their late
teens, twenties, yeah, um, their
credit can be impacted,
especially if they're in an
abusive relationship and the
credit unfortunately still goes
with the woman, um, and now
she's like in her late twenties,
early 30s and has one or
multiple children and is
struggling to find a rental that
we'll rent to her because of
that credit score that she
incurred when she was much
younger.
of representative.
The reason I asked about the
demographics is because of
What I experienced in college.
And even those that uh went to
school with.
Single mothers.
Madam Chair and representatives.
And in some instances, there is
some housing set aside for
mothers and their children as
there are restrictions at the
dorm level.
Up to who can be in there.
And even with the scholarships
that we provide some of our
young adults still want to be
independent and live on the
campus.
And
that creates a lot of um
Like
I it's a lot of risk in that
sense, especially when these uh
You know, uh, I don't know if
they're.
It's
I don't know for higher ed
institutions really
And
I think they should be able to
weigh in on this, but I don't
know if we have anything
existing currently.
At the college level for them to
access any kind of assistance,
do you know?
chair at Senator Pento,
unfortunately, no, I don't, I
don't know that offhand.
Uh, so, Madam Chair and um,
Representative
It's one of the other things,
and I, I, I just remember what I
haven't been on campus for a
while, but there was a lot of
credit companies that were
there.
Um, asking students to fill
this, fill that out, fill this
out. I mean you could get like
10 credit cards, um, on campus,
you wished.
For a t-shirt.
But, uh, I think some of our
students.
Might still not be in that realm
of how this can, this can affect
their credit.
Um rating, especially when they
have such an exorbitant amount
of student loan debt if.
or not.
You know, factoring that in.
Um
I don't know if there can be a
way to massage this bill to kind
of direct some of that in there
or kind of maybe include
highered in that sense because
that population, we know they're
going to school. We know that
there's something that they, you
know, they want higher
education, but that factor of um
Being housed and being away from
home, so.
seems to
a little bit more risk when they
find it to be a good idea to
move off campus and.
be nice to get an apartment with
all your friends.
But usually only one person is
probably impacted in that sense.
Um, especially if things don't.
Things go awry.
So I
I commend you.
Your bill as far as the rental
agreement, and hopefully, I
don't know that this program
will help them to move on to
actually owning a home.
In that sense, because of
financial.
Adviser is very crucial as you
move forward.
Thank you for the bill.
Thank you, Senator, Senator
Nova.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative for bringing
the bill forward. Um,
Fortunately, I know that many of
us are very familiar with the
vast issues in the housing.
space here in the nationally,
but specifically um on this
bill.
I see a one-time appropriation,
is that correct?
Chasen or not, yes, that's
correct.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, thank you, Representative.
Um, so on that note, I see
250,000 going from the general
fund to DFA to contract with
MFA. What is the long-term goal
for sustainability in terms of
actually supporting this program
and its development moving
forward.
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you,
Senator Nava. Yeah, so the
Um, if you look at the FIR, it
actually scored it as recurring,
but that's not the intent of the
legislation. Um, we believe the
appropriation of the $250,000
will be sufficient for several
years, the whole intent of the
fund is that we don't have to
spend the fund because this will
be going toward applicants who
qualify in terms of income, um,
and to, uh, Senator Pinto's
point, we do have other.
Programs very much like this in
place for landlords and um and
property managers to rent to
people. However, those other
existing programs usually come
with an income cap, and this
program is very specific in
that. Usually the um people who
will benefit most from this
program, make too much money to
qualify for the other programs.
It's just that credit, um,
that's the issue. So we have
this kind of growing population
of New Mexicans who
are gainfully employed who make
enough money, but they still
struggle to find rentals because
of their credit score.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you representative, um, and how
is the program going to be
assessed long term?
So that program will be assessed
through MFA um they will be in
control of how many participants
they are willing to take on at a
time, see how much money they
end up spending over a period of
course of time, and then whether
or not to make additional
one-time funding in future.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative, and are
there any other states that have
implemented such a program.
chair under another guest, um,
Oregon and Washington both have
similar programs that we've kind
of modeled this program after
we've tailored it to be more New
Mexico specific, um, those other
states have much higher
appropriations and much more
initial capital invested, um,
but we don't think that we will
require that much money to keep
the fund solvent here in New
Mexico.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative.
Thank you. Other questions?
I just have one comment, and I'd
like to say I think this is
A great addition to the mix that
we really need to help our
communities.
There was a bill that passed out
of here called rent control, but
it wasn't really about just
allowing local government to
make up their own mind.
But it's part of the mix.
And if you, even if you don't
have credit.
Period
Um, it's even hard for a young
person to even go to.
Long story short, I helped my
son.
OMG, his eyes opened.
Greatly about what you need just
invented.
Mine too. I, I have a home.
But it, I think this is a good
part of the mix that we need.
Help families.
So with that, um,
Oh, yes, sorry.
I can answer you. Go ahead.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
This is providing.
Right.
Come on
it's a page 2, section D.
It may be used by a participant
for all or portion.
Of unpaid grant.
And damages.
Caused to a rented residential
how does this?
I can see how both unpaid rent
and somebody.
And somebody calls them damage
to the property would affect the
credit score, but
would somebody.
Then
be qualified to apply for one of
these grants.
in term representative.
Man chair Senator Scott, I'm,
I'm sorry, could you repeat or
restate that question? I'm not,
I'm not entirely sure what
you're asking.
OK.
The creditworthiness assistance
grant. I'm looking in the
definition.
is a grant to be used by a
participant.
that will pay all or portion of
unpaid rent and then farther
down the vale it looks like it
could be up to $10,000.
Or 2
Damages.
To a wretched residential
property by a participant.
In the creditworthiness
assistance program, so
I mean the very obvious question
is why would we be paying people
that are
Tearing up somebody's property.
Madam Chair, Senator Scott, I, I
think I get what you're asking
now. So the money does not go to
the tenant, the money would go
to the property manager or
landlord that owns the
apartment.
OK. Um, madam chair and
representative so.
OK. Tell me why again we're
doing that while we're
subsidizing.
Somebody to tear up.
of rental
Well, Madam Chair
Representative, we are not
paying them to tear up the
apartment. It's um really a
program so that if the landlord
property manager is willing to
incur a little bit of risk to
rent to someone that they might
feel uncomfortable running to
because simply of their credit
score, no other factor. We're
not requiring that they rent to
people that they don't want to,
just the credit score is the
only hindrance there. If that
tenant then.
defaults on that lease. We are
covering the remainder of the
lease.
Yeah.
Madam Chair and Representative
of Red D several times here, and
it doesn't say anything about
credit score.
Can you tell me where.
That consideration would come
into play.
So that consideration is really
the crux of the bill. I can.
Do a quick scan of the bill
about what like where
specifically the
creditworthiness is the is the
issue. I mean, like, we can.
OK, I have another question as
to the difference between a
participant and
Hang on.
It appears as though a grantee.
Can qualify for $5000 for a
participant.
And qualify for $5000.
And then $10,000 of unpaid rent.
To a grantee per year.
So what would be the difference
between
A participant.
Grante and
Grand Chief.
So my understanding is that the
grantee is the property property
owner.
And the participant would be the
participant.
In the
Financial literacy program.
OK, so this could be on multiple
properties.
Yes.
senator.
OK. However, I do want to
Specify that the $10,000 of
unpaid rent is the cap that we
are going to give her grantee,
so
A single landlord can have
multiple properties, and they
can have um several people,
several tenants participating in
the program, however, and this
will be more specifically
managed by MFA. We are going to
cap the $10,000 per property
manager slash landlord.
OK.
Um
But, but that one's, that one's
fine.
Madam Chair and representative,
let's go back to
Let's go back to the
creditworthiness assistance
grant.
Definition now indeed.
And tell me how that
correlates to a credit score.
It correlates to the credit
score in such that when we, when
MFA creates the fund where it
creates the program rather, the
only participants in the fund
will be tenants that have credit
scores that do not meet the
requirements as set out by the
landlord.
OK.
Possibly because of
Adam Chair and Representative
possibly because of
Damages that they've caused to
them.
President property.
Is there a minimum credit score
or maximum?
Madam Chair, Senator, the, I
mean, there are different tiers
of credit scores, but it's
really up to the property
manager and what they already
require for a tenant.
We're not going to outline that.
For this program because we want
to make it entirely voluntary.
So if a property manager says, I
really like this tenant, they
make enough money, but my, like,
they themselves as the business
owner require a credit score of
saying.
7:20 and the tenant does not
meet that requirement.
They can
Then apply this person for that
program.
Yeah.
Oh thank you, Representative,
and thank you.
Thank you. Other questions,
Senator Gallegos?
Thank you.
I, I do have a question earlier
you talked about in the
introduction of financially
financial literacy program.
Is that um
So
my wife runs 2 low income
housing units.
501.
to apartment together.
Um
Is it while they're there on.
Is it after you've rent it to
him?
before, if they have a low
credit score, they come to her.
You have to take your program
first to build a credit score or
is it?
in the process.
Madam Chair Senator Gaos, um, as
an MFA will be managing the
program. I didn't want to lay
out two specific of a rule of
how they manage that program
because I understand that MFA
has several financial literacy
programs, so if they wanted to
include those tenants in a
program that already exists, so
they
with their lease. I didn't want
to lay out too strict of rules
so that they would have to
either create a new program or
that tenants would not be able
to participate in existing
programs. So essentially what
I'm saying is that I leave that
to MFA in their judgment whether
they want to create a separate
literacy program apart from the
ones that they already run.
Thank for that.
In turn representative and then
my question is, um,
If you're the landlord.
They come in with a low credit
score.
How does this program help me?
Because they're already at a low
credit score.
They're trying to build
financial.
You're trying to lift or
The credit score.
But day one when I see them,
that their low score, they're
saying it's just supposed to
give me a warm fuzzy feeling and
you're gonna help them get to a
better place? Is that what I
understand that sir.
Chaos. I'm sorry, who are you in
this scenario?
As I said, the landlord and, and
my new tenant has low credit
score.
Uh, in your program.
are brand new to me.
You're programmed to give me
comfort?
That they would go through your
program and Excel and break
their credit score up.
So that way they'd be a good
tenant, is that?
trying to hear my turn.
OK. Thank, thank you, Madam
Chair, Senator degagos, that's
definitely part of it, um, the
financial literacy program will
help them improve credit scores
and help them with budgeting and
make them a more desirable
person to own a home in the
future, but ultimately, if the
credit score would have
prevented you from renting to
them in the first place. This
will make sure that you are made
whole if they default on their
lease.
Keep in mind this is only for
tenants who can still afford to
rent the apartment, it's just
the credit score that's the
issue.
represented them.
him down the road.
If I figure the system out.
Dad to Scott's house.
And or leave them rent to up to
10,000.
And I go to several block's
house.
And I apply and get in there.
Are you gonna cover my other
$10,000?
Or am I obligated to learn.
From my first mistake.
I make my 2nd mistake.
Because you're painful.
Madam Chair, Senator Gallegos,
this will not prevent anybody
from getting evicted.
This isn't landlord, it's not
rental assistance and it's not
eviction prevention. So if you
damage an apartment and you run
off to another apartment. If you
had to get thrown out of that
first apartment, that will be on
your record. So it is up to a
future landlord if they want to
rent to you at all, so I don't
see this program being a
hindrance in that matter,
because if you um as the tenant
in this instance, if you
perpetuate not paying rent,
which you can afford because
that is.
One of the qualifiers of this
program that you'll be able to
afford that apartment if you are
then not paying rent that you
can't afford and causing
property damage and getting
evicted.
That's going to show up on your
credit or on your report next
time you try to rent an
apartment, Madam chair, senator.
Thanks for that concern.
I think you've clarified and
clarified that it's not.
And, and I like the idea,
it's not a gift to me, the
tenant.
Its repayment to the landlord.
So that way it sort of keeps me
from
Benefiting from all this money
because it's a lot of money.
That, uh
Um
Be used in in in certain
situations, so I just wanted
clarification on that because I
was thinking it was free gifts
that I could start uh
Moving from house to house and.

And committee members, I wanted
to mention Senator Pope is next,
but he'll be coming in.
let him know.
Um, there's two measures that
Uh, I was unable to work on the
consent agenda.
with Senator Scott.
And there are 2 measures I
wanted just to bring up in front
of committee before we go to our
next measure.
Uh, the first one is, um, House
Bill 448.
And as the Office of Housing,
Planning and production.
It's the same mirror bill as
Senate Bill 205, which we passed
out of this committee.
Um, so I wanted to propose that.
It would have been a consent
bill, but I didn't get the list
over in time.
So, that would be a
consideration.
He house Bill 448, Office of
Housing, Planning and
Production.
Is there any, uh, I'd like to
propose that as a
What I say
Consent bill without being on
the consent agenda.
If there would be any
opposition.
If we could have a due pass
motion.
Literature Hickey.
With the do pass and a 2nd from
Senator Nava and if you could
please.

And
Senator Charlie.
Senator Gallego.
And no, yes.
And I pinto.
And
And I said Lopez.
And Hickey, yes.
center block.
Back to me already.
I
Senator Lopez, yes.
So do you pass motion then on
House Bill 448 by a vote of 8 to
0. Thank you.
My other one, which would have
been, but again,
The chair has to get a little
faster next year. I'll, I'll
learn.
Senate Bill 426.
This is repeal obsolete school
provision.
And what this deals with
essentially is the division of
vocational rehabilitation.
It still mentions in that.
Um, particular statute, it
refers to the school for the
visually.
Handicapped, impaired, etc. and
it needs to be removed. It's
just a simple reference in the
statute.
And um
That's all it does.
So, I was going to present this,
of course, and did not, but I'd
like to propose it for
committee.
Senate Bill 426.
Of her consideration as to
consent agenda.
Is there any opposition? It's
simple.
Yeah, it's just sometimes what
we'll do for those who are new,
sometimes we'd clean up statue
when we're, we find something
that's been
Incorrectly referenced or if
it's something that should have
been.
He leaded a few years back and
sometimes that's what we'll do.
So, uh, the chairman entertain a
do pass motion from Senator.
Picking with a 2nd from Senator
Pinto, and if you could call the
roll please.
Center.
And
Senator Charlie.
Senator Gallegos.
No, yes, Senor Pinto.
Senator Scott.
Center city of Lopezen Hickey.
Yes. Senator Lopez.
Yes.
And by a vote of 8 to 0, there's
a due pass on.
Um, send a bill 426. Thank you.
So now we'll go on to Senate
Bill 433, Senator Pope.
Dentist and dental hygienist
contact?
And I know you've been patiently
waiting, so please.
No problem, ma'am, sure. Uh,
Senate Bill 43433 dentist and
dental hygienist compact.
Dentists, dental hydrogenis
compact and disagreement between
New Mexico and other
participating states to
recognize licensed professionals
from the states to practice in
New Mexico. It would also permit
New Mexico dentists and
hygienists to practice in these
other states. It is similar in
some ways to a driver's licenses
which are recognized nationwide,
but require that drivers observe
all laws of the state in which
they are driving and subject to
them.
to the courts in that state. The
dental compact as a requirement
that professionals must apply
for privilege in the state they
intend to practice, which
includes a jurisprudence
examination and allows the state
to know who is using the compact
to practice there. It also
involves a fee to cover the cost
of administering privilege and
participating in the compact.
The commission has been
established to make additional
rules and adjudicate any
disputes. Each participating
state will send one
commissioner. This person would
be selected by our board of
Dental Healthcare and report on
the activities of the
commission.
Participation in the compact
makes in New Mexico license more
valuable by making it usable in
all compact states.
It makes New Mexico a better
place to practice because
there's easier access from so
many other states and gives us
more flexibility in our
workforce.
We'd also be more attractive to
military families and dental
spouses that choose assignments
based on where it is easiest for
spouses to work.
Patients benefit from having a
broader pool of dentists and
hygienists to draw into our
workforce.
Since we do not have a dental
school.
All of our dentists have to go
out of state to be educated. As
a result, they all have to be
attracted back to New Mexico.
As a member of the compact, we
are also more desirable for that
reason.
Young dentists and dental
hygienists want more mobility,
which the compact gives them,
um, just a few contacts before,
uh, I mean, a few, uh, uh points
I'd like to highlight before I
introduce my expert.
Dental
Dental hygienist compact is the
newest of the professional
licensed compacts created by the
Council of State Governments in
2023.
It has benefited from lessons
learned from other compacts.
And the compact maintained state
autonomy over rules and scope of
practice.
With that
Madam Chairwoman, I would like
to introduce my expert.
Mr. Scribelma, who is the
executive director of the New
Mexico Dental Association, and I
like to allow him to introduce
himself and say a few words.
Madam Chairman and members of
the committee, and Tom
Scripsima, uh, as Senator Pope
said, I'm the executive director
of New Mexico Dental Association
and the dentist in Albuquerque.
Um, then I started leaving the
state and an alarming rate. We
don't have a dental school and
the only way we attract them to
our communities, um, you know,
it's through different measures.
We have to, we depend on being
able to attract them this
compact helps us to be a little
more attractive, and that's
really what this is about.
Thank you.
Thank you. Is that all, Senator?
And with that, Madam Chair,
we're ready for uh any public
comment or questions from the
committee.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
the audience in support of
In the field or.
33.
If you'd like to stand and make
a comment, please do.
There's a
Microphile can please introduce
yourself in 2 minutes
for your statement. My name is
Sharon Argenbright, and I
support this bill because you're
gonna follow up with where these
compact people are working or
staying or not staying. Thank
you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, Debbie Trayer
represented.
And hygienists. We'd like to
thank the sponsor for bringing
this measure forward and we do
stand in support. Thank you.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
the room in opposition?
See none, we'll go to Zoom.
We do have first JD Bullington.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. This is JD
Bullington speaking on behalf of
the Greater Albuquerque Chamber
of Commerce and
We're here to support Senate
Bill 433. This bill will allow
licensed dentist professionals
from all all over the states in
the compact to practice in New
Mexico without jumping through
more licensing hoops, and this
will help put a smile on the
Mexicans throughout the state.
We all know we have a severe
shortage of medical
professionals, including Dennis
and the Greater Albuquerque
Chamber of Commerce urges you to
support this bill. Thank you.
Thank you. Next is Roy Soto.
Royal
OK, now, I'm there,
I'm sure there you are, yes. OK,
my name is Roy Soto and I'm a
registered lobbyist for Choice
Healthcare Services. First, we'd
like to thank uh the sponsor,
Sarah Pope, for bringing this
bill forward. We strongly
support SB 433. Choice
Healthcare Services an
organization that provides
dental care to kids, to kids,
um, we have clinics in
underserved areas and in rural
areas. clinics
Demming gallop,
Demming galloplalues to the
South Valley. The goal is to
ensure that every child receives
the essential care that they
need for healthy teeth. Among
the many challenges in providing
this care is that the
competitiveness of recruiting
physician uh dentist to New
Mexico. And then the long
licensing process. That's before
33 will make it possible for New
Mexico to join the dentist and
dental hygienist compact.
And create reciprocity among the
participating states and reduce
the barriers to license
portability. Our surrounding
states, Colorado, Arizona,
Texas, Oklahoma have already
passed or, or have legislation
pending to allow them to join
this compact. Madam Chair,
members of the committee, we
strongly urge that they do, they
do pass for bill 433. It's
essential and we need to have
more dentists in our.
Community. Thank you, Madam
Chair and members of the
committee.
Thank you. Next, we have Jessie
Hunt.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee and says
Senator Pope for bringing this
important legislation forward.
I'm here on behalf of the
Association of General Support
Organizations, and we support
the compact for all the reasons
that Mr. Soto just outlined, um,
those some these compacts will
significantly improve access to
oral health care for residents,
especially in rural areas by
recruiting by creating
reciprocity among participating
states, the compacts reduced
barriers to license portability.
And we think it's important for
that to be able to allow
licensed dental hygienists to
relocate and practice where
they're needed most. So I
encourage you to support this
bill and thank you for
considering it.
Thank you. There was no one in
opposition?
OK.
So with that, we'll go to
questions or comments from
committee members.
Senator Scott.
Uh, thank you, madam chair, uh,
what was your name again sir?
Tom Scrips.
Church mouth
cripsima.
Sorry.
Madam Senator.
Madam Chair, Mr. Scrips up.
The youth
Because your profession suffer.
From the same affliction that
the medical doctors have.
The tort liability in the.
Madame Charro at my expert.
Thank you, Madam Chair, um,
Senator.
Um, we do suffer from the same
thing, um, it, it's a little bit
different because we're not
actually covered by the medical
malpractice Act, so in some ways
it's worse for us.
So Madam Chair, Mr. Prisma you.
Malpractice insurance premiums
would be significantly higher
there.
Those encountered by folks.
In states surrounding.
Um, amateur senator, I couldn't
answer that for sure. I don't, I
don't know exactly what people
are paying in other states, um.
I, I'm not sure that it's always
a matter of the, the level of
the premium as much as it is
being able to get insurance, so
I'm aware of uh particularly
surgeons and others in uh that
are providing general anesthesia
and so on that are having
difficulty getting insurance,
um, and so on. So it's, it's a
little different problem in the
way it's um reacting, but it
still is a problem.
Madam Chair and senator, I'm
probably gonna.
Support this piece of
legislation, but I really don't
think it's gonna bring
Many dentists into the state.
Because
Of, of problems that we
That we just described.
And
Certainly wished that we'd had
an opportunity.
put some of those problems.
At least on the front burner for
iteration.
This legs
Thank you,
thank you.
Thank you, Senator Saia Lopez.
I
Thank you, ma'am, I don't know
if you already said this, but
having this compact will give us
more points when they have those
uh BAC proceedings, what are
they uh base?
Review
Whatever BAC stands for.
What is a base review and
closure?
I, I think Madam Chair, Senator,
I think there's an impact there,
but I think really where this
comes into play in some
situations you might have a
military spouse.
Who comes here and if you don't
have this compact,
They're not able to work here
until they go through that
timeline of getting a license.
So, um, that's, uh, having a
dentist here or dental hygienist
that we could be utilizing in
our state, we're not able to.
The second point of that is when
folks are deciding where they
want to be assigned. The fact
that we do not have a compact.
could impact folks saying, I
don't want to go there because
now my spouse is gonna take this
long for them to work, um, you
know, because the compact isn't
there, so they might choose to
go to a different assignment or
to another state that has a
compact.
Yes, currently Air Force Base is
now in my district after
so I've met with them and one of
the things they pointed out is,
I can't think it's base
realignment.
I think that's what it stands
for. I got it. Um, and they
talked about the points that
this gives you with
When it is, um, you have that.
Um, I really want to help you,
uh,
As this compact.
And I don't know, I'm just gonna
give you suggestions, um.
Not gonna suggest you make them
now, but like before you get to
the judiciary, as you get to the
judiciary, take out the whole
purpose and, and I want to point
out that it says uh on page.
is somewhere that I read, oh
here it is on page 8 in AA
compact that is not materially
different from the model
compact.
And as determined in accordance
with commission rules.
So, that means a lot of people
would come with compacts and say
we can't change a word because
then we won't be admitted. And
that's not true. They're gonna
review it and they're gonna
determine whether it's
materially different.
I don't think that they would
mind if you took out the
purpose.
Which is going to uh
I think that's from page one
through.
Line 13 on page 3.
Because we have a, even though I
don't agree with this, we do
have a judiciary that believes
that purpose clauses that don't
belong in the law.
The reason I disagree is it
helps judges interpret it, but
It's a disagreement, um, and
then the other thing that you
wanna take out.
Is um the provision on
All of the stuff regarding what
the compact commission does, you
can leave all of that.
That's the heart and that's what
they care about with the compact
commission is that you don't
mess with the commission.
So I would leave all of that,
but then when you end
Because
circling it
Public meetings so that.
OK, then it starts saying,
Oh, and the data system, did
NMLRD um
would handle the data system,
Madam Chair.
All at my.
Um, and senator, it would be our
LD I think would be the
administrator for um
applications for the uh
privilege and also granting the
privilege. NMLRD aware of that
and they, are they game?
Um,
Senator, I
I believe that their game um
from I mean from their response
in the FIR I, I think they may
have observed that it would take
some personnel.
Honestly, the number of people
that this is gonna affect um it
it's, it's gonna be small to
begin with. In fact, there,
there's nobody practicing under
this, yeah, this year, this is
the first year when they're
going to start. So by the time
that, by the time it's ramped
up, I think they would be able
to accommodate them. Madam,
that's fantastic. So we will get
in just as Texas, Arizona, and
all the other.
Oh, that's so good. I, that's
wonderful.
So on page 32,
It's rulemaking.
Rulemaking is great. That first
paragraph is fine.
But
Uh, it's inconsistent with New
Mexico law, that the rules of
the commission shall have the
force of law.
In each participating state,
that's just not New Mexico law
it conflicts, um, so I would
just take out that paragraph.
Um, and, and it, it's got this
provided, however, that where
the rules of the commission
conflict.
Then, and then what you really
you realize is it's not saying
anything, so I would take out
that paragraph, and I would be
happy to write a letter to the
commission to explain why that's
if you need, if you need that to
explain why that's not
necessary. And then,
Um
Because rules have the, the
effect of rules and, and
basically they, they apply
unless it's inconsistent with
state law, which is exactly what
that's saying, and that's New
Mexico law. So that's why it's
not necessary. And then, um,
Um
There was something about
And you, OK. Um, I would change
the venue provisions on page 37
because they're gonna make you
change it in judiciary, that if
a New Mexican has a problem with
the compact, then you will be
here.
And if um
If it's an issue that the
Compact has with New Mexico,
then you will be there.
Um, and that's New Mexico law.
It's also general law and again
I'd be happy to write a letter
because this is inconsistent
with
With most states' jurisdictions,
you know, and I've heard, I
don't know about the dental
contact, but I've heard in other
contacts.
Other states have been changing
that. And so my guess is if it's
starting now.
that's an issue for the contact
commissioner to deal with. So,
uh, I'm just telling you, you
won't get out of judiciary
without changing that venue.
Um
And
I didn't see qualified immunity
here.
Um
So that's really great.
Um, I was kind of looking for
qualified immunity because
New Mexico provides better
protection to the commissioner
and qualified immunity because
in New Mexico,
Any uh any appointed official is
immune from suit?
Unless they
you know, unless they, uh,
there's a whole list of things,
which is not within the scope of
their responsibilities, so, so
they actually, and I'm happy to
write this too, they actually
have better protection under New
Mexico law than they would if it
had a qualified immunity.
So those are what I, the things
I saw.
Um
And um if you want, I'd be happy
to, to help with that as you get
to judiciary.
Because I really would like to
see these.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator.
Uh, next we have Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. Thank you, um,
Doctor.
close enough.
Um, Senator, when I was looking
through this, this bill here,
this is the same format that we
had.
When you're here like
A week or so ago regarding
schools, is that correct?
Madam Senator, I, I didn't have
a compact bill or anything that
I, I know Senator Truill had one
with social workers.
Um, Madam chair, Senator, I
Wasn't it related you had a, you
had a school liaison officer.
What, can you remind me what was
that one? Yes, you are.
refreshing my mind, there was.
Clean up, you're right on a
compact or
Military education and so that
one was just
two lines are we change two
words from section to chapters.
OK, all right, so, and, and, and
Madam Chair and senator in that
one, that was a compact that we
had already signed just kind of
updating whereas this one is
we're trying to actually uh
start a new one and sign on to.
OK, copy. Um, Madam Chair,
Senator.
Is this, are these compacts, are
they, is it like a um a format
between states uh to do this and
then if this is passed.
We have to be accepted into the
compact?
Uh, Madam Chair, senator, and
I'll let my expert answer after
to make sure I'm saying the
right thing. From my
understanding, um, you sign on
to the contact, but usually a
certain amount of states will
come together and develop that
and sign on. And so the earlier
you come together or sign on,
you, you have a little more
influence on, on the development
of it, the later you come in,
it's kind of set in stone
because you might have 1020
states already signed on. In
this case,
We're going to be coming in
early because uh a few states
have already signed on and it's
kind of coming into fruition,
um, but that's kind of where we
are right now and I'll let my
expert respond that, that's OK,
um, I'll, I, I got a question
for him after and thank you,
Madam Chair.
You know, Senator, we've been
seeing a lot of compacts, uh,
this session. I don't, and I
don't know if we've, this is
something new or, or not. I, I
have no idea but um
It
I, I like him.
Um, I think it helps to maybe
provide us uh quicker.
licensing, so to speak, to kind
of get through the system. Is
that, is that fair to say?
Care center. I think it's
a reflection of what we're
seeing across the country now.
We have our shortage in New
Mexico, but we've seen contacts
with social workers, behavioral
health, um, in a lot of areas,
areas, um, even with nursing.
we've seen with COVID and travel
nurses.
Um, right now we have a contact
with nurses and I know in
situations where the military
spouse is a nurse, um, because
of that compact, it makes it a
lot easier for them to work in
our state. And so I think we're
just maybe looking at a lot of
more of these of these compacts
to see what we can do to
A lesson that barrier for folks
to work in our state.
Still providing
quality health care and safety
in mind um to New Mexicans, but
at the same time try to increase
access to help.
Thank you, Senator. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Um, Senator, you may not know
this.
Um, but I should have asked it.
Maybe
of the Lopez knows.
But when these compacts get
signed by the governor.
It's a bill, right? Yes, when
these compacts get signed by the
governor.
Is there, is there some type of
big group out there that uh
Reviews are, are compact and
says that you guys are good to
go. How does that work?
Man of center in front of the
leave as we pass this and sign
on and as I mentioned in the
presentation, we would actually
have representation.
that council or commission, but
I'll let my expert talk a little
bit about that as well.
Um, ma'am center, yeah, the, the
commission is made up of
representatives from each of the
states. So the states who have
already accepted into the
The commission of which there
actually are 10 right now, but
there are 16 pending like what
we are um wanting to get in, um.
they would review the language
that's actually adopted by this
and say, yes, you're, your
statute is consistent with what,
what we need in in this um
compact in order to participate.
So every state might have a
little bit different language in
their statute, but it just needs
to be consistent on the main
points, um, and so on. So they,
they would take
They would review it and then
take a vote. Yes, we're letting
them in.
But it, it, it would be a
forgone conclusion, I think,
because there's always a
negotiation ahead of time to
make sure that they would accept
it, so it's not, it's not likely
that if you pass something that
you actually have it turned out
unless there was something
really egregious missing. OK,
thank you, Madam sure, yeah,
that, that's why I was asking if
there's some type of format out
there with this commission where
we
We come to get this thing
greased and say all right, yeah,
we're gonna, we're gonna pass
this you guys good.
And I'm sorry, sir, can you, um,
refresh my memory again. Did you
say we passed a compact before
the previous issue but had to
make a couple changes to get
accepted back. Senator, there
was a contact on the military
educational one, the one that I
brought for kids coming in, um,
so that was signed off and it
was passed.
But folks from the compact
decided there was just some
cleanup that they wanted and so
that's what that was 2 words,
changing section to chapters,
and so those are things that can
happen.
Another example.
2 years I brought a compact to
And Space Force because it
became a new service, right? Um,
and so those are little updates
that can happen after a compact
design.
Thank you. And um
Madam Chair, lastly, uh,
Uh, Doctor, you're talking
about, we're having a hard time
keeping dentists in New Mexico,
and I, that's the first I've
heard of that because I mean we
always talk about nurses and
doctors.
PAs, um.
And you mentioned insurance
issues.
More so than medical malpractice
or maybe they're related.
What's, what's the big problem?
Um, while we're seeing an exodus
of docs and and
How do you know we're seeing an
exodus of docs, you have some
data to back that up.
Madam Chairman, uh, Madam Chair
and um Senator, um, we do have
some data, um, the ADA health
Policy Institute um tracks those
kinds of things in terms of, you
know, what states are increasing
and decreasing and where people
are migrating to and from.
Um, so, um, we can share that
with you. I don't necessarily
have it all here, but um, you
know, we are seeing this outflow
of dentists over the last 5
years especially. We probably
peaked, um,
Maybe 12 years ago and then
we're a little bit stagnant for
a while and now we're seeing
people migrating away and and so
on. So that would be the source
of our data and I'm sure that we
would be able to share some of
that.
Um
The reasons for that, um, I
mean, the reasons that we have
identified for that, um, one is
groceryreceipts tax to is uh for
Medicaid reimbursement, and 3 is
malpractice, um.
Environment, I guess here in
Mexico, um, I'm sure there's
others and I obviously it makes
a difference.
Each person has their own
reasons for why they're probably
talking about migrating, but in
general we have a, a kind of a
poor business environment for,
for healthcare and those are the
three things we've identified as
as being important.
Thank you, Doc. Maybe we can fix
that.
Um, thank you, Senator. Thank
you, Madam Chair. I yield.
Thank you, Senator Charlie.
Thank you, Madam Senator. Thank
you, um, Madam Cha and senator.
On page 14 starting at line 10,
the new section around active
military member active military
member spouse. I think this is
the first time I've seen this in
one of the compacts with such
specificity, and I was
wondering.
Um
Well, one, I just wanted to note
that, but second, um, are there
any other considerations for
exempting
Um
People to come to the state
waiving fees for
Um, compact privileges.
Madam Chair, Senator, um,
I don't believe so. I think
you're, you're bringing up a
good point, um, but I'll let my
expert.
Respond to that as well.
Um, Madam Chair and senator.
You know, the, the compact that
was uh was a group effort, um,
nationally, so American Dental
Association, American Dental
Hygienic Association. We're part
of that, but also the Department
of Defense, uh was a was a major
pusher for for this. And so I
suspect that as part of the
negotiations, one of the things
they're realizing is that we
need even added incentives to
make it easier so that there's
not additional charges for the,
for that and, and that's mainly
because they're particularly
mobile, they don't have any
choice.
but to be mobile and so we want
to make sure that we make it as
easy as possible. So it may be
because this is one of the
newest compacts where, that's
why that's been included in this
one and maybe not the other
ones, but otherwise I, I think
you'll see that in new compacts
that come from, from now on,
it's probably gonna be a
component of it.
And Madameur, Senator, I'd like
to add that I mentioned earlier
about folks make a decision
whether to come here, but
sometimes you don't have a
choice. You, you put down the
list and sometimes you get it,
sometimes you don't, and
sometimes folks are forced to
retire, say, hey, I.
I'm gonna retire because I don't
wanna go to this location.
There's several factors.
And um
I believe going forward on these
compacts, this is something that
they were just kind of looking
at this for the situation that a
lot of times they don't have
control, that spouse of where
they're gonna go.
Uh, Madam turn, Senator, thank
you. Yeah, I was a military
spouse for 10 years.
And did not have a choice of
where we got to go. We were
lucky a couple of times.
Um, so I appreciate this and
would love to see this like.
other context that we've passed
it.
Thank you, ma.
Yeah and for
A 2nd time, Senator Samuel
Lopez.
Just wanted to state another
reason, another great reason to
um.
have this and that is, we are
gonna have a dental school. It's
gonna be in my district. Toro is
gonna have its clinical practice
here and if we're members of the
compact, I think it's gonna make
it even more attractive for
people to come here. Hopefully
they will be enchanted like all
of us are.
And uh and want to stay.
But I think it, it is going to
attract them.
And I, I think that's such a
great idea.
Especially since we didn't have
a dental school, but we do now.
We will now, Guardian.
And Madam Chair and Senator,
just wanted to from the last
questions you had.
Um, say that we appreciate the
feedback that we're gonna look
at and we're also gonna talk
with uh Senator Trujil because
she was successful and we've
always heard getting these
contacts through her are really
hard to do. Um, I also want to
close and say that a lot of
people don't know I was actually
a dental assistant when I first
went in the Air Force. That's
what I did when I was enlisted.
And so, um, actually one of the
committee's Health and Human
Services, they kind of heard
about them, so that's one of the
reasons I'm sponsoring uh this
compact. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. There's a motion for
a due pass with Senator Charlie
with the 2nd from senator,
Sithia Lopez.
call the wrong
I
Sinner of luck.
And our bone than our Chadley.
Senator Gallegos.
No, yes, and our window.
And stop.
Center city of Lopez.
Yes, the hickey.
Yes.
General Lopez
Yes.
by a vote of 9 to 0, you have a
due pass recommendation. Thank
you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you committee members.
Thank you committee members,
we're done.
for the evening?
Please make sure you grab a
sandwich on the way out if you
haven't eaten already. We'll see
you tomorrow.
Thank you.
We are
