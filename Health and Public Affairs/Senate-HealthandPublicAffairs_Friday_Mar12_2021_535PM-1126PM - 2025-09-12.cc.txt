So.
Lopez did you get your order in
again.
Thank you.
We have a quorum so we're gonna
get started can you turn on the
webcast.
We can start.
Okay.
I had the first real up on the
agenda so I'm gonna turn the
meeting over to Senator.
How many to share the hearing on
Senate bill three fifty one.
Okay thank you Mr chair and that
good evening everyone.
We will start with Senator a
which is the panels Senate bill
three fifty one global hospital
budgets that's force.
proceed Mr chair.
Thank you Mr chairman and and
this is a bill chair of I
actually introduced last year
and then we when we get a little
reading of it.
I have an amendment by the way
so you know I mean we have to go
to a bar before I actually
sentiment will.
Very simple.
The bill does propose task force
it would study the issue of
global hospital budgets.
To see if we might try on a
pilot basis.
that approach to making sure
the.
Hospitals in primarily in rural
areas than any hospital it
really hasn't is a challenging
financial situation might
voluntarily agreed to
participate in a pilot.
And use it as a demonstration
project for the advocacy are
global graduated from hospital.
The idea is that instead of.
The hospital relying on a
patient.
getting bills reimbursed by new
make sure they covered all their
costs through their billing.
They would be guaranteed in
advance global budget for the
year that would cover their
costs.
And that.
Behind it is that should free
them.
Some of what goes on now.
You know it's all right I'm sure
is always you know very
carefully thought out.
There is the foundation of the
state for a hospital to.
Bill a little extra for services
and may not necessarily and then
needed to extend the state try
to make sure that they're
covered at all expenses will be
covered during the year so this
is an effort in separating the
survival financially in the
hospital from sharing at its
mission of caring for people
something is been done in a
couple of other states Maryland
for one is something that the
Medicaid division is very
interested in doing.
Although they are proposing
amendment to discuss with you.
So that in a nutshell is is is
what this bill is about creating
that task force that would.
Actually issue of
thank you hearing this is Maria
really should try and the
fighting hospital or hospitals
might want to join in the
demonstration project to see if
this can become basis for
changing a lot of our hospital
financing in the state.
And with that Mr chairman I
would like to propose the
amendment there's been suggested
by.
The department of Human Services
and the I'm not sure if Nicole
Comeaux the head of the Medicaid
division is listening or
will go astray works in that
division but they're the ones
who in suggested this and and
you posted over its
two oh seven three three point
one.
Thank you can see.
Thank you Mr thank you Mr chair
of.
Explain your amendment thanks
yes there is a religious it
of the many reasons indicated is
that they would like the work of
this task force.
To share a timeline in time
frame was there renewal of their
Medicaid waiver application and
so if we if we had the the task
force maintenance
recommendations to the
legislature by twenty twenty
three.
That would be a much more
hello full time frame then if
those recommendations came in
for two full years before the.
The waiver had to be filed so so
I you.
It's a simple images whatever
the word twenty twenty one and
we we change the twenty twenty
three but also postpones the
need to.
To get started as it has quickly
although we we haven't changed
any of the language in the bill
so that the task force committee
and assembling information
getting ready to go R. according
to the original time frame the
report wouldn't be due till
twenty twenty three.
Okay.
Most of the amendment Mr
chairman.
Okay we are we have a motion we
have a second.
Do you have a second from a
Senator Stefanics and
Do we need to call the roll or
just why doing that animus.
There is no opposition maybe we
can just accepted.
Okay of hearing up opposition
We'll we'll accept the.
The amendment unanimously thank
you Mr chair.
When I realize I didn't did you
Mr chairman the list of people
who wanted to speak I am
sure gave it to me okay.
We have a no one that.
Listed in the and against it
although we gives.
In the in the that we've just
summon as anyone that.
In the.
I'm bored against the Senate
bill three fifty one.
I hearing I will move to those
and support the first one we
have on our list is Barbara
Webber.
Is sending to Health Action New
Mexico go ahead Barbara.
Thank you Mr chair and members
of the committee my name again
is Barbara Webber executive
director Health Action New
Mexico and we really want to
thank the sponsor for bringing
what we think is a very
important bill will rolling
critical access hospitals are
essential for rural state like
New Mexico one in three New
Mexico's live in rural areas and
depend on its eleven critical
access hospitals and twenty
short term rural hospitals these
hospitals are also a significant
employer in the rural
communities yet before the
pandemic many of our New Mexico
rural hospitals to already on
life support and things have
become even more serious and
comment pandemic the COVID
pandemic in the past decade a
hundred and twenty rural
hospitals across the US we
closed.
Our rural hospitals in New
Mexico face major challenges
including lower patient volumes
and higher Medicare Medicaid
payer mix and aging
infrastructure and the shortage
of physicians and nurses as well
as the oldest health care
workforce in the country.
Looking at global US models
which have been encouraged by
CMS to stabilize rural hospitals
is a critical step to stabilize
our rural hospitals there two
predominant models of population
based model by Blue Cross blue
shield of Massachusetts which
has been in place since two
thousand and nine and the more
recent Maryland and Pennsylvania
models which are facility based
studying these payment models
with their state budgets through
the task force will allow for
stability and applying for
available federal funds for
demonstration project and it's
desperately needed for rural New
Mexico thank you.
Thank you Mr Stewart next week
of a marriage Feldblum with the
Health Security New Mexico I go
ahead Mary.
Changes over the last few years
so this would be very important
thing for us to look at.
We certainly appreciate again
the sponsor brand four one thing
I would suggest is adding a
member to the task force and
that would be the the office of
the superintendent of insurance
if we're going to truly look at
a global budget we not only need
to look at government sponsored
insurance payments but also
commercial payment so I would I
would make that suggestion and
thank you again we support this
legislation thank you for.
Thank you thank you Mr weeks
that's all the.
With who have signed up the.
Okay.
This bill so the next will move
to.
Members of the committee anyone
who.
Mr chairman I wondered are these
and then we made excellent
suggestions of.
It's all right I like to propose
a second amendment.
Sure go ahead that would be on
page two.
Or after line eighteen.
When searching for seventh.
Remember on the status of the
search has forced.
That we.
Representative of the
superintendent the office of the
superintendent of insurance.
Okay thank you Mr chair and the
and our second amendment.
We have.
We have a motion and a second
and the one wishing any member
wishing to discuss this
ammendment.
Hearing none please call the
roll penny.
Mr chairman.
Senator McKenna did raise your
hand the legislators.
okay.
Senator McKenna you have a
question or comment yes thank
you chairman yes sure is
chairman of the senator
explained the value of that I
think that additional person.
Mr Chairman.
Yeah Mr chairman and senator
merchandising Mr Weekes made a
really good pointed to.
Much of the the financial
situation confronting.
Rural hospitals includes.
The concerns of.
Racial insurance companies not
just Medicaid not just the
chair by the commercial
insurance companies and then
there needs to be some.
Our vision of their of their
interests and their perspective
here as we put together this
task force so I think I think
you made a good point.
Okay thank you.
Senator Mr chair Senator or
anyone that any other member
wishing to.
Speak and this.
Okay if not
any please call the roll.
I'm amendment number two to the
bill.
Sorry guys.
Yes ma'am.
Ingle.
This.
Senator McKenna.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Thanks yes so Madam yes.
Yes.
Okay you have been approved
amendment with our back and the
the bill anyone any member
wishing to speak.
The bill.
I don't see.
Senator a.
Great.
I'm sorry.
Thank you Mr chairman just one
more we're just one question on
on this.
this is my understanding is
these.
These
These types of models take us
away from the for service.
And as you have some time more
regular payments that go on
which of course the revenue
stream issue that some damage
but.
Has anyone looked at this model
so well if we if we kind of have
more of a Representative.
Stay stable revenue source.
what what is what what
safeguards are in.
What what safeguards are are put
in place to.
For that rationing of health
care.
Mr chairman and then Senator
Schmedes.
I'm not sure what one
hello to my knowledge the the
pilot projects and this was in
the state of Maryland.
And
So once once you leave the
hospital is free from the from
the necessity of of of.
Earning their continued.
The school solvency to.
Generating enough revenue from
the patients that come in there
really is no reason for them to.
To to deny health care or they
basically they simply.
serve whoever comes in with the
appropriate service.
And then at the end of the year.
Yes.
There is
The global budget was assigned
to the hospital hasn't been
sufficient to cover all the
costs that's why there is a
you're right.
That's rectified with the we
need returning source.
And.
The action is made for mobile
budget for the for the next year
that's we I understand two words
in the.
They just provided services to
whoever needs a service.
The money assigned is not
sufficient to cover it
indigestion is maybe the end of
the year go to to move into the
following year.
Is it.
Have any further questions.
Thank you.
Yes Mr chair and senator
my connection's not very good
but really it was the the
opposite of what I'm trying to
find out what if the funding is
greater than than the
expenditures at the end of the
year.
Well.
I mean I think a similar
adjustment would be made Mr
chairman and and Senator
Schmedes similar jobs and would
be made that we are you you
we thought surely serving more
people and you actually were.
Riding is a higher level of
service more expensive level of
service item and say higher
necessarily.
But we then make an adjustment
for the following year to take
that into account.
What is overall a little
creature for the year as a whole
rather than each individual day
of care in the hospital and the
patient order some extra.
An extra set of X. rays are
insurers million dollars for the
just to make sure we can pay our
bills and we.
Right right okay okay thank you
Mr chair thank you center.
Okay.
Thank you senator.
So any other members wishing to
speak on the policy of.
Senator is still Lopez.
Go ahead.
Yes thank you Mr chair and this
is probably and I apologize this
is probably more for me than
anybody else
I.
I think this is a great bill and
I'm gonna vote for it but I
don't understand the difference
between this and a memorial
and if you could just explain it
to me.
and white why you chose to do it
this way instead of a morale and
and.
Well I have a lot of people talk
to me about some of my bills and
you know so.
Well Mr chairman and and and
senator
I mean I think I think this
makes it all the way through
both houses of the legislature
would have more wage
and and and because the Medicaid
division is interested in doing
this and because the hospital
association is supportive of the
idea.
R. I suppose it.
Program in New Mexico original
idea was to appropriates the
money that's why we reintroduces
of Bill
But when the lady in in the
starch.
We don't necessarily need to
have the money in order to get
started on this I would
anticipate that the Medicaid
provision consignments the start
up of this probably if this
passes and and and signed into
law in the next session we will
have to appropriations budget
some money here and willing for
the next three years so that we
can finish the whole process.
Thank you Mr chair that explains
a lot because then you'll have
it in place thank you I
appreciate that explanation
thank you.
Okay one.
Also Senator a Gaydos.
Thank you Mr chairman Mr.
As notion they're fine are it
talks to the HSE H. S. descended
be impossible for them to do
this without additional staff
and when you're just talking
about of financially right now
are money.
Have you talked to them about
what it would take to they don't
even have of the local level a
level of Medicaid subject matter
expertise and just wondering if
they contact you Mr.
Nicole Comeaux the head of the
ministry's division this morning
Mr chairman and senator of Taos
and she indicated they were
supportive of the thank you if
they if they need additional
expertise are they certainly
could provide money
CMS for forgetting this on three
grounds
that that CMS.
When it comes in.
The new cares Act.
There is just signed in should
be sufficient I mean it it'll
just be a few I would imagine
just a few hundred thousand
dollars is all it would take you
to the match that you could do
it every day so hi I don't see
your financing is going to be a
problem Lee she initiated this
morning they were confident they
can do it at least get it
started and then we will we
probably will have to commend
resent appropriations next year.
Mr
chair I just keep hearing sermon
else's discussion on the floor
that this year looks really good
but next year may not be as nice
so I I'm so I guess I'm just
trying to be cautious of one HSD

hours of training in caring for

honorable senators of the
committee my name is Zach
regained better align the state
ombudsman for the state of New
Mexico I advocate on behalf of
over thirteen thousand residents
in long term care facilities and
their family members as well as
guarded the powers of attorney
in certain situations we're
offering full support of this
bill and have been with the team
since the beginning and drafting
of this bill since the house
side no one no two things about
this bill the first is that it
specializes in training for long
term care situations that
involve dementia related
residence or the populations
that will
four of the face this situation
and the part that I'm really
focused on in this part is that
advocacy related towards
dementia and memory care
residents has been a stable
point of the state since other
over the last few decades but
more recently it's come into
focus from the care that has
been needing to be provided a
lot of the the folks in long
term care facilities need to
have somebody that has a
specialized competence
background and another part
about this bill that I'd like to
share is that it also received
unanimous bipartisan support
from the health side and both
committees had a seventy to zero
vote in the house floor so we
are humbly asking for your
support for this bill thank you
very much.
thank you miss care for your
remarks.
The next step we have Jackie
Cooper Representative A. A. R.
P. Jackie go ahead thank you
very much Mr chairman of I'm
Jackie Cooper of an AARP
volunteer advocate and I would
like to thanks for the
Representative Serrato for
bringing this forward training
in recognizing treatment of
dementia patients is essential
for better outcomes for patients
and their staffs and A. R. P.
stands in support of these
regions of state thank you so
much.
Thank you thank you for your
comments and next up we have
Kerry robin number under
Representative New Mexico.
Medical Society.
Hello.
Good evening Mr chairman and
members the committee Kerry rob
under under registered lobbyists
of the New Mexico Medical
Society we do think that the
intent behind this bill is very
important to make sure that all
of our all of our workers have
this kind of training we we do
want to make sure that we are
involved in the rulemaking
process that is going to be
occurring after this bill passes
you know our medical providers
are are and Senator DO is have
had very big requirements that
they have around their medical
license for continuing education
and we just want to make sure
that those are taking it into
consideration as the rules are
being promulgated but we do
support the intent of the
legislation thank the sponsor
for bringing and we hope to have
further conversations in the
interim once this is being
rolled out.
Thank you Mr.
The last for that certain at
least within the sequel with the
New Mexico nurses association.
Thank you Mr chair members the
committee Linda say go with the
New Mexico nurse practitioner
council and we share some of the
same concerns of the medical
society we have geriatric nurse
practitioners who often are of
the provider that goes into
particularly in nursing home and
certainly they are well trained
and the clientele that they are
serving and so it it's it's a
concern to us that they would be
required to watch a four hour
video but I think hopefully we
could resolve those issues and
the rulemaking process if if
certain licensed professionals
you know already have this
training that that perhaps they
wouldn't have to go through what
I think is really for a lot of
non licensed or just certified
providers so thank you Mr
chairman members.
Thank you for that your remarks
that's all we.
For for what everyone who is
eyeing up.
This evening and then I will
turn to the committee anyone
wishing to speak on behalf of
this bill.
Senator giggles go ahead please
thank faster and she represented
by just a touch base because it
shows that the department of
health is looking somewhere
between eighty to a hundred
thousand dollars to be able to
fund this have we had
discussions on where that money
will come from.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
senator for the question on one
question actually have Mr
Chairman is that I had had the
ombudsman's asking dental and
Tommy Hernandez with the
Alzheimer's association of my
witnesses it's all right I'd
like if the ombudsman could
address that because we had have
that conversation earlier please
thank you thank you.
Because the funding resources
are going to be pulled from both
general fund resources and also
existing programs within the
department of health and aging
long term services department
it also states in the
legislation that there is a
combined consultation
requirement with the aging long
term services to a department to
identify funds that's going to
be a key provision as well as
making sure that there's no cost
passed on to folks that are
doing this training that need
this training there is free
training provided for these
providers in partnership with
the Alzheimer's association
graciously we thank Tom
Hernandez for that as well as
the Alzheimer's association of
New Mexico thank you senator.
Thank you.
This vice chair and just
Representative I appreciate that
I like the bill I just didn't
want it to be an unfunded
mandate that the centers would
have to recoup the cost from the
residence so with that all yield
thank you thank you Mr chairman
thank you senator.
Thank you for your question
Senator any others.
The we next okay here from
Senator road participate I'll go
ahead.
Thank you Mr chairman and.
I just wanted to ask about the
the amendment was put on the
bill Representative to check
out.
That language.
The.
Video audio or telephonic.
From the definition of direct
care services used in the bill.
What does that leave you with it
or or does that mean you can do
it anyway thank you Mr chairman
and thank you Mr chairman for
the question you know with the
that came at the request of the
New Mexico health care
association New Mexico Center
for assisted living and what it
does is it says that if they
work less than ten hours with
the facility then they are
exempt from it so it allows you
know one off telehealth you know
one off nurse calls that may
come up on so because we don't
want to get in the way of that
of the supply of doctors it
telehealth if however a provider
via telehealth or on the phone
isn't regular consultation with
on patients and they would be
required to have and are in
regular consultation in excess
of ten hours on than they would
be required to have the
training.

public retiree beneficiary

Well I guess senator Harper is

Hey the members of the committee
have any questions regarding
this bill.
I don't see any hands up so
broke thank.
Senator Sedillo Lopez you have
your hand up.
Maybe just because I'm so
curious about pensions I of.
Is this a P. R. right Sanchez
Bill.
Thank you.
This needs to be rolled over
this is if it's not
I don't remember this from the
investments that can to
oversight committee.
Mr chair my my question is the
relationship of this to
community property because I
think.
It's a married person has
interest in community property
and then allowing this change I
think affects committee property
so I think that's actually a
very significant question.
Okay we have a suggestion.
Roll over and we have a question
from one of the.
So Mr here I think is from the.
Yes hi Mr chairman if I may go
ahead Mr trail thank you a
greater here with New Mexico B.
R. A. P. R. A. does support this
legislation and to Senator
Sedillo Lopez is of question a
court order still trump's this
yes
this legislation only allows for
a change if the ex spouse
consents to it so if a court
order does not dictate that this
this will not be allowed Mr
chairman and senator.
Okay thank you Mr hill for that
explanation.
Senator do I still have the
floor yes you do to go ahead
Senator.
I'm having divorced I see the
consent requirement could you
pointed out to me I I.
Maybe I missed it.
Was on page three I'm coming
divorced.
I I'm sorry Mr chair I just I'm
not finding that provision which
is what raised my red flag about
this.
Hello
Madam chair Jason Harper.
What
is a sponsor.
Representative Representative
percent.
Yeah I'm yeah I just got on I
heard there was a question could
someone please repeat it.
Yes thank you thank you thank
you Representative
My question is how this bill
relates to community property
because a to me allowing a
divorced person.
To to make the change in the
absence of consent or a court
order
is is problematic with the with
community property law and I'm
not seeing that there's consent
or a court order here.
maybe there's maybe there's
something that's just not in the
bill maybe there's another place
in the statute but I I that
concerns me.
Yes thank you great question is
actually one of my questions
and and that in the bill and I
don't have in front of me
but there are two things in
there but I I believe address
your question the first is the
the current beneficiary has to
find a notarized statement that
they relinquish
There are
That benefit.
The line and.
Thank you chairman.
So so they have to.
You have to agree to relinquish
it us all right the staff and
and I believe it's a little
before that
and I I believe it's current law
it says that all of this is
subject to court order.
I went to the very top of that
page
so.
So if if there's a court order
you know back to the community
property you know whatever is
decided
at the core level is supersede
of this.
Mr chair I I'm not seeing the
court order plate white and of
this Mr chair Senator Mr chair
or you know number of ten
through twelve talks about a
current spouse on on some of
starting at page seventeen I
mean I'm page one twenty is
aware of the divorced that the
issue I'm concerned about is the
divorced spouse the current
spouse yes I agree that that's
there but I don't see the same
provision for a divorce well.
It's it's there and I just
walked in my door were I
actually have my my bills.
so I'm pulling it up here.
But you're right there two
sections in the bill
one
Yield was.
Encouraging one deals with.
I'm not encouraging.
So on page four on one page one
in five it talks about the
pension being subject to a court
order but there's not a
provision for consent.
So is the is the idea that a a
current spouse would consent and
then a divorced spouse would
have to get a court order wall
wall
Yes.
based off of what we
constituent.
The leanest.
All was worried.
All all they got divorced one of
the most.
Both of all.
Relationship with each other.
Once all what was current spots.
This year it is our office with
the action this side.
What
Work with women of this with the
performance of course this bill.
While working at the legislation
webpage we won Mr chair Senator.
Mr chair so I I see on page
three when we're talking about
the retired member of.
Which uses the B. or C. option
the spouse can consent with the
notarized written statements so
that is the current status.
Where I've run into problems
with these pensions because that
because you have to do a
qualified domestic relations
order.
And where I've run into problems
is the relationship between the
pension of the qualified
domestic relations order and
enforcing the qualified domestic
relations order with pension
plans and so what I don't see
and subsection.
Three.
Dealing with divorce is a way to
easily enforced a qualified
domestic relations plan it
sounds like you would have to
get.
A court order and that's the
only way to make the change and
then there would be a hundred
dollar charge to defray the
cost.
The new pension amount so my
And and maybe the P. R. at a
board handles it better than
other pension plans that I've
dealt with in the past.
But I've had some problems with
with the enforcement of the
qualified domestic relations
order.
With pension plans in and so I'm
a little bit of.
That's my question is what's the
relation how does.
I know what it says and I feel
like it would create problems.
And I guess I I would like to
see that fixed.
So
Chair and senator thank you
Yeah I'm I'm looking at.
Four
four here and it shows up you
know I'm looking at page four I
I don't know why members who are
all the equipment and concepts
Services upon the kind of
forced.
Maybe I'm looking at the wrong
wrong I apologize.
Where is the amendment.
Yes that was amended with
language we got from her.
and Mister chair I don't know if
Mister Greg Trujillo is in the
audience perhaps and he could
come on.
Okay yes Mister chair Mister
chair I am here.
It's.
Thank you please.
Mister chairman Senator Sedillo
Lopez the way para would
administer this if the divorce
order was silent on
Who the beneficiary was at the
time then the.
And the Expos consensus you know
notarized document for us to do
this we would look at that and
and if it wasn't in conflict
with the court order we would do
that if it was in conflict that
we would require a new divorce
order over updated decree
allowing for the beneficiary
change but but this is something
that we would do on a case by
case basis well run through our
legal and if additional research
or paperwork was needed we would
we would would request that a
member before we made the
change.
Thank you Mr chair that's
precisely the problem we ready
we run into with these pension
plans
Yes the amendment said did not
address my my problem I see I'd
be amendments are good but it
didn't.
Dress my issue and if I may Mr
chair in center city Lopez the
the limitations we have for a
retiree to change a beneficiary
after retirement have been
limited to a beneficiary that
was a non spouse that was
designated as a non spouse so
this legislation would open up
for a spouse to be changed
within these parameters.
Mr chair representative so what
exactly is the problem that this
is addressing.
I always ask myself that yes.
I'm sorry Mr chair Senator thank
you for for the good question
and and the problem is that I
have constituent and and
apparently this isn't an
uncommon occurrence.
that would like to change the
beneficiary
and and his former spouse is
willing to do that but they
cannot under current law.
To make that change.
Well Mister chair.
Representative.
They will still have to go to
court with this change.
Is that your intention.
Because they would have to go to
court I I I just I don't think
that this is of.
So the qualified domestic
relations order is in order to
the pension plan.
Instead of ordering the pension
to be distributed in accordance
with the domestic relations
order.
And.
And so this is just stating what
current law is this does not
solve the problem that I thought
you were trying to solve which
is a problem that I've had in
with pension plans and and
whatever your constituent in
constituent about with trying to
enforce a court order.
You know but we using a noted
rule now what what was said is
that it which is absolutely the
law if if the order is silent on
it they will take in order
notarized consent form so that's
what happens now my question is
is does this bill I don't see
how this bill solves the problem
that you're trying to address if
it's just stating what the
current law is.
That makes sense it Mr chairman
and senator if I may.
It's it's Senator Sedillo Lopez
so this this change the only
pertains to the designated
beneficiary if an ex spouse is
entitled to fifty percent of the
pension the ex spouse will
continue receiving that fifty
percent of the pension however
if if the other portion of the
member the retired member wants
to leave their fifty percent of
that pension to the new wife for
new styles and the Expos
consensus that that is what this
bill does it has nothing to do
with acting the split or
anything that was pre determined
in the court order at the
original divorce it's strictly
the naming of a new beneficiary.
For the portion the member is
entitled to.
Thank you Mr chairman subsection
two I do not see the consent of
the work first thousand
required.
It Mr chairman Senator Sedillo
Lopez it may not subsection
three I apologize subsection
three it in I don't think we
would proceed if if we saw
anything in conflict with that
so what we saw nothing in
conflict then we would proceed
with name again we we do have a
request from members attempting
to change their beneficiary
after retirement to and if they
don't meet the provisions in the
current statute we will not
process it.
Mr Mr chair of Representative
did this go through Judiciary
House Judiciary.
Chairman Senator it went through
House consumer public affairs
and house state government.
And this is the only Canadian
that it's coming to hear.
chair and senator I believe
that's correct.
I'm very sorry but I would have
to vote no on this bill I don't
believe that it solves the
problem that you're trying to
solve and I believe it maybe
raising community property
issues.
at least as I'm reading the bill
I don't think that is your
intent but it does not provide
for what you said the first
spouses consent
In in subsection Lori I
associated just wide for a
corner I I just believe that the
way it's written now they right
may cause more problems than
you're trying to solve and I'm
not on Judiciary here in the
Senate but I just to share with
you why I taught family law.
And and I just see problems with
the bill has it's currently
written so I'm gonna have to
vote against and I apologize
it's on consent calendar but
it's it's a problem I see and I
I would just suggest.
And I apologize so late in the
session and and I'm sure you did
expected but I just don't think
that if it is going to Judiciary
they would have let it come out
like this well.
Mr chair and senator
I want to make sure we get this
right my my reading did not come
up with this issue and
that I would like to do is you
know perhaps work with you on
but if we need to have a floor
amendment on this you know
what's council said this bill
does what it needs to do I
worked with the Mr human para
and maybe amendments that they
felt were appropriate and
borders endorsed it so I'm you
know I I I've been going forward
in good faith you know trying to
try to get this fixed and and
you know leveraging your
expertise
Mr chair Senator I would like to
work with you and to make sure
that this is right.
Mr Chairman in the Senator if I
may before we proceed.
it under under current processes
if the spouse is divorced they
are allowed to file a court
order
and receive the higher of the
new with the amount option
eight.
The current statute does not
allow them for to designate a
new beneficiary or another
spouse as a beneficiary I think
that is kind of the core of what
this what this bill does it
allows that option but yeah we
we can pay a member a higher
amount based on court order we
just can't have them name
another beneficiary if if that
helps at all.
Mr chair I understand that what
I'm saying though is when that
happens and the new spouse comes
into the picture you haven't
gotten consent from the first
spouse and
I as you described it Mr chair
or a is yes your expert
Representative described it is
you were requiring both in each
option and it treats current
spouses this print trades
response is different from
former spouses and and and what
was described is.
Like I said I I can see it I've
had to in the clinic we have to
enforce these qualified domestic
relations orders and we we have
problems with enforcement.
I I don't remember specifically
P. R. eight but we had because
if you don't goes to whatever is
a real retirement plan the the
qualified domestic relations
order and the if forced to
preserve provisions and when new
spouses into the plan and change
the plan it's a surprise to the
old spouse if it changes their
budget in any way which is why I
think it's important that you
get consent.
But.
I don't think it solves the
problem you're trying to solve.
Thanks center can I interrupt I
just but I suggest that you get
together was sent with the
Representative Harper Mr he'll
work to solve online we can do a
floor amendment.
And the Senate set me with your.
Approval.
Mr chair we should not we should
get this fixed we should roll
this fall this bill over get it
fixed bring it back yes I
believe our meeting on Sunday is
that correct yes so if
day then I'd be happy to vote
for it because these four
minutes are really tricky.
and and I just think it be
better to have it going on to
the floor in good shape because
I think like I said I don't
think you're the house Judiciary
Committee whatever that is I get
by like this.
Okay will roll over and that
bring it back on Sundays at.
That's okay with the committee I
I just I just see that legal
problems.
We need to take a vote on the
that are really just the same
thing we just we take it off
even saying challenger and re
scheduled for Sunday then that
gives Representative are very
chance to worry Mr Trujillo and
the and senators so your lotus.
Finding if there is a need to
make any amendments Asian nation
if they can show heard their
inner satisfaction it's not
needed then we can vote on it on
Sunday.
Decided we're gonna roll over
house bill two seventy seven
once amended and tell some.
Mr chairman.
Go ahead Senator Mr Chairman
just trying to find out of time
line for Sunday so that waste
Representative Harper would know
what our our schedule is well
we're meeting as senator at one
thirty on Sunday.
Yes that's helpful and and like
I like I said I'm the pleasure
the committee I think that's
totally fine before meeting on
Sunday I'm I'm not worried about
time we can get this right
so it would this is a non
controversial I'm not trying to
cause a problem trying to solve
let's get right.
Yes.
Representative Harper
For a.
Going along for green to roll
this over and we'll talk to you
again at spending.
Thank you chairman.
So hello.
Senator penalises William J.
Representative Jr all thank you
so.
Representative A. Ives you're
here for wins.
Sixty one.
One.
The committee and go ahead with
the three summary of your bill
thank you.
Thank you members of the
committee and the and gentleman
in question this is a petition
that is that is a petition for
inter.
With me.
Municipal corporation shall use
the population that are provided
by the university of New Mexico
bureau of business and economic
research in some mention it's
just us keeping the data that
was most recent done our senses
to help of a small areas like
myself who is looking for a
corporation to not have to
otherwise come back and have to
spend money about twenty
thousand dollars to have to do
this sentences again and this.
Okay.
Finally with other parts of the
state nor is to be able to use
us as well small self in the
seven out of the local
government act sincerely
struggle to get us of funding
down that way so I think I can
peel to the senses of the board
members the committee I stand
for questions.
Okay
thank you for your presentation
Representative we have a.
Having won the signed up to the
for instance to return to the
committee members for.
I see a Senator so the phonics
hand as well go ahead Senator.
I didn't lower it I might have a
question in a minute thank you
okay thank you the next step we
have those centers Gaydos go
ahead Senator.
Senator doing your muted center.
Thank you Mr vice chairman and
representative I'm glad you made
with grilled your bill and I had
just one question for you
because if I understand right
now you wouldn't have a the
first census it says if you
incorporators territory you
would not have a fee is that
correct.
As a territory I'm not sure
about but what did was hold the
census of the of the most recent
has been compiled by the
university of New Mexico.
Rural so this is all it's it's
allowing for us to hold this
portion of the senses to be able
to be used for any small
communities are looking or
seeking to become missile
policies are meant incorporation
two minutes thousands.
Okay and and I guess come on
wanting on the on the
municipality that and what would
they use.
The census for in order not to
have to pay for it again.
I'm not understanding the
question completely senator
dole's whose so.
Yeah stand in the corporation
well let me just I'll go
straight to the point I'm
working with Texas on
segregating the I all guests
counties on south east side of
the state.
Order to if you are I figured
the state and one miss Texas
will but in that's segmenting of
the state if I'm understanding
right you wouldn't have to
reproduce a new census you could
segregated out at no cost is
that sound right.
Senator because I think that's
an excellent question I do have
my expert witness but I don't
know if you're if you're able to
be let in.
All our.
I was just.
To me one second to be sure
because I think the the clarity
or is is that there should be
trained what we're talking
pertains to a portion of Texas
or just in the state of New
Mexico.
Well the the five county Mr Mr
by chair representative of would
currently be.
New Mexico as they go towards
being a territory in order to be
absorbed to Texas.
Thank you like to come for my
experts.
Mr chairman we just project to
this question has nothing to do
with this bill and weird this is
on a consent calendar so maybe
Senator Gallegos can meet with
Representative Madrid later on.
Discuss.
Seceding from New Mexico that
does not have anything to do
with this bill and so I.
I I just don't think it's
helpful at all in this context
well Mister chair and and Mr
chair my email is here says
incorporation petition must
include well on one line.
Individuals wishing it helps
question how would this work for
the census and it has a remark
said individuals wishing to
incorporated territories would
no longer have to pay for census
to be conducted that's my
question and that's.
An FIR I'm just trying to find
out if my details right or wrong
good Mr Lau's made to do what
I've been thinking do for few
years now.
My experts.
Thanks for witness has to deal
with the corporation to becoming
a city so in reference to your
question of my for women said no
it would not be able to be used
for that principle.
Thank you Representative thank
you Mr chairman Mr all yield.
Okay.

ahead.
Senator Ortiz.
That's right they said you're
the next one up it just came in
and told us.
And senator John and I'm gonna
switch other than to Judiciary
okay.
All thank thank you Mr chair
next up we have a Senate bill
three sixty eight limited
English access to state programs
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Please proceed with your bill.
Thank you so much I am actually
just got my dinner delivered so
I was distracted.
College eyes.
Thank you Mr chair three sixty
three sixty eight it's
unfortunately that Mr chair
cheesy piano left because he
knows that we've been working on
this for for quite some time of
when I was in Los included the
idea we actually appeared before
one of the interim committee she
chaired about this very issue it
was during the Martinez
administration and at a loss a
great idea and Asian family
services center we're really
having problems with language
access issues degree in the
department of health and in CYFD
and we do there are there are
quite a few problems
so.
The with Senate bill three six
and the I would just mention
during the interim Senator Ortiz
Y. Pino was chair of wrote a
letter to each of the agencies
to ask for their language access
plan and not a single one
responded to him
so I was very pleased that when
I became a senator that the
Asian family services in the
group I am the the center for
one of poverty contacted me
about bringing this bill it was
so what this bill does is it
requires state agencies that are
headed by secretaries to do
three things that is assessed
the number of people that they
serve that primarily speak a
language other than English and
to determine the resources
needed to ensure meaningful
access to services like public
benefits and unemployment
insurance and then to develop
and implement an annual plan to
provide meaningful access to
state programs for individuals
and primarily speak languages
other than English and submitted
annual report to the governor
and legislative finance
committee now we have an
amendment to the bill.
And what the so would you like
to hear the amendment or the
issue to have the amendment I
believe it was provided was
provided weeks ago.
I mean out weeks ago the time
has so such an interesting
meeting here of days ago.
Ms Mr chair could you ask driver
to put the amendment on the.
However.
Please put the amendment up.
So that the public.
Trevor.
thank you.
Thank you.
So and this was in response to
the FY are the first part of it
was in response to the FIR full
access will be replaced by
meaningful access in every place
it appears in the bill of
meaningful access is a term that
is used by federal law and there
is lots of lots of guidance
concerning language access under
the Civil Rights Act again the
term appears three times in the
bill what I'm page one line
twelve so that would be strike
full and insert a little more of
meeting full page four line one
which would strike full and
insert include more up there of
meaningful one on page four line
thirteen strike full and insert
we're live there of meaningful
so that was a very good the
change and then this was my
mistake I thought that there
should be some consequence for
them failing to provide these
these plans.
And so I of.
But in that if there are
that this should be provided to
let legislative finance that
would affect their up their
ability to seek a change order
and what that did was a it ended
up earning us of.
A referral to finance and I
really realize that was a bit
larger consequence than was
intended so we're striking line
seventeen through twenty one on
page four in their entirety.
And so that would eliminate any
financial impact with state
agencies and so to answer the
question what is
what distinguishes this from a
memorial it's the same question
that's that are chair again and
that it was it would raise it in
significance and importance.
And yes it would take of.
If these reports are made then
it would be helpful if any
appropriations are needed to
provide with this we believe
that this bill actually saves
money because
Agencies can share resources the
resource that we used to the
last agreed that it was simply a
language line
for for a we're languages the
other than Spanish we had we had
interpreters for Spanish so
That is a description of the
bill I'd like to turn it over to
my experts.
Veronique.
very needs Mr.
We should take action on the
amendment that's right please

sensitive programs and services
creating a pan Asian community
that advocates for and supports
itself back in two thousand and
six that Asian families was
founded due to recognition that
linguistically accessible direct
services for Asian communities
in New Mexico or nonexistent and
that this population had been
historically underserved within
the state and now fifteen years
later our daily work continues
to address the systemic
disparity by supporting families
in accessing and navigating the
social and governmental
resources while simultaneously
combat in the barriers are
community space within the
systems.
One of the main barriers that we
see New Mexicans confront is
language access within state
agencies.
Let me tell you about in New
Mexicans child was a victim of
domestic violence after being
removed from the violent and
dangerous situation he was
relocated to live with his
grandfather a low income elderly
man who didn't speak any English
when CYFD came for home
visitations they didn't find
interpretation leaving the
grandfather without adequate
access to resources necessary to
raise this child or the ability
to make informed decisions on
behalf of his family ultimately
they had to turn to the Asian
families for health
unfortunately the story is not
isolated.
Last year eighty eight percent
of our clients require services
to access critical basic
resources in a language other
than English direct evidence
that many New Mexicans are
falling through the gaps when
interfacing with the state when
the state when community members
come to us they often disclose
that they have already exhausted
all other mainstream options to
access the help they're seeking
or trying to their children who
cannot and should not carry this
burden.
Well we're grateful for the
efforts that have been made over
the years most apartments still
lack equitable language access
and for a little historical
context the effort for providing
language access in New Mexico
has been ongoing for years and
yet we still haven't seen
significant access changes
implemented.
In two thousand fifteen Senate
memorial fifty nine sponsored by
Senator Mimi Stewart passed
unanimously which requested that
the governor issue an executive
order ensuring access to state
programs Representative to speak
languages other than English the
following year Senate Joint
Memorial ten also passed
unanimously which requested the
department of health convene a
language access task force even
with the full access of this I
on both of these memorials the
convening of a task force and to
the extension of the memorial
there were no meaningful changes
for communities who speak
languages other than English.
And this is why we say that we
need something better many
communities to speak languages
other than English are far too
often forgotten in the landscape
of Mexico the state frequently
celebrates diversity while
simultaneously forgetting to
value and support the diverse
language needs language uploads
culture and history and as a
form of power resilience and
self determination for families
across New Mexico everyone
including those who speak
languages other than English
deserves to have access to the
resources intended to support
them.
This bill will ensure more New
Mexicans their rights to public
resources alleviate small
grassroots organizations like
ours of the burden of being a
catch all to fill every gap in
accessible services and give
informed decision making power
and agency back to New Mexicans
nineteen other local
organizations have also signed
in support this bill our
communities are asking for echo
access to state agencies and we
urge you to hear them thank you
and I'll stand for questions.
Okay thank you.
Thank you for your presentation
You have a we don't have anyone
to sign up
Mr chair there is another aspect
expertise that is that any said
that a claim of the pedigree no
bomba who is an attorney with
the New Mexico Center of lawn
property.
Okay thank you Senator.
Well the expert witness please
proceed.
Hello Mister chair members of
the committee my name is that
any separate agreement bond fund
management New Mexico's an
online poverty they are
nonprofit organization our
mission is to advance economic
and social justice through
education advocacy and impact
litigation we partner with
community members advocates and
tribal leaders to identify and
address systemic issues
impacting low income people.
Every New Mexicans should have
should be able to access state
services regardless of the
language that they speak.
This bill like the senator said
requires agencies to do three
things assess the need of New
Mexicans surviving agency for
interpretation and translation
services in order to access
services a number to create a
plan to provide meaningful
access to state programs for New
Mexicans who speak languages
other than English three report
upon the implementation of that
language access plans the
legislative finance committee
and the executive language
access plans are already
required under federal law.
This bill makes state agencies
more efficient and coordinated
in delivering language access
services like translation and
interpreting we see that even
though some agencies to provide
language access services other
agencies don't and if agencies
were coordinated we could
prevent duplication of efforts
and expand access the biggest
barrier to language access is
planning which this bill does
with planning and coordination
family and community members
will no longer have to bear this
burden often family members have
to play this role including
children I've personally been
seeing how hard it is for
families who don't have access
to interpreting as a kid I
frequently interpreted for my
parents I unfortunately had to
be involved in matters that I
was too young to understand and
not mature enough to deal with I
was not qualified to interpret
when it came to complicated
matters like public benefits or
health care coverage my parents
access to state services
definitely suffered from my
limited eight year old
understanding and vocabulary.
This is a big responsibility to
place on children and the state
should provide interpreting and
translation so that children are
not put in this position
organizations simply do not have
the capacity or the
responsibility of a lot to make
state services accessible we
commend the legislature for
taking important steps to
provide interpreting during the
legislative session for the
first time this bill will help
our communities get equal access
to the services they need thank
you and I will stand for
questions.

Mr chair members of the
committee and everyone here
today my name is Pharm.D how
would you a nail Walker we live
in Albuquerque I strongly
support SB three sixty eight
because I believe this bill will
help my family and not many at
this I'd like to share my with
you my family story four months
ago all six members of my family
in fact it's the COVID nineteen
my two children under five grand
contracted the virus from the
daycare they went to and then
all of us got it as a result we
have to stop looking and apply
for unemployment benefits we
have a full house and three got
locked so I had to get up every
day only four days to call the
center from six AM but their
lives will be easy all the time
it was so difficult and I
couldn't reach anyone even when
Michael got through to this that
I could communicate with them
you too due to my limited
language capacity they didn't
have any interpreter to help me
it took over a month for us to
re open alakal into and for us
to receive the unemployment
benefits it was so hot for my
family during that time I really
hope Mr chair and members of the
committee to vote for this bill
to provide language assistance
for finance for my family's.
And others with limited English
proficiency like us thank you
very much.
Thank you for your presentation.
Next up we have any lemming with
the national Asian Pacific women
American women's forum.
Are you available on this Lente.
okay.
Thank you she's not available so
the next step up is John.
Yeah.
The central ministries.
Are you available John.
Okay this.
I guess he's not available
except we have Cecilia portal.
Hi my name is Jesse up or
calling them the founder and
director of Valley Community
interpreters
and Valley Community interpreter
is committed to improve and
increase language access all
levels of New Mexican society we
do this through troop to program
areas the VCI academy where we
train interpreters we're
building a workforce of
interpreters in the state so
hopefully it when state
government is considering
language services they can
provide workers in New Mexico
that can find a qualified
interpretation and we also have
the language service agency
where we provide over the phone
in person and written
translation.
and when we started the CLI it
was really shocking to us to see
how limited language access was
being provided in the state.
And New Mexico is a multi
lingual multicultural state a
border state that really should
be a leader in the country for
language access.
Thank you Mr chairman your
remarks.
Except we have a Russell.
Have to fight with the NM es FC.
Is Russell with us.
next up we have D. **** with the
Asian business collaboration.
Yes thank you thank you I'm date
was Asian business collaborative
and our organization supports
Asian Pacific Islander business
owners and and close the
environment to support their
business without language or
cultural barriers during the
COVID pandemic Asian business
owners have seen an increase in
violence racist remarks and a
severe drop in business on top
of those incidents business
owners continue to overcome
language barriers and cultural
barriers more and more local
business owners can already take
advantage of that I've been
paying for that of the station
and seek help for grant
opportunities and the public
assistance but many cannot
complete application materials
without help and their language
and thank you for your support
to this bill thank you.
Thank you for your remarks next
up we have Maria del to Mingus.
Your available memory.
hearing nothing will move on to
Through.
To check out to.
Hi Ankit good evening Mister
chair and members the committee
I am my telephone get in these
community leaving Albuquerque so
I'm support SB three sixty
because we experienced some
difficulties about the language
that says anything this bill is
very important and necessary for
our community so today I want to
share the story of my friend she
doesn't speak English but what
time she has a car accident and
when the police can be on the
into the another party school
speak English and Spanish and
they didn't interview and asked
her if she need the interpretive
so he was so upset and
frustrated because they didn't
need for a chance to explain her
story about how the site so
means on the party they can say
anything and then the police
asked her to sign on the report
he signed with the understate
understanding of what they were
road on the report and they
didn't even instruct her way she
could file a report so her
husband after that do with the
car insurance company without
knowing who follows or so she
failed very upset and very
unfair so we would like to see
our our state agency off of the
and could eight language support
for our community and we urge
you to vote for the SP three
sixty eight thank you so much.
Thank you.
And for your remarks.
The next step with the.
Kelly.
Tell.
It is in person yeah let me say
that it sent budget time thank
you.
Okay now we have the Sonya the
end.
Yes good evening all Mr chairman
and members the committee my
name is Tanya Albuquerque and I
fully support SB three sixty
eight over the years I've seen
increasing number of Chinese
immigrants immigrants and try in
Albuquerque because of the
multicultural marriages and I
see a lot of them are sometimes
experience Mexico violence and
the need to cut family
counseling all I see are in
increasing cars about these
services in our local Chinese
group chat and also see small
business owners asking for
COVID testing and COVID X. any
permission all mmhm I also have
a friend who's of a small
business owner and the single
water and she it's really
difficult for her to communicate
with her daughter's teacher they
care so I sing
Increase the amount of Chinese
our language interpretation at
the on the O. H. and also a
education department will be
helpful for Chinese immigrants I
fully support SB three sixty
eight and thank you for your
support.
Okay thank you for your remarks
except we have a.
Mr Harmon with the New Mexico
Chinese American Association.
Some sort.
Mr Chairman my name is being in
a million and I am a member of
New Mexico ties American
Association we are annually
funded not nonprofit in
Albuquerque during the pandemic
you know we all the nice to
several fund raising and
donations to support our first
responders and also homeless
populations so once you once
more story in the beginning of
twenty seventeen what would
gentleman called me and asked me
what I can read a letter in full
he's on a very noxious he didn't
speak English at all but he knew
the local office CYFD he ended
up running thirty minutes from
the other side of the tall
greeting me a lot of food and
that wouldn't be his car from
what what in our finally called
me donations so it took me
thirty seconds to read in that
it was a notice from HSD the he
did not have to do anything the
same thing repeated twenty
eighteen twenty nineteen twenty
twenty.
So the reason for me to support
this bill is I hope you can
receive for transfer you
documentations from interesting
and also all the state agencies
so he can know what is going on
with the resource which is very
critical to him by the way he is
eighty five years old this year.
Thank you for your remarks.
The next step we have Derrick
Lynn with the New Mexico voices
for children.
Are you available Derrick.
Hearing nothing will move on to
Christine you.
Christina you.
Yes.
Good evening chairman and the
members of the committee my name
is Christina you a software
engineer and Asian Americans
from Albuquerque I'm here to
support the bill three sixty
eight the language access and
here are my reasons and my
personal experience so are the
big scale to make sure the
information on state level is
delivered on the Stuart and
respond accurately we need to
enable and further more in short
of quality of the language
access to the non English
speaking ethnic groups.
Because as we know thirty four
point one percent of the people
in New Mexico speaks no English
language and ninety four point
four percent are U. S. citizens.
And on the small scale language
excess this bill can help
encourage and and and help the
ethnic group members to be more
involved in their community
activities and to be aware and
better understand our state
budget opportunities and
responsibilities and most
importantly to make our daily
life more convenient thank you
very much.
Well thank you Christine for
your remarks.
And next up with Victoria.
Vado.
With the.
Well just mail our lesson now
hello.
The food etcetera.
Good evening chair and members
of the committee thank you for
that prettiness peak I I work
with asked me food center and
done in the county and we
strongly support SB three sixty
eight because our work to
cultivate and equitable and
sustainable food system includes
a commitment to language equity
which is a fundamental part of
the keeping equity for New
Mexicans just one example would
be families who face barriers in
accessing services like snap and
went without language access
this means there's no access for
many of our neighbors period.
Language access has always been
vital but more now than ever
with vaccination registration
healthcare pandemic related
eight unemployment benefits and
educational opportunities
please I respectfully tonight
ask that you support SB three
sixty eight thank you thank you
for your remarks Victoria we've
heard from about seventy percent
of the twenty seven people that
signed up so we that went over
our ten minute limit but this
thank everyone for their
presentations and now we'll turn
it back to us Senator Sedillo
Lopez for her concluding remarks
if you have any otherwise will
return turn now turn to the
members of the committee.
Thank thank you Mr chair total
seven of the state of the Civil
Rights Act and federal guidance
implementing that act require
interpretation when New Mexicans
need to access state services.
For programs and require
translation of documents for
language spoken when by one
thousand people four five
percent of the population
whichever is less in New Mexico
according to the department of
justice civil rights division
website those languages would be
Spanish Vietnamese Chinese and
today.
I actually think there may be
more but those that's what the
department of justice that
indicates and so this this I
think is an extremely important
assistance to the state in
complying with federal
obligations so with that
I love.
Our our presentation is complete
and we're we're available to
questions well thank you Senator
for concluding remarks and that
now you.
We're going to hear from Senator
Stefanics go ahead Senator.
Thank you Mr chair the state has
when I used to work for the
state we had a contract.
Are with a company called
It is for my money it was a
language line.
Regardless of who walk in to an
office.
That staff person could pick up
dial in one eight hundred number
get a person on the line with
the right dialect the right
language it cetera have you
checked to see whether or not
the state senator Mr chair
Garcia again with the state is
still contracting to do those
services.
Mr chair of and how much of
Madam chair but Senator
yes that is the problem and I I
don't know exactly when you work
for the state but during the
Martinez administration this was
woefully absent I believe it is
increased during the current
administration but I would like
to turn it over to my experts so
that they could give more
details but what this act does
is it requires a plan and a
language access line can be an
effective way to comply with the
obligations I I was surprised
well I'll just turn it over to
my experts okay before you your
expert talks I I was in the
experience of having
I was one of our field offices
one day when a south African
person.
Came in to try to get assistance
with.
Now in Medicaid and child
support and I watched it very
effectively being used this
language line so that's why it
came to my mind but I'm happy to
hear for experts.
Thank you well I'll turn it over
to whichever expert which the.
I would choose to answer that
question that that NEC or such.
Members of the committee.
Yes so.
That's correct HSD has in the
past implemented a language
access I am language line to
provide interpreting but as we
know from speaking to the
community it hasn't been very
effective especially during the
pandemic which is when people
need these services the most and
sometimes when I when
interpreting is provided usually
it's provided in Spanish and yes
with the language line people
would be able to get access to
interpreting four other
languages but yet the main
problem is that some agencies
sometimes of had interpreting
like HSD have had a language
line but it's not uniform across
all agencies which is really
important and this is why this
bill would hope agencies
coordinate to be able to take
advantage of exes existing
language acts are language
contracts interpreting contracts
that they can share those
resources and in that way reduce
costs.
Thank you very much for bringing
this forward Mr chair Senator
Sedillo Lopez if the bill for
some reason did not get all the
way through I think that this
would be a worthwhile
conversation to have with the
executive branch thank you Mr
chairman finished.
Thank you Senator the other
members of the committee wishing
to speak at all so thank you we
have Senator a.
The eagles so go ahead Senator.
Senator.
We wondered and I'm glad that
center.
We're talking about in Martinez
administration I know the courts
two years ago because it is in
twenty nineteen I was in the
courtroom and they had some of
the did not speak it was not
Spanish and they had a headset
that they dialed a number two
and all that interpretation came
through so are we just need to
publicize that eight hundred
number what is a problem that
all the
Department don't have access.
Thank you for that that is a
great question the courts are
separate from this and the
courts have you very strong
obligations and commitments to
provide interpretation as a
matter of access to justice
however if there's just been a
lack of coordination among the
state agencies I don't I
actually myself did the
translation for the MVD of when
the the pandemic kit just for
the the notice on the entry date
that they did that of.
That they that if they weren't
able to renew their license that
they would not get a ticket and
there was I I actually did that
translation myself I think that
if there were coordination and
access across the agencies this
would be such a benefit and it
would help the state comply with
With their obligations I do
believe that it it has
definitely been improved with
the administration I know there
is a commitment to this however
the reason I think it's
important to be in statute is so
that it's not up and down
depending on who the governor is
and so that's why this this bill
is so important and I and as I
said having a plan will help it
comply with federal law has the
FIR indicates
all the federal funds income to
CYFD and several of the agencies
require a language access plan
as a condition of federal funds
so this just gives some guidance
and some of direction to this to
the state in ensuring that those
things happen and it'll help us
comply with the federal
obligations.
Thank you for that Mister
chairman Senator Sedillo Lopez
and and I'm glad you brought up
the FIR because on the F. I. R.
first page it shows that there's
no monetary of need in FY twenty
two twenty three and twenty four
up.
It shows a three year cost so it
starts at eight under sixty four
thousand six million four
hundred and thirty thousand and
I don't understand it twenty two
cost absolutely nothing why
would it be upwards of six
million dollars in three years
Mr guns.
I am very glad you asked that
because there were no details of
for what those expenses
What those expenses would be
language access line of lines
very in the cost depending on
how many
how many of languages you choose
what kinds of plans you choose
if we were to coordinate them
across agencies I think there
would be significant cost
savings one of the things that I
think is fantastic with this
administration is this
administration has been moving
up I talked to the director of
of us focused at the state
personnel office they've been
moving to incentives or
bilingual people and so
increases in pay and those kinds
of things and that is those are
excellent plans all this bill
does is ask the agencies of for
a plan and like I said I do not
think
I did not think that the the
cost again there was no detail
about what what those costs
would be because.
Because this bill is simply
asking for a plan and of course
the implementation of a plan may
be
May cost a little bit but
certainly not this much and I
believe my expert of that NEC of
that simple quest has some
explanation about
The for as well thank you.
Mr chair members of the
committee yes it would be FY are
Those.
Has
what the analysis from DFA which
states that having creating
these language access plans in
implementing language services
will not have a significant
Fiscal impact and D. O. H. is
analysis says that it would have
a great hospital this is
precisely the thing that needs
to go into the language access
plans any estimated cost could
go into language access plan and
then it could be budgeted for
the next fiscal year so this is
why we need these plans is so
that we can coordinate and again
because they're already existing
language contracts within the
state for other agencies we can
take advantage of that by
coordinating to use the same
language contract and they
wouldn't be this huge increase
cost and a lot of the issues now
other issues that have come up
also be resolved with the the
language access plan like
training for example which some
of the times the reason why
agencies are able to use the
language line it's center is
because the staff isn't trained
but all that could go into a
language access plan.
Thank you for that in in.
This Madam Mr Chairman Senator
Lopez it I understand in earlier
testimony you're not going to
finance those are correct.
Well it is assigned to finance
however I am I didn't understand
that and it took me a little
while to figure it out
it was because of.
I was trying to make this have a
consequence for failing to do
these plans.
And
And so I took out the part that
deals with
Where is the bill I and I this
was a mistake on my part I I was
looking for a consequence so I
said with the.
The department of finance and
administration shall not grant
budget adjustment request
authority to a department that
does not submit an annual return
to that report to the governor
the legislative finance
committee and that's why it was
assigned to finance and we are
stripping that part out of the
bill I didn't understand the the
magnitude of that that
consequence.
Thank you for that part of it
but I'm looking at a magnitude
of six point four million
dollars in three years if you
Senator Munoz today this year
would be the year to implement
this not next year it shows.
The minimum eight hundred sixty
four next year to the six point
four three year cost so I I
guess I'll just a question when
we have it on the floor but my
thing is I still think in the
school of finance but I do have
another question Mr chairman and
sent chair of.
Three years ago I got to go to
trying to negotiate some
opportunities for New Mexico and
I'm wondering if technology has
changed well enough now they're
ahead of us on technology so I
went shopping I overbought
needed suitcase and I get to
talking to this lady and she
does speak English and I don't
speak Chinese so she gave me
their international handle per
phone.
So I handed her my phone she
typed into it and she spoke in
the all handed to me and it says
what would you need.
I told her luggage handed it
back to her that was a real
simple transaction took me two
more minutes then having to try
to possibly in hi my name's
David but the thing is which is
a week but it's one of those
things with technology like that
I'm wondering why we have to go
to such extreme at six point
four million dollars is there
not an app so we can do to just
If they need a certain language
that that app would accommodate
them we could work off the phone
as a sales lady in trying to do
it but I'm Mr Senator Sedillo
Lopez.
Thank you Senator Gallegos and
and Mr chair that is an
excellent point that's why I
think the FIR is so
Over the top in terms of cost
but remember this bill doesn't
require full implementation and
hiring of all translators or all
this bill does is require a plan
once these plans are are shared
among the agencies
then we can we could talk about
apps like that I'm sure I don't
know if there is an app like
that that's available easy
available but I do know about
language lines and interpreters
that are qualified and that have
the the.
The qualifications necessary I'm
not sure whether an app would
necessarily help with for
example the translation of an
application for snap benefits
and so that's why it's so
important that we have these
language plans.
And again this bill that's why I
think the FIR is just way off
because of an example that you
gave and we could discover that
if if each agency had language
plant.
Well Mr chair and representative
Center all well the what can I
I.
My biggest reason for a no today
is just the cost and and I
totally understand if there's
technology out there that would
reduce that I guess so whoever
wrote this in pretty
conservative because that six
point four really bothers me

assistance supervision.
Senator Hickey and
Representative Dixon are you.
Actor are you available.
Senator Hickey can you are you
available.
I guess I'm sorry I'm I'm this
this my apologies Mr chairman
there is a doctor in the house
and it is my pleasure to bring
you that this bill
Mr vice chairman and senators.
Senate bill three eighty three
is a relatively simple phone
bill of late and what it does is
expands the number of and this
is yes assistance who are
individuals who have training
very similar to C. R. and a in
and the seizure postgraduate
training and so forth and they
historically have had superb and
and they have on site
supervision that's different
from siRNAs so there's an
anesthesiologists always present
and previously
of the bill that granted them
license and so forth said that
there would be only a ratio of
three and this is yes assistance
to one and this is the hour just
in this bill expands that before
if you look at the bill itself
simply comes down to section one
number seven and you'll see that
it makes that change the other
piece is dropping a previous
part of the bill that the
essentially are constrained the
supervision to medical doctors
which are generally very that's
a reference to allopathic
physician and dropping that
section would allow osteopathic
physicians or anesthesiologists
to also be in the supervisory
role finally it does allow in
the practice of the read two one
four one in class B. counties
although there are no counties
currently those are small
counties there are no hospitals
that currently are large.
Nothing those counties to.
Even have an anesthesiologist
that should that happen some day
it would be helpful on the
benefits of the bill are that
early in in kind of mid size
hospitals it allows more surgery
to take place because there are
four.
And sees the allergy assistance
and also as it's very difficult
to hire siRNAs these days
it they can be an excellent
substitute for those I do have
to.
Experts with me and they are
briefly going to explained
what it is that the
anesthesiology associates does
and the value will be explained
by Andrea Santa who is the new
the chair of the and CJ
association in New Mexico we'll
start with Maryland in Maryland
I apologize if I mispronounce
your name Arjun ball and if you
could say a few words about what
it is you do and why we are
expanding what wishing to expand
to four thank you.
Thank you it's in your very
close is Archambault the very.
All right Mr chairman and
members of the committee my name
is Maryland Archambault and I'm
the president of the New Mexico
Academy of anesthesiologist
assistants I'm here to testify
in favor the Senate bill three
eight right first of all I would
like to thank you for the
opportunity to speak to you
about Senate bill three eighty
three and the practice of
an anesthesiologist assistant or
AA in the great state of New
Mexico my husband and I moved
Albuquerque New Mexico we
accepted his engineering
position at the Sandia national
out I graduated from Case
Western Reserve University with
a master's degree in medical
sciences in a speech at in
collaboration with case western
school of medicine I'm currently
in CTE all justices that
practicing at University of New
Mexico hospital in Albuquerque.
For those who may not know what
an eight is what we do allow me
to give you a brief
introduction.
All A. A.'s possessive
premedical undergraduate
background and complete and
comprehensive didactic and
clinical program at the graduate
school master's degree level for
which the atypical a a master's
program is twenty eight months I
took the impact in every single
prerequisite course required by
medical school admission and we
used to use that to go to a
masters level training program
and was training taught in most
classes by board certified
anesthesiologist.
As are trained extensively in
the delivery and maintenance of
quality Anastasia care as well
as advanced patient monitoring
techniques we understand all the
busy States pharmacology and all
other factors that can influence
and static and we ensure we
provide high quality care to our
patients.
As are very well organized and
skilled group within of advanced
practice providers who
specialize in in Setia
individually practitioners
displace draw qualities of
attention to detail
compassionate patient care team
work in extensive knowledge of
the in the season we all.
Yeah the idea of an anesthesia
care team or ACT one of the
crucial building blocks to the
foundation of the eight
profession a representative work
alongside and under the medical
direction of position indices
Alesis which creates a
productive and safe environment
for the patient working within
the anesthesia care team it
means patients will always have
to brains two sets of hands and
two sets of eyes involved in
their care.
The districts and studies have
proven time and time again the
patients receive the most
comprehensive and highest
quality are high high quality of
healthcare went in seeded team
cares for patients.
Repeat my profession is an
established profession has been
serving patients for over four
decades and has been around
since nineteen sixty eight As a
recognized by the centers of
Medicare and Medicaid services
tricare and all major commercial
insurance here's the M. S.
recognizes eighty eight as
qualified non position in future
providers currently under the a
practice As are only able to
practice under the medical
direction of an anesthesiologist
in a three eighths to one into
the office ratio our neighboring
states of Colorado and Texas as
well as well as all other states
that we practice in as eight ETS
have ratios of for EA's warnings
develop this reporter one
supervision ratio is the
national standard for eight days
currently centers of Medicare
and Medicaid services recognizes
eight and reimburses medical
direction at four to one ratio.
In the in situ Care team working
in a four to one ratio verges
affair free market in a market
that would increase competition
which is better for the consumer
your constituents and our
patients.
Increasing the ratio of two
point one one increased costs to
patients because we are already
working under any
anesthesiologists so some places
Sappey read one that we're
actually making it cheaper for
patients there working for one.
This allows practice groups in
hospitals to employ the best
providers to take care of
patients and not be forced to
hire out of necessity due to
anesthesia provider shortages
increased competition workforce
which helps to stabilize
salaries which ultimately and
most importantly decreases cost
of care.
I know that allowing aids to
practice and for the ace to one
instance allergist ratio would
encourage the health care in our
state and provide patients with
increase access to high quality
in cedar Care amending the law
to increase the ratio would
continue to uphold the high
levels of patients seek to
promote cost effective and
practice.
Yes.
Okay all right
Okay one eight the call the roll
we have a motion to pass many
please call the roll.

Infrastructure food.
Senator Campos.
Are you with us.
Mr chair of member you are you
yes I am thank you Mr chair
members of the committee in
essence up in about three fifty
two allows for we judge to sign
orders to a or other documents
from the location of the county
that is not the county seat I
may have Mr chair members of the
committee just briefly have
judge Tom
The staff who is the chairman of
the judge of probate to
affiliate affiliate and also
probate judge Dr Torrez of make
of restatements in terms of
where this piece of legislation
being brought before you thank
you Mr.
The committee substitute on this
bill.
I'm sorry wrong folder excuse
me.
Okay that's what I'm I apologize
cell phone so thank you Senator
Campos.
Are you have any of.
We have a no one signed up
against the where one person and
signed up for to judge the state
with the New Mexico probate
judges affiliate judge are you
available judge.
Yes I am.
All thank you for being welcome
to the committee and please
proceed with your remarks.
Just briefly.
Mr chair Senator.
Senator Campos thank you for
introducing this bill it's a
very simple bill the in the
current law.
Yes statute thirty four dash
seven dash five or dash for.
Says that the probate judges
will hold their courts in in the
county seat.
And what's happened is during
the pandemic is one became
pretty apparent a lot of the
judges are working from home.
And if your home just happens to
be outside the city limits.
Of of the county seat.
you're technically breaking the
law and your subject if you read
the very next that you if you
break that.
That law you're subject to a
five thousand dollar fine it
could potentially nullify all
the work done in that particular
probate.
So we're asking that the
language be changed.
To allow judges or they could
sign orders.
Outside the county seat but
still within the county the the
their their own jurisdiction.
Okay.
Thank you for your remarks and
also I would re for the forward
to judge torrez.
yes some comments to it also.
Okay your available judge yes
Sir.
Please proceed thank you thank
you well you know the US justice
tax stated you know doing this
pandemic we have found that
there are several
constituents are afraid to leave
their home areas in a lot of in
many cases Senator the counties
during this pandemic at closer
offices so is get instances like
that as judges we you know these
people had to come into our
county seat to get their
documents reviewed and signed as
opposed to you know as many
judges like justice tax stating
many judges live outside the
county seat and having to drive
the forty five mile wait or
twenty five miles away one way
to get to the county just to
sign the documents and then
taken back to their neighbor
there in the in the area for
their lady you know has created
a eight the.
A issue four for some judges as
well as were some more
constituents so by changing
these the language in this
statute gives the ability to be
able to sign the documents
outside the county seat and
better serve our constituents
and again being in.
So what just like the magistrate
and district judges being able
to sign outside the county seat
you know it gives us that
flexibility as well.
Okay thank you for the.
Your remarks.
Any close comments Senator
Campos before we move on to the
committee thank you Mr chairman
I believe that the judges
explained it very well thank you
okay thank you Senator
any of.
Many members wishing to the
speaker and the Senate bill

I see Senator a the cannot go
ahead please thank you Mr
chairman I will do passed on as
the three fifty two.
Thank you at the center.
Question Mr yeah go ahead
senator please so Mister
chairman Senator just wondering
does this and I I didn't see a
sunset on it being that this is
done due to the pandemic when
the pandemic is seized in and
over with do they go back to the
standard is this from now on Mr
chairman and senator gray goes
this will be from this point
forward
part of the issue of course was
caused during the pandemic but
this is an where an issue
particularly in some of the more
rural areas that were outside of
the county C. as an example in
San Miguel County where they
would go to been aware of for
some of the elders are not able
to our to make their way into
the community so it would be
something that would be on point
if this was to be a yes.
Law thank you Mr chairman thank
you Mr center that's all I had
and just wondering if we miss
that but it was not the intent
legislation I'll be ready to
vote thank you.
Thank you senator are we have a

Thank you penny as.
Senator Campos you have a do
pass thank you for joining us
this evening next up we have
Senator but the US Senate bill
three eighty eight the proceeds
for electronic documents go
ahead Senator.
You Mr.
Thank you Mr chairman and
members of the committee another
riveting a committee meeting
thank you I learned so much
every time I'm waiting here to
present I literally do learn a
lot so thank you Senate bill
three day we do have a
some for you just to make sure
that the bill is nice and clean
because we made some pretty
significant changes waiting to
be heard so you should already
have that it was in the analysis
that and the and the actual so
was forwarded to you on the
documents were sent in do you
have that Mr Chairman.
Is what three eighty eight to
leave a charter does Terry can
you put it up please.
What he's doing that Mr chairman
I just want to make sure that my
expert witness is available with
your permission is name is Matt
Baca from the attorney general's
office Mr block are you present.
Mr chair Senator yes I'm here
thank you Mr chairman I would
start by saying that this is a
simple bill which I firmly
believe it is but but we just we
we made a significant change
from the original bill
essentially the Attorney General
approached me on letting the
sunshine in and and and you know
our our our quest to drive
transparency you know here in
state government and the reason
I say that is they wanted to
lower the fees with regard to
paper copies for it front
requests your presence as well
as the elective electronic CD
versions of your program quest
in the the requests for the
order of that we re developed
before we had this hearing the
substitute the the attorney
general's office came forward
and asked me just let's go ahead
just take all the fees away you
know in total and so that's what
the sun does so if you want to
before we start with with the
sub in any further discussion on
the side if you want to just
move that I guess so that we can
consider the sub.
Okay
So okay so that we good start.
I'm.
Yes it's essentially the bill I
mean I don't want to take any
more the committee's time that
we actually have to but
essentially so the substitute
for Senate bill three eighty
eight let's all the sunshine in
a makes it incredibly easy to
submit and current quest and get
your documents put together and
and and shipped out to you the
cost involved would be and I'm
gonna ask Mr Baca talk a little
bit about that but that would be
borne by the various agencies
that received the requests
they don't believe that the
request that the cost is going
to be exorbitant so Mister
Walker can you talk just a
little bit about that on why we
chose to just eliminate fees
altogether.
It certainly at Mr chair and
senator I think the if you look
at the purpose of the policy
purpose that stated in a bread
today it says that all persons
are entitled to the greatest
information possible and that
it's also the policy of the
state that providing this
information is the routine duty
of public officers and employees
so I think that you know for
from a policy level the idea is
if people are entitled to it
than having to pay for something
that is public to begin with is
is antithetical or or outbreak
contrary to the statement about
entitlement.
Then with respect to the cost of
it you know I think it's
important that public agencies
be supported from the attorney
general's perspective that those
agencies be supported in their
budgets and that that
transparency is funded in that
way but again when you look at
the the sort of purpose not sort
of purpose the purpose stated in
that in the act.
It the legislature has already
decided that this is part of the
routine duty as a public officer
an employee so while there are
costs certainly born to agencies
in terms of employee time and
and supplies and things like
that that that there's no doubt
in that you know I think it is
that the office the attorney
general's perspective that that
really it's it's incumbent upon
those agencies to bear those
costs and not pass them on to
the tax payer or to the person
asking for the information I
should say so Mr chair Senator
Padilla I I think that could
secure point thank you Mr
chairman and so if you look at
page two and and
I think it's that concludes on
of the third page we simply
strike out anything that calls
for the cost of the program and
it was pretty outrageous Mr
chairman before I mean it was a
dollar a page you.
Fees associated with electronic
CD copies all that business and
and that now it simply R. zero
set out in in future years
departments agencies whatever
can come forward and and ask for
whatever it is that they believe
their their their expenses are
on this and and then that'll get
ironed out over time with the
sole costs thank you Mr chairman
that's our that's our
presentation.
Thank you thank you senator
We will now move on to we have
three people signed up to speak
against the bill.
First we have Melanie majors in
New Mexico foundation for open
for open government Melanie
please proceed.
What Senator are common and Mr
chairman and members of the
committee Melanie majors
executive director of the New
Mexico foundation for open
government and we support this
bill.
Thanks Senator Padilla for
working towards bringing some
more sunshine to New Mexico and
promoting transparency in
government especially as we
prepare to celebrate St
beginning Sunday democracy
depends on the informed and
active participation of all
citizens at all levels of
government the biggest barrier
to public record is high fees
and it's important fees do not
discourage the public from
asking for information what we
want this bill to do things a
lot related fee is for agencies
to start feeling they can create
their own right she and short we
don't want the law to say we
can't charge a fee so we're
gonna stick with the old one
dollar page it would be much
clearer if the bill use the
specific words shall not charge
we ask that this cover all
records including data and meta
data files I encourage you to
approve this bill and more
sunshine into the state of New
Mexico and I thank you for your
time today.
Thank you Mr major so I
apologize a list that was a
given me indicated you were.
Against it so.
We have sent me Lopez can I
assume that you are supporting
the bill and that against it Mr
Lopez go ahead yes absolutely
thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee my name is sandy
Lopez I'm the executive director
of the New Mexico press
association I represent thirty
eight weekly and daily
newspapers with print readership
of seven hundred seventy six
thousand print readers in on an
online readership of over
million New Mexicans I'm a
native New Mexican growing up
and on a farm in her Alice State
the publisher New Mexico most of
my career as publisher in fort
Sumner Deming Prideaux so bland
Carlsbad Los crucis in
Farmington I'm here to at today
to ask the committee to vote yes
on the amended Senate bill three
eighty eight vote for this bill
is a vote for democracy allowing
public access to public records
that include low income New
Mexicans.
Public employees are paid by the
public in additional fees should
not be charged for making copies
of public records I hope some
day these records would be on
city police county state and
school websites eliminating the
need for public records request
thank you Mr chairman and
members of the committee.
Thank you Mr Lopez for your
remarks next up we have Maryland
back on with us.
Hearing nothing we will.
Now move to the committee.
Thank you many members wishing
to speak I see three hands up
the.
I don't know who is first but
discussed arbitrarily called on
senators to finance go ahead.
Thank you Mr chair of thank you
senator in the past when we have
looked at it for a.
We have discussed the situation
when.
Out of state.
Corporations go trolling.
For information from our county
clerks are county assessors.
And these can be thousands and
thousands of records.
And even download what the
request is can take half a day a
whole day which is the
equivalent of a staff salary
where could you comment on how
that relates to your bill.
Mister chairman Senator it
relates exactly how you you put
it I mean it it it it it it's
very difficult to find a way to.
It's very difficult to find a
way to to.
To discriminate against one
group versus the other and and
so we just thought we would open
up you know this thing wide open
Mr Baca if you would like to
comment on that.
absolutely Mister chairman
Senator Padilla I I think
Senator Padilla articulated the
broad policy perfectly I would
also point out Mr chair and
senator step on X. things that
are public record that it's in a
in a clerk's office is not often
being requested subject to the
inspection of public records act
so I think you're also there is
some new ones there and the
difference in the way that those
records are accessed because a
county clerk's function is
specifically to have open rules
and records for people to search
so I I think there is some
difference there in the
application of the bill to that
context.
While I appreciate Mr chair your
experts comments but apparently
Mr Bach is not aware of all the
exploitation of seniors that's
going on in our state and
exactly how they get it is going
to the county clerk's office and
asking for the entire voter roll
with all of the descriptors and
R. H.
our addresses it our phone
numbers and this is a problem
are we have some small counties
but we have some very large
counties.
And this happened quite a bit
one I was the Santa Fe county
commissioner and I'm sure and
that's been quite a while now
but I'm sure it's still
continuing so I have some
reservations about saying Kirk
Blunck you can have access to a
hundred sixty thousand records
just because you're asking for
them and we'll provide them free
of charge to all listen to the
rest of the disk discussion
requesting information on a case
on
for ten.
Similar kinds of things is quite
a bit different than asking for
an entire
massive.
Block of information thank you
Mr chair.
Thank you Sir thank you.
Next up we have a Senator of.
I giggles.
Mr chairman and senator but yes
thank you for the discussion and
I'm sure your expert witness
well now the name Nick Maxwell
he's from Lee County and he is
always on.
It
always looking for it for
information but Mr chair and
etcetera this has nothing to do
with the time delay I know
during
COVID it was really hard to get
anything from but most
apartments I mean it everyone
working from home but with what
you're doing is just traditional
the cost but not doing anything
with the time that it takes to
receive their prize Act correct
Mister chair Mister chairman
Senator Gallegos you you're
you're absolutely correct the
way you put it on we we don't
we're not touching the process
itself this is simply the access
to the the requested information
and it's not you know I just
want to make this clear it's not
reducing the constants
eliminating the cost just to
make that the sunshine Roelandts
and tell the passionate rolling
to help people see what they're
what they're looking looking for
some.
Thank you Mr chairman Senator
actually enjoy this this young
man's a look at my record from
school board house and Senate
and every time he asked for
information I give it to and it
satisfies him other other people
is not a satisfied with but I
think it's one of those things
we owe to the public so I
appreciate the dialogue thank
you for bringing this bill
forward Mr young.
Thank you senator next up we
have a Senator McKenna go ahead
Senator.
Thank you chairman and thank you
Senator Padilla or disengaging
legislation conversation.
I am a big proponent of.
Open government in the context
of this bill however I'm
concerned about unintended
consequences.
And I'm wondering for instance.
Those that worked on worked on
this legislation considered.
Using a.
Income.
Income eligible request income
eligible process for the request
here I'm simply concerned about
something like this.
Being free being X. exploited.
I'm something similar to what's
our senators to phonics said
and then separately chairman and
senator I'm curious if the.
Those that would be providing
this information intended to
track.
The expenses for both labor and.
Thank posted sh.
Paper and the like thank you.
Mister chairman Senator McKenna
on item number one I'm gonna
have to defer to my experts but
I don't believe there was an
income
when I had discussions with them
about carrying the legislation
there there was no discussion
about income eligibility for for
for your waves cost or whatever
so I mean I'll just throw that
out there on item number two
you know the legislation doesn't
call out we need you to tell us
how much it cost you to do this
but just like anything else we
do in you know one in state
government are expected the
department I'm assuming that
these that we will hear about
this and future budget requests
and and roll up next request
what have you when it's
understood exactly what these
types of costs will be so I
would imagine in subsequent
years you'll see a department or
two or ten or seventy.
Show up and say we need another
seventeen hundred dollars to do
this thing or we need four
hundred dollars or we need
seventeen thousand dollars I don
this I I I I can't tell you that
right now but I'm assuming that
that's how this will.
We've its way into it's a state
government that Mr Baca with
your permission Mister chairman
Senator McKenna would you
comment Mr Baca outside when I
sit.
Absolutely Mr chair and senator
with respect to the
income eligibility I think the
idea of being of by stripping
any any cost for a public
records request there wouldn't
necessarily be a need to
differentiate between an income
eligible person because there's
not nothing to column
effectively but perhaps I'm
misunderstanding the question Mr
chair it if you.
Senator McKenna does that sound
like I'm getting after what
you're asking there.
Thank you chairman and Mr Baca
so each yep my concern is and
I'm I'm pardon my use of free
for all.
But I'm I'm I'm simply concerned
about certain organizations
exploiting.
how they can get this
information for free and these
are organizations or individuals
could be very well to do.
And have reason for the
information that are not
straight up.
I'm so that's my concern about
The income verification and the
types of requests I I really
applaud.
I'm not charging folks who can't
afford it.
But that's that's my concern
about this legislation is that
actors
driving a truck through it
because the law says they can.
You Mr chairman and senator Mr
block if you want to respond
also but you know what the at
the end of the day we don't
touch the the process itself Mr
chairman Senator McKenna so you
still need to given all the
information that you have to
find today with the you're
paying for the documents are not
so we we will know who you are
and and and and what you request
and and how that you know is is
rolled out with which use the
information for it's possible to
just like today organizations
that do have the dollars as you
mention to to pick up in all of
these these documents and and
what they do with that we find
out very quickly what they're
doing otherwise we would have
this very discussion that we're
having right now Mr market you
want to respond to that and then
also on the second portion of
senator McCain is response your
question is used.
yes absolutely Mr chair and
senator you know I think it's
important to remember that under
the the existing law under it
but a public agency is not
allowed to ask.
someone requesting records what
the purpose of the request is
and I think that's for a sound
policy the reason that as a
default we don't it doesn't
really matter why the person
once public information because
it is public information so I
think you know from our
perspective with that sort of
that broad brush.
Your you might have some people
that will use the information
negatively but that is.
A small price to pay for that
broad access and force public
agency not having to make a
declare and put on a case as to
why they want something that
belongs to the public so
I think that's just a very
important contacts the state you
know the purpose of the law as
it exists today absent these
changes doesn't allow for the
parsing of who is asking and and
sort of why they're asking for
it
and then with respect to what I
think maybe is the suggestion
that if if you can afford to pay
for it that perhaps we should
screen your motives
by by asking you to show that
you should be able to pay for it
again I think it would be
difficult to create a policy
that would effectively
differentiate state a reporter
from The New York Times which is
a publicly traded company is
asking for information that's
critical for a story then you
would be judging the fact that a
multi billion dollar company is
asking for that information and
so would be really hard to sort
of crafted technical policy that
would say well that's okay in
this instance but if you are
perceived to be nefarious
then then we would charge you
for the records or or sort of
impute a higher standard.
Thank you chairman and senator
and Mr Baca I think.
My inquiry are two separate.
Issues here so the the various
being one but the state The New
York Times they can afford to
pay.
They can afford to pay for.
the time that it takes for for a
staff member to collect.
More.
And ship the information they
want.
I and I'm not even touching
their their motives right they
can afford it I'm just I'm just
really concerned and I don't and
I don't know it.
you know the the administrative
office of courts and those that
have these records if they even
plan to track the costs and
report it.
Mr chairman and senator there is
no requirement of the
legislation to report how much
it cost you to provide the
documentation so I'll just just
make it real clear I'm sorry the
substitute that we gave you
well as I mentioned I'm assuming
that they will internally do
that so that they can right size
their budget if it's if it's an
impact to their budget of any
kind.
Thank you chairman thank you
senator thank you Mr Baca.
Thank you.
Okay thank you Senator next up
we have a Senator.
Participar you have a question
Senator thank you Mr chairman
was do we have any amendments on
this bill.
Thank you Mr chairman Mr
chairman no I brought you a
substitute to clean it up on
what the original bill called
for you which will call for
reduced fees Mr Chairman and Mr
chairman of the sub eliminated
the fees all together at for the
request of the attorney
general's office who brought
this to me.
So we are considering to one
eighty seven oh eight point one.
I will double check that is that
the the this doesn't say stop at
the top.
No that's not it let me let me I
I I'm a looks I will I.
Your committee.
On the screen for us before you
join us again Mr chairman.
Question really has to do with
an issue that was raised in the
in the R. that's why are you
managing in the south we had to
do with that
on page three the actual cost is
not include labor costs or
overhead costs.
The.
Administrative office records in
the commission of public
records.
Commented that she resents.
No need to say overhead costs
because the state labor costs as
really saying the same thing so
I was removed and then and then
to taking care of that in the in
your services you don't need to
print.
Since I'm seeing some you Mr
chairman I am with the display
the son of a few moments ago yes
if Trevor it with your
permission of Trevor at back up
so everybody can see it please.
Sunshine in that's that's what
legislation thank you Mr
chairman I'm fine thank you
senator thank you Sir.
Okay what else
Senators thank you have a yes
I'm quite.
Thank you Mr chair besides the
simple I used before going to
the county clerk's office and
asking for a hundred sixty
thousand records of something
The other thing that came to my
mind as I was listening to
everybody is that at.
And I'm getting you Santa Fe
County is an example.
All right custodian for brought
in all records ended up being a
staff attorney.
And often times they had to redo
Act.
Or determine what was
appropriate to release.
We take them away from.
Their legal duties.
No I don't think this is just a
question of saying.
Ramp up the budget ramp up the
staffing and I still will remain
to have concerns but thank you
very much.
When Mr chairman incentives to
panic so I hear you loud and
clear but you know that that
attorney that that public
records requests
Process owner in that office as
doing that today and they would
be doing that tomorrow also one
from a reduction standpoint.
Thank you Mr chairman.

very much for the conversation
thank you thank you thank you Mr
chairman.
Thank you everyone thank you
senator congratulations on your
two passed and now we'll turn it
over to
Chairman that O. G.'s of penal.
Thank you Mr chairman.
If you continue insuring the
meeting I I'd like to present
this bill so my expert witnesses
don't have answers your okay
nine next so next up percent
three ninety three vibrant
communities out of sponsored by
Senator Ortiz you know go ahead
Senator.
Mr chairman and members of the
committee we realize that this
late in the session is highly
unlikely either.
Hello.
In the Senate version would have
a chance to move all the way
across but we still wanted to
make a presentation tonight to
help you understand.
The issue underlying this bill
but what we're dealing with here
is the result of the group that
met through the internet.
informally there wasn't a task
force created by the legislature
anything Representative.
All the other by my
extraordinary support marriage
Working with.
There are nonprofit just trying
to find ways in which we might
be here at how to deal with the
thank you donations laws
basically.
We know that there is a
constitutional amendment has
been proposed to change that and
we know we've also proposing
constitutional amendments to
certain.
Measures of this bill.
We've been trying to work around
the issues that make it so
difficult for nonprofits which
basically didn't exist when the
state constitution was created
there was no there was no such
thing as a nonprofit in nineteen
twelve.
When the state constitution
passes prohibition against
public money going to.
Right right organizations they
were talking about businesses
real roots mining companies
things like that.
Ten years we've we've developed
a whole country of non profits
that serve the public good.
This will hungry the homeless
the
mentally ill the mentally
disabled in various ways the the
lane the halls the lepers all of
that we serve to learn projects.
Most state departments now in
this state contractor these
nonprofits to provide services
as long as they're contracting
there is no violation the NCO
nation because there are times.
For example capital but also
sometimes when when a learned
profit is doing something that
no state department this you
have to do that we might want to
send the money directly to the
nonprofit for a specific purpose
in the end you know nation costs
close Rubens from happening.
See we've come up with senator
Morris workarounds you know
that.
When we want to happen we have
to give it to the department of
finance and administration local
government division we're saying
here's to the Bernalillo county
are we send.
Retains ownership of the
vehicles for the new building
that was put on the homeless
shelter or whatever.
It's a very very Byzantine
Goldberg in approach to getting
money into the into the into the
services for the people in the
service Senator has endorsed
this approach and I would like
to turn it over to my
angst expert witness support
manage who's who's worked so
hard on pulling this together
and later explained to build us.
Mr chair.
And members of the committee can
you hear me first of all.
Yes your your audible okay
terrific thank you very much
what the vibrant communities act
does is it provides a framework
for nonprofits and other
community entities serving the
public good just the same way
that leader does for businesses.
And in fact the vibrant
communities act was modeled
after LEED.
It takes a it takes the state
from a reactive stance so the
first exception to the anti
donation clause is for care and
maintenance of the sick and
indigent to a proactive stance
we're by
the state can invest in projects
that are for the public good
they serve a public purpose and
promote health and
selfsufficiency and well being.
And the other thing this bill
does is it takes out what forty
six other states have done by
court rulings because forty six
other states have anti donation
are anti gift clauses.
So what they have done by court
rulings this will do by statute.
And it cleans up the whole
process of capital outlay of
different organizations
approaching legislators asking
for money it creates a framework
and whatever entity is were
requesting money has to go
through a process they have to
show the public purpose they
have to
Find a lot of information and be
vetted.
And we have had discussions with
of the New Mexico counties
association with the burning
Bernalillo county.
Chief of staff and with DFA
about the process.
And so they have all had input.
Into the vibrant communities
act.
In the other thing that this
does is promote equity so if you
are a for profit corporation you
can hire a lawyer to work around
the anti donation clause.
And only the largest of the
nonprofits can afford to do
something like that the small
ones have no idea when they hear
that when they hear no because
it's a violation of the anti
donation clause.
They take it as a firm now.
This is a way to help smaller
counties and communities to have
limited access to resources to
have a better chance of gaining
access.
And with that I will be
available for questions thank
you.
Thank you for your.
Presentation this.
Any comments that senator before
we move on to.
Discussion.
Mr chairman I do believe that
there are some people.
Yes leases signed up to have
public comment on this.
Thank you yeah I was going to
give you an opportunity to speak
before we moved on to the people
of this no one signed up for.
An opposition we have five
individuals wishing to speak in
support the first one is and
lily and the television.
Who is with the executive
director New Mexico First side
please go ahead.
Chairman Tom then members of the
committee and sponsor TCP no
thank you so much for taking
time to consider Senate bills of
three ninety three at New Mexico
first we've had town halls going
back over decades where anti
donation clause issues have come
up and it's a real quandary
because we understand the
importance of nonprofit
organizations in terms of
pivoting and responding to
community needs and ways that
are sometimes more deaths than
larger systems and and yet at
the same time you were also an
organization it's deeply
committed to good governance and
so one of the things that the
vibrant communities act does is
particularly in section seventy
weren't really outlines areas of
accountability so we're able to
both do the things that are
important that agency that issue
described in terms of the
strength based proactive
approach but in a way that
continues to protect protect the
public interest and the fair
distribution of resources in a
way that's highly accountable
and at the same time making sure
to create access to
opportunities and a more fair
and equitable way for these
reasons we really think this is
a strong approach to addressing
the anti donation clause and
encourage folks to consider it
and given what
chairman Senator Ortiz Pino was
saying about timing I'm
wondering if there may be some
ways to use the thinking in this
legislation to maybe strengthen
our own hands other proposals
that are before the body.
Thank you so much.
For your markets I think we have
a Schardin Berman with Mexico
first go ahead share.
Sure and I would kind of trading
off to see who committed tonight
sorry Sir she's not here right.
makes the we have a.
Someone from the New Mexico
thrives and I'm just.
it is Mr chairman so for an
average.
okay I had to leave the.
Room for a minute next up we
have the Tory
K. Q. Q. the the thank all
Victoria you available.
I yes thank you madam chair and
members of the committee thank
you for this opportunity right
find another Madam chair track
about the with us if with center
we support SB three ninety three
because too often in rural areas
like Anthony when we farm the
anti donation clause prevents
community that improvements and
innovative economic development.
It's applied unfairly and
inconsistently from preventing
Townsend from renovating
abandoned buildings for use
their older centers to not
allowing community centers to
plant gardens because water
costs would violate the clause
in the donation because must be
amended to allow the state to
invest in life affirming
projects the increase quality of
life and faster economic
resiliency.
Three ninety three with prevent
circular nonsensical hurls from
being put in between New
Mexicans and our safety and the
ability of our communities to
reach our full potential would
allow investment in projects
that are in the interest of
health economic development and
well being I respectfully ask
for the committee support
tonight press B. three ninety
three thank you.
Thank you for your remarks.
And the last person on the list
is shown.
Hey mark with the New Mexico
rural library initiative.
Chairman and members the
committee thank you for letting
me speak about this there are
fifteen five oh one see three
libraries in the state of New
Mexico they're all public
libraries asked by the New
Mexico state library they give
free services just like
libraries in Bernalillo where
Albuquerque a provide free
internet children's programming
and stuff like that they are I
a one C. threes because they are
ending the diligence throughout
the state their library copy
time the and we have LFC retail
added to Dixon
I'm twenty co and several others
so many of the five oh one see
three libraries are really
desperate for infrastructure
repair the library said happy
time in the end we have a are
they close extra hours during
the winter because they don't
have adequate insulation the
roof leaks that Villanueva
to the library in.
The state recently got a toilet
but they still don't have a sink
in the bathroom the ex five
children who go to school there
every day because they're the
only internet in town so
it's just really vital that.
The anti donation clause be it
to support.
Public institutions like this I
thank you so much for your
consideration thank you Mr name
are free for your landmarks.
that's not over we heard from
everyone who signed up thank you
many closing remarks Mr chair.
Yes Mr chairman thank you so so
what we would propose is laid
out and starting on page three
is is is a way in which non
profits good.
Submit proposals to the
department of finance
administration.
Department of finance and
administration would designate
one of the state executive
departments will be appropriated
for libraries in might be the
state librarian or for for of
us and me so then I knew
agriculture some of the
department that we work with
them to come up with a the
proposal are project
application.
Then it would be evaluated by
that department to see whether
or not it was it was appropriate
and and that would then put it
on a list for possible funding
of the legislature agree so
that's
simply makes it possible for
nonprofits to participate.
Much more directly with the
capital outlay.
Process of the state than they
do now where they have to route
regions through local government
online.
That will send professions.
Okay thank you Mr chair anyone
of first up we have the Senator
of.
The funding to those like to us
speak go ahead
I think this is highly needed
and I have several entities
in the same situation I have a
little community center that
will they inherited from the
public school that's on a land
grant and nobody can receive the
money and take responsibility
because there's three entities
with some ownership so thank you
senator Ortiz.
Thank you senator anyone any
other number wishing to speak I
don't see any other hands up
past motion.
So I have a quick question.
For a Senator of Mr chair are
we.
We amending the sister amending
the.
Constitution this week.
Have to go to the voters.
Mr Chairman because Jules
amendment that would make this
bill operative word and we
haven't prepared one.
Probably a hearing this the
session.
Where is.
June twenty four hi I just read
it is red and yes Senator
resolution twenty four just two
separate thank you yeah thank
you senator okay what's the
wishes of the of the committee.

So congratulations Senator you
have a do pass and now we are
going to hear from us Senator
Schmedes go ahead Senator thank
you very much Mr chair and
Senator Ortiz Pena
I want to know because
You know I I I would like to see
this bill to be a little tighter
and to establish
But just a little bit more of
for restricted framework for
page five oh one C. threes would
qualify.
there are some C. threes that in
my opinion I think kind of take
advantage of our.
Very very growing just not
nonprofit.
Entity and I think we've kind of
lost the original purpose of of
charitable five one C. threes
and
so so I'd like to rein it in for
these types of in in the types
of great nonprofits that they
gave testimony today you know
these these library situations
and.
All the
contribute to.
you know.
Homelessness and things like
that but they're you know that
just because an entity is a
nonprofit doesn't mean.
It always has.
You know charitable motives and
and those sorts of things
and so if if this got a little
tighter I would be very happy to
to support it thank you Mr
chair.
Thank you senator and
Thank concludes.
The this is this bill and Mr
chair you wish to take over you
I mean continue.
The takeover Senator thank you
thanks for doing such a good job
thank you.
Thank you senator the.
Senator pope with the Senate
bill three ninety six while and
while land prices.
You Mr chairman and committee
members Senate bill three ninety
six wildland arson as wide a lot
why don't know wild land to the
list of locations are structures
such as buildings bridges and
signs to which a person
maliciously sets a fire a
recklessly causes a fire or
explosion.
And is punishable by new
penalties made in section three
zero dash one seven dash five
NMSA nineteen seventy eight
these no penalties depend on the
monetary value of destroyed
property wildland is defined to
be endorsed or stream sideline.
Land that in interface between
urban and other wildland
rangeland recreation land or any
other land at risk or wildfire
of wildfire.
Senate bill three ninety six
makes modifications to page two
of section thirty dash seventeen
dash six.
Dealing with aggravated arson.
Adding setting wild wildlife
fires.
Including repeat offenders
within the previous ten years or
using an XLR in or down or
delaying device to ignite a
fire.
Activated arson is handled all
is also handled as a second
degree felony Mr chair committee
members I have to experts here
on zoom I have captain Alberto
Ortega and captain Ramon
Martinez both of Albuquerque
Albuquerque fire and rescue and
I would like to give captain
Ramon Martinez an opportunity to
talk about why we need this
legislation.
Thank you senator.
In Martinez.
Chairman thank you senators
thanks for having me today
the legislation that that they
you have before you is simply
protecting.
Every piece of vegetation in
every one of our communities
everyone of your communities
that right now is not fall under
federal or state land federal
and state lands are protected
however anything that falls
outside of that is not protect
it so if you do have a fire that
burns vegetation without burning
as as read before a structure of
a structure of vehicle FINS the
telephone line and I cannot
assign a monetary value to that
there's no there's there's not a
charge as the statue reads
currently so what we're trying
to do is introduce that to say
if I go and intentionally start
your vegetation on your property
on fire that I can actually have
a charge and hold somebody
accountable for.
As far as the aggravated arson
is concerned.
I believe we Kelly two birds
with one stone here by adding
while led to it because we're
gonna be able to now charge
somebody with the offense of
lighting Wilander wildfires
intentionally but now we're
going to be able to keep track
of these people and hold them
accountable for doing this
repeatedly
and and the second to the second
edition letter C. is the use of
a device designed to X.
celebrate the fire or delay the
fire's ignition which spaces
specifically targets our first
responders we have run into this
instance before where we show up
on seeing that we find a device
that was lay there as either a
trigger to ignite when we got
there or as we were actively
fighting the fire that's a
malicious act act and when we
find and are able to identify
this we are looking to be able
to charge the person with the
with the offense thank you.
Thank you.
Then we'll go to a mandatory.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
and members of the committee my
name is Albert gore they got I
captain Alfred by rescue and a
nineteen year veteran of the
fire service
to be briefly just on behalf of
Albuquerque fire rescue
firefighters across the state
and our farmers office we stand
strong support of this
legislation and what we do so
urge your support as well with
that so we will stand for
questions and we thank you for
your in this.
Follow up question to your
attention the currently now
these days without this bill
yeah somebody starts a fire in
the more scary in Albuquerque.
Is there nothing that they can
be charged with.
I'll be happy to answer that in
the same question the simple
answer is no there's not there's
fires that are lit in the bus
gate all the time that we go out
we can identify the offender and
the simple charge that we are
allowed to do is negligent use
of fire a misdemeanor sometimes
we're burning acres down and
sooner or later I mean there
there's so many different
activities dangers to people
that are in the mosque at the
dollar value that that was given
brings Talbot Ricky much less
from Colorado to Mexico is is
it's a Norma's and especially in
the Albuquerque area no Sir we
are not currently a lot of
there's not a charge the way the
statue reads we've we've busted
many of people that on the bus
get doing that subjectivity and
we are hand cook because as the
bill reads right now.
Okay thank you to look at and
say a few summers Senator told
any other concluding remarks.
Mr chair I just wanted to add
and that was really you know why
we're we're bringing this
legislation forward you know
there's been some summers where
there's just mills fire set the
ball state and we just need to
do something to all these folks
accountable and try to deter
them from doing this in the
future with that being said Mr
chair committee members we're
ready for public comment and any
other questions.
Is there anybody you know what
we don't have anybody else
signed up ahead of time for
public comment but is there
anyone else in the room who
wants to make sure commented so
please use your reaction about
race and.
Okay seeing none will go to the
committee senators for that
excuse are.
Thank you Mr chair and as thank
you senator program.
So your bill Senator
appropriates the new County is
that correct.
that it that is correct Mr chair
Senator finance.
Mr chair
According to the analyses.
This could affect a person.
Who could excel around on a
campfire and it quickly spreads
and.
I think that the consequences of
a felony I'm changing a person's
life.
Is very serious and for that
reason I will not be able to
support it thank you very much.
Is there any other discussion of
the bill.
Mr chair I'm wondering if I
could just have
Captain Martinez just talk about
I guess a specifics and you
actually result in the felony.
But.
Yes chairman thank you thank you
for allowing me to answer the.
The the question that was raised
is if I do use an excel and I
use lighter fluid I use charcoal
fluid how what have you to light
a campfire is not an intentional
use to maliciously or willfully
start a fire that causes an
explosion with the purpose of
destroying or damaging so we're
just just for that fact we we
are not willfully tried to
destroy or damage any property
of any kind I'm trying to light
a campfire because I'm cold and
my kids are over your crop and
in doing whatever they're doing
so the the intent which is
already in the statute as it
currently reads is there and it
specifically says will fully.
Starting a fire or causing an
explosion with the purpose of
destroying or damaging so all
we're trying to do is include
the Burbage of wildland into
that and and not that.
The the simple would not fall
under one of our charges.
Mr chair Senator I understand
the explanation so what happens
to a person who has a mental
illness or mental health problem
that continues to set fires.
Okay we thank you this is a
captain Martinez we recently
just ran into this incident and
the gentleman that we were
dealing with had been lighting
fires along the bus came in the
downtown area of Albuquerque and
he had upwards of fifty
different intentional fire sets.
Okay this was no a mental mental
history patient and we dealt
with him over the course of the
last about ten years that I've
been in our in a fire
investigations and now he has
been committed to Las Vegas New
Mexico so with us being able to
follow an individual and say
okay you have been lighting you
we're doing our due diligence by
keeping good records working
with the DA's office and and and
following these individuals
because it is a sickness and it
needs to be a taking care of the
somebody intentionally starts
fires at the you know you need
to be held accountable.
I thank you Mr chair.
Thank you senator okay we have
several other comments from
committee Senator Gallegos
you're next.
Thank you Mr and I was just
wondering what this does all of
my computer falsely
with.
I know the commissioner of
public lands that upwards of
nine to nine million acres they
have that they care for what
happens if there's a fire on
their land do you guys again
intercede or is it a joint
venture this trying to figure
out how this works.
Mr chair Senator guy also like
to defer that to have to
Martinez.
Thank you currently right now
the only fires that we are able
to file any charges on are going
to be on anything that is not
state or federal land both of
those different divisions have
their own charges on them so
I hope that answers your
question we're we're not
touching any of those state or
federal lands.
It does and and that's where I
was going with this because I
knew they had other obligations
are the way they looked at the
buyers and other restrictions
they haven't penalty so that's
my only question I just wanted
to make sure that
Federal statements thank you Mr
thank you senator next we have
Senator McKenna followed by
Senator committees and senators
all the.
Thank you chairman and thank you
Senator pope and our subject
matter experts are firefighters.
chairman and.
Senator.
Am I understanding correctly
that.
Currently if someone.
That's that's the same type of
fire her that's it is described.
Suicide forest National Forest
property.
That they would get the same.
punishment that.
Is is per
Is being asked here in this in
this bill.
Mr chair Senator McKenna I do
not know I know that there are
their own they have their own
statutes cover Martinez could
you.
How we would absolutely be happy
to there's no there's different
charges Senator of the the feds
use their own charges that
they're allowed to charge for
fires on federal land so if this
individual went and did
intentionally light a fire on
federal land which is on the
other side of the fence from
open space here in Albuquerque
they would have a charge of the
fire started on their side of
the fence and destroyed two
thousand acres if the fire
started on our side of the fence
we would not be we would not
have the charges as a statute
currently reads to to go ahead
and go after that individual for
the same fire.
And and and and Mr chair Senator
McKenna and it goes back to what
we stated from the beginning
unless it burned a structure or
building or something like that
and that that that's the way the
lies right now that that is what
we need to be charged.
Okay thank you chairman and
senator so.
What is the federal charge for
setting of fire on.
Federal lands that burned.
A significant amount of acreage.
I I don't have the federal the
federal document in front of me
I apologize for that but I've
never been able to use it so it
but I don't have that.
Thank you thank you chairman and
senator and the reason why I
asked Mr Martinez is because I
am trying to understand.
How will this bill lands on a.
let's see second degree felony.
Senator that that it's not
automatically going to go to a
second degree felony depending
on the dollar value charge there
we we have a you know for their
degree second degree first
degree felonies based upon
dollar value if it's anything
between two hundred and fifty
dollars and five hundred dollars
worth of damage that's going to
be a misdemeanor charge so if it
is a small farger it's a small
campfire that gets out of hand
we're still able to charge
something for that example not
at not not a campfire but if you
do let a small fire in our
cruise show up and we knock it
out and there's little damage or
nothing to do there it could be
a misdemeanor charge but at
least we're gonna be able to
hold the individuals accountable
for force lighting these fires
it said individual did
intentionally light a large area
on fire and did cause quite a
bit of damage then you could
find yourself in the second
degree felony if the dollar
value match the existing
language that's already there to
go over the twenty thousand
dollars.
Okay thank you chairman and
senator and.
I would have.
More comfort Mr Martinez if for
instance.
The punishment for the federal
lands.
What was used as the basis for
this legislation I I I'm simply
trying to figure out and yeah
I'm I'm I'm looking at section
II.
well section F. right whoever
commits are some of the damages
over twenty thousand dollars
guilty of second degree felony.
And I'm trying to.
It's not clear to me how second
degree felony was arrived.
Senator chair Mister chairman
that language was already there
that's nothing new that we're
adding that's language that's
been in here since since way
before I got into the division
and those dollar amounts were
set from before so whether that
was a structure that burned
that's valued at over twenty
thousand dollars or in areas The
Boston that was valued over that
that that dollar value is
nothing that we're bringing into
play here at
What you just said a concise
Senator no it's okay Mr chair
Senator McKenna up these.
That the charges for misdemeanor
and felony we're already in the
statute and what this does is
just add wildland.
any clothes that in the in the
monetary damage.
Chairman and senator and yeah I
see that I'm I'm looking at the
underscored section and.
Yeah my comment is on the
original original statute it
just seems really deep to me and
your equipment Senator.
I think this Mr Martinez.
Yes.
Were you sharing
Were you sharing.
An incident whereby.
An arsonist was committed to a
mental institution right.
So in that case what were his
chopper official charges because
of his mental instability.
The if he.
I have about I there's about
fifty pages of different charges
that range from intentionally
setting fires to indecent
exposure but the majority of
these fires were property damage
breaking and entering and
intentionally setting fires two
of two two people's private
property.
Okay so I'm.
The chairman and senator and and
Mr Martinez so.
You don't know right now what he
was finally charged with yes it
it was arson thirty seventeen I
the statute that we're reading
now the charges he was the
charges he would that that were
filed on him is he actually set
a building on fire in a vehicle
on fire that extended into a
building so his charges were for
second it was the thirty
seventeen I F. the damages over
it was it was E. R. F. what it
was in the over to over twenty
thousand dollars I don't have
his his docket in front of me
but it was over twenty thousand
dollars worth of damage.
Okay thank you chairman and
senator and thank you Mr
Martinez and Senator
I think one Madam chairman
Senator Mr Martinez that I don't
see in here and maybe I'm over
citing it is.
Thanks someone specially a
youthful offender.
What I don't see in here is some
type of rehabilitation to
educate the person on what they
did and how damaging it is.
and some community service so
that's a committee on my part I
I just I get really tired of
just what of locking people up
and not really showing and
teaching them.
What there are four choices have
done thank you for the
conversation.
But maybe may I answer to that.
Yes go ahead yes please thank
thank you Mr chairman.
Albuquerque fire rescue we
actually have a program just for
that it's called the youth fire
awareness program it's a program
that we've developed over the
last couple years to do exactly
what you're asking for is to not
just lock up this kid it's to
educate the kids it's an
educational program for somebody
that either comes through our
division because they
intentionally set a fire or
because they were referred to us
to say Hey little little Tommy
here has been playing with
matches and he has an interest
in fire for whatever reason so
we do have a program for exactly
that that we were not just
writing these kids off for
making a mistake we're educating
them.
Thank you.
That's excellent on chairman and
senator at Mr Martinez I don't
have a writing instrument with
me when you said that could you
repeat that program again.
It's the acronym is why FAP
youth fire awareness program.
And that's put on by the City of
Albuquerque Albuquerque fire
rescue.
I'm so glad to hear about that
okay thank you
thank you chairman and senator
Mr Martinez for taking my
question is I appreciate it
thank you thank you thank you
senator Senator Mimi Stewart
Senators all.
Thank you Mr chairman
ThinkCentre pope have a couple
questions on this one.
So
And subsection Hey.
Is our and all of this kind of
goes through it'll say arson
consists of a person.
Willfully starting a fire.
With the purpose of damaging
wildland.
So so basically just.
I have to say they started a
fire.
With the purpose of causing some
damage to wildlife.
And then that is going to be.
What what what is the penalty
for that I I see below that you
have the.
The dollar amounts.
But what if I guess what I'm I'm
I'm trying to.
Come up with maybe a a more
extreme example like let's say a
you know.
Somebody somebody goes out there
and they want to burn a single
tree down.
And I'm not saying that's not
bad
But what what what would we do
there if it was you know the
damage was actually fairly small
but it was a will for our intent
what what what's the penalty for
that.
Mr chair Senator maybe as a
captain Martinez could answer.
Yeah yes so say it say it is one
individual tree and it's not
that you know it's it's a a kid
who was playing around and he
for whatever reason thought it'd
be a good idea to like the bush
on fire below the tree in the
damages the tree.
What all we need to do is find
the value to replace that tree
and that's going to be the
charge that will stick with him
so we're not trying to stick it
all felonies on everybody we're
just trying to be able to say
you made a mistake you
intentionally let this fire and
lucky for us we were able to put
it out while it was isolated to
one tree.
B. could that manages you
because now we're going to be
able to figure out those damages
and state you caused a four
hundred dollars worth of damage
so now that's a misdemeanor
charge.
high so I see.
Okay okay that makes sense yes
Mr chair and senator next for
yes that that does answer my
question mean what would be into
and I don't need a lot of detail
here but what let you know let's
say someone caused an acres
worth of damage I mean what we
is there some sort of assessor
or appraiser that would come out
and and actually make an
assessment of.
The total of dollar amount of
damage
I guess I'm not sure you know if
it makes sense of like you know
you burn a house down is that
okay how much is going to cost
to build a new house but how
does that work with the wild and
let's say it's you know it's
like I said an acre or two acres
now who.
to kind of figures out.
You know how the dollar amount
there.
Senator Manser that.
Please.
So so we had.
I've been working with the
gentleman from trees of Kerala's
who has been able to provide for
us a breakdown as to just about
every Libyan vegetation in the
state of New Mexico the way it's
done is kind of your County
developer is or city developer
whatever you have in your
respective area is able to say
okay based upon the land
adjacent to where this fire
burned there was X. amount of
education that fell into this
criteria in order to re plant
this the dollar value is X. Y.
Z..
That that's how we intend to to
move forward with the with the.
Determining the dollar value.
Okay okay.
Mr Mr chair and senator that
that makes sense I I just I try
to in these.
Crime bills I try to think like
a defense attorney and how
they're going to kind of.
Argue things you know so I just
wonder they're gonna get their
own assessor person and say no
no you said it was ten thousand
dollars my sister person over
here says it's only a hundred
dollars so I I think that's
that's a good no I I think that
makes sense now I I am.
I and I have one more other
section here about the
negligent.
Arson.
And so it just.
Yeah right there at the bottom
of page two.
Mr chair and senator so that it
says negligent arson consists of
of person recklessly starting a
fire in it could have been on
their own property.
And then it damages wildland.
and then that is going to be a
fourth degree felony so so
here's another example so let's
say.
A person.
Kind of recklessly starts a fire
but it's on their own property
they don't have malicious intent
they don't have a willful intent
to damage wild plant but they
recklessly set of files to the
burning trash on their own
property.
And the fire spread to the wind
picks up and the fire spread the
damages a couple acres of some
wild land next to their
property.
No not now that is that is going
to qualify as negligent arson
under this statute is that
correct.
Mr chair Senators maybe see if I
could have captured Martinez for
small.
Yes Senator no that will not the
the verbiage that that is and
and currently reads in the
statute says the willful or
malicious damaging by any
explosive substance or the
willful or malicious setting of
a fire or bridge and then there
for extending into while and so
if an individual is being
careless there's a there's a
negligent arson which which is
not going to be
You know of negligent arson is
its own charge we're not trying
to make that a second degree
charge so it's it's two separate
two separate charges if and this
happens quite often especially
when people are burning their
fields of burning you know
whatever it is with the drought
that we have right now this does
happen every year but the intent
was not there so we are not
looking to charge with and and
the according to the language
that we have right now it must
be willful and malicious in
order to get that charge to be a
second degree felony thank you
yes yes I'm and Mr Chairman
fortune is yes and and might my
question is specifically for the
negligent arson.
Not the regular Garcia so my
maybe I wasn't clear all can ask
again so for so for negligent
arson.
It says it can include the own
person's property so the same
example they're burning trash on
their own property recklessly.
And the fire spreads in damages.
Some wild lands right A. J. sent
to their property that is
negligent arson is is that
correct.
It it it yes yes.
Okay I Mr chair and misfortunes
I I mean I I definitely like the
the idea this bill of feathers
this summer one we heard a year
or two ago
and it was about aggravated
arson and we we I think we
increase the the penalty if if
the if the arsonist.
Started a fire in ended up
harming you know causing great
bodily harm to a fire fire to
wildland firefighter.
And
So I I I difference for that
bill I think this I I think the
section about negligent arson I
I I respectfully I think needs
some work.
I.
I think if someone is is
negligently burning trash in
their own property and it causes
the death of of your neighbor or
earns their house down that I
think that qualifies as a felony
I mean that's a big deal even
though they were negligent you
know that and that's a terrible
thing.
But if someone negligently is
burning trash and it just
spreads to the forest land or
summer something next to their
property I mean I I live in the
forest you know.
I don't I don't I just don't
know if that would would really
qualify for me as a felony that
yes it's bad that that maybe the
fight the fire spreads in.
But I I would I kind of like a
maybe a two tiered approach to
this negligent arson
if this is hopefully helpful to
you I I would I would maybe say
that.
I don't know if you'd be based
on once again acreage or or
something like that or if it
generated a major
response from firefighters or
something because I I just think
if if you're burning trash in
your yard in the winter X. up
and then it the fire spreads and
it burns you know half an acre
an acre I I don't know if that's
enough to me to make you a felon
I'd rather that be a misdemeanor
not the fire was really gonna
cause severe damage and you like
burned down the.
After National Forest because
you were negligent on your
property I mean that that might
qualify as a felony so I I would
just that's my one hold up on
the screen I'd like I'd like to.
Kind of.
Re work that negligent arson
piece of a little bit
if that makes sense but
otherwise I it's a certain like
the intent of the bill.
It is any consolation next up
for this bill will be Judiciary.
And they will certainly be
closely examining that section.
Now thank you Mr chair.
Senator Tomlinson.
Thank you Mr chair and.
Senator pope we all my questions
except one have been answered.
can I assume that.
You consulted with sentencing
experts.
And help you determine what the.
It should be.
Mr chair Senator tall man I did
not because it was just
following the current statutes
and and adding the wildland I
could capture Martinez captain
Ortega I don't know if you would
want to add to that.
Senator what we were just
following the exact yet like you
stated the statute as it reads
right now simply by trying to
add while and into it so if if
you committed a second degree
felony it matches a second
degree felony charge where we
were looking to change anything
along those lines thank you.
Well I think as senator thank
you for that and the answer I
think at.
Senator is to provide excellent
Senator Schmedes were on to
something here I.
Thank you so supported if if
the.
Yes this is going on to to the
judiciary is that correct.
Yes.
okay that that's all I have
Senator of thank you Mr chairman
thank you senator Paul thank you
Senator Steinborn looks a little
of the committee on this regard
to.
Senate bill three ninety six.
a motion
so move.
Senator tell me moving and do
best.
Yes thank you for that
clarification.
Secretarial.
I'm.
Three ninety six.
Yes.
Yes.
Logos.
No.
Past.
I'm sorry I didn't hear that.
Two passed please.
Hello this is pressing.
No I'm I'm going to I've made.
So
this past
service Lopez excuse Senator
Stewart she's she's here that's
what I'm telling you.
Your vote is.
Past.
Past.
Thanks no.
Third.
Yes.
I'm gonna vote yes I'd like to
explain previous.
Lopez.
Know when I'd like to explain
please.
You know yes.
Senator Schmedes explained his
vote.
Yes Mister chair thank you thank
you Center pope I'm voting yes
because I I I agree with most of
this bill
but if if if if this bill were
to hit the floor that same
version I would vote no once
again because of the negligent
arson section I I hope I hope
that we could get that worked on
a little bit thank you Mr chair.
You senator Senator said the a
lotus we wanted to explain you
are now thank you I voted no
because I I just have a problem
making a felony out of behavior
that is merely negligent I think
that's inconsistent with our
criminal law I understand they
were just barely that's that's
elsewhere but my philosophy of
criminal law of felonies is it
requires intentional behavior so
for that reason I I voted no.
Thank you.
What what is the what is the
phone.
What is that anyone was elected
by the way.
All.
Yes No was a vote on that or yes
is three knows one excuse.
Mr chair something our state
here there has to to a to
explain my vote.
Well I I agree with us Senator
sh me these at this fact
changed.
but I guess the Florida vote now
thank you.
Senator you're going to explain
to I'm not sure and I just want
to make sure that I want to ask
penny issue has me down for a
test.
Senator okay thank you chairman.
Thank you so
we thank you senator dole thank
you you got a great show that
said negligent arson section but
I mean I'm sure they're going to
do is adding Judiciary I can't
imagine that they wouldn't try
we were had a section out so
Mister chairman committee
members I I took every all your
comments to heart and I do
believe we do need to do some
work I agree with senator
Vicente you know maybe
addressing in the bill folks
that are in mental distress or
dealing with mental illness to
where we're not locking folks up
for that reason and then looking
at the Calexico
we'll do some work on this thank
you thank you senator.
Our vital Sedillo the night is
Senate bill four we Senator
Wirth thank you Mr chairman of
Senate bill four wages rise of
bodily bodily integrity for
having public or private
discrimination requiring
informed consent limiting
medical interventions when a
person or search their right to
bodily integrity and making an
exception and also declaring
Matt Martin St this bill does
three things Mr chair it
establish the rate of bodily
integrity which enforce
reinforces the principle of the
order voluntary at all just let
me start that over December's
right above the integrity and
upholding Mexicans that New
Mexicans have a right to choose
what happens our bodies
including medical procedures in
in.
Interventions apologize it's
getting late it also establishes
the informed consent which.
Such that New Mexicans not be
coerced threatened or mandated

all times ensuring the New
Mexico or allowed to make

without threats to their
employment or access to public
public service housing education
and the rest of Mr Chairman I've
got to expert witnesses I also
have a an amendment I don't know
Mr chair if you want to move
that now or Hamm introduced by
expert witnesses first.
Is the amendment the simple one
we can just go on the screen and
look at yes Sir it is are we do
that before we get your extra
reduces.
The server.
Mr pregnant splaine.
Mr on page one one eleven were
striking all of line eleven of
them we come down Mr still page

And we're back on the bill and
you have some expert witnesses
Senator yes Sir thank you Mr and
and I'll try to be right I've
got to ask for witnesses a
person's Kelly Williams miss
Williams holds three master's
science degrees to which deal
specifically with microbiology
immunology and infectious
diseases hello is a PhD
candidate and serves as under
fell back to the department of
pharmacology and toxicology with
Wright state university it's
Richard's research is focused
primarily on hemorrhagic fever
viruses and nanoparticles.
All of this our workgroup my
next my second is Sir Smith
this green chemical engineering
and previously worked as NASA
air space scientist with focus
in on option safety and more
recently serves been working as
natural health care practitioner
for eight years in addition Sir
is working with the New Mexico
freedom alliance a nonpartisan
group a statewide grassroots
organizations that's for freedom
and choice and with that will
stand for questions.
You want to say anything
Senator.
You know I appreciate if we have
time for them to give
introductions sure.
Here Representative Reese
explanation for why you're
supporting this bill services.
Williams I guess was very
million millions.
Impact.
Here it back and we can hear
you.
have a.
Even better.
Okay I think good evening I've
been asked to provide a
statement regarding vaccine
development emergency use
authorizations for medical
treatment
but the context I regularly work
with infectious organisms and
help process over eighty
thousand COVID samples in the
early stages of this pandemic by
no means am I anti vaccination
or anti science on the contrary
as a lifelong scientist.
It's great value in the
scientific advancements that
four of such a high quality of
life however I also plays a most
value in individual freedom of
choice and the right to come to
one's own conclusions about
healthcare
so in advance of this during our
prepared comments about
traditional FDA medical
countermeasure approval
processes and emergency use
authorization I have prepared
comments about how employers are
legally permitted to mandate the
participation and emergency use
authorization treatments.
I also consider detailing a
COVID nineteen vaccines use of
novel technologies such as mRNA
and viral vectors but this isn't
a COVID nineteen bill right this
is also not an anti vaccination
bill by any stretch this is just
a bill that's intended to
reinforce in individuals natural
rights to determine the course
of their own life and how to
pursue happiness in our own way.
The right to bodily integrity to
choose one's medical decisions
should not be a partisan issue
and our health care choices
should also not be a political
football.
We shouldn't even have to be
here discussing such a
foundational and obviously
personal choice.
I also fully admit that in our
current situation the COVID
nineteen vaccines can be viewed
as medical miracles and I
applaud everyone involved in
their development testing
however in our oculus medical
breakthrough therapy medical
ethics should necessitate
informed consent without dress
however effective and safe the
vaccine or drug maybe
individuals should still have
the right to make health care
choices without fear of
discrimination or legal action I
have friends and family such as
my mother who eagerly talked a
COVID nineteen vaccine and I
fully respect their decision I
also.
I also have friends and family
who vehemently refuse a COVID
nineteen vaccine and likewise I
respect their decision the point
is that they considered all
available information and made a
decision their decision.
One healthcare choices should be
considered as a protected class
Department ical choices are not
our own and can be directed by
external forces there's no
limiting principle to prevent
future incursions these concerns
well out of the the current
pandemic and I just ask that you
consider these points in your
decision thank you.
Thank you Mr Williams Sarah
Smith.
Thank you for allowing me to
discuss this important bill with
you today.
I worked for a decade as a NASA
aerospace engineer specializing
in oxygen safety for both
astronauts and the general
public for the past eight years
I worked as a natural health
care practitioner including
treating people with COVID
nineteen.
Because science and health are
central to my life I have been
doing deep research on the COVID
nineteen situation science since
the very beginning and sharing
this information with the
public.
As an alternative health care
provider I have seen firsthand
that each person's body and
health care situation is unique
and that they must be allowed to
choose carefully which medical
treatments are best for them
some people's bodies do not
react well to certain
medications and treatments
leading them to seek alternative
health supporting strategies.
Here in Dona ana county a few
weeks ago the county manager for
non the less yes mandated
vaccination for first responders
including firefighters law
enforcement emergency medical
personnel and detention center
employees given that the
injection does not have full FDA
approval and only has emergency
use authorization it is against
federal law to mandate this
treatment.
Difficult vaccine development
takes five to ten years where is
there has not been any long term
safety testing on COVID nineteen
injections.
None the less less yes mandated
to shop for first responders in
my county and told them they
would be terminated if they did
not receive this vaccine.
Because of my work in my public
health research New Mexicans who
are hurting reach out to me
frequently I have spoken with
several Dona Ana County first
responders including
firefighters law enforcement
paramedics and detention center
employees who did not want this
injection for various reasons.
Some of these people have
recently had COVID I did not
want the injection because they
already have natural immunity.
One person was pregnant and did
not want to take the vaccine
because of no risks to her
unborn child.
The CDC has acknowledged from
the beginning that none of the
COVID nineteen vaccines have
been tested on pregnant women
yet her OBGYN would not
different exemption and she was
being threatened with
termination if she did not
receive the injection.
Some first responders were aware
of other effective treatment
options that they chose to use
over vaccination.
All of these people are being
threatened with losing their
livelihoods losing their ability
to provide food for their
families losing their ability to
pay for housing if they do not
receive this injection.
Many have already been
vaccinated against their own
will and determination of what
is right for themselves one such
person isn't on cleaning staff
she lives paycheck to paycheck
and was terrified of losing her
job she was told by her boss she
had to get vaccinated at a
certain day and time and she
complied against your own will
even though she had done
research on alternative
treatment strategies I prefer to
use other methods to treat this
illness.
Just last week here in Los
crucis our mayor said in an
interview that he thinks
restaurant should be open for
indoor dining for vaccinated
people only well are counties in
red status this despite the fact
that the CDC has expressly said
people who have a history of
allergic reaction should not
take this vaccine and that it
has not been tested on pregnant
or lactating women people with
autoimmune disease or you know
compromise people.
We have government officials who
are ready to severely restrict
people from participating in our
community based on their medical
status.
Another person contacted me a
few days ago because she was
actually fired from her job with
a medical equipment company
because she chose not to receive
injections.
We cannot allow this to continue
New Mexicans are being
discriminated against coerced
threatened and fired in relation
to their vaccination status it
is a basic human right to decide
whether or not to undergo
medical procedures and we cannot
allow discrimination against
people who exercise this right.
The governor recently said when
she signed SB ten into law
anyone who seeks to violate
bodily integrity is in the
business of dehumanisation New
Mexico is not in that business
not anymore in a quote.
Bill SB four await represents
the same spirit of up holding
choice and bodily integrity it
gives the New Mexico legislature
another important opportunity to
step up and protect these rights
for New Mexicans.
The issues I have discussed are
centered around the COVID
nineteen vaccine but the
overarching principles of this
bill are not directed against
vaccines it is not an anti
vaccine bill is a bill about
people's rights to make informed
medical choices this is one of
the most important issues facing
our state today as it goes
directly to the very heart of
people's rights here and
everywhere.
It is critical for the well
being of our state that this
issue be allowed to have a
hearing on the Senate floor.
Thank you for your
consideration.
Thank you.
Anything else to say before you
go to the audience well Sir well
we're ready to to listen the
audience and take questions.
Did you thank you since our.
Will.
Madam against enjoyments of
COVID for.
This measure.
And we're going to show those
who called in ahead of time.
There's enough time left on the
clock we'll go to those who
didn't call in ahead that are in
the audience.
Those who are against.
The only restaurant.
Well yes we.
Israeli restaurants.
Right.
He followed by Senator Penn.
Sandra.
Followed by Aerion showers.
Very very in showers followed by
Daniel Burke.
Sorry in showers name there.
Well as the Denver provided here
in bed.
At.
All right I'm here I think I I
think I didn't study that bill
well enough I was thinking this
was with related to vaccines for
children
well it does talks
Representative okay sorry so
basically
you know childhood
immunizations are the bedrock of
public health they're basically
the seal that protect not only
kids but all society because
it's the one place in society
where we tell people you do need
to get vaccinated there are
ample chances already in our
laws to exempt people from
from mediatisation requirements
and we know that because about
forty five hundred kids are
exempted every year that number
keeps going up every year
the more permissive we make our
statutes in avoiding vaccines
it's really moving the wrong way
you know if you if you choose
not to get chemotherapy for
cancer that's on you but if you
choose not to get your kids
vaccinated.
That's a collective decision
because it affects the
collective health so I think
it's the more more choices to
avoid vaccines is is just not
good for public health and is
moving the wrong direction so
that's what I think thanks.
Thank you well then we'll go to
anybody else in the audience
wants to speak against this
bill.
We guarantee we'll start.
Share GDP now and members of the
committee my name is Rita
Garrity student in terms of this
really act actually opposed to
Senate bill four oh eight on
behalf of Planned Parenthood of
the rocky mountain thank you for
your time.
Thank you Mr cherry Jones a
million Sanford.
Mr chair members of the
committee my name is Joan among
in Sanford on the.
Executive director of the New
Mexico religious coalition for
reproductive choice and we
oppose this bill
Because of our concern.
Four of teens and use numerous
studies have found that access
to confidential services is one
of the prime determinants of
whether adolescents will seek or
obtain timely health care
related to sensitive topics such
as sexuality and substance abuse
study shows somewhere between
eight.
Thirty one percent of teens
delay or entirely for go health
care because of concerns that
their private information will
be revealed to parents or
others.
Research also confirms that
teens who believe that there are
their health care provider will
maintain that confidentiality
are more likely to discuss
sensitive health topics such as
sexually transmitted diseases
pregnancy prevention and
substance abuse with their
provider because those
protections are are lacking and
even the being
With strong potentially in this
bill we have to oppose it thank
you very much.
Thank you Mr Senator is there
anyone else who wants to speak
against the bill.
K. over you can reset the
collective Gen and we'll start
with those who called in ahead
of time in support right Jeff
how we well as I Melanie Rubin.
Yes.
Just a few months ago Albertsons
in Los crucis gave employees a
choice Reports tested for
comment.
We're going on indefinite unpaid
leave until they change their
minds the assumption on being
infected with COVID nineteen was
assumed based on no evidence
the Sam's club in Albuquerque
force tested all employees under
threat of being fired and this
was done by the National Guard.
We have an unalienable right to
our own bodies to make our own
medical decisions about our
bodies and of our minor
children's bodies for the U. S.
constitution the declaration of
independence our bodies or our
choice period the schools
for testing vaccinations and any
other medical pre procedure and
yes.
Please support est SP four oh
eight thank you.
Yes thank you Mr alley the
Melanie Rubin's all invited
Philip Butler.
Good evening Mr chairman and
senator is can you hear me yes
great thank you so much for your
time I know it's been a very
long day for you.
Yesterday I sent to a petition
with almost twenty one hundred
signatures from New Mexicans who
are asking you to uphold the
right to choice and bodily
integrity with respect to COVID
nineteen vaccination they're
also seeking our protection from
discrimination for services
regardless of their personal
medical choices.
I want to point out that this is
not a partisan issue.
Don't you want the right to
decide what happens to your body
and the bodies of your children.
What do you personally want this
vaccination or not shouldn't
each person have a right to
choose what happens to their
body.
As a person of Jewish descent I
don't want to see any group get
coerced into receiving medical
treatment they don't agree with
or separated in society for
their medical choices this is
already being discussed in New
Mexico and Senators it is a
slippery slope.
As you've heard from Mister
Williams and Mrs Smith some of
these things are already
happening in New Mexico.
Please do not let the activation
status become the yellow arm
band star of twenty first
century New Mexico please vote
yes on SB four oh eight thank
you for your attention.
Thank you Mr.
The clerk invite Tracy
Hollister.
Good evening.
I'm a general dentist for Health
Care degree and while the
medical arguments involved are
important I think we all agree
that the underlying moral
arguments are actually driving
the debate around this issue so
the moral argument favor Senate
bill four eight but I'm going to
be a particularly a person's
body is the most fundamental
property in an individual's
claim to ownership and use of
their body must supersede any
such claim that their neighbors
or society mixer the same
principles that for business for
mandating even relatively minor
altruistic acts like what the
nation also for us from
mandating vaccination.
It is a patient's right to
refuse medical treatment and we
must not deceive ourselves
vaccination is indisputably a
form of medical treatment
forcing the vaccination into
someone against their will is a
violation of conscience for
those who do not want to we
already recognize the principles
of individual liberty extent to
support conscientious objection
in times of actual war against
another nation and that being
the case the same fundamental
principles must also permit
individuals to conscientiously
abstain for personally engaging
in one or more medical
interventions to combat athletes
mandated vaccinations were not
needed to eliminate smallpox the
twentieth century and COVID
nineteen is not even in the same
league as fox there must be
allowed for concerts and there
simply is no other moral option
that gives sufficient support
and respect for human dignity
and the right to choose and
legally discriminate against
people for the medical uses
every it is wrong is doing so on
grounds of politics or religion
thank you for your time.
Thank you Mr Butler Tracy
Hollister to re followed by
money order and on this.
Thank you Mr chairman sponsored
day of those and Senators New
Mexico's urgency New Mexicans
urgently needs center for a way
to protect us from the growing
trend of vaccine mandates as
we've already seen and Dona Ana
County for two reasons one
vaccines especially those in the
experimental phase are not safe
right choice for everyone.
Including those my Y. paralyzed
from three months after taking a
flu vaccine.
Vaccines are not the only way to
protect us from diseases like
COVID nineteen scientists have
since found established and safe
medications that are effective.
My wife and I are grateful to
have found a doctor to prescribe
one for us but we all the served
as such meaningful choices
recent test for Senate bill four
oh eight.
Thank you this call is here
Senator none this followed by
nine cedar rel.
Thank you to the committee
allowing me the opportunity to
share my thoughts on SB four
away with you today I'm I'm a
parent in Albuquerque public
school teacher and a contributor
to other private and public
programs that the city I do feel
a responsibility keep those
around the state in regards to
the suggested guidelines such as
wearing a mask thank you for the
part when needed with regards to
being asked to puncture my skin
to put a foreign substance such
as any taxing into my body.
I believe we all should have a
choice I believe I should have
the right to choose what is best
for my body without the
ramification of losing my job
are being scrutinized no one
else should have the right to my
bodily integrity.
I have many concerns were being
asked to put my body at risk for
my child based on the
recommendation with
contradictory support from
science and public there are so
many and found I do not think
any public or private entity
should have the right just my
body and my life or that of my
child's honor thank you.
Thank you Mr none this Nancy
zero dollars by sharing our.
For chairman and senators my
name is Nancy derail I am an
attorney and I live in plus
status in Santa Fe County
Senator Candace territory
absolutely clear I am not anti
vaccine what I am is anti
mandatory vaccine.
There was a saying from the
nineteen sixties that once again
has come around my body my
choice.
Not shell it means that I and I
alone have the right to
determine what happens to my
body the decisions I make with
respect to my health our basic
human right and liberty
guaranteed to each one of us by
the US and New Mexicans
constitutions.
Anything else is a violation of
my civil liberties.
SB four await secures the rate
again to accept or work medical
intervention this law will
protect the decisions I make and
no consequences shell attached
to my choices.
And last but not least to
Senator McKenna I will be deeply
disappointed if you vote against
SB four away it will signal to
me that our civil liberties are
secondary in your mind the need
for the government excuse me I'm
sorry but that really is not is
not an appropriate department.
Make your own decision and
doesn't need to be spread all.
Thank you Mr L. thank you it was
followed by a gentleman or.
Good evening
my name is Karen K. A. goes I'm
a retired scientist and engineer
from and I've worked twenty five
years and research and
development including research
in infectious diseases to
support the development in
Barala G..
In a class three biosafety lab
where viruses are spread by
aerosol and I accepted
many non FDA approved
experimental vaccines to work in
that laboratory environment.
I have read discussed here
extensively on science topics
and I have tried to come to the
best conclusions I do
appreciate.
Science but I do also appreciate
choice and I do know that there
are no other treatments
prophylactic set and
therapeutics that are
appropriate for this virus.
What I am against is a vaccinate
all strategy and I am also
concerned that after reading the
clinical trials and watching
what is really happening and
looking.
And researching the technology
that there are many unknowns and
there are too many really to
list here but basically.
We're entering we cannot compare
the vaccines of yesterday to the
vaccines that are presented to
us today the vaccines have
entered a new era this is an
evolving and in a trance
formation okay.
And we have not spoken about it
and I believe it needs to be
spoken about.
Effectively modern of themselves
calls their own injectable
technology their own vaccine
technology equivalent to the
software of life there's
absolutely something very
essential that we're talking
about in the changes that are
going on in this technology
Furthermore.
From working in Sir working in
these laboratory highly
infectious environments in the
past I do know that prior to
entering I did not just receive
a vaccine I was tested
serological Lee to prove
immunological status of might
the munity and I do know that.
Everyone's individual immune
system whether it's confronted
with a wild virus or a vaccine
will respond differently and
individually and that is not
being done we do know that you
are more at risk yeah I mean if
you have already had a exposure
and then you take the the
vaccine.
In closing there's just a lot of
issues at stake here and I
support choice I think it's an
individual choice we can see
what's happening on the ground
and we can come to understand
what is Representative this new
wave and the current situation
that we're in please support and
consider this the actual
science.
And please consider supporting
of us Senate bill four oh eight
thank you for your time.
Comments concluded the ten
minutes maybe a lot and for the
some portion of this bill did
you want to say anything in
London before we go to the
committee senators.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
for both sides I think the main
thing we want to bring up that
it's an important medical
choices and will stand for
questions.
Members of the committee.
I want to open up just really
with the comment section because
you made an amendment.
Destroyed section fourteen.
But.
One.
During.
That.
Says formally testing a person's
formally charge for allegedly
committing certain criminal
offenses industries that but on
the very last page on page
seventy.
You do prohibitions against.
Using DNA samples and testing
your your bill says DNA samples
and testing will not be employed
prisoners filed a written
notification of the person's
right and bodily integrity and
then a little lower you said
persistent arrested for driving
under the influence of
intoxicating liquor may assert
the right of bodily integrity
interviews a blood alcohol test.
Thank
know I think you left in some.
Some pieces that are
inconsistent with the pieces
that you removed and I just want
to point that out after your
bill goes way beyond
vaccinations.
What Mr chair and we actually
had a list of of other action
air areas we're looking at after
we did talk to Legislative
Council but we're looking at the
time in left in the session and
I actually have
Seven other areas so we're
looking at and as we go forward
at this bill does go for that's
our next piece Mr try to get
back to Legislative Council
because of.
Miss Smith found a few these and
we're wanting to get back to
legislative counsel to see if
there are any resolutions they
can do before we get to the
Senate floor this doesn't go to
the Senate next year are
foremost we've got.
You're free next year yes so
we're hoping to get the
Legislative Council just get
more amendments done now that
miss Smith found those items.
Senator serial.
Thank you Mr chairman and the
thank you senator guy goes I am.
Are we clear bill I was
flabbergasted.
Because but only because we have
a constitutional right to
privacy in this country and I
know you are very opposed to
that constitutional right to
privacy which I think is an
element of of bodily integrity
and then going through this this
This bill over and over I kept
thinking to myself.
There is a concept of informed
consent.
In for every every single one of
these things that you that you
called for except for some of
the criminal things that you the
current criminal and testing
things H. I. V. and
I mean there are there are few
exceptions and they're small
exception to for consent I guess
I'll just ask you why doesn't
existing law about informed
consent and the right to
privacy.
Deal with well I guess I should
start with what is the problem
that you're trying to address.
Well Mr chair and and Senator
we're just getting a lot of
calls from people who were
afraid of it being mandated as
far as a vaccine in in that
discussion we started through
group trying to figure out how
to best
Affected in a way that people
have their own choices instead
of it being forced on and I'd
I'd prefer to either Kelly or
Sir if they want to follow up on
that on either one of you.
A lot of the places in this bill
it's actually just updating the
wording so a lot of places where
there already was informed
consent that a white worker that
way there are today as you go Mr
Chairman and Senator DO.
Yes answering questions.
Thank you.
So yes Mr chairman and senator
save your Lopez
a lot of the sections in this
bill we're actually just adding
words to make the wording
consistent they already had
processes in place for someone
denying having a test we're
having a sample taken but it
just didn't have those specific
words so it the Legislative
Council was trying to update on
the statutes to make it
consistent with the wording
search for a lot of the ones
that are in here.
Thank you Mr chair so then I ask
you again what is the difference
or maybe not again but I'll ask
it a different way what is the
difference between bodily
integrity and informed consent.
Mr chairman and senator Sir do
you have.
a direct answer on that.
Well
difference is bodily integrity
is a sorry Sir Mr chair Senator
Lopez sorry
Bodily integrity is a person's
right to decide what's going to
happen to their body informed
consent is different in that
informed consent requires that
if a person is going to undergo
a procedure that they're
informed of what the risks are
of that procedure and so for
instance with the current
vaccines they're required to
give out a fact sheet they give
much information about what
ingredients are in there with
the risks are so that's the
difference is that answering
your question.
Ms Mr chair Senator Gallegos
so with bodily integrity you're
not you don't get informed.
I I'm not understanding the
difference.
Mr chair Senator and Sir could
you expand on that anymore.
Yes Mr chair and Senator Sedillo
Lopez so.
They're basically two different
areas as far as bodily integrity
is somebody being able to choose
okay what's going to actually
happen to my body informed
consent I would say is part of
bodily integrity you know as
someone who's going to exercise
bodily integrity you would want
informed consent so that you
know what you're agreeing to
but what informed consent by
itself doesn't necessarily
provide protection for bodily
integrity.
Mr chair Senator Gallegos that
is not my understanding if I a
choose and I I remember Senator
smitteez had a bill about about
this if I choose to decline a
vaccination that is my choice if
I choose to decline any medical
procedure that is my that's the
whole point of informed consent
I'm somebody explains to me the
costs benefits risks of whatever
the informed consent requires
that varies based on procedure
and then I say no or I say yes
and and that is determining what
happens to my body so I'm having
I I find it confusing to have
all of these informed consent
provisions in this in this
seventy page statute and then
added to it.
Of bodily integrity which I
think as far as I am aware
doesn't have meaning in the law
informed consent has a very
clear and understood meaning and
a doctor who violates informed
consent can be liable for that
there are consequences if
somebody were to perform the
procedure on my body against my
will there are consequences not
only civil consequences it in
certain circumstances it could
be criminal.
So I I honestly I I was just
flabbergasted I just don't
understand.
The reason for the bill you say
it when I ask you what is the
problem I always ask that the
question of myself what is the
problem we're trying to address
and what you said the problem is
here.
I just don't think that's a good
policy a basis for a lot of
legislative.
Statutes to address a fear that
hasn't even I I I'm not aware
and I even followed up and
Senator Smith please build
because he claimed that people
were
asking for an exemption from
vaccinations and not getting it
so I followed up in in fact that
is not the case I was told under
no circumstances if somebody
apply for an exemption from the
vaccination or they denied so.
I I am I am really sorry I I
just feel like this bill is a
lot of bill seventy pages.
That seeks to solve a problem
that is not there
and so I I cannot support this
bill.
Great.
Let's go to Senator Tallman
followed by Senator Schmedes.
Senator home and are you there
are.
Yes.
So.
The.
This report.
The.
All right it's very just a.
Thank thank you mediated drivers
could refuse to a blood test and
DNA.
So are has your all your as a
amendment taken care of all
those.
possibilities.
No Mr chair Senator after
discussion after we looked at
your original draft from well
actually do look to do amended
draft local we're working on
that we realize that in
Legislative Council just wanted
to sort of clear the warning
throughout that
of Bill that we're gonna have to
go back through and that's where
I stated earlier that miss Smith
has found a total of eight so
we've corrected one already but
in reserves the we've been doing
since that amendment was made
the thirst of seven other areas
that we're wanting to discuss
with of Legislative Council to
see if if what share scene and
even the chairman and yourself
have picked up on some issues
that we need to address before
we get to Judiciary okay okay
thank you Mr chairman thank you
senator of.
For the answer it.
a.
Now there may be a few
exceptions but are people being.
Discriminated against in
wholesale numbers.
If they are.
Refused to be vaccinated I mean
is it a huge problem.
Mr chairman and senator I don't
have any numbers on that
wondering if a carrier Sir would
have any.
Yes this Mr chair and senator
tall and so what ended up
happening in the county here is
that two thirds of the first
responders actually did not want
the vaccine and so there was
about a hundred and twenty total
and.
Then they ended up mandating it
so it is happening in large
enough numbers and the way it
actually happened was they
specifically
Just told them you are scheduled
to do it at this time and you
have to do it this time in there
telling them we're going to fire
you if you don't do it so that's
really the big difference
between bodily integrity and
Informed consent is the reason
that we're trying to establish
bodily integrity is to protect
against people being able to be
discriminated against.
Because this isn't necessarily
about informed consent
they are telling them you have
to do this.
And and we know it's happening.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Thank you for the answer what
what what this first responders
are you talking about.
Albuquerque the county.
Mr center a cheaper Donley
talking about the Los crucis are
okay.
Okay thanks for that answer Mr
chair Senator and many other
states have passed similar laws.
Mr chair Senator in Sir do you
have any such list on the
state's.
I'm I know there were a few
other states you have them on
their docking I'm not sure if
they've passed or not.
Okay thank you for that answer
thank you Mr chair.
I have problems with this bill
for the same reasons a sorry
been articulated by Senator
Sedillo Lopez.
This is not a question just a
committee of twenty five point
if we only have five percent of
the world's population we've had
twenty five percent of the
world's deaths.
That's all you got to know about
the United States as to why we
got a big problem thank you Mr
chair thank you.
Senator bringing this bill
forward thank you thank you
thanks senators on us.
Duration any scratches or order
your usual questions ladies.
Yes Sir.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
center guiding us and Mrs Smith
Well I a couple of things I want
to just brush on before I got to
my questions yes I'm I'm glad we
took out those criminal statutes
however I.
That so that the why but that's
the thing I mean about.
About five years ago I think and
I discussed this heavily with
the Representative rain because
he's he's an expert on this and
has run a lot of the wide bills.
It's it's unconstitutional to
you know make it a crime or or
to you know for somebody to take
a blood test for the wind that
the Supreme Court has already
ruled on that.
so I don't see that being an
issue what we really have how I
see this is in in back to this
informed consent discussion I'm
it step one the way I read your
bills bodily integrity is it's
listing it is a two step process
step one is you're gonna get to
make a decision free of the rest
free of threat worth three of
compulsion okay you have a right
not to be threatened by somebody
making a medical decision and
then step two you're making a
decision now that we've said is
not going to be under compulsion
of stress.
And you're entitled to informed
consent now to make your own
decision for yourself with the
available medical information so
that's the difference it's a two
step process and so I I.
Senator Gallegos met Mr chair
sorry I guess my is that it is
that kind of what you're doing
is is that you're you're you're
saying that someone has a right
to be free.
from being threatened or
compelled to do something to
their body this is that is my
understanding that correctly.
Yes Sir Mr Mr chair and senator
ready and if you just look at
the Los crucis area in and out
of the first responders were
threatened with their jobs in
order to force them to take the
vast vaccination that's the type
of issue that we thought was
relevant enough to bring this
forward to see if we can find
some kind of solution that they
would not.
Have to go through that can be
threatened in order to to take
the vaccine.
Okay thank you and yes Mr
chairman I'll get to the we'll
get to the vaccine stuff in a
minute
I was also flabbergasted when I
read some of the existing
statute in this bill that you're
amending.
One of which was testing for
pregnant women you know
that we have in our state
statute in mandatory blood tests
for syphilis for private one I
mean that's unbelievable to me I
mean I think I understand how it
happened I mean you.
What what happens in medicine
you know we we develop new.
New screening techniques new
testing and then a group of
doctors you know can come
legislation so look at look at
this evidence that we have for
public health it's going to be
good let's put in statute and
say yes but
I'll give an example I mean I I
you know I have seven children
my wife
has given birth to seven
children.
We have a monogamous
relationship.
And in state statute we're we're
we haven't words mandatory that
she gets tested for syphilis
during every pregnancy I mean
that's absolutely outrageous and
I think that needs to change.
and so I'm glad that that you
have that I don't I don't think
it's in force because.
You know how to no one's gonna.
I mean I don't know maybe maybe
it has been for systemscases but
I I really don't know but I know
it hasn't for from I want during
her pregnancies
But that that was just something
that I saw on your bill
section not believe that's
existing law that's unbelievable
to me.
And I understand how the to jump
around a little bit it's big
deal but you know with the crime
stuff I I I know that probably
got convoluted looking at and I
I did not read the FIR on this
bill actually but
Sometimes I do sometimes I don't
but I but I do think the DIY
stuff I think stands
constitutionally I don't maybe
you could talk to you know the
AG's office about that some more
but I I don't see that actually
as a as a problem the other ones
I thought may have I do have a
question about military etcetera
That does this do what what this
pertain to military individuals
or or not.
Mr Mr chairman of Senator up I
don't know I don't recall any
discussion about any the bases
are in the military but Sir did
you
have any input from many of
those in the military.
As of of Las Cruces.
This Mr chair and senator Gaydos
the military is under sort of a
different code to some degree
they actually are not mandating
this vaccine
I think because they know it's
emergency use authorization but
we weren't targeting that they
they under there under a whole
different set of rules that they
agree to and they have had
issues actually in the past with
mandating the anthrax vaccine in
the military and there were
lawsuits which they won because
that was back that was mandated
and several of them were injured
so.
This bill wasn't necessarily
specifically looking at
military.
Okay thank you and Mr chair
Senator at night I do have a
couple questions specifically
about the the vaccine issue
Well first of all you know there
was a comment about you know a
higher you know higher death
rate in the United States and
some something or other there is
great data
that actually just came out
about we could to go about and
doing some multi very analysis
with COVID death rates and
obesity rates and controlling
for other factors and you know
they looked at the U. K. and the
United States which has very
high will be C. rates.
And they looked at it.
Countries have very low obesity
rate such as Vietnam Vietnam has
extremely low.
COVID that's right one of the
lowest in the world also has one
of the lowest obesity rates in
the world and that makes sense
to me and I'm gonna get I'm not
going to get into the details
but but if you look at about
chemistry to look at how the
information cascade forms and
and the body.
the that that makes that would
make great sense to me just
physiologically.
And so I think we're seeing more
more reserves to to look at you
know people with metabolic
syndrome and obesity in their
COVID death rates so I I in
that's good news I think that's
good news
it's good and bad that we we
have a high reserve rate but
it's good news that there's
something that we can control
and something that we can
address you know through healthy
lifestyles for our our our
citizens.
But.
To to the specifics of the bill
on vaccine this is kind of.
You know for whoever still
listening out there there are
some comments about vaccination
I'd like to think about this way
they're least considerate please
You know we've seen bills in
this committee about.
You know all kinds of you know
sexual harassment.
workers rights
I think we have a bill coming to
us about
You know injection and and and
or or right sure you know for
preventing people from having
the the harsh landlord of
protecting the renters and
people like that.
I think this right to ball
integrity really.
Applies to all those situations
as far as vaccination goes
imagine.
Imagine if your employer.
Came to you or your landlord
came to study I'm gonna fire you
were or I'm not going to promote
you or or I'm not going to renew
your lease unless you you know
do something you know sexual
with me.
What they're doing is they're
saying I'm going to threaten or
coerce you to do something to
your body that you don't want to
do for my benefit.
And that's what I hear these
people saying with with
vaccination there saying I'm
willing to force you.
To under go.
Something to do something to
your body.
For this supposed to you know
benefit for me.
because I think they're not
going to get some disease or
something I mean that is that is
the exact same logic logical
step logical reason.
Different different scenario but
it's the same logic.
So I hope you will consider that
even though there are people and
there's a huge debate there's
people that I think are more
inclined to vaccination are less
inclined.
But first for those people who
just want to be able to force
New Mexico Wirth and mandate on
say these Albertsons workers
that spoke and said they're
going to get not going to get
ours or they're not going to be
re hired to be fired.
No one no one should be.
Forcing anybody to do something
with their body for their own
benefit.
I mean like I said we we we I
think have developed a lot of
sophisticated statutes for
you know sex crimes in in that
in that regard
and that that's kind of an
extreme
you know example of that but
it's it's the same principle and
so so I I I.
In that vein I like how you
define the right to bodily
integrity and in I don't see
anywhere in the bill it says you
know people the snow pants get.
immunizations I mean that's not
in the building I'm looking at
section seventeen Senator.
And it it doesn't say people can
just refuse vaccine basically it
it says that.
You cannot be forced to have a
vaccine under threat or
compulsion it and I understand
that recreation.
Mr Chairman representative
you're correct in any and to
tell you.
You know and and just to be
honest I had COVID of one month
back in I look at this bill is
the difference between me and my
wife and my daughters so well
one of my daughters and my why
it taking the shot but if you
remember right of center you've
given me this little details on
both of the vaccines were out
there I handed them over my
daughter and my wife let them
read through I have not received
a shot because of what I
understand from time that I got
it I should have of antibodies
for up to ninety days but when I
do decide to make that
determination all go back to
information that I will as from
you because you seem to have a
really good lack of receiving
that kind of information
but just so that I would have
the information up front to make
that decision and not that my
wife would make it a forced
issue they would you stay in the
Santa Fe or you get a
vaccination thank you to all
it's just it's not just over the
right way to do it when you're
looking at people's livelihoods
it really affects their right
not to do what they have
questions state because are they
going to get another job can
they support their family and
you know what happens their body
if they do take the vaccinations
so you're right in New all give
us there are a lot of credit she
went through this children go
through this with a group of
people and and and all reality
the sections we're looking at
next five six twelve fifteen
eighteen twenty three to twenty
six at issues but because of
legislative Legislative Council
just wanted to go ahead and add
wording always through a lot of
this we don't need anymore and
that's.
One of the things that we're
gonna be working on if this bill
to make it out of this committee
today we'll be ready for next
year or two years from now but
the thing is if if we can go to
Judiciary L. with these and have
this information corrected so
that way we have the discussion
with our attorneys in the Senate
to be able to show them the true
intent of what we're trying to
do and be able to clean up the
language on statute.
Probably should have been there
for years but according
Legislative Council we educated
to add wording.
Long ways around to say yes.
Senator Schmedes I just want to
point out it is.
And twenty six.
We really haven't had any
questions from you or anything I
appreciate your sharing Senator
Gallegos viewpoint on this bill
but if you don't have anything.
Built into it we can just move
on because we still have three
more house built to deal with it
yes under and not yeah in all
all all all wrapped up
I am.
My my only other.
You know thing with this bill
and I you already answered the
question about the military that
was if you were gonna say
Senator that that that this
applied to military act I would
have had some concerns not about
the vaccine peace but
You know I I and I once again
this this also this is very very
much of workers rights issue and
and no one should be threatened
to be fired or demoted or
whatever because they're not
going to get a vaccine but I can
think of situations in the
military such as a and I'm not
an expert in this the like a
pilot you know they have to have
certain vision and they they
they they can sometimes kind of
mandate you know you have to get
your your your P. R. K. done
you're you're some sort of you
know procedure to to fix a
certain thing and I sometimes do
that with with people that are
coming in the military with
hearing issues and sometimes
they'll say are you you need to
get this procedure done or
something like that or or you're
not eligible and I don't really
see that as a Representative or
compulsion but but I can see
where your bill might you know
if if it was applied to military
but I I guess they're you know
they're not civilian so I guess
they're under a different things
so so I like that I'm glad that
it's not not inspectors
individuals but I will be
Senator I will be supporting the
bill mainly because I I think
that everybody has the right to
to not be threatened you know or
you know to to undergo some sort
of medical medical procedure put
anything in their body I think
that's what what you're doing
and I I don't see any any
problem with that whatsoever so
thank you Senator thank you Mr
Mister.
Thank you senator Ortiz
any any other.

I'm Mr chairman and members of
the committee I bring before you
house Judiciary.
Twenty seven of House Judiciary
Committee substitute which.
What the price is it.
Chairman and members of the
committee the committee
substitute separates Hazen
waited Hazen in the following
ways.
Consist of an unlawful act.
Lee.
We committed against a student
or a prospective student of a
public or private postsecondary
educational institution this
conduct creates a substantial
risk of physical or mental
injury.
Mr chairman members of the
committee what.
As the fine is guilty of a petty
misdemeanor and then Mr chairman
you have aggravated the hazing
which is not a lawful act it.
And the person was a student
perspective student of a public
or private post secondary
educational institution.
This because.
Temporary disfigurement
temporary last part of the
functions of any member.
The body of the students are
prospective students
apply meant injury.
All perspective.
It's activated Hazen is guilty
of a misdemeanor Mr chairman and
members of the committee.
This will help raise awareness
about the systemic problem of
is in.
Members of the committee this
bill will serve as a deterrent
to the act of hazing I'm.
Members of the committee in New
Mexico is only one of six states
in the country I'm not without
law therefore Mr chairman my
legislation is to be able to
young people young students yes.
Be aware that New Mexico
is in vero Mr chairman I could
go on and talk about the various
that's that's the current Mr
Chairman just recently two weeks
ago maybe a week and a half ago
at Ohio State University you
have a young man died from
hazing of.
Mr Chairman just last semester
in school.
You had a shooting at New Mexico
State University in regards to
Hazen I Mr chairman I have with
me today.
Representative was my call
sponsor of the bill I'm.
And I also have an expert
witness Meghan Dawsey who I'm so
technical questions Mr chairman
I'd like to turn it over to
Representative night bird thank
you thank you Representative
said Representative Nibert
welcome.
Thank you Mr chair and committee
I have nothing to that
the representative stated at
all.
Thank you have a the answer
witness Megan Dorsey did you
want to say anything.
Good evening Mr chairman members
of the committee thank you very
much for allowing us to debate
this here tonight and I am here
if there any technical
questions.
is there anyone in anybody in
the public setting up to speak
on this.
so let's go to the audience
anybody in the audience want to
testify before against house
bill twenty seven reading the
crime of hazing.
Members of the committee will go
do you know.
Mr chair.
Yes.
I would do that it also.
Okay we have a.
Is there any discussion of the
motion by Senator Stewart
thanks.
Reason I can do it Mr chair is
because it's not a felony.
What such is a misdemeanor Act I
now all the strict consistent
Senator yeah.
Mr chair I I did have this
couple questions Senator
Schmedes go ahead.
Thank you and great to see a
couple of my
Former college in the house so.
thank you for bringing the bill
I on the on section one.
and I have the amendments in
context so sorry I don't the so
on the lines but it says when
when such an act.
Intentionally.
In dangers the physical health.
So did does that mean the hazing
the prosecution has to prove.
That the hazing was designed to
be dangerous to someone's
physical health in order to
convict.
Mr Chairman I will have either
Representative night but and
then making the LFC to respond
please.
Mr chairman and senator.
But the way I view the two is
that one.
Yes sample a wide assault.
There's not any real harm
there's just the the threat or
the.
It potentially endangers out
once you have actual R. then you
step over to the role of
aggravated hazing and that's
where the
Actual harm to the victim of
encouraging the the former is is
look at I like you meant to
assault your it may be reckless
conduct it may have the
potential to to cause harm but
it doesn't actually result of
that are but it is it doesn't
danger them and it does maybe
costs to be humiliated or
otherwise ridiculed in front of
their peers.
Okay and Mr chair and
representative.
So yeah I I think the aggregated
it's clear to me so all my
questions were really just the
the regular hazing not not to
aggravate it doesn't aggravate
it's pretty clear but yes on
that note the humiliating how
would we prove that.
The student was two million.
Well the prosecution would have
to.
Mr chair Senator the prosecution
would have to establish that the
actions of the accused are rose
to the level that they intend
that you know they're gonna have
to have to prove
that the party intended to do
that for their actions and maybe
Mr Stewart C. centuries are does
is a lot more often than I do
which is however.
She she may want to weigh in on
this but but that's how I would
see it is that the prosecution
would have to approve the mental
state that they attended to to
put them in that what is and
that by putting them in that
why is it it.
Could bring them into danger
senator are forcing them to
drink you know two gallons of
water or in the case in Ohio
state alcohol.
Dorsey.
Thank you Representative Nibert
it Mr chairman Senator
communities that's a great
question and just to circle back
briefly to representative Nibert
earlier answer this bill is
structured very similarly to the
assault and battery statutes
currently on New Mexico's books
and and so the the petty agency
had a misdemeanor hazing statute
does have a lesser men's raha a
lesser intends than the
aggravated hazing and creates
the substantial risk of harm to
the actual harm and in practical
matters to answer your question
directly Sir prosecutors would
generally tend to prove that
type of
a fact the humiliation Act
usually by direct testimony from
the victim or survivor
themselves or other people that
observed the contact.
Happening.
Okay thank you that's all that I
had on.
Still a little unclear how we
would.
You know prove humiliation but
I'm I don't think it really.
Hurts the entire build necessary
because there's other options
for that man's right these there
are so okay well thank you
that's all I have cruciatus
Representative thank you senator
term as earlier discussion from
the committee.
But will the committee regarding
house bill twenty seven which
still has.
Bills we.
We have a motion.

Stapleton Representative right
but you have to do past million
three Judiciary.
Yes you Mr chair thank you Mr
chairman and members of the
committee have a good night.
Good evening.
Next next will go to
representatives Romero and
Rubio's bill house bill one
eleven housing discrimination
changes.
Thank you Mr chair we've been
very patient so I so appreciate
it squeezing us in tonight.
and hi everyone thank you for
staying with us on this late
Friday night house bill one
eleven as you know ten times of
the power forty five amended it
is a very very long and arduous
process that we've been on since
March of last year when we were
worried about the fact that many
many New Mexicans may be in
jeopardy of losing their homes.
That said of Mr chair and
members of the committee this
essentially modernizes our
housing law between landlords
and tenants extending
essentially the timelines in
which they can remedy any sort
of issue they may have on
payment of for instance
It clarifies the tenants can
only be charged a late fee for
portion of rent for which
they're responsible for directly
paying additionally it requires
the issuance of receipts for
cash or money order payments in
order to protect landlords and
tenants
we're so on and so forth I don't
want to belabor it's a very long
bill I look for to the questions
essentially it gives more time
for the difference opportunities
that we do have now facing us
with this not only with the
pandemic but the housing crisis
that we were in prior to this
pandemic in finding the proper
remedies for folks to stay in
their home and giving them
enough time in particular
remedying when it comes to rate
source of payment I'm sorry for
for just any sort of payment but
really bringing in money for
landlords and tenants to make
sure that they can pay their
rent that said
madam chair I'm sorry Mr chair
and reserve the committee I'll
defer to my co sponsor
Representative Rubio and with us
we have our experts Maria Griego
with the New Mexico Center for
long poverty and Rachel Biggs
with the with healthcare for the
homeless if they have we have
any technical questions on the
bill thank you Mr chair and I'll
defer to my co sponsor.
Representative Romero
Representative Rubio welcome.
Thank you Mr chair and good
evening everyone I'll just be
really brief and just say that
it's been quite a year of
learning about so much that is
happening within the housing
We'll just housing issues in
general related to look tenants
and landlords and I feel that
what the legislation that you're
seeing before you is is work
that has been done over the
course of the last year that has
even through this last session
has seen a number of evolutions
and so where we're really I feel
like so many people have already
been part of this process and
that
I feel that this is sort of the
beginning of what we believe is
is a real conversation around
housing in the state and how we
address it beyond COVID and and
so we look forward to to
answering any questions that you
might have.
Do you want to say anything on
this scale.
Thank you Mr chair and members
of the committee thank you at
representatives for inviting me
here tonight I I think the
representatives really summed up
the issues of you know just say
echo that we have been in the
housing crisis for years COVID
has only exacerbated the housing
crisis that we've been and and
so this bill is the culmination
of trying to ensure that it
tenants have a way to stay in
their homes during this pandemic
and beyond and also recognizing
that New Mexico is different and
and the rental housing market
are landlords are not like as
the big corporate owners and
other states we have a lot of
pop type landlords and the need
to get paid they rely on rent to
pay their own mortgages and so
this bill really addresses that
by making sure that tenants
For time to pay their rent and
you know allows them to access
housing assistance that they can
get to their landlord so that
the landlords are able to cover
their own costs and with that
also all stand for questions.
Rachel Biggs did you want to say
anything about this.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee I'm just here to
support I was actually gonna
make public comment.
We will start with you on public
comment.
Great thank you so much Mr chair
members of the committee my name
is Rachel Biggs policy director
Albuquerque Health Care for the
homeless a federally qualified
health center serving about
seven thousand individuals
without homes throughout
Bernalillo county we stand
strong support H. B. one eleven
as you heard immediate action is
needed to ensure New Mexicans
can maintain housing and that
landlords can access the
available rental assistance
funds to address rent backlogs
COVID nineteen has increased the
need for rental assistance and
the federal government has
really responded in
unprecedented ways to address
the run back during the diction
moratorium New Mexico recently
received two hundred million
dollars and the recent American
rescue plan act will allocate an
additional twenty billion
dollars and rental assistance
nationwide.
It would be irresponsible to not
address the barriers to spending
this money quickly to ensure
both landlords and tenants.
Additionally the connection
between housing and health care
has never been more evident that
it is now a recent study found a
direct connection between
housing stability and public
health demonstrating that states
that allow deductions to
continue during the pandemic and
at two times higher incidence of
COVID and five times higher
incidence and mortality due to
the pandemic.
We must act now to ensure we can
leverage federal dollars and
help our economy recover as
quickly as possible we urge your
support H. B. one eleven thank
you for your time.
Thank you Rachel I'm gonna just
the Sanchez currently we have a
an amendment for the bill did
you did you bring that to the
committee or or where to that
come from.
Yes Mr chair we do have a an
amendment to clarify some of the
language in the bill
to we entertain that right now
yes yeah let's let's go to war.
Thank you Mr chair so this
amendment essentially just
clarify some of the technical
language that the Head ourselves
confused about in that regard so
this basically just looks at
the state remember.
Version we're we're on at this
point
That it demands
there we are point two version
of of this amendment but I'm I'm
trying to look at the version
that we have that said Mr chair
this is sensually just looks
that
clarifying where the we had a
question on the residents
portion of rent where the fee
would be assessed that we
clarify with this language
secondly
we look at how the message of
delivering a service on a return
payments for deposit would be
the method being used and then
finally that's at this I believe
the same thing on number three
is just clarifying what service
needs of of a delivery of a
payment in clarifying that and
I'll just defer to muddy F. I.
E.
I if there's anything I missed
on the on the amendment.
Thank you at Mr chair and
Representative Romero yes he as
the language in in paragraphs
two and three there that was
really to address that concern
raised by Representative Fajardo
on the house floor originally we
had of the word server there
talking about when
Whether it's must send an
itemized statement detailing all
deductions made from a damage
deposit.
I'm what what they must to send
to the tenants and it was
brought to our attention that
the term serve could be confused
because it is a legal term and
so we worked together with the
apartment association who I
believe is on this call and to
get the language really clear we
worked with them on all these
amendments we we work with and
frankly a lot on this bill
and so but but we just wanted to
make sure that that was really
clear and that landlords know
exactly what they must do so
that it's not and ambiguous
mandate on them.
Chair Mister chair your muted.
The amendment first and then
we'll we'll
You know the rest of the bill so
is there a motion Senator
Sedillo Lopez.
Your muted.
Okay the amendment sensor it's
very late.
The amendment.
There's.
By somebody in senators so I
actually.
Any opposition to the amendment.
She then will will consider the
bills have been amended animal
movement out of public comment
on the amended bill and I have
one person who is going to speak
against this Randy bell there
the the New Mexico association
of realtors.
Yes Mr chairman members of the
committee at thank you for your
time I'm a registered lobbyist
for the New Mexico association
of realtors and we first want to
thank the sponsors for all of
their responsiveness and the
compromises that they've made on
this bill to this point but the
realtors do have a few remaining
concerns with the bill
specifically if you look at page
seven nine six two seven of the
damages for withholding a
deposit have been changed to
double the amount improperly
withheld even though the bad
state requirement was removed.
We feel like this unitive
especially considering a lot of
New Mexicos landlords are the
smaller mom and pop landlords.
Also if you look at page
fourteen lines eight to eleven
this language allows for
retaliation claim by the tenant
against the owner is the tenant
complaints to a utility about
appliances we believe this could
be problematic because many of
these types of complaints don't
result in a red tag our
situation or a situation where
the owner would even know about
the complaint and asked drafted
adjourn it could simply claim
that they made a complaint to
the utility in order to bring
our television claim and then
maintain possession of the
property.
And then finally page seventeen
mines eleven twelve our
districts language requiring the
court to reset a postponed
action for possession within
seven days which would
technically allow the court to
extend trial on an action for
possession indefinitely.
We would be more comfortable
with a fixed time frame for
tribal rescheduling a budget
increase from the seven days
because the civil dockets of the
courts can be very busy and that
this could really make it
difficult for a lot of owners to
regain possession of their
property thank you for your
time.
Thank you.
Now we have a number of people
who signed up I'm I'm gonna ask
you to just take no more than
one minute each please at this
hour if you are here and a
listing of the names and and and
go through the I'm just pretty
much.
Legislative research already
this Thomas here.
Yes Mr Mr Chairman on and and
senators
I'm Tom pretty much the managing
attorney of New Mexico legal
eight Albuquerque office and I'm
here to answer any questions
about the bill we worked really
hard with members of at
university Mexico school law the
the legal services community the
apartment association and their
internet and
of the State of Albuquerque to
try to come up with the bills
that this balanced and
recognizes all folks interests I
think it's a good bill and I'm
I'm happy to answering
questions.
Thank you Mr chairman recently
followed by right here.
Thank you Mr chair members of
the committee my name is Bree
celery and I represent the New
Mexico coalition to end
homelessness I'm here to urge
this important quick passage of
house bill one eleven the
extension of time frames and
balancing of tenant protections
is important to addressing the
systemic flow of people into
homelessness as it allows for
realistic time frames and
applying for rental assistance
this is important not just
because of the pending eviction
crisis that's predicted with the
release of the eviction
moratorium but also because it
is a critical step for housing
continuum to develop better
systems to intervene before
people are affected as people
slip from housing insecurity and
homelessness it becomes
exponentially more difficult to
recover financially and
emotionally this is Sam
legislation that allows for the
development of the systems to
increase community stability
throughout New Mexico thank you.
Thank you.
Right here I don't see him in
but he signed a release a medium
you may have gone to bed
already.
No I'm here your.
Whether you are
going to bed but I'm still here.
Good evening Mister chair
members of the committee my name
is Kirk record on the director
Liz when apps administrative of
New Mexico we also speak tonight
on behalf New Mexico conference
of churches well simply begin by
stating that we believe housing
is a fundamental human right and
we support all policy that
supports the creation of
affordable housing in the
preservation of housing while we
are disappointed that the
creation of a statewide housing
council has been amended out we
certainly do support the
critical need to improve the
balance of rights between
landlords and tenants and we
believe that the extensions made
to the notice non payment of
rent and the hearing timelines
are entirely reasonable in in
the big picture will not bring
any further harm landlords but
could make all the difference in
keeping a family or an
individual from falling into
homelessness well there are a
variety of avenues that must be
pursued to address both the
systemic issue issues in the
current emergency of housing H.
B. one eleven we'll allow for
many positive steps be taken and
therefore I urge your support
for a three to eleven thanks for
this opportunity thank you Mr

housing that because of their
low income because they have
disabilities and also because of
the disabilities themselves that
sometimes cause difficulties I
want to speak in favor of the
house bill one eleven for many
reasons one so important one is
the presumption of retaliation
because I hate myself given that
I work directly with these
people have seen many cases
where people have
local or assistance because of
her fair housing issues
reasonable accommodations and
have the item at the next month
or the next two months been
received by eighty and the
least notice and non renewal of
lease and it's very difficult
for these people they live in
fear a lot of our let me just
say a lot of our.
Especially people with
disabilities live in fear so
thank you very much for
listening to me.
Right yes
Jareth or I guess it's Bill
Jordan for very long.
Thank you Mr chairman you caught
that I am filling in for Derek
lan I am Bill Jordan with New
Mexico voices for children and I
want to thank Representative
Romero Rubio for sponsoring this
legislation we believe it's
essential that we update our
housing laws to improve the
balance between the rights of
landlords and the rights of
tenants so families who can pay
rent and comply with their lease
are not evicted this is
especially timely bill given the
housing crisis so many New
Mexico families are facing New
Mexico has a critical shortage
of affordable housing the crisis
of homeless for us that is
likely to get worse so we
appreciate that this legislation
creates a housing council to
coordinate housing policy and
resources we encourage your
support thank you.
Housing council.
Yes it's out on the floor okay.
Randy trainer I think you the
last one is sign of relief who
still here yes Mr chair thank
you Mr chairman committee
members Randy Traeger
representing the apartment
association of New Mexico
I testified in opposition to
this bill in two different
committees however yes we were
able to send a table as equals
we were able to come up to
position support this was a good
experience the apartment
association supports health bill
one left thank you thank you
Randy.
Members of the committee we are
here now.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Here we are muted Senator here.
Thank you Mr chair
I really appreciate this bill
because it is it was well
written it's not a whole bunch
of legalese and that will really
help tenants and landlords
navigate it without having to
get an attorney so I I that is
just such a strength of this
bill I do want to ask you and
and honestly with all the
amendments and substance I I got
a little lost so I finally just
found of the the amendments in
place and that was very helpful
because it was confusing before
I got there and but I did want
to ask you why was the council
stricken out.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
senator for that question so
essentially we spoke directly
with the governor's office
originally back into the
November iteration of when we
were negotiating getting a
council done there was a full
time position that had been
possibly.
Wanted to this council from the
governor's office and upon the
many other iterations about how
we were going to configure the
council itself
we felt and the governor's
office felt that it would be
better for us to kind of be
supported by their office but
not necessarily have to have any
bottle necking with all of the
appointments that the governor's
office has to make in regards to
these different councils
but of course you know playing
favorites on the folks who are
meant to be appointed to the
council so gives us the economy
really to get started right away
with many of the issues that we
are are dealing with when it
comes to housing and and we're
working with the UNM School of
law as you know the clinic is
very very active in these issues
and so we're hoping that we can
really start as soon as session
is over to get the council
started in and really start
working on these policy
initiatives immediately with all
the configurations that come
from the previous at you know
documentation and and iterations
that we had gone through
statutorily.
Thank you Mr chair I think this
bill really addresses a looming
problem it's very specific and
that is when the moratorium ends
it will help for bill smooth the
transition for a lot of people
and I want to give a shout out
to Randy trainer I we worked
with him on the domestic
violence and of leasing bill a
couple years ago and got some
good suggestions that made it
work from from that side as well
because one of the things I
learned from Randy is landlords
don't want to have a mess either
they they'd rather just have a
tenant they can stay and pay the
rent and and so they they of
this actually I think it's been
a lot of ways empowers them and
empowers the the the tenants I
also really like the idea that
the courts will be giving out
housing information
for the evictions and they're
just many strings with this bill
I compliment you
So thank you I am looking
forward to supporting this bill.
Senator Cervantes.
Thank you Mr chair
You can hear me now
And thank you Representative how
to just a couple questions.
On this
section six.
And I don't know if this is a
technical saying or or what but
in my question pertains to
retaliation.
So my understanding is a
resident to improve retaliation
if they satisfied both item one
and item two.
It is that correct.
Mr chair I will defer to my
experts money.
Thank you Mr chair and Senator
Schmedes it it's it's a little
bit more complicated than that
Senator Schmedes
and this was again something we
we worked out at this language
is quite a bit is this went
through several interest several
iterations and I believe it was
the general counsel for the
apartment association that ended
up at proposing the final burden
shooting requirement here and so
what would be required is that
if if any of those things
happened so if it was in the
previous six months in any of
those retaliatory acts
Happened and then and then there
is a court hearing
the tenants explains to the
judge.
Here's what happened that I
think is at retaliatory and then
the then the burden shifts to
the property owner to say no
here's my valid legally.
Acceptable reason for doing what
I did and then the burden shifts
back again to the tenet to prove
that what the land the reason
the landlord is given is is pre
textual
And so I really you know it
originally we didn't have that
burden shifting in there and it
was pointed out that that could
be a difficult hurdle for
landlords
To get passes so we we did work
with the apartments at station
on that language.
Okay thank you but I I'm really
just looking for a simpler more
simple answer it just to make
sure I'm I'm with you Mr chair
and and Representative expert so
I'm on I'm on section six it
says a resume for retaliation
yes in the number one and number
two so if they satisfy both
number one and number two.
The resident may be able to
prove may prove retaliation it
is I mean that's is that right.
To Senator Mr chair Senator
Schmedes so we just basically
one and two but at the to has a
very it has a list of
contingencies as to what that
would how they would facility
and to.
Okay so Mister chair and and
representative of so so what
I'm.
So now that I understand that
what I'm what my
My question is is it says.
that the owner so that that they
can prove retaliation if an
owner increases wrecked right so
this is a concern is it owners
increasing rent to like punish
unfairly or something so they
they choose to increase rents.
And so we have satisfied
condition number one.
Now we have to satisfy condition
number two also to prove Italian
ation and I go down and I see.
That you had it just they
complained to a water utility
company.
So my my concern is that we can
satisfy both number one and
number two under the following
conditions the number one the
owner increases rents.
And number two the tenant had
complained cool water utility
company so my my my concern is
what if the owner just increased
rent just because you know
things got more expensive in the
residents made a complaint to
water utility company but it was
I mean they just made the
complaint you know wasn't maybe
was on found it so now we
satisfied both number one and
number two although really.
The increase in rent was not a
retaliation for that complaints
to the water utility company the
the complaint could have been.
You know rejected by the water
so the committee could have been
unfounded and if we look at the
original language what I like
about the original language that
was struck it says.
They're gonna bring action for
position be because the resident
did this so it kind of connects
what the resident is doing to
the the threat by the land board
and now I feel like we've kind
of that because has been taken
out.
In all we have to do is have a
situation where rent has been
increased.
In a a complaint has been made
and now we satisfied both of
those conditions to do so my
concern is.
Thank.
Mr chair thank you Senator
smitteez so as far as what we
clarify with the language the
cause is not necessarily it
removed I think from your
concern as far as what we're
getting at with adding what
we're adding in this
of retaliation complaint list so
there's you still have to prove
it you still go before a judge
you still have to be able to get
a determination with with the
both and so as far as you know
what you would need to prove in
that situation it is still
connected to the initial of
problem which could be a raise
in rent along with the other
things so Madam Mr chair I've I
believe that that you know
there's no difference as far as
what the cause would yield with
or without it but I'll defer to
my experts if there's any.
If I'm misinterpreting what your
question is
and Senator I just I just.
Just look and see and be on the
next page.
By.
And all this does is set up the
the the the framework in which
the four will have to decide
but.
This so.
Did you want to comment on that.
Thank you Mr chair and so
Senator communities that's
correct and and I apologize that
I jumped the gun earlier when
you were looking for a simple
question but that's what I was
trying to get at is that if we
take the example you gave Mister
chairman Senator cities where
there has been a rent increase
and that is within that you know
within the six months that eight
tenant has complaints to utility
company about a non functioning.
At appliance or something I'm
and they could they go to court
and that the tenant says.
At the landlord is retaliating
against me because I complained
to utility company and then they
raise rents will then the court
is going to go through an
analysis and and request
testimony and so at that point
it'll be the latter can simply
say no I raise rent because my
expenses have increased and and
can provide proof for or yes.
Yes money and then it goes back
to the to the tenant to stay
that's B. no no that's not right
that's a potential reason given
evidence okay okay I got you
okay so I don't mean to cut you
off I just know it might my
answers my questions been
answered so I just wanted it
because it's late and I yes
thank you so much I'm not trying
to be rude and then my my last
question is in section eleven
but yeah that makes sense so a
similar thing similar thing in
section eleven what we're doing
here and I I I definitely you
know like the intent we're doing
here is we're saying you you
cannot
you know terminate ranch.
Really really for for any reason
during an emergency.
But do we I just I don't see
anything in here that says that
the the tenant.
Was affected by the emergency
meeting I I guess I guess what
what the assumption here is that
there is an emergency and that
people have they've had a hard
time they've you know they've
lost their job or their their
their movement has been
restricted but.
But some people you know some
people have done well I mean
people that are delivering food
online orders I have a local
quilt store here that's like
blooming right now because they
said people just think it all
more so you know and I think of
the home improvements you know
people are doing well so do we
do we need to prove that the
tenants has been.
Or or show that they've been
affected in a negative way so
that their rents can't be that
the rental agreement can't be
terminated or or or or do you do
not share your do you think
that's unnecessary.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
senators so this is very much
attached to our current health
order in the moratorium that
currently exist reading do have
to prove that you have been
negatively affected by the
situation for lack of payment if
you look at the languages
specifically talk about
quarantine specifically talks
about a health crisis in order
that we're currently in and
there's definitely protections
for those who own properties and
and what they want to will with
it as well so you know we feel
that the language is very
strongly related to what the
current situation is and why
it's the emergency order
requesting an extension on so
that folks can perhaps extend
their leases after the
moratoriums should they be able
to negotiate that with their
landlords.
Yeah I just Mr Mr chair and
representative I guess my
concern there is with the long
you know with the emergence is
last in a long long time.
if for some reason the owner.
For for some other reason wants
to terminate the rental not
renew it.
and the tenant really hasn't
been negatively affected.
I thought they should have the
right the owner should have the
right to not renew unless you
know like I said I want to
protect the person that has just
suddenly lost their job or
something that's great I think
that this section does that.
But I don't know.
If I see it there that they were
protecting the owner.
From from not renewing.
When the tenant actually hasn't
been affected by the declared
emergency.
So Mister chair thank you
senator I would just direct you
to a section to see of the areas
on the good faith effort that
we're asking landlords just
follow just to be sure that you
know when we're looking at
protecting folks and their
housing what we're asking folks
to shelter in place and their
after that we're just asking
landlords to acting.
Okay.
Okay thank you Mr Mr chair that
that's all thank you senator

Colleges for that thank you Mr

our last bill of the night is
we've saved the best for last.
Representative Armstrong
welcomed to the committee.
Thank you Mr chair and members
the committee yes you save the
best for last so feel free to us
to do a do pass at any time.
it is our house bill one twenty
three is would allow
municipalities and counties I in
consultation with and under the
guidance of the department of
health to adopt an ordinance to
establish
and operate overdose prevention
programs.
And overdose prevention program
provides.
A safe space for individuals to
commit to consume pre obtained
substances under the supervision
of by trained staff provide
access to referrals for
substance use treatment.
or other medical services and
monitor individuals and
intervene to prevent overdoses
this is a really this is a
cutting edge a program that is
we would actually be the first
state
in the country if we passed this
not the first US city there are
few cities that have
enacted ordinances and are in
the process of establishing
programs but this is yes in many
countries around there a lot of
programs around the world and
one item in particular that
we've looked at a lot is
Vancouver and Mr chair and other
members of the of the Committee
may remember during interim
committees we have talked about
this kind of a program and a
couple years ago I think your
before last we had a
presentation
we were an early user of zoom we
had a presentation from a
program in Vancouver to our
interim committee there is lots
of
studies in your research and
Articles peer reviewed articles
on the effectiveness of these
programs and reducing overdose
intervening and reducing the
incidence of
communicable diseases such as
HIV aids and help C..
And in are actually reducing
a drug use by
getting people into treatment
programs offering other social
supports I as well and a
decrease in
it and in that criminal activity
as it relates to using drugs on
the street if you will so unless
needles in the parks and
analyses and and less of drug
use are out in public because
it's done safely in those in
some place that's supervised.
And I have with me Emily
Kaltenbach from drug policy
alliance and I think with that
Mr chair will stand for
questions right do you want to
say anything earlier you just
available for questions.
Hey welcome I have a couple of
people who signed up with them I
think the others are all falling
asleep or had to go home to take

Trujillo either is still away or

of some Fernando what what do
you want to say about this.

from Espanola New Mexico and I
am a policy for a with bold
futures from the young woman
United I currently reside in
Albuquerque.
Just by your lan the villages
that surround it have had to
deal with substance dependence
issues for generations even
before what we now call that
opioid epidemic for years
families and loved ones have
pleaded for help instead have
suffered for the
criminalization because at one
time it was the and the rest of
both situations even called nine
one one if someone had no one
who was overdosing not to
mention the state what they
might say the same about by
society in general has for the
push people who use substances
and a gallon behind locked doors
in order to get their fix so
that they can get through the
day as twenty one years old when
I lost the person I love most in
this world to an overdose I
really believe it people had a
seat please to go where they
could be surrounded by trained
professionals really contest the
substance and where they can
have their lives saved by the I
have you know pristine around
them by having the sites they
would be access to resources and
