Between the.
Psychiatrists in the
psychologist over prescribing.

Many were the abortion better.
So public health and health
facilities comes here.

Anything dealing with public.
Attend in this committee I just
want to be clear we we tend to
cover every bill that's referred
to it I know there's some
chairman that that that just say
you know we can't do a good job
on this enormous.
We'll pick and choose in this
committee because were the
starting point for most
legislation.
We don't do that we just will
give every commit every bill a
hearing it may be a very short
hearing that will give them a
chance late in the session we
may have to start meeting
as the money.
Because we meet in the
afternoon.
It's hard to see exactly when we
start.
Usually it's half hour after the
floor but the floor can be
it's a very flexible concept the
floor they can end at six and
then we started six thirty we'll
try to have a meal here if we

taken care of now we'll move
into the agenda for the meeting
today in the first build up
members of let me explain about
these agreed.
When we have bills that are
largely just an appropriation.
There's more than one for
put it on a grid and what that
means is we don't.
We don't have a lot to analyze
other than just.
And so we'll have a presentation
but then will go through rather
quickly it will take minimal
input from the public or against
it.
And then we'll go to you can
don't feel like you can ask
questions.
Take too long on it because we
know that the real issu.
This was the finance.
Senator rodriguez will start
with you your bill a senate bill
seven the housing trust
performed is on the is the first
item of.
Bended down.
There's is not played in concern

In every year.
Thank you senator yes mister.
We have to do mister chairman

Thank you
knows with.
Mfa is just one year shy have
been a f.
Have a very strong over.
Advisory committee.
Plus programs.
In the majority of the folks
that we help.
I've ensured that the funds that
you've been trusted as with over
the years are put to work and
invested in the communities
across the state we are proud.
Committed to projects
of the sixty one million dollars
in this is prior to the record.
We've assisted over.
Help families and individuals
there is a great need for h.
Beneficial.
Mister chairman members of the
committee thank you very much
for allowing me to speak today
my name is joseph monta
I am the deputy.
It's my squeaky voice actually
wished to speak to you in favor
of this bill I represent the
city about representative
hasn't collaborative.
About the turkey working
together to be able to pro.
To be able to move forward with
the type of housing that we
would l.
And in addition what we would
also like for you to consider is
a portion of this funds to go
directly to
his powers units of what the
government I think this will
have the benefit of leveraging
even more money.
Assistance with a matching funds
matching funds and there has the
ability to.
It's my sweet voice I was in a
ban for a long time.
Um but this would have the
advantage of also getting
displays throughout the state
and mexico involved in the
development of affordable
housing because this is a
statewide problem in our creak
alone we are needed again that's
like thirty thousand units of
housing but this problem is the
stamic within the whole state we
believe getting this powered is
incentive to be able to
participate in the development
design and finance of housing
would be beneficial but that
allowed though I do support this
bill and we wanna make sure it
happens.
Good afternoon that chairman or
dc no e and members of the
committee I wanted to speak in
favor of the disbell you all
will have received a packet via
email from me
some time in the new hour and
you will not on the front page
that this is our absolute top
priority of and there is a a
large group of housing
organizations
there are scores non profits
primarily nonprofits and we made
on monday mornings at ten am and
you will see later on in that
packet the letter that we sent
to lfc requesting that we didn't
have a bill number then but
requesting five hundred million
to
mf to the new mexico housing
trust fund and
wanted to point that out that
there are many many and support
of this and and that also in in
terms of my own organization
which is now a nonprofit new
mexico eviction prevention and
diversion
we would prefer that funding
goes through mfa as well who
was finding appropriate to
continue the program last year
but it will never flowed through
and.
We now understand that mfa has
been it is a long time and
really
can do that
and I would point out I was
lucky enough to attend the msa
board meeting earlier this week
and I was amazed that you know
they've had clean audits for
twenty seven years and was
really impressed by the
professionalism of their staff
so I
hope that you will support this
bill and.
And then i'll just put out a
terms for our program any pd the
if the appropriate is from the
general fund it can help to
restart the eviction prevention
program it and not out of the
service severance tax bond peace
of it
thank you.
Thank you winter next is hank
hues.
The.
The.
We're waiting for you.
The.
Can you hear me now yeah we can
hear you know.
Okay great yeah I just want to
say santa fe county I i'm a
county commissioner share of the
santa fe county commission and
we voted a few months ago to
support funding for the housing
trust fund for all the reasons
stated santa fe county strongly
supports this bill thank you.
Thank you hank next is she'll be
greezer.
The.
Good afternoon mister chairman
members of the committee my name
is i'll be greaser i'm with new
mexico voices for children and
we stand in strong support of
this bill as it is an important
part of the overall strategy to
address the housing crisis thank
you.
Very well okay we'll turn out to
members of the committee any
questions for the sponsor yes
senator so the olympics.
Thank you mister chair I think
this is.
It under homeless the table one
home is prevention
it says the
it's fantasti.
How do you come to.
This is a an est.
On the cost.
The savings that it would take
from housing somebody in
housing.
I just.
Mr chairman and senator us to
the olympics I I apologize.
So this is based on the
individuals that are helped
with.
Yes.
Thank you mister
center for ring forty.
You taught us last year that
when we don't.
Percentage of that.
This.
Yeah.
Because if we are no because if
we're if we're gonna mark from
the s t b's and we don't use
this tv then there's no
airmarket.
The.
Experience on his issues
but i'm looking at the FIR.
Seventeen years.
Huge.
Is that due to a program because
people are paying.
Difference between that.
Over the last year we received
an additional.
Leveraging federal reso.
The program income which is.
Correctly that isn't tax credit
money.
That that is correct federal low
income housing tax credits are
up a big.
It looks like.
As benef.
The.
Is that about what you're.
Household.
Household.
A big greater.
Trying to do.
You're two and a half percent
set aside how much recurring how
much will that generate what do
you think.
To follow up and send you my
cuttings question when you.
Opened the transfer up to
something beyond just housing
construction did it do does it
now include.
Infrastructure in the sense of
getting the.
Utility lines and the and the
streets and curbs out.
The funds are eligible.
Operating.
To be able to because we know
the governor has a bill that
would that would use part of the
money for.
I think we haven't seen the bill
but the way she described it to
extend the lines out to these
developments what would it take
for these funds to be able to do
that since this is all state
money.
Mr chairman it would just.
It is very expensive
kind of focused our funding on
the housing itself and
infrastructure o.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mister chairman of my curtain
the new metric or housing trust.
We have not used.
Provides.
Which are targeted.
Currently.
A forty two unit project.
On his individuals in.
Rep around services that go with
them and then we recently closed
on a loan.
That would total to.
Permanent support of housing
units a little over a hundred
units.
We have a motion for a due pass
from senators said the el.
In the other discussion.
Senator.
Senator.
The.
Yes.
So senator you have on six sixty
six to three vote you ever do
pass thank you mister chairman
but like in finance they're
tough o.
Through the vice.
Administering the this
multi million dollars there is
it did you want to say anything.
Yes thank you mister chairman I
will say that the majority of
these.
Local governments and
implementing.
There's been thirty.
The.
Towards that effort
unfortunately it's about.
Thank you members of the
committee and his pino i'm not
opposed to affordable housing.
Sometimes these projects tend to
be.
One of the projects.
Currently has.
Whatever projects we do with
them and they funding which that
was one I was formally on wells
perk neighborhood board and we
did have to go into a good
neighbor agreement with the city
value to support that and
brilliant county I just won it
premise it with they have to be
good neighbors i'm all in
supporter for affordable housing
behavioral health treatment but
at the end of the day we want
those are facilities to be
to be card missing of some of
the inh.
With untreated illnesses they
can cost issues to the
businesses and surrounding
neighbors so that's my only
point thank you so much.
Ten million.
Village and it is located in
albert.
Mister chairman there
is hopefully general current.
The.
Yeah center my stuff yes.
Neighbor.
The.
Yes senator tommin.
Yeah.
Demonstrated subtentional cost.
The criminalization of.
Forging productive
relationships on all stake who
have an interest in the welfare.
Program.
Community.
Recovery center.
And gained immediate knowledge.
The did you want to have your
expert witness says.
I'd like to.
The.
The.
We've got to raise the bo.
And substance.
I acknowledge doctors meeting.
Medical research.
Working in.
For medical school sec.
Some of my mentors including
doctor mark brand have started
pharmaceuticals.
From my standpoint.
At the heart of solving any
problem the.
I want to say that.
Many m.
Numerous judges district attor.
We came across.
Three documents I always look to
lfc I strongly encourage the
discussion continues with.
The assistant director.
I.
If you look at the progress
report from august.
It really lays it out.
See reports for the past.
But not many results.
And i'd also like to say that
yesterday.
Independent group.
Mexico typically minus the forty
four.
With several.
The.
That a group actually made r.
The.
Your physical impact.
Report that says we're not
asking for enough money
it basically referred to you
and.
My question w.
Basically.
Through an rfp process through
the leg.
The.
A study.
The statute.
We're talking not just
behavioral help.
In about eight.
Twenty one to.
The amount of.
They are actually.
I want it.
The supreme court commission in
mental health.
We do have AP.
Addressing.
Supreme court if new mexico.
The.
Thank you.
Let's go to the audience anybody
in the audience want to speak on
this bill.
Either for.
Thank you.
Look on this.
The thousands.
The.
Basically.
The thousand dollars is.
There's no question.
The.
The.
Time that both attitudes.
Yeah.
Radically changed a lot of their
approaches and so we may have a
lot.
The.
The.
Is a state.
As.
I don't know what happened to.
Go ahead and if I know I was
just massive yep
center hickey and and senator
said the lopest.
Endorse that bill which is a
bill to expand the training
opportunities behavioral health
because it we have the
facilities.
But we don't have the staff we
we don't get anywhere.
Work.
Then we need the facilities that
would servi.
Study of of how they are
mentioned.
The.
This is talking about the.
I read the letter that was
handed out and I agree.
It is obvious that it's deeply
be weldering and I guess what I
want to be sure is that in this
bill.
We're not creating opinion.
In the b.
The.
Years ago.
Peer prof.
Professionals are the key.
Two survive that constant
engagement.
Thank you.
Yeah it's an endorsement of a
hundred thousand out of it just
this to.
The courts part of it is very
important.
But.
As we learned that the childhood
welfare.
A lot of this goes back to how
we approach early childhood I
see why the aces and so on and
so.
Tried to look at problems of
what caused him when we when you
fill the union back what's at
the core what can we understand
about the court that will
leverage all the layers around
it rather than what we mostly do
which is addressed when they are
at a time and without I
identify.
I.
The.
Some.
Or.
Really childhood.
The **** their prevention go to
the core of the.
If we don't include that in our
overall.
That we bring in the.
The learnings that we've had in
the imp.
I just what i've learned when I
went to the gateway center.
Colleagues based upon my own
family's lived experience you
don't get sopriety without a
year or so variety and i've been
corrected.
Because you don't have a chance.
It's now you don't get sobriety
without eighteen months.
Whether rtc overh.
But eighteen months is the
minimum of society they have a
ch.
Start to try and get our arms
around that that we do this in a
way.
That goes back to whether the
what are the car.
Families growing up they have a
lot of.
And in nicotine addiction if you
are so unblessed to have.
Yeah.
We know where the receptors for
nicotine and ireland how large
they are you know and some of us
have a lot of it and a lot of
his don't and you know how to
sack him in the place.
We don't we don't create a
losing if we just clean up our
loss.
And overall.
Experience.
Fifteen minutes of.
Being able to identify the
ongoing learning.
Passion.
My children experiences and.
Senator masters.
For your work I it's hard enough
to pass a bill.
How much less to create
institution.
I just want to come in.
There's some
the first half of the bill is
awesome as chairman are told
because we need to do this a lot
in our statutes
to do an academic review of.
Of our.
Statutes because they're all
over the ma.
The.
Actually had a bill mister
chairman center comma that the
created a reviser of statutes.
The necessarily changed policy
just just fixed statutes and
modernised them but it also says
mr chairman are tomorrow and.
You know fix the statutes but
also consider the intercept
model i'll be heavier health
care and that's the policy
choice you know as the policy
choice and.
Think.
A step in the right direction.
It's very difficult to.
The.
So to fix the statute but then
allow us to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Next upon the agenda we have a
senate build thirty thr.
Members of the committee this
bill
was endorsed.
Simply appropriates in
additional ten million d.
Six million go for the
children's fund four million.
They still license.
Where the trust carried them for
a while but we need more money
be up then that but they also
get money from merge licenses
but as we all know merge
licenses becoming a thing of the
past so the way we wanted.
One time in fusion of cash into
the fund.
The.
They don't spend the corp.
The.
Project.
The.
Innovat.
One year fun when your projects
the ideas that the successful w.
Himstros.
The.
Thank you senator.
I just want to mention that in
addition to.
The.
License plates
that the children trust when
board.
Started a marketing plan.
I had wonderful cooperation with
the motor vehicl.
The.
Auto dealer.
To
allow us to have our right cards
at their dealerships and posters
during the month of april which
is child abused prov.
We also are trying to increase
the.
Our license plates when we
started.
Years ago.
So we are tr.
To increase the number of
people.
The.
The.
Seriously tackle that issue.
The.
The.
Goal of reserving the.
Because they don't.
If you're not spending it.
It stays there gener.
The.
So right now it's four hundred
thousand.
Yes.
Mister chair according to the.
Financial people we would get
about two hundred and seventy
thousand additional dollars per
year in income from the six
million dollars put into the
children's trust funding down.
And then about a hundred and
eighty thousand dollars.
The.
And the next generat.
Stream of.
License.
Your entire
granting.
The.
Center mechanic yes senator
neighbor.
You pass.
Mr chairman center city
the amendments are s.
The.
Mr chair this this bill was a
product of a two year study
that was I believe it was senate
memorial fifty.
The.
That the bill needed updating
that our family.
And this was really a
highlighted yesterday last year
when the supreme court
graduated search.
So a lie of work has gone into
this bill the committee that.
Judges hearing officers
advocates it was a very.
And the
the whole it it looks like a
very large document.
Only because of the name changed
from them family violence
protection act pava protection
against abuse and violence act
and the the it's that's to
capture th.
Then just intimate partner abuse
in the home and there are two
two pieces.
Every time family.
That's why it's so fat.
But if you go to page twenty
nine that's really the first
sumstance.
Updates and modernize the
definitions of abuse and very
significant significantly.
And this is really important
because abuse of animals is very
closely connected to domestic
violence in often s.
And the stress that is put into
the abuse.
Intimidating the partner so
another thing that is new here
is threats to disclose
immigration status I worked I
was the exec.
And there was a very common way
or.
If they were married to the.
Yeah.
The.
Threatening.
In which.
And
so that's that in I i'm happy to
answer questions where we get to
it the other the next
substantive
change in the bill is on page
thirty credible threat is now
defined as your world were call
in two thousand nineteen
when there was an amendment to
the family violence protection
act that.
Yeah.
And basically it was to
recognize the fact that it is
five times more likely that
there will be a mer.
And but what we didn't do in
that bill was.
Around the state some individual
some judges would say.
Oh my god there's a gun in th.
The.
And some judg.
The.
And so there wasn't consistent.
And the other thing that had
defined incredible threat does
is I think it prepares us for if
there is but we have.
This definition of credible
threat I believe well satis.
The.
And basically that's what.
Is they have the action and then
tied with fear and so those two
things are are connected but and
as it has you seen picture to a
conditioner situation because
it's a reasonable person based
on.
Safety or the physical safety of
another and maybe demonstrated
by evidence of the statement
and.
That's to deal.
And then.
On.
Yeah.
I on page thirty five
makes it clear that miners.
Adds miners to the protection.
And also allow some.
Definitely it has definitions.
It's clarified in independent
understanding of.
And that's really important.
Yeah.
On page forty one.
It's it this is very important
sometimes an individual filt.
And they don't allege facts
sufficient enough to grab the
order of protection.
And it may be because they're
not.
They're afraid.
Yeah.
Is there.
The.
This is to give the court
authority to.
But this is actually.
That.
Ordering.
The re.
Instead of using victim.
To go to treatme.
And that's not.
Yeah.
First basic safety issue.
The.
Yeah.
Forty four.
Federal law.
The.
What they're act.
Eight this morning I told them
he I I think we're on today.
Yet some of the individuals.
They
they were the group the conveni.
So that's the goal I was.
Let's go to the audience is
there anyone here who wants to
speak and support it.
Okay three of you so we'll hear.
The.
We had over the years.
But everybody got there.
We hear.
Thank you linda yes.
Three very very quick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right now across judicial
district.
Or child abuse maybe because of
confirmation.
Yeah.
Running through.
Abuse.
Yeah.
And we do have mariel in garcia
and zoom.
Go ahead
can you hear me mister thank you
mr chairman thank you members of
the committee thank you so much
and thank you senators of the
old best i'm married along our
car am the managing and policy
director at the new mexico
coalition against domestic wells
and I was the senator lopez
indicated and the individual at
the crime victims are bracing
commission who spent almost
three years senator lopez
working with over thirty
professionals spending over
seven hundred hours of
incredibly passionate
conversations around improving
but improving the services just
arrivers of intimate partner and
sexual violence throughout the
state in a mexico aren't thirty
two programs stand in full
support of all of the work that
came out of this I have to say
that this is probably one of the
most by partisan efforts i've
ever witnessed where there were
p says every single sentence
every single comma every single
word was looked at through the
lens of survivor
safety offender accountability
and true accessibility in the
sense of um ensuring that a
language access access for are
undocumented survivors access
for individuals with pets are
really thought after and looking
at why what we need to change
the name and so we stand in full
support of this uh we commend
the senator and all of those
who've put a lot of tireless
effort into it to to support
survivors here in mexico so
thank you for your time
and thank you for the platform
to allow us to be on zoom as we
are such a large state and
sometimes it's hard to get to
senator so again thank you for
this platform as well.
Well thank you very much miss
garcia.
Is there any I forgot to ask if
there's any opposition to this
in the audience or.
The.
Okay now we'll go to the
amendment.
Inserting a definition of animal
yes
met.
Yes the amendment is to insert
on page thirty between lines
twenty twenty one animal means
any wild or domestic.
In which way service senator
well know the there is not a
human being the setting is not.
The.
In any.
Mr chair I think.
Is a common definition of
animal.
Yeah
the reason it's import.
But what happened but what's
important.
When.
Yeah.
Can be extremely lenipulative.
And.
Maybe.
I'm not sure about any setting
that is not a human being but
any wild of domestic farners.
I don't want to definition
limited to just pets and that
was the clear consensu.
And if you
use your argument.
It says control of.
So so you're not even you're not
even covering.
Are not kept on the lease but.
I think.
A virus mi.
Probably get.
Sir.
Animals are not included.
The.
Absolutely an in thank you
mister show the other thing is
on page forty three that's
giving the cour.
Where where it's important is in
the.
The definition of abuse is.
Okay.
So there's two pieces one is.
Did the perpetrator harm and
animal and is that couple did
that that harm.
Is that coupled.
Figure out whe.
With regard to custody of
course.
That peace of great where that.
A limited issue that's whether
the court will grant.
You're basically saying that.
I don't think.
Senator smith thank you mister.
The.
Seventeen says kept.
The.
If you're going out.
You need to.
But I I don't think you can fit.
Sender neighbor.
You know if if you say what wild
animal ca.
The.
Thank you both with the
intentions.
The.
Mister center the and that that
I I get you in in that fits
with.
Yeah.
I agree with you on th.
Thank you.
The.
However it.
The.
Violenc.
Oh I was.
The.
I think i'm.
I think there's no there's no
next.
The radically ex.
The.
So what I would suggest.
Any setting.
Or threatened.
The.
No i'm not arguing.
Your.
Hunting and animal does harm
what kills it and kills it that
harms at a lot but but what i'm
seeing is.
Right now it's as harm.
And then you want to put in and
I agree with the point.
The.
Um.
So I think the word in any
setting should should be there.
For what purpose similar to.
You know there's a distinction
between a cowboy.
Throwing a rock through his tv
every every january and and and
harming and and breaking a tv to
have power in control over your
spouse yes so that's as my point
and so what I would suggest is
that you consider an amendment
that that reads harmor
threatened harm to an animal in
any setting.
I'm just i'm just letting her
know that.
The.
The right I agree with the
sentiment of the.
Currently.
I am.
Yes.
Why.
The.
Or pattern of stalking.
Private investment.
Where is it.
The private.
The.
It depends out what.
If the.
Defending themselves let's say
there was a petition for
restraining order.
Because I believed he was
cheating and I was just going to
be.
It there should be.
The person.
The.
Then.
If it's just to.
The.
And that's what.
The frank brought up the
stocking statute thank you.
Knowingly pursuing a pattern of
conduct.
Without look laughable authority
which I guess gets the.
The.
When the person intends that the
pattern of conduct would place
the.
Confinement.
Or restraint at the end of.
So that's what I could
definition of stocking it.
The.
So then.
And then we get over.
Circumstances to fear for the
person.
See reasonable.
The.
Yes.
But just away.
I thought there may be.
Yeah.
The.
And page thirty.
The.
But no.
If that's thirty seven.
Yeah.
And that is usually.
Yeah.
The.
That's why.
The.
Await so important to have the.
Yeah.
The.
And we should.
And so i.
Thank you mister chairman thank
you center city location
congratulations on a message is
this.
The.
So i'll try to be quick but.
At first I was.
Kind of tight for changing the
name of the act but it's but
it's not.
The.
But i'll get to the policy ch.
The.
But it's incredibly difficult
almost impossible.
To get a protective order.
So this is a great policy ship
that you don't have to be a
helpful member you don't have to
be a.
So I like where this is going.
The.
So great so so I like the way
you so if you look on page
thirty one and then the back to
twenty nine mister chairman it
it some.
I like what the bill drafter did
I guess the bill drafted and
have a choic.
The.
Um.
So you can have to go back a lot
of this is current law a lot of
the sys.
The.
But it doesn't allow for no.
With the exception of star.
The.
So.
We take out the word domestic.
The.
But paragraph two and then two
way through two o.
The.
Household member.
Abuse so there's really no
windows.
The.
With the exception of what's
already allowed.
Which is an incident or pattern
of stocking or sexual.
Yeah that's a lot
as you know much term.
The.
And then was on the intimate
partner.
So on page thirty you have a
criminal dama.
We modernize that statute about
five years ago to include.
Community.
You know there was a case were.
The abuser like.
And and it didn't break the law
because it was theoretically his
car as well so we change that
the criminal damage.
Managing jointly owned property
for the purpose of
so anyway think think of that
and then as.
I think we're fine but you may
want to just.
And then
and the language is there in
the.
And then if you look on page
thirty three.
It looks like the bill drafter
did a word search for domestic
and just kind of crossed out the
word domestic but it's still
exist.
So the petition shell state
whether any domestic action is
pending.
The respondent.
And then i'm sorry what i'm
sorry freely on page thirty
three mis.
The.
It it includes the word domestic
and it may be fine but all.
And then on paragraph.
The.
That's a great paragraph it
takes out an omen separation or
divorce.
It's any type of
involving the parties including
a moment separation of divorce.
The parties that did not arise
from the.
From the violation and other
words.
Ask yourself.
I think it clarifies that in
paragraph.
Because there could be a
criminal.
The.
Are involving the parties that
did not arise from this
violation will take daughter so
I guess any other criminal case
out there maybe there's a pri.
Because you could get.
Did not arise from the
violation.
Yeah whether it.
Because theoretically paragraph
f good involved a criminal ma.
And and then just just follow up
on it.
Since center neighbor was
talking about on page thirty
four the petitioner shall
notify.
I'm sure you've already thought
abo.
The courts are really awesome.
And then w.
Unpaid thirty five mister so
paragraph j online's four
through seven essentially what
this is saying is that a
thirteen year old.
Can file an order of protection.
So that's pretty awesome that's
pretty awesome because then the
thirteen year old has to ask.
So this allows the thirteen year
old thirteen through
to get an order.
Um.
The.
But it restricts it it restricts
it it's not op.
It says you file a petition for
online eight for protection
against.
The miners co parent are a
person or you know presumably
the boyfriend whoever.
And then that contains
allegations of stalking or
sexual assaults or basically a
thirteen year old through
seventeen year old can only get
the order.
If it up.
If it involves a parent or.
Whoever live in.
Or that contains allegations of
stock intersexual assault it
doesn't allow the thirteen year
old the seventy year old to get
a protect protectable against.
The.
And so they w.
Agreeable.
The.
Yeah.
This is great stuff it's correct
law the election victim shall
not be required to bear the
cost.
The prosecution.
This demeanor case.
Well leave it or not mister new
mexico back in the day had a.
Private.
Criminal comp.
Versus the person a person could
actually assume the role of the
state and it was a big mass so
we took that out so this this
paragraph made.
The.
But essentially victim.
On the emergency orders of
protection.
This is good stuff but I I have
a slight I think i'm agreeing
with center number but here's
my take on page two online
thirty seven was chairman says
the lawn force in ops are shall
informed the victim that he may
petition the court.
Like I think he should inform
the victim if he does petition.
And if he does in petition th.
But it's like hey alleged victim
I may petition the court.
Of a nice day but there's
nothing that lo.
Hey i'm going to a petition so
it doesn't yeah miss mister
president I think I will have a.
They
way they raised it that way no
thank you i'm sorry no I I will
just say because my
understanding is.
More sometimes the officer.
Isn't going to do it but.
So but I will definitely.
The.
But since i'm.
Because that makes sense that
makes perfect sense so there.
The victims you know whist away
or whatever or the cops back at
the station and then realize
holy.
And I guess I guess that then
the
then the petition would then be
s.
This is the matter.
Victim that protected party.
That th.
But it doesn't say anything and
I agree with the practical.
There's nothing in this bill
that requires notice of the p.
You know that's key I think
it's.
The.
But the petitioner needs to be
notified.
Number one so the position
doesn't initiate contact but
also additional nose that that
abuser is put on notice because
that is that is a very.
Yeah.
And I know that officers are.
Well trainer all I could stop.
Thank you mister I will
definitely have the officers
speak with you about why it's
freeze that way I don't want to
make any presume to make any
changes without.
I'll talk to them but it
wouldn't.
And pastor determined.
This is great stuff it it it
uses the word court uses the
word court.
It take its there's a there's a
portion where it crosses out the
word district and it uses court
but then on page thirty eight
line seventeen the word dist.
Any court.
Kind of brings back.
Since he looked as.
In current law only the district
court consent emergency
protective order in this bill it
all.
I think.
I would think our each year's
diction has a judge on call.
I think anyway to be thinking
about that and then.
On page thirty nine line
eighteen the current language
mister chairman is immediately
granted.
And then you want to change it
to one the same day so if
someone gets her protective
order.
At nine in the morning.
Then.
I guess under current lights
done in the next couple three
hours.
At the latest at the end of the.
This is a big bill says a long
time.
Says a enjoying the restraining
the same p.
Put in.
The.
But there should also be.
The question is if if the if the
response lawyered up.
That's the whole point.
And then.
And then this is awesome as
chairman on page forty one
paragraph d at the top.
Um.
Just ask yourself how that would
how that would transpire.
I'm say that petitioner shows up
at nine fills up the form the
sits there till ten thirty the.
I guess the court clerk comes
back and says that judge has
denied the order can you be here
tomorrow at eleven I mean.
It's some.
That's where victim add because
he comes.
Because the victim advocates of
the days up.
Prosecuted by the days office
they're not allowed to walk.
The.
And then also up on page forty
one.
The magic word shows up
household member on line twenty
three the magic word shows up
household member.
So we got a ask ourselves you
know do we want to take out
those words are they appropriate
in that kind.
Literally.
As a free for all and once again
if it is a free for all it's not
a free for all because.
Individuals.
The.
Their sexual assault or stalking
and that's currently.
The.
And and take.
Correct correct that's the way
it's written right now but we
would want to say whether they
got the injunction yeah yeah we
are taking out since it's
eligible to anyone see a
neighbor gets a.
So anyway there's a lot of stuff
not a good stuff
going on here I i'm not going to
read the rest and has twenty
pages but
this is true industry is work.
The.
We should maybe put in like.
I believe the major problem with
that is right.
I believe that's going to s.
The.
It opens the door a little bit
but I don't think it was meant
to be a.
No that's just that that makes
sense that makes perfect sense
now.
But I guess.
Thirty one.
But but also it outside of
albuquerque and maybe christas
there are there's not family.
But it is very difficult to get
a civil protective order and if
we're going to truggle against.
But I appreciate.
The.
A percentage of a cution.
Mister chair.
When I when I look at this and
when i.
One of those.
If you did it with the intent to
intimidator etcetera
what can I say they're so I
think we have to be careful.
Who is the never learned they're
doing everything they can.
If he walks in and sa.
I tell you this domestic
violence.
And things like.
Yeah.
A single occurrence.
Number.
Mister chair I appreciate the
editing but I want to clarify
this is not a.
It's violating the order.
That would take place.
How how do.
The the next one going down
mister.
I have engaged in an incident.
I would just take get rid of
physical harm.
Yeah.
Actually I think permanently
both the injuries.
Somewhere that whole thing.
For harm.
And then page forty.
I'm sorry page thirty seven.
And center of my estimates kind
of got this I think
unintentionally but he used to
the phrase alleged victim to
describe uh what's on page two
and so you have a line to so you
have line ten says alleged.
But I think lines to in.
The victim is and so they're
going to say well to cover my
checklist now that we.
So i'm gonna inform all these
people that they can fi.
If we included the word alleged
before vic.
And then finally.
The.
At the top subsection or
paragraph.
We are now going to say if they
don't find probable cause we're
not going to stop there we're
gonna have the hearing.
I think it needs to say you know
it says to allow the petitioner.
The.
Well I think we need a phrase or
a clause or or some.
The petitioner is still seeking
it.
And the petitioner is available
because we mandate the court to
have the hearing within.
Or once again they're not
pursuing it or they're not
willing to something has changed
in the three days I think we
need clarifying language so we
don't hold the court and say h.
Constructive crisis and for.
The.
This is this is the point where
this committee frequently.
Passes on to judiciary.
We raise a lot of issues where
is like and we don't.
The.
That we say will we trust you
you'll.
Or they'll fix.
But i.
So the issue really is.
Or do we want to try to repair
s.
She earlier it's energy mckenna
earlier said well let's let you.
The.
If we don't pass that emotion
and it would be at this
essential terminal asking her to
sit down the senators
neighborhood mast us.
Which means rural.
And rework it and bring it back
to us before we send it to
judiciary
miss mister chair I would prefer
to go on to judiciary because
last year it's got stuck in
judiciary and the whole strategy
this time for an early hearing.
My understanding which.
They weren't going to do it and
so the whole strategy here was
to get to judiciary has soon as
possible to give it a.
I.
Some of the points that were
made.
I will say I don't agree with.
But some of the points for very
well taken.
And so I would prefer to work
with the task force and take the
points that were very well taken
and then some of them were
actually had to.
And the task force.
Spent a lot of time on this and
some of these things were
compromised like the idea about
fully substance having to do
something police officers were
at the table and they know how
this works and so I don't want
to make a change for this
committee without.
What would be my preference is
you pass it or work with the
test force and make the
appropriate changes for
judicial.
Needless dealing so you had this
bill last year before
traditionally.
This committee passed it if you
will call unit unanimously.
And then unfortunately it got
into judiciary and they that's
why I p.
A lot of things happened but one
of them is the supreme court.
But there was a I think is a
fister case invalidating a bill.
We're weapons where the state
require.
Because that happened that
stimulus.
And brought the bill back
and with the entire strategy of
trying to get you to to
judiciary early because I know
there's a lot of expertise on
the whole gun issue it's gonna
be a lot a big discussion and
then the the this.
I believe there were really a
helpful points that were made
that would clarify the intention
of the bill but some of them
also.
Erm.
I don't think goes against what
the task force was trying to
achie.
Yeah.
The.
The.
Any other discussion on the
motion senator mccartin.
The.
Yeah.
It's just a question of.
I don't know if judiciary.
Bill stays perfect.
It's an awesome.
It's very difficult.
So we have here's here's our
situation we have a motion we
have emotion to just pass it on
as it is.
To judiciary.
If that motion fails.
We can the.
We work at come back wednesday.
The.
But.
They'll leave it up to the
connection.
Well that's the same.
So let's go ahead and even the
other discussion anybody else
wanted any other.
Senator.
No but it passes five different
senator I bought to explain his
vote.
Thank you mister.
I I really.
Think we're heading the right.
Stuff.
Thank you
you want to explain your vote.
A very important bill.
Before it gets there because
then they won't.
Based and knowing that you're
either going to get it right in
the next few days.
Yeah.
The.
My comment on my bodies.
If you say the judiciary you've
got to pass this in a perfect
form.
Because we've worked on this for
two years.
You just asking for them to
carve it up.
To some of them.
And that's.
Okay one last bill.
This is senate bill sixty one
and we've given you three hours
to work on this one.
Mr
work on it really hard has to be
passed.
So.
Spoke up.
Yeah.
And.
The.
The.
The.
The.
The.
First.
Right.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And some.
This.
Okay.
This cap.
So
then I get that right you're
going to propose that ppi
instead of sepia.
So right now it's not indeed
then you you think.
Yeah.
Mister rounds did you want to
say mister chairman i'll make
just very short command first
following interviews myself
stand around some recovery.
The.
The archite.
Single.
Here's what was about three
hundred and f.
The.
Have and mischairman.
This is a guard real issue.
For state projects local produ.
The.
Sat on the board.
I'd be happy to answer.
Judiciary she says.
Well you have the same dilemma
you know if you want to.
You want to come back wednesday
with a change.
Just one question of th.
The.
Mister german that's true that.
The.
That professor.
So.
The.
Anybody here want to speak and
support this.
Me anybody here when I speak in
opposition to this bill.
Okay let's go to the committee.
Thank you think mr care
I think I kind of understand ppi
and I think it kind of changes a
nature of the bill when i'm
worried about is this some
contractors yeah.
Yeah.
And I would ask that you fix it
that way and.
Yeah.
Yes.
You have me scheduled for this
what you get is like.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hi.
Okay.
