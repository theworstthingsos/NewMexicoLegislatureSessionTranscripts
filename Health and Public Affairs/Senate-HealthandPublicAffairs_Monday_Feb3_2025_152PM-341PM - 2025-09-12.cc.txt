Here.
And her boon.
Senator Charlie.
Senator Gallegos.
Nova.
Pinto.
Senator Scott here.
And I said, Lopez.
Here
Senator Hickey.
Senor Lopez here.
OK, we have a corn present.
And we'll start with Senate Bill
3.
And, um, if I may before we go
directly into the bill.
Um, I know that for those who
are with us in committee.
Um, you may have heard, and this
will be a story to say, but
Um, I was recently in the
hospital.
I am still immunocompromised.
So for those who come in the
committee, I do ask that you
have consideration.
Wearing a mask.
And also just FYI we have what
we call the crud.
That goes through the
legislative session.
And probably within another
week, it's gonna start the
rounds.
So, it's just a tradition.
And uh I always warn um
committee and guests in the
audience just.
Take precautions.
Um
now.
Amendments.
So where we left off last
Wednesday.
We had already um
We held over.
The committee report for Senate
Bill 1. So that's still in the
committee, um, at the request of
the sponsor.
And then we had a discussion
where we started Senate Bill 2.
But then there was more
discussion as to have a
discussion on Senate Bill 3,
which actually sets up.
Um, the planning process for
what we're um talking about with
regards to the behavioral
health.
Legislation
So, um, after discussion,
Then, um,
The bill sponsor.
Uh, agreed to roll over so that
there could be some more
discussion about amendments.
Um, to the legislation.
So what we will do is to start
up with Senate Bill 3.
Um, and it's not a committee
substitute, they're just
amendments to the bill.
So, um, what I needed to ask,
um,
Alright.
OK
OK.
Sorry for that, but that
happened.
I
need
This particular amendments are
being proposed by yourself,
senator, or?
If you could explain, please.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair, and
again after our meeting last
Wednesday.
Um
Two of your members, Senator
Block and Senator Sadilla Lopez,
uh, met with Adrian and I think
Lorraine Montoya v Hill from our
office and came up with some
compromise language in the first
amendment, I believe Senator
Block is going to present it's
230.
32 3.1.
And then the 2nd Amendment
Senator Sadillo Lopez.
We present. I don't think I have
a copy of the second one, so.
Um, that's kind of where we are
and I would suggest we just
start right with the
Amendments, which I think
address kind of the issues that
were being raised and
Again, I very much appreciate.
The members of your committee on
both sides being willing to sit
down and kind of work through
some language that
You know, it's not perfect by
any means. I'm sure everyone can
agree it could be tweaked that
much more, but they did reach
Compromise and certainly we're,
we're OK with the language
that's been suggested, so thank
you, Madam Chair.
OK, thank you, Senator. So,
Um, again, we are back on
discussion of Senate Bill 3.
And Senator Block, are you, will
you be proposing this amendment?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, yes,
ma'am, I am. Uh, thank you for
those words from the Senator
Worth of Senate Majority Leader,
and I appreciate the sponsors
sitting here, um, along with
Adrian who's been a huge help.
Uh, Madam Chair, I gotta tell
you the heavens opened up on
Friday afternoon.
When you, when you get Senator
Block and Senator, uh, my new
friend Antoinette Dia Lopez
working together on this. This
is.
This good should show New
Mexico.
We can really work together and
um we had a great session to go
through the bill, we think we
still have some tweaking to do,
whether it's in here or the
Senate Finance, but it's a, it's
a good bill that will make huge
impacts uh across New Mexico.
Uh, one of the challenges, Madam
Chair, that we had was making
sure we get the language right.
Um, I'm kind of a policy wonk,
um.
Senator Antoine Antoinette, uh
Cio Lopez is a lawyer, so we're
trying to uh get those words
right, and I appreciated uh
Adrian and the other uh folks
there from your staff
facilitating, uh, that, so with
that, Madam Chair, I propose to
the Senate Health and Public
Affairs Committee.
The following amendments to the
Senate Bill 3, if everyone is
ready.
Yeah, so I move for amendment
number one, I know, um, Senator
uh Lopez has another one. Thank
you, Madam Chair that motion.
OK, there's a motion and a 2.
And Senator Block, if you would
care to walk us through your
amendment.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, for those
Committee members and the
sponsors and those in the
audience, um.

providers and the behavioral
health region.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Block. Um,
Senator Wirth.
So Madam Chair, this is a
friendly amendment.
very much appreciate.
The effort went into coming up
with something that
is broad enough to make sure
groups are at the table without
trying to list every single
group and then creating a
situation where someone doesn't
get listed and arguably wouldn't
be there. So I think this is
some excellent work and we
Thank you very much. So with
that, we'll see if there is
anyone, any audience who is in
favor of this proposed
amendment.
OK.
If you'd like, did you wish to
add some comment or did you just
wish to
Some comment?
OK.
And use the microphone.
And first identify yourself.
Thank you. Um, good morning,
Madam Chu. Good afternoon, Madam
Chair and esteemed members of
the committee. My name is Javier
Butcher, and I'm an intern
working with Juliana Kub to
represent the New Mexico
behavioral Health Providers
Association. We support the
amendments to Senate Bill 3 and
appreciate the inclusive
language proposed. Thank you
very much.
Thank you. Is there anyone else
in favor in the audience?
Anyone in office see none.
Is there anyone on Zoom?
OK, this is um on zoo we have
Meredith.
And I don't know how to spell
you to pronounce your last name.
But Meredith, are you?
Yes, I'm here. Uh, can you hear
me? Meredith Main, um, um, thank
you, Madam Chair and members of
the committee. I'm Meredith
Matron and I'm speaking on
behalf of the League of Women
Voters of New Mexico and the
American Association of
University Women, and we
strongly support this bill and
um thank the sponsors for
working on it and the amendments
to to make it stronger. Um,
anyway, thank you very, very
much.
This is essential for the public
health and safety of our state.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
Thank you very much, Miss Mason.
Is there, was that all that
joined us on.
Zoom at this point? OK.
Uh, so with that, then we'll go
to questions or comments from
committee members. Senator Siddi
Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I just
wanted to um explain the problem
we were trying to address, um,
with the amendments and the way
I saw the problem is because the
AOC is going to be the the
leader or the convenor of these
plans and, and developer of
these plans. I was worried that
only
Justice involved behavioral
health.
uh, service providers would be
at the table in developing these
plans.
And the way it is when you have
a planning process and you're
not at the table at the very
beginning, it's very hard to
crawl in later. So, um, with
that, with having behavior
advocates that can come and say,
hey, we wanna be part of this. I
think that solves the the a
piece of that problem and with
having a list or appendix of all
of the service providers in the
area of the, the
Legislature and the others who
get the report and look.
And um with the and the other
parts is is the gap when the
the.
plan has to identify gaps. I
think that that will help
policymakers figure out the
funding stream without uh and an
understanding that this is
beyond just uh justice involved
individuals and services for
them to as, as it says in the
bill to divert them from um
From criminal convictions, so
that was those were the the
issues I think we were trying to
solve. I think we, um,
I think we did a pretty good job
of, of getting to them and
opening the door for individuals
to come forth and say these are
the needs we have in the
community and to be included in
the plan from the get-go.
OK, thank you very much, Senator
Sidil Lopez.
Um
go to Senator Scott.
Oh, thank you, Madam Chair.
And
Senators, there's a couple of
terms of art here.
I am not a behavioral health
expert or even very
knowledgeable, but
Did somebody explain to me what
A sequential intercept resource
mapping is.
I'm president unless Senator
Scherer wants to do it off the
top, I was going to yield to Mr.
Avila.
Just to make sure we get it
right. It's an existing process
at the courts.
Use now.
Yeah, so it's a process that the
courts use, it's considered best
practice, where the courts
basically identify at each
intercept of someone potentially
interacting with the judicial
system starting from intercept
zero before they even, you know,
before 9/11 even gets called to
after they get out of jail or
corrections like and each step,
what is going to happen? So
what, uh, resources are
available, so this way they're
able to get treatment and not
necessarily come back into the
criminal justice system.
So in total, that sequential
intercept mapping looks at all
the gaps and assets within an
area, what services are
available? Where would they fit?
Where can they intervene? And
then it results with training.
You know, um, dispatchers,
training, law enforcement,
training, corrections, training
judges, training the lawyers,
uh, public defenders and
district attorneys on all of
these opportunities and
resources so that way.
Ideally, individuals get the
treatment that they need before
they're caught in a perpetual
cycle within the judicial
system.
OK, and what are the 4 phases of
the plan?
So, uh, with Incentive Bill 3,
the idea is 4 phases, basically
think of it as a a phase per
year. So in year one, what do
you plan to do? Year 2, what do
you plan to do all the way
through year 4 and then you
start a new plan, right? So it's
4 phases within a 4-year plan.
And Madam Chair, uh,
Item number 2 under paragraph B
is identify no more than 5 state
funded.
Priorities per phase.
What
Might those priorities be?
Of course, Madam Chair, um.
Senator Scott, so those
priorities are basically within
Senate Bill 2. This is how the
bills interact. Um, there's
different pots of money. So if
in a region there it's very
rural and they believe that the
most effective way to benefit
the population is, for example,
mobile units.
Mo response units, then maybe
they need equipment. They need
the vehicles to reach out to
rural communities to then
transport the individuals back
to a hub. Uh, they might need
the beds, they might need
training. So it's a state funded
priority that they were going to
include in the plan. So they're
going to identify 5 items. Now,
to give you perspective, uh, the
first judicial district in the
pilot process that occurred with
the special funding that you all
appropriated.
Um, when they did this, they
identified 36 funding needs.
But in their process, they
narrowed that down to 5, right?
What are the 5 most critical
things that will make the most
impact. What's the most bang for
your buck? And that's basically
what it is. It's having the
group collectively narrow it
down and really be, um.
Accountable for what they're
trying to deliver for the people
in that region.
OK.
Madam Chair, senators and, and
expert.
Could you tell me who?
Will be ultimately responsible
for the success.
Or failure of this program.
Where does the book stop?
So Madam Chair, Senator.
When we put the AOC in here,
this was on purpose.
Uh, because if you look around
administrations change
legislatures change. AOC changes
too, but much more slowly and so
focusing there as the as the
stable.
Part of state government that's,
that was that. So the each
A district
Uh
is ultimately the
The one that's gonna come back.
Now they come back and report to
us as the legislature and say
here are the
It was the plan, and here's what
was accomplished.
Or not accomplished and so a
major part of this is if it's
not accomplished.
Why should we fund you?
Do something different.
Uh, because as you know,
The definition of insanity is
doing the same thing over and
over again without changing
results.
And so in this particular case,
We, as the appropriators get to
decide whether the results.
were met.
So
So I might just add, Madam
Sheer, it's on page 4, beginning
on line 13, no later than June
30th, 2027.
That's the paragraph that starts
to set out the metrics, and I
mentioned this on the floor
today. The reason this is gonna
go in conjunction with 1 and 2
to Senate Finance.
Is that those metrics and the
accountability are absolutely
critical to this working.
And I think that's a fundamental
part of
The need for the oversight.
To ensure that as Senator
Sheriff says if
If it's not working, it's got to
be tweaked. It's got to be
fixed, but having the
appropriating body.
Kind of in that involved in that
oversight along with the other.
Groups that are mentioned there.
I think it is critical to the
whole.
Success of this.
New structure.
In fact, Madam President, or
madam.
This is the key.
This piece is the key. Without
this, we don't have the, the
guardrails that we're talking
about.
So
They develop in each district
the plan.
And then they get to implement
the plan, but if it's not
working, we don't fund the plan
again, we make them do something
different.
Madam Chair, senators.
How will you define success? How
will you define
It's working.
So, uh, Madam Chair.
In in each district, they come
up with the metrics that is
appropriate for their district.
So what happens in Lee County
and what happens in San Juan
County could be dramatically
different based on the needs and
the populations and all of that.
So it's not, there can be the
same things, but these are
really defined for each
district.
But then the matrix is laid out.
So we know if they hit it or
not.
So if they say we're gonna do
ABC.
If they fail at AB then.
And it, it, it's not worked and
that comes back to us and we
say, OK, well, you guys better
try something different because
you
did not hit the mark that.
it was set.
And Madam Chair, Senator, my
understanding we're already
spending.
About a billion dollars a year
on these services.
Have those factor into
What we're doing here.
So Madam Chair, the big
difference is, yes, we're
spending not quite a billion,
but 780 million or something,
big number anyway.
And clearly not getting any
results or certainly not the
results we want.
So this is an effort to to put
those
Put those results in law. You
only get funded if you succeed.
So that's the difference.
Um
In this particular case, we're
putting a billion dollars in a
trust fund as opposed to just
spending it.
Um, and then we'll draw off that
trust fund to help support these
efforts.
But
The key is the the money we
spend now, the $780 million.
We don't have a measure to know
whether it's successful or not.
So this piece of it.
I believe is the single most
important piece.
Now there's defined metrics. Did
you hit the mark or not?
So, Madam Chair, and Senator, is
the 750 million.
Going away
Well, we
Evaluate this new process.
Uh
Madame Chair, no, because we're
only going to get $50 million
out of this trust fund every
year.
So it's the 750 is reduced by
50, which means we can spend
that somewhere else.
But
Uh, in this case, it's, it's.
We can't turn off all of that
money.
Because, well, obviously we have
the need, but now we're
directing how that money is.
directing. We're directing if
you get that money again.
chair, can I, uh,
Yield to our expert.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator Scott,
so the 700+ million, right?
That's primarily Medicaid match.
Um, that's what the state with
the federal dollars put together
780, more or less. So that's
paying for services through the
MCOs and all that jazz. This
money and what this does, it
builds the infrastructure in the
system because we don't have the
beds, we don't have.
The level of care that's
necessary. We have the federal
match, but we don't have the
infrastructure within the entire
system and the pieces that are
there are isolated, right?
They're not in every region and
they're not available for every
community. So the idea of this,
the non-recurring money
incentive Bill 2 is to build out
the infrastructure and then from
that you build Medicaid and you
really leverage the 780 and
actually get it spent to get
results instead of it just.
being there in the ether.
OK.
I, I remain.
Skeptical that
That this approach is going to
be successful because
I don't see a single responsible
entity.
And a flow chart, if you will.
For getting these folks.
The help that they need or
If they are not
Be rehabilitated.
Oh
To develop an alternate plan.
Yeah, in some instances,
Probably incarce, so.
You know, there should be a
logical sequence.
the treatment of these folks.
Um
And, and perhaps that's what
this plan is trying.
It developed, but
But, but a, a responsible party.
For the success or failure.
In my mind would be.
would be very helpful and
Administrative office of the
courts.
Is not
A responsible party.
Would, would y'all care to
respond?
So Madam Chair, ultimately the
legislature is the responsible
party. Today, we have no
measures on anything.
Uh, when it comes to behavioral
health, we give people money,
maybe it works, maybe it doesn't
work, we don't know.
Um, then they come back next
year and say, hey, we need more
money.
So we give them more money.
We don't know if it works.
So I think the part of this is
the AOC is the stable portion of
this.
But ultimately they have to
report to us, so we're the,
we're as the appropriating body
are the ultimate decision maker
on whether we want to fund them
again, thus did the did the
system work or not. And so,
Uh, you're right. At the moment
we need ABC, but.
But a big part of this, the four
phases, is to build ABC.
Because right now, we have
nothing.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you
gentlemen for your answer.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Um, what I want to do is bring
us back to finishing the
amendment that we're still
sitting on.
Um, and I know, I think Senator
Block, did you have a comment
you wanna make because I know
Senator Gallegos has an
amendment to your amendment.
And he wants to propose also
yes, Madam Chair. Senator
Gallegos wants to correct my
grammar, I think on the
amendment.
Um, which is, which is good,
good catch. So, uh, and to echo
Senator Scott's concerns, and I,
I understand that because this
is
This is a very difficult bill
for different reasons. You have
all these different judicial
districts with different needs,
different.
Supports support structures and
support services within those
judicial districts, whether it's
down in
Lee County or up in Farmington
or Sandoval County. The, the
thing that is gonna be very,
that we have to.
Capture somehow uh Senator
Scott's comments are the metrics
because they're not going to be
standardized.
Across the the districts you as
much as that drives me nuts,
because you like to have, you
know, an apples to apples
comparison across the judicial
district, it's not going to
happen.
And it's gonna take some time to
figure out if we're, if we're
making any progress here in the
state when it comes to substance
abuse, mental health. By the
way, which are related to
incarceration rates, in my
opinion. They're all integrated
here, so that's, that's the
trick to capture that.
So, um, one of the things that
I, I and Senator, uh, Innessa Di
Lopez.
Um, that
Especially I, I'm very big on
this is that the word
non-governmental.
is huge because the 501c3s.
I think need to play a critical
role.
Uh, in this, and they need to be
identified.
The AOC, in my opinion, that's,
that's the belly button.
That's where really the rubber
meets the road on this is the
AOC and how the AOC gets the
word out to all these potential
service providers.
With the various gaps in the
different districts because you
might have in the 13th judicial
district.
Services that a neighboring
judicial district might not
have, so.
This is going to be crossing
borders. The judicial districts
when it comes to services
doesn't mean anything.
This is crossing borders of
judicial districts to make sure
the services get to where they
need to be, to who they need to
be serving.
That's gonna be tough.
Because the AOCs when we put in
here on the appendix, that's a
living.
List
Because things are gonna be
swapping out left and right.
That's where the AOCs really
have to focus on making sure
that they're meeting the needs
of the advocates, government and
non-government.
To come in here and provide the
treatment that will provide us
some good data.
Because that's what we're
looking for is good data cause I
don't think we have it now.
Um, that's, that's one of the
things that, and by the way, the
other question is, what do we
not know?
What gaps were out there that
we're not capturing right now.
And I think as the AOCs,
Kind of get their continuity of
operations working, we'll kind
of see some things where
hopefully they're providing
that.
feedback to each other of best
practices. Hey, this is working
here. Have you tried doing this
over here.
Um, and we have some time,
Senator Wirth, in there to get
to get that done. I think that's
important. The, um,
Uh, I, I'm a little
I'm a limited government type of
guy, where I, I really want to
let the regionals, um, work and
do their own thing.
And and that's where I'm, I'm
very uncomfortable with this
bill, but I'm going to let it go
because I think the regions have
to figure out what they need.
They have to figure out what
they don't have.
Then this is gonna take some
time to make it through.
Uh, I think we, we did a good
job kind of.
Getting to where we need to go
on this, but I wanna ask, um,
Adrian here.
Do you have any, how are we
going to
When this becomes law and the
regulations written behind it.
How are we able to have that
flexibility.
And that speed of government.
It's an oxymoron, by the way.
How do we adjust?
On this to make sure that we're,
we're getting it right to adjust
quickly. How are we going to do
that with the AOCs.
Uh
From the state government to the
AOCs.
Thank you.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator B
block. I think the key to this
is the second the regions are
designated.
Work can begin.
Right? I mean, the municipal
League is already preparing
RFPs, draft RFPs for their
various cities to potentially
hash out based on the
appropriations Senate bill too.
The counties are locked up right
behind them. So in terms of
organization, that's already
getting on its way. We've been
in conversations with the
behavioral health services
providers for a few months now,
so that they're aware that
things are are coming, so
they're excited to jump into
this. And on top of that, the
fact that it's more of a
grassroots approach, you know,
bottom up instead of a top down
approach with the one exception
of the behavioral health
regions, um.
I honestly see this working out
relatively quickly. The, the one
piece that would be a little bit
slow would be sequential
intercept mapping, but the
regional plans don't depend on
the sequential intercept map.
Right, they can do the regional
plans and once this set map gets
done, they could come back and
fix and amend their regional
plans. So,
I mean, as soon as you all
decide to to pass this and it
gets signed by the governor,
work can begin.
Madam Chair, can I just add, I
think that the pilot programs
that came out of the special
session.
Really give me hope that this is
moving in the kind of direction.
That we'll get us there that
much quicker, just as an
example, first judicial district
just rolled out a new
administrative office, an AOT
administer.
Administrative outpatient
treatment program, which is the
civil side, uh, last week, and
that's all the result of us
giving the direction and most
importantly, the resources to be
able to do that, and they worked
with the local governments, they
worked with the providers doing
exactly that type of
Kind of ground I appreciate kind
of from the bottom up.
Infrastructure work.
To lift that off the ground and
just, it gave us an example, the
argument we made as to why we
should do that in a special
session is let's start the,
let's start building this now
because if we hadn't done that,
just as an example, then we
would have been, you know, 78
months farther behind it, all
the different districts with the
pilots. So the pilots really
give us a sense that this can
work.
And now we're taking it.
Kind of statewide.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. You know, in, in a
perfect world, it would have
been nice to have, you know, we
get the first judicial district
pilot up here in Santa Fe.
It, it would have been, I wish
we could have done one with uh
Santa Fe and then a rural
district.
Just to kind of compare.
The struggles on each, on each
side, but you know, I, I
understand that, you know,
limited resources, but that
would have been an interesting.
Well, just if I could, the first
judicial district, this is the
beauty of the court districts,
Santa Fe.
Rio Riba Los Alamos. So you've
got 3 different distinctly
different.
types of districts and I think
that the issues obviously in Rio
Reba, different necessary than
Santa Fe and Los Alamos, but all
three counties came together
here in the first to make that
happen, not just folks in Santa
Fe, but those three different
counties. Thank you. Thank you,
ma'am. I would agree, but.
Just taking two different
completely districts.
In a perfect world would have
been really nice to see the uh
how the data came out and what
the needs were of those
different communities, so, um.
The other, the other thing, uh,
Madam Chair, and, and, um,
senators and Adrian is what we
talked about is one of the
challenges that we wanted to
make sure that all these
providers
Know about this program and are
able in the AOCs are able to
reach out to them very fast.
is how are they gonna do this,
they're gonna put this on a
website? Is there gonna be some
type of legal notice, um, we
wanna make sure that
The message gets out. I mean,
we're shotgunning it out to
everybody, so all these,
especially the 501c3s who
provide critical services, no,
hey, we can go.
And provide our services here
very fast. So the AOCs, in my
opinion, have the burden on
them.
To get the information out to
the 501c3s.
Madam Chair, Senator Block, um,
yeah, the burden is on the AOC.
It's also on the cogs.
It's on the counties, and it's
on the municipalities. Um, each
community knows what they have
or has an idea.
Right, and
The, the simple reality that
this will probably be in the
paper tomorrow, right? The
That the news cycle will pick
this up and everyone will slowly
get a sense of uh what's going
on, but within the language of
Senate Bill 3 AOC can ask any of
the stakeholders that you all
have identified within the
definition to help them.
Get everyone to the table. So I
think that's a, a good tool that
they should utilize.
Thank you, uh, again.
I'm sorry,
think about Senator Worth, did
you know, I, I wanna thank,
thank you all for sponsoring
this and taking the lead and and
thank my colleague on the other
side for really coming together
to get this, this done. This is
so one of the most important
bills this session, in my
opinion, 12, and 3, so, um,
support it, it's not perfect by
any means, Adrian, and there's
gonna be some growing pains with
it.
But I think it's definitely on
the right path compared to where
this state is now, not keeping
track of any of this stuff and
not knowing how, how we're doing
or how good we're doing or how
bad we're doing.
So, uh, Madam Chair, thank you.
I yield.
Thank you, Senator.
Um, Senator Gallegos.
And we're still on the
amendment. I'm thank you and
Oh
Our our great leaders in that
uh.
But in Centerville 3, I want to
talk specifically to Adrian
cause I don't want him mad at
me.
I'd like to do an amendment to
the amendment.
Bas your amendment number 2 and
what it is, just clarification,
so on the amendment we had line
5.
said on page 3 line 9 after
resources.
Insert gaps or and gaps.
And I would propose that we
would take the and out.
Put a comma
And then the word gaps, and that
would read so reading from.
Line 9, develop plans and divert
people.
With mental health disorders.
Comma
Gaps and substance misuse.
I think we'd end up with.
Too many ends.
And so I asked if that'd be a
just clarification, just wanted
to see if.
Be a friendly amendment.
Senator Block.
This is your amendment.
Yes, ma'am, um.
I'm sorry, I was just
daydreaming about a tropical
beach. Could you?
I
Uh, I'm good, ma'am, with um
with his amendment.
It's friendly. OK, if I could
just for clarification, Senator
Gallegos, could you repeat your
amendments to that, Miss Torres
can make sure she captures it
correctly.
Yes, ma'am, so going back
online.
On page 3, line 9, after
resources.
We would take out and we put in
earlier.
And replace it with a comma.
Before the word gap.
And that would continue on.
With
The
Rosette.
Uh, disorders and
He would read disorders and
comma gaps.
Then comma
Substance
And substance misuse.
Let me start over, um.
myself confused. So going back
to the regular bill.
On on
Page 3, line 10.
Line 99. OK, I'm, I'm where I
need to be now. After the word
resources.
We would take out the and that
we'd added.
But comma gaps.
And another comma.
It would resources gaps, comma,
and developed plans to avert
people with mental health
disorders.
So, just to go back though on
the actual amendment.
So, going back on number 5, on
page 3 line 9 after resources.
Insert and gaps, so.
On the actual amendment, we
could strike.
And gaps
And then insert what you're
proposing.
Just because we're going to
adopt this amendment.
And we need to strike and gaps,
senators, if you want to follow
just to make sure.
So that way we're not having on
that point, Senator Sio Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I think
we did intend.
To have the community's focus on
resources and gaps.
And it may, I think maybe it's a
semicolon or something.
And so it's resources and gaps
would be the first part and then
and develop plans to divert
people with mental illness, uh,
mental health. I think you're
correct that there's a problem
there, but I, I think we want to
connect the idea that they're
developing both resources that
they have and gaps that are
available and then the next.
step would be to develop uh
and to develop plans, so I'm
just worried that putting just a
comma there would be resources
gaps and develop plans doesn't
feel right to me grammatically.
I think perhaps a semicolon.
After
Um, after this.
After gaps and then a comma
after and would solve your
problem, uh, Madam Chair.
I
If you see, if you follow me.
And all referred to our
professor.
I just know there's an issue
there with too many ends.
But do you see what I'm saying?
Because we, because it's, it's a
two-step thing identify the
resources and gaps and then
develop plans.
And so that's why it is awkward.
I totally agree with you.
So I, I would suggest, uh,
instead to put a semicolon leave
the amendment as it is, but
asked to insert um.
Where would it asked to insert a
semicolon after gaps.
And then a coma after a.
And then you would get the, what
we were attempting to do, OK?
And
go back to Senator Block and
they will go back to the
sponsors. This is your
amendment, Senator.
Uh, yes, ma'am, sure, thank you.
Uh, that's acceptable.
OK.
So, thank you, and then we'll go
to the sponsors.
Man I'm here, I think the
semicolon with a comma after the
end does what needs to happen
because otherwise, if you take
out the end in front of gaps and
put a comma, it just changes the
meaning. And I, and I think the
meaning is the way that
The two sponsors wanted it and
that works with us. So I think
centers Di Lopez is.
Starting to feel like judiciary
in here.
But that's good. Get it right.
That's a compliment.
OK, so for the uh proposed
amendments, Senator Gallegos,
um, are you comfortable with
this change? Yes, ma'am, I
appreciate it. OK, so will you
move your amendment?
Pardon?
It's been amended, but this is
your amendment.
So with the changes you're
comfortable with it, so then
will you move the amendment? OK.
To the amendment.
I, I will move Amendment number
2.
The Senate Bill 3.
OK, so they're moving the
amendment and is there a second?
OK, Senator Block.
Is there any opposition to this
amendment to the amendment?
See none.
So the amendment is adopted.
They will go back to Senator
Block's amendment.
Is there any further discussion?
On the amended amendment.
See none.
Um, if you could call the role
on a Senate.
I'm not talking the Senate
floor. I'm sorry.
And uh
Amendment number 12 Senate Bill
3.
As amended, yes, as amended.
Senator B block.
Then boom.
Senator Charlie.
And Gallegos.
In her nova.
And Pinto.
And stuff.
Yes.
And Serio Lopez, yes.
And her hickey.
Senator Lopez, yes.
OK, so we, you have an amended
measure.
We also have one more amendment.
And this amendment would be 230.
347.1.
And I believe Senator Sao Lopez,
is this yours? Uh, yes, but I
don't have it. OK.
Sorry, it's coming.
I'm sorry.
And Senator Wirth, do you have
the 2nd Amendment with you?
OK. We do have it. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I, uh, I
believe they emailed it to me,
but the, the discussion.
was a wide range of the gaps
and, and we, we didn't want the
two of us identify.
OK, sorry. um, this the
discussion that we had on Friday
was a wide ranging discussion
and, and those of us there
didn't want to try to identify
the gaps because each region
would have different gaps, but
one thing that we do know is
that there is a need for
language access and the AOC is a
good agency, um, to explore this
because they are very good at
addressing language access, um,
so the way that uh that I
posed, and I believe Senator
Block agrees with this, is it
would be something that would be
considered in each of the plans.
So, so there might be a a bigger
need for language access,
perhaps in Las Cruces, then
there might be in.
I don't know. I can't think of a
place where there wouldn't be
language access cause there's so
much, uh, so many different
language access issues around
the state, um, and not just
Spanish, but other other
languages, um, and so
Um, the plans.
would be required to consider
the need for language access for
behavioral health services in
the region. This is also
consistent with the law that we
passed a few years ago requiring
each agency to explore language
access needs in the state, um,
and so I, uh, I
Submit this bill, it is on page
4, line 6, striking and and on
page 4 between lines 6 and 7
inserting.
Number 6
Um, consider the the need for
language access for behavioral
health services in the region,
semicolon and
And then with the the the rest
of the things that are required
to be in the plan would be
renumbered renumbered
accordingly.
So that is, that is my
amendment.
And I, I move the amendment.
OK. Um, thank you, Senator.
There's a motion.
For Amendment number 2 to Senate
Bill 3. Is there a second?
Second from Senator Black.
Um
Sponsors, Madam Chair, it's
friendly enough.
Friendly? OK.
Thank you. We'll go to the
audience. Is there any? Oh, I'm
sorry, just one thing, madam
chair, since in the prior
amendment we added a new 7.
I think we need to on, on number
3, it should say renumber the
succeeding paragraphs.
As we now have 2 paragraphs
since we added one, so just add
the make it plural.
That's a friendly amendment to
the.
Well, Senator Wirth, um.
So then, Senator, if you would
propose then the amendment.
OK
I propose uh that an S be added
to paragraphs.
In line number 3 of the
amendment? OK.
And um I'll second the motion
since we're amending an
amendment.
And it looks friendly from all
cases being.
I appreciate that.
And we'll go to the audience. Is
there anyone here in support of
this amendment?
Would you like to make a
comment?
We have a microphone here.
Commissioner
Anna Hansen, um, for the
Pueblouake, um, and Northern Rio
Grande National Heritage Area.
We support diversity and
language and especially of our
Tewa and Twa brothers and
sisters, so I think this is
really important. Thank you.
Thank you. Is there anyone else
in support?
Anyone in opposition?
Is there anyone
And again, this is on the
proposed amendment, 2nd
Amendment with regards to
language.
OK, um, this is Gabriella
Dietrich.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, uh, I,
my name is Gabrielle Dietrich,
and I'm the executive director
of NAI New Mexico. We are in
support of anything that's going
to provide uh leng culturally
competent, uh, language friendly
behavioral health services to
the people in New Mexico. Thank
you so much.
Thank you very much.
OK, and then, so with that, is,
are there any comments or
questions from committee members
on amendment number 2.
As amended.
See
We do have emotion, and we have
a second if you could call the
roll.
On Amendment number 2, as
amended to Senate Bill 3.
In our block.
boon
Senator Charlie.
Gallegos.
In her nova
And Pinto.
Yes.
Senator Cerio Lopez, yes,
Senator Hickey.
Senator Lopez
Yes.
OK.
You know, have amended twice.
And for this, now we're back on,
on the bill itself.
Are there any other comments
from committee members on Senate
Bill 3 as amended 2 times.
Senator Pinto.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
Do we know how much tribal
collaboration with tribes
nations in Pueblo.
At that
but it put in.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator Pinto,
so we uh reached out to the Al
Pueblo uh council, and then we
reached out to the delegates of
the Navajo Nation as well and to
the um.
Uh, uh, Apache nations and uh we
sent them a video basically
presenting the entire framework
and sent them a link to give us
feedback and to give us an idea
of how their systems work.
Um, we, we only got a few
responses.
Um, but during the initial
discussions in those meetings,
we did get a sense of the
importance of their inclusion
and involvement throughout this
and there.
members of the committee. The
reason I say that because it's
been long standing that some of
our tribes they the pueblos
becomes very complex when we try
to.
Address an issue when they're
not considered.
With their own sound, but also
the, the um our urban Native
Americans that are not on the
reservation.
That they still
Border towns of Gallup and
Farmington.
We had not really received that
much support from to address the
issues within our courts.
With substance abuse.
So I hope this does really
alleviate that.
And there are some uh
entities within the AOC too.
That probably need their funding
doubled.
Uh, port and funding.
You carry some of these services
for a good.
Representative Alone.
That some of these were in place
before and then stripped out.
Um, from the AOC.
So that was very concerning and.
Uh, you know, hearing about
putting it back in there and
letting them be the leader.
Uh, I hope that we can move
forward.
And when we talk about the data
and it's important because of
those of.
The Native American pop, so I
don't suspect that we're gonna.
Have some sort of a tribal
collaboration.
They are like in our area, but.
We have our people and chair.
If we're bringing the bill.
Thank you, Senator Wirth, did
you have a comment?
So I'm sure, I think the points
are all very well taken. I can't
stress enough, um.
What she said about
AOC having the funding to do
this and not coming out of their
base budget.
I think part of as Senate Bill
2.
Part of that has to be the
recurring funding because
they're taking this on, and I
think we need to really
Bank is separate branch of
government for realizing like we
do as a branch of government,
the magnitude of this problem
we're all dealing with it, and
they've been willing to step up
and we have to make darn sure.
They've got the resources to be
able to do it. And I just, and
the other thing too is I think
the
You know, there's specific
language in the bill on page 4
line 23, 1 of the key pieces to
designing the metrics is the
public feedback on the
implementation of each plan
which necessarily
Involves that tribal
consultation, which is
important.
Uh, Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
One of the things that come up
several times is kind of the
hindrance of using the word.
But when we doing things in a
certain way.
Um, believing things.
Um, that have to occur a certain
way.
That others might not understand
and in some sense, it's not
really in our to them why.
Um, because that is in some
sense.
Sacred.
So I I hope that that is not
something that is hindered in
particular.
Issue.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, I
move a due pass.
There's a motion for a pass
from Senator Sabel Lopez.
And the chair still has one
comment.
Um, first, uh, a couple of
comments.
We'll add it.
Um, first of all, you know,
thank you to both Senator Sadia
Lopez and Senator Block for
working on the amendments.
I too feel much more comfortable
with the amendments proposed,
and thanks, Adrian, Mr. Avila
for working on this with them.
Um, but I do have one more small
suggestion.
And um
It's on page and you may not
have to amend it now.
It can wait until you move
forward, um.
The next committee, which I
think is finance, if I'm
correct.
But, um, for your consideration
on page 2.
Line 4
After the Department of Health,
comma.
I would suggest you consider
adding CYFD.
And the reason why I mentioned
that when we talk about the
Kevinness settlement.
And some of the other issues
with behavioral health.
Since we're already listing
Department of Health, which has,
you know, purview and overview
on their responsibilities.
I think the inclusion again for
you to consider as it moves on
to finance.
Adding CYFD, um, there's a lot
of behavioral health, you know,
all the.
I mean, it, it's immense.
And I think at least bringing
them to the table.
Depending on the different
regions, but um I think they
also need to be part of the
consideration, um.
As we talk about
Services and access for uh the
children, families in our foster
care system.
So I just wanted to throw that
out, OK?
So with that, if you could call
a roll, please.
Senate Bill 3 as amended twice.
Sinner Lo
Senator Boone.
Senator Charlie.
And Gallegos
Just
Then another.
Senator Pinto
Yes.
Yes, Madam Chair, with your, um,
Suggestion of that.
In the next committee. Does that
make it a do pass with
recommendation or is it just
it's just a recommendation for
the the.
The sponsors to bring it over.
In front of the next committee
and it goes in front of finance.
Yes.
Center
No.
Serio Lopez, yes.
The hicky
Senor Lopez
Yes
So you have a do pass motion.
Um, senators on Senate Bill 3.
Thank you, ma'am Chair. Thank
you, members. Thank you. Thank
you. So with that, we'll go back
to Senate Bill 2.
And that's Senator.
Shando and Senators.
Yeah
Now, if my memory serves me
well.
doesn't always
Senate Bill 2, we had already
had a discussion on the bill.
And some of that, um, and then
Senate Bill 3 was brought into
the mix.
So
Um
We'll go back on Senate Bill 2,
in other words, senators, you
don't have to present it again.
I'll just go back. We don't have
to go back to the audience.
We'll just go back for a
committee discussion.
On Senate Bill 2.
Is there any further discussion
on Senate Bill 2. So, Madam
Chair, let me just refresh
everybody's memory. This is,
this is the funding portion of
the rebuild package and
appropriates it to, to the
different AOC to HCA to DOH.
Corrections into DPS.
Like this is just a funny
portion.
Thank you, Senator.
So, going back to committee, are
there any questions on Senate
Bill 2?
Senator Block
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you, uh, Senators for
sponsoring this. Just, just real
quick, um,
Senor Pinto brought up, brought
up a point.
That kind of made me think about
this in a different way. So real
quick, the historical numbers.
In here for the different
sections.
How, how did we come to those
numbers? Are those based on a
historical average, uh, you
know, taking.
Just
Raising them like 3% a year or
something like that. How did we
get these numbers?
You mean to increase the
operational side? Are you
looking in the FIR on the
previous funding uh,
thank you. So Madam Chair, so
what I'm thinking, um, Sara
Munoz is like, just for an
example.
Section 4, appropriation
healthcare Authority regional
planning.
Transitional acute care
facilities, $43 million.
Is, is that from a historical
number that we spent, or is that
pulled from something somewhere
else to come up with that
number.
And that, by the way goes for
For all the sections.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator B
block, so the 43 million, uh,
keep in mind since we haven't
had the ability to build out
infrastructure.
We actually haven't made that
type of an investment. So the
only thing we've invested in
previous years was on certified
community behavioral health
clinics, and that was 25
million.
And that was for 5. OK, thank
you. Thank you, Madam Chair. So
based on that answer.
Where you have some of these
sections where you have some
historical data.
How did you come up with a rough
order of magnitude for those
areas that you didn't have data.
So with the ones Madam Chair,
with the ones we didn't have
data, um.
I'm sorry I repeat that? Sorry,
the ones that we did not have
data on, we kind of took a
Estimate, right? Based on
Average cost, how much it could
be to scale things up. However,
that's one of the reasons why we
need the regional plans. So that
way we actually know how much is
needed for each one of these
buckets.
OK, thank you. So, uh, thank
you, Madam Chair. So based based
on that then.
Out of the, I think it was like
13 sections, but two of them
were a little bit of a different
rule.
Which sections did you do or um
a ROM where we didn't have
historical data. Can you just
run through those real quick?
And, and again, these aren't got
you. I'm just, I just wanna know
how we did some planning here.
Of course, so, Madam Chair, uh,
with sections 1 and 2, going to
the AOC, those were actually
discussed with the courts, and
this is the actual cost of what
it'll take for them to do those
things.
Um
With the outpatient treatment,
that one we did not have, uh,
this was kind of scaling up from
the pilot project that was done
during the summer.
Uh, with section 4.
The inpatient, that one was kind
of a a guess based on the 25
million that we put in for um
certified community Behavioral
centers.
Um, with sections 5
and 6, those were more of a, a
kind of a shot in the dark,
unfortunately, cause we don't
have data on those. Um, however,
we figured it, it's a good
starting point and we likely
will expect those to be higher
if there's a lot of uptake for
those type of crisis response
units.
Uh, with the education piece of
that one was uh.
The average of what it would
normally be.
What do you mean education? You
did 5 and 6 section 7, Section 7
is the education and outreach on
behavioral health services, I
believe. Uh, I don't, maybe I'm
reading it wrong.
Oh sorry.
I'm looking at 7.
Sorry, so my, my spreadsheets in
a little different order. Sorry,
so let me back it up. Um,
section 6, the corrections
department, uh, that one, most
of the discharge is done through
Medicaid. So this is to cover
the small gap of what's beyond
that, especially with the county
detention centers. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So I
wanna just go back. So you said
section 5 and 6 were kind of a
guess, but Section 5 is a guest
and Section 6, you have some
historical data.
Yes. OK, and I'm OK, 7.
Section 7, that's for vehicles,
uh, so 5000 or $5 million should
cover ideally most of the
vehicles that are necessary for
that.
Uh, crisis recovery and response
teams should cover the startup
costs for those.
Uh, section 9 is the education
piece. That's the average cost
of being able to do the outreach
and education.
Um, section 10, 1 2nd.
So section 10, this is for the
training.
Chris intervention response
training and uh it's probably
low.
To be honest,
But we don't know what training
is needed until they get back to
us.
Section 11 and 12 are to
increase the capacity. So both
the University of New Mexico and
DOH currently use outreach or do
outreach to homeless individuals
is to increase their reach and
go further beyond their existing
borders.
And then the money for housing
services, it was 50 million that
we put in last year for housing.
So this kind of tracks 50. Yeah,
so this tracks along with that
number. OK, thank you, thank
you, Bet.
Thank you Madam Chair.
So
Again, I go back to what Senator
Pinto said, I think where she
was going on something I may
hope maybe maybe I'm, I'm, I'm
wrong in this, but so when you
look at these numbers.
Um, especially the ones where we
kind of took a guess, you know,
best guess, um, I, I get that.
What, what happens if there for
some reason is
One particular region has a
surge in one area.
Nobody heard that.
Um, one particular
One particular region,
Has a surge.
And in one of these areas where
they need money for whatever
reason, something happens. So
then that that bucket of money.
Is, is going fast, but then you
get other uh regions that might
not need it that at that time,
but later time. So how do they?
How do they, what type of
mechanism is there to kick in
for additional funds because I
think if there's funds left
over, it just goes back into the
pot, um, this is how I read
that.
So
Uh, this is gonna, uh, this
could end up as a
But it ends up as a kind of a
food fight.
So, uh, Madam Chair, Senator
Block, that's where the guard
rails have the equitable
distribution language and how
the money would actually be
distributed, um, realistically,
there's limited amount of
resources you all as the
appropriators get to decide how
much resources you're going to
put out there.
Right, so in this case, it's 140
million as a starting point.
But once you all know what the
plans are and the scope of the
need, you all can then
prioritize accordingly.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. So let me, let me walk
through this with you so I
understand this real quick.
Like section 4.
I'm not questioning Adrian. I'm
not questioning the dollar
amount. I'm questioning the
process here, how this works.
For instance, the appropriation
Healthcare Authority regional
planning transitional acute care
facilities.
Um
Actually, let's do number 7.
That's probably a better
example. I'm sorry. The
appropriation Department of
Public Safety Regional Planning
Crisis Response and recovery. So
if we have er so the equitable
part, I, I don't, I don't
understand that because
I, I'm trying to see here in the
bill.
Is it a first come, first serve,
or is it a prioritization
because
We, you know, some of these,
some of these folks might be
left out one year and then maybe
the following year we have, have
the funds available. And by the
way, are we allowed to move
money between
Uh, the different funds from one
to another to compensate for
areas where we're having surges.
Thank you.
We will not be allowed to
transfer the funds once they're
appropriated, but on a first
come first serve basis. This is
the whole point of trying to
stand this up quickly, right? Or
was that want to do it?
Will push to to getting it done.
And they'll make sure that they
have the money to do what they
want to accomplish. Those that
don't want to do it, will slow
play it or if they're just
looking for money to on the
operational side, they may not
be allowed to do that. And
correct me if I wrong, the
secretary's in the room. She may
have money if there's a crisis
in an area, um, McKinley County
a few years ago had a
A suicide crisis, right?
And they send a response team in
with tons of services and UNM
was there too.
So she may have the flexibility,
may want to ask her that
question in case.
Or do you want to answer that
for?
Thank you, Senator Munoz, thank
you, Madam Chair. I can repeat
it for you basically the premise
of the question is,
Does the state have the
capability and the flexibility
to rapidly surge.
With these whatever different
funds are in these sections to
meet a need.
That is overtaxing on the amount
that we put in there.
Um, Madam Chair, Senator Black,
I, I think, I think so, um, you
know, I think in addition to um
the funding that's envisioned in
the bill, that's not all of the
behavioral health funding for
the state of New Mexico. And so,
uh, we also continue to support
the behavioral Services
division, the Medicaid program,
um, and so all of those would
continue to exist, um, in terms
of how the funding would be
distributed, I think it's very
dependent on the regional plans,
um, and the criteria.
set up for those and making sure
um that there's sort of an
equitable lens and
prioritization and and
coordination with those local
communities. Does that, does
that help, Madam Chair Madam
Chair and Madam Secretary, I
think he's asking me if there's
a crisis response team in case
there's a large outbreak of
Hope not, but Fentanyl or some
other crisis in the school. Is
there any response team with HCA
that you can appropriate money
directly to get them out. Um,
Madam Chair, Senator Black, I
don't think there's an existing
pool of funding for rapid crisis
response today, um, for that.
Yeah. OK, thank you. Thank you,
Madam Chair, and I, I.
When I, when I hear the word
equitable and then
prioritization on this, it, that
doesn't line up, so I don't
understand what the process is
for this money if it's first
come, first served, because you
can't have a priority and you
can't have equity or equality.
So I, I maybe we can go back on
this somehow and think about
that, but, um, and I think the
state has to have the ability
To draw money somewhere to surge
in areas where we're not meeting
the need here because like you
said, uh, Adrian, we did take a
stab at it. Maybe it's a high
cost, maybe it's a low cost, we
don't know, but if it's a low
cost, and we need
You know, more funding then we
got, we got to kind of figure
that out, so I'm looking for the
flexibility piece. I'm kind of
looking for the process of how
these funds will be allocated.
Not on equity, not on equality,
I assume it's prioritization.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Any other
questions on Senate Bill 2?
none
I do pass. There's a due pass
from Senator Sidil Lopez.
With a second from
Senator Pinto
And if you could call the roll
please.
Senator Block.
Then boom.
Senator Charlie
Gallego.
I know
Pinto.
And
No.
Senator Serio Lopez, yes.
Senator Hickey.
Senator Lopez
Yes.
You have a you pass motion,
senators?
Thank you Madam Chair, member of
the committee.
Senator Padilla.
I know I saw you in here.
He's not here right now.
Is he coming?
OK.
Senate Bill 6 fostering
connections.
Eligibility.
OK.
Um, no, sir. Senator Padilla.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Senator, I know he
was just here and he walked
right out.
Because
Well you are next.
OK, there he comes.
You walked right through and
then he walked out, please join
us.
So Senator Padilla, yes.
Senate Bill 6 fostering
connections.
Eligibility.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair and
uh vice chair and members of the
committee and ranking member,
thank you. I've come before you
with Senate Bill 6. this is
Might easily be one of the.
pieces of legislation will
always be the proudest of in my
time up here and a couple of
years ago, we passed the
original bill called Fostering
Connections, which provided
supports for aging out foster
youth at the age of 18 to the
age of 21, things like housing,
transportation, healthcare, uh,
help with the judicial system,
um.
Higher education, uh, social,
emotional, behavioral health
services, etc. When we passed
that bill we inadvertently it
was very painful thing to get
done, but um
We wound up leaving out students
or, or I'm sorry, young uh aging
out foster youth that were
actually fostered in another
state or their case had not been
fully adjudicated yet and so we
have about 13 to 15 of my foster
brothers and sisters that are
kind of left on the field here
and I want to make sure that we
picked them up and that's what
this does, because we didn't get
the um hear a lot of CYFD
legislation last year. I went to
our governor and I said,
Governor, um, I want you to sign
an executive order, which she
did. She brought the
White House in the president's
uh domestic policy advisor. We
had a, a signature um event,
etc. and this is actually an
executive order at the moment.
This simply codifies that, and
it picks up those remaining
children. The benefit to the
state of New Mexico is, is a
couple of fold. Um, one is we do
bring in additional title for
e-money and Chafee Act money
into the state to manage this
program and it covers the vast
majority of the cost of the
program.
The other benefit of the state,
Madam Chair, is that, you know,
I wish I could tell you that
this was an original idea, but
it was sort of and sort of
wasn't.
I, I kind of, I was listening to
a speech one time and an
individual talked about this
kind of stuff and that's where I
kind of got the idea. So I
started looking around. Some
states provide at the age of 18
to 21, they'll provide housing,
they might provide housing and
transportation. They might
provide this, that and the
other, uh, with the legislation
I got done a couple of years ago
and with this one, we're the
most comprehensive uh uh support
services like this.
And the reason that this is so
critical and so important is the
states that have, and there's
about 17 states now that do what
I proposed here. They have seen
a complete um uh flipping of the
script, if you will, whereas,
uh, about 70, 707% of our
students that are ever our
children that are in foster
care, their children lined up in
foster care when they end up
having kids later with these
types of supports that, that,
that earliest opportunity to
help these these young adults
succeed, states have seen that
complete opposite.
will fall below 30%. So we're
going to see over time.
A significant reduction in the
number, the amount of foster
children because of this
legislation. So I just wanted to
ask you for your support on
this, and that's why I'm here
today.
Excuse me.
Thank you very much, Senator.
We'll go to the audience. Is
there anyone in the audience in
favor of this legislation.
Madam Secretary, welcome.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
Teresa Casados, the cabinet
secretary at Children, Youth and
Families Department and the
department stands in full
support of this legislation, I
think making sure that those
individuals that have thus far,
um, not been eligible for this
is a really um good bill to be
able to include those
individuals and ensure that they
have the same opportunities and
that we're able to move and give
them um funding so that they can
continue on through this. So, we
are in full support.
Thank you, Madam Secretary. Is
there anyone else in support
here in the audience?
Is there anyone in opposition?
Here in the audience.
Is there anyone on Zoom? Ah, OK.
And on Zoom, we do have
Gabrielle Dietrich.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. Um, my
name is Gabrielle Dietrich. I am
the executive director of Nami
New Mexico. We know that there
is a strong correlation between
ACEs, adverse childhood
experiences and mental health
conditions later in life, and we
know that among young people in
the foster system, the ACEs are,
are pretty much ubiquitous and
so any support we can offer to
these young people to get a
better start in life and to
avoid homelessness, which is
another scourge.
that many people who age out of
foster care face. Um, we stand
in strong support of this bill
because that's, we want to avoid
those things as much as
possible. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
With that, we'll go to questions
or comments from committee
members.
Senator Sihel Lopez, Madam
Chair, I think this is a really
important bill to fill in the
gap and to really help these,
these people, um.
My question is what happens if
the federal funds. Well, like,
thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator Sadia Lopez, uh, when or
if something like that happens,
you could say that about really
any program. I will tell you
that at the moment, this is
probably a 2.5 to $4 million a
year spend or to the budget. So
I know that um that's always a
concern. I don't really have an
answer for you other than I know
that the department would want
to absorb this because they're
seeing such great success with
it right now. At the moment
there are approximately 3.
100 aging out foster youth that
are participating in the
program.
Now, this is gonna add about
anywhere from 13 to 18 a year.
Uh, Madam Chair, I, I think, um,
it's a really important point
because we don't know. I know
that the pause last week.
Um, caused all kinds of havoc
for so many state programs that
were receiving federal funds and
also uh nonprofit so, um, I just
worry that if that were to
happen,
Between legislative sessions,
um, so I, I just hope there is a
backstop or maybe some reserves
in CYFD to be able to cover it
in the event that federal funds
do not, I think it's an
important investment by our
federal government and I'm
hoping that they do not, uh.
uh cut these funds, but I, I'm
not sure.
Uh, at least now advocates and
agencies are telling me.
They don't know um what kinds of
funds would be.
Cut in this.
Process, um, that is coming up.
They don't have a
Security.
And so I just hope that there's
some kind of backstop for a
program like this.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you, Senator for doing
this. Just, just real quick to
um refresh.
Some of the new information for
me on the analysis that said
this bill was introduced in the
2023 and 2024 session, but did
not make it through the session.
Can I assume you were the
sponsor of that particular bill.
Is that correct? Uh, Madam Chair
and Senator Block, that's right,
the, uh, 2023 version simply ran
out of time once it got over to
the house, it got there pretty
late and then I, did you say
2024 also? Yes sir.
OK, um, we, I.
That's great. I don't remember.
I don't remember introducing it
last year, but maybe I did,
yeah, so
thank you, thank you, man. I'm
sure maybe because it was a 30
day just didn't didn't go it was
not Jermaine. That's right,
hello.
OK, OK, thank you, uh, sir.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So,
Um
Enacting this policy change.
Um, how do we know if we're
doing well? What do we, what do
we measuring? What are we
keeping track of to know that,
hey, this change is working.
Uh, well, for these, uh, young,
young kids and young men and
women. I thank you, Madam Chair
and senator. So we're about 3.5,
4 years into it, so we don't
have a whole lot of data, but
there are measurable um data
points that the department's
collecting now and the biggest
one, like I mentioned, is gonna
be benchmarking um the success
of the reduction in, in the
The aging out foster youths
having foster children of their
own. That'll obviously take us
about a decade to really
understand what that's gonna
look like. So, um, I hope that
you'll be patient with that, but
I, I, I can tell you that based
on how it's gone in other states
and ours is much more
comprehensive than any other
state that does this of the 17
states doing it right now. I, I
feel very good that we're gonna,
we're gonna see those great
outcomes.
Thank you, sir. Thank you,
madam. I'm sure that that rolled
into my next um question is the
analysis of those 17 states now
granted every programmer or
statute is gonna be a little bit
different. Um, any of those
states, I mean, have you, if you
happen to know offhand some of
those data points that have been
success stories that we're, you
know, we're not reinventing the
wheel on.
Well, Mr. Chair, uh, Madam Chair
and the senator, some of them
are increased rates of uh
adopting higher education
options, uh, better health
outcomes because the, the
healthcare option is there for
them rather than tripping
immediately with healthcare
issues they're not taken care
of, um, and then you're also
seeing um the significant
reductions in that population uh
with regard to homelessness.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you very much. Any other
questions?
See none
chair would entertain a due pass
motion from Senator Nava.
With a second from
Senator Block.
And if you call the roll please.
Center block.
And boom.
Yes.
Senator Charlie.
Gallegos.
no
And so.
And scope? Yes.
Then said Lopez.
Senator Hickey, Senator Lopez.
Yes.
Senator, you have a do pass
motion.
Thank you, members of the
committee very proud of your
work today.
Thank you.
Senator
You will join us up front with
Senate Bill 7.
Storm water
Service as municipal utility.
Yes
Thank you, Madam Chair. If
Senate Bill 7 is, is simply
enabling legislation to allow
municipalities to add storm
water.
To the list of utilities and I
have with me today a couple of
expert witnesses, and I will let
them introduce themselves.
Thank you, Senator. Madam Chair,
members of the Senate Committee.
My name is Sarah Herto and I'm a
wildlife biologist and have a
master's degree in environmental
science and policy. I've been
working in conservation for
nearly 20 years and through my
work in New Mexico, there's been
this challenge with stormwater
that continues to bubble up from
the community.
And so through that work, um,
It has become the focus of my
work to understand how to fund
stormwater management more
effectively.
Most of my work has been focused
in Albuquerque, but, um, now my
work has taken me across the
state and in smaller communities
and rural villages, they are
having storm water literally run
through the streets without the
ability to invest in stormwater
infrastructure.
And because stormwater isn't a
sexy issue and maintenance is
hard to come my maintenance
spending is very difficult to
come by. Cities in New Mexico
are struggling to reduce
localized flooding in their
homes and businesses, comply
with water quality, regulations
and extend the life of roadways
and other infrastructure that is
frequently damaged with
inundation.
So we've been searching for
answers to and strategies to how
to overcome this and it's come
back to the same issue time and
time again. We need dedicated
funding for stormwater
management, and this bill is the
key, is the missing puzzle piece
to, to this issue.
The beauty of this bill is in
its simplicity. It only does two
things.
It allows municipal um authority
to create a stormwater utility
and it allows them to generate a
fee.
Um, to charge you just and
reasonable fee.
And so this enabling legislation
is really key to ensuring that
we are able to sustainably
manage our stormwater
infrastructure.
It would allow communities to
like Silver City and Las Vegas
and like Farmington and many
others across the state to
invest and protect their town
from localized funding, funding,
sorry, flooding.
Excuse me.
The dedicated funding in larger
communities like Albuquerque and
Rio Rancho would allow them to
work alongside their blood
control districts.
And, um, who have been left with
the burden of all the stormwater
management in their community.
So I urge you to pass this bill.
It is the key to effective
stormwater management across the
state and would bring us in
alignment with 42 other states
that allow stormwater utilities.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and um
honored, honorable senators.
My name is David Cypher. I'm a
community works director, a
public works director for the
city of
Um, Farmington, New Mexico.
And just
To be very brief and to add to
what has been said in 1990 there
was.
Uh, federal legislation
requiring storm water uh
compliance for not just the
flood portion.
Of
The problem as stated, but also
for pollution or contamination
uh for addressing some of the
Uh, concerns that you can't
necessarily get from the flood
control. So simply put, we're
We are in in 2003, the phase 2
of stormwater was implemented in
the other 47 states that have
primacy.
Here, uh, we're told by the EPA
is about ready to pull that
trigger and we don't have the
resources when I as a public
works director have to go to get
money, the place I have to go is
my street fund, and I think
you've over and overheard the
demands of our streets. We've
all endured potholes, madam
Chair, uh, and in poor
conditions of asphalt were such
a spread out area.
to uh to come up with those
funds is difficult.
So again, simply we're not, this
would not mandate any kind of a
program, but it would allow it
in the tool bag or the local
entities, especially those under
100,000 down to 10,000, those
people who are going to have to
implement stormwater phase 2
projects to monitor permitting
compliance, and um.
sedimentation issues.
That it, it's going to be a
difficult situation and so I
would highly recommend to you
that we, um,
Look at this simple legislation
and help by simply adding to the
definition of utility, that of
storm water.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
So, thank you, Madam Chair,
we're now ready to stand for
questions.
OK, thank you very much, Senator
and presenters.
We'll go to the audience. Is
there anyone here in favor of
this legislation? Yes, ma'am.
If you could please come
forward, um, and use the
microphone.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, uh,
thank you for the sponsor for
bringing this bill. My name is
Alison Nichols. I'm with the New
Mexico Municipal League, um, the
league supports Senate Bell 7.
Our members have voted this as
one of our, uh, legislative
priority resolutions through our
policy process for at least the
last few years, so we know that
a lot of our members do want to
see, um, legislation like this.
We like that it allows
flexibility for municipalities
and managing their stormwater
and importantly, of course, it's
not a mandate, it's an option.
um, as, as the sponsor and, and
the um expert said.
Um, we also believe that this
could unlock some sources of
federal funding for
municipalities, um, we know that
there are some grant and loan
programs that require
municipalities to have a
mechanism like this in place.
So, um, we're certainly
supportive of, again, that
additional um leveraging of
federal funds and additional
flexibility for stormwater
management. Thank you.
Thank you. Anyone else in
support?
Mr. Thompson
Thank you, Madam Chair members
of the committee. Madam Chair,
nice to see you. Uh, John
Thompson, registered lobbyist
for the Middle Rio Grande
Conservancy District, which
provides irrigation, drainage,
and flood control from Cochiti
to Bosque della Pache, we stand
in strong support of the
legislation. Thank you.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Scott Scanlon registered
lobbyist for the city of
Farmington, and we just, I just
want to stress that this is
enabling legislation.
Uh, there's no mandates, we
believe it's a good bill and
Madam Chair, it's good to see
you.
Nice to see you too. Anyone else
in favor?
We
Thank you. Hello, Madam Chair
and members of the committee. My
name is Jacqueline Walsh. I'm
representing the Sierra Club Rio
Grande chapter. Um, we also want
to confirm our support for this
bill and just say that um modern
stormwater management also
prioritizes green development
and we would love to see that
incorporated into this bill and
maybe some
Municipalities will be able to,
you know, use that. So thank
you. Thank you. Is there anyone
in opposition?
See not none, um.
Online
And I don't know how else to
refer to this, but.
Uh, there's an entity called
SSCA FCA.
I'm sorry?
Is that Skafka.
Yes, ma'am. It's Gafka. Thank
you very much, Madam Chair and
senators. Uh, my name is David
Gatterman. I am the executive
engineer for the Southern
Sandoval County Arroyo flood
Control Authority, and we stand
in support of Senate Bill 7. We
believe that stormwater is
currently, uh, pretty much an
unfunded utility in most
municipalities, and because this
would give them an alternative
to be able to fund both
improvements in the stormwater
utilities as well as
environmental compliance
efforts. Thank you very much.
Thank you. So that's Southern
Sandoval County.
Yes, ma'am. So
No, it's OK.
Just
Southern Sandoval County, OK.
Always something new to learn.
Um, so with that sort of
questions from committee
members, are there any
questions?
Senator Si Lopez.
Thank you Madam Chair. I think
this is a great bill. I, I'm
very happy, happy to support it.
I just have a thing more for
curiosity more than anything
else, um, why is it only
municipalities and not counties.
Cause I just know in some
regions, especially in a rural
state.
That, um
It might be a county that might
take care of this. I don't, I
don't know. That's my question.
Thank you,
Madam Chair, uh, it actually can
be for uh regional areas. It, it
has to do with the MS4
designations and by population,
but generally, uh, it has to do
with cities, what we're really
hopeful for is that we don't
have to, um,
Create another level of
government.
Really, this allows existing
municipalities to have their own
storm water.
Uh
Utility system, so as such, I
don't think it prohibits uh
counties.
Or is not meant to.
So, Madam Chair.
Because we are so bipartisan
here today, if you hadn't
noticed, there's plenty of.
Uh, because this
particular piece, uh, Madam
Chair, is in the municipal code.
But we're amending the municipal
code.
So there's not.
Not opposed to something else,
but this particular bill is
municipal because municipal or
municipal municipality means any
incorporated city, town,
village, whether incorporated or
under General A, special act or
special charter.
Incorporated counties and H
class counties, so.
Madam Chair, so what that's my
curiosity, what's an H class
county or an incorporated
county?
Like how, how does that work? So
accounting could only do it if
there was no municipality or I'm
just curious how this all works.
Of Madam Chair specifically,
it's Los Alamos County.
That would be an H class county.
OK, and there wouldn't be any
other place in New Mexico that
would.
Would be able to do that.
I don't know.
Apparently not.
No tails. I'm, I'm just always
interested in these, um, you
know, the municipal cause, for
example, the air quality control
board is a joint county um
municipal municipality board,
and so.
Is that possible under this
bill, the county and a and a
municipality joining together.
Um.
Madam Chair, I don't, I don't
think I can answer that question
completely honestly, but this
has to do with people that are
government entities.
That have utilities.
So
If, if it's part of the utility,
and I think that's why Skafka is
interested in it because they
are, they have utilities.
But generally it's whoever has
utility company.
If I may add.
Madam Chair, Senator Sidia
Lopez, the counties may already
have this ability to charge a
storm on her feet and manage
their stormwater.
And so, and so the missing piece
is that the cities, the towns do
not, especially when they're
separated from a.
The water authority.
So for example, in Albuquerque.
The Albuquerque County.
Elio County Utility Authority
gives them the right to do water
and wastewater, but it does not
allow them to do storm water and
without that water author
already connected to the
municipality of the city, they
are left without any.
Authority to create a stormwater
utility.
Madam Chair, excellent, that,
that even makes the bill even.
More important, um, to, to
realize that, and then we talked
about this, Madam Chair, I
talked about this with the
expert, um, the other thing that
I think is great about this bill
is that there will be more
planning to these, to these, um.
For to the whole process that
you won't have a little little
something here for uh.
Or run off or storm water and
then another little something
here and another little
something here that there will
be more of a vision, uh, which I
think is really important, given
the topography, the various
topographies in our state, so
I'm thank you uh sponsor for
bringing this bill, Senator Sher
and I'm happy to support it.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I, I
wanna make sure I can kind of
get my arms around this for a
second here, um, because I'm
familiar with Scafka and what
they do because it's in my
district.
Um
As a county commissioner there
for 8 years, I, I understand
that process, but I think
I, I, and I agree with you about
not, you know, throwing down an
unfunded mandate to these
municipalities like you're gonna
do this because quite frankly,
Um, you know, I look at, I look
at some of the, the
unincorporated areas like
Placidus.
Um
Even Cuba, which is
incorporated, and water is so
critical in Sandoval County.
For for different things,
whether it's Intel uses a ton of
water, by the way, in the
manufacturing process.
Um, but also,
When you, when I think about the
huge issues that Cuba has in
Sandoval County with water. I
don't think they have this, so
the counties though.
Can do their ICIP.
To start the process of building
that infrastructure and going
through the capital outlay
process or federal grants or
something like that, I assume
that's kind of like where you're
going with this on the
unincorporated areas of
Class A, class, class A and
other, other class counties. Is
that, is that fair to assume?
Um, Madam Chair, I believe that
is fair, a fair assumption. OK,
so that kind of covers that
piece, uh, right there. And do
you know of any federal, I mean,
under
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
You know, we just had
The um
The infrastructure bill under
the last administration, we've
got a lot of ARPA money out
there. Have you been
coordinating with some of these
counties or municipalities on
those type of funds to build the
infrastructure that can actually
Capture
Uh, this.
Our city in the past has applied
for several different grants to
build a retention and detention
ponds. We've also had um some
other structures that uh would
would be classed as a
stormwater.
Function, but this, this would
be more of a, in addition to
that, would be more of a
Uh, need for an ongoing utility,
um.
That is going to be required
under stormwater too.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. That, that just reminds
me of, you know, on the
retention ponds, for instance,
in Corrales.
They have these retention ponds
at the bottom of the hill there
with Intel, and it's, it's
really been a big issue
previously, um, with wiping out
houses and things like that, so
I, I guess where I'm going with
this is, um,
Why, why didn't, why, why didn't
we have this before?
I, I, I don't understand that. I
mean, this seems like such a no
brainer.
How come we couldn't get it done
before?
Is it because of Senator Scher?
Mm
If that's the answer, I'm good
with it.
Madam Chair
Senator Black, I'm not sure the
answer to that exact question,
um, but I can't tell you that
counties and the flood control
districts can't keep up with the
demand that they are required to
manage and so having a dedicated
funding to stormwater management
that the municipalities can tap
into through ordinance.
Um, would allow them to
supplement the work that's
already being done by.
Those flood control districts.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. Yeah, because, you know,
you look at, you look at
capturing the water and it can
be used for agriculture,
ranching.
You know,
Economic development, selling it
back.
Are there other organizations
that some of these counties
similar to Skafka that that are
doing this because, like for
instance, Kafka's got a lot of
work to do with the, you know, a
royal management. I mean, we got
some serious issues, I think
across New Mexico with the roo
management.
Are there other organizations
kind of like SCAFA that um are
gonna jump onto this or, or, or
not.
So, uh, Madam Chair, I don't see
them back there unless they've
identified themselves middle Rio
Grande.
A conservation district is
supposed to be here supporting
us, but.
Unless they jump up and down and
say they're here. I can't
actually speak for him.
OK, thank you, thank you, man,
yeah, um, Mr. Cog is, is, is
what you're talking about there,
very familiar with that in our
area, so I, I support this. I, I
can't for the life of me.
Understand why, why we didn't do
this before. I mean that.
It's just
Boggles my mind. I blame Senator
Scher.
So, um,
I'm good.
Madam Chair, I'll I'll support
this 100%. Thank you, uh,
Senator Schiff, for leading this
effort. Very much appreciated.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. It's good to
see you supporting your floor
leader.
Oh goodness. Um, are there any
other questions from committee?
See none. Oh, Senator Pinto,
thank you, Madam Chair.
How will this apply to those
entities that?
bordered to um reservation.
So, Madam Chair and senator.
Certainly if it helps.
communities around and it's also
helping uh flood control,
helping the pollutants that get
into the river and so forth, uh,
cause that's a whole big part of
this is when the water comes
down, what is it pushing into
the river which obviously.
At least in the case of the San
Juan Animas Rivers.
Uh, make your way onto.
Navajo Nation. So that would be
very positive thing in just
controlling what's
Entering the river because right
now.
What comes down goes in the
river, wherever it's gonna go.
We don't.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I think I'm speaking
in more in terms of if there's
a.
Let's say there's a pro project
bordering that flows into the
reservation area.
Of land
That uh that tribal
collaboration and making sure
that.
Because I think that was one of
the entities that come in.
And then they now.
To their own engineering of the
storm water and then they're
flooding the neighbors next to
them.
And then their places.
neighborliness and shares always
been a great neighbor.
Oh, I don't know
Um
I know we try not to speculate
on issues, but you know, I can.
Me getting slapped on the hand
for uh voting for.
Yes. Thank you.
Madam Chair, Senator Pinto.
Thank you for the question. I
think the answer here is that
this is enabling legislation and
so whether or not a community
decides to create a stormwater
utility would fall in the hands
of that community.
So they went through ordinance
need to need to pass that and
develop the fee structure
associated with that development
of the stormwater utility and
through that, um.
Establishment, those sorts of
issues could be part of the sort
of originating legislation or,
or ordinance in that community
to manage those issues.
All right. Any other questions?
See none to entertain a do pass
motion from.
Senator Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Yes, I'd like to do a do pass
motion on Senate Bill 7. There's
a motion for a due passed with a
second from Senator.
Like a senator Nava.
And if you could call the roll,
please.
And block.

And they boon.

Pinto.
The nurse got
Yeah, oh yes.
And I said Lopez, yes.

thank you. Thank you.
And Senate
