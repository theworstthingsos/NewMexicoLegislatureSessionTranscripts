This isn't something that should
be OK with
such a huge part
of

I wish
that.
But we did not.
Uh, it took me this long to
figure out what we needed.
So

Thank you.
You can just.
As compared to the
first part is the rapidity which
we've been

is

but because the funds invested

no way for us to get that those

There
was a period of time when we
didn't do much
and then starting again
and
the issue was we were
but it was

So
there is some value,

so anyways you 1%
that gives you about 40.
There's
a

And the the the purpose of that
is, uh,
I believe the average premium

less than 6%.
Where

I think 3 or so.
No position insolvency or
anything like that, but
definitely
No position insolvency or
anything like that, but
what the board expenses
that would be about $80 million.
So
have an infusion

Look at that.
In line with

And
with that I will give it back
to.
of
the
LSC recommendation includes a
6 6.99% rate was requested by
the authority
that about half of that increase
will be picked up by local
school districts, um, Mr. Chair
or sorry, Madam Chair, members
of the subcommittee, uh, I'm
sure, uh, Mr. Sandoval is going
to talk.
more about this, but a number of
uh our school districts have
been hit by large settlements,
particularly related to sexual
misconduct claims and uh the LFC
recommendation supports, uh,
rates setting policies at the
authority that uh shifts costs
of those claims onto those uh
onto those entities to encourage
better loss prevention policies.
Um,
Uh, so the executive
recommendation assumed an 11%
rate increase, uh, for
insurance. Um, this is another
example, and uh if you turn in
your packet to uh page 8.
You'll, you can see the special
supplemental deficiencies,
different sheet. So as with, um,
benefits, there's a, there's a
infusion into the risk fund of
the public schoolsurance
Authority, um,
The executive recommended 18
million. The LFC recommendation
was $23.9 million and that's
that LFC recommendation is
specifically to reimburse the
authority for some, uh, some
high wind and hail damage claims
that they experience in FY 23 to
to to shore up that fun.
Uh, finally, to talk about
program sport, I'm gonna.
Give it back to Simon.
Thanks, Madam Chair, members of
the committee.
Moving to program support PE

The uh
LFC recommendation is about
$50,000 higher.
The LFC recommendation provides
funding for all 12.
Of the agency's FTE.
The executive recommendation
builds in a
uh,
but again, that we're only
looking at a $50,000.
Difference. So with that, I will
turn it over.
Oh, I will turn it back to Joey.
Uh, miss, uh, Madam Chair,
members of the subcommittee, one
thing to keep in mind, uh, for,
for all of these programs, you
all typically grant the public
school insurance authority
pretty broad bar language to
increase their budget if they
need to do so to make claims.
That's why they need to have
those funds in reserve and their
fund balance so that they're
able to continue paying those
claims. So, um,
Despite the differences we
typically provide that bar, uh,
language, uh, that allows the
authority some flexibility to
make adjustments.
Thank you, Mr. Simon.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, I
would like to introduce some
staff that are here with me
today. We have our deputy
director Martha Quintana, and
our chief financial officer
Philip Gonzalez.
Then I believe you also have our
presentation. I'm just gonna go
over like 13 slides, the rest of
the slides are just an appendix
for your information, turning to
slide 2,
Nessia is comprised of 88 public
school districts, 99 charter
schools, 12 higher educational
entities and 18 other
educational entities. The
authorities served 77,900
employees and dependents with
46,985 lives insured on MMS is

and is managed by an
eleven-member board of directors
consisting of Governor
appointees, New Mexico
Association of School Business
Officials, educational entities
at large, AFT NEA, the Public
Education Commission, School
Board Association, and the
Superintendent.
Turning to slide 3, slide 3
represents Nimsia's
appropriation request for fiscal
year 26, the authorities
requesting an increase in
expenditure authority of 18.54%
in benefits, 16.28% in risk and
5.58% in program support.
For FY 26, the projected impact
to public school support is 39.7
million to fund the employer's
share of premium increases, the
increases consist of 22.1
million for employee benefits
premiums with an average 66%
employer contribution and 17.7
million for risk premiums.
Turning to slide 4.
The risk program consists of
property liability and workers'
compensation, the authority
ensures approximately 35.5
billion in assets, of which 23
billion are frame stucco
construction, the most flammable
type of construction.
60% of properties are located in
protection Class 9 or 10 with 10
being the worst protection
class, and 60% are located in
100 year flood zones.
The authority also insures
46,000 employees, $2.1 billion
in payroll, 345,000 students,
45,000 athletic school
participants and over 11,800
vehicles, including buses.
Turning to slide 5.
The FY 26 risk appropriation
request consists of an increase
in expenditure authority of
$21.7 million 355,200 is
attributed to contractual
expenses, 14.5 million to claims
and 6.7 million to excess
insurance.
Our ending FY 24 fundal is a
negative $11.7 million and we
expect that deficit to grow by
the NISA submitted a special
appropriation request to help
address the fund balance deficit
reduced premiums, offset the
increased self-insured retention
for wind and health claims and
assists in sexual abuse
prevention efforts.
Turning to slide 6.
The risk fund premium for FY 25
increased by an average of
14.99%, depending on the
member's frequencies, severity,
and exposure trends. Nimsia does
use a five-year plan to help
smooth out the increases, the
anticipated increase for FY 26
is a projected 16.91% and NIMS
your board of directors will set
the final rates for FY 26 in
March.
Turning to slide 7.
Slide 7 displays the cost of
property liability and workers'
compensation claims for fiscal
years 18 to 26 fiscal year 25
and 26 are derived from our risk
actuaries during fiscal year
2024, large, large property
claims or and turning to slide
8, slide A includes sexual
abuse, molestation, and
inappropriate touching claims.
These claims include faculty on
student, faculty on faculty and
student on student.
Fiscal year 2023, 2024, and 2025
are still considered immature.
To help reduce these types of
claims, NIMSI was instrumental
in passing House Bill 128,
school personnel background and
training. This bill strengthens
re strengthened reference checks
and reporting standards of
misconduct PED NEMC also
procured an anonymous reporting
system through StopI Solutions
and FY 24 for school districts
and charter schools.
Turning to page 9.
Slide 9 displays property losses
for the last 10 fiscal years
during fiscal year 2019 through
2023, members suffered
significant losses of 65.5
million due to hell and wind
damage.
The projected excess insurance
amount to be received for these
losses is 54.5 million. These
losses caused our wind and he
deductible to increase from 2.5
million to 10 million with an
aggregate of 25 million for FY
24 FY 25 has a self-insured
retention of 10 million per
occurrence.
Turning to slide 10.
Nemsia offers robust employee
benefits, wellness, and
well-being programs. MMCR offers
medical insurance through
Presbyterian and Blue Cross Blue
Shield, dental insurance through
Blue Cross Blue Shield, Delta
Dental and United Concordia,
Vision Insurance through Davis
Vision and Life and Long-term
disability turning a page 11.
The FY 26 benefits appropriation
request consists of a total
increase of $75 million 2.6
million is attributed to
contractual expenses, 70.6
million is attributed to claims
and 1.9 million is attributed to
self-insured premiums.
Our ending FY 24 fund balance is
a negative $133,690. NIMS has
submitted a special
appropriation request to help
address the projected fund
balance deficit, see COVID
reimbursement and reduce premium
turning to slide 12.
The benefits fund premium for FY
25 increased by 10% for medical,
5% for dental, and 3% for
vision. NIMSia does use a
five-year plan to help smooth
out the increases, the
anticipated increases for
Increase for FY 26 is projected
at 10.19% for medical.
The NIMSA board of directors
will set the final rates for FY
26 in March.
Turning to slide 13, slide 13
displays medical, dental,
vision, life and disability
claims costs, fiscal year 2025
and 2026 are projected by
NIMSA's benefit consultant, the
projected costs are derived from
NIMSA's member experience, which
is data contained in NIMSA's
data warehouse and.
And projected industry trends.
Transfer fiscal year 2024 and
2025 or 7% for medical, 14% for
pharmacy and 4% for dental, for
a blended, for a blended trend
of 8.7, turning to slide 14,
slide 14 displays the
distribution of planpaid claims,
15% of members account for 81.5%
of the plan's claims cost when
we compare the claims cost for
fiscal year 23 to 24, we can
see.
that the per member per month
cost for medical services
increased by 7%.
Primarily due to inpatient
admissions due to cancer,
sepsis, and childbirths by
C-section and mental health.
Prescription drugs increased by
18.7% due mostly to oncology and
GLP-1 drugs.
This concludes the presentation
for today, however, we have
included an appendix that
details expenses and cost
containment efforts for our risk
and benefit programs, and with
that I'll stand for any
questions, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair. Um, I, I am looking
through this, and do you not
consider cyber.
Mr. Chair Representative, we do
ensure cybersecurity. That is
one of our um.
Lines of coverage under risk.
Cybersecurity.
OK, so Mr. Chair Representative,
we do cover cybersecurity and we
do have a um.
A, uh, when we cover
cybersecurity, we do have a
policy. We cover that every
year. We do have a self-insured
retention under that policy, and
members, members only pay based
on property values for the
cybersecurity incidents. So what
we have is a retention for
members and a retention for the
authority we have reimbursed
members for those claims.
So at most, I think members will
pay anywhere from 10 to 20,000
for the cost of the
cybersecurity claim, and we will
reimburse the members a portion
of that and then the excess.
I don't know exactly how many
incidents we've had, we have had
incidents over the last 34
years, but there's not many
Mr. Chair,
Among those experiencing
um.
And I was.
Madam Chair Representative,
there has been movement, um, the
board currently has a
subcommittee that's been created
and we're actually evaluating
that and evaluating the funding
formula, and we are looking at
those two issues to make a
recommendation to the full
board.
Madam Chair representative, we
pay that $10 million to $10
million deductible, the
authority does, um, I believe
schools will pay a portion of
that deductible based on their
property values, but depending
on their property values, uh.
That's still not gonna be a
large portion that the school or
the school will pay, so most of
Um, Madam Chair Representative,
I don't have that information on
me, but I can get that
information and send it to you.
You know those numbers are.
Madam Chair Representative, I
Madam Chair Representative, so
we consider anything within 3
years immature, we usually see
claims reported as far back as 4
years, this last year we've seen
claims going back to 1999.
We have two claims going back
that far, um, so names can be
brought up at any point in time,
there is a statute of
limitations. However, if someone
can prove repressed memory, they
Madam Chair, I move the
executive and ask that staff to
look at the, the differences in
the two recommendations.
I apologize.
I'm trying to get this uh moving
faster.
So, good afternoon again, uh,
Madam Chair, members of the
subcommittee, we are now behind,
uh, a tab 3 agency 366, the
public employees Retirement
Association, and with me is Mr.
Miller and Greg Trujillo who is
the executive director of Perra.
Um, I'll just go over the
differences here extremely
quickly because it's, it's um
primarily in one area and that's
in the contracts area. So the uh
only difference there is the LFC
recommendation assumed a lower
amount for, um,
Uh, for, uh, investment
management fees, uh, I'll just
note if you look at the FY 24
actuals column and FY 24, that
was 16 million, um, and so we
felt comfortable keeping that at
26 million for FO 26. Uh, again,
this is another example, uh,
Madam Chair, of where you give
the agency bar authority
typically to increase uh their
budget if they need, if they
find they need additional funds
to enter into those investment
contracts and pay those
investment management. And with
that, I'll just uh
turn it over to Mr. Trujillo for
his presentation.
for
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, members, uh, Greg Tre here
with, uh, with me, just ask.
Save you guys some time or make
up some time. Uh, just a quick
overview on slide 2, we had an
investment return that we
currently have almost 50,000
active uh, last year, the retire
retirement benefits paid out was
1. our funded ratio currently
stands at 67.2% in our
amortization period is at 5.
Uh, Joey covered the budget, so
I'll skip slide 3.
Um, just a quick reminder, there
was a significant legislation
that this body passed in 20 just
a reminder, it changed our cost
of living adjustment formula,
and it also increased
contributions by 4% uh to to uh
was a six-year implementation
where uh the counties and
brought in just over $180
million into the fund recurring
that's on our investment
performance as I stated last
year, we were at 8.66 and slide,
uh just slide we we show 90
happy to send for questions.
Uh, slide 2, talk about to this
date or1.8 billion. So that
unfunded. Um
it's not ideal. And that was the
uh reason for the pension reform
that was a graphic issue, same
thing we see with the benefits
that new members currently earn,
um, so we've made a lot our, our
kind of crunch point right out.
We have had bills in the past to
out, um, nothing that 66 million
for two years, bringing back a
higher a number of other cola
bills, um, additional funding,
uh, the cost of or the uh
Uh, we are making progress,
creating a new tier of benefits,
um, their rates stayed the same.
It's about 20 years for a tier
to take effect.
That's when we see is uh.
committee.
Madame Cherry moved the of Nata
to uh look at the differences
between the two recommendations.
Onto our next item 9 under tab.
you
Uh, Highway 68 on the way. Thank
you. Thank you, Representative.
Yeah, if anybody needs any
concerns, please check in with
your

Commission of Public Records.
With us today is Doctor Rick
Hendricks, the director of the
Commission of Public Records, as
well as Skystone, the DF Asian,
uh, if you would also turn to
pages 125 and 126 and while Sky
and I go over the differences
between the budgets.
So to get right into it, chair.
Members of the committee
The executive recommendation
contains 0.6% more in new
general fund revenue than the
LFC, and this equates to around
22.1,000.
The LFC recommendation maintains
the use of fundal, commensurate
with FY 25, resulting in the
committee recommendation
exceeding the executive by
81.2%.
The executive recommendation
decreases the use of unbalance
for a revenue swap to allow the
agency to utilize more
enterprise revenue in FI 26.
Because of the use of fundal,
commiserate with FI 25, the LFC
recommendation exceeds the
executive.
into the base, the LFC
recommended 0.3% more in
personal services and employee
benefits, then the executive to
reduce the agency's vacancy rate
in this uh equates to the
One additional FTE above the
executive.
The executive recommendation
exceeds the ELC by $100 in
contractual services due to the
executively supporting the
agency's request for an increase
in fixed rates.
Additionally, the LFC
recommendation exceeds the
executive by 1000 and the other
costs category, and the LFC's
recommendation in contractual
services to meet the Department
of Information Technology,
cybersecurity compliance
standards.
With that, I will turn it over
to Sky if there's any additional
comments before turning it over
to Doctor Hendricks.
Thank you
Hendrix.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
I'm Rick Hendricks, uh, State
Records Administrator, the state
Records Center and archives.
And I appreciate the opportunity
to present our fiscal year 2026
budget appropriation request and
for your continued support of
our agency.
I'd like to make an
introduction, uh, Georgette
Chavez is deputy state records
administrators here.
Um
Our chief financial officer
Darlene Martinez is a trapped in
Las Vegas in some snow.
Um
They are part of a highly
qualified team which recently
completed an 8th consecutive
audit with no findings.
I'm proud of their work on
behalf of the people of New
Mexico I'm grateful for their
attendance and support today,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, um, you all
appreciate the importance of
accurate record keeping and
providing access to the records
of state government.
In the interest of public
awareness and open government.
Also know that you appreciate
the important records that
constitute the historical pe or
privilege to safeguard and make
available, um, as you're all
aware, the challenge of
retaining experienced staff and
attracting new employees has
grown significantly in the
post-pandemic high inflation
world, we find ourselves living
in today.
The situation is exacerbated by
a requirement for employees such
as archivists, records managers.
Els analysts who possess highly
developed skill sets.
We have been unable to feel
several key positions.
Which negatively impacts the
level of service we can offer.
In addition, almost all of our
employees are paid well below
midpoint, even though they
performed their jobs in an
effective and efficient manner
and have done so for years.
More of the agency is
experiencing severe salary
compaction because new employees
are typically more expensive
than employees to attempt to
begin addressing the salary
issues we're requesting funding
to fill vacant positions and
provide modest salary increases
to some employees.
In addition, Sarcia is
requesting additional funding
for the ongoing cybersecurity
protection.
In the past year we had to
purchase new hardware and
software which require frequent
upgrades and replacement.
Management and staff will
continue to cooperate with the
Department of Information
Technology and its contractors
to reach cybersecurity
compliance through
identification of
vulnerabilities, the upgrade of
software and equipment.
Managing network security,
managing user privileges and
increasing awareness of
management and staff.
Uh, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, um, that concludes my
presentation, um, and we'll be
happy to try to answer any
questions. Thank you for your
time and your consideration.
I thank you so much for, uh,
your presentation and the work
that you do, um, as
An advocate of 20 years, um, I
always appreciated the access to
public records, uh, on various
issues, both local and state,
um, I just have a couple of
questions, um, and also wanna
support uh the increased
staffing chair, um, and so
first, I'm wondering who do
these public records belong to?
Madam Chair, members of the
commissioner.
They belong to the people of New
Mexico.
I mean, if, if that's
Yes. Thank you. Um, and if a
public body.
Uh, ask the state commission on
public records for relief from a
vexatious requester.
Do you, does the commission have
the ability to adjudicate these,
these uh circumstances. So Madam
Chair, a representative, um, we,
we have seen a bill filed that
is addressing this this issue
and we, we will gonna begin an
analysis of that tomorrow. Um,
I don't know that I'm qualified
to say whether the commission
would have the authority to do
that currently we don't have any
sort of um.
Authority to um
Um, do anything like that, um,
and for that matter, um.
I don't believe the Attorney
general does either, um, in, in.
In the idea of um the concept of
a vexatious um request or um is
something that's never been
presented to us before?
And I, it's never come before
the commission.
So, um, the, the way it's
outlined, I'm, I'm since you
mentioned it, I'm sure you've
seen the text of the bill, uh,
it, it would involve us, um,
holding a hearing, uh, I mean.
As state records administrator,
I would do the formalities to
set up a meeting and then the
commission would actually
conduct a hearing and and then
say um uh public entity would
make a request to consider an
individual of vexatious
requester, um, and there's some
particularity spelled out um in
that bill about how that might
happen, um, and, um.
Again, we're going to be
discussing that and we'll be
filing a uh some sort of
response about what we think is
uh going on with that bill, um.
But currently that's a totally
new concept, um, as far as I'm
concerned, um, it's never been
brought to me or to the
commission, um.
About that, yeah, so that's
something new. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Uh, thank you, Mr.
Hendricks. So just a follow up.
Um, you, the commission
currently does not have the
authority nor the structure to
uh hold hearings to adjudicate
or have the ability to find
someone under those
circumstances,
Madam Chair Representative, um,
and as far as holding a hearing.
Um, the way it's outlined in
that piece of legislation, um, I
could issue a notice, uh, inform
all of the individuals, um, and
they could have a hearing, um,
but, um, I'm not aware of any
sort of authority that the
commission has.
In statute now to um do anything
beyond having that hearing, um,
and it looked to me as though
the the outcome would be that um
the entity would petition for
someone to be declared vexatious
based on.
Uh
Something that would be argued
before the commission and then
the commission would then have
to determine whether or not
they.
Though in fact that was the
case, um, vexatious has a legal
definition.
Um, it doesn't, I mean, again,
I'm not a lawyer, but the just
the quick reading of the legal
definition seems to be something
maybe different that might be
argued in this case it seems to
me like this would be someone
who was making repetitive IPRA
requests.
Um
And um
I'm, I'm not sure how that would
be handled, but uh the the
commission of public records.
And state records administrator
we don't have any sort of um
authority to enforce there's no
enforcement built into any of
our activity.
And that goes to the, for
example, for when if someone um
Is making the rules filing and
they don't follow the
regulations for the rules
following, um, we can't.
Point that out to them we're
limited to be able to, we can
say, um.
Your filing is not in the right
form, um.
There are grammar mistakes that
we, but, but in terms of
enforcing something that was not
in compliance with all the
regulations we, we don't have
that and um I, I'm guessing that
the only person who could pursue
that would be the Department of
Justice.
Thank you. We have our motion in
place. Thank you.
Good afternoon again, Madam
Chair, uh, and here at the table
again is uh Arianna V Hill with
the Department of Finance and
Administration and Dylan Lang,
who is the state personnel
director. As you mentioned, we
are behind tab 3 at agency code
378. I'll just very briefly go
over the differences between the
LFC and the executive
recommendation. It will appear
on your different sheet as
though there's a very sizable
recommendation, uh, difference,
but again, this comes down to
methodology, mostly. So, uh, Spo
requested a very large
increased to support its
operations as it uh works with
LFC and DFA to implement the
findings of a recent personnel
study that you all have, uh,
that you all funded and uh we've
been conducting over the past
year. Um, I'll, I'll leave, uh,
some of the, some of the
explanation of that to Director
Lang, um, and how that's going
to change department operations.
I'll just note that LFC
recommendation made the choice
to fund that expansion in the
growth fund. So it's not showing
up on
because it shows up there. Uh,
just a reminder, you'll see that
um on
Uh, page 4 of your packet, um,
that's the special supplemental
deficiencies different sheet.
I'll just remind you, you're not
voting on that today, but the
reason the LFC recommendation is
so much lower than the executive
recommendation is because we
choose to fund that in the
growth fund. One thing I will
mention about the growth fund
that's not here, if you add
that, it's actually the LFC is a
little bit higher. Uh, the LFC
recommendation also, uh,
includes, um, some additional
funds for Spo to take over what
we've called the
Performance Academy. So the
performance academy is something
LFC and DFA have been doing to
uh help uh departments as you
undertake this growth process,
uh, that's really, it's really
about, uh, agency staff learning
how to manage for manage for
results and understand
performance management. SO is
the agency and state government
that is, that, that conducts our
training, it's appropriate for
them to uh continue this rather
than uh a joint um.
Uh, LFC DFA type process will
remain actively engaged,
obviously with director Lang. We
have a, we have a pretty good
working relationship and, um,
we'll go on. So with that, um,
unless, um Ms. Viha has any
comments, I'll just hand it over
to Director Lang for his
presentation.
Good, good afternoon. Um, thanks
for staying, you know, we're
here at the end. Just so you
know, um, I'm, I'm joined by
our, our, our great staff here,
um, Jaime Trujillo, who's our
ASD director and and Cynthia
Cynthia Sandoval, who is, um,
head of our workforce planning.
Um, they're both classified
employees here at at at state
personnel office, we um
administer, um, uh, the law and
rules related to classified uh
DFA also happens to be
classified employees, so always
sell because I do just so you
know.
I'm, I'm very honored to be here
generally. I am from New Mexico.
Um, I, I, I went to school here,
so it's always a great honor.
Before I get into the budget,
even though I was told to be
quick, um, I want this to be a
two-way street, right? So I
mean, uh, what, what Cynthia is
in charge of our recruitment
team, which we'll get into
generally, but if you ever have
any questions about that you're
hearing from your constituents
about what's going on in state
government or hey, even if you
want to have a rapid hire,
right, for some jobs that you
all have in your district. Reach
out. I have my, I have my cards.
I know that you're getting tons
of cards, so I'm.
I'm going to stop from giving
you my card, but please
consider, uh, consider this and
and reach out to us and, and
everybody but, but Perra, I
think, actually uses state
personnel as their HR services,
generally, so we do provide HR
for them. It saves about 100.
$1000 in a in a HR FTE. So, um,
I will start at the, at the, the
second to last page here,
because I just want to highlight
everything that's the state
personnel office is charged with
doing pursuant to statute,
right? So again, we talked about
HR services. We do provide HR
services to smaller agencies
who, who don't want to or can't
afford um HR workforce planning
that, that, that Cynthia
Sandoval is in charge of. Um,
we, we look at certain personnel
actions, right? to to ensure
that they comply with um a
state, state law and state rule.
And also certain actions that
could potentially flag, um, a
fraud, waste or abuse, right? So
extreme we uh uh uh increases in
salary, um, any sort of
reclasses and pay bands, right?
And so, uh, we do that also
reclasses, reorganizations that
all takes state personnel office
approval, um, training and
development, we have, you know,
over, over 166 courses that we
provide to um uh the state
employees, right, only, only one
of which is mandatory, which is
civil rights.
And managers have to take one
manager training, um, but again,
we have a great, uh, team that
that is further developing those
uh uh trainings if you want,
again, recruitment, labor
relations, uh, right? So we, we,
we, we help and uh uh negotiate
with the unions and all the um.
This dispute happens,
adjudication, uh, if you are a
classified employees, you have
certain uh uh employment rights,
including, right, uh, to have a
hearing if you are dismissed and
needed. Um, these are part of
your rights and so we have a
adjudication division generally.
Um, I, I'm appointed by the
governor and the board, right,
uh, a state personnel board, um,
who actually make um the final
actions on a lot of things. Most
importantly, um, to, to, to Mr.
Simon's point, uh, uh,
compensation and classification.
Um, we set the pay bands, we set
the
salary schedules and tomorrow,
uh, in the Senate Finance at
1:30 we'll be presenting on, on
Java architecture. I've had the
great fortune to uh twice
already talk about the, the um
year uh in front of the interim
committee, so we, we, that is
something um that has been
highlighted. Deloitte has, has,
has found some deficiencies um
in in the state that we believe
state personnel office can, can,
can fill, uh, most importantly,
when it does come to, to
classification and compensation,
we are going to be moving to one
salary structure.
instead of and we're going to
move to, to, we haven't decided
a smaller amount of, of pay
grades, but I'll just tell you
20 to 25 instead of 112, right?
So we, we are trying to
streamline it and give agencies
way more flexibility generally.
This will fundamentally change
the how our office operates in
classification and compensation.
And when you, when you hear
other agencies talk to you about
staffing deficiencies about um
um issues that they're having,
right? This, this new structure
of successful will really give
them the flexibility, right, to
pay.
What, what, what, what market
says, right? We have a very
internal process, internal
valuation process, we assign
points to certain jobs and we
say that's how much um you can
pay that job, and we kind of
look at the market data to do
this now we're we're our own
internal valuations because uh
uh here, here, uh, agencies and
staff hiring managers and
subject matter experts know,
right, how much we can be, uh,
how much we should be paying
these, these, this will be a
large change and this will
require uh necessarily more
staffing. Spo has made a flat
budget request uh for at least
last 5 years. This is, um, uh,
what we have requested about,
I'll just say a million dollars.
And again, that is 20, that's
25% of our budget 20, 23% of our
budget where, you know, uh, not
to pick on the State investment
council that they're, they're
shorted 1 million, that's a 1%,
right? So it is a large request,
though it's not a not not a uh
people and we have the plans and
the outcomes in place because of
this compensation study to, to
effectuate that. I do, um, uh,
uh, thank the LFC for, for
giving um us in the, in the.
Federal fund uh the software
we'll need to move to market,
but um that's basically the
overview, uh, I, I know that
that this money is in growth
funds is tasked with um trying
to, to educate and, and, um,
Create a training in conjuns
Academy and about outcomes based
and evidence-based budgeting and
we look forward to that. And if,
if, if we need to use um uh uh
our ourselves as a, as a guinea
pig, then we're And uh we have a
list here of representative Dow.
Thank you for the presentation.
Um, going to stop the need to
transfer.
Uh,
Madam Chair Representative, um,
no, I mean, we can, you could
probably look at at legislation
to try to stop, to stop and do
that. Um, but what this will
allow you to do is pay uh more
flexibly, uh, uh, your, your
staff based on, based on the on
the classification, but that is
a problem. I think that would
probably take some, some, some
legislative fixing, um, you
know, uh, Los Alamos, a National
Laboratory, you know, has a
provision a certain amount of
time. We don't have that
language. We have a probationary
period that is a year.
long, but you can, um, yeah, I
know you transfer, but you can
move jobs, um, if you want
freely, but ultimately, I think
there has been a compensation
that there will be a
compensation shift where you can
actually compensate, uh, uh, and
use the state personnel board
rules and our guidance to
actually provide raises, provide
um other compensation be uh uh
incentives to employees without
having them transferred. This
will give
hear a lot from.
20 and 30,000 Madam Chair,
Representative, it, it could
when with a, with a um a strong
focus at an agency level and a
commitment to compensation,
right? So, uh, we, we at state
personnel office have, have
spent a lot of time increasing
the salary structure, right? So
we don't dictate pay, but we,
we, we say how much you can
actually pay with the point and
what the maximum is. And so as
we do that, right, with market
influxes, you can then
compensate new people from
coming in more without looking
at the people who've been there
always, but that's a comp with
this change and
with, you know, training and,
and, and guidance from from
state personnel we'll make sure
that, that when you're looking
at internal alignment, that's
really what you're looking for.
It's about appropriate
placement. Where does this
person fall within a division
based on pay, education,
experience, knowledge, ability,
skills, cer certification as a
whole board rule. And then how
does it, and then internal
alignment. How does that all
align? Because we don't want to
cause pay inequities, right? And
so, um, that's
Hopefully with, with our
training in this.
Um
For the performance um
is average number of days to
How long it
I guess
Madam Chair, Representative
Dixon, we have, um, so, so, so
that's, that was good with the
support of LFC and the staff
here, you know, we, we are
measured this at state personnel
office, but individual hiring,
right? So it's not, it is, it's
a measurement for spo, um, uh,
what we did measure is, yeah,
when it's because that's the
time that um if somebody needs 2
weeks to start, if somebody um
do that, we also have continuous
postings, right? And so we we we
we we we took that on the
calculation. So we believe this
better reflects what we wish.
that number was lower and we're
actively working, um, uh, uh,
uh, to, to, to encourage and,
and check and audit, right?
Um, Madam Chair Representative
Dixon, so any, any state agency
executive in the executive
control like state personnel,
right? Um
You don't, you, you don't get.
tell her
I'll I'll just say that. But if
you are in a a different elected
official in the executive or the
legislative, and so that could
be an incentive.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair.
You follow uh hiring of civil
servants.
Madam Chair, Representative
Dixon, yeah, we try, um, you
know, we try to, uh, um, use,
uh very creative ways, but also
compensation. I mean, our
benefits, right? I think there's
a whole write up about our
benefits, um, generally, people,
we, we see an influx, if you see
how many new hires that we have
coming out of the state, uh,
we're at record numbers last
year over 1000, so external from
the state coming in. So uh it's
a very uh exciting place to be
right now. I know the vacancy
rates, you know, are high. I
think those
are more attributed to
Position creation the the
endless debate about a funded or
unfunded vacancy, I think we
just need to to utilize our
positions a little bit better.
Um, but we are seeing record
numbers of, of individuals
coming into this mean we I'll
just tell you from aO
perspective, we have an
internship, which I didn't, when
we do our internship, it's also
all state jobs are also on my
business card, get one to you
just scan it, but um our
internship program, we have, we
have lists that are just
gigantic, um, you know, over 30.
2025, we have multiple people
from outside of the state just
to come in here, people come to
the interview with their
carry-on. Um, we don't really
see that at the Willie Ortiz
building in the middle of of of
the city. So um we we're, we're
excited about kind of where
we're going, I think, I think,
of course, we can always be
better, but I mean, this is an
opportunity with job architect
actually means for for public
ser service, and I think a lot
of people are excited just
because of all the benefits that
A background in working with our
executive
Positions. Yeah, yes, thank you,
Madam Chair, I think, you know,
because ultimately, I think that
at the first phase of the
compensation, you bring
everybody to minimum, right? We
found some gaps um in that and
um LFC uh funded, funded this
job architecture program, right?
Uh, or not program, but I guess
this development, right? To
further, to further understand
what the class, right? You hear
all the time, I'm, I'm, I'm in
this position, but this is not
what I do, right? I'm a manager,
but I don't know if I manage.
And so, how about we figure out
what they actually do first.
And then we can figure the um
tethered to that, right? Because
fundamentally we're a
merit-based system here and you
should, uh, your, your
compensation should um measure
um the merit that, that, that
you have and you bring. And so
with this, we're, we're excited
about the next our involvement
more, more to validate, you
know, agencies validating that
information. Um, so we're
excited about that wisdom Ready,
um, um.
I'm trying to move the LFC and
ask staff to look at the
differences in the two
recommendations.
I thank you again. Thank you.
I'm, I'm sorry the credit really
isn't mine. It's the, the people
behind me and our staff. So
thank you for all the work you
do. Thank you very much.
