All right thank you chair
of the more we're back on the bill
would you like to tell us what we're doing
of course thank you madam chair and
thank you members
so house bill 165
is.
Creating a web based
tool for
native American students
native American educators
tribes published in
nations
how's that PED in
order to house
various
studies
various.
Deep dives into
educational policy as it
relates to native American
education native American
students
of course that's one
part of the Martinez
Yazzie lawsuit
and this is really modeled
after the and
the next bill bill which here is
modeled after the
federal education's
clearing house which
which houses
various studies and
information
and data collected on
educational
initiatives
throughout the
the federal government some looking
to create something here
specifically for
those mentioned in
the Martinez Yazzie lawsuit
on because we know we keep
hearing a lot
of information lot of
information has been collected
but there isn't a unified
place to house any of
that so the stripping of
the appropriation was
because in talks with the pope
further talks with the public education
department because of what was
in house bill to the
Department has
indicated that they have
the capacity to do
this without the
appropriation.
So with that madam chair also stand for
questions.
Excellent thank you is
there anyone in our
audience that would like to comment
very briefly on
this.
Staff are we staying
anyone.
Madam chair I don't see any hands
of. All right
let's go to committee any questions
on this bill.
The
impact.
Second.
All right motion
by
Representative Anderson second
by Representative
Trujillo
for ado passed as
amended are there
any objections to that
motion.
All right thank you dependence
on house bill
165
groundhog day on 166
I think I am
sure Romero it
is thank thank you
madam chair and thank you committee for
165166
is for the at risk portion
of the Martinez Yazzie
madam chair you all should have
another amendment which
is the exact same
groundhog day stripping the
amendment so
thank you committee
it's
222612.14
house bill 166
for the record on page 1
line 12 strikes making
appropriation on
page 2 line 243
page 3 line 6
strike section 2 and
its entirety
if somebody would move the amendment
for
discussion.
Thank you and I'll second that any
questions on the
amendment.
Any objections to adopting
the meant the
amendment.
All right seeing David and
chair Romero you have an
amended bill they're back
on the bill would you tell us
what we're doing
thank you madam chair thank you committee
so again it's
setting up that web based
tool to
compile all
of the information as it
pertains to you
special education students
English language learners
the other parts of the
Martinez Yazzie
consult.
Into one place
this is in collaboration with
the legislative education study committee
legislative finance committee
because we're all gathering various
bits of information
data on these
on on the performance
measures for these
groups
in any sort of
study so we can
pass the public education department
to compile
it.
After the federal
education
departments tool
for sorry
share more so but he needs to
mute if
you're
a needed I'd appreciate it
thank you sorry for the interruption
please continue okay
thank you thank you madam chair
so again it's modeled
after the the federal
program but
it's a basically
the duplicate of
of house bill 165
except
166.
And with that madam chair I'll stand for
questions.
Thank you and before we go to the
audience and committee could you tell us
about the appropriation on
this one.
I'm sorry.
I'm I'm sorry madam chair
again with
conversations from the public education
department that they they
indicated they have enough
capacity currently
or headed into the next fiscal
year in order to carry this
initiative.
All right thank you we'll
go to the audience do we have
anyone in the audience
wanting to speak on this
bill.
Madam chair I don't see any
hands. Right
thank you very much then we'll go to
committee will start with representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair I think
you representative so this
web the web
166 is
is a tool for out at
risk students
the 165
is Pacific we for native
American students are
they going to be
combined.
Madam chair and and
representative Armstrong
on the ideas that they would eventually
be combined into 1
space the reason for the
2 bills is
because for
the the
hard dealing with native
American students
the tribes in any
information that they
would provide
for for
the the web
platform
would enter into an
intergovernmental
agreement with the public education
department as
to their
content the
house bill 166
would convene
a a small advisory
group in order
to.
Put together the pieces so to
speak for at
risk for at
risk students mentioned in
the in house bill
166 so
it's a little bit different process
which is the reason for the 2 different
bills okay
thank you madam chair that's
all.
Thank you Representative
Anderson.
Madam chair my questions
been answered in
the.
Thank you.
All right thank you I don't see any other
hands to we have a motion
from the committee chairman over the
past
second.
So motion by
Representative Trujillo second
by Representative Dixon for to
pass as amended
are there any objections
to that
motion.
All right at your Romero
you have to to pass
as amended bills and
people say it's tough to come before
this committee excellent
I'm betting 100 in this committee I
appreciate madam chair thank you
committee thank
thank you all right
next on the agenda house bill
79 do
we have a the representative
Ely or my ****
in our audience
staff.
All right.
Yes point of information
I I read
I read this bill and it was
very unclear to me how
this bill got to us
madam
chair.
Thank you for that question
Representative I
it is my understanding
as the you know sub
sub sub chair
that all crime bills
are coming here because they do
ultimately have a fiscal
impact
so just as a matter
of course they were directed
here thank
you. Madam
chair yes
Representative
I believe that representative Ely
is and house judiciary
would you like for me to let him know
at that time at some
point you could come over to
present absolutely
if you would and and when we see
him economic will wrap up where
we are and go go to
him quickly.
So thank you I appreciate
that.
Okay so what

have.
It in communication
with our bill Sanchez

121.
House bill
131.
House bill

And house bill

and we have been told on
all of those that we can
table them so they would
be tabled with the permission
of the sponsor Representative
Chatfield you have a question on
that.
You are
muted.
Table.
No easy was that all right
we have a lot of proper
motion and a
second to table
those bills
as I read out
121131143

Madam chair with him right here
all right so thank
you Representative

madam chair when I just want to let the
committee know that I do have Secretary
Katrina hold from
Lopez who's the secretary of
aging long term services
department and timing Hernandez
who's the policy director for the Alzheimer's
association in the as
expert witnesses should that be
necessary
however of house bill
175
would allow the
aging and long term services
department to utilize
up to 2000
$200000
from the key surveyed your senior
dignity Fund
in 2023 to
engage in a pilot program
that would allow them to community based
and culturally appropriate outreach
regarding dementia
forms such as
Alzheimer's.
Thank you.
All right thank you Representative
Serrato
let's go to the audience is there
anyone who would like to speak
on this

175.
Madam chair
of the A.
R. P. Representative

so I'm gonna on
the all right
thank you very
much.
Welcome to House Appropriations
you have one
minute.
Is that double A. R. P.
Representative able
to can you

sorry about that I think
we were muting and
muting
I'm.
I'm madam chair
members of the committee I'm
Jim Hambrick following tier
advocate with a a RP
New Mexico to be
brief I would just say a
a RP stands in
support.
Thank you. That
is great thank you very
much.
Any other audience
members on this
bill.
Okay let's go to committee
representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
Representative for bringing this I heard
this in in the help
committee but I didn't
really realize that
you needed permission to
use the case of
a trust fund and then
I also noticed in FY are
that it's recurring
is
that.
Do you need permission to use the
Q. surveyed Fund.
Thank you madam
chairman thank you Representative
I let me look at this
any this should be
updated version of this
because we did have a committee
substitute
should be for one time
because it's a pilot
program and would allow
them to you and any unencumbered
or utilize funds go back into
the queue Survey dressing your dignity
Fund after that
this pilot program.
And I believe there's a second part I may not
answer.
Okay that's fine I just
got a message
that I I believe it's all
well so I was just
curious about that so thank you very
much madam chair.
Thank you Representative
Anderson thank you
madam chair of
one of my questions was answered
but my second question
is to really I
suppose madam chair to the
staff of that is
is the second
time we have
appropriated
of.
Funding out of the key piece of
8 or fund or is the
first time question.
Madam chair.
Their in house bill
2 bears are are
appropriations from that fund
for use of the
ageing
Department.
Thank you but so
this would be an admission
the end to that
I a second
item. That's
correct and right now
there's about a $4000000
balance in that fund
after the probation
and house bill
2.
Thank you madam chair that
answers my
question.
All right thank you and representative
Armstrong your hand is up
again.
Yes madam chair I just wanted to
let you know that these are
secretary
Katrina hotel Lopez cannot
raise our hand and she had some
answers thank you madam
chair.
Thank you and and
secretary of health
Lopez if you are able
to we would love to
have your input on this
hearing.
Can she be
admitted.
Madam chair I don't see
her on the of
10 the
list.
Madam chair but
Representative Anderson
here maybe somebody
is prepared to make a
motion.
Well I would like to hear from secretary
of state has something to
add
Representative Serrato unfortunately
I don't think that we are
able to
have her join us at this
point I'm
not I.
Think I feel that the
the committee is probably in
favor of this and certainly
given the fund balance of the Kiki
Senator but at
4000000 to have
this pilot project
appropriation
I don't think is.
It's going to be to controversy
also.
What do passed.
Second.
Representative Dixon first is
that what you were
yes yes
I'm here so we have a
proper motion Representative
Trujillo proper second from
Representative Dixon is there
any objection
this is for their
health and Human Services
Committee substitute for house bill
175.
Any objections to that
motion.
All right Representative structure you have
a do pass and please give our
apologies to the secretary
for being able to
join. Thank you
madam chairwoman thank you committee I
will. Thank
you.
All right we are moving
on 2
unless we have Representative
Eli are my assistance
and have somebody will just let me know
if they're able to join us we're
gonna go to house bill
7 as
amended
Representative
Dixon.
Thank you madam chair
yes I would like to
present house bill
7
to our
committee
and.
Right I don't
know that we
need.
Do we need an amendment for
this madam
chair.
The reason
that.
Here is it creates
a fund but it
is subject to appropriation
and that's why that's
there we don't we don't
need to amend.
And bill the money is in house bill
to correct that is
correct
70000000.
All right so Representative would
you tell us about the bill
please thank you madam
chair house bill
7 is the opportunity
enterprise fund
and it's a partnership
in funding program that's
created within the New Mexico
finance authority
and I should mention at this point
that
Marquita Russel I
saw is in the
attendees and she can
find answers
should we have questions
about the role of the finance
authority but
this fund is designed to
support local communities
that want to build and
invest in commercial
or entrepreneurial
space to
directly support their economic
development initiatives
and with that madam chair I would
stand for questions.
All right thank you very much
let's go to the audience first is
there anyone in our audience would like
to offer input on house bill
7.
Hands madam chair
all right thank you very much we'll
go to committee Representative
Hochman Vigil.
Thank you very much madam chair
thank you Representative Dixon
for this exciting
bill I just had a couple of
clarifying questions for
you madam chair
representative can you
distinguish for me the types
of enterprises
or businesses that could
benefit from this bill
verses you know
local economic Economic
Development Act funds and one
why this bill is necessary
in addition to
Lida.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
Representative Hochman Vigil
I'm I would say that it's a classic
chicken and egg situation
and that a lot of times
particularly in our smaller
communities
they may not have
the dedicated
innovation hub
maker space
industrial park
where they
know that their community
will benefit when it is
available and so this is
a partnership to allow
communities to work together
with
developers the county
city and
really. Get
those projects off the
ground.
Thank you very much madam chair representative
so I think what I'm hearing is
rather than time
projects to the availability of
needed money money and the
economic development department this
bill would allow
projects to work directly within
their communities with
support from the state.
Madam chair representative
yes that's correct and the other thing
is lead it does have provisions
that require a certain number of jobs
to be created and
so this sort of goes back to the chicken
and egg situation.
Thank you very much chair
representative so sounds like a
seed funding opportunity for
me that's very exciting for the state
thank you.
Thank you Representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
Representative I'm so
is are these going to be
grants or loans
or
that's my first question my second
question is how are we going to make
sure that this
is
received in the communities that
needs to be received in and not
given to places that
already have this
availability.
Thank you madam chair and
representative Armstrong those are wonderful
questions so
let me start first with that
too
mechanisms that are available
to local communities
and developers
so the first would be
financing
under that
method the
state actually
sorry New Mexico finance
authority and the fund
the opportunity enterprise
fund actually
builds and
owns the
property so
in conjunction with
a local community who
says we need
this economic
development
project
the state would provide the
financing to
build the
project and
then contract
with GSD
in a master lease agreement
to lease out the
property the
second
option is
alone because
we can't do requests right
I mean it is an economic
development activity but
the second way to do this is through
alone and
NMFA through the
opportunity enterprise
funds can either
find a loan
directly or work with a
commercial
bank in in New
Mexico a
federally.
Secured
banking institution
to provide a loan
guarantee
no in short
your the second part of your
question how do we know
that this is going to
benefit all communities across
the state and sort of
the communities that really
want a particular
project.
This this fund set up a
board that includes
representatives
from not
only are agencies that
deal with economic
development
but the goal
of having a review board
is so that
a small community
can partner with
let's say a developer who
is able to build
this let's say
I'm a maker
space.
For their small
entrepreneurs for commercial
kitchen is
another example
but funding is not
available they've been seeking
funding and it's not
available the
city of the
town the county
can come to the review board
with the proposal
that is fleshed out
and shows that there
is local community support
for this initiative that
funding options have
been looked at but they
are either unavailable
or not
complete after
which the review board
can make a recommendation
to say we believe that
this project should be
funded.
Okay thank you madam chair and
so well
that board be the one that sets
up the interest rates
what type of interest rates will
be charged on these
loans.
Thank you madam
chair and representative so the
interest rate that
what we started with
was 0
percent but
given the financial
market there may be times
when this
the fund could actually charge
a higher interest rate and it would
still
be
an advantage to the
community to use that
so
the
opportunity enterprise
fund could potentially
do a larger interest
rate
and I don't know
if his
Russell is on
and can
say.
Who sets the interest rate
that's part of the contract
with that the
project
and so
I can take a look
because I don't want to provide
incorrect information for
potentially she might be able
to answer
that.
I'm curious about that as well
staff to we seeing this
rests on the
audience.
Panelists.
There you are I am
the Kita thank
you did you hear the
question I did madam
chair and the
of the act provides
the New Mexico finance
authority would establish
those rules and
so again there will be rules
their interest rates for direct
lending versus
guarantees so there will be different
interest rates and play or
different fees in play
based on the kind of transaction
that is being requested
about the finance authority
would have to establish the
interest rate by
rural.
Okay thank you madam
chair and thank you Representative
and and Marquita out
the only other question I have
is what my
plan for a lot more but I can
ask offline but the other
question main question I have
is what if they
default.
What is put up for
collateral is that
is that part of this
the the
picture and
but mainly what is the
default.
I'm thank you madam chair
and representative Armstrong
and that's a great question and
obviously ensuring that
we are practicing sort
of good governance policies
was very important and so
not only we put in
transparency measures but there
are club Act
provisions
under the first scenario of course
the state would actually
own the property
I'm sorry the fund would own the
property the second
provision there would
be a call
back
provisions in the contract
for the project and
I don't know is Russell
wants to expand on
that.
Madam chair would mention that in the
second provision we're we're making
the loan for the
for the building we would take a
mortgage on that building so
we would have an interest in the
building so they default would
be in a position to
either release the facility
or sell the facility but we
do have remedies
provided in the in
the instance in which
they're not able to make payments in
the default.
Okay thank you very much
and and one more question
I'm sorry madam chair
but how was this fund
going to be
are refunded
I mean every year besides
appropriations is there any
other revenues for
this to keep going
on.
Thank you madam chair and
representative so yes there
are 2 ways in which
the fund would be replenished
on the first way
is through the
financing mechanism
and once the property
is built and
the fund enters
into a master lease
agreement with GST
GST would be
negotiating a rental
agreement with the
private.
Our partner
GS D. would then be
paying back the
amount of the mortgage in
essence to the
opportunity enterprise fund
GSD would also be able
to charge sufficient
fees to cover
maintenance
and
appropriations so
if there is additional
fund money from
that that would actually go into
the state general
fund. Under
the loan
scenario
the loan repayments
would go into the opportunity
enterprise fund.
Thank you madam chair thank you for
answering the questions.
Thank you Representative
Anderson.
Okay. I
would not be you madam
chair of.
I'm trying to
of if I could real
quick have a repeat of
that last answer
on a
sustaining funding
and particularly
of how the refill
occurs representative
on the requests I
understand on the loans
I missed that part could
you give me a quick repeat
thank
you.
Thank you madam chair and
representative Anderson so there
are no grants under this
particular scenario
under the first
scenario
financing and leasing
the fund would be
replenished
through
a portion of the rent
payments that
would go back into the opportunity
enterprise fund the
second scenario
of the loan payment
from the private partner
or the municipality
would go into the
opportunity enterprise
fund
and.
So that money would go back
in thank you very
much I didn't.
Because of your response
on requests I understand
exactly thank you madam
chair.
All right thank you I see no
other hands up will remind the
committee there's
$70000000
of for this opportunity
enterprise Act and house bill
2 contingent on
this bill passing
so
with that do I have a
motion from the committee.
Madam chair I
make a motion for it to
pass.
And Representative
Castellano I'm sorry who seconded
it how can be hard to be
here all right thank you have
a proper motion and second
for the past anyone
object to that
motion.
We have Representative
Armstrong.
That's the only one I see
objecting so
please note one
all right thank you very much you
have a do pass
Representative.
In the next
on the agenda is house
bill 151 we are rolling
that went over I
believe is that correct
Representative Hochman Vigil
I'm not sure that was not
my knowledge I have come from
the funds are in the Senate
side.
Okay then I have a little like
rollover note that I'll ignore
I wrote it myself so
the state I don't know what I'm doing
so you're you're by my
for a moment
yes.
I've been told by the representative
HochmanVigil and other
people if these
bodies in deterrence and
finance
amendments however
we have not seen the
amendments and I
know that there are
Madam chair Lundstrom
would actually want to see
these the members before this bill
goes out.
It's all a you madam
chair. Thank
you bill I appreciate that so
that that's why I wrote that
note Representative
so I I think
if we can get those
if we can get confirmation on
that before tomorrow perhaps
we could put it on tomorrow's agenda
thank you mentor I have got 2 bills
in the same scenario so I
will make sure that we
I now have hi is on
this money and we
can roll over tonight and then we can
act more hopefully if we meet
thank you all right now
thank you I appreciate it
all right so that takes us to
house bill 164
Representative
Sarinana.
Thank you madam
chair.
House bill 167 the
uranium mine cleanup
I do have expert I'm not sure
she's on W. secretary
Bruce she on

Area okay
was we'll see how far
we can go and then I'll text them
Senator Steinborn if you need to madam
chair okay all right
perfect and Representative you
have an amendment I
do madam chair but it does
not have a number on it.
It doesn't your rate
is that the.
You're
very member of your.
All right
would somebody move the amendment
for discussion please
thank first.
So.
And also if
any objection
all right Representative Sarinana
would you tell us what the amendment that
are it's it's breaking
making appropriation and taking
a whole professional
way.
It
was.
1 line 19
striking making
appropriation and then on pages
5 and 6 striking section
for in its entirety is that
correct.

There you go can you hear me now
madam chair yes
thank you Mr okay
thank you so much thank you
madam chairman della Duran
I represent to uranium
mining companies that have
yet to
mind their properties in
New Mexico however
they certainly
support the principle
and the goal of uranium
reclamation the
real problem in New Mexico
madam chair is
the smaller of
legacy abandoned
uranium mines
and of the
mining and minerals division
at EMNRD has
historically
taken the lead on
these mines and
the since the majority
of the probation involves
house bill 2 and the junior
bill are going to
the environment department my
clients are hopeful
that the 2 agencies
of will work
together for the
for the best outcome
and we would
also like
of the committee to know madam
chair that my clients are
willing to
lend any expertise
toward to coordinating
efforts over the next
year thank you so much
madam chair.
Thank you anyone
else in the public to offer

Madam chair I have my hand
up should I go
ahead yes
please miss Dior
the woman I opened.
Your name I'm sorry that's all
right thank you
hi Camillus I am and
I'm the director of the Rio
Grande chapter of
the Sierra Club
representing over 30
5000 members and
supporters here
and strong
supports
on H. B.
164 New
Mexico has 260
uranium mines
and about 130 of
them have not been cleaned
up the USEPA
has designated to uranium
mills at Superfund
sites the designation
reserved for the most contaminated
sites in the country
this legislation and
funding allows us to begin
to fix the problem
thank you for your
support.
Thank you anyone
else offering input
on H. B.
164.
Videos madam chair.
All right thank you
and Representative
Sarinana
for that my my co chair at
Anthony Allison also
I believe yes.
Yes thank you so we'll now
go to the committee and we will begin
with your co chair representative
Allison.
Thank you madam chair I
want to speak in support of this
because of there's
a lot of uranium mines in
my district
around COVID zona
and shipped out
in fact there's a big tailing in
Shiprock and the federal
government is really really
slow in getting anything started
so I believe
that this legislation
will put a
spark to them or put a process
to get the
movie thank you madam
chair nighters a committees
for.
Thank you Representative
Allison Representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair
so part of my aunts
my question was answered but
I'm curious to know why we're
not letting
these become
Superfund sites and
letting the federal government help
us clean these up
I've heard a little bit about super
funds but
if we start creating
a fund to clean up something
that the federal government
should be helping
with I'm
wondering how what that puts
us.
Where that puts
us.
Thank you madam chair
I might have to defer that
when so super fun
just allows EPA to clean up
contaminated sites but it forces
the parties responsible
for the contamination to either perform
the cleanup or reimburse the
government for EPA lead
cleanup work
right.
Part of the state of
I don't know the federal government can claim all
this let me see
if I can get Camilla
could you answer that.
Senator Steinborn you are here okay can
see yet
thank you senator welcome to House
Appropriations good to
be with you all madam chair
I used to be on that committee once upon
a time and it's
a it's a great
committee now I'm on your counterpart
the Senate finance
I yes so we don't
this doesn't for
close it really
doesn't. Determine
who's going to be the responsible party
to clean up the sites Madam
chair representative what it
really is it's it's a coordinating
effort and
coordinating.
Programs to get our
arms around all of them to
read the part of language talks
about relations
Saval shin relationships with the
federal government with the
tribes with
responsible parties with other state
agencies to get our arms
around what the best approach is to
actually cleaning up each of
these sites and
actually giving us more leverage
frankly to to initiate
Superfund discussions
or other do you know
we legacy program there's a
deal we legacy program
that is responsible
for a site New Mexico or Google
so it's
just give us really more leverage
and more velocity and
suffers.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you senator for that answer
I'm I'm just a little bit
concerned because you know I have
a Superfund site in my
area eagle
Picher that's been there for
years and on the list
and to get cleaned up
and and so I'm I'm
I know that EMNRD is already
responsible for
you know.
Stimulating these clean ups
and so I'm I was just curious how
that was working and work
and you know what
what good is this going
to do us and
you know we could use it for a lot of
things and not just uranium
but I understand
and appreciate and am
concerned about the uranium
mines as well but when
we start being very
specific I
just worry that we're not gonna worry
about all the other things that need
to be cleaned up so thank you for
your answers I appreciate
it. Thank
you Representative Representative
Anderson.
Thank you madam chair
I think I've just got a
couple of.
Questions
and I appreciate the comment
that that the bill
doesn't appreciate
Herman
financial responsibility
or perhaps
shift that
responsibility
but I did have a couple questions
one is is the funding
consider recurring
or nonrecurring
question.
And madam chair right
now it's junior money
so it's not
recurring.
It is it
yes I'm sorry I
apologize representative Sarinana
actually most of it is
recurring it's it we
we have everything you see
and that bill is
recurring and then some
I would also point out someone asked
about EMNRD earlier maybe was
developed we also have
junior funding for EMNRD as
well so yeah there's
there's and then I want to thank your
committee because you put into the
budget actually
so money for cleanup
which is one time money
but so
there's more there's recurring and then
there's a little bit you money that was
nonrecurring
chair representative
thank you very much
to the Sanchez
either sponsor
really.
I would appreciate a comment
about the
concept that we might
be launching into a
dual
agency
arrangement on
the uranium mine
cleanup
is that a good idea or bad
idea.
Senator Steinborn one take that one
sure sure Representative
Madam chair representative
they're already working in a
dual arrangement on this
issue and
the the radioactive
hazardous materials committee we
we had a hearing in Gallup
early in the summer they both
presented so they're already
working on this together it's kind
of like what's happening
with climate where they
each have a piece of the
issue of a kind of a different areas
one of them deals more with
just brass
tacks mining the
environment apartments dealing with a lot of
public health issues
so it
some.
They're already sorted you'll health
thing and we're just
empowering both sides of
that thank
you one final
question relative to
the statistics that I
heard which
is 260
uranium mines in New
Mexico
and half of those
are not cleaned
up my
question is is there
any estimate
as to the.
Size
of the
130
not cleaned up
and of for
the 130
that are
binding.
Do they have any
responsibility on
cleanup 2 questions
please.
Senator Madam chair
representative madam
chair.
Not sure I heard that really understood
the last part of your last
question but
yes some
of the very
insights.
And one of them there's a site called
ambrosia lake for
example that's a
that's a big time
site is not cleaned up as I
understand it.
And then there's actually
probably like 1000
discrete sites we've
seen and some of
which within the same
technical.
Minesite
but.
So you have a very incised
and.
And as far as responsibility
I think by definition what we're
talking about is abandoned
uranium mines we're talking
about New Mexico has an incredible
number of sites with
there is no title to it
whatsoever and
the the the person that money if
the company is long since
gone and it's
just there and that's why this problem
has not moved
it is short of the super
fund on the sites
on the Navajo Nation
because there's no title to it
and that's where this effort is intended
to kind of move the ball
forward. Thank
you senator if I
could follow up real
quick that
suggest maybe that there is
a sort of a new term
that goes with orphan
wells and that is
for fun
blinds
when we talk about no
hi.
No title and and
remediate remedial
work to be
done
let's see hundred
30 not cleaned up yet
a whole question
on on our all of
these or any of the
when I hear the word ambrosia
lake I think now that's
that I bet that's on
native American lands
and and how does the
bill
encompass.
Sovereign nation
versus New
Mexico.
So.
Chair okay
so.
Madam chair representative
it it
recognize they are sovereign
nations and it directs
the NMED
to.
Initiate and
develop.
Coordination with our sovereign
nations on the cleanup
it doesn't pre ordained that
either
but.
But this has a
huge this bill has a huge
positive impact for
native
tribes and pueblos because
so many of these areas are on
tribal land.
So it'll be a very
important part of it
thank you senator of
representative for your
presentation this evening
on our
board.
A great deal about
Sierra.
Unfamiliar with Madam
chair that concludes my
question.
All right thank you I don't
seen any other committee
questions reminded committee
there's at least what
I state you 50000
in H. B. 2 and
540
muscle menace in junior
money. So
what is the pleasure of the committee
madam chair with the
past
second. We
have a promotion
Representative Trujillo proper
second Representative
Allison is there any
objection to that motion
can you hear and
that is our house
bill 164
as amended.
All right seeing
representatives
and senators thank you very
much we can
hear
you.
It no one can hear
me.
We.
I can hear
you.
Senator radio I think it's on here
and.
Is brilliant so I'm sorry were unable
to hear me that we have in the
past thank you so much
and thank you everyone for
testifying let's go back
to her house bill 79
now do we have
Representative
Eli or my
Estes.
Madam chair representative
EDOs out need
Tandy's I'm gonna try to
promote and that is a
ballots.
Thank
you.
Thank. Seeing
M. are we able to promote
him madam chair I'm
here all right
Representative I'm going I'm
going to do it I without my
video on because I'm on my
cell phone and I can
barely hear you so
I'll do it this way so you don't see might
here.
Thank you. You're
welcome would you
please update
us on house bill 79
so I I so are
the reason we relate and I apologize
we are both Representative
Maestas are working
committee she
was actually going to present this where he's
probably tell the committee as.
Despite the analysis we
do not think
there will be any financial
impact the budget until
2037.
This extends the statute
limitations that is
directly possible they
could pick up some new
cases but we don't think that's gonna
happen what it really
does just glancing sentences for
years from
1518 so we're talking
about.
Something that is well
there are down the road
will not affect this budget and
we were going to ask the speaker to
remove the referral
appropriations but we
decided it was
just easier.
To what to do it just
for.
All right thank you and it's
been our understanding that the crime
bills are coming to House Appropriations
just in general because there's
ultimately an impact
so and I
did not being interrupted you have something
else
Representative.
Representative.
You are muted out very
honest I'm speaking I'm sorry
I know I will stand for
questions.
All right thank you is there anyone in the
audience who has input on
house bill
79.
Thank you madam chair this is
JD Bullington speaking
on behalf of the greater Albuquerque
chamber of commerce that supports house
bill 79
with no other state in the nation having
statute of limitation
on second degree murder it's
time for New Mexico to do
away with there is
and raise the penalty for
this violent act
can be very difficult for
prosecutors to charge
defendants properly and bring
justice for victims
in Mexico cases where
in first degree murder
is a natural talents of
this bill helps address
that problem
and will ultimately mean that
more murderers are held to account
for their crimes they committed our
state and that's a good thing
the greater Albuquerque chamber of
commerce urges full
support for this legislation
we think the Sanchez thank
you. Thank you
Mr Billington anyone
else in the audience
on house bill
79.
To be a panelists so should
be talking next.
I missed the name I'm
sorry.
Krystal
Nash.
All right thank
you.
Yes we can thank you ms
Nash thank you
thank you for
just inspect COVID tonight
you have to excuse me I am actually
currently in a meeting right now
with other victims
of homicide
in our family members small
members obviously
so I don't have anything
officially.
We're in now but
I am equally
please.
I'm sorry I said just
briefly we give just one minute
here and
representative so I am
asking that you
take into consideration of passing this
law as.
New Mexicans deserve justice
and the criminals
are taking over our state
and making us unsafe
and.
0 to 15 years is just
not an option
we don't have
enough sentencing time
for convicted murderers
and it's not fair
the families don't get justice
the victims don't get justice
our community doesn't get
justice thank you for
listening to me.
Thank you Mr very
much anyone
else on the house bill 79
in the
audience.
All right then we will go to committee
and we'll start with Representative
Dixon.
Thank you madam chair I actually do not
have a question I wanted
to make motion when
the time was
appropriate all right
let's hold that for one moment
Representative
Anderson.
Thank you madam chair
are you
Representative Eli
you can hear me
my question is I'm a little
confused we are
this bill is
increasing
murder time and sentencing
for second degree murder
in New Mexico from
what to
what.
The light your
muted.
No I'm there madam
chair so
so it increases it from
15 to 18
years that's one
thing that the bill does
the other it removes
the statue limitations
on second degree murder so that's
why it's theoretically
possible that it
could affect the budget we don't
think that's likely benefit here picks
up a cold case it
could happen but
the staff but the
sentencing itself goes from
15 to
18.
Thank you representative madam
chair of
I hope it does
affect budget in
the out years
because
impact.
And so my question
is answered and I
look
forward.
Thank
you.
Somebody in a very
noisy
setting.
Representative.
I will go to Representative Dixon
for the motion.
Thank you madam chair I would know that you
passed
second.
And.
Representative second
by Representative Armstrong we have a
proper motion and second is
there any objection to that
motion.
All right saying Representative
Ely and Representative I just
have a different set of House
Appropriations thank
you.
All right bill my list
shows that we wrapped up everything
if I missed anything.
Sure no we're done.
All right thank you all
committee members for hanging with us
all afternoon and evening
and for audience thank you for
joining us House Appropriations
and with that we will stand
adjourned thank you.
Good job committee.
Yes good job.
Good job madam chair.
