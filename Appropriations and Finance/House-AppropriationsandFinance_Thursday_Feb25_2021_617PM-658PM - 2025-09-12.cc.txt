Representative Anderson is here
I got to rest it everybody plays
Representative small so I can
roll through this okay tonight
we have
Several bills but many of them
are scheduled to be tabled at
the request of the sponsor.
And what I wonder reminded
committee of especially those
that are new to HSA is that we
don't get into the policy
discussion on these bills we
talk about the money pace we
talk about how much is it going
to cost is it in the budget you
know those kind of things
because we are the last stop for
these bills before they go to
the floor.
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to ask we're gonna start
by all ask our vice chairman.
To make the motion or for
tabling and we'll do it all in
one motion for those bills that
we have been asked by the
sponsors to table if you would
please thank you madam chair as
asked by the Sanchez I would
move to table house bill fifty
three house bill seventy two
house bill seventy seven and
house bill eighty five.
Okay at the request of the
Sanchez the house bill fifty
three house bill seventy two
house bill seventy seven and
house bill eighty five is there
a second to that motion second.
The second from Representative
Anderson is there any opposition
to that motion.
I see no opposition to the
motion is passed we just killed
half of our agenda tonight so
let's go back and look at some
of the others that we go through
very quickly
What about house bill two thirty
eight representative Armstrong
and small is that to be
rescheduled yes madam chair.
Yes madam chair I have a
committee substitute for that
bill and so in less you want me
to do the committee supposed to
do right now it does the same
thing I don't like if you're not
going to talk about policy just
money I can do that or whatever
you prefer madam chair okay it's
my understanding it was supposed
to be rolled over so I would
prefer to do that all right I
need a motion from
Representative Armstrong that
we're just going to roll it over
yes ma'am we need to roll house
bill two thirty eight okay.
Okay we don't have to vote on
that since she's the sponsor and
small as the sponsor so that one
is better rolled over.
Okay we are now going to go back
is the speaker in the in this
group Representative small.
House bill six I don't see them
will make sure he's getting
right over.
This is in my group.
On the list manager okay there's
another one that we can do it
can be easy and just a sample
vote up or down and that's house
bill fourteen as amended.
This is the grants
administration act
Representative Dixon now I do
know that the funding for this
is in the supplemental.
so just make a couple comments
on this bill and then we'll take
a take a vote on it go ahead
Representative Dixon.
Thank you madam chair do I need
to introduced the amendment.
You have an amendment a district
the appropriation okay go ahead
Madam chair I'd like to move
amendment one HFC amendment one
to house bill fourteen as
amended second.
We have a motion and a second
and the I don't have that
amendment in front of me I'm
sure it's in that
So yes I do.
Yes bill I have it in front of
me and it's all it's all here
basically what this ammendment
does go ahead Representative and
tell us the amendment strips the
appropriations and it also makes
a few us or technical changes at
the request of state agencies to
clarify that if they heard of an
established grant writing
process and agent you know do
they do that within their own
agency that they are not
required to use the services of
the grants administration at
that this is a supplemental
program for our state agencies.
Okay and what is that number on
this ammendment.
Two two zero one nine one.
so everybody should have that
the proposed amendment basically
what it does distract the
appropriation.
And as the representative said.
Is a little technical clean up
here I don't want to do this
side by side but I want to ask
if there's any the numbers that
have any opposition to this
amendment.
Okay I'll take the role please.
Just move the amendment and
we're taking action on the
amendment okay
Representative Allison.
Yes Representative Anderson yes.
Representative Armstrong.
Representative Brown.
Thank you know for
reason that it would be a part
of it would violate the anti
donation clause muscle said.

I against and thirteen for.
Okay
With that.
With that
Resolved it looks like the
amendment has been adopted back
on the bill.
My hope is not to get into lots
of detail on the scale so just
quickly Representative Dixon
what is this bill do.
Thank you madam chair the
purpose of house bill fourteen
as twice amended is to increase
revenue and investments in New
Mexico by leveraging federal
funds and philanthropic dollars
to build a better state.
Thank you.
Okay.
Let's go to questions or any
questions from the committee.
I don't see any Representative
small is helping me
Representative Brown.
Your
madam chair and and
Representative thank you just
very quickly I do hope the
amendment would have X. taken
out reference to nonprofit
organizations
there there be a violation of
the state constitution to keep
them in the bill and the maybe
we can visit
Later on about how to fix the
bill it's okay to do things for
the benefit of state and local
governments but to
put
the the benefit of the bill
towards non profits I believe
clearly donate violates the anti
donation clause thank you.
Okay I have a I have a question
on that also Representative
Dixon does this does this apply
to non profits.
Thank you madam chair the
services provided by the grants
administration in terms of
training networking and
compiling information as well as
supporting efforts in grant
writing are available to state
agencies tribal entities local
municipalities cogs and non
profits the proposed matching
grant fund would not.
So the proposed matching grant
fund would not go toward the
nonprofits correct only the
state entities subdivisions
and I believe tribal
governments.
Okay well I was not completely
clear about the nonprofit piece
I'm not going to hold this bill
up but I'd rather talk to you
before goals on the floor
because we may need to do
something about that on the
floor with non profits
Representative Anderson.
You have a question Sir.
Matt madam chair my question was
answered thank you.
Okay all right any other
questions.

it off.
Mr chair members of the
committee I am here for our bill
house bill six this is similar
to the impact aid legislation we
passed to the Senate last year
but it is this time in LFC
endorsed bill and the funding
that goes along with it used in
our house bill's.
Three that we passed over to the
Senate yesterday the real meat
of the bill is on page nine
winds fifteen to twenty two
details how.
The districts who are receiving
the additional SCG distributions
because under this bill the
state will no longer take credit
I
asking for
hours is is that the revenues
are to be spent for purposes as
it says beginning on page nine
twenty purposes related to the
Indian Education Act your public
school capital outlay act the
public school capital
improvement act the public
school buildings Act and the
community schools act in
addition to eliminating the
credit that the state takes for
impact aid it also eliminates
credit I just take it for the
forest reserve hi in the other
credits that the state takes for
similar type funds was not
limited just to.
Impact David also includes for
CENIC comes to mind is forced
reserve because there's been
some of your frequent our
question about that.
Are with them and I'm sure I'm
happy to answer any questions.
Thank you Mr speaker and we'll
go to Representative small where
is this in the budget

Madam chair I would move the

six two one nine six nine six
point two.
So madam chair right we have a
motion to just have a second to
move the amendment
thank you Representative Lara
the second amendment go ahead
talk about this place.
And madam chair
The amendment basically are
strikes.
General in in the sense of
general fund and inserts.
The
Consumer settlement fund so
instead of general fund we're
looking at consumer settlement
fund.
And we're also tweaking the.
Have fiscal years to allow the
study to take up the last half
of twenty twenty one in the
first half of twenty twenty two
to be able to complete this.
Lastly you madam chair with.
The an emergency clause.
Four we have.
To this I want to know is there
somebody from the AG's office.
Yes madam chair this is a Matt
Baca at I don't seem to have the
function to turn my camera on
but I am I am here.
Okay Mister Barker do you agree
with this funding coming out of.
The Fund identified out of the
AG's budget.
Madam chair I don't believe that
the request was in our budget
proper but with respect to the
funds coming out of the consumer
settlement fund the Attorney
General is in in support of
that.
Okay.
Okay so for the benefit of the
committee.
This is this is an
appropriations bill that comes
out of an interim committee you
know what you'll see for the
Legislative Health and Human
Services Committee.
This so Sanchez asking is that
we no longer look at it is
coming from the general fund to
support this this activity would
come from the consumer
settlement funds within the AG's
Department and Mr Baako what's
the balance on that currently
madam chair I looked at it it
with the appropriations in the
current form of HB to I believe
it would drop down to close to
about a million I think the
balance right now is about
thirty
that's just the numbers I saw
from our internal reports out of
off of each B. two so that might
not be a thousand percent
accurate but I believe that to
be the case okay does somebody
have their volume their body and
three they can look that up real
quick for me let's see what the
balances under the consumer
settlement fund.
We're looking that up we'll go
back to the the sponsor.
Him talk a fees like to ask is
Is experts just just say very
brief word amendment.
on the amendment madam chair
I don't think my witnesses have
anything to act on MLK okay.
Jobs in the minutes.
Okay we have a motion for
adoption of the amendment and I
need a second.
In terms of a secular for
Representative Herrera but I
want to note that balances so
somebody needs to tell me that.
Madam chair.
As of November twenty twenty in
the office of the Attorney
General and the settlement fund
believe the balance in November
twenty twenty is twenty two
million five hundred ninety
three thousand seven hundred
ninety two.
Okay thank you very much we do
have a motion and a second for
the adoption of that amendment
is there any opposition to that.
I don't see anybody in
opposition so it has been
adopted and back on the bill.
Representative.
Thank you madam chair I do agree
for a presentation and I do want
to say that but I am grateful to
the Attorney General basically
the Attorney General is that is
utilizing.
Opioid abatement monies that are
coming in from settlements that
are AG has filed against the
pharmaceuticals
regarding the opioid crisis
opioid overdoses and opioid over
prescription madam chair and the
Attorney General is very
confident that the this project
this study will not only be
funded this year but the AG has
committed funding the unfolding
of the program statewide once
the study is completed in
November madam chair and this
program is a state of the art
program it basically deals with
opioid addiction and opioid
treatment and it's it's it'll be
the first of its kind in the
United States it's being done in
practice in seven countries or
more and basically madam chair
the study of basically the the
appropriations for under fifty
thousand dollars to do a
demonstration project to assess
the feasibility and accept SFX
susceptibility of an injectable
opioid treatment program at the
university New Mexico actually
University Medical is on board
and their exports are nationally
renowned in terms of opioid
treatment and opioid addiction
madam chair and
in essence this program will
provide a clinical setting.
With physical and with license
physicians and nurses that'll
basically up from a from a
population of individuals that
have not taken to a different
modes of of opioid addiction
methadone soapbox and Senator.
And the process is that they'll
be involved in an injectable
opioid treatment program and
check the by the license Dr and
while they're in the setting the
UNM campus.
They will also partake.
In the wraparound services
available for opioid addiction
methadone use madam chair so
though we address the issues of
housing issues of social
services in terms of signing up
these individuals or Medicaid
the food stamp program housing
will be available to them and
then most important and chairs
that they remove these
individuals from street life and
it also reduces crime criminal
activity and that basically
we're taking out the main
function of an opioid attic
which is partially in the street
get money to get a fix for that
day.
And madam chair that'll probably
be eliminated and
also madam chair it the deals
with the public safety crisis in
terms of.
Disposing of needles in our
public parks are public
priorities and even in our
public businesses what we see
syringe after syringe just being
disposed by many of these are
opioid addicts madam chair and
also madam chair the strands of
the Legisla- of legislation once
the program is on full that is
that it's strengthen social
relations within the family and
the community and how is that
madam chair because of this the
the type of structure that this
program will implement it
basically allows these opioid.
The substance users to our seats
work and to hold down a job to
go back to school to our to read
to read bond with the family and
even the possibility of winning
back their kids from foster care
that CYFD took from the manager
and
so with that I'd like to kind of
briefly yield to my experts
Dr Kimberly page for a brief
presentation in terms are over
her role in this whole process
with the study and then
unfolding the program manager
okay just a couple minutes.
Yeah they're going to do just
about a minute okay go ahead go
ahead.
Thank you madam chair and
committee for having us we are
really excited about the
opportunity to look for
successful ways to treat and
improve the lives of people who
have not found success with
methadone suboxone or other
treatments and implement new
effective in the method of drug
substitution therapies and our
legislative evaluation and of
how this could be expanded in
New Mexico to other communities
so it's a demonstration project
that we hope will inform future
expansion.
And the other gentleman did you
want to make a comment to quick
comment Sir.
Thank you once the hope I hear
chief of addiction psychiatry at
the university of New Mexico and
thank you madam chair members of
the committee really grateful to
be here I think you Mexico and
I've been law breaking here in
this field for the past twelve
years at at the university of
New Mexico and we've done a
great job through education to
expanding treatment through
distributing naloxone in terms
of starting to bring down our
range of the overdose and then
the pandemic and fentanyl around
the same time illicit fentanyl
started coming in one
fortunately what we've seen
around the country in New Mexico
over the last year is right self
overdose mortality school up
precipitous right and we have
very effective treatments that
we're providing and expanding
throughout the state and
supporting agencies to do it but
there is that small group of
people probably the most
vulnerable group of people were
not being helped by these
medications they're on these
medications they're continuing
to use illicit opioids dying as
a result and having this lead
out effect on to their
communities right and that's the
group they're trying to target
because we know that injectable
hydromorphone treatment just has
been studying other countries
tends to reduce those title
costs reduces crime improves
physical psychological health of
the individual social
functioning and you know it
seems to be more effective than
our existing treatment so that's
what we hope to study and
hopefully make available you
know to to our communities thank
you.
Introduce myself I'm a professor
of epidemiology and
biostatistics and that with Dr
but as a provider in the US the
researcher it's a great team.
Okay we do have a couple
questions from the members and
I'm going to go first
Representative Sweetser and then
Representative Herrera and then
the motion for Representative
Crowder so go ahead
Representative.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you representative Garcia good
to see you in a JFC my question
is the bill as originally
written was a recurring expense
to the general fund so now it
will be a recurring expense to
the consumer settlement fund and
my correct madam chair.
Madam chair we're hoping that
that'll be the case
you know once the study is
conducted and finished and
that'll take us into November
and
And the continuation the
commitment of the AG to fund the
unfolding of the program so
we're hoping that the the the
the funding for the program
automatic end of that will be
recurring and it'll all be
coming from the settlement fund
from the consumer settlement
fund which will be growing
because of the tens of millions
of dollars of settlement monies
that'll be coming into our state
because of the intervention of
the AG against these
pharmaceuticals in terms of
their over prescription of
opioids thank oxy cotton like
Fenton all etcetera etcetera
thank.
Thank you representative Garcia
I just was basically asking
madam chair if if that was
appropriate for us to do a
recurring expense in the
consumer settlement fund and
this bill what will happen
Representative Sweetser
representative Garcia is that
DFA will book this is the
recurring or nonrecurring
obviously it's for study I think
what will happen is we'll be put
first ended nonrecurring and if
we don't see it in your budget
next year Matt of.
You know you're you're the one
that would have to come back and
ask for it comes through the
agency itself and I imagine you
would make that decision after
the document is complete in the
program the research is done.
All right.
That was.
Representative Herrera.
Thank you madam chair I I'm just
very curious I couldn't have
done this program for a hundred
fifty thousand so this is paying
for that this study in this and
what was the total cost of the
program and what is the total
cost for client.
Madam chair representative
that's the purpose of the study
to make that determination and
that the status the protocols
and that we know that the study
will basically fund the person
it'll look at site renovation
it'll look at that person for
implementation and also look at
a valuation so all those factors
will be tied into the the
completion of the study.
Thank you madam chair and
representative as you know this
is a huge huge issue in my
district so I'll be waiting for
the results thank you madam
chair representative heroin.
The top go opioid we know what
that's done to more New Mexico
