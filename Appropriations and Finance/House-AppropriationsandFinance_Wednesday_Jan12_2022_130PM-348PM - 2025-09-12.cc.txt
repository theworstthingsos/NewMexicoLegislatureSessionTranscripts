Madam chair.
Having a panic
attack.
And that's not a pretty

we keep getting kicked out
we don't know exactly
why we're working on
it okay thanks
well we're finally
on so thank
you all for being patient
it's good to see all these familiar
faces
and.
How are you.
You have a mustache
very good thank
you yes I
do.
The.
Thank you ladies and
gentlemen we have a change
in our agenda
Senator folks have to
have requested to
be
placed down lower on
the list so let me give you the
order of the presenters
okay
lines I'm
sorry program
number 630
to workers comp
will be
first.
Program 780
correct
crime.
Madam chair your
muted.
Sorry I was testing all of
you.
Okay let's start again
630 to workers
comp is number 1.
78 he is crime
victims unit.
516
Department game and
fish.
522 youth
conservation.
609 Indian
Affairs.
That should be all over my
correct.
Yes
okay.
Okay let's go
ahead and get started
with with the very first
1 which is so
630 to workers
comp. And
we have
as
presenters.
Mr chair and
Mr ms Miller.
Mr
Miller.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the W. as
you said my name is Eric
Shinya the LFC
analyst.
For the workers compensation
administration
we've also got
Simon Miller he's the executive
analyst.
And
Robert descent I think I think
it's in your name correct
Robert.
From the.
Workers compensation
administration.
I'll go ahead and start you'll
find LFC
a budget recommendation
on in volume
2 on page
290.
So you can reference that
needed.
Starting off LFC
recommended a total
2.9 percent
increase in revenue
from the workers compensation
administration fund
and the uninsured employers
fund.
The executive recommended of
2.one percent decrease
in revenue from the same to
funds.
The executive recommendation would
increase personnel costs
spending by 6.3
percent and other category
spending 14.7
percent.
LFC recommendation
would increase personal cost
spending 3.3 percent
and other categories spending
7.6
percent.
The LFC recommendation
continues that the
transfer of 1000000 for the
workers compensation administration
fund the department
of workforce
solutions.
The executive wed
and the
transfer.
I just wanted to remind the
committee at this point of the
transfer that goes
to workforce
solutions on the other
end
if if the
executive
recommendation were
taken that would
increase
our general fund
spending on the workforce
solutions department
side by $0
so we use this $0
transfer from workers
comp over to
workforce solutions
to basically
keep our general
fund spending
down by
$9.
Under language LFC
recommendation included language
to transfer 1000000 for the
workers comp industry should
fund the department
of workforce
solutions.
And then lastly where there were performance
measures at target differences the
analyst reach consensus
as.
With that I'll pass it over
to a Simon for
any further
comments.
Thank.
You're given just a second he
was just logging in since
the order changed I think he
wasn't he
wasn't originally for south
areas he's just hop in and
now my deepest
apologies my
apologies for not
letting you know sooner
apologies I I clicked on the
link for tomorrow so I was just sitting there
waiting but a sorry about
that good afternoon madam
chair members of the committee
I'm sure the Eric probably
covered most of the differences
here really the
the major difference between the 2
recommendations is that
the LFC recommendation
include the transfer of
1000000 to the department of
workforce solutions
you can see that 1000000 on your
different sheet in the other
financing uses
category
this transfer funding from
WCA to
supplement the budget of the department
of workforce solutions
began about a decade
ago as a general
fund cost savings
measure
members of this committee have
previously expressed concern about
this transfer since
it falls outside of the
scope of the
it statutory scope
of the WCA Fund
so the executive recommendation
replaces this transfer
with general fund
in the department of workforce
solutions budget
and with that I will turn it
over to the agency thank
you.
Mr is it D.
J.. I
don't care or you can call me
at 8 Hey you I
will definitely
answer.
This go ahead and get started
they won't say Hey you.
Thank you madam chair and thank you for
putting us first.
My name is Robert to
set I was appointed the director
of the workers compensation
on December 6
so last month this is my
6 week
I might look familiar to some of
you for 6 years as the
deputy superintendent of
insurance.
Across the street
and with me I have leave
Martinez who's been with the
agency since
1995 she's the number
2 here in my
CFO for any
financial questions Michelle
green who's been here
roughly 2 years
up real quick I want to
thank you for allowing me to do this by
zoom we've had an uptick
in cases here in I've been
directly exposed
by 2 employees
so I'm glad that
we can do this here
does everyone have the presentation
that we email if not
we can put
it up there we
go it I know you're
very busy so I made sure
we have no more than 8
slots.
So the second
slide.
So workers
comp we have 6 field
offices around the
state so on this slide
for free
for the members if you ever
have any work comp questions
here's a list of phone numbers
and locations you
can always reach out to
me next
slide.
Our mission for film
that I put some
highlights but I want
to highlight to
education.
In 2020
2000 500
86 complaints were filed
in 2000 500 52
were closed for
98.7 clearance
right when I
enter worker comes to
the Department here
this entry didn't happen a week
ago it's usually
a month sometimes up to
a year
so.
We have a good process of
when they get here
to hopefully get it done
quickly and
efficiently and
the other one highlight is our
involvement in all of
our office we have a budget
and that respond
to they got about
8353
contact that's
important because
to ensure
workers that's
the first person that you're calling the
department insurance they're
not given legal by what they're
telling you this is where
you look to get your rights this
is the help
them along in the process
so we have a few others I'm
not going to highlight but those
2 I wanted to highlight
specifically we
next slide please.
As a talked about our budget
request one of the
reasons we ask for an increase in
the 200 is to replace
staffing levels to pre
hiring freeze
levels to the valuation
just salaries to
correctly.
Make our people
competitive
if we ask for increase
for the uninsured
employers fund we
can't claims we
don't know if
forget 100 claims a year
or 2 claims here
but with the closing of
businesses we
feel that there are going to be more
claims under
this.
Next slide
please.
You see operates solely on
revenue generated
quarterly fire
assessment paid by employers
and employees
we are not at the general fund
HSD and
the slide that you have
beside you shows you how
much money that we received
and revenue.
What we're not appropriated
or what we don't spend it
goes into the reserve fund
for the workers cop for the
U. yes it does not revert
to the general fund
budget. Next
slide.
So my last
general slide is where
we are currently for staffing
levels as everyone but
once the us this question
we are we have
122
FTEs currently
we have 22 vacancies
of those 22
vacancies
13 of those our
interviews have been held in
candidates identified
offers pending
there were actually recruiting
for example we will be
at the rapid higher Friday
so are.
Well the 10 remaining
vacancies 3 year
over
year once again the
exposition.
One we are requesting
down because we don't
longer need a higher position
A. I. T. the third
one is a field
manager for
Hobbs.
When the position came they get
we had a hiring freeze
the COVID if we were able
to interview in
person but we are created
that position
again and all the 7
left vacancies
they're all under listening
here and we've taken
direction
1 of them we are going to
request for
compliance officer in our Vegas
office we currently have
to F. 252
FTE ease up there 1 is
fill 1 is not
we continue to look
what we need internally
to re class those vacant
positions.
And since I've been here we have
request one vacant position
to another HR position that
was vitally needed
for the metal work that we do
here in my last
slide madam chair.
Is once again we are funded
through we're not general
fund we are funded through
a quarterly assessment
of workers employers taking
no money.
Despite the constraints working
through a pandemic W. C.
sessions resulting nearly
1200 individuals filed
more than 42000
legal pleadings wrote
1400 recommended
resolutions has a
98.7
education class right
we're seeking a 5 percent increase
in 200 person
category in a decrease
in our 300 we look
at our budget just
say we can increase increase
we decide what we
truly need so I
stand ready the answer
hopefully most of your questions
thank you madam chair thank you
committee
members.
Thank you very much I
appreciated in before we
started I neglected to
introduce the
this
committees the
vice chair and
that is Meredith Representative
Meredith Dixon
what she is doing is taking
copious notes
and then she will
also
offer the
the REC the committee's
recommendation and
take of
the 4
votes so I just
want to make sure that everyone was
clear on that so
now to questions
and
isn't it does anyone
have any questions
of this
presenter.
No one has any
questions.
Okay go ahead agency
I don't see your face to your
name. Where
are you this is Jack
Chatfield there you
are got a little LFC
and.
Well hello now I
see it and I do see
Representative Brown as well
okay go ahead
Representative Chatfield
so madam chair.
I know this is you was mentioned
as being the tried and true question
so I just thought I'd ask it
again I think I may have
asked it last year
but just
remind me.
Why.
We move $1000000
out of this
fund over
into the department of workforce
solutions instead
of changing
our rules changing
our laws
doing something or this budget
remains on its
own and the money goes
back to the general fund.
And the workforce
solutions
applies for
that money in their budget
like everyone
else.
Okay.
Madam chair
representative.
The main reason for why we transferred
over is it's it's $1000000
in savings to the general
fund
it's.
Once we transfer it over
it's offsetting spending on
the on the
workforce solutions
department side
so if you were to take a look at their
budget
the executive budget
recommends
increasing general
fund by 1000000
on their
side.
And on this
so the transfer goes over
there if
there are recommendation was
adopted it would result
in a 1000000
increase in
spending from the general
fund.
The funds over here from
workers comp administration
as the director
said do not
revert to the general
fund.
And so there's no on on this
side there's no general fund
impact but if
we.
Don't do that transfer
then there will be a general fund
impact.
So madam chair.
Yes I thank you
Mr shin a for that
for that answer it
just seems to me like we're
circumventing the process
thank
you.
Thank you very much
Representative
Brown.
Around.

Brian Chavez who is

analyst for this
agency and Frank
Zubia the executive
director he
may also be joined by some other members
of his staff who he
will introduce when he makes
comments.
Before we get started I do want
to direct your in
the attention
to.
Our volume 2
pages 360 to
364
which provides detail on the
LFC budget recommendation
and give some policy
background as
well.
Well no
wonder this on is
here somewhere.
Our volume
one.
That
is open during the interim making
an excuse
me someone
please New Mexico
are. Your
staff.
Chatfield
mute.
Whomever is speaking
please
with all due respect knocked
us and
let miss Ruben
speak.
All right thank you madam
chair right
but.
Thank thank you madam
chair
okay so as a
student he just
36364
volume to have more information
on the LFC
recommendation
wanted to add that I I
feel to know this on the sheep but are
volume 1 this year actually includes
a section on victim
and community needs
that starts on page
62
and I encourage you all
to take a look at it
as you are able
because it does
discuss the broader public
safety impact
of these victims
services that
CVR C. funds and that I
think take up will take a
lot of our discussion with
regard to this agency this
afternoon.
I'm starting here with
this the HSD
summary different sheets on
pages page one and
there's also a narrative on
the next page of your
packets.
This year the agency actually
reallocated its budget next
year along its programs that better
aligns with the purpose
purpose but if we're
looking at the agency
level or at the program
level
summaries it does
look like there these really substantial
differences compared with the operating
budget but it's really just
transfers between the
programs.
Recommendations to support these
transfers so they're not impacting
the differences but in
the interest of sort of understanding the
changes proposed by the
recommendations
I'm going to
focus my presentation on
the HSD summary
the differences are pretty
straightforward I think they can all
be addressed are reflected on
the summary level
but we do have some more details
on the program little different sheets
and of course our happy to answer
any questions about
Wells.
I'm to the presentation
there really for
significant differences between
the 2 recommendations
the first is that the executive
provides $5000000
to expand sexual assault
services while
LESC provides
2.$3000000 for this
purpose that's a
2.$7000000
difference you'll see
that reflect. In
the contractual services
line.
Additionally the executives
were recommended expansion for the
services that's entirely
from the general fund
where's the legislative recommendation
includes 1000000 from the general
fund and
1.$3000000
from the early childhood education
and care fund which is contingent
on legislation that expands
the allowable uses
on you'll see that
reflected here
in the US
revenues for general
fund transfers.
And
for.
Of the other and for other
revenants.
Third major differences of the
executive provides
161.$6000
more per person than legislative
recommendation and this
fully funds the
projected cost for all the agency's
mission this is reflected
here on the personal services
employee benefits.
And fourth finally
executive provides $100000
expansion for services
for victims of human trafficking
which is not including the legislative
recommendation and you'll
see that reflected here
in the other
line.
Additionally the legislative
recommendation does include language
that specifies the funds
appropriated from the crime
victims reparation fund for
direct payments
can only be used for that
purpose this
aligns with the statutorily
allowable uses of the
fund and I
would suggest that the
committee if even if they
take the executive
recommendation
consider maintaining this
language the amount included
in language would not change between
either recommendation.
Legislative recommendation also
does include contingency language
for that 1.$3000000
from the early childhood education
trust fund that I mentioned
earlier.
We have come to consensus on
performance measures and targets
you'll see you'll reflected on pages
7 and 8 of those
packets.
And just
a brief note
before
we did we discuss it with the
agency but since
submitting its budget request
the agency has learned
that it's going to be receiving reduced
federal victims of crime are both
got funding
expected about
22 percent
it's about 2.8000000
and that would affect its funding
of directed to services
that federal revenues
line
here.
Where we are but the
LFC and
exec are
projecting about $15000000
in revenues the agency
now thinks that's going to be closer
to 12.$2000000
of federal
revenue.
I believe that may have been brought to
the members attention and may have been
brought to your attention that the
executive recommendation would make
up most of that difference.
I just want to note that the
funds were requested and
recommended the
additional 2.$7000000
in services were
requested and recommended for
sexual assault service funding
but this is okay how
could end up impacting all
kinds of direct and services
not just sexual assault
services so
again if the committee chooses
to accept the executive recommendation
I would suggest that it provide
direction as to whether
those additional funds should be
restricted to sexual assault
services or if the
agency can use the funds
to make up
losses in revenue for other
services as well.
That concludes my presentation
Brian do you have any additional
comments.
A good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee
on really not much to add
Allen hit on everything
that needed to be touched on
on just executive recommendation
just we recommend
it on the agency's
request.
Nothing more to add
and can send it over to Frank for
some comments.
Thank you
Mr.
Yes good afternoon madam
chair it is it over is
it okay if I share my screen
madam chair members of.
Yes it
is.
Okay.
Madam chair members of the
committee
thank you I want to thank you for the
opportunity to present our agency
budget today and I
want to thank Brian Chavez
are DFA analyst in Allen
Rabin are LFC analyst
for the recommendations I also
want to introduce
and there in the audience
today our
state agency CFO Cindy
mark and are requests
bureau chief Merial
Garcia our compensation
bureau chief voices
Valdez and our
special guest is also in the audience
Alexandria Taylor deputy
director of the New Mexico
coalition sexual
assault programs
prepared a brief power point
that will demonstrate our budget
request on New
Mexico creating victims
celebrated its fortieth
year of assisting victims of violent
crime with expenses incurred as a
result of their
victimization.
In addition of
providing financial assistance
we also administer federal
and state funding to
organizations that provide
direct victim services
senior C. currently funds
45
projects these
projects consists of rape
crisis centers
fain's domestic
violence shelters child
advocacy centers causes
law enforcement victim
advocates district
attorney victim advocates
prosecutors and
culturally specific agencies
that provide services to victims
of crime on
page 2.
XP
is.
On page
2
of the presentation.
This provides the difference
between the 2 programs
madam chair members of the committee
on on the on the
left side the orange
column it provides in
depth and provides you
the types of expenses
that New Mexico claimed
victims reimburses for
victims on
the right side which is the
blue side of
your of the
power plant before you
these are grants department
and that provides the
types of funding our agency
administers.
Next.
Page of our presentation
provides the drugs.
And of the expenses are
compensation department is
currently paid in currently has
paid historically our
agency the largest
expense was always
medical
except for the last 5
years our agency's
largest expenses now been
funeral and burial
costs
we've paid
4.$676000
on funeral since
2015 for
victims in our
state which
is unheard of when we compare
that to our
counterparts nationwide
senior C. is able to
decide these
are within 70 2:00 hours
80 percent of our homicide
cases because of our
collaboration with our law
enforcement agencies
statewide
one victim actually wrote a thank
you note stating
that after my daughter was
killed her husband
had left the 2 children
and she didn't know how to bury
her daughter she
was on a fixed income
and but because of our help
she was able to bury
her daughter with
dignity and she wanted to take
our organization for that for
our assistance
on page 4
madam chair members of the
committee.
This illustrates the
federal and state funding
for the fiscal year of the current
fiscal year which total over
$19000000 for
organization
state appropriation was
4.7
4000000
750 1000
which is under contractual
or budget these
funds support direct
victim service providers both
governmental and non profits
throughout the
state.
I'm gonna last so it might
my second to
last. The
slide
is on page
5 this illustrates
the appropriation of
federal voca funds
which are LFC
analysts are being
mentioned on
to our state I I
want you all to kind of pay
close attention not
necessarily to the compensation
which is not necessarily going to be
affected by the
decreased but I do
want to let you all know that
the crime victims fund which was
established back in
1984
senator significant
funding source for victims services
throughout the country not just
our state each year
millions of dollars are deposited
into this fund from criminal
fines forfeited bail
bonds penalty fees
special assessments collected
by the U. S. attorney.
US court to bureau of
prisons these
dollars come from offenders
convicted of federal crimes and
not taxpayers
ought not taxpayer money
on this page regarding victim
compensation
prior to July 22
of 2021 we
received $0.60
from our from the federal
government for every state dollar
that we expended
after July 22
of 2021
due to the Boca fix we
received no
$0.75
for every state dollar spent
on victim compensation for
victims of crime I
want you to all to to please
committee members to play
pay really close attention to
the vocal assistance graph which
is in blue
these funds are for real
requests and
there is a based appropriation
plus population
for years
CBRC
received a little over
$3000000
annually.
In 2015
there was a fusion of federal
funds to the vocal administering
agencies which is what we
are as
reflected in the drugs received
the largest doctor in
FY 2018
as a result.
It appears the doubled its
funding to existing
projects in new
innovative projects
that work directly with crime
victims many
programs were able to
expand their agency
operations and services
they purchased necessary
technology and worked
on developing trauma informed
practices
seniors to utilized in
stabilized all of these
programs for for 4
years strategically
even if this federal
fiscal year that started October
1 of 2021
no agency budget
was
cut.
That is not gonna be the case for FY
23 which is going to begin
October 1 of 2022
with a couple of months
we've been working with all of our
service provider organizations
to prepare them for this reduction
in funding.
Even with the vocal fix we can't
anticipate how much our state
will receive annually
from the votes of the
from the crime victim
I. Give your
C. anticipate that we will have to
cut projects by about
22 percent
which is
$2838000
starting October 1
this leads me to my next
slide.
Here.
We request
your C.
requests.
$60000 for
new F. T.
$1500
for operations
314000
in vacancy savings
$100000 for
human trafficking funding
and 5000000 for sexual
assault services
once again I want to thank
DFA and LESC for the
recommendation in their support
we're asking this committee
support the executive
recommendation CBS
is requesting
376
for agency operations
which is only
5.6 percent
of our general fund
appropriation the
5100000
will go directly
to serving victims of
sexual violence and human
trafficking in our state
due to the reduction in federal
funding this is a
public safety issue
that needs to be
addressed.
Critical that we protect
the well being of all of our
citizens.
Unities in our
organizations.
Take a moment to explain the
sexual assault request
first the 2000000 would be
for sexual assault programs to
increase both provider
capacity provider
rate increases and
sustainable workforce
and address the gaps across
the state and focus on
rural and
underserved communities
in our state.
1000000 would address the
mental health programs
in our right crisis centers
many of our survey
and again there's
or 12.
And UNM with trying to get
into a
preparation.
Maybe speaking
so I just went down there
because.
The stock was got frustrated
and I thought I would just go see
it and
thank you and
you're one of the benefits
of Canadian right now
one thank
you.
Madam chair and
everybody's managed at this
point so
the presenter needs to speak
she needs on
mute.
Madam chair members the
committee I apologize
I'm madam chair
1000000 would address
sexual assault mental health
programs and
services in for a rape crisis
center many of our
victims are experiencing
12 months or more
and wait this and
in some of our communities for
counseling services and
we know that if survivors
do not obtain services
soon after the incident they
are less likely to seek
services later on
affecting their emotional and
physical well being
1.3000000 would
sustain and
enhance our satellite
children advocacy centers in
a rural parts of our state
500000
would be for operations of
the New Mexico state wide
sexual assault hotline
in 200000 would
provide for indigenous
research and coordination of our
tribal service
again I want to thank
you for the opportunity
to present today our budget
and I were I am happy to
answer any questions from the
committee.
Madam chair you're on
mute.
I do that all the
time
I think I had
Representative
Brown follow by
Representative
Dixon.
And.
I don't see any other hands just
yet but I'll keep an eye out
go ahead Representative
Brown. Thank
you very much better
chair.
This question is
for I guess
anybody who wants to
address it I
noticed
what are difference worksheet we have
a note about the
language
the legislative
recommendation includes
language specifying that the funds
appropriated from the
crime victims reparations fund
for directed to payments
that means care and support may
be used only for
that purpose and so
the LFC is recommending
that language the executive
has not.
Another bit of
languages
regarding
taking some money
from up there some
excess of the early childhood
education and care fund
apparently and
was language
would.
Find I guess a bridge
between that
source of funding
and providing
services for child victims
of sexual abuse
so
just wondering I
I think these are good
good additions
I think they they
got to go to the heart of the issues
especially regarding child
victims of sexual abuse it seems
like early
childhood
Fund R.
that that seems to be a to be a
legitimate use
of that money so just
wondering why the executive
didn't include that language if anybody
knows.
Senator response.
Madam chair and Representative
Brown I'm so the
agent the executive
recommendation all fully
supports
the agency's
request
so within not
appropriation
on the HSD
R. does have funding
on for that
purpose.
Madam chair thank you
Mr chair was I
not sure that satisfies
me in terms of an answer
of I don't
think I think the language
matters and LFC
apparently thought it was
important so maybe
someone can
shed some
light.
I'm not a madam chair
representative
so with regards
specifically to the
1.$3000000
contingency language
for the early childhood education and
care fund the executive
recommendation is not
recommend any revenue
from the early childhood education
and care fund so
it it doesn't need
that language of
the language in the LFC
recommendation you know
clarifies the source
of those funds
and make those funds
contingent on
legislation that expands
the allowable use of the early
childhood fund
because as it
stands it
that this would not be allowed to
use but there is legislation
being considered in proposed
that would expand those use
the executive just doesn't
include that language because
it's it's not relevant
to the sources that they
use revenue sources
they used in their
recommendation
with our to the other
language that
is I think
would be valid under either
recommendation and
if I don't know
of the executive has a
particular
objection to the language or if it
just it wasn't requested in wasn't
that it.
All right thank you
madam chair appreciate.
Thank you these are the folks
that have with hands
up Representative Dixon
Representative Anderson
representative
Sarinana.
Okay go ahead Representative
Dixon.
Thank you madam chair
and thank you
Ellen
raven and Ryan Travis
for your presentations and
Disturbia for
years as well
I wanted to
talk a little bit
about.
The difference in
funding and
the impacts
that.
You would have
on sexual
assault service providers
particularly in our
rural
communities
and so.
Frank would you be able
to address
that.
Madam chair representative
Dixon to a
certain degree I know
that
we we
and CBRC collectively
with a lot of
our.
Coalitions and
stakeholders we
we work to
to try to address and
fill the gaps in our
rural parts of the state
I know that I can tell you
that are
sexual salts are
seen nurses
sometimes have to travel to or
3:00 hours to
find a state exam
for survivor
no. We're
trying to mitigate
that and there's
ways in which to do
that
one of the things that I
I know that's always come up for
us is that the
rate in which seen
nurses actually
get paid.
Hasn't been addressed in
I want to say 2
decades so
that's something that we definitely
need to address
it's the issue of sustainability
because a lot of the nurses
that actually you
know I
find the same
examples
don't stay on because
ultimately they don't get
compensated for the
travel so
ultimately if you're having to
travel you know 3:00
hours to a particular
location you know
conduct a state in which may
take between 4 to 6:00
hours right and
then travel back in another
30 get
travel they don't get compensated
for the mileage they don't get
compensated for the time
the only get compensated
for the actual
exam itself
so that's something the
coalition wants to
address
and and there's ways in which
to do that
there's also we've
we're working closely the
coalition is to try
to develop relationships
also with various hospitals
to utilize various
in various
medical facilities
right so there is no
need for tribal but again
it's the training issue and
it's making sure that we have
the funds available
to make sure that
senior senator
specifically
and actually volunteer their
time because this is separate
this is completely separate from
their from their regular
work because they
volunteer they do get
compensated for but again it's
just for the actual exam
itself but
that's.
Representative Dixon that's
just one example
of our.
Many challenges that we're
trying to kind
of.
Address right
one of the biggest things is
well in the coalition sees
this is a
hotline and that's why we
want to create our own state
hotline and that's why it's
critical we
understand that a lot
of our service
organizations.
It is especially in our rural
parts don't miss is that
don't necessarily have the
counseling services
that are necessary orders
you know that address the
specific need
of baby a sexual assault
victim or child abuse
victim and
so we're wanting to provide
them a particular resource
for you can possibly just
telephone and right with
hopes that we could act would
mediate some of
the stressors with regards
to
the sexual assault
on that
Representative Dixon
I I could go on and on with
some of the ways in which we want
to improve that
I think I I don't know if
that answers your question or
not. Yes
I'm. Madam
chair Mr W. F.
thank you I'm that
did the other
concern that I have though
is the
our 12
month wait
list because I
think one of the
issues that we should be
looking at as
a legislature is the
impact of
trauma
and not just for individuals
but the cost for society
and so I am very concerned
that a 12 month
wait list for some of these
services
can negatively
affect
recovery
can you speak to that
at all.
Madam chair representative
Dixon it's unfortunate
but even in our
more our
metro areas right
like like Santa
Fe on
Albuquerque in Los
crucis.
You would think that we would be able
to tap into a good
source of counseling
services and that's not
necessarily the case
but it's unfortunate
because either there is
no there's
no.
There's no.
There are no individuals in a rural
parts of the state
that are
want to find this
particular type of counseling
right so so we need to
incentivized
by centralizing them is
to pay them more
our metro areas one of
the biggest issues that we hear
about a lot from
our our on our
on our service
providers is that
sometimes they don't even pay a living
wage so
McDonald's target
they pay more
right and
require less
right off of those
individuals all
right crisis centers sometimes
their licensed counselors
are paid between 15 to
$18 an hour
and you can actually earn
more and either
Walmart or target so
one of the things that the coalition
is working diligently
is trying to address that
particular gap and
provide counselors
a living wage
which is which
which we hope will
sustain those programs
and ultimately eliminate
some of those
requests.
Thank you very much Mr
Zubia and
that chairman Trujillo I just
have one more question
that I'd like to ask of
Mr Zubia and that
is get sometimes
we hear about increases
in funding not
being spent
effectively and efficiently
and so one of the things that I'd like
to understand or make sure
of is that
if if we
were to approve the
executive
recommendation or
you know come back to in
the future that
those funds you know there
are service
providers that
are ready to do this and
so we wouldn't be
scrambling and sort
of.
You know using our money
inefficiently thank
you.
Thank you and the
did you have a
response
director
Sabiha.
Madam chair representative
Dixon once
again
I encourage this committee
to adopt
the executive
recommendation
I it would be
unfortunate because our
state is looking at a huge
deficit October 1
and we don't know how to address
that and I know
it's it's and I I
think you all are extremely
familiar that our state is
not getting we're getting
more violent and there's
just more violence in our state
and we have to address the
needs of the victims that it's
ultimately affecting
especially our most vulnerable
which is our children
thank you thank you thank you
very much if you've already
spoken and don't have another
question well you put your
hands down
also the next
person on my list is
Representative Anderson
followed by Representative said
not yet followed by
Representative
Garcia.
Thank you madam chairman
and.
I would start by
asking LFC
analyst.
Yes this.
Funding
cut
in federal
revenues.
This October
1.
A brand new data points
since the budget was
prepared
question.
Madam chair representative
Anderson
yes that is a new
piece of information that
I was alerted to just
within the past couple of days and
discussed with the agency
on the phone this morning to make
sure I yes
understood it they explained to
me that it would
be a reduction from
what they had estimated with
15000000 in
revenue.
Thank you and the reduction
I think
is 2.8000000
and is that a you
is that is that a
number we can take to the
bank so to
speak LFC
or
DFA.
At one I'm sorry to
cut you off on my my question
is maybe the agency
is the one best to
answer
that.
Madam chair Representative
Anderson
just a point of
correction we
we advise this committee
back in October that there
was going to be invoke a
cut at the
time we were closing out our
federal fiscal year
Representative Anderson
our federal fiscal year
ended September 30
yes we did our presentation
the end of October
and we are told this
committee
that we were anticipating a
15 to 18
percent cut
after reading the numbers
Representative Anderson it's a
22 percent
cut so
it it's it's of the
22 percent yes is
a new speaker
but
it's not necessarily
a surprise
that we were we because we
were advising everybody
for at least 2
years Representative
Anderson I
and I'm I'm I I apologize
representatives and I
I I don't
remember your
second question and I want to
make sure you're dressed
thank you
the of.
So.
So okay
I think I understand that that
that these recommendations for
both the DFA and the
executive of
now have a further reduction
in federal funding
yes. And
what surprises me a little
bit in looking at that
is in the
presentation on the
orange page
of
LFC got general
fund is
7.781
executive at
12.035
and the fed
funds of supports
state steady at
15.
Kind of a question I would have thought
perhaps maybe if New
Mexico put up more
money of the feds
might as well
but I'm not going to dwell on that
I'm gonna ask a question
about the voca
cut does
this is one of the few agencies
where I don't hear about
any M. impact
from build back
America should
pass in my
under the impression
that in a
passage of bill back
America will have no
impact on this
20.
20 percent
reduction.
Madam chair
Representative Anderson
currently there is no
appropriation going
to the department of
justice to affect
our funding either voca
which is victims of crime
act are by what
which is our violence against women
act funding so
we we don't know anything
as of yet Representative
Anderson.
Very much of Madam
chairman I just ask one more
question and then to make
a COVID of
let's see my next question
is
please review
briefly the
impact on
service expansion
to
rural
areas.
That is part
of the object the
objective of
this
large expansion
item I think I saw
5000000
as a numbers if
I looking at that
correctly.
One.
And and and Representative
Anderson
yes the.
Executive recommended a
$5000000 increase
for sexual assault services
to do a significant
expansion
if your question is about
exactly what
services they would be
expanding at the I think that's
something right can
answer okay for
please short
answer.
Madam chair representative
interesting I I will
let you know that 27
out of the 33
counties in New Mexico
are in adequately
funded or
have little to
no
support services
especially for sexual assault
victims so
our our focus would
be to
enhance or
create and
develop
new programs in
those rural parts of the state
I don't know if that answers your question
Representative.
Thank you very much it does answer
my question madam
chairman my comment is
this.
New Mexico it
ranks
seventh
in of per
capita sexual
of violence
and we're dropping and
we're we're going up we're going to
be number one if we just keep
it out for a little bit
more
47 percent our
children
therefore
I would like
to
simply say as a funding
mechanism perhaps early
childhood up
might be follow
the LFC recommendation
and do a
potential more
to use someone else's
term in a state
of the state speech a few
years back so
pinch more
out of that fund might
help mitigate
this of
substantial loss of
revenues and
perhaps continue to
provide
of
expansion in this
important area
so I
suspect whatever
of motion we
accept today we might
have a chance to revisit
thank you madam
chair.
Representative Anderson I think
that's correct David Abbey
is listening
and.
Everyone knows the
process we always
recommend the LFC
recommendation but
that we go back and revisit
what was discussed as you
know Representative
Dixon is taking
very good notes as I'm sure
staff R. as
well and maybe
David can help guide
us about.
Increasing
things in the
next
process yes
David.
I made note of this already
and thank you madam chair for
flagging it as well I
just think it's really important
to get more
documentation of this federal
funding issue including
going back to the federal agency
or our congressional
delegation so I
maybe the analyst to work with
Mr Zubia to do that but
we we need to pin
that down like
to see the details
in general
you know federal funding is not going to
go so so anyway that's
just a suggestion
sure.
Okay so so
what all of you have
your request made
by David
Abbey the
sooner you get the information
the better it is for us and
that as a committee
of the whole wish
insure that we've addressed
the concerns and so
the next person on the
list is
Representative Sara
Gnagna thank you madam
chair and thank thanks for the
presentation I think isn't
really valuable
so I
many my questions have been asked but I
just want to make a couple comments
which ma'am as it were
as a teacher during the
COVID had a lot of
students who would
I was a high school teacher so they would stay
after and we can
8 I needed to talk because they were
given getting the counseling services
they normally would get so
they would talk and
that I'm not as
you don't make that much is
here the staff
is.
As we
say the amount
thank
you.
Okay David
please me you.
Okay go ahead that we
so like I said that
I would stay after and just talk
with them but I was in a counselor but they
were they they were used
to getting services they were getting
on they were a lot of them
were in crisis
and and and I would try to help
him as much as I could or percent for
the they needed but we
how much how much rise
in in this these areas
did you see or have you
seen
over the last year or
2.
In counseling or
crisis.
Madam chair representative
surrounding it did
it was a huge
well
it.
It was there there was a discrepancy
with regards to how we were actually
capturing that information
I say this because
a lot of individuals were not
necessarily reporting to law
enforcement right
but they were seeking services
from service providers
service service providers
services actually increased
but reporting to law
enforcement this is
the kind of staying stagnant
right so
individuals were continuing to
seek services
that's why it's it's
incredibly
critical that we
we we try to get ahead of the
game as opposed to getting letting
it get worse
because because of the
pandemic there is
been a and and
a huge influx
of individuals seeking
services and
now these agencies are
overtaxed so
as opposed to waiting a couple of
weeks or even months
maybe to see a a
licensed counselor a
licensed mental health provider
you're waiting now 6
to 8 months or even a
year.
And that's truly unfortunate
of for all
survivors not and
and I'm in any it
it's we as the
compensation program
we were trying to
Representative is kind
of not necessarily
actively address it
because our funding
you don't have to go
to.
Per se a
specific
are.
Service provider you could
go to any counselor
and our compensation
program would ultimately
pay that 100 percent
so we but it's
again working with those
with those organizations
those.
The service organizations throughout
the state to make sure that those
victims were were were
provided compensation
application submitting those
compensation applications
so we could potentially
mitigate.
Representative Sonney at if
if we don't find a way in
which to try to fix this
right in our
states it's only gonna get
worse because
individuals we're
not going to be able to
sustain
the ever growing
needs of victims
services in order to
service providers across the
state.
Thank thank you madam chair thank you
Mr CBS I agree I think
this is a great program I
order so much with my
students I'm just
hoping we can provide it to the level needs
to be so thank you.
Thank you and are Representative
Harry Garcia.
Thank you madam chair of
the school should be for Mrs will be
a thanks for the
presentation first of
all Mr proving
you mentioned the 27 counties
out of the 33 are under
funded for sexual assault
violence.
What was your last to address
these issues to begin
with.
Madam chair representative Garcia
what was I I didn't catch that
last question
are you are you
mentioned that there was 27
colonies were under
funded for special
items
San.
What were your asked from the
state to address
these issues.
Your ****.
Yes
yes.
Okay so Madam
chair representative
Garcia so
that we we were
working with the
coalition
I think if if I can I
can share my screen again or I
can just verbally
let you know that
the breakdown would
be.
Bear with me for a sec
2000000 it would go to
sexual assault programs
so this would be for the rape
crisis centers across the
state Representative
Garcia so
again they would increase
capacity so they were
increase in individuals
by hiring additional
individuals to make sure
that they have the the
capacity the human
capital in which to
address those particular
needs but then
also.
As I stated earlier
find a rate
increase
because as as
I stated as
before we
Representative Dixon
a lot of our state nurses
there's a there's a schedule
that the coalition is actually put
out for sexual assault nurse
examiners and and
that schedule hasn't been
touched in about 2
decades so we
need to make sure that we're
we're paying our
nurses a living
wage in order for them to
to continue to provide that
particular service
and then obviously to sustain
the workforce
again Representative
Garcia one of the
biggest things that we see
is attrition
through a lot of our non
our our our our our
nonprofit organizations in
the state
there's a lot of people that want
to work for the nonprofit
organizations but
I I can assure you because
as us as a
funder there's some
organizations in our state that
are paying less than
McDonald's
so and and these
nonprofit organizations
require that you
have at least a
bachelor's or more
in order to provide those
services but when you're
paying $12 an
hour that's unrealistic
so what they're wanting to do
is to make sure that they can
sustain
a.
Viable and good
workforce to provide
those services that's
$2000000
$0 would be for mental
health and and
that's to kind of reiterate what
I stated earlier to
Representative site so
this was that
we we we're we
are weightless for counselors
in our state is just
it's it's it's some
I I don't know how to say this
it's it's just that it's it's
not even bad it's horrible
when when you're having
individuals you
know from any age
having to wait 6
months or more to
go and see a licensed
counselor who specializes
in sexual assault is
just it's centered up
and and it's unfortunate
because I believe that was
Representative Anderson stated
that we are seventh in
the nation when it
comes to sexual assault
and we're not doing when
we're doing just the bare
minimum to address that
particular issue
1.3000000
would go to a
representative Garcia would go
to enhance
and then also to
create children advocacy
centers across the
state.
Currently.
We have
we
have.
There you go sorry I'm
currently representative Garcia
we have 11
child advocacy centers
across the state.
That's that's not enough we
need more.
We're some of our
just to give you an example Representative
Representative Garcia
so.
Yes yes madam
chair up if if something
happens in tier
C. or Sapporo
those children are having
they're they're they're
having to be driven up to
either Albuquerque
or or down
south to Los
crucis to
to have a forensic interview
conducted and that's
truly unfortunate
I'm a representative
Garcia that
500000 would
be to the
hotline which would
create a hotline for
sexual assault services and
then 200000
would be for us to enhance
our services and coordinate
better on our
Indian land
to have and we
do have a good working relationship
right now with our needed coalition
but it's it's important that
we enhance that Representative
Garcia and I hope I answered
your question.
Thank you madam
chair I want to put a check mark
on this we can revisit
it you know what
he's talking about
is so huge and what
I Representative Anderson
said in a reasonable we
should be seventh in the nation
on on sexual
violence but we need
to address these issues
one more question madam chair
of Mr groovy I you
mentioned that you wanted
$60300
for UCV
Garcia
employment.
What is your vacancy rate
right now.
Madam chair representative Chris
yet we're at 37
percent vacancy rate so we have
10 vacancies right
now we have I positions
that were actively we're
we already interviewed
we're in the process of hiring
so W.
as your question we're currently
at 37 percent.
Okay Mister will be another
37 percent how many
are funded.
So I'm.
I I I do want it I
I want to make sure that I'm accurate
we.
Madam chair representative
Garcia half of our
staff is funded with
federal funds so
we we share
that cost with all of our
federal funding
so we take 5 percent of
the administrative federal
funds and then that's how we
support half of our
staff. And
then the other half which
is about
18
of our our general
fund approach there's
general fund the
general fund
with our general fund
appropriation.
Thank you madam chair issues
will bill on your
vacancy rate the to what
you're asking for
how many are you asking for for the
$60000 a the the
the question.
Madam chair representative Garcia
one. One
person.
Okay one
more question madam chair Mister
Moville.
Third one more
question.
This will be allowed for madam chair
promised.
Okay one of the
how your audit last year
do Jenny findings.
Madam chair representative
Garcia we had no
findings in no
recommendations.
Thank you Mr thank you madam
chair thank you
representative Garcia.
I'm the I think
with I don't have any other
hands up and I think
that with the information
that had been
has been discussed I think
pretty thoroughly right
now. There
is concern from the committee
that up there does
need to be more
money
allocated to this particular
department that I think
that with what David is
asking Frank
if you can get that information
to
Ellen and to
Brian
regarding whatever
whatever the request
was with the federal
funds David that
they can that we can start moving
forward and then we'll have to
sufficient information to get
out to make an informed
decision hopefully
with an increase
in the full committee
meets Frank
yes what is that
madam chair I can provide
you
department of justice just put
out their crime victims fund
report
and it's it's
incredibly interesting
because they actually have
charts and you'll
see how
under the
previous of
presidential
administration
there was very
few convictions
that were collected
and in exchange right
so there's a different administration
and they're seeking out and
the focus fix is also going to
hopefully stabilize the
funding so but
again it it won't reach
the state for another couple
years so
this is what I would ask you to do
Frank because David
asked for that
information so that
his LFC staff can
also help you make an
informed decision
and Bryan your you should
be in on it as well
and that way the sooner
you get whatever information
that you can
we can have it for the full
committee meeting that ends at
this the end of this week so
the sooner the better
okay yes madam chair
thank you thank you
all were there any final
questions for this presenter
or these
are.
Our employees no
okay we're gonna go on to the
next
presentation and that
is no I
haven't yes but all I'm
sorry we need a
motion yes we
do thank you for reminding
me
madam chair
I would
like to make a
motion that we adopt
we recommends the LFC
recommendation
with the understanding that
their future discussions
about the amount and
necessary language.
And I see shaking of
heads
so
is there anyone in opposition
to this raise your
hand if there's anyone in
opposition to this
motion if not
the motion carries and we'll
move forward.
The.
Who seconded it
thank you madam chair thank
you Sir you've got
a second and the
motion carries thank
you the next
item on the agenda is
number 516
dip Department of game and
fish.
Madam chair I I will
be I'll wait for the LFC
analysts but I will be covering
for doctor Miner I'm
obviously not him but he's
in another hearing and so I
will
do you want to go further
down the list
I'm
the executive director is here
so I think.
Okay. And I'll
do my best I'm not sure
who is covering
for LFC
it is
okay.
I want
to start out
Cindy.
Of course
okay Sir David
okay madam chair members
of the committee this is
agency 516
again Cynthia
Martinez covering
for Dr
Andrew Miner for
on behalf of the executive
with me present is
also director Avid and
I believe we have that
director us
alone here from game and
fish and so
with that I'll just start
with a quick high level
just a reminder that
the Department of game
and fish is supported by revenue
from state sources
such as hunting and fishing
hunting fishing
and license fees
and federal sources so no
general fund in this
budget.
Overall
the LFC recommendation increases
revenue by 10 percent compared
to the current operating here
while the executive recommendation
increases it by 7
percent so a
majority of the recommendation
and are recommended
increases from both the LFC
and exec are banned
not personal services
employee benefits
and support reduce
reducing vacancy rate
rates among the agency
and if you look at the high level
roll up really the main
difference is 1.2000000
between the 2
recommendations and
that is primarily actually it's
only in other
revenue.
And with that I'll turn it over
to date if you want to cover the next
program which is 516
field
operations.
Yeah and just to make some
general comments the
LFC
recommendation.
I accepted the
executive agency
request which
was about a.
10 percent increase
the HSD
request.
Had a double digit
increase in compensation
and
in general.
Both the affair LFC or
treating compensation
separately in the back of
the bill with some exceptions where
Aussie has targeted
amounts for additional
compensation above
the the the racks
which also about the same
between LFC and DFA
around some percent
so LFC accepted
the the request for
funding but hold
back the compensation
increases to about
66 to 8 percent
depending on the program
on top of whatever is done in
the back of the bill.
And then took the
savings and again cause
these are other state funds except
at the request of other state
funds and moved it to other
areas like
purchasing vehicles and
that's what so
also this agency
I would notice a significant
fund balances
mentioned on
page 210.
Of our slide into the looks like
the ending balance in the game
protection fund last year
was
20.$6000000
so this
along with 45
other funds that the
department uses stance
and HMCS Stangel
balances
to some degree can be
used to support the cat
Public Project
so that's
my general comment and
that I think we
probably could
run through the programs
very quickly that the
up. The 2
big programs are
conservation field
operations
and the differences
are again
mostly in person
in field operations
it's well it's only 23000
LFC hired field
operations with racist
slightly higher than the
executive then I'm
gonna jump ahead and do conservation
that that's okay
LFC has
and and and is higher
in personal services
budget in conservation
services by
about half 0 with higher
increases
so.
Cindy.
I'm really the last
of the the programs
there I would just
say for wildlife
a program of it
took 6718
minimal differences there's
a difference of about 40
5000 so that's
that's fairly minimal and
then program support
the same difference
of about 120
8000 and
again mostly in
PSEB so those
are the major differences between the
2 major programs
in general in general
the executive recommendation
is still about 11 percent
higher than the current year
and with that I'll turn it
over to our director
Sloan.
Thank you
Mr.
Chair representative thank you for the
opportunity to come before you
today.
As you know the department works
diligently to conserve
wildlife for all New Mexicans
with an eye toward future
generations in
order to accomplish this goal that
we must be careful stewards of
both our wildlife and
fiscal resources
we believe that the executive
representative.
Recommendation appropriately
prioritizes funding and
most critical
areas and maintains
appropriately low vacancy
rates well ensuring we
continue to deliver services
necessary for long term
persistence of
wildlife.
I'd also like to take the opportunity
to point to the importance of our special
appropriation requests for
$9000000 to support
the federal recovering America's
wildlife act
this act upon
passage will make
available
$27000000
to the Department but will
require $9000000
in match not derived
from hunting or fishing
license fees these
funds are directed for
work on species of greatest
conservation need
as identified in the state
wildlife action
plan. Species
of greatest conservation need our
species that often receive little
or no funding are
imperiled are declining
and are in need of management
assistance working on the
species will further the goal
of conserving wildlife for
future generations
as well as limit the potential
for species to be added
to the endangered species list
and the birds that come with that
listing.
Finally.
These funds will meet the declaration
set forth Mexico
wildlife conservation
act that
all New Mexicans should
contribute to conservation
ensure the recovering
America's wildlife act
funding would be transformational
for the state by ensuring we're
able to conserve the broadest
suite of wildlife
in the fourth most bio diverse
state in the nation
I hope that you will look favorably
on this request in addition
to our budget
request.
Thank you very
much
do we have any questions
from the committee
yes David you have a
comment
yes I just want to
follow up LFC has
a similar
recommendation
for our.
Of.
Lands acquisition
of about $10000000
that is a mix
of.
Our revenue.
And game and
fish revenues so I
think it's just it's
the LFC recommendation
is from
other revenues not general
fund revenues
in its in the back of the bill
sections 9 and 10
the executive recommendation isn't
harmful general fund and
I don't think this that I
think both LFC
and DFA need and and
the department need to do a
little work to understand
the federal legislation whether
restrictions involving funding
sources and so forth
but directionally
I think those things are
similar and what
at the right time when
the last scene the executive turned
to special appropriations and
other non recurring
yes so it will bring
more information on that
sure. Thank you
Mr Abbey
I have Representative
Anderson.
Thank you madam chairman then
chairman I just had a couple of quick
questions one was I was
curious what the vacancy
rate was
for the conservation
officer
position.
Madam chair representative
so the the the
vacancy rate excluding
that 12
recruits that we currently have going
through training I a pro will
be available
in the field starting in may
and the remainder in the fall
is around
20 percent if you include
those 12 were down to 10
percent will
again be recruiting in
may at the end of the
college graduation season
and hopefully be able to to
drive that even farther
down. And
as a follow up question madam
chairman do we have a
sense that the
of let's see the higher
education track
these conservation
officers take
is our has
sufficient students
to make.
I know in in for example
education were woefully
deficient how would you
describe conservation
career law
enforcement
officers.
You madam chair Representative
Anderson
so that they
program at New Mexico
state for a number
of years was not
as strongly oriented
towards our
state agencies were
that's changing very
rapidly there I know
that western New Mexico has
a wildlife
law enforcement program that
they've developed so I feel
like where we're turning a corner
in that I think
that's represented by the fact
that we had you
know. K.
5 recruits and
their recruitment awhile
back and 7 in this last
one so if you like
what we're turning a
corner
thanks in large measure
to some of the pay that that
legislature's intent to
provide as well
as some of those programs that you
mentioned really
changing their focus a little
bit thank you very
much for that answer just one
follow up. I
noticed in the
narrative of
volume 2
that we're talking about vehicle
replacement
of $299000
in doubt DFA
analyst Cindy I
just wanted to confirm
that.
That 299000
is not general fund
I read it correctly is that
correct correct there's
no general fund in this
budget.
Thank you very
much and I
appreciate your presentation
thank you madam chairman.
Thank you.
I don't see any other
hands
so
Representative Chatfield
now you pop up okay
go ahead.
Thank you madam chair I just be but
not more than the other hand I
need.
Hi.
Keeps you keep
moving
the.
Thank you madam chair director Sloan
can you tell me some of the acceptable
uses of the contrary
what more could well
at wildlife
at.
Money's.
Madam chair representative Chatfield
yes so that
money is focused on species
of greatest conservation
need the state of New Mexico
has identified 235
species
that are either imperilled are in
decline
and so we can spend money
doing projects
that benefit those and that's
everything from
habitat management
2 research
to education
and then factor law
enforcement or a
species that are being illegally
taken and those sorts of things
sorry it covers the broad
suite of things that we are able
to do but it's focused on those
species of greatest conservation
need and the
state gets to define what
species those are.
So madam chair director
Sloan is that money available
to
participate.
Madam chair Senator Chattfield
yes.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you.
We look or I feel like
a much in that TV
show where the the
family is all in on
in squares
and you keep moving around
I don't see anyone else
with their hands up or the
little hand your hand
up so
Representative
Dixon.
Thank you madam chair I
would move that the
subcommittee
recommends the
LFC
recommendation.
Think that there's a
second to that
and based on
again director Avid
suburban Dacians
please of
have further
conversations so that we
can get updated
information to
make an informed decision
the big committee thank you
very much Mr
Stewart.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representatives.
Thank you the next item
on the agenda
is the youth
conservation
corps brought.
Yes we're gonna vote I was
testing you.
All of you who are
opposed opposed
please raise
rents.
Jack you're opposed.
Okay.
There's one
against.
When we get to
again or just when the
kids want
okay.
The motion carries.
Thank you very
much.
The next item on the agenda
is
the youth conservation
corps with the
Mr oneness
minor.
And is that you miss is
what that will be
presenting okay.
David do you have a question
no it's Megan from just
one whose it Senate finance
and Cindy also okay
okay.
Okay. Thank you
I thank
you so we'll go
first.
First this
time.
Yes conservation corps
David.
Okay miss Martinez maybe you
should go first
okay.
Are we ready okay
yes
this is agency I 20
to use quick conservation
corpse and
and let's
see there are
no differences between the LFC
and executive recommendation
both increase
the use of the agencies fund
balance and reduce
other uses from
other state revenues
and resulting in a
very small
decrease from the current
year and the revenue
recommendations are based
on YCC is expected
grant contracts for
fiscal year 23
and so as you can see
that the differences
really there's no
differences between the 2
executive in LFC
recommendation and there's
just a slight difference compared
to the current operating here of
5600
and I believe we have with this
executive director
Serra would as well
and but I'll pass it over to David
first for any
comments.
Go ahead David are
you.
Yes.
One comment I want to
make a
complaint.
Page
225.
It's it's a good
thing these recommendations are
similar because I'm a little behind
the 8 ball about and
I think so
take you the one but
important for the committee to consider
the last sentence
above white the legislature
could consider a special
appropriation for YC
sees Fund balance
that directs the agency
to use the funds for state
parks improvements project
I think we're I
can't put my fingers on the
phone I think there's
let's see on the previous
page
YCC.
The fund
balance.
Well 0 said I'll try
to pin it down but I I just
want to make that observation
that is a pretty
significant Fund belts and might be
able for for nonrecurring
purposes and maybe
miss what can help comment on
that but that's the note that are
analyst makes that you
know we know we have significant state
parks needs and there's a
this is you're more
revenue from
other state funds that
is probably coming in
faster than they can use up
sure legislators can find all
for extra money thank
you madam chair.
Okay.
Is that what and then we're
going to have questions.
Go ahead miss what.
Well thank you madam chair and
good afternoon members of the committee
it's good to see you
again
it is a happy
circumstance where the agency
requests and the
LESC recommendation and
executive recommendation
all agree so
I don't have much to say about
that I will say that
90 percent of our budget
goes towards the
projects for
hiring and training
youth ages 14 to
25 and of
each requests has to
spend 70 percent of the money
they receive encore
member wages and
spend 10 percent of the
time in
training we
have had to kind
of low years due
to change in
person and also
the impacts of COVID
19 I
can tell you
that we do have a
robust
number of applicants this
year so I
think that we
will be so many more of
our distribution this
year I'm
in regards to the
the fund balance and also in
response to something
Representative Brown asked
us last year
how can we work with other
state agencies to
get YCC
projects into those
agencies so
we will be very soon
and finalizing the cooperative
procurement agreement with
EMNRD
and that includes
making money available state
parks mining and
minerals has YCC
project they're ready to go
with and
forestry has also been
invited to use some of
those funds and
these will be 5 year
agreements so we'll be
able to
use our fund balances to
encumber that money
that will also make
it easy
for the agencies to
plan and higher
use because right
now it's
kind of.
Absolutely it's hard for state
agencies to take advantage of the
YCC program because of
the hiring aspect of
it that just takes a little
bit more time
so I'm very
pleased with with that
initiative
and.
I need that's basically
all I have so I stand
for questions
okay let me
go through Director Abbey
followed by Representative
Anderson thank
you madam chair so I I
found the phone bills in the
chat it so from the app
0.
That's that's a lot for an
agency of this
size.
There recurring revenue
is
yes
only about half of it is being
expended so that balance is
growing and madam
chair when I hear comments that
the agency is working with
other agencies to find
ways to spend the money
it just strikes me
that's our conversation
I would recommend
that the committee
asked the agencies to come
in and make
those recommendations to
the legislature so that can be
incorporated House Bill to
slow Legislature plays its
role as the appropriating
body the
agencies these
are earmarked revenues so
legally as possible
for for the agencies
to enter into
uses but it would it
seems to me more appropriate
that the appropriations
committee and Senate finance the phone
legislature have a hand
in in directing that
additional
spending.
Thank you
Representative Anderson
thank you madam chairman
of Mr Abbey
let's see my question
was.
1.no
7.5000000
I just is not a
of agency
that of
sweeps back
to the general fund
the money.
So the revenue comes from the
governmental gross receipts
tax and it's a it
looks like near market by
10 percent so this
is one of those continuing
appropriations the
legislature makes
that LFC
typically isn't isn't
wild about because it
results in just a
situation where
money is spent for
purposes other than intended
directed by the legislature
and their limitations on ways
that could be spent when you
clearly have other needs that are
compelling so it's
it's a function of an air market
continuing appropriation
but it can be I
think but it's gratifying
to hear the directors say
that some of the ideas LFC
staff had
about better ways to use that they're
looking at so I I just
think in the next 2 weeks that are to
be possible for them
to bring to work with
the Secretary
props to bring those ideas
and then that could be more
memorialized in the General
Appropration.
You final question madam
chairman and
this would
if there were Lujan was
language relative
to the 7.5000000
that.
Went to
the the yak
projects
so wouldn't be what the
yak.
Us out can compensation
and wages it would
be act
compensation
wages.
Administrative
costs and
actual project costs
it seems like that might be a
produce much to
state agencies
like state
parks.
Some of our of
monuments that
might really jump
on the idea
that they not
only gain of
summer workforce but
they also came
of some kind of
match your money
4 of the project
itself do you think
that has merit
this
would.
Thank you are Representative
Anderson and
members of the committee.
So I think what you're asking
if. So much
of the grant goes to wages
can there sort of be a match
to help with
the costs of the
project correct
because 30 percent
of each project
they can spend on
administration
materials and supplies
any kind of training
supplies
and many of our
current projects yes they need
to find a
match they're required to
provide matching 20 percent
off and they
provide more
so that's definitely
I'm viable
idea. Thank
you very much for that we
should I think
pursuant because right it
sort of sounds like a win win
to me and
I to have some
concern about
of on
use fund balance is
getting.
Disproportionate to the size
of the agency
of last a point
is simply this
agency would.
In your training component
is there any time
dedicated to
personal financial
management.
Yes thank you for that
question Representative
Anderson and members of the
committee it is
up to
every.
Up. Is
our entity that is
submitting a proposal to
decide on their training
program yes
a great many of them
have included financial
literacy as
part of their training programs
are not required to do
that but they have
voluntarily started
doing that yes
very fine well you're not being
singled out for that certainly
but I hope we hear
more about that a year from now
thank you madam chairman that's
why I no
further questions.
Yes thank you very
much and
I don't see any other hands
up so I'm gonna
go to our
vice chair.
Thank you madam chair
I would move that the
US subcommittee
recommends the
LFC
recommendation
and that
we ask
that
at the youth
court up
provide some additional
language work with the
LFC so that
we can memorialize
some of that additional
spending.
Thank you is there a
second second
I madam chair Harry Garcia
seconds is there any
opposition.
Okay they're they're all
in favor of
vice chair Dixon
so we have a
we have this
completed thank you so
much this is what
we're ms would
our next our next
the agenda
item is
of B. use
900 which is
the Indian Affairs
Department
and the presenters
are.
Mr chair should be AA
and miss miss miss
yes.
And then I'll have
secretary he'll
introduce our staff
percent.
Madam chair.
Is a sandy for covering this
one.
Yes madam chair
I will be covering for Nicola
she's in the other
HFC subcommittee so
I will allow
let you go first there
already thank you
again my name is action a of
the LFC Alice for
Indian Affairs Department
you can see LFC right
up on it
affairs department in your volume
choose a page
249.
I just want to mention we've got
secretary Trujillo
here.
Main differences between
the LFC and
executive
LFC recommended
about a 10 percent increase
in general fund revenue
for the for
the department and
the executive
recommended about a
64
percent increase
and the based recommendation of
the LFC wrecked would fill about
one FTE
and the executive would feel about
to
decisions.
LFC may take contractual
services spending commensurate
with the 22 operating
budgets at the
executive recruiter would increase
contractual spending about
44 percent.
LFC would grow the case the
other category 5.6
percent while the executive
with grow the other category
about 80
percent. There
were no differences
in performance.
The the main difference
I guess was in the
expansion
the executive recommended about
684.7000
if you look on that first page
there you'll notice
that the agency actually
requested
576
so the executive
went above
LFC
above the request I'm sorry
on the
on the expansion
of and I
guess part of that was for
the use
for suicide prevention
program that was the first this
is the first time LCS heard about
that.
LFC recommended
189.1000
without a capital outlay manager
and financial
supervisor.
To allow the department to
distribute capital funds a
little more
efficiently and effectively
with that I'll pass it over
to miss
Martinez.
Representative
secretary.
Thank you thank you madam
chair and members of the committee so I'll
just I'll just highlight a couple of
really important items in the executive
recommendation
like Eric mentioned
based recommendation for
the agency and aware
of the executive supports
but you know filling
additional positions and that's really
critical for the agency
the other major increases
just combined between that
contracts in the other category
and and that is a good chunk of
money that's in there about
800000 for
us suicide prevention
initiatives and these would
be within the tribal communities
of the other really important
piece which Eric alluded to
is the the expansion
in their
$684000
in the expansion all
of it in PSEB and
so this supports
helping the agency to fill
some really or to
create and fill some really
critical positions there's 8
of them and that
those are by one of you
know let you know which ones those are
it's a public information
officer the capital
outlay chair the Eric talked
about a financial
supervisor I
tried tribal environmental
specialist a data
analyst
tribal consultation
specialist suicide
prevention specialist
and and and some
support for the secretary
and so with that I
will turn it over to secretary
Trujillo.
Good afternoon secretary to
hear it so nice to see you here
would you introduce yourself and your
staff.
Sure good afternoon madam
chair members of the
committee Ellen
Trujillo secretary for
the Indian Affairs Department
I'm also joined
by needing could
test the service as departments
W. secretary
we also have cooking
Rivera was tuning in
in the audience who serves
as our director
for policy and
legislation and
then also wanted in dollars
who is currently assisting
the department with
the overseeing our
HSD
functions
I wanna thank you madam
chair members of the committee for
your time today
I also want to thank
our DFA analyst
Nico make Macias
who is another committee
hearing and for Cindy
for pinch hitting
and also our LFC
analysts arching
a in terms of
this presentation I'm
gonna move briefly through the
through the presentation for
you all I know you have the power point
slides there I'm in
front of you but I just
really wanted to quickly
kind of move through I
think a lot of the plans for
maybe buying
those Cindy
and ERAC
I think it's really important
to point out
just the executive
recommendation for the
department and how it
really increase the
budget and support for the
work that we do on a daily
basis
primarily
for us we're looking at
increasing our budget
priorities in terms
of our FTEs
and well
I am AT
and thankful for
that recognition
by LFC inflation
you have to use related
to adding capacity
right yes do
I'm the department does
more on a daily
basis that administered
testing capital outlay
funds on the breadth
of our work is
expansive then
mandates of our department
is expansive
where one of the
smaller agencies
yes we provide critical
service to 23
sovereign nations and
native people here
in New Mexico
I'm so that's why we really
are are thankful
to the leadership of our governor
and the executive recommendation
that would increase our
capacity.
Here we have a
number of that mission
critical services that need to
be funded
I do want to note that we
have 17 current
F. T. E.'s
I'm and
then you just do
it he asked would help
us
tremendously.
We also as in the M.
mention one of our top
priorities is
on a suicide
prevention and tribal communities
which was added to our
budget by the
executive
to continue to
support the work that we
currently are doing
we would have it
one full time
person devoted to
conduct I'm ready
next testament and collect
data we also
the majority of this funding
would go towards providing
direct services grants
to native American communities
that we work with on a daily
basis.
Here are.
I'm sorry madam chair members the
committee that 7
my my talking
points I
do want to be clear
with respect to this
the FCC is
that we are requesting
these positions that clearly
within the structure of the
department and we'll move the
initiatives for
I'm critical work that aligns
with our department strategic
plan.
I'm sorry I am I wanted
to go back to the slide
with respect to the suicide
prevention efforts
I'm I I
can't advocate and NASA
about supporting this
initiative
I think unfortunately
what we've seen in light of the
pandemic it's only
exacerbated
the need for
continuing to support
mental and behavioral health
services especially
in our tribal communities
I'm here in New Mexico
prior to the pandemic
the rate of suicide
in New Mexico was the
highest
for American and Alaska
native at any racial
or ethnic groups here in New
Mexico and
as I stated before
these funds will really enable
the department to hire one
dedicated specialists to
move the work for and
work directly with tribal
communities to provide that
support
we've heard from
a tribal leadership income
and constituents
the need for more
funding
and we really must do
more of this work
and for me
this is really personal
unfortunately my family
has been personally impacted
by this crisis
and I can attest to the
fact that
more funding
I'm focused
towards tribal communities and
supporting
their initiatives are really
vital to
bringing an end to this
crisis it
really isn't much
to ask when we're talking about
human life in terms
of the budget request
that we're making as well as
FTE.
I also want to share
with you this
graph
which just
I think further
shows
the.
Capital outlay gross
that has
happened thanks
in large part to
you the
legislature as
well as the governor
but as we see in these
historic investments
take place in our tribal
communities unfortunately
the staffing and has not
increased in relation to the
Indian Affairs Department
I'm and so it's
really critical that we
continue to build
this capacity
especially as we're seeing more
funding coming into the
state as well as federal
funding and I do
anticipate another
historic year of
investments in tribal
communities which will
only add to the department's
existing portfolio
and our increase our
workload
right now we have one
person who serves as
artistic happen a outlay
administrator
and he is
busy
working directly
with tribal
communities to support
them and expenditures of
their funds
and doing all that
we can to assist
them with training
and and we recognize
the need to make
sure that we continue to
effectively and
efficiently and minister Public
dollars and that we
remain accountable
I also do you want to
highlight a couple of things
for you madam
chair members of the
committee
our departments
you know it does
the best that we can
and we've made significant
progress in reducing our
general fund
reversions
so this increase
to our budget you
know would
go a long way to supporting
us and I feel confident that
we would expand
that in
FY 21 our
general fund reversion
was
a little over
$154000
which really which equates to
4 percent of the department's
budget
this year we are aggressive.
Lee working towards expanding our
current budget so
that we can continue that
downward trend of reducing
our general fund budget
reversions I
also wanna note for
members of the committee
on that again we
had another
clean audit with 0
findings
which is really positive in terms
of the department.
I'm I also wanted to share
with you just our current
organizational chart
I know typically that question
and vacancy
rate comes up
right now we have a
vacancy rate of 12
percent it reflects
to positions
that are vacant which is our
chief financial
officer and our public
relations coordinator
we are set to
fill those vacancies
we want to
make sure that we
continue to
keep our retention rate
at the department at
high levels it's the
highest it's been
in the department's history
and I'm really proud of that
in terms of creating a
vibrant and I'm supportive
work space.
Yes I'm I
just wanted to share with members
of the committee
who may not be familiar
with our work
and number of our
accomplishments
you know as I mentioned
before we
do a lot more than just
administer on capital
outlay and tribal
infrastructure fund
so we continue to
work on that
issue wide
range of issues
impacting and and
people even
though we have limited
resources and
staffing
and will continue this
work and
with your support this
is what the expansion would
look like
we will be able to meet
more of the
pressing needs of our tribal
communities and
native people here and
I in New
Mexico
I do want to say 1
thing that's clear
is that the
work of the department
and our
role and start
statewide matters
continue to grow
and I'm very thankful
for that and I'm thankful
to you legislators
who introduced bills
that are inclusive our
department are inclusive of
our tribal communities
I'm just an
example and the
2021
session we
are requested to analyze
64 built in
15 pieces of those
legislation pieces of
legislation directly
named our department
on to carry out specific
tasks
and so we really
need hi the increased
staffing
to help our departments
carry out the intent of
legislation that names
us but as well as to
continue to provide
service
I just want to stay in
closing madam chair
members of the committee
I'm that all of our
staff at the department are
deeply committed
to serving our tribal
communities
and with your support and
the executive recommendation
we. Can and we will do
do more I want to
thank all of you for
your continued
support
and get your time
today and with that madam
chair I'll stand for any questions
thank you. Thank
you very much
I'm. Let
me see the screen so
I can see who's on
their.
They need to
skip.
Right here I think you have to stop
sharing.
Right I'm thank
you
okay thank you so
much Secretary
treat you
you see
one.
One hand up right
now and that is
up to hands up.
And 3
hands up all good thank you
Meredith we'll start
with the
Representative
Brown.
Thank you very much sure
thank you for The presentation
to to everyone
ms Trujillo
we are are you Secretary
Trujillo is that we call your
director and
secretary Trujillo but you
can always call me land
as you
secretary that you heard
the title
madam chair and madam
secretary so the
overall budget for the Indian
Affairs Department
for FY 22
is what 2.8
8000000
yes I am I reading that
right.
Madam chair
Representative brown that is
correct
okay so
madam chair and and
madam secretary so
I was looking at their
reversions chart
that's in our third
volume of our financial
set this year and.
I noticed that for
a budget of
2.8000000
there was a reversion in
2021 of
$780000
and that's a pretty
sizeable
portion of the overall
budget and then in the year
preceding in FY
20 the
reversion was 350
7000
so it looks like in both
years
some money that was meant
for programming or whatever didn't
get spent and
went back into the general fund so I'm
just curious madam
chair madam
secretary issued explain what
happened
there.
Thank you madam
chair
Representative Brown and members of the
committee and may I ask
for some assistance
from one Dickens Aulus
I did see the table
that is located
in buying 3 of the
LFC reporter and
was curious to
in terms of the number that
was represented for FY
21 I look
back at our
audit that was submitted for
FY 21 the
numbers differ
and so I guess they would ask
LFC in terms
of their reversions
what is inclusive of
that I did you know
that with respect to our
operating budget
Representative brown
that are reversion
was
$154900
I do see
on our audit
that there is a
general fund capital outlay
reversion that
is
$558000
we also had
New Mexico Public Education
Department funding was a
transfer that we
received and house
bill 2
of a reversion of
a little over
$410000
it was my understanding
from our previous person
who is assisting us
with CFO duties that
that
reversion
because of the nature of the transfer
was not to count against
Indian Affairs
Department
but I could be wrong in
that we
also had reversions
of a little over
$209000
and special appropriations
which is typically
junior bill monies for
special projects
that had reverted
and then as I stated
our our general fund
reversion which is a little
over
$154000
I'm so that number
differs from what was
included in the table in
the LFC
report
I will speak
to
that public and.
Cation department reversion
that I highlighted which was
house came over and house
bill 2
a majority of those reversions
unfortunately tribes
as you know during the
pandemic were often
shut down
had limited
staffing had
said in terms of
the outreach that they had planned
to do and couldn't
do because
of the pandemic
and
that restrictions that were in
place of the COVID on
this.
I can because look
at the footnote on the bottom of
209
David your
honor David would you
mute
please.
There it excuse
me madam chair I
will.
So I'm that
I'm Representative
Brown was in relation
said that
house bill 2
reversions
but I don't know and it's
LFC has any further
insight into how
they came to the
750 which is
reflected in that
table that you're referring
to.
I'll take a stab at that if you look
at page 209
members where these are listed
the bottom put no makes
the point that the
reversions on a cash
basis nonaccrual
basis so you're
speaking secretary Trujillo
to the year of the
appropriation was made
and that table is
the year the reversion
occurred which
sometimes happens after
and if you went back to the
prior year
FY 20 you may find
that if what we call of FY
21 reversion on a cash
basis then belonged
FY 20 so I just throw
that out and I think
Mr Shinya I can
work with your people and try to pin
it down to get the executive
total.
I think that would be good.
Yeah. Hearing
in November so
my one concern whatever
the numbers are just going
to go by the church here in this
book but
that reversion is
really pretty
pretty significant
and I understand the effect of the
pandemic and that
was true I think for just
about every state
agency except perhaps department
of transportation which seem
to our avoid the
hiring freeze and kept working
especially with maintenance projects
so I'm just you know if
if there's a lot of money and it
doesn't get spent
and we see a pattern
developing on that
that I would just urge some
caution in terms of
any expansion
spending
so.
I might just chime in real fast
on their look at I'm looking
at the audit right now and
I'm I'm showing it shows
565000
was reverted
from their from their budget
so that's that's what I
see
but you know we can always work
on that a little more and
it and
madam chair
members of the committee and Representative
brown I
of course I understand
your concern
and
caution but I
think that I would
appreciate the opportunity to
work with our colleagues at
LFC I'm
because
I
do not seeing
do not want to be held to a
standard of these reversions
that if you know they're not
accurate which might endanger
future funding to the
department for expansion
is you can appreciate and
see our
budget is very
small and with
respect to the general
fund
expenditures you and we do
everything we can to make sure
that we spend those down but I
look forward to working with LESC
to get some more accurate
numbers
2 okay
thank you madam chair thank you
everyone. You
are we have Harry Garcia
followed by Representative
Dixon.
Thank you madam chair a thank
you for your presentation
well one question that I have
is.
Why is there such a difference
between all of C. N. executive
there's a
54.7..
Funding.
But Representative
Garcia yeah I can take a stab
at that.
A big part of this
is.
The personnel costs so if
you look at the very
last page if
sheets.
Call then you'll
see the FY 22 foot
funded vacancies
117000.
That's about 11.3
but then on top of
that LFC added another
3.3 FTE
for FY 23 and you'll
see that
in column
I.
I would just say that you
know that's for it an
agency that has 17
FTE that's a
pretty substantial
increase in FTE that
27 percent increase
in FTE.
And so we from
the LESC perspective it was
a
you know that was that was a
reasonable
increase
I can't speak to why
the executive
went further
than that but that's
that's where we stand.
Thank you for that ensure a madam
chair it's just kinda
shop of the difference
between what another
I've been a in this
house for 6 years
and I've never seen that
much of a difference between one to
the other thank you
thank you madam chair.
Representative I mean
the Director
Abbey.
I I want to come back to
it so has bearing on
what you heard this
morning.
When the Medicaid
budget.
The executive used
more than 100000000 in non
recurring revenue to fund the
Medicaid.
The agency after agency
that could come in with
strong significant
increases even just this
you know this is a 10 percent
increase for Indian Affairs
without
compensation
when they get to 7 percent
compensation that's likely
coming about the executive and the
LESC LFC
rack that 10 percent
look for like 175016
or 17 percent which
is a strong recommendation
but not as strong as executive
head because they saved
money seemingly on the
Medicaid budget.
Go ahead your
next.
Madam chair and members of
the committee and
representative Garcia
I guess I just like to give my
perspective the
reason for the increase that I'm
requesting as a secretaries
because of the need that we
see in terms of
meeting the needs of our tribal
communities and providing that
service I appreciate
and understand
the fiscal nature
in terms of the of the LFC and
the legislature but
when I come to you
with this request
answer the executive it
has to do with the nature
of the work and the need
that we see and that's
the reason why we've made those
request for the
FTEs in the increase
to our budget so
I just wanted to say that
respectfully thank you madam
chair members one
other little one other
little piece I would it
add on this is
that. Like
I said at the beginning of this
that. The
executive actually went
above what they
HSD originally
requested.
And so LFC never
got a chance to
actually
review some of the stuff
as far as the suicide
prevention stuff like that that
might have you know had we had a chance
to review that it
might have been something that was what would
have been supported but
that didn't get included
do original request
so.
And can I
just try equipment and say
that you know
and
is correct and so
this was an increase
basically in executive
initiative to support
some additional needs at the
agency and
so that's why the
the addition is there.
Thank.
Clarification
wait. Let's
not do up he
said she said
thank about
about what agency got
what information
because of the relevant
information to me
is that there's a a
request there that needs
to be I think
considered and
the right now here
you have the floor followed by
Representative said
90.
Kerry.
Thank you madam chair just thanks
for the clarification that that
follow up with them
okay Representative
700.
Thank you madam chair
I was just going to ask I think
I'm not sure what areas but I
wanted to know
why.
I kept hearing this is the first time
LESC heard it so I don't know if you just
just or not I had to step out
but is that what he asked
yeah okay
his that's disturbing to
me and the other
one use
any might have just given up the
suicide prevention program
the ask about that
no you did
you think
you.
In W. right thank you madam chair
just I just want to know the difference
I think you might have I'm
why there was such a
difference.
Listen I mean
Secretary trio
were that
might be
David's but yet
I'm sorry go
ahead.
Who is going to.
The madam chair I
can
jump.
You know like like we just a second
ago it's it's a lot of it
is well some of it is that
we need to get to really review
this or or
just you know send you
said it was
executive initiative they
added above
you know the other thing is
like
David had mentioned a second ago
over director Avid admission a second
goes you know
thank there's $100000000
in HSD
and recurring costs
that they used
nonrecurring.
Revenue.
I to plug the budget so
you know in a lot of these different
agencies
you'll see that the executive
went well
above
the LFC but that's because they
had an extra 0 in there
to
to spend on these
things
you know and
that's that's something that's I
think it's probably gonna have to be handled
that you know at a different
time but that's
that's where we're
at.
Okay let
I'm sorry madam chair
and representative Cadena
and I think you might have missed
this in terms of my
response to that it
was well I
appreciate that in terms of
that fiscal nature of things
that my
budget request was made in
response to the needs that we scan
our tribal communities and wanting
to make that to to fill
that. Thank you
thank you madam chair thank
you Debbie anything else in my
apologies for skipping over
you.
Cool. The
next person on my list
is up Meredith
Dixon.
Thank you madam
chair
thank you
to Eric
and.
Cindy for
the the balance
sheets and secretary it's
very nice to see you thank you for
your presentation
it's really impressive the
work that your
department is doing
and so I commend your
leadership for
that
one.
Thing that I was interested
in and this might
be something that you can get back
to me on
is I
was pleased to see
that your department
has hired a
grants specialist
to really help you
leverage some of
those federal funds and
work
with
you know our our
tribes and pueblos
here in New Mexico to bring
more dollars back
and so I'd love to
to get a report
on how that's going
I don't know if you guys are tracking some
metrics but that's
certainly something that I would be very
interested
in.
Madam chair
Representative Dixon and members of the
committee Representative
Dixon will per provides you
with the report thank you for
noting that I
also want to take this opportunity
to thank all of you
because it was through your
support and your efforts that
we were able to obtain that
grant writer who has
been on boarded
they really provided
a tremendous amount of assistance
to me in terms of
tracking the
different
funding sources that are
available that we
can find we've created
a landing page on our
website to highlight
some of the funding sources
I'm working with our grant
writer as well as an additional
staff person
in terms of just what is economic
release look like how do we
engage tribes and
how do we get ready for
on all this funding
so that we can leverage resources
but I will follow up with you
Representative Dixon thank
you.
Thank you and
at madam chair
one as for the final
comment I think I
don't know that I need
to. An answer
from anyone on this but
I would just like to sort of
expressed some
frustration
and.
About the process
and how you
know.
I. I
really see value
in in what
requests have been
made with
the department but I am also
very concerned about
the administration
using you
know taking
$100000000
and making a
nonrecurring
which really creates
this imbalance and I feel
like puts us in a difficult
position of having to
you know really
cut things are not
increased to the levels
that perhaps they should
be and so I just wanted
to note
that frustration
that I had thank
you madam chair.
Thank you and I have a
I don't see any other folks so
I have a question
Eric the
the
issue of concern is the fact
that you did not get the
information
in a timely manner
to be able to
assess
your determination as the
LESC
of
evaluator is
that what it
is.
David you're on mute.
Respond to that.
Madam chair by by
statute
the executive budget
is due January
5.
Agency requests are
due last September 1
so LFC has hearings
all fall on the agency
requests so
when Mr shin
certainly the executive is
entitled to a trust
spending above the level
that came in in the executive director
request there's there's new
information priorities
change but
when there's a lot of
it it
leads to the situation
restriction is
describing that
January 5 was
of 6 days ago
3 to 4 business
days and so we're
seeing LFC
is saying for the first time
and members of LFC
or on HSD you're saying
these some requests
that were in the agency
requests for the first time 6
days ago again it's
not that.
You know legally they're entitled to
do that but it does create
challenges for the legislature
one things may not have gone
through the same vetting process
which is contemplated
by that September 1
admission.
I I appreciate that comment
David I think that it helps
everyone to get
information in a timely manner
so you can make educated
decisions
I guess what I'm looking at is
the requests for a very
small the
department you know for
a small
agency
it's not huge
not wasting
a heck of a lot of money they
but they and they need
they're saying that they need the
personnel in the
support systems in order to
address the concerns of
their of the native American
Community and
and I'm coming from the
aspect as you know
David Yazzie
Martinez said the
cultural issues that are in
critical and
the this to me
is a hugely important
department and I
guess I would say
that regardless
of the lack
of of timeliness
and submitting the information
that I would like for LFC
and the executive
to reconsider
their recommendations
because it isn't the
issue of money
and then we just talked about the
use conservation
money and it can be
reallocated or you you're
more they have
5000000 extra
dollars so
if she's only asking for 1000000
extra is that
correct. About
1000000 extra of
then then
it it it isn't a
money issue.
I would suggest and
submit that we
reconsider
what they're asking for
and the and try
to address it because it
isn't an issue about he said
she said you're out you're
both saying
that you
understand.
I was gonna say some terrible
S. H.
happens okay
it. The
step by step but
the point is that happened
and the now
let's move forward
and try to address the
concerns that really
exists there because I don't think
anybody is being
malicious or.
Has in the mail intent they
just want to funding to ensure
that the program moves forward
and David you know you're
going to hear from me and other people
about the issues of
cultural relevance and the
cultural importance
and I think this is a critical
component to what we're
doing and I hope that we can get it
done and I think
Representative Dixon and
Representative said and then
yet Representative
Garcia no
Representative the
issue of concern
as well because it's
significant they're
not asking for the world
and when we can have
use conservation
for whatever reason have
that much money in the budget
regardless of what they did
let's reallocate
it and give it to the
native American.
Our department Mr
Abbey just just
briefly we want to be
sure to distinguish between
non recurring and recurring
so the 5000000
there's a lot of nonrecurring
amid this point to the committee earlier
this week we have more nonrecurring
than recurrent so
yeah anyway I
think I think the
whether you appoint a subcommittee
R. S. department
to work with the LFC
staff to come back with the
approved recommendation we
have to do that.
And Mr Abbey I think that would be
the best thing I don't think we need
to do a subcommittee
I simply think that we need
for both of the organ
the entities to work
together.
Because I don't think they're out
of out of range
with the request my
personal opinion.
I'm. As
you know.
Representative Dixon is our
vice chair and she
has to
follow a process that we follow
regarding recommendations
secretary Trujillo
but you heard that we're
asking the
but the
agencies to work
together please so go ahead
Meredith. I
thank you madam chair
I would move
that the subcommittee
C. R.
recommends the LFC
budget and asking
that the
agency and
LESC work together
to present
an alternative proposal
for the full
committee.
We would assume here will
include to DFA in that
I'm sure you know
yes yes of the
of the people that are supposed to be
about.
And that there is a
motion and I need a second
from Phelps.
Okay.
Is there any opposition to
this motion.
Okay are you have a
recommendation
are David
add to W.
I mean secretary Trujillo thank
you for being here thank you all
very much in Eric
thank you for your work I know
that sometimes I.
I hope you in the wrong spot
but thank you for
all the you
madam chair members of the committee
look forward to working with you director
Avid and LESC and DFA
thank you for your time
thank you all.
This is you all
did a wonderful job
thanks to my co
chair thank you to all the
agency representatives
you are phenomenal and I'm
so pleased to work with you
and then the committee
you're awesome thank you all
very much and
we'll see within of the committee
tomorrow bye bye.
