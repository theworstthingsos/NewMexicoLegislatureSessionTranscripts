One,
The
Joe Simon who looks.
It's fun.
Have
Hello.
So we're 80s or something.
Um
44
Uh, yeah, that, that's, that's,
that's better. Well, well, maybe
not.
a.
How about there?
No
Still have the.
Do they?
I know we know we work out the
issues and the bigger.
You.
OK, OK. Thank, thank you, um.
Um
I, I'll say that when we were
going into uh the fall, I think
we expected that number, um,
that, that you all would
Consider to have appropriated to
address those targeted pay
increases to actually be bigger
than that $17 million figure,
but the last time we looked, so
many agents that they brought
themselves into the range as
informed by that SO study, but
some agencies have it and, and
again, we, we believe the gap to
be about, about 17 million and
that will be recurring.
Money on so on an ongoing basis,
which I think I just realized
was your question. I give a
really long answer and it could
have been shorter. I'm sorry.
Remind me your name. I'm sorry,
John Courtney. I'm deputy.
Thank
you, John.
Um, so our task today is to make
our recommendations are, but
we're not voting on anything
because we're sorry so
corrected, this is, this is
informational only. My
understanding is that the, the
task today is, you know, if you
want more information on
anything or want to discuss
something. I'm, I'm happy to, to
provide information if I have
it, if not, I'll, I'll dig in
and, and see if I can get it
back to you.
And the, the answer to, oh, it
was, I should wait for Rep Dixon
back in.
Just got the answer to the
question she asked.
Great. Thank you. Um, I just
want to name the 3rd and the
12th judicial.
Um, I, I think are important
adjustments to be making. And so
I just want.
That for the record.
Um
And
Yeah, I think that's it. Thank
you.
And another, I know another
topic of discussion among public
safety when you all heard DPS
was that concerned about
compensation and you, you
already acted on that. You, you
adopted the LFC wreck but then
took that executive piece of
one, I think it was about 1.61
million.
And, and put that, added that on
to DPS, so.
You're good there. And then Rep
Dixon, the answer to your, your
previous question about how many
647 employees.
So on some of these um.
The DA agencies we have um.
comment that some federal grants
are lapsing.
Uh, and that's predictable, I
would assume that we know what
that. Can you?
OK, is this a problem that we
have very often?
Um
It's
It can be, um, part of the
difficulty around some of these
smaller federal grants such as
is there's somewhat
unpredictable.
And so you'll, you'll hear
agencies and I can't remember
the agency that came in. It
might have been CBRC.
Um, you know, we hear the same
thing from them every year. We
You might be losing
Uh
Access to some of, some of our
federal grants.
Um, in my experience over the
last
14 years I've worked for LFC
much of the time.
That, that doesn't necessarily
pan out and, and those grants do
materialize, but um I
I wouldn't venture to, to make a
guess this, this year given kind
of the
The current
Yeah, I think that's everybody's
so with federal grants.
Um
I'm sure, I'm sorry, I should
have been.
Uh
Falling decorum.
OK, OK, sorry. Um.
So, uh, Representative Brown,
the, I think it depends on the
grant, you know, what we found
out when, when there was kind of
that.
There was a bit of a scare. I
can't remember if it was last
week or the week before.
When there was um some news out
of Washington about the
potential freezing of federal
grants.
And we are hearing from
agencies, I guess as a
coincidence, the same day, all
of the federal billings were
inaccessible. Um,
That'll, you know, for, for some
grants, some grants are awarded
on a 1/12 basis, so every month.
They're coming in, some um are
more infrequent kind of
tranches. Um, I, I will say
that.
You know, one thing that you all
have as a.
Almost a tool and agencies have
a tool in their back pocket is,
you know.
If, if there is a concern about
the possibility of federal
grants going away, and that in
fact does materialize through
year, um.
Agencies do have
Fiscal year I've noticed.
A lot of,
I guess that's why I would say
today that.
It would be nice if we had a
glance.
And know where all the funding's
coming from and like probably a
monumental. It, it might be the,
you know, we, we'll go back and
take a look at that.
Uh, and I, I know with the um
with some of the federal grants
for, for the section 7 for the
IT funding.
You know, that those work
differently as well, like for
the, for the big project we were
talking about with MMIS.
Um
They have to, they have to go in
and have a.
Basically have a work plan
approved that has their federal
match rate.
And then that, that money,
different phases of the project.
Um
You know, and to that point, if,
if something should change
during the project, like I, I
worked at CYFD years ago.
And um worked with some of the
IT folks there and, and one of
the concerns was, you know, if,
if we get ahead of our skis on
what the federal government has
approved, they could not only
come back and say you don't get
the future money, but we're
gonna recoup some of the some of
the money that you spent because
you didn't tell us. And sorry
for monopolizing here.
I'm gonna renew my request that
staff put together an index of
the sections too.
I mean, I kind of know what it
is, you know, section one cover,
you know, it's.
title or whatever and you know,
Section 8 is this and that and
just give us just a little half
sheet that explains all the
components, try to connect the
dots.
I kind of know where to look. I
absolutely Representative Brown.
I've, I've got that, I've got
that on my computer because I
keep it to write the FIR every
year. So I, we can certainly
provide that to you.
Um
I apologize that I needed to
step out. Um,
The, and with regard to the 647.
Um, judicial employees, um,
And I, I don't actually have any
um additional thoughts on the
district attorney, um,
components.
Um, but for the judicial.
You know, I wonder if.
Something that we could look at
is
Doing
50%.
This budget and 50% next budget
to bring them up.
Um
You know,
Certainly the way for me to look
at it is when we talk about
public safety.
And, you know, having a big
package to address public
safety. I think that this is
part of it because the judicial
branch, you know, we need good
folks in every agency that's a
part of the judicial system, um,
you know, do.
Doing all of that, um, as a
recurring expenses.
A substantial chunk out of the
Available recurring funds. Um,
however, maybe if we phased it
in.
That would be a possibility
that's um.
That's certainly a possibility
and, and I'll, I'll say another
strategy I've seen over the
years.
I, you know, you all could.
But also consider doing.
Half of that half.
The house and then asking the
Senate to pick up the other
half. You guys are.
Each side is constrained by the
amount that's that's left after,
after you adopt the
The lower budget which in most
cases in LFC, which is usually
just a reminder about
um.
You know, having the Senate
pick, pick part of that up and,
and for, um, our newer members,
you know, sort of the way that
it works is right after the LFC
after we adopt all of the agency
recommended, you know, LFC, and
we kind of total it up and then
there's usually a bit of a
split.
Um, of the available recurring
money, um, you know, that needs
to be played with and you know,
this is to work with. And yeah,
that's a good point. I mean, we
don't.
We can split the.
The work evenly.
So thank you. To your point,
Madam Chair, you know, to
To to Charles's point from
earlier, kind of trying to stay
around that 6% threshold to
avoid.
A dip in and needing to.
The grow budgets only by the,
the, the gap between where you
are now and
It's not, it's not a lot there.
The question and so, but let's
say if we go with the scenario
50% this budget, 50% the next
budget.
Is there a risk that the highest
paid folks in the judicial might
raise their pay and then.
Instead of bumping it 50%, then
it turns into 60% or whatever.
Uh, representative so, that's,
that's a good question. We
We could work on some language,
Joey would work on that language
to try to put some, put some
guardrails around that funding
to specify that it's to be used
for for that lower tier.
Um
Which, which hopefully would.
Yeah, cause I don't want us to
be in the same place that.
Um, vice chair mentioned of like
we can't just, we can't catch up
to um the salaries.
I, I can also ask Julie to, to
go back and sharpen his pencil
on that number. This was kind of
a.
You know, we knew it would come
up and so.
Talking with him at 7 or 8 last
night. So that, that number
might might shift a bit, but
That's my
The middle third was about, uh,
was, was pretty much at parity
with the executive branch. It
was within a few 10 of a percent
and I and then the top third was
about 8%.
So, you know, it's not that the
It's not the
You all have an appropriated the
funding for that to happen. It's
just the distribution of that
funding is, and, and that could,
you know, it could be other
factors at play. It could be
there could turnover, there
could be other things going,
well, we're gonna give these
folks 8%.
Mhm
We're trying to bring up right
um and then if you want with the
scenario where it's 50/50, 50%,
50% this year, 50% next year.
How are you going to determine
who gets that percentage are
you're gonna just apply 1% to it
all.
Or the 50%, honey, how are you
breaking that apart? I, I think
there again, um, you know.
Analyst in charge of
compensation package can put
some language.
In there that specifies, you
know, this, this tranche of
money is to be used for these
purposes to these employees.
Um, and my understanding is that
it would be, you know, if, if
it's, if it goes, as you all
mentioned, you know, it
Quick thinking would be.
Um, to specify that.
Um
Approximately 1.4 million would
be used to provide a 2% targeted
pay increase above the 4% that's
already included in Section 8.
For those lowest tier 3rd tier.
It would be. Thank you. It, it
would be 7, it would be 700,000
this year, correct.
Correct.
Mhm
And then of the 5th half of
that, and then expect the Senate
to the other half. Correct.
So you all could do um.
What did you say?
700, so, so 350.
Um
And you know, could even include
language, say 350 for 1% with
the idea that
Um, the Senate could do another
35?
Types of employees could be, you
know, we.
Oh
Lowest tier of reason I ask is
because there's a lot of that's
been proposed in various pots.
And
Some of it may.
Are we just recording this
internally or is um
Um
You know, and so,
One of the things that I've been
concerned about with these
various pots of money going to
different things is that
there's.
There is a lot of overlap.
You know, and so,
I just wonder if maybe we could
also.
As we're looking at
Doing this increase, if we could
just check to see if there are
other proposed pots of money
that potentially would overlap
with this, so we're not
You know,
We could use other funds that
have already been identified or
something. As a matter of fact,
represented Dick and I'm working
on this overlaps, so I think
that, um, as I'm looking through
those.
interposed.
Options. Um, we're looking at
seeing where we could uh
increase the employees.
Are these gonna be performance
based, you know, if it's just
across the board. My
understanding is it would be.
Thank you. Mhm.
I would say I'd rather
I would say I'd
get. So if we can't deliver on
there.
Um, the, on the Deloitte study.
What if the numbers are
Far out of whack with what we're
looking.
What
Mhm
Uh, Representative Brown, my, my
understanding is that it, it
We, we know pretty well it it
should be around 17 million. The
the numbers are in.
On, on that part.
And then, um, to, to answer your
question, the, the employees are
largely
Custodian's bailiffs court
security officers.
Um, and judicial special.
Question.
So our counties are required to
provide this space.
How does that break down with
counties, they're just providing
raw space or are they providing
personnel as that's a, that's a
great question. Um, it, it
largely depends on the count.
Um
Like, for example, I know that
Berlio County.
Um, does provide some and and
from what I know, that's kind of
the largest category of 2 and
he's pitching into the space.
Um, I believe in some cases.
Uh, counties are providing
security as well.
Um, but I think in some cases.
What I'm getting at is these
county.
personnel may not, that would be
correct. this would.
Yeah.
There, there are some other,
some other mechanisms in the
budget that indirectly provide
funding.
Two counties for staffing, like,
like for example, there was a
tranche of money all
appropriated.
I want to say it was last year
or the year before for um
Corrections personnel,
supervision personnel within 2
cents.
I did, I, I sometimes I've used,
I kind of default to using
Burley County as an example.
The biggest and they got a bunch
of that money, a couple million
dollars.
I concur.
of promising something that we
can't deliver, you know, if you
guys can get us the options.
You, I mean, I know we're not
voting on anything right now. So
you'll look at stuff and provide
us with
The information, agree with you.
I absolutely, we'll I'll go back
and um as I said, I'll ask Joey
to get me a firm, a firm number
on that.
Um, you know, we can also do a.
rough estimate of, of
What a, if you all decided,
well, let's, let's put a pin in
that and do a staffing study and
fully address it next year, we
can get you an estimate on the
Based on the
Yeah, uh, yes, ma'am. Sure, the,
um, I was explaining the, the
largest kind of
Jump up there was for the 3rd,
but that was because they, they
had requested a flat budget.
The, the remainder um LFC and
DFA staff worked together and
came to
Just say, I, I just have one
sheet tell me if I need to catch
up.
All right, so we're, we're good
then.
uh Rep Dix and I'll, I'll, uh,
I'll go back and, um, so what,
what I have from you all is, um,
Uh
Provide an index of the sections
that comprise House Bill 2 for
informational purposes.
Um
Get a u sharpness pencil and
what that number to do the 4%
for the lowest tier of court
employees.
would cost
Um
And then we'll go from there.
I'm sorry, a, a potential
estimate of what uh
Star uh
Study would cost for the uh
judicial.
Branch, um, similar to the
Deloitte study we've dropped in
that we get a number for you
all.
And then, um,
Let's see other public safety
catch up cleanup.
Uh, or is this it?
Oh, please.
Um
Yeah.
So, um, Representative Silva,
John and our staff are gonna
come back, uh, Deputy Courtney
and I are gonna come back.
uh, Deputy Doctor Courtney and I
are gonna come back with, um,
some of this feedback for you
all to consider. Uh, you all
took care of DPS in the hearing.
The only other big flag I have
for public safety was the public
defender department and we're
still working through some of
what was flagged there. It looks
like it'll be contract
attorneys, um, that was the
biggest thing that was flagged.
And some of that rural
recruitment stuff. So we'll at
least have one more meeting to
talk about those two things.
OK, thank you. And then the
issues that were brought up.
I can't remember what day about
the courts and like court safety
for some of the judicial
districts that
That got taken care of.
Yes, Representative Silva,
that's a good question. Um,
this, this is a little tough
because we have so many
different sections of the bill.
So a lot of that public safety
court security stuff is in
section 5, the specials and
supplementals, which we still
haven't adopted yet. So we have
another opportunity to come, but
if it's, if it's a concern in
this
Yeah, I think that might be
important. Um, and thank you
just like to the connecting the
dots. It's like, wait, where did
this live and where did that
live and OK, thank you. Yeah.
Kind of the, the rule of thumb
is if, if it's recurring funding
it if it's non-recurring
funding, it's a special 6 is
supplementals and then the, the,
the further sections, they kind
of
But I'll, I'll get you all that.
That would be excellent. I'd
love to see the sections and
their descriptions. Thank you.
It only took me 14 years to
figure out I needed to ask for
that.
Um, I do have one other, since
we're talking Department of
Public Safety, just briefly.
There is a project here. It's
on, it's section 7. I'm just
gonna flag it now. It's line 26.
The executives asking for 3
million policing project.
And I'm assuming that is AI. I,
I don't know differently, but
that's my guess.
Um, LFC is um willing to go 2
million.
Um, I wonder if this isn't a
linchpin for our
Safety
And then
Uh, Representative Brown that.
Both Emily and I
Project certification committee,
which is kind of the over that.
I'll, I'll say that the DPS
projects have
I've been moving along well.
that particular project.
Um, this, the, the phase two.
And so from, from what, from
what I know on it.
Um, the
wrapping up phase one.
Now they, they had a phase two
proposal.
Um, some of the discussion.
There was
There were some
Members from do it on the, on
the PCC they were a bit
concerned that that these two.
But I also say that's kind of
how these are into balloon both
in terms of scope and costs. I
mean you started.
Years and years
Um, and, uh, just did a little
bit policing. um, and doesn't
Look like AI specifically, but,
um using technology.
Um, data collection and
analytics.
to help drive.
There's a lot more.
I'm sorry. I should have
described it. The, yeah, the
intelligence led policing, you
know.
It's, um, it's, it's a project
at DPS.
But it, it should have a lot of
the
Lot of capabilities that will be
for um.
Be able to be utilized by um I
don't know if you, you've all
been able to visit the.
The real-time crime center in
Albuquerque where they kind of
have.
Real-time analytics mapping.
You know, they, they have the
ability to even do predictive
analytics to say.
Um, you know, based on the last
two weeks.
Um, you tell your area area
commander that they should
concentrate at least presence in
this area at this time.
Um, because that's the end um.
Eventually
prevent that or, or at least uh
address what's happening in a
swift and certain way which is
And so, um, this, this system
should, should
have those capabilities.
A little bit of, um, I guess to
add into that conversation.
I know like in the city of
Farmington, we have um live like
um cameras that law enforcement
monitor, um,
I know other jurisdictions,
municipalities are rolling out
with live feed of of of uh of uh
high traffic, high population
areas. This, the state police
have access to those live feeds?
Is that something that um um I'm
just looking to see like if, if
that's even something that's
this Mexico State police, uh,
uh, helps um with their work.
That's a, that's a great
question. I, I can, I can go
back and, and find out if.
If they do have access to live
feeds. I know that um.
Um
That that's
That's something that a number
of years ago there was a.
in trip
A number of members
Um, current E G role tours
they're um
And the crime strategies unit,
San Francisco.
DA's office and exactly as you
said, they, they had um
You know, they, they went out
and actively worked with
businesses to, to get access to
those live feeds and it was part
of
You know, kind of that larger,
larger strategy to do network
analysis. I know that the 2nd DA
has worked to
You all provided funding for,
for a similar crime strategies,
um.
So that, that capability has
been
Built in.
2nd DA and go back and check
with DPS to see if they have a
similar cap. I, I would assume
that they do to some degree in
intelligence led policing, but I
don't want to say for certain
until I, until I know. So I'll
get an answer on that for you.
Great. Thanks, everybody. So
I'll, I'll, I'll work on this
info and get.
Probably get you information
back on, on Monday.
Great.
Thank you.
