Here.
Excellent. Okay, uh, members.
It's great to see everybody. Um,
we're gonna do a couple of quick
things first. We can in
consultation with the sponsor.
It's already it will be funded
in the Senate and so house Bill
90. We can have a motion to
table.
But congratulations to the work
and the dedication of funding
for that.
Mr Speaker. I move to table
House Bill 90. There's emotions
their 2nd 2nd vibrance Cruz.
Even though we don't need the
second and
Is there any opposition to that
motion?
Saying that
That's tabled members. I'd also
like to go. We're going to
switch up the order a bit. We
have a number of folks here for
house Bill 303. So I'd like I
have this We have the sponsor
here represents Serato. Um,
couple other quick things. We're
gonna limit, uh, public comment
and really quick if everybody
could pay attention, really
quick.
Sorry. This microphone's because
of our short timeline and our
need to get back down to the
floor for third reading. We're
gonna limit public comment to
six minutes per bill, ideally at
five, so I just want to announce
that ahead of time. Um and also
on house Bill 303.
We? I believe we have
translation equipment with us
here that we can utilize.
Ah, okay, represents Cerrato.
If you wouldn't mind explaining
your bill briefly, then we'll go
to the amendment and we can
proceed from there, please.
Thank you, Mr Chairman me one
moment to find mail.
Thank you, Mr Chair. So with me
today, I have Amber Wallen with
a higher end department. And I
have Marcella with it's almost
as almost as well. Give me one
second.
Sorry about that. Mr Charles,
explaining the microphones and
their sensitivity to my my
expert, So they know, um so hb
303 would create a, um
A pilot program within the adult
education division of New Mexico
is higher Education Department
to provide economic support
through monitored recurring
monetary stipends to low income
workers enrolled in certain time
bound workforce training
programs. So as we know that
we're near full employment in
New Mexico and we need to be
training the workforce
That we are asking businesses to
come to fill those jobs. Um, we
have been working with various
different groups. And so
actually, some of the things I'd
like to talk about or in the
amendment. If I can move the
amendment fixes some of the
other questions your episode.
Serato, Can you read out the 202
or 2 to 8 number? Thank you, Mr
Chair. It's 2 to 8 to 81.1.
Okay, That's what we have. Can
we have a motion and a second
for discussion?
So moved
Guys. We moved by Vice chair
Dixon seconded by representative
like Cruz for discussion. Please
explain the amendment. Thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank you.
Committee. So, um, in
consultation with H E, D and
hcia, the Healthcare authority,
Okay.
H c. A healthcare authority?
Yes, sorry it used to be HST,
The healthcare authority. Um we
were looking at the funding that
we funding source that would
make sense for this and also
ensuring that this would be an
effective program. So what the
amendment does is it removes the
funding from Tan, if which they
felt was a better idea. It also
removes apprenticeships, which
are too long for the types of
programming we're looking for.
We're really looking for those
shorter certificate
certification programs in the
high need highly desired
industries that were interested
in
You'll also see that it removes
it from being a five year pilot
to a three year pilot. That way,
We're expanding the money,
mostly on the those utilizing
the pilot program. Um and then
finally, it also adds, removes
the amendment or sorry. The
appropriation as often happens
here.
We adjusted as you can see
online online seven or Amendment
seven that we change the
deadline for HDD to promulgate
rules for this and and to to
develop the program to April,
2025 in line with what their
concerns were. And finally, um
we, um we added a reporting
mechanism so that we can learn
the results of the pilot
program.
So what? With the amendment.
What this becomes is a three
year pilot program where we are
allowing monetary stipends to
those who are getting trained in
these short courses, which are
more like six weeks to three
months so that they have the
economic security to pursue
these degrees. That we are these
certifications that we need them
to be pursuing. Um, weird.
There's evidence that shows when
people have this kind of
economic security to take care
of
Um of housing shortages or
childcare, or the myriad of
reasons that get in your way
from getting the education you
need. They do perform better in
these courses, and this pilot
program is intended to test that
theory. And the reporting back
will be important. One of the
things that's also in the bill
Overall, just to be clear is
that H e D will be working very
closely with H C. A that run
similar programs so that they
can work with each other to
really ensure that they're
targeting correctly.
Um, with that, um, without all
stand for questions.
Thank you very much for Serato.
Great to see him as well in
great to see you, Miss Lee as
are their questions on the
amendment.
Uh, I'm gonna ask just a couple
of quick clarifying questions
represents Serato. So this money
isn't hb two going to the higher
education Department. Your
amendment essentially utilizes
those funds. Correct. Mr.
Chairman. Yes, that's correct.
It's for the integrated
education training. Um, that you
all worked on out of this
chamber or this, Uh, committee
and in consultation with HDD,
they felt that they would be
able to use this funding for
this purpose.
Thank thank you for that.
clarification. Our core
question. Is it in the budget
and where you answer both of
those?
Thank you, representative and
Miss Wall in this is done in
closely coordinated with HDD and
with you in which is sort of
the, uh, stamp of approval, as
you will, or if you will.
Yes, Mr Chair. It's definitely a
stamp of approval. OK? Great.
Thank you both for that.
Any other questions on the
amendment.
Any opposition to adopting house
Appropriations and Finance

the House Bill 303.

We've adopted the amendment. Uh,
any additional thing to add, or
we'll just go straight to public
comment.
I think we stand for questions.
Thank you. Thanks very much.
Okay. For those who wish to
speak on house Bill 303 as
amended, if, um, if you wouldn't
mind coming lining up in the
middle of the room, please.
Ah!
And give us just a second. We're
gonna get our equipment.

Okay, uh, will now go to

Represent Montoya, please.
Then we represent Montoya. Then
I'm suffering representing Toya.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Representative.
Um
Very interested in this program.
It's very similar to a piece of
legislation that myself and
Representative Brown dropped for
I was calling it a second
chance.
To go back to school and
And
Be able to get a certificate.
Or something like that. Just job
training for folks who maybe
Had graduated.
Out of high school.
But had gone straight into the
workforce and then
Realized by doing that limited
opportunity, so a lot of the
programs that are listed in 303
are the very same.
Um
Programs that that included in
our in our legislation.
Um, Mr Chairman and
representative.
I guess the question I have
here Is it states in here that a
couple of things one is that it?
Immigration status is not a pre
Is not an issue.
So would this apply as well to
Everyone who's who spoke in
favor of this obviously spoke
In Spanish and it is an
immigrant, but this would not
Keep
Folks who met this criteria
otherwise to be able to apply
for this. Is that correct? Thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative. Yes, any anyone
any new Mexican resident could
be couldn't fit into this. If
they're in the certification
programs identified by H E D
Folks who met this criteria
otherwise to be able to apply
for this. Is that correct? Thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative. Yes. Any anyone
any new Mexican resident could
be couldn't fit into this if
they're in the certification
programs identified by HDD Yes.
So, um, I'm looking at several
of these Mr Chair.
Several of these, um
Programs.
And some of these seem to be
Longer than a certificate
program. Is that correct?
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative. We wanted to
give HDD the flexibility to
apply it where the need fit.
We've really focused on the
well. The industries we
identified. We focused on the
strategic economic the economic
Strategic plan the governor laid
out a few years ago. Um, and
many of those are actually
certification programs that you
can get from a number of those
industries.
But we did want to give that
flexibility overall.
So thank you, Mr Chairman and
representative Cerrato.
Um, I'm not seeing in here, um,
a limit as to what the stipend
would be. And maybe you could
point me to that. I'm
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative again. We wanted
the flexibility depending on the
region where people lived in and
and the expertise of H C. A to
fill in some of those those
details. The objective here,
though, is to have assist as
many individuals as possible and
is effective manner as possible.
And so we did want to give that
flexibility so they could adjust
it, um, as necessary.
So I'm a little uncomfortable
with
That's pretty open ended.
So it doesn't state that there
would be a limit of
$3000 a month $4000 a month
$2000 a month. It's It's really
wide open. It seems like they
would at least be an upper end.
To that, Um
And and I did. I worked through
that.
With the bill that that myself
and representative Brown
Introduced
With
Some level of an upper end.
Knowing
For For most folks, there is
General things to consider.
Um, such as rent or
Utilities and
And food. It does seem like we
could put some sort of a
A an upper end limit. But what
is the percentage or what? What
would this keep?
Someone who applies for this
from being able to get
Uh um, a lottery scholarship or
A opportunity scholarship to pay
for education.
I thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you, Representative. So as as
you all know, far better than I
do. Um, uh, for credit programs
are do have lottery scholarship
that pays for, um, you know,
obviously the tuition and
associated needs as well. And
obviously all of you put in
significantly for career and
technical education as well. And
that pays for that the tuition
aspect of it.
But this is really tailored
towards are the non Crittenton
credit programs that are not
opportunity Scholarship. Um uh
okay, applicable, And so this is
really focusing on those
instead, I'd like to, um, Mr
Chair Representative. I'd like
to mention also that
That adult education students?
um, not having a high school
equivalency yet are generally
not, um, eligible for the
opportunity scholarship or the
lottery scholarship. So for that
reason, this fills a gap that
had been missing for adult
education. Students for basic
needs work that Hee Hee D is
doing across the board.
Um I T is integrated education
and training is a adult
education specific model with
national effectiveness, And
that's the this This. This would
be the population that we're
Um I T is integrated education
and training is a adult
education specific model with
national effectiveness, And
that's the this This. This would
be the population that were
serving with HB 303.
So thank you, Mr Chair and
represents Serato at there are a
number of, uh
Folks who gone to school maybe
dropped out as well. That
That that would be an issue. Um,
with this cover.
Um
Someone getting
A GED.
Because the other thing that I
don't see in here is a
requirement that if
The person who applies for this
Has
The ability to apply for
The lottery scholarship or the
opportunity scholarship.
That
There. I would think there would
need to be some requirement if
they if they qualify for that.
To them.
Use those for that purpose and
Allow this fund to be
distributed.
Maybe if not at such a large
Potential draw down by by one
individual.
Um
Mr Chair, Representative, Um
All of our adult education
students, um, are federally
defined as having a basic skills
deficiency, so they either lack
the G e d or high set other. In
other words, the high school
equivalency or they lack English
language proficiency skills up
to a level that would help them
be successful in the workplace.
So, um, since this applies only
to adult education students,
everyone would lack one of those
to, um, you know, skills
indicators. Basically, I'm also
thinking in in answer to your
last question. Uh,
We don't um
Well, you know, I think what the
legislation provides for is for
HDD to take a number of months
to develop the parameters and
the rules for this program, And
I think that the limits that
you're discussing and the time
limits that you're suggesting
would be included in that
process as well.
Okay in public, including
analysis of, um you know,
situations in the different
regions of the state. Thank you.
Mr Chair. One last question.
Um, there was several of the, uh
Several of folks who spoke
In favor.
Of this legislation.
Mentioned childcare as a as a
need.
Is that paint covered in this or
or if they qualify for
Childcare health help otherwise.
I just want to make sure that
we're not paying twice for the
same thing. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you, President. I have the
same readiness reticence when I
was working on this, Um
This allows for childcare to be
for use this type stipend for
childcare as well, particularly
because a lot of these courses
may not be when people when
childcare is open. So, for
example, living in Santa Fe,
most of the childcare I know
exist from seven AM until five
PM and I don't really know a lot
that exists outside of that
realm. But if you're taking a
course at Santa Fe Community
College, there are a number of
them that are offered after five
PM or at the higher, ed. Um,
education facility campus we
have here.
Those are a lot of those after
five PM, so it would still allow
for them to pay for a babysitter
or pay for those that can help
them take care of their kids.
So, Mr Chair and representative,
I do like the legislation. I am
concerned.
I don't like things that are not
defined. It's things that are
just that open ended and then
We go ahead and say to the
department that we're going to
give you this money, you figure
out how to spend it.
I really don't like that. That
that is too big of a leap for
me. In most instances,
Um And and Mr Chair and
representative, I think
represented Serato. You've
presented a lot of legislation
in your short time in the
Legislature. Many of those I
would have supported
With more definition.
I just I have a hard time
supporting something that is
just
Just this wide open, So thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative Montoya. Next
we're gonna represent Herndon,
please.
Thank you, Mr Chair and Madam
Presenter. I just have three
questions, and the first one is
with respect to the
apprenticeship programs, so your
amendment took them out. And I'm
really couldn't worried about
that, because if they if anyone
goes into an apprenticeship
program, there's another
mechanism for them receiving
payment. So were you asked to
remove it by Workforce
Solutions or why did you take
that out?
Thank you, Mr Chairman, and if
either of my experts want to
contribute on this as well, um
I'm happy to have their input.
But the that was a big part of
the discussion and part of it
was in consideration, too.
You know, we have this for three
years, and this is a million
dollar requests over that time.
The F I R came back, saying that
each year they needed FTE for
about 150,000 per year. That's
about 450 out the door already,
Which leaves the program with
about 5 555 $150,000 to work
with to implement these these,
um these statements
The concern with the
apprenticeship programs is that
they are a bit too long, and
we're we're really trying to.
From my perspective we're trying
to do is get as many people
certified in key industries as
possible as quickly as possible.
I don't know if either of my
experts would like to contribute
to that as well.
Mr Chair, Representative. We
also, um see, I e t. In fact I
e. T s serves as a gateway into
apprenticeship for folks who
don't yet have their high school
equivalency or don't have the
English language skills that
allow that so in many states and
also in this state, there are I
T programs, integrated education
and training programs that serve
as essentially pre
apprenticeship programs.
And we prepare people with the
skills and with the educational
certification to then move into
registered apprenticeship. Most
registered apprenticeships,
Actually, we require a high
school equivalency.
All right. Thank you very much,
And I did hear Mr Chair and
presenters that you wanted this
to be a certificate program
short a period of time. My
concern is that when I listened
to the people who spoke today,
some spoke to wanted to go into
nursing someone at the college
degree. Those are not
certificate programs with the
short period.
So how will you be selecting
these individuals? Are you going
to tell them? You can't come in
this program because you want a
higher degree of it.
Of education and learning.
Mr Chair, representative.
integrated education and
training programs If I may just
briefly, um this national model
is has a three required
components number One is the
academic preparation, so they
preparation toward the GED or
the high set. The second thing
is Workforce preparation
training. So, um, resume
building interview skills, and
the third is simultaneous and
contextualized workforce
training.
So, for example, we have I e T
programs around the around the
state already that prepare
people for certification. For
example, certified nursing
assistant So it's Santa Fe
Community College. You can be an
adult education student earning
your high school diploma,
improving your English language
skills and simultaneously taking
the classes that you need at the
community College.
To prepare you for the
certification exam, And in fact,
we had a cohort at Santa Fe
Community College, just test for
and earn their Sienna
certification here in December,
so it is a model we've been
using for entry level
healthcare, frontline healthcare
positions as well as
multicultural childcare,
education and a number of other
high need industries. So those
things it may not take six
months, people might be in
courses for a year.
Um, but this would be able to
support them into those types of
industry recognized
certificates.
And Mr Terror and presenters.
Just one last question. With
respect to those who will be
applying to be in this program.
I understand it. The funding is
under higher education.
Who's gonna be reviewing the
applications in determining who
gets into the program and our
please just briefly explain what
that is because that's a little
bit confusing.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative. So we really are
having HDD work hand in hand
with H H C. A the benefit of
starting with the 10. If model
is that we learned a lot right
off the bat. How much is
involved in that process, and so
HD can provide a lot of that
technical assistance in in in
the application process and
working directly with HD, and
there I E T program to really
highlight what certification
programs or that would fit.
I think that answers your
question. Fiona Headboard.
That's that's fine, Madam
Presenter. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you very much present.
Herndon represent Garrett,
please. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you for bringing this just
two points that, uh, number
three. The department may use
money appropriated to the
department of Pilot and evaluate
great.
I think it's this is a
foundation for so much. My only
other question is that it would
seem that
Uh, the reporting should be to
lfc, not L. E S. C because Alias
C
It doesn't deal with college
programs beyond the teacher prep
area, So just
Something to look at.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative. That's a That's
an excellent note. Um and I'm
happy to talk with you further
about that. Thank you.
Thank you were upset Garrett.
Okay. I don't see any other
questions.
We'll go for a motion. Thank
you, Mr Chair, I would move a do
pass for house Bill 303 as
amended.
Okay, There's a motion to do
pass in a second is their
opposition to that motion.
Okay, uh, we'll show represent
Pettigrew represent Montoya in
opposition. Please send Montoya
to explain. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um, I would like to work with
the sponsor of line. I would
like to see if there's a couple
of guardrails. I would love to
be able to support this on the
house floor.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative. Thank you very
much for someone to thank you,
representative.
Oh, and represented a group,
Please to explain also, Thank
you, Mr Chair, and I do
appreciate the legislation. I
think there's some conflicts
between the F I. R and the
agency analysis and built
I'm not sure.
How I really feel about the
conflicts.
We're going to be interested to
hear what the the how we deal
with this on the House floor.
But
My my No vote is because of the
conflicts right now.
Excellent. Thank you Represent,
uh, represent represent brown,
please.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
Representative, so I voted for
the bill, but we just had a very
long Mr Chair. Very long
discussion on the house floor
about another bill that didn't
have enough.
Accountability criteria
reporting and all those things
in it.
I went ahead and voted for this,
And I also would like to see Mr
Chair representative that we
fine tune this.
So, um
We have a better grasp of how
successful it will be. And I
understand this is a five year
time span on this bill.
But we do need to have data
required as we go along, so we
can thank you. Thank you
Represent Brown. Thank you
Represent you all
Okay, members. We're gonna go.
Uh, well, briefly on HB 269 is
amended again. We can take the
emotion and table this, but I
wanted to kudos types of
Chatfield Center. Woods and
others who have worked to
address this. We understand that
this is in the work coming back
from the Senate, So I do have a
motion to table house Bill 269
is amended.
Okay. It's been moved by
represented Chatfield second by
ranking member Armstrong. Any
opposition to that seeing none
and congratulations. Okay, we're
gonna ask representative Dixon
on
House. Uh,
House Bill night.
And members were going to hand
out the committee substitute.
We'll get that handed out. Asked
for a motion and a second to
adopt it for discussion.
And, uh,
Then go along.
Okay?
Ah, excellent. We've got those.
okay. Represented Dixon, please
on. Okay, first. Can I ask for a
motion for discussion on house
Appropriations and Finance
Committee substitute for House
commerce, Moved. Economic
development Committee subsidy.
Hospital nines move move, saying
by representative Montoya
Okay. Uh, no opposition there.
Sam Dickson. Great to see you.
Please go, Madam Vice chair.
Please go ahead.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Do you want
me to explain the substitution?
Or should I provide an overview
of the bill? And then please
provide an overview of the bill?
You can now explain the
substitution after that, Okay.
take the time that you need.
Okay, Wonderful.
So good afternoon, Mr Chair and
members of the committee
Normally I like to have a very
brief introduction when
presenting legislation, but this
afternoon, I wanted to provide a
little bit of context for the
bill. So I hope you'll bear with
me for just a few minutes.
So
The intensifying climate crisis.
Driven by carbon dioxide
emissions. Who's his enormous
risks to economies, ecosystems
and communities if left
unchecked.
The world has already warmed 1.1
°C above pre industrial
averages.
Climate, scientists warn. We
must halt warming below 1.5
degrees.
To avert catastrophic climate
change reactions.
To have even a 50% chance of
staying below 1.5.
Global carbon dioxide emissions
must fall by half.
By 2030 Reach net zero by 2050.
Technology is offering
revolutionary new ways to de
carbonized our energy systems
industries, buildings and
transportation are emerging.
And if we mobilize the resources
to support their development and
uptake
Meeting the pace and scale of
emission reductions for 1.5 °C
alignment requires increasing
funding for fold into emerging
decarbonization innovation,
according to expert analysis.
Renewable energy sources like
wind, solar, geothermal and
hydropower.
However.
Cannot solve the climate crisis
alone.
While rapidly scaling renewables
is absolutely essential.
For reaching net zero emissions
Several realities just
demonstrate other
decarbonization solutions must
complement their growth.
Number one.
Hard to do carbonized sectors.
Heavy industry, heavy transport,
aviation, agriculture and high
temperature. Heat processes
cannot run directly on
renewables and lacks straight
forward path to electrification
with current technology.
Number two intermittent see?
Renewables. Variable output
requires either extensive over
building of generation capacity
or truly massive amounts of
grids. Grid scale storage
worldwide to overcome
intermittent see issues.
Feasibility and resource
constraints posed challenges.
Number three.
Energy density.
Renewables require vastly more
land area than traditional power
plants per unit. Energy produced
Total global land usage could
preclude fully displacing fossil
fuel dependence.
And number four transition
timelines.
Even with maximum effort full of
global energy system
transformation based solely on
renewables scale up will require
many decades.
Too slow.
For 1.5 degree carbon budget.
Therefore, Mr Chair
Well, renewables must expand
rapidly.
Other solutions like Green
hydrogen bioenergy nuclear
power. Carbon capture synthetic
fuels methane digestion,
reforestation and enhanced
mineralization also play
Other solutions like green
hydrogen bioenergy, nuclear
power, carbon capture synthetic
fuels, methane digestion,
reforestation and enhanced
mineralization also played
critical roles in comprehensive,
socially acceptable deep carbon
ization frameworks.
That solve the climate crisis
within politically feasible
timelines.
Why support and bring these
technologies companies and
projects to New Mexico?
First it aligns with and
accelerates fulfilling New
Mexico's statutory 2030 2045
emissions reduction and
renewable energy targets.
Number two, adding specialized
decarbonization tech firms
diversifies New Mexico's energy
and manufacturing profile beyond
fossil fuels, enhancing our
economic resilience. It taps
into booming global demand for
emissions slashing solutions.
Three strategic partnerships
become possible between these
startups or growth companies in
New Mexico's national labs
universities and legacy and
energy industries.
Around technology validation,
scaling and adoption, thus
retaining innovation value.
Number four.
Urbanization, tech generates
high quality jobs in science,
engineering and technical
services fields where new Mexico
wants to expand workforce skills
and retention.
Number five.
The network effect of an
expanded in state. Clean tech
cluster include supply chain
localization idea cross
pollination between companies
wider access to growth capital
and a talented workforce drawn
to the cluster.
And lastly, number six.
It raises New Mexico's profile
as an international hub for
climate solutions, innovation
and production.
This positioning also helps
attract climate focused federal
research funding.
In essence, Mr Chair, proactive
recruitment of emerging
decarbonization technology
companies perfectly aligns with
and enables New Mexico's broader
economic diversification and
emissions reduction objectives.
And with that, Mr Chair, we will
stand for questions or explain
the substitute. Excellent. Thank
you very much. Representative.
Um, can we Can you briefly
summarize the substitute? We've
moved that for discussion.
Excuse me for discussion if you
can briefly summarizes
substitute, then we'll go out
for
Will adopt the substitute.
We won't will vote on whether or
not to pass it out later will
adopt it after you explain it.
Thank you, mr Chair. So the
committee substitute that
everyone should have is
0.228186 0.4.
Um, Mr Chair.
Okay, Hold on. I've got the 0.4
version. Let's make sure that
we've
Okay, Okay, We've got it.
Okay, Wonderful. So, Mr Chair,
the House appropriations and
finance committees substitute
does it few things number one,
It adds definitions that were
requested and recommended in the
previous Commerce Committee
hearing.
Number two we changed the name
of the division from climate,
energy and water to next
generation resource
technologies.
Somewhat more specific.
In simultaneously brought
Um, number three we clarified.
Hmm. The functions of this
division as not having
regulatory or permitting
authority.
And not superseding.
Or usurping.
The authority of other state
agencies.
And number four. We reorganized
the division responsibilities to
provide clarity for those
reading from start to finish.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Any questions on those
components?
Representative Han components
are on the substitute, Mr Chair
on the subset we can. I think
What I'd like to do is adopt a
substitute, and then we're
discussing that And then we can
go to audience participation.
Then we'll go to questions moved
to adopt. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's
a motion to adopt our house
Appropriations of Finance
Committee Substitute.
Uh, for house commerce.
Substitute for House Bill nine.
Is there any opposition to that?
K seeing none. We have adopted
the substitute. Okay. Now let's
go out for public comment first
for those who are here who would
like to speak and opposition.
Can you please raise your hand?
Great. Would you mind lining up
here in the middle?
We can't we? We want to allow
sufficient time.
Um
And we've got we should have the
microphones that are beneath
you. You may need to move up
just a tad.
Yeah.
Excellent. Thank you. And thank
you to Yes. Go ahead. Whenever
you're ready. Try to keep it to
about a minute. Please, Miss
Crystal Curly, um, executive
director of a nonprofit called
Indigenous life ways and this
made up division will oversee a
decarbonization technology
program that fails to state the
following what is the divisions,
goals and objectives? What are
the decarbonization programs? Um
Sorry objectives. There is no
proven mythologies methodologies
to de carbonized. This will
ultimately be a multimillion
dollar failed investment into
take into technologies that is
not proven. There is no method
of how to de carbon izing.
There's no methods of how
decarbonization will happen in
New Mexico.
Um, we know that they
DECARBONIZATION includes the
following that zero nature based
nature based solutions. Carbon
capture sequestration, which are
all false solutions. This one
not lower our emissions. We
cannot feed into a climate
finance mechanism. There is no
credible evidence that proves
that climate economics helps de
carbonized.
We need real solutions that
actually lower greenhouse gas
emissions. We are ground zero
for the U. S. For the largest
methane cloud and the largest
radioactive spill. We need real
solutions. Now. Global climate
finance markets are not the
answer. New Mexico has the power
to redefine climate solutions by
honoring indigenous values.
And investing into regenerative
economies that prioritizes our
health and well being. For youth
and families. We need a clear
definition on what clean energy
is. There's a propaganda that is
manipulating the word clean,
such as clean coal, clean,
nuclear and clean hydrogen. This
is this is does not exist. This
clean type of energy is non
existent. We need renewable
energy investments now first
solar and wind and we encouraged
the committee to support real
solutions.
And both know on HP nine. Thank
you very much.
Good afternoon chair and
committee. My name is Julia
Bernal. I'm the executive
director of Public Action
Alliance. And, um, I strongly
encourage you to vote No on
House Bill nine because they
will leave the door wide open to
fund and authorized unproven and
dangerous removal technologies
like hydrogen carbon capture and
sequestration. Direct air
capture.
And many, many others. Um, as
we've heard in previous
hearings, this division and its
pursuit to invest in
technologies to de carbonized
sectors that event greenhouse
gasses is providing those
opportunities, um to fund and
bring different types of
international companies to New
Mexico.
To build up hydrogen, which has
been, you know strongly opposed
in the past and other
technologies that just haven't
been well researched yet.
Um the terms like
decarbonization and next
generation resources are
undefined, specific and vague.
Therefore, greenwashing with
loose definitions, which will
help advance um some of these
market mechanisms to develop
dangerous pathways if this bill
was to continue pursuing the re
use of produced water for energy
production is also something
that is being pursued without
adequate hydrologic and hydro
geologic studies.
So how can we be assured that
this new technology won't
impact? Um higher quality
groundwater, aquifer, depletion,
streams, flows and even cause
land subsistence.
Um, we don't agree with using
public funds to invest in the
private sector because it puts a
burden on taxpayers and allows
New Mexico to bail out the oil
and gas industry again. How can
we be assured that these
emerging technologies are clean
and right for New Mexico? So
please vote? No on HB nine.
Thank you very much.
Good evening chairman members of
the committee. My name is
Jonathan Juarez. And I'm here
today as a spokesperson for
Yucca, which is youth United for
climate crisis action. We're
here today, representing
thousands of our members and
supporters across the state.
We've been pleading with this
body to take meaningful climate
action to save our future for
the last five years yet instead
of facilitating investment and
deployment of proven science
based climate mitigation
technologies
This bill and others appear to
be designed to move forward the
governor's dirty hydrogen
agenda, an agenda that I might
add despite being introduced in
nearly 12 bills in the past two
sessions, has repeatedly been
turned down and tabled.
This bill and her plan to take
fracking wastewater and
repackage it as new water.
Is, you know, with a whole lot
of subsidization for industry
and handouts for industry rather
than prioritizing the health and
well being of our communities.
Instead of feeling more secure
about our future. This bill
poses serious risks and concerns
to our public health. Our
climate goals and are precious
and already scarce Water
resources.
Even though this committee
substitute gives the option to
the agency to put some
guardrails on grants. It leaves
those guardrails as
possibilities.
Meanwhile, this bill could
facilitate fast track and fun
projects that actually have no
proven emission reductions
benefits.
And that actually harm our
communities that use fossil
fuels as a basis for their
energy production, and that
threaten our precious water
supplies. This bill as written
is unacceptable, unacceptable
and we urge you to vote now.
Thank you very much.
Mr Chairman, members of the
committee. My name is Paul
Spencer from Bluewater Village
in Mexico. I served as president
of Abdul Water Water Sanitation
District.
And I stand opposed to this this
bill, and I hope that you would,
too.
Um
I agree with much of the
comments that were spoken just
before.
But what I want to propose to
you as a question is, why are we
creating another department
within the department? Why don't
we just find these departments?
With the money that they need to
be able to meet their mission
and then meet their goals.
Why are we creating a
department?
Given to the private sector.
Investing all of our state
funding.
To help them through the
navigation, navigating the
funding process and the
permitting process.
When
As according to Secretary James
Kenny. We have
The equivalent of one person to
serve 1068 public water systems
and helping him to do the same
thing.
Into helping them find
affordable funding.
Uh, and navigate through the
funding programs that
Just got injected all that
bipartisan infrastructure law
funding. I think our priorities
should be fixing the problems
that we have. Now we have
communities that have 80% water
loss. Conclude your thoughts.
And other communities have 50%
water Last. Most communities
have 23%. We really need to
prioritize our efforts on fixing
up the problems we have today.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Spencer.
Thank you so so much, Mr Chair
and madam vice chair and
sponsor.
First I want to talk about what
we agree on. We deeply agree
with the sponsor and vice chair
on the urgency of climate change
and really appreciate the
conversations about this bill
and what to do about the
emergency generally, but it
seems like over these last few
sessions, we keep getting stuck
on.
What are the solutions? There
are some of them. We all agree
on renewable and battery storage
coming on right now and working
in our state. So are there ways
that we can build the type of
structures we need to respond to
this emergency, but that allow
us to overcome the differences
on technologies that in my case,
we think
Won't work. You know, For
example, there is no functioning
carbon capture and
sequestration on any electric
emitter in this country. It just
doesn't work. And so how can we
identify language that lets us
sort through together What will
work and what won't work so we
don't stumble on the same stuff
over and over again.
But we get to the things that
science and efficiency and
solutions show us together, So I
think that requires a little
more time than we've had. And if
we could do that all together
and sort of an open process with
deep discussion and back and
forth, I think that help us all.
But we certainly appreciate the
intent.
Sorry, ma'am, Can you again just
announce your name? Sorry.
Sorry. I am Camila. Five woman
and I'm with the real grounded
chapter of the Sierra Club.
Great. Thank you very much.
Parsons, your honor and
committee members.
Um, I'm gonna read because I'm
not used to testifying verbally.
I'm much better at writing.
That comes from government
service.
Although I agree with the
concept of this proposed
legislation
There are several serious
weaknesses in the bill as it's
written now.
Which are the reasons that I
asked you to vote against HB
nine.
Primary and limited purpose of
the bill.
Needs to be a more clearly
defined scope.
Four and hand Ernie Energy
Development Division.
Explicitly stating that it's
responsible for connecting
innovators with polluters.
To help them de carbonized
conserved water and reduce
pollution, while also clearly
stating
That the Energy development
Division does not have
regulatory authority because
that can create a conflict of
interest. HB nine needs to be
revised to explicitly state
And this division won't have a
regulatory authority.
And that it's not authorized to
advocate for legislation.
That would lessen the regulatory
authority of the regulatory
agencies.
No Mexico Environmental
Department Please conclude your
thought.
Energy, minerals and state of
the engineer, Nathan Green,
retain primacy for permitting
and enforcement.
Thank you, Mr Persons. Okay,
These will be our final two
comments and opposition.
Please go ahead.
Hey, my name is Daniel. So
And I'm a Democratic voter from
San Juan County. Basically, my
message is
To ask the committee.
Vote. No
This bill.
Short and sweet. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hi. My name is Sarah Can hope I
live in Albuquerque and I stood
up in opposition because I think
there are a couple of things
that are vague about this bill
that maybe somebody could
clarify. So, um my questions are
what is the connection between
this new division and the
treatment of produced water?
And what science are we using?
Guide us. Similarly, What's the
connection between this bill and
the treatment of brackish water?
And what science are we using?
Uh, guiding us in the treatment
of brackish water in particular.
I think some of us have
questions about where will the
waste from the treatment of
brackish water go? So those are
really questions? Thank you.
Great. Thank you very much.
Okay? Is there anybody who
wishes to speak in support?
Kate. Seeing none will go back
to you, Um
Uh ah. We'll go back to you by
Sir Dixon. I know there's some
cabinet secretaries who I assume
are here.
In support if they come back,
and if there are questions that
members have that we want to
address, we'll go to that.
Anything that you'd like to
address briefly before we go to
committee questions.
Mr Chair. Thank you. I think we
can go to committee questions.
I'm sure some of the things that
we might highlight will be
asked. Sounds great. Okay, We're
gonna go first to represent
Chatfield ranking member
Armstrong, representing
Pettigrew, and then keep going.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair.
The last speaker just brought up
something that
Did I? I should have thought
about before the Kay Bailey
Million gallons of water a day.
It brings that water up from a
From a saline aquifer underneath
the
The ground their bio paso. It
cleans it up. It cleans it so
clean that they have to add
mineral back into it.
Ah!
Okay? Does that at a cost of
$2 per 1000 gallons We went, We
saw the and the the
What's left? You know the what
they cleaned out of that water
is re injected back into the
aquifer back into the saline
layer that slays me beneath
there, so it really has minimal
effect on anything. They re
inject the sailing.
Purified saline back into the
ground, and it produces good,
clean drinking water for
everybody.
Uh, CEO to injection. Some of
you know that I spent many years
before I was elected working on
a, uh, pore space bill right has
to deal with who want support
space that you inject that in
Uh and I also live right on top
of the Bravo Dome, which is the
largest deposit of natural C 02
in the world.
Yeah. And, uh, yeah. Um
Mr Chair. Oh, gentle lady. You
know what?
Tertiary recovery is
I'll tell you Tertiary recovery
is CEO to inject it into the oil
field to push the oil out. Been
doing that for many, many, many
Go to and it it.
Hasn't bothered anybody makes
the all come up, uh, like to
speak to the issue of
Of
Storage of C 02 underground.
And whether or not it's
successful.
So
Many northern European European
countries, including Belgium,
didn't work. Norway United
Kingdom
Have been injecting CO two
underground.
For many, many years, in fact,
in the North Sea, there are spit
natural gas wells that will
accept up to 200 billion tons
They've already injected
millions of tons, but they will
hold up to 200 billion with a B
tons.
Of C 02. That's ongoing. It's
very successful in some of the
countries that are the cleanest
in the world.
C 02 is now being added into
seabed.
Uh, to make up part of the
cement.
And cement as got limestone so
That brings to mind
Do you know what the largest
carbon sink in the world is?
Mr. Chair, Representative
Chatfield. I do not not in
favor. It's not the rainforest,
though I'll give you a hint. It
is the final plankton in the
ocean.
And they die. They make little
shells out of limestone. They
die and they fall to the bottom
of the ocean, and they make a
sedimentary rock called
Limestone.
The white cliffs of Dover in
England.
Hundreds of feet tall. They are
made out of tiny little
microscopic final plankton.
And, uh, I looked him up their
coreligionists point if I could
say it right, So that's what
makes limestone and that's
that's the biggest largest
carbon sink in the world is, uh,
the final plankton in the ocean,
so I don't
You know?
I'm a little tentative about
How much carbon effects us. I
think the sun had. You know you
have sunspots. Yeah, Son gets
cold. I've seen it. I've seen it
argued both ways. I don't mind
storing a little carbon
underground. Inject it down into
3000 ft. Down. We know what a
capstone is. A capstone is what
holds down all gas, water.
Anything that's held down
underneath the ground and
There's a capstone in the North
Sea. There's one under my house,
so you have to find the
appropriate place to put it. Put
it down there wisely and the
it's not a problem. Thank you,
Mr Chair. Thank you very much
for upset. Chatfield ranking
member Armstrong, please.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. And
thank you, representative
Chatfield for educating us up.
That's always always love to
hear you tell your stories and
information. So, um, Madam, Mr
Chairman, uh, madam vice chair.
Why are we creating another
state matching funds when we
have a bill?
Where we have state matching
funds for federal funds.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
madam ranking member. So in
terms of the
Options for how the fund would
be used. You're right that there
are three ways in which grants
could be distributed and one
could be for matching grants for
competitive federal
opportunities. Um
Certainly.
Those are those opportunities
could be matched through the New
Mexico Match Fund. However, if
it's a better fit to go through
this fund because it's let's say
a, um
Yeah. Collaborative enterprise
between a research university, a
local economic development
partner and say
Um, tribal nation. It might be
More appropriate for
The funding to come through this
process. Thank you, Mr Chairman
and Madam Vice chair. I just I
think I complained about it
during our
When we had agencies in front of
us where we were giving them
money for federal matching
dollars, and I would really like
to
Hold all that in and have it
come out of the same
Entity. I understand that it
could be a public private
partnership. It could be a lot
of different things, but, um
I don't know a lot about this,
except that someone brought to
my attention that the these
departments could do this.
Themselves without this type of
legislation. Is there any could
they create these departments
themselves and use the matching
fund for their grants?
Applications.
Mr Mr Chair. Um, members of the
committee, representative
Armstrong.
Um as far as creating the
activities budget supporting
Yes, we could do those things.
Um, having a non reverting fund
to fund pilot projects and other
activities, Uh, allows allows
for not putting the strain of
having to do everything in a
nine month timeframe.
Get the RFP s out. Get the
activity done and get it spent
in a timeframe, so having the
non reburying fund does allow
longer flexibility to truly work
on pilot science based projects
and get that together. Uh, as
far as utilizing it for matching
that that's a small portion of
what the fund would be used for.
Um as
As the secretary of economic
development.
Um
I would vision it more towards
working with private sector.
And research institutions,
whether they be federal or from
our research institutions.
Of taking something that we know
works in the lab.
Improving it at scale. And and
then we, you know, then we could
take that technology that
representative Chatfield already
given us a great education on
the science that's out there and
and and use it.
Ah, at scale to reduce carbon
emissions. Whatever that takes
off.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. And
thank you for the answers. Thank
you, madam Vice chair.
Thank you very much. Ranking
member Armstrong Pettigrew.
please. Then represent
Thank you, Mr Chair. Um
Thank you, madam Vice chair and
secretary. Grouper. Um
Probably gonna deal with the
majority of my questions.
If it makes this to the floor.
I am Nash met Madame, Um Mr
Chair and Madam vice chair on
various specific question on
Page 6923 and 24.
Says, do anything necessary to
carry out the divisions,
purposes and exercise the
divisions power?
Mr Chair, Madam Vice chair. It
sounds like you just gave Mark
Roper Carp munch on doing
whatever the hell you want.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you.
Representative pedigree That's
actually something a minnow
allow the secretary to respond
also, But I did, um, ask
Legislative Council services
about those two lines
specifically, um and that is
very customary for that. That
specific, um
Subsection items to be included.
its in game and fish. Um, it's
in a whole variety of other
locations and statutes. So it is
not abnormal. Um
But perhaps you know, I don't
know if the secretary can
elaborate. Why, Um, we like to
include Mr Chair members of the
committee representative
Pettigrew Pie wished. Uh, but,
uh but but what it does say is
that it gives a gives charges us
with with doing the things
necessary.
To accomplish the task, uh,
established by the statute.
Um, it doesn't give us carte
blanche to break procurement. It
doesn't give us carte blanche to
do things that are not not
within the rules and regulations
of government. But it does. It
does charge us with with doing
the things necessary, uh, within
human means to carry out the
charges of the statue.
Thank you, Mr Chair, Madam Vice
chair, Mr. Secretary. Um
Yes, this were to be enacted.
Would you?
Agreed that this would probably
go through rulemaking process.
Mr Chair members of the
committee representative
Pedigree. Absolutely. Um, if for
nothing else, um
The fund itself would need to
have policies and procedures put
in place, which is usually done
by rule.
Uh, with a policy manual to back
up the additional detailed data
behind the rule we have We have
such a rule in place for JTF. We
have such a rule in place for
Lita with policy manuals to back
them up. So I would say yes.
absolutely there, there would be
a rulemaking process.
That would take place on the
fun. Thank you, Mr Chair, Madam
Vice chair and
Secretary of rubber so
Seems like with each question I
get another one with the
response. I am concerned that
The room, making millions some
way impact your division
purposes and division powers,
and that does not get to be part
of the statute.
Which is a problem I have with
rulemaking to begin with, as
many of you get
Appear already or aware of, so
Um
That right? There gives me a
significant amount of angst.
Mr Chair I want to finish with
with this. We are creating
another department.
Um, I will say.
As a complement. This is
probably one of the few
departments I would agree that
we could afford to do that, with
with with respect to your
performance ratings and how how
you how your department's run,
Okay.
Um
The other departments that this
may Mr Chair of could have gone
to. I would have been scared to
death and so with respect to
that
Um
I am completely against creating
and another department.
Completely against rulemaking.
The potentially has
The waves are defined.
Page six lines, 23 and 24.
Um
I disagree with the people that
were in opposition to this for a
whole bunch of different
reasons, but I stay in
opposition right now to thank
you. Thank you. Next we have
represented Garrett.
Thank you, Mr Chair, and I'm
really sorry that
representatives, Haryana is not
with us. She's still recovering,
and we went over the old one.
There's improvements, but I do
have a number of questions. My
first question is on Page two.
Um, line 16.
I have learned that the word
includes is very deceptive.
Um, because it says it includes
this but includes actually also
means would not be limited to
So I'm concerned about the
expansion. It's It's one of
those words. We've all run into
bills where it says includes,
and then you find out
Someone says, But you didn't say
this. So how can you include it?
So just one of those words that
can be
Manipulated. Thank you, Madam
Chair and representative, Um,
the answer that I would provide
to that is particularly on
something like Decarbonization
project And when we talk about a
lot of these technologies, there
are a lot of technologies that
have not yet been developed. Um,
and so to potentially exclude
something could be very
judgmental.
Additionally, Mr Chair members
of the committee representative,
your I would point to, um the
line line 14 above it where we
did, where we define
decarbonization, meaning the
removal reduction or elimination
of greenhouse gas emissions.
So Decarbonization project has
to meet the Decarbonization.
Um, definition, so to say that
then includes I. I think it's
covered by by lying 14.
Thank you and just
Just saying, uh, Mr Chairman
Next question is on Page three.
Um Section two.
So this, um lines 18 to 23.
We've removed the technology
Enterprise division.
And the trade in Mexican affairs
division. Where did they go?
Mr Chair. Members of the
committee representative
Garrett, both of those divisions
have been administratively
removed by previous
administrations within the
economic development Department.
There just this is cleaned up
language. They're sitting there
in statute and haven't been
haven't been part of the
department and in probably a
decade.
And they have been
administratively removed through
the process With LFC India. This
Not at this moment. No.
Okay. I'm just concerned, Mr
Chair because with everything
happening at the border, um,
North seconds department falls
under what?
Mr Chair, members of the
committee, the science and
technology and and strategic
planning that Nora Socket is the
head of rests under the Economic
Development Division.
Um, so that that's where it
currently resides under the
economic development division.
So
Yes and
To say we we do not have an
office in Mexico City. We do
have international trade
activities. We do have an office
in Taiwan. Uh, we also have a
contractor in place that does
activities on both sides of the
border, both in Mexico and on
the new Mexico side of the
border. Uh and his and his those
are both contractors to to the
department working on
international trade in those two
regions.
Okay. Thank you. Christmas
chair. Mexico is now at 475
billion more than China. So it's
just I don't want to forget the
other functions of the, uh,
economic development.
Meant department. Okay, my next
question Mr Chair is and Mr term
asking questions because I
believe this is the only
committee
That the this bill was heard
previously in house commerce
with us. Thank you, Mr Chair on
page for, um, Lines five. So in
creating the next generation
Resource technologies division.
What increase in Ft East. Do we
expect our people transferring?
Do we need new F T. E s?
To handle this division.
Mr Chairman, members of the
committee representative
director if I am not mistaken,
and I'm sure the chair Bill
correct me If I'm not mistaken
there, there is an appropriation
within HB two that were a lot of
what would allow for the
establishment of appropriate FTE
s as well as potential
contractual.
Operations and other expenses
that would come with this new
division.
Thank you and, um, just two
final questions, Mr Chair on
Page six.
Line nine b. It says the
division many It seems to me
that for B number one, it should
be shell coordinate.
Um
The this word number two and 3
may is okay, but I just feel
like
Division shall coordinate with
the Department of Environment.
Energy murals. Those departments
That's just something I think we
have to ensure I know that in C
on 25 going over to seven
depart it talks about regulatory
actions.
But I just feel for B one. It
should be changed to shell.
That's my comments. Mr. Chair.
Thank you Represent Garrett.
Next, we're gonna go to
represent Luhan.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Um
Sponsors for bringing this
forward Mr Chairman. I'll do, um
Transparency. I was asked to
sign onto this bill and I had to
do a deeper dive on this. So
thank you for asking me to join,
Um
And I just want to say to the
sponsor. It's not easy to sit
there and to hear all this.
All the comments that you had to
go through, so I just wanted to
just say it's not easy, and I
and I want to just tell you I
feel for you and that in your
position sitting through that,
and it's your strong
Um
But with that, Mr Chair, um
I think I've always said this
and the reason why I sit in the
seat that I sit in right now is
to bring forward the best.
Type of policy that's going to
address climate crisis that
we're facing.
And I'll do respect Mr Chair. I
don't think that this is ready
for prime time, although I think
you're moving in the right
direction.
Um
I feel that it, um
Doesn't make the mark in a lot
of concerning ways as we're
looking at climate policy in
climates.
Um
Efforts in in the full magnitude
that we need to
Um
So, Mr Chair, So I'm going to
have a few questions that I'm
going to go through my computer
just timed out.
And so bear with me, Um
I think I brought to this
committee early on.
Some of the questions I had
about
The initial bill that you with
initial concept of what you were
trying to accomplish here, and
it's gone through a couple of
iterations.
Um, Mr Chair? Um
Might invest Vice chair. Can you
tell me? Why you why the bill is
in, uh what those reiterations
from starting from an authority.
From H B 237 to where we are
today with HB nine as a
substitute.
Mr Chair.
Sure. Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you. Representative. Yes. So
there are you know, in concept,
There are a couple of different
ways that this entity could be
established and house built to
37 when it was introduced, Um,
set up this division as opposed
to being a division as it
administratively attached
office.
Um, more similar to the border
Authority or spaceport
authority. However, there were
some other reasons why it made
sense to
Proceed with setting this up as
a division within the Economic
Development Department.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I
appreciate this, Mr Chair. Um
Sponsor.
Did did this bill go through the
interim committees,
water, natural resources,
Science and technology or lfc,
Mr Chair.
Um, thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you, Representative. This is not
an interim endorsed Bill. Um,
However, I've been working with
the executive agencies since May
and June.
The chair. Uh, sponsor. Why
didn't agencies during our
hearings and lfc bring this
through forward within their
budgets, Mr. Chair? Thank you,
Mr Chair. And thank you,
Representative, Um
Because the the budget language
that was put in as
There's contingency language. Um
and until the governor issued a
message for this particular
bill, um it wasn't guaranteed
that it was going to be heard.
Or, um,
Be a part of the budget.
Mr Chair. Um
Thank you. For the answer,
however.
This.
This appropriation for this
Bill was
Entered into our HB two,
Regardless of the or when was
that?
Established, Mr Chair.
Mm hmm.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
representative. It was
definitely on the, um, specials.
Um
Sheets that we reviewed as a
committee in Open committee. Um
and I believe that would have
been in January after the LFC
recommendation was published.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Appreciate your answers again.
Um, I just have some I just
would like to say.
And in the in light of in
respect of this, I think that
this bill needs to go through
further transition and work and
I'd be happy to work with you
further on this as we would move
this through interim. Um, it's
just
From the perspective and from
the seat. I sit in right now and
working.
On our budget intimately as I
have over the years, even as a
non member of this committee
I find that this is this needs a
lot more work and we are.
There's a redundancy and as
we're hearing this conversation
today,
Um, I'm hearing this concerns,
too, is where those overlaps and
there's still a lot of unclarity
within agencies.
Sharing.
Those those FTS and how that's
going to be established. Who's
going to be responsible for
that? How? Where? Who's
responsible to provide Serie was
and you know as an HR person
having worked for the state as
I've mentioned, I have not seen
that.
Or how that can be established
another places.
Maybe through eminent because
you do a lot of crossover type
work, but
This wasn't brought forward
through any agency during the
interim.
This was not brought forward
through any interim committee.
We are looking at other types of
established, um
Climate legislation through the
green, establishing and funding
the green bank that was put
forward and I was very
Had a very good in long
conversation in, uh
Water and Natural Resources
Committee. This bill was not
brought forward in Economic
development Committee, which I
see as a member as well. And I
think that this is this is just
where I sit with this right now.
Um, um Madam Chair. I mean, Mr
Chair, Madam vice chair.
Would you consider this to be an
energy based
Piece of legislation.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative Luhan at its
core. This is an economic
development.
Bill.
Mr Chair. This is everything
about this bill has energy and
and development and economic
development around types of
energies and types of solutions
with carbon
Why was this bill not
Sent to our house energy. We
don't have any control over
that. That's all right. So then
it's safe to say it did not go
into from you didn't go to our
energy Committee, Mr Chair.
Mr Chairman, members of the
committee representative Luhan.
Uh, as as the vice jurors said,
the core of this is economic
development.
With the focus.
On on climate. Uh
Greenhouse gas emission
reduction.
Just like we have a film
division.
That is focused on film just
like we have an economic
development division that is
focused on traditional economic
development ways, Just like we
have an outdoor recreation
division that's focused on those
things in the outdoor
recreation.
They even though that energy,
minerals and natural resources
overseas state parks
Because of the economic
development component. That's
why outdoor recreation exists
within economic development.
And for the same reasons here at
its core. This is about economic
development. It's about
continuing to drive economic
development with such projects
such as Maxi in bringing in
their solar
Manufacturing facilities such as
our coastal wind towers,
bringing their manufacturing
facility into ballin, New
Mexico such as star scientific
and bringing in there, they're
changing their mind blowing
changing technology to create
heat with the use of hydrogen
and oxygen.
And and supplement the uses of
fossil fuels to do such things
as generates steam, So at its
core, it's about creating those
technologies, generating high
wage jobs and driving economy
and New Mexico with the added
benefit.
Of reducing
Greenhouse gas emissions.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Uh,
When I hear
Anything regarding as I heard in
the introduction of this bill,
regarding all the
All the, um
Ideas are issues regarding
energy. To me. This is an energy
bill faced faced around economic
development.
As we can also argue that oil
and gas
As an energy source or is the
biggest economic development for
state, so I would I would, I
would, uh, agree and also
disagree at the same time with
you.
More side that this is based on
energy and based on the industry
that has caused us to have this
conversation.
And those emissions and those
greenhouse gasses.
And leading us to have the
further just the discussion
about those types of
technologies and those types of
investments were asking our
taxpayers to invest in through
this do what this bill wants to
do.
Now to me. There are two
different issues here. One being
that we are going to there is
way too much overlap with all of
our other.
Um
Economic and budget. Um
Lines were investments that we
have
And
Redundancy of work that's
already been done. That can be
That this bill, if enacted,
could convoluted or even
interfering.
We have
We have a lot of overlap with
enemy D and m nerd e d. D as
you're sitting there, Mr
Secretary. We have Rita. We have
the state engineer's office. We
have new Mexico Tech N M s u U
and M R Water Trust board N m F
A, which you've talked about.
I've heard today in discussion
about enterprise investments.
Um, we just updated our
enterprise. Um
Investment fund with an M F a
New Mexico Tech and, um, issue
And so on.
We have a lot of investment
trends. And you just testified
here that these entities are
agencies can already do This
work. Is that a correct
statement? Mr. Chair, Mr
Chairman, Members of the
Committee. Um um representative
Luhan.
Uh, I would like I would ask for
a little clarification of what
work? Yes. Economic Development
Department does can do economic
development work? Uh, the
Environment department works on
things related to the
environment. Um
But and energy, minerals and
natural resources has a very
broad
I think they work on a lot of a
lot of different things, but a
lot of those to do with the
extraction industries.
As well as those that use our
natural resources on in the
forest and other way. So, um,
yes, they do. Some of that work
absolutely. And some of the
technologies that we're going to
promote and enhance with this
division will come out of such
places. There's Los Alamos
National Labs, Sandia Labs and
the research institutions that
you mentioned. University of New
Mexico. New. Mexico, Turkey
Mexico State University.
Uh and that's the whole idea is
to take and transfer those
technologies as I mentioned
earlier from the lab.
The full scale.
Commercial productions that are
economic drivers in New Mexico.
Hmm.
Mr Chair. Um
Secretary. Thank you for that
answer. I do. I do believe based
on your answer to that.
This, uh, this duplication could
and would lead to inefficiencies
and confusion regarding
responsibilities and
authorities.
I don't think we flush that out
convincingly, sir, and I also do
believe we are adding on to
I don't think we flush that out
convincingly, sir and I also do
believe we are adding onto
creating another, Um
Office, a governmental office
and so therefore that is that is
additional duplication and we
are trying to streamline things.
And I understand that maybe the
intention here but I don't see
it.
Um, Mr Chair.
Um
I think I covered that the
supervision financial
responsibilities for shared
employees.
Could lead to operational
challenges are
Yeah. I just have a problem with
that. The other problem? I have,
Mr Chair. Um
We are creating
These things and
We need these. We need to take
climate action and the climate.
Crisis and we need to take
advantage of federal grants to
build.
Out of renewable energy system
and support overburdened
communities.
And I see that you've mentioned
here, Mr Chair. Um
Trying to, um Madam vice chair.
Um, that you have done outreach
in communities.
From promoting equity and
inclusion, engaging directly
with Indian nations, tribes and
pueblos ensures that the
benefits of economic development
And environmental protection
extent all communities promoting
equity and inclusion. When did
this occur? Mr Chair?
Um, Madam Chair, Mr. Chair,
Representative. I believe that
you are looking at what the
office can do in the handout.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Um
Madam vice chair again, Then
I'll ask. Was there any outreach
or any community involvement in
bringing forward this piece of
legislation?
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative. As I mentioned
earlier, I worked directly with
the agencies that have been
leading the charge. Um on
recruiting companies like Maxi
in hotel Universal hydrogen. I
work directly with the agencies
that would be implementing this.
Thank you. I really do
appreciate that again to me when
we are flushing out, and we're
doing this type of policy in
this type of work.
And we say that we're going to
do these things and we have as
much as responses we've had
against this bill today tells me
a story that we have not done
the work that this bill is not
ready for prime time, so to
speak, But I really do
appreciate your initiative. I
don't want us
Coming into something where
we're going to have such
pushback.
And such.
Such issues when we didn't take
the time to reach out to this
communities, especially in our
communities that
Have stood before us and asked
us not to enact this piece of
legislation today, Mr Chair.
I think that they have been
taken advantage of for far too
long.
I think your voices have been
neglected and beyond neglected
have not been
Taking into consideration a lot
of policies and laws that we
have. We even acted in the in in
the past, and I don't want this
to be our future And I don't
want this to be our present. I
want us to take the time.
I wanted to take have the
innovation to start any kind of
economic development.
Initiative.
In our communities and those
communities that are going to
need to have input. Mr. Chair,
Mr. Chair Representative. I
should have mentioned that, you
know.
In the months leading up to the
session. I've certainly had
conversations with various
chambers of commerce. Our
universities are national labs,
Um, venture capital firms that
do investment in clean tech and
other experts who are related to
economic development and clean
energy. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I
appreciate that, too. But I
don't hear their voices here
today in committee, Mr Chair.
I don't hear their
representation, and we just had
testimony from
San Juan.
County, saying asking us not to
vote for this book.
Mr Chair. Um
Madam Vice chair.
Decarbonization is a nice word.
I am further concerned that in
this bill, it doesn't actually
mean what we think it might be
Carbon. I should mean to reduce
real direct greenhouse gas
emissions from their source.
But instead in this bill it
seems to allow for companies to
just control them.
By the emissions and moving them
around instead of actually
reducing them.
I can go on and on, but I think
my bottom line is I want to
respect you. I want to respect
our process.
And I want to find a better
solution forward so that we can
Connect all the dots and make
sure that all the discussions
and everything that you're
trying to integrate into this
bill are
Completely formed.
Mr Chair.
Um and I would just have to say
at this moment I can't support
this piece of legislation. Um,
there's more to do, and I really
want to be part of that solution
in figuring how we move that
forward. Thank you. Mr. Thank
you represented Montoya, please.
Um, thank you, Mr Chair and
Madam vice chair.
Um
I did hear a similar
Bill in energy.
Just a couple of days ago, but
it was it had a different goal,
and it was too
Direct the state advancement
investment counsel.
Two.
Set aside or to not set aside
but to
Add to the list of preferences.
Uh um.
New energy technologies.
And I voted against that.
In energy.
And I voted against it because I
think it's imprudent.
To direct the state investment
counsel under how
They should.
Go about investing state
dollars, which the only thing
they should really be concerned
with is
Um
Getting the best return from
investment.
I see this as a different
And I the way that I see this as
different as we're talking about
emerging technologies that are
also trying to deal
With the climate crisis, and I
think this has a measure of
reality to it that I don't
believe wind and solar alone.
How have
I don't believe the folks.
Who want
Wind and solar to be the
complete answer.
It just ignores a lot of
realities and one of those being
The rest of the world,
especially emerging countries
are not following that lead.
Um, And by the way before I move
on, I would like to say I
received a text from the
lobbyist for the Hickory Apache
Nation.
Saying that they stand in
support of this bill.
And they think that it would
control contribute some options.
To their ability to adapt.
At a more reasonable rate.
Concerning oil and gas, hickory
Apache Nation, Mr Chair is very
reliant on oil and gas and
A
A transition.
Of sorts. This would allow
technology to be developed that
they can transition without
harming their economy the way
Frankly,
The Navajo nation has been
harmed through the quick and
abrupt departure from coal.
As a matter of fact, Mr Chair
and and representative, Uh, we
have some, uh I also have
received from the Navajo nation
support.
Um, there is a couple of, uh,
hydrogen.
Uh,
Options for them, one being what
would start as blue hydrogen and
turn to a green hydrogen
project.
As it becomes more financially
feasible.
So
I do see this as
An actual economic development
issue here.
We're talking about.
Is
As I as I was listening to the
debate.
And listening to the discussion.
Um, I
Just looked at since.
Last year, since, uh, a little
over a year that the sound one
coal mine has been
Shut down or about a year, the
coal mine has been shut down and
power plant has been shut down.
China.
Has permitted.
More coal mines and more power
plants than the rest of the
world combined. And Mr Chair, um
I believe you were involved in
some of the discussions that we
had, but
There was an option at that time
to try and come up with carbon
sequestration.
And I and I hold to the to this
That is a technology that still
needs to be proven.
However, if we can prove that
technology
It can have a bigger effect.
On countries.
Who are not going to invest.
In finding out if they can be
carbonized.
The materials that they're going
to use.
That they are going to use.
China is continuing to build.
Coal power plants.
At a at a tremendous rate.
And as I understand our
Our our globe.
It's one big environment.
And we can shut down everything
here in New Mexico.
But if Saudi Arabia is going to
continue to produce oil
If China is going to continue to
produce coal
If we want to have a real effect
on them.
The major producers.
We need to come up with
technologies that they can
utilize.
Because they're not going away
from those energy sources.
Russia is doubling down on their
relationship with Saudi Arabia
right now.
So
If we're going to go down this
road in in New Mexico of
Taking out what is our number
one?
Our our budget is based on oil
and gas. Let's face it.
If we're gonna go down this road
we need to. We need at least
pursue technologies that might
As
Help us to de carbonized.
There's no guarantee this is a
new technology. There's no
guarantee that that's going to
be the answer.
But I do know Mr Chair and
representative.
In California they pursued
Renewable so fast.
That their economy could not
sustain it.
And they've had to add natural
gas.
To their list of clean,
renewable.
Energy sources. It's now
In California.
Natural gas.
Is a base energy for them
because they need
A base load energy.
But this isn't just about as I
read your as I read your, uh,
Bill.
It is not just about
Decarbonization
This is pretty agnostic. As far
as what answers can we come up
with? So to that? I would like
to ask you.
In New Mexico at our
laboratories.
Especially Los Alamos
Laboratories have have
Our researchers at those labs
developed small nuclear
Uh, power plants.
Mr Care. Members of the
committee representative
Montoya.
To answer your question. Los
Alamos National Labs has been
the leader of nuclear
technologies since its
inception.
Um
Granted. A lot of good work is
in the weapons side. But but
yes, they they are And in
addition to that we have Cairo's
power.
Located in Albuquerque, New
Mexico.
Uh, that chosen to Mexico to do
their continued R and D and
development.
Of the
Of assault based cooling
process for small nuclear power
plants to reduce the amount of
water needed for nuclear power
plants so that they could be
placed in safer regions away
from areas that wouldn't get
tsunamis and earthquakes.
Um So yes.
There's multiple technologies
happening in New Mexico in that
particular area.
So, Mr Chair and representative
other technologies are our
research institutes and our
colleges and universities. Are
they also looking into those as
well? Have we funded and have we
allowed them to move forward
with some of these other
technologies? New Mexico Tech in
particular.
Mr Chairman, members of the
committee representative
Montoya.
Uh, yes. And I think you heard
me testify in front of energy.
The next energy, whatever it is,
it's out there. The next
technology is out there. We
don't need to be scared of it.
But what we really should be
embracing is that that
technology comes from New Mexico
and that the development of that
technology and the manufacturing
of that technology happens in
New Mexico so that when China or
Saudi Arabia or whoever decides
that they want to use that
technology that we're deriving
the economic benefit and
contribute in creating that
diversity within our economy.
So thank you, Mr Chair. As I
stated earlier, I couldn't
support a bill that directed are
Our state events in the council
and how to invest what this is.
I see as more of
How do we support
Research. And how do we How do
we support it?
Bye.
Allowing our economic economic
development.
Department.
To help provide the same type of
help that they give
Two other industries such as was
mentioned the film industry and
others.
I would just like to to conclude
Mr Chair with
Uh, gentleman by the name of
Bill Gates.
Uh,
Microsoft was founded on April
4th 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul
Allen and Albuquerque, New
Mexico.
Mr Chair and Representative,
Where are they today? Are they
still located in New Mexico with
New Mexico have benefited from
that major company being grown
right here.
Or did they go somewhere else?
Mr Chairman, members of the
committee. I think everybody
knows the first answer that
question, though they are long
no longer here.
And despite the fact that I've
been with the department of
really long time and have really
great hair, I wasn't here when
that happened. But what I can
tell you is that access to
capital was the biggest reason
that
That they left New Mexico.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you very much for
upsetting Montoya. Next, we're
gonna go to represent Brown and
representative Allyson and we'll
keep going. Thank you, Mr
getting a little late, but this
is a great conversation. I
appreciate members. Please take
your time. Mr Chair. I
appreciate that very much. Um
Representative, Mr Secretary. I
want to start with a question
Does this committee said this is
the 0.4 version?
Have anything to do with
Water, cleaning up water,
desalinization. Anything having
to do with water at all? Mr.
Chair, Mr. Chair. Members of the
committee representative Brown.
Specifically, no
Um, But if that is if there's
something related to that, that
kind of help reduce greenhouse
emissions will embrace it, but
specifically, is it
Uh, is it directed towards
brackish or produced water? No,
it is not. Okay. Thank you very
much.
Mr Chairman and represented
Dixon. Um
Can I ask you a question? It's
not a trick question, but we're
gonna go with your answer here.
So is a public utility like PNM
or Excel.
Public or private entity.
Mr Chair.
Mr Chairman, members of the
committee, the the two companies
that you specifically mentioned
are private utilities.
They are regulated by the Public
Regulation Commission due to the
nature of their monopoly type
operations, so, but they are
privately held companies.
Thank you for that. I think
that's a good answer. Mr. Chair,
Representative, Mr. Secretary.
What about Electric co ops,
public or private?
Um, Mr Chair members of the
committee that that's a that's a
little a little harder to to
defined, but they are private
entities they do.
Have access to some federal
assistance.
Ah, but overall they are private
entities. Mr. Chair and
Representative. Have you heard
from P and M or excel?
Either one or both. That were
they stand on this bill. The
committee substitute
Mr. Chair, Representative. Thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative. I have not had
conversations with PNM. However,
I have had conversations with
Excel. And while
They are not here, Speaking in
support or opposition of the
bill, One of the things that
they mentioned is that in the
locations that they operate, um,
investment in new technologies
is very important to them and
something that they do support.
Okay. Thank you. Mr Chair,
representative.
So my my assumption is that
utilities have made major
capital investments and they are
the key players for providing
electricity for New Mexico.
And so I think we have to
consider truly where they are on
this issue.
I think everybody is open to
innovation and doing things
better, but their capital
investments.
Are pretty well established, and
I think that's true for the long
term.
So, um, I'm questioning Mr
Chairman and Representative if
we really even need this
division to exist.
We know Mr Chairman, that we
have robust research at our
national labs on energy. What's
the best technology?
Emerging technologies and things
like that. So
I think In some ways we don't
need a division in state
government to be directing
research and all those things. I
really don't think we need it.
Also, um, Mr Chairman, um
There is an obligation of the
national labs to engage in
technology transfer.
That is federal law. And so
what? What they're working on
their supposed to share with
anybody who wants to see it.
So I I don't really see this new
division is adding a whole lot
of value.
To, um to where we are with
that, Um, let me also Mr Chair.
Just I'll try to be quick.
I do have a problem. Mr
Chairman, representative with
the definitions on Page two of
the bill.
The definition of
decarbonization and then
decarbonization project.
Now here is the definition of
decarbonization. It's in line
14. It says it means the
removal.
Reduction or elimination of
greenhouse gas emissions.
Mr Chair representative, in my
opinion, That means something is
already carbon intensive.
And you're removing, reducing or
eliminating the greenhouse gas.
But what about
Technologies that already do
exist and they will exist in
forms in the future for non
carbon producing.
And for example, Um and I know
that represent wants to comment
on that. But
I don't see this definition
really, including
Non carbon producing
technologies like nuclear and
I'm It could be existing
nuclear. Yep, small modular that
are in the future and the
advanced reactor. So Mr Chair
that represented Dixon, Would
you mind addressing that,
please? Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you, Representative Brown.
That's a wonderful question. I
would say that the definition
that's included in the bill is
sort of a standard definition
and
The reason that it is broad. Um,
and perhaps it doesn't include
specifically some of the things
that you referenced is because
when we talk about
Decarbonization, it also means
the mitigation of usage. So, for
instance, I wanna included in
the materials that I provided
for folks are
A list of 10 key Decarbonization
technologies, and I'd just like
to share those for the public so
that there's a better
understanding.
Renewable energy systems
Hydrogen fuel applications
bioenergy with carbon capture,
utilization and sequestration,
electric vehicles, carbon
capture and storage, energy
storage, smart grids and energy
efficiency, industrial
efficiency and electrification
building insulation, air ceiling
and heat pumps and organic waste
diversion.
Um, the fundamental
Role or the key to
Decarbonization is the
reduction. The elimination
reduction or removal of carbon
and that can also be defined
through energy efficiency.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair
Representative. So I disagree
with that. I don't see nuclear
energy listed. It is non carbon
producing.
And I've studied extensively on
this issue. I have. I put a lot
of time into this.
And it is the wave of the future
is nuclear because it is non
carbon producing, and if it's
not
Again. The verbs are in this is
under the project determined
Ization project.
Removes, reduces or eliminates
greenhouse gas emissions. It
doesn't say already not
producing.
So I guess we could quibble on
the definition. But I do not
believe this includes our
address is my concern. So, Mr
Chair and Mr Secretary
Um, Mr Chair members of the
committee representative Brown.
I think
The definition does include
Those for, for example.
If it were a small nuclear
module.
Um
Electric producing
Generation plant.
And it will replacing.
A coal fired generation
facility.
Or even a natural gas.
Fired generation facility.
That would meet this definition
of
Decarbonization
Yes, the technology is already
non carbon producing, but it is
replacing or reducing the use of
a carbon producing facility so
that would fit within this
definition.
Yeah, Mr Chair and Mr Secretary
representatives. So again. I
really I really don't agree with
that. The way this is written.
Um, I think the words really
matter and we should be clear
about these things so
And yet, I think the premise
here is that you're starting
with carbon producing, and now
we're somehow making it less
carbon producing.
But that still does not include
those technologies that already
do not produce carbon. So let me
move on.
There is on page of three of the
committee substitute reference
to emerging technologies.
And it's my understanding, and I
did used to work at a national
lab.
That a lot of emerging
technologies are actually old
technologies.
So could you explain to us
I mean, a lot of them start on
the drawing board somewhere.
And so could you explain to us
how this definition or this
Observation. Hmm.
Mr Chairman, members of the
committee, um emerging
technology would would be the
same technologies that I
described earlier that have been
started on a drawing board had
been proven in the lab.
Ah to do what the technology set
out to do, but hasn't been
proven to scale.
Uh And so they those would be
that would be an emerging
technology. It's been proven by
science. It's been proven in
small scale operations, but it
needs to be taken to a pilot or
a commercial type operation to
prove it. It's scale in order to
do so. That would be what we
would consider an emerging
technology.
Thank you for that. Answer, Mr
Chair and Mr Secretary and
representative, So I think this
is open to wide interpretation.
And what you just said. I think
it's logical.
But I don't believe this is
going to capture.
What you may think it's going
to, so I just want to point that
out.
Um I do have a one other
concern. Oh, yes. Um, Mr
Chairman Representative, so
starting on Page four of the
billets Section three of the
bill.
Um, we we say that the division
shell
And I'm just going to
Read the verbs. Recruit, promote
work, gather coordinate.
Engage. Identify a stab list
development implement
facilitate.
Established guidelines. Um,
surveys and I'll read this
project permitting navigators.
Identify, provide. So those are
the shells.
And then the maze are and this
is it y nine section b
Subsection B division may
Coordinate with other New Mexico
agencies.
Make enter into an enforced
contracts enter into agreements.
And then that catch all do
anything necessary to cure out
the divisions purposes and I
understand that's boilerplate.
But
My concern here, Mr Chair and
representative is that this is a
whole lot of government control
and government direction.
And I am a believer in the free
market.
And we know we have
A lot of investment at the
federal level. We have private
investment.
We have a lot of technologies
that are, I think coming online
or at least being developed to
come online.
And I just I'm concerned that
the state of New Mexico would
really try to be in the driver's
seat and all these things.
And I don't think the state
Has much at risk because it's
taxpayer money will just spend
spend spend a private investor
is going to look at this and
say.
Is that really a good
investment and Mr Chair
Representative. Remember when it
was Jimmy Carter was president
in the seventies.
And he got Congress to pass a
law that natural gas could not
be used.
Preparer generation and it was a
huge mistake at the time. They
didn't think so.
I thought that was a really good
idea. But over time they kept
amending the federal law.
Realizing they had to fix this
problem they created.
And they ended up eventually
eliminating that so I don't
believe the government knows
best in this case.
And again taxpayer money is
Pretty easy to collect.
And then spend but private
investment.
I think there's money at risk.
And, um, time commitments and
things like that. And I would
more rather trust
The free market and our
utilities.
To know which direction to head
when it comes to energy
production.
So I think, Mr Chair. I know
you're getting ready to
I think I'll leave. I will leave
it at that. Okay? We don't We
work hard not to to make sure
everybody has their time. Thank
you very much representative
from next. We're going to go to
Thank you, Mr Chair.
I think my comments are going to
be very short and to the point
On the Navajo nation. We say
water is life.
And we literally mean
Another thing that that could
mean is leave our water alone.
In very few areas of the Navajo
nation.
We can still taste the real
water. The real mountain water.
No chlorinated water.
When I go down to visit my
sister down in the Gallup to hit
your area.
I have a really, really good
A couple of water.
And it also makes a good cup of
coffee.
You don't taste no chlorine in
it. You don't taste anything in
it.
It is just pure water.
You've talked about.
Emerging technology.
Emerging technology is just a
fancy word.
That means advanced
experimenting.
The reason why
Um
I agree with some of the
comments that were made earlier
at the beginning.
It's because there has been a
lot of experiments conducted on
my never when nation
People came to the nation in the
19 fifties.
When they mined uranium when
they went to war.
They were experimenting to see
if it could be made into an
ammunition.
The experiment was a success.
And it helped him win the war.
They promised that they would
clean up after themselves.
75 years later.
Have they cleaned up after
themselves?
No.
They have not cleaned up after
themselves.
75 years later.
On a promise that was broken. My
people still suffer
contaminated meat that is in
their livestock.
And their source of food.
In their agricultural products.
They still see traces of the
Contamination from the uranium,
Mr Chair and also in that same
area.
They experimented with drilling
oil wells.
Some of them have become very
successful oil wells.
They promised that they would
clean up after themselves after
they got all the oil and got all
their money.
Did they clean up after
themselves?
No.
There are still some holes that
are still unplugged.
And still some pump jacks that
are exposed.
I am glad that nothing serious
has happened on the neighborhood
nation with pump jacks, but a
few years ago
Uh,
Representing Montoya will attest
to this that there was a
Nine year old girl.
That
Mhm with other Children decided
to explore a pump Jack on Troy
King Road.
And that nine year old girl so
the pump Jack moving, so she
climbed on it.
And she was fatally injured.
Those places did not have
securing fences around them.
They Since that accident, they
started putting fences around
the pump Jacks in San Juan
County.
So
Any time that I hear.
Economic or
Emerging technology.
All. It is just a fancy word for
further experimenting.
Experimenting with my people
experimenting with the
livelihoods of my people.
This. I'm all for economic
development because of the mine
closures. I want my people to go
back to work. Yes, but I want my
people to work safely.
And efficiently.
Um, I
I don't want no more
experiments.
In the sense of economic
development.
So at this time, I cannot
support your bill.
Mr Chair.
Met him moisture.
Thank you. Thank you,
Representative Allyson. Next
we're gonna go to represent
Figueroa.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um
And I'm we've spoken at length.
I think about environmental
issues. My questions are more
Mr Chair and Madam vice chair on
the economic Development side.
Um, because I agree with the
basic premise and the motivation
and the urgency involved. I love
the hands, all deck all options
on the table approach.
And I agree with turning the
power of the market towards
dealing with these issues much
faster and more flexible than
government is, um
But I'm not clear in this bill.
What we are getting with the
taxpayer dollars were putting
in. I'm not sure what the target
is on Page three in line one.
Emerging technologies that are
more sustainable, more efficient
or more environmentally
responsible.
But how much more do they have
to be? 1% More 10% or 5%? More?
What? What's the target They
were asking for and towards the
back of the bill that gets a
little closer on Page eight.
With her in line 24 whether the
technology will make a
meaningful contribution to the
state achieving our reduction in
emissions, but again meaningful
is undefined. What's the target?
And if we are Mr Chair using
taxpayer dollars?
I would expect a little more
definition and honestly, I would
expect
Some kind of job creation to be
in there, and it isn't mentioned
on page aid or anywhere else. So
I wondered if that was part of
the goal.
Um, like when we give Lita
grants, there's a certain amount
of job and salary range that has
to be produced. And is that the
intent here?
Hmm. Mr Chair member members of
the Committee, representative
Figueroa.
Thank you for the question.
I
As far as targets, I would point
you to page nine because it
does. It does define
That the things that we're
looking for are directly on in
relationship to the energy
transition act that this body
has already enacted and passed
and the goals
Uh, established by 2030 2040
2050.
Additionally, yes, economic
development is about job
creation. It's about growing the
economy. Um this is the economic
development statute.
As amended.
At this stage. There there is,
There is nothing in here about
Lita.
Uh, that is part of the economic
development division that is
within here.
And yes, it doesn't say anything
about J tip. It really doesn't.
So when we go through the entire
budget process, the lfc process.
uh they will assign, and we'll
agree to what those goals need
to be for this particular
division as far as job creation.
And as far as and as far as what
those goals are, and we'll
agree. We'll work on that
together.
As we do on on all other facets
of so
It's not in the statute, but it
is very much part of the lfc of
the budgetary process. Thank
you, Mr Chair, and thank you,
Secretary.
So it could be defined later and
made more concrete, But it is
part of the intent.
I appreciate that answer very
much, um, with economic
development bills.
That's generally what I look
for. What's the return for the
tax dollars given, But in this
case, it's also going to be
what's the risk Mr Chair
Because, unlike the wheeling and
dealing, we do to bring
established industry to the
state.
This is emerging technology by
definition, a little more risky.
So how Mr Chair and Secretary
you address the risk involved
And is there clawback provisions
in any part of this?
Hmm. Mr Chair members of the
Committee representative Fair
Corolla.
So
Uh, although I'm I'm going to
address this, and there's two
different funding sources here.
11 is a funding tourist to
create the division that creates
the F D. E s that creates the
overall operation. What we're
going to get out of that is
we're going to get people that
are specifically in tune to this
area.
Of expertise very similar to
what we have done with outdoor
recreation. We have
A governors appointed division
director, and then we have
classified people in various
areas that work towards the
goals and the specifics of
outdoor recreation. We do the
same thing in film J Tube Main
Street, etcetera.
They become experts in that
area.
Ah, this is a broad area, so
there's there's probably going
to be five sectors within this
area that they're going to have
to become.
Uh, pointed with and become
quote, a subject matter. Expert
That's what the budgetary
requirements for setting up the
division will go towards
The fund itself. Uh, there there
are some guidelines in there
that there's a maximum amount of
the investment.
It also states in there that
there's a requirement that it's
no more than 50%, meaning.
That there has to be other
resources coming to the table to
fund.
Uh, this endeavor
Uh, it could be. It could be
other public funding or it could
be private funding. It could be
a combination of others so
Is there going to be an inherent
risk?
Um, absolutely inherent risk
with any business opportunity.
Uh, so, uh, but it's going to be
shared by somebody else.
Um, it's not in this statute,
but I don't think any. I don't
think anybody would
Uh, be opposed to, um
Some sort of some sort of
requirement for clawback. I
mean that that makes sense that
if you have a public investment
And certain things. You don't
get certain things out of
And you cease to operate or
something like that, that there
is a clawback revision.
Understanding that if you're
funding a pilot or demonstration
project that you have to define
what the public payback is maybe
But you proved it didn't work.
And that you're employed some
people during that time frame.
You constructed something you
collected? You collected some G
r t some p I t during that
process, and you receive some
net fiscal benefit back to the
state and you proved it didn't
work, and you didn't invest
large sums of money both private
and public into trying to take
this.
Uh, this pilot project to a full
scale operation.
But I don't think there would be
any opposition to claw back.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Secretary. That's encouraging,
And you actually answered a
couple of my later questions One
of the criteria on Page eight is
the viability of the project.
And my question was, how are you
going to determine that and you?
and you clarified that's going
to be experts gathered in the F
T to analyze the project. So
thank you for that. Mr Chairman,
members of the Committee
representative figure out I'd
like to expand on that, because
currently
Right now. We have to grant
programs within the economic
development division.
Called our early early stage
startup grants that are grants
up to $25,000 for very early
stage companies to help them get
started with new technologies,
and we also have what we call a
super matching grants separate
small business innovation
research grant that is awarded
by the federal government.
And faces 12 and three Okay and
and we can provide, and we
provide matching funds. For
those. The point is, is when we
go through those processes, we
utilize the technology Research
Commission.
To that those projects and they
have members from the from the
national labs from our research
universities and from private
sectors to bring us that
expertise to the science to
understand whether those
technologies truly have a
science basis and a bite and the
violence chance. Okay, Thank
you, Mr Chair and Secretary. So
you already have a commission
that does this.
Or you're going to be gathering
experts to do this.
I'm unclear now, Mr. Chair,
representative. Figure out we
would utilize both we would have
in house people that would
become subject matter experts,
but we would definitely continue
to use the TRC as a vetting
energy entity. Okay, Thank you,
Mr Chair and Madam Vice here on
Page six.
Line nine. I would agree with
Rep. Garrett that that may needs
to be a shell with respect to
the first thing.
And, uh, paged Light 19 Page
six.
And agreements to share
employees do any of the other
divisions and Eddie the
Currently share employees across
agencies is that normal or new
Mr Chairman, members of the
committee representative figure
out the Mexico Economic
Development Department has
shared employees with energy,
minerals and natural resources.
the Environment Department and
the Department of Workforce
Solutions in the past, it is it
is not a new thank you. Thank
you, Mr Chair and sponsor.
Top of Page seven. I really
appreciate circled twice and
read the words shall
That there shall be regulation
around his emerging industries
is really important.
Um
Page seven. The funds My
question Mr Chair and vice chair
is why didn't you just use the
growth fund?
To do this as these are pilot
projects.
Um, and that's for pilot
projects to be spent over three
years.
Mr Chairman, members of the
committee. Um, I
I'll admit that I'm not fully
bedded on the growth fund and
Howard
And how it lays out, But my
understanding is is that
although pilot projects are a
part of this, it's not totally
what this fund would be. For
their There could also be, uh,
other grant opportunities. Uh,
for this, So, uh, again a little
bit of ignorance on my part as
to how the growth fund works.
But I from what I understand it
is specific to pilot projects,
And this is a little broader
than that. Okay. Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank you, Secretary. Um
On page a line 15. I think that
may probably should be a shall
as well.
And with the caveat that I would
like to see more definition and
the expectations of what we
would get back. I'll leave it at
that. Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you. Sponsor. Thank you very
much. Represent Figueroa. Next,
we're gonna go to represent
Garcia.
Thank you, Mr Chairman, Thanks
for the presentation.
You know? Listen to representing
Alison over there about the
concerns, you guys.
You know, and I have the same
concerns because, you know
I had a business there in grants
in Milan, and there's a united.
Uh
Homesick statement. There's a
meal there.
They've been trying to reclaim
for 50 years now.
And they're not succeeding very
well what they're doing, so they
bought me out.
Which was the literally put me
out of business because
They were afraid of what's gonna
happen to what's happening with
their part of it and represented
house and had a good point. You
know the minds of their 50 years
ago.
And they're still trying to
clean it up.
And I'm afraid of new things
coming in and then leaving.
And we're stuck with another
problem. You know if you go to
like the church rock mine, and
just the, uh, Easter gallop,
they have really great. Um,
waste laying out in the fields.
They don't know what to do with
it. This is low level.
Which is fine and well, but it's
still concerns be because you
know, like I said that, uh, mill
right out of Milan there.
They've been working on it for
Reclaiming it for 40 or 50 years
now, and I asked the question to
the NRC here a while back.
And they have gained no ground
on it.
Because every year that I go to
the media, Mr Chairman is the
same story we're gaining and
There's no
Proof of what they're gaining
on.
They're always having problems,
you know, And I don't want
another problem, too.
Hmm. Are part of the country you
know, you know, all have a hard
time supporting this bill.
Because of those reasons,
because you know, we need to
take care of the past instead of
putting more in the future in
the we can't take care of
You know and like Mr and mean,
Anthony Ellison said.
You know, life is water.
You know, nowadays you know you
go anywhere like into Hajj Ali.
You don't even have drinking
water contaminated with other
stuff, You know, just making
through, Mr Chairman. Thank you.
Thank you. Garcia Represent
Herndon. Did you have questions?
Did Mr Chair. It's not my turn,
is it? No. You are last before
me. So please go ahead. Thank
you. Um, thank you, Mr Chair,
And thank you, Mr Secretary.
Most of our conversation tonight
has been centered around energy
and be of and the application of
it minerals and natural
resources.
My question to you is why didn't
this department just applied to
expand its own department rather
than going through e. D. D.
And you are here to advocate for
this work.
Mr Chair. Members of the
committee as as the as the
statute, Uh,
Currently exists and is being
amended. The Economic
Development Department currently
has five divisions.
There's two in statute that
don't really exist.
But we have our account services
division. Basically, our CFO.
Ah and and their employees. We
have the economic development
division that does the majority
of traditional economic
development things such as Main
Street, J. Tib.
Leader, the regional reps and
and those services. We have the
film division that does
obviously filled things we have
the outdoor recreation division.
That was instituted.
Five years ago.
And then last year as you'll
recall the Legislature created,
uh, the fifth industry, Uh, the
fifth division within economic
development, con creative
industries.
So that's how we currently
exist. This would add a fixed
division to create a focus
specifically on these issues of
natural resources, energy and
the next generation of those
resources, so it would be a
focus, just like film just like
out to Iraq.
I just like the creative
industries specifically on this
on this subject matter.
Mr. Tear in Mr Secretary, Am I
right in understanding that you
are the acting secretary of
energy, minerals and natural
resources Mistaken, Mr Chairman,
members of the committee. My
apologies, representative. I'm
the acting Secretary of Economic
Development. Oh, I see. Okay.
Thank you very much for that
clarification.
Um
So with respect to that, and I'm
looking at the fact that we had
a conversation, Mr Chair and Mr
Acting Secretary.
We asked. Where was the funding
for this project, and it's
already in house Bill two. So
even if this bill doesn't pass
What difference does it make?
Uh, Mr Chair. Members of the
committee has my understanding.
There is contingency language in
House Bill two.
That is, uh, requires passage of
this legislation.
And then one last clarification,
Mr. Secretary. I'm sorry, Mr
Chair. You indicated there were
other secretaries who were
supportive of this project. Who
are they?
Mr said, Mr Chair. Thank you
very much, uh, represent
Herndon. There are a number of
folks online who didn't get the
chance to speak. I've been
informed who are in support,
including advanced energy and
some other groups, Mr Secretary
or Madam Representative
colleagues. I believe that
energy, minerals and natural
resources and New Mexico
Environment Department
Testified in support of the bill
in the previous committee
committee and remain in support
of the bill.
Okay?
Alright. And then one last
question, Mr Chair in and Mr
Secretary who asked to have this
brought forth
What's the source?
Thank you, Mr Chair and
representative as I mentioned
earlier, Um, there have been
discussions. Um, with, uh, the
three executive agencies. Um
For
At least six months, and Mr
Chair and Madam vice chair is
the group. They asked this to be
brought
Mr. Chair, Representative Noh. I
approached them.
That's it.
Okay. Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you very much upset friend and
colleagues. I want to thank
everybody for great questions. I
have a few quick questions
first. I want to thank
representative Dixon over the
last several years. Much work
has been done on in many areas,
including through the budget
represent Dixon. Last year,
there was resources for cleanup
at San Juan.
Generating station in coal mine
that was part of money that you
helped identify and language
that you specifically worked on.
Is that right? Thank you, Mr
Chair. Yes, that is correct.
Okay. Thank you for that, Uh,
that encompassed other
investments, including advanced
energy and work with the D D,
But I think it
Um, it shows again, really the
opportunity we all have, as
committee members to sort of
bring initiatives forward and to
find ways to support important
areas within the state. Um, next
question.
This is at its core.
Really to economic
diversification and
decarbonization. Is that how you
see the legislation? Thank you.
Mr Chair. Yes. Okay. Also, um,
the there is language in the
bill.
And that, uh,
There are, you know, should
sovereign tribes, nations or
pueblos wish to partner they
can. Is there any language in
the bill that would require
anything of sovereign tribes,
nations or pueblos?
Mr Chair. Members of the
committee. No. Okay, that's good
to hear at having grown up, you
know, first couple of well
Lot of formative time. First two
years in elementary school and
grants.
I take very seriously and I
think we are. We all know that
we're continuing to reckon with
the impacts of past.
Extraction.
Uh,
And and
Uh, representative
As we look at future investments
and work.
Some of that work is very much
in that clean up area.
Some of the work, particularly
with it comes to medals. And
what have you
That's focused more on
extracting those minerals from
things like, produced water,
not, you know.
Nowhere north of I 40
Is that accurate? Thank you, Mr
Chair That is accurate. And one
of the exciting emerging
technologies is retrieving
critic. Rare earth minerals from
produced water and a number of
companies are investigating
that, um, and can be working
here in New Mexico. Thank you
represented by then I know it's
late. We have a couple more
bills.
Out, just wrap up by saying
These are challenging. I think
we've seen it in this
legislature for several years,
and that's okay.
I appreciate everybody who's
working closely and working to
find ways forward. We've found,
uh, the opportunity to make
investments that cleanup past.
Um harms like we did last year
with the advanced energy money.
There. We have to keep looking
for ways to do that work. But
this division and why I'm
excited to vote. Yes, even as I
think there's obviously more
work that needs to be done.
Our chance to diversify our
chance to bring more investment
to New Mexico.
Informed by the wrongs of the
past and focus, frankly on
fixing those while also sort of
securing our future.
Certainly economically, just
importantly from an
environmental perspective.
Uh, you
Thank you for your work. It's
hard. I appreciate everybody and
bringing concerns challenges.
Uh, and others to the table and
just really appreciate the
conversation.
With that I'll go for emotion.
Moved to table, Mr Chair, House

a few words, please.
Please.
Thank you very much, Mr Chair
members of the committee for
hearing this bill tonight. I'll
keep it brief. This bill is
very, very simple. We're asking
for fairness inside
reimbursements through our
contracting inside HST. We have
worked very, very hard with HST
over the last couple of years to
educate them on what the big
PBMs or pharmacy benefit
managers.
Are doing to us when they are
left unchecked.
This will make sure they stay in
check and they reimbursed the
independent pharmacies.
Specifically, there are only 55
of us left in this state of New
Mexico.
55 3 years ago. There were 77
So this will help hopefully
maintain our small community
pharmacies throughout this
state, and that is the purpose.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Ah, Anybody who wishes to speak
in opposition to house Bill 165
is twice amended.
Come on up, please Chairman
members of the committee Jason
Espinosa, president and CEO
within a retail association.
Um
We don't agree, disagree with
the argument that pharmacies
need support.
We just believe that all types
of pharmacies
Regardless of their corporate
structure needed. We've seen all
types of pharmacies across the
country closed their doors.
Everyone's margins are being
squeezed in the Medicaid
reimbursement. Low low Medicaid
reimbursements are part of the
cause.
Um So really, I mean, we like
that fastest committee, uh, you
know, to create equity in this
bill and seeing amendment so
that this applies to all types
of structures of pharmacies, not
just the independent pharmacies.
That's what we'd like to see.
And that's why we do staying in
opposition answers written. We
want to see all reimbursement
rates rise, not just a select
few, because we do think it is.
Dangerous to put in Statue Rate
differential.
For Medicaid. Based on a
corporate structure. We should
keep it the same across the
board. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Anybody else who wishes speaking
opposition.
Anybody online?
Okay. Anybody who wishes to
speak in support.
Please come on up.
Mr Chairman.
First time on this one. So I
feel like I'm getting beamed up
great.
Mr Chairman, members of the
Commune members, Jason Thompson.
I'm the registered lobbyists for
the Mexico Pharmacy Business
Council, also representing
American pharmacies for self I
just really want to thank
The sponsors representing
Armstrong, representative Karen
Jaramillo for their help on
this. Let's see for us now and
also HST Healthcare authority
and just being able to work and
negotiate with us. I will keep
it brief.
Essentially the stuff. This bill
is about fairness and also Bell
viability.
He's small, independently owned
community based pharmacies, both
in urban, but most especially in
rural areas are uniquely
situated in terms of
Burdens that they face and the
challenges that they face on a
daily basis being being able to
provide. I'll keep it there. The
last thing that I'll add just in
terms of
Specifics that we're talking
about community based pharmacies
have a specific type of
characteristic.
Better listed in the Medicaid
contracts. So these are these
are a list of community based
pharmacies that are specifically
Eliminate, delineated and spoken
to within these medications,
contracts and these are the
pharmacies have fruition to
capture with this bill, Where
did you pass? Thanks very much.
Thank you.
Mr Chair members of the
committee. My name is Kim
Ligament. I represent Capital R
x R X is a full service PBM and
pharmacy benefits manager that
serves Presbyterian Health plan.
Transparency and accountability
are embedded in the capital X R
X business model.
Capital R X aims to change how
prescription drugs are priced
and help patients are cared for.
Phil makes a positive step in
the right direction, and I want
to thank the sponsor for
bringing it forward. Thank you.
Thank you. Mr Chairman of the
committee, Larry Harun
registered lobbyists for
Presbyterian health plan. So you
just heard from our PBM. We've
gone to a new model with PBMs.
And so we're happy to part North
Capitol Rx. They do business in
a different way, and we're happy
to bring that to New Mexico.
This bill, what it does is to
get there's a price for the drug
that comes from a national
indexing.
And then there's a predictable
set dispensing fee that will go
to our pharmacist, so I wouldn't
be surprised if you see us back
next year. Looking at some of
these issues again. We think
this is a good piece of
legislation is going to help us
lower the cost and increased
transparency New Mexico so we
can increase access for
patients, so we urge your
support of this legislation.
Thank you, Mr Chairman of the
committee.
Thank you very much.
Any questions?
Represent Figueroa. Thank you,
Mr Chair Line three.
Um sorry. Page three Line seven.
Pharmacy, located in the state
or near the state border.
Does that mean on the other side
of the state border, And can we
make law for a pharmacy outside
of our state? Mr Chair?
Mr Chair. Um
Representative. That's a really
good question. So the state has
been working on cleaning up the
UM, community based list that
they maintain and have done so
since Governor Luhan Gershom
took took the governor's seat.
Um
It specifically has a few
outlying pharmacies that our
independence just outside of
some of the border towns that do
not have access to a pharmacy
within a certain range of
apologize. I do not know that
range that they listed. Um there
are also some other pharmacies
that service some of our native
American population within the
reservation that late lie in the
other state as well because of
those reasons.
Um, but that is
I can't address that We can make
law that says that, but they're
doing it. Um, Mr Chair and
expert. Thank you. I I
understand the definition. I
just don't know if we can
mandate Medicaid payments for
something outside of our state.
But
It's a good bill. I just think
we need to clarify that. Thank
you.
Thank you represent figured out
Vice chair, Dixon.
Thank you, Mr Terry. Thank you,
Representative. Um, I was
intrigued by one of the earlier
comments as to why
There's only is applying to
community pharmacies.
Can you
Explain that to me again.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Madam
Vice chair. What happens right
now is independence really don't
get to negotiate their told what
their reimbursement will be.
where larger companies
negotiate.
Man.
Yes, And my witness would like
to add
Mr Chair, Madam. The other
differences. We are not
situationally the same. I don't
have a 50,000 square foot.
Retail center. Um, funding my
pharmacy and most independence
in the state do not fund their
pharmacies with liquor stores.
The big chains do. There's a big
difference in how we are
situationally based on how we
make money and bring money into
our pharmacies. Hours of service
based and community based
Versus the others.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Representative. Um, do we have
any concern that, um
This would sort of open
Folks to wanting to expand the
reimbursement.
For the full cost beyond
community based
Beyond independent pharmacy.
Mr. Chair representative. I
can't really attest to that. I
don't lobby for them. I
apologize.
Mr Chair. Thank you very much,
And I recognize that it sort of
just followed the other
question and, uh, terms of
forward thinking, um, thank you
very much. I don't have any
other questions. Thank you very
much. Vice chair, Dixon.
Represent Montoya, please.
Representing questions second,
Okay. I real briefly before that
before we take the motion
representative Arms ranking
member Armstrong. This will come
out of the general, uh, Medicaid
allocation that we make, which
this year. Sort of. You know, I
think, tops. Probably $2
billion. Is that right?
Uh, the allocation for Medicaid
tops that but this would be very
minimal. This the where this is
in the budget because it's going
through the EMC O s is in. There
is not a specific line items,
but it's wrapped into that very
large appropriation that we
make. Is that accurate? Yes, Mr
Chairman. It is.
Great.
So it is in the budget. Okay,
let's go to the motion represent
Montoya for the motion
represented Alison for the
second.

adopting that motion seeing
