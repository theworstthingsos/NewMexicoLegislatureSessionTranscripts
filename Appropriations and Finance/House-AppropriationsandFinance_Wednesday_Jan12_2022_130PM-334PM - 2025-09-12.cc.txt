Yes.
Schools the
roots.
Once again and
so why do
you think you know we
gotta start thinking
different at hand be
more efficient than what we're doing
and so this
exploring this option
is a way to kind of think
different. Like
anything I'm always
looking to improve Marian those
may have worked for many years
always looking how to improve
our process to do things
so.
Looking at
this.
Projects. We're
scrambling.
For example is
is hard
really.
Correct
what.
Yes yes the houses
who are clamoring for some
of these
are.
Yes.
Excited
because yeah it is a way
out to where.
These companies
Wilson probably others
identified that problem and working with
local governments recognize
the issues
that.
They are among
others.
The opportunities have.
Become experts in the state
so this is the
sum of
all.
That was the second
property.
You
the
has
some.
Thanks.
Thank you to whoever
muted.

of courtesy to him

last 1 sheet in their
packet number 538
I'm gonna turn this over to our
LFC analysts Amanda
Dick Peddie
thank.
Judy.
Members of the committee can everyone hear
me
okay.
My name is Amanda Dick Peddie I'm
the fiscal analyst for the
intertribal ceremonial office
for the legislative finance
committee azar
chair noted we are joined I
am joined by Kyle Tom
from the
Gallup Indian inter tribal
ceremonial
Association
this is a nonprofit that
has helped organize
the ceremonial
3 years out now obviously
we have a state agency as well
but he's here to say a few
words I'm happy
association we
are also doing I see
secretary gentrify are from
the tourism department
and internet Nikhil
also from the tourism department
deputy secretary
from DFA I believe we
have the money for a
a is that correct
thank you for I Diego
who had something come up.
So I'm going to
quickly go over the differences
between the DFA and the
LESC recommendation
and then I'll turn it over to
us some of our guests for a couple
comments.
So for HSD
by 38 inter tribal
ceremonial office
both recommendations
significantly
increased
general fund to the
agency
the executive
recommendation includes about
$44000
more general fund revenue
the LFC
recommendation
but the executive recommendation
also includes some additional
fund balances that the LFC
recommendations.
For the base or 40
uses the LFC
recommendation prioritizes
spending in the contractual
services category
and that is in order to
increase collaboration
with local
organizations in the
Dallas area.
The executive recommendation
increases spending for
personnel including one
additional FTE
which is not
included in the LFC
recommendation.
Both recommendations significantly
increase spending in the other
costs category and that's
for event planning and
marketing.
For performance analyst
reach consensus on all
performance measures and
targets
I would like to ask is
the real quickly
if you have anything to act for
DFA for the recommendation
portion.
Thank you madam chair and members of
the committee I have no additional
comments for this
agency.
Okay great and then
I am going to ask
Mr Tom here to just make
a very brief comments for
us if you to drive all this way
and he's sitting here behind.
Then I'll turn it over to the secretary
and deputy secretary for further
comment.
Chair members of the community
my name is Khan call of the
president of the governor John with the
intermodal Association

original ceremonial 0 years
ago I just want to say
we finally have a
collaborative understanding with
ICO things are looking really
good to look forward to work
together to plan the best
event which is better because it will

to turn it over to Melissa
Sanchez who has

board
and
I wanted to acknowledge

last

Okay yes the
one.
I wanted to acknowledge
that Mr Kyle Tom
made the trip up there thank you
so much for those
awesome words
Kyle he is the president
of the Gallup inter tribal Indian
ceremonial
Association and they do
good work so
let's get started so
we'll go to the slide
to a page
2
besides.
So the benefits
of events are multifaceted
there is the economic
benefit of bringing outside
money into a community
there is a cultural benefit of sharing
celebrating and in training
cultural values and
traditions and there's the
overall tourism conversion
budget events
have given the visitors
particularly driver
market visitors a reason
to come now instead
of sending events
private provide
proven economic return on
investment and cultural impact
and they are critical to
economy statewide.
So the first Gallup inter tribal
ceremonial was held September
twenty eight nineteen twenty
two and it is 1 of
the City of Gallup's
and the state of New Mexico's oldest
events the ceremonial
features native American
and indigenous
intertribal culture in both
traditional and contemporary
presentations
throughout its century
old legacy in
evolution the ceremonial
has had many caretakers
and is resilience is the result
of the dedication of
generations of
community
ceremonial supporters
additionally thousands of native
American and indigenous
participants some also
generational have
shared songs dances art
and culture that
demonstrate the fortitude of
the native American tribes in New
Mexico and
beyond.
So I seals mission is to
preserve the time honored Gallup
inter tribals of their mobile
event which showcases
and celebrates the
cultural diversity of native
American and indigenous
art heritage songs
and dances
and to elevate this
treasured event
as a global destination event
experience.
The ceremonial has also brought
has always brought together
tribal people from all
directions for
example map the Navajo
people Peublo
Mexico Hopi
payment Apache of
Arizona
Alaska Oklahoma
California Florida
Mexico Otero
New Zealand the
ceremonial also brings an
audience mix of local
regional and often
international
spectators.
The care takers include
city of Gallup McKinley
county Gallup inter
tribal Indian ceremonial
Association New Mexico
tourism department and and
tribal ceremonial office
and you'll see the beautiful
young lady there that's
a photo of the reigning ceremonial
queen amber
Ballenger and she's
from the dentist Navajo
tribe she
happens to be the
third ceremonial
queen from her
family so we'll
go to slide
3.
I would like to thank you for
the appropriation that funded the
cultural asset inventory
I see now has a documented
labeled and cataloged inventory
reference list
additionally the legislative
appropriation last year allowed
my office to do a
hybrid event production
that included the statewide
broadcast of the spirit of
the ceremonial TV
documentary
which simultaneously string
them both K. O. B. T. B.
and Gallup inter
tribal.
Gallup inter tribals
ceremonial websites
and was shown at B. L.
moral Peter in
Gallup special
thank you to the city of Gallup New
World theater and event center
for your partnership on that
additional events were a native
American virtual artisans
market and the inter tribal
ceremonial clean
path.
And thank you to for it to the
Gallup McKinley county chamber
of commerce we're also hosting
and inviting ICO
and the reigning ceremonial
queen to meet the member
business community
that was a great event
and I see also developed
and launched a new website and
digital platforms.
So we're gonna do slide
board.
To hear some of the 2021
TV show metrics just to
highlight some of the data
in particular.
It is important to me to set
goals and benchmarks
this is a disciplined approach to
ensure we garnered strong
return on investment
I'd like to call your attention to the
500000 project
goal which was
surpassed in simple
terms that means
that's eyeballs meaning
the number times content
has seen
other goals were exceeded in several
areas you see here
particularly in the primetime
air window and we
continue to see post event
activity in interest
and we plan to leverage that
for the 2022
event.
So I head straight into
slide 5.
A lot more data here
the showcases the various
advertising platforms we
used.
With unlimited marketing and
promotion budget just O.
advertisement is most
cost effective
however I also
was able to secure local media
platforms media
platforms.
Overall these platforms performed
well in year 1 this
gives us a good jumping off point
for the 2020
to marketing and promotion
strategy as there is
now based to leverage and
capitalize on.
The 2022 strategy
components
include 1 branded
events with intentional public
relations with it within
intentional public relations
campaign to garner urge
media
instead of paid media we want
to really work on that
media.
So gonna go into slide
6 moving along
here.
Yes
hi mentioned earlier
we are pleased to inform you
that collectively with the city
of Gallup and the
Gallup inter tribal Indian ceremony
Association we have
a collaborative plan
one branded event
roles and duties identified
based group.
Through I try to efforts
we believe this will lend itself to
executing a successful
centennial celebration
we are all stronger together
and this course of action
allows all entities to
maximize resources
recognizing the ceremonials
100 year history and
original intent
as well as elements the
community has championed
itself.
The dates will be August 4
214 and the first scheduling
portion is primarily
I see programming
the second scheduling portion will
be primarily Gallup inter tribal
Indian ceremonial
Association programming
including rodeo.
I combined intentions build
upon the consistent theme of the
ceremonial
a native and indigenous
celebration if you think
of it as one will be
8.
I see us identifying a
ticket platform for tracking and
accountability a performance
measures one of which
is number of tickets
tickets sold.
Sponsorships are
in place sponsorship
8 are in play.
I would also speaks to
the 2 other performance
measures which
are percentage of
operating revenue from
sources other than the general
fund and the number
of sponsorships
again the one branded
event means cross promotion
commitments
to buy us all to
obtain a brought in
various audience
reach.
We're gonna head into
slide
7.
The executive recommendation
budget increases general funds
over the FY
22 operating
budget the
executive recommended
an additional position while the
legislative recommendation
includes additional
contract will funding to encourage
collaboration with local
nonprofit and volunteer
organizations.
The executive also expects
that collaboration will
continue but believes
it will be better accomplished with that
additional FTE
the executive also includes
funds for contracts and
other event production
costs.
The consensus amongst
us.
The city of Gallup inter tribal
ceremonial office and
Gallup inter tribal Indian ceremony
Association
was at increased appropriation
was needed. I
thank you all for the
recommendation on the budget
and I ask for any
consideration to maintain
that level and not
decreased decreased
if that is where we land
we will make it work and
recognize that the 100
percent increases
generous however
any consideration to support
the executive budget level is
most
appreciated.
So the LFC recommendation
increases the contractual
services category to support
a virtual modern ticket
platform for the event
and increases other cost
categories the public
safety services
printing costs and various
recurring expenses for
event production that
includes contracted services
and vendors it
is understood that the LFC
recommendation does not
support an additional
FTE for FY 20
thank however
consideration is requested
to make the 200 whole
due to the 5 percent
general fund budget cuts in FY
21 by increasing
that category 290 9000
300 it is
also known that the LFC
is recommendation though not
included in the FY 23
base operating budget
also supports 1 time funding
for the inter tribal ceremonial
office to collaborate
with local entities
to renovate the red rock
state I'm sorry the red rock
park owned by the city
of Gallup where the ceremonial
is held.
With regard to the LFC FY
22 supplemental
400000 and
it's absolute need
to fund the planning of the
centennial a request
that that be sustained
and extend my appreciation
for that recommendation from all of
us. Request
from ICO is to
include an emergency clause
to aid with the cash flow for the
centennial production.
Additionally the FY 22
supplemental will be use on
the personal side
the requested to consider appropriating
99300 to
make the budget hole from the 5
percent general fund cuts
and with that supplemental
contractual services of
700
will be used for the purposes
stated on the slides
there.
Slide.
Again the requests to consider
appropriating 99300
to make the budget hole from the 5
percent general fund cut
in the FY 23 fiscal
year this will cover the true cost
of the executive director
position. We
will continue the production
and contractual service use
of the funds for FY 23
is listed here as you
can imagine we are working on
the planning and programming
for the centennial in
2022 this year
and this FY 23
executive budget definitely will
allow us to understand
what we have to work with as we
come up with that programming
and opportunities presented
after the centennial
we look forward to planning the for
100 and first events with
this budget.
In addition regarding the
red rock park improvement
language in your
recommendation.
We appreciate that the
investment and improvements
need to happen
and we will be sure to collaborate
given appropriation is
maintained to ICO for
that instruction
infrastructure
improvement.
So again I just wanted to thank
you for your time and
consideration
and I stand for
quest questions
thank you madam chair members of
the committee.
Thank you very much Melissa
for that
informative and targeted
presentation excellent
jobs before we go
to questions for
the committee I first wanted to ask
for Kerry strider if
it that concluded her
remarks.
Yes okay and then I would like
to go to Gallup more
blue bunny greedy I'm
having but your your name there
but we're very honored to have you with
us and I was hoping to have
you say a few words it's good to
see
more.
And you are
muted.
More you are muted so we're
unable to hear
you.
The joys of technology we
are there
okay. Come
on now can you hear me
yes Sir we
certainly.
Thank you madam chair
of the Royal Air
boost myself my name is Billy
Bob Brady I am the more
of Gallup and
I give you a little bit of background about
myself I'm a lifelong
resident of Gallup so that means
are very I have not
ever missed a
ceremonial
the other thing is I is
are involved I was on the
ceremonial board from
1998
till 2012
and I was president of for several
years.
My interest in the ceremonial
I'm I'm dedicated I
want to see it happen especially
in the hundredth anniversary
and after a
number of meetings I've attended
I think I see needs
are tended to Gallup inter
tribal Indian ceremonial
meetings and I've
also attended some of the advisory
board meetings
I think we have worked out a
deal I think this is going to be the
biggest and best year that
we've ever had
I see nothing but
professionalism I'm Melissa
can bring to the ceremonial something
that we haven't had years
and actually that is access
to tribes that the
throughout the United States
and I'm looking forward to
that Dudley
and comments
on bring to us
professionalism in the rodeo
era
rodeo is a big part of
ceremonial and last year's
event was probably one what
definitely one of the best
and I look forward to this next
year because I think it
definitely will be back
so that anyway I do
support the what the
LFC is is lining
up for us R.
and I look forward actually to
to the year 2023
for that matter but
the with that
being said the I've just
appreciate being able to say a few
words and again thank you
madam chair.
Thank you more and it's good to
see you as I said one
other thing before we go to the committee
for questions I did want to
clarify on the emergency
clause that you
mentioned
it is Sanchez directors on
just it is my
understanding that
that it will be up to DFA
how quickly the funds
are released
but H.
B. to
is of funds
in that are are available
immediately upon the governor's
signature so
that no emergency clause is
needed I just wanted to clarify
that for the committee
but a really good point that we
needed to make
sure that that we didn't hold
up on that so
all right I will now go to
questions
and I'm not sure how
to see hands
raised but I do know
vice
chair.
I had a point so I'll
call on you for spiced
Year.
And your muted
Representative.
I thank you madam chair I
already put this on my
calendar for the
year. It's
something I wouldn't want to
miss I'm just
curious this is

what I wanted to
know.

Amanda so both the
state agency and the
nonprofit existed
budget we're looking at

the Indian Affairs
Committee that we had in
Gallup where
Mr call Tom

Association was somewhat
find and
it was I was saddened to hear

that everything has been
worked out so that

Rodeo

Tom. You
will just enjoyed just
hearing his broadcasting
of the rodeo event
in addition to showcasing
our culture our
songs and dances

chance to display

invite.

Just an event by itself
so thank you for coming

Mr town did you have a
comment.
Maybe thank you Representative Allison

labor relations board
that's agency code of
379
are with me I think we
have
director Tom
Griego
although
his name is showing up as
Michaelmas yes but
that's okay because we also have the
Coleman C. S. of the department
of finance and administration
are in the spirit of privative
madam chair there
is a
$300 difference
between the 2 recommendations
the LFC recommends
fully funding the agency
requests while
the executive legislative
for $300
less than the LFC
recommendation in the
personal services employee
benefits category I'd now turn it
over to miss test for additional
comments.
Thanks Connor madam
chair members of the committee
there are I would just like to
reiterate like there's no
differences between
that to the executive and
we also came to consensus
on performance measures and
targets
thank
you.
All right thank you and a
director Griego it's if
you have some comments for us we
would love. Yes
ma'am I do have some comments
we have in addition to
the the
recommendations from the
LFC in the from the
executive we have some
additional
supplemental requests of
the special nature that are coming
before you that I would like
considered as
well they come in
really 2 forms
one supplemental
request that will be addressed by
our CFO
Tonya's this
is Sheila
dress that in just a minute but
also in the divisional
requests regarding
salary increases which I'll
be happy to explain to
you. That
would require not only
that increase to the FY
23 budget but
an immediate
capital.
Injection
into the existing
22 budget as well
and I will explain
all of that.
The.
You we are doing
specials and supplementals right now
although we're happy to get a brief
and a brief introduction
on on what you're gonna be
kicked out of the
quick with this I want
the our board chair

viruses.
Should be present and
he wanted to bring to
the.
Attention of the legislative
finance committee
the need
for.
Okay it just means that
are.
Rather
emergent.
In the course planning for
my retirement.
Reuven of replacement for my
position the
need for some additional capital
of that re
stages is so
what we need to ask for
but let me turn first to Tanya
to tell you
about
the
additional request that we're
making on time your
equipment are you available with
us.
Yes
director.
Madam chair
members of the committee
are executive recommendation
with of course the.
You know slight differences
in how the state recommendation
but our special
that the director
is.
Trying to tell you about is
that he's considering
up for his
retirement so the
board and that
okay RP has
expressed a salary increase
for both the director
and the 6 day
distant and it entails
a 10 percent increase
of 23.5
for FY 22
and a 12 percent increase
at 30.2
for FY 23
to bring salaries to more
competitive and attractive
salary to
attract highly qualified
replacement for him
and to get salaries up to
our although our
request for funding at
staff salaries for FY
22 or 23
was not in the initial
request.
The LFC analysts Mr
Jorgensen that there
is support from him in
funding
finding a way to include this
into our funding for
section 5
during the special appropriation
committee hearings
so. Basically
what we are
requesting.
Thank
you.
Director greater was their
additional information you
said your.
Was here yes ma'am
are board chair is trying
to log in I
don't expect that we should
tie up your time.
Except to say that for the reasons
that time you stated
trying to plan for retirement
and bringing the salary up
to the salary
mid range that's already been said
in that gov X..
Obviously we need more cash
in our budget for that purpose
and Mr Myers was going
to address you on
that to make sure that you
understood it was at the board's
direction I'm not
I'm not trying to further my own
masters
sort of the point of why he wanted
to address you.
But I don't think
he made on the call.
With that then I
stand for any questions you might
have all right thank
you very much and what is your targeted
retirement dates
are regionally that date
was targeted for July
one but
we do put
off depending on what
happens with our with our
finances may be put
off until this time
next year all
right all right thank you
very much thank you all for the
presentation we'll go to the
committee for questions
and we'll start with Representative
Crowder.
Thank you madam chair I'm
that figures in on hit the wrong
button a picture
of madam chair when
I.
Going to read through the racing a little
bit ago and I noticed that
the powers that be
have finally after I don't
know how many years come
together and
there is no transfer from
the work comp administration
to workforce solutions
I can recall but
before I came under this
committee representative
Larry Larry Jaga used
to to debate that
issue that transfer it
was a kind of a
sore spot for for a lot of
people and and
it thrilled me to
see that that.
The parties to come together
and and the transfer
is not going to take place in this
year's budget.
And I just couldn't let it go without
thanking all the
players I don't know who did that I
don't have it got put together
but I was exonerated to see
it thank you madam chair
thank you Representative I
remember those conversations as
well.
Madam chair yes
I'm sorry this is I DFA
analyst Simon Miller
I believe that was for a different
agency.
Workers compensation and
and the committee did adopt
the transfer of funding
from workers compensation to
workforce solutions
so so
I just wanted to to make
Representative Crowder aware of
that.
Thank you Mr Miller it seems
that you were
you were exhilarated.
It.
Sure.
Chair I I read volume
3 last night I believe
William.
Lawyers to last night
and I went over to workforce
solutions
and I mean
to work comp administration and
there was a a sentence and they're saying
that the transfer was not gonna take
place so it was
documented in the books that I read
last night and and
then again this morning so
of. Yes
ma'am there's very shortly
after.
But. And
thank you and thank you for the clarification
Simon I see no
other
questions.
Our hands raise
so
vice chair headed out I would go for
you to you for the
motion.
Yeah you're muted.
Chair I recommend the
LFC
recommendation.
All right we have a motion for the
LFC is their
second.
Seconded by Representative
Allison
it is there any disagreement
with that
motion.
Okay seeing none of
the I thank you all very much
and director Griego we may see
you again before your official
retirement hope so
and thank you and Dawn
and please give our best
to your board chair and
we appreciate everyone who worked
on this this
department for us thank
you thank you
ma'am.
All right next we
have
administrative hearings
no we I jumped one
state personnel board and
Connor it's like you are
the on this one as
well.
Yes thank you madam
chair.
With me is still miss my
CS of the department of finance
and administration and we
also have the CPO
director
Mr Ricky Serna
share this
is agency code
378.
So in
total.
The difference we're looking at
is the executive
recommended us 30
percent increase
for the state personnel
office the LFC
recommends
a. Adoption
of 0.4
percent so I'm
gonna start off from the very
top of your difference should will
kind of work are are way down
through the
the highlights of the differences in
these recommendations.
The first thing I'd like to point out
is you'll see in other
transfers the
executive recommended
$102300
more than the
LFC.
Or other transfers the LFC
did not have
would not recommend any revenue
from the source
for the past several years spoke
as requested a reduction
in other transfers
revenue this
revenues generated through
agreements with small
agencies to provide a
shared human resource
services so spoke
partners with agencies
to. Basically
do their their HR functions
for the. For
FY 23
CPO requested the
discontinuation of this
revenue to reflect
the termination of
all shared service
agreements that was
in the the original budget
request so the
LFC remove this
revenue in accordance with the
request the executive
recommends continued use of
this revenue source for some
of those smaller agencies can
continue to partner with spoke
for those HR
services.
I think that's the big difference in
in revenue that I want to highlight
so moving on.
The next difference is.
Of the personal services
employee benefits category
and you can see and be
based
executive recommends
$240000
more than does the
LFC.
The executive recommends
a 7.4
percent increase
to base funding for the
state personnel office
the LFC
recommends.
Point 5 percent
increase and that is
essentially necessary for the
agency to maintain
our current operations we have
a.
Increase
in.
Contribution rates about would cover
that and leave the
agency
still able to maintain
operations of the current
level moving
across the should
you'll see.
Under expansion
the executive recommendation
included 6 R.
$35000
for expansion funding
the LFC recommendation
does not include additional
expansion.
For some additional detail
on that you can look at the
bottom of your
sheet.
Where it says expansion.
The state personnel
office requested
3 expansion
items and they were
first 6 after
the.
I'm.
LFC recommendation did
not include
funding for any
of the 6 FTE or
additional FTE
of the reason why is currently
expo has
31 of 44 positions
filled so they have
a vacancy rate of
30 percent that's been pretty
stable over the last
several years the the right
it's sort of oscillated between
probably 25 percent
40 percent.
In addition in FY
21.
Appropriation.
Appropriations to
spoke 4
570000
more than actual
expenditures
so there's nothing in the LFC
recommendation that would prohibit
spoke from using that
570000
issue in
savings to reclassify
any of those vacant
positions that's
the
explanation for the
LFC
recommendation on
expansion
and then last
with in the
other category you'll see a
$250000
difference there.
The LFC recommendation
would fully fund the
agency requests.
While the executive
recommends an additional
200.
$50000 for
marketing.
Finally I just like to point out
so the CPOs are
2021 audit came
out it is
clean there are no
findings
on. I'd now
like to turn it over to Mr Misia's
for additional
comments.
Madam chair members of the committee
I just kind of wanna.
All of points that Connor and
maybe and just provide
a little bit more detail
the executive legislative
additional funding within that
based the executive
provided a vacancy rate
of 9.9 which funds
about 39.7
F. T. E. and
contracts
for the FY 22
funded vacancy
rate they have
about a 16.2
for state can see right for the
agency so that only
cover
36.9 F. T.
E. which is about 7.one
on funded
as it stands for that
base without
any additional FTE
the LFC recommends about
a 15.7
percent vacancy
rate so they
only provide the agency
with
37.one F. T.
E. it's really
not sustainable for the agency
they really need that funding
so that they can you
know expand services and
provide additional services
for HR for the
agencies
state agencies and
then that
250000
for marketing that
will be utilized by the
agency to assist
with any rapid hires to
get you know to
market state agency
jobs and to
assist with any other
additional areas that they
can improved and
for hiring additional
positions across the state
agencies and
then for the expansion
portion the
executive recommended
6 expansion
FTEs which included
on it administrative law
judge to help with
the case load back
he said for
additional HR analyst
within the department and a division
director for data
analytics
the executive also included
2 additional
FTE on top of that
so 8 total
which includes at
position for a marketing
analyst to kind of
assist you know
with the rapid
hires an additional duties to
trying get you know
state jobs out there into.
The market so we can retain
and attract
new employees
for state government and then
also a special projects
person
the special projects person I will
leave that up to the directors to
kind of provided
additional information but
overall the special projects
percent will be deployed to
state agencies
to assist them with
HR functions in the
event that they lose an
HR manager
so it continues you
continue agency operations
for that
and that concludes my
presentation I
will turn it now
over to director
Sir.
Thank you welcome director
Serna.
Thank you madam chair if it's all right
I I have a power point
that I'd like
to share if that's okay
of
course.
Everyone can everyone see
that.
Yes.
How that works when we
get this
moving.
Okay is that better you don't see all
the upcoming flights
correct correct thank
okay great thank you
again are we concerned all of
the acting director for the state
personnel office and
and although
there's just 8 slides here
so all just a.
Touch on on those most
critical to the budget which I kind
of highlighted in green
Torrez and Greene anyway you'll
see our vision mission and
values here and I want to highlight
some of the FY 21
outcomes
just to give you a sense because we are
talking here about
37
staff right that
worked provide each our help
support 66
agencies
departments commissions over
17000 employees
$870000000
in a role
offering over 200
training
these workers
we also responsible for
conducting audits for compliance
with state personnel board rule over
1100 of those
we processed over 4000
actions
in partnership with state agencies
and of course
completed.
0 each local hires
and we highlight external hires
course because thank you
both of them we are at capacity
to state government.
Here again with the F. T.
E. surely
there are authorized FTE
in the area of 44
but as you as you're well aware
due to forced vacancies were
really
because Miss Iglesias
at about 37.one
FTEs I wanted to show
here what's happened
to spoke with T. he counts
relative to state government
counts because we do provide
statewide support
to the state workers
you'll see that steady B.
B. decline
over the past 10 years
but you I also want to call your
attention to the table at the bottom
because over the last
3 years we've been able
to manage our
budget appropriately
to get to that
37 F. T.
E. so right now
of the 37 F. T. E.
that we can afford
we only have one vacancy
and so all of our positions
are filled as of this week
there were 3 that we made offers
to
last week so
those 3 new employees are coming
on board we have one in current
recruitment stage
are we've done a good job
of getting to a place where now
we can are we have
in place the F. T. E. that
we can afford to have in place
I do want to point that
out.
The things that we do for state government
this the the
HR services at the very top
is critical
I will that interim
HR support that you see
there on additional key functions
is paramount so
we have identified that over the
course of the economic
reopening there have been
a few
specific classifications
that job we have
struggled with in
terms of retention across
all state agencies one
of those areas is human resources
and the others finance as
you're well aware Senator
private sector employers are
are are able to recruit
over state lines providing
job opportunities New Mexicans
about them having to leave
the state so
we are looking to bring on
what we would call a trigger to
nature or person
to that we can
deploy our within an
agency loses
a critical HR
person that
we can loan them
and and perhaps
fill that gap and then
search collaborative lead you're
trying get that position filled
very quickly
we do everything for the adjudication
process which is the final
administrative appeals process
for state process right
workers as you
all always the primary
agency on billing
with labor relations and chief
negotiator for
the executive.
Of course everything from recruitment
training and development records
management and compensation
classification rate which is
the division that
sets the philosophy
Policy workers are compensated
and to bring up that lost
the.
For your information on what's staffing
and because the rates look like for
all are classified
employees in state government
you'll see here on the right hand side
the quick Act planned so
what we can see rates of look like
going back to December of
2016 the most
recent check in and
of last month at the 3
percent to be
sure we've seen
this.
Well
redeploy like many others
in that we've seen
a lot of mobility as
workers have leverage the opportunity
to for increased
rates hourly
rates on the heels of
the economic reopening
the pandemic the fuel
spear were hovering about 23
percent which is the only a
lot of what works thank you
over the past several weeks
which is
expedite the hiring
process rapid higher
ribbons the
more. A
400 are
the San just
140
hires right
can move that we can see right
just 2 percentage points
so we've been
trying to creative solutions to
really address the right
understanding of course that
in FY 21
of all the vacancies we filled
about 50 percent of them were filled
with existing state workers
which is good for promotion ability
but again it creates this
perpetual space we're
constantly
hiring.
All as you know the state personnel
office has been a leader
in the state of New Mexico
for your responses pandemic
so like all other employers
over the last few months
there have been a number
of things that have taken
place to protect.
Who is centrally implement
policy on telework
issue with you
the implementation of COVID
mitigations measures
policies is
is a space that we obviously
took a lead on and that
is the policies and the
enforcement training on those
policies to ensure that as
workers return to the office
that they're all safe.
We of course are more
responsible for the guidance
on the day to day implementation
of all executive orders and
public health orders as they
intersect with
employers and
and working conditions are on
COVID education
so certainly we've
been working closely
with the governor's office the
department of health
and more recently with the
apartment in Ocho on the
implementation of federal the
yes Representative
we've also been the lead on
implementing critical hiring
limitations during the period of
of having you want certainty so
as you know for peer to I'm due
to our uncertainties
around state revenue
projections we
work with agencies to be
very critical about what
positions we were going to fill
in when we were going to fill in to
ensure that we were being
cheating healthy budget reserves on
an agency level.
We also been working to develop
creative solutions aimed at critical
staffing needs related to public
health priorities as you know
in some areas we were kind of
hoping hoping the line
occurrence if they can see rates but
in other areas we
were ramping up for example
the need for increased contact
features and and the state personal
office integral to getting that
work done over the
department of workforce solutions for
example ramping up at the number
of employees we
had available to helping agents so
those are a couple of examples of
how we've worked on
in partnership with the agency to wrap
up very quickly and then of
course we're
working to address
some of the vacancy
rate that
arise from that pandemic
driven off
recession.
A critical priorities are really
driving the funding increase that
you see on the executive recommendation
madam chair members is
are we are really working to
increase employee retention
that's big right we know
compensation is critical and
that's basically the state
personnel office played a leadership
role in
developing a compensation
recommendation that's built
on our on
really moving the needle on
employee compensation and I'll talk
a little bit about that
right now we're really looking at
strategies to market and promote
the state government experience for
existing workers by
the okay we refer
to computation
I think is you know for a long
period of time state government was
the place to be between
retirement and health
benefits but we know that
we need to talk about other things
that are available to them and we right
now don't have the resources to
put that out on to just
the workers and
then of course we're doing a lot by
way of capturing a
statewide level reasons for
separations among state
workers for example
a couple months ago we rolled
out a statewide
of the statewide
I'm exit survey that
all agencies must participate
in so now we are
one making sure that every
agency has an exists we would
be able to work with you
we're rolling that data up to see
what it looks like on the aggregates
we can address those
present. We also
need to do something but we have talent
acquisition in right
now we we
essentially post positions
at CPO does state that in in
the US and we hope that everyone
comes and looks that right
aside from that you know we
use your your very
cheap
and probably most effective
ways to promote state
government agencies to the rest
of New Mexico and even proposed
relief we locate
Mexico work
so we really need
money both in terms
of resources to pay for
a marketing on on
television but
also for staff to guide that
in the that effort
we're working on measures to
reduce time to fill vacancies
as you may know we're
responsible on the front end
to be sure positions are out
posted in in recruitment
but there are a lot of agencies that need
help with strategies to complete
that's our process quickly
and then other staff resources
are necessary to do our part
on the processing
of actions and
so what we're looking additional
analysts there the
struggle for us when we hire
HR analyst the state
personnel office as they become
jacks of all trades
in very quickly after a
short period of time with the workgroup
gets to where it's been
recently they realize
that they can make the same amount of money
if not work if not more
working at an individual agency
or perhaps they might be assigned to
the division so we
do need to be remain very
competitive.
Last me all the compensation
recommendation just to share with
you all and I know this is not part
of the state personnel office
budget recommendation
but we do want to leverage every
opportunity for you all to
talk about it all
we did play that leadership role
in developing the strategic
community compensation reputation
that we will discuss with you
all over the next several
weeks and the
outcomes of that plan is a very
transparent process it
in partnership with unions
we work for 6 months in
partnership with afternoon C.
W. A. Representative D. W.
and DFA reps
the developer compensation
recommendations that
operative our
recommendation includes a
$15 an hour minimum
rate of pay for classified
workers in state government
which is which is big
at and at the same
time it breaks in a strategy
for addressing compaction right
we don't want to just simply
say there are 1200
workers under $15 an
hour let's get a mall there
because you have them making as much
as their supervisors now in
some instances and then
you have the supervisors thank you as
much as chair so be really baked
in a strategy to address
compaction and
then of course on the back end of all
those things something a lot of state
agencies are probably talk to
you about in the context
thank you debate is we
will then adjust the pay
ranges the a bands for
state government sure that
we're competitive now
typically when you roll out
a 7 percent
increase across the board
you're going to give that to state workers
to admit the probationary period
but then the incoming workers
they only leverage that increase
within their appropriately
placed next to those workers
so it makes it difficult
to leverage a 7 percent
increase across the board
in the spirit of talent
acquisition right what
we're doing is something for workers
today in doing something that's
meaningful workers at having
gotten here yet and
so we're excited to
show right what are compensation
recommendation dust
for the lowest paid workers in
state government right now
at the very top you'll see right
now for all. State workers
the average rate is
$20.07
after the implementation of our
recommendation increases
on average by 7
percent of that
the bottom line is a step percent
increase to compensation but
what we do is
we do all that out right
prioritizing around the lowest
paid workers and so
you'll see that the average increase
for workers in the lowest
rate down just 33
percent are
for those in the lowest
second to the bottom pay band
the average increases
30.
I think we speaking peppers you
all know that to move a worker
from 1150
to $15 an hour you're
talking percentages about 30
percent to get them where they need
to be so what we've
done is a staggered
approach that really does get
us there on the 15 an hour
anymore but it ensures
that every worker gets
something so
I I did want to just
leverages opportunity improve you
all to talk about that but also
we answer any questions you
may
have.
All right thank you very
much director
Santa and I really
appreciate the
attention to compaction
because I think that
some of those
critical things that that
really hurts morale sometimes
so thank you for that if
you could stop sharing I'd be
able to see
my panel here
and and go
to committee
questions and
that we will start with Representative
Crowder.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you for The presentation
it was a very thorough and
deep dive into person
appreciate that I just have
one question in it has
to do with
your.
The reversions made
from spoke I
noticed in the
FY 20
reverted.
654000
in the last year
585000
what what was the difficulty
in in being able to put that money
to work.
How can you were forced into
regarding at.
Sure madam chair representative
if I can I I mean I came
over to state personnel office
less than a year ago so I can certainly
speak to the FY 21
reversion we went
through a period of time or turnover was
pretty rapid here I
think we ended the fist that
the FY without a CIO
without a CFO
short a deputy director
for CPO and and
actually in recruitment another
division director
Representative week we did like
all other agencies both
your time with us
significant over
and and that certainly was a major
contributor to
the to
the reversion
at the end of the day.
Okay well I appreciate that thank
you. It's my
understanding that
it is permissible
to shift some
of your funded
vacancy or are monies
from absent
employees or whatever
you can ship those to do
increases.
For other employees
I'm assuming you did try
to retain
those employees that that
left is that correct.
Madam chair representative that you yeah
you'll see you'll see actually
that we did especially after
we we lifted the
hiring limitations
are several months back
we saw that surge of work
coming to for work based learning
team and we did
roll out some
temporary increases
for them as well we
did do that in a couple of instances
to retain some workers that were
critical to the organization
but we always do those things
through temporary measures
understanding that not knowing
what our subsequent fiscal year budget
will look like my not
permit us to sustain that
well about keeping a low
vacancy rate.
Thank you I appreciate that very much I was
just curious when
I saw that in the rivers thank
you madam chair.
All right thank you very
much Representative
I don't see any other hands
raised I do
want to
to comment that it it's not the
irony is not lost on me that
the focus of the
difference in the personnel offices
person else which
of these conversations are
ongoing as you know
and that and so we
will take a motion
now from my faced here have
just just with the
understanding that we will
you know continue to look at
these and these are simply recommendations
for Committee so
vice chair how data
madam chair recommend that
we adopt the LFC
recommendation.
Is there a
second.
Thank you.
I saw a second
from Representative
Crowder is anyone
opposed to that
motion.
And I don't see any so thank
you very much
director sort of a
great presentation and
for the great work that you're doing
thank you to our
analysts as well I appreciate
it.
All right our next
are next category
is administrative hearings

340 and it looks like
Jessica has many is our
LFC analysts so
Jessica at the would get us
started.
Thank you madam chair thank you members of
the committee a good afternoon

I will go ahead and start with
the did she
for your first page starting
with the differences in
revenues.
The LFC recommendation
fully funds the
request.
And now but exceeds
the executive recommendation
by
1.$6000.
Appropriation this is a
reflected a function of
5.6 percent increase
over the FY 22 operating
budget for the overall agency
as well the
executive applies and
vacancy rates the LFC
again fully funds the request for
person of
the LFC recommended a
decrease in other costs
for things like travel I.
T. and office supplies
that is almost fully offset
by the increases per person
which is where that 1.6000
comes from where is the executive
fully funds the request in the
other category
this is the transfer
to person is primarily to
allow for filling up
vacancies I'm
in regards to language of
both executive LFC
recommendations included
language that allocates
funds to the agency
from the motor vehicle suspension
fund this is
$165000
and also the department received
fund from the Human Services
Department this is
for the cost of conducting
hearings under the Medicaid
provider managed care act
and this is a total of $50000
that gets transferred
analysts have come to consensus on
performance measures and targets
and I will go ahead and handed over to Cindy
for additional
comments.
Thank you madam chair members
of the committee I don't

I gave a version of this
our point in the interim
so I'm gonna skip through many of the
slides and just find a few
updates as we go it's only
9 slides as a
set of try to be relatively
brief.
This slide on page
2 talks about the work in the
office I'm not going to cover this
other than to say since the
Intrum we have filled
our 2 vacant positions
affected Monday we are
fully staffed with the
exception of the
one position
that that was
discussed they're
trying to provide additional funding
and that was one of the core
part appropriation
request
sh.
The previous fiscal year
just at a high level we did
226.9
hearings for hearing officer
on the staff it's
really 2 main hearing types
1950 to apply
consent act what license
revocation hearings
and 277
you tax hearings
and we also did 25
hearings for other agencies and I'll
touch on them a little bit later
in the presentation
this slide is just a
highlight of our tax docket
over the years some of
you were may remember a few
years ago are taxed docket
was exploding well
beyond our capacity
it's stabilized somewhat to a
more manageable level although
it's still a stress on our
and capacity to
do those hearings
and it just briefly the
pandemic we saw 43
percent reduction in our
implied consent act you are
license revocation
hearings. We
did most of our hearings during the
pandemic via video conference
but we we started
up video conference and
telephone and we restarted
in person hearings this
summer although we've
restarted in person hearings
most people including
the drivers and their
defense attorneys and the police
officers still
prefer Video Conference hearing
so we anticipate that
will continue
moving forward because
we did have that reduction in
our court a hearing
and one of our core hearing types
we tried to
find some extra benefits to
the state by reaching out
and working with other
agencies including
some that are on your agenda
here today we've been
doing hearings for the state
ethics commission
the board of nursing we have an
agreement with the medical board of the
we have a hearing with them
yet and
also the secretary of state's
office we've done hearings
with.
We're experts in administrative
law in
educating administrative
protests so we think
we can do these more efficiently
and at a cost effective
rates compared to having
these agencies contract out
with private attorneys are private
your officers and
we envision that will continue
past the
pandemic.
Our current
budget.
In in FY
22.
We're pretty tight
as a result of the
the last 2 budget cycles
we've got a 9 percent total
reduction in our operating budget
since the pandemic
and because of that we had to make some
tough calls along the
way and the
biggest call we've had to
do is in FY 20 you
all approved a new
position for our agency
but we never been able to fill it because
immediately we have to do that
first 4.5 percent cut
and then another 4.5
percent cut in the last
18 months and we've used the
money provided for that
funding to
question those cuts and
not have to cut in other
areas although
we've had some reversions in the past
2 years our current budget
does not look like we're going to have
much if any reversion
this year we cut pretty
fan.
Our reversion in FY 21
and and no Representative
Crowder is interested in
and some of the reversions and the
transfer so I'll just
preemptively talk about
FY 21 we did revert
some funding
because we never
got HSD
transfers funds to us
each year to
do.
Fraud hearings and we
never got any requests in
FY 21 so we return
all that money so most of reversion
in FY 21 is related to
that and a few other
minor things but that was the
majority of the reversion
and then in FY 20 we did
make intentional choices to
report money
given the uncertain fiscal
climate of the early days
of the
pandemic.
So are appropriation request
in FY 23
we initially sought
a 7.7 percent
increase to address some
of these cuts that we made
along the way which would
still result in less
budget than before the
pandemic.
The main thing that we
wanted to achieve
was enough funding
to fully higher
the executive assistant on
funded position that you all approved
in FY 20 I
know any executive assistant
is not considering all the
problems you all face in the
priorities it seems
like pretty low hanging tree
that that up front
but the reason why
we have this executive
assistant is to provide
additional HSD
management's at
assistance and operations of the
agency so the chief hearing officer
can focus more on the substantive
work agency which
is managing the docket Tax
Stockett and
educating
complex talks
cases at any
given time and our agency we
have hundreds of billions of
dollars of tax
protests in dispute
and that's real money that affects
you as as
appropriators and and
crafting your budget and
that affects businesses and
taxpayers across the state
we're trying to figure out what their
liabilities might be when
they decide whether to grow or
expand in Mexico
so although we're a small agency
in an executive assistant
position is
is.
You know not
maybe exciting you
can have a real impact because
it will help me as the chief hearing
officer focus on resolving
those cases faster
which helps you when you budget
and helps the businesses when they
decide where they want to
expand.
The other thing I would just wanna
highlighted this is new
for me and for my to talk too much
about this from the interim
committee presentation
we also want to
in FY 23 we
want to develop a
comprehensive case management
system it's usable
and accessible to our hearing
participants we
sort of want to leverage the things
we've learned of the pandemic
electronic systems and
hearing process sees we
developed to deal with the
pandemic leverage
them into a comprehensive case
management system that will benefit
the hearing participants
and improve the efficiency
of our results
we want to allow online
court filings in access
to case files just like point
system currently has
we think this will improve the
customer experience for your
participants
again that's taxpayers
business people CPA
is that's law
enforcement officers defense
attorneys you know
regular citizens Representative hearings
before us and
that makes the hearing process more accessible
to everyone and it makes it more
transparent and
we also think there this
will allow us to improve our
docket management
and internal accountability
this will lead to improved
effectiveness and
efficiency
of disposition of cases
that allow us to manage our
workload and assigned
works more consistently
to different hearing officers
and improve statistical information
for generating reports things
we can share with the Legislature
were internally with hearing
officers to
to tie into the accountability
provision.
And I think the the
2 analysts summarize the
recommendations quite well so
I won't go too much over
the slide they're
generally in agreements they're
both providing
other.
Transfer funding
165000 from
motor vehicle suspense funded
50000 from HSD
for conducting those hearings
I think the executive recommendation
is a 6.2 percent
increase in let's see
recommendation is 6.3
percent increase
the only real difference in
and I realize that that
isn't today's
purposes and to talk about
specials a supplementals
the only real difference I see is
that the executive as I
understand it is
supporting
150000 to
develop a comprehensive case
management system
and LFC currently it's not
the end of the recommendation
however in talking to miss
its then I think that
she does generally support
the idea and she
suggested that she's going
to. To
appear in front of the appropriation
committee hearing to try to get it
included in section I
was just the way it came in
and the way it was structured it's not
initially there but I
I don't wanna miss be permissible
but that's my understanding is that
LFC will ultimately
support that as well and try to get
that section
5.
And with that and obviously
we understand you're gonna make
recognition recommendation
you're gonna make but I'm here to answer
any of your questions Sir
dive in more detail
any of the things I try to quickly
cover. Thank
you. All right
thank you very much
chief hearing officer vanden
Center and I guess
it just got I did want to
ask you what did that
specials requests not come
in on our time frame
or what what exactly was the
tuition there
Madam chair on thank you for bringing
that up chief
hearing officer vented
so this was a we believe
it was a technical
error.
Budget system we
believe the request was categorized
incorrectly and so it
was it was
received and
reviewed in one
place and then we recommended
it get moved to another place
and not technical adjustment just did
not get made and
so as
I've mentioned generally
LFC I
have a list I can expressed support
for this and we
would potentially
like to consider
adding this potentially
during the US section 5
hearing on Saturday so
that could be a potential item
for consideration for the committee
but generally speaking
that that is correct and it was
more generally a an error
with
categorizing the request
in the budget system
okay excellent thank
you and because the
2 budgets are so
close
chief hearing officer
vendors and I am I
am.
Going to assume that the
executive assistant position
which was funded
but then not funded
through the years is not funded
in these budgets is that
correct.
Chair members the committee actually I
think the way it
was structured as they have provided
additional money and the category
200 so we will be able to
hire the position sure
some other areas that were
not.
Add it back in but
primarily the increase is
to the 200 so we
can hire that position
okay all right excellent I got
a little lost in their
somewhere so I don't
see any questions from
committee members but I will open
it up to them in case someone has
has a burning question
for our administrative hearings
office but
not seeing what I will go to our
by your head out of for the
motion.
Thank you madam chair and I move
the ad that the committee adopt
the executive
recommendation.
Is there a
second.
Thank you thank
you Representative small
with the second is anyone
opposed to that
motion.
All right thank you
again Mr and then send
and for analyst so you
created in the state
a very thorough
presentation in a short amount of
time.
Helping us do our job better so
thank you very much thank you
be well. You
as well all right we are
on the ethics commission
and it looks like
Jessica hits minutes are analyst
for this one as well so Jessica
I will hand it off to you.
You so much madam chair members of
the committee I'm joined again
by us in the month way
it was filling in for Diego
Jimenez who is not able to
be here
with me you for the agency
the ethics commission this is
agency for
10
we have Jerry Ferris executive
director and Wendy
George the finance and
administration's
director we'll go
ahead and start with your differences
sheet has noted
your volume to associated
documents can be found on pages
140 and
141.
I'm sorry what the differences in
revenue the
executive recommendation
for general fund revenue
exceeds the legislative
recommendation by
83.$9000
this is primarily due to differences
in person and related
costs the
LFC recommendation provides
funding for 2 additional
FTE this is for
an attorney and a paralegal
but the LFC recommendation does
not support the addition of a database
administrator those that was
requested the executive
recommendation does include
that additional FTE along
with 91.3000
that accounts for the difference in person
that you can see
instead of wrecking recommending
the database administrator as
an additional FTE
the legislative recommendation does
include an increase of
$25000
in contractual
services to help meet
that need.
And then in addition the
executive recommendation
includesd
17.6004
lease costs to
accommodate those additional
FTE which the LFC
did not support
analysts have also come to consensus
on performance measures and all
handed over to miss one Toyota
for additional costs.
Thank you again madam chair members
of the committee I just
wanted to make a brief statement
in regards to the database
administrator position
it is my understanding that the
executive recommended
this because
there is a contract
that is currently
with someone who does at
database admin for them
but it is not enough
for a full time employee
to assist to the agency
with the needs that they
need for the information
technology requests along
with the additional FTE
there asking
and requesting and we recommended
this additional full time F.
T. and that's where you'll see the
additional 83.9
I also wanted to point out that the
current contract that they have
just not provide or
perform the range of duties that
the database administrator would
be doing on a full time
basis with that
I'll turn it over to director
Faris for
any
comments at a
presentation.
Thank you good afternoon
madam chair members of the
committee
the state ethics commission as you know
as a
constitutional
executive agency created
by article I section 17
of the constitution
to remind you we we have
3 main
constitutional statutory
duties first
we investigate and
adjudicate third
party administrative complaints
that are filed with the commission
second we
initiate
and brigade
civil enforcement
actions to
enforce those statutes
that we oversee
and third we
publish advisory
opinions published by
the New Mexico one
source by the compilation
commission.
And we find ethics trainings
around the
state.
Those those duties
ranged over
critical and you
statutes to
the state of New Mexico the
procurement code the governmental
conduct tax the
campaign reporting act the financial
disclosure Act that's our
main are made sent to
these in addition to
those main duties
under the constitution the legislature
can task the commission
with with other duties
which it has done
we had we had an appointing
role with respect to the
citizen
redistricting committee
and we help staff that committee
during its work over the
past year
and also recently as of
January first twenty twenty
two the the
legislature moved
responsibilities for the
education of
administrative complaints against
notaries public from
deregulation licensing
department to the state
ethics commission
so we we have an enormous
range of of
responsibilities
and we are handling this
currently with
550.
It's it is utterly
unsustainable for this agency
to handle its
constitutional and statutory
duties with 5
FTE and
so in our
FY 23 budgets for
request we requested
an amount 1.27
7000000 which
is sufficient to
fund 99
FTE through
FY
23
I'm I'm very
encouraged that both the
executive and
the the LFC
recommendations
are near what's
the the
commission as requested for FY
23 the executive
recommendation is 100
percent of the commission's
request the LFC
recommendation is
93.4 percent
of the commission's request
as you've gathered from the
analysts the difference between the
2 recommendations
comes down to whether the
commission can can
hire
1 that that
north FTE
at some point
in in FY
23
were only able to to
do the work that we do now
with 558
because we have a very
very talented staff
communications director
graduated summa **** laude from
you UNM
our general counsel was editor
in chief of the unit large
you and was of federal Clark
our our CFO was
the budget manager DFA
and came over with me to start
this agency
our system deputy general
counsel is a career
litigator with firm
experience and and experiencing
internet general's office.
The people you want around you
that talent that's what you want to
run around you when you're
starting a state
agency
but we're not Google
we're not apple the chance
we can't plan to always
have that kind of
talent in in the
future of this agency
and so strategically
thinking about how how
to set a
constitutional agency
on on a long term putting
we just need more people we
need to institutionalize the
rules a little
bit more and
and so we're we're requesting
the the
the 1.27 7000000
for for 9 FTE
and madam chair I'm I'm going to stand
for any questions that that
you are the the members of the committee
have thank you.
Thank you director Ferris
and you kept mentioning I
FTEs I'm showing 6
years that 6 including you
or what did I
miss madam
chair of the
the.
The commission has 6
FTE on its on
and so on and so
well
we had to take up budget
decrease in FY 22
so currently in FY 22
we only have funding for
I FTE we had
to let some some some
a gentleman go our special projects
coordinator to we had to let
him go
after the the citizen
redistricting committee concluded
its work week we lost
we ran out of funding for that
position the plan for
that position is to re classify
it that's
that's one of our few examples
Isshin Star one of one of our few
got expositions the
plan is to re classify that
position from a special
projects coordinator to
position to an inch
Attorney one gov
exposition
we've we've submitted
a bar and have had the bar
approved
for pouring
in money to fund that
position for the remainder of
FY 22
starting in
February I'm very
pleased to announce that we've we've
hired an excellent
attorney
we we took a from the rusting
Donatelli Fuhrman Santa
Fe Casey you
hear will be joining us in
February and
and the FY 23 request
continues to funding for
that position through FY 23
madam chair thank
you I appreciate that we get
lost in the numbers sometimes
and there's always a story behind
it so I appreciate that
I'll go to my committee now and
we'll begin with Representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam.
Hold
on.
The joys of
technology.
Okay sorry about that
thank you for your presentation I
was curious to
know to
if you could talk a little bit about
your reversion
it for FY 21 you
can.
Thank you madam chair representative Armstrong
I'm happy to do that
we reverted money in a couple of
categories
and and in the 200
category the person
category the reason
why it took us a little while
to get to get fully staffed
up we had a bit of a
dispute with spoke about
the proper classification
of the
of of the the director
of administration finance our
CFO position
Mr disposition
the the commission took the
position that that that
position really ought to be
and a one position
that that position right now we
have one classified
staff member who is handling
all aspects of
share HR
ensure financial I mean
that's that's that is an
entire HSD department
and this this goes to my point about
sound experience we can
only do that was one person
because of the storage came over with
me for DFA and
completely understands
how help sherry
charger financial words
and is able to help with the audit
functioning
the worry is that you know
after major moves on in her
career to to
be able to successfully recruit
an individual who has
comprehensive knowledge of in
HSD department
we really need that to be in a
one and
and so we had we had a bit of a dispute
with special about that about the
proper classification
and that dispute meant that it was a
little bit took a little time
to fill that position is
currently a staff manager position
I maintain that it it still needs
to be in a one position
but in order to convince both
for to be in a one that
position has to
supervise to
classified staff
members personal service
members and that's also why
we need the 9 FTE so
we can put both of those
individuals under the supervision
of the staff manager
and and then reclassify
that in into an a
a one so that that that
position is kind of institutional
except for the future
in the 300 category
we reverted money for a couple
of reasons the first
is we we we. We
had contracts set
aside for
hearing officer services
we have hearing officer
contracts
with
a show
as
chief hearing officer of Indians and
mentioned they H.
O. handle some of of
our hearing officer services
that's normally for kind
of
person state
person in the classified service
who might be responded in a
6 K.
and in other
ethics cases that are better more
high profile that you're likely to
read about in the paper
those ethics cases
are handled by.
Hearing officers that we contract
with either retired
justices of the New Mexico Supreme
Court or retired
federal federal magistrate
judges and
we we set aside hearing officer
contracts for those
those those kind
of caliber judges if you
will but it
takes it takes
awhile for
administrative case to move
from the filing
fee to the
point where it's ready for a
hearing in part
Representative Armstrong and madam chair
that's because
our administrative hearings
are administrative cases
can get tied up in subpoena
litigation if the
commission is to issue a
subpoena in the commission
process of pain and we petition
the District Court for subpoena
the respondent will
likely follow motion to quash
because they represented
by risk management council
which which there and fully
entitled and then and then
we have some subpoena
litigation that can take
time and and the courts to
one full so there's a
lag that
that and we didn't really anticipate
I didn't really understand how long
that lag would be
before basis kind
of ready to go to
a hearing officer for
for for a full hearing
we're because we're we're kind of just
now getting to that point in
some of our administrative
cases the
other the other reason that we
reverted some money in the 3 hundreds
as we've set aside contract
money in the 3 hundreds
in case we get embroiled
in litigation that are
small attorney staff can
handle and we need to bring in
an outside firm we were
nearly at that point
with a.
With with defendants
that we we brought a lawsuit
with respect to the disclosure
of campaign
independent expenditures in
the Senate democratic primary
in the past primary
related to some some
democratic Senate challenges in
that primary the
the defendants were represented by
a jury well heeled
DC law firm
and we were at the point where
we we would need to bring
in a law firm
to help us in the litigation
but we settled we got all the
disclosure that the state was entitled
to and so we didn't need
to to initiate that
that contract that was the
reason for our reversions in the
3 hundreds as this
agency moves forward I
suspect that were that we were for
less and less
just as we kind of get ourselves
sort of.
Okay well I appreciate the answer
thank you very much thank you madam
chair.
All right thank you I
don't see any other hands right
so I will go to vice chair
however for the
motion.
Thank you madam chair and I move
that we

recommendation.
Thank you is there a second
second amendment and
chair.
Thank you very much

actions to that
motion.

team I will let him
introduce them as
well as analyst for
the executive Simon
Miller
although.
And tossed over to Simon if
he has any additional
comments there's
not a huge difference
in the LFC and
Executive recommendations
of might be LFC
in general fund recommendation
is about $10000
higher than the
executive.
As far as uses
go the LFC
recommendation that
prioritizes spending
per person
well the executive recommendation
includes more money
in the other costs category
and not just for in
state and out of state travel
for the border Authority
Simon do you have anything else you'd
like to add.

then I director

Thank you
all I apologize and to

Okay can can you all hear
me I.
Yes.
Director we can thank you
great thank
you.
Good afternoon thank you for
the opportunity to address this
important committee I do
want to say that I saw
several other
more goes to hear that
but I'm the real one
so
the I'm also joined
by our
budget analyst David
Espinoza
and our CFO derail
of
0.
All share my screen real
quick.
Okay.
Start by saying that the New
Mexico border Authority
again we see the
New Mexico sports
as a you know point
of economic
opportunity
the lan account has largely
weathered the economic
effects of the COVID pandemic
and that is for you know
due to trade with
Mexico
we can city continue to see
record numbers of commercial
trucks
and now that the
border has reopened
to nonessential travelers
we're starting to see a surge
also in private vehicle
traffic we
recruited several
businesses to some of this I
including Taiwanese
firms also major
investments both in the private
sector and on the
public sector and I
want to highlight a recent
study by the center for
border Economic Development in
NMAA you.
It discuss the the
benefits of the but just a to
the state and
some of those alone supports
close to 5000 jobs
in New Mexico
contribute 950
$9000000
the state's economy and
20 6000000 to state
and local taxes
I do want to say that 8080
percent of those economic benefits
state here in New
Mexico.
Well our goals
are obviously to
address infrastructure
needs at all
3 of New Mexicos point
of entry to
enhance economic
opportunities we're hoping to
break ground on several
major projects
and continue expanding ties
with our historic
partners New
Mexico we're
working to bring back the state
commissions as soon
as it is considered
safe we want to
create stronger agency
with more resources and
you sources of revenue
and we want to further expand
the role and the impact
of the New Mexico border Authority
now before I move on
to are
project updates I want to share
some accomplishments
looking back since
2019 the
agency revenue has
increased by more than
58 percent
all give you the the current
number we have a leader in the
presentation we have
advanced all critical
infrastructure projects including
the same Frances
highway extension into the but
it's not.
We have worked with federal
partners to expand the number
of commercial crossings that are
point
especially into that that is a
page up 2 years
ago we were
averaging about
350 crossings a
day now that numbers
about 700 a
day.
We have secured commitments
for future major funding
investments along the border
and we continue to expand
our outreach and increase
HSD
borders.
They also borders that's I
understand that we're
you know it's late in the day so
try to go
quickly.
Alright
crossings into the that is
we did see a
slight decline
at the end of the year but
overall we remain
very strong in
commercial
crossings surpassing
the previous year despite the
pandemic.
Columbus also saw
that in December but this is
due to the chilly season
ending this is
normal we're still on
an upward trend
we're also getting new products
at the airport of entry which
are reducing the
usual dips in the
spring.
Now here's a better look
at the the continued
increase this is for
Columbus as you can
see we had specially
of larger
increase since
2019.
That is so this is where we've seen the
largest gains
you can see you know
dramatic
increase in some
of this over the years
and we do continue to
we do expect this to
continue
we have a you
know the very
efficient port of entry here
with your 30 minute wait
times compared
to several hours up to
6:00 hours and
passive.
Going on to the passenger vehicle
side this is what I was talking to you
about the the
major announcements
the water is now
open to non essential
traffic that is
vaccinated
this is great for the border
economy you
can see that surgeon
POV traffic
in November and
December.
Meanwhile in Columbus they
have maintained a steady
stream of traffic
during the pandemic
you can see that there were
of those numbers also
increased in November
of with the that
that has maintained pretty
steady.
For exports to Mexico
we saw a slight dip
in the last quarter
however you know I do
want to emphasize that our
exports to Mexico are
strong
we likely will see another
banner year.
Looking at the previous
years we expect
202021
could even top
2019
won't know the official numbers
here soon.
Well something we do
offer disincentive we
have the largest cattle crossing in the
state in the southern border here
in New Mexico
so that that is a process
over 500000
livestock the
last fiscal year
and felt
slightly lower than the previous
year.
You can see the numbers over Columbus
as
well.
Now are project updates
I want to say thank
you thank you
and thank you for
your support
as you all know the New Mexico
border Authority is completing
the feasibility and the
design of the New
Mexico border highway
connector
and now thanks to your
support we have
construction funding
of this
highway will be
a game changer for
the region
we expect it will drawn
you investments.
It will address
inefficiencies
and they will connect some of part
with the some of the support of entry
allowing
opportunities for increased
G. R. T..
It will make the region a lot more
competitive as well I
drive this
road here on
a daily basis to get to
work it takes me
about 24 minutes to
get to the office
once we get this
constructs
the it'll be about 5
or 6 minutes.
So again thank you for
for that incredible
support.
Another product to one of the
highlights of the some
of the support of entry expansion
and modernization as
you all know the New Mexico
border Authority has been leading
efforts to expand and modernize
the PO we
this year we requested
$170000000
for the project through
the state's US
senators up
our outcome in this
request we did secured
$3000000 for the
point of for
paving project
we secured a commitment
for 500000
congressionally directed spending which
is waiting final approval
and the Senate version of the build
back better grants include
$77000000
for the port of entry
project.
Assuming that the
budget legislation moves
forward all add that
we do have commitments from
both US senators
to continue pushing
for this critical
federal
infrastructure
funding.
Another product I wanted to highlight
the Columbus per
project this is a critical
project we have
the Luna County manager on this
call he's been an incredible
partner
this project is moving
forward we're hoping to
get this done
we're on the last
hurdle to get this
project
initiated.
And that her role is
acquiring the land
that we need to construct
the channel as well
as a retention pond from a
major private
landowner.
At this point we are
acquiring
a
appraisal of the property
that we
need.
This is a map showing
our phase one of the
project you can see
here the phase one is on
on the west side
of
of the
highway
11.
Phase 2 is
the branch right
here under highway
11 and phase
3 is this channel going
into Mexico
both all 3 of these project
also they are
are designed
and shovel
ready.
Here when we
close here are
the cost estimates for both
of those
things.
In here you'll see
the the flooding
that takes place in the area
as well as a protection
that will be
offered by phase one
and why we still need based
right.
Here are some examples of the flooding
that has taken place in the area
which really demonstrates
the the need for this
product
the.
Another important project
that we're working on right now we're
trying to secure an IDA with
the village of Columbus
to construct a column of
facultative wastewater
pond which will is
tied to the
the berm project
in that it will allow for
future growth in the
area.
We are also right
now designing this
project here
this is an important revenue
project for us
we're initiating the
design phase I
do want to say that
as part of this project
we're gonna be leveraging
our state funding that we
receive to
hopefully secure
some federal funding
of that will allow us
to advance
this project
this is our
main project
our main revenue project for
the area it's a New
Mexico welcome plaza in
so that that is a I've talked
about in the past so we
don't have any opportunities
for spending money here in New
Mexico before
folks travelers going
to all has so we
want to change
that.
Here's another view of
our welcome
plaza.
And this
is our
apologize.
This also
we hope you will be able
to attract
retailers
you know fast food
insurance
other other businesses
that will generate revenue for
the state as well as for the New
Mexico border Authority
right now we only have
you know dirt and and
and desert out here there's
nothing out
there.
A few more projects of impact that
I want to highlight.
That will be working on
we want to develop a
border develop of border
strategy that will look
at land use
infrastructure and
economic develop
development for
the border region around the 2 main
point of entry.
Now that will look at the
incorporate data from
existing studies provide
an intensive analysis of global
economic trends
as well as develop short
mid and long term
infrastructure needs
up for the border region
among other things.
We're also plan to work with
the 0 the county as
well as our partners
and EDD and and N.
B. O. W..
To advance to critical
runway projects
here in the plant County just
point we need a new
runway for heavy
cargo traffic
here's a cost estimate
and right now you know
some low hanging fruit we need
to
upgrade to
the existing runway
allowing for a regular
flow of larger 737
aircraft.
I see low hanging fruit because this
is only an $11000000
project. We're
also looking at enhancements
to the P. B. diminishing highway
especially to address
major intersection of
congestion at major
intersections.
In particular
one of those intersections
that we see a lot of
accidents and a
lot of congestion is
in but not
road.
Some other updates that I wanted to
mention of the New Mexico
border Authority is ordinating
COVID a vaccine
drives with the
department of health for
commercial drivers industrial
park employees and others
we have a a critical
date coming up here on January
22 all
is sensual travelers
from Mexico will have to be fully
vaccinated so we're hoping
to get people's
arms vaccinated here
pretty soon.
We have a another vaccine
Dr actually
tomorrow.
We're also gonna be distributing
COVID tests here at the
border Authority and
an important announcement
of the port of entry
is getting hot and I
I technology
this will allow for
faster inspections of the port
of entry ending
thank improve security
as well this pilot
project came as a result
of it and then be a host of congressional
field hearing back in
2019.
We're also planning to fully adopt
a proposed border
crossing transportation fee
this year.
And here is a look at our
revenue as I mentioned
we've had a 58 percent
increase of
so this is our latest
number on revenue
collected at the
agency.
Close by saying that here the
border Authority we are committed
to building a stronger border
Authority we are playing a key
role on infrastructure
projects as I
mentioned during my
presentation we're also
increasing agency revenue
and our impact in the border region
as well as increasing our
partnerships so
thank you all again for your
partnership and
we look
forward to any
questions.
Thank you very much
and director Greg Hey they
if you would stop sharing
I'll be able to see my people
here and
Luna County manager Chris price
I wanted to give you an opportunity
to say a few words
to the committee
pertaining to the Columbus Berman
anything else with the border
Authority.
Absolutely thank you madam
chair committee members or
have we on
director greater is he
mention human
we've been extremely
are close partners
throughout my tenure as county
manager here for the last couple
years this is
a huge focus on line
southwest New Mexico seems
to languished over the
years and
it's been my
mantra to change
that I
truly feel that this
store water diversion
project we're working on
down there is the linchpin
to our
growth and success
for levy county including and
all County
again it's 24 hour for their
tree we saw
Katie well we the federal
government so Katie
$2000000 into a brand
new port of entry there
they continue to flood
because it was never
remedy to
regionally we work
very closely with the major
landowners areas Centers
for.
Their concern is that you
know if they
go too far working with
us without
phases 2 and 3 funded
that they're coming in again left
and are they
donated a lot of property for
that initial for veterans
but we have and they
don't want to get I don't want
to get left high and dry you and
want to
yeah so
I just want to reiterate that
you know we have a lot of credible
companies both
assembly plants
manufacturing plants
that are ready to step in
and moving to this
area
but nobody can do anything
it's just unavailable right
now because of this
flooding and we really need
to to remedy that if
we want to see southwest New Mexico
grow and with
that I will stand by
for any questions we.
Thank you very much chair
price and that
and I've had several of my
colleagues comment on the help of
rainfall in that area is
the numbers are not that significant
but if you have
ever been there when that water
hits that caliche soil
it is it is
something to watch it just
role straight
down and
and so I think that
that dying by the anyone to
come come even when it's
raining but especially and
when it's not raining to see our beautiful
new port of entry that we're trying to
protect so thank
you I will go to the committee now
for questions and we'll begin with
Representative small.
Thank you very much madam chair
madam chair director gonna have
the.
Just really want to say thank
you at
the there there is
a palpable sense of
momentum that thanks
in large part to your
leadership madam
chair director go ahead
that
the.
The the travel
that's included in
the executive.
Proposal.
Is that.
That is that state
that that seems.
Important for
you and your staff
in your jobs is that
fair.
Representative a small
members of the committee yes
we we definitely need
the the increased funding
for travel
you know it will allow us
to
you know travel to
other parts
of of of
the border to see
which is what we've been wanting
to see how those
operations are working
and improve our own
operations we're also
looking at you know
traveling to you know
Mexico City and and
Washington DC to continue
advocating not only
for the projects on this side of
the border but also
on the Mexican side of the border
which is absolutely
critical because it we
can improve everything on this
side but if nothing changes on the
Mexican side they
were white were worse going to
be stuck in the same place so yes
the the the trial funding
is is of vital for
us okay
thank you very much director go ahead
that thank you madam
chair
yeah and
so and
then.
Amanda is it
miss penny is there
any. With
the very small difference
the small $10000
we're LFC is actually higher
in general fund
is there an explanation
for that was that just a different
methodology.
Madam chair
representative small
so
the
the $10000
additional general fund
over the executive
recommendation
it it was put in
person because that
that was our
analysis
there was a slight
reduction if you notice
in the LFC
recommendation in the other
cost category which is where
that travel would come from
and that was because the actuals
for FY 20 were very
very low a lot
of that money was spent in FY
20 probably because there
was decrease travel because of the
pandemic that's
kind of the reason that the LFC
recommendation increases
person it doesn't
see that same increased in
the other cost category
does that help answer the
question absolutely
that's super helpful.
Thank you very much and and again
just to stress and and
really appreciate director
I had the you and your team
and and
as madam chair
yeah the entirety
of our border
and the work that you all
are doing they're not just in the
in. But

colleagues to come visit the
border

very
impressive.
