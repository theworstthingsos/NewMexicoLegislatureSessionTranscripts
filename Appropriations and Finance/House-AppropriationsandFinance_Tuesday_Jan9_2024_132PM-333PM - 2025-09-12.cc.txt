Yeah.
Yeah.
All the little of c.
About five hundred.
Added sixteen.
That lost the cr.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go ahead and start w.
Regulation in licensing which is
construction industries
division.
Um the most i'd guess the way I
can simply explain the
differences is that in the base
the executive is
likely more than the lfc
approximately thirty eight
thousand a net pretty eight
thousand six hundred however the
executive recommendation is.
Recommending more general fund
in the base of three hundred
twenty eight thousand.
And the executive recommendation
includes support for the
agencies expansion to support
the elevator inspect inspection
program.
That is an expansion of six
hundred and sixty five seven
thousand five hundred the lfc
recommendation supports anything
i'm sorry keeping the funding at
the level and that the agency
filled.
That's where the lfc recommends
funding.
Without additional.
And that.
I called beverage.
And it's basically flat with the
fight.
Except for the fund out use of
fund balance otherwise.
Before operating budget while
the executi.
A madam ch.
Licensing system which is is
running
the cost of that are increasing
astronomically each year and
because so many different.
Within the.
You no longer have another
cyber atta.
You'll see in the.
Members of the committee it's
important to point out that the
substitute care advisory council
does not earn revenue it does
not charge fees and they are
dependent on general fund the
revenue that you're asking to if
you were to take the lfc
recommendation would be from
other boards and commissions
which have nothing to do with
that particular mission that
particular agency.
So you would basically be taking
from the barbers and
cosmetologists and other
separate boards and comm.
The substitute care advisory
council as you know is.
Code six one seven the
difference here is the executive
recommends three hundred
thousand more over the lfc the
lfc recommends more fund balance
in the executive and most of the
increase.
The agency to fill.
Executive support the agencies
attempt to try and address
for some of the fraud and some
of the.
Basically security examinations
that the agency does and that's.
One of the.
The.
Finally the final p code counte.
One point two million above the
executive and supports the
agency request to keep general
fund revenues flat with the
current operating level on the
executive reduces general fund
revenue and proportion to the
amount of transferring to the
department of health the canabas
medical canabas.
A licensing the lfc
recommendation is two point five
million above the agencies
request which ties to that
recommendation of moving the
medical canous licensing to
department of health.
That's why they're they're
keeping the two point five.
Ah the finally I guess the lsc
recommends.
I think you'll understand.
Construction.
We have.
Trying to.
In the same.
The enhanced.
Like said that's
just this one time fixed on cid
we talked about the o.
Last year they.
And that's.
Gonna make the due july twenty
sixth or the january first of
two thousa.
I was a little bit concerned
last year.
A real difficult.
Everybody knows.
And came with so we were doing a
lot of stuff there I think
you'll s.
Always going to have some
problems that i'm really proud
of.
On fid.
The increases we've asked for
there and it looks like we're
going to be ab.
Also
and everyone these divisions
that were bringing on the sales
force in the license platform.
It's expensive is a good.
Prior to conti.
Program support we're trying to
add some it staff.
And.
Inside.
On the boards
don't hear mentioned subst.
Programs.
Port ro.
Increases it also come with the
boards as the money for the
license.
But now we have renewals down
the s.
They're down to within three
days we're able to give a f.
The boards.
We had all the divisions in
their.
The big thing I think.
Rolling in in last year.
On the securities.
A division that protects a lot a
lot of times they al.
They're returningly.
So what we're asking for that is
part of it was.
We need to try to ge.
Investigations in the litigation
on the hd one this is one that
was separated out I think.
When you talk about.
We're asking and i'd really w.
It's some.
I would encourage an asking
that's probably one of the
biggest **** I ha.
We've got their inspection.
It's one that
you're.
On the candidate that's the big
topic anymore uh we're trying.
Yeah.
I went through really quick.
So
we passed the bill.
Manufactured housing.
And in my eyes.
Your job.
You know we need to.
Best of our ability.
The.
The.
Have become.
But if.
As you know.
Updating of grading and also so
supporting our.
Previous superinte.
The.
Yeah.
It's going to.
We.
To maybe run that.
Yeah.
Mentioned representative.
That's one of our biggest
concerned.
Revenues last.
So the other thing that i.
Madame chair representative
luham the executive recommend
mandation.
Supports the agent to request
where there is no longer needed
an m o u canous control is
medical cannot be some sorry
medical canabases funded within
the executive recommendation at
department.
Our balance.
And.
It does the license.
Individual.
Well
given.
Information.
Yeah.
They have their own.
A separate little budge.
Professional boarding comm.
Those go to the general fund
and.
Yeah.
Madame chair members of the
committee in the executive would
begged differ on two matters the
elipsi wind the whole is when
you step back and look at the
hall it's still three hundred
thousand dollars less than what
the agency needs to support the
and it doesn't have the
positions as well.
So it's it's not an even switch
its actually still three hundred
thousand dollars.
It's obligation.
Electrical look at that right
i've got some vacancy there but
obviously need the position.
Th.
Yeah.
Yes we were making it right now
but.
Yeah.
Positions is not going to.
We're working.
Representative.
I believe it's.
We I can probably follow up in
that after but i'm still.
Yeah.
The.
That i'm going to.
It does I just think we're just
for the place of with our budg.
The.
Good afternoon madam chair.
And we are on.
Yeah.
Out of the norm so we'd come.
Thank you madame chair after we
had to come to a consensus I
think there was an oversight.
The first output it's the number
of advanced nurse i'm sorry
practice nurses contacted
regarding high risk prescribing
and prescription monitoring
program compliance based on the
pharmacy board's prescription
monitoring program reports we
were trying to negotiate that
and I was speaking wi.
And she was saying that that is
an impossible or close to
impossible number of thr.
I'm sorry could you yes director
she i'm sorry yes madam chair.
So we have done a lot of work
with that a prms
about the pmp program and in
fact it there annual meetings
there's presentations we go over
that
what what the issues are and so
we've actually seen the number
that we've had to contact
decrease we also have got a
number of apr ends that because
a good bit of their practice is
not controlled substance
prescribing they actually don't
get that controlled substance
certificate for for these types
of.
So that they
were asked every year to give
them an update what we're seeing
what the issues are and again
it's just a real focus of all of
our educat.
Just start art manager and
members of the committee just a
high wide word idiots we are
working on paying attention what
other states are doing we know
nursings very competitive we
know there that we want to be
the best practice for the area
and then what we're using some
of our funds for is to make it
easier for nurses that have a
substance use disorder who may
not be working were paying for
that testing will avaluate that
if we can expand it beyond the
first year will do that new
grads were
paying for their initial license
or following that and you're
several areas that were working
on again just to make it is easy
as possible for people to get
licensed here in new mexico.
The.
Representative guarant.
The.
Yeah.
Thank you very much
is double book.
So please turn to terror.
Four.
That.
I'm sorry about that the else
you wreck through the f.
There is minor difference
between the executive in the lfc
and it's really due to the
executive follo.
The.
Good afternoon.
This.
Budget finance manag.
Word was created in nineteen.
With revenues to write from
place in senior.
The.
We can have ten thousand ninety
three.
Yeah.
Established.
With fees.
Manager.
Thank.
So
then sure members.
Maggie her stubborns.
From a number of different roles
who's heading up there the
mexico offic.
See recommend.
Twenty eight point one thousand
or four point one percent the
executive recommendation
increases.
The recommendations both propose
increasing transfers from the
agency's fund bounce by.
I do have a couple things I want
to add primarily because the.
What the eighty three point
eight minute thousand dollar d.
Some of them
some of them you recurring
funding fifty seven point six
thous.
Thousand six hundred dollars in
addition to the agencies
original request of an increase
of forty three thousand dollars
for the personnel employee
benefits category for that and
that is primarily because since
the request was made by the
agency and the end of last year
where estimates and actuals were
used for forecasting the agency
dead fell one fte.
In other agencies
really a big deal but when we're
talking about an agency that
only has five two years that can
be a pretty a pretty big.
At a mid point or higher.
That can create some of that
difference so the executive
recommendation does address that
looking at the agencies actual
labors for fiscal year twenty
four they are looking to already
be at seven hundred and eleven
thousand so with the ele.
Yeah.
To ask for another supplemental
next year but.
Moving on five thousand dollars
of that is also to continue to
support assessment contracts and
administrative costs and in the
four hundred category there is
two hundred point two general
and increase to continue perf.
Restoration process there's also
a two million dollar special
request which I will let the
agency speak more on that
because the executive did
recommend that and there is a
great deal.
With that I will.
Thank you sir
good afternoon madam chair
members of the subcommittee my
name is maggie heart stevens I
am new mexico's now to a
resources trustee and I want to
thank you for giving me your
time to data talk about our
budget
the officer than mexico and your
mexico office of the natural
resources trustee is a small
agency we are five people when
we are fully staffed our
organization are work chart is
on page fifteen we are
administratively attached to the
new mexico environment
department and by statute the
new mexico attorney general's
office provides our legal
council.
Mission.
Is to restore now to resources
had been injured by releases of
hazardous substances or oil we
see compensation from sorry
about this microphone and we see
compensation from responsible
parties I either entities that a
responsible for the pollution
we asked them to provide the
read the funding to restore
natural resources at no cost to
tax payers.
When I talk about now to
resources by law I refer to
ground water surface water soil
settlements wildlife fish
habitat as well as all living
things within there was
environment.
Page three lists are outcomes
over the last well since twenty
twenty some of the progress that
we have made in that time when I
took this job um
in december two thousand and
nineteen our assessment fund was
essentially insolvent i'm in in
the twenty twenty session the
legislature in the executive
provided two million dollars for
our assessment fund their
especial appropriation and that
has enabled the work that we
have accomplished
in fiscal years twenty one
twenty two and twenty three
to the right hand of the side
are the settlements we have
reached during that time and the
bottom two charts to show the
return on the investment for
that two million dollars special
appropriation
if you look at actually what we
have spent out of that special
appropriation the return on
investment is eleven to one.
When we reach a settlement those
daughters go into the trust
defined by law it can be used
only for restoration projects
and those dollars are intended
to compensate communities for
the losses that they supper when
there is a release of
contamination my goal has been
get those dollars out get the
spent as quickly as possible for
the benefit of injured
communities there is one I would
like to just note the fort
winday army depot in market of
twenty twenty two we reached a
settlement with the united
states department of defense for
now to resource injury sit for
wincate those daughters have not
actually gone into the trusty
fund but they are in a court of
federal court registry account
so you'll not see those
reflected in the trusty fund
balance but the exciting news is
over the plast eighteen months
we have been working with our co
trustees the novo nation and the
zoony tribe to identify
projects.
For that for those daughters
public common on the restoration
planned ends next friday and so
we believe that we will shortly
there after be able to provide
those dollars to both of the
nava hope for the projects that
they have identified.
On page four so one of our big
settlements and again that and
this is really thanks to the
environment department and
former attorney general hector
ball daris
there was the state reached
three settlements
concerning the golking mine
release and thirteen million of
those settlements came to the
office of the natural resources
trustee we have a transparent
process for including public
input in the decisions that are
made about how those dollars are
used and
as you can see that we have
committed funds to fourteen
different projects we have
contracts either in place or in
process to get those dobbers out
to the project comproponents and
those projects are very focused
on economic development there
are three that benefit out to
recreation five local
agriculture.
Three across a cabitation for
that benefit water quality.
And I want to point out the
economic impact of the work that
we do
restoration projects create
opportunities for tourism
recreation agriculture and
cultural uses and the firmington
daily times had and editorial
recently where they sight the
golking mind
as the factor in transitioning
the local economy to new jobs
after the closure of the same
one generating.
Then the farmington daily times.
Um.
Has done a number of stories
about the economic impact of the
projects that we have funded
with the goldking mind others
there are just a little sample
of front page stories on page
six and
it's been really exciting to see
how owner tea funds have been
leveraged over the last several
years so we have a commitment to
the ability to keep earning our
county why utilities thirty for
a restoration project in the
south valley
and they have done remarkable
work in leveraging another eight
point four million dollars for
that project
the city of farmington gateway
project we originally committed
three hundred thousand dollars
they have leverage that you get
almost another two million
dollars for that.
So.
Side number eight is our
appropriation request.
The.
A doctor courtney in socially
have pointed out what the what
those numbers are
and there is
I will be the first to take
responsibility for the fact that
we did not I did not budget
appropriately for pse and so.
We did not do well fiscal you're
twenty four
edin.
Or in our request for fiscal
year twenty five so um.
The executive recommendation
does true up our budget the
increase in our budget is for
primarily for increases in
personal costs we also have an
increase for other
that primarily represents
increases in rent that are
unavoidable.
And there is a.
And that that spelled out on
page eleven.
So we are also asking for ten
million dollars in fund balance
those redollars that we
that are already in the trust
you find that we would like to
expand particularly the
restoration dollars we would
like to get those working on
behalf of communities as quickly
as possible.
The assessment fund is if you go
to page nine the trusty phone
consists of two parts the
restoration fund which are
restricted daughter is the
assessment fund which are
committed dollars.
The restoration fund by long the
dollar sitter in the restoration
component of the trustee fan can
only be spent natural resource
restoration projects in the area
in which injuries occurred so we
will get a settlement the
dollars we receive go into the
restoration fund can only be
spent on projects that were
affected by that particular
release of contamination the
assessment fund is what we used
to do our work to prepare cases.
The statute says the assessment
fund is for collecting compiling
an analysing information
statistics or data to determine
damages for injuries to nature
resources and
as I pointed out the
legislature in the executive in
twenty twenty provided two
million dollars for the
assessment fund
and some of these cases can take
years from initiation to the
point at which we are reimbursed
for those costs
in mind was six years from
initiation the fort when gate
case really was initiated
fifteen years ago and so
arab request for dollars into
the assessment fund are long
term we want to make sure as we
bring cases that we have the
resources to bring them to a
conclusion and.
Um on the horizon
we are doing natural resource
injury natural resource damage
assessments at los almost
national laboratories I think
you're all aware of the um.
Multiple sources of
contamination there at the nasa
white sounds test facility
outside of last cruces where
there is some contamination of
at least forty thousand acre
feet of ground water
so we are working with nasa to
come to a resolution that we are
preparing cases in the event
that the epa designates people
asked as a hazard of substance
which would allow us to pursue
claims for injuries to ground
water caused by people as
contamination and there are a
number of uranium miles in minds
where that have caused
significant round water and
other resource contamination so
including one we have just
recently been invited by the epa
to participate in negotiations
concerning the northeast church
rock and millen mine location so
each of these
natural resource damage
assessments require it
significant investment in the
research so that when we come to
either settle or litigate we are
prepared and we have
rep against them pretty m.
Some very.
Well funded.
A responsible parties
so was.
Skip by ten.
The.
Spider levin.
You know are our increase in
operating funds reflects
increased work load that we've
taken on in the last three years
for restoration slight ten shows
the crease increased assessment
work load and again as I said
you know in two thousand four or
for for eight two thousand four
and now for fy two thousand five
we did not.
Am appropriately um.
Anticipate our personnel costs
so
that explains the difference
between the executive
recommendation and our request
and.
Pitch twelve lists the
difference between
the are requests the executive
recommendation and the out of
sea recommendation.
And
I have moved a lot of
information about what we do and
how we do it to the supplemental
and section and i'm happy to
answer any questions you might
have about that or or
presentation thank you madame
chair and committee members.
The return on in.
Madam chair yes that is correct.
The difference.
Madam chair and thank you for
that question
really from the beat the time I
took this job we have had a very
lean budget we have not had a
lot of fun that we haven't had
very little funding for any kind
of
training or travel.
In that continues to be the case
I think the increase that we
have asked for really are things
like rent which is unavoidable
increasing costs I think it has
gone up by um I think sixty
percent.
The.
The assessment fund is what
allows us to do our work so
clearly we have to have
employees to carry out that work
we are finally in the place
where we have it you know very
strong team in place and.
It's the general fund dollars
that pay for the employees who
do the work thank you and madame
chesty that's precisely what
would i.
Thank you.
A little your interest to the
slide of funds committed to the
gold might restoration
Two effect.
Contamination occurred
with it started the your mexico.
The.
Through form.
Just before ship rock it
interests.
Yeah.
From there the ripper.
Arizona which is the
same one river is that northern
boundary of the never who they
s.
Yeah.
The.
There was more funds allocated.
When there is only two projects.
The.
Could have affected over a
hundred and fifty.
The the spill occurred in my.
The.
It's or.
The.
Bottom chair representative
application
I think to answer your first
question just about why so there
are three projects that were
funded out of these fourteen we
funded every project that was
proposed by the novel nation so
we have a process that we follow
when it's dictated by federal
out where we reach out when we
have a settlement re reach out
to the community that were
affected and ask for project
proposals so we received these
three and that would be that not
the whole nation department of
fish and while life the sand on
soil um health restoration
project most of the participants
in that that um
restoration project are from the
novel who nation and then the am
sad account request for help
with their irrigation system so
we cannot find well refunded
every project that was proposed
by the nobody nation and were
communities within the novel
nation and we did extensive
outreach so we did
audio clips announcing this in a
denay we reached out to chapter
houses to the naval presidents
i've not been who nationed
presidents office so we did
focus on outreach to the nab
honation and
we have a ranking system you
know we set out their criteria
we rank each of the project
proposals and buy those criteria
and these these three then out
honation proposals were all
funded.
Um now.
Followed in the golf mind
released there were a number of
lawsuits and settlements so the
nobody shouldn't sued I know
they've got a significant amount
of funding that they are now in
the process of allocating that
that was that came from the epa
and the new mexico attorney
general's office received some
funding there have been private
plaintiffs
at who have
sued the epa in the epa
contractors in the mining
defendants and so
out of that amount thirteen
million came to my agency and we
felt what our process.
For making this decision
okay thank you.
You will not directly affect or
do not directly help the farmers
that had.
The.
The.
Or get their farm.
Madam chair represent of allison
so
the states anti donation cause
does not allow one or t to
provide these funds directly to
individuals but we did again
weeds as the communities what
are the projects that you think
would help make you hole these
are the proposals that we
received and.
And.
They're funded.
Yeah.
Yeah I w.
A then of chair representative
look up are you referring to one
of the to one of the performance
measures.
Yes this is going to.
Representative kind of
highlighted for.
The.
Medicine.
Yeah.
Actual performance
so are recommendations or the.
Because that's good go to the
two.
From two million dollars.
My question is working.
The task of.
How much
of that work is.
The.
Madame chair representative
lewin.
The attorney general's office
provides an attorney for us
that's assistant
bill grandfam and so he provides
the legal services that we need.
The attorney general's office
bears that cost.
I appreciate that as we're
moving f.
I think.
As we are moving.
And.
Yeah.
We need to we need to highlight
your wor.
Thank you.
The.
I was curious.
Common pr.
A madam chair represent i'm
strong suicurantly have a
vehicle that is provided by gsd
we pay us a lease amount in
annual lease amount to use that
vehicle
as you can well I hope it's
reflected in in my chart that
lease amount is going up
significantly so I think there
might have been the opportunity
for us to purchase the vehicle
to.
Reduce the ongoing operating
costs but we chose not to.
Yes
madame chair representative arms
strong so in calendar year
twenty twenty two we asked the
re staff people and
there was at one point where
they were just two of us in the
office and so we had significant
they can see savings that
resulted from that it took a
while to fill those positions
so.
That's where the vacancies
savings came from you know there
I think there is a misread where
some
the lfc report says that those
that we somehow spent those
dollars they actually revert it
so the vacancy savings we did
revert those to the general
fund.
Let's get to know thank you
manager
then she looked just to clarify
I don't believe that live sea
said there will be
that they had spent those
dollars only that um when those
positions were filled they were
filled at such a rate that they
are they don't are too
potentially overspent their
budget by I think about thirt.
Thank you madame chair
representative brown that's an
excellent question in when we
under federal law there is a a
very prescribed process for
identifying the amount of
compensation and so we do what's
called a rest not a resource
damage assessment and in order
to quantify what quantify the
injury so in a case of
groundware how much ground water
has been contaminated and then
in order to monitors that to get
an estimate of what fair
compensation is part of that
research is to say work types of
projects would restore the
resource and so the amount of
compensation that's provided
through a settlement generally
is very tied to the specific
area and the specific
restoration projects that could
restore the resource so once we
do that damage assessment we
understand what the appropriate
amount of compensation is
should we reach a settlement
with the responsible party we
would then reach out the
community again and say what
types of projects would you like
us to
to implement in order to restore
the resource or compensate you
for the loss and.
Generally we we received more
proposals than we can fund.
And we have actually just
recently been discussing that
question whether federal
requires us to spend in the area
I believe that that it does but
I think this did.
The state statute reflects
federal because we do operate
under federal loss of the super
fund act in the oil pollution
act.
Good afternoon that i'm chair my
name is scott centers on the lfc
analyst for natural resources
today will be reviewing the
request for the next go life
stockboard agency code fibre
wait you should be able to find
this information behind above
you can find more information on
the lfc recommendation in volume
too on page two tw.
Also he would be today is done
that analysts from dfa and
executive director believed to
garland from the life also in
the audiences shan davis the
deputy.
The main differences between the
recommendations are that both
the lsc in executive
recommendations increased
general fund revenue however the
lfc recommendation included
seventy six point five thousand
higher and revenue closer to the
actuals from apply twenty four
so sir revenue the agency
generates itself the executive
rise condition however supports
the agencies anticipated number.
The.
The elisio revenue
recommendation also includes
five hundred thousand and fund
balance where is the executive
discontinues the use of agency
fund balance
the local recommendation
supports an increase in personal
services and play benefits of
approximately one hundred and
four thousand whereas the
executive recommendation
includes an increase of one
hundred and sixty.
The other cross category LFC
recommends a hundred and three
thousand for replacing agency
vehicles to support you know
maintenance of the fleet uh and
kind of create a program where
they're doing this are yearly
basis.
The executive recommendation
increases the budget in other
costs category by three hundred
ninety six thousand for it
difference in that difference of
two hundred and ninety five
thousand for the
for horse shelter grants i'd
just like to clarify that the
executive recommendation for
grants to horse shelters is
actually three hundred and fifty
thousand so the other difference
is spr.
The.
Linda garland
thank you madame chair members
of the creating its nice to see
everybody today thank you for
having us.
So I think i'd like to just make
a couple of points on our
performance majors for fy twenty
three the number of law
enforcement road stops per
months is listed as zero
and the number disease cases for
one thousand hit inspected it
was listed as zero r c f o is
telling me when he tried to
report these numbers that it
wouldn't take what he was trying
to put in actually the first one
should be about sixty nine road
stops a month coming out for an
average of about seventy five
percent.
And the next one down should be
point zero one eight
of number.
The other point i'd like to just
make right fast is that I know
all of you can see our finance
situations right now and you're
going to see a large bank of
money right there so that is
coming we recently just
completed our brand renewal
system so that happens every
three years we take what we get
off of our every three year
brand renewals and divide that
by three years and put it into
our operating so we're not going
to spend all of that money this
year we're going to we have to
divide that by three and spread
it out so I would like to make
that point.
So in the interest of time and
with arm madame cheers
permission I would like to
speriod little bit of my time
with deputy director mister
saundavis he's gonna talk about
some of the back parts of the I
hand out that we gave you so but
right i'm gonna go over the meat
inspection program first we are
asking that it remain at one
million forty five thousand six
hundred dollars we are once
again i'm going to try to get
through the legislative session
our statutory authorities that's
required to stand up this
program I would like to tell you
though that we went to the state
person al board we did a get
approval for all positions or
this program on august
eighteenth so as soon as we have
her statutory authorities in
place we can begin to advertise
in higher people into the
positions to stand the program
at i'm proud of that work I know
working through spot take some
time so i'm i'm happy it's
completed.
The other part is on our just
our field inspections and we are
asking an increase of budget of
nine hundred and forty seven
thousand one hundred thirty four
dollars the second page of our
presentation kind of breaks out
what we're asking for um there's
two hundred and seventy five
thousand seven hundred and
ninety seven dollars to just
help cover additional operating
costs that is an
increase to for just vehicles
which i'm sure we're all aware
of the difference that it takes
to purchase vehicles we're also
going to try some hybrid
vehicles I know the governor is
wanting us to go totally
electric i'm not sure if that's
going to be totally one hundred
percent feasible for the
livestock board because of the
locations of her inspectors but
we are going to try some hybrid
vehicles and see how well they
work out on we also want to
upgrade our self our cell
service for our local comes
right now they have to be docked
in order to upload what's been
filmed that day we would like to
have that real time where we
have just some sim cards were it
loads itematically which really
helps sometimes in our
investigation processes
the other we have an increased
our audit and of course our big
gas was that we did a lot of
work and we've been working with
the state personnel office we
have a huge compression problem
on our pay schedules most of our
employees start at the very
bottom because our employees
that have been there are very
little off the bottom and the
legislature has been very good
about giving all state employees
a pain crease and in peak
increasing those pay schedules
which we believe is essential to
our employees and but we would
like to try to get off the
bottom of the pay schedules in
order to retain the employees
that we have in the knowledge
that we have out there in the
field and to also
reward people that bring
knowledge to this agency.
The.
So without I would like to allow
mr son davis to talk about the
pictures that are in this
presentation.
This kind of maps out why we
think that having general funds
is essential.
Thank you mountain chair members
of the committee shan davis
deputy director new mexico last
ocboard
the pictures that I have got for
you here
represent just a few of the
cases that we've had in the last
few months these are all twenty
twenty three cases they're very
recent I would say about twenty
three of our cases this year
with this bad
as far as the condition of those
horses and I just want to say
that the rescue alliances that
we work with the animal
protection of new mexico that we
work with we all work together
to make sure these horses
experience a good recovery and
the ones that are eligible are
many times
in incredible condition by this
time next year or even in the
even in the next few months and
so
our inspectors are very well
trained at how to deal with this
we have fifty inspectors state
wide we do a lot of training we
do a lot of work we work with
our days with our prosecutors to
make sure that we have the
training that that they need to
handle these cases all of these
cases are very difficult to work
through it takes sometimes hours
to do seizure wars to pick up
horses to get on the verse to
get them get on the car they
need and then that the recovery
of those animals are we wait to
get dispers.
Is a lot of time
our spectrum spent a lot of time
doing that other thing that the
this type of stuff that really
isn't what the new mexico last
outboard is funded for as far as
what we accept fees.
That in in a not in some very
other
important answers what we do
that that covers why we ask for
general funds and i'll I will
leave it at that.
Thinking madam chair I just w.
Mountain representative
are you res.
Are you referring to the case in
the mexical lifestyle board
versus well
it was because it's come out of
the court of appeals there was a
decision made on it is is that
the case we're talking about not
sure the case.
Have that issue.
Some manager representative
peter grew that's kind of a
tough subject right there i'm
not going to lie to you so it
did come that case did come out
of the court of appeals and
pretty much the decision was
made that the new mexican live
start board has absolutely no
authority over these wild horses
we are now involved in another
lawsuit
concerning pretty much the same
thing what would have woe has
filed another lawsuit against
us.
There was one sentence in the
decision from the appeals court
that's a little controversy with
the rest of it so they've filed
a law suit on a case where there
were some wild horses and we had
to tell the people we have
absolutely no jurisdiction over
these.
There's no state's attutes that
really says who has or controls
these wild horizons
there's been some litigation I
introduced trying to I think
move these wild horses under the
control of some agency but all
of it is failed so far.
So right now the new mexican
livestock board is pretty much
bound to that decision from the
appeals court that we really
don't have anything that we can
do with them if somebody gathers
some horses on their property we
we get called we do respond if
they have signs that they are
domesticated such as she was on
their feet
saddle source some of them have
holders on them we we three
thousand as a straight
livestock.
But if they do have the
appearance of the wild horses we
again are bound by that appeals
decision.
The.
I would walk.
Madam chair yes i've been
working with us arms the
governor staff there are I
believe a couple bills that
represent any arm strong is
talking about presenting on the
senate signal been working with
senator list of panic senator
george munios senator pat woods
senator.
Sanchez I apologize.
We do have a bill that's been
filed it's ready to be heard if
we get the nod.
We're hoping that happens.
Madam chair thank you one thing
to note and this is something we
tried to make clear in the
discussion.
You know if this inspection act
does pass then the lifestyle
port is able to obtain the
necessary statutory authority to
conduct these inspections in
line with the fda i'm sorry that
agriculture department's
guidelines it will actually
allow and I will be too submit
for a reef like base clear.
Refund of have the cost their
reimbursement sorry it's been a
day of half the cost of running
their program and so you know it
does have a significant impact
n.
So.
Session but if not I think it's
definitely something that we've
tried to flag as a ongoing
concern.
Manager representative brown
there's no requirement to brand
a horse some people do brander
horses but they may also be
chipped they can put a microchip
they can be tattooed there's
several things that you can do
to declare ownership of.
Thank you very much thank you.
Scott centers republic safety
now could be reviewing the
request for agency code seven
sixty for the adult probably
that should be behind tab seven
you can also buy more
information on the lfc
recommendation volume to.
Also here with me today my kind
of apartment from department of
finance administration
diagonalists and the little
insolved director of the adult
girl water berter cohen.
The main differences between the
recommendations are that the l c
and executive recommendations
are honestly largely similar
to the executive recommendation
includes about ninety six point
seven thousand more in general
and appropriations which is
largely budgeted
contingent on the enactment of
legislation in the other cost
category the legislation the
contingency legislation would.
Board member compensation for
preparation work
and with apps are deal with you
anything.
Madame chairman members of the
committee I just like to but
labor the point a little bit
more that because the executive
recommendation does have the
contingency language.
If you all think.
Additional compensation.
The executive recommendation
that what already be funded.
I just want to.
I just want to
recommend
our support.
And is of course for the modest
salary I just m.
We have conducted one set of.
A letter of
higher for the staff m.
That work really diligently with
the board and so
the two indivi.
The board right now.
Have you know been a tremendous
help to me to get me up to speed
in regards to what's going on
within the adult pearl board
the increase of what that we are
asking for that it is been a
recommended by the executive.
Um to the probably members as
you know our world of the deal
don't probably does not rest
does not move and l.
The.
Effectively doing the job every
day.
Sex offender hearings in the
last year they did pass the bill
for the juvenile lifers which
i'm proud to say that with the
help of the gay and the aclum we
will have all completed juvenile
lifers hearings completed by.
And as well as the.
On that backlog.
But as far as the
recommendations.
Or we are recommending.
For that all stand for any.
I was curious.
There is not for the number
granted.
There are very far in few of
these individuals the arm that
do request and as we get them we
probably you know s.
Those hearings we do have
hearings.
Yeah.
The document that I have it's
it's the very last.
Yeah.
Okay.
That.
The current board members that
we do have they they do not.
Have any problem with
volunteering their time the
ones.
We did ha.
We do have one that is
currently.
One current.
Madam chair
representative brown we do have
all of our members have
separate.
Um at the probation and pro
office there we have a grants.
And then we have two members
r.
The real rancher.
Members that are currently.
But they do can have them all
virtually so we have we do have
one m.
All of our staff members work
and prepare we have one
financial.
The.
Our staff manager who is in the
process of being hired right now
she actually holds a majority of
the.
And available.
All of the electronic docu.
Who review all of the.
Of all of them in virtually.
Yes a majority of them I only
have one that does.
Travel for the purposes.
That is correct to be associated
money with that is.
Ah docume.
All the time that they spend
reviewing that is on their own
they do not get paid for that.
Everybody.
