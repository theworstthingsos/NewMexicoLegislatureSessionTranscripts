You very much madam chair madam
chair I would move that we
remove house bill one from the
table and make it the next order
of business.
Right committee what we have is
a motion.
To remove the bill off the table
and make it the next order of
business and we have a second
for Representative Trujillo.
Is there any opposition to that
motion.
The question yes.
I thought you had to be a member
voting in the affirmative we're
broke boarding with major and
I'm not sure that Representative
small voted with the majority to
bring is it allowed to bring it
off the table yes I double
checked on that with our
parliamentarian and and
basically that of rule applies
only on floor actions.
All righty.
All right we have a motion and a
second to bring it off the table
is there any opposition to that
motion.
All right we have one
Representative brown is there
any other of the drive please
indicate by raising your hand if
you're in opposition for
bringing it off the table.
Okay.
Crowder.
Is that all brown.
That's what I count.
In terms of bringing it off the
table so the majority is in
favor of the bill is now off the
table.
We're gonna go back to
Representative small thank you
madam chair madam chair I move a
do pass on house bill one.
Okay we have a due process
motion on house bill one is
eight and a second by
Representative Trujillo is there
any opposition to that motion.
Madam chair question.
Is there any changes that
identical as is there
you're gonna go and figure out
how to fix it has anything
changed to rivers of identical.
You know it is identical there
is no changes made to the bill
which is the reason we didn't
open it up again for discussion
there's no reason to call us on
the sponsor because there's been
no changes.
so we have a motion and a second
for it to pass.
Do we have any opposition to
that motion for do pass.
Okay I think what we're gonna do
is go ahead and take roll on
this because I have some hands
are up.
And so everybody understands
that this is a motion for a do
pass on this House Bill.

I'm madam chair twelve the
affirmative and seven in the
negative on a do pass mission
okay we have a due pass for
house bill one and we do have
couple people that may want to
make a comment on their vote
let's go to Representative
Sweetser.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you everyone I still believe
that it doesn't quite pass the
smell test to roll all of this
together but I have been
educated in the time that we
were out of the committee that
it has happened a lot under
different parties leaders in
both the executive branch and in
the house and so I think it is
not as highly unusual as I
thought it was and I appreciate
the information and and I
appreciate the conversation and
I I'm glad that we had an
opportunity to at least get the
bills part three I also
understand all the rest of this
is contingent on legislation
passing in the special session
and and for those reasons I I
feel comfortable that I was able
to change my part thank you
madam chair.
Representative Sweetser
Representative Ezzell.
You have a comment you wanted to
make up madam chair thank you
very much yes I do I'm just very
concerned of what we're doing
here we are.
Doubling the money that we are
giving taxed right from listen
or we could go up to now we've
gone from two thousand dollars
to four thousand dollars
And I understand it's all
contingent but I I just really
bothered that this particular
bill that we just passed out of
the house Appropriations that
that language is not contained
in the bill that we're going to
be hearing later madam chair
thank you very much.
Thank you very much as good
Representative Brown.
Yes thank you very much madam
chair so
and the respect for precedent
but I believe there's bad
precedent good precedent and the
better thing here would have
been to do a straight feed bill
for the expenses of the special
session and do this this other
funding part in a separate bill
I just think that was more fair
to the public
people may not be paying
attention to a feed bill per se
but when you mention the word
marijuana cannabis whatever you
wanna call it that certainly
gets people's attention at least
judging by all the email I've
been receiving thank you madam
chair.
Thank you very much as a
representative Garcia.
Thank you madam chair you know
all I voted not to table the
first one and I believe in the
voted to pass it on this time
but my concerns are that non
funded mandate we're imposing on
all these police agencies a
small police agencies are our
state you know just give me a
lot of heartburn the end of the
day if it does pass it'll be a
lot of law agencies not be able
to.
Fund these police agency or
their officers for training that
just to be concerned thank you
madam chair.
Thank you representative Garcia
Mr Burciaga would you like to
make a few comments.
Madam chair thank you for
indulging me all I wanted to say
is that I do have and I am
getting ready to send with your
permission the links to all of
the feed bill since twenty
eleven of that we've had I think
all but one of them have other
appropriations in there other
than the of money for the
legislature so we are
professional go ahead and send
that to all the members
electronically and if anybody
would like hard copies we have
hard copies upstairs I'm just
not sure who's in the building
and who is our participating
remotely thank you madam chair.
Thank you roll for before
pulling all that together for us
Representative Castellano.
Thank you madam chair actually
claim I would as long as I had
mentioned earlier but you know I
did read the bills I did come in
I I ask questions and I got some
clarification on why I voted to
table the bill and I just want
people to know that that's why I
support this bill now and I and
I think you guys.
Okay well I think we've
completed our work for the day I
don't see any other hands up so
Representative Stapleton you
have a do pass and we'll see on
the floor so thank you very all
right to members of the
committee already thank you.
