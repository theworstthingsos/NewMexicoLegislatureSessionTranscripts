Good afternoon to check my
members of the committee my name

work it published school
insurance at the pretty and with
me at the table is
department administration and
accepted about the expected
director of public school
insurance at thirty
eight three fourteen
will just briefly be set up the
difference is between executive
steve direct communication
thirty is not received direct
general fund appropriations but
it is rather funded through
employee and a completely
contribution
benefit school district
participants I think why does
some other education
constitution as well as a risk
in transporting mister wasn't
knows hyrication
appropriations with two it is
worth expenditure authority
only.
So
you can see the first page of
your different cheap elephants
recommendations included a
eleven point nine increase in
expenditure what exactly
recommendation
increase it to
one big reason for this is
something large plans at the
possible interest to thirty
percent saying that i'm sure
it's just ten to enter his
presentation other two different
programs for the
three different programs at the
post when she could be starting
off until two with the benefits
probably.
The
agency out requested
increase up seven
percent over the twenty four
operating budget included two
percent allowance for cost
situations and not exactly
recommendation for the funded.
The
request
recommendation is
it's a five percent increase in
your brother
this members may be again my

for pro.
The budget that you're.

To join.
Thank you so much check members
on
the risk program.
Both the executive and the
recognition fully fund
the agency is request for risk
insurance the only difference
between the two is the outlets
impresentation less a little bit
more on twenty balance rather
than preparing reading reasons
he recommendations increased
screen rate revenue
ever spent out while the
executive recommendation has a
pretty complete d.
Second.
Mister.
Again the same thing with this
time that the premium could be
so
inter.
And right now.
Thirty one twenty ninth percent
is what they're proposing but
that will be revisited and set.
Yeah given
page for using the programs
and if he is administrative
expenses
that difference here is in the
personal service plate benefits
category recommendation hold the
agency to budget flat with which
twenty four what the executive
recommendation includes ninety

so far since the interception of
the beginning of this fiscal
year a hundred and sixty
thousand six hundred and ten
students have access to the
application
eight hundred thirty incidents
have been reported to the end of
ninety nine criticised text like
interventions have to be
complete and I did three life
threats have been reported.
And that concludes our
presentation to mister chairman
of the committee.
Thank you very much.
I think the action was.
The.
Doesn't matter.
Mr
difference is nothing
that.
Thank you.
Your.
Our members to first see their
primary if they can it's not
seek urgent charge and if not
seek emergency
services and then we also tell
her they will.
Minister chair representative
that we have that need to bring
but we can get that.
The.
Mr chair representative that is
correct.
Mr chair representative that
this is the increase that I
would be passed on to the school
not the individual member
we're doing right now with
unfortunately
the reason why the repairs are
going up is we put the top bit
application in place to be a we
could help try to always station
in and then report being and get
to it before actually because of
the problem but but help
which is nature of god which
really dressed up
one thing with the art doing too
see if we can limit it expenses
to roof in the future is on the
supposed to go now and doing out
if it's on roof
there's many things that can be
done to the roof prior to a
claim
that would actually help lower
that cost to possible.
Yes.
Mister representative that is
correct
so.
Mister chair representative
that's correct a lot of these
claimings to pick yourself to
come out so we have three years
in which you're possible that
they can even turn out for five
years and.
Depending on how you look at it
is something back twenty years.
The.
Mister president if that's
correct work not projecting
those claims out right now but
we get next to work your own
balance as every year and future
claims are projected in their
account if the incurred but not
reporting the claims that took
up one or financial statements.
The.
Mister representative
big increases decreases if you
see the company
to thirteen to thirteen of what
it could have been is the actual
claim themselves
they might be better to put
claims about thirty penitration
before parts of all depends on
what the consistent.
Mister representative
legislation the legislature
asked a bill that will give us
reporting training
and since then we can procure
solutions which are microphones
such promotions
in corporation
teachers should be taking
percent out that includes here's
a contractors to with school at
education to look at foreign
roommate for actually the most
station and
also made it a requirement to
report when you see something to
a superintendent or pd with them
forty eight hours
investigating and taking place
in addition to that
go out and do
what you want
with either
if I people are not a toring
and they do come for special
abuse and more estimation and
group mean in the sense that we
also implemented on this
reporting system and we're
helping
those capacity because it's
basically every student has
access to you
so basically something that is
at the right or something
suspicious they could report it
which never gets prepared to
disclose superintendent they can
investigate for something actual
theatre.
How does that work
representative.
The eighty eight thousand.
Mister chair and.
Mr
what we do is we do send people
projection every year so it is
the public school support
estimate and we didn't do that
thirty one percent in that
public school score estimate
what they are funded I don't
know but we used some
we think it is.
Yeah so
the second recommendation
the recommendation of ports and
nine point five percent increase
that money isn't the officer
recommendation for public to
support and as we noted by a bit
more fun balance but yeah
that the director mentioned to
large cale claims through the
people but not what we're hoping
to recover that you can do they
are stinking cause increased
space really hope you know
agency to work with schools into
ignorance provision activity
they talk about hopefully we
don't see those market claims in
the future.
Representative.
Yes.
Has very increases.
All.
Hello where the numbers are
right right now but.
Yeah.
What.
Mister project representative we
have her hundred percent of that
amount.
The public.
Mister
the liability they have is the
premium they pay to us.
Question.
Mr care representative if the
computers aren't employed with
the school and there's a school
so what we do required then to
take the vector solutions i'm
training and we are actually
looking at volunteer insurance
for this.
That's correct we don't cover.
The.
Thank you mr.
So I guess
we have the time authority that
is if you can speak code before
three in your books
still department
can you give her the executive
director of the protect we
health care thirty.
So mister chairman again the
protection
receives revenue from a member
print and a funds that are in
your market by statute
specifically
for forty and not receive direct
general fund perpetation so that
they do receive
some texts
that would otherwise go to the
refund if not that you're marked
in status
again appropriations with this
agency is expensive thirty and
does not have a direct impact on
the general fund.
So
different between the
recommendations are is a
different eighty eight point
four thousand v
programs the portrait
the l c
d
for that wasn't in the person
category for one additional ft
executive recommendation
includes an expension
six twenty four two fifty eight
and both recommendations found
fully fund the agency is a
request for the health benefits
program the only difference is
transferred to the programs
program still have any
message
recommendations
as just
exactly recognition it is just
slightly tired.
But the
pretty much the same so with
that I will turn over.
They did
not look at your friend
recognition to do with the
director mr keep
records
by to do
this was not ready to provide
affordable and comprehensive
benefits
and the dependents
with recognition to do that with
left
work
that's not you
because we do have rubber paced
in
because latest as far as both
different state colders are
representative within our court
what we have actually this
year's president we do have
mister standards with the
sociation was not the present
the ship as well as I was tough
all the changes
representation of ensure that
our members and the members are
participant depending with the
board that everything in
consideration with looking at
changes
changes that that's really
helpful
the board was taken for the
purchase the continued to ensure
that this is around early
as well as you retire.
You'll just
regard to our
participation above ninety three
thousand members come from our
employer groups okay
schools twenty five twenty five
participation is related to the
retirement spouse it wasn't a
pending children
like the point as requested the
predicted
with actually still over the
years
about sixty one point text
when it's
right you are your investment as
a replaced to
start to the speed we got to
actually ask
which is
last year I was
commented as part of the work
policies and as an application
targeted
that we brought track based on
our respect to return I want to
be talking about the budget that
is really looking at our
construction services there
wasn't requested for some of the
increase there as we actually
like see
investment
remains
been growing us pointed from
that professional
speaking to our group as well
with a policy are refused
to do that as well that as far
as the graph looking exactly we
have we are moving next thirty
years
twice
in the process of the valuating
are peace for medical then
television with contract
first point four.
The.
The preparation request what we
could be everything that mister
recognition and recommendation
was stated in ours
to give us
a requesting as well but eleven
point nine million creeps and
spending three they were looking
at
the commission to four hundred
and just about ninety nine
percent of our budget
one percent is really good into
our preference
part of this that we're looking
at this year I was for those two
is really helpful with some
remember participation
is a participating I would want
to know that we actually did a
couple of months actually doing
is this year that made the
request
a little bit more other entities
are the public that I wish you
to participate to provide the
benefits
to the members.
Putting up
your personal
number
exactly
as far as the growth of the
brother expenses really looking
up when you
are looking at spending this
year twenty thirty three
bucks in the middle this is what
I think that we always want to
keep in fine
or
members we could take to take it
as far as what we're looking at
is increased as it was mentioned
we do have different sources
we get employed and employers
doesn't receive previous
parts of paying as we
study as look at it to determine
what our experiences are with
those you know for the benefits
it's the medical prescription
benefits
the identical and
that would probably reason
what I really put back
that up as a possible
problem will be a type of
hopefully when our investments
get to appropriate levels that
maybe we can actually utilize it
doesn't best maybe help off the
right thing because if we do
have remember but it's you know
we don't want it to stimulate
they will continue to wait for
the upcoming years.
Exactly
looking at our project as a
state of the distance of the
things that are going to come so
that assumptions we did
that we guess the
fourth
four point sixty percent of that
may not be matched exactly that
you know what the public
employee teachers get it aspect
the just talk with the approval
of those entities as far as it
is in counties and studies
change the could be increased
because they could be passing on
to their plates
take into a plenty of approach
and white basic that number a
little bit different
to points of perspective it's
really looking at prepared is
now we do not
be able to see any reason
to the password we have every
speed
lincoln i'm just gonna read it
seven percent friend of the
perspective and we look at the
migration as far as my movie
between the plants we do up for
multiple one or medicators
site no argument possible
out of pocket
we do protect into account
during the house it is
the next line
seventy four
benefits
this is before every year this
kind of looking
that we have is looking back to
the previous years
four point four billion and
eight is rejected that we
can look
liabilities
one point
one point seven stepping with
this based on
looking at their funds
back in twenty twenty one twenty
five percent.
And we have actually moved into
forty four percent
the board has done really good
as far as the years
we read single digits
and I was to ensure that we're
better than we have four percent
we're happy about that because
the product both and
improvement
is but it's before trust
regards to your shop looking
back I can to november twenty
thirteen hundred and thirty
million
every week right now at one
point three billion
for his parts contributions at
the state into the transparent
are the investments the group
that we can
help
is that we do this program and I
can see to make sure that we can
we can realize or members for
the program for future
such as my staff who are
contributing to this benefit and
the forty five
hundred.
The.
I regard to the legislative
proposals
we did this year on the special
appropriations for work request
for one time
we should get out liabilities
and really can help me get the
right isn't cost or members by
the second I don't see just
resolution
to recognize the protection of
the mess of the constitution
trust fund
which agencies that we know
the public and
other trust
can make sure we can protect
that and it's drunk members of
the contributing to this over
the years we have that
protection intervention but this
would be around for them in
future
that's part of contact due to
there is that that is concerning
that it does that could be
could be
in the future
we just want to make sure that
with the particular resolution
that we are really working hard
to do with that trust it makes
for the individual constitution
easier.
The.
On the next
information
a pretty much more than happy to
speak to anybody question
programs
please
which
the conversation with.
I think it was just that I just
want to make a quick question
but before I
execute the most increasing
place that the total difference
in the personal service
important
sport is a hundred and fifty
seven point nine thousand
for your information.
So are
it
based on the pulls of funds that
they are putting up a stupid
best
specific investment by
that to it
is we get a reporting market
and they're really I guess
doesn't do us but we do have
questions to it however that
they're not but I still want to
reply that I could sell to the
basis and it is
what is actually
the investment policy to make
the decisions but that's the
earlier slight when it came up
to the alcoholic we could
actually hire
eighty firm
seat here so what we're looking
for with a growth to this
investment is really happening
at the best consultant that can
provide a little bit more about
a regular base doesn't accord
really to us as market it
doesn't change
our investment policy as well we
want to make sure that we're
getting a temp up on that so
that's what we're looking at our
funds are in the state council
but we are looking for that you
know you know.
Mister
I don't know where the other
simplics requires to are planned
how it works for medicare
population
it is a state white plan up
somebody is moving out of the
state one of the other project
we would have as the jumps off
living outside of the state that
they would be elected
and just because they have the
national network and it has more
discounts that would be outside
of the next week so they could
be looking to pick up and if
they are putting up the state of
its regards to our medicare
plans we do offer
different medicators respect
this option
I know that definitely concerned
that we were like
to make sure I remember where
where that really that when it's
not having the strength the
national wealth but it doesn't
provide a lot of instinct access
to accession and and I have
emergency room you know people
traveling
national we do have a ventures
that I can provide better
national accidents it really
looks at the specific about the
members look at the depends if
they were behind state door what
the reasons were us to be based
on the network that's all the
members.
Mr
increase then it would be over
the life of interesting that
it's okay would be difficult yes
by putting that back and it's
I was with growth with our
investment is what could help on
those please
what else what if we continue to
improve upon that crespon
certain point like to make sure
that rosa public repairs with
another extent we want to be
very considering we have
increases I want to say this
year but a percent of medicare
supplements
are product out of ray as far as
different
increases florida at the end of
the morning when I think that we
put it just next year but it
would pull but.
The.
Mr
we are not deficit spending that
that's all interesting is really
a projection that it's actually
shopping for this clear twenty
thirty three
that's actually projecting
almost nine years not fierce
from out we were staying there
we would maybe been to our trust
but
really it's just when I haven't
read the new expenses
that's a good conservative we
start losing agriculture just
one word that is ninety nine we
don't exactly what happened with
the market book and
a contribution we can expect
that it's tried to make sure
that we're designed for taking
into any change is that we have
to make me try and continue to
be building a trust
that we h.
Yes
if you look at
this is really state
and this is really where the
calculation of how much revenue
must be having as it's looking
at what would be either we have
to look at if we had to pay for
all of our reasons what that
expense being
delivered that expenses are
for point four
so with that we do have a
balance that left from what the
distance to what we had as it so
we're looking at and that's what
they were only at forty four
percent we would like to see
that to take me to be further
funded into that we would ensure
that this program has the
dollars between basically years
maybe you're our tough broadband
right now about forty four
percent and so that I would
leave us to that six percent
gap.
We know that
the.
Yeah.
That's
what the republican will say I
can disorganization started we
didn't have anything
that we start
up and start to play claims
immediately so we've actually
had to continue to growth best
one and it has been something
that would be bleated out but
you know the members to it.
Covers with regards to the
estimates they do offer a lot of
investment in that we can
actually be investment
contributions into you
that works with all other things
groups
and they helped medical stock
was particular funds but as a
related to book and stopped get
bikes they provide us directly.
That's something that we do have
to get on
border doesn't have the
overspite of this program that
and the investments
were really would be like to
bring
adopting advice to this agency
in our board argument right
right now I think matters as.
I think the decision for us
correct.
Top up mr
president that's about the
return receiving it we really do
invest differently
I don't really want to speak to
stuff but we look for the long
term investments not to be that
we're looking for
we're just looking for making
probably little bits deeper
making sure that would be
continued in the prompted future
but answer questions around
seven percent.
So we don't receive the article
report from
this council and that doesn't it
was actually different
appointments from one year by
your seven so we
probably get more on that as
well.
Reps
couple transition reports that
are required to look and stick
and with the ultimature
some
report there for some talk about
the administrative attachment
and there was exactly what that
meant how that would be a start
the oversight of our board that
we have representation I believe
in the lead transition
report that it is not in the
present
right now they are still looking
for regards to the contracting
you know essentially
a provision in their all the
contracts
after purchasing with the other
three agencies being messed up
with all pretty much close and
what what you guys do aren't
invite benefits
a bit together because I can do
that looking at the contracting
and it goes through the
secondary book we don't exactly
have that works with the
overseas at least not the
decisions on regards to the
contracts and think we would be
about to make a progress to the
trustpilot I don't see anything
but
up but I can see them to make
sure that we protect that
for those who read such as
myself the other who had been
contributing to this over the
years
and have helped to ring better.
For retir.
Mr.
Just
responds to
his question about unperformance
for three
more one page ninety one
percent
protector just read the
information.
Here.
You can trust.
Mister
I I believe there are some
different organizations or other
states that are in different
situations I believe stump
probably do that means on
sustaining I don't know which
exactly what the
what's been fine
but we know as far as regards to
its party we do to make progress
in that we have to know with the
earth with its progress that we
are one of the leading states
with this improvement we
continue to speak
improvements any states to have
a block less as possible
regardless of their trust funds
as well as even their plan that
that is so it is.
I see.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
Is
to retirement agency three five
two books
and I will be very brief because
the expectation of the
recommendations are exactly the
time the recommendations include
talk to sixty nine point five
thousand and the other cost can
be the agency is looking to do
invest in some software
solutions to improve their due
to investment
and some other asked top appear
that the exact recognition
mister.
Mister
expected the education return in
border started if I could
start by complaining is to
be working
match the recommendations please
because the education protocol
starting with our director for
mr
chief financial officer we're
not prepared to give them in our
budget character
start off with just a brief
presentation for your ball
spring peace to do this
presentation and a little bit of
a background on the order
position basically the approach
is actually active in nineteen
thirty seven I could be just ten
member forty that I would since
implementation I mean person
basically provided anything
benefits what the defined
benefit plan is wasn't retired
from every circumstances of
institutions it can basically
represent me through the schools
companies and select agencies
if you'd part of patient a
couple of quick it's regarding
the organization we've got a
little sixty one thousand active
members which is an increase of
sixteen hundred compared to the
previous year asked though the
attempt was to jast some of the
efforts made by the legislature
and the government received a
boost into our between work as
because we do have any increase
in the number productive
employees contributing to the
plan with the number of retirees
with an eight hundred with her
breeze this year
we put out with three dollars in
benefits for those members who
see it nap at the pension
proposed yeah
was just twenty five thousand
dollars not one hundred dollars
a month the meeting benefits
plus now because we do have a
high weak turners are private
engineers brings up with that
average doesn't receive more
than believing pressing
contributions from what is an
employers from those people and
into the program is last year.
About fifty million dollars to

existing facility with the
procedure on the trust

more continue.
Construction of his project.
What I guess to see is like
share countings becomes problem
pensions contributions to
present the best bit of
generating produce.
But is the support for thirteen
million properties for this
project but for your project
right
in twenty point seventy
one.
If you look to the next page
each of three.
As opposed to your
short term important house to
work capture
one of the programs please
product twenty years expired

your
means limitation of work
expressed the work on it is in
the program as the date was into

ninety
six
I can once
you provide working ten hours
for week or less
members
last
couple of traffic is a cost
delivery just with this
member first receiving the cost
of initiative and have reached
two point two percent
of course
building
a protection with that.
For example we just received
him.
The.
And
again just before if I prepare
fishing recommendations by the
two gentlemen excitement.
There's.
Sure
represent this to the education
actually we opened so it means
double funds to the board it's
not still
the general services department
which was
finished with the officers
assistantly
we are made off his location
which we
was
we have been to print his office
based rapt
we have location we have
property location with me
members service is operating
services please and it doesn't
have youngest once we building
off this point somebody office.
Seat up but I haven't
but in addition to that we
received the forty to set out
parts design of this business
the journalist department for
their management which is
the legislation deposited.
Mr.
The.
Mr
process a billing from
that the construction of
facility is from crossed the
department on today.
Mr representative those are
corrections and authorized so
you're all
I was to spend the money from
our fund for the constructive
disney profit this was done.
I could.
To be able to.
Mr chair that is pretty building
specially with the process
for example somebody that will
also have a portion of your
problem.
The program costs that the
acquisition of the the property
is both the constructive cost is
right around fifteen million
dollars
yet you.
Mr chair representative.
Good.
Mr representative I believe.
The.
It's part of president which
exactly if you give the
incentive to build to the
retire.
Your pension
right
by people to early it to return
the release of time basically
actually because I think
capitally just take people to do
that you know the presidential
center for them what do that
cost me to us or is it if we
have a limit on it and people
really have to find that down
and how long they can do it so I
would take it we would probably
be
just see that it is good costs
is going to have anything back
to the fund even though right
now the requirement does not
refund
music would be they'll be
dropping a pension longer than
they've ever paid
point out a lot of property
again said have a slightly
negative been p.
Sixty five hundred wanted to
receive collection.
Which.
Mr representative I think the I
don't know about the retardance
I think the normal retirement to
be referred to
fifty nine and half but this
disorder
I believe if i.
And you know.
Basically match up
sort of the benefits with the
the contributions we.
So you know basically.
Representative.
Mr chairman
just mister stence state and
again and that they're tied to
well to turn up there with their
tie to do who inflation so
there's a maximum of pork
percent of minimum of two
percent less implementation as
lesson to be present but the end
on the top of that accident
again we would never be
comfortably finished as much for
six years ago it's ten percent
to reach ninety percent role.
Percent from the time of the
funding at sixty three percent
what they have tonight he
present between period
would get up ninety percent of
the other white slip and
importance it becomes one
hundred percent for it will give
the two hundred percent.
The.
Mister
just got back to trying to match
the benefits with the because.
And.
The.
Yeah.
Thank.
The.
Yes mister public association is
agency code restaurant expected
to do anything the table is
exactly the employee's
retirement as a teached so you
just direct your attention to
the difference
for the public completely
association
it's a different
four hundred and eighteen
thousand dollars between the out
of city and the executive
recommendation
exactly recommendations a little
bit
the contractual services capital
recommendation is a little bit
higher in the other costs
close the prisoners benefits
that unlike the educational
requirement
please association does present
a small general fund
appropriation disperse as the
state administrative program at
this point that was different in
the executive recommendation for
the general fund and amount
with
any comments on the exact
recognition
committee
in the confessional services
category.
Most of those expenditure
investment.
Better investments do the more
than the fees took us.
But doesn't make which wear.
The.
Getting back.
The.
And I will.
Thank you
I think which I would mean for
the work on the budget and also
step that I have here with me
they're dependent on her
twenty general council
in is the director of my scale
is thirty.
That's like two mister brief
over the last clear we finished
your
sixteen point seven billion
dollars
in a different four point two to
three percent
work to your we didn't see an
increase in iraq membership
that's been applied for them
she's in activity member school
about fourteen hundred members
obviously with tariff is what it
well just to forty five thousand
people that we're paying
that looking for an alternative
as you're i've been with
benefits we can only have the
fund you sixty seven point eight
seven member staff in a premise
station period
they will pay off his week
they're twenty six years we're
on the past of our house and
fifty three.
Eight nine seven seven eight
two.
For the ear.
If you recall
we change dark person living at
just meant for reject.
We got.
Sent to the employee here other
statements
is dinner
for.
Minister.
Next.
But article it looks like I
could eight well
you have to be strength pieces
this passenger
eighty percent of our
terribilities have got something
just meant but we have.
At the time of the legislation.
Just.
Negative especially last year so
when I have been.
It's going to be very well
before work of my perception of
the three percent
looking at the contribution.
Which took in and on latest six
million dollars to contributions
that's
and we've got three more years
of.
In the amount that's going to
help funding.
You know
state for point two three
percent was a return above one
point out with your.
Benefit what we take.
Okay.
And
what was the police in there
just
go back with the second school.
The.
Exactly those part of the
performance.
The reform is it the compounding
for three years.
Exactly didn't at the pace but
give him to percent of.
So that was a
customer
that.
Appropriation.
Positive.
Everything.
Right
three three seven
counselor is my other attempt
the analysis for.
Acting sticking up.
I'm very quick representation
you all because the difference
is everything are you are short
and then after my comprehensive
busy kill before pending over
two missed one
difference between exactly this
billion person all the matched
completely otherwise tractual
services and other categories
the difference is in a number of
point
yesterday is that the elicit
recognition six fifty eight or
the exact funds
are that's the d.
Yeah.
Thank you mister
communications budget quite a
fair state and that's not
currently acting
that's not different
administration joint today
for investments in
friendship
today a letter must be telling
me.
By twenty five that is
as well as sixth expansion to
positions.
Record spending contributions
that we manage.
Across the funds that we better
take years ago
we are today
at fifty eight after we do
today.
This morning.
It's a positive scroll but what
we do
to go permanently behind and
complaint my think that number
performance at this point
and it sounds like more probably
on the way.
Each of those
they are a lot of different
under bills different
complexities and investment
brightons
are quite electricity
of overall across the different
government.
Looking at the the provided
legislation but proposals it
doesn't sound like a
legislative.
We would be receiving
appreciate this we applied.
Adding new state and offset the
help document clark
economic part department as well
as the only.
We second we are accepted europe
well the same time we want to
make a high statement take
pretty instruction performance
that we.
Yeah.
Close to since thank you support
you provide.
With that with your questions
The.
Remember that we did the capital
on this talk to us we did as a
pretty clamped in this regard
got good at
the council.
Where that is interesting boost.
We have been especially active
in that space but whilst fifty
minutes.
The.
In seventy two million dollars
across
two three four nine different
funds to b.
But they are related to
technology transfer lapse.
Start up
there's a lot of process
there
we are aware of the latest later
is going to.
You give us a bat.
Yeah.
Right.
To be honest for the eight
number was just now
we have.
Because
proceeding because of the
frustrated that we can feel as
appropriate for investment
in this case it isn't back the
better
recognized and as we are not
with any multi filthy.
And there's risk.
So
with respect.
Non general.
Yeah.
The confusion is that the
extension of what this is six
fifty eight there was also a
question
you can combine.
I don't know if you're a call
but yeah a policy is not.
Different.
Eat the basis but at this moment
they can't place thirty eight
probably to either stop
unfounded in the else direct
medication
difference in philosophically
between you.
Currently brought the right to
print.
The client structure is.
We are pretty
that was.
So he's.
They can get the benefit of our
institutional rates that we can
negotiate so they're forgetting
a good deal we don't add on an
indian ministry about it this is
part of our agency mission and
the.
What we don't do still be
provided in a vehicle but we
don't tell you how to get where
you want to go.
The.
We don't have the constitution
to make those kinds of
recommendatives.
All of their needs.
They can invest across and
different
funds basically stocks and
buttons and then from work
sophisticated
thanks to a deep pocket of at
least have not been approached
to impressed with the offer
recently.
Realistically.
No.
Actually at things between the
personnel to assist me and
communicating to do those twice
but we think a lot of the groups
in that area not just all the.
The.
I don't.
In a good option for.
We do
we we have pursue to certainly
opportunity.
Experiment management and their
experi.
Is is overseas that process.
Most treatme.
Best.
The.
Another and that went to a da.
There
not come in.
We are growing up west.
The country moves that way
towards the in.
We do for stupid market rate
opportunities or ever.
About the second.
For different market rate
investments as long as they're
accompanied
member of j.
Once but we are
first doing.
Because that is concerning.
Yeah.
The.
Certain.
Concern about it.
Are there.
And that is what I refer to that
number or last fifteen months
that we've been passed
go private equipment so the
seventeen text when it has
cashed real accounts about the
left and percent they can be
invested in the next go start up
support essentially enter
capital
with the art for its part of the
nine percent we still have a
capacity in april
it is a very challenging.
Just six it takes a long time
takes a lot of next particular
we have to admit people start.
Within the program emergency
more recently what we have done
and focused on his bringing it
and funding outside because he
is with networks expert for the
east
next week.
And that's strategy I keep my
with early small portion of
broke
states
about we can
temp percent about the strategy.
But what we want to do with this
is three opportunities if new
mexico but at the same time the
focus on making a financial
return is ten.
Reached the second.
Local investors through an
emergency manager.
We are looking to be external
expertis.
Yeah.
America's reference here
they launched their program exp.
What they're doing
and the best.
At that are going to bring.
The same time to building up
some of the local producers and.
I think that was a dinner.
Some.
I thought I don't
i'm sorry i'm not with what that
might be
if we figure it out will contact
you to correct okay I was.
Yeah.
Globally we're in the.
As bring the numbers and based
on our for example.
Was still.
Yeah.
I I just keep it might be that
these funds do their revenue.
Twenty.
Which is now over six.
Legislation we could press that
to build.
The.
Mr one way we tried to do that
as energeties with these
external manager and get them to
make the good.
And with the best methods and
finding the best managers that
is often a relationship.
But we are precipitating it it
is a problem.
Effectively.
It's.
We.
The.
The.
We.
Yeah.
The.
Mister
we have discussions with real
transmission for the pretty
would be work with a land of
office and and when we find
opportunity we can collaborate
rape.
Thank you very much
money.
Beneficiary
don't know.
