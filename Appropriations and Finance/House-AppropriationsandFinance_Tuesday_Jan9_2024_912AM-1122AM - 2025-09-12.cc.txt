This proposed increase of six.
Since august when I became.
The.
Student unacceptable rate.

been proactively.
The.
And had planned on having.
However if we are the extent to
require to accept the
recommendation.
Our plan to feel all the
existing.
Given the recommended
appropriations would be force to
leave no positions.
We would also have to eliminate.
Out of state travel
significantly reduced regula.
Reduce our administrative here.
Required annual medi.
With the trabs regarding gaming
c.
The.
You would eliminate early what
elderly leave us for more than a
seventy percent of began to
rate.
And place the burden of taking
up the slack for these and
additional duties.
Over an extended period.
As we all know this can create a
situation for the existing
employee.
And this situation can lead to
an exit this have even more
important.
As I previously stated I have
the means to feel all existing
place by positions.
In the agency that.
However.
If we were given the recommended
appropriations that are
proceeding her day.

Or direct proposal to the

Appropriate additional free.

If this appropriation was made.
Although it not allow us to fill

button is out of but the next
special year they will have been
heard and in place.

That's.
I know.
That does one thousand starts
and recognition except
one spirit
they're not all.
This
one
the other part of this is.
That does one house
This
committed
as far as game
the other part of this is
straight
in twenty eight
harpertowns
are a mentioned barely scam
commission
basically
commission start really
dish sweet just recently
over three successful
person
definitely my
great time
missing how
your call took as far as going
especially that the other part
of the source
of the
app being instant right
it hasn't been able to be
respectfully request
first and that we can have this
which will get
permission
are that about two issues
with an issue the staff really
read the
network
recently.
Yes
you can miss account
your quality
of person
firm and if I don't have
sellers to have getting interest
rate
I guess
that is
yet
which is best
rather than people
who know if you face some of the
men
are back to the back to
the house when the next year
I guess it is
yes
I expensive
to convince me that
you're called times for an
against the trade
so environment settings
unfortunately I wish to have it
right
here
which is
and that's their country by your
claim
for their eastern states
are that kind of
insurance yet
yes.
Commission assistant
republican right
now so that is premium
strikes
testing
which is fine
which is
good
with your ambition from
their efforts
to be advised message
is
real time
to see less of any further
than their strikes
in this test
for which is fine
yeah
there is some better
thing
about this
yeah.
Yeah
it looks like some unit
called times
of editors
alright
their country hasn't required
claims
session from
back in about two
years.
Oh that's
right
right
right
right
by investigation
especially if you
have exactly
right
right.
Yeah.
This.
The.
So.
Members of the committee
represented a blue high yes you
are correct we're asking for two
additional veterinarians and two
veh.
Basically.
Collection of that sample
something that it takes up a lot
of the narrations time
so so with that and mind were
hoping with the pets.
I bad is basically to assist
with tracking horses from a
young age when they st.
Injuries because you know
they're just babies they're
learning to to run these r.
But if they're pushed too hard
and they start to stretch their
legs or t.
And so that way if we see in
sunlight parking.
You know to sunday to read those
so throughout the summer months
when they when you know we can
see oh yeah this injury started
and now it's progressed me.
It would not re.
To actually inhib.
So that's why we need both.
Yeah.
Madam chair representative luhan
at this time what we want to do
is simple answer to your
question.
On the purpose of the time is
basically to look at our rest.
Basically keeping the horses
from performing and you know.
And.
We would like to hire two.
Staff.
Sometimes we have overlapping.
Traveling eight hour.
So we hope that.
We we did look at the.
So when we have the issue that
we have one.
It but the the veterinary.
How do we prov.
So those are the issues that we
were.
As far as open wise i.
Madam chair representative
garrett ah yes we do have
numbers as far as how many
fetalities happened per track
and we do track whether it was.
Yeah.
In december so we are compiling
those stats and by the end.
Representative you are correct.
Yeah.
Traveling wi.
And again this is going to be
conversation.
But we need to ensure that the
tracks have been facilities so
to ensure that they basically
have you know a building
quarter.
You know can be.
This this this is all great in
the in the respect that we can
have a machine that can travel
but als.
I guess like a health record for
the horses that that you don't
get scanned through there and
now we.
You know and.
Representative yes you are
correct we would need the proper
facilit.
Where they have one of these
machines.
From breakdowns they were having
a lot of i.
Yeah.
Yes we do.
That we have an attracts by
basically hands on inspections
currently so we do have yes and
as as.
We have regulatory so we try to
keep those two different.
There's no player anybody who.
You know so with that being
said.
That we have
do a hands on ins.
And hopefully with this machine
that.
That will.
Something that the commission
has.
I know our commit.
That is something that has come
up recently and hopefully.
We're.
Absolutely it's going to have a
madam character apologize to the
question I apologize so no
worries so basically the fines
that are well let me go back the
licenses that are correct
collected and also the steward
fees are reverted a hundred
percent of the general funds.
We do have appeals
that the.
And that's any time you know
somebody.
Again that is not kept.
So the commission the attorney
for the commission has begun to
look into this what is the.
Basically mean.
You know the pers.
There's probably cons to and
again the attorney.
We can get you a more.
Looked into this and this is
some.
You know we're trying to see how
other.
Similar issues because taking
away license does keep them.
And sometimes it is hard with
these finds that are ten
thousand dolla.
And it's hard.
So that's the other issue that
comes up you know and I know
exactly.
The example that you know you're
fining.
Fifty thousand dollars for not
watch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Included all but four point one
thousand and revenue requested
by the agency.
In contrast.
For reven.
Above the agency.
Point four thous.
As requested by the agency where
is th.
The.
Yeah.
Is not for salaries that's
actually for an.
Madame chairman of the.
It's pretty straightforward the
request for the moneys that were
distributing
because to my dollars for the
spare new that's a result of
the.
This week I sent out a word.
About eight hundred twenty nine.
We will also be sending out.
Letters to individuals who were.
Nine hundred thousand that will
be going out in this fiscal
year.
But after the first year so
with that and I do wanna kind of
clarify something for.
Representative ground about a
veterinary in school so there
has been studies don't hear you
mexico won't support.
The students here but what I do
want to mention is that we have
a program.
We have eat ****.
With the guarantee that they're
going to come back.
We the state fi.
They come back but
there is a bett shortage across
the nation.
We've done some things here i've
been.
One of the things that we've
done is ginger stated as.
A mirage of of
americans.
Private contractors for it
that was just not.
Licensing practices were not.
We're in the process of
automating.
Before it was all yet to fill
out the form saying you check
and send it to us and hope you
didn't get lost in the mail so
we switched to the dued system
so we can start taking credit
card payments over either on
over the net or in person at the
office but in order to do that
the state treasurer's office
requires that you'll be part of
the doing system
so you can be pci compliant
that's the direction we're going
to start to go.
And
so now everything's being.
Requiring people to come from at
a state to test to take our test
well if you get a better.
All artists almost.
You know we had a slight
increase in applications and
elections last year.
I.
Before every piece of p.
In the rule or the act so we've
got rid of that i'm so we're
doing some things proactively
you know we're gonna last year I
was going to talk to the b.
I was going to do it but then as
we started saving money I
realized we might.
Now that we're in this fiscal
year I am going to approach the
board of.
Generating enough
we started selling data like.
They did sell it before but not
proactively as if somebody
requested it we sold it now.
We're starting to sell that more
so there's some things that
we're doing hopefully get us
back on tr.
And with that I will stand for.
Are you all.
Yeah.
A manager represented armstrong
okay so it depends on what you.
So we don't
state compact like the nursing
compact we don't recognize other
licenses for instance that order
nursing we had the nursing
compact.
We don't have that we do
recognize.
So if you come from colorado.
Licensed in that state and make
all our requirements we will
take those requirement state
across and eliminates a lot of
the.
Tedious work that they ha.
There are some states that we
don't.
They have an alternative path
the license you're in californ.
We don't recognize.
They're not the same I don't see
their hired they're not the same
so there is some reason proceed
okay thank you for that I just
made him in the past i've just.
Welcome into our st.
Even playing ground with some
other states and that what are
the f.
License to better.
Representative arm strong so the
fee just for license or for that
is two hundred dollars but then
there's a five hundred dollars
example they have to take a
jurious prudence test here and
that's just a one time.
So.
And i've done studies for the
states that.
But some of the other states
license your period so it just
depends where we are.
I would say we're in the bottom
level of.
But those are the fees those are
the states where.
You have a lot of reasons in
your house contact you have a
lottery of a lot of stuff going
on we don't have that here and.
Much like I said at the board.
Come here and live out in login
and practice and log in there
when.
House.
And there's not a lot to attract
people here and even though we
have.
A large pet population.
With an something else I want to
mention is we not only do we
have companion bets but it was
brought up we have a.
And that's why we reading it is
that but there's not enough to
attr.
On the average i'm losing
license in the state probably.
Most of those are companies.
And so.
Thank you for that information I
think.
I know that there.
Madam chair
not where I want to be so you
heard.
The.
I did have that plan I had three
vets lined up i.
The.
So one of the plans that i'd
like to do and this is something
that's go.
Is to have our inspect.
One of the things about our act
in our rules requires that our
inspector and our investigator
be licensed.
Well.
They were highly trained.
Investigators.
And that brought them up to
speed where they needed to be in
my my thought is.
And our.
It is not that difficult.
That are.
We can.
That's very rare so if I could
find an inspector that would
just go out into the inspection
and if they found something
bring it back to the board.
There's things to get around
this is just that our act and
our rules.
And get get yourself in.
That.
The.
I'm sorry.
You know that's the only matter
that's the only.
It's not just it's for other
professions yeah and so we we
don't track we not run the wi.
Is a programming in itself we do
track the vets if they come ba.
The.
But that doesn't prevent them
for.
I can't really track.
The.
That's one of the flaws in the
the track.
So
good answer and and honestly I
haven't sp.
I'd like.
I I just don't see that.
