On one of the presentations I'm
gonna flop spot number five two
five number three that's the
only change that would be an
effective date so we'll go in
that order and keep in mind the.
Today's meeting is about
Recommendations on on what
you're asking for your budget
and it's not all set in stone
almost going to come up today
most of the time we'll go for
the list of the two.
Of the LSU the executive but
that's not set in stone we can
always work with that.
After the committee is done

committee and we can make a
decision on that just to see if
you need more help or whatever's

What go ahead and get started
then Mr chairman members the LFC
recommendation increases the
revenues for S. I. C. by one
point four percent well the
executive recommendation
increases revenues by one point
eight percent the only
difference in these two
recommendations is the funding
of new positions and executive
recommendation includes funding
for five additional FTE well the
LFC recommendation includes
funding for three.
just I cease operating budget is
funded by the investment funds
that they manage so it's
important to remember that
there's no general fund dollars
here and at the unspent funds
revert back to the corpus of the
funds and not the general fund.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee billion
after that the on the base
budget and contractual services

additional FTE prevention
recommendations.
And both the LFC and exec have
read census on performance
measures.
Regarding the expansion of the
executive recommendation
includes funding for five
additional FTEs we are.
And with that I will pass it
over to the state investment
office.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Everyone.
if you would please take a look
at the very few slides that we
gave you and that we've done
this on purpose
to keep this as.
Short as possible the first one
is.
Assets under management how much
money we are.
Managing as of today you'll see
the number of forty one point
two five billion dollars as of
the end of last year.
That is increased as of this
morning.
So as of today the assets that
are being managed by the state
investment council total forty
two point four one eight billion
dollars that isn't it.
Figure.
When I first arrived at the S.
A. C. in two thousand ten.
We manage fourteen million
dollars.
We're now managing three times
that amount.
Over the following decade we so
are pretty lucrative markets as
you all know strong investment
returns were spoiled.
More recently we've been lucky
enough to receive record
breaking inflows from oil and
gas and so all of you are very
well aware.
So the slide you're looking at
here assets under management.
Shows just how strongly our
phones have been able to grow
over the last four calendar
years.
investments have done well.
It is the funds inflows the new
funds that you've placed under
our care.
Very big part of this story.
Especially last year when the
markets were down we were still
able to grow our assets even
though the markets were
challenging so thank you.
For your trust.
And for the confidence you
placed in our ability to manage
the funds so what does this
translate into for New Mexico
let's look at the next slide
please call permanent fund
distributions.
I can't emphasize strongly
enough the fact that
distributions are what the
permanent funds most importantly
are designed to generate.
As well as your generational
equity.
This slide shows permanent fund
history of delivering benefits
to New Mexicans going back to
the mid nineties.
The graph and numbers tell quite
a story.
But I'd like to highlight a
couple of.
Projected FY twenty for
distributions those are the blue
lines you see.
The land grant Fund and the
severance tax fund for the
upcoming fiscal year beginning
July.
Will jump by more than three
hundred fifty million dollars a
year over year.
Coming in at more than one point
six billion dollars in benefits.
For the land grant permanent
fund beneficiaries and the
general fund.
About two hundred forty million
of that is due to the passage of
constitutional amendment one the
rest is due to how much are
funds have recently grown.
The year over year growth is
important to recognize.
Year after year the funds have
consistently increased the
amount they provide.
To our citizens and to you as
the policymakers.
So here's the bottom line.
New Mexico's permanent funds
provide stability new money if
you will.
For you as policy makers almost
every year.
And they act as an investment
revenue engine.
For the state.
Let's take a look at the next
slide.
Yes Sir thank you get the
Michael but closer to your.
We're having a hard time
understanding will do my best
everybody that because if you.
Slide for the fund performance
slide can you hear it Mr
chairman.
This shows our most recent
available performance relative
to our benchmarks.
Short term you can see two
thousand twenty two is
challenging as the stock
markets corrected we not may not
be out of the woods yet we
likely are not and the next ten
years are not going to be easy
market wise.
Please focus on the long term
results that's what's important
we're an endowment we're long
term investors.
Right grant Fund has earned
almost eight percent per year
and the severance tax fund just
a little bit less seven percent.
Both funds beat their long term
targets for rate of return.
And they continue to rank above
medium to top quartile among our
peer funds next slide.
Land grant permanent funds.
Inflows booming.
That's an understatement.
Take a look at this please.
This is the last update I'm
going to give you today and the
slide shows monthly inflows to
the land grant Fund going back
to two thousand ten.
Through the end of twenty twenty
two.
We often use the word
unprecedented.
It gets over the years but it's
definitely what we're seeing
here.
The monthly inflows.
There were typically fifty
million ten years ago.
Have grown to one hundred fifty
million two hundred million and
most recently last October three
hundred million dollars in one
month.
From the State Land Office for
the land grant permanent fund.
When I arrived at the council in
two thousand ten we were
authorized.
To have thirty one full time
equivalent staff members.
To manage one third of the money
we oversee today.
Today we have twenty six FTEs
we're asking for I.
The funds that we generate will
be more critical than ever over
the coming ten years or so.
As we transition from oil and
gas to renewable energy.
So I ask you to please give us
the tools we need to properly
prudently manage the funds.
So that we can optimally benefit
all of us as New Mexicans thank
you and I'd like to introduce
our chief financial officer
Representative chip.
Of thank you Mr chairman other
members of the committee all be
very brief with my comments I
did find the
a letter in the a summary table
I just wanted to point out a
couple things that I may.
