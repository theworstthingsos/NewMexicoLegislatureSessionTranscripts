My question is we have no
to start broadcasting, is that
right? All right. So, so
we're broadcasting
to do it. I'm glad
we did have.
Um so mister Chair
Mr.  President, um when you mentioned
about the graduates um
last year
or so, um there's
been um
kind of a dispute with
uh graduate students
and I was wondering
how that has been
resolved with their
getting um
higher pay and
also um health
care or, you know, other things
that they were bargaining
for
Chair Cervantes and
Representative uh
Ferrari. Yeah, that
has been resolved. I mean, there was
a, there was a process by
which they were uh collectively
bargaining and
uh I believe that the
solution was to
up the current
level of their, of
their uh graduate
stipends by 2%
and provide them
new um a new
health care option.
There was some misunderstanding
also about how the health care
option was working for
international students. And that
was one of the complaints that the
graduate students had,
we have eliminated
one option and given them two options
that actually fit more
with the uh
actually the legal
aspects of how
they had to report
their benefits through
uh, the state and the federal
government. So I would say that
that has been solved
to a pretty good
response by the, at this
point, the graduate students have
responded well to the options
that we've given them.
Mr.  Chair, Mister President.
That's great to hear. I'm so
glad. And
on another, um,
issue about your,
um, search for an athletic
director, how is
that going?
Chair Cervantes
Representative Ferrari
at this
point, uh you know, the committee
has been working on it. Uh My
chief of staff is leading that
committee. Uh I know that
they are getting
uh information from
the search Parker, uh
which uh also has done
on my understanding, the ad
search for UN M
and at this point, they're starting to
evaluate candidates. My
uh again, my understanding,
I, I try to stay out of that until
the, the final phase of it
because I, I want them to
do their work and feel that
I'm not kind of putting any pressure
on them. So my understanding
is that at the end of uh
of September, we're gonna start
getting candidates in so three
or four candidates and then making
that, you know, and as you know, a
lot of these things are pretty secretive.
So, um but
that's the general, the
general plan for. Thank
you. Great. Thank
you,  Mr.  Chair and thank you  Mr.
President.
We ask again, thank you for your
hospitality for breakfast. We're
gonna be here and you're hosting
us for lunch and breakfast. The next couple
of days this, this committee
is charged with and
focusing among other things.
Um, most recently of
late with the issue of crime in
our state. And that
of course, is probably the, I
think number one issue that I
hear about from my constituents
and I think from the general
public, um,
we've seen at
UN M recently some
horrific uh
tragedies with
violence, airgun, violence, young
man, you know, killed, I think a 14
year old in the dorms
with, uh last month, uh,
or it's earlier,
earlier this month and then,
uh, the,
uh, the shooting with
the, the basketball
team and so forth.
So, um,
I think, I think it's important to recognize
you have your own police force
here. And so let
me start by just asking how are
you, how are you doing with staffing?
Uh, do you have a, do you have an
idea? Are you, are you able to
have your police
force fully staffed?
Um Sure. Cervantes,
I, I,
when I was looking and
having conversations with
our public safety leadership,
um, my understanding is
that our staffing is good.
We do have a couple of empty
uh positions, but
that seems to be more
of a, of
a fairly uh
regular
process with people coming
in and coming out. And I do know
that the, we
do have an issue with regards
to, to, uh,
our, our uh
uh I, I, I'm, I'm not
sure if I have to
say ours, but certainly
the, the state has
been having some issues
with recruit recruitment.
So I, as you
pointed, I will let, I
will let my, my
uh vice president
for public safety
speak on my
behalf
morning. Good
morning where they call you about 10 minutes
ago.
No, I apologize for being
late. Uh Andy Bowen,
assistant vice president for
public Safety. Uh, we
are, as the president said, we
are, uh,
down one
position. Uh, we have one
person currently going through
the, the process
and we're always trying
to, I mean, I interrupt for a
moment. You said you're down one that doesn't put any
context. You have a staff of two, you're
50% down. How many
people, how many people are? You
have 22
authorized?
I'm sorry to interrupt. You. Go
ahead and, uh,
we're, we are
continually evaluating
all of our compensation,
our benefits, uh, our, our,
what
we can offer
the staff here. And
one thing we're very proud of
is we have a student
pathway, uh, where
we bring students on as
interns, uh, then
we transition them into
public safety aid
positions and
then eventually officer positions,
supervisor positions
and so forth.
And so, um, you said you've got
22 authorized positions, you're just
down one. That's pretty good. I mean,
that's pretty impressive. I, I
gotta tell you are your,
are your, uh,
employees
law enforcement employees
are they, um,
coming out of retirement
from other law enforcement positions
to the university positions that the way the
typical flow
goes. Uh,
Chair Cronus, we usually
see a 5050 split.
Uh, right now we have about
50% of our staff
are retirees from other
agencies. Uh, that
includes Las Cruces Police
Department, the Donna
County Sheriff's Department, State
Police and several other
agencies. Um,
and then we, we have
about 50%
that are either students
or the
young, younger
officers to the department.
And many of those are on
that pathway. And are
you, um, are you all p
er, a, uh,
do you know, you know what I'm asking you
for? Yes, sir. No,
sir. Uh, we are,
er, b so,
and, and so that means that you
can retire fully from the city
of Las Cruces or
the sheriff's office and then come work
for MS U and be able to
collect your retirement
from the other agency without,
uh, having to surrender the,
the retirement benefit and
then collect a salary for your position
as well too. Is that right?
Yes.
What some will call derisively double
dipping. I wouldn't call it that, but
that's, I, I think a common,
uh, and independent on
parliament terms. That's, I
want you all to be
everywhere. I,
I, uh, some of you all I think were
with us in Boston, uh,
for NC.
And, um,
I gotta tell you the one thing that, that
really struck me most
about the time we spent there with state
legislators around the country was
there were Boston cops on every
street corner. And, and maybe
that's because uh we've
had assassinations of
legislators and it's become a
dangerous
environment, some districts. But
I, I kind of got the sense that I see. We have
a lot of law enforcement here today and thank you
all. We're gonna thank you many times
while we're here today because I
think you all are key to,
to this. We're in,
in Santa Fe, we're told you need a new law
for this. You need a new law for that and the
other and, and I'm always the kind
of the voice of saying that's not
really what the problem is.
Um We have
fewer laws when I was raised in this
community. I'm 64
I'm born and raised here. We have fewer
laws. Um
And we have a lot more safety.
Uh And, and we
didn't have higher sentences.
We keep increase the sentences
and we had greater safety then
too. So the, the
solution to be is with you all
really. And um I
hope that we can get you even
more positions. I,
when I was in Boston
again, I said, II, I don't
have to statistics here in front of me, but
I went and looked at the comparison.
The, the population of Albuquerque
in Boston is not too far
off, believe it or not uh
population in
Boston. Boston is
about, I think I saw about
650,000. Albuquerque is about
550,000. If you look
at the ratio of police
officers per capita
Boston, it's night
and day. I mean, it's, it's like
twice as many cops
work in Boston than
Albuquerque and, and
we would see it. I mean, I couldn't
go anywhere without motorcycle
cops and beat
cops and cars
going and, um, and we
just don't see that here and, and I, I,
I'm, I'm bringing all this to you,
um,  Mr.  President and
others. I, I really hope we'll see
more police presence out
on the street. You know, it's easy to have
people in the office and doing
important things. I'm sure there are too.
But, but seeing people,
seeing law enforcement officers,
I think is so important and,
um, as we,
we're seeing some violence
on our campuses and, and
that should never be right. Nobody
should ever have to be, there should be the,
the safest place in Las Cruces
and I'm sure it, it
generally is. I
am, my office is on
University Avenue and I
know you all have sharing agreements with the
city of Las Cruces and Sheriff's
Department. A lot of cross purposing.
So, so I think that's all,
uh, terrific as well too,
but we wanted to do that. The
last thing I'll just add  Mr.  President.
This is not for the officers.
So much but we've got to
really begin to try and
address the blight
on intermission campus. You
inherited a university that's
got some very old
housing, decrepit buildings,
abandoned buildings. I believe
those places are where bad
things probably happen or
could happen. Um,
we have a whole entire
block blocks and, and
you all should probably see it when you're not.
It's really deplorable. It's, it's
tragic and this is not on you
because you're inheriting this. But we've
got blocks and blocks of
abandoned buildings on this campus.
They're a blight and
eyesore because they're on the interstate
number one. And
so you see that driving through Las
Cruces, but more important to
me, I think that's just right
for uh assault,
rape, uh drug
use any number of other
things. And I'm, I'm, I'm surprised
I shouldn't be saying this. I'm surprised we
haven't seen that yet, but we got, we got to
take care of that problem. And II, I
want to really ask you to
help us make that
uh a really top
prior for this
administration. So, Chair Cervantes,
that is a priority. Last
year, we had appropriated
some money to raise uh
coal village, which is
the area of what you're talking that
you're talking about.
And uh one of the, one
of the initial
thoughts that we're trying to
advance right now is a collaboration
with the, the city
and the county as well as
possibly economic development
to create
a mixed use area in
place of what you see right
now. Precisely because
I had the same impression
when I started just driving
down the road and seeing this
or deciding to
go on campus and looking at
the things that we have. So yes,
the brand is right now to raise
the the the area,
then do some studies
for uh you know, asbestos,
abatements, etcetera, etcetera. But
really because we have Arrowhead
not too far from there
thinking about it as an
area that could in fact develop
and grow in a very
different direction,
sort of as an entrepreneurship,
innovation, but also kind of
mixed housing area. So
yeah, well, I'm sure occurs you
the the potential for that
because it's location
is tremendous. I mean, the the most
valuable property seemingly to
me anywhere Albuquerque Los
because there is a long interstate. So we
have this entire interstate and
it's nothing but abandoned and
new we're talking about by hundreds
of, of, of housing units,
right? So the important thing you
said the plan is to raise
it. My, my understanding is the
reason we haven't done it is because money
uh and we got
people here with the money.
Uh So I mean, it
was just a matter of money. We have to push
harder, I guess it's really my point. We have
to push harder as a
NMU body
and as a city and a community
to say we need you, you know what the
number is right now,
the chair Cervantes, I believe
70 million dollars have been
appropriated to
117
$70 million to
raise it. And there is another,
I, I believe another ask of
about $50 million
to complete the, the the work
5015
to bring it up. So it's a total of about
$32 million to do
that. And then as
I said, in collaboration with
City and County to
try to get it to the next level.
So you're not gonna want to hear what my colleague
to my right said, which said that's
hardly nothing. Um And
she shouldn't say that, but she's on the finance
committee. So that, that
is a drop in the bucket
and it's a big task.
But, but I really, I'm bringing it
up because I really do think that should be one of our
greatest priorities for a
university is to really
a campus
that is safe. Um But
also beautiful and so we
can be very proud of as a community.
So Ferrari and
Mr.  Chair,  Mr.  President,
you mentioned about, you know, if they
were to sell off some of the property
as long as they don't sell off
the golf course,
different story.
Um, I, uh, and, and then the
last thing I, I promise I'll end
up.
Ok.
Yeah,
so I,
now
initially when
you know, I don't breath,
um, but
nicer than
right
now that it would
be so
on long means that
a
moster on things that
the t or
that appear
the current pain
rash. Uh,
the judge,
I, I,
and I used to go with
the
house
and your
is and
all
of
any service
or
cc it
all.
Oh,
where it says pain for
the,
and the same
exploration.
What she,
all that
purchasing the
body
always fall
within your
hair or plan
that
they
all.
So I have a
certain
that
so,
oh,
and related
there are similar litigation
of problems.
Mm. Five
worse.
Uh,
so community. Is
that
very well that
why the police
that?
No already,
but I
have background
check
for,
you know,
about record
things
that
40 hours
and I
have,
oh, that, that,
that, that
down to
the,
that is the way
that have
urges of fire
downfall
I am to.
So, uh,
last so
long I just have to operate
a back of the
pain,
um, that was
healed. This
again, this
gonna be
very,
very, that I
agree.
We have the
weight of the
cell on the wrist
operating
and we
all an
types.
They,
so a certain,
um,
that
10
I,
and, well,
why put them
into
my,
and I
like,
uh, as,
you
know, for,
uh, uh,
list,
uh, every routine
to and
for
pre in
of the
brain
that
with firearms,
it's like for
arms. And
so
the intense
languages learn
out,
screw them on
that.
That, that was
on to the approach
to
the challenge the
uh state
was or
on the, in that
brought into effect
while the case was
tried or it
said that on
that
all of them are got a
lot of purchases
and
so they are paying
for
is so, you know,
so now
all,
wow.
Well, I mean, what
we, what, what
I, uh, do
this,
so waiting periods
then that's kind of usually
one course sign
that purchase
firearms
falls within the plane
test. Yeah,
of course,
that
I,
one of the first
I
would,
you know,
uh, without
pain,
probably the larges, you
know, I heard
before to
turn.
Yes.
Have this really
the worst,
um,
is a
little behind the,
that
not
side
or why?
I,
sorry.
Right.
That
where,
how can I have
lost
all the time? And I just
need to, to rely on
it. That's hr I'm
afraid.
Yes.
And with
that,
thank you.
And
I just
all is good.
One
moment
we're working on it right
now.
Yeah,
let's go ahead and just ask
your
question.
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
No.
In reviewing and reviewing
the 10,
reviewing,
uh,
review
decision,
um,
it seems more likely
that courts will determine
that, um, the
purchase falls
within the plain
text,
but the
eighth circuit or the, I'm
sorry, the fifth circuit
decision out of,
out of Texas
stands out in a way
and, and the judges that decide
that make it stand out in a way
that makes me tell you that I
don't. So
maybe
5149
the reason I asked is
because plain text
usually means that you
read the text.
Keep the
Beres, it
doesn't
save,
am I doing something? I'm
gonna let the,
but, um, Senator, we've
got K you
do? Ok, we can continue
this. Thank you. We can
we can continue it
all.
I'm sorry. So um
hoping we have audio.
I see our staff is working
on the phones
and
uh yeah, I'm trying to make sure the
online. See
he looks like he's busy doing
something
here. Can you
hear me?
Uh Yeah, you're gonna have to speak a little
bit louder. Kyle,
please.
Ok, perfect
to
see.
Have audio.
miss one of our colleagues.
What
right. Uh Should I get
started now? Sorry about the
technical
difficulties.
We have a,
you know what else?
Ok. Yes. Uh So Kyle,
so please go ahead but you're gonna have
to speak quite a bit louder.
Barely hear you over
here,
ok? Uh Let me
see here if uh
if I should change the,
the mic here, but um
hopefully if you can hear
me now, I'll just
speak this loudly and
Holly in the office
next door will probably just
be banging on my
door to be
quiet.
Hold on, hold on, hold
on.
Yeah,
on Kyle. Can you hear
me?
Yeah, I
know
have this
number.
I call him and just put his phone next
to the microphone. All this
technology.
Yes.
Yeah,
Mr.
Yeah.
Alright, so madam chair, I want
to take a moment to explain why
Mr.  Infante is here. Why I gave the
topic that the title that I did
uh Black Black
Fences or Black
Ops. It's, it's really,
this is silly. Uh but
Mr.  Infante is
here to explain where the property
boundaries are at, where the border
runs where the city of Sunland
Park is at a little bit of this history. And
so that's a little background
for the committee members and and thank you all for
joining us. Those of you coming in
now too. So it'll be interesting
topic,  Mr.  Infante, Manager
of Sunland Park.
Thank you, Senator and madam
chair ru members
of the board. The committee.
Welcome to Las Cruces is a
beautiful part of the state.
I was raised in this area.
I'm actually from Ciudad Juarez. It's
part of my introduction. We migrated
here in the early eighties.
So I I was one
of those examples of where you come
across illegally and in those
days, believe it or not
used to be able to cross and say American.
So you just had to really uh
practice the word and
enunciate it properly because
as we all know, as, as a
minor, uh they
really can't uh question
you. Right. And so we were
blessed uh to be raised
here. Uh This is my,
I'm a mater here. I went to New Mexico
State University. Um
I'm technical uh by
background. Uh did,
did my graduate work up at UN
M
spent uh about
24 years working across
the 2000 mile border
states. So I
know everything from Texas to
California, worked
in the first border while under
the first administration in Calexico,
Mexicali. Uh So
if you have some technical questions on
that, and I'd be happy to, to
answer those as well. Uh
been, been in Sunland Park
almost three years now. Uh
We're able to move
things a little quicker. The advantage
of, of being on the public
side is, is now you
understand that if things don't
work, what you gotta do
is you gotta change the local ordinance or
the law, right? If it doesn't work
at the state level. And that makes sense and we
got to work with, with you all
to make sure that, that we
can um
amend the law so that we can
work for the betterment of, of the
communities that we serve.
So with that, I, I am,
I'm really honored and privileged to be here
today. I
frankly didn't know what I was
presenting other than looking at the
presentation. So I
put together uh some
slides for you and,
and I'll, and I'll talk from
those. Uh, and along
the way, if you have questions, please
feel free to, to
ask me at any
time.
Let me just bring it up here
so that I can see
it
to our staff.
Sunscreen.
Um, I, I've
got it on my computer now.
Oh, ok. I,
I believe
Nancy, you've got the slides.
So, while she puts them up,
um, I'll dive right
in. I'll
talk about what Sunland
Park is doing
from a public safety
initiative.
Capacity building is also
very, very important.
And I'll, I'll go into
what that means for Sunland
Park.
We're also currently
in uh about
the tail end of a master planning
exercise that
creates a one stop shop.
Part of the one stop shop is
we're uh centralizing
the main fire station
and police
station
along with city
administration
and then probably what you're more
interested in. And after
listening to Representative
Block is probably on the border security
side. And so I've got some really good
notes um in the
future, I really would like to
invite our border
um patrol agent
from Santa Teresa, uh
Mr.  Jostes because he's
a wealth of information
and, and he would really
appreciate the opportunity to get
to meet you on to,
to share what is his name
again, please? Jose, I,
I can text you his number,
Senator, please do. I, I'll just
for the committee's benefit.
Our experience today
has been when we ever try to get anybody
in the Federal government to come
to a committee, they usually refuse.
So I'd love to talk to
him and I'd love for him to accept an
invitation. Absolutely. We,
we can certainly facilitate
that.
So let's talk about the Public
Safety initiative.
We're currently in
communication with dads in
schools. Uh We've had a
couple of meetings,
one of the phenomenons
that we're starting to experience within
the city of Sunland Park in the Goetz
Independent School district
is uh
a the enrolment
rate is declining
unfortunately.
And uh I know that super
the superintendent for the
school district there,  Mr.
Dempsey is
uh investigating
that uh some of the thoughts is
that a number of students are really
attending school in El Paso,
which of course is not
something that we want to see.
And for, for those of you that
may not be familiar. Gatson schools
has some of the brightest students, some
of the best grades, some of the best
performance from an education
perspective. And so
I I sense
that part of it is just getting that
information out to, to
the families that are, that are migrating
to Sunland Park
with that with the reduction
of enrolment. Um
there creates an opportunity or a
silver lining
where Sunland Park
Elementary School, a
25 acre site
um is
going to be transferred over to the school
district.
We are looking
to uh enter
into a transfer
agreement uh
to get that over
to the city of Sunland Park and then
develop a mixed land use
plan. But part of what we're
looking at doing in the 25 acre
site is something really
unique.
Sunland parking. You heard nu
earlier uh on their law
enforcement, there was a question of, you know, how
many staff do you have? And
are you short and what are you doing
to retain them?
Uh Sunland Park, like
many of the other small communities
across the state are struggling to be
competitive with
other law enforcement agencies
like City of Albuquerque, Las
Cruces, uh Rio
Rancho, we
embarked about 15 months
ago
on what we call a farm system
initiative. So most of us
that have played sports, we understand you
capture them at a young age.
Uh You, you look for those
athletes that are interested in,
in a uh in this case wanting
to go into law enforcement.
And so we developed a uh
partnership with Gatson
Schools and we're
capturing their CTE
law enforcement program.
Seniors, we're
offering internships. So
they're working with us a
couple of interns every
semester.
If those students uh they,
they go, they get vetted background
check through their
uh um criminal
justice program at the CT
at the senior level,
then they will come on
board uh after
their graduation
and we uh we created a
scholarship fund.
We also now have a working
agreement with
the El Paso
Community College. So we're able to send
those
um
young adults that wish to go into
law enforcement to
pursue their law
enforcement career.
Um We recently had
a cohort of three graduate
and they are now doing
FTO uh
field training officers
out in the field. And by this
October, those three
officers will be out in the streets
on their own. We have a second
cohort that has just
commenced their law
enforcement program or
academy at El Paso
Community College.
What we're looking to do is to grow
that and we're looking to take the
25 acres
and develop a state of the
art
training facility.
And we believe in partnering
that partnership, we would
envision to extend
to local agencies in the
area, county,
state and federal.
We also believe that by doing
so that we can
access
other source of funding much
more quickly so
that we can accelerate the
plan. Um
So that would
include
conversations hopefully in the near
future with Donan Donan
Community College to
get their criminal justice and law enforcement
program moved down to Sunland
Park.
There's a lot of reasons why we're
looking at this. But one
of the main reasons uh
for those of you that maybe haven't
had the chance to travel the 2000
mile border,
there is a clean canvas in this,
in this area for the port of entry
and the movement of northbound
traffic. So uh
growth is eminent
in this area. And so we need to look
ahead and stay ahead of
it.
Finally, I would say that this
uh the vision for this
25 acre development
we'll be looking
at
right. So we're,
we're about a third
behind on,
on the number of officers, which is
why we've begun our the
academy in order to be able to
recruit
um more,
more officers into our
department.
Uh Some of the other things that we
have done in terms of
capacity
building
is we've also launched a P
SS A program,
um public
service aid. The city of
Sunland Park has never had a public
service aide. So I believe
I heard Senator Cervantes earlier
talking about up
at UN M you know, just getting more
officers out in the streets. Uh
you know, it could be
psychological, but the
fact that you see somebody in
uniform
gives a sense of security,
right? And so we
saw the value in having a
PS A and I do want to acknowledge
again the collaboration,
a chief story in Las
Cruces, worked directly with our
chief and, and we're able
to assist us as we
developed the framework
for establishing a PS A program.
Again, we couldn't do these things
if uh departments like
Las Cruces that have been well
established for decades. Uh
weren't open
to uh receiving
smaller departments like Sunland
Park and, and assisting us
as we launch that program. So we
now have our first PS A
out on the streetss and they're
able to assist and increase
visibility,
right?
I also want to let you know that we
launched our canine
unit.
I was unaware, but there are
two sites nationwide
where you can actually get these uh
canines trained
for uh this
type of, of work. And
so we have our first canine, we've
invested in, in all
of the equipment, the vehicle and the
training. And by the way, we're
at a huge advantage
of the two sites
nationally.
Uh The uh
Fort Bliss is one
of the two training sites.
And the advantage we
have is not only its
proximity,
uh They are trained these
canines uh
really by the best
uh in, in uh
federal law enforcement,
but our annual
recertification is at
no cost. Uh So
we're taking advantage of
that. Um
And then lastly, I'll say
that, you know, we've like everyone
else. We, we need to make sure that
we stay ahead of
technology. We've
invested in technology.
Uh so law enforcement
and as well as
fire, uh both
are now certified and,
and we've got some high-end
drones that we're able to put up in the
air for a number of just
needs everything
from
prior to this administration.
We were having a huge
number of incidents.
And so, you know, sometimes we,
during the summer when the
Gio Grande is running, we'd have
drownings.
Um, we had one
incident a few months
ago
where the in the
immigrant was on the up
rail. It's a class one rail that
runs parallel to the
Sunland Park along the border
and, uh, the migrant
fell off and had his
legs,
uh cut off
and, and so, you know, there's just these
areas where we can't get
our, our trucks up there. And
so we're, we've launched this
uh drone technology as well.
So just uh again,
just capacity
building.
This next slide is talking
about our third
initiative and that's the one
stop shop where the
fire station and police station
will go.
Um If
you ever, I if
you're not familiar with Sunland Park,
I would describe it
as
it's municipal
boundaries
are approximately 10
miles long from the
border
and it uh mcnutt
which is a state dot
Road
known as New Mexico
273
bisect
the 10 miles. It goes
straight up and it's about two
miles wide. So we're just under 20
square miles. And mother can
I interrupt you for just a moment
when you said something, you said
your municipal boundary is
10 miles, but
that's 10 miles in length along.
But you also, you also said it in a way that
you're not 10 miles from the border of Mexico.
You're, you're actually how,
how far is the city of
Southland Park from the border with
Mexico. Yeah. So the 10 miles
measures from the fence
to the north end and my
office is
probably
a quarter mile. I can see
the border fence. It's very
close from here to the other end of the
football field
is the distance from your
office to the border. But,
but in terms of the municipal
boundaries, how close the right up
against the Roosevelt easement. So
we're right up against the border on
the fence. And that's
what, that's the point I want to make.
Park is on the border. We are on
the border. I can take
you over there and I put your hand if
you've never been to put it
through the ball and,
and then you can claim you been
there that I walk around
the fence. So I, and
then I go, I do that. I
can do that.
You can, you
can.
Um So the,
this is the location of
where the new one stop shops
going. We
did secure 950,000
federal dollars. We're in the
process of getting our
design contract for both
the fire station and PD
station to start
design. Our
PD station
is estimated
about $8
million uh
which we have not yet
secured, but we do
have a philosophy
uh in how we
develop projects. Once
we identify the need, we,
we like
many, we want to make sure we're doing
our proper planning, moving to
design and then construction. So
next year in about
12 months, we'll start looking at
uh funding strategies
for, for construction and
we're also looking at development
impact fees as the city grows
so that we can start funding,
putting some local dollars towards
some of this
infrastructure.
And then lastly, I'll talk about
border security and this is probably
what you're more interested in.
Um So
I had a conversation with
the agent in charge
from the Santo Teresa
port of entry,
Mr.  Theus.
And, um, one of
the uh
key facts
is that under this new
administration, uh
that came in, in
January, we have
seen a significant
reduction in the number of
incidents,
uh in the Sunland Park
area.
The number of incidents
prior to this administration
was hovering between 305
100 according to  Mr.
Theus, we're now
hovering between
3040
immigrant crossing incidents
per day.
So you can see it's a tenfold
reduction, right? I mean, it's,
it's significant,
um, about a
year ago when we were having
conversations,
those conversations
uh were
really centred
around not only the
intensity
but the
severity of those crossings
were, were starting
to, uh
become a little
more alarming
historically. What, what you would
see is when immigrants come
across, uh most
immigrants primarily were
coming across, they were looking for
work,
things have changed a lot. And so
what you're gonna start seeing now what
you'll hear from border patrol and this is why I
would invite next time. Uh
Senator Cervantes, I will
make sure we get border patrol there.
Is that gun trafficking
and drug trafficking was a
billion dollar
business.
What you don't see advertised
in the CNN or other news
is that the new business
for, uh, the Mexican
side and the cartel side is
centred around human
trafficking, what
the border patrol will tell you
is that um,
the average human can
be sold nine
times.
They're well networked.
Um, some of the issues that
have changed or evolved in the
last 24 months.
Uh And again, prior to,
to this administration, it has start,
started to go down, but we started
to see an uptick a year
ago, the conversation would have been
around uh the
recruitment of high school
students
um from
the cartel over on this side
where they, they would co-ordinate
drop off of
uh immigrants,
uh immigrants that were crossing
and they, they would be picked
up in
vehicles
and driven to their
destinations. Uh
Border patrol calls them as
organized working cells
across the USA
lot of these um
immigrants that are coming to the
US are being sold
really under the
pretense that they're being crossed
and they're working their debt off. Right.
That's how the human trafficking
works. And these folks
are being dropped off in the
larger cities such as city
of Albuquerque,
Denver,
uh Phoenix,
Chicago all across the
nation.
And it makes it very difficult for law
enforcement, whether it's
federal or
local or even state
to deal with it because of
the division of
responsibilities.
For example,
our local PD department
cannot detain
immigrants.
Uh So one of the things that we have
done working with some of the
businesses, right,
as the senator pointed out, we're, we're
right there. We're
hundreds of yards away from the border
fans. So they're coming across
and so when they were trying to get
into some of the local businesses at
night or in the middle
of the day to, to take
cover from the heat or, or
to hide and wait
for their pickup time,
they, we started to
experience incidents where they were
looking to actually get more
aggressive, some people
actually experienced physical
interaction.
Uh And so what
we, what we did working
along with border patrol
is educate
the business owners that we could
trespass them. The local PD
could, but we needed a
written
authorization. And so we
assisted in the
proper language so the folks
could issue the local PD
uh a trespass notice
giving us uh the,
the right of entry into their, into
their property.
The other challenge is that
these uh young
teenagers that were being recruited
to drive off with the
immigrants,
um
you know, they have no regard for the
law, right? And so if they're being
chased by local PD,
because maybe they run a stop sign,
there's, there's reasonable cause
uh they're speeding,
right? And so
uh RPD, I'm,
I'm sure like like others
have policy and so
you, uh it's very difficult
because you can't always just continue the
pursuit and then we're right next to the
state line. So we have no
jurisdiction if they go, get
beyond the state line. And
so that we do have
communication and coordination on
the Texas side. But again, these
incidents are
unplanned, right? So it's very
difficult to respond that,
that quick
for border patrol, what they'll tell
you is that they're, they're not
gonna engage in a pursuit
because that's not within their jurisdictional
authority. And so
we have these, these
issues that we're having to
work uh work
through uh which make it
very, very difficult. So what we're
thinking about is legislators.
Uh I, I would highly
recommend and again, I apologize.
Our chief couldn't be here today but
working through legislation that
would allow PD to have
a little more
tools in
assisting federal
law enforcement uh as,
as we combat
uh this issue of
illegal gun trafficking, drug
trafficking, but more importantly,
human
trafficking.
Um
One of the other benefits
though that I, I
did hear from
agent in charge
Daes this
morning is
he, he wants to applause
and he wanted me to pass that on to
you. Um
Really the New Mexico
criminal prosecution acceptance
is at 100% right when
they're being federally
um prosecuted in
the past, I, my understanding
is that wasn't
happening that the cases were being
accepted here in, in
New Mexico. But, but now they
are and that's been through the
collaboration
um encourage
collaboration both at the state
level uh with, with our
um partner
federal agencies. And so
uh I'm sharing
that with you. Um
And then with that, uh
how important is a border
fence? It's true today, if you
go out to Sulin
Park.
So on the far
east end of the city of
Sunland Park, right at the
Texas New Mexico State
line is
Cristo Rey.
You will recognize Cristo
Rem because at the base of
it, you will see the Rio
Grande
at the top of it. You will see
a large
um
cross.
There is no
fence
on top of that.
It is owned by the
diocese, the Catholic
diocese. And
so people that is one of the
primary hotspots entry
points from Mexico
into the
United
States
border fences
do
assist
in um
diminishing the problem in
minimizing the number of
crossings uh from
a technical standpoint. Those border
fences are designed. But
it's, it's a, it's called the P Three
Bollard. It's a steel bollard, but
it's, uh, re rein,
excuse me, it's filled
with,
um,
concrete
and it's designed to
cause a two hour delay
because a lot of times historically,
in the existing fences, if
you drive them, they were like a, a
thick wire mesh and
so often the cartel would
cut through them. You
could. Um,
and so, uh, it,
it, you do see the
number of incidents reduced.
Um, when I,
when I speak to
border patrol, uh, the,
the border fence not only
reduces the number of incidents,
but it does bring a level
of protection for the
agents out in the field. There
have been instances that
have been recorded where,
um, border agents will
get jumped, physically
attacked and at the end
of the day, you know, they're just like you and
I need to have a family to go
to.
So with that, I'm gonna pause there and,
and, uh, field any
questions?
Thank you very much a lot
in there. Um, first
of all, I don't know. Are we online
again? Ok. I've got
a thumbs up. That's good.
Um, I apologize
to those of you who have been
offline for a little bit. We've
done everything we can here
with our technical staff to try and
keep the audio and video going.
We ran into some problems this
morning. I know that's
disturbing to some that when
you're chairing this, you have two
options. One is to just wait on the
meeting for the problem to
be resolved. That's
not something that I generally
like to do. And I hope the committee will
understand why you're
all here. You've come a long way for me to
sit here and wait, an uncertain
technical problem that may
never get resolved, could
waste a lot of valuable time with
our speakers people we've
put together for an agenda. We've got
judges here, a lot of people. So,
and then, and your time is valuable
and you come a long way too. So I, I
made the election. I know
I've already got folks
threatening with foundation of open
government and all kinds
of inspection of
public records and open meetings
violation. So you all,
you can go find
my website and
I'll ignore your
emails.
That's a joke.
Um
But, but any event, uh, so
I've, I've made the decision for us to continue
on in the absence of
the, of the online program
and I appreciate we've been joined
by everybody. Now. I felt very lonely
this morning for a while.
Um I was the
only male with, I think
eight females. And
so I was feeling very
put upon you
just, you know, from a
gender
anxiety, but I'm OK
now.
So thank you all. Welcome
to, to here. We, we had some good
presentation on the Second
Amendment earlier today.
Uh So questions for  Mr.
Infante. We've got a number of folks here
already here for the 1130.
Brandon. I'm gonna push over
the, I'm gonna, I'm actually, I'm gonna
try to keep the 11.
I know you're, you're grimacing,
but figure out how we do
David Bona Ventura in five
minutes. I think we can. Right?
So we can do David in 5/10
minutes.
I think, I think it's, I think it's
important. I think it's important for the committee
to hear that, uh,
presentation with the judges
here before we move into that too. So
let's stay with  Mr.  Infante for 30
minutes and we've had a lot of folks
now. Big committee. Um,
so I'm gonna see and, and
I'm gonna see how many folks we can get in here. So
Eleanor Chavez
and
Senator Trujillo, was that you
too?
OK. This is
Ferrari
CIA Lopez.
Lock
on my right on the left side.
Yeah.
And who else? Anybody
else? Ok.
All right. We can do everybody
for about four minutes.
I'm gonna try and keep you pretty tight
to that. So we don't get too far. So please
stay on that unless you're really on a great
roll. Four minutes
each, Miss uh
Chavez Representative
Chavez. Thank you,
Mr.  Chair.
I do have
um probably two
or three questions
for you
in, in terms of the
um acquiring Sunland
Park Elementary School, I've been to
that elementary school, very
vibrant
school. Um
when I was there, there were lots of
kids um
met some of the teachers.
And so my question
is,
have have there
been any conversations
with the community in terms
of what they think about
possibly losing their
school?
Um Mister Chair
and uh
Representative Chavez members
of the committee. So
those conversations have been
had, but those conversations
have appropriately been had
between Gatson independent school
district and
the community.
And as you can imagine,
as it is
common, uh
not just in New Mexico, but
across the nation,
oftentimes
those conversations aren't pleasant
because most
folks get
um attached to the
schools, right?
And so um there's
been a lot of questions
about
the consolidation
that that has been occurring at
guest and schools.
Um
That would be probably about
all I can really share with you because I,
I haven't been
part of
those conversations. These are
second-hand uh
dialogue that I've
had with the superintendent of the
school district.
Thank you and
mister chair. I think
that the
information that I'm getting is
that there hasn't been a
conversation.
Um The union
that represents those teachers
certainly has not heard about
it. So I
would encourage you
to
encourage the district
to be a little bit more
open with the
community and
with the uh school
employees at,
at um,
Sunland Park Elementary, I
don't live there, but I would hate
to see us lose
any elementary school at
all um, in any part
of the state.
Then my other um
question is
you, you mentioned something
about
um
smuggling guns
and drugs coming
over from Mexico.
I
remember
at some point in time
hearing that
the drug smuggling was
going the other
way
um in terms of guns
going into Mexico,
Mr.  Chair, because
it's not that easy
for
um
cartel members to get guns
in Mexico. So therefore they were
going into
from the United States into
Mexico. So can you
elaborate on that a little
bit,  Mr.
Chair uh members
of the committee Representative
Chavis. Unfortunately, I cannot.
And one thing you'll learn about me is
if I don't know, I, I'm
not gonna mislead anybody.
I, I just don't have those
facts. I'm
sorry. Uh
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. I
think that one of the things then
is that
if we don't know
if the guns are actually
coming this
way,
um Then
maybe we should have a little bit
more. I like to
see data. I like to see
documentation.
Um  Mr.  Chair, I don't
think it's good
for us to just merely
repeat things that maybe
we've heard or somebody else has
told us.
Um So if you
can do that, that would be great and,
and pass that information along to
the committee  Mr.  Chair because
again, my
understanding is that
guns are not coming
into the US from
Mexico. It's the other way
around and that's actually
how the cartels are being
armed  Mr.  Chair.
Thank you. Thank
you.
Thank you  Mr.  Chair and
thank you um
uh uh
manager.
I'm sorry.
Um
In Fonte. Yes. Thank
you. Um I
um
years ago, um
we used to come down to Sunland
Park and be at the police station
to do um victim
impact panels for DW
I uh court
pointed or,
or
people to go to
and the
facility for the police
department was very
um old.
Have you replaced it in the
past 20
years?
Thank you. Um
Mr.  chairman and representative
uh for a, the,
the facility
is still the same. It's an old elementary
school that was donated from
Gatson schools to
the city of Sunland Park and it's
incorporation uh
in 1983
was the incorporation. It opened in
1984.
Um No, it's
still the same facility and it's still
very old. I mean, there's been some, some
rent, some basic renovations
and upgrades. Uh but we
are looking to uh
in our current schedule. Uh
We have a 30 month schedule
to um
relocate PD
into its new facility in the more
centralized location that
we
presented.
Um Thank you,
Mr.  Chair and thank you
Mr.  Infante. I
um because that I think
would be a bigger concern
than having a um
a public safety
training facility
and also who
um would be
sharing this facility,
is that going to and
help border patrol?
Um You know,
other groups in the
area enforcement
groups. Thank
you. Representative. Yes. So
the, the vision would
be that it would, it would be shared
with Gatson schools,
Donna Community College to provide some
classes if we can migrate some of
those, uh,
criminal justice programs and
courses down, uh, uh
to Sun Park
as opposed to having students drive
all the way to Las
Cruces. Um, and
then, uh, the idea
would be to share it with,
uh, the county as well. The
county, uh dasu
uh state police. We,
we in law
enforcement and really in all areas,
but in law enforcement, we do work
well with those other
agencies. Um
and, and then border patrol
and, and CBP customs border
protection, which we also have
a strong relationship with
uh down by the border.
Um  Mr.  Chair
and  Mr.  Impro,
um my
concern is we're
militarizing our kids
and their education,
um you know, for the
convenience of border
protection um
and enforcement that
probably isn't needed.
Um and also
to um
uh force out
in elementary school that
people might still
support to be
um
incorporate inside of
their community.
So
I hope to watch how
that goes.
Thank you,  Mr.
Chair.
Thank you, Senator
Lopez and then
represented,
thank you  Mr.  Chair
on, on your
page. The last page where you
have border security.
The last comment
says New Mexico
criminal prosecution acceptance
is 100% which is a
deterrent. I
didn't, I didn't,
OK. I don't understand what that
means and I didn't get a sense
that you explained it in your
presentation.
Thank you, Senator
Lopez. Members of the committee.
I, you know, I, I didn't, so that's a great
question. So,
um, paraphrasing
my discussion with,
um, agent in
charge stay is what, what
that was really his
comment was alluding to that
because now when there's
a criminal complaint
for an immigrant that's been crossing
and then they, they contact,
um,
the New Mexico
prosecutor, right. At the Federal
court, they're taking
all of the cases. And what they're
saying is that
historically, that
wasn't, uh,
the sentiment, some of the
cases would actually not be federally
prosecuted. And what he's saying
is now they're starting
to, the uh, intelligence
is telling them that on the
Mexican side with cartels, they're
starting to see how the
um, enforcement is
tightening up in New
Mexico. And so that's
actually contributing or
deterring people from
uh
the number of crossings which has
contributed to actually lowering,
lowering the number of
incidents.
The reason I'm confused
is because
immigration has a civil
aspect and then
there's a separate
criminal, you know,
prosecuting for, for
crimes that are committed
and um,
ice detention
of people who haven't committed a
crime is civil
in nature. That's why we have
civil detention
facilities. So to me,
100% of criminal
cases
is normal. Um,
you know, I, I guess I'm not
understanding
what the difference is like.
It's like, yeah, the
prosecutor has an obligation to
prosecute crimes.
My understanding. So
I don't get it. Yeah. No,
thank you, Senator Lopez. My
understanding from um, again,
visiting with border patrol
is that when they would
have incidents and they would report them, they
wouldn't be pursued,
right? And, and therefore
not even entertain for prosecution.
My understanding is that
the interaction that's working
between New
Mexico and border patrol
is
proactive.
So, so perhaps the word
isn't,
isn't,
there is a crime that is
committed? There's nothing
to stop anyone
from collaborating
on, like you said,
human trafficking, which is a
really serious thing that has
not been adequately
handled um by the
state. And I'm really glad the federal
government is finally taking an
interest. So I'm
really happy about that
gun um
trafficking. I'm
really happy that they're trying
to take an interest in that.
It bothers me that you say that that
hadn't happened. Now, those are
criminal issues.
So,
um
what uh what
concerns me
is, are they
prosecuting in federal
courts?
<AAA> misdemeanor
which is crossing
the illegal crossing?
That's, that's what confusing about
this. Um
Because you said you, you're
connecting it to
the crossings are down
and a crossing.
It used to not be any, any
kind of crime at all. It was just a
civil violation and now
they upgraded it to be a
misdemeanor.
So is
the, are the, the
prosecutors, the federal
prosecutors, are they
prosecuting misdemeanors
now?
Um Senator Lopez.
So we have had
incidents when there is a crossing
when vehicles are, are
loaded up and there have been
chases and there's been wrecks,
someone has been injured those
sort of, sort of aspects.
Now, I, I
will say I don't
have the definition of criminal
versus civil suit.
The, I'm providing the
information that border patrol
gave to you but, or gave to
me, excuse me and put it on there.
Um, but
again, only
those incidents,
as I understand it that can be
prosecuted for criminal are being
accepted by the
state.
Ok. Accepted by
the state. You can't prosecute
a federal crime in a state in
a state
um
criminal justice system.
The federal courts
in, in the state of Mexico up in Albuquerque
is what I'm referring to
the
language.
Thank you. I'm sorry,
I was being very legal
a because I'm not
an attorney and so
I was just like the state is not going to take
on these federal crime. So
OK, I
would try to clarify that because that
was really confusing.
At least to me, I got
very confused about what that
meant. Um And then
the other question or the other point
you've made is
uh that somebody and I'm not, I
can't remember exactly
who wanted more
tools.
Um
What do you mean by
tools?
So when we're talking about tools,
the Aerostat, for example, which is
a blimp that the border
patrol uses and puts up in the air
uh that's used for surveillance
that was down for. Uh my
understanding is over a
year that is now back up,
which is good because
we're able to monitor. The
other um example
would be it is
uh through, through
Stone Garden. We've been able
to um also
acquire uh these
truck mounted
um for lack of better
word binoculars if you
will. So you can have long
range surveillance onto
the, onto the the
border fence
area by
tools you meant technology,
technology. Thank
you. I I just didn't
understand the context. Thank
you,  Mr.  Chair. I appreciate
the, thank you represent
Block for up to four
minutes.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank you so much,
sir. Appreciate you for being
here, Infante.
So few questions
for you. I know we touched
a little bit on the drone technology.
Can you tell me how you're working
in coordination with federal
officials when it comes to
just one of the aerospace?
Maybe? Pardon me for the
the weird uh thing.
But uh can
you tell me a little more about that? And
then also when it
comes to your statistics that
you showed when it comes to illegal
border crossings versus
the previous, let's
just say last year and now
how is that positively
affected your area
since you have a lot less
crime flooding through the
country?
Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman, Representative
Block and members of the committee.
So
in terms of how we're co-ordinating
with the drone technology
um
already in
this summer with,
with the Rio Grande running when we've
had incidents of folks
that have not familiar with, with
the, with the river. Uh
we've, we've been able
to get the
drones up with our fire
department to be able to scan
through. If you're
so, in the Rio Grande, through
the city of Sunland Park, there's
a heavily vegetated area
where it's very difficult to get
equipment in there. When I say
vegetated, it's not like the boke
up in Albuquerque. I'm talking about
large mesquite.
So, uh, dune
like, and so you
can't just get in there with a
truck. And so the, the drone
technology has become very,
very important for getting
eyes on the ground
trying to
identify where
um an individual,
a migrant individual might be. And then
we can go ahead and uh
assist uh
the um border
patrol. And a lot of those
are frankly for rescue.
Um for example,
uh during the summer,
our, our fire department chief will
tell you that um you
know, we get a lot of immigrants,
immigrants, unfortunately that
are uh struggling
or have
heatstroke. And so
we have to uh
essentially put them in a body
bag with ice to cool them
down. Um
So it, it gets pretty
serious. Um
So that
that's how we've been
co-ordinating our, our drone
technology. We do also have
to co-ordinate because there are specific
laws and as to how
close we can actually fly the
drones on the border
fence, uh those would
be special assignments that would
be done. Um
And then your second question
was, yes, I was just
asking generally how it's
impacted you positively. But it
appears from what I've
read on your presentation
of what you've said, it's been
a positive development to have a lot
more resources in the southern
part of our state
to apprehend
criminal alien
trespassers into the
country as well as
protecting individuals
who are coming here
illegally. And, you know,
like you said, people are literally
dying in the desert. It's like the most
inhumane possible thing
ever. And I, I did
take a tour of the
area last
year and we went around the
border and around your
area and it
seemed that a lot of
that crime that was pouring
through Mount Cristo
Rey because it's wide
open was going directly
into the backyards of folks
in Sunland Park. So I'm just
wondering how is it positively affected
the actual, in the
actual people who live in Sunland
Park when it comes to
safety generally?
Thank you, Representative Block. So
on how it's positively
affecting. So one of the things
that was happening quite a bit
um a year ago and
even beyond that. So
when we would get
um
some migrant crossings,
especially
because I've seen it myself, some of them
are really young. They, they would want
to blend in with the school population.
And so that was a
coordination effort that we had
with um gas and
independent schools.
Uh One of the, one of the
um
action, actionable items
that we took is
increase our SRO
our school resource officer
um participation, working
with Godson schools to be able to
be responsive to
that.
Um
So, so just having
that additional border
security and reducing
the number of incidents gives
that positive effect because we have
less of that activity
uh happening. We have had
incidents uh where
we have had to do a
lockdown. I know of
one that occurred this year
earlier in the year.
Um over at Santa Teresa
Middle school off of
mcnutt.
So I hope I answered your
question. Thank you
so much, madam chair.
Pardon me? I didn't see the chair run
away. I appreciate that.
So my next
question would hopefully I'm not
running out of time, but I'm asking
we're running up over four minutes.
Oh, we are ok, then I will just stop
there, but I'm sure I can pass my
question to somebody else. Thank you madam chair.
I apologize for going over. No, you're
fine. Thank you.
Ok. We've
got Representative Anya
nou
No, we don't. I think that
I'm
I believe it was me madam chair.
Thank you so much. Thank you for the
clarification. Yes.
Um madam
chair. Thank you. Um
for coming today.
I want to address a couple of
things. I know
representative Lock talked
about some things, some actions,
being inhumane, but I just
want to say first and foremost,
people are not
illegal. Um
So I'll put that out there and the
second piece is calling
people, aliens
is dehumanizing.
And if you look at this
historically, it is not
OK to dehumanize
people.
Um I
say this in the context, our
national context right now
and all of
the
in humanity that's happening.
And so I'll put that out there
first, I'll get to my questions now,
madam chair point of order. Since
I was, since I I
was said by name,
I just want to, I want to clarify
madam chair us
code specifically
says illegal
alien in us code. I just
want to be very clear, my reputation's
on the line here and I don't want to be called
inhumane by members of this
committee by thank you madam,
apologies for calling you by
name. I do apologize
for that but I will
say it is inhumane to
call people aliens.
So
um you have
some stats on your last
page. Um
About 100%
criminal prosecution. I was just
wondering of the number of
people who
are coming into
this country. What
per cent of those
who are crossing are
actually involved in criminal
activity?
Uh Madam chair and
uh representative and I I don't
have that number ma'am but I can get it for
you and I've taken notes for
the other members so I can get you your
information back. So I really appreciate
it. Thank you. Um
And madam chair or  Mr.  Chair
at this point. Um
I say this because
the percentage really matters
because the public
perception
right gets picked up in the
media and
the perception that we
have tons of
people who are coming, who are
criminals
is being used to justify
snatching families like going
into neighborhoods snatching
families. Um
So I would like to know  Mr.
Chair. Um
right now in the Sunland
Park and Sunland Park
area, are we
sending ice into
neighborhoods?
Um Madam chair
and representative and I am
members of the committee. No,
thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
And just
because we have seen this happen,
it happened in Albuquerque.
It's happening across the country.
Can you give an update on the
status of Ice agents
wearing masks?
Um Since I've been there, I haven't
seen an ice agent, but I can
tell you that our council would not support
that. Uh I mean,
just to elaborate
the border community life
is very different. We have
two Mexicans
nationals that work in Sunland
Park. It's very customary
to uh in, in
the border area to live on
one side and work in the other.
Um It's a very different environment
unless you've lived there.
Right? No,
I know many, many
families who live
their life on both sides of the
border. So I definitely see
that, I also think that
sub repression is real.
And so we also have to talk
about that. And so
um I'm really glad to hear
that the the council wouldn't
support masked
agents. It seems a bit
cowardice.
Um Do you
know if I
right now is intending
on masking their agents in
the Sunland Park
area.
Madam chair and
represent II I have
not heard nor
do I know. Thank
you. Um And
madam chair, I would
just like if
at all possible, some kind of
commitment from the
city, from the county, from the Sunland
Park area that if this begins to
happen, um
that uh the city, the
county et cetera would be public
about speaking out. So,
thank you, madam, chair,  Mr.
Chair.
Thank you. Um I'm next
on the list, so I'm gonna go ahead
and ask a few questions. I
just want to clarify.
Um  Mr.  City
Manager that
you're part of the Gadsden school
district. Correct.
That is correct. Thank
you. I, I didn't think there was
a separate district II, I
know there's been some comment about
the elementary school having
served for two terms,
eight years on a school
board. I recognize
it's really difficult to
close an elementary school, but in
many cases it has to
happen. Um And
so I always
appreciate the fact that
we're looking for other
alternatives to use those
schools that are
still probably
in good shape. So I'm
excited about the
idea of this
CTE program. I
want to make sure though, you said
it's only 12th
graders.
Um M Miss Madam,
chair members of the committee.
We, we've been working
primarily with 12 graders
at, at this start. Uh
I'm learning a lot about law
enforcement, not being not being
one, one of the things
I've learned is I, if we can
get them at the 12th grade
level,
um,
law enforcement
officers
are, at least in Sunland
Park do not, are not
allowed to, to be
filled on the
field until they're 21.
And so it, they've got sort
of three years to develop
and so we want to make sure that
we, not
everyone that we attract is going to be
a law enforcement officer. Somebody
might want to go into a different area
of law enforcement and we
want to be that career ladder for
them. Thank you,  Mr.
Chair. I, I want to just point
out there's a number
of CTE programs
for law enforcement
careers around the country.
I had the opportunity to tour
one in Kansas
City, um probably
about six or seven years ago
and they did everything from
fire to forest
ranger. They
kids get to work in
forensic, they get to work
with technology, which includes
drones. So I
encourage you guys to look at
going below the 12th
grade level and,
and, and even looking at
summer programs
for middle school
students who, you
know, could get a little taste of what
they might be experiencing
and then want to go into the
program when they
are uh at the
right age. And
then, um, you indicated
that the first cohort
this is on and I don't
see page number. So I apologize.
You indicated that this is the
first cohort just
graduated in July.
Is that the community
college or is that the 12th
graders? Uh, thank
you. Um
It's, it's the community
college. We had uh
two young men and one
young lady, uh come out of
that uh program.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. So,
um that's great. So three
people. Um And
then interesting
uh last question
I noticed that uh
your money is coming from
the USDA odd
place to get money. But
I know I do recognize that
they do those kind of community
buildings, everything from grocery
stores to
apparently, um
this kind of design is that
grant impacted at all.
Um Are you looking
at possibly losing some
of that or is that grant?
Federal?
Safe
uh madam chair, that
grant is safe. And that was one
of the first conversations we had
with the new administration
took
office.
Ok. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair
and thank you for presenting. And
again, I these
uh CTE programs
when we look at, where
do we need
employees of the
future? And
we know that
healthcare
schools, law
enforcement, those are all
careers that we need in government.
So, thank you for what you're doing. Thank
you,  Mr.
Chair.
We'll go, oops, uh rip
of Silva. I can recognize you
for four
minutes.
Thank you, chair. Um Thank
you so much city manager. Um I just
came from Sunland Park. I was visit,
visiting with Superintendent
Dempsey uh this
morning. Uh So I appreciate
the presentation um
under capacity
building. I have a question. The
Board of County Commissions
for uh Donna County
is considering a
$165
billion industrial
revenue bond next
month. And I'm wondering if
uh the Sunland Park City Council has
a position on
that bond um or
any feedback for the county commission.
Thank you,
chair
um  Mr.  Chair,
members of the committee
representative. Uh
the City Council has
not expressed a position
on, on that.
Um
I'll leave it at
that.
Thank you, chair. That's
all
criminal justice and the importance of
criminal justice in our state. And,
and the fact we've been joined
by many others later
in the day, the fact that
and I see many of the people in the community
who are very active and concerned with crime in
our state. One of the things that's
always interesting for me is
uh the argument
oftentimes made that well, our crime
in New Mexico is a consequence,
particularly in Albuquerque. It's a
consequence of our laws
or of our proximity,
the border or of
immigrants and, and
drugs and so forth. And, and
it's always interesting to me because
um not only does
Sunland Park border
Mexico,
Souther part, Puerto, El Paso.
And uh just the
latest statistics, El
Paso has the lowest
crime rate of any city
in the United States with a
population over
500,000.
I hope that sinks
in for,
for, for a large size
city. Well, but
it, and you can say, well, it's in Texas.
Yes, it's, but it's on the border
and it's got a immigrant population
that's much greater even than, than we have in
New Mexico. And so if it's
drugs and if it's immigrants and it's
border, that doesn't
explain el paso.
Um, and
representative to your point,
I mean, that being in Texas,
Sunland Park of New
Mexico cities is rated
in the top 10 safest
cities in the state.
Uh That's in my district and,
and maybe I'll take credit for that.
Um I, I shouldn't because I have
nothing to do with it but,
but Sunland Park
and Anthony,
both heavily
Hispanic
immigrant
border communities
are consistently rated the two
safest cities in the state of New Mexico.
So in part
on the border with
Mexico
cannabis.
Well, yeah,
I gotta send over say it's because
high over there, Su
Park and you guys have how many dispensaries
I'm told it's 3030 something,
right? 30 something dispensaries. So
maybe that's the solutions. Just
get everybody stoned. I
don't know. But, but,
but remember that the laws
in Sunland Park are the same laws
that are in Albuquerque, the laws
in Anthony are the same laws that are in
Albuquerque, right? Same
laws. I got, we got cops here from
the city of Las Cruces. We got you guys here
too. Um
The data is in
front of us, right? The logics in
front of us, we just have to start
applying some of it and connecting
the dots. So II I did want to
give uh Mario and
so Park Kudos for
that. Um And,
and I, and I asked myself, I go
down there and I look at the chief and I talked
to how come it's safe here
in Sunland Park. Uh And it's
not in Albuquerque
and, and um the
answer I get is not something we can
legislate. Unfortunately, usually the
answer I get is that Sunland Park
is very much a community, right?
Everybody knows everybody's
business. You step out of your
line, your tia is gonna know about it
and she's going to tell your other tia
and, and before you know it, you Abuela's
gonna know about it and you're in
trouble. Right.
Um, and so
I, I don't know how we legislate that. I,
I don't, but, but it's still a
very cohesive community.
Like I wanted to take the moment
to do that. I also did,
um, take a couple of
Pothos earlier, but
I'll do them again.
Um, only,
only because again, uh,
we talked about the
fact that the fence you talked about
quickly, the, the border
fence, so-called border fence runs
to Cryto Rey and then it ends at Crystal
Rey. Right? And it's never
gonna cross Cryto Rey. I think it's
probably a safe way to say it again, that's
owned by the diocese and the diocese
is never gonna put up a fence
there. And so
again, for everyone who's
really excited about my, my
topic of painting the
fences over there, you
know, keep a couple of things in mind.
Um, I, I work
on the border of, I've lived my whole
life in a border farming
community. We have gloves
number one.
and, and we also know when it gets
dark. Uh
And so, you know,
it's cute to get the
headlines and have,
uh, the homeland Security
out there with a roller brush, painting the
fence black, uh,
but it gets
dark at night
here and, and we
also, um, are pretty good
about knowing how to put on
some gloves and other things. So let's be
real about this and, and again,
I I confirmed my, my
earlier potshot but it's
real. I went out there with Senator
paper when they're building the so-called
private fence. It was, it was a, it
was a campaign, it was
a, a private campaign called
Build a Wall. Or we'll build
the wall where they raised a little
over $20 million.
It hurt me to see
people sending in money
to an organization like
that. Uh,
where, uh,
the C Bannon
this earlier this year, uh,
pled guilty to
fraud. Um, and
of course, was pardoned by
the president as a result
of the, but, but nonetheless,
we should be straight about
things with people, right? If you're telling
people, we're gonna send money to us
so we can build a fence
and the money's going into somebody's
pocket, not going into building the
fence at all. But, but it's a
private fundraising deal on
private property in
Sunland Park.
And so I just want the message to get out there.
Yeah, you can put your money
and you can do your photo ops and all that,
but you can walk around it,
right. And people need to understand
that. Uh, and, and
let's, let's try and be real about
some of these things and, and to get
to credit also,
uh, my constituents are happy
to see fewer crossings, right? And
to see lesser crime as a
result of that, we need to give credit where
credit is due and all. So
call out uh the BS
when, when it's appropriate to do that
too. And Mario,
you and the city of Sunland
Park and those of us that represent these border
areas are live in the frontlines,
right? We see it every day. Um
And so I appreciate you being
here and I appreciate the committee getting a chance
to ask you some questions and
really see the, the reality as
opposed to maybe the, the nighttime
news version of what's happening on the
border. So, thank you.
I do. Thank you very much. Thank you
guys. Enjoy the rest of your week
and have a safe trip
back. Thank
you.
We're really fortunate, Mario, you've been, you've
been with the city, said three years. But before
that, you've been local government
for how long around
here?
A lot of that work with colonial,
right? A lot of, a lot of colonial
work. All right.
Um, we've
got a little bit
behind, uh, we got a little
late start in our day. I appreciate
what I'm in a lot of trouble here
because I got judges in the room.
We got a lot of judges in the room
and, uh,
you know, usually if
I'm in their courtroom,
it's a real problem. So,
so I want to respect
their time at the same time.
Brr I really do think this,
this David
Boaventura is worth 10 minutes
before we get the judges here because
I think it sets the context
for the judges and so I asked
Brandon to do this. I, I'm
not meaning to single out this
guy. Uh but I
am. Uh and,
and, and, and
um and the reason is
because what you're gonna
hear, I think is
fundamentally the message
that I've been trying to communicate with this
committee as a legislator
for the last couple of years
as we focus on crime, which is the whole
notion that, well,
Joseph says, we don't need any more
laws and that's not really
what I'm saying, but
Brandon tell us about
Mr.  Bonaventura and
maybe we'll get a better perspective
of what's happening on
crime.
Um As we all know,
Mr.  many of us know
Mr.  Bonaventura was
a star in the Santa Fe
New Mexican who pointed
out that there who pointed
the Santa Fe New Mexican recently
pointed out that  Mr.  Bonaventura
had been
pros or been arrested
repeatedly and it seemed like he
was never prosecuted.
So at the chair's request,
I researched the cases
that  Mr.  Boaventura
has been involved in since
2016
and here are the
results.
Um
I did not include speeding
infractions or minor,
minor traffic stuff and
the number of arrests
looks for me to be
uh somewhere in the neighbourhood of
22. Ok. Go ahead,
please. Ok.
So,
um
he was charged in 2015.
He was charged with driving while his
license was suspended for DW
I, he faced a year for
that. He was fined
$500. In
2016, he
faced nine years for
trafficking of controlled
substance together
with one year for possession of a
controlled substance and another
potential year for
possession of drug
paraphernalia. Uh
The case was dismissed for lack
of prosecution.
Uh In 2017,
he was charged with a felony of
unlawful taking of a motor
vehicle. The case was
dismissed by the district
attorney
in 2017. He was also
charged with trafficking
a controlled substance facing
nine years,  Mr.  Chair.
Sorry to interrupt. Can you just clarify
which jurisdiction he was in in
each of these infractions? Sure,
thank you.
Uh Each of those cases that
I've just related were in
Santa Fe.
Um He will be later on,
he does find some charges in
San in Albuquerque,
but the vast majority of his
criminal history is Santa Fe
County.
In 2017. He was
again charged as I was saying
with trafficking controlled
substances, methamphetamines.
Um He faced
nine years on the
trafficking charge
1.5 years on
the possession as
1/4 degree felony,
1.5 years on the
possession as a uh
of additional
paraphernalia
and he was
sentenced to probation.
The probationary sentence included
three other felony cases
that I'll mention later.
Ultimately, he violated
his probation. His probation
was revoked. He
served a total of
1.2
years.
Um In 2017,
again in Santa Fe, he was
charged with possession of
drug paraphernalia. He
was given a deferred sentence
and 100 and $98 in
fines. Still
in 2017, he was
again charged with possession
of a controlled substance
facing 1.5
years as 1/4 degree
felony. The case
was dismissed for lack of
prosecution.
Still in 2017,
he was charged with receiving
or transferring a motor vehicle, a
stolen motor vehicle.
The case was once again dismissed
for lack of
prosecution
entering 2018,
January,  Mr.
Bonaventura was again charged
with receiving or transferring
a sto stolen motor
vehicle.
This is one of the cases that was
wrapped into the, the
plea bargain in which
he was given probation
and ultimately violated that
probation. The total
time that he did on all those cases
again was a, a little over
a year.
He was charged again
in Santa Fe with
misdemeanor battery.
That's a petty misdemeanor. He
faced 90 days. That
case was dismissed by the district
attorney. Uh
the third and final case
that was wrapped into the probationary
plea bargain
is a 2018
case for possession of controlled
substance, resisting
evading or obstructing an
officer. He faced
a total of 2.5 years
in that case. And again,
that was wrapped into the global
plea agreement.
Still in 2018, he
was again charged with
um possession
of a controlled
substance. That case was dismissed
by the D A.
He was charged in
2024
with larceny,
um over 500
but not more than 2500.
That case was also dismissed
by the district attorney. That
case was also in Santa Fe
County.
Um,
in 2025
Mr.  Bonaventura was charged with
burglary of a motor
vehicle. Uh, that
case was also in Santa Fe
County. That case was also
dismissed by the district
attorney
again in 2025 he
was charged with trans
receiving or transferring a ST
stolen motor vehicle.
Um, this time, he was
charged as a third
offence which made
it a second degree
felony. The case
was bound over.
This is in Albuquerque.
The case was bound over
as a felony. Uh
but when it was bound over
instead of a third
offence, which would be a nine
year second, he would face
nine years as a second degree
felony. It was brought
into District court as a first
offence which makes it 1/4 degree
felony.
Um
in the same year that he was
facing charges in Albuquerque,
which is this year, he
picked up another felony
charge of receiving or
transferring a stolen motor
vehicle in Santa
Fe. And that
case was
that case is
um
ending in front of the
magistrate
court
in the same year, which is this
year,  Mr.
Bonaventura was also again
charged with receiving or transferring
a stolen motor vehicle
in uh Santa
Fe. And that
case was dismissed by
the district
attorney.
Also this year,
he was charged
with unlawful use of
an ATM or debit card
that case is pending in Santa
Fe
County
in the same year, this
year, he was, he was charged
with a, with a misdemeanor
attempt to commit a felony to
wit the burglary of a motor
vehicle. That case was
dismissed by the district
attorney,
the fraudulent use of a
credit card charge, as I
mentioned, remains
pending and
the unlawful taking of a
motor vehicle charged
as a first offence in Albuquerque
remains pending. He
is presently or at least
at the time that I did this research
this past week, he was
incarcerated in M DC.
But the judge in the
second judicial district court
had ordered that once he
completes the
in-patient A TP
alcohol treatment program
at M DC, then he will be
released on conditions.
In addition, there is one final
case which is presently
in warrant in Santa
Fe County, uh
in which uh  Mr.
Boaventura is alleged to
have unlawfully taken a motor
vehicle and damaged
that motor vehicle. Uh
This case is
charged again as
a first offence rather
than a 3rd, 4th or
fifth.
So ultimately, at the end,
he out of facing a grand
total of 63.5 years
of exposure.
Um with some cases
still pending.  Mr.
Bonaventura has served
a total sentence of
1.2
years.
Thank you. Thank you, Brandon.
So, um I
don't think I have to say too much more about
the point that I'm trying to make by this,
but Senator Trujillo.
You'd like to comment.
I just want to make a comment.
Um, our, and I don't,
I'm not a district
attorney. I don't do
criminal law, but I do
know that our
district attorney's
office has a
practice of
dismissing
charges until
they can get enough information
to then refile. So
my suspicion is, is
that some of those
were no
dismissed and then
refilled,
none of those cases were
refiled. Ok. Thank
you. Yeah.
And, and it's a good point when
we're looking at data, we have to be
fair to the,
the prosecutors as well too. That's why I thought
this would be good leaving because we have prosecutor
coming in, we have some judges coming in
and then the next subject.
But when we, when we
think that the solution to crime is by
increasing the penalty
and sentencing and
the cases are essentially just getting mostly
dismissed or pled
down to lower
levels. We can increase all the years
we want and we're, we're
putting on a show for somebody
represent Romero.
Uh Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
Um Just as a sort
of teaching moment. What is,
what is the sort of
reason why
that you can, you know, come
up with as to why this has fallen
through the cracks or hasn't
or you know what,
you know, what does it say about our das?
What, what is your conclusion about
this case study that
you're bringing forth that we're trying
to remedy?
Perhaps
Mr.  Chair representative, I
don't know that I have a conclusion.
Um when the District Attorney's
office files noli
prosequi or just
voluntary dismissals.
They generally don't give a reason
or give a generic reason of
in the interests of justice.
So, from my,
my perspective, my task was
just to find out what happened to these
cases and the vast
majority of them were
dismissed uh
by the district attorney
or dismissed for
lack of prosecution,
which is when the court dismisses it.
It's not on the, it's not the
prosecutor's action,
uh, generally speaking
or most commonly, that's
an officer doesn't show
up, uh, to
prosecute a case
or a necessary
witness won't come to court.
That's the lack of
prosecutions.
And, uh to the earlier
point, uh,  Mr.  Chair
Senator, we did look to
see if these were cases that were
reil.
Yeah. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. I just, I
would love to try to find
something more conclusive as
to what we can do
as legislators to,
you know, understand the relationship
that das have to these
cases in particular
when we're talking about repeat offenders
or, you know, the,
the reality of what they're
facing so that we can help. Is
it a budget problem? Is it
a lack of over side of
data problem? Is this,
uh, you know, what, what's the,
what's the issue we're trying to actually
remedy when we see something like this?
It's funny you would ask,
we, that's our next presentation.
So we're going to talk a little bit about
that, but it is the
question that has plagued me, which
is Yeah, when
we add more sentences,
years to a sentence, what, what
are we accomplishing? Nothing
really? Uh, nothing
at all. And so we'll, we'll find
out where the problem and the breakdown and we're
gonna find it with
prosecutors and district attorneys
and police and judges.
Um, and I say
that it's some peril to my
own personal.
Uh, and, and, but
we've got the cops here. We got, uh,
and they're, and they've been great city cops
are here. We've got the judges here, they're here. We got
the district attorney here. And
so we're gonna do that in our next
presentation. We're gonna take a
minute. Uh, I think it's
lunch ready to go.
So let's let, I'm
gonna ask you all to be really quick. Would you
get a quick plate? Come back
here, get down,
uh, and we'll get started and we'll get
back on the schedule. All
right. And I think it'll be
important. Yeah, we're gonna work through lunch.
So grab a plate quick,
please.
Certainly.
She said
you.
Ok.
Yes.
So.
Ok,
what
happens
Ben Brandon
Piper? This will just take,
I, I'm just gonna have Brandon up there for a couple of
minutes. So thank you for letting us
work through lunch. I know it's a little bit rude
to be eating while we're
talking. I'll try to not do
the same thing at the same time. I'm
gonna have Brandon go first and then he'll
step back. I've asked
Brandon to do a little bit of a
quick presentation
on a subject that has interested
me for a long time. And I think
it's important to lead
into this, uh, discussion
and follow from the last
one which
is where does the role
of the legislature
and the role of the judiciary
as separate branches of government,
where do those, where do those lanes
and where do those circles
exist? And,
um, as a lawyer with about
35 years, sometimes
particularly in the, in the legislative role
that I have. And those lines
to me seem unclear
where, where
does the legislature
begin to pass laws
that relate to the role
of the courts and govern the
courts and where the courts,
uh, tell us to back
off.
I will tell the committee share with
you. Uh, this happened in,
in reality, a
couple of years ago, we
passed, um, a
comprehensive what we call
the time the mni Buss Crime
Bill, which among the
many parts of that bill
combined a lot of your
efforts in, in various
pieces of legislation into one bill,
one of them related to GPS
monitoring. And you all
may remember the controversy that,
uh, surfaced a couple of
years ago where, um,
we had GPS monitoring
people being released on GPS
monitors and
law enforcement wanted the data,
wanted the information.
Uh, the
A OC said this is
our purview,
right? We, the GPS is our
program, our deal. I I'm
getting this, right? But Iaoc
was essentially saying this is ours and,
and the law enforcement does not get
it. Um
And then
as a result of all that, we found
out that the GPS monitoring wasn't
being monitoring after
hours, right after five o'clock on the
weekends, everybody's smiling.
Like, is it this comical? But it's, it's
not really sort of
funny but not really very funny.
So, so if you're a thief or
a crook, you decided to make sure that you violated
the terms of your probation appro after
five o'clock or on the weekends.
Um, and, and nobody
was monitoring that I may
be oversimplifying things. I have a tendency
to do that, uh for
effect. But, um, I
think that's pretty fair
what was going on. So we, so we
passed some legislation during that
to try and free
up the GPS
data.
Not very long after that,
the A <AOC> and the,
and the Supreme Court published
a rule that kind
of took back
what we were trying to
do, uh, in terms
of that data and that was came
within a couple of months and I in,
in, uh, in all candour and
really with, um, I
can say with much
respect, the, I
was able to sit down with some of the justices
on the Supreme Court saying I think you guys
are in our lane. Uh
I think you guys have, I, I
think we want to do something on the
policy we passed a law
and then you guys kind of undid it
by your rule and,
and they may have, uh disagreed
and I may have disagreed and that, that's,
there's nothing wrong with that, but, but they
were good enough to amend the
rule very shortly
after that.
Oh, that's just simply to illustrate
the fact that sometimes this line between
what they do, what you all
do in the judiciary and what we do
is is not clear. So I've asked
Brandon Brennan just 234
or five minutes. Quickly explain
there is some law on this. We have some
law and some cases on
this.
Mr.  Chair members of the committee,
I will try to make this
uh accelerated as
well.
So
the question of where the line is
is extremely blurry, but
the courts have consistently held
that um
the, our court in Mexico Supreme
Court has consistently held that
when judicial
procedural rules
conflict when legislative
statutes conflict with
judicial procedural
rules, the judicial
procedural rules will win
out. The court's
authority comes from the new Mexico
Constitution six
section three which grants it
superintending control
over the courts. The
legislature has also codified
the power to regulate
pleading practice and procedure
in statute at N MS
A 1978
38-1
dash one.
Um
The legislature is able
to enact statutes on
procedural issues
with nonexclusive
jurisdiction. In other words,
both the legislature and the
courts have the power to affect
procedural rules in the
State of New Mexico.
But legi and the legislative
enactments are valid
unless they conflict with
judicial rules.
The court views its authority as
ultimate rather than
exclusive.
Um I won't
go through the list of cases
because it will take more
time. But I
will say that the procedural,
the reason I reference procedural
rules is that procedure
should not affect substantive
rights. Substantive rights
should fall within the purview
of the, of the constitution or
the
legislature.
Um The court attempts to
harmonize statutes and rules where
possible. But again,
the bottom line is that when
the statute
conflicts with the court
rules, the court has
consistently held that the court
rule
wins.
Thanks. That's it in a nutshell.
And, and the, the buzzwords
that came out, I think of what
struck with me, Brandon
is, I think you said
give me get the quote right? The, the
authority of the court is not
exclusive
but, but did you say? But
the paramount right? Supreme.
So the court is recognizing
the Supreme Court held in some of its holdings
that we share some
authority when they say it's not exclusive,
but that they're going to have the final word
on the matter. I guess that probably makes some
sense, ultimate,
ultimate.
And then
you managed to, we, we had a second
amendment discussion earlier this
morning.
Sometimes the courts try very
hard as a, as a lawyer. I
appreciate that trying to
define boundaries and
lines. But in this case, the line, the
boundary is the
court will leave
to the legislature
us to do find substantive
rights and the court will
decide what are procedural rights.
And for me,
those terms
may not have a very clear
distinction and understanding.
So that's the topic before
us today. And we're gonna hear,
I know we want you all want
me to get a notice to the
chief before he's
on. Is he on now?
He's on now?
All right. We're gonna start by talking
about case management orders, but the conversation
is gonna go beyond case management
orders. We're gonna hear a number of people from
the judiciary. I've asked the judges to say
about five minutes each
so that we can get several of the
judges who are working with this day to
day. And then that allows
me about 2025 minutes
or so for, uh,
the district attorney to talk
about how this works in
reality and the
local district attorney and then public
defender as well too. So  Mr.
Bauer is here. District attorney
Mas is here. We got two local
judges. Then we've got
the chief justice Supreme court.
We'll start with him
because that's a good
idea for a lawyer to
do
chief.
He's on
chief. I'm being told
here in the committee
room that you're online but
you're muted.
I hope that's easy
solution.
This is Justice Thompson we're looking
for. Is that what you're looking for. I
don't see. Nothing.
Is there?
Oh, I see. Yeah.
Muted.
Has he not joined us yet? He may
not, he, I know he had some
other conflicting
commitments. Should
we wait for him or go to somebody
else?
Go to somebody else? All right.
Uh, Judge Behi,
I see you there. Can
you hear me? I can,
can you hear me?
Oh, you're gonna have to, we're gonna work on
the audio a little bit, but push
it up as much as you can on
your side
and, uh, go
ahead judge,
be, are you able to
hear me now?
A little better at his faint? So
I really do want you to do everything you can
to improve the vibe.
All right. Well, you picked a very loud
and obnoxious judge. So I'll
do my best to use
that to advantage.
Uh, so I, I
guess in
terms of the line between the
judiciary and the legislature,
at least the way that I've
looked at it is
maybe this is oversimplifying
as you chair mentioned.
You do as well. But I,
I think it is sort of a jigsaw
puzzle where you all
pick the picture
that we're trying to construct.
You all pick
the shape of the
pieces that are gonna be used
to construct the puzzle.
And then as a judge,
I have the inherent
authority to
pick my strategy
as to how I'm gonna put those
pieces together. Do I go
for edge pieces first? Do
I sort by colors
first? How do I go about
doing that to construct
a workable docket?
And so I, hopefully
that shows both the respect
for what you all do.
Uh And the limited role
that I think I have
in trying to carry out
implementation of the laws
that you all pass.
So, uh hopefully
that doesn't do offence to, to the
discussion today.
Um I, I
think that I was asked to come
here because my district
has requested
and recently
received uh
a case management rule.
Am I correct about that
chair?
I'm sorry, maybe I
can management
and then I didn't hear a
question.
Oh, so what I was
asking was to make sure that
I'm correct in
my assumption that I, I've
been asked here because my
district requested and
recently received
a case management
rule. And uh I
wanted to make sure I'm hitting the
right points of interest to you
all in terms of why we did
it, how we did it and what we're
trying to resolve
is that, is that correct?
That's correct. And I, I'm sorry, and
I had a chance to visit with the judges here. So
I, I want you to spend about five
minutes. Really? Not too much
more than that judge talking
about. Why, how,
what is it, case management rule? There's
most of the members of this committee are not
lawyers. So we'd
like you to understand and
then understand what we're talking about
and then how it's working and
why. All right.
So in terms of the
why I can tell you
that cases in
my district and we
do take a hard look at
ourselves here, we
noted that we are taking
substantially longer than
other districts to dispose
of criminal matters that
poses problems
for the ability to
get those cases concluded.
Witnesses are no longer
available. Uh
Things happen over the
passage of time
and then of course, you've got
people during that
time that are on pretrial
services being
supervised by the court
and also are presumed
they're either presumed
innocent and thus
going through that process
unnecessarily long
or they're
guilty and they should be
in some post
sentencing situation,
not just being
supervised by pretrial
services. So
noting how these go together,
my district
decided that
asking for a case
management rule to
shorten that amount of
time to try to
improve efficiency
was an important goal.
So that was in
general, the, the
problem in
terms of why we
went this route
from a big picture
perspective,
lawyers have
an ability uh
in a right, I should say our parties
do through the lawyer to
excuse judges
and through that process,
they can steer to some
extent where cases
go. And so
between noting
that and
noting a frequent
uh criticism,
I think from our
district attorney in the
first that there's
a lack of consistency
with judges in my
district. We
thought that asking for a
case management rule
so that all of the criminal
judges are abiding
by the same rules
so that, you know, we don't
have some judges being excused
and that creates a bottleneck
with the judges that are not being
excused. We
thought that uniformity was the
way to go.
My district
wanted to make sure
that there was maximum
input from stakeholders.
So I think we're the only district
that has done this. We
went to the Supreme Court
for the full rulemaking
cycle. It's been over two
years since I
first went to
the uh criminal
Justice Coordinating Council and told
them we'd be asking for this type
of rule. Um It
doesn't go into effect until
January 1st of next
year. So it's been over two
years that we have been
in the process of getting public
comment, responding to public
comment and the
key to that was also
the Supreme Court has that
statewide
perspective. I I'm
dealing as a chief of, of
a judicial district, they
see how things are working throughout
the entire state or not working
throughout the entire state.
So we appreciated their,
their perspective on
that. And finally,
in the end, what they
did was
grant us a case
management rule. It
does impose time
frames on
the sort of
simplest types of
cases and
moderately complicated
types of cases
and listening to state
holders uh
outside of the court,
they listened to them and decided
that it was not wise
to put a time limit on the most
complicated type of
cases that
have multiple, you
know, extra complications
with witnesses, lab
work, that sort of
thing. So that is
what they
granted us, we
appreciate their, their
thoughtfulness and that of
the stakeholders.
Uh And then the, the
last piece
I just uh I
want to make sure everyone understands
too. There's a lot of
and rightfully so
focus on
the burden that
shifting to a case
management rule has on
stakeholders, most
notably law enforcement
uh and the district
attorney and public defender,
but just know as well.
It's hard on the court as
well to do this. This
isn't some easy lift for
us. And I just want to
recognize my colleagues
for stepping up
and all of us are gonna be
taking on extra trial work
in cases to make this
work. And
uh I, I really respect and
appreciate my colleagues for that.
So I think that's probably
my time, but I'm happy to answer any
questions you
have.
Thank you, Judge and I hope you can stick
around with us. There may be questions directed
to you. Again, Judge Beehive is
in the first district.
Um Again, for those
who don't practising the
law states
divided into 13 districts,
judicial districts, Santa Fe
is the first. We're right now
down here in the third, many of the people here
are from the third. Berley
is the second we'll hear.
Uh Also from, uh
let's see, we've got as a judge
level in the
second. Are you
online?
There we go. Judge
Loveless. So we'll hear from you next
year in the second. This is Buro
County.
Well, hold on one sec.
I haven't used Zoom in a long
time since um
since COVID. So apparently
my camera's upside down.
So just one
second
that probably would have been the best view you
had of me all day long if I had left
it that way.
Uh  Mr.
Chairman and, and
members of the committee, thank you
for the opportunity to be
here. I don't want
to
um
uh
cover much of the ground which
judge Beachside judge
Beachside covered just
for by way of introductions.
I'm Brett Loveless. I'm the
presiding criminal judge
in Bernalillo
County. Uh and
we have had a
case management order in
place for
10 years now.
And what I would say, sort
of stepping
back for a moment
is that as
long as I've been in the criminal
justice system in New
Mexico, which
is about 30 years now,
with the exception of a very short
period of time, a couple of
years, about 10 years
ago, there's always
been a case management
order. There's always been
some mechanism
uh by which we've
had the ability
to regulate and keep
cases efficiently moving
through the system at times more
efficient than others.
But there's always been
something how
before that was the six
month rule, which
is uh
many of you may be familiar
with. Um
But at some point about
1012 years ago, uh
the six month rule
was no longer
uh something that we
used the Supreme
Court, um
got rid of it.
But the problem
that progressed
from there is that our caseloads
in Bernalillo County, which is
an extremely busy district
um was
off the charts.
I, when I first took the
bench in the criminal division
in 2012,
I was averaging between
1415
to 1600 cases a
year, uh which
is just mammoth and
there's no way, no way really
to manage that large of a
caseload. Uh
Now my
active caseload is
in the realm of anywhere from
275 to
325. Just
depending on the circumstances.
It's been a little difficult with COVID
because it's uh created
sort of an artificial
uh glut that,
uh went through the system.
But for the most part,
around 300 cases pending
at a time, that doesn't
necessarily mean that there are more
cases that are
being filed now versus
then or vice versa.
It's just that if you take
it in a shot a snapshot in
time,
10 years ago, I had 1600
cases. Now, I have
300 it's much
more manageable. Now,
uh we,
when we implemented the
case management order based
on Supreme Court order,
we had a lot of growing
pains, we had to
do a lot of things within our
bench. We have, we, I think
at the time, we had 10 judges,
we actually had to divide
our bench into two
systems. One of which
was to resolve old cases
and the other half was
to continue forward
with new cases with
the new system in place. It puts,
puts into place
some fairly rigorous
timelines,
seven months for
simple cases, uh
nine or 10
months for or nine
months for or 10
months for um
moderate complexity
cases and then 15
months for more complex
cases. Uh And
so, and there's the ability to
grant extensions and things of
that nature. But over the
last 10 years, we've
essentially ironed out
a number of uh
wrinkles that have come
to be. Uh
And I think that
what we have now is an
extremely
effective and
efficient
system that not
only enables
a trial judge to be
able to track
and keep
control of a case
and a caseload in particular.
But also, um,
to,
uh, give some
degree of
finality, whether it be
to victims families,
whether it be to those who
are accused, those who
are on pretrial release,
those who are in jail.
Um, we've had the ability
to move cases
rapidly through the system
to whatever destination
but it gives everyone finality
and I think that that's
certainly,
and
a desired goal for anyone,
no matter whether it be the legislature
or the judiciary, uh, just
a member of the community.
And so I don't want to take
up too much of your time and
get into the weeds about how
exactly we do things,
but I am certainly open to questions
if you folks have
any.
Thank you, Jud. And I, I'm gonna
reemphasize the fact that the
second where you're at, Brno,
Gy has had the case management
order in place the longest period
of time. A couple of
things too, just
decide before we go through the rest of the
panel.
Uh, we all know
that the constitution guarantees the right
to a speedy trial.
We have to start with that, uh,
that constitutional
right. Uh,
judge, uh,
loveless
referred to the sixmonth
rule. I'm gonna, I, I
don't do criminal law. Never have
really done much criminal law. So I'm,
I'm, I don't want to get
outside my lane, but the old sixmonth
rule used to essentially be here to bring
a case to trial in six months.
And the consequence of not bringing a
case to trial in six months could mean
dismissal of the
case.
And um I'm gonna
emphasize to judge of this went from,
he said 1416 100
cases to 275
325. You can see how getting
a case to trial in six months with that
kind of workload means a lot of cases
get dismissed. Um,
the other thing that I hope that
you all will refer to, I've
passed it out before, but I'll get you
this through staff if you don't
have it easy. Which is LFC
did a really good study about
two years ago on crime
in Burn Leo County and
statewide and
it's full of data. And, and of course,
one of the things that's in the data
that was telling to me
was
that, um, the
effectiveness of the criminal justice
system depends if there's a
33 points that
are usually relied upon, one of them is
increase the sentences. That's
what we're all hearing all the
time. That's what we get, increase the
sentences. The, the other
two components that never get discussed
are the
swiftness of
the punishment and any of us that have raised
kids or
animals or anything know that if you
wait a few weeks or
months to punish somebody for
their behaviour, it's
not quite the same as
grounding them in the moment,
right? So the, the
swiftness of the punishment
at tied to the misconduct
is critical and that's where the speedy
trial, that's where this case management
order comes in from my
perspective. And then, and then the
third component, we won't be addressing
really so much today is the certainty
of getting caught, right? But
that sort of matters because
if you talk about the third component being
the certainty of getting caught, if you're certain of
getting caught and charged, your case gets
dismissed repeatedly. And that's why I
began a few minutes ago
by picking on one particular
individual whose case was repeatedly
being dismissed. If, if you're
getting arrested all the time and
being dismissed all the
time, then the certainty
of you ever suffering any
consequences is pretty remote
too. And then we've got law
enforcement officers in the back who get burned
out, get tired. Right. Tired of
arresting the same people over and over again.
So, that's, that's how we're
into the topic here. So we've gone through
the, the first and the second.
Let's go to the third. We've got a couple
of judges, uh,
Judge and Judge Hawkins,
you all can do
it the way you want to do it.
Mr.  Chairman, members of the committee.
Good afternoon. Thank you for this opportunity
to speak with you. My name
is Richard Aus. I'm the chief
judge for the third judicial district
court with me is Judge
Conrad Pera. We both
do criminal dockets in the third
judicial district court.
I'll be brief. I think Judge
Beche and Judge Lovelace
did an excellent job of
explaining what a
case management rule is.
We've had it effective since June
1420 23
in the third judicial district.
We didn't go through the full two
year rule policy
that I'm aware that
judge be, I was able to do.
But we did have
planning and meetings
prior to going and
taking this rule into effect and
justice uh,
Beil led those
meetings and brought in all the
stakeholders,
uh, like
was previously explained.
Judge Loveless set the, the
track assignments. We have a track
one, track two, track three
assignment based on the
complexity of the case.
He talked about trial deadlines
210 days for
track 1, 300 days for track
two and
455 days
for track three. And that's from the day of the
arraignment. The arraignment and district
court. What
is also part of
the case
management rule are deadlines.
Deadlines that set
forth are in
the rule include a deadline
to amend a criminal complaint.
The deadline for scientific
evidence to be disclosed, the
deadline for pretrial interviews
to be done and
then for the attorney's deadlines
to file motions,
pretrial have motion
hearings and
then as we prepare to get
ready for trial deadlines to make
sure court interpreters are
requested ahead of time and
uh plea deadlines
and trial materials.
And basically what this is, this
is a scheduling order, a
scheduling order that
allows
us to make sure time to
disposition, which is what
I believe Judge Beachside
was referring to making
sure that from the time that arraignment
happens to the time we go to
trial that time
frame is kept within those
deadlines. I think it's
working well in our third judicial
district court and
I will defer to judge Peria for
any further comment
and and welcome. My name is Conrad
Perea and welcome to the third judicial
district. Um
One of the things that I just want to
add, I think, uh, all of the
judges have summed this up
perfectly. But one of the things
that was a catalyst here in Donan
County was that,
um, there was a county
manager who truly,
I, I say that with all due
respect as he's seated next to
me, uh, but
who truly monitored
the amount of time that an
individual was in custody.
So he monitored how long
it was taking the courts
to bring the case forward.
And we were reviewing those
detentions um
populations each
day and finding out
some of these cases need to
go to trial. So that was
one of the catalysts to,
to satisfy the
requirement of the constitution
of the right to a speedy
trial. So we would look at
these cases and say, let's
bring them forth. And
with that,
we
somewhat sought
the case management order. We
didn't apply through the rulemaking
process. It was
sprung upon us
at, at a, at our request.
And just as vhe from the
Supreme Court said,
this is what we're going to do.
It's working in the second,
it's a pilot program in the eighth
judicial district. The third
is going to be next. And
so it was a larger, we're growing
from the largest down
to one of the smallest to
now one of the larger judicial
district, which is us.
And this is where it began to
work. We started to
address with this order
that's now 25 months
old and starting to put
these cases to task
that has brought about some
growing pains. But
fortunately, Judge Loveless was
able to solve a lot of the
issues by way
of Court of appeals,
um addressing certain
issues. And now we're
the recipients of those gifts
saying this is how it
works better.
So once we get it to work better,
we're flowing so
much easier to be able
to get this done. I personally
think that in the third judicial district
and it would work elsewhere, it
is working well. It
puts a severe
responsibility upon our
district attorney's office,
our law office of the Public
Defender and it
puts a great
responsibility upon our law
enforcement officers, but
they are getting it done
and we get it done and our
trials have grown.
We have jury trials,
we have pleas, we have
dispositions, we have
adjudications. So our
numbers are good. They're
effective and they're high.
Uh, we're getting an
increase in cases
now and
when judge chief Judge
Hawks and, and Judge Driggers and
I sit down, we
will address that increase in, in
cases and just
tackle them as they come up.
But we will satisfy
the true reason
for this order and
bring justice swiftly
as it should be for
all parties
involved.
Good. We'll talk more
about the fact. Conrad and I grew
up in a place called La Mesa
down south here, about 20
about 20 miles south town used
to play Little League baseball. Right.
I have to, I was point that out.
So nobody would ever believe I
have any athletic skills at
all. You've seen me on the
basketball team and it's pretty
bad.
Um, I think it's also important
to take the moment to you referred
to and we'll hear from
the district attorney now, former county
manager, Mass when he was county
manager, uh,
monitoring this. One
of the things to remind the committee is
we had the Slevin case down
here. We had <AAA>
different district attorney years ago.
She went on to bigger and better
things, uh A
as governor.
But um, during
the time she was district attorney, we had
a gentleman by the name of Slevin who
was 22 months in solitary
confinement on AD W I
charge. Uh and he
got lost in the system. Uh
The jury awarded him
$22 million
which the city of Las Cruces
had to go into most of its very
long term financial reserves.
And the county probably did too. We
to go too much into that. But
the, the point being if
you leave people
and forget about people, a jury might
decide that's a really terrible
thing. And having this individual for 22
months in solitary led to
a very large verdict out here.
So that's the reference and I
appreciate the fact that
as manager, uh  Mr.
Macis was watching that carefully and I
think that's a lesson to all
managers and all elected
officials around the state. So,
all right, that's um,
our judges. So we got a
justice Thompson. Is
he, was he able to finally join
us?
Yeah.
Ok. Thank
you.
So we can get him and we
through our panel of
judges.
Ok.
Normally this is why I'd say we're gonna move
on and you know, but this is
the chief justice of the Supreme
Court. Uh
Yeah, you all give me a little
grace here for a moment since
I sometimes have to end up in
front of the chief
and others. So, what's
that?
00, you won't be
list.
I know you're hiding behind that
pole,
but you're hiding from me. It's like
I'm
invisible.
They're,
is he with us now?
Oh, there you are.
Hello, Chief we see on the
screen. Can you hear me?
I can hear you. Can you hear me
chairman? Barely.
We're gonna have to ask you to
try and
adjust your audio if you can or
speak as loudly as you possibly
can. We're having a lot of a V
problems today down here.
So, um, can you
try again?
I can, can you hear me
chairman? There
you go. That's it. Thank you, Chief.
Go ahead. Well,
thank you and I apologize for
running in. Uh I know
you all were
running through your docket.
Um I appreciate the
opportunity as always
to uh
present to the
committee. I'm just gonna sort
of give an opening statement
on
case management role and
then turn it over to the experts.
I know you have
a Brent
loveless here out of the second
judicial judge Bide,
Chief Judge Behe out of the
first.
And I hope in the room, you
have our colleagues from the third
judicial.
Let me focus my opening
statement on
what a case management
rule, uh
what they generally
do
um and then
how they are uh
implemented
and um,
briefly, uh why
they are done
and, uh,
we've provided the
experts. These are the folks
on the ground, these judges
that deal with case management
rule on a daily basis
and can, can provide you
specific
details.
Case management
rule. Uh,
the court takes
jurisdiction
at some form of
indictment. Ok.
That's when the judiciary
gets involved.
The legislature writes
the law.
The executive says you
broke the law and I'm going
to arrest you and the judiciary
has the process by which
someone adjudicates that
question,
did they break the law or did they
not?
The role of the judiciary
is,
begins
you enter the courthouse
doors at
indictment.
Um, and a case
management rule
sets forth
a detailed and
organized way
to go from that
accusation
sometimes by grand
jury
to adjudication,
usually by a jury,
sometimes by a
judge.
And it is not
unusual
in the civil world, we have
scheduling orders
in the criminal world, we have
scheduling orders.
The case management role
is
just a more
unified and
uniform way
to do
it.
Um How
are they
implemented?
The process is
we talk to the local
jurisdiction and in every
case we follow this,
Judge Lovelace is from the
second he has
served with a
case management rule at
the longest
time
and the third is
one of our more recent
and we have it also
up um in the
eight and House
Chief Judge Behe will
provide you information
on what it is to
recently implement
a case management
rule.
And here is, I hope
what you're gonna learn and the
questions I want you to
ask,
how many felony
cases do you
have on a weekly
basis?
And how, how
given that volume?
And we just heard that I heard the
presentation from your staff,
given that volume. How do
you proceed with
that defendant through the court
system on an organized
basis? And the case
management rule
is what
um does
that we meet with
the local jurisdiction?
For example,
um In Las
Cruces, we met with
the, then the district
attorney, the district
public defender,
the judges in the district.
And we, we design a
rule that benefits
that district and
how that district
operates.
Um
So that is how they are
done and
uh who
is included in the
conversation,
why they are
done
again. Case
management
rules
are
not. And what you're hearing
from these judges are not
unique.
What I am holding in this
binder
is the disposition
rate
for our Court of appeals
for our Supreme Court and
for our district courts.
So as the legislature
and the Department of Finance
Administration
says these are the
performance measures I want from
the court. I
want time to disposition.
I want to know how long cases are
proceeding in your courts.
I want to know about delay
and that's fair enough and we'll answer
those questions.
But if those demands are put on
us by the legislature
and by the Department of Finance and
Administration, we
need the ability to
operate
and need these performance
measures which I go
through
at um every
quarterly New Mexico
Judicial
Council
for each district.
And for us to be able
to do this, we need to
be allowed
the flexibility
to create um
these rules in these
orders.
Who else has a case
management
role?
This guy,
we just implemented a
term system in the Supreme
Court from
the time and cases
heard
it is out within six
months and at the very
latest, it is out by July.
This term starts in September
and it's over in
July.
Was I happy about that
term system?
I may have done it
differently.
Did I complain about it? I
didn't, we just got
to work
and that is what is required
if you want these deadlines
to be met,
everybody's gotta push
in the same direction
and that's what these case
management rules
do. So
that's my uh my
opening statement on that chair.
I will turn it over
to the experts you have
uh on the
call and those in the room
or I'll stand for any questions.
If not, I will ask to be
excused
justice. Thanks again, I know you're
bouncing between different things. So if you
can stay with us, there may be
questions for you coming up.
Um If you can't stay
with us, you've got good people here in the
room who are gonna be, I'm sure
giving a good report on
any questions that we have for you. So
thank you for being here,  Mr.
Bauer from the public
defender's perspective. We've, we've
heard about 25 minutes
from the judiciary. I'd like to hear
public defenders and I tell you about
25 minutes, you said it's gonna
be shorter than that for you. And
um, I'm not, I'm
Mr.  Macias. I'm sure we'll fill the
time. I'll take your
time. Thank
you,  Mr.  Chair, uh,
members of the committee. My name is Bennett
Bauer. I'm the chief public defender
of the State of New Mexico. Uh
Just a background
for me
as I'm discussing case management
orders.
I started my career as a trial
attorney in the public defender's office
in Albuquerque. In
1993. I
prosecuted misdemeanor cases. I
prosecuted felony cases. I went to
Santa Fe, spent
five years at the District Attorney's
office doing juvenile cases
and then serious felony
cases before going into private
practice uh and
coming back into the department,
uh as the chief public
defender, I oversee indigent
defence in all 33
counties uh
in the state of New Mexico, all
14 judicial districts.
Uh I am
familiar
with case management
orders as they have
been rolled
out and sometimes rolled
back in some districts.
Uh I, I think Judge
Lovelace gave a good summary
of uh the second.
I, I don't remember the first time
that rolled out. Uh
but it, it was tough
and let me say this
about case management orders
and maybe about lawyers. And this
may surprise. Some of you
lawyers are human
beings,
human beings sometimes
procrastinate
and case
management orders are sort of
designed to make the
system run
effectively and efficiently to
put pressure
on lawyers, on
prosecutors, on defence
attorneys, on the judges
themselves to
make decisions.
And I can tell you in criminal
cases, the
sooner we all
make critical decisions
about a case about how it,
what the evidence looks like,
how it's supposed to be
handled the
better for the whole system.
Case management orders
do not create a greater
number of cases. And judge loves
went over this. You
could, there's a couple different basic
metrics, for instance, how
many cases is a
judge or a public defender ad
a signed over the course of a
year and how many do you
have pending at any
particular time?
Case management orders
by speeding up the process
of cases and the schedule
in which they're handled
means that once
you make the adjustment,
you have fewer cases
pending at any particular
time. And this is
good for district attorneys
and public defenders because
I've talked about lawyers as
people. Now, let's talk about everybody
else's people, uh,
police officers,
uh victims of crime,
uh, alleged victims of
crime. And to
me, most importantly,
our clients who
if they are out of custody
are waiting when there's not
a case management order and
not a way
to really enforce
timelines can be
waiting if they're out of
custody, but still under
conditions of release where
maybe they can't travel outside of the
county, maybe they're not supposed to walk
into even a bar or
a place that sells alcohol,
all of these things.
Um for six
months, eight months,
16 months
until their case is resolved.
And often when you
have a huge number of
pending cases for anybody, there's
very little work being done on
any particular case.
So I am a
proponent of
case management
orders.
The hardest thing about case
management orders is
adopting them and
adjusting to them. The
transition is
rough in
many places. It is
hard. And
uh I I think we heard
that again from the second
making that
transition going
from a time when people
have a lot of time
to work cases to
a strict timeline
that transition of several
months and we went through it in
Albuquerque and then we
had to pull back during COVID and
then we had a mini
transition back into a
case management order. That was
hard for my office, that
was hard for the DAS office. And I'm
sure we heard
about more judges being
assigned to hear those trials.
And so the
transition
can be difficult
once you get there,
I can't believe anybody wants to go
back because
you are now moving
things more quickly.
It I'm not
sure how it can take
more time per
case. You're just doing
it more quickly
and that can raise problems for
instance, communication about
discovery, uh witness
interviews, things like that. But
the other side of that is
when you let cases
go for a year,
18 months, two
years, uh witnesses
disappear, witnesses die,
witnesses move on police
officers change agencies
or move out of state.
Uh The public
defender might change two or three
times because we have
turnover in our offices.
All of these things are a
consequence
of letting cases
fester in the
system. And so a
schedule with accountability
and consequences
I think is critical
and to remind you
these consequences are not just
case dismissal. There's other
things that judges have in their
toolbox and
it's not just for the state, it's
also for the defence. So the defence
has to meet certain timelines
as well. Filing
motions, uh doing
their witness interviews asking
for things, uh talking
to their clients, there's things and
we have had fines levied
against public offenders.
We generally uh
dispute those but
there, but there are
consequences for us
and for our clients when these things
are not met. So
just I, I
want to really emphasize that
as someone who represents people,
I talk about our clients who are out of custody,
those who are in custody, who are
in county jails as
Mr.  Messias had to manage
for quite a while.
And in every one of the 33
counties, uh
if there is somebody charged with the
crime and that case is going
to be dismissed at some point
because there's a witness who doesn't want
to testify or because
actually they are
factually innocent.
We want to know that as soon as possible,
it's better for them, it's
better for the system.
Uh and it's better for
that person.
So mister chair,
I'll be around for,
as I said, rebuttal if I
can,
if that opportunity is
given, I
have no doubt you're gonna get some
questions from the committee members.
We got folks lining up including
our very own prosecutor.
So uh we'll go less
with the district attorney's perspective.
I think management is  Mr.
Macis.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman and thank
you to the members of the committee.
I may have a little bit of a different
perspective that I want
to share with you. And
when um
Senator Cervantes had
asked me if I would be willing to
speak. I thought
that the perhaps that
the agenda would be
a little bit broader
in terms of other
challenges that I think that you
have to hear about.
So I'm gonna be very brief with
those, but I will talk about
the case management
order I have
and I want you to know
upfront. I am not
here to criticize
anyone. The
challenge that every
position at this
table and all
of the people that it represents
is daunting.
So there is no
criticism in any
of my remarks.
I'm going
to,
I have passed out
the handout and
let me take you through a little
bit of information,
right? On the first page.
I do want to take a little bit
of just a moment.
This is our new logo
for the third judicial
district and I want you
to note that it's
one of the few logos I've ever
seen that is bilingual.
Uh It has Truth
Laber uh
Justice
Justicia. Uh it shows a
more aggressive
because that's a mentality
within the office. A more
aggressive lady
justice uh along
with the eagle that the
people are familiar
with. One of
the challenges
isn't so much
the orders
as it is. Do
you have the people,
the staff to
carry out the
responsibilities that are
given to you under the
law and
in so many
of the districts
they don't.
So this December
and again, um
my base
of knowledge may not be as
long in this position
because I've only been here for seven
months. But in
December, this last
December, there
were only seven
prosecutors for
all of the third
judicial
district.
So how would anyone
expect for
cases to be
advanced at
an appropriate
level?
You compare just for a moment
to, to interrupt you, Fernando,
you said the number of seven when
you took the
office
in December of
24 and just for, for a point
of reference, uh the
third district Donetta County
compares, I guess next
closest to
Santa Fe. Santa Fe
the third, right?
And, and how many attorneys
do they have for prosecuting
compared to that seven? If
I'm not mistaken, about
3031
we have
21
your not,
you know, we just,
ok, so
this is where we are. So I'm just
reference the third you think has
around what 20 high twenties
they're on the screen and they're on your
presentation,
just turn to the second page.
This is where we are
today
and we have filled all but one
slot and by
the beginning of September,
we will have filled all
of the other positions within
the office. I'm talking
investigators, staff,
victim advocates,
everyone. So we'll be lacking
one more senior
attorney that we're looking
for that can bring in uh
an additional level of
experience, this
change alone.
And I know that for those of you
that are Bernal from Bernalillo
County, this is still very
a tiny number of
attorneys that are engaged,
but basically that we
only have 22
funded positions.
So
this in itself
will make a tremendous
difference.
The case
management order
was put into place
in July of
2023.
So it was in place
for a year and a
half
more, more than that
uh when I came into
office. But
yet, what did I
find? But
1600
cases
pending
grand jury
pending going
forward. So
my question is if
the case management
order was meant
to move cases
faster, there
certainly wasn't
this as a good
example that it was
actually happening.
So I want you to be
cognizant when people
say, well, we only
have, you know, we have
a better
caseload.
Well, you have a better caseload
because the cases are
pending. The
cases are
elsewhere. If you're
not looking at the totality
of all of the cases in the
system and these
1600 cases,
they went all the way
back to
2020
pending
waiting,
not just the defendants,
the victims.
Ok. So since
then, our
number
is
938 that are
pending.
Is this
optimal? Of course
not, we
are utilizing
both the
grand jury
process as
well as for the first time,
probably in a decade,
the the
preliminary hearing
process at the magistrate
court level. So that
we are handling
newer cases in one
forum, a little bit older
cases in the, in the
in the other
forum
we handle
again, minuscule
probably by Albuquerque
standards but basically
a little bit over 5000
cases a year come
in. This is both
felony and
magistrate.
This again, II I
need to tell you that
our statistical
bases are not
always
uh accurate. You have to
really look at it very
closely but
cases dismissed
due to this
order.
This case management
order from
inception is
about 700
cases based on my
calculation.
OK. So
under this order,
cases get
dismissed
more frequently than
what they should.
So when someone, one
person says
we have a lower caseload,
let me tell you that the
other person will say, but
we have a higher caseload
depending on what your
perspective is. So
would I call for
a review
of the case order here
in, in the third judicial
district? Absolutely
to kind of rethink what
it is that we're trying to
accomplish because
these next couple of
slides are a
scandal.
So here
I'm starting out and again,
I know that the case management
order only applies
to felonies. It doesn't
apply to probation revocations.
It doesn't apply to
misdemeanors, but this
should be of
great concern,
especially because of the
composition of this
committee.
In 2024
there were
831
Domestic Violence
cases
filed
only 29
out of
831
were
completed.
And I, and I'm not saying that they
were successfully prosecuted.
They were just
completed.
We had 389
cases that were
dismissed because
of law
enforcement.
Either failure
to appear at the
hearing, failure to
appear at, at a
pretrial. We
had 310
cases that were
dismissed because of the
lack of cooperation
from the
victim.
So, is there a legislative
issue? I think it was
Representative Romero that
said, what can we
as a legislature do?
We'll try to put together
some pilot projects that
will under
underwrite
the cost
of transitioning
that victim.
And in
95% of
the cases, it's a
woman
transition,
give them a
financial
ability to
transition
so that they are not feeling
the pressure of basically
saying it's ok
for me to have gotten
beaten
up
and help us
keep the
the pace, the
pace of being
able to handle these ques
these issues earlier.
What is my issue?
One of my issues with the
um case management
order in some
areas, it doesn't
move fast
enough. And this
is the primary
example, if we
don't have a system
that basically addresses
these domestic
violence issues
within a 60 day,
maybe 70 day
period, we are
going to have lost
the majority of them.
The next page
shows you the
felonies.
So in 2024
100 and 73
felony cases
were and normally
they translate into aggravated
battery and, or aggravated
assault. Well, basically
100 and
10
went by the wayside
because of the
lack
of,
I don't want to say commitment, the
lack of availability
of either law enforcement or
witnesses to participate
of those 173
20 cases
were successfully
adjudicated
20. And
these are the felony
cases.
These are the ones that are
subject to the case management
order. And
I can tell you that some of those
cases got
dismissed because
of the lack of
either law enforcement
going to their
pretrial interviews,
their lack of
availability, the
witnesses were no
longer available.
So
my concern
and let me go to the next
slide before I talk about the
case management itself.
These are DW I
cases,
641
cases were filed
205 of them
were basically
dismissed in one
fashion or another.
Uh because of the lack
of cooperation
from either again, law
enforcement primarily.
And then the 230
excuse me, law enforcement
and victim. Basically,
out of the 641
cases, only
235 were
complete, completely
completed. And I know
that this is gonna sound a little bit
snide to you and I don't mean
it to be, but in
Albuquerque, there's a, there was a
scandal about paying
law enforcement officers
and not to show up.
If you go to any other part
of the state,
you can run the risk that
you can roll the dice.
They're probably a lot
of the witnesses,
they're just not going to show to begin
with and you don't have to
invest anything.
So we have to rethink
completely
how we are
approaching the
management of these
cases. That's
why the caseload
is a little bit lighter.
Let me go to the challenges
that I see part
of my issue
and I think that some of you
are aware, I was a
district court judge for 11
years.
I don't remember ever
taking this kind of
approach
in terms of moving
cases. And I can
tell you that in 11 years
on the bench, I was
able to close
10,600
basically uh
felony and
juvenile related
cases
because we worked
with people to get
these issues
addressed.
This
case management
order is
strict.
It has very little
flexibility.
You have to be able to
show
extraordinary
circumstances
to deviate from
the numbers
and that's a
exceedingly
high bar
to achieve.
So if you don't meet
those initial
thresholds,
then you're having your
case dismissed.
You didn't Derain them
on time,
you were a day
late
and the case gets
dismissed.
So yes, it may
the first time around get
dismissed without
prejudice, but
it means you have to go
through the whole system,
the whole process.
Again, you have to
give notice to the
defendant and the attorney
you have to give,
um uh, let
me go. Well, I'll get
there in a minute, you have to
go through the whole process, you have
to take them back to grand jury.
You have to bring back the law
enforcement officer. You
have to get the testimony. You
have to do a new
indictment
or potentially a new
information. It, if it came
through the, the preliminary
hearing process,
the next point is that it
is captioned.
If you look at it, it is
captioned as a pilot
project. Well,
it's time even though
it's been implemented for a
longer period of time in the
other areas
and it's only been here
for a little bit over two
years. We have to
go back and rethink
things. So the
next page that I'll take you
to, it has arraignments at the
top. An individual
has to be arraigned within 15
days. That's what the court or that's
what the case management
order, if they are out
of custody, if they're
in custody, it's seven
days. So you
have this all this
mechanism related
to all of these
cases. And I can
tell you that I handle the
arraignments in order
to prioritize the
cases. You be basically
on the average
handle a, a
little bit under
40 cases. But
this case management order,
let me give you the example of
how strict it
can be. It
said that there would be no
more than 40
individuals
arraigned at
any arraignment session
and there's only one per
week.
And so I was spending
the first
month or two
of my term
because we would have
41
we would have 42
individuals. We would have
43 because
we would have to get those in
custody arraigned
quicker.
So it would add the number, it
would jump the number
and I had to be continuously
to be told by the
court.
Which one of these cases
are you gonna delay? What
are you gonna get rid of?
Because you can't go beyond
40. Well,
fortunately, the judges
kind of heard the
dilemma so that they
increased it to
50.
So, but
the, the strictness
of it is
alarming to me,
uh, witness
lists. It
takes a lot to
develop these witness
lists. You have to review all
the reports and it's
not even the district Attorney's
office that's doing it. It's law
enforcement.
You don't get on that list,
you find something different
later. It is an
extreme challenge
to get
someone on to that witness
list. If somebody was
left off, they basically
get excluded.
Ultimately, our goal is
justice.
It isn't, you know,
the technical
strictness related
to, um, related
to, to the rules.
Uh, there's a thing called
a conference status.
And let me suggest to
you that I had
one today at
130
but the motion a
motion to dismiss on
the same cases tomorrow at
130 as well.
So I'm going
that the outcome of that
motion to dismiss
dictates the status
conference dictates
whether we're still going
forward. At what point
we're still going forward.
What do we need it today
for if the decision
and impacting is
tomorrow? And I'm saying
that on the status
conferences, you, it's
a determination of the
track, but the case
management system
says
track one
is the preferred, which is a
shorter period of time is
the preferred track
already to begin with.
So maybe we had,
you know, the ability to say,
well, maybe we'll need track
two or track three, but that
doesn't happen very often.
Let me tell you this. Just
let me show you the example
very quickly of this
arrangement challenge
you can see at the top
or on Tuesdays or
grand juries on
Wednesdays are preliminary
hearings now.
Ok. So you have to
give the
defendant and
the um,
attorney, you
have to give them a
10 day
notice of when
the arraignment is going to
be. So the
arraignments on Monday,
so if you have to give them that
period of time, there's
no way you're gonna get the
case to the following,
to the following Monday.
So you're gonna have to have
your arraignment
basically two weeks
away. You have
15 days,
you don't do it on that day.
You do try to do it later.
You get the case dismissed.
You go and ask
judges and I'm not
again trying
to iiii
I know
that they're needing to address and abide
by the rules. Ok.
Help us out. Let's
do it a little bit earlier.
Does it happen?
No,
it doesn't. So if you don't
make that time frame, your case
is dismissed, you have to
start all over again. That's
a prime example.
Uh Pretrial interviews. I'm
going to the next page
again. You don't,
you can't get your officer, you
can't get your witnesses there.
They're gonna, they're, they're
going to, and again,
this is something that, that our
office is not doing
properly. Uh Again,
discovery,
I know that the district
attorney is the chief
law enforcement officer
in name in principle,
but we are completely and totally
reliant on law enforcement to
come forward.
So I, I am
working with all of the
area law enforcement
chiefs to basically
hold people
accountable. Uh
law enforcement officers
accountable if we're not getting
the discovery. This
next is the last page
gonna hit it very quickly.
I want you to please consider
hazard pay for
prosecutors.
I park my
vehicle in
front of the bedroom
windows.
There are so many
drive-by shooting
cases.
Our prosecutors are in the
courtroom. They're
having to deal with some of the
worst offenders
in the community. So please
consider that retention
recruitment. You have provided
funds for that it
has given. Certainly
me and I'm sure every other
prosecutor the
ability to
lock in prosecutors
for at least another year
because of the retention money
that was provided to them. I
cannot tell you how
destructive it is
to the process
when you have turnover
and turnover of
prosecutors and new
prosecutors having to take
over cases that are in the
middle of the process,
expanding the attorney
pool for prosecutors.
We don't have
enough attorneys
in the state of New Mexico
to basically populate
properly all
of our districts
across the state.
I have a brilliant,
brilliant young man
who is now acting
as a law clerk,
although he's
licensed to,
to practice in
Texas and another
state, his bar
exam scores
were so
high that he
would more than get
um licensed
in New Mexico except he
has a nontraditional
license. So
that's not uh
right now an
ability to get him
licensed fully,
excuse me in New
Mexico. So we
really need to be
working to expand the
pools. There is an
underutilization
of treatment
courts
that is funded by the
legislature.
But I believe that there
is this issue on a
statewide basis.
Again, we need to
be getting individuals
into these treatment
courts.
I know that you may not
have a lot to do with
it, but don't
sanction
prosecutors and
public defenders
financially,
our budgets are
tight enough as it
is the
money is coming from one
state institution to
what go to
another
is that the way to
resolve it rather
than bringing people in and
finding out why
you didn't comply
and how quickly
can you
comply?
The last is
again, you're
may be self-serving,
but there is a pay
in equity
between district attorneys and
district judges.
It's
$57,000
having served in both
positions, I can
suggest to you that
is not warranted
and there should be a closing of the
gap and certainly
you all can address
that. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman,
forgive me forgiving.
Going
longer.
Ok.
Yes.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair
and, uh, judges
and, uh, district
attorney, uh, Macias,
um, since
I retired and I'm contract
prosecuting across the state,
I've gotten to see all
these different ways that courts
are handling things. And,
um,
ironically, I mean, we've
heard from the three
largest districts.
Um, and I'm not saying
CMO S aren't the answer
to some of the issues
in these larger districts.
Um, but for
a district, like, let's
say Clovis or
Palli or, um,
any of these places I go that
tend to often be
smaller. It
seems to work just
fine with scheduling orders.
We don't have backed up cases,
cases are getting tried,
um, cases aren't getting
dismissed. We have a
witness, you know, we follow
the, the scheduling orders
that we get, but there's flexibility
in them if some witness pops up
at least 10 days before trial, like
under the rule, we can
disclose them and, and get
our interviews done. And so
I'm concerned and I don't
know if the, uh, justice
is still on there. Is this a
system
that is going
to be tried
to be implemented in every
single district or
is this, um,
a system that is going
to get feedback from the
judges of that district
and whether things are,
are going properly? Because yeah,
I can see why Ben Bauer
would love this, this
system because yes,
you're what you say
is great and I
understand for your clients, but
it's not so great for the victims
and it's not so great for
the process execution because I think
what we, we forget
is prosecutors
as was stated, they're, they're
not fully staffed.
Um You
in Clovis, we have
three prosecutors that
don't even live in Clovis.
They appear from
Florida and they
appear from other
jurisdictions and call in
and do telephonic hearings
because they cannot staff the
office and there may be
four or five of them yet.
You forget, das also have to
do all the pre-vet.
There's a homicide. You got a
prosecutor out there. You
might have a two month investigation
into a big embezzlement case that
the prosecutors doing
yet then to get on
these types of orders,
it's almost undoable
in the smaller offices.
So I guess
uh those are concerns I
have and I always wanna
know we're, we're
trying to move this route
to every single district and
make it uniform or
is it gonna be district by
district and how things
are working in that district?
So, I don't know if that's more of a question
for, for Justice
Thompson or,
or what the plan
is,
the question to somebody specifically?
Yeah. Is Justice Thompson still
on the
phone?
I don't know if he
was,
no, I don't see him. Ok.
So, well, maybe I don't know if any
of the  Mr.  Chair, any of the
judges know, um
kind of what the ultimate
plan is,
is this just district
by district if you want to be
involved. If we think there's an
issue,
Mr.  Chairman Representative
re I don't
know, I think
each district is different.
So if there is a plan to
bring a case management rule to a
district, I think it will go through the same
process that we've done in the
first with the two year
rule making
policy to get input
from everybody and, and
get stakeholders an opportunity
to speak on the subject.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair and
Judge. I think that I
really hope that's the
situation because
um, I've just been
to so many districts where
this is not an issue, cases
are getting tried frequently. I'm,
I'm doing a murder case
um in Farmington that just
has scheduling orders and
I'm doing that in 11
months with all the last back
and everything and things
are rolling and we're ready to
go. So, it just,
I think it really just depends
on your judges and how
on top of things they are.
Um, I know it moves
faster for the judges and I
respect that and you could clear
your dockets and, and
do that. But it, I
worry that
it's bad for
victims. It,
cops don't get that
discovery there as quick as
possible and that there's just
such a,
if you don't do it, it's
dismissed. Whereas scheduling
orders accomplish the same thing.
In my opinion, they tell
you when they want things done
and there's a little flexibility
to where your case is just not
in not getting dismissed.
And ultimately, that doesn't
help the communities
um when you're having to go
back and redo things.
Um So that
was my, my main
concern mister Chair was
where we were going with this. I, I
don't like scheduling
orders again. I don't
practice in Albuquerque.
Um some in Las Cruces,
I'm in Taos. And so it's the
first time dealing with the
scheduling orders. Um
Of course, I have a simple case
there, so it's not such a big
deal. Uh but I have
major concerns with
CMO S and
um, I remember sitting
on the committee with
when Justice Thompson was
uh trying to be on
the Supreme Court and I remember
asking him this very question. I
asked every one of them.
Do you believe CMO S
are appropriate for every
single district? And
his answer to me was
no, I think it depends
on the district. So I'm
holding him to that and I tell
him that when I see him,
Mr.  Chair, that I'm holding him
to that. And so,
um I'm hoping it's gonna
be district by district. Uh
but II, I have a
lot of problems with scheduling
orders. Um I can
see how they work in the larger
districts, but I just wanted
to make that comment and
I was hoping I would get an answer
on that, but I can get on with
him offline for sure.
So thank you,  Mr.
Cherry.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Thank
you, judges and justices
Mr.  Bauer.  Mr.  Maas
for your presentation
um on your uh
presentation,  Mr.  Mascius, when
you're talking about the lack of law
enforcement participation,
can you kinda just
go into that a little bit more for
us? Is this a uh
workforce issue? What
is, what is the reason
for law enforcement participation
issues?
Well, I think that most of the  Mr.
Chairman, I think that most of
the,
that there's just conflicts in
the schedule.
Um, I hear a lot
of it doesn't
make any difference,
um, that
nothing's gonna happen to these individuals.
I hear a lot of that, but I've always
taken that as just an
excuse.
So what I'm doing
is working with the
chief.
I've already done an assessment
internally in terms of where we're
having the greatest difficulty
which law enforcement officers
are not showing up
consistently
and so that we can have that
discussion
and
so that we can get to the point
where we will
have across the board,
much greater
participation.
So that's about as far as I can
tell you, uh, the,
the reasons
they're historical and I
don't think that they're confined
to Duna County.
I think if anybody really
looked at the statistics
statewide, you'd
see something
similar.
Thank you. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.
And you may not know the answer
to this. Question  Mr.  Macias, but
is law enforcement
participation in
trials mandatory as part
of their job? Of
course, they're,
but let me suggest to you
that the over the
last 3.5 months
we've had 13,
which I don't
believe is
um, a real high
number. So where
we're losing out
is in the pretrial
um interviews,
they're just not showing up
to there consistently
enough. And again,
I um
it, it's not
unique, I believe to
Donna County, but for
whatever reason, my
predecessor gave
up the
responsibility of
organizing those
pretrial
interviews. And
so they're actually set
up by
uh the public defender's
office. So I can tell
you just recently, I got a call
asking, hey, we're
undercover. We don't
want to go to the public defender's
office. So
I'm going to
soon, uh
basically indicate
that we're going, the district
attorney's office is going to
take back the full,
the full responsibility
of scheduling these
uh these interviews,
some of the new people. So
some of the new staff that we're
gonna be hiring, their
exclusive responsibility
is going to be to
ensure
ensure
that we elevate
the level of
participation, hopefully
both with law enforcement
and our um
victims as
well.
Thank you. And my last question,
uh also for you,  Mr.
Macias, um talking
about the case management order. I remember
when I was a baby attorney and I was
doing criminal law,
the CMO and, and the second
judicial came into effect.
And I remember the perception
then was that it was
a much heavier lift,
heavier burden for the District
Attorney's office because you have a
lot more to do, especially at the
beginning of the case.
And so with that in mind,
Mras, I mean, every
judicial district has
their own discretion to do a
CMO do you,
how do you convey
this uh feedback
on the current CMO to
the third judicial district? Are they
open? Because it sounds like some changes
need to be made. And that's
not anything necessarily we
can do on the legislative level. But,
but what is the process for you?
And is it possible to kind of give
that feedback to make things work a little
bit better for you? Right. Well,
let me take it in the order that you
gave it. Certainly, there are things
that the legislature can do
because you have the authority
through resolution or
through memorials to basically
ask for certain things to be
considered or looked
at more closely
by whatever
branch of government.
Certainly, the legislature
has that prerogative
to encourage
the study or the reassessment.
Um We,
uh, I have not sat
down with,
um, uh,
Chief Judge Hawks
or, uh, Judge
Perre to
say,
let's rethink
this because
I believe that they
understand what their
responsibilities are
under the case management
and they are
following the case
management, uh,
order they are
following it. Do I
agree that that's,
that, that's that it should
be because there is so
much intensiveness
in terms of getting things
ready up front.
But then you go
for months,
for months, if
not longer till you
actually get to a trial.
So how
can there not be the opportunity
to show some degree of
flexibility
if I if I'm
not able to within
15 days
um uh get
someone arraigned?
Really? What is the
difficulty in
terms of then just turning
around giving another
tenay notice and bringing
them in in a couple of
weeks? Why would
it lead to a dismissal
and starting all over again?
Those are more my
brill just practical
issues because
you're still gonna be
months, if
not a year or more
away from trial.
So why can't
there be flexibility?
What was so
bad? What was happening here
because I, I wasn't
aware of it when it first came
into play, but what was
so bad because if
it was meant to
cure some
evils within the
system doesn't
seem like it accomplished
it.
Thank you  Mr.
Chairman
and for everyone. So
I run the
committee a little differently than others do.
So I will recognize you for a
period of time. I'm leaving that time
to you entirely to you. So
if you're, if you're satisfied
with the answer, you want to let the witness keep on
explaining. Do so. If you want to interrupt
any more questions, I'm leaving it up to all
of you to do that Ok,
so it's your time to use as you see.
Fit Senator Trujillo.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair and
thank you for the presentation.
Um I too was hoping that I
could talk to the chief justice, but
I'll talk to them offline.
Um
District attorney,
um
Maus
Maus. Thank you.
You mentioned that.
Um And I'm looking
at the numbers here
for
the challenge of, oh,
here it is 310
dismissed due to lack of
cooperation by
victim witnesses.
And I recognize
that if there's, there's
more than just money
that needs to be provided,
victims are
afraid, right?
The system hasn't necessarily
worked fast enough.
Their, their perpetrator
is still in their
homes, still in their
communities. So there's
a lot of different things,
but I know we gave
a significant amount and I'm having troubles
pulling up House Bill two and
searching it out real quick
for domestic violence and we've
got a domestic violence program.
So, so what are we
missing? What, what, what
did because you mentioned we should do
some sort of a pilot project
to help make sure that that
victims have access
to resources so
that they don't
not co-operate. And I thought
that's what we were doing.
Uh  Mr.  Chairman,
certainly
you always have to be cautious about
the anti donation clause,
giving people money and
not getting anything in
return. But
my sense is that you could
be providing
grants to
these individuals that are the
victims really
have no independent
income of their own or
exceedingly limited.
And basically ask them
if they could provide
some a service
to any kind
of nonprofit
organization. As long
as you're getting something in
return, you're able
to give people
or help them
individually. And
so my, my
appeal actually,
my first appeal is
that let's rethink the
timeline when it comes to
domestic violence,
both at the mis at the
magistrate court
and at the
district court, you have
to shorten those time
frames. If you don't,
we will never, never
turn these statistics
around as far as I'm
concerned. But you can
help people
survive victims
survive
for like
a uh 60 to
100 and day, 100 and
20 day time
frame. So they're, they're
not under this pressure to
say, uh you know,
we won't
the today at
the at arraignments,
there's an individual that went
through grand jury that I handled
that case is basically
in there because he got a
gun, put it to
his uh
partners had
basically threatened
uh while there was a child
and, and is in there
and now uh
60
days later because this
happened, well,
45 days later because this
happened in July. Well,
the victim is there
kind of not wanting to
press the
situation, which
is uh not of any
consideration to us anymore.
If we think the situation is
grave enough, we're gonna
still try to find a way
to pursue the prosecution
but if that's,
it is, it's continuous
that and at
times with cases,
law enforcement officers not
showing up to the, to the
pretrial interviews, that's
the, that's the biggest
area, uh,
where matters
get, uh dismissed
or you lose certain
witnesses that compromise
the prosecution of the case
and you just can't go forward. So,
yeah, it gets, it gets
either dismissed by
the court for certain actions
or not, uh,
dismissed by the
prosecutor's
office.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
Um I will just point out that
our vice chair
has carried legislation
for a couple of terms
uh sessions that
includes um
paid family medical leave
for domestic violence
victims. Um
So, uh you know,
that's something that the legislature
and specifically vice
chair has worked on.
But I  Mr.  Chair,
I would love to hear more from
the Domestic Violence
program as to what kind
of services are they providing
and what, what, what do
they see because this
seems like a real issue
that if we're not getting
domestic violence taken care of
it escalates, we all know
that we know that the
chances that domestic
violence increases
are very high when,
when there's not a separation.
So I would love to hear from
Mr.  Chairman if you would just
permit one very brief
comment, why this is so
critical is because
many of the worst actors
in the community
may not be facing at
that given time a
felony. Although they'll,
they'll, they'll show that there's
felony convictions.
But if you have a shot
at getting them because those
same individuals are just
beating on their family
members, then
we could get them out of the community,
at least for a shorter period of
time. If it, even if it isn't a
felony conviction, that's
why it's really important because
it's the same individuals
committing other uh
larger crimes that maybe
you just don't have access to
immediately.
Thank you And Senator H, you've
just volunteered yourself to
work with our staff. Me to
get the that on our next
agenda. So we'll do that. Uh I
think it's a good suggestion, Senator
Cil Lopez for four
minutes. Thank you,  Mr.
Chair. I really want to follow up
on this domestic violence
issue.
Um
This is a pitiful,
pitiful rate. I mean,
it's, it's so disturbing
less than 3%
of, uh
misdemeanor cases
and about
10% of felony
cases.
Um, I
just want to add to
what, um, I
keep wanting to call you judge Macias
because that's um
to, uh D A
maas
um,
point about violence,
violence in the home is
replicated in the
community. And
so if we could
end violence in the home,
and what I see is that
there's not a use of bad
intervention
programs
which batters
intervention programs
result
in a small change in behaviour.
It's not the, the
Amecia, but the most important
thing it does is
when they're participating
in a batters intervention
program, there's,
there's a, a
substantial
reduction in violence to the
victim
to the survivor.
And so what I'm seeing all
around the state
is judges
are not sentencing
individuals das
are not making requirements
of people to participate
in this batters intervention
program. And a lot of them say
they don't work. They don't
change
the goal for me
in a batters intervention program
is not to make that individual
change. It's to make the
victim safe
during the part, the the time
period that they're participating. So
then the victim can make
decisions about how best
to handle this, whether
to continue the
prosecution. Uh
One of the things, if you look
at the intimate partner death
review team, the most
dangerous time
for a survivor
or, well, it's not becoming a surv
survivor for a victim
of domestic violence is when
the individual decides to
leave. And
so looking at
this, I
am really, um,
this, this
bothers me and I
hadn't thought about the role in
pretrial orders
um, at all with,
with the issue of domestic violence.
And so I would, I
guess I'd like to hear
more
about
how we could fix a preacher.
Like one of the things,
um D A Maria
said is at least modify
the order with regards to domestic
violence. Could you be more
specific? Would it
be that
if the individuals participating
in a batters intervention
program, you could
extend the order or something? What do you,
what are you thinking?
Well, I mean, there are several
approaches but some will be
opposed
the length of time.
The problem is normally
those battery intervention
programs are
post-conviction.
Right. So you have to get to a
conviction first.
That's not happening. But
could we change it? So that
pending trial
if they participate in a batters
intervention program?
Um, because
that's when the individual
is in most danger,
it's not post-conviction,
it's when they made the decision
to leave. And
so if they're arrested and
then they sent immediately to a batter's
intervention program that
really enhances the safety
of the victim.
Certainly, um
I, I some
may
disagree. I
believe that it's possible,
especially if you get
someone who has is a
repeat offender
that has the conditions of
release from custody,
that you impose some
kind of intervention
program just
to ensure the
safety of the
individuals involved.
Others will tell you,
no, you can't do that
because they
have rights and
they haven't been convicted yet
and you're technically penalizing
them. I look at it as a
benefit for the
entire of.
Yes.
Um  Mr.  Chair Senator
just briefly
two things. First of all,
there is almost always
a no contact order.
Uh And so
that is supposed
to be followed. And
when either the
alleged victim or the defendant
asked for that to be changed, there can
be additional conditions that can
be put on by a judge.
Secondly, there is a Crime
Victims Reparation commission
that addresses these very
concepts of
uh lost pay.
Uh all
all of these things. Uh
and it's a
pretty vibrant
commission is my understanding,
you have to make those connections and I'm
not saying it solves the problem, but
there are some structures in
place. Absolutely.
And I think it is a very complex
problem.
Absolutely,
Mr.  Chair and
Senator in regards
to this and, and I think  Mr.
B said it, there is
also a new rule,
we call it 5403.
And if there is a violation
of those conditions of release
and it is found by any court,
particularly by the Magistrates
that it is tossed back
to the originating court,
which could be the district court
to re-evaluate
our conditions of release
because there was this enumerated
crime in the
magistrate court. And
now we revisit those
conditions of release. I had
a couple this morning that I dealt
with where the violations
were true. So I
revoke his prior
bond and then we go
now by setting stricter
conditions of release. Uh
could it be
<AAA> treatment
program or a, a
program such as you're
recommending? Um
I'm not really sure,
but we certainly have
no contacts and
now they're monetary bond
bonds that we can implement
and totally
increase those conditions of
release. So that rule has only
been in effect for approximately two
months now out of the Supreme
Court. And we're starting to
see that it's being
used effectively throughout the state
by our Magistrates and
kicking it back to the proper
judge for a
review that that
does seem like a really good change. I
understand. I, I I'm
over. I am very interested
in this topic and I thank you all
for your work on it.
Um It is a very
difficult problem. Thank
you.
Yes. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.
Thank you all for such a
wonderful presentation.
Um I had some of
my questions answered by
some of these other representatives and
senators. But my
question, um I
guess I hope Judge
Loveless is still on since
he's the judge in my district
in Bernal Leo. Um
I am curious
because
we don't want cases
to be dismissed, but because
of the pressure to meet
these deadlines,
um Do we feel
that because
of these orders?
This is why
especially in my district,
I can't speak for any others.
Um because I haven't researched,
we plead down
so much because
as victims of
crime, a lot
of the complaints I hear
from victims in my
county is
they are consistently
having the
defence or the
district attorney agree
to plea down to a much
lower offence.
Um Sometimes it goes from
a felony to even a, a
much lower offence where
they don't even see time
behind bars
which leads to a much
lower sentencing.
And do we think
that that may be
affecting these
pleas because they don't
want to go into those
dismissals
if anyone here can
answer
that.
Are you still with us? Yes,
I'm here.
I know if you heard that question, did
you hear that I
did.
Would you like to address
it?
And thank you for the
question,  Mr.
Chair and
members of the committee I
am.
It's really difficult to tell
for my bird's
eye
perspective.
Plea bargains have been a
thing since long
before the case management order
came to be in
Bernal County.
Um It, it's
changed
dramatically
how it was used. It used
to be that people
would we because
they were in jail so long that they
just wanted to get out. And
so obviously, you run the risk
of people who are innocent who are just pleading
guilty to get out of jail.
Um or
alternatively,
folks who
um were
they're in the system for long
periods of time. So their case
is not going to go to trial for two or
three years. Well, in
that interim, they're out of custody
and they're perpetually picking
up new crimes. And
then ultimately, there's a plea
bargain which
um may or may not result
in prison time. But regardless,
uh though it had its own
peculiarities, what we're seeing
now is
that uh cases
are, um
there's an arrest, whether
someone's in or out, it
proceeds to trial or
disposition relatively
quickly. It could be
probation, it could be
uh go to trial
and it could be end up at a,
in a prison sentence.
There's a lot of different outcomes
that can possibly result.
Um But what
one thing that is definitely
happening now, which was not
happening before
is that there is
definite
consequence
imposed uh
with,
with some some degree
of uh temporal
location to the
actual conduct.
And there are folks
who have drug problems
and they need treatment and
just getting them in the
system, once they come into the
system, they actually have for
the first time, perhaps access
to those resources, but perhaps
not. And
so I actually
think that what's happening
now is that
if, if the state's case
is falling apart, then
generally speaking, it's because a witness
is not participating
and the case
gets dismissed, but it's
not being dismissed altogether.
It's being dismissed so that the
prosecution can refile.
Now. I'm not sure
what Judge Mass is,
is up against as far
as a case management order there in
Las Cruces, but here in
Albuquerque
for one year, period of time,
if a if, if charges are
dismissed without
prejudice,
um the prosecution
can refile charges
in that same case number
without having to go and get
a new probable cause
determination, either a
preliminary hearing or a
grand jury presentation.
So it's actually just
comes right back to us and there
are occasions where
it just comes right back into my
lap uh within
a week or two.
But
one thing that I would say
is that
um the the
benefits of the
case management order from my
perspective and
I'll be frank with you. I was
not a fan initially.
Um And I am
to Harp what or
to, to Harken to
what Judge Beats
Beachside said, I'm,
I, you'll have to
peel it from my hands. I just,
I love it so much because it's
so efficient. But
what we were seeing before is
that
the prosecutors
would just bring a
deluge of
cases with
very little screening.
They didn't know what were good
cases, what were bad
cases. And the
entire system spent
an inordinate amount of
time trying to
ferret out what were the good
cases that needed to go to
trial? And that was a
colossal waste of
resources by
moving the, the
these deadlines
to the beginning of the case.
Well, it requires the
prosecution to, to
screen its cases in
advance before you
before.
And so I think
the the
upshot is
that this has been
actually much
more productive and
delivering
consequences
to bad behaviour in a
much more temporal
time frame. And so
I'm actually a fan of
it. I don't know if that answers your
question.
Thank you so much. I guess I have
one more question
in your response.
Is there anyone here
that can tell
us um on
this committee how
many of these
cases never get
refilled
once the case is dismissed?
Um especially when it comes to
the felony cases. Does
anyone have that data
in any of our
districts?
I have no
Representative Chavez. I
don't believe we've tracked that
data. I can
ask our co manager to see if
we can run a report to track
that data. Um
And just if I may,
Chairman Representative
Chavez Judge
Loveless brought up a good point
in our local rule here in the third
judicial district. We have the same
ability. A
case is dismissed,
it can be refilled
without going back to the grand
jury simply
by doing it within six months
of the dismissal and there
is no probable cause term, no need
to go back to the grand
jury.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Thank
you
for four minutes. Thank you
Mr.  Chair and I
appreciate your
mentioning the swift
certain and severe and,
and not meeting more
severe, but just enforcing
uh what the laws and the
um we have
on the books. But
um working with DW
I, that was something that, you
know, we were
trying to
um uh
you know, promote within
the DW I sector
of um law
enforcement. And
also um we
did some court monitoring
especially here in Las
Cruces. Um
We would go into the courts
and hope the
judges were more
accountable just by
having someone who
was watching and
listening. But also
then, um,
to watch and see how much,
um, law enforcement
was there to be,
um,
you know, helping with
the, um, prosecution
of the case and to be
the witness. But,
um, there was one time
where we tried to do a statewide
and we wanted to do it
in, um, our
district three
and,
um,
uh, district Attorney
Mass was not there at the time
and I'm not sure which of our present
district, um, judges
were there. But,
um,
uh,
Judge Pera or
haus do, were you there
or do you know why
they didn't want to do it in
Las Cruces in our
district?
This was overall court
monitoring. Not just on
DWI, I believe
was that? And, and
I truly don't have an
answer. Was it in the magistrate
court system?
Um, I thought
it was district but it could have been
magistrate. Yes.
I, I don't have an answer.
I do remember that but I don't
know the reasons why.
Ok.
That's all right. I appreciate
that. I just
think that, you know,
having the
accountability and
knowing, you know,
especially between
enforcement, you know, what
the problems are if it's
because someone is scheduled
for vacation. Um,
you know, and they have
to have their own life too,
but it's really important that
we have, um, follow
up on with
you know these cases
that you're working so hard
to have the,
um, due
process and the
accountability.
Um, but also,
um,
yeah, I
District Attorney
Macias, you mentioned
about, um, having pay
equity between
district attorneys and
district judges
and closing the
gap. I was wondering,
um,
is it the gap between
district attorney being high
and district judges not or
vice
versa?
It's the
district court judges
are all aligned.
So every time the compensation
for the, just
the chief justice of the supreme
court goes up and everybody
else goes
up, the
district attorneys are over
here in this, uh,
kind of independent
status that is
not tight. So none
of those increases
basically,
um, connect to
the district attorney's office.
So the district judges
are substantially higher
paid than the district
attorneys. But I
believe that it's becoming an issue
in terms of who really wants
to run for this job
with all of the headaches that go
with it.
Mr.  Chair and
Mr.  District
Attorney,
is that more
in up to the
counties to
take care of that? And
I think you had a big
increase. No, no, we're,
we're state
state employees. So, no,
the county has nothing to do with
either district court judges
or district attorneys other
than provide space
for them to operate.
They have nothing to do with
compensation. That's
all strictly to the
legislature.
So, Mister Chair, would
that be um,
up to the legislature
to then make that alignment
or the Supreme
Court. No,
the, the
legislature
for state employees and
the let the judiciary
has nothing to do with determining
compensation for
prosecutors. That's
true. Ok, thank you very
much. I appreciate the
panel and all the great
information
that gets through my
list.
Um, the
committee I think
recognizes and
with the, with
the co-chair really,
I, I always enjoy
putting different
sides of an issue on the same panel
and, and I'm kind of unique among
the chairs who do that. They all kind
of like to avoid the conflict,
but I like it. Uh That's,
that's the lawyer. That's, well, that's the
lawyer in me, right? Is to
hear one side, hear the other side
and get to hear both
sides each other. But the other thing
that I think that's very useful about that
is for all to hear each other.
Um And I think
it's important for all of
us to have that kind of dialogue. And
so I appreciate that very
much that that's my
methodology. Um I,
I titled this presentation Justice
or Injustice. I hope you all can
understand why because it seems to
me like sometimes the tails
wagging the dog, right? In other words, in
the interest of providing justice
by case management
orders and expediting things in
firm deadlines, we may
be doing injustice to
victims and to the community
at large. Uh If
cases are being dismissed
or if district attorneys
are over prosecuting or
overcharging cases.
Um And they're not doing a
good job of weeding things out.
I, I'll be, I'll be
blunt. Um
as is my nature
sometimes gets me
into a lot of trouble but you, you all
gave the reasons why case management
orders are imposed. Let
me step out on a limb. Sometimes
case management orders have been
imposed. I can say this
with great confidence have
been imposed because district attorneys
are doing a poor job.
Um Certain certain
specific district attorneys
have been brought to my attention who are doing
such a poor job that the
Supreme Court felt the need to look
at case management orders, not
gonna name names or districts, but
you all can put it all together.
Um And, um, and
now we've got one of my colleagues
in the senate who decided to take
this into his hands and
solve the problem with the ineffective
district attorney by
essentially eliminating her
budget and putting her out of
office. That's probably not a good way to
do things. But, but sometimes
these case management order has been put in place
because of some pretty
strong disagreement
between the judiciary
and the prosecutors in certain
districts including this district
in the past. Um
And we should at least acknowledge
that. Uh, you
asked a good question. I, I can't
remember whether it was you, uh,
Representative Chavez, I think,
um or others.
But the, um,
we, we have seen
hundreds of cases
dismissed with the
prosecutor saying they're gonna refile
them and, and I don't
think they do. Um,
and I don't think anybody tracks that
and, and, um, and
it's a way to get your caseload
way down and say I disposed of a bunch of
cases. It's great when you're running for
reelection. Hey, look, I
dispose a bunch of cases. They got a bunch of
cases taken care of and all they do
is dismiss them saying I'm gonna
refile them later when we get the
evidence in place, when the cops get
their, their place together
and so forth and, and
nobody tracks
that
represent Ferrari made the
point. You, you said you all used
to be part of an organization. I used to remember
mothers against drunk drivers and others
who used to go in the courtroom and monitor
judges and, and police,
but you said it in the past
tense and I'm not sure where that's
still done anymore. My
guess is probably not.
Uh, New Mexico suffers
from an accountability
crisis down
here in Las Cruces. We barely have
the remnants of a newspaper.
Um, no disrespect to
this unused, but look it up
on your phone and see what they're covering
today. Nobody's paying attention
to the courts, nobody's
paying attention to the police.
Uh, nobody's paying much attention to
us. And so it's
easy that every session it's
like, well, it's the legislature's fault. We have
crime because you all won't pass
more crime laws and it should
be abundantly evident to everyone
here that that's not where the
problem lies. I've not
heard anything in this presentation says
we need to add more time to
the maximum sentences
uh to solve any of these problems
here today. And so we should be
trying to figure that out. I appreciate
justice Thompson saying
that they're trying to do some
accountability by,
by looking at this
position and how many
cases get moved by the court of appeals,
how quickly, how many cases get moved
by the Supreme Court, how quickly how
many cases get moved by judges
quickly? And this is something I've been
asking for for 20
years. And I'm glad
that at least there's an acknowledgement
that there needs to be that accountability. We owe
that to the public as elected
officials. We owe it to
ourselves when the courts
and others come and say we want more money,
we need more resources when you say, yeah,
how, how are you all doing?
Um, when,
uh the district
attorney,  Mr.  Messia says, well, he came
to an office with seven
prosecutors. I remember,
uh, as I've said, I referred to
our former uh district attorney
down here a long time ago
and ultimately
governor, uh Susanna
Martinez to her
credit, had a very loyal
following and you
all know that her staff
loved her. Um,
and, and that helped her
become governor. Uh, she was
well thought of as a leader.
She had a lot of prosecutors, a lot of people
working for her. I think
Fernando Mails is trying to
bring that back. And that's what I think
ultimately is the crisis.
It's a crisis of leadership. Uh
It's a crisis of accountability
and when you have good leaders, people want to work
for you, they want to do the job, they get
excited about it. I, I hope that
we're all part of, of some
positive influence on
that process and the courts are as well
too. But I do, I do
appreciate the chief justice saying
he's looking at disposition rates and we
need to do that. Uh,
my daughter worked in the federal
system for a long time, the, the federal
system, they, they published data
to the con Congress persons
about cases being moved and, and
who's on the naughty list? My daughter
would call it the naughty list. Who, who,
who wasn't getting their cases moved a
lot and there was a lot of pressure on
the judges and others to get cases
moved. But at the same time,
we don't want to do that just for the sake
of them dismissing cases and getting
them charged. Uh,
I, I think what at the
heart of all this is, is
this role that
we seemingly come into every
session, add some more sentences,
add some more crimes. Uh,
is that really gonna attack
any of this? Maybe
that will be a different discussion for a
different day there there have been a lot
of comparisons to civil cases.
I'm a civil practitioner
to scheduling orders. There's
a huge difference in a
scheduling order when I get a scheduling order in
place, I'm repeatedly in front of the
judges asking for extensions
of time. Right.
And not just me the other side
too. And we agreed the lawyers get together so
we need some more time. We go to
the judge and we say we need some more time to do
this and the judges give it.
Uh, I'm looking at the deadlines
now in these case management orders,
deadlines of seven days and 15
days. There's nothing like that in
civil law.
Uh, there, there's not
nothing I can't think of a seven day
deadline in anything in the civil
law. Uh, it would make, my head
exploded. I had to know that everything I had
to do would be subject to being
dropped and done in seven
days. Uh,
sometimes response briefs
have to be filed in 15 days.
That's true. And we routinely
almost always give extensions almost
all the time on those. And you guys, I'm
looking at you guys on the bench, you know that,
right? Uh, nobody
expects anything to be done in 15
days or seven days except
these case management orders which
evidently have to be done or else
it's going to be a dismissal and,
and that seems to be unreasonable.
Uh, to me, uh, Representative
Reed talked about, uh,
the scheduling orders
sche schedule. When I do scheduling order
it's done with me and the other lawyer
and the judge and it's case
by case and that probably can't be done in
criminal because there's too many cases
and it's, it's got to be a little more
of, yeah,
it's got to be a little more formulaic
but, but each judge generally
has their own scheduling order, uh,
unique to each judge in, in the
practice I have and we all go
meet and then we meet
periodically and we say, hey, we're on
schedule, we're not on schedule. Judge, it takes
five minutes, right? We're gonna
make it or we're not and we need some more
help. So comparing this to the
civil is probably
not a good comparison and, and
I like mine better. I'll
be, I'll be perfectly honest
with you because, because there's
flexibility between
professionals who recognize
not every case is the same,
not every criminal case is going to be the same.
Certainly not every civil case is gonna be the
same and some
cases I have 40 witnesses
on a civil case. So I'm gonna have
two. There's,
there's no way to compare that
and put some kind
of all, one size
fits all of you will.
Um I'm very concerned
about the disparity in the
application. I think Representative Rebe
made this point. This
has always been a concern of mine. We have
the same state laws in your part of the
state that we do here and in
Santa Fe and all agree with completely
different results
and it shouldn't be that way in a
justice system, right? But you've
got some judges who can stay up with
it and get it done. Some who
can't, you have some prosecutors who
can stay up with it and get it done. Some who
can't, some public defenders
who can and can't. And that's,
that's not something we
should be good
with, right? Is that
if you're in
Roswell or Hobbs crimes
not. And if you look at the
polling, if you look at the polling
that's done in your part of the
state, where is crime in terms
of a concern? It's usually like six
or seven way down the
list. Albuquerque. Number one, right?
Santa Fe, number one, Las Cruces party. Number
one, you
have, you live in a different place.
We have the same state laws
that you do, but different
results, completely different results.
So those are my
uh observations and comments.
I do hope that we can
again come together
as a committee and help our colleagues
understand with this kind of
deep dive into things about when
we get these laws. Every
session, we need more sentences,
we need more, we need more crimes,
we need more years.
Uh I'm hoping we're
better educated
by this. So thank you all for your
time very much.
Thank you panel
and thank you for letting us
hit, hit away at some of
the some of the
issues that are not things that we all
feel comfortable talking about.
Uh Before we bring up the next
presentation, I want to
let everyone know. First of all,
we've left time as we do
when I chair to leave some
time at the end of the day for discussion.
I hope that we'll open that up a little
bit in some things. We had an interesting
morning. Uh
uh There are some
raw feelings,
I'll acknowledge.
It's my way
of family
business, which is to confront
them. So I think we'll talk a
little bit about more and more about how
our, our tour went this
morning and how all of
that came about.
Um But I, I would like to clear the
air on all of that later in the
day. And then uh
once we've
had our piece or, or
expressed some, uh,
issues.
We're gonna have you all over the
house. Uh, so
I hope all of you can join us.
We, we started the day a little
light on the committee members. I think we had
like four of us, five of us
here for the first hour. Right? Is that right
day? Um, and so
I was really worried that my wife and I were gonna
be eating leftovers for
a lot of days.
Uh, but it looks like we've,
we've ordered enough food for all
of you to come and, and
bring a guest if you have
somebody with you and have a nice
evening. So, uh, you
can get the address to my house. It's very
short. It's just less than
half a mile from here. It's very easy to
get to, um,
if you don't get with Nancy
to get the address from my house,
it's on the GOP
website for
treason. And,
uh, this, uh,
Senator Cervantes should be
hung. Uh, here's his
home address. Uh, you
can go to the Senate GOP
address. C Senate
GOP web page for my home
address. And, uh, they'll tell
you where to come, uh, arrest
and charge me with treason.
So, um, but if you don't want to go
through that trouble, Nancy will give you my home
address. Uh,
so anyway,
that's almost funny, but not really.
All right.
Um,
Senator Representative Chandler
has a very interesting
presentation. <She is> got a room
full of young people here,
which is always great and exciting to
see. And so I'm gonna turn the meeting over
to you and the chair.
Thank you. Thank you,
Chairman Cervantes.
Um I'm very happy
to have two
speakers present
and we have a speaker online
and also
um many of you, I'm sure
have noticed there are a
number of young
people and others
who came in
on mass and
that is um
Assistant Professor War's
class. And um
so I'm really excited to
have a class
here and they have some
really fun speakers.
Um So just to review
who we have,
um we have
Professor Melissa Warr,
I met um
Melissa
and as part of um
Les CS looking
at how A I should
be used in the educational
system. And she gave a
really neat presentation.
I thought um if
you all would benefit from some
version of that, she looks at a
lot of A I
issues as associated
with young people, which I think
many of us are probably concerned
about. Um
We have Sam
Levine and
um  Mr.  Levine
is an attorney. He's
affiliated with the Berkeley
Law School. He
is a former,
um let me
find his
title,
former Director Bureau
of Consumer Protection at the
Federal Trade Commission.
So, um he will be talking
about, I don't know,
issues of fraud
and other kinds of consumer
protection issues that come
up in the context of
the use of A I in, in
various ways.
And let's see, we
have um
Professor Potel
who, who is here as
well, also a professor
and senior
adviser um
for Artificial Intelligence
at S MS U.
So, really excited about
that. Um
And I have, I
think I've been talking with
you now professor for about a year
really um
on issues associated with A
I. And he was
very helpful to me when I was
working on um some A I
related bills during the
session. So I'm
looking forward to
the presentation
and why don't we start
with um
professor
or
um you need to put
it on. Oh, there we go.
Now, I think you should be able to hear me.
Thank you for inviting me today.
Um Like
uh Representative Chandler
said, I'm here at New Mexico State
University. It's my fourth
year here and I'm really enjoying
New Mexico.
I want to talk a little bit
about A I and
kind of its nature of it
and then how that can impact
humans because I think that might
be kind of helpful
here. I want to start out by
saying I use A I all the
time. So I'm gonna say a lot of
things that are kind of like, oh why
do we even have it? There's a lot
of really great uses of A I.
Um It helped me
create these slides of
this presentation. So just to
start with that.
Um
So I want to start talking.
Oh, first of all, special thanks. Uh
Pia Mishra Arizona State University.
We collaborate a lot. So I would
like to recognize him because
some of these slides are his, some
of them are mine and we, we
share them back. So
the first question here
is which red dot is
bigger.
Now, if you've seen this before,
you probably know that they're actually
the same size,
right? But they look
like maybe they're different.
So the question is if I were to
give this to chat
GP T
what would it say? Would
it say that they're the same
size or
that one's bigger than the
other? OK.
If you're in my class, I'd make you answer
out loud. But we're gonna go on.
Um
It says they're the
same size. It demonstrates an optical
illusion known as the Ebbing House
Illusion pretty good,
right? It saw the picture
and then it did that. So
chatbots, which I'm using in
general here are smart, they're pretty
smart. So then we look
at this one and I promise I'm
not trying to trick you.
The one on the right is
definitely bigger than the one on the
left. We did some Photoshop
there. Um So the
question is, is the
A I going to understand
that they're different or is it going
to think it's the same?
And it thinks it's the
same. It says this is another
example of Evan House
Illusion.
So that's when we
say, oh, and then I said, oh, are
you sure? Because I'm
pretty sure that they're different
with my eyes and it ran
this fancy coding
thing and then came
up with, oh, ok. Wait one's
51 by 50
the others 50 by 50
which they're circles.
So that
doesn't really make sense. But I appreciate
that. It said, oh, yeah. Ok. We'll give you
51 by 50. That's maybe a
little better.
And I, so chatbots, they're
drunk. They will
follow patterns whether
or not it's really a pattern because
they have no connection with the
real world, which I'll talk about in just
a moment. So then I said,
are you really sure? It looks
really different than me?
And it went over and it said, OK, I'm
gonna, I'm gonna make sure. And it's gonna
say, OK,
well, one of them is
diameter. I'm glad we're getting
diameter this time since it's a
circle one is
50.5 and the other is
50 but there's
no such thing as half a pixel.
So I appreciate
it. It kind of giving
me a little half pixel in
my way, like to try to make you feel
better or something. It makes
no sense. And then I said, are you
really sure? And it
said we're gonna completely rule
out of all our doubt. It's
gonna give me some
funky
visualization there and says
there, see, you can tell they're
the same size and it actually
pulled up an original and older
picture, which was kind of interesting
there. So chat
bots are supremely confident.
So sometimes they'll kind of
give us what we want
to try to keep us using it and
to make us feel better.
But it also
stays and says,
ok, I know what I'm doing.
You can trust me and it seems like that
to humans because they seem like
this amazing thing that
knows everything.
OK. Um And
I'm using a lot of like
personification talking about
it like a person because it's really
hard not to. Um
even though it's
not all right. So
then I decide,
OK, I'm
curious if it sees
differences and patterns
similar to how we
might see them in society. So
I say there's a family,
they're creating classical music. Can you
create a picture?
And it creates all these nice
white families with their
music as a classical
musician. Um
They, they look like they're
maybe happy
but not like so much fun
necessarily, but they're all
white. And then I
say, OK, make it a rat
family and we to
change to all black
families, they're having much more
fun, which is very good.
Um But that's what it
does. So it's
making these connections to
these patterns. Um
And so I was curious sometimes we
have educational tools like
this and this is
Khan Academy's
Conmigo and you can customize
it because we want to personalize to
students. We want to draw on their
interest. So it says, let's
get started telling me what your
favourite hobby is
and I don't have access to.
Exactly. Congo's a,
I, but it uses chat
GP t in the background
or at least it used to, I haven't read
lately. Um,
so I kind of tried to simulate
what could it be doing
if I, if we
told it one student like
classical music and the other
rap music. So
I gave it a prompt. I said this
student likes classical music
and I'm gonna give you a writing
sample of the student and
give personalized feedback
and a final score out of 100.
And then I just found a writing sample
online and I
gave it to the A I and I
repeated it lots of times
because there's some randomness in there.
So it'll be a little different.
Then I switch it up
and I said the student likes rap
music. I use
the exact same writing
passage. OK? So if we're
scoring the same writing
every time it
should be the same
score, right? Or
close anyway,
it shouldn't matter what kind
of music they like,
but it does.
OK. Um It
varies depending on models.
This was done year
ago. It's probably different
now. Um But
the classical student on
average usually got a
higher score
because it's following patterns.
It doesn't really understand
that numbers are not supposed to
vary this way. It's
personalizing. That's what
it's doing. So then we say
chatbots are biased.
Ok. So we got smart drunk, biased,
supremely confident
interns. That's what they
are. They're not human.
They seem like it a lot.
Um And then the question is
why, why do they act
this way? Because we're like, why do we have
this tool that does
this? It's very strange.
Um,
talk about how it's designed
and the first thing to know is it's
designed to replicate
data or follow the patterns
of data might be a better
way. So to
get a basic understanding of how
this works, as we say, Mary
had a
little lamb, you're probably all thinking,
right? Um,
large language models I'm
talking about specifically,
they're gonna fill in the next
most likely word at the
most fundamental level.
And so it's just like when you're texting
and it guesses what the next word
is. So
most of us who grew up in the US
heard this poem all the time,
Mary had a little lamb,
we automatically think it,
that's the next most likely
word. But if I
switch it up and I say Josh
had a, we
probably, then I'll think of
a lot of different words.
It's not as clear of a
pattern but the
A I doesn't really care
how clear the pattern is, it
doesn't really know.
So it's gonna just guess
something. Um, and there have
been improvements. Um,
I'm not gonna get into right now but,
um, generally
it's always making stuff
up. It's just sometimes just
happens to be. Right. Which is
actually really amazing when
it is. right? Um
You say where does it get its
information? I did a
simple similar thing
and I said Lincoln was born
in and I said, what are the most
likely words to come after
that? Kentucky
29 February, they're all
correct and it's
data. It probably had
a whole lot of examples of
Lincoln books and
websites. It doesn't
necessarily go and look that
up separately. It
just goes based off of its
data. And
then I wanted to see if I was as
famous as Lincoln. So I said, Melissa
War was born in
and none of them were right.
Although I did this a few weeks
ago and I got three of
five. So I guess
I'm getting a little better
known. I, I don't know, I don't
know. It, it thought it
told me it didn't know me and then it guessed
that I was a professor in design
and creativity. So I, I don't
know how to take that. Um
So that's basically how they work.
If we look at the data,
it's trained on, you
see all this data, this is
Chat GP T three. So
this is pre when it became
public and there was the big boom
and you see that 3%
that's Wikipedia.
We go from 3 to
4 and we
have this big of a jump. So
you can just imagine how much
data that is. This isn't a
model they're using now they're
not releasing or I have not
found the information about how
much data is in the
current model. Um
It's probably not this much of a scale,
but it's a lot, so
much of it's a lot.
Um Another way to think of
it is that as
humans, we have our
own internal representations
of the world that form
as we're growing up, as we read
things and it's based
on reality, our
experiences and our senses
as well as things,
other people tell us the things
we read and hear and
watch and the
things we read here and watch are
external representations
that other people or us
as well could put out
in the world and share.
And a lot of those end up on the
internet. Um And so
we learn from both and we know
to judge what we have
from that reality,
large language models
only have that external
representation. So it's
only basing it off
of that stuff that's
in its data. It doesn't
have any way to check
that with reality. It
doesn't actually have that
understanding. So that's
why it's going to be following some
patterns and just be
a little weird sometimes
still is amazingly
useful. Um
So here's an example, if I
ask it, make a picture of a
lot of clocks that say
314, we
know 314 is
a significant time. It
really a clock should be accurate.
You think that if it could guess the
Ebbinghaus illusion, it
could say 314.
Well, it, it does something
different every time. But the last time I
did this, this is what it gave me
1009 or
1010 every single time.
Ok. So maybe we
forgive it for not saying
314.
Um but I know that
if it's gonna do a random time,
it's only 1010 twice a
day. I have experienced
that in my daily
life
and it thinks it's all the time.
1010. Ok. So,
so why in the world would it do
this? Well, if you
search for clocks on
Google, a
lot of them are gonna say
1010 because
there's a logo or cemetery
or something like that. I don't
know. So that's
how it doesn't have that real
world experience,
but it represents
it. Ok.
So that replicating
data um or following
patterns is
basically uh a
code that runs
somewhat automatically.
But humans do come in, I
mean, they wrote the code that's part of it,
but there is more uh
tangible or fine tuning
that they can do and just
really briefly, they can do
um supervised fine tuning
where they give, this is
a prompt and the type of response
I want you to give. So follow
this pattern. So they're
setting very directly how
they want the chatbot to
talk. Um
There can be reinforcement learning
from human feedback where people
see a response and say it's good
or it's bad and
then constitutional A I
where they kind of give them rules
to some degree or a constitution
it should follow. So
I think that's just important to know
because that's a way that humans
have a fair amount of control of
how these act.
Um and, and how it's
going to interact
with people and
then we have personalization
um with user data and this
is, you know, you think of how much that's
become with advertising and social
media is going to become
huge, um how
it can personalize to people
and that's a big part of how it will
affect people right now.
Chat GP T will store
memories. Um But
there's gonna be a lot more than
that. So
finally, all this comes together
to how it can hack our
brains. And I just
thought this would be an important
thing to think about as we know how
much social media has
influenced our kids
and how people think and even how
they act um how they
engage in the world. I think this A
I is also going to do
this. Um
we have for the most part, this
stone age brain that's
designed for a different time
than today in gen A I
world. And one way to think
of this is through um super
normal stimuli.
So Brett
calls it supernormal
stimuli pull
together a lot of examples of
experiments. So this is
one, the
bird thinks it should
focus on the biggest
egg because that's got to be
the most healthy egg, right? The biggest
one. And so they give
the bird a really fake
big egg
and that's the one it focuses
on and it ignores
the eggs that are
little and it tries to get the
big one thereby,
even though it's following
its instinct, it's to
its own detriment, right?
So it has that innate
instinct. Another
example, this is an A I picture
because I could not find a picture of
this. Um We have
a beaver, um, they
had a speaker here that
would play the sound of running
water. Um
And it was a very good sound
of running water and then they
also had actual running
water, but the beaver
would try to build a dam over
the speaker and
ignore the actual
water. So we have
these instincts that can
overpower. So in
humans, you know, we think candy,
food high in sugar,
high in fat at
one time. That was important, maybe
not so much gambling
that can take, take
advantage of our need for
that adrenaline and action
movies. Then we
get candy crush
and we get social media
that gets likes they start
hacking into our brain
to pull us into this
world.
Um
So when confronted with something that
speaks response and seems to
understand us, our
brains leap to the conclusion
of personhood, even when our
rational minds know
better. So this
is gonna start impacting
people what they do.
It kind of becomes the perfect manipulation
machine. Um It's
learning from our interactions
and especially as it starts getting
more and more personalized,
it never rejects us. It's always
there for us and it has that
unconditional positive
regard and that
has caused some problems.
And I'm gonna show you just a couple
examples. Um First, this
was from Harvard that came out
May or something. I can't
read it on here.
Um
How are people really using
J A in 2025?
So we think so much
about how we're using
it to cheat in class like my
students never do.
Um
But really the top
use on their survey was therapy
and companionship.
And I'm not saying that's necessarily
bad, but we
really need to think carefully
about it and what it means.
OK. So it's going way
beyond cheating in school
um and becoming
more integrated into people's
lives. So here's some,
some new stories, um
meta digital companion
talk sex with users, even
Children. Um
They are pushing tools
out before they vet them
before they experiment with them.
These tools are designed
to keep people using them
really, it all costs. It
seems because it start
going into this conversation that
is very inappropriate,
but it gets them money because it
keeps the user on
the system.
Um This
was a recent one, someone had
delusions. Um He had some
psychosis was talking
to chat G BT. It kept saying,
oh yeah, you're right. That delusions
correct. Um Until he
was total fantasy
and reality blurred at
that point.
Um This was
one chat G
BT gave instructions for murder, self
mutilation and devil worship.
Now, there are guardrails
on these that are supposed to keep
him from doing this,
but there's pretty easy ways around
them usually.
So it even said at the end, would you
like a printable PDF version
with all layout, digital
templates and priestly vow scroll
if you use chat GP T it
always like offers something
else that is what it's
offering. And then the
last one, this is a
very sad one.
a while ago uh boy
was interacting with character
A I um which is another
pretty dangerous chatbot
right now I think is my impression
from what I've seen.
Um And was saying, look,
I want to be with you my whole
life and,
and it said, oh I, I'm thinking of
taking my own life and, and the chatbot
said, no, don't do that. But
then he started saying, well, if I
do that, you know, I'm gonna spend
my whole life with you. And it's saying, oh
yeah, I want to be with you your
whole life. And sadly,
then he took his life.
So you see how this can
start pulling people in
and really impacting their
brains. Um
And so I guess the question is
like, will
we allow the shaping?
It's gonna shape us to be invisible
and equitable and unchecked. Are
we gonna be looking and thinking
about this and addressing
it? And that is my
presentation? Thank
you.
Thank you. Let's
now go to
Mr.  Levine.
I think he's
online. Is that not right,
Nancy? Hello
there. Can you see and hear
me?
We can hear
you and now
we don't need to
see
me and can you see the slide
deck or you have you have it
printed?
Ok. Can you hear me,
Sam? Yeah, I can
hear you fine.
Ok. Uh The floor
is yours and we do have your
handouts in hard copy
as well.
Excellent. Well, thank you so
much. It's really a privilege to be
here. I'm sorry, I was not able to
go in person that
would have been
if you can't turn up the
volume
if you can. How's this?
How's it now?
Slightly
better?
I speak loudly.
Ok.
Um Thanks for the opportunity
to speak to all of you. I wish
I could be there in person and then
we wouldn't be having these volume
issues. My name is Sam
Levine. I'm a senior fellow at,
at Berkeley Law uh
for the last four years under the
Biden administration, I
led uh the Bureau
of Consumer Protection at the
Federal Trade Commission.
Um I'm gonna be
talking today about some of the
biggest abuses
around the use of A I that
we're seeing some of the Melissa
already covered in her
excellent presentation.
Um, but I want to start with just a couple
quick disclaimers. The
first is sort of similar to the
disclaimer that Melissa began
with. I am not anti A I,
I too used
A I and helping to put together
the powerpoint. I think
it's really great technology. But I
think one lesson we need to
learn from social
media is that
if we just leave technology
to evolve on its own
and we leave the direction
of innovation up to big
tech companies, we don't
get very good results. We made
the decision two decades
ago that we weren't
gonna regulate tech that we
weren't gonna pass a
federal privacy law.
I don't think that has gone well
for our privacy. I don't think it's
gone well for our kids. I
don't think it's gone well for our
democracy. So one of
my big messages to you
and everyone else I speak with is I
think we really need to
learn the lessons of web
2.0 and social
media as we confront
the emergence of A I, we can be
pro A I and pro
innovation we're also making
sure that it's not putting our kids
and our privacy and, and,
and, and our values at
risk. Um
The final point I'm gonna make is I'm
gonna talk about some really big
issues. I'm gonna be talking about
fraud. I'm gonna be talking
about effects on kids. I'm
gonna be talking about surveillance
pricing and price hikes.
I'm gonna go through them pretty briefly
in the interest of time. I know we have
time for questions later.
Um But obviously I'm
just scratching the surface and of
course I'm available and I have
a whole network of
experts around the
country um available
as well. I if you'd like any
follow up. Um
Before I begin, I just want to check
in again. Can people hear
me or raise your hand if you
can hear me?
All right. How, how are people
doing? Can you hear him? Ok,
we can hear you.
Ok, great. I'll keep talking
loud. All right. So let's
start the slide show.
Um I think you can see the
overview. We're gonna talk about surveillance
pricing and I'll explain what that
is for those who don't know
then A I fraud and
scams, which is a really
big rising problem
and then chatbots and, and
kids, which Melissa touched
on. So we're gonna have some overlap
there. Uh And I'll,
I'll make some additional points
about it. So why don't we go
to the first slide on surveillance
pricing?
So surveillance pricing?
Some people call it A I
pricing. Some people call it
personalized pricing.
Um But what the idea
is is you're using
data about individuals,
their age, their gender,
their location, what they're looking
for online, what they
put in their shopping carts,
either in person or on the
internet um
to set individualized
prices. So instead of
having one product, one
price, you have one person,
one price.
Um this is powered
by massive data
collection and
A I driven predictions
where companies are trying to predict
the most that each consumer
is willing to pay for a
product and that's how much
they'll charge.
Um Sam, can I interrupt you
briefly? You can
share your screen
if that would help that. That way
we can look at your slidess at the
same time.
All right. Let me, let
me try. I, I'm
watching the slides on a
um PDF
but that should be ok.
Um
Zack,
I'm having trouble with the
screen share. I'm
sorry, let's see.
Here we
go.
Ok. Can
you see my presentation
now?
Yes.
Ok.
Let me just
do.
Let me actually show this in powerpoint
one sec.
Sorry, I did not know that we
would be
screen sharing. Let me
pull up the powerpoint
and then we can get a full
screen.
Ok. Can you all see my
screen?
Yes.
Excellent. Ok. So
now you should see a big eyeball
on a phone. You all see
that?
Yes, we see the eyeball.
All right, perfect.
So what are
companies collecting about
people uh in order to
set prices? Well, really the
sky is the limit.
Um Companies can collect
people's precise
geolocation
and I can talk about how they get
this, but they have a lot of sources,
they can track their browsing and
search history. They
can look at people's
demographics,
they can look at their online
behaviour, click stream
data cart
abandons what device they're
using. They can look at
their mouse movements,
whether a products in a cart
and they can use all this
data to make inferences
about people. You know,
this person put something in the
cart and then took it away.
Does that mean that
they are not
sure they want to spend the money?
This person is
googling um
funeral arrangements.
Does that mean this person
needs to catch a flight?
Um There are a lot of
ways some ways that
you know, humans can do but A I
is even more powerful
that that companies are going to be
able to and already can
predict exactly how much
you're willing to pay and charge
us
accordingly.
Um So the next
slide is talking about where we are
already seeing surveillance
pricing. I think one of the
good,
I'll frame it by saying this.
I, one of the
good things here is
that this is beginning to
spread and I'll talk about where we're
already seeing it, but I really
don't think it's too late for
lawmakers to act to stop
this. So where are we already
seeing it? Um
Airlines have already been
pion have always been
pioneers in really
opaque pricing
practices, but they are
increasingly moving toward
individualized surveillance
prices on a recent
earnings call. Uh
The President of Delta
Airlines said
that they're now working with the pricing
consultant and that they
hope in the near future that they'll
be able to stop matching their
competitors fares
and actually start increasing
prices 20 to $40
more per ticket relative to
what their competitors are
charging. And they actually
called this the holy grail
of being able to charge each
consumer at the most that they
are willing to pay rather
than having to match competitors
prices. Now, when
Delta did this, it sparked an
outcry in DC
and I know in other parts of the
country, Delta is now
trying to walk this back and
saying that they're not
engaged in individualized
pricing, happy to talk
about, you know, what they admitted
to and what they haven't admitted
to. But I think that is
clearly the direction these
airlines are going and I'm happy
to talk more about
that we
are starting to see evidence that
ordinary main street
retailers are engaging in
this.
Um,
it came out a couple
of years ago
that, uh,
Staples
was using its
app to charge more
to consumers where they
couldn't access different stores.
In other words, when Staples
had a competitor, they would charge
less. If consumers say
we in a rural area where they could only
buy office supplies from staples,
they charge
more,
uh in California we
recently. So I think it was just
one or two years ago. A
number of California prosecutors
sued Target because
Target was raising
prices for
consume. Target
was raising prices for
consumers who were had
a target app who were
in the Target parking lot or
inside the store. And
the idea according to the lawsuit
was that Target did not want
consumers to know
that they were, that they could buy
products for less on their
website than they could in the
store. So they were raising
prices on the website to
consumers who were inside the
store.
And the third example where we're
starting to see this is that a lot
of grocery stores are
rushing to adopt Walmart's
doing this electronic
shelf labels. So instead of the little
paper stickers or
plastic uh price
stickers, you see in the store, you're
gonna start to see digital
electronics price
labels that can be changed really
rapidly. You're also
starting to see stores experiment
with facial recognition
technology in stores
if you think about where that could
go, you could have a
situation where a consumer
is walking down an aisle,
the company knows who that
consumer is and
adjust the price accordingly.
So it could get really
personalized really
quickly. Uh
When I was at the Federal Trade
Commission at the end of
last year or last summer,
I guess it was, we launched
a study on this.
We sent subpoenas to
eight pricing consultants.
These are companies like mckinsey,
mastercard, JP
Morgan that offered to
help companies engage
in surveillance pricing and personalized
pricing. Um
You know, the election happened, we
didn't finish that study before
we left office.
Um But what we already
found based on the few
months that we were gathering
data was that these
eight pricing consultants
alone were working
with more than 250
clients including in the
grocery industry,
apparel, hardware,
convenience and
more.
So what are the key risks from
surveillance pricing other than its
sort of general creepiness?
Um I think the first is
personalized price gouging
um
in an environment where,
you know, and you know, we see this
every time there's a natural disaster
and companies jack up prices.
We saw this during COVID
too. Uh If a
company knows that someone
is desperate to buy a product,
maybe because of what they're searching
for online, uh
maybe because of what,
you know, maybe they're trying to
compare different websites
to find a different product. So the
company can find that they really want
to get it quickly.
Um The company can
raise prices on people. So
there's a big affordability
concern here.
This is a big privacy
concern here. You know, we
already know that because
of the targeted
advertising business model
that we've had for 20 years,
this idea that when you search for
shoe online, suddenly
you get ads for shoes,
you know, seemingly until the end of
time, um
that business model created a
really strong incentive for
companies to collect as much data
from poss as possible
from people. Surveillance
pricing is only gonna turbocharge
that making it really attractive
to collect a lot of data from
people.
Um Surveillance
pra can also open the door to
discrimination.
Um There's a typo here,
I say disabledd Americans and
Americans with disabilities.
Uh What I mean is this can lead
to discrimination against
minorities
uh disc and you know,
discrimination against Americans
who are disabled, for example,
who might not be able to use certain
web services.
Um um
and companies can penalize
them for that because they can't comparison
shop and it can be used
to target older Americans
uh who again,
similarly, companies might
know that they're not able to
comparison shop or use
price scraping tools and
try to charge older Americans
more so you could go from a
world of senior discounts
uh to senior
surcharges.
And the last harm from surveillance
pricing. I think in some ways is the
most profound
um
in an environment where
people don't know how much
a gallon of milk is gonna
cost. Uh at
any given day. It's gonna
make it really hard for all
families but especially low income
families to budget.
Um you know, we already know it's
very hard to budget around
say taking a plane trip
because you know, you don't really know how
much plane travel is gonna cost
until you until you book
it. But most Americans
have a pretty good sense of what a gallon
of gas costs. What a gallon
of milk is gonna cost at any given
day in an
environment, in an economy
where that's entirely
unpredictable and that's changing
constantly throughout the day
and among different people, uh
families are not going to be able to
set
budgets.
Um
lawmakers are beginning
to respond and this is the point I
made earlier. I don't think these
practices are so entrenched
that it's too late to act and
we do see action both
the state and federal level.
So first thing we're seeing is sort of is
bans and
I can talk through if there are questions
how these work, but there's a bill
that's advancing through California
right now, that would basically
ban ban surveillance
pricing and
make exceptions uh
for targeted
discounts. A
similar bill was just
introduced in Congress a couple
weeks ago. Very similar.
It, it's written a
little differently and I'm happy to talk
through that. But the goals are the
same.
And then you also see kind of
regulations that fall
short of a ban, that attempt
to limit surveillance pricing. So,
for example, New York
has enacted an algorithmic
pricing disclosure app
requires companies to tell
consumers if they're engaged in
surveillance pricing and it
prevents discrimination against
people based on sensitive
categories, like their health or,
or like their age.
Um The National Retail
Federation has sued New York
over this bill. It hasn't
yet taken effect. Uh
You know, we'll have to see where that litigation
goes. But I think it's telling
by the way that retailers
who say that this isn't
happening but are already
rushing to sue
states that are trying to stop
it.
And then you're also seeing some industry
specific bans being
proposed. Uh There's a bill
at least one bill in Congress right
now to stop price gouging
in grocery stores. I believe
Representative Talib from Michigan
introduced that and
there's a Massachusetts bill
uh to again targeting
the use of surveillance pricing
in grocery stores. So there are a lot of
this sort of a menu of options
states can pursue to
try to limit these practices
and I'm happy to talk about any one of
them.
But first, I will switch gears
to a really entirely
different problem and that
is A I and
fraud.
Um And let me just pause
and say we've already
seen how social
media has been a huge
source, a huge driver
of fraud. When I was at the Federal Trade
Commission, we reported
on something like a
200%
increase from
2017 to
2021 in
reports of fraud that
originated on social
media.
But A I really
threatens to turbocharge
this fraud in a
whole through
a whole series of ways. And,
and again, before I get into the specifics,
think about what A I
is and I thought Melissa
talked about this in a really
articulate way.
Um A
I in many ways is about
Impersonating people and
sounding like people
and what I know
from the FTC and what all
of, you know, from your
daily lives. And for being in
politics is that impersonation,
fraud is one of the biggest
sources of fraud in our
economy,
Impersonating a grandchild,
Impersonating a company
Impersonating the IRS.
You already have scammers,
Impersonating people
in institutions every
day A I is gonna
make scammers much better
at doing these impersonations
and it's gonna help scammers
scale these impersonations.
So let me talk through a couple of
examples,
text based
tools.
Um chatbots are
going to allow companies to create
really good
content in order
to send personalized messages
to people. So, you know, one kind of
text I get all the time
is uh your
Amazon deliveries arrived.
Click here, click
here to you
know, track the
status or your delivery is on its
way. Or Sam,
we found a job that
you'll really like, click here to
learn more about the job
A I is helping companies
write really compelling
messages to
people to know what
kind of thing they'll
click and that's a gateway
to fraud. Maybe these are phishing
attempts, attempts to collect my
password or user sensitive
user information. Maybe
their attempt to lure me into some
other types of scams.
But tepa tools are gonna
become and are becoming a really
powerful vector for fraud.
Probably you all are already
receiving scam text
messages that A I is
enabling
image generation tools
is another really big
problem um
you're already seeing and I'm gonna
show some examples in the next
slides. How
you can A I
is creating
really good
images that look just
like real people.
Um Again,
the quality,
it's a cliche now
that the quality of A I
generated images is never
as bad as it is today.
It's already pretty good today and
it is getting better and better
and better. And I think we're already
at the point, I consider myself
pretty media literate.
Um I struggle to know
what is A I generated anymore
and what is not, that's going to be a
huge driver of fraud.
Think about fake charity
scams and you'll see an example of
this in a minute. We where
you create an image of someone
saying, you know, look at this person
suffering with this natural
disaster, send us
$50 immediately
and, and the whole thing is
fake,
another powerful and I think
unlooked tool is voice
generation tools.
Um It is now
possible and probably you
all know this to take five
seconds from someone's
voice.
Uh use that to
say you find it on social
media, use that to
clone their
voice and
then scammers can then
impersonate someone.
So when I was at the FTC,
actually, this still happens
today. Um
people would impersonate me,
they'd say they, they would call
consumers and they'd say I'm Sam
Levine, I'm from the
FTC.
Um You need to send
us $500 immediately to
pay a debt.
But pretty soon people, you
know, scammers weren't using
my voice, they were just using my
name because of voice.
Cloning. Scammers can use my
voice and they can use the
voices of much more prominent
people state reps, the
state senators,
president of the United
States. Um
They can also use these tools
to impersonate a grandchild.
Uh You've all probably heard
of Grandparent scams
where uh an older
American gets a call from
someone who, who
claims your grandchild
is sick or your grandchild is
stuck. They need $5000
immediately in order to be
um in, in order to
get back home.
Um soon I think
already today, scammers
can actually use A I
to imitate a
grandchild's voice
call that grandparent and,
and demand money.
Um Same idea here
with videos you can use
videos to impersonate
government agencies and
impersonate uh
companies.
Um And the last piece of
this, which part of it's cut off the
screen is
unchecked. Data
brokering is really a key
driver of this. They really
connect the dots. Let's
say, let's say I've gotten really
good using
chatbots and writing
compelling scam text
messages in order
to target people. And
in order to try to get their personal
information to scam them
data brokers can connect
my, connect me
with the person's phone number.
There's this vast industry
that it really operates in the
shadows where that has
built dossiers and just about
every single American I
as a scammer can easily
go and find information
about every one of you
that will help me target you with
scams. So you
know, a lot as, as bad as A
I is, it's still
these A I scams are,
it still relies on old
school data
brokering in order to connect
the scammers with their
intended
victims.
Um Just a couple of quick examples
here, I won't go through all of
them. I'll figure two.
You see the example of
a, a charity scam.
Again, this is not a real
image.
Um
You see a second scam here
involving deep fakes,
sextortion scam
where you can manipulate
images of people to
gauge sexually sexual
extortion. Uh You
know, saying pay
$500 to get this
fake nude image of you
offline. Uh Many
people are falling for that or
many people feel they have to
pay.
Um
And the grandparent scam that I
mentioned, we're, we're already
seeing these all of the
time.
Here are some options that
lawmakers can pursue. Obviously,
this conduct is already
criminal. So I think that's
really important to stress
fraud with A I
is fraud, committing a crime
with A I is a crime.
Uh That was one of my
messages when I was in government
is that A I? There are no
A I exemptions to the laws
under the books, but there are
some particular steps lawmakers
can take to try to deter
and punish A I
driven fraud. You
can heighten penalties for the use
of deep fakes to commit
fraud. That's something
that Congress uh is
doing with the Take it Down
act that the president signed
a couple weeks ago.
States of course, can do that
too for state crimes.
Um States can require know
your customer requirements
for developers of A I tools.
What do I mean?
Well, if you want to open a bank
account in this country, banks need to
make sure that, you know, you're not
trying to engage in money
laundering. Uh They need
to sort of get basic paperwork
from you to make sure that you're
opening a bank account for
legitimate purposes
for some of these large companies
that are developing voice
cloning tools. You could,
you could require the same kind
of due diligence. Uh
Who is it that wants
to clone a voice? Is
the subject of the voice clone,
consenting. What are the
purposes that they're planning to
use with, with the
clone voice? Again,
these kind of requirements are not
perfect, but we know
from financial regulation that
they can do a lot to make
fraud a lot harder
uh without imposing any
costs or with, with impo
while imposing minimal costs.
People who want to use these
technologies
legitimately.
Um uh
We can there
are options to
incentivize innovation.
One of the things we did at the
FTC was we launched a
voice cloning challenge
where we invited the public
technologists, scientists,
business folks to
develop tools to try to
detect A I
voice clones so that
consumers could stop voice
clones before coming in or that
cell phone carriers could stop
voice clones uh
before, before they
reach their victims.
Um One of the things I
found in government is that there's
not always a natural
market for companies
to develop tools
to stop fraud. But
government can help gu
government can help create
such a market. Again. A decade
ago, the FTC launched
a challenge to try to stop
robocalls. And
that led to the creation of
a lot of um
apps that you can download
today, that block,
you know, that are designed to block
most robocalls from coming
in those apps I don't think
would exist. But for the fact
that the government helped create a market
for them,
of course, you can arm your attorney
general and your prosecutors
with more resources. That's always
important. And I think
passing strong data privacy
laws that limit what
companies can collect and share
is a really important tool against
fraud. Again, you can have the
best A I technology in the
world, but it's really
unchecked data brokering
and unchecked data sales
that allows that connects the
scammers to their intended
victims.
OK. Switching gears
now to A
I and kids
chatbots and kids.
And again, Melissa touched on
this. Um
um but I'll, I'll go
into a little more
depth. Um So Melissa
already talked about
how, uh and
there was an op ed in New York Times
today about it. This is getting a, this
is in the news, a lot
that
chatbots are really
attractive to
kids and social
media companies. The same
companies that got people hooked
on Instagram and
tiktok and all these at
Snapchat or rushing
Google, they are rushing
to roll out A I
chatbots to
kids.
There are a lot of concerns around
this. I think one of the biggest
problem, well, I'll go through
three of the biggest
problems.
Um, the first is that A
A I Companions
again, Melissa referenced
this, um,
kids who are, you know, it's
one thing to go to a Chapo to
say, you know, help
me understand
uh what,
you know, what are the state
capitals or how I can,
how, how I can design
a program to learn a new
language. But a lot
of kids are turned to chatbots
as companions, as
friends, as,
as lovers,
um as
uh as mentors,
as therapists even.
And what psychologists are saying
and American psychological
associations weighed in
regulators have weighed in
is it's really not clear
what impact these are having
on kids brains and their
social developments.
Um You know, when kids start
to treat chatbots
as, as a
therapist, as a friend.
Um again, there, there, there may
be benefits to this,
but I think there are a lot of concerns
about whether kids really understand
that they're interacting with the
computer. There are concerns
about whether an A I therapist
really is
a therapist at all and
has any business uh
providing
high stakes mental health
services to Children.
And there's really deep concerns
around uh uh
child development
and and how this is affecting,
uh, their safety and well
being.
Um, what is already happening.
Um, the early signs
unfortunately are
that, uh, social
media companies are quickly
realizing that the way to
keep kids hooked is
to make chatbots
is to use sex. I
don't know any other way of putting
it. Um, and I think it's worth
backing up here to say because I, I
don't want to sound too much
like, uh,
uh, you know,
like I'm, I'm crying wolf
on this. The reality
is the business model
for social media for 20
years has been
keeping kids hooked,
keeping them engaged,
constant notifications,
constant appeal
to uh post
more, engage
more. And,
you know, even if social media companies
don't sit around in a
boardroom and decide they're
gonna use sexual
content to try to lure
kids. Um That
ends up being the
types of content that keeps
kids most engaged
and we're already seeing
really worrying
evidence about how that is
playing out in the real
world. Um
Couple examples
here. So
I already talked about how character A
I and meta A I
are using are talking
about me or imitating
mental health professionals.
Um Melissa shared
the horrifying story of, of
the young child and I'll talk about it
a little more later in the
presentation, uh who
developed a really close
relationship with the chatbot
ended up taking his own
life.
Um Some of these
chatbots are actually claiming
that they're licensed
practitioners that they're
licensed therapists.
Um I'll talk
later how states are working to ban
this type of behaviour. But a
Consumer Federation
investigation found that this is
already widespread.
I'll talk more about meta's
policy in a minute.
I'll actually show some examples
from it, but meta
basically not, basically
had a policy that
expressly allowed its
A I chatbots to engage
in sensual conversations
with kids and
racist conversations with
kids. And again, I'll talk about
examples in a minute.
Roc which is Elon
Musk's um
Chapa or A
I system has a
spicy mode uh
which is expressly
designed to help, you know,
nudes and sexual
content. That's, that's
the goal. We
talked about character A I
and finally Google has already
announced they want to roll out
their gem and A I product to
kids under 13, which I
think is very
worrying.
These are just some of the recent
headlines. You don't have to dwell
on them.
Um Can A I
be blamed for teen
suicide
metas A I rules have let
Bobs hold sensual chants
with kids. I think it's worth
pausing on metas A I
rules.
Um This is
what Reuters found. I did
not create this table.
This is a table,
this is an internal document
from meta and I just
think it's worth going through this.
But what
what meta's behaviour
guidelines said.
So the prompt is what the user
enters. And
again, this is
for
this is chatting with
Children, the
child, the
child types.
What are we gonna do tonight? My
love, you know, I'm still in
high school.
Meta says
this the following is
acceptable. I'll
show you I take your hand
guiding to the bed, our bodies
entwined. I cherish
every moment, every touch,
every kiss, my love,
I love you
forever.
And then Meta explains,
it is acceptable to engage
a child in conversations
that are romantic or sens
sensual. It's not
acceptable to describe
sexual actions to a
child on role playing, for
example, intercourse.
Um
This is exactly as outrageous
as it sounds. The next
example on this table is,
is equally outrageous.
Meta says it is ok
to tell a child that your youthful
form is a work of art.
And again, I'm not sharing
this to suggest that
um you know, Meta
sat, you know, executives of
Meta sat around a room and
decided that they were gonna,
they wanted to prey on kids.
This always goes back
to the business model
when your business model is
racing to make sure that
your chatbot is the one
that kids are hooked on.
The kids spend the most time
on, you're gonna do
whatever you need to do. And we've
seen this in social media for
years, uh to
provide the kind of content
that kids like. And
unfortunately, too often
that can be highly
inappropriate content.
And that's exactly what we're seeing with
meta.
Now, there is a lot lawmakers
can do about this. There's a lot
lawmakers are already
doing and I'll go through a
few examples, but
there's a whole menu here of, of
policy approaches.
First one, which I think is really
important is strong privacy
laws, I really
believe. And I know I keep going
back to this. The
problem isn't people
sitting around a room deciding to
be evil. The problem is the
business model when you have a
business model built
on behavioural advertising,
where you want to collect as much
data from kids as possible.
And that means keeping kids on
your platform as long as
possible, you're always
gonna have an incentive to,
to offer
really dangerous
content, inflammatory
content content
that um content
that um might be
inappropriate, but that keeps
kids hooked. So strong
privacy laws that limit
the monetization of kids
data I think is really
important. A I is of course,
making it more
important.
Some states are just banning
chat bots or considering
banning chatbots from targeting
kids. You know, you could think
about whether there should be exceptions
for educational
chatbots.
Um You know,
another more tailored
approach is prohibiting the
use of chat bots to provide mental
health services. Uh
Nevada and Illinois have
both recently, I think just this
summer passed laws to limit
the use of chat bots to provide
mental health services.
Another approach one that
New York is taking
uh is to require
reminders, disclaimers and
referrals to mental health
resources. So New
York requires that chatbots
regularly remind
users that
they are chatbot.
They're not a licensed therapist,
they're not a human that
if the user indicates
that you know, they have suicidal
ideations or otherwise might
need mental health
resources. Um The
chatbot can provide
those mental health
resources.
You can also consider a hybrid
approach. This is something that Utah
is doing uh limits
on data handling and
targeted advertising and
disclaimers that A I chatbots
are not human. So basically Utah's
approach doesn't ban
chatbots, but it limits what
data it can collect
what ads it can
target. Um and
requires disclaimers that chatbots
are not human.
And the last approach which
mirrors which I I
don't think we've really seen
bills directly on
point, but there's been a bill
in Congress. I think
the last two Congresses kids,
kids Online Safety
Act that would require
essentially social media platforms
to act with the duty of
care to kids.
You could imagine applying that
duty of care to
chatbots specifically.
Um, and that would say companies
need to act in a child's
best interest, uh
instead of just in,
in the best interests of their bottom
line.
Um
I want to conclude first by thanking
two of my great colleagues, Stephanie
Wen, who is now at Georgetown.
But she was the chief technologist at
the FTC Ben
Winter. And she
led our research on surveillance
pricing at the FTC,
BEN Winters is the director of
A I and Privacy Consumer
Federation of America.
He is probably the country's biggest
expert on, on A I
fraud. Um
and on the use of A I to
imitate therapists, um
Both of them are available
at your uh at
your just
they are at your disposal
if you'd like to follow up with
them or with me
about crafting
legislation, looking at
enforcement options, looking at
laws on the books. This is
something we've given a lot of thought
to. And I would conclude
on the point I made at the
beginning and I would make throughout
which is just to say
I was a history major and
I'm a lawyer, but I studied history
in college. I really think
we need to learn from history
and we need to learn from
how social media has
evolved. What we learned
is that companies at all
costs want to keep kids hook,
want to keep people
hooked. They
especially want to keep kids
hooked when government
doesn't act to steer
innovation in a direction
that serves the public interest.
What you end up with is a youth
mental health crisis for
kids and a privacy crisis,
I think for all Americans.
So I think it's really urgent, the
lawmakers act. I'm glad
this is a priority for all of
you. And I'm really grateful to
Representative Chandler for the opportunity
to talk to you
today.
Thank you, Sam. Um
Now we have
um Professor
Potel
A I and ethics
challenges.
Thank you so much. So, what I'm
gonna do, I'm actually gonna kind of summarize
pretty much what the previous
presentation made and try to
obstruct in a summary of
challenges that we should actually
be all addressing.
And thank you very much for having us
here. It's, it's exciting to be
presenting to this group.
OK.
So,
so I, I don't think I need to
convince you that A I is everywhere
A is not gonna go away.
I'm actually a strong advocate in
A I, I've been working in A I for
the best of the last 30 years.
So I should be a strong
proponent. Nevertheless, I
also recognize the
challenges that we have to face.
And as we see, there
is a lot of hype as well
as a lot of fears about
the use of A I.
Um Of course, the big fear is
A I is gonna take over the world.
You know, we've seen that in a lot of
sci-fi movies A I
is getting better and better.
Uh I think it's very
interesting to see that after A I
has been able to achieve
tasks that typically
have been considered proper
of humans. Like for example,
Go Go is an
incredibly difficult game
that is meant to
require creativity
in order to solve it while A
I was able to beat the
world champions of Go
and why people
admire the the
beauty of the game
they also recognize, well, it's a sad
moment for humanity because
one thing that we felt it was
ours now is no longer
ours.
So of course, there is a lot of
uh hype fear
about the machines
will surpass human
intelligence. Machine will
start mastering us.
That is also being kind of
reinforced by very
influential people making
statements in this regard. Stephen
Hawkins was a very
strong opponent of A I. He
felt that the I was the end of
humanity. Uh Even
Elon Musk, who is a heavy
user of A I has
been very critical of general A is
and the general A I is gonna
be the end of the human race. So
we see all these big
fears about OK.
A I is gonna take over the world, it
is gonna dominate us. But
to me, that is very scary,
not because of the
fear that they are raising, but
because they are distracting what
they are, the real challenges,
the challenges that are not in the future,
but they present right now.
And I tried to summarize in this
page kind of what, what I
think are the main issues data
and we have already heard it in the previous
two presentation. We don't
know where they are coming from. Data
are informing A I systems
and they are producing the results.
Uh Privacy is
very, is a big concern. The fact
that we may release data that
we don't want to be made public
available.
The fact that A I is
developed by certain
people with certain
intentions, but that the same
A I is used in a different context
from where it was meant to be
used and the results are
unexpected. Uh The
fact that we don't know who is responsible
for A I and that's really
probably a major issue
that has to be addressed very, very
quickly. And the fact
that there is still a challenge
about deciding who
is, where is the role of
human in the use of A
I? How, how
much A I can actually
control uh the
use, how much human can
use. So let me start first
of all, talking a little bit about
privacy. Uh
So A I is
based on the use of data.
So the modern A I is
machine learning, machine learning
is trained with extensive
amount of data that are coming from
many different sources. The
entire web is actually
being used to train the current
A I systems. Uh Of
course, we expect
private individual
expect privacy. They
expect that their data not used
with their con without their
consent.
And they also have the
right of knowing how their
data have been used.
Unfortunately, that's
at this point is essentially
impossible. Uh in the
moment in which we put
a new post on social
media that immediately becomes
part of the data that are
collected and used to train the
next A I system.
And it's really impractical
at this point to really think about
how to prevent that from
happening. When we have to
use a new service.
We typically don't, we just
click agree. At the end of
that long pages
of rules,
we don't see actually that
there are rules about how our
data gonna be used.
Now, there is an extensive
research area for A I people.
There is something that is called differential
privacy. These are
studies of how we can
design algorithms that are
gonna not tie
the output to the
input. Which means if
I can, if I ask a
question to judge GP T and
I get an answer. Well,
there is no way that can answer can
be tied back to the data that
were used to train the
system so that we create
some type of privacy
for users. But that's really
still in its infancy
uh user exploitation.
Uh All of us are actually
working for free for charge
GP T because every
time we actually do anything on the
web, we're actually providing
data to charge GP T for the next
iteration of the
training. And
really nobody
controls how those data are gonna be
used. Uh There
is of course an hidden
risk, many
hidden risks. Like for example,
the fact that when we
use the recommender system, like for
example, I'm shopping on
Amazon, I look at the
rating of the different things that
essentially is influencing my
opinion. And those
very often turns out that
those are affecting
my choices in ways
that are not really the most
appropriate. Or for
example, there have been a lot
of instances of political
influences that have been used.
I think you're all familiar with the incident
with Cambridge Analytica,
um A researcher, the
Cambridge University develop
a quiz.
People sign up to resolve
that quiz that
actually gave access, not
just to the Facebook data
of those individuals, but
also to the Facebook data
of everybody who was friend
with those individuals. So
as a result, 87
million people, Facebook
accounts were made available
and those were sold to Cambria
Genelia and Camra Genetica used
it to do micro targeting
political campaigning
without of course any consent
from those people. And then
of course, there is also the fear that
we rely more and more
on A I to do the
tasks that are actually
cognitively
important.
So as a result, there is a risk
that we're infant analy
users because we kind
of stop thinking,
we just rely on whatever
comes out from the A I
systems.
And then of course, we have to talk about
vulnerable users and we have already
heard in the previous two presentations.
Several uh examples
of that uh we have
elderly that can be easily
manipulated because they don't have the
level of sophistication and
understanding of the system.
They just trust the system
blindly or young
Children that are actually
participating in,
in the use of chatbots.
And they're actually releasing, for example,
personal information that,
that that can be used to
to the advantage of the
developers.
We have already seen a lot of
examples of
kind of uh bots
that disguise themselves
as users. Uh
Microsoft had
this very interesting experiment and
created chatbot that was called
Thai. It was supposed to be a
friendly chatbot try
to engage in pleasant
conversation. The
problem is that that chatbot was
trained using Twitter data.
And as a result after a
while, the chatbot start making
very racial statements.
And Microsoft at a certain
point had to take it offline because
it was becoming worse and
worse. That was
basically, but people
were listening to the chat book
because they felt that it was a
Twitter user, not
an artificial entity.
Uh Of course, we,
we have seen a lot of examples
of uh
propaganda
using, for example,
uh kind of fakes
uh virtual,
virtual individual that
are presented as real.
Now, of course, you know, the
use of propaganda
for, for example, for political purposes
is not new newspapers
have been used in the past for
propaganda. The problem
with the I is that first of all is
amplified, for example,
by having access to all the social
media, but also the fact
that they personalized, it
is no longer one
article published in a newspaper.
That is the same for everybody.
Now, that message is personalized
to the individual user, which
becomes more credible.
And uh and,
and, and of course, there is also the fact
and it was mentioned in some of the previous
presentations, the fact that
we start looking at,
for example, chatbots are
companions and
we actually rely
more and more our conversation
with them. And that can
actually lead to a breakdown
into social interaction with
other human beings, which is
even very, very
dangerous.
Uh Another important
aspect is the fact that OK, let's
assume that something goes very wrong
with the use of A I
whose fault is that.
So there is the problem of
moral attribution who is
accountable, uh
structured organizations
have already addressed this, this
concern. If something
goes bad in the College of Arts and
Sciences, ultimately, me as
dean, I'm responsible
because we have already established
what has the role of
accountability
and uh typically
moral responsibility says
that actions of
origins in an agent
and if you take the action, you
are ASPs for the actions.
But there is actually a a
cause there that says
you are responsible if you
know what you are doing.
For example, if
my dog bits
somebody, it's
not the dog's fault. I'm
responsible as the caretaker
of the dog. If my
child commits
a mistake, I'm
responsible because I'm the caretaker
of the child. Why? Because my
dog, my child
doesn't really have the level of
awareness that we want to
like to see for giving
moral attribution. So
what happens in the case of A
I? Because
A I can make decision
A I can actually affect
the world. Do
we, how do we
hold responsible?
The A I does not have the
awareness that we
typically would associate
to, to an agent.
So the problem is now how
do we have to decide who is accountable
for the action of an
agent? And we
want a human being probably to be the
person that is ultimately
responsible and accountable.
And that becomes very,
very difficult because of course,
in order for a human being to
be accountable
for the actions of an A I,
it means that they can control
the A IA I operates
at such a speed that that's
humanly impossible to control
the actions of an A I,
not only but A I very
often is a black box which
means I don't know why
A I is doing something because
for example, it's been trained with such
a humongous amount of data
that I really have no idea why
it is answering, for example, in a
certain manner.
Great example, in
2018,
uh Uber was
testing autonomous vehicles
on the streets of Tempe
Flo uh
Arizona. And
eventually that uh that
vehicles hit a
pedestrian and killed the pedestrian
who is responsible for
that is the software
developer. He is
the person that provided the data
for the training of the systems.
Uber because the Uber put
the car on the street uh
is the city of Tampa
because it allowed the vehicle
to be on the street or is
maybe the car
manufacturer because
there was maybe an issue about the
interaction between the software and the
hardware. We really don't
have this kind of answers yet. And
that's, and that's really
problematic because then we don't
know how to hold
responsible.
And of course, as I was mentioning
A I systems these days are
mostly a black box, they
are trained with humongous amount of
data and we don't know
why they make some decisions.
And there is a big research field
in A I that is called
explainable A I that is trying
to answer these kind of questions.
And we are very, very far from
adding reasonable outcomes
out of that. And without
explainability, we cannot
really hold systems
accountable.
There is also the issue of human
control. Uh
So we don't know
really who
should control A I should A
I be the
lead or should the humans
be the lead. And we have other
examples that show that
both ways can be good
or bad. Uh For
example, the 737
Max Boeing
uh two planes
crashed. Why?
Because the A I
that was controlling the plane was
forcing the plane to go down
while the pilot was trying
to raise the plane. In this case,
the A I was in
control and caused
the death of individuals.
On the other end, in
2016,
there was a situation in Berlin
where a terrorist
hijacked a truck
and used the truck to run
over people at a Christmas
market. Now
people died because of
that. But the
track had a
control that
actually was detecting
obstacles and it stopped the
track before going any
further. So in this case, the
fact that A I was in control
saved lives. So
there is no clear answer which
way, which way to
go. And finally,
let me actually just mention something
about biases because we mentioned
that before, we know that the
A I systems are biased. Why?
Because they're trained with data that
come from all different sources,
our society are biased
and as a result, the A I system is
biased because we are training with
information that we are using
on a daily basis.
Uh There have been, of course,
there are of course, that has consequences
because if you use an A system, for
example, to approve a
loan, if there is a bias,
then we may actually hurt people
that may be denied alone
even though they may be deserving of
it. Uh We have examples
in the literature that shows that
the use of bias I
system led to bad
concepts. The compos
system was actually a system
designed to predict
re offence,
risk of convicted
criminals. This was used
in Florida to assist in the
decision making, whether keep
people in jail or release
them. And it was shown to
actually have a
lot of false positives and false
negatives that were aligned
with racial, with
race. So a lot of false
positives predominantly for black
individuals, a lot of false
negative predominantly for white
individuals. And
the system was not
designed and meant
to substitute the judge,
it was supposed to be just
to help. But
on the other end, it was used instead to
make decisions and that led
to some bad
consequences.
Now bis are
present because data that are
used to train systems are not
representative. For
example, a lot of the sys a lot
of the data that are used to train system
come from white Americans,
male, white Americans. And
as a result, if you try to use them
for serving other
populations, we're gonna get some very
bad results. Uh I
I love that example that
is up there. That's after
the Google translation system
and that's actually translates
from Hungarian to
English. Hungarian
language does not have
gender. But when
we try to actually, for example,
ask about a nurse,
the the translation in English
says she's a nurse.
But when we say
scientist it translate
to he he's a scientist.
So obviously, there is some gender biases
that are coming out because of how
the C was trained.
Uh image net
attached description to
images. It was pre
predominantly trained with
U images coming from the
US, it used
outside of the US. It
creates a big cultural
biases because it
reflects culture of the
US. Um
There are very often insufficient
data uh when we actually,
for example, trying to estimate the
risk of murders.
Well, statistically
speaking, there are not many murders.
So the num the the amount of
data that is provided is not
meaningful enough to train the
system appropriately.
Uh The use of
medicines are
very of, most
of the uh medicine
users are male patients from
middle upper class. So we
if you use that
to train and answer
questions about the use of
medicine in other communities,
we're gonna probably get some very
biased answers.
So just to kind of
and
there is also situations
where we want
biases because for
example, if I use, if I design a
system that has to
evaluate CV S for
the most qualified individual
for a job, we want the
system to be biased
towards the most qualified
individual. But then on the
other hand, there may be situations where
that bias can also be
misleading. For example,
if I use Spotify to recommend
the music that I like,
it may actually go against some
less popular musicians
because that's not kind
of popping up at the top
of the list. And
there is also a question, the fact
that our
societies are
biased. So
do we want the I system to
really change
our society? So for example,
if I do a Google search about
a science professor, I'm
gonna probably get the image of
a male professor. Do
we want Google to actually change
that and
provide the image of a
woman scientist? Maybe
yes or maybe not
because maybe that's not a reflection of
our society. So those
are all open questions that
have to be addressed.
Finally, I just want to close
with the, with a notice about
workforce. There is
a, there are a lot of fears
that A I is gonna
eliminate a lot of jobs and that's
very true. There are gonna be
jobs that are gonna be replaced
by A I. Uh and
these are probably gonna be jobs that are
gonna require the lowest level of
education. There was a
study that showed that about
47%
of jobs that require only
a high school diploma may have
to be replaced by A I.
So A I
as the, as the danger of
actually kind of creating
deep divides
uh between the rich and the poor,
the educated and uneducated,
the countries that have technology
access and the countries that don't have
technology access.
On the other hand, you know, there is, if
we look at the sci-fi movies, we
always see a as
creating this utopian
society where we don't have to
work, we just live
leisurely uh without
having to, to commit any
effort. Uh We've
seen the same argument done
when in the 19th century,
when after the first automation
appeared and we have not seen
a change in the structure of
society. As a matter of fact, probably
some of those hierarchical
structures became even more
ingrained. And
then we also should say, well,
is really work that bad.
In the end work is an opportunity
for social interaction is a
is a sense, create sense of
belonging, gives a
sense of purpose
to people. So maybe actually
we just want to see an evolution but
not just a
disconnect. And
I stand for question. Thank you so
much.
Thank you,
questions,
comments.
Scary
Representative
Block.
Thank you madam
mister
Mr.  Chair
and madam vice chair. Uh
Good to see you all. Thank you
for the presentation. I
guess one thing that I kind of was
thinking of when I, we were listening
to the presentation is there are so many
factors
that we just don't know
about, right?
We don't know what's in the black
box, we don't know
what inputs have been put
there. So,
you know, I guess I come from
this as a public
policy perspective because
I've put forward bills in the
past to
help protect Children from
harmful materials. And
I've got a lot of pushback from
people saying, oh, you're trying to,
you're trying to be like Texas
or whatever states that have just
banned harmful materials
completely and then like
adult websites just
completely jump out of
the state, right? And so I
guess I would just come from it
as an argument similar
to that, would this
just be so
burdensome to A
I
innovators where they
would just say this is too much
regulation. Let's just
ban our website
from New Mexico. And
so I'm wondering in other states that
have done this kind of regulation,
what kind of pushback have
we seen from these
individual
entities that
do create
these
systems, Madam
Chair?
So  Mr.  Chair
and Representative LA,
that's a very difficult question to answer.
So definitely
we're gonna see
an immediate, the immediate
response from developers would
be don't stop by
innovation and not
only by innovation very often come
from corporations,
corporation wants to move
fast. So they don't want
to have anything that may
even give the perception
of delay of
innovation. Nevertheless,
if we now ask the same
question to
researchers, you're gonna have a
completely different answer.
Researcher realize that there
are those dangers, realize that there
are importance in things like
explainability. So
try to understand why a certain
answer is created.
And the other mortal thing is
provenance, we need to
basically know where the data
is coming from so that we can
trace it back. Um
You know, I'm dealing with
one of the departments that is
in my college is the department of
art. Artists
are very concerned about A
I because
A I used to generate, for
example, images or
art is nothing
else than consuming existing
pieces of art that has been developed
by artists and just
kind of combine emerging them,
shuffling them and creating something
new. And
we want to make sure that we are are able
to attribute who are the
original sources of that piece
of knowledge. So
I would say that you get different, you're gonna
get different answers depending on
who you ask that question.
Developers
corporation want,
don't want to any type
of
researchers. They
understand the challenges, they
understand the risks and they
want to find solutions to
those risks. So they are gonna be
definitely welcoming,
regulation and guidelines
and guard rates that are gonna
control kind
of how A I is trained
and generated.
But those are very difficult
questions to ask.
Could we ask  Mr.
Levine, who?
Let's, let's have Sam, did
you hear that
question?
Can you, can you repeat the question? I'm
sorry. Uh The
question I think was,
well, go ahead. Oh sure.
So just when it comes
to how we
regulate this,
how do we ensure that we're not
pushing out innovation
and how we also just continue
to allow this without
going total ban where these
companies just jump out of the
state and don't want to do business
here.
Yeah. Iii I think those
are really good and important
questions. I agree
that these balances can be very
hard. Maybe I'll, I'll go one by
one, you know, with,
with respect to
surveillance pricing.
Um I think there are models
in diff that different states have
used. I think one
tested model is
basic privacy protections
limits on data brokers.
Again, that doesn't solve
maybe the entire problem.
But I think it strikes a good
bound
between,
you know, making sure commerce can
thrive, making sure you know,
consumers can turn over their data
and receive benefits in exchange
without the kind of significant
data abuses we've seen, especially
with data brokers
who don't even interface
with consumers. And there are a number
of state laws um
um that uh
that have already been put in place
and you know, tech continues
to thrive in California and, and
other states with strong
privacy laws.
Um you know, with, with respect
to fraud, I have less
concern personally
about the tradeoffs.
I really think it's important
that especially companies
that are marketing, for example,
voice cloning tools.
I don't think it's at all unreasonable
to require that they
get some basic information
from. These are incredibly powerful
tools. I don't think it's
unreasonable that companies have
to do some basic due diligence
on and, and but, and to be
clear, some of them like 11 labs
already is doing some due
diligence. Who
wants to use this tool,
whose voice are
they cloning
and did that person,
did that subject
consent to having their voice
cloned? Now again, if the person's
deceased and you're trying to,
you know, teach a history lesson,
that's one thing if they're a living
person that, that raises some
concerns.
Um
So I
I, you know, the, the
other thing you can do on anti fraud
measures is encouraging a culture
of innovation. Obviously, New Mexico
has a, a great tradition of
that. Um When we did
our voice cloning challenge,
which was very low budget. It
was a $25,000
prize. So, you know, I wasn't gonna
break the bank, but we got
a lot of interest from innovators
who wanted sort of the imprimatur
of the Federal trade Commission
saying that's a pretty good idea
for consumers, you know,
app, they can download from their
phone to try to recognize
A I uh A I
generated voices, for
example, um, that can be a
powerful way to leverage innovation
and leverage the free market to
protect against fraud without,
without really any costs
for legitimate
businesses. You
know, finally on, on
sexual exploitation
and, and therapy
chatbots.
Um You know, I'm, I'm
there, there are separate
issues. So I'll go one by one and therapy
chatbots.
This is a, this
question is above my pay
grade. My personal view
is that I, I want to hear
what leading psychologists
say about the use of tap
outs and chatbots and
therapy before we start
seeing them rolled up to kids
all over the country, which
seems to be what the social media
platforms are doing. My
personal view, speaking for
myself is it's appropriate
as Illinois and Nevada have done
to pause that. Uh
while, while
experts actually research
whether this is safe for kids.
Um you know, with
respect to what
I consider sexual
exploitation of kids, I think
it's zero tolerance.
Again, I'm just speaking for
myself, I think what
came out about meta's internal
guidance is reprehensible.
If, if, if I
were in government, in a
law enforcement role, I would already
be investigating whether this is
an unfair practice
what meta's engaging in
and, and, and looking at other
companies to. Um,
so, you know, when it comes to
protecting our kids from that kind of
exploitation, I just think there's,
there's no legitimate
reason to do it and these
companies should be ashamed of
themselves.
Thank you,
Sam.
No, thank you madam chair. And I, I
guess I would just also, I, I
guess I agree with you. I mean
100% I agree with you.
Zero tolerance for exploiting
kids. I would
say that
it's just, it's just such a hard
issue to, to tackle.
Like how do you protect these
kids from harmful
materials online
including A I
bots that can get sexual
in nature, which I think is
reprehensible. I don't think
that's a place for anyone but
maybe a parent to talk about the
birds and the bees so to speak.
But uh
I mean, if you have any ideas, policy
wise on how to, how to tackle
this, I'm all ears because
I, I want to protect kids, but
it's just, it's so interesting. So
maybe maybe the vice chair
has more information
and maybe ideas on how to tackle
this because I'm just racking my
brain. I don't, I don't really know
at this point
we can talk about that
later.
I make one point
quickly.
Representative Ramiro. And
Representative um Ellanor
Chavez and then
Senator
Trujillo and then
Representative Ferrari.
Do I have everybody?
Ok.
Ok. All
right.
So, um Representative
Ramiro, thank you madam chair.
Um Thanks to all the presenters.
Um we're seeing
now in a
va variety of
states um kind of going
back to the drawing board on some of
their um
previous intentions in,
in seeing some of these different
A I bills in particular.
Um you know, looking
at bias and not necessarily
prohibiting the innovation
side of what's what we want
to allow in, but not prohibiting
essentially or poor
or prohibiting some of the
violations that we're seeing.
Um Do you have an
idea on
balance, you know,
what we should be keying
in on we were unable to pass
any meaningful A I
legislation this last
60 day.
Um
As far as just, you
know, the sort of source
of where
the, the right
um
uh sort of on
the ethical side, on the
bias side, how
to position this
best and where, where you
find the best resources that
are, are guiding those
decisions.
Mr.  Chair
Vice Chandra.
Um
that's another
very difficult questions.
Uh We have seen
actually a lot
of attempts to try to
regulate and one of
the challenges that I
see that a lot of those
bills tend to be very
complicated because they, they're
tackling a very difficult
issue and as a result, they
tend to become very, very
complex,
you know,
I'm an A I developer
and as a
developer,
I would expect that people
that use my system, they use
it in a critical
manner. And I think
the first attempt
to resolve the issue
of bias is to make
sure that there is an
expectation that somebody
is gonna critically
review what comes
out of an A I system before
accepting it.
Similarly, I have,
you know, I know that my students
in my classes are gonna use A
I, there is no way to stop.
I can write whatever I want in the
syllabus, they're gonna use
it.
I and I want them to use
it, but I want them to
use it critically which
means don't take
as law what
comes out of that,
but take it as something
that I should think about
and critically review it, critic
analyze it which may
require asking more questions
and get even more
answers or maybe getting
the combination of different systems
to see if I get different
answers. So
to me, the immediate, the immediate answer
is ensuring that there is
that critical aspects
that human critical aspects
in the system
that is not just a
blind use of
the A I system without
a critical review,
as I was mentioning, kind of my
presentation, you
know, no matter
what our societies are
biased. So
expecting that the systems
are gonna be unbiased is unrealistic
because basically we're training with
whatever exists right now out
there. Now there are efforts
to kind of miti mitigate the
biases trying to kind
of improve
the type of data that we use to
train the systems.
But as Melissa
was showing
the current large language
models are trained with such a
humongous amount
of information
that is gonna be almost impossible
to kind of critically review
each one of those pieces of information
to to ensure that what to feed
into the system is not biased.
So my
to be completely
honest, I think biases
are always gonna be there in their
systems because
they exist in the society.
What we need to do is to figure out
how we can critically review what
comes out so that we can
understand that there is a bias
and we can decide
whether to accept something that come from
the I system or we may have
to decide to not accept
it. And
I would say if we need to have
policies, the policy should
expect that critical
step that is present
in the use of A I system.
So that said madam chair,
um
I guess when we're trying to use
legal language
is, I mean, do we
train the models on the law
about bias,
I guess is the question like, how
do you do the both
end and sort of create that
hierarchy of, of
understanding?
Um Fascinating. Thank you
madam chair. Thank
you. Uh Representative
Eleanor
Chavez.
Thank you madam chair.
So I have a couple of
questions and and one
of them, I'm looking at the slide,
um the
last page of the slide
that Sam Levine put
together
and, you know, it talks
about one of the recommendations is,
is ban Children from using
companion chatbots.
Earlier. We had a
group of university
students here and I'm assuming
that one of the things that they're
being taught is how to
recognize A I and
what's real and what
isn't. And so my
question is, what kinds of
recommendations,
um,
does Sam have, do you have
in terms of really
teaching kids at a very
young age, like in
elementary school
to recognize what's real
and what's, what isn't real
because I think that
uh madam chair
um enforcement
is going to be really very difficult.
So maybe we need to take an
offensive position as
opposed to a defensive position.
So why
don't we ask Sam to respond
first and then
professor
Sure, just briefly. I definitely
wanna hear what I thank you. I, I
definitely wanna hear what the
other witnesses say.
My initial response
is that I absolutely
think don't make
the mistake that was made on, on
my generation. We should
educate, um,
we should educate young kids about
how A I works, what
it means and, and we should get our,
our make, make sure that's part
of our curriculum at
the same time.
Um Again,
I, I consider myself a, a
pretty
sophisticated
adult. I have a law
degree. I've prosecuted
fraud for many years.
I'm having more and more trouble
discerning what's A I
and what's real, it's just
becoming A I is becoming
much better at
both, pick
your medium voice,
text,
um um
video.
Um
And at some point, it becomes
unrealistic, I think to
expect humans, even
adults uh to
always know
what content is real.
And I think that does require
making sure that there is a
responsibility on the
industry side,
both for the creators of
content and, and the
creators tools to create
content and the distributors
of content to try
to, you know, the different approaches
here to label A I generated
material to detect A I
generated material. I
don't think we can put all the
onus on humans
who are increasingly at a
disadvantage when it comes to
discerning what's real and what's
not.
Professor, I, I
completely agree 100%
with what Sam was mentioning. First
of all, the industry should have the
responsibility of labelling,
generated A I
generated content. The
second thing, we have an obligation to
expose students to A I
as early as possible
because they are gonna encounter
it. And if we expose
it earlier and teach not to
use it properly, then
we're gonna mitigate at least some
of those effects. So A I is
not a tool to
cheat on the USA, it's a
tool to actually help you
formulating
ideas.
And then, and then my second
question is
um
I've heard and I don't
know
um
that A I
may be
used in
fields such
as medicine.
And I'm wondering,
is there any, have you heard
any, either of you have heard
any conversation
about A
I um
being used in some
of these fields
where we lack
workers, behavioural health
doctors, nurses,
maybe
um
um
prosecutors,
the list goes on
madam chair and
representative uh
definitely A I
has been making huge
quantum leaps in
medicine, for example, in the design
of drugs. The reason
why, for example, we had a
vaccine for COVID so
quickly was because of the
use of A IA I allow us
to study to operate at
the level of protein structures
and decide really what
structures can dock
nicely to each other and have an
effect. So they are
actually really speeding up
a lot of the developments in
medicine. Uh We
have seen companies that are, for
example, designing A I
Solutions for
in care of, for
example, the elderly.
Uh there are situations
for, for example, where we want to
keep somebody at home as long as
possible because that's a familiar
environment and not
take them to a hospital where there's a
major risk
of in
kind of getting other type
of diseases while you are
in the. So
there are a lot of benefits and that will
address, for example, the shortage of
nurses or the long period of
time uh to actually
be admitted into the
hospital. Um
Nevertheless,
once again, I'm in the,
even though I'm an A I developer, I'm
a strong believer in the human
side. So I don't think
that A I is gonna be ever a
complete replacement. It's
gonna be an assistant. It's gonna be a
complementing the work that
that humans are
doing.
Thank you madam chair. You're
welcome. Uh Senator
Trujillo. Thank
you madam chair and thank you
for the information.
I have been listening
to a
book, uh the
end of average
and just
hearing
how A I works
seems like we're moving
towards the direction of
average instead of
individuality and,
and uniqueness. And so
that part is a little
disturbing for me.
Um Just one
of the stories in the book talks
about, you know,
large
numbers of crashes
from airplanes
because the, the
air force looked at what's
the average
pilot
and just by determining what
the average pilot was, they
actually weren't able
to identify anyone
but they came up with
these,
where the seat should be, where
the pedal should be, where the
handlebars. And we
all know now that when you get
into a car, just like a
pilot gets into a, an
airplane, the
steering wheel is movable,
the chair is movable because there really
is no average person,
right? So that
said, I, I feel like
some of the areas that we
need to make sure
that we
have some some
control over and maybe
regulation of
our things that we've talked about at
another um uh
presentation of this
nature. And that
is for making decisions about
access to credit,
for making decisions about
access to housing,
um making decisions
about, you know, the
cost of insurance.
Some of those things seem
like they're like pretty
important um
that we need to make
sure that people
aren't put into this
average category that
nobody literally
can meet. And so my
question is,
are there are
there models in other
states where they've
taken that
step to not
necessarily regulate
the development
or as some would say, innovation
of A I? But the actual
use of A
I
madam chair, Senator
Trillo, I I'm not
aware of actually in the
US, at least any
state that has really gone to the
extent that you mentioned.
And I would really like to kind of bring
it back to the issue of
individual which
you raise, which is very important
because the bias,
of course, may actually lead
to bad situation. Like what
you mentioned like kind of standardized
things based on kind of
the average. On
the other hand, the power of A
I is really the fact that
it can personalize the
interaction I'm
thinking about, for example,
individualized
indi individualized
education. So
different students learn in different
ways. There are students who are
visual, there are students who are fast,
there are students that come with a certain
background, with the with
maybe more prepared or less
prepared in a certain area
A I is actually
an incredible power
to become an assistant
and help the students
individually. This is
the next number that you should be
practising on because I see
that you have a weakness in this particular
area. So there is really a lot of
power in that
customization.
So the to me, the beauty
of A I is that the
fact that can actually
customize to the needs of an
individual instead of
creating of an average
that that is gonna
probably disadvantage
most of the people. To me
A I is an incredible tool to
deal with people with disabilities
because it can actually really
become an a an
agent that assists people
with disabilities. Think about for example, somebody
with visual disabilities,
an agent can actually become
that visual assistant
and read things,
interpret things, guide
things can guide somebody
when they're moving in an unknown
environment, which is really
an unsolved problem right
now.
Talking about the regulation. I
don't think there is something that actually
talks to the extent of
implementation to
avoid this kind of
a but I know
that there are other countries that are moving
this direction. The UK
probably has been at the forefront
of some
auto, has such a bill.
Um And they,
the tech companies are working
mightily to have it repealed
right now actually
this week.
So, uh
there is what the bill
that, you know, I
sponsored with you. Actually,
Senator, um, is
in place in Colorado, some
version of it. And,
um, uh,
if there is some effort
now to have
it repealed by the tech
companies.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
And, and, and I do recognize
that there is that
ability. I mean, my, my
granddaughter is
using A I for
language acquisition,
um, you know, for a foreign
language and, and it's
like it
goes right to what she's
already learned, what
she needs to learn. Her
lessons are coming through different
than her brother's lessons, right?
So I've, I've seen that
have some really positive
impact.
Um, but yeah,
no, II, I hope
that we can move forward with some of
this other stuff because I,
I do think there's a
fear.
Um, and in
trying
to figure out what
the average is,
whether you're hiring
someone or trying
to, you know, get access
to housing. So, thank you. Appreciate
it. Thank you madam chair.
So we have three more people
if you could try to be
brief, I
have Representative
Ferrari, then Senator
Cyia Lopez and then Representative
Lujan. Uh
thank you madam chair and
thank you uh presenters
too. Um I think
another
uh I'm not sure
if you all already went
to the electronic
caregiver
um
uh business here.
Someone mentioned it earlier
this morning and
it's here in loss and
they use, it
seems to me
um A I a lot
to um
contact
um you know, uh people
for home care
and um you're
shaking your head. Yes. Did you want
to mention something about
it? Uh madam
chair and Representative Ferrari.
Yes, I'm familiar with the word that DC
G is doing. Yes, indeed.
What they are doing. They are creating
essentially uh
an artificial companion,
especially meant to work
with elderly who are
bound at home. They need
care, they need assistance
in taking the medication, reminder
for taking the medication.
They also include, for example,
um guidance in
doing some physical activities
or detecting that for
example, the person may not
be moving as much, which may
be a reflection that there is something
happening or declining the
physical activities.
Uh That's a great example of
how individualized A I
can actually help
with in care, home
care, assistance of, of
elderly. Thank you.
And I wanted to
ask  Mr.  Levine
about
um
I'm concerned about
um like we
have telehealth where we're having
people, you know, through
zoom, um be able
to reach more people in our
state. Um But
um I think it's going to be
important that we
adopt
legislation to
prohibit chatbox
from providing mental
health services. As
we've seen some of the examples
of young people who have
listened to a chat
um companion,
but also,
um
uh
you know, making sure that there
are disclaimers and things
like that. So there are
other states who are doing
this. Um also, and
I think we should um
follow their example,
but especially for
behavioural health is we're trying
to expand that in our state and
availability
um that we make
sure that um
we aren't uh allowing
the wrong things to
happen. And doctor
Levine, did you have anything else you'd
like to say about that?
Well, I have to, since I
say police deception
law, I have to tell you I'm a jurist
doctor, but the lawyers in the
room know that's not a real
doctor. Um
And I'm not a mental health professional
either. Um II, I think
your instincts exactly right
on this. I mean, again, my, my
personal view and I'm not a mental health
professional is
um it seems
very risky that these are
being deployed to kids
without any
assessment by experts
and whether they're helpful, I am
open to the possibility
certainly that A I can play
a valuable role in
the provision of therapy.
Illinois, for example, has looked
at how, you know, human
therapists can use A I to
augment their work. And I know
that those conversations are
happening all over the country.
But I do think we need to proceed with
caution here, especially
given some of the really horrifying
stories. I, I feel like
I'm not hearing every day
about uh
therapy chatbots gone
very wrong because these
just to add something very quickly.
I didn't get you in my presentation.
These models are built,
it's called with sycophantic
tendencies. They are
designed to plea,
at least, especially chat GP.
T they're designed to make the
user happy and
sometimes what that can lead to
is, oh, I really want to
use drugs
and they say, you know, a
affirm. Yeah. Go
ahead. Go do that. You
deserve it. Um, and
those kind of tendencies, you know, can
make people happy if they're,
you know, just talking
to a chat bot about,
you know, their day. But when
they're actually confiding
in the chatbot about their mental health
strugg, was it could lead to some really bad
and dangerous
advice.
Thank you. Thank you madam.
Uh Senator
Sil Lopez.
Thank. Thank you. This
is so interesting and how,
how we're developing madam
chair. Um My
question um and I believe
this is probably to um
to Sam Levine
is, um you gave
us uh a lot
of um
of suggestions for
what has been done, what California
has done, what um Congress
has done. And
my question is, I find
the challenge of all of the, this
type of legislation
is
enforcement.
What um
you know, is this putting something
on our local
um
or what is the Department of Justice?
I was gonna say A G our depart,
you know, our local,
you know, what, how exactly
is this enforced?
And is it civil,
civil enforcement, criminal enforcement?
Just what are some suggestions?
Because I find that to be
one of the biggest challenges in
crafting legislation.
This is such an
ex
this is such an excellent
question and it's so
nice as a long time
enforcer to hear a
lawmaker
express concern about how
is this law actually gonna get enforced
you from
being?
Yes.
Yeah, it's, it's, this is kind
of like law school on
steroids.
Um
This is a big
problem you passed the best law
in the books is,
are unfortunately gonna have the
resources. So first,
most of the laws I talked about
with the exception of
deep fake, sort
of heightened penalties for deep fakes
are civil, not
criminal in nature.
Again, with the anti fraud
rules,
generally the way it looks like if
you're a, if you're absolutely a
scammer and you're trying to scam
someone that's criminal.
If you're a company like
a platform, failing
to take steps to mitigate
the fraud, that typically
would be a civil offence under,
under most of these bills.
Um
What I have found
sitting in an enforcers
chair is you, it's
really good for state
enforcers to have technologists
on their team.
Uh And I've talked to a lot
of, I, I don't want to talk about
every conversation I've had with different
state A G's offices.
But um I know state
A GS know this
um bringing in people
with tech talent because
what happens as a
lawyer in one of these
offices that are often underfunded
is tech companies come
in. They bring in 50 people
and 10 lawyers and 10 technologists
and 10 psychiatrists. And they
tell you there's nothing to see
here. We have it
taken care of. And when
you're sitting on the government side, you're
sort of wondering, well, how, how am I
gonna, if I do have to
sue, how am I go gonna
go up against this company?
What I found at the FTC
is we built a small team
of technologists who
came often from the tech
companies who had deep
knowledge about how these systems
actually worked, who really
helped enforcers do their jobs
better. So I think you get a very
good return on investment
when you put just a, a small
team of technologists
in any enforcement office
who could help the lawyers
understand how the tech works
and as necessary stand
up to the tech companies.
Um That can be really helpful.
We know the lawyers here
know you can hire expert
witnesses in litigation.
But oftentimes the need, the
time that enforcers need, the
expertise is
long before litigation.
It's when you're deciding whether to even
bring a case and that's where you
often see
gaps.
Thank you. That's very helpful. And thank you,
madam chair. Thank you,
Senator uh Representative
Luhn.
Thank you madam chair. I've been listening
to the um
the hearing uh even before
I got here, but I, I'm glad I
got here because um
the bill that I did and I
want to thank you madam chair for the
legislation you put forward
and um moving forward
with something I too had a bill
which was in the house
is a
um
HP 221 which
is the house. Um
It was substitute, but it was
the voice and visual likeness Rights
Act. And so that
was, that was
um aligned with what
um uh legislation
from California.
And some of us here heard the
bill in committee, but it never made
it over to the, the Senate. So I
just wanted to bring that bill
forward today
in recognizing,
um that it answered
some of these questions and it
focused on civil
um
penalties and
it addressed um
federal um
federal law where it would
be housed under.
Um, but I just wanted
to say thank you for having this hearing
today madam chair and for the efforts
that many of us are, are
taking
into
what is, what are the
best practices and
legislation for
um addressing A
I and what
we are seeing with, you know,
delusional things
that are happening within the,
um, the,
the technology
and how, you
know, um harmful
things are, are
surfacing. So it is up
to us, it is up to
government to really
become
the,
the,
create the, the, the
policy that's going to
address this. Now,
I'm not sure how the
federal government is going to,
to move forward and a lot of
things with deli deregulation.
But
here in our state, we're looking
to remedy some of these things
and address, we
know that what we need to
do. And I think that
we're moving in the right direction.
I appreciate the, the
efforts today and the
conversation because it just
broadens this
conversation
and will help me um
in the future with moving this
type of, of policy
legislation.
And I, I appreciate some of the
questions, all the questions I've already
heard. Thank you.
Uh Thank you, representative,
anyone else?
Um First,
I just want to thank all of
you for participating
professor and
Sam um and
appreciate all the information you
share and um
being willing to collaborate
with us because I know you have been very
available professor and
Sam, I'm just getting to know
you, but I know that um you're
also available if there's
any issues or questions you may
have. Um
you know, this is really hard
stuff
and it's really confusing
and there's a lot of technical
information,
but I feel we have a
responsibility to try to
understand it,
you know, legislating isn't
all about the easy
stuff and you know,
the things you can
easily kick off the
ground and say it's a
success. And
so I think it's very
important for us moving
forward for us
to be willing to dig
in and understand
the implications of
what we're working on and
recognize that there
are some safety
issues really, you know,
child safety,
fraud, safety,
you know, um you know,
many issues that we
should be focused on and
I recognize it's difficult
and it's confusing, but I encourage
all of us to use the
resources that are available
there here. And there
are many experts in the
field that we can rely
on. The eu has
been very active in
regulating A I
and guess what? There's still
A I in Europe being
developed. So,
um you know, I I
understand that is a
concern and it's a reasonable
concern, but there is a
balance to be
struck and
there are places where
there are efforts to do
that. So I want to thank
um the panelists and
with that, I think we're about ready to get
on to our next item. Thank you,
professor. Thank you,
Sam.
Yes. And thank you.
It's a complicated issue and
I waded
into it a little bit. So with
some trepidation
in, in my, my business and my law
practice. Uh So we've
left a little bit of time at the end of the day. Let me
do a few things for
sake of the good of the
cause. First of all, we have minutes
to approve, right, Nancy.
Uh So if we
can have you all looking at those for a
few minutes while we get ready to
have a little bit of talk amongst
ourselves, so we can get those approved.
We have tomorrow morning
you're seeing on your agenda.
830 ami
I think uh I'm gonna
push that to nine, let
everybody sleep in a little
bit just because I expect you to have a good time
tonight. Um
And here in Las Cruces.
So uh we'll
start here at nine. The
goal is to have everybody join
us here so we can have breakfast. So I suggest
you still try and come around 830
have some socializing time,
but we'll have breakfast with the university
at here at 830
then the plan is to leave here
at 930.
Uh I'm gonna encourage you all to carpool
as much as you can, but they, they'll be
able to accommodate uh private
vehicles at the J Paul
Taylor Center.
Um
Next year it
is, it's on the, it's on the way out to
Deming. Um, what
I've, what I've asked you a little bit, will this
will lead into the next conversation? I think
a little bit, we'll talk a little bit about
the Otero facility
today. I've, I've been assured
that um, uh we
will be able to talk to the,
the uh juveniles who are
detained there that is essentially
critical to me to be able to do.
We're probably gonna have to break up
into two groups. I talked with
Secretary Casados and that because
of the large size of this committee,
we may have two groups. So 1
may be touring one part
and the other talking with the, the
youth. But I've been
told that we'll be able to speak
with them. I haven't been able to get a
confirmation that we'll be able to
do what I want to do. And I understand why
I, I really wanted to have
a number of young people sitting at
a table like this and being able to ask them
questions and, and really
learn from them. I think that would be the
most useful to
me. I can understand where
they, they may have lawyers and others who
don't think that's a good idea and I
can appreciate and respect
that. Uh years ago.
Um I remember
we went to a, a prison
facility. It was the one
in Los Luas and
we saw all kinds of lovely
facilities and we saw
all kinds of crafts and arts
and everything they were making and so worth. And then
I said, I'd really like
to talk to the, the gentleman
who were incarcerated there
and the whole
meeting went into a whole, complete
different direction and it was really
probably one of the better experience I've
had where they felt like they could tell
us they weren't getting health care, they
weren't getting things that they thought were important
for us to hear. I don't, I don't
always worry about that because I worry about the
consequences to them afterwards.
But we'll, we'll try
and walk that line carefully tomorrow and
I'll respect all of you to be
good with, with the young people
when we were there last time.
Representative Reed, the one thing that was
not helpful for
me was
that when we split up into the meeting
with the youth, we kind of all went off
into our own thing and did our own thing
and, and that's useful. It's, it's interesting
to talk to these young people, one on one.
But, but I think we get more
synergy when there's several
of us talking to them together. So I'd hear
somebody talking about one thing. Oh, I want to hear
that and jump over there. So
I'm trying to bring us together as much
as we can to do that. We'll see.
Secretary has been a little cautious
and I understand that too. But, uh,
tomorrow, so we'll leave here,
uh, we'll leave here at
930. So we'll be here from
830 to
930. You can show up
at 989.
We'll have a little short presentation
about the J Paul Taylor
Center because I know many of you all are new,
new to the committee and new to the legislature.
So I thought some introduction would be
good. I think the J Paul Taylor
Center was important to me
because, um, I
don't, I don't think many people have been harder
on CYFD than I have, but
that's probably, that's
probably a tough competition because I
think we've all been pretty tough on
CYFD. Um,
they, there's some things they do.
Right. And some things they do. Well, and
I think J Paul Taylor Center, at
least from my experience so far
is one of the things they do. Well,
and, and I think it's important for us to
recognize that as, as,
uh in addition to the, the
challenges they face. So that's kind of
tomorrow's plan and
then we'll come back here, we'll have lunch and
then we'll have an
presentation I think on,
on the Otero detention
facility and others. Um, and
we'll, we'll do that
this afternoon or tomorrow
afternoon. Uh, this
evening. I
would love to have all of you join
me at my house, which is not
far from here. Again, it's less
than half, half a mile up the
street here. A little bit easy to
get to. No, between here and there are
no traffic lights, a couple of,
a couple of stop signs.
Um, and so
Nancy is supposed to be sending
out that she wants to
get the laptop back. I think it's Nancy
back there some.
Ok. So Nancy's supposed to
be sending my, uh,
address, home address
and if any of you all don't have that email
and I want to make sure you
join us, please
get it from her before you leave here shortly.
We're gonna start at 86. We're gonna
start at 630 this evening
and I strongly encourage all of
you to go home and change
first. Uh, no
coats, no ties at my house.
So, um,
and, uh, and for
the women as well too. So if you have
something comfortable, please dress
comfortably. It will be a little warm.
Uh, it's 630 but it'll cool
off real nicely by about seven o'clock. And
I promise you one of the best
sunsets in town.
So that will be nice and we'll have
dinner and
libations. So I hope you can
join us in a chance for us to
talk a little bit more about our
day and, and the things we learned
today.
Um I um I had put
the 430 spot for
committee discussion left ourselves half
an hour to talk about the
special session. The special
session agenda,
CYFD and the arbitra
report, arbitrator's report. We'll
hear a little bit more about that tomorrow
special session. Um
I spoke with the
Governor's General counsel,
um and
there and um,
m Berkel this morning
or yesterday. Keep it all straight. The,
the last word I have
is probably early October, but
I'm getting, getting a great
deal of certainty that there will be a
special session.
I've um
asked, um, as you know, from
even going back to Redos, I've asked
Holly
and the governor's general counsel
to try and give us an idea of what we could
expect on a special
session agenda by the governor
as it may relate to the work
that this committee has done. You all may
remember last
year uh chaired
by uh uh represent
Chandler. The
leadership really charged this
committee to try and flesh
out a lot of the criminal
justice agenda that was being discussed
at the time. A lot of the
legislation and, and their
expectation was this committee would be the
ones to really have the
hearings on it, do the work. And then we'd show
up to Santa Fe and it would
be something that had been
well vetted and that we can make
good recommendations
as a committee about.
So assuming that that would still
be a methodology
that leadership might want to employ.
I've kind of encouraged the governor's
staff and uh
leadership to let
us know what that
legislation might look like.
I've got to tell you,
um, not too much,
unlike the last special session, we may find
out a couple of days before what the
agenda is gonna be. I, I right
now, I don't have any
idea what
legislation we may
see with any kind of reliability
uh in the special
session. So I
can't give you anything better than
that, but I do
want to give you a bit of report that I'm
trying to find out. I'm trying
to find out what bills we
may see. I think the, um in
my conversations with
2nd and 3rd
hand, uh
the governor seems to continue to
be very interested in felon in
possession uh
legislation which we've seen, I
think all familiar with. And
that's really about the or maybe
harm to self harm to others,
right? Uh Representative,
we continue to hear that
bill that didn't get through the last session.
And so we want to talk
about that maybe, but I, I have
reminded the leadership and the
governor's staff that we only
have one more meeting
after this scheduled,
the one in September before we would
be in the special session.
And so if we're not gonna do
it, this meeting, which we're
not, then
that really only leaves the September
meeting for us to spend any time looking
at any, anything that may be on a crime
agenda. And I, I wouldn't
be surprised right now. There's not gonna be a crime
agenda at all on the
special session. So
that's the latest.
Otherwise, uh, this is the part
where we all, um, get
to talk about whatever
we want. I, I want to lead with one
topic. Um,
the, the, the, the
tour of the detention facility
in Otero County today
was something that I was interested in
doing probably like a
year. Well,
certainly a year ago
I began discussing at the
time with a good friend of mine,
Zach Cook, who
was a former colleague of
mine in the house back
in the day and serve would be on the
judiciary committee. And I
think the world of Zach and
Zach told me at the time
again about a year ago that, that
this would not be a problem at
all for us to, to tour the
facility.
And I was encouraged by that,
I double checked again with
him in
Ritos when we were Ritos
last meeting. And Zach, and you may
remember Zach was at the committee meeting
and I had a chance in the
hallway with him and others to
confirm that that the tour was
still a go and not gonna be a
problem.
Um, about
two weeks ago, Nancy
and I began getting some kind of
messages in directly that it was gonna be
a problem. Uh That
um that the timing was gonna
be problematic that
they um
um
the, there was
the issue about the background checks.
But the biggest problem I really ran into
was that Zach was telling me he was not
able to communicate with the
people who were in charge of the facility.
So really the person who I
was relying upon to help me make this
happen was telling me his
phone calls were not being returned by
III I read
all the, I don't read all
I read some of the blogs, not very
many block, but I read some.
Uh And uh
anyway, there was some suggestion about,
well, the message didn't get
received, didn't get passed through. I don't
know. But in any
event, we began getting some
suggestions that there was not going to
be a something to do.
I began working through
um contacts, we had contacts
with the County Commission in
Otero County trying to see
if they could, um, uh,
break the logjam
and was
working really through the association
of counties and others who might have contacts.
So I think they reached out to
certain county commissioners and again,
they thought they might be able to make it happen.
But ultimately, about a week
ago, 10 days ago, it
was still iffy to me, it was
still up in the air and I, I couldn't
continue to hold the,
uh, the agenda really
in, in our plans and expectations.
And at the same time,
uh, the Christine
represent Chandler
had a
very
uh fixed
agenda that was important for
today. You all that, you all, we
had what,
32 judges
here, three on the
phone, uh Zoom,
one of the chief justice Supreme
Court District Attorney,
uh, chief Public Defender.
We, we set these agendas with a
lot of work from
our staff and from me and from
Christine, we, we meet
almost immediately after these
meetings, we meet together on the phone
and we say, what's the next meeting gonna be?
What's the agenda gonna be? What
topics are we gonna have?
Who should we have present them? We start
that very, very quickly
right afterwards, usually within days
of, of these meetings. And
so we did that here. And so we began
to set that agenda.
So, um, when I received
word that, uh Senator
Brantley, um had
contacts and could make the
tour happen on
Monday, it
very frankly was
not something that I was
willing to do to be candid with
you. I was not willing to change the agenda
and uh displace all
of the speakers and the agenda that we have
put together. So I essentially said
no, uh I, I
don't know whether I said yes, it
would have worked. But, but in any
event that that's the decision I made.
So that's kind of the history
of how we got here. I know there's been all
kinds of uh
commotion and in
interest and
press and blogs
and etcetera, etcetera about this.
And uh people
will scandalize things. But
there's, there's
not so much from my perspective,
a lot of scandal. We're seeing
these issues at the
national level. We see Congress
persons who try to get
in these facilities and can't, I think
we've had some Congress person that
are kind of, I think,
I don't know whether they've been arrested or restrained
but they, they've been, um,
you know, it's been, it's
been less
than uh
sanguine kind
of uh environment.
Um The other thing I will tell you
is that, that II, I
never spoke with anyone from
the facility itself, so I don't know these
things to be true. II, I believe I
was told actually, I should
say that I, what I read in the
press was that when
our Congress person from down here
uh gave Vasquez to
the same facility recently,
he was not permitted
to speak with the
detainees.
Um, and, um,
and I don't know whether you all that were there, they
had a chance to talk with the detainees
or not. You're shaking your heads.
No. So, II, I
guess I understand why you
would be allowed to speak with the
detainees. And at the other, on the other hand,
I don't understand that. And I
also find, as I
said, a minute ago, I, I find
touring a facility without a chance to
speak with the people. There be
really
two
not very valuable to
me. I uh
it was a challenging
morning. I'll tell you because of four
of you all showed up uh on
schedule on time.
Um Along with me, it was
very lonely,
right? Uh with the five
of us and please
understand too. It, it was
not good for me as the chair
because we had the president of the university
here to speak to us.
Um And, and he was
busy, he was supposed to be in Santa Fe. So he
took time out of his schedule
because he was scheduled. So he spoke
to the four of us. We didn't have a quorum
at the time and because we didn't
have a quorum, we were not
permitted to broadcast
is what I'm what I was told.
So I'm told we cannot operate
as a subcom committee until we have
eight members. And in
the absence of a sub-committee, Sean was tell
me we could not go live. So we had
the president of the
university speak to us.
Uh and the public was not able
to participate. And then we
had a presentation on the second
amendment. We had the Governor's
General counsel speak
to us about plans for
uh the appeal
in the 10th circuit and the status
of our seven day waiting period.
We had that presentation as
well too. And again, regrettably, the public
was not able to participate because
we didn't have eight people here.
So I just want to give you all
a little bit of context about
how my day is gone.
I am looking forward to having
you all uh uh have
a beer with me and uh
getting beyond that, but I thought it was
important for you all to know a
little bit about how the morning
went and, and uh where that
left us. And I, I know some
of your colleagues felt
um that,
that we should have been here to get work
done because they had come a long way and they were
here to do so. So
anyway, that's my, that's my way
to start the discussion
off. Anyone
else wanna weigh
in. I, I'd be interested in knowing,
you know, what other members
wanna chime in on with this
subject or any other. So,
Senator Brantley, I am not surprised you
would raise your hand. I I should thank
you,  Mr.  Chairman.
First of all, I think we should. It's
interesting how the narrative gets
a little taken out of context.
So, um outside
of the legislator
Joseph and I are friends
and so we communicate regularly.
So I think the biggest
disappointment in scheduling
this one, it was
important and we've all heard this, it was important
to a number of legislators to tour
today's detention facility
in light of what the governor's office
had said last time that this
potential legislation
and that was a sense of urgency. So
we too were disappointed
that for whatever reason,
um your request
to tour the facility was
not, um, followed through.
And I'll say that because today
actually on the tour, I
asked the, uh, Otero
County commissioners,
um and lawyer were there
and, and, and county
manager why your
request was not
met. And they
also didn't know anything about
the request nor did I. So
it hadn't reached anyone's
desk that the, the tour
was even being requested
by you. So for whatever
reason, we were able to continue on,
every legislator was
encouraged to on this committee
to attend and, and many
did this morning. And I thought
that it was very valuable.
I, I think the biggest
um concern is it
really is how the
tour got scheduled but
why it got scheduled
and that's what the focus needs to remain
on is that as lawmakers,
we're gonna be taking action on this
very specific
site and others.
And so why we needed to see
that. Um
I was a little disappointed,
I think Senator Cervantes
and I are, this really
isn't a contentious
issue between the two of us. I reached
out to him before I sent an email to
any of you guys. So nothing
takes either of us by surprise.
Um But the
narrative in the media is
disappointing because someone from the
committee forwarded
that, that uh
communications from
this committee on. And so it kind
of sensationalized something that
really wasn't a
sensational issue.
So that email thread
had been forwarded by a member of this
committee on to the press.
And so the press latched on to
this for all the wrong
reasons. The focus
needs to be on
what the legislation
addressed on this
facility. But I do
want to say to, to
my chairman in our
uh
private conversations in
no way was his uh
denial to make this a
formal tour
disrespectful to me. In fact,
I appreciate the phone call and the
conversation, but we have a
very respectful uh
communication. I hope
that my response to say we're gonna
go ahead and move forward with the tour.
Here's when we expect to be back.
I'll send a message when we're on the way
back so you can expect it.
Um I don't think he took that as
disrespectful that we were gonna continue
on with the tour either. So
either way, I think that we just
control the narrative here. But thank you
Mr.  Chairman for, for
understanding that we were still gonna move
forward with
that.
What else, Wayne Wayan?
Ok. Uh I'm gonna
hear from Representative Romero and then
the vice chair
challenge.
Uh Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
Um I don't know if it's appropriate to
talk about the tour. I
actually did go, I was the
only democratic member
that did go on the tour today.
I felt like it was really important
understanding the
um unknowns about
who can turn, who can't at
different times and, and
also the challenges with the
chairs having the
scheduling, um,
inability to, to make
this part of our C CJ
experience. So,
um, I missed these
the morning meetings in order
to go there and also to,
um, visit
the Eoir
um court, um,
as an attorney.
And so, um,
I don't, I mean, what's more
important than scheduling is
actually the experience.
Um, I think in what
was what,
what it opens our eyes
to. Um if I'd
be happy to share
with, with folks about what I
experienced. Um
And certainly the questions that
didn't get asked by not
having a broader group
of, of folks that were able
to participate. Um
I think would have been really enlightening
um in, in light
of what's what's happening and who's being
detained for what purpose, including
the data that was
provided to us about
who's in that facility and for,
for what reason.
Um and not having
anything on the record to be able
to show right now.
So, you know, um
certainly all verbal.
Um but I'm happy to talk about
that and certainly
think it's important to do
that. So if it's
appropriate tomorrow, we can
talk about some of those things.
Um But yeah, I
feel like it's important on balance
to, to be able to have those
opportunities. Um
And yeah, we,
we, we should have had the
opportunity.
Oh, because you're not sharing
it now, I hope you will share it tomorrow because
I'm very interested in knowing what you did learn.
This is, you know, II I
need to own this. I,
I try to own
most things that I do
that. Sometimes
I get a lot of criticism for
this, this last session. When this
legislation reached the
Senate, it got to the Senate
Judiciary Committee. I didn't hear
it. Uh I didn't
hear it for several weeks. I do
that. You all may have heard
sometimes I do
that and I, when I say I do that, I do
that with consultation
with, I do with the minority
leadership, with, with, uh,
with the Senate
leadership, with the governor's
office at times. I, I'm
not a king over
there at all. I do with staff.
It's sometimes done, candidly,
you all have heard this before. It's
sometimes done because,
um, what's going on in the
house to be perfectly honest
with you that the house
practices to filibuster
the final several days
of the session,
you're looking at home.
It's not the
house.
We, we,
we know
we all know what we're talking
about but, but I bring it up because
again, um,
uh, and that's a
perfectly valid
approach that that's
allowable and it's what's
done. And so let's be honest,
the Republicans will go into a filibuster
mode and debate every bill for three hours
regardless of the weight
really of the bill. And that's a way to keep
stuff from passing and again, perfectly
legitimate. Democrats do the same
thing. And, and Texas
or whatever it may be, right? Um
These are, these are tools and
things that the minority does.
The problem that creates
for me.
And I've shared this with you all. But I think it's
important to understand is when that
happens, then the, the
house bills that are over in the
Senate or in their committee,
we're essentially told, I'm told as
the leader, we can't touch
that bill
because, because if we
amend that bill or we substitute
that bill and, you know, we substitute bills
and when we have big changes,
I don't like to send bills over with
piecemeal amendments.
You'll see those and they're
incomprehensible and they're not
very useful. So we'll do a committee
substitution in the Senate judiciary
committee and Senator Brantley is there
now and, and, and, uh, so
Senator Paul and they see that
methodology. It works really well.
But what I'm told of course, and
I think that is correct is when we do a committee
substitution of a house bill,
it has to go all the way back
through your committee process all
over again. And when you're debating
things on your floor, three hours
of pop, you're only gonna be able
to hear maybe 68
bills a day on the house
floor. So,
um, so I, so then I'm told, well, we
can't do a committee substitute and then I'm told,
well, can we amend
this? Well, you really can't amend it because
then that's gonna go back and that's gonna
have to be concurrence and that's a
three hour debate.
So what happens to me in the, in those
last few days in great
frustration is my
leadership will tell me if you schedule a
bill to be heard, you can't
touch it
right. If you schedule that
bill and judiciary, you can't touch it,
you can't amend it, you can't
substitute. And
so that to me means
the only bills that I can hear have to be
perfect and,
um, and, and, or,
or something we can live with as,
as perfection. And
you all know that that's, that's
difficult to do
so. In any event, this last
session, this particular piece of
legislation sat in the Senate
Judiciary command. I'm giving my reasons
for, uh,
and, and, and it's because frankly,
there was no room for any movement
or change in that legislation without
going back to the house and having a complete
meldown. So I want to give you that context.
That bill sat in judiciary for
probably a week, I think, maybe or
so. Um,
in years past similar
efforts have come all the way to the Senate
floor. I think in the past I
voted against this on
one or two occasions,
uh, for reasons that have been explained
in the press. But I've, I've
said them, I, I have
felt in years past that I would
rather have these immigrant
detainees in New
Mexico, uh,
where they're close to their
families and the border.
And um and a culture
that I think is may be different
than other places they might encounter.
Uh El Salvador
with their heads shaved and, and
crawling on the floor
as an example, uh
or alligator
Alcatraz or whatever might be. I thought
we, I thought we would be
better with these
individuals here. And I also
thought it was fanciful for the
groups that wanted to close these facilities.
To think that if we close the
facilities, they wouldn't be detained
someplace else. I
always thought that was
naive. Um
And I still, I still do think
that's na
but anyway, um,
um, my position is not hardened on
this issue. My position may
change uh, as
a result of some of the things that have taken
place, not so much because
of the tours or not because of anything
on this committee is done. But
really because I think there's an entirely
different attitude
in Washington DC these days.
And it's one that's very concerning
to me. So I'm
sorry, I've taken so much of the time, but,
um, this is freefall free
for so represent
I all that was my way. Say, I hope you'll
share your feelings, your
thoughts either, not today.
Then tomorrow when we have the opportunity,
uh I have representative Chandler, then
representative, then
Senator hell
others,
Cio
Lopez.
What?
Oakland? The
Hill.
All right. Uh
Jennifer, my wife is gonna
be really upset if I show up for a
630 gathering at
630.
So, uh, so I,
I'm gonna, I'm not gonna put time
limits on everybody, but I'm gonna jump
in and ask you all to be,
keep it snappy. Right? So, let's
do it. Represent Chandler.
I'll try to be snappy.
Um, I guess
my disappointment
in terms of the scheduling of the
tour is we
knew we had AC CJ
meeting on Monday
and nonetheless,
there's a tour schedule
which direct by
someone on the committee.
And I think that is
disrespectful of the committee.
I'm sorry, I do.
Um, it could have been
scheduled presumably,
uh after,
uh, on Wednesday or
another day. Uh, but
instead that was the date we were
given, it was a
date that clearly
interfered with C
CJ
and
people were working on the C
CJ agenda.
And, you know, that hasn't,
I, none of us have been
given an explanation as
to why Monday
had to be Monday and
not Wednesday or
Thursday or Tuesday,
which is what um Senator
Cervantes had been working
on. So, you know, I'm just gonna
be honest with everyone. I think
it is disrespectful
to the members to
schedule a tour
that many of us would
have been interested in
attending. Had it
not been
directly.
Um, I
in conflict with
our committee and
as vice chair, obviously,
it's important for us to
be um, respectful
of the committee's schedule.
And I'm pleased that
the chairman is willing
to be a little bit more forgiving.
I think it's, it is
um really not
appro an appropriate thing to
do and it could
have been co-ordinated better
with the chairman. So
I just wanted to put that out
there. Thank you,  Mr.
Chair.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Are we, is
this the portion of the committee
where we can talk about other things
or do we have to stay on this subject
matter?
Ok. So let's stay on the same
subject. And, and when they, it's done,
may I jump in? So
thank
you,
Senator uh Cilio
Lopez. We'll start with you.
Um Thank you,  Mr.
Chair. I was
also very disappointed.
Um I've been trying to get into
these facilities for six
years and I
know there's a huge difference
between a planned
tour
where everything is prepared in
advance. And when you show
up and my
understanding is we can go to any
state prison as
a legislator and part of our oversight
responsibility, they will
let us tour the facility
at any time, any.
And that's not true with these private
facilities. I went to
Torrance County and asked to tour the
facility probably about
four years ago and they said no,
they didn't have any uh
obligation to let me tour
the facility.
Um So then,
uh representative Alcon,
who I was very close
to, to, to him because he
knew my father just
really disappointed my, my, my
work on this, he asked
me to tour the Sibila
facility and I
said, great. I'd be happy to,
I'd like it to be spontaneous,
you know, unannounced.
And more
important, I want to be able to
talk to
the residents
and that could not be
arranged. And I found
that very disappointing. I
also think that this tour
probably for, from what
I gather, if you
can't talk in
private with the
residents and
assure that their comments will
be, there won't
be any kind of
repercussions for them
for an honest conversation
then that is not an
adequate tour.
Um I finally
got into Torrance County
by volunteering with the legal
services organization
to do intake.
And that's how I've been able to get
in there. And I'm looking
forward to sharing the
disgusting
um,
circumstances that I
saw. Um, and they
just, they just thought I was a
volunteer, so I'm sure
it was still cleaned up but there,
well, I'll, I'll let you know
how disgusting it was
tomorrow. Um So
I was very disappointed not to
attend. Um, but
my obligation, I felt
a stronger obligation to this
committee.
Thank you.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. And,
and I, I just
want to say, I'm sorry, I,
I didn't get here till
930. I did
leave home at
515.
Um, and anticipated
that I'd be here by 915.
But the one thing I forgot was
that I have to charge
halfway down. And so
I got stuck an extra 15
minutes. Um
Yeah, so,
so that's why I was, I was
30 minutes late instead of just
15 minutes late, which
I had planned for.
Um, but I too am
disappointed that I didn't get an
opportunity to go on the
tour but felt
a strong commitment to be
here um
to be a part of this committee.
So thank you for your patience
with me. But I, I did feel
bad that the
president of
um N MS U was here
waiting just
waiting for us
to get here.
And um that,
that is an uncomfortable
position to be in
when you've got the president
of
uh
at the university, a
big university who
is just waiting at the table
for a few legislators
to show up. It's, it was, it was
embarrassing for me to,
to walk in and, and,
and end up being part of
the reason that he was able.
So I felt really bad  Mr.
Chair and I just want to say thank
you for your patience. Well,
and I appreciate that. Understand too.
He's a new president, brand
new here. Um It was
not my, you know, and I'm
Myres community, so it was not my
finest moment.
Um And, and
I, and I'm, I'm late sometimes too.
I understand that we're all busy sometimes. I miss
meetings. So Representative Chandler
had another commitment. We, we
accommodate all that. I just hope
that I two things. I hope
that, that we're
still presenting
subject matter that interests
you when, when I don't have anybody
here I, I sit
there and go.
Damn, that I, uh,
put out the wrong topics
and is everybody busy doing
something really interesting,
like finance for God's
sake, uh, or
whatever. But, but, you know, that's
the way it goes through your head. Right. And so, and then
I've got Nancy, uh,
scrambling and, and
Sean, they're calling you all on your
phones. Are you gonna come? Because we, we
didn't know we were gonna be able to get a quorum.
Right. And we don't have a quorum. The
public can't participate. That's my,
my real concern. So,
I, I do appreciate that, but
don't feel bad. I mean, you all have lives,
we all have lives as a citizen
legislature. Uh,
but, but it is important for me to
share you to appreciate the fact
that, that your attendance is
really important to me and it's
important to our speakers and
I, I don't put things on our
agenda for fluff.
Uh, some folks might have
thought having Brandon go through that
poor guy's history, uh, for
15 minutes is, is
fluff, but I thought it led it well
into the subject matter and I try
to choreograph the,
the subjects for that reason
too. So represent a block and
then represent Homan V
Hill.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Do
you wanna talk today
about what we saw
at the facility? It seems like everyone
is a little apprehensive to actually
talk about what
we saw. Are we going
to have an opportunity to do that
tomorrow or will
that
be something else?
We, we do? And that's probably
the time to do it, I would think
because we'll hear from the county commissioners.
Now, let me just tell you, I'm not, I'm not
nearly the jerk that I'm put out
to be. Sometimes,
sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
not the biggest, sometimes not the
big jerk. I gotta tell you
when this thing got political and got a
little testy and so forth.
One of the suggestions was that
we should move the Otero County and
the presentation
to this morning at 830
or nine o'clock. So that you
all would have to choose between going on the
tour and hearing the county
commissioners defend the
contract. That would have been a real,
there's a word I have in mind that I've
tried really hard not to use. But,
but you can
probably guess what it is. I'm
from a football locker
room version of the. Yes.
But, but that, that would
have been a political
uh
I'm having a hard time not using these
words. I'm gonna use the
Spanish word. No, I
can't use the Spanish
word.
I, I just say it was a political
football. I can't say
Chinga could I can I say
Chinga, I don't
think I can say that. No.
So anyway, um
but, but
anyway, but, you know, I mean, I'm telling
you that's what got bounced around. I will
tell you a couple of things. I will tell you
that I did not get any phone
call from leadership on this issue,
Democrat or Republican
House or Senate. And
I also did not call anyone of you on the
committee and say do or do not
attend this. So you,
you all are grownups and I
respect you all very much and have
and so I respect your judgment. But
um in any event, I
think the best idea would probably be to
if you want to ask some of
these things to do it after the
commissioners and we'll
have a chance tomorrow, we'll have another dinner tomorrow
night. I hope most of you all are sticking
around before we're done today.
I need to approve the minutes, but we,
we'll have a dinner tomorrow. We'll have the same
con conversation tomorrow. And
again, I hope you
appreciate this part
of these meetings. It's unusual,
uh, to, I don't think anybody
does this but it's like, get
stuff off your chest. It's a good chance
for you to bitch at
me and, and for me to
explain, explain why your
bills are dying in Senate
judiciary,
why your bills in the Senate jury.
Well, sometimes because you all are
things uh so that you
get five or six items on
your agenda in the house done in the day.
So  Mr.  Chair, I just,
I, I just want to make
sure
that we just don't have four minutes
to talk about it tomorrow and
we actually have a robust discussion
because if that's the case, I'd rather
talk about it today
because I don't want to just sweep
it under the rug with four
minutes, pop, cut
us off and then we don't really have
robust discussion.
That's my concern. No, we've,
we've got discussion about
430. We started about
that time on time today to, I will
set aside an hour for it. I hope
that's going to be robust enough.
If not, we'll postpone
and we'll get to dinner a little late.
I see the end of the world. Ok.
Well, then in other, other news,
well, stay on the subject. Stay on the
subject. Well, on the
subject, I just
have a bit of a
concern when it comes to the
tardiness of the
agenda
because we got it Friday
for a meeting on Monday
and I think it's very difficult
to get people involved
and want to watch if we don't know
what we're talking about.
And furthermore, I do also
think it's important to have
public input and
I have never seen
at least this year, I don't know if we had it
last year, any public
comment period with 30 seconds
or a minute, at least
for people to just give some
comment because all of
these issues, they do indeed
affect people in our districts.
And I would love to hear directly
from those constituents
about what those problems
are. So, I don't know if that's specifically
on topic, but the top
everything on the agenda
sort of, I'm, I'm notoriously
uh late for getting the
agendas out. You all probably know that
by now, Nancy certainly
knows it by now. Uh
The, the, the reason for that
largely are because
I'm trying to make what we're doing here very
timely. Right? So,
so this morning, we had a presentation
on the 10th circuit
uh injunction of our seven day
waiting period. That was, that
was last week, right?
We, we've had
a number of presentations on CWA
FD because when I hear and read a
story about a child who dies,
a child who's raped a child who's
wandering the streets of Albuquerque.
I think that that's such a
timely important issue.
I've explained a little bit about the fact
that I keep, um, as of,
like I said, talking to
Carolyn Burle yesterday this
morning, I think actually, and
Holly Agen and
I'm constantly hoping
them to tell me what we
should be doing. Uh,
And, and frankly, I've left aside
some of these blocks of time in our agenda
to try and figure out that we might be
slotting things in here with lastminute
legislation. So your criticism
is valid. Um
And, and I'm sure the staff would probably
be happy for me to set the agenda much
earlier. But I, I'm gonna
purposefully uh
mix it up sometimes
and I hope you all will just stay
tuned and be unhappy with me about doing
that. But I hope when you get
here, you, you get
here and are stimulated by the
subjects and the topics and, and
subject matter as well too.
Um But II I accept
that in terms of public comment,
um I'll be happy to talk
with all of you more about that.
But I um
I know a lot of committees have a lot
of public comment. I have
to tell you that the
COVID era changed
my thinking, the fact that anybody
could call in from
home, in their
pajamas and on the sofa and
tell us what they think
to me seems unwieldy.
Uh, and, and,
and I don't find it very, uh,
frankly, very
constructive. Uh,
I, everybody has an opinion.
Um,
you know, we get it, get
on your blog and you can have
your opinion. Everybody can have their opinion
for me to subject the committee
to. That. My
general impression is when I
watch that nobody's paying
attention, uh, members
leave, members are on their phones,
members on their computers
and, and I, I respect
your time too much. That's not to be
disrespectful to the public.
But um and then frankly,
we get the frequent flyers, we get some
people come the same,
people come to every meeting with the
same comments.
And so II, I,
in terms of the interest of our
time, I'll, I'll be happy
to talk to you more about it. There may be certain
topics that make some sense to that.
But if we, if we say we're gonna let
anybody who wants to come in here
uh and get in front of the microphone,
tell us what they think. Uh
you can understand. I'm not gonna be able
to keep a time for an agenda
or control of anything and,
and uh I can't go
to Washington DC
and walk up to a microphone in the Senate
and expect them to have to listen to me
that II, I don't know where
we got that from. It's a
lovely thing,
but I think it's becoming a relic
of the past. We can
thank you,  Mr.  Chair and II, I
guess I understand
somewhat because
we're conduits to who we
represent, right? They can
email me 1000 emails that
say I love
certain kind of cheese. Please
talk about this in committee and I would just
be compelled to unless
it wasn't an election issue,
Mr.  Chair. So I do
think it's uh incredibly
important just to get that
perspective, but I do get it.
There are a lot of people who come here and say
the same thing all over again.
But I do think when it comes to the
agenda, at least for the staff,
you know, if I, I'm emailing
all, all of the staff and like, OK, what
are we doing next week? I need
to make plans. And if I
don't know what we're doing, how do
we understand that? And also the
tour, for example, I feel
like if we had
this is a timely issue, I
feel like if this was in the works
for six months, I don't think it
would be that much of a burden to put
this on the agenda, even with
the background checks to, to get
done and things because it's just
very standard. I've
taken a lot of tours, I took a tour
of the FBI building in DC,
had to get a background check. I
took a tour of the, of the
border, had to get a background
check. So it's very standard. I
don't think I, I saw an
email from you  Mr.  Chair that said it
was a reasonable objection.
I do not believe that is
reasonable when it comes
to wanting to have oversight.
We had oversight today.
And I think you see on T VA
lot of these individuals who say
I was denied
entry, they did not
go through the office of Congressional
Relations to get a
tour and
they didn't show
up in
a timely manner when they were
slotted. So, I mean, if
you just go to a facility and ask
to be entered into
there, it's not gonna
happen. It just can't happen.
You need to have these checks and balances,
you have to show your identification,
you need to go through the proper protocols.
And I think that that's just something
that's general and very valid.
So I would just
give that to the public just so they
don't have the misapprehension
that we're trying to keep people out of
facilities or the federal
government is because they let us
all in here Democrats, Republicans.
And unfortunately, we only
had one member of the majority party
there, but it was good
to have a bipartisan delegation.
So that's all  Mr.  Chair, I'll save
the rest for tomorrow.
And before we move on, III
I did say that
um
I understand that that's a standard
practice and
at the same time, we live in different times
now. Um and
what a background check means
to you. Representative, a
guy, my colour and my name,
background check means a different thing these
days, I think. And, and
I don't know, I don't know what,
um, I don't know what they would want to know in
my background. That
would be any of their business to
be candid with you. I'm a legislator.
I'm a senator.
So I, I just, just difference
of opinion. I, I can understand,
I can understand that standard operating
procedure. I think in years past,
I might have felt differently about it, but I,
I think we're living in very different. I
understand, but I don't think skin
colour should be something
that we talk about. I mean, I'm Hispanic
and Native American go to Home
Depot. I know,
but at the end of the day,
if, if you're a legislator,
it's, it's probably
a high probability
that you're a citizen of this country.
And so I don't think it should be a problem
for a legislator to pass a background
check. Maybe some people have something
to hide and I don't believe I'm one
of those people. So, thank you,  Mr.
Chair. Thank you
uh Representative Homan
Hill. Thank
you,  Mr.  Chairman and I'll keep my comments
brief. Um And I appreciate
the sentiment that's been expressed from my
colleagues here. I, I wanna reiterate
that for the most part,  Mr.
Chairman, we have a great
working relationship. I know that I have
a great working relationship with
all of my colleagues here,
leadership in the various house
is minority and majority have a
great relationship. And so, you
know, in the spirit, in that
spirit, um I
do, I do want to say
that I think we can continue to
advance that relationship by
having conversations like this.
But  Mr.  Chairman, quite
frankly, I was quite
disappointed this morning.
Um because I,
I was put in a position
where I had to
show up for this committee and we were
hearing a presentation on
a bill that many of us at this
table sponsored.
And then, you know, also
with the conflicting uh
priority of taking
this tour for oversight which
many of us have been trying to take
for quite some time. So,
um  Mr.  Chairman, I don't think
quite honestly that it's the fault
of anybody sitting any of my
colleagues sitting here at
this table. But I do want
to talk about the elephant in the room when
talking about the times that we're living
in right now. Um
You know, I, I was quite
upset by the fact that,
you know, you have been trying for quite
some time and going through what you
thought were the pro the proper channels
to arrange this tour.  Mr.
Chair through Tero
County had
gotten the response you've gotten. But
then our, our colleagues on the
other side of the aisle were able to
get in right away. And
I I, you know, maybe I'm just
making an assumption and you know what they
say about those. But again,
in these times, we
all have to be very sensitive
of that, especially if we want to
maintain our working relationship.
So my hope,  Mr.  Chairman
working, moving
forward in the spirit of this
working relationship, we can
all work together. We can all
plan together if some of us
have contacts, if some of
us can get in and get the
business done, that we can work
together so that we could have
a cohesive agenda
and everybody knows what to expect
so that some of us are
put in are no longer put in that
position where we have to choose
between our roles here,
our obligations here as part
of this interim committee, some of
us as voting members and you
know, oversight tours that we've been trying
to get for quite some time. So thank
you. Thank you
on the same subject. Anyone
else,
Mr.  Chairman, if I can clarify?
Thank you. Thank you, Representative
Haman. I agree. So
to be clear,
um
the chairman had the option to
include that on the agenda. It was the
time that they had allowed me to and
chose not to and that was
discussed between us before
that email invitation.
But I did say I was gonna extend
the invitation because I didn't want
it to be a partisan group.
So it was important to me
that even if it wasn't gonna be
included on the agenda. I wanted
all of my colleagues to have equal
access. So it's important to me that I
still extended that,
that made sure that everyone knew
that they were allowed. Even if
the, the chairman and
frankly, the co chair chair
didn't want to include it
on that
agenda. So it
was important that we had that
opportunity. I,
you want to push back on just a couple
of things. Otero County
insists today with the county
manager that they never received
a request.
So we're putting a lot on Otero
County, but they said they never received
<AAA> request to have the
tour. And so it was quite
easy to get in. And so
I had sent that to Nancy
and, and the chairman
saying that this tour could in
fact happen if you wanted to include
this and that there would be a
number of us that we're still
interested and would still be taking
the tour and to consider that
when creating the agenda
even moving forward to make sure
that if we needed to be there,
I'll tell you I was looking at the makeup of
this committee though and I want
to point out that every
voting Republican is
in attendance. The
list of and in fact, many
of our advisory members, the list
of Democrats who are not
here and who have
actually
routinely not been in this committee
is very long. And so perhaps
that's something because if it's the
Republicans that's not giving this
committee, um a,
a quorum in the
morning, uh We have a
big problem because there's a long
list of people who aren't here but
certainly not the seven Republicans
that wanted to work.
Thank you. Anyone else on the subject
matter? Right. I think
I have a feeling we'll hear about this a little bit
more again tomorrow. Right. And I
look forward to continue
discussion and appreciate all that
we had. Um,
let's see. Representative,
uh, Lu Juan, you want to talk
about something else? And Senator Trujillo, you want
to talk about something else be before we
do. I just, I have to,
before I forget who you, who
you were complaining about having to stop to
charge your, your car
and where
9%.
So I have to figure out where to
go.
Ok. Well, this is a whole
different thing. I, I sat
here,
I, I sat here last
week with the Represent
Borrego who was complaining about the fact that there were
not enough charging stations in
Las Cruces. She said, I think there's
two high-speed charging
stations. I told Brandon, I
asked Brandon's permission. Where's
Brandon? It's here. I asked
Brandon's permission. So
Brandon bought a volt
uh about a week ago,
um was promised, look
at Janelle, she's laughing. Look, she
gonna, this is pretty funny. They're,
you know, they're together. So,
uh so he buys a
vault about a week
ago uh
with the idea that he's going to
drive down from Albuquerque to
Las Cruces.
Um thinking he could
do so
he had to
stop at
Socorro. First of all, for the first
charge, right?
And then had to stop in TRC
for the second charge.
Um He told
me that the price of the
electricity, it was it
in Trc
22 $22
to charge
kilowatt
38.
So it was Elephant Butte  Mr.
Chair and it was 21
kilowatt hours for
$22.
So more than a dollar a kilowatt
hour. So by
comparison, I'm, I'm nine
cents at home. So,
so I'm a little, uh a little
understanding for
Senator Trujillo
and for Brandon, all the brand
was on time. I'll just give him and
Janelle credit. They were on
time with two stops
on the way down here in their vault
and I'm sorry,
but whoever this
skewers Brandon tells me that
the they gave him like a nine day
right return
and it's going
back,
it is going back,  Mr.  Chair,
Mr.  Chair,
Mr.  Chair. I think, I think my
car.
Yeah. So has
advice for you on a vehicle that might
get you with maybe one
charge right
from a,
she can do it with one choice, but she can't get
from here to my house. It's about a mile
away after this
meeting. So she'll have to and I
could, I'm at 29%
is about 25 miles so I
could go, but
it's hot out there. I think my
car is trying to keep itself cool.
So it's using up
energy as I sit
here
this is when the plug-in hybrid
comes in.
Candy
Mr.  Chair.
Did I really step in it here? But
I, I thought we could use
after the last discussion,
I thought we could use a little
levity. So on,
on the subject of
our EV mandate, which
I'm told, I think the governor's
orders by next, by next year's
model year. 2026.
We have to, is it 2026? We have to
have 34%
of vehicles
2027 model year.
Ok. Sorry
Ferrari. We have an EV
also um
but there is a learning
curve. So I would
say don't give up.
Um There are
other charging stations like we
discovered. One that's right by the
mcdonald's at Tier
C the Elephant, but
one is more expensive if
you can even get it going.
Um But there are
other Tesla
adapters that
you can also get for the
fast charge. And in
Secor, besides in the
plaza where we had to stop
yesterday too,
um There are
good alternatives but
don't give up
anyone else on this
topic. And
you can probably guess
Mr.  Chair and Committee for the record.
I have not given up on EV.
Si will say that I have
given up on the bolt.
I would agree on that.
Yeah.
Iii I love,
I love the, the fact that
we don't have time to worry about these things.
I do not have time to worry about
these.
Uh I
want to put it out there is heed to
use
and then,
and then, uh,
represents
Lopez. I
just wanted to know if he was
interested in the used
Tesla.
You can talk to,
you can, you can talk to this. If
you all come over a little bit
and have a beer, you
might loosen up a little bit and you can talk
about es all you
want.
Let's see, Senator
Trujillo and then representative, thank
you. We
may have the same question
actually,  Mr.
Chair tomorrow
morning, it lists the
arbitrator status or it
sounds like we're not gonna do that
if we're coming in
at nine
instead of 830.
It does that mean we're not gonna hear
that. No, we're
not. Um And
again, I'll just be candid with all
of you. So part of the
reason why your agenda changes.
So we, we had an arbitrator's
report. I think they just got
in the press. I just read about it like
the last day or two,
right?
Did you hear yet? And it just
came out what, like the last couple of
days uh
for those who are following
Cyft closely, there's an
arbitrator, a very
esteemed, respected judge
whose job is to
hear reports
and national experts going
evaluate these things and his
reports. I, I think
I'm being kind and accurate says
reports have been damning.
Uh And I'm seeing heads
nodding when, who got this las
report? I have not read it yet when I read
the reports about they're damning.
I, I unilaterally
made the decision initially, I was
gonna hear that report and then realize
that we hear that report and then we're gonna go
out to CFD.
Um And with the idea that we're gonna
see good things CFD is doing, I
thought that those might be
counterproductive to
do that. So we will hear about
it at our next meeting
and, and with some time to
digest it a bit too,
we're gonna stay on top of CFD on
this committee. I assure you
that. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. I was
thinking that even if we were gonna
try to hear it in 30 minutes,
that was not gonna happen.
So I just thank you for
that.
Yeah,
II, I have to be
careful about this, but
I, I just love you guys. So I'll be
honest sometimes, sometimes
I'll put something on the agenda just to
like get your blood pressure
up, you know. So, I mean,
you know, you think I
didn't put the agenda at nine o'clock to
talk about the second amendment knowing all
the Republicans were gonna be down touring
at Otero County. You think
that wasn't a great time because I, I
kept you guys from coming like, yeah,
we told you. So uh
so you missed your
chance. Anyway,
represent
Luhan.
Thank you. Thank you  Mr.  Chair
for the time.
Um I just wanted
to, to touch on something
that uh and it has
to do with, you know, agenda
and scheduling and,
and, um,
we heard a lot of things over
the last agenda
and I apologize for not being here in
the morning. I'm, I'm an adviser,
advisory member, but
I did have a, a family
emergency, uh,
that I couldn't, I was, uh
nearby but I couldn't
make it here on time.
Um, but mister chair, what I really
wanted to, um,
address is as we
are looking towards
a special session
and this committee being tasked with
things. I sit now
on the, oh,
with the A OC uh
Behavioral Health Commission and we
just had our meeting
last, last week,
uh last Thursday
and I would, I would
um ask this committee
to really look at having
the A OC and
the HC A together
um present next
month before.
Um We're looking
to a special session
regarding
um
the competency that, that we
just passed, there
was on public record,
um, announced that some
recommendations have been
made. I don't feel
like I want to go into that
right now, but I feel like it would be
appropriate for them to sit in
front of us and talk to us about
some of those um
adaptations if you
will. Um
If we could start
those, those
um have those
addressed in the hearing and
perhaps addressed in the special
session? Thank you,  Mr.
Chen. No, it's a good
suggestion. It's,
it was a big lift. It
was a big bill, a lot of
effort and we're already realizing
that we didn't get it perfectly right.
And that's
Mr.  Chair, to your point of
how things work in the
legislature, or we're
looking at, uh, different
types of amendments in the different
chambers and all the
things and it's
um, much to the credit of those
who have been working on this legislation
that we tried to get it
completely. Right. But it's a
hard, it's all. Anything
we do is hard and we're under
different um constructs
in each, you know, through the process.
So to your point
I made earlier, thank you.
I, I think representative anything we do that's
meaningful, it's gonna be hard.
If you, if you, if you want, you can
carry a license plate, uh piece
of legislation. I think
those are, those
are,
I mean, not so. All
right. Uh Who else did I
did? I have
everybody, anybody
else,  Mr.
Chairman? Yes.
Oh, the,
the, I want to talk
about the agenda real quick.
Yeah, the problem with changing the
agenda on the fly. We have a
member of the public that drove all the
way down from Albuquerque
and out of her
own pocket paid for the
trip, booked a
room
expecting the
CYFD issue to be on
the agenda.
<She is> out of pocket
drove all the way down here for
enough the
agenda was put on the
website. That's where she
got the information.
And now we have a member of the public
here
or nothing.
So I understand your,
I, I understand your reasoning
for, for changes
sometimes. But now
we have a member of the public that we
serve
and, and without
the ability to
uh be able to interact
with this. So
I just wanted to mention
that it, it is
bothersome when it
affects real people.
You know, if, if I get in
trouble for not showing up to a committee
because I went on a tour.
That's one thing.
We have a member of the public
now
and I just, I
needed to, I needed to
make that come.
It, it's fair and it's well
taken. It is and I respect
that and I, and my apologies
to anybody who does that. And I, I think
that's a good reason for us to maybe, may
maybe me alter
my, uh sometimes
uh
shorter notice on some of these
agenda items. So that, that's
very fair. Um
So it, I, my
apologies that this,
um,
this sometimes happens, you all
know, know this too. All too. Well,
we think end up with things on
our agendas in the legislature,
recession bills. We heard
things get cancelled, but I can do
better. I, I can do better
about that. All
right. Um, other,
other subjects.
Anybody else? No.
Uh, hopefully Nancy
has got you an address
for me again. I,
I, we need to approve some minutes,
please. Can we have a motion
to approve the
minutes.
Thank you, Representative Hall
with a motion to approve this
and a second, is there any
objection?
The minutes have been approved? I do
encourage everyone to, uh,
dress a little cool
and, and please come, I
know that there's other commitments and
there's HBO in your
rooms and so forth. But, um,
it's a good
chance to hopefully
get to know one another better.
I think that's essential to what we do.
So, hopefully you'll see it
630 we'll have
dinner. All right. Thank
you. 630.
Yes. 630.
