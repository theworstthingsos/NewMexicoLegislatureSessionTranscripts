process of fully, fully
developed plans that would
have put some restrictions or or
required major revisions to the
the design, but yes, sir, this
is, this is the point, I think,
is that it's very disappointing
that we have a project that
we're
was awarded in 2020 and
uh, it, it just seems like this
is 5 years to construction
documents yet, and that is um it
does implications.
but I really think that the
district needs to recognize it,
that when they get an award
this has to move forward in a
timely manner, and it just feels
like to me,
this one's
been
turning around for 5 years.
That's just, in my mind,
inappropriate.
Thank you.
Chair members, if I may, uh,
there's been some discussion
about our MOUs.
and as we are making these
changes.
when we come out with a new MOU.
The intention is for
each of the school district.
uh, come in, have a meeting to
go discuss those implications
and try and make sure that we
have a solid plan moving
forward.
Uh,
