Committee. We're very
honored to be here
and very appreciative that you
all took the time to come here as
well. So, with
that, why don't we have the committee
introduce themselves and we'll start
over there with uh my colleague,

OK. Well, thank you everyone
again and uh thank
you to the staff for putting together a great
agenda and all the preparations. And
thank you to you and M as well
for the really gracious
accommodations this morning. It's
great. Um So
we will uh get going
with Secretary Kenney in our
first agenda
item
per and poly
fluoro laal
substances also
known as
PFAS
secretary of the floor. Is yours
when you're
ready,
Mr.  Chair.
Thank you. And
thank you to the members of the committee
JD Nance who
worked is working a
lot on
uh phos related
issues and is giving the
next presentation on
um Kirtland.
I invited him to sit with us
in, in the event that
you have questions that maybe are
better for him to answer.
Um But  Mr.  Chair members of the
committee, I think, uh,
really proud to be
here and talk to you about this
topic because each one of
you, um,
spent
probably too
much of your last session,
seeing my face in your
office and
I some more than others. Uh,
but again, I, I really
do appreciate the work that
you all do and, and
that you got us to this point
that we could be here in front of you talking
about this topic.
Um You
have a slide deck in front of you
and that's also on
the legislature's website,
as well as the environment department's
website. You
also have a
recently
published uh
study that we did, which
we'll get to, but I wanted to give you
a, a hard copy of
it. Um as we're
providing those to all legislators
and, and folks around the country who
are asking for that very
interesting study that we
did. Um
Mr.  chair, the, the
members of the committee.
The way I broke down the slide
deck for you this morning is
just two
parts, uh three
topics and
it's a very short slide deck.
But the focus is
part one preventing
PFAS exposure.
That is the House bill
212 that was signed into
law this past Spring
and the Hazardous Waste Act
amendments that were also
signed into law this
past spring. Both
of these work together
to keep pfas out of our
economy, out of our drinking
water. Out of people's
bodies.
The second
part of the presentation.
And again, I'm on slide
two is
uh talking
about managing
pfas exposures in New
Mexico. So
you have that uh
PFAS blood testing project report
that we'll talk about. And
then I was going to give you an update
on the Air Force
litigation
with the state of New
Mexico.
So with that, uh
moving to
slide three, which is
the PFAS Protection Act
House Bill 212
in a nutshell, the
way we passed that
bill, um other
states have done
iterations of
a consumer
product um
protection.
Um And ours
is really
a comprehensive
approach and,
and at the time I did not
realize this, but we are now
the third state in the
country to have these
protections locked
in various states
have different versions.
So there might be
some related to juvenile products,
there might be some related to cookware,
but we comprehensively
have sort of taken
the best around the country and put it
into one bill. And now we're the
third state. Uh We
have labelling requirements
that are under way right
now, meaning
that we're putting those rules
together to explain
what products will
contain pfas.
Um We have reporting
requirements that these again
will be based on
manufacturers of
these products that
will be coming into
the
uh state of New Mexico.
Um We have currently
unavoidable use
rule that we're working
on that will
establish uh
how manufacturers
of products could seek
exemptions if
we did not exempt them
already. And
then third or last,
we have enforcement
penalties and fees that we
will be putting into rules.
Well,  Mr.  Chair, I'm a
little remiss that uh two
of the key members of passing
House Bill 212 are sitting right
in front of me and I didn't thank you
specifically. Um
So Vice Chair
Ferrari, um
actually
Representative Seinan was
signed on to that bill. Uh
chair
yourself was
on that bill.
And if I'm forgetting
anybody, I would ask you to speak
up. But thank
you. I know there's others who did
sign on that are not here. But again,
thank you for your leadership and
allowing us to work so
closely with you during the
last session.
So those four rules are
coming forward. We'll have a
stakeholder process by
which we put them out for
public comment. Before we
bring them to the Environmental Improvement
Board. If you remember,
the Environment Department seldom
adopts its own rules,
meaning other state
agencies, they, the secretary
can adopt a rule that is
not the construct under
state law for the
Environment Department. So we'll be
bringing those rules to the
Environmental Improvement
Board and then they will decide
what the final rules
are
and hopefully adopt those. So
if you look at the next slide, you'll
see a little timeline there.
Uh All those draft rules are
coming uh should be
out in the
month of September, which we're
now in.
Um and then we
hope to petition the EIB
by October 30th
and then have the rules summer
f uh finalized
by summer of 2026
which would give us about six
months before the first
round of
uh protections
go into effect January
2027
with that  Mr.  Chair, I'm going to move,
going to move on to the
hazardous Waste Act
amendments.
This was again
Mr.  Chair, thank you for your
support on the Senate side
here in bringing this
bill to the floor and getting
it through committee and Representative
Chandler who, who worked
on it from the house side,
but the has Waste Act amendments.
We did something that the federal
government and the US Congress
have not been able to do.
And in fact, I've been
to the hill
multiple times now to
explain what we did. We have the
attention of both the majority and
the minority and
both asking how did
you do what you did in your legislative
session? And I, I
mean,
there's a point of pride there that
I think we, we can show in New
Mexico that we can thread
a needle and still
have a, a law
that works well
for the state, but could
be a model
nationally.
And what we did in that
was we listed a
triple F or a quiz
film forming foams, firefighting
foams containing PFAS as a
hazardous waste.
What we also did was
give an exemption
to the agricultural
sector so that they're
held harmless from the
impact that is affecting
them. That is
something this sort of notion
of a passive receiver
that is, has really gummed
up the federal
system. And
we, we did that here because
we're all about solving
problems that are affecting our
communities as opposed to sort
of debating the theory
around what if
scenarios.
So we did that.
Um
And this, this
law authorizes us
to bring additional rules to the
eib. Um
My colleague right here JD
is going to be the one doing
that. Uh The, the
other thing we did which was
really smart on, on J
D's part was
to lock into
law that, that
anything that's a hazardous
waste today will
continue to be a hazardous waste
into the future unless you
all change that.
So in other words, what we did is we
preserved hazardous
waste in the state of New Mexico
that we deemed federally
and then we added a
triple F.
So if you go to the
timeline here
again, we hope
to have draft rules
available for the public to
review in the uh
September October
timeline petition
the EIB in the winter and then
finalize the rules in the fall.
So a little bit behind the other
rule, but we're moving
forward on that.
Um These rules will
help us inventory
where uh
firefighting foams
are in the state of New Mexico that
have not been deployed,
meaning they're not used
yet. Uh We'll
develop a, a statewide
inventory. Um
We'll focus
on the characterization
and treatment ultimately,
the disposal of
those.
Um And
it will integrate
these rules into our existing
broader framework of hazardous
waste protections for the
State of New Mexico. I
I will also note that
sometimes when we pass a law
that we all don't think
of the unintended consequences and
they're not always bad
upon passing this law,
we had multiple
technology companies
reach out to us and say
now that you are very clear
about what is a hazardous waste in
the state of New Mexico. I know
Representative Block you asked about
this as well. I think at one
hearing
um
we, we are
incenting the
technology being developed
in the state of New Mexico, the
manufacturing of that equipment
being developed in New Mexico
and people wanting to
come into the state to
help us treat the problems
that we have. So again,
not all unintended
consequences are bad here. This
is a really good one for us
to uh to work
on here together.
Uh  Mr.  Chair, as I start to
get ready to wrap up here,
moving on to now our
reactions. Uh What
are we doing to protect communities
that have been exposed?
I really proud
that in 2019,
then Secretary Konkol
at the health department and I
talked about getting a grant to
do exactly what we
wound up doing. Uh
what 56 years
later, which was
this PFAS blood testing
report in Curry
County. So
we didn't get that grant. And what we
decided to do was
self fund
this study out of the
environment department with
Doh as a partner
and what
we did in a nutshell
which you may know about by now.
But in a nutshell is
we went to Curry
County, sat
in kitchens, living rooms,
dens, family rooms,
public meetings,
coffee shops, chipotle
wherever people
wanted to meet. And we
talked to them about
what are their concerns
related to PFAS
exposure.
Um
They had stories that
merited. Uh We
take a deeper dive.
Uh stories that are
anecdotal about
cancers and other health
elements, stories
about their time working
off base,
maybe they were asked by the
Air Force, could you crush
concrete for us? Could you do
something for us?
Um So stories
just came out and and
we then decided this is
the right thing to do that. We fund
this study and we,
we let people
volunteered to be part
of it. Um
What it wound up
showing.
There's some interesting
statistics there on,
on the right hand side of the
slide with 1000 and 85
calls. Um,
724
appointments,
638 actual
blood samples, but only
628 analyzed
because of other
technicalities. And
we looked for 33
different phos chemicals
in everybody's blood
plasma.
Um
And what we found was
that 99.7%
of the participants
had PFAS in
their blood. Not terribly
shocking. I'm sure that's
true of all of us right now,
right, that we all have
this kind of level of uh the,
this kind of hit rate
of pfas in our
blood. What is a little
bit more shocking is on the next
slide and
what we found was
the types of pfas
that was, that were
in people had
what I'll call a fingerprint
for firefighting foams.
So that is a little bit
more interesting
in, in terms of
uh what is
what we were seeing in
people. Uh We
saw that
uh one type
of PFAS was 3.23
0.2 times higher than the
national average. The
PPFHXSPF
OS was 2.2 times
higher than other participants
and 26%
in the national
highest concentration
tier for PFAS.
So
basically, when you compare
it to the, the the
population
uh of that
participated here
to the studies that have
occurred nationally,
those national studies
are about 10 years old.
Now there are new
CDC studies that are
coming out
this month, August September
time frame, which we
plan to take our data
set and compare it to those
new data sets.
It could mean
the national trend tends to be, people
are more educated, making
better choices and consumer
manufacturers are
removing PFAS.
So we
expect the national data to
be going down. But the new Mexico
data may be standing
out more
when we compare it to those
new national data
sets.
Um With that
Mr.  Chair, I'm just going to quickly
touch on what
there's one more slide on the
PFAS blood testing project. I
apologize.
Um
This is our next steps
with respect to this. And
I've been asked now if we
could do this for uranium mining
communities, if we could do this for
oil and gas communities.
Um We've we've
committed that we'll continue to
work on the Lake Hollomon
Holloman Air Force Base
issues um
with a similar type study,
but maybe a little bit different in the way
we push it
out. But I
think this is a great metric
for how doh
and environment can do a little
bit more grassroots community
work to validate whether there
is a problem and come to the
legislature and seek
a, a more partnering
response about how
we can better react
to community
exposures.
But in terms of the next steps
for NMED,
um we have
uh through capital outlay,
there's about a $12 million
appropriation to
connect rural Curry County
to the
public water supply, which
we're working to get that out
to um the
recipient there in Curry
County. We have about
a $2 million appropriation
that we're working to figure out a way
to get people who
are on well water
but have had the promise
but the failure of the Department of
Defense to buy them filters
and maintain them. We are
working to do that
for them.
Um So
we, we're working with the funding
that you've all appropriated to figure
that out. Uh Again,
we're going to look at Holloman
Air Force Base as well
and we are going to continue
to be in a groundwater
war and a public health
war with the Department of Defense,
which I will note that they launched
against the State of New Mexico in
the next slide
uh Doh is
continuing
to educate
medical professionals in the
area so that they have a better
understanding on how to screen and
address exposures,
educating those providers
so that they understand what the
current science is and what the current
medical modalities of
intervention require.
Um And then we're all
co-hosted a meeting
in Clovis on October
23rd to
really again, sit down a kitchen
table, we'll sit down together with the
public and then offer that
opportunity to talk
again.
Last slide here,  Mr.  chair
members of the committee
is um again,
a little bit about the update. Some
of this, I can't go into much
more detail because we're
in ongoing
litigation.
But if you remember back in
January of 2019,
I was about five days into my job
when a federal lawsuit was launched
against the State of New Mexico
saying that New Mexico did not
have the right to
require cleanup
of PFAS under state law
and under federal law.
Um That's still been, that's
that litigation is still
being worked out. We are
in the 10th circuit. We're expecting
a decision on
our permitting authority at the
Environment Department.
Of course, every side
would say this, but we feel very
confident that we're going to
have a favourable
outcome there
that those oral arguments
were briefed up in March and
we're waiting for that decision. That's
the left hand side,
that's Department
of Defense versus New Mexico
Air Force versus New
Mexico.
We then sued
the Department
of the Air Force. That's the right hand
side of slide.
10,
we were put into
a multi district litigation
about four or 500 cases
in South Carolina in federal
court. We
are a bellwether
case there. So we're one
of the top four cases.
We're waiting for
some motions practice
if you will to get
a judgment
there. Um
But we feel very good
that, that
the relief that we're
seeking in terms
of monetary damage
will be awarded to the
State of New Mexico
and that there will
be some remedial action. We're
very, there's
so many people in this lawsuit, but
the fact that we're one of the top four
bellwethers, um
Both New Mexico
is a bellwether as well
as Art Scops case,
the Highlander case. So the top
two bellwethers are
related cases
and that's to figure out
exactly if they are the test
cases, then how will all the other
cases resolve? I've
been flying to South
Carolina to attend
those hearings
myself and with our
team with the New Mexico Department
of Justice, who's been a great partner
with us on this
a with
that  Mr.  Chair, I just gave you
a lot of information
about what takes
up. I would say
at least
30 to
40% of my work
week um every,
every week. And I hear
JD somewhat laughing because
he probably thinks with the amount of
time I'm calling him it might be
more. Um
but I, I just
want to stress to you that we
are absolutely
both at the forefront
of what's happening
nationally with the
laws you pa helped us get
passed. And
we are also at the
forefront being the only
state in the country that is
this litigated
against and in
so much litigation around
these four
little letters.
So with that  Mr.  Chair, thank you for
your time and look
forward to hearing your questions.
Thank you,  Mr.  Secretary. Were you going to
say anything? Did you want
to say? No, I think
the secretary covered everything
on that topic. Sounds
good. Secretary before
you're done. And we asked
question, would you for the new
members just
briefly describe
what happened in Clovis
with  Mr.
and what got us to this
point? Yeah,  Mr.
Chair um for,
for you and the members,
members of the public even
uh the
or in about
2017
was when the
science was really starting
to come in. Uh
and, and show
that the Air
Force needed to do something
about the contamination
around
its
uh 600
some odd bases uh
around the country.
I can't remember the exact
number.
Uh
We
found that
the levels of
con the levels of
pfas in
Curry County
under and around the
base were
about 26,000
parts per
trillion.
All you need to know. Don't worry about
the parts per trillion. All you need to know
is that the standard is now
four from a scientific
standpoint, the new administration
has validated that
pushed out the implementation a
little bit but four
is where the scientists say it should
be. It's
26,000
is the, is what we're seeing in the
groundwater there. Uh
Art scops
cows, the dairy
cows in that
area that
provide milk to
Southwest Cheese,
the North America's
largest cheese
plant.
Um We're
testing positive
for PHOS
exposure
that
PFAS and their milk product
could not go to Southwest
Cheese. Those dairy cows
are kept alive
with work from uh
Secretary Whitty at
and um N MS
U as well
or N MD A as well
as um,
the US Department of Agriculture
got involved and we were trying to figure
out if we
keep those cows alive long
enough will the PHOS
levels come down? It didn't
happen. So we had
to use our hazardous
waste emergency fund
to euthanize and help
compost those cows
on site. They're still there.
Uh 3600
cows were euthanized
and um composted
on his property
so that plume is now
moved four miles off
base. I do
admit that since that
has happened, the
air Force has installed
two treatment
units on
base. The plume
that has moved off base is
now still
unchecked, uncontrolled.
Um And there is
another farmer there
who has installed a million
dollar pfas treatment
system to remove
PFA. So his cows
are protected. So we feel that
the cow sit, the dairy
situation is under
control. Um
What was not under control
was how
was water was
PFAS contamination getting
into the public and private
drinking water system.
The public drinking water
system, there is one well out
of 80 that tested positive
for pfos and that well was
shut in so
that they can, they're not
pulling from it. So the public water
system is deemed safe that
way. And then there's a
host of people are on
private uh well,
water and those private
wells range from detects to
non detects but
significantly high in some
cases um
people, uh I remember
specifically an elderly
couple mentioning to me
that uh they lost
their property value to pass
on to their Children. So there's
real, there's
real harm in terms of
people's uh socioeconomic
uh as well as health
issues.
Um
So
again, just
as a, as a reminder,
uh anyone could come into
the state of New Mexico into
the Environment Department and say
we can test our
permit and
there's an administrative process
for that. We
were the, the only
recipients in the country
that I know of, of a
federal lawsuit.
So we are still
embroiled in about now,
I would estimate about
$24 million
in terms of money that you've
appropriated to us that is
both
um
investigating
and understanding the
plume while the Department
of Defense has done
no investment
to clean up
one drop of pfas that got
off the fence
line.
Yeah. Ok. Committee.
Do you have questions
or?
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank
you, secretary. I feel like it's
Groundhog Day with you all the time.
It's like you're always here in this
committee. That's good.
You do a great presentation. So I'll give you
that.
Um I do
have some questions on this
because we're trying to
represent block. And I were quickly trying to
go through the study and there's quite
a bit in there. We're kind of
geeky nerds over
here nering out on
the data. So
I have some questions
when we did this
study.
I'm, I'm concerned about the mean,
if we did this study
and we have a national
average of act, let's say t I'll
just pull a number but this
came out 20.
Did we have military
personnel that were in that study
or were they excluded? Because they could
drastically affect
the mean
if we had a bunch that
had a higher level and we
went, maybe theres was four
and then we went to 20 because we
put these military folks in
there as
well.
I'll turn this off. I remember to do
that,  Mr.  Chair
and representative.
It's a good question
there, there in
the back of the study, you will see
the data
related to a health
assessment questionnaire
that we asked.
And in that questionnaire,
you will see that we asked
individuals if you
have military,
are you part of the
military? And then
are you involved
with firefighting
with respect to the military?
So we try to nuance
out.
Are you a member of the public?
Are you a member of the military?
Are you a member of the
a smaller sect
of military who has
firefighting responsibilities?
So, so that was then
statistically
um
standardized if you
will to, to come up with
the facts and figures we're
presenting. OK,
thank you,  Mr.  Chair
and thank you secretary. I'll have to
go back and read this because I need to know
where they listed as outliers.
Because if I had, if
I was looking for the national average
of a zip code of
income. And Bill
Gates actually lived in that zip code,
you know how that makes a huge difference. So I
will go back and read that because
there's, to me, I
want to make sure that there was a difference
between here's the military people
compared to other military people. And I
noticed on one
on page seven that
there really is no national
represented
representative pfa's blood
testing for
military.
So it looks like we
need to go kind of you, you
know, you're starting with the study, but we need a
bigger study that looks at
all of the bases,
does samples at the bases.
I don't know how easy that would be
because people have to volunteer
in lawsuits and all that stuff. But I feel
like we need a baseline of
these are people who are
on these bases. These
are people who work with that
foam versus
just civilians if that makes
sense. Were there, was there
questions also asked  Mr.  Chair
and, and
secretary about,
did you include questions
like, do you cook with
non-stick pandy? Ok. And
how do you go out to? Ok.
Sorry. I like the scientific
method. This is like I
get very excited because I like facts
and stats and data
and I just had questions on that.
Um I think the only course
I have for right now and I might have
more as we go along.
On when I looked at this booklet
on page seven,
you measured concentration for the
sum of seven pus
which is ep uh
the S
seven.
And then we looked at that and out of
the 622
algebra participants,
14 of them had this
serum. What does
that serum show
me? Is that a
different type that
comes from something specific?
Or or why were there 14
of these that only had this one
type of
pus
Mr.  chair and
representative could
you could you
just sorry? Number
five, number five
on page seven.
So  Mr.  Chair and
Representative
14
had
the
greater than 20 mcg
per liter.
And what that means is that
they those 14
as compared to
they fit into the
national
highest
concentration of PFAS
in their blood plasma.
Out of that 10 year old
study, they would be
at the the top of
the the
ranking and
Mr.  Chair and secretary would
do we know who those people are, where they
people just in the community in the
plume outside the plume with the people
that were military? Where
could I find? Oh, it
ac section 5.3.
OK. I'll go back and read that and
Mr.  Chair, let me just say
11 thing about
that so that none
of the members of the committee and
no one watching or in the
audience thinks that
this report
contains names or
personally identifiable
information uh
back while we were on
session in the March time
frame.
Uh February March
time frame, all of
the participants
who gave a
blood sample, received
their individual
results. I don't know
them. No one in my
department knows them.
Uh So we don't have any
way to correlate and
know unless somebody told
us, uh who,
who they are. Now,
the Department of Health has that
information because they are bound
by HIPAA requirements
and they can see that.
but we, we can't
and our contractor worked
with them on
sort of ensuring that there is a
blind process
by which the data was
aggregated in a
way that we don't have
resolution into that.
Um
So
they were also provided,
those individuals who participated,
were also provided
with the excuse
me with individual
information on
how they should approach
if they wanted to a medical
professional and then that they
had the opportunity to
speak with somebody
as well. So no,
I just want to assure you that nobody
was just mailed a
form letter
saying here are your results and, and,
and not given sort of
a, a walkthrough
on how better to understand
their results in context
of, of
speaking to their medical
provider.
Thank you,  Mr.
Chair and yes, absolutely. Thank you
for clarifying that because any time
you do a study, it's always
hopefully double blind
study, but at least should
have things like, you know, did you use
cookware? Military stuff like
that? Ok. That's what we're gonna,
nobody's names are shared and all
that.
Um
The other question I had
was
I did have another question here.
So on this
HB 212 that
passed,
the labelling requirements
require that most consumer products
containing intentionally
add a PFAS.
Well, quesos don't know, it's just
about everything. Holy smokes,
floss. You look at
everything, I mean,
cookware.
How do we
enforce that? And who
are we telling? And
how is this happening
to if
we're, if the whole goal is to inform
people, how is this
happening for this
bill that was passed? Because there's gonna be things
that we don't have regulation
on and there's gonna be things we can and how
do we enforce that, let's say
Walmart.
So  Mr.  Chair and
representative, so a
practicality
here. The good
news is, is um
Home Depot Lowe's
Home Goods, Dollar
Store, Dollar General
and so many others,
even fast food
establishments have
removed PFAS
from their products,
their shelves, et
cetera. So
many of us are probably
going into stores asking that
question. But the reality
is those stores are not selling
products containing PFAS.
So I just wanna set
that standard.
Um But I do agree with
you. It is in so many things that
we unintentionally bring into
our home. Uh
But in terms of the
labelling requirements,
they are, those labelling
requirements will be for the
manufacturer
at the time, they manufacture
the product and ship
it to uh the
state of New Mexico.
So the the
rule will be for those
manufacturers. Now,
how will we
check to see
if those are the, if a
product that doesn't have a, a
label on it is,
is correct.
Um We will
have a rule
that more or less
as the presumption of us
scanning the product
to look for
flooring,
which shouldn't sort of
normally be in the label
would be indicative
that that product may contain
a pfas and the product
should be labelled. And then
we'll be going back to those
manufacturers saying
you have to show
cause as to why
this product
does not contain
a, a label. When
we are establishing that it looks
like it does contain
pfos.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair
and thank you secretary because like
as we've gone through this, you
find it and everything, especially like
in water resistant
clothing. Um
So I'm just wondering how we're going to go
about that. I do like in Massachusetts,
they actually have a state that
tells you how to find pus
free articles in PFAS free
because I remember we were in one committee
and we all had our, our food delivered
from a certain place. I'm like, oh, look, we're
getting puss in the wrapper.
So, um,
I guess what I, what I'm concerned
about is making sure that
if this is what we're really doing,
if it's all about the people in our community,
that we're making sure
that they're aware and we might
even think about making a website
of how to look for those things, certain
keywords, stuff like that. And this is
all the places you can find it because
literally, it's just
about everything. OK. That's all I had miss.
Thank
you.
Thank you
Mr.  Chair. Thank you so
much. And that just
reminds me the other day I was, I was at the
store and I was going to buy this new
beautiful pan. It was like on
sale. It was an all clad and it
was, you know, super expensive and
pretty. And I
read the label and it said pest and
I said, no,
sorry, I'll stick
with my green pan. That's fine  Mr.
Chair.
But getting
serious here when it comes to
the study,
how much did this cost
at Canon? And then
how much would a similar study cost
at Holloman? And what
kind of population
are you seeking
for that sample at Hollomon
versus Canon? Because I
know they're all different
communities.
Yeah,  Mr.  Chair and, and Representative
Black, you're not the first one to tell me
that a similar story about a frying
pan situation.
So um even a
lobbyist stopped me at Costco
and told me that they were making a,
an, a more informed choice
now, which is, you know, I think
success in many
ways. But the,
the cost of the study
uh that
at
Cannon or around Cannon
was 1.2
million.
Um
There's costs in
there that are uh
heavy, heavy
costs associated
with hiring medical
professionals, ale
phlebotomist to pull
blood samples
um and
manage those
samples.
I don't think a
study at
Hale and Air Force
Base, given the
fact that the drinking water
there is not,
the groundwater is, the groundwater
is too salty.
Um
would have the same
sort of scope and
effect or the same sort of
approach um
here as we did in
Curry County. And
what that means is the cost
is we've mapped it out with our
consultant is about
$50,000.
I, if I'm recalling
correctly and
if I'm wrong with that number, I,
I will certainly follow back up with
you. But II I noted
how inexpensive it
was. And the, the
reason is because we wouldn't be
pulling blood
samples. We would
be asking individuals
if they recreated
at Lake Hollomon.
Back in 2019,
the New Mexico Attorney
General with the Environment Department
sought a preliminary
injunction to
close down Lake Hollomon from
Recreation. The Department
of Defense, the Air Force did not
do that. But then
since it was documented that they
have the world's highest
concentration of
pfas, um,
ever, ever, ever,
uh, published,
uh,
the uh
base has
closed access to Lake
Coloman. So
our goal would be
to establish for
both New Mexicans and those
who live around the country that
may have recreated it. Lake
Hollomon. How did
you enjoy it? Did you
hunt? Did you
um
camp, did you
use any of the water
there? And, and
then provide them with
recommendations based on
how they recreated
to, to then
better inform
themselves about PFAS blood
testing and speaking to
a medical provider.
So it's, it's, it's a different
style health
assessment. Um
one that is more survey
and response
oriented.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. And I guess I
would just ask following
up on that. How would we get that
information? How do we contact
these people because they could live
anywhere, you know, is it going to
be like a infomercial
camp Lejeune situation? You know
what I mean? Like all those
infomercials or is it going to be
something that's more of a,
a localized
approach? Uh
Mr.  Chair and
Representative. So it's a good
question. There are social
scientists that who work for
a consulting firm that we
have employed that can
look at,
uh you know, if you go to
trails.com, if you go
to all these camping and
boon docking, uh, websites.
You'll see that people have
said I spent a week at
Lake Holloman and
it's great
to, you know, enjoy
the campfire and, and maybe
paddle board or something.
I, uh,
so there's a
whole, not a whole group.
I don't want to make it sound like it's extensive,
but there's at least a few people that
were hiring to
look across both
social media,
um, websites,
et cetera and try to
establish
how, you know, who would
be the target for this.
So I think
both a regional
meaning New Mexico
and around surrounding States as
well as a national approach
to try to get people to
understand
again if they
and this isn't something that I like
hearing or saying. But if
they recreated
at the most
contaminated PFA
site in the world,
they should be aware of
that.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank you, Secretary
Kenny. So that's helpful.
I'd definitely be interested
in just seeing how you guys are doing
that because it seems
quite difficult
to be honest with you, but
cheap. So I'll take it 50
grand versus 1.2
million. Last question. I'm
gonna go to your page
41 on your
large report from
Canon with the blood
testing. And I thought it was really
interesting,
the fast food
consumption,
it caught my eye,
which I don't eat a lot
of fast food, but it might start after
reading that. No, just kidding.
But it does
say
the consumption had statistically
significant negative correlations
with PFOs serum levels.
In other words, participants who reported
eating fast food frequently
had lower pfos serum
levels. I mean, don't
tell that to Secretary
Kennedy up
in Washington.
But why, why do you think that
is
it, it, it's a good question
and caught our eye as
well. Um  Mr.  Chair and, and
Representative um
it could be that
individuals in the
area.
Um You know, it's, it's
a based community people are
in for uh shorter
durations and maybe
that had something to
do with it. But I think
it goes to the other point that
many fast food
establishments have
eliminated PFAS
from their
packaging.
So it could be that as
well. I'm not sure
that we'll ever get to the
bottom line as to
conclusively why that
is. But I, those
are the two factors
that shape
my understanding of
how, how this
could have occurred.
Thank you,  Mr.
Chairman.
And I guess
one moment,
please.
Thank you,  Mr.  Yeah, it's just a weird, it's a weird
point, you know. II, I
don't understand that, please.
Hopefully people are not listening to
this and thinking, I'm telling them to go to
mcdonald's, even though I
love a good mcmuffin once in a
while, but that's all I had
Mr.  Chair and, yeah,
I, I just find that to be very
strange. Thank
you.
Interesting. I think
your theory makes a lot of sense in
a way. I mean, if you're
getting your food
from fewer sources
that have eliminated that, then
you're going to have less exposure
than people who are getting
it from more individual
sources that may still have
pfas exposure. That would
be just  Mr.  Chair on
that point. It also does say that people
who didn't go out to
eat have a higher ratio. So now
it completely throws that right out of the
water.
Well, no, because that would, that
would support what I was just saying.
Yeah, but,
but my
opinion doesn't matter. So, all
right, moving on to Senator
Cillo Lopez.
Thank you. I was over here whispering.
Well, to me what that
shows is people who are
buying local
locally sourced
foods perhaps
are getting more because mcdonald's
sources
outside the,
the, you know, they're not
getting local meat,
local, um,
lettuce, whatever.
I don't know. I mean, the, these
kinds of this, this
I too love data.
Um And I'm so
happy when I read in the paper about
this report, I was just so
happy that this has been done.
I really wish that this like
people are asking you for the reports
in their areas. Um I
really wish that this was
done around all of the
areas in New Mexico that have these
toxic
chemicals
in in our environment
because people should be
aware. Um So
my, I have a few
kind of data focused questions
and then, and then some broader questions.
But on
page
41
because yeah, we just like we
developed a theory for, we're
developing a theory for the fast
food consumption. And my theory
is they're outside,
they're getting uh
uh food from outside
the area. Just a
theory. What, what
are um
this frequency of blood
donation?
Um
Serum levels are lower
for people who donate blood at least
once a year
is that because they're
getting rid of the PFAS and putting
in somebody else's body? And
what is this? That was
interesting to me? Yes,  Mr.
Chair and Senator Good
point about the locally sourced
food
and for those national
chains. But your
point is
the
way
the medical way in which
I understand people
can reduce their PFAS
levels is through blood
donation.
Um A
mother can
breastfeed their child
and reduce her
concentration of
pfas but
the recipient now is the
child. Um
so that those have
been I don't think they,
those are
medical,
those have been documented. I'll say
it that way. I don't know. It's a
little bit more than theoretical.
Correct.
Good. And
then is
there a theory for
the higher
concentrations in men?
Was it because more men
were exposed? I don't
know. That was interesting
to
Mr.  Chair and Senator.
I'd have to look back at the,
the
study to see
how many men versus women
participated.
But I don't have the
statistical finding, a
statistical
significance should have
adjusted for that.
So it's
just interesting.
True.
I'm, I'm not, I don't know that we
have a theory, a working theory
as to why that would be,
I think if you're down there
and you know, there's
in Curry County having spent
time there by no means, am I an
expert? But
in terms of what we see,
what I've seen working on
the dairy farms, you see more
men than women
working in the? Yeah.
OK. That makes
sense. That does make
sense. And,
and that nec wouldn't necessarily
have been adjusted
for.
OK. That, that's
interesting. I, like I said, data,
data is a lot of fun to
analyze and I enjoy
sort of developing theories for
these, these little
results, but the
bottom line
is
PFAS is bad for people.
And what, what this study
shows is higher
concentrations of pfas in
an area where we
know PFAS has been released
into the environment and
that I think is the big
picture finding. I
really appreciated that the
letters that you wrote,
um, said
things like, um,
you know, if you're pregnant,
make sure you're
um, II,
I thought, I,
I make sure that
you're, um,
um,
evaluated for
pret tomia, stuff like that.
I, now I'm not finding the letter
but I really,
um,
you, oh, here it
is.
Yeah. Reduce the National
Academy.
Yeah. The National Academy of
Science Engineering Medicine recommends a following
reduced ongoing PFAS
screening for high
cholesterol testing of
thyroid function.
Um I'm really
glad that
the individuals who had
the higher
rates of
PFAS got this information.
What kind of
um outreach
or information sharing do
we do for
everyone? Not
just people who got the letters, but
so that people can
make decisions like
Representative Block
did not to buy this band
that contains
PFAS.
So  Mr.  Chair and
Senator I, I want to
give you, you know, this,
I'm really proud of like our
team on this, by the
way,
letters like
you just read and
recommendations
like I'm picturing the woman who
came up to me and said I'm pregnant.
What should I be doing? Right?
So we're, we're not
doing this from Santa Fera Albuquerque.
We're in the community,
having the conversations
listening to their concerns and
trying to pull sign
to from,
from a journal
into a
practical way that we
can communicate with New
Mexicans. So to
your point, how are other New
Mexicans getting that same
outreach. We are,
we are constantly and just
today stood up our new
PFAS web page in
which this information,
the letters from the National
Academy of Sciences
and, and Medical providers.
The latest um
dare I say from the
CDC
is, is
we're pulling that information
together and synthesizing
it for
the communities
to, for New Mexico
communities to understand. We're
making sure we have limited English
proficiency, understand, you know,
letters um
and, and doing all of
that work, we,
we also want to sort
of launch a bigger outreach
campaign around
uh PFAS PFAS
exposure and what you can
practically, I think everybody
sort of is highlighting that.
What, what do I practically
do today? And
I think we should say, you
know, pick up your
cleaning supplies at Home Depot
or one of these stores
where you know, everything in there is phos
free if you're concerned about it.
However, if you go to,
you know, Lazyboy furniture,
Ashley furniture, if you go to a big
uh furniture,
Denver mattress,
don't
get the stain resistant
material. The bottle that I
kept bringing to every
session was
purchased this
year in
a retailer that
contains 50 times
more pfos than
the drinking water standard.
I don't think any of us would
consciously bring that into our
homes. But I think
working with the New Mexico
Chamber of Retailers
Association
and getting them up to speed
as well so that they
can be a good ambassador for
their, their brand, their product,
which will be
helpful. So we have a lot of work
ahead of us. Well, and I
hope the media does a lot of
PS A about it
and interviews you
because
first, people
don't even know what it is.
And then second, the health
impacts are
unknown and so many people
are just like, you know, there, I've
heard this, even in my own
family, there are so
many toxins in the, you
know, out there what's a little bit
more and I'm just like, oh my
God, there's a cumulative
effect and, you know,
I, I just
really, and anything I can do
to help, um, maybe
I'll post
a link to this report
and really publicize and
I hope we all do
because this is
excellent work, just
absolutely outstanding
work. And it's
really important for the public
health of, of people in our state.
And, you know, I just want to end
by complimenting you and your
department and everybody who worked on
it for this,
this really great work. Thank
you. Thank
you.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair and Senator. And I
just want to say that we have,
you know, with your help,
we have now appropriately paid our
individuals and we've hired
about 150 new
employees in the last
14 months, 15
months. We
have stellar
people at the environment department,
including this gentleman right next to me
who's newer
but not new anymore.
But again, it's,
it's, it's one
thing to have vision. It's
another thing for people
to implement it on a day to day
basis. And they've done a phenomenal
job. I couldn't agree with you more.
Well, not to get to,
I don't know, it's, I
know that there are a lot of people
from the Federal government looking
for jobs in the state government. So
I think the pool was
strong, very strong at
this time. Thank you,  Mr.
Chair and again,
thank you for this. Excellent.
Thank you, Senator
Thorton.
Thank you  Mr.
Chair.
So I'm new to this committee
and new to the
legislature as a matter of fact. So,
so I appreciate your report
and, and, and all the work that you
guys have put into this. It's
been
enlightening.
So I just have some basic questions
that I, I would like to get
sort of a better understanding
of. So I understand
that phos is one of those things
that, you know, has some health issues
that can bring health issues. And
it says that there
you mentioned in your report
here, you talked about increased cancer
risk, immune system suppression,
elevated cholesterol, you
know, and but, and it actually
accumulates in the body so it doesn't
get excreted.
Um So
understanding that
my question to you is what is the
minimum exposure
to pfas that the public
should
be allowed to be exposed
to? So
what is that number? I mean,
obviously zero would
be the absolute possible. But
is that realistic? And
so my question to you is what is the
minimum exposure that the
public should be exposed
to?
Yeah,  Mr.  Chair and Senator.
Um that's a great question
and it's, it's, it's a tough
one to answer. I'm not in any
way trying to, to dodge it
or um you
know, want to take it head on. I,
I think what I've
always said to our,
and in our department is
we need to chase the risk.
We need to figure out where the
greatest risk is occurring
and minimize it from
there. I think
many people would say there's
no acceptable risk
level for PFAS. I'm
a little bit more pragmatic
saying that it's a forever chemical.
It's gonna be hard to get out of the
environment and our
risk is always going to
be something greater
than zero.
So let me just give you this
sort of example
that the drinking
water in
Curry, Curry County
where around the base is
650,000%
greater than the
safe drinking Water Act standard.
So I think if we're minimizing
the risk there,
while we're, you know,
Lasana has some
concerns about PFAS, I'm
not negating
it, but the, the concentration
is much closer,
not magnitudes higher to the
drinking water standard.
So all of our
resources at the, the
department are kind of focusing
on greatest risk and then
kind of concentrically
trying to manage from
there. So I
don't know what the I'm not an
epidemiologist or
toxicologist.
Um So I'm not sure
that I could give you
what the numeric
value is for all New
Mexicans. Um
But I think we have to,
again focus on firefighters,
firefighting foams.
Um We're
fortunate that we don't
have a chemical
manufacturer in the state. Of New
Mexico is making it
or I'd be focusing on those
workers as well.
But I think we have to go, where's
the biggest risk? Where are people
getting exposed?
Um You may have heard my story
and I won't go into the whole thing, but we
were someone tried to sell
us at a big box furniture store,
a stain room, stain
uh for a piece
of furniture we were buying.
Uh then we went, I went
over and
with my team and we saw like
high school kids applying it. I
think that's another place where
we have to kind of
think about.
Are we sending fif
1617, 18 year
<Olds> into? I know how I
was, I wasn't very responsible
at that age either.
Um I don't
think I would have taken
the right precautions and probably have
been exposed. So I think that's
where my head is, is
minimize exposures
and manage the biggest risk.
First.
Thank you for that
Mr.  Secretary II.
I agree with you. My
only concern is that
unless we have a target
number that we're shooting for,
we can sometimes get
so overly focused on
eliminating it completely
to the point where it
becomes nonsensical.
In other words, there, you know, you can
never get to zero. And
so I have the same
issue with carbon dioxide by the way.
So that's another
conversation.
So, um
secondly, you mentioned
that the the chemicals that were
discovered were linked to the
firefighting foams and, and I'm
assuming that they have a unique
signature that allows you to
determine that that's as
opposed to coming from somewhere,
somewhere else.
Um May,
maybe that's the question. How
do you know for sure that, that,
that, that was linked to the firefighting
fos and not to some other source?
Yeah. So the, the four
chem  Mr.  chair and
Senator, it's a good question again.
Uh, the, the four
chemicals were
predominantly used in
firefighting foams
over the, the
years. Like
let's pick the past 25
years, they were either
predominantly the,
the chemical
used or they were the
replacement to the
chemical used.
Uh Many of those fos
many of the
PFAS of the four that we
identified, uh
they did, they stopped
manufacturing those in
like 1999
2000 in,
in the United States.
Um It doesn't mean that they're
not in chemical warehouses
being redistributed
out still like
they're still a stockpile.
Um And then when you look at
those four
chemicals as
compared and in
combination with each other. So
each individual has
a yes, it
was used in firefighting films
and other things.
And then when you look at those
four together,
they form their own
fingerprint
as
well.
Thank you for that  Mr.  Chair.
I have another
question and I
think this is with regards
to the litigation that's
ongoing.
Um
You had mentioned that there, this
federal suit that's going on between
whether it's a state or federal.
Uh, and, and
it assumes that you're
gonna, you're feeling pretty
confident you guys are going to win this case.
But my question to you is
how will New Mexico respond
if we, if the court decides
that it is a federal issue and
not a state
issue?
So,  Mr.  Chair and
Senator, if the court
were to say this is a
federal issue,
I think that it would
be interesting because we
have federal authority
in New Mexico to
implement the, the
federal hazard.
So Congress writes
the rules and I'm not trying to do
a one on one here, but Congress
uh you know, wrote
the hazardous waste
law, epa administers
it. We, in the
eighties nineties asked
EPA for the authority
to be equivalent
to or implement
the federal law here
in the State of New Mexico.
So if, if the
court were to say
this is a, uh
this is subject
to the federal
re what's called the Resource
Conservation and Recovery
Act, they would be
affirming that our
arguments are
correct. So,
um because we said
we are acting on behalf of the
EPA administrator
in running this hazardous
waste program.
Um So what they would have to
say what the court would
theoretically have to say, I'm an
engineer, not a lawyer. Let me
disclose uh  Mr.
Chair and Senator
is, they would have to say that
Congress got it
wrong.
They would have to, the court would
have to say Congress
was incorrect
in its lawmaking authority
to give states
the ability to implement the
federal law. That
would be, I think
a long that I
think that would, is,
is a very low
probability outcome.
Given
the nature of most of the
environmental laws we implement
at the Environment Department
derive
from a federal
authority. Very, very few
actually
are solely like HB
212 now is solely
a state law. But
everything around HB
140
is us
affirming to
the Department of
Defense that
we are actually doing
what Congress intended.
And, and I think it's a really
strong point that,
that I'm making you're
making is that you
have an executive agency,
the Department of the Air
Force
stating
that they are not going
to follow federal law
and sue the state
to say the state doesn't have
a right to
follow congressional
law. I mean, this is the upside
down as far as I'm
concerned.
Thank you for that. That's a
good clarification
and I appreciate your, I,
I appreciate that
clarification. That's all I
have Mister Chair. Thank you for your
answers.
You,
ok, Senator
Po,
thank you,  Mr.  Chair and thank
you, Secretary Kenny
for the presentation and,
and the
testing and this
uh report.
Um, just wanna touch on a few
things I think of you that were brought
up. And so
I know we had a, you had
a larger number. It looks
like 724
blood test appointments. And
ended up being
626
628 eligible,
I guess. How did you kind of come up
with that number in, in your
analysis? And where did, how did
you kind of get there? And what was it
meant? Yeah,
Mr.   Mr.  Chair
and Senator,
um,
we did three rounds.
The first two basically
sold out. The third one didn't sell
out as quickly.
Um, and
if, if individuals
could not produce,
if, if they were not of a certain
age, I think 18.
And if they were not
living in living or
working or have lived or
have worked in the area, they
were excluded
and they typically brought a driver's
license, utility bill, et
cetera if they made
it through that first
round. And
we later found
out that they
were not eligible to
participate, then
that, that also relates
to the difference. Some people
walked in  Mr.  Chair and, and
Senator and said, I'm interested,
did the health questionnaire maybe
saw a needle and said, wait a minute, I'm not
that interested any longer.
Um as well. So,
uh but generally most people
kept their appointments and went all the way
through.
Thank you  Mr.  Chair and thank you  Mr.
Secretary and just
wanted to ask
to,
you know, you have community
members that live near, that
could have been exposed. You have
military members, but a lot of
times they're leaving every
34 years and you have those
air force civilians that could
be there 1020
years and be
exposed.
Were there also any
barriers to making sure
just people that live in the community? And
I guess what I'm really touching on
what if you were a
undocumented
person or do
recipient, were you eligible
for this blood testing as well? I just
think it's important that we're
taking care of everyone in our community
on this exposure.
Yeah,  Mr.  Chair and
Senator again,
it wasn't that you had to have a driver's
license. If you had a utility
bill, if you could produce
some evidence that you
were part of
this effectively
kind of a four mile radius,
you could participate.
We also had again,
limited English proficiency
translation
opportunities available in
case somebody came in who was
maybe uh more
comfortable in a Spanish speaking
and then we talked them through the whole
questionnaire and the whole
appointment
in, in uh in
Spanish. So
um there is no
exclusion based
on uh
the, you know, DACA
or citizenship,
etcetera.
Thank you. I appreciate that. That's
good to hear. We just, just wanted
to clarify and make
sure um and then
I'll just end with pfos. I
know we've had this
debate the last few
years. Um
It's always an argument as if for
a while that this wasn't bad.
Now it's
always, it's at everything and
almost like we shouldn't do anything because
of that. Um I
know the minimum levels
I believe are four
parts per trillion
right now. Um I know
the question was just made, what, what
should be the limit? And
I think we want
to eliminate
it totally. I know that's
probably not
realistic but
um limiting the
exposure and products we
buy the food, we eat
what we're exposed to. Right.
Um I think
we need to just really try
to do our best. Um I'm
one of those people with the
chemistry background that
for me,
uh, it should be
zero exposure and,
and I, and I understand that
how do we get there walking
into an office and
understanding what's,
you know, coming
off the paint on the walls and,
you know, things like that and
Bo CS and everything else.
Um
Where
do you see that if you could touch
on that a little bit more?
Um Not, not to
answer the question of what the acceptable
level is,
but how
we are going about it in this
state with what we
passed in the
last session,
the testing that we're doing.
And do you think there's
anything else that we should
be doing further in our
state?
Mr.  Chair and
Senator
A, I
think if we
conclude that we
passed 212 and we're
done, we've thought about this
completely the wrong
way. I think what we
need to do is come back to
you in a science
based way, a
public health based
way every
session and,
and refine what we
did. We exempted
certain things.
Uh And,
and I believe you
addressed this on the floor,
we exempted certain
um, classifications
of pfas, either
out of their necessity
or their prevalence
or uh
their utility.
Um or
that the science for this next
class of pfos called
fluoro polymers
is not totally
understood. Now, there will be
people who tell me just
because you don't understand. It doesn't mean we
don't. Um
we, we, we do not
have at the Environment
Department, an office
of Research and development. If you
will, we, we
contract to do a lot of
that work. Um We
listen to a lot of people and we
try to make the best policy
decisions. We felt it was
more important to move than
to stand still. And we did that
and I'm very proud
of what we passed.
But again, I think to your
point, we should
be following the science
and the risk in New Mexico.
We're doing our part. We've
tested uh landfill
Leche to see what
Phos are in that
liquid coming out of the
landfill. And
we're going to make some
good decisions based on
that, but we
may need to come
back
again with a science
derived
proposal to modify
HB 212 to
address new
exposures and understanding
of the, of the chemistry.
Um But again, I, I
really do want to stress that
if we just as
this administration
finishes up,
it should be the beginning
of our discussion as a state
on PFAS, not the
end.
Thank you  Mr.  Chair and thank you
Mr.  Secretary. I think
you laid out there's still
some unknowns
and I still believe there's going
to be some costs
when I say costs of
getting that data
clean up. But also the
cost of how do we help people
that have been impacted in our
state? That's
all I have. Thank you,  Mr.  Chen.
Thank you Vice Chair
Ferrari.
Thank you  Mr.  Chair and thank you
Mr.  Secretary
for always
fighting so hard
for New Mexicans
and, and your team
JD and Zack and
everyone else that did
such a great job. Um
I was wondering um
when you mentioned about the blood,
you know, people might go
and uh
donate blood more.
Should there be a warning label
for blood transfusion
recipients
there might be, be us in
this or it's minimal
enough,
Mr.  Jared and,
and Vice shared. Uh,
thank you for the question. It's
I, that there's never a time
we're talking about PFAS that
someone doesn't sort of throw me a
question that
just gets me more worried
or thinking about what
to do next. But
I think, you know, we've
tried really hard to
get
the, the federal
and state veterans
service providers
to do routine
pfas testing of veterans.
Um, I don't think that's
established yet. I
think the routine, routine
testing of our
blood supply for
PFAS would be maybe
something to think
about. Uh, and
maybe there's willing partners
out there. It might not have to be
mandated by law or
rule, but it might, maybe it is
something we could think
about going forward.
Um, and I think for those who
are in a life, I, and being
practical, I think those who are in
a life
emergency situation and
need a transfusion,
I can personally say I'd rather
have blood with pfos in it
than no blood at all.
Um,
but that said, I
think you're, you're
thinking in a way that's
protective of public health
and I'll, it,
it's something for us to talk about
within the administration a little further.
So, thank you.
Sure. It just
as that was brought up.
Um, also,
um,
have you thought about having
a hotline or do you already
have something like that for people
to call. Yeah,
madam
chair and madam vice
chair, we stood up
575
P FA P
FA as
a hotline
that we've now kept.
Um, and that is
a, we set that up
for the blood testing and it's something
that we've decided to
maintain, uh,
going forward
for uh
pfos related
purposes.
I am personally not sure what would
happen if you call it right now.
Um, but it is something
that we retained that number
for because it was
popular and we
wanted to
keep it at the department
for future use.
And  Mr.  Chair
and  Mr.  Secretary that's
575
P FA sp
fa
that P FS. Yes.
Do I have too many letters
in there?
Maybe it's,
maybe I'm misremembering
the number.
Um maybe it's
papas.
It's
57555757327.
Mr.  Chair representative
block just pointed to the front
page of our report
and it's 575575
P FA S.
Thank you. I didn't notice
that in the
picture.
Neither did I.
That's a wonderful report, by the
way. And  Mr.  Chair and  Mr.
Secretary
on HB
140 you
were talking about, you
know,
water
um for
agriculture
does
HB 140
you know, help
restrict
pfos contaminated
water or produced water
that we don't know,
but we're pretty
sure has pfos
in it. Um
Is that being restricted
from us being used on
agriculture?
Um  Mr.  Chair
and vice
chair So
you specifically said
produced water. Is that correct?
Yeah. Ok. Um So
mister chair and, and
vice chair, so you can't,
you cannot use
any produced
water off
lease.
Even if you say you
treat it, you still can't
use it off lease.
So it
140 doesn't
specifically
address
produced water
in any way, shape or form. It's
just firefighting foams
and holding ag
harmless,
um, produced
water would be
a WQ
uh uh yeah, water quality
control commission
rule that would have to be developed
for that
related to
PFAS
offsite
off of a lease
on
lease.
Sorry madam chair,  Mr.
chair and madam vice
chair. If I'm sort of
confusing this,
my worlds are colliding right
now. The
if you were to treat
produced water
for the purposes of using it
in oil and gas,
you would do that on lease and
that's not subject to the environment
department. If you were
to treat produced
water
and try to move it off lease,
that's currently not allowed in the state
of New Mexico.
And how you treat the produced
water for Phos would
be something that
the W QC C would
need to address
before that could
occur.
Um  Mr.  Chair,  Mr.
Secretary, but that seems to be
something they're trying to do
to expand that.
And would
this hb
140 help prevent
them from using
it because of the
Phos?
So
Mr.  Chair
and
madam Vice no
140 would not directly
allow would
not provide protections
in that way.
Um The Water Quality
Control Commission is taking up
a third-party petition
um from
the Water Alliance to, to
treat produced water
for the purposes of using it
off lease.
If that were to
occur,
then the New Mexico, then
there would have to be standards
placed in there for that to
happen. Addressing
things like
PFAS
140 would not be
OK.
And  Mr.  Chair and  Mr.
Secretary, I don't
see any standards being
uh
able to allow that.
It seems like, you know,
phos is phos it
forever and it goes into
the food supply
goes into people just like
we're finding from cookware.
So thank you,  Mr.
Chair. Do
you have on that point
or do you want me to add you to the
list? Can
you?
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss she be real
quick because
I feel like we should
have gotten this. Hi,
sorry. Welcome
back. I feel like we should have got
this as a homework assignment
or like questions and stuff because
the more I read this, the more questions I
have. So I'm gonna be very brief.
It talks about when I was on page
40 behaviour and
occupational exposure.
I was really curious about the
local fruit and vegetables. I did
find the egg
on page
42.
As another example, participants
who ate eggs from chickens or other
father were raised in the
area
um had higher
levels. So eating the
eggs. I wish we talked about the fruits and
vegetables because it's almost like
the people that are like,
very earthy are
the ones who are going to have the higher
pfas and the ones who go to mcdonald's. If I was a
marketing person, I'd be all over this.
You eat at mcdonald's and don't
get PFAS. You know what I
mean?
Because this is
I mean, this is kind of weirdly
when we go back to that
question,
it looks like the people who
are eating locally and
crazy, which I do myself
are going to get higher exposure
to pus and everybody's out getting
their chickens and now you're eating
pus eggs. So
this is very interesting least some more
questions
about
you don't know, it's
like do I go to the store and go buy the
cage cage free, whatever?
Not in the,
the only thing I wish it had about the
fruits and vegetables. I don't see
that in there
but
participants who were exposed to
dirt at work at a higher
serum cholesterol. So you're saying
that air
exposure from the dirt
touching the dirt,
how in what contact
are people that are working with the dirt
have the higher incense of pis?
Is it airborne
touching? I know we're
not eating it. I hope
not
unless it's in the fruits and vegetables.
So,  Mr.  Chair and
Representative, your first
point, well noted this
is why,
you know, aside from the water
issues and the public health
issues there's an
economic
threat happening
by the Department of the Air
Force not taking
responsibility. What's migrating
off base, which is why
Art Scott lost his cows,
which is why other
people are cheating, which is why
Southwest Cheese should be worried
about the Department of
the Air Force not
protecting the food supply
of New Mexico.
I, so I agree
with you. If you're living off the
land,
you're, you're
likely to have more
exposure to
PFAS. I think your
second point
is what
we have been
concerned about is that
and what we've seen in other
states is
that there is air
deposition
occurring of
PFAS from other
um ways
in which or, you know, smokestacks,
et cetera. That
and even in Lake Hollomon,
if you go there on a windy day, you'll
see the PFAS
blowing out of the lake
onto the shore, you'll see
foam. And when
you spray the, the,
the planes
um practice
or real at, at
Canon,
there's residents who
live uh off
base who say that they
know when they're spraying
the, the planes with the
foam. So all
that to say, I think all that
to say is that
um I can't maybe speak
to the, the, the dirt
issue, the soil issue that
you're bringing up. But all
that to say is a pathway
of exposure that we've been
concerned about and documented
in other states is actual
air exposure through
deposition or of
foam blowing
agents.
And thank you.  Mr.  Chair
and, and
secretary. The only thing I'm
gonna say is this last commentary
I would love to see with
our military people. And it's important
to me because my husband
flew when he, he was in
a plane and it crashed and
they walked through foam up
this deep of the foam and he was
exposed to it and has no cancer
knock on wood. So,
I it, it would be really interesting
to see
where is that line
and who's more susceptible
so that if there's a certain
line and these people
are, these are the people who should be tested for
cancer constantly. Do. You know what I mean?
The least that we're going to
do is say if you were
exposed to X amount of pus
and you have X amount in your blood
and you have
maybe this autoimmune disorder
you need to get checked every
year. That that's what I'm looking at from
health anyways. That's all I have. Thank
you.
Thank you. Ok.
Um I'm gonna have
a few comments,
first of all,
secretary and to your
department and vice chair
Ferrari, thank you for
your vision and your courage
in taking this issue on to pass
legislation.
Um Honestly, when the
first time I saw your bill representative,
I thought man that is
going to be tough, very
ambitious. And
um you know, secretary
being one of the first state in the
country, you know, thank you
as always for your leadership,
protecting New Mexicans and
for your work JD and
your whole department. I hope they hear
me. I so appreciate
their work. Many of
us do you know
everyone's an environmentalist
once a problem happens,
you know, that's the irony of
contamination once it happens,
not only are people supportive of
protecting the environment, but they're pointing
fingers saying why didn't you protect
us? Well, gee,
I don't know. You, maybe because
you underfunded our environmental
protection and you pass
laws that didn't give us authority
and, and then people
suffer the contamination
and, you
know, continues to be one of the
best investments you could make is
protecting people from being contaminated
in the first place
and point, you know,
source pollution and
eliminating contaminants before
they are, they exist in the first
place. You know, it's far cheaper than
remediating them and
just continues to be
proven time and again.
And, um,
you know, the irony of this report
when it came out in the news and I
was like, you know, it was
a major mic
drop, you know, the, and of
course, little
counter, you know, non
counterintuitive.
But, you know, the fact that of
course a contaminating
substance, people close to it
would have it in their blood.
But, but it
was just ironic that, that
we found this
out right
after we passed these laws
protecting people from it.
And of course, it wasn't a foregone
conclusion that we would protect people
from it. But it's like,
thank God, you know,
and a lot of irony in the
legislative process and
usually
things good and bad
eventually come to light
and you're either happy you did something
or proven
regretful that you didn't
pass something. But, um,
this was a case where you felt
really good that we at
least took some affirmative
actions to protect New Mexicans. So my
question to you is,
um, you know,
the PFA that was found in people's
blood, what is the persistence? How
long once you're contaminated
or it's, you know, you have it in your
blood. How long
does it remain in your blood and
your
DNA
A  Mr.  Chair,
you will not outlive
it.
So you the
the chemical will
last longer
than most people's
lives.
And
um
what are the health impacts
uh the ramifications
of having that contamination
in your blood
obviously different for different
types of PFAS perhaps.
Yeah. Uh Mister Chair, we talked a lot
about cancer and I'm glad to hear,
you know, that people who
have loved ones who have
been firefighters are,
are not exhibiting any of
those problems. That's good news.
Um But
everything from high
cholesterol to reproductive
issues uh
to um
you know, Children who
get a vaccine. And I think this
is something relevant for New
Mexico with measles,
uh Children who get a
vaccine, the vaccines are
less effective
if you have PFAS
exposure. Um
So you have a sense of a
false
vaccination, maybe
or a less effective
vaccination.
Um There's uh
again, reproductive issues
in both men and women.
And then, you know, it goes all
the way up to organ issues,
liver, kidney, the
Department of Veterans
Affairs is doing a big kidney
cancer study right
now, looking at
their servicemen and women to figure
out what those
right levels should be and who should have
interventions and
then other types of
cancer. Um
And if you just Google
pfas and click news, health
impacts, I'm
sure there are publications that
happened in the last 24
48 hours that,
that uh
pro produce
other kinds
of uh concerns because
you see it all the time, the
longer the chain, the
more uh difficult
it is to break down, the more persistent
it is in your body and
those are the ones that we found.
So again, some of the chemicals
in Curry County
have not
been manufactured since
19
nineties, but
they're there now in
the water. Thank you.
And just in the interest
of time, I won't ask you to
talk about, I'll just touch on
it. I know also, of course
you did a report about Holloman
and they
have found incredibly
use that call it the
most,
the highest levels of p
contamination of any recreation
area in the country.
But I know they found it in wildlife,
which of course is a concern for
our sportsmen and our owners and
now our food supply,
not to mention recreation.
Again, another military
base,
you know, you have
recently just come out with
data on the abandoned uranium
mine sites that we have funded. Thank you
very much to the house for putting
50 million, but then it got
reduced to 20 million but
$20 million to clean up a
band in uranium mine sites. This
is generational
contamination that only
now are we just
barely scratching the surface
and dealing with? But you
found that you had 13
in the site, you're cleaning up that we
funded just now
13 times the
amount of
radiation
is it 13 years worth of
dose every year
by the exposure of just
living merit in one
site, the site that we
funded, but there's
1000 of them or
300 mine sites, but 1000
individual sites.
So we are really scratching the
surface and in some cases, it's
a losing battle because we have
some industries that are still using
this stuff. We're just starting to
get our arms around
it.
But I just want to say
this is why
we fight for
disclosure
so that we can manage
contaminants and protect
ourselves from it. This is
why full disclosure of down
hole oil and gas
chemicals of oil and gas disclosure
are so important. Not so
we can, you know, disrupt
the industry, but so we can
protect ourselves from
other pfas. And,
you know, we just only in the
last year banned
PFAS from oil and gas operations.
And here we have a report talking
about, you
know, giving
people that cancer
risk.
So we need disclosure.
We need to ban harmful chemicals
frankly. If, if, if an industry
doesn't want to tell us what they're putting
in our water, we should not be
allowing it.  Mr.
Secretary, does any industry have
the right to pollute New
Mexicans?
I think that's a right that just
exists by virtue of a property,
right? They have a right to
pollute New Mexicans.
No, and uh mister chair,
the legislature, as well as
the federal government has given us the
authority to
take bold
steps which we used
at Cannon Air Force
Base to say there was an
imminent and substantial
endangerment. So
uh nobody has the right
to act
outside the law, right?
So it
is,
I just will continue
to think it's one of the most important
departments of our state government.
You know, it's really a reflection
of the quality of life. We want
the how much we
value our health and our kids,
health and our environment and
future sustainability is
protecting our air,
water and land with
a strong regulatory entity.
Um And I think it's also good
for business because business doesn't want to
live in a place that's polluted and
contaminated and people don't want to
live to move to a place like that,
let alone move a business. So it's
just, it's actually
very much a win,
win.
Um,
so that is all I
have for now. And I
just again, so thank you for
your work and keep
it up. Keep it up and let's
fight. And let's, let's go after
these, these people
who polluted the 1000 plus abandoned
uranium mine sites.
Let's, let's go after
I got, let's go after the federal
government on that. And I hope
we, we take them
to court on that issue.
Mr.  Attorney General, if you're listening,
I encourage you to join
us on that. But  Mr.  Secretary, I know you
have the authority and
you have, you got the big
cape on and you have fought a lot of
battles for our state and this is one
more. I know we've been talking about it and you
have been fighting for that.
And I hope we also for the,
for the conservationists out in the
world that are very good at
getting hundreds of millions of dollars
a session appropriated.
I hope that they take on the
issue of
indigenous communities
and generational contamination
and that they come to the legislature this
session and ask for hundreds
of millions of dollars
more to
take on contamination
cleanup of these abandoned
sites. So with that,
we're going to close out with Representative
Sarinana. Thank you. Thank you,  Mr.
Chairman and thank you for your
presentation. I just
have a quick kind
of two parter. Um
As far as educating
in your next step, you say,
educate healthcare providers
with PFAS.
I have family
members who live in Elam Gordo,
they are health care,
health care providers
and I don't know that they understand
PFAS. So how is it going as far as
educating them in the
communities?
Mr.  Chair and Representative, thanks for
the question that
had our,
I will find out and get back
to you because DH is leading
on that one. I'm
not leading on that, but I'll,
I'll double check with the secretary
and get back to you on that.
There's a lot of new
information coming out
and we've been sort of
combing through it to make sure
it's uh
accurate
and, and reflective of
what we would wanna tell people in New
Mexico.
And also  Mr.
Chairman, I was in Cleveland
at electricity conference last week
and this senator
just picked on me about New
Mexico. And then his
last thing was before he
stopped talking to me. He
said, well, you guys have
the most pfas in the whole world.
And I said, we do,
but you know, you probably do
too if you have a military base, right?
It's all over.
And I said, you know, in New
Mexico, we are blessed because we
have a depart, an
amazing department of, of
environment. And we have
a secretary who believes in New
Mexico has a heart for New Mexico
and is always taking care
of us. So that's something we have in
New Mexico. So I want to thank you
for that. Um You are
pretty amazing in the last 78
years. I've been able to watch you and
it's been, you've been incredible.
So I have one more question. Last
question. It's
kind of off, off a topic.
But how is the relationship
between doe Landel
and whip
going?
Um  Mr.
Chair and Representative.
Thank you for that
question.
You know, I think,
uh one of the, the things
that has caught my eye over
the last 6.5,
7 years now
is how
poorly we've been treated
by the federal government and
how
willing we are to
take that poor
treatment. Um
And I, I want to
encourage you as a legislature
and people listening
and, and the executive
agencies
to really
fight back because
I have in the all my
time living in Pennsylvania,
Colorado DC. And now New
Mexico, I have
never seen
a federal
government really
treat its constituents
and where it, it works
so poorly.
Um Again, multiple
administrations and what I would
say to you is the Department
of Energy
and, um, specifically
Lael and Whip are asking
us to be um,
ok, with
incremental clean up
at Landel, OK.
With, um,
long waits in
line to get our waste
from Los Alamos into
whip. They are
prioritizing other
states over us have
continued to do it on my
watch. Um, I don't
feel good about that and I
think we need
a, um,
a catalyst
event to
really shake
up, uh,
Lael and whip to understand
that we as New Mexico
should be first
in line every
day for clean
up at Los Alamos and
shipments to whip.
We should not
be
put into the position that
they've put us in, which
is the
bottom
of the entire
complex. And
I'm looking at all my
authorities that
you've given me
to
really
change the dynamic
and not be
satisfied with
um poor
performance as the
norm. I want
exceptional performance
as the norm.
So, thank
you for that question. It's
I'm very frustrated
with the department of Energy
and their inability to
move waste
from Lael to
whip.
Thank you for the
answer.
Thank you, secretary.
This has been a really important
panel and obviously there's a lot of
questions and it almost
a lot of information, it
almost creates a lot of new
questions and it just stimulates
a lot of great discussion about
protection. So thank you.
And also just while
you're here, I'm kind of a sentimental
guy and I want to also
acknowledge that we just recently
won another battle protecting
us from contamination. And
that was regarding the high
level nuclear waste issue.
And recently an article
just came, came out
that whole tech basically
said there,
you know, they're pulling out of New
Mexico and they're pulling out of their legal
agreement with Southeastern Energy
Alliance. And,
you know, after all the threats of
lawsuits and
proclamations that we would lose
in court and preemption.
It's another one of those issues that
we said, no, we have authority,
which the Supreme Court
said that there was a line of authority.
And you know, recently
they just said
given our law that we passed,
they acknowledge the law that we're,
we're pulling out basically.
So II I, you know, I'll say
that with a grain of salt, but I want to thank
Don Hancock also who's in the back
of the room. And thank you,
secretary, because you know, on behalf
of the administration, you really recognize
that this was another issue with
more questions and answers and a
lot of long term exposure.
So it was a battle
we won seemingly
so at least with that company.
Thank you,  Mr.  Secretary. Thank
you. Thank you.
She happy to come back. There's
always ample to talk
about. So, thank you. I appreciate
you all. By the way, we got a lot of
our chest. Thank
you. Have a great day.
All right. So we will move on to the next
item on the agenda.
Kirtland Air Force Base. Thanks
for your patience,
y'all.
Yeah. Yeah. And we're
also joined by our esteemed colleague,
Senator Shannon Pinto. If you want to
introduce yourself? I saw
you on the news last night. I
was
Truckers
against
II. I
guess I need to watch the news
more.
Thank you,  Mr.  chair members of the
committee and thank you for the
hosting us out here again
at UN M I am
Senator Shannon Pinto. I represent
district three, most of navajo
nation. Mckinley and San Juan
County. It's great to be
here 2.5
hours to get here. But thank you,
Mr.  Chair. Thank
you.
Ok. Take it
away.
All right,
good morning,  Mr.  Chair
members of the committee. Um, again,
my name is John David Nance. Goodbye
JD. And the House's Waste
Bureau chief. Um I'll
be starting off
uh discussing
the bulk fuels
facility
and where we're at with
that right now.
Um We
do have slides in front,
um, apologies
for black and white
on those, but,
um, pretty much gonna kind of just
kind of jump right into
some of the information from
my seat. There's gonna be a
lot. Um, my
counterparts have a
little bit more information as far as the
background of the site
and um, that
aspect. So for new
committee members, you will
also get that information on the other
two presentations.
Um So going to slide
two,
has Waste Bureau has
a regulatory
authority
for
K Air Force Base
specifically for the bulk fuels
facility which is underneath
the new Mexico.
Has this waste
rira
permit that we administer
on behalf of EPA,
it's all ran under the
Resource Conservation Recovery
Act and also
New Mexico has its Waste
act. These are also
regulated underneath
the corrected action fee
regulations that are
contained within the New Mexico Administrative
Code.
All of that is
combined into
the um the
EPA Rira permit
for Kirtland Air Force
Base. And
that outlines what
those regulations are and also
gives uh corrective
action process and guidelines
on how to move forward
with a clean up
investigation, identification and
cleanup of the
site.
Um Moving on to slide
three
um the corrective action
process under Rra
we kind of look at it as
a four part
process where we
have the investigation.
Once we identify that there is
something going on, we
investigate to see what the
nature and extent
is. Once we
identify that
and we then can move
into a correct of measures,
evaluation,
evaluating all of the
different technologies that
could fix
the issue based on what
we found on the investigation
that then goes through a
corrective
measure selection where
the technology
or technologies
are evaluated,
identified, there
is a public process
component to it and
then NMED as the regulator
makes that final selection
and then we get into the corrective
measures implementation,
which is the fun part where everything
is full blown. We know what
we're doing. We're moving forward,
full clean up
activities are ongoing
with continual
monitoring to make sure that
everything is working as
planned.
Moving on to slide.
Four
apologies. My
computer decided
to freeze up,
but there's um
uh
on-site progress that has
been being made
um on the
site. And my apologies,
my computer just froze
up
if I could. Yeah, that'd be
great
that one grabbing one
real quick
and technology has failed me
today. So my
apologies.
All
right.
So on site, the
progress we've that
has been being made right
now. Um We do have
ongoing monitoring of
the um the soil
vapor and also groundwater
contamination
that is
being
continually to be
monitored on site
that is happening.
And I think
every other quarters is
when these are being collected
and, and identified
also.
Um
uh just recently, there's
uh the groundwater
nappo so light
non aqueous phase
liquid, it's
a phase of
petroleum contamination
that floats on top of
basically kind of rests on
top of the groundwater
that sampling has been
approved and is
um from what I understand already
being integrated into the
monitoring activities at the
site. Um It's a
very
um
a good piece of information that
we need to ongoing
and be able to characterize
for the investigation
phase.
Also, um
There is a well installation of
two new
source zone monitoring
wells, Kirtland
Air Force Base. Well,
106253
and
106254.
These two wells are
strategically strategically
placed on the eastern
side and the western side of
where the source
area is
and are just further
helping to identify
the boundaries within that
source zone and provide
additional information on
that investigative
phase.
Next slide
slide five
is a map
is just
outlining
where those two
new wells are being
located. If
you look, there's to
the southern part of the
map, there's a black square
and then you'll see two
large ovals that's
just showing where those two
wells are going to be
located.
Uh Moving on to
the next slide slide
six.
Um Just giving an
update on the current status where
we're at on the enemy D
side, we did
receive the
2025
revised soil vapor
monitoring plan that was
submitted to our department
by the Air Force in April
2025. We
are currently going through
extensive review of
that
and we will be
going
through that and making our
comments afterwards.
Currently, everything
is being
performed
for soil vapor under the
2024
revised work plan.
Uh Same with the groundwater
monitoring plan that was also
received in April 2025.
We are
also under review
doing review of
that,
that monitoring plan
and the ground
groundwater component
sampling is currently
being performed under the
2024 plan. Also
a revised
plan
and then the
big one is the phase
two Rira facility
investigation. So
this is a
report that
follows up on the
initial
Rira facility
investigation. It
is intended to
fill remaining
data gaps that were identified
during the review of
the initial
investigation plan or
investigation report.
Um
provide um
additional data and
make sure that we have our
nature and extent and
actually wrap up the investigation
phase. That's what this
report is
intended to do.
Once we are able to do
that, then we will be able to
move the whole program
into the corrective measures,
evaluation and
then moving towards
a corrective remedy selection.
So that's where we're at right now. We are
currently in review of
that
moving on to the next
slide.
Um Just for how we
are providing
these reviews, uh
nmed is working
with a third party
contractor. This
was put in place several years ago
to provide additional
support and
um
level, you know, just,
just additional support for
making sure that we're getting these reviews
done and in a
very scientific, thorough way
in a timely manner.
Um We are continue
like the secretary said, we are
having a lot of hires coming
into the into the agency.
We are having good hires
coming into the department, getting people
up to speed, but we're also
maintaining that third party
contractor for
continuity of review
and also to have that extra
support so we can keep
moving forward in our reviews
along with doing
that review specifically with the phase
two RF I,
we are communicating
with the, with the Air
Force Base. As we're doing
that review, typically
a
report will be submitted
to the agency. We
will go through do our full review
to provide all of her comments,
give those back to the
permanent, they then
get those and review them and then
do response and then
basically the tennis match goes
back and forth
um in
efforts to move this
program forward, especially
with the amount
of data that has been collected
throughout the years. Um The
amount of reporting that
the phase two RF I
is basically
uh bringing together
into one
document.
We are working with
Kirtland Air Force Base as we're going
through that review,
providing comments
early on trying to
identify
areas where we might have
questions or additional
comments and people to work
to try and get those
resolved in a more timely
fashion. So more collab
collaborative
approach in our
review process.
And so that that's kind of how we're working
forward to getting that
done.
Um
And lastly
with that, we are
working to make sure
that stakeholders that are
within the group
are being heard,
are, you know, providing
information on that as well.
And we're able to kind of work as a
team effort in
trying to get all of the um
any questions, common sense concerns
with that report ironed
out. So we can then be
able to agree
upon it, move forward and get it
that correct of measures.
So that like
I said, it was a kind of a brief
overview of where we
are from NM AD
standpoint. I do
have
um
Albuquerque Water Quality
Authority and also Curtain
Air Force Base here as well, which
will be going into more
detail on the history
of the, of the, of
the site and also additional
information on their perspectives
of where we're at in the
process.
With that.
I'm
sorry.
Thank you. So we're gonna hand
it over
uh Good morning. Um
Members of the committee. Thank you for
having the water authority
to speak to you today about
the um bulk fields
facility leak, jet fuel
leak. Um My name is Kelsey
BCN and I'm the environmental
manager for the Water
Authority. Uh And
what I do for the Water Authority is
implement and oversee our
source water protection program.
Um The Water authority is actually
required to have a
source water protection program um
since we are a public uh
provider of drinking
water. Um And through that
program, we've identified six
priority groundwater contamination
sites and the bulk fuels facility
is one of those sites.
Uh The goal of my presentation today to
you all is to outline our
engagement with the bulk fuels facility
site as a priority groundwater
contamination site
and uh to conclude and
establish why we're looking
to renew a contingency
agreement that we formally had at the Air
Force. Um
In the past, we'd like to renew
that today. So
if we can go to the next slide on slide
two, This
is a stakeholder model that
we have developed for the
bulk fuels facility site.
Um This stakeholder model
holds true for all of our priority
contamination sites. Uh All
we really need to do is replace
um who's in the,
the dark blue circle for
those who create and own the
risk. Uh What
doesn't change with these
contamination sites is the
degree of overlap that the water
authority and other um
stakeholders who rely on
groundwater have with the
contamination problem itself.
So, uh the water authority
is a key stakeholder for this
facility um because
we are the most impacted,
it is our groundwater resource that's
been impacted by contamination.
Um And that
prevents our access to that
resource uh now and into
the future.
Um We are not a regulatory
agency and thus, we rely
very heavily on
collaboration with the Mexican
Environment Department and
um responsible parties like the Air
Force to ensure that
cleanup is conducted
thoroughly and that
our access
to our resources
restored.
Um If we can move to the next
slide on slide three, I'm just going to give
you a little bit more of an introduction
to the Water
Authority. We serve
about a third of the population
of New Mexico. So we are the largest
utility in New Mexico
and we accomplish
this with a combination of
groundwater and surface water.
Um That being said in times
of severe drought like we're in right now.
Um The surface water supply
is not always um
enough to meet the demand of our
customers. And in those situations,
we have to sule supplement our
supply or switch entirely
back to groundwater.
And that's just the highlight that
groundwater remains a critical
supply for the utility.
Um and is actually one of the
key components of our long
term water management
plan. Water 2120.
So uh being able
to rely on that
groundwater um gives us
redundancy in our supply, we
can continue to serve
our customers uh into the
future. And
we believe uh as
you know, the largest utility in New Mexico that
having to guarantee
of that redundancy
is in the best interest of
uh the we're able
to guarantee supply in worst case
scenarios. Um
The shortest water protection
program
accomplishes
meeting those redundancy
goals um by
ensuring that our access to our
resources protected.
Um
In addition, for the Woke Field site,
specifically, we
have an additional commitment
to our customers that
we will not serve water
contaminated with components
of one specific component
of the Jeff fuel leak, Ethyle Diro
one which I'll go into on the next slide
that was a resolution that was passed
by our governing board
in 2014.
Um On flight
four, this is just a really brief
overview of um
the facility from our
perspective,  Mr.  Wartman will go
into more detail from the Air Force's
perspective. But on
the right hand side is a block
diagram that just depicts uh
how
this leak
looks like in the subsurface.
The brown is what we call the vato
zone. That's just soil,
uh blue is the aquifer.
And you can see that
um this
leak that was discovered 25 years
ago, impacted quite a bit of
material, both soil
and groundwater.
Uh The Water authority's
involvement at this point
is to ensure that
site actions prevent
spread of a component
called Elin Diro or E DB.
For short, we don't want
to see that spreading into new
parts of the aquifer unless
impacting new parts of the
aquifer. Um Historically,
this this contaminant
had the greatest extensive
that reached about a half mile
to our supply wells and it was at
this point in time
circa 2014
where we had that
contingency plan
established with the Air
Force
a moving
forward uh into how the
site's cleaned up.
Mr.  Nance
mentioned that it follows the rra
corrective action process. I
will just summarize this by
saying we're
currently in the investigation phase
still, but that is hopefully can
be wrapped up soon with the submission
of the Rira
phase two
facility investigation
report.
That being said the site has
not been sitting idle all
this time over these last 25
years and the Air Force has
been operating several
inter interim measures
to proactively
address the contamination that
this site has introduced to
the subsurface.
if we can go to the next slide on
slide. Five,
really interim measures
are
uh
proactive actions that
actively remove contamination
and thus prevent the spread of
it. Um There
have been two critical
inner measures at the site. One
is soil vapor extraction.
Um This uh acted
on by reducing
the massive fuel
in the subsurface, which
has a benefit of reducing
the amount of fuel that's ultimately
dissolving into groundwater.
Um That system was
turned off in 2015.
Uh And
around that same time, the
uh groundwater pump and treat system
was established which has four extraction
wells which came online by
2018. And
this interim measure is
critical to protecting
uh drinking water supply and
down gradient wells from the contamination
site. Um
That being said,
uh while it
is serving its purpose, um the water
theory is always interested
in understanding the risky
scenarios. That's part of my role in
source water protection is to determine
um how long
it's, you know, our resource may be
impacted for.
Um And so what we did
is we modelled
uh the site under
various conditions. And
we looked at the,
the scenario in which
nothing was done, we turned off everything
of the site. We just let it run its natural
course. In that
scenario, we're looking at 800
years of impact before it
goes away and we have
access to our resource again.
Um That's obviously a really long
time um
with the operation of the pump
and treat system, that
timeline is still about 100
years because there
is no active treatment of the
fuel that's causing the
contamination. And
so any effort
to treats
that fuel um ultimately
reduces the timeline um
to clean up and ultimately reduces the
amount of impact that our resource
has. And that is
what we advocate for through our resource water
protection
program.
I go to the next slide, please.
Uh Slide six is a summary
of how the Water Authority has been
proactively engaging with
this site as a priority
contamination site. Um
This is a site that's specific
to the bulk fuels
facility. But again, this is
a very similar model that we follow for
all of our priority groundwater contamination
sites.
Um
The first thing on this slide
is that the water
authority voluntary
voluntarily samples all of the
supply wells that we
own and operate in the nearby
area to the fuel spill to
ensure that we're not picking up
any contaminants from,
from the jet fuel leak and to this
state. We've never had a
detection, which is great.
Um The second thing that we
do is we spend a lot of
resources consolidating
um data from the Air
Force conducting technical
evaluations um
of uh
various things that are going
on at the site. And right now
that is reviewing that
phase two, our I report
and providing formal comment to
NMED.
Um The third thing
I'd like to highlight that we have
done for the site um
is through the generous contribution
of you all through the capital
Outlay program. Um We actually
installed our own
monitoring well, um which
is a, a deep
monitoring. Well, it's on this
block diagram slightly to the
left of that kind of
thicker gray line,
which is a supply well,
um We call this
data gap well, and its
purpose is
to
monitor
the aquifer for that
migration of E DB into new
parts of the aquifer. So it serves a
really key marker
for us to know if
that migration is starting to
impact areas that it hasn't
historically.
Um And then
finally, we co-ordinate with
local state and federal representatives
to ensure effective site clean
up. Um And
what is not listed on here. And
I'll go back to this contingency
plan. Um
We have in the
past established
contingency measures uh
for the site with the Air
Force which essentially
outlined conditions in which the Air
Force would pay for
a supply well,
um to replace it if one
were to be impacted um
that was a big, if uh
it didn't happen, it's unlikely
that it will happen now, but it's a,
it's a nice safety
net for us
to again ensure that we have
redundancy in our supply
in the event of the worst case scenario.
And um
I'll just briefly highlight
that um that's
worst case scenario has happened
in Albuquerque, hasn't happened recently,
but back in the eighties, we
had the South Valley Super Fund
site which actually
contaminated several of our supply
wells back when we were in the city of Albuquerque.
And we did get those replaced
through the Super fun
um process and got
new wells out of that. So this is not an
unprecedented occurrence
in in Albuquerque, but again,
is unlikely at this point
with the project.
Um Moving on to slide seven
my update for you all.
Um many of you have seen me
present before and some of these
slides are very similar which I apologize
for. Um At this
point in time, we are
actively reviewing the phase
two R I
report um
based on our review which we've
been conducting since April
when it was released, we still
have concerns about the nature and
extent of contamination
uh in the source area uh
with where that fuel is and how
it got down to groundwater.
Um We have
met with NMED through
the collaborative stakeholder process
that  Mr.  Nance spoke about
and they do share
some of our concerns uh
with the
RF I report and
uh intend to issue
a request for information to the Air
Force to
resolve those gaps that
were identified in the report. So we look
forward to, to seeing how that
progresses.
Um The second update I have
for you is
um something that came
out of an advisory board here in Albuquerque
called the Water Protection Advisory
Board. This
is a board that
has, it's a volunteer
board of members who are appointed
by the city of Albuquerque,
the Burn Leo County
um uh county
Commission and then also the water 30
governing board to
advise those three agencies
on source water protection
matters. Um The three of
us here present to that board
annually and then I as a
technical staff for one of those
agent appoints and agencies
provide more frequent
updates on what the water authority is
doing
and how we're involved with
the site. Um
based on all the information that the Water
Protection Advisory board has
received over the last year.
Um They came to speak
to our governing board in April
and advised the water authority
to seek out um this
contingency plan agreement
um to ensure
that we can protect our drinking water
supply. And the best
way that we have found to do
that following up on their recommendation is
to just renew an agreement that
we previously had in place with the Air
Force, not change any language,
not update anything about
it except for the dates in
that plan. And we are
co-ordinating with our Federal delegation
to do so. They are highly supportive of
this effort on our
part.
Uh My last slide is just a little bit
more detail on this contingency plan
and why it is important to
us. Um As I
spoke, the groundwater interim measure
is a very important
uh
component of the site that's protecting
drinking water supply and it is the
only barrier
to contamination
reaching supply wells.
Um
As I mentioned, we have a very
long term planning horizon
and we're always trying to balance
these, you know, short term conditions
with long term possibilities
uh at the sites that we're monitoring
and it's very hard to predict
what's going to happen in the future. And
there's also variability that gets
introduced to the site
that can cause
um it
can create risk of breakthrough
and you
know, that's compounded by things
such as the insufficient characterization
contamination that I mentioned
and the persistent
fuel that's in the ground at this site.
Um What I want to highlight
though is the second bullet on this slide,
which is the changes
to the interim measure operation.
Um
It is it is going
to happen, the interim measure operation
will have to change in order to
adequately capture all of the ethylene
dibromm that's offsite
in the groundwater. That that's
a reality, that's how
groundwater contamination cleanup
works. Um
However, we have
modelled scenarios in which the
operation can change. And
we have
seen that there is a possibility
of breakthrough under these
conditions in which that operation
may change. And so
again, the contingency plan is
just a way to say we
have redundancy and flexibility in our
supply should the
worst thing happen. And
the changes happen, we
have breakthrough, we have a
plan in place to ensure that
we don't lose access to our
supply. Um And
again, this is really what we view
as in the best interests of our utility
and our repairs.
Um So with that, that is my update
and I will pass
it over to  Mr.
Warman.
Thank you. Uh Good
afternoon,  Mr.  chair members of the
committee. Thank you for
giving me a chance to present
for the Kirtland Air Force Bases
presentation regarding the
bulk fuel facility clean
up. My name is Ryan
Mortman. I'm with the Air Force and
Engineering Center. I'm
a UN M graduate and been
working on this project on and
off for about a decade as a
private consultant, as well
as a member of the Air Force for
about the last half
decade. So very
invested both personally
and professionally in seeing this
uh reach our cleanup rules
here. So my
discussion topics for you all
is just giving a lay down
of our current state
of the project that investigation
phase that was discussed about
and then what our current
step is to move us forward
to a more robust
remedial solution.
So going to the
third slide, the ethylene
uh E DB plume
footprint over time, that's ethylene
di bromide, a few
background points for this
slide. So what we're seeing here is
what we call a dissolved phase
contaminant plume. This
is created when fuel,
which is that light non
aqueous phase liquid sits
on top of the groundwater.
It's going to
dissolve contaminants
into that groundwater.
And what a dissolved phase plume
is, is groundwater. With
those contaminants within it and
moves just like groundwater
away from where that fuel
actually contacted.
The other note on here is
that we're looking at a plume
that is 450
ft below ground
surface. So, although
that 2015 map
shows it underneath uh residential
buildings, there, there is a
450 ft
buffer zone of soil
before you get to the contaminant
itself. So that's important
to note. And the other thing
is when we look at these contaminant
uh plumes, we're
highlighting what our action level
is for this site, which is
under the Safe Drinking Water
Act. We work.
Our action level is a drinking
water standard. It's the
EPA maximum
contaminant level. So
that is 0.05
mcg per liter for E
DB. So anything
shaded is above that
action level. So that means
we as the air force
are responsible for taking
action to remediate that.
And now going into the
overall picture of that with that
background information, the overall
concept that I'm trying to convey
here is that success
of that intra measure that has been
mentioned. So we have four
extraction wells operating
continuously that
pump the groundwater
in that residential area
north of the base and we
pull it into a treatment system
which has multiple filters
to it. The primary one removing
ethylene di bromide is
granular activated
carbon. This is a
filter that
pulls out all DB
to zero levels.
We've never seen any breakthrough of
DB through our treatment system.
And then that water is then either
reinjected into the
aquifer for sustainability
practices or
utilized as irrigation
for the golf course
on base.
And really over the,
the first extraction wheel went
in, in 2015, the
other ones followed up. Uh
the last one being installed in the 2018
time period and these have been
continuously operating in
this targeted area.
The the reason for
this was to cut off the
exposure pathway so that
450 ft, you're not gonna
be directly contacting
that impacted groundwater.
However, it, it there's
a potential for it to be uptake
through the drinking water supply.
And in the 2015,
there was no cut
off of that. So what happened
was this interim measure was
implemented as a
exposure pathway
cut off, eliminating
that potential exposure.
And now this continual
operation of it is
preventing any future exposure
to drinking water as
well
going to the next
slide. So E
DB, although that is our
main risk driver for the site
and where our main intra measure
efforts are focused, there are
other fuel related
contaminants that are above
cleanup or action levels
for this site.
Looking at benzene is
another uh fuel
constituent. We
the we call this the source
area plume. So where the
fuel actually contacted
the groundwater is roughly
the same shape and size as
this benzene plume.
What that tells you is that
we're having benzene actively
dissolve into the groundwater.
However, it's not
migrating
to the drinking water supply
like E DB was doing
on that previous slide that we
looked at. So we're seeing the
general same footprint over
time, we are seeing
increased concentrations,
which has to do with the rising water
table, which we'll look at on
the next slide. However,
the wells that are above
action levels have been
consistent and the ones below it
have been consistent over time.
This enlarging of the
plume shape is
partially a statistical
uh creation
because of those higher concentrations,
thus pushing our plume
boundary closer to those uh
non detector below action
level wells. So
something that we the
other thing about these plume maps, I will
note is we use 100 and
74 monitoring wells
to depict them that are
screened throughout the entire
shallow aquifer there
to fully characterize the
extent of the
plumes. And these happen,
we do these plume shells
every six months. So
that kind of tells us how it changes
over time. So that's that nature
and extent part that the
investigation phase
is working towards.
So we we're focusing on
on the actual groundwater
data, but
there's more to nature and extent than
just the groundwater. So
going to the next slide here,
the 2023 conceptual
site model, this is a
cartoon depiction of
our of our site. So
we had a fuel release area
which the fuel
release probably started
in the fifties and wasn't
identified until 1999.
This was due to rail
cars offloading
fuel and
the conveyance
line to the pumphouse
had a leak in it and that line
was under vacuum, pressure
and vacuum tested
and there was no issues there
because a rock would actually
seal that. However,
after the, the negative
pressure was released from this
pipe, that's where the fuel
would, would release into
the subsurface. So it was
a relatively small
amount but this release
occurred over multiple
decades. Thus,
resulting in the
contamination that we
see today. The interim
measures done to this
area was all the
soil was excavated down to
20 ft. So there's
no direct exposure via
the impacted soil right
in the fuels facility, protecting the
airmen and the civilians
that work in that area
as well as the soil vapor
extraction system which
targeted the most heavy
contaminated soils
in the subsurface as
well. The
uh and then the rising water
table on here. So
this is a a unique
condition to the site is that
fluctuating water table.
So, since the
19 eighties, which is when we
anticipated the fuel
contacted groundwater,
we've seen a steadily
decrease of groundwater
until 2009.
So as that as the water
table drops, the fuel is going
to follow it further
downward. And now since
2009, and the water
conservation practices
by the Water authority here
have a which is great for the city
but has created an issue
for this site where we have a
rising water table,
creating a smear zone
which is additional mass
getting exposed to the
the groundwater.
However, this as we
saw in the benzene plume, we're not seeing
that uh change
shape and the ethylene
dibromm is actually being
captured through our treatment
system, thus
capturing the exposure pathway
there. But this is a just
a cartoon uh
depiction of that.
So going into
what the data
actually is to fully
represent and why that
cartoon is accurate so
that we're now we're looking at
soil vapor plume,
which is again,
the fuel migrates down
through the subsurface and that fuel
is going to off gas
contaminants.
What the soil vapor is is
we take samples. We have
323 soil
vapor points that help
us delineate where
that soil vapor contamination
is and those highest
soil vapor concentrations are
going to be proximal
to where the nappo or the
fuel actually migrated
through the surface. So
at this site, we had our release
area and as it
moved through that 450
ft of soil, it moves
slightly to the
southeast as,
as you can see where the
groundwater contamination
is off place from where the
release actually occurred,
that is due to the lithology
which we've documented through all
of our soil excavations.
And the RF I phase two goes
into detail on to what
that looks like across the entire
source area.
And the other uh
key component is
how the fuel actually where
it touched the groundwater. Because that
is where you're getting your,
your source to groundwater
contamination. And the,
the yellow on the right
image here,
the yellow is showing
where we have measured
um NAL as
well as the where groundwater
concentrations are so high that
they would indicate that
that there is actual
nale smear zone in those
samples. So
that is what we're looking at here. This is
all part of the RFI phase two. We're
doing complete nature and extent. So that
means soil vapor,
soil, groundwater
as well as where the fuel
occurred. This is all used
to help us in
the next phase which we'll look at
on the next slide here. So we've
talked about the goals of the
investigation phase and
the inter measures are are
geared towards cutting off those exposure
pathways. And the corrective
measure evaluation I want to
highlight for the committee as being a
critical step in this
because this is where we've used
25 years
worth of information,
all the reports that we produce
on a quarterly basis.
This phase two RF I being
the most critical of those
compiling all that and coming
up with a final
remedy or
a multiple remedial
solutions is typically how
these play out. And this is
where the Air Force
uses all that information
and will present
multiple solutions to
the state and
they will then select the most
protective and feasible
strategy. And that will go out
for a public comment period
where all the members of
the impacted community
and the community at large
can weigh in and
express their concerns that have to
be addressed on the record.
So this is a a major
milestone for this project,
25 years of
investigation.
And the Air Force is
confident that we have all the
information we need to
evaluate remedies. We have
contracted out a
remediation experts
for the Air Force that have done
these types of cleanup activities
across the nation who
believe we have enough information
to meet the goals
of that uh phase. So we're
looking forward to getting, working
with the state to get
to that next
step and
how we do that is by
the next slide here and that's the
submittal of the phase two
RF I. Again,
this documents, all
the investigation we have
done since the phase one was
submitted, which
targeted specific data
gaps identified in that
report. So I'm listing
out some of those activities there
that are captured in the phase two
and that was submitted on
April 29 2025
to the new Mexico Environment
Department
and going on to the path
forward. So
again, we're, we're
confident that we can start
evaluating remedies
in that corrective measures,
evaluation phase
and that phase two as
NMED reviews it
and provides
comments, we'll work
towards getting an approval and
direction from the state to move
into that phase.
Another activity that
we're working on are those new
wells uh that are
being installed? And that's really
just a part of the
continued understanding is
site conditions change over time
that rising water table
where there's expected
uh need for additional
wells. We're posture
to execute those activities
as they arise as
well as we are updating a risk
assessment and that
will be submitted concurrently
with the
CME or prior
to.
And with that again,
thank you for the presentation.
I'll turn it back to the chair and members
of the committee.
All right, great job, everybody
a little bit high
level. But um
we followed much of
it. Um committee.
Do you have any
questions?
Ok. Committee have any
questions, Representative
Saron,
thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. All right.
So this picture,
why is it getting bigger
because the water level,
is that what you said the water
level was getting higher? So it was
spread out more? Is that what you're saying?
So the, the, the question
was regarding the benzene plume over
time illustration. So
that is, it's
increasing, the, the concentrates
are increasing because as the water table
rises, there's that the
fuel that impacted
the subsurface that it's
contacting and that's
dissolved into the groundwater.
So that's the increase in concentrations.
But the overall
shape and size is
not migrating
anywhere. So you can see that it's
slightly bigger.
But the, the keyboard there is
the wells that bound
that size, that
shape are not
getting higher
hit, so are not exceeding
action levels. So that's
how we're bounding it
through the, the
nondetect wells or the
below action level wells
versus the increasing
concentration that we see on the
interior of that
gloom.
Ok. I, I don't quite
understand what you just
said,
but um
can you? Yes,  Mr.  Chair
Representative. Um just to kind
of give more, a little
bit more clarification on that is
as the water table is
rights there is
contamination that's in the water
itself and that's what we're sampling
and that's what the Air Force is sampling
as it is rising.
There is
um
contamination
that is in uh contained
in the soils above that
water. So you actually
as you're rising the water up, it's
coming in contact with
more contamination
that's in the soils just above
the water. So it's adding
to the
concentration that's already in the
water as the water
rises.
Mr.  Chairman. So
contamination above it's
different kind of contamination or
the same type just in
the soil. Now, the
same type of type
of contamination
specifically with the plume
you're looking at that's focusing
on uh benzene
itself. So there's
a benzene that is contained
in the soil um
that is above what we call
the vado zone.
So
one of the things that uh
the enemy d has been
looking at is also characterization
of the source zone where it
came from and how it
migrated through the soils
to the groundwater.
Um And this
is also showing where we have that
soil vapor that
rests in the, in the soils
itself in the soil contamination.
So, um soil
contamination, soil vapor
and then the water
itself and as the
water rises is starting to
come in contact with that
soil vapor and soil
contamination which
adds to the
concentrations that are contained
within that water.
Um The
a good thing to look at though
is as that water is coming
up and those concentrations are
increasing because it's
coming in contact with more
um
more of the
benzene, the
lateral extent is not
extending beyond
the previous wells that
had non detects or
not, that are below
the regulatory limit.
So
that's showing that
um as the water comes
up, it's, you know, it's still
bound in
a sense from
where we had,
it had it brief
prior
regulatory
limit.
How dangerous
is that? I mean, there's a
limit and, and
I, when I think of benzene, I think of gas and
oil and it's not a good thing.
So
explain that
Mr.  Chair members of the
committee. So the the action
level for this is
under the Safe Drinking Water
Act. So it's actually a drinking water
standard and this is derived
from the EPA and it's that
maximum contaminant level.
So it's the same standard that's
used across the nation for
actual water providers
to their constituents. So,
although no one's uptaking
this water for human
consumption, the
everything outside of
that shaded is
below that drinking
water
standard.
Ok. Thank you very much,
Senator
Thornton.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. I just
have one question. Uh You
guys have done a great job of putting together
these presentations. I appreciate the
work you've done and all that.
Um
And
I guess my question is really coming
from an economic impact II
I sort of, I want to know so
the numbers that I'm missing are
what has been and I
I, each of you
can answer this independently if you have
their numbers. Um What has
been the economic impact of cleanup
efforts overall? In other words,
the clean up the technical analysis
associated with that the sampling
and also the ongoing monitoring.
Um Do you have
a, a sense of feel for how
much all of that is costing?
And the reason I ask this is because
it's clear that there's a lot of
effort to, to clean up
a mess. And so
we need to prevent this from happening
in the first place, but we need to
understand what that balance is. So
that when we're asking people
to prevent things
from occurring in the first place, here's
the cost benefit of doing it this
way as opposed to having to clean it up
after the fact. So do you have
a sense of what those numbers look
like?
Uh  Mr.  Chair and Senator
from the utility perspective.
Um I can say
I don't have the exact number off the top of my
head. But the last one I looked at
was we've spent over a
million of our
own dollars and
that's not including the capital a funding that
we received to put in our modern renewal,
which was another
$750,000.
So we're looking at almost 2 million
on the utility side
just to
ensure that
we have
a complete understanding of the site
and are aware of the risk that it poses
to our drinking water supply
resource again now and
into the future. Um That
would be our economic impact.
It's, it's not minor and then
that doesn't consider the, the
staff time. Um In
addition to monitor the
site and keep track of it and
update it on a regular
basis.
Mr.  Chair members of the committees
from the Air Force, we've
executed 100 and
$30 million to
date and we've actually starting
next fy, we'll
switch into a new contract,
which was another 30 million
years to cover the next five years.
And that's just the monitoring and
infrastructure installed to,
to, to date
we've programmed additional
funds out into the future to
address the additional
contamination highlighted on
these
images.
Mr.  Chair Senator
from NMED
standpoint, they don't have
actual numbers to
present to you, but
um NMED
as an agency has been
overseeing and regulating
this since
2005
to present, having
work through ground
work quality bureau
and then handing off to the hatches
Waste Bureau
and you
know, so
it majority of it is
staff time for reviewing
documents and overseeing what's
going on. The the
department has also done
um multiple levels
of studies, statistical
analysis and modelling ourselves
just to be
able to
uh
from a regulatory standpoint,
be able to verify and double
check what is being submitted to us
in the investigation phase throughout
that process.
Thank you for that. And so
what I'm hearing is approximately
100 and 32 million
and who knows how many million in
the state. And so uh
so clearly,
uh prevention is much
better than, than
mitigation. And so,
but those are the kind of numbers, I
think it would be important for you to
continually keep track
of for us
because
as we get more
stringent with regulatory
requirements,
the people who are going to be
responsible for these kinds of things need to
understand that this is
a, you know, chicken and egg thing,
we wanna want to stop it before it
happens. So,
so when we're asking them to put in
additional work or
preventative activities
in their processes.
Um They'll understand
why. So.
Thank you for that.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank you. And
what would be the cost if you
actually contaminated the
drinking water
supply?
Talk about the big price tag,
big cost because
that's a finite resource
there. Ok. Senators
Lopez.
Thank you  Mr.  Chair and I apologize. I
apologize. I had to step out
for another zoom meeting.
Um but this is
in my district as you
know, and um
I've gotten a lot of calls
from people about,
about this and as you
probably, you may not
know if you're new, um
Senator
Mimi Stewart
where and I sued,
we filed a lawsuit along with
other constituents
and the judge ended up dismissing
it in part because the state had
the responsibility and the state wasn't
part of the lawsuit. Um
And so it was dismissed.
Um And so one
of the, one of the big
issues that we were
suing on was
we were concerned about the
monitoring.
Um
We didn't feel that the monitors
were placed correctly to
accurately measure the
plume.
I have talked to
people in the department who
felt that well, there was,
there was questions about
whether that was true or not and
whatever. So I'd like
to hear from you,
especially looking at
what I'm seeing here.
Do you feel that
the monitors are
now correctly placed
to measure
the, to accurately
measure the plume or does
more work need to be done.
Um I really am happy
to see under
this administration
that this is being
taken more
seriously. I mean, to
me this is a huge thing
because it's right in my
district and right
near a
well that we get our
drinking water from.
So I'm very
serious about this. So
anyway,  Mr.  Chair,
if I could hear about
that,  Mr.
Chair,
Senator,
so NMED is
currently reviewing
the phase two
facility investigation that which
basically outlines all
of the work that has been done during the investigation
phase. Um
locations of monitoring wells,
data from those monitoring
wells from
and by monitoring wells, I mean,
soil vapor wells as
well as groundwater
wells and
those data, how they
depict the nature
and extent of the
contamination itself.
Um We are currently in review
of that, you are correct. This
is a really
large deal, I mean this
is a extremely
large
plume. I
fortunately had the
privilege to work in the
environment environmental
field for a number
of years prior to coming into N MD
and it worked in different states
doing clean up and
investigations of these types of
deal of these types of
contamination. And
what we have here
is extraordinary
because of the um
the sheer size
of the groundwater plume itself,
the depth that groundwater
exists at the site. You know, we
have a 450 ft
of soil between groundwater
and the surface um
other states
uh you know,
are not dealing with
that
amount of
hurdles to try and
get into characterization.
Um With that said, though
um additional
wells have been put in place, there was
two monitoring wells that I had mentioned
in my presentation that
were added to the source zone to
tie up some
data gaps.
There has been extensive
review of data,
both soil vapor and
also in groundwater
to ensure that past
data are
are correct and how they are being
presented. New data and
new techniques and
technologies
are being put in place
specifically
with the soil
vapor
monitoring work
plan and also the
groundwater monitoring
work plan. Those
two plans were revised
in 2024
changing
the sampling methods,
methodologies
to a more agreed
upon more widely used
practice
and and that in
part is also double
checking and validating
past
activities that have been done
just to make sure that we
are
ensuring that you know,
the data are inclusive of
everything for determining
that
the
investigative phase being
complete. So trying to make
sure that yes, those monitoring
wells are fully
capturing what we are
trying to identify
and also what we're planning on cleaning
up. Excellent  Mr.
Chair, I am
obviously I'm not a scientist,
but one of the things that our
experts were saying was
the plume given
where the monitoring wells
were back then
could be, you know,
hypothetically, it could be,
you know, much bigger
because of the gaps
in in data And
so I don't know that we
thought two
additional ones were
sufficient. Were these two?
And if you said it, I apologize,
were these two soil
monitoring or were they
the in the aquifer?
Because that was a big concern
to us? I mean, not in the aquifer
in the
uh wells
because one of the issues that we
thought was happening was
they were locating
them in places
where the plume.
Uh
if I remember this,
um that, that they
weren't accurate because
the aquifer isn't just one
big.
Um
you know, aquifers
have different uh
levels and they
have different, they're
composed of sand
and, and different things. And
so as I recall, the experts
are saying, they're not locating them
where the water is most.
Um it moves,
moves.
Um I don't
know, our experts were,
were very concerned
about whether this plume was a
accurately measured.
I didn't get a real sense of
like it's being accurately
measured now or whatever.
Um I got more of
a we're looking into it.
Is that an accurate character
characterization of your
testimony,  Mr.
Chair,
Mr.  Chair Senator.
So we are
that, that's one of the, one of the parts
of what we're doing in
our review right now is that
we're, we're going through and
validating to make sure that
that is in fact, what is
being
being looked at. So
as we're going through that
review, we're, we're also trying
to check and make sure that
everything is in
line because
we have not published our
comments yet.
I'm not at
liberty to
say kind of where everything is at.
But with that said,
there has been
ongoing monitoring and
data that are showing
that the extent
of the plume
both
it's actual, let
me clarify. So the interim
measures that is currently in place
for groundwater
has been a very
successful
process in
protecting any
migration
to
a receptor. So the
groundwater extraction,
well, for
public service,
the
while that interim measure
that pump and treat has been going
on, there has been
active monitoring and
data that shows that
the ethylene Diro
my plume. So the eb
plume, which is
the fastest spreading
plume. Right.
Right. It has
shrunk in size,
the the the overall
extent of that
plume has decreased
due to the interim
measures that is currently in place.
That is it is a great win in
that sense, the
the
the benzene
plume, which is the other one
that is being tracked. Now, there
are other constituents that are in water,
but by
tracking benzene, by
tracking E DB, that
is inclusive of those other
contaminants which
are also being treated.
If when they go through
the interim measures,
pump and treat
system set up to handle all
of it. Um
with, with the benzene plume, it
has been noticed that it
is very
slow moving, slow
moving and has
been relatively
stable
over the last
several years, which is also
a good thing that that's not migrating
somewhere where we don't want
it to be.
It's, our data
is not picking up. How
do I put this? It
depends and if,
whether the the
monitoring wells
are correctly
monitoring it, like if it,
if there are gaps
and it's moving
in someplace we didn't have.
And that was what our experts concerns
were, was that, that,
you know, they weren't
comfortable with the number
and the location of some
of these monitoring
wells.
And I don't know if you're comfortable,
but our experts weren't
let me that to
Mr.  Chair. Let
me
Mr.  Chair, Senator.
Thank you for that question. And I would
note that that phase
one RF I which is what
this most recent
report submitted builds
off of it identified
a data gap in the shallow
groundwater that
needed more monitoring points.
So since then, we've installed
23 shallow
monitoring wells with
contingency screens that
as water table continues to
increase, which we've also
used predictive modelling by
the US GS in this phase
two report to show
that it's expecting
at an extreme around like 40
to 50 ft, probably
more realistic around 30
ft. And those contingency screens
were placed to ensure
that we can continue to monitor that
shallow most area which
is typically the highest impacted
by contaminants. So
to ensure we can keep characterizing
that as we move forward and
currently have that characterized
excellent because that was exactly
the problem that the and
you articulate in a
better way than I did.
So. Thank you.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair and Senator
if I can just add from the utility
perspective, um
uh The,
we have had we have new data
points which are very useful for
characterizing it. Um We
also have the continue
the inner measure
which with
that pump Andry
with that and our data gap.
Well, we feel
like the risk
of expansion of
that plume is fairly well managed
based on our modelling. Um I
think as I said in my
presentation, our concern now
is just having a
contingency in place
in the event that something
changes, no monitor network is
perfect. Uh that
we have a backup plan to,
to act on in the case
that, you know, things
aren't as well characterized as we think they are
at the moment, but they at least
offsite, they seem
um
better known than they were at that
time. Uh And then for me,
my concerns have primarily been
um on site, for example, in
Bullhead Park. Uh
there are very few deep
soil vapor monitoring wells. There's
only a few of them where
the majority of them are on base,
um which is
creates a little bit of gap in
understanding that
at depth migration of that
fuel offsite, which
we know it is offsite, but
figuring out exactly where that's one of
the concerns I I have
with the site right now.
Well, and even if it's inside,
it's still, you know, the
water, the water tables don't
know boundaries of what's air
force property and what's not.
Um And so that, that's
also a concern. Well, I
appreciate your work. I know
that somebody from the state usually
shows up when the, when
the air Force
comes and does its presentations,
I think, how often are they now
quarterly? Um
And you know, I appreciate
that as, you know, it has an
engendered resounding
confidence in,
in
some members of the public
about this.
Um But has, you
know, I guess the proof is in the pudding
um as, as we go
on and I really, I am
glad for the interim meas measures.
I mean, it does
help that they're doing
the interim measures. But
how this long in the
investigation phase
is what makes some of my
constituents say, can't
believe they're still in
the investigation phase.
When in their
minds in my mind too, we should
be cleaning it up
and interim
phase.
I mean, it's something
but, you know, it doesn't give
us a lot of confidence
that, you know, we're
never going to be worried. Our, our, we
will never be affected. We
just, you know,
so anyway, I appreciate very
much the work
and know that
we're, we're, we're
very concerned and there are a lot of people
in the district very
concerned about this. Thank
you. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank
you. OK.
I just have a
question or two. We have
been talking about this a long time,
but these issues take a long
time, but it's a little bit like Groundhog
Day sometimes because
years later you feel like you're having
the same conversation.
Um So I just kind of want to
go back to the last time we had a
conversation, at least my memory
serves and
um and ask you Miss B
Bicknell
Bicknell pronounce. Um It
felt like last time we had this
conversation, it was a little bit,
we weren't on quite on the same page
maybe. And there was a desire
for closer
collaboration
to get on the same page. Do you feel
like that's improved?
At least
uh  Mr.  Chair? No, I do
not feel that that has improved.
Um However,
our response because
it is uh
the NME D's difficult
role to act as the middleman and
manage all the stakeholders at the site.
We're working with them, we have great working
relationship with them and I
appreciate that um
beyond that and, and
do the lack of that
collaborative environment between the
three of our groups here.
Um Again, this contingency
plan and renewal
of this agreement
gives us some of that
redundancy. And
um so that
safety factor that we wouldn't, that we
could otherwise get through collaboration
that, you know, that we're in the rooms.
We're, we're hearing the discussions, we're
hearing what the decisions are gonna be
without that, we need
something else to
ensure that our water is protected
in the event of the worst case scenario.
So that's been our
response to
the um the
environment. Well,
and I, and I, I'm, I'm asking
you because I think you're kind of the
customer in a way you're the end
consumer, you're the, you're the
water customer here in
Burnley County and you
have the regulator and then of course, the
Air Force, the, the,
the entity that
caused the pollution.
So, uh but I know
you're doing your best uh or
you're working hard anyway, but
let me ask you from your standpoint,
what is the disconnect
and what would you like to see
to improve the
communication and the project
itself just to kind of
high level it for
us? Sure,  Mr.
Chair. Um
there was a point in time
with the site, particularly around
when that um public
system was installed where
uh NMED, the Water Authority
of the Air Force worked very closely
together and we were
in technical
discussions with each other
about the best way to protect
drinking water supply. And
through that, the Water Authority
um printed some money to pay for some
modelling that was used to
cite that first extraction.
Well, that model was then
used to, to cite the
other extraction wells.
Um At that time, there was a
lot of communication
um where we
were aware of
the decisions that were going to be made and
knew exactly how they were going to
impact us and we
were communicated in
a way that we were comfortable with those
decisions
that unfortunately isn't happening.
Now, um
We, we go to
public presentations and we receive
updates um in a very formal
matter. Um But that kind
of
dynamic and
organic discussion
ensuring that we're all acting in the best
interests of, of cleaning the site up
is has been lacking in recent
years. Do you
have active
conversations about
that at a kind of a base level,
technical level and
collaborative level before
decisions are made.
Um  Mr.  Chair, we
do with we, we provide
our, our
positions to
NMED, who
then communicates those
um to,
to the Air Force. We also provide
formal written comments, nmed,
which are available on the public
record. So our, our stance is
very public. Um but
the exact close
communication is, is not
there between us and,
and the Air Force at least feel like
a little bit like a judge in a
divorce matter. But
um why, why
is that the case?
And why is
that the case? Are, are you invited to
meetings to have conversations
or you specifically not
included with those kinds of
conversations?
Uh  Mr.  Chair, uh in
the last year, we've been invited
to one meeting
um which was
a great first step. It was to
discuss possible
changes to the groundwater
pump and treat system.
Um We
were able to hear
what the Air Force plan
was. Um
However,
the
discussion part afterwards
was, was lacking. So we
had to provide our, our formal
comments in written
form. Um We weren't really
able to have the discussion that I was hoping we'd
have during that meeting.
Thank you and JD
uh by
law are,
is the
responsible party for lack of
putting it maybe a more appropriate
legal way. Are they
required to work
with
like Miss mcnellis group
where they just required to work
with you and
therefore we kind of
legally meeting the
the bounds of how
collaboration should
occur.
Mr.  Chair,
there's
legally
speaking,
we have stakeholders that
are a part
of the process
themselves and those
they are
entitled to having, you know,
information that is given, you know,
they can give
their, their position on it
and information can be given to
them. Um It
is highly encouraged
to bring high
level stakeholders, ones that
have a lot of stake in
what is going on specifically
with a situation like this where
you have a
water authority that
you know, that
resource that they are,
you know, overseeing
and providing to the
public for consumption
be protected
is highly encouraged that they are
integrated in that
process to identify
from a different perspective,
how decisions
for clean up and everything are
ran. Um
But as
far as a
legal
responsibility
to
include on technical
discussions, I don't believe that
is in the regulation
from a regulatory
standpoint.
All right,  Mr.  Workman, do you
want to add anything to kind
of the sentiment here,
Mr.  chair members of the committee?
Thank you for that question. And I'd
say from the Air Force's
perspective, it's really where
we are in the project that
drives a lot of the
collaboration when
we're figuring out where to put an
interim measure, looking
at real time data as it comes in.
But over the last
half decade or so, we've
just been monitoring and
reporting those all publicly
available. And as
we submitted the
phase two RF I which is
also shared with everyone
really documents our full
position on this project
and the collaborative
nature of this project will
likely increase and actually,
it's legally bound
within that corrective measures
evaluation phase where you have a
public comment period
on the selected remedy.
And just that is a legal
framework to
that is the air
force and enemy d are accountable
to include all stakeholders
engagement at that
time.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, you know,
dealing with a lot of these issues
across the state, you know, with
Los Alamos and the National
Labs and you've just been
here for the presentations with the
military bases. I think we
have a lot of
communication issues.
Sometimes it stems from
respect issues, you know, and
not really
treating the uh treating
the, you know,
the land, the landowner,
the local citizen with
enough respect and consideration
for what's going on with them. So, I
don't know, I just would
encourage the more communication the
better, you know, and we are
bearing a desire for that
and, you know, you're
from this community or you went to
college here. But anyway, so I would
hope that you just
would have as much regular
communication as you
can.
Um
So little,
little extra doesn't hurt,
you know. So
let me have, I have a question for
you which is
um the
uh corrective phase. How long do you
anticipate that will
take once you
determine that
Mr.  Chair members of the committee?
Thank you for that question.
The, the
corrective measures evaluation
phase is relatively
a shorter time period. This could
be multiple years,
probably not more than
five. Hopefully two
would be the the ballpark
of that because this again, it's
an iterative process where we
have to share our
evaluations. The
state has to select the remedy.
We want to allow time for that public
comment, but it's more of an
administrative process.
The big timetable
is going to be when we get to that implementation
phase. So that will be
once the the remedy is
selected and you execute
that until you reach your cleanup
goals. So that
could be on more of a decade
timescale. But again, I can't really
project into that because
we need to get through that
evaluation. And once a
remedy is selected, then
a more concrete timetable on
the back end can be established
for what it's gonna take to reach
our goals. Do
you anticipate
being able to fully clean
it up to
where all the
contaminants, all the fuel or
whatever will be removed?
That that's gonna be fully
vetted within the corrective measures,
evaluation and
in that, yeah, we're responsible
for everything above
action levels.
So,
sounds good. Ok. Anything
else committee? All right.
Thank you. All again. I appreciate you
being here today.
Good
luck.
Ok.
Our headlining Act carbon
dioxide sequestration.
Little. Did you know
one
be a
sandwiches?
Yeah, perhaps. Thank you
for
that
committee. Good
news. Um
They are serving lunch.
So if you're hungry and you're ready for
lunch. I think it's like a box lunch
kind of a deal.
Thank you. You and
M
Floor is yours?
Thank you. Others in the
audience that are hungry. If
just let the committee grab a lunch
and then if there's extra
you. Thank you,  Mr.
Chair. My co councils advises me
that judges hand out harsher
sentences before lunchtime.
So I encourage you all to go get
the largest slice of cheese
pizza that you
can find. Um,
my name is Ben Shelton. I'm the
Deputy Secretary for Administration
at Energy Minerals and Natural Resources.
And it is my pleasure
before just we begin to
introduce you to Albert
Chang, who is our new oil
conservation director, which also
makes him the chair of the Oil
Conservation Commission and
by operation of law,
the state petroleum engineer.
So he's a man of many titles.
He
has the rare distinction of being
both of licensed engineer
and licensed attorney. And I actually
learned about 20 minutes ago. He's also got
an MP A master's in public
administration. So uh
very accomplished and we're very, very
lucky to have him on
board and he will introduce himself in just
a minute. I also want to make sure I flag Ben
Baa back here who is our
new policy director.
It's spelled B AJ
E MA but pronounced
Baa's Dutch
spelling. Um He will be taking over
for Sammy Cow.
So, uh of
course, every staff
member at Emer is at all of your
disposal at all times.
However, if you have a question, you're not
exactly sure where to go with it or you
don't know the right person,
Ben, is it frequently going to be the
shortest distance between A to b
uh between, between
a short answer for
you?
Um So
uh making sure everyone's got the
deck, I think at this point,
I can turn it over to Albert
to
begin.
Um I'm not sure what else I can
say about myself, but uh I've
spent the last 2.5 years with M
Nerd in the mining and minerals division.
So um happy to be
here and do what I can
um and look
forward to working with all of you to
um to
keep advancing Oc D's
mission.
Uh So
diving into the deck first slide
here, um
the underground injection
wells in the United States
are, are regulated just as
background uh under the
Federal Safe Drinking Water Act.
The act controls specific
circumstances under which
fluids may be injected
underground. Uh
Underground injection
control regulations promulgated
under the act separates
or created six different classes
of underground injection permits.
Class one wells are for industrial
and municipal waste disposal wells.
You can kind of follow along in the graphic
there. Class
two for oil and gas which
we already permit over at CD.
Class three are
used for solution
mining pretty
rare. Sometimes you'll see it used
for Inu Leach of
uranium. Um
Class four wells are
shallow hazardous and radioactive
waste injection wells. Class
five are for nonhazardous
fluids and probably the
most important for us today.
Um Classixx
wells are used to inject
carbon dioxide into deep rock
formations for
long term underground storage.
Long term underground storage of carbon
dioxide is also known as geologic
sequestration and it is
an important element of
carbon capture and storage
technologies
that can help
reduce carbon emissions into
the atmosphere
on to the next slide
class six regulations are
designed to protect public
health and drinking water
again under the safe drinking Water Act
from some of the unique challenges
associated with injecting
carbon dioxide underground,
um potentially large
volumes of gas,
right. And also relative
buoyancy of carbon dioxide side
underground means that there's
tendency for it to migrate
upwards of
viscosity or subsurface
mobility in lateral directions,
depending on the matrix of the rock.
Also important to consider.
And then lastly because carbon
dioxide like your sodas
tends to form carbonic
acid uh with water
under pressure. Um
There's corrosion
concerns that
are
need to be considered as well
and to address those risks. Classics,
wells requirements and
regulations include site
fairly extensive site
characterization
requirements to ensure that the
geology in the proposed
area can safely
receive and
contain the carbon dioxide within
the intended injection zone.
Um There's requirements to
predict using computer modelling
which we'll talk about in just a second,
uh the extent
of the injected um
plume and to identify
the areas that could be
impacted, not just by the plume
itself, but also the
pressure that it
exerts on the underground
formations. Well,
construction requirements are also
in place to prevent carbon
dioxide or other formation
fluids from leaking outside
of the zone, uh the
intended injection zone or the
area of review.
Um And then there are also operational
requirements such as testing and
monitoring requirements to
ensure ongoing integrity
of the injection wells, particularly
as it relates to uh corrosion
concerns that we just talked
about. And then
lastly, of course, at the end of the life
cycle, there is going to be a
require, there are uh
fairly extensive
requirements to plug
injection wells in a manner that
prohibits any unintended
migration of
injected carbon dioxide. We
want to keep it where
it's intended to go.
Um The next slide
sort of shows uh
there's a picture there of
sort of the the logic flow
diagram as well as the uh
diagram of an
area of review. For an
example of a of a injection
project, computational
modelling is a
mandatory and essential
tool uh for the
permitting and review of classics
permitting. Uh Classics wells.
These models
predict the
behaviour of the
injected carbon dioxide
underground and ensure
permanent containment
of the
CO2.
These models predict the
extent of the injected
plume and the
footprint on the land
surface above the subsurface
area that's influenced
by the carbon dioxide injection is
called the area of
review. Uh
Operators of classics wells
must identify other wells.
I know it's kind of hard on the printout to
see, but there's I promise there are
little dots on there where this
particular proponent
has um
identified other wells
within that area of review
because it is important to ensure
that as CO2 goes down
underground and pressures go
up in this entire area
that it doesn't
come back out or leak through other
wells that exist in that
area.
Um And I'll pass it
over
Deputy Cabinet Secretary.
Um Thank you, Albert. So a couple
of notes before we move off of slide
four, I'm gonna come back to that one, especially
as I start dealing with questions.
So maybe flag slide
four because at least for me as a nonen
engineer having that visual
aid for what these projects
actually look like is really, really
helpful. Um
The second note, I just
want
sorry slide
four is our, is the one that's got the little
map on it on the left side
and the flow chart. So that
um and
Albert mentioned that it's a
little difficult to see, but you can
kind of see a lot of little dots
scattered around the exact locations are
not as important as just your ability to
see that there are some
dots there. But we'll come back to that in a
moment. The other thing I want to
say our flag is that,
you know, the last time I think that we all discussed
this issue is about one o'clock in the
morning, at least those of you in the
Senate.
Um
And, and it
was a
and it was
different because we
were sort of explaining a
lot of these things, a lot of our permit
process, a lot of our interaction with
or with EPA a little bit in
the abstract that doesn't need
to be explained in the abstract anymore.
If you go to our announcements page
at OC D's website,
you can see the side by side.
We have 260 pages
laying out all of the federal requirements,
all of the areas where at least
for parts of the rule
where we are proposing to go a little
further.
Um So I'm
not going to drag you through
264 pages
of CFRS
today. But if
you are looking for a lot more granularity
than I get to, that's a place you can go
and find it.
Uh OK. So I
would like to move now to
slide five,
which is a, a
slide that is designed to give you an
idea of the level of activity
that is currently happening
nationwide um
on this kinds of permit,
permit activity,
sorry.
OK. Green,
it's the green map. It's got
some red and
blue
numbers. Yeah.
Um And this is really just designed for
your reference and I'll move through these slides
a little, a little bit more quickly
because this is all sort of background. And I
think you're more interested in what we're
doing for our rule here in New Mexico,
but this is just designed to give you some national
context.
The next slide is classic
primacy activity.
Um This is the multicolored
map.
Um And this is to give you an idea
of what nationwide
other states are doing with regards to
pursuing this permit
authority. Um
You can see some of our neighbours in
particular are
either already have this authority
or midstream
um attempting to
get it the numbers, sort of the
colored numbered
sections of the country, those
are EPA regional offices.
Um So you can kind of see we are
in with region six.
So Texas, Oklahoma,
Aas, Louisiana. But that just gives you
an idea of sort of how EPA
breaks the country up for regulatory
purposes.
And then on the right, you can see there's just a
little chart
kind of laying out where different
states are and their phases of
application and apparently the
smallest text that we can find
to put that in for
you.
Um our primacy
overview uh
just gives you procedurally
some uh sort
of a timeline of
what we're looking at some of the con
constraints that we're under.
Um we were awarded
from, from EPA
$1.9 million
to, to pursue this project. We
are under contract with the Mexico
Tech uh who
has who with our
subcontractors have been leading
a lot of the um
nitty gritty process of
reading all the C FRS and putting
together proposals for
us.
OK. So
let's talk timeline and we'll, there'll
be another way to we have sort of a
gant chart at the very
end where we'll talk timeline too. So
this is not your only opportunity
to get your head on it. But the
important part for this one is if you
look at those yellow boxes
seven and eight, that's basically
where we are
now.
Um There
also and I will talk about this
more, but there you'll
see that sort of that state level
public comment arrow pointing
at box number seven. And
you may be wondering, well,
why do my constituents
know? Has there been public
comment? This
is uh
bas basically a Multiphase
public comment process. We have
been kind of on a roadshow around
the state. We went to communities that we
think could be impacted in Carlsbad
in Farmington to sort of meet with
stakeholders and hold some workshops
around some of this work. But all
of this is pre rule
comment. So
as you know, when we do
big rule makings like this, especially
particularly technical ones,
we'll be taking public comment from
everybody and anybody who would
like to show up and speak to us about what they
think, either from a very, very technical
perspective, needs to be in the rule or
even just from a very high level
values background, what they think the rule
ought to address. Um
So I want to just
take this first opportunity to
emphasize that if you
are worried about making sure that
you and your constituents
have the opportunity to provide
public comment
um on the rule that you're gonna have
a lot of that in front of you. In
addition to the, to the comment
that you've had already, you'll
be able to make it directly to
Albert at
occ laboriously
over many, many
hours.
Uh New Mexico's class six
rulemaking approach is our next
one. This is just sort of talking about how
we internally set up some of our values,
some of the pillars that we are looking
at um as we
put together
um this
rulemaking.
Um and you know, it's,
it's, I'm always sort
of impressed by the
way that
we
are treating the rule making
procedurally kind of
echoes the things that are
actually that we are wanting to
prioritize for the state inside
of the rule itself. You think about
things like community engagement.
Um uh
There's a lot more
in the rule in our rule
proposal
to deal with that than the CFR requires
really
our draft class six components.
And the reason again, I've broken this
out into a pie chart is because
there's a lot of that, a lot
of it, it is
um
depending on your definition
of fun, not very fun
reading.
Um So this is just broken out to give you
an idea of what the bulk
of the rule is addressing when we, when
we go through
this.
Um and then this is uh moving
into the NM draft rule testing
and monitoring requirements. I'm on
the page with lots of little New Mexico
flags.
Now on the
back of it just making sure everyone's
keeping up.
Um
Just to give you an idea of a, of
a sampling of some of the areas where
we are kind of trying to
take um
every box that we think is going to be
really relevant uh for
New Mexicans here in terms of what we're
monitoring. Monitoring
is a very big deal. This is something that came, a
lot, came up a lot during the
legislative session
um When we were
debating uh
House Bills 4
57 4
58. Um
we heard a lot of
both supportive and critical
responses that, that
the monitoring needed to be
very, very stringent. So that got built
in a lot of what has
changed in the rural package.
And in our crosswalk between
today and
March when
we last had the chance to talk about this
war is basically incorporating
things that both we heard from
you all in the course of debates
as well as incorporating
um items
of the House Bill
458 which did
pass and then 457
some of the items in 457
which were supported, even though that bill didn't
pass. And we heard, we heard
support for, we're trying to build
some of that in
um that will be in sort of the
uh skate package.
So procedurally
speaking, I want to
make sure I'm not getting hit on my slides
here.
OK, good. I'm not procedurally speaking,
we have submitted a crosswalk
but they call a crosswalk and it's really
just a comparison of our,
what we want to
do what the CFR
requires. Um
Again, that's you, you can follow
along with that on the website if you want.
But the um the
crosswalk that we've submitted the EPA
at this point was limited in
scope.
So if you are looking for
what was submitted
to the EPA so
far for their
first sort of informal
review,
uh and you don't see some of
the things from House Bills.
457 and 458
is because that crosswalk was
submitted only within the
bounds of the minimum federal
criteria. The feds aren't
requiring us to do the amount of
consultation or testing that we
do that we're going to want to propose
to do so. They weren't really interested
when we suppo when we supported that
or when we put that
in, that will
be part of our rule making
before the occ
later
on.
So you can see here, we've pulled out
another sample of some of the language
around community engagement that we are
building into the
rule. Um
As a proposal.
Uh These
are generally, again, generally
speaking, things that go above and beyond
what the CFRS require, the CFRS
will say things like you
must do community engagement
and then they kind of rely on
the states to either codify
or just institutionalize the best
practice for what that means. We're choosing to
codify it in the
rule.
Um And final thoughts and next
steps,
um you
can kind of see this is this is the
gant chart um that
can maybe help you with the timeline. The
little red line vertically as you can
see is still back in June that this
chart needs to get updated. We are
um
alarmingly already in
September. So, but
we are for the most part on
schedule, we are just about
ready for what you can in
in task six, that
large blue chart to under
undergo state rulemaking. That's
kind of where we are right now. We are just
preparing, we're trying to get our final
stakeholder
comments and try to get as much
as we can incorporated before
we file. As I'm sure many
of, you know, once you get into this rulemaking
process, it gets
a little more formalized and it's about
introduction of evidence and things like that. So
the amendment process gets a little
bit less flexible.
We have the ability now
before filing to be a little bit more
nimble in what we're incorporating, if we
can identify things are
particularly controversial. So
we're trying to sort of get that, get
that all wrapped up, but we anticipate
filing
um hopefully very, very
soon.
Um
Let me
see
the public comment for this, by
the way, the, the pre
rule submission,
public comment is open right
now. Um We opened
this late
last month. It will be
open until September
26th.
Um In case
you have constituents who really
want to weigh in on this or,
you know, it's not too late to organize. Of course,
a legislative letter of
unconditional
bipartisan support.
Um But that does
close on the, on the
26th. We have had
a couple of um stakeholder
meetings rather than May and July
uh and Carlsbad in Farmington.
But we're also open to
um other geographic
outreach. If you
uh if you have
ideas for that, that is on the O
CD again, that's on the
2025 0 CD
announcements and
news releases page where you can
track all of that. You can
see the crosswalk for the rule. You can
see the announcement for the for
the public feedback
and see all of that. And I think we
have a hyperlink to that on our
contact information on the very
last page there as well.
So um if
and when you, you should have, I think Sarah's
got a digital copy of
this. You should be able to click that link and
follow it and it'll just take you straight
there.
That is the end of our deck. And I think
we're ready to
take questions from the
committee.
Thank you very much, Ben.
Do you want to say
anything?
Ok. You're just there for
cover. All
right, committee
questions, Senator
Pinto. Thank you. Thank
you,  Mr.  Chairman of the
committee.
So when you talk about
community engagement, can
you give me a couple of
statements that maybe
tribal
um constituents?
May
Mr.  Chairman
Senator Pinto? We haven't received any
comments yet on the, on
the docket that's open until
the 26th.
Uh I don't
have the record from, I'm trying
to think our probably our Farmington
meeting is when we would have received
most of those that was back in May and I
don't have the record in front of me.
So  Mr.  Chair and
secretary. So you
say Farmington
does Farmington lie
within the Navajo
nation?
Mr.  Chairman and
Senator. No, I
don't believe it does lie
within the boundaries of the nation.
And  Mr.  Chair and secretary,
have you had any meeting
on the Navajo Nation?
Uh  Mr.  Chair
and Senator.
No.
So  Mr.  Chair, one of the
proposals I understand
is to
turn the one
of the sites
into carbon
sequestration.
Um
And so do
you have a newsletter that goes
out from your department?
Mr.  Chair and Senator, we have a lot of
newsletters that go out. I don't know
that we have one specific to
class six to
this particular push.
And do you have  Mr.  Chair, do you
have a secretary? Do you have any data
on who those subscribers
are?
The
Mr.  Chair or madam
chair? I'm sorry, I I
am subscribers
to. So could you
say that the
subscribers to your
letter or newsletter
that goes out are
really, you know, out
there in New Mexico,
um
representative
of the state of New
Mexico or
what would you say?
I mean, if you don't have the data, I assume
you don't know who is actually
subscribing, which
probably could just be the people in
this room. And that's it, madam
chair, Senator Pinto. Let me
sorry. I think I wasn't clear in
my previous answer. I apologize.
We do not have a newsletter
specific to class six that
goes out. Thank
you and  Mr.  Chair madam
chair and
or madam co-chair
the um
so this outreach
that you're saying community
outreach, how
is that actually conducted
or how do these policies
and guidelines actually
be announced
that there's open
for a public comment?
Thank you madam chair and
Senator. There's a couple of ways. So
for our community
stakeholder
meetings that we had
in May and June, those
were um
those were publicized on our
website, those were publicized on the
host website as well. So that
was belief San Juan
College in
Farmington.
Um
I,
I think I know
madam chair, I'm sorry, it
was five months is a long time
ago. But that,
that's my understanding of, of how
we push that out. And then there will be another
notice process as we begin the
rule making. So we are kind of
required when we initiate rule
makings to post notices
about that rulemaking in various
places.
And the reason I'm really
asking all these questions
about it because
there's a transmission line that's
getting put up through my community
and none of the um
community members were aware
of it. So they're like
delivered the the
polls and then the next day
we're having a meeting. So
really sometimes this is just
a checkoff list. You can
put it in your bill. Make
it sound nice. Say, oh, it's the
community
San Juan College is not
on the reservation.
Can you tell me how
many of those
people that were
notified were actually
part of the Navajo
nation?
Mr.  Chair Senator. I
don't have that information. I'm
sorry. So
one of the other things that's
happened too is,
you know, the Yazzie Martinez
case is um they're
saying, well, they were doing community
outreach but there has
not been one meeting on the Navajo
nation. Um
And which is one of the largest
tribes represented in the State
of New Mexico. I hope you're
aware of that
secretary.
And
so wouldn't you say,
well, we're going to put this in the bill
and it, it sounds nice.
Um I don't believe it's
really happening. So, yeah, we had
a meeting in Farmington,
but that is not on
the Navajo nation that does not
represent any of our tribes
nations and Pueblos,
especially when we talk about
the State Collaboration
Act and meeting
those criteria, especially
within a department for
such
a,
yeah, I guess
the commitment to do
such
a,
I don't know, I'm not, I'm not
very supportive of it because
it is,
um,
does it seem like we're,
we're gonna really do much
to
tackle
when they talk about economic
development and building this? They're
like, oh, there's gonna be some jobs
but most of this is all
turned over electronically
to online or some kind
of internet. Um
in which maybe three or four people
are working there. Um
in the long term,
um There's some short
term, you know,
positive stuff that
seems to happen
but to really say you're
engaging.
Um
it doesn't seem like it's gonna happen,
especially when I also
know that I still
see spools of internet
sitting at our dot
um
offices and our substations
out on the Navajo nation.
So when you say the internet and
it's there maybe in your
eyes that is the outreach
that
you think is enough, but I
don't think it is.
So. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
Thank you, Secretary
Repton.
Thank you  Mr.  Chairman and thank
you for your presentation. I
unfortunately did not get to
hear this bill. I was not at this
session at this time um
during this time. So
I'm, I'm just shocked that it made it through,
but it
did.
And I, I think my biggest
concern is
um when we talk
about monitoring and
leaking and all
the things that could possibly
happen.
Um
It happens all the time with gas
and oil and, and not much is done.
So, I'm glad you're hope you have
a big job and you have a great
mentor there, but you have a big
job that, um
because
we see too much from
gas and oil, too much waste
and fraud,
just
leaking and pollution
and not following the
law and it just
continues to happen. We
see seismic activity
constantly lowle
but quite a bit
right. A lot of seismic
activity. How does seismic
activity affect
this?
Um To
Steinborn and
Representative
Siana,
it
is
a,
that's certainly one of the criteria
to review um
classics injection wells as
part of the permitting process. There
are already federal rules in place
and we can look at the crosswalk
for the proposed rules here, whether
or not they need to be more stringent, certainly
a conversation to be had right now
before those rules are
presented. Um But certainly
that is one of the
elements that needs to be reviewed
during a classixx proposal
permitting process to ensure
that it does not
um
create further or,
or create seismicity
incidents or seismicity
concerns.
How long have you been in New Mexico?
Can I ask you?
Five years, five years? OK.
So you should have an idea of what
happens there.
Um
There should be, you say a lot, there
should be, there should be, there should be and a lot
doesn't happen when it comes to gas and
oil. So I don't see it making
a big difference here.
Um, II, I
feel like,
um,
it doesn't matter what rules we
have. Um, we
never have enough people to,
to enforce them
though. You are doing a great job in, in
feeling, getting more people to
monitor and,
and, um,
I'm not sure the wells and, and
uh compliance
is it getting better,
Is, is compliance
on, you know,
um pollution,
the different things that happen through gas
and oil are, is that, is that
getting better? Because if we're going to do
this and compliance
isn't good there, how is it going to be good
here,
Mr.  Chair representative, you know,
that's a, that's a tricky question.
It's kind of a loaded question in a lot of ways
because compliance for
different things moves in different
directions. I will say that for instance,
our methane capture like our methane
waste rules which got
sort of laid in in
2021. We've been
on a good trajectory for
compliance with the methane waste
rules.
But when
you get compliance
in one area, it tends to get a
little, uh
you, you can see backsliding others.
One of the areas where it's been a challenge
is water
releases,
right? This is something that has
grown a lot as we
see the second
largest industry in New Mexico,
which is water treatment,
water disposal,
water transportation,
just dealing with wastewater in the
oil field really is a billion dollar
business in the state. And
we are seeing a, we have
seen an uptick in
issues regards
with uh regarding handling,
mishandling that water. So that's,
that's been one of the
challenges. So compliance is always a
function of where
is most of the work happening. And you
know how, how we
had an opportunity to lay stuff in
like the waste rule. So
it kind of is going up and down
at the same time, depending on which
lens you're using to look at the
industry.
And then the last time I was in Carl's
bed, you could still see the flaring and the
venting happening. So
I don't know how,
how well it's
gotten, if it's gotten better, if
it hasn't. Um
But
to be honest, I, I don't have a
whole lot of
confidence in
what's happening now
and I, I,
I want to have it because I think
you're, you're, you're
great, you know,
you, you do
as much as you can with what you
have. But,
uh, this industry
that we're talking about, well,
the industry that I most
work with gas and oil is,
is just not following the rules
and it, it just,
it just
kills me to
see us doing more things
that could make it worse
and, and, and we're not
Texas, we have rules, we
have rules for a
reason.
I'm sorry,
maybe I shouldn't say that,
but I
just,
I wish I had been there because I don't, I,
I would have really fought against this.
But um
so
from what I was reading,
um groundwater
contamination, where are we,
is that poss, is there a possibility
of that?
How
Mr.  Chair and Representative,
I would describe the possibility
of groundwater contamination as being
pretty remote for a couple of reasons.
One is
similar reason that groundwater
contamination with
uh actual oil and gas
production is fairly rare. It's
just because of the depths that we're
operating at. We are typically
many thousands of feet below water
tables. Um
The injection formations that
we're looking at for carbon
sequestration are at
those same
depths and the process
of drilling through freshwater
aquifers and
sealing them off and
establishing that casing for
those well bores
is
pretty well established
and pretty well vetted
at this point. You have
great confidence in your pipelines and
everything as far as
pipelines and
anything like that, pipeline
security, we won't
see leaks and like
we do with gas and oil
or hopefully
not,
Mr.  Chairman Representative,
the pipeline issue
is a different one
that is a little out
of our scope
for this. We are primarily
concerned with once you put it
underground, how you get it
down there and what happens after you
put it down there? Pipeline
safety is a really big deal, the big
bad for carbons
restoration and the,
you know, the carbon leak,
the car, the CO2 leak that
people point to is a pipeline
failure fundamentally.
So that's definitely something
to keep an eye on. But generally speaking,
pipelines are APR C
issue.
I just
um
I have a bad feeling that something
major's gonna happen and it's gonna
happen soon and this
is going to contribute to
it.
But chair
and representative, I certainly hear
you, I understand that these
are, this is a very
large industry with, with
challenges and, and
lots of needs that.
Um And
I certainly look forward to taking
advice from this committee
and um from
on how
we can do better on all of
those issues. If
I may. I the
injection wells are already
currently allowed, they're just
currently being permitted under the
Federal EPA.
So one can only. So
my hope is and I don't
know if you're quite as much
of an optimist as I am perhaps
representative. But my
hope is that the
only difference here is whether we're bringing
this permitting, leaving it at the federal
level or bringing it here to New
Mexico. And I can
only hope that
if we are to bring
this type of permitting here to New
Mexico, that there will be
a more responsive
agency that you will have a
direct connection
through the Deputy Cabinet Secretary
and I to be able to
respond when there are
incidents,
not naive enough to tell
you that there will never be an incident
in the oil
and gas industry.
I can only hope that if
we are the regulatory
authority here in the state, that we are
hopefully more responsive to your
concerns and your constituents'
concerns than having to
wait for the federal EPA to
respond.
Thank you. II I hope
it is at the state level because I don't
have. Well, anyway,
thank you for your
response
Center
Pope.
Thank you  Mr.  Chair and
thank you for the presentation.
Um Like I told
you earlier, we won't keep you up till
one in the morning. I
think we're ready to go to a three or
four though. We were having
fun. We were
almost getting a taste
of what the other side of the aisle does,
you know, in the last night.
Um I, I just
think it was good that
um we had
this debate and this
discussion.
Um
I respect the
work that you do. We're
usually on the same side on these
issues and
uh but there were just a
disagreement,
you know, on this legislation,
nothing personal.
Could you touch a little
bit about? Um,
you mentioned,
you know, we did not pass
457 and Senate
Conservation
458 passed.
I know there was some amendments
done on 458 and I
believe you discussed
possibly implementing
something some of the
in maybe by
rulemaking in 458.
And so I want to get an understanding
of what's happening
there. And
before you answer, I guess my
concerns are,
I want to make sure that we are
not going around
the legislature on
really
some policy that we
voted down and
now we're really pushing
that through rulemaking. Can you help
me better understand
that?
Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman and Senator
Pope. The
bills 457
and 458
were both
introduced primarily
because again, because this is a
<Cooper> federalism
feature, we are not
necessarily acting under
state authority. We are
borrowing authority from the federal
government to enforce
portions of the Safe Drinking Water
Act,
which is the law of the land in New
Mexico now.
Um So
a lot of the language
in both 457 and
458 was
not strictly
needed for us
to do some of those things.
What we wanted to do is introduce
bills because we are
always
more comfortable and feel like we
are on sounder ground operating
off of state authority. So
we wanted to make sure that we have the
opportunity for the legislature to weigh
in and put more stringent
guardrails where they felt
fit. The
legislature declined
that opportunity in, in the
context of 457 but
was more interested in taking it in
the context of
458. The
amendments that were put into
458 were
things that without
statutory authority,
we would not have had been
able to do under the borrowed
authority from the federal government. That was
two things. One of
them was basically
codifying what is already
the law of the land through judicially
created law, which was who
owns poor space
under the ground.
We've been operating under, it's
called the American rule. There's a bunch
of dusty case law that sort of
establishes it,
but it is kind of
the majority way that
states do it and we've been operating in New
Mexico under that. But
again, I think
the last couple of years have been a really
great reminder
of why it's always better to operate off
of statute than relying on
case law even well settled
case law. Um
So that was one thing that it did. The
second thing that it did was it
created the fund
that the um that
permits would be depositing
the uh a fee
into, to
basically give O
CD the resources
needed to manage long
term liability
associated with some of these
formations.
Um And so
those are, those are the two things that sort
of in 458
that we could not have
done but for state
action.
So  Mr.  Chair
Deputy Secretary,
once again in the presentation,
I think so. Is there anything
being done in rulemaking that
really implements 457?
Anything from 457
into current policy?
Yes. And
specifically, those are
the community consultation
requirements for
projects for permits.
So there are a few things in
457
um
that
uh
that we moving forward within the rule
making. But the
biggest, the biggest one I would say
probably the bulk of the language
of 457 had to do
with how
permits in the state
are required to notify
people in communities
around where these projects
are designated
um in
order to let them know what is
happening and that's
the area. Those are the areas where
I think the state is.
We heard pretty loud
and clear that people are interested in
seeing the state go further
than the federal minimum requirements
are.
Thank you,
Mister, chair Deputy
Secretary.
So we talk about I I
think the discussion
with, with this was
really the need to do
something at the state
level because in some cases, this is
already happening at the federal level.
So is
this happening
from the federal level
on federal land, state land
or where can this actually
happen before we pass
this
legislation?
So  Mr.  Chair,
and I want to make sure because I
don't believe we have any of these
projects on state land but
private and federal land. I
think I'm not
sure Albert's giving me
side. So that, so that's
where, that's where it would
but speak. And again,
these, these projects have been permitted,
getting permitted in New Mexico
by the Dallas
Office for 20 years.
So we have these projects all over
the state. I don't know that we have
any in state trust
on state trust land, but that's a question for
c
thank you. And I, and I
think really the big
concern and I think uh the
chairman will probably have
some questions and a
part of his lively debate
on kind of the
responsibility going
to the state with a lot
of these projects and
um is
just really what we're
doing here. Um
Part of that debate was,
you know,
I would be supportive of this
if we're really trying to deal
with carbon
sequestration
and dealing with
climate change in our
environment. And I
know that's
one of the benefits of
what we're talking about here.
But my concern is
where these projects
happen in some
cases, it seems as if,
um, this
is being done
and it gives people
even more opportunity
to pollute or
increase
carbon in our
atmosphere. And that's,
this is not on you. And I
know that's not what you're doing here. You're
not pushing some scheme or, and
so that's not
what I'm saying
here, but it's
also a
concern
of
what we
want in our
state.
And my concern
is,
um, do we
want to be
a dumping ground again?
Do we want to be a
sacrificial zone
for the world's
pollution? And I
get from where the state's coming from,
I get where you're coming from. Dep Deputy
secretary to where
in some cases this is already
happening and let's do
it the right way and let's regulate
and make sure we have the
right actors.
But I think this is where a lot of
us really struggle with
this.
Um Because in
my view,
whether we
regulate or
we don't regulate,
if it's bad policy,
it's still bad policy in
my view with what
we're doing here. And
so I
appreciate the presentation.
I still want to put
it out there that I want
to make sure that in the future
and I understand what we're doing on the
rulemaking. I'm not
as concerned of which is what you
laid out as far as the
consultation of the community,
but I just want to make sure going
forward, we are
not implementing
anything from bills that
we rejected in the
legislature through
rulemaking. Um
I want to ensure that we
are providing enough
resources
for your
agencies and what you
do to make sure that we can do
this and make it the safest
and cleanest possible and we're
protecting our communities. And
so that's what our job is as
well. But I
still have
huge concerns with this,
um, in this direction we're
going once again
just because
something's happening at the federal
level and it's bad.
I just don't think we should imple
implement it to say, well, we can
make it better. It's still bad.
And so I'll give you a chance. I don't know if
there's any comments. Um You,
you don't have to, but I just
want to give you the opportunity.
Um Yeah, thank you. And just
to reiterate because I, I hear the
concern about the, um,
not, not doing end runs around the
legislature. The only, the only
piece from 457
that
kind of would not happen
without legislation. Is, is
that poor space ownership
piece everything else in
there was
um
within existing federal delegated
authority.
Thank you,  Mr.
Chair.
All right. Thank you,
Senator
Thornton.
Thank you  Mr.
Chair.
So I'm probably coming at this from
a different perspective
um
than the previous
speakers here with
regards to
sequestration of carbon
dioxide. Are there any areas
either done nationally or
internationally where this is actually being
performed today where
there successful
successful sequestration
of co
two
mis  Mr.  chair,
Mr.  Chairman and Senator
Thornton. Yeah, there are, there are many,
there are many in the state, there are many
in the region in the country and, and
internationally, these are
fairly, this is not new
tech,
it's good with that.
Um,
so where does the CO2 that
they're putting in? Where
does that come
from?
Uh, chair
and Senator that we are
agnostic to that in this
particular rulemaking. But
currently CO2
is sometimes a by product
of oil and gas production comes
out of the ground. Um
As and in theory,
if there are
um <Indus>,
if, if there
are proposals
in the future where people wanna uh
are able to
economically capture emissions
from factories or whatnot
and try to sequester it.
That's certainly I
know that that's an area of research
at the moment. Um
But this
rulemaking at the moment would be
agnostic as to where
that carbon dioxide is coming
from. Just how
can we per or how
do we regulate the
injection and storage of it
underground? And, and
not? Well, how
and who does it really? The, the
important part here is this
is not a brand
new unheard
of thing. This is just currently
being
permitted
more or less effectively
to vary, depending on your
perspective, but currently being
regulated uh and permitted
by the EPA. And the
only question is um
does New Mexico want to take
delegated authority to have
an in-state program?
Uh managing it with
potentially more stringent
requirements. Because when we take
delegation, we have an opportunity to
think more uh to add
our own gloss on
how we want to run this
program.
Thank you for that director. Uh
So  Mr.  Chair,
so I was questioning, I
guess the
if, if it's coming from other
sources, it
means it has to be transported
to be stored.
And so that would require
another set of infrastructure
associated with that. That's
kind of what I was trying to get
at. And my other
question is how much CO two
can be stored in these particular
reservoirs? Let's say, let's keep
it right now for the one that's
being considered in New Mexico.
Do we have any idea how
much CO two can be stored
in this
saline
type? Uh
environment?
Mr.  Chair Senator,
the estimates run in
many, many millions of tons
CO2 is a little different from
say water injection. Most of
our experience in the state is with water
CO2.
The properties of it are different
from water and that it's a little
compressible. So it's kind of like
a foam mattress as I understand
it. And again, this is, this is a
engineering
space engineer and
compress. So you
can kind of compress it. So the
pressure
fronts for this are
tend to be a little bit more
contained a
produce water which
changes the storage
estimates for the for the state
but many,
many millions of tons, many,
many millions of tons. So are
you, are you aware of how
much
Co2 New
Mexico puts out per
year? Rough, rough
estimate? Do you have a feel for
that?
I'm trying to see if Secretary Kenny
is still here,  Mr.  Chairman
Senator, I I
can answer that actually for you,
it's, it's about 46.5
million metric
tons per
year. Uh is
what's New Mexico's
portion of if you look at all
greenhouse gasses including methane,
it it comes out to about 75
to 100 and 14 million metric
tons. So if you include the
whole greenhouse gas effect.
Um
So my question is,
do you know what percentage that is of
the US greenhouse gas
emissions,
Mr.  Chair. No,
it's less than 1%
of the total us greenhouse
gas emissions. So, New
Mexico as an entire
state contributes less
than 1% of
the entire US
total emissions.
So
I'm coming at this from a little different
perspective as I said before.
Um So I'm wondering
again when I look at the cost
of putting together a
Classixx?
Well, the cost
basically are anywhere between
5 to $15
million per. Well,
um pretty
expensive, although not totally
expensive. Uh But that's
a pretty expensive.
Well, and
um and then the
question is, you know, how much can
we store
and given that we
produced less than
1% in total, we're
certainly not going to store all the
emissions of, of New
Mexico in this one
reservoir.
So he starts to ask the question,
is this really worth the
effort? This, that's kind of what
I'm getting to from an economic
perspective. Is this
really worth the effort? Given the fact
that we're less than 1% of the total
us proportion
of, of greenhouse
gas emissions. And we're
only going to take a portion of that and
store it below. So
given the costs associated with that,
is this really a,
a viable alternative?
So I'm sort of looking at this
holistically,
but I do think there is some benefit. The
potential benefit is
um if you're gonna be
drilling 6000
ft and going to where
this, where the
water is
the saline solution I just
came from,
we were down in, in, in El
Paso to look at their desalination
plant. And
we know we need water here in New Mexico.
So if we could use the Co two to
pressurize it to bring the
water back up and
then you and then create a desalination
plant. There's a potential
new source of water
and, and, and,
and this is brackish water. We're not
talking about produced water. We're talking about
brackish water that can be, you know,
less than 1000
tds type of
thing. So there's a
potential to
maybe get a dual
benefit out of this. If in
fact, you can pressurize it,
put it down there, store it and then
use that pressure to bring up the water
as well. In other words, use the
well for more than
just injection,
use it for also
bringing water up because we're,
we're always fighting for water here
and this would be a completely new source
of water. So
you, you could, you would help
me get some advocacy
if you could if there
were some technology to actually
look at using,
using it to do, get a dual
benefit out of it. So
that's all my comments with respect to this.
Thank you very much.
Thank you,
Senator Sudd
Lopez.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
Um I, I guess I want to start
by saying I, I
um
I hope you'll reach out to
Senator Pinto and to
and to the,
um, office of Tribal
Affairs and to make
sure that you do,
um, you know, to get
the help in conducting the necessary
outreach and it's really
important because as, you know, we have
such a bad history
in this state with how
native Americans, um, all
over the state have been treated,
but particularly on, on
the Navajo, on the
nation. So
I, I do hope that you will.
Um, and then I also
hope just listening
to uh to senators,
uh Representative
Salana, um
that
um
that enforcement, I
mean, I,
I'm very glad at the
moment that if this is going
to go forward that it's the
state that's going to be doing it
because I, I have a lot more confidence
than you than I do
in the EPA. Right
now. I used
to see the EPA as one of those
shining star
agencies that would
be giving guardrails
to the States when
they wanted to. And now
I, I have the opposite
feeling. Um
And so that's another thing
this bill to me is
one of those examples of, you know, no
good deed goes unpunished
in my case. Um
because in the
committee, I
voted against it, but I said, you know, you
really should put this issue
of who owns the
space and
clarify in the bill because
there was like an old,
I can't remember 1910
case law about who owned the
space and, and it,
it, there was no, no
security about that. And
I could just see like
has happened in the history
of our ca of our state.
People getting hurt
by that. People being
lied to about who owns the
space, people being
undersold with that
space. Um And
so I, I'm glad that that was
there. I thought providing certainty
was there, but I have concerns
about the bill and the Filibuster
really showed, I think I ended up voting
against it in the end.
Um
Although like I say, I'm
glad
um
since this is going forward, I'm
glad that you were in charge
and not the federal
government saying
all that, how is
that working? You know, because
it <Cooper>
federalism.
Um
like right now, when you have,
in my opinion, an EPA
that is not
pursuing
the objectives of the
EPA, how
does that work when
you're, we're seeking pri
primacy
and,
and like one comment you
made? Well, they don't really care about that
and I was like, aren't they
supposed to? Um So
I don't know how is that going?
And does anyway
make me feel better about
it? Is what I'm trying to
say,  Mr.
Chair and Senator that there,
there are sort of two versions of EPA
that we interface with specifically
to, well, generally and
specific to this, to this
process. One is our
regional office which is based
in Dallas, which is region six
and then there's the DC office.
So ultimately,
the final say on this and whether it's
sufficient and whether
the state
law environment
around the rule is
sufficient and all of those different
things, the final say on that will
happen from DC.
But that's a little further down
the line right now. We are
still doing most of our back
and forth, most of our work with
the region
six.
And it has been a good
conversation. I would say that
a lot of
um
the headlines
that you see around cuts and,
and sort of degradation of
quality of service and things that EPA
has not necessarily
been our experience dealing with Region
six. In particular
director, regional Director Mason's
team has been pretty responsive
to us. They've been available to help
answer questions and help
us um and
help us formulate this idea.
So for now, we're
mostly with the Dallas folks.
We may be going to DC
a little bit later, but for the most
part, it's has
we haven't quite got there
yet.
Well,
it seems to me that we're on
this road and it does have
potential. And I think
what you've heard from this committee
are really important,
uh concerns and
warnings and the
the most important thing is to
protect the citizens of
our state. And
you can see that we don't
have a lot of confidence
given the history in this
state. Um And
so anything you can
do to
not just the appearance
of doing a better job,
but the reality of
doing a better job. So
like doing a
good job with the outreach,
making sure that you know,
that that's done well,
will in will help with
confidence um
enforcement, making sure
that every budget has a
really rigorous
and,
and IOR and, and
uh and I know funding is
also up to
us, but I know that
this, that there are
fees that are being connected
along with this and
just make sure that the
enforcement budget and
the people that you have in this
office are,
are as strong as you can possibly
get them so that we
can reverse the, the
trend in this state is every
time we get into
something like this, there are
certain people who suffer
more than others.
Um And,
and that just, that just kills
me and it, you know, it really
is a concern
and I, I guess I, that's
all I want to say. Um
I think that our
esteemed chair who filibustered
this bill and
did a really good job about
it and although people
were td
um I think has
a lot will probably express
a lot of the substantive concerns.
Um I more wanted to
express the,
you know, and give,
give suggestions
um for doing
his good job with this
because perhaps there is potential.
Perhaps we do. I, I
also disagree with the statistic of
1% of the carbon where
I don't know where,
um you
know, we
less than the U
si. Don't know. I started to google it and
then I got called on that just
seemed, um,
outrageous to me since we have
so many cars. And so,
you know, it's just, I don't know,
um,
seemed,
well, I don't know, there's a discussion
about it but I, I didn't google
it but I
strongly disagree
with what I've heard about what
we, um, produce in
carbon. I mean,
just looking at the cards
alone, it would, that would
be unbelievable. But I'll go
ahead and
um and,
and there  Mr.  Chair,
thank you very much and um
just know we'll, we'll keep
watching and watching very
carefully. Representative
Black. Thank
you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank you, Deputy
secretary and, and
everyone here today.
So I guess  Mr.
Chair,
I, I was called
out for a call during
this vote, so I
wasn't even able to filibuster
it on the house side even though we don't have
that we only have three hours per bill,
which is kind of stupid. But you
know,  Mr.  Chair,
I, I guess my question
is I heard a little earlier,
somebody was saying something about
this, creating the,
the state into a dumping
ground or something. I
know states like
Massachusetts,
California
and I believe
Washington State also have
this. So are
they, would you, would
you classify this as
safe as
in, are the
regulations that we're putting
forward safe
or at least parallel
to states like Washington
California and
Massachusetts,
uh  Mr.
Chair and Representative Block. I'm
not sure about the primacy status
of those states.
Although I'm not going to say that they don't have
projects they're just probably
authorized by EPA directly
instead of those states.
Can it be done safely? Yes,
it has been there. Are, it
has been done mostly safely
in New Mexico for
some time now.
Ok. Thank you. And then I guess
Mr.  Chair,  Mr.  Deputy
Secretary, I'm wondering
about,
I know the bill says 10
cents per
metric ton.
Does the federal government
have that same
metric that they
collect? Do they
collect anything at
all?
Mr.  Chair and Representative Lock,
you may, I'm not, I don't think, I don't
believe they do.
I think that we may be unique in
that regard and that has more to do
with just our concerns around long-term
solvency, resolving
late arriving
property claims or
potential remediation
needs as they
arise.
Ok. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. And
then regarding that
fund, I
tried to read the bill. I didn't
see where we are going to
put that fund.
Will it be under the State Investment
Council to manage it
or will it be the state
treasurer who will have
that
authority?
Um
Mr.  Chair representative, I can find
that in the bill for you if you give me a
moment. I don't
know that we give it. I think it's just
created like it just about any other
fund um, in
the state, I think the idea
is that
it will over time, even
without a very aggressive
investment strategy, given
the timelines of these projects. So
like these projects
tend to be open
and taking
new sources
of CO2 for injection
for like average lifespans
like 10 to 20 years.
So there was some concern during the
legislative debate about
when and how liability
would transfer to the state
because people thought these
guys are gonna inject furiously for a
year and a half and then the state
gets it for the next 50 years.
But realistically, they're actually injecting
for a long time. So that fee
that's coming to the state
is coming and basically
getting kind of rolling
on an ongoing basis.
So the estimates
that we generated based on
how long the projects
would operate before the state had to
spend a penny out
of the fund
are that this,
the challenge candidly for
the department is going to
be
not getting the fund swept
in the time of, of
budget desperation
really. Um So we
think that the estimates are
that the availability of funds in the
fund and the existing fee
would pretty significantly
outstrip the demands on it
through for monitoring or, or
for reclamation
work.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair and I did read the
fir on it, it said, I
believe in 35 years
should have like a quarter
billion dollars, but
that was just based upon fees,
not upon the interest rate.
So, you know, compounding the
beauty beauty of compounding.
So I'm sure that's going to grow
significantly. And
so  Mr.  chair,
Deputy Secretary, do you
have any idea
on potential
demand following
the the rulemaking
process which is going to be,
I believe the end of the year
when it's going to be completed.
So what do we expect
for the first round
of,
of collections? I
suppose. So,
Mr.  Chair representative that
the end of the year
is for our portion of it.
We kind of
kick this whole thing
once we finish our rule making
process over to
EPA and
then EPA begins their
review. So
us actually having the ability
to start taking permit
applications and spending permits
at this. We're probably
depends on how optimistic you feel
about the EP A's timeline, but we're
probably a little over a year,
we can control our internal
process. But in
terms of measuring the demand,
I, I think if
you, I, I
don't think that I would
say that there's a huge pent up
demand for this. I think again,
people can go out and get permits for
this today from,
from the EPA.
Um I don't
know,
I think it might be a little too rosy to
think that the state having an
option
to issue these kinds
of permits is going to be the
key that unlocks that door
of projects
coming at us. Thank you,
Mr.  Chair. And I would assume
right, if the Federal
government isn't requiring
a 10 cent per 1000
fee or
metric tone rather fee.
I would, I would suspect that they
would probably
not be inclined to be running
toward us
saying let's let's pay
money to the state of New Mexico to do
this. So, I think that's very
interesting. And so, yeah,
I, I appreciate your presentation.
Uh, it's an interesting bill. I have no
idea how I would have voted on it if I was
in the room. Maybe. No, I
usually vote no on things that I
don't really have an idea
about, but I have a better idea today.
So, thank you so much, both of you.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Appreciate
it.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. I just have a
quick question
is the intent
here to turn back,
you know, on
coal fired power
plants or to just keep
them
moving
Mr.  Chair and representative, that's a
little outside of the
scope. Again, our concern is
if you put it under the ground,
how do you do it? It does
it stay there? So the
sourcing of this, whether it's coming
from a point source or whether
you're doing it from direct air
capture or whether you're reinjecting
CO2 that has
been
a
Mr.  Chair and  Mr.
Secretary Cabinet,
Deputy
Secretary.
Does it make it
easier
because we are
allowing more uh
carbon
sequestration
for the coal
plants?
Mr.  Chair? I guess
it depends on how you define
easier. I think to get a permit
now from the federal government, you have
to require with the minimum
CFRS.
I think to get a permit from the State
of New Mexico, you have to comply
with our enhanced requirements
around notice,
around environmental
protection, around water
monitoring, well,
scrutiny as
well as pay a fee.
So I
think there's an argument to say
that maybe it's more difficult
under this regime.
Um
And also
if the
federal EPA
relaxes some of
their conditions,
does that mean New Mexico has
to also or can we keep
ours,
Mr.  Chair and
Representative Ferrari? No, it does not
mean we need to relax it under
previous administrations. When
we initiated this rulemaking
process, we are actually strongly
encouraged just about every
step by EPA to
be more stringent than their
minimum rules. Um
We did and we
intend to keep
those in place no matter what
EPA does.
Um And  Mr.
Chair and
um
Mr.  Deputy Secretary,
um are
there any act
functioning carbon
capture on
uh coal-fired power
plants?
Mr.  Chair, is that a question in New
Mexico, do you mean? Yes
or anywhere? I
guess
we have
any.
So
Mr.  chair and, and
Representative vice chair,
not that I'm aware of.
No,
I uh misinterpreted
um
that not directly
on coal, coal,
but coal-fired
such as, you know,
for oil and
gas and carbon
capture and electric
sector
capacity,
madam vice chair. So
for, for a sort of
combined cycle gas
plant thinking some I I'm
not aware of any, I would say
that the efficacy of those
is
as far as I can tell. And again, I'm
just talking out of class
a little bit because it's not really in
any of our proposal
here. Um
I haven't heard of anything beyond
above about 50%
capture on a, on a gas
plant in the United
States. OK?
In New Mexico.
No, I'm I'm aware of.
OK? All
right. Thank you,  Mr.
Chair.
You're welcome. I think
we got everybody.
So
um
see, uh
Mister Shelton, you mentioned that the
bill does two things, but
you, you
neglected to mention the biggest
thing that 458
does, which that
it shifts
liability of ownership
of these facilities to
New Mexico,
which was the
big issue of this
bill. And
that's what the Filibuster
was about and the,
the kind of startling
ramifications of
that.
So,
but I want to start off, you
talked about your presentation
was about class
six primacy
and kind of made
it about that. But
um
you, you also
mentioned that the bill didn't, we
didn't need the bill to do
that. And the
bill, I just read the bill again, doesn't
even trigger that.
The bill just says that we're going to create
a fund to be used for
that. So,
real quick, just so we're
clear
to a different kind of education
here. Class six. What
was the actual mechanism
that got state, that
regulatory
authority?
It didn't happen in 458.
So what was the mechanism
by which the state did
that?
The,
you technically, you could make
an argument that the mechanism
for the state actually
applying for primacy is still in front
of us that we have
noticed the EPA. But the, the
mechanism is a,
a process of applying to
EPA for state enforcement
of that. We, we're doing, we had the
exact same conversation with
water point source permitting
for water, right? In the environment
department last session. So that's,
that's basically the authority that
we, that we do that we
borrow the actual
mechanism for claiming that authority
is when, um
I guess you could say that the
strongest thing the state will do is when
we final finalize
this rule and pass
that rule package to EPA that
will basically be the starting gun for
their time or
so. So
we don't
need to, we are
already given that prerogative
as a state to have that
authority. If we assert it is
that the way it works,
we don't have to apply for it. We
just have to assert it,
Mr.  Chair, we do need to apply.
Yes. OK. So
are you telling me that we are
applying for it? Then you're
saying rule kind of is
the application, is there an official
application is
part of the rule? Is
it  Mr.
Chair? The
yes. And the reason
that there's a confusing answer, this is
there are multiple phases
of notification of EPA
there's sort of a, hey, we're thinking about
it. Hey, here's about what
we have in mind and then, hey,
here's our full application package.
So it's um
it's a, I'm
trying to think of maybe it's
a little bit like mortgage,
right? You get, you can get
consult and then you got
consult again, you gotta sign some
papers and you got to sign a lot of papers.
It's a, it's a little bit of a similar
escalated process and does the
class six primacy,
um
you know, assumption
of management oversight by
a state require a state
to then take ownership of those
facilities. Is
that part of the
requirement,
Mr.  Chair? I don't know
that, that I don't believe that's
in the CFR that
is something that we pulled
as a best practice from
states that have assumed privacy
around the country because
of the
risk involved with
leaving liability with
private owners or private
operators who may
not have an interest in continuing to
exist post
closure. So
when you say a best practice.
So Tant to be clear,
everything we've been talking about the
last hour was
not, we didn't
need a bill for the reason we
scheduled this hearing today just to
be clear and maybe it wasn't clear to
you all was I wanted to talk
about 458. I
wanted to talk about
this new era and if we're
not prepared to talk about, then we'll
schedule it at the next hearing.
But 458
passed in the final hours of
the session,
final hours
um
did something new. I mean, you say
best practice, I understand we're the
first state in the country to do it.
Tell me if that data
was wrong to have the
state of New Mexico take ownership
of carbon capture
facilities.
Um
that uh you know, that,
that creates a, a huge
kind of unknown
financial
liability to the state of
New Mexico.
So I wanted to learn
about, I wanted this committee to
learn about this future, this business
that we're getting into of owning carbon
capture facilities.
It's great to learn more about
um class C
um oversight.
And I think it's really valuable for the
committee, but, but
it's that assumption of ownership
and liability
and stewardship
responsibilities and all
repairs, all clean
up forever
of a facility. That's a forever
facility.
What are we getting into? And of
course, having
fought many of these other battles
of forever contamination,
that of course, is a
huge trigger for
me taking on
something that's a long term
contamination liability
to the state, which we did
here.
Um
So,
so what other
states have required
this? He said it's a best practice.
What other states have
take, have had their states take
ownership of these
facilities.
Mr.  Chair. That might be that question
for the next hearing. I don't
have that. So I'm going to have a
series of
questions.
How many of
the law, this new law
says that after five
years, the state shall take
ownership of these facilities
as long as they
don't violate
a number of
provisions.
How many facilities
fall into that category? Do
you know how many fall into
today, like
have already been closed for five
years and we're supposed to take ownership
of them this year, next
year, next year,
do you know?
Uh Yeah,  Mr.  Chair, I think until
the rule is final and we
actually
um have
like permitted facilities because I
believe this is going to apply to
facilities that are permitted by the
state than
you have
anything.
Sorry, I'm asking
this law requires
us to take ownership to take
stewardship responsibilities
and ownership and all liabilities
and all obligations of
these facilities.
Massive shifting of
liability
from a oil company
or carbon capture
facility to the state
of New Mexico to the taxpayer
of New Mexico. It
says after five years of them being
closed, we have to, you should really
read 458. You're looking at
me like this is all
in the law that we just passed
458. I just
read it again. Uh
So, and I
looked at it again. Does it have an
implementation date?
I didn't really see one maybe
that. So if you
look at section six B,
the words upon the issuance of
a certificate of completion of injection
operation. So that's not a thing that can
happen
until we have a
rule. We don't have a
process for the issuance of a
certificate of completion of
rejection
that's, that's our trigger, right?
And that's why I'm asking the question,
how many meet that,
how many meet that criteria? Now, are
there any that we've issued a
certificate of
completion,
Mr.   Mr.  Chair
and, and the committee and correct me
if I'm wrong, but since we haven't gotten
delegated authority
and we haven't even applied for
delegated authority from the Feds
yet. No,
none. And because this is all
EPA, right? This is still still
with EPA at the moment,
right? Misrepresenting
that. No, no.
Does the bill
require
that? We can
only assume that liability
for a class
six
regulated
site
that it's just for carbon
sequestration sites.
Mister Chair. Yes. Yes,
it has to be classics.
Yes. OK.
So
I would like to know the answers
to those questions. Like how
many, let's say that they gave
us authority later this
year?
You know how many
are in the pipeline? How many,
for example, how many of these sites
exist in New Mexico? Carbon
sequestration sites exist in
New Mexico?
So, Mister Chair that
is
on
looks like we have one submitted
application right now for
a plastic site
in New Mexico. That'll be through the federal
process.
How many other carbon
sequestration sites do we
have in the
state?
I don't have that number off the top of my head.
How many have been total
permitted by the Feds in the last
20 to 30 years?
I don't know the
other wrinkle in. This
is that class
two, which is called acid
gas injection. That is mostly
carbons, carbon
dioxide going down the down the
pipe. So sometimes the count
for this stuff has been kind
of
count counted together
basically. Could
they become class six
sites? Class two sites?
Yes, it's pretty common
for class
two injection
wells to be converted to class six.
The well bore is basically
designed to the standard for
class six effectively
when they drill class two. So what I would
love to know is I would love to know
how many sites are in the state.
How many will potentially fall
under this law? What is
the financial potential
exposure
liability?
Um That New Mexico
taxpayers are going to assume
potentially at some point assuming
that they all became
class six.
Um Have
we done any financial
analysis of
what that any one
of them will cost us over their
lifespan? Has there been
any financial
modelling
uh of
maintaining, owning, cleaning
it up,
stewardship  Mr.  Chair
until we actually have a final
rule where we know exactly
what the OCC
has decided.
The specifics of that are
there's really no way for us to model
that effectively. I
would say that the
fee and the fund that is
contemplated in the bill that was
passed
is
projections of that pretty
far outstrip
what any liability
to the state may be in
terms of ongoing long term
modelling or
um remediation or
even emergency
response.
Thank you with with all due
respect if we haven't modelled it
and how can we say that the projection
outstrips anything?
And you know what? Even if something,
even if we bring in enough money
in year five and year 10,
what we know is that in year 20
year 50
things get worse over
time, environmentally things
corrode, we know that with carbon
capture facility there's
leaking, there's other things but
there's corrosion
and um, what is the long
term cost? And how do we
know?
How do we know? I mean, when you do the
math on the totality of
sites and you look at one
scenario, how do we know we're gonna have
enough money? One
thing we do know is the LCS
or whoever created these
enterprises are going to be
gone
and this law was designed
to have them be gone
and shift the buck to
us. Where
did this bill come from?
Mr.
Shelton? You know, I mean, I
mean, this, who,
what's the genesis of this
bill?  Mr.
Chair, we drafted
457 and 458.
This was the ongoing
to the approach of taking two
bills I think was a continuation
of a legislative
initiative from 24
2024. I believe
that was cof with energy,
minerals and natural resources. And New
Mexican
recently, I read an article
that the oil and gas industry has been
working very hard to pass a similar
bill in Ohio and
that this has been kind of an
ambition of the industry.
Um Were
they encouraging the
department to create this
legislation?
Uh  Mr.
Chair, no,
our primary partners on this have been
New Mexico
Tech.
Ok.
Interesting
because I mean, it shifts
liability to the
state from
basically an industry,
shifting it on to the new Mexico
taxpayers. So it's a
huge, huge win
for them.
Um
So, well, at any
rate, I would love answers
to all these questions about how
many I think
you need to do some cost
modelling. I don't know how you could come
up with a fee structure
and just throw a dart at the wall. If
you haven't modelled how much it's gonna
cost you. That to me
makes no sense.
Considering the fact that
that entity is paying the fee will
be gone. They're
going to get the heck out of town once
they close this down and
close the door on their liability
because legally we've taken on
all that liability. That's
just common sense
should be. So we
need to know what the appropriate fee
is.
Um
Honestly, yeah, we need to
really look at the whole scheme. I
know, I know when the bill
started,
there was maybe
no
five year period of closure
for us owning and then there was
pushback and so then five
years was like agreed to
as a compromise. But I
mean,
how much time,
you know, it's just the numbers need to
work out, need to pencil
out over the long
term. And
then I guess
a final question is,
are you requesting more
money in the budget
for this
issue? The coming
year?
We,
our, our budget request is obviously
always a function of a lot of
factors. We
began last year, tapering
up our requests
for full time staff and our
U IC bureau
which is uh existing. So again,
we're not necessarily creating a
new, we don't need to
create a whole new bureau for this.
We have primacy over
a number of U IC titles
already and this would just be
sort of another one. So we
had an intention to sort
of begin
scaling that
up
in time to have basically
the bureau ready to accommodate
whatever permanent demands
are put
on. Well, that's,
that's good to hear. So you're not requesting
any new funds, any
new,
any more budget
to do this before any fees have been
collected.
We submitted our budget a few hours
ago.  Mr.  Chairman
should be, it's not already,
it's it's gonna be public record, but
our budget is in line with the administration's
priorities for budget. So I would
love to know that as well. You know,
we were talking about fees
paying for this. Are we
requesting any more funding
to pay for this
um in the short term?
So that's all I have for now, as you
can tell, I'm pretty concerned
about it.
Um
Given the contamination
battles that we're fighting on
uranium and
some of the other unfunded
mandates really that were put
on us, you know, uh
orphaned oil and
well sites. The notion
that we would willingly
take on liability
and responsibility for
basically oil and gas industry
sites to
me is for
something that's forever. I mean, how
long do these
carbon capture facilities have
to be managed once they're
shut
down
Mr.  Chair? It's a very
long time. Um
The idea is that once you're
sequestering this carbon, it stays
down there forever.
We have some chemistry
that works in our favour and that
I I know you're concerned about long
term liability over the very
long term carbon that you
sequester underground will turn
into a mineral.
Um So the
chances of it
doing a lot of lateral
movement or causing,
you know, what we call cross communication
where it's piercing vertical
strata is pretty low, both
because of the pressurization issues
that Senator Thornton brought up. And also
just the fact that it will eventually
turn into get.
Thank you so forever. It's
expensive.
Forever is a long time and
forever is expensive
and, and
the piping itself,
the infrastructure, I mean, those things
corrode even if the carbon
turns into something else
and becomes more stable
or whatever,
you know, the infrastructure
definitely needs
to be maintained and upgraded
and whatever over time.
So
it's kind of shocking here that we didn't
model that, you know, before
we said sure we'll take that
on, you know what I
mean?
So yeah,
I am, I am really concerned
about it and, and I think this
committee needs to
get our arms around. What
is the liability we're taking
on and help provide oversight
to this issue.
So I would love the answers to
those questions if we
need to have another hearing on it,
um to talk about it
more, it probably wouldn't be a bad
idea block. Did you
want to  Mr.  Chair? I was
just wondering because I know there's an
fir I didn't
read how many
years, but I'm sure there's
some kind of modelling that
the agencies did on what
the cost would be
because there is a fiscal impact
report that does have a lot
of numbers and
statistics.
So I just would hope
that would be helpful in the
future. And maybe even
go back to the 2024
bill and see what
that said because usually
it's higher in the, in the future.
So I would
assume that that would
be a
better course of
action to take when it
comes to numbers.
Right? I'm asking the people
that probably wrote the fir
representative block their
bill so
I can
pull it up on, on the
floor as well. But I
appreciate you coming. You know, I
just want to make sure that we know how much it
costs, right? Thank
you. Thank you.
Ok. Anybody else?
Ok, I appreciate
it and thank you both for being
here and we might see you
again. I appreciate it.
Thanks. Thank you  Mr.  Chair. Thank
you.
All
right,
our co headliner. Yes, but
real quick, let's uh pull
out the minutes in
your
folder here.
Take a minute to look them
over
just a
minute.
That's
458
and I'll second it,  Mr.
Ch.
Did you get that?
Ok. We had a tie
for second place. I'll let you
decide
who,
who won the photo finish.
You can pass it to the
other member, you
know?
All right, we'll have a, we'll have a
bipartisan deal. So
represent Ferrari
bicameral
minute approval. Everyone
take a second. That needs
it what we call the final
vote,
right? Anybody opposed to that
motion?
All right, and it's
approved
on the last
item?
Ok.
Ok. So
um  Mr.
Hre you're
at
could be
worse.
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
The four is yours when you're ready to
go?
Yeah. Go for
it.
Chair Steinborn. Thank
you for the opportunity
to speak
today.
Uh My name is Dusty
Horowitz. I'm a
senior research
and policy consultant
with Frack Tracker Alliance,
a nonprofit
organization uh
that performs
research on oil and
gas production and
its impacts.
Um I
have a lot of
experience working
on oil and gas issues
for several environmental
nonprofit organizations,
including most
recently
physicians for Social
Responsibility, where I authored a
series of reports
on the use of
a class of chemicals known
as PFAS in
oil and gas production.
Um One
of those reports
helped prompt the
legislation that I'm gonna focus
on today, uh which
is Colorado's
law passed in
2022 known as
HB 22
1348
which um
which I'll talk more
about and, and I'll speak
about the implications of
that law for New
Mexico. And I've
also written a
textbook chapter
in a book published by Elvir
on the
um regulation of oil
and gas chemicals in
hydraulic fracturing in
multiple states including New
Mexico.
Um
the issue
of the use of PFAS
and
other toxic
chemicals. Well, the issue, the issue
of PFAS um
in oil and gas
operations uh
first
became known
to me as a result
of a Freedom of Information
Act request
that um we sent
to the U SEPA
when I worked for an organization called
Earthworks in
2014,
we asked the
EPA for
their uh reviews
under their new chemicals
program of
chemicals that have been proposed
for use in oil and gas
production, whether
drilling fracking or
other types of oil and gas
production. Epa
um gave us in
response to this
request,
thousands of pages of records
over about a three year period
from 2014 to
2017.
And it
took a while, as you can
imagine to look
through these documents which were full
of scientific
and um
bureaucratic jargon.
Um And
one day when I was looking at
some of these records,
um I, I saw
um some very
interesting information and these
records were
for a chemical called
fluorinated alky
amino acrylic co polymer.
That's the first slide
you have in your
packet. Um You
can see
that a lot
of information for
this chemical. There were actually
three chemicals all called
by the same
generic chemical
name. A lot of the information
was redacted from the
public as is
allowed under
the federal law that
governs the use of
chemicals, the
toxic substances
Control Act, otherwise known
as Tosca. So you can
see on this first slide
here, even the
name of the chemical
company submitting these
chemicals for review
was redacted as
confidential.
If you go to the next
slide, you'll see
that the specific
numeric identifier
for these chemicals,
otherwise known as a
chemical
abstracts service
registry number or a cast
number was also
withheld as confidential.
And that's very important
because cast numbers
are the leading
way to identify
chemicals. There is only
one cast number
assigned to each chemical
by the American Chemical
Society. Whereas
chemicals can have multiple
trade names, multiple
um scientific
names, but they can only have
one cast number. And that's very
important because it enables
scientists and the general
public and regulators
to look up information
like toxo toxicological
information about
chemicals very
easily. But that was,
that was withheld as, as
secret
epa had
multiple concerns
about the health
effects of this chemical. You can see
on the next slide. Um
if you can just sort of
peruse
the EPA
jargon here,
um It says based
on test data for the analog
which is redacted with a
big black mark
concerns are liver
toxicity, blood
toxicity and male
reproductive toxicity.
And then if you go down a few
more lines,
um it
says there is also concern
for immunosuppression
and oncogenic
which is cancer
based on data for and
then there's another line
or word that's redacted.
Um So EPA had serious
health concerns about these chemicals.
Then if you go to the next
slide,
Epa
said that
uh EPA is concerned that
these per fluorinated
degradation products may be
released to the environment
from incomplete
incineration of
the PM N. That means pre
manufacturing notice it's a
notice that chemical
manufacturers have to share with
EPA um for
the pre manufacturing of the
substances at low
temperatures.
Um EPA has
preliminary
evidence
including data on other
redacted that suggest
that under some conditions,
the PM N subs substances
could degrade in the environment.
EPA has concerns that
these degradation products will
persist in the environment. Could
bio acumulate or
Bagnio and could be
toxic to people
wild a wild mammals
and birds based on data
on analog chemicals
including PFO
A and redacted.
Now that jumped out at me
when I read that because PFO
A is the most
infamous type
of PFAS or
Forever chemicals.
And PFAS as a
class are known
for not breaking
down in the environment, which is why
they are called Forever
Chemicals. Uh They're toxic
at microscopic concentrations.
They spread easily in
water and they're
linked to multiple negative
health effects including
cancer. Um PO
A is one of the most
studied of the PFAS
and it has been
linked to cancer among
other health
concerns. Um
So this was a, a
big red flag
that there could be
chemicals in the oil and
gas industry that
either are PFAS
or could break down
into PFAS.
We, we couldn't be sure
exactly what these chemicals
were being used for because
that specific use
like much of the other
data in these EPA records
was redacted as
confidential, but it was
used for some purpose
in oil and gas
production
despite EP A's
serious health concerns
and the concern that this
chemical could break down into
a PFO A like substance
EPA approved
these chemicals for
commercial use in
2011. Now, I want to
emphasize this,
this chemical was U was
analyzed by EPA
for health and environmental
impacts during the
Obama administration in
2010, 2011.
And yet they still,
um, you know, they still
approved it even though the
Obama administration had a
reputation, at least for
being, um,
you know, more, more sensitive
um to environmental concerns
and health concerns than the current
administration, which is,
you know, cutting a lot of the
staff of the EPA. Um
So the, the concerns
um that we could see
something like this now
are even greater.
Um, ep A's
regulation of
this, of these chemicals
called fluorinated
acrylic alkaline
co polymer was
lax. There was no
requirement for follow up
testing to see if the
chemicals were breaking down in the
environment as the regulators
thought they might, there was no
requirement for tracking
to determine where the chemicals were being
used. No requirement
that the use of these chemicals be
prohibited within a certain
distance of homes or schoolss
or water supplies
and looking
through these thousands of
pages of records that we
received from EPA
this type of lax
regulation was typical
of oil and gas chemicals.
And so what that means is
that you as
state legislators
and state
regulators
may be the only line of
defence between
these chemicals and the
public. So what
you do to regulate
oil and gas chemicals is
very, very
important.
So we, we took
this information
about the
use of PFAS,
um, or the potential
use of chemicals that are
PFAS or could break down into PFAS
in the oil and gas industry.
And we put this
into a report that we
published, uh, under
physicians for Social responsibility
in 2021.
Um, we looked at a
database
of fracking chemical disclosure,
which I'll talk more about later called
Frack Focus. It's a repository
of fracking chemical
disclosure from oil and gas
wells in New Mexico
and across the country. We,
we tried to find
evidence that these
chemicals
approved for use by EPA
were being used, but we
could not, that
does not mean they're not being
used because there's a lot of
confidentiality
in the
EP A's regulation of
chemicals. And also
in the, um,
in the disclosure of
chemicals in the oil and gas
industry at the state level,
we also found evidence
that PFAS or chemicals that might
be pfas were
being used in
oil and gas wells
in the United States, including in
New Mexico. We found about
1200 wells
where according
to um, scientists,
we consulted with
likely PFAS
chemicals were being used.
Um, this was covered as you'll
see in the next slide by the New York
Times and multiple
other outlets. This
was probably the first
time that it
became widely known
that PFAS
chemicals were being used
or might be used in
oil and gas operations
in 2021.
I want to emphasize that
our concern about
chemicals used in the oil and
gas production
goes beyond
PFAS in a
2016 report
on oiling
on fracking and drinking
water. The U SEPA
found that there were more than
1600 chemicals
associated with fracking
or fracking wastewater.
That, um,
that, that, um,
and that many of these chemicals,
um, had health effects of
concern and you can see
a list here
and those include
carcinogenicity
or the ability to cause
cancer, neurotoxicity,
immune system effects
changes in body weight changes
in blood chemistry and
others.
Drilling chemicals are
also of concern
and I'll talk a little bit more about
this later. These are chemicals
used in the drilling
process which precedes
fracking. They're separate
and the
drilling process is,
is, is especially
concerning,
um because
during drilling, um
which I'll, I'll point out
um in, in the slide
below which you can see.
Um, the, the well
is when the well is drilled,
there's just an open hole in the ground.
In the first stage, the companies
bore down through the earth and
rock and they
pass in that first stage
directly through the groundwater
before any
steel casing or
cement is inserted into
the well to seal off the
groundwater from the
well. Um
The way this typically works.
And, and I think it's important to understand
this is that
once the open hole is
drilled through the groundwater
formation, the companies
insert the steel casing
into the hole which is a
hollow cylindrical
tube of steel.
Then they pump cement
down the center of that
steel tube. It hits the
bottom of the well, and then
comes back up
around the sides
of the steel casing between
the steel casing and the rock wall.
And you can kind of see that in
this, in this slide, you
can see it better in the colour
version. Um But
the cylinder in the
center of that well is the steel
casing. The material
around it is the
cement
and that's supposed to form an
Impenetrable seal
between the well and the groundwater.
So fluids in the well can't
get out fluids in the
formation, cannot get in.
Um But as you see in this
slide, that
ideal situation does not
always occur or does
not always remain
in place. Wells
can develop leaks in the
cement or in the steel
casing and that can allow
fluid to migrate
outside the well into
groundwater
formations.
Um Just to go quickly back
to the other slide. Um In
addition to the chemi chemicals
used in drilling, um which
can be used for example, to
lubricate the drill bit.
Um We're, we're also
concerned about chemicals used
in other types of
production processes like
enhanced oil
recovery, which is
distinct from fracking
and can involve
pumping chemicals into
a formation or
pumping water into a
formation to help
push out or ease
out. Um especially
oil
um other potential
pathways of contam
of exposure to
chemicals used in oil and gas
drilling. In addition to
leaks and cracks in the
casing and cement can
include above ground
spills and leaks of oil
and gas chemicals. You
can see there's a photo here
of a series
of online waste
pits near
Hobbs where
um oil
and gas waste is being
dumped
in
the early two thousands.
The state of New Mexico
found hundreds of cases
of groundwater contamination
linked to the use of
these online pits and
enacted the pit rule as you may
know to try to
prevent some of those practices.
And there, there can also be
airborne emissions of oil
and gas chemicals especially
during flaring if there
is incomplete
combustion
of what's coming out
of the. Well, those chemicals
could migrate through the air
and be deposited on
surface water or soil
and become
a hazard to
people or wildlife.
Um studies over
the past decade um
show elevated health
risks associated with
living near oil and gas
wells. I won't go through the whole
list. Um But those
include uh for pregnant
women. Um high blood
pressure um
um Eclampsia which
is another pregnancy
related condition
um related to high blood
pressure that can induce
seizures or coma.
Um Preterm birth
is another health risk, low
birth weight babies, which is a
leading contributed to
infant death in the United
States and congenital
heart defects in
babies. Most of the
studies that are
out there were not focused on
New Mexico. Um but
the Counselor Chapter
of Navajo Nation
uh released a study
in 2021 of
their members
and they surveyed,
uh they conducted the survey of health
symptoms
of 80 residents of the
Chapter and they found that
more than 60% of those
residents reported
11 symptoms
during the year after drilling
began near their homes,
including a sore
throat, cough and
sinus
problems.
So we, we included
all of this information in our
2021 1 report
highlighting the
use or likely use
of pfas in
oil and gas wells.
And we,
we we were concerned
about the possibility of
exposure. And
we decided at this
point to turn
our focus to individual
states where oil and gas
drilling and production
was significant. And the first
one we focused on was Colorado.
So we looked
at the frack
focus data for Colorado
and Frack focus again is
a repository of
fracking chemical disclosure
data. Uh Well, by
Well, Colorado is a
state that requires disclosure
of fracking chemicals to frack
focus. And we found
that
uh PFAS had been used
in about 300 wells in
Colorado over about a decade
long period. Uh We
also found an
astronomical use of trade
secret chemicals in Colorado.
Colorado like New Mexico
allows oil and gas
companies to
conceal the identities
of the chemicals they inject
during fracking um
with trade secret claims.
And so we found over a decade
long period from 2011 to
2021
in uh in Colorado,
companies claimed at least one
trade secret chemical
in more than 12,000
wells across 31
counties. And
the weight of those
trade secret chemicals
totalled more than 400 million
pounds, staggering amount
of chemicals whose identities
are being withheld from the
public.
So this
report uh generated
significant media coverage
in Colorado and there was
significant cer concern
among environmental
groups.
The Sierra Club took the
lead in pushing
for legislation in
Colorado to address this
situation and that was
enacted in 2022.
Um The legislation
requires a written
declaration that
chemical products used
underground in the oil and gas
wells in Colorado
contain no intentionally
added PFAS. So there's
essentially a ban
on PFAS use
underground in the oil and gas wells
in Colorado. Um
The, the law requires
disclosure on the public we
website of an
alphabetical list of
all individual
chemicals used underground
in each oil and gas well
covered by the law and
that includes chemicals used for
drilling which precedes
fracking, fracking or
any other type of underground
operation.
The oil and gas
companies have to
disclose the individual
chemicals in these
wells. They cannot cover
those with trade secret
claims although they
can, uh they
can use trade secret
claims
to, to
hide the identity, the,
the chemical formulas of their
chemical products which often
contain a mix of chemicals.
It's sort of like the same rules
that apply to food
makers where they have
to disclose the
ingredients but not the
recipe.
Um
The, the
disclosure
rules apply
to all wells in Colorado
with underground operations
occurring um
As of July 31st,
2023 or
underground operations that began
after that date. Uh,
disclosure occurs
about 100 and 50 days,
generally 100 and 50 days
after the commencement
of underground operations.
And
one other critical
element of this law is
that the
disclosure requirements
apply to chemical
manufacturers
who are the companies that
know best what chemicals
are being used in the wells over the
years. I've
seen multiple pieces
of evidence that
the companies that operate
the wells like Chevron or
Exxon, the companies
that perform the fracking
like Calib Burton or
Schlumberger
don't know all of the
chemicals they're using because they
purchased these chemicals from the
chemical manufacturers
and the chemical manufacturers
just don't tell them all of the
chemicals. So if
your disclosure law
does not cover the chemical
manufacturers, that's
a significant gap.
Um And New
Mexico does not and
Colorado's law before
this new law was passed did
not cover the chemical
manufacturers.
Um
And then two other
pieces about this law. Um
It requires the
sharing of the final
list of individual chemicals
that go into each well
with a set
of um,
of residents and
other institutions
that operate near the
well, including
residents living within
a half mile of the well,
schools, um,
first responders and
public water providers. And there are
others. You can
look at the law to see the entire
list. One
key omission from
this law, which we
try to have,
um inserted
into the law was a
requirement that the chemicals be
disclosed prior to
any drilling or fracturing. Uh
We were not able
to um, have that
inserted in the law. And
that is a significant gap
because prior
disclosure gives communities
the opportunity
to object if they
think that a particular chemical
is going to be very dangerous. It
also gives communities
the opportunity to conduct
testing
before any chemicals
are used to
develop what is called a
baseline water
sample to show
what the water quality was
like prior to
any drilling or fracking.
Um, if you don't know what
chemicals are gonna be gonna be used,
it's difficult to conduct
that test for the right set of
chemicals. If you
do have a
baseline water
test and then
drilling and fracking come in
or other types of oil production
come in and then you retest
the water and you see a
significant change. That's
pretty good evidence that
the oil and gas operation caused
the contamination. But without
that baseline, even
if you find serious
contamination after
the oil and gas production
begins,
you can't be sure you
can't be as sure that the
production caused the problem
because there could have been
pre-existing contamination.
Uh So it's very, it is
very important to have that
predis
um
The next slide is just a
little deeper look at how
the law works. It's basically
a three part disclosure
system. The first
set of disclosures are
chemical products being used
in Colorado wells, those
are made by
um, anybody in the
supply chain, whether it's the
service providers, operators,
vendors, chemical manufacturers,
they give the state a list of the
products to the, the chemical
products, which can be mixtures
of multiple chemicals going
into the wells along
with a list of those individual
chemicals in each product.
Then the operators who operate
the individual well,
share the list of products
with the state that go into
that individual well. And
then, then the state brings
those two pieces together.
The state takes the individual
chemicals associated with the
products, matches them
up with the products going into the
individual well, and then
publishes the
alphabetical list of all the
individual chemicals that
went into that. Well,
um, in
May of this year, we decided
to see how well this law was
working. We,
we took a hard look at it and
unfortunately, we
found that the
law was not working
very well. Um
We, what we did to, to
conduct this analysis was
we compared the
disclosures in Frack
focus, which
is the required
repository of
hydraulic fracturing chemicals
in Colorado
with
the,
the disclosures
for under the
new law for the, the
same wells that
we had disclosure records
for in frack focus.
And what we
should have found is
that all of
the chemicals for a particular
well disclosed in Frack
focus in Colorado should
also have been disclosed
in the new
disclosure uh
website for each of
those wells because the new disclosure
covers all chemicals
going underground in the wells
including fracking chemicals.
Whereas the Frack
focus, the older
disclosure regime
required only fracking
chemicals. So we should have seen
all the fracking chemicals plus
additional chemicals
in the New
Colorado data.
But when we looked, what we
found is that a lot of
wells covered by the new law
had no disclosures at
all. Um We
found disclosures
in only 40%
of the wells that were
covered by the new law in Colorado.
So 60% of those
wells had no chemical
disclosures at all.
Um,
of the 31 companies
that operated about
1100 wells
that were covered by the new Colorado
law. 20 of
the company, 20 of the 31
companies including Chevron,
um, had no disclosures
on the Colorado
website. Um
And if those companies
rather than the state were
responsible for that lack
of disclosure, we estimated
that the fines could
have totalled uh $37
million at least.
Um And that's based on Colorado's
rules which assess
fines on a per
violation per
day basis.
Um And the trade secret
chemicals that we knew
had been disclosed to Frack
Focus because you can see in those
entries, it'll say, you know,
trade secret trade secret
that should have been
disclosed under the new
Colorado rules,
um, totalled an
estimated 30 million
pounds or more. And tho
those chemicals should have been disclosed,
but they weren't in these,
in these wells where there was no
chemical disclosure.
So, uh and,
and then finally, we
found no evidence that
drilling chemicals as opposed
to fracking chemicals were
disclosed under the
new Colorado
rules.
Um, you can see, um,
a list I'll just talk about this very
briefly. A list of all
the companies um
that had operated wells
in Colorado that we found
lacked chemical
disclosure and
the estimated fines
that those, the estimated minimum
fines that those companies
would owe under Colorado
law if they and not the
state were responsible
for the lack of disclosure.
Um You
can see uh in the
next slide, a
chart that was
compiled by
Open FF which is an
organization that has
done a lot of the data analysis
for these reports.
Um And it is supported byr
tracker showing sort
of a timeline about
when the Colorado law went
into effect and when
various um
when various events
happened. Uh for
example,
you can see that on December
28th, 2023
the deadline passed for the
online disclosure
system and the first disclosures.
Um however, we had not seen
any disclosures at that
point and
it was not until September
2020
24. Um at the
bottom of this, um, this
slide where the EC
MC, that's the Colorado
Regulator, uh website
goes online that showed
the first disclosure. So they were
about nine months late
in making any disclosures
available to the
public. Um The good
news is
that
after our
report was
released, this may showing
a lack of compliance with
Colorado's law
compliance increased
significantly and you can see
that on this next
slide.
Um,
you know, um uh especially
the June 1st
2025
entry, um showed
that only 33%
of the wells were still not
compliant, that's down from about
60%. And then on
the, on July 1st
2025
the non compliant rate
for fracking chemical disclosures
at least was down to 9%.
And now as of August, we're down to
3% of
the wells covered by the
Colorado law have
no chemicals,
um, associated with their,
um, disclosures on the
website. Um, that, that
is, that is a lot
of progress.
At the same time, we still
have seen no evidence that drilling
chemicals are being
disclosed in
Colorado. We've, we're
only seeing evidence that fracking
chemicals are being disclosed
and that's not consistent with what
the law says. It should
cover disclosure of all
chemicals going into the.
Well, um, so the
next steps that we plan
to take in Colorado are
one. We want to ensure
that all chemicals
uh used underground in
oil and gas wells are publicly
disclosed. Uh We'll
be talking, we've already had
some conversations with the regulator,
the Energy and Carbon Management
Commission and we,
um we, we
feel that those conversations will
be ongoing. Um
We want to examine
compliance with a community
notification
requirement under the law which I
mentioned that the,
um the regul
the operators of the oil and
gas wells are supposed
to be sharing their
chemical disclosure list
with, you know, fire departments
and schools and residents
living near these wells. We want to make
sure that that's happening and
we also want to
uh in the longer term, um
strengthen the
law to
add a testing
requirement. A
group of scientists and
environmental groups
in Colorado
wrote to the
Energy and Carbon Management
Commission in 2023
urging them as part of the
implementation of this law
to test the
flow back from a
random sample of
wells
and identify
the chemicals in that flow back
and then compare that to
the chemicals being
disclosed as used in
the well flow back.
For those who may not
know is the
first volume
of water wastewater
that comes back up out of the
well, after fracking
is complete, and it
is likely to include
chemicals that were in
the fracking process as well
as probably
chemicals injected in the
prior drilling process.
So, if you compare
chemicals
identified in that
flow back with
the chemicals being disclosed
as being injected
into the well, and you find a
match, that's
good evidence that your
disclosure is
accurate.
Yes,
the initial
initial drill before the
semen is added, that's the
initial
no flow
back is. So the the
order of of
production would be
the initial drilling.
Then the
cement and steel casing is
inserted, they usually do
that in successive layers
going deeper and deeper until they reach
the target formation. Then
they frack which
involves injecting the
chemicals and water
and sand and
that fractures the
formation on the ground. And
then when they turn off the
pressure that forced the
fluid into the well, a
portion of the fluid comes
back up and out of the well, and
that's the flow back. It's the
first
volume that comes back up and
out of the well.
Um And so,
so if
that volume
were tested for chemicals
and it matched what
the company said were going
into the well, that would be
good evidence that
the disclosure is
accurate. If there were
discrepancies, then
that would suggest that
there needs to be further
investigation, whether
the disclosure was not adequate
in the first place.
Um Another
explanation could be
that there are chemical
reactions going down on,
going on underground
that are creating new chemicals
which is possible.
Um Or there
may be another explanation, perhaps
some of the water that
the oil and gas companies
are mixing into the fracking
fluid
contains,
um you
already existing chemicals
that the companies are not intentionally
adding. Um But that,
that's a very important step because
right now the Colorado
system, like all the disclosure
systems
relies on the
good faith of the companies
to accurately disclose
their chemicals. And
you know, whether some
companies decide not to act in good
faith or whether
certain information doesn't
get passed on from one company
to another as we've seen with the
manufacturers, not
sharing all of their chemical
information with the others.
Um It's important to have
that verification in
place. Um
So the last thing
I will I'll say and then I'll
open it up for more questions
is what are the implications
for New Mexico?
Um In
2023
physicians for social responsibility,
where I worked published
an on report
about the use of pfas
and trade secret chemicals
in New Mexico. Um I
was
one of the
similar to what we have
found in Colorado. Um
There, there was
a U use of
PFAS or likely PFAS
chemicals in
wells in New Mexico.
And there was a staggering
use of trade secret
chemicals you can see on this
chart, um
which is the second to last
slide. It breaks
down the use
of trade secret chemicals
or trade secret surfactants,
which is a class of
trade secret chemicals that could
be PFAS uh fluoro
surfactants, which could
be PFAS. This
chemical with a cast number
655 45-80
dash four, which
is a
defined PFAS
and then PTFE,
otherwise known as Teflon,
which is also a defined
PFAS. And you can see
how many wells those
chemicals were used in
statewide on
federal land, on state
land and on tribal
land. And then you can see the,
the quantities
in pounds of each of
those chemicals. And you
can see for trade
secret chemicals, the total
mass was
243 million
pounds over about a 10 year
period, which is
staggering.
Um And those
chemicals could be PFAS, they
could be other dangerous chemicals.
We just don't know and
people have a right to know,
especially
in a state where
80% of the residents
rely on groundwater or
roughly 80% rely
on groundwater for drinking water. It's, it's
very important
um There
as, as I know you
are aware because you, you were
involved uh  Mr.  Chair
in this legislation,
there are efforts in New
Mexico to replicate
what Colorado has
done. Um hb
222 was
introduced this year in the
House of Representatives um
to replicate Colorado's
law. Um It
was not enacted and then
there's a separate rulemaking
petition submitted
in 2023 by
Wild Earth Guardians
um to the Oil Conservation
Commission and that
effort is ongoing.
Um So far, the,
the commission has
adopted some of the
requests in the petition.
Um But Wilder
Guardians
and
um a, a Cogan
organization um
feel that, that they have not
gone far enough, especially
in the, in the
rule that they proposed
um to prevent the
use of pfas only
in fracking
or completion or recompilation,
but not in
other aspects of
production like drilling
where it could also be
used. So it is
important in
closing that
New Mexico
follow in Colorado's
footsteps and even try to
build on what Colorado
did, um, especially
with the testing requirement. Um,
so that the public can be
protected and drinking water
supplies can be
safe. Thank
you. All
right. Um
Dusty, thank you so much
and, and for those who don't know,
Mr.  Horwin came in from Washington
DC, right? For this
presentation. And, you
know, I think maybe the first time ever,
we've had somebody fly in for, for
the radioactive Announcers Materials
Committee, other committees do
it. They got a little budget to do that
on special occasions. So it is a
special occasion and,
um, thank
you, um,
for the work that you've
done
and, you
know, Colorado, it's
funny they do a lot of innovative
stuff, but maybe they were the first
state in the country to do this and
maybe the only,
this was the first
in the nation law there, there
are other states that had
elements of this, but
they did not go as far as
Colorado, right?
So, um, thank
you for your contribution
to do that, to protect
human health. And the residents
there. And anyway, so we'll open it
up to questions and I will definitely have
some comments as well. Does anybody have
any represent
block?
Thank you  Mr.  Chair. It's actually
based upon something you just said about
Wild Earth  Mr.
Chair. If you don't mind
muting your microphone.
Thank you. I
want the people at home to hear
us. So uh
Wilder Guardians, do you know
what, what
basis was for
their complaint?
I know you like in my
district in my
backyard, they used
the excuse of this jumping
field mouse that no one's ever
seen before. And so
I'm just trying to figure out, I
know they, they filed lawsuits
about uh lesser
prairie chickens
and wolves
and I'm just wondering what the basis
was for that complaint
specifically. Do you
know? II I
do. And I, I think
there is a representative here from the
group who could speak perhaps
in more detail. But
one of the major
concerns about
the, the,
the,
the concern that the
Oil Conservation Commission did not
go far enough in
prohibiting pfas
is that the state of New
Mexico itself acknowledged
during these hearings
that
fracking um
is only there
while there were thousands
of fracking operations
in the state. There were
also many
more thousands of
underground operations
that were not fracking
drilling or other
types of underground operations.
So their,
their position was that
the prohibition
on PFAS U should
apply to all underground
operations not just
fracking.
Thank you so much. Thank you
so much, sir. And uh
so madam vice
chair, I am wondering
regarding this
large report.
I think the new Mexico specific
one. I'm wondering, do
you have data based upon
every single
producer?
And how did you obtain
that information?
Because I think on page it's
like halfway down the
report looks like page
14. You have like
table five and six
excerpts
of the different uh
wells injected with trade
secret chemicals
versus
surf
surfactants,
surfactants. There we
go. So
can you just tell me how
you got this information?
And is it just because
you don't know specifically what
was given out
or was
this a request that
you sent to each individual
producer? How did you get this
data or the lack
thereof?
Um  Mr.  Chair and I represent
the block. I'm sorry. Could you just tell me
again the the page you're looking
at page
15?
Yeah, this um this data
comes from
uh Frack Focus. Um
Frack focus is the national
repository. I mentioned
of hydraulic
fracturing data
on a well by well
basis.
And
uh users of,
you know, members of the general public
can download
that data and
search by state
by operator um
by chemical. And
so you can see
in that data that is
disclosed by the companies
themselves. How many
times they declared
they used a trade secret chemical
in their wells? Um How
many times they declared they
used a trade secret
chemical that was also a
surfactant. That's
where that uh that
information comes from.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
And so I'm wondering uh so
this group, are they a
governmental entity?
Are they an no?
Where, where are these people
from? Frack?
Focus?
Um Yeah,  Mr.  Chair and I
represent the block. Um
They are run by an
organization called the Groundwater
Protection Council,
which is a nongovernmental
group of state
wa Groundwater
Regulators.
Um It's a, it's a
little bit of a, a hybrid
organization uh
because it is, it
is in fact a
nongovernmental
organization, but
multiple states
including New Mexico and
Colorado and
multiple others
have made Frack focus
the legally required
repository for
fracking chemical disclosure
in their states.
So it's,
it's both
you, you might say it's both
Nongovernmental and in
a sense, governmental.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. And I guess my
next question would be
how many states because
I know Colorado they passed their law
2022 I believe.
And then New Mexico, we haven't passed
a law. So how
many states have joined
this compact, so to speak
to put this information
forward regarding the
actual
chemicals put into
the, the
process.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair and
I represent the block.
Um The
so Frack focus
I want to emphasize is
separate from what Colorado
just did in 2022.
So those just so that's
clear, those are separate
repositories
for Frack
focus.
The organization
on its website
says that
operators in more
than 20 states
submit
uh informa fracking chemical
information to frack
focus. I can't
recall offhand how
many of those states
require
the disclosure to
frack focus and how and
in how many states the disclosure
is voluntary. Um
But there can be both
types of
disclosure voluntary
or required. Um,
Ohio, for
example, has
a bifurcated system
where the,
the well
operators can
either submit
their fracking chemical disclosure
information to
Frack Focus and the state or
only to the state.
Um The rules are
different in,
you know, from state to state,
but a
number of different states
uh Texas is another one
require
fracking chemical disclosure
to Frack focus. And
that and that
um disclosure data is
subject to
state law. So if
the state says companies
are allowed to
withhold chemical identities
as trade secrets,
you'll see that reflected
in the, in the fact focus
data. And it
often, I mean,
almost every
state, almost
every state
uh allows oil and gas
companies to withhold chemical
identities as trade
secrets, which is one of the reasons
Colorado's law is so
groundbreaking because
it's, it's the first one
that prohibits
trade secrets from being
used for all chemicals
used in the well, all
individual chemicals I
just want to mention
uses focus as
well.
But I see we have data
here. So the difference is, is
what required
and Colorado's full disclosure
and we allow this massive loophole
called trade secrets which,
as you can see, they just loop
hundreds of billions of pounds of
material. So we
have very minimal, well,
we, we don't have minimal disclosure, we
don't have full disclosure and that's
where Colorado's taking the next
step. Got
it. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. But it
does seem like it's the outlier,
not the rule.
So it seems
as if it's the only state that's
passed this  Mr.
Chairman,
uh  Mr.
Chairman represent the
block Colorado
is the only
state
that
um, it requires
disclosure of all
individual chemicals going
into oil and gas wells
without the
ability for
companies to withhold
those identities as trade
secrets. Um,
there are some
other states that
have requirements,
for example, that drilling chemicals
be disclosed like Ohio.
Um but Ohio allows
companies to withhold uh
drilling chemicals as trade
secrets as they do for fracking
chemicals. Um, West
Virginia also
requires some,
uh requires
disclosure of all chemicals used
on site,
but also repre
allows companies to withhold
those as trade secrets.
Um So there
are some states that are have
more disclosure, but
almost all of them
allow trade
secrets. Um
and they have other
gaps in disclosure
that would
allow significant
um use of chemicals
without the public's
knowledge.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. That's good to
hear. It's good to know
to see where other other states
are. So when it comes
to the
disclosure, I'm
gonna be wrapping up my questions
here. But when it comes to the
disclosure, I know that we have had
some problems in the past
specifically because of
those trade secrets.
And so how, how
did Colorado finesse
their law to get
around any kind of
regulatory framework
federally that
does protect these
trade
secrets?
Uh The major law as I
mentioned, that regulates
um, chemicals
in the United States is the to the
Federal Toxic Substances
Control Act, which
allows uh
trade secrets to be
claimed for many, many pieces of
chemical information, including the
identities of the chemicals.
However,
the Toxic
Substances Control Act also
allows states
to create their own
disclosure regimes
and you know,
with, with um
provisions like Colorado's
that says all
chemicals must be disclosed to the
public without
trade secret protection for individual
chemicals. So Colorado
can take that action
under federal law.
Um There's also
been some concern
about the adoption of the
Uniform Trade
Secrets Act which
Colorado and New Mexico have,
have adopted.
Um that act or
those acts basically
allow the holder
of a trade secret to bring a
cause of action against
someone who
misappropriates the trade
secret, but
it doesn't uh
prevent the
state from saying
to certain chemical
users, you must
disclose these individual
chemicals to the public.
Um And, and
so if the state requires
that, then
people would have access
to those chemicals and
that access would not be
a
misappropriation.
Ok. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. I'm gonna, I'm gonna
read that Colorado Law seems
very, very interesting and,
and your presentation was very robust.
Thank you for the information.
So, I guess my, my
big concern with this legislation
maybe would be the
small producers
because smaller
producers a
$35
million hit to them
or whatever it is that you just
referenced in the Colorado
fees that are building up,
that would pretty much cripple
that small producer. Whereas
the Chevrons, the Exxons,
the Devon Energies, they would
be able to, to eat
that. And I think that that
would be a huge concern that I'd
be looking into for the
state. So I would just keep
that in mind for policymakers
in the future. But thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.
Thank you so much for flying
all the way here at a beautiful New
Mexico. Get some green chili.
OK.
We'll trade you green chili for
Ethiopian food.
I think it's a very fair
trade. All right. Uh
Senator Cil
Lopez.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank you
so much for that presentation. I really
appreciated it and thank you so
much for your work. Um We
don't have enough in New
Mexico studies
of what you know of.
I honestly
um this,
this PFAS problem
is a huge problem and
we've studied one aspect of
it, but this, this is another
aspect. I are you a
lawyer?
I am OK. Good
because one of the things
that was told to me about
the disclosure, public requiring
public disclosure was
that we couldn't do it because
it was protected under federal
law. I,
I'm a lawyer. I, I
admit I didn't look
into it. I didn't ask to look
into it.
What's the response to
that?
Yeah. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair and
Senator Cillo
Lopez.
The, as I mentioned, the
Federal Toxic
Substances Control Act
is the major act that
governs the use
of and regulation
of chemicals in the United
States.
And it does have
a provision in it that allows
states to create
their own disclosure regimes
that specifically in
the oil and gas industry
because that's what they
across all
chemicals. Excellent.
Would you send that to me?
I would very much appreciate
it because that sort of stopped
me and I shouldn't have let it stop me because
I know, you know,
I didn't, I really didn't know
whether that was the case, but
sometimes people say federal
law and you just
sort of stop. Um,
but I, I, I'm
glad to know that there
is a way for us to require
this disclosure because it really
bothers me and you really pointed
out you really hit it home
about. Um,
we did, we have no idea
and then they tell us, oh, yeah, we're taking
the, these chemicals, they're not
affecting the water.
Um, and,
and it's like, well, we don't even know
what's in there and if you
don't tell us, how do we know
whether you've achieved
it. Um, so I'm, I'm
delighted. Um, I
had one legislator tell me, you
know, it's nothing you wouldn't have.
And there's a legislator who, who
actually
owns, um,
an oil and gas company. He said, oh,
it's nothing that you don't have under
your sink. And I said,
yeah, well, I wouldn't want to drink anything under
my sink. So, you know,
it's, it's, um, it's an
important issue and I, uh, I
would like to explore that further
because we have, as people
say, federal law state
that would, um,
you know, that this would help to
up for them to understand
what this is and also
help with. I, I really
believe it. Another thing
you said require funding and clean up. I
really believe that polluter
pays. Um, but a lot
of times people don't even know what's
causing their health problems.
And so I think that
this disclosure would be
really helpful for people to
understand why they're
having the health problems
that we have. I've said this
before and you probably
know this, but if
you overlie a map
of New Mexico
with,
um,
where oil and
gas um,
is located in the state
and then you put asthma
cancer, I forgot.
I think there's something else um,
over. Oh
yeah, I forgot. But, but
anyway, if you put that the,
the appearance
of those, um,
those health problems
over it, you can see
the overlap and then if
you overlay where
people of colour are located in the
state. You can just
really see the overlap and it's,
it's, it's very disturbing.
Um, and like I said, a
lot of them have no
idea what's causing their health
problems. No idea why
their kids have asthma. No
idea why cancer
is, is, well,
some people do but not all of
them. No. So,
I, I'm very interested
in, in pursuing this public disclosure
thing and, uh,
yes, the polluters should pay.
Um And so often in New
Mexico, the polluter doesn't
pay, they declare bankruptcy,
leave the state and
then um
come back in another
corporate format. It's, it's
really disgusting. We have a legacy
of that. You probably know that in
this state. So, um
I think this funding and clean up,
although I think that could be done
by the agency. We don't,
uh you know, polluter
is supposed to pay, but we need
to get somebody who makes
them pay. Um So I
think that that recommendation is
really good and I think
increasing testing and, and
tracking, yes, we could require it in
law, but that could also be done by
rule um by
rulemaking. I think the EPA
could, I mean, the EPA, the
environmental department could just
do this, you know, require
the increased testing and
tracking public
disclosure,
halting PFAS use in oil
and gas extraction. I think that
it's a heavier lift in this
state. But I think that that's
really important if there, I,
I didn't know this, that
PFAS are PFAS
are replaceable with less
persistent and less toxic
alternatives. Why aren't
they using, if, if
these companies care so
much as they say
for the people in our state,
why aren't they using less toxic
alternatives? And
so they shouldn't really
oppose a
requirement that they use less
toxic alternatives? Are
they more expensive
or do we
know?
I don't know,
I think that's a question for the
companies and the
researchers who
wrote that paper that
we referenced there,
who made that
conclusion that there are
less toxic
alternatives? Yeah, because
that, that was also interesting
to know because it bothers
me if there are less toxic
alternatives, I would
hope that they're being used in the
state when we
get up. You probably, I
don't know how long you've been here. We're
always getting advertisements
about how much oil and
gas has done for our state.
Um, and uh,
we never get advertisement on
how much, what it's done
to our state
just about how much
money has, has
been paid
um, to the
state. Um,
the hazardous rate waste exempt
exemption. Yes,
we should definitely not exempt
that industry from hazardous waste
rules. That's another important,
um,
important recommendation
that you made.
Um
And yeah, production wells and
underground water disposal wells
closed to underground sources of drinking
water. Um We
do sort of have a system
but it makes me want to talk
to our state state engineer's office.
We have a permitting process
for water.
Um
And really, I don't know, I, I would
hope that that's being done.
But if our regulations need
reform, I think
we should definitely look
into that. And then yeah,
we have the eta your
last recommendation is transition
to renewable energy and better
regulation. You may be aware
we have passed the eta in
this, in this state
and we're um I
think it's very, very the
Energy Transition Act
um which is a
step. It's a modest step,
but it's a step. Um
And yes, I
I believe that it, it is
the policy of the state.
Um
However, you know, this is a
real big oil and gas producing
state. So you have kind of
conflicting,
conflicting policies that makes
it hard to get some of this stuff
done. But I really
appreciate the presentations
extremely informative and
I liked the recommendations.
Um
and especially because like I
said, somebody shut me down once
about, can't we make
this more transparent? And somebody said,
no, it's protected under federal
law. I'm glad to
know that's not the case.
Thank you.
You're welcome. And it did not stop
Colorado from moving
forward with its.
No, I think the
other problem here though is you
do the little
environmental thing. And
I think because we're a small
state and we don't have as
many
lawyers that
man, we get litigation in the state
like you wouldn't believe and
they send in the big guns,
which is another kind of discouraging
thing. Um, but
we do have excellent lawyers
and a lot of the
federal lawyers who work used to work for the
federal government are now starting to work
for the state. So,
you know, I don't think we should be
afraid of litigating
good law.
Um, because some of the law,
some of the litigation
is filed is absolutely frivolous,
but they just
tied it up for a while.
So anyway, I really
appreciate this. I appreciate your
work. Um,
and I hope to remain
in contact.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,
Mr.  Senator and for the
Committee's Awareness and Tim will
correct me if I'm wrong. But
the oil
Conservation division by
rule Environmental Improvement Board
just, just
outlawed PFA
in fracking.
Yes. Is a
little caveat on that?
Is there a caveat? I didn't, I wasn't
aware,
ban it. You come
to
the
I was
in
Mr.  Chair, Tim Davis
with Wild Earth Guardians. Good
to see you committee
members. Um
I represented Wilder
Guardians in the rulemaking before
the OCC
and the, the Oil Conservation
Commission and they did
vote to prohibit
the use of PFAS
in completions and
recompilation. You can think of that
as fracking.
Um but there
is no prohibition in New
Mexico for
the use of PFAS in other
downhill operations like
enhanced oil recovery,
well maintenance.
And most importantly, perhaps
drilling,
you can still use as much
PFAS as you want to in those
operations in New
Mexico. And
the OCC also
declined to
um prohibit the
use of
undisclosed chemicals.
So trade ticket
protections for
chemicals are still in place in New
Mexico.
So the band was just sorry. So
the band was just on
uh fracking
Mr.  Chair.
Yes,
disclosure  Mr.  Chair.
I just, if I, if I may the
the fracking, are you talking about
the explosion piece of it, what
do you mean when you say
fracking?
I think
fracking is the
underground
process
of opening
up, fractures in the
formation. The
explosions, I think you're
referring to
occur after
the companies
insert the steel
casing and the cement. Often
these are horizontal
legs of the well
after that's in place,
they set off many
explosions along
that lateral
or if it's a vertical
well on the vertical
that perforates
the drilling pipe.
And those are the places where
the fracking fluid exits
the well. So after
they perforate the pipe with the
explosions, then they
inject back up at the
surface, the millions
of gallons of fracking fluid,
which is a mix of water,
sand and chemicals
typically. And that exits
the drilling pipe at those
perforations. And that
piece of it is where it is
now no
longer permitted
that piece of it. When you say
fracking,
I think Tim will
correct me if I'm wrong, but
the use of PFAS is no longer
permitted in that in the
fracking process. The,
the, the the
injection of the fluid,
you can't have pfas
in the fluid that you
inject into the well, that
exits the, the, the
drilling pipe and creates
the fractures? Excellent.
And do you know whether less
expensive alternatives were
available? Did that come out of the
urine?
Mr.  Chair, Senator Sil
Lopez? That issue was not
part of the
record at the hearing.
Happy to share the record
with you if you would like the
thousands of pages
of transcript, so
much spare time. But
if you have the cliff notes, I'd be
interested
as far as I'm aware
and
is the same as what
Mr.  Hort shared that
there is a peer-reviewed
paper that
has found that there are
less expense, less
toxic alternatives.
Great. No, II I
just think that's important for us to
understand  Mr.
Chair. Thank you very much and thank you
again for the presentation.
Ok. Thanks
Tim for Pin shedding stand
by. All right.
Uh Vice Chair
Froy, thank
you,  Mr.  Chair and
thank you for
this great report. Um
When you mentioned um
Schlumberger is one of the
companies. Um
They're based, I believe in
Colorado and
um Colorado School of
Mines is there and all
this, I'm sure
great opposition to what you
were trying to do.
But um
one of the things
that are other
alternatives,
um they've
had especially
slumber owned for
a while, the propellant
fracturing
and that
was, that's an alternative
that's been around for
decades and they
refused to use
that. I think it was
probably
easier and,
um,
more  cost-effective to
just, you know, use the chemicals
and let that, you know, do
the dirty work.
Um Also now we have
plasma pulse
which um could be an
alternative too. So I'm
wondering if we might, if we're
putting more pressure on the
companies to disclose
and you know, that gets harder
and harder for them to use if they
might go back to some of
these other um
ways of um
of other
processes.
But um with
oil and gas companies
so prevalent and you
know, like Slumber J
two in Colorado,
did you have a hard,
a big pushback
on? I mean, I'm sure you
did, but
was it hard to overcome?
Did you have lots of support
to get that
through
there? Um
Mr.  Chair and Vice
Chair Ferrari,
I hope I'm pronouncing your
name correctly. Ok,
thanks. Um
There, there was
um there was
pushback
primarily on the
provision I mentioned to have
pre disclosure
prior to drilling
and fracking. Um That
was from
my perspective and I I was
not in the state at the
time but from what I was hearing
from my colleagues who
were, that was
the most significant
source of
opposition.
Um
There was broad
support for, for
the bill. Um I
think perhaps
the media coverage um
helped with that
um two local
TV, news stations in
Denver broadcast
stories about our
report which found the use of
PFAS and broad
use of trade secret chemicals,
Colorado Public
Radio did a story,
the Denver Post did a story.
Um So there, there was significant
media coverage in the state and
then uh the Sierra
Club chapter in
Colorado
uh spearheaded the effort
to get the bill passed. And there were
other organizations involved
too. And speaking
of the Colorado School of Mines,
you might be surprised to know that
we had one
professor at the School of
Mines speak in
support of the bill. Uh
John Speer
who's a microbiologist
um and he
was also one of the
scientists who
signed a subsequent
letter to the State Regulator,
the Energy and Carbon Management
Commission advocating
for this testing
program testing flow
back water in a
random set of
wells to see
if the chemical
disclosure was accurate.
And he said,
and, and the group said in
that letter that the School
of Mines has the technology
to conduct that type of
chemical testing. So
that's not a barrier.
Um So,
uh so in, in
summary, um there
was some opposition
but as far as I
could tell, not a
lot and there was
significant
support
that's great to hear. Um because
we have some gatekeepers
that you know, for oil
and gas that we
um continue
to have opposition
and uh keep
us from achieving these
same kinds of uh good
legislation, protective
legislation. So, thank
you very much.
You're welcome.
Thank you represents.
I had kind of the
same  Mr.  Chairman, same question
on pushback because
we have very
strong pushback. And I'll give you an
example. I had
a setbacks bill one mile from
schools. And
as soon as these bills come out
like yours, we get
the gas and oil industry
which gives us about 3
billion to our budget. So it's a lot
of money. Um
puts it in the airwaves,
puts it on social media,
everything against
this will hurt New Mexico
and the people who don't,
aren't informed, believe them.
So I know I get a whole bunch of
emails saying, why are you doing
this? You know, we don't want to stop
gas and oil but, but they haven't
heard the rest of the story about all the
things like Senator
said that's happening.
So it's a
big issue
on how do we fight gas and
oil? And we know they're not really
telling the truth.
Did I say
that?
And
it's,
and it's, and when it comes to the
legislature, it's, it's,
it's kids
health versus money
and money wins out. And it's
very sad,
but I
had really the same things
between the leaks and the venting and all
these things that are happening.
How do you stop that. How do
you push back on an industry
like this? Any
ideas?
I think, uh
educating people? Um
and talking
about the costs on the
other side,
particularly the
costs of water
contamination.
Um I remember
11 unforgivable
moment I had doing
this work was about a
decade ago or
more. I was
asked to testify before
the New York City Council
about the potential
that there could be drilling
and fracking for natural gas in
upstate New York, uh
near the places
where New York City gets its
drinking water.
Um,
and
during the middle of this
hearing, one of the
New York City council members
said in his thick New
York accent, the
purity of New York City's
drinking water is
absolutely critical
to the great taste of our bagels
and pizza. And
I, I laughed
and I looked around the hearing room.
No one was laughing. So
it was very serious business
for New York City, but it wasn't
just the bagels and pizza. They were
concerned about the, um,
the state I believe,
estimated that
if New York
City's unfiltered
drinking water, um, and
they have a special
exemption to have
an unfiltered drinking water
system based on
the fact that it comes from
relatively undeveloped areas
upstate, if that
drinking water,
um, were contaminated,
the state would have to build
a water filtration
plant at a cost
of, I, I can't,
I can't remember the price tag now, but
I think it could have been
like a
billion dollars or something
astronomical and 200
it would cost $200
million a year to operate the
plant. And so that
was very
eye opening for, for folks.
Um And as you know,
New York State did
ban fracking, I, I think in
large part because of that,
uh those concerns about
drinking water. Um
just on
um
another
data point that, that you might
look at is
years ago, the
Government Accountability
Office, which is Congress's
investigative arm
looked at incidents
of water contamination
associated with uh
groundwater contamination,
specifically associated
with the underground
injection of oil
and gas wastewater. And
they found
multiple cases where
the water clean up was
estimated to be
millions and millions of
dollars. I think one case might have
been in the hundreds of millions of dollars
and this was back in the 19 eighties.
So in inflation adjusted
dollars, it would be a lot more.
And in other cases, they
said that um
the water clean up was
judged to be not
economically worthwhile.
Um So you can lose
groundwater resources
permanently. So
focusing on those
types of issues
might be effective.
And we did, we, we
are produced
water is huge because we don't have a
lot of water and, and what
do we do with it? Where is it going?
How is it cleaned up? Who is going to be
responsible for paying for
that? Because a lot of times the
state ends up doing it. So
we have a lot of issues and, and
produce water is probably one of our
biggest ones because of our, but
we're trying. But thank you for your
input,
Senator
Po.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair and thank you for
the presentation. I really appreciate it.
It's nice meeting you outside.
Um You
know, I'm just great to
hear about,
um, what's happened here
locally and then the fact that we
can
ban pfos
and these types of
operations, I think
there's been pushback for a long
time. I think,
I remember last year, two years
ago, we were in a committee meeting
here and we were even talking about a
letter and there was pushback
on just a
letter to
ask for this to be
banned. And then of course, the narrative
was, we don't even use
pfos. So it's
like, why are you fighting this?
Right. So,
um these are the things that
happen. Um
And I'm glad, uh
you know, my colleague
here, Senator Cio Lopez brought up the
fact that sometimes things get
told to us like you can't,
you can't do that.
Um or
off the bat, this is
unconstitutional and
what I would tell the public and
I would tell the members
here, we need
to start all
he's asking, show me where
is that at? And
that's what I like to do. People
don't like it, they get mad about it and I
understand the egos. I understand
if you're a chair, I understand if
you're an attorney, but I'm gonna ask
those questions.
Um
So my
question to you
is
um I
know you have here some
recommendations
what we have in
Colorado and you've heard the update
of what's going on here.
Do you have any suggestions
or what we can do
to further
a ban on
P pfos in these
operations? Because I, I
personally believe more
needs to happen. So, do you have
any suggestions on what we could
do to get
there,
Mr.  Chair and Senator
Pope?
Um
I, I think um echoing
my comments to
representative
um is it
Sarinana?
I, I think educating
people is important
um uh especially
about the,
the really extreme
toxicity of
PFAS. I mean, these, these chemicals
are toxic
in the single digit
parts per trillion
level. Um,
I mean, we, we did
some, some
calculations
about how
much, um,
how little pfas
could contaminate how much
water. And I, I
forget offhand what the,
the figures are, but it's, you know,
like a measuring cup
of PFO
A for example, could
contaminate millions
and millions of gallons of water.
Um,
so I think getting, getting that
word out is important, Um
very specifically,
um you might think
about having some public
forums about this
issue um to educate
people and uh
gain media
attention. Um There are
experts who
could I, I think would
like to come in and speak.
Um The actor Mark
Ruffalo has been very outspoken
on these issues.
Um
There's um
you know, there, there are people associated
with the discovery
of PFAS,
the, the, the fact
that PFAS harms health,
which first happened in
Parkersburg, West Virginia,
um who could talk about that
experience. There's a very
prominent attorney um
who was involved in that
litigation. Um
Rob Ballot is his
name. He was actually,
I don't know if you've seen the movie Dark
Waters, Mark,
Mark Ruffalo portrayed him in the
movie. Um So bringing
in people like that who have,
you know, firsthand experience
with PFAS contamination
um could be helpful and I know
that there's some very serious
problems on air force
bases. I, I know you're
a former Air Force
member um because
of the use of firefighting foam
that contain PFAS. And
so people who
have experience
with that um
would be helpful. I I know
personally a
regulator from the state
of Michigan who
helped clean
up PFAS
contamination at an air
Force base in Michigan
called Wordsmith Air Force
Base. So, you know, inviting
someone like that in to speak,
um could, you know, could be
an effective way to spread the word
and build
support.
Thank you for that because
I think in a lot of cases,
right? We're here in Albuquerque and
it becomes this Santa Fe
Albuquerque, Las
Cruces centric
uh discussion.
And then the reality is
where a lot of this is
happening, uh
where contaminations
happening and folks that are harmed
are in those rural areas in
those tribal areas and sometimes
they don't have that
voice or people are not listening
in those communities. So I appreciate
that and we need to do
more. Um just
want to end and say,
um you know,
uh well, first joke and watch
your comment about the media. I'm sure
people have seen me enough on the news.
So I'm gonna let Senator Pinto take
some of that and people upset.
But
um
look, I think
we're all thankful
for
what the revenue is for
oil and gas in the state and what it
pays for
that being said, it's the people's
resource, it's
not their
resource, it's, it's our
resource.
Um And we appreciate
the investment at the same time we
want transparency,
we want safety, we
want our water, land and air
protected and
uh I just feel
that hasn't been happening.
And so the pushback and the
rhetoric and
that we just want to shut it down
tomorrow,
we want to protect our people.
And I, I think that's what we need to,
to continue to
do. Um So
thank you for the presentation.
I still think there's still a lot
more work to do.
I just fear that with what's
happening at the federal level and
cuts, it's
gonna make us even more reliable
on this.
But we can't forget
what this is about
and this
is about our people and our
communities.
But for some people,
unfortunately, all they care about is
money, right?
And so what I would
say to them is
there's a cost to this.
There's gonna be a cost to clean this
up. There's
already a cost of what are we gonna
do with this?
Produced water? It's not produced water,
it's toxic waste. Who's
gonna clean that up?
Who's gonna take care
of the folks that get
sick and the
families?
So when we start talking
about costs, we need to
include that as well
because a lot of these out of state
folks that are coming in
and making a quick buck,
they're gonna be gone
and us as a community
as a state, we're going to
be left holding the
bag to take care of everything.
So thank you appreciate
what you presented and thank you,  Mr.
Chair. Thank
you. Thank
you.
Well, uh, just for the
committee, um
House Bill 222 that we
introduced last session, myself
and Representative Romero
did ban PFAS and
all oil and gas operations
all downhill oil and gas
operations. So it included
that and then it included
full chemical disclosure
of oil and gas, of all chemicals
used in, um,
all oil and gas Down Hall
operations reported
on Frack focus. So
that's what we had last session.
A great bill. Um
Colorado sounds like it did a
few additional things
or so I want to kind
of get into that.
So part of why we asked
you here today was
because, you know,
we are trying to get this
chemical disclosure in New Mexico
so that we can again just
protect ourselves. That's, it's
not about being
anti business, it's
about being prot
prop public health and saying,
ok, if we're going to do business in our state,
we're gonna have full disclosure.
So we know what we're putting in the earth.
We know what we're threatening our
groundwater with.
It's just a good neighbour thing to
do. Um
So we wanted to ask somebody from
Colorado that's done this to
find out how the sky
fallen because that's
what you were saying. They always
sky's gonna fall, they threaten
us with lawsuits. They say
they throw out of
course,
um false arguments
about it being illegal and that's their
job, right? As lobbyists
and everything else is to
give their argument and
misdirection and everything
else. And, uh,
it's our job to
do our own independent
study and know what the law
is and, and I don't know, as
you say, Senator Pope
is to ask the tough
questions and, and, and push
to the fullest extent that the law
allows us to do
our job and change the law when
needed. But,
so that's my first question
to you is now they've done it in
Colorado. It sounds like they've
been
slow to or not
as fast as we'd like in complying
with the law. But has it
impacted oil and gas
operations? Have any operators
gone out of business? Has it seen
any noticeable decrease in
production, having this new
requirement on
them?
I'm not aware that
it has had an effect.
Um, but I,
I think, you know,
it would be,
you know, good to take a look at the production
figures, I think in,
I do know, I mean, the
law has just very
recently been
complied with on a significant
basis. I, I
do know
that in California
where they enacted related
legislation about
a decade ago,
um, there
has been no, and, and, and
California is a major oil
producing state, um,
there has been no significant
change in oil
production in California
where, where
the legislature required
full disclosure of all
fracking chemicals. The,
the difference there is that
Colorado went a step
further, a couple of steps further and
required, you know, closure of
all chemicals going into the
well and require
chemical manufacturers to
disclose California.
Just required full disclosure
without trade secret,
without the ability to hide
chemicals behind trade secrets
of fracking chemicals.
And if you look at
the, the production
curve in California,
it's basically been,
it's been steady over the
last, you
know, the last decade. It and
just to be very specific
because I, I don't want people saying
I, I was misleading anyone.
The oil
production in California
was on a very steady
decline
prior to, I mean, for
years prior to California's
law going into effect and
it just stayed on that same
course after the law
went into effect.
Ok, thank you, Tim.
Did you want to add anything to
that? Do you have any additional
data?
I
and Tim again,
introduce yourself and just Tim,
Tim is probably one of the most
knowledgeable people in the state on these
issues and so he's a good
person to draw from as
well. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
I'm Tim Davis with Wild Earth
Guardians. I represented Guardians
in the rulemaking before the
OC and I don't
have any updated figures,
Mr.  Chair, I can give
you some, we can, we
can run those. But I do
know at the time that HB
222
was being heard
during the legislative session, we
were able to provide
data from Colorado to
show that
um oil
and gas production had not
fallen in any
sort of correlation
to the um
this law becoming effective in
Colorado. Cool. You can just
stay, stay up there. I mean, most
of my questions would be
towards dusty but in
case you have anything to add
um on Frack
focus with your experience with Frack
focus. So our bill,
unlike Colorado did not
set up a separate database.
Our bill for
disclosure really leaned
on Frack focus, leveraged
it, I guess you could say because Frack
focus is already there.
It's already being used. So we didn't
have the fiscal impact of setting up
a new database. We just said
have to expand your disclosure
on Frack focus,
but well, that's not
exactly true. We had
Frack focus for fracking
disclosure and then we
did set up a new CD
form, didn't we for
down hole operations,
not fracking? But it would be
a form that would have minimal fiscal
impact and it would be an automated
form that industry would basically just
submit. So it was
all very manageable from a
fiscal standpoint, I
guess my, so I'm,
I'm reminding myself of how
we structured that. But with
frack focus, will they
take data that
goes beyond fracking
chemicals? Like if
a state were to say we
want you to, you know, if
someone sends you all
down hall operations per,
well, would
you publish that or will
they only do it for
fracking
Mr.  chair? I don't
know the answer to that question. I'm
sorry, but we could find
out for you. Yeah, that was a question.
We tried to research and
I don't know that track focus
ever got back to your predecessor
who started off on that bill.
But just curious, we
figured out a way to do down
Hall disclosure, which
was going to be independently through
our oil Conservation
division, which
was a good solution
wasn't a problem.
Um You had mentioned Colorado
requires disclosure to nearby
residents of
chemicals used, which we did not
have in our bill. How do
they, how do they do that or
what is their
requirement?
Um
We, the, the
requirement is
um a
as far as I remember,
it's not fleshed
out to
a significant degree. Um
Tim may, you may
have some,
some other other um things
to say about that. But um  Mr.
Chair, my, my recollection
is that it
lists the
entities that are required
to receive the disclosure,
the operators have
to provide
that list
of publicly disclosed
chemicals per well
to those entities
within 30 days
of um, of
posting on
the state website.
Um And you know, those and those
entities include
residents within the,
within a half
mile
schools,
public water providers,
fire departments
with jurisdiction over the
individual, well
and others. And
we are very interested
to look
in the near future to see
how well that
provision is being complied
with. Ok.
Do you have anything, are you aware of
anything like that,
Mr.  Chair? Thank you. The only thing
I would add here is
that a lot
of the folks who would be
getting these disclosures
are first
responders. So if there is an
incident,
this would provide chemical
information
that is
complete,
complete chemical information
to those people who are responding
and are most likely to
be uh
exposed to
these chemicals in the event of an
emergency. And this is not
hypothetical. Some
of uh
some of the members here may know that
this summer in Galton,
Colorado, there was a well
blowout that shut down a
school in
evacuated neighborhoods.
And that is
just one example of
why chemical disclosure
is so important.
If you're responding to something
like that, if you live in
that neighbourhood, if your kids go to
school there, you
should have access to the chemical
information. What what is
what you actually are being exposed
to copy that? And
then um final question is
baseline data. How are
they collecting? Sorry you
mentioned it and I was doing
something else but how
is baseline data
collected? Is it
collected right now in
Colorado prior
to and Gas
Mr.  Chair? You mean baseline
water?
I guess
so,
I guess baseline,
what baseline data is collected
so that you can measure
impact to resources
from all.
I have not looked at that issue in
Colorado. Um
But I do know
historically,
it's been very important
in the oil and gas world.
Um, this was
particularly an issue
in a,
um,
a grand jury, a criminal
grand jury that was, uh, convened
by the Pennsylvania Attorney
General about five years
ago. And
one of the findings was
that, um, the,
these baseline
samples were very important
and that,
you know, people did not ii I
think it was one
of the findings was that the state
was not
looking at
the full list of
chemicals that were
likely to be used in the
wells. They were, they were looking
at sort of a generic list
and when you do
that and you take
a baseline water
sample, if you're
not testing for the chemicals that are
later used in the, well,
you can't be sure if the
chemical, if you know the
pollution was caused by
the oil and gas operation
and, you know, families can
be really disadvantaged.
Um, if the oil and
gas company moves in,
starts drilling, their
water goes bad and then
they have to face a
difficult choice
about whether to stay there,
try to hunt for new sources of
water, risk illness
or try to sell their
home. But then the question is
who wants to buy a home? If the
water is contaminated?
You want to avoid those situationss?
All right, thanks.
Well, I think that is all.
I have excellent job today.
Thank you so much for your work. We love
to work with you here on
what we're doing here in New Mexico and
work with Tim and others.
Um
So, you know, to my colleagues
who are saying, what do we have to do to bust
through? You know, my experience putting
on this bill in New Mexico
was that we,
we needed more
uh more
aggressive a, you know,
advocacy by the advocate community.
Quite frankly, a lot of people talk
about disclosure and
concern about oil and gas, but
they weren't necessarily
heavily as involved
as they are kind of on the back end
or in other parts of the process
at the W QC C.
This is an incredible bill. I
mean that we could ban
PFAS and all oil and gas
operations that
uses,
you know, 50 billion gallons
of, of water.
Um We
could get full disclosure
of what is hundreds of
millions of pounds of material
that is not, that's
pretty, pretty profound,
protective and we
can do it. Colorado's done it and that's
why we brought, brought you
here today, but we can do
this, but we do need a bigger push
and we need a bigger push from the executive
branch too, including the
predecessor who was sitting at the table
before you got there, who
regulates the industry.
Um The
sky is not gonna fall. And I
think that's gonna be really important
to track that so
that we can kind of
demonstrate, you know,
that it's a
very robust, profitable
industry that can handle this disclosure
and they're already making this disclosure.
That's the thing. They're already reporting
their well data, they're already reporting
their chemicals on frack focus.
These are other constituents that
are used, that's, they know exactly
what they're purchasing and they're
producers of those chemicals
and those um formulas
know what's in it,
especially when you're not requiring
the breakdown of the recipe,
but just tell us the
ingredients that's in it.
It's just they don't want
to for proprietary
reasons and also exposure
reasons, but it's not that it's
going to break their back financially to
do so, it's that they're not
required to and under
state law, we're, we're
protecting that
secrecy
against the interests of New
Mexico citizens who
have a fundamental interest in protecting
their public health.
So, you know, the same,
I'll just reference the example
of the, the leases, right? When we
raise the royalty rate on
state lands, right? What they say
sky's gonna fall, you're gonna break the
back of the industry. Of course, that hasn't
happened. They haven't batted an eye. What
do we do? We raised another, how
many millions of dollars for our
schools? So
we hear this time and again,
um
Right.
And
yeah, New Mexico is, is
a very profitable industry.
And uh
and again, it's just, you know what,
what's the rules of the game of,
of doing business in New Mexico?
And it should be, tell us what you're
putting in the earth. So at
any rate, this has been really informative.
Thank you again, we're gonna
turn and, and you're
welcome to take a seat and hang
out and we're now
finally the public that's patiently
waited. It is your turn.
And uh we have,
if you have public comment, why
don't you raise your hand just so we could
see if you'd like
to.
Yeah. Anybody
in the audience wanna,
you're just here hanging out, watch
it. OK. We have one
here that wants to make a comment. We have
one
online
Camilla.
Just one.
OK.
OK. Yes. And online
if you want to give a comment online. We
have one person online right now.
Camilla Feibelman with the
Sierra Club. Is there?
Is there? Yeah. Oh, I, I
hear you. Thank you.
Anybody else online want
to give a public comment.
Just go ahead and raise your
hand, right?
Ok.
If you are online and you want to give
a public comment, please raise
your hand. But
otherwise ma'am, we
will go to
you to give a
public comment.
Give you a couple of minutes and just
um state your name when you,
if you don't mind having a seat when
you can't
the
microphones.
Yeah.
Ok.
Um
Right.
It takes a village.
Yes.
Um
Good afternoon.
Um My name is
um
Marlene Barrett and
I am a sister of Mercy
and have been very concerned
about the
hazardous
waste
that has
dominated
um our
land of enchantment.
I would like to say
something about
what began uh
this
afternoon and
that had to do with the carbon
dioxide
sequestration.
I couldn't
believe
that we
have a bill
that said
we will take on
all the financial
and all the land
requirement
that the industry
has
done
that we will be in
perpetuity.
I, I,
I just question
what is the
legislature
doing
to protect
ourselves
and the future
of our state
that we want to say,
bring it on.
Bring it on. Let
us take all this
crazy
um legacy
and let the people that
are responsible for it,
forget it. Let
these poor people who
work day by
day,
they, their
um
health is
compromised,
their air is compromised,
their water is compromised,
bring it on
industry. Let's
get some more of this
pollution because
we want our
dollars to
go for that. I couldn't
believe it.
The second thing I want to
say
is I am so grateful
for this man
and that you
folks
had
um, Duncan
come and
speak.
Can you
believe
that
when
President
Bush
um
came into
office?
The first thing
that I remember was
the Vice President
Cheney,
bring together
all the oil
and gas
industry
and they came
up with the
Hallow Burton
exemption.
Trade
secrets
of the
industry
were to be the
dominant
right
over the people.
And so I am so
grateful
that
um,
Colorado
had the
guts,
had the
tenacity
and had the
courage
to not go
after the
oil and gas
industry's
money
that gives us the
facade
that this is
helping us.
I wanna congratulate
you. Uh Senator
Sedillo
Lopez,
we have not
looked what we have
looked at is what's the
industry doing
for
us,
but we have not
lift it up.
What has the industry
done to
us
when we can
see what
the industry has done
to us
and the future
that this
industry has
given us
and how our
legislature has
not had the
courage and the
wisdom to protect
us.
Thank you again,
blessings.
Ok. So,
uh Camilla, just Camilla.
Ok. Camilla, you are
up,
ok? Did I, did
I manage to unmute?
What's that?
Did I, did I manage
to unmute? You can hear me?
Ok,
great. Thank you. And I
hate not to be there in
person since you are
right by my house. But
unfortunately, I had
to take part
in another public hearing
going on today
in which the EPA
is proposing
to
delay the implementation
of epa methane
rules, not
just their implementation
and enforcement, but also
the pace at which states
will have to
register their own
plans to
comply.
And that follows
last week
after the
endangerment finding
hearings at the EPA
took place where the EPA
is proposing to
basically remove
its own authority
to regulate greenhouse
gasses. And
together those
actions are pretty
concerning, especially
since the state is the
second largest
emitter
of
methane from
oil in the entire
country. And
actually our
second
largest source
of greenhouse gas
emissions as
vehicles.
So these rollbacks
at the federal level on
greenhouse gas emissions
are continuing to
put our state at
risk. And even
though our state
has taken some good steps
towards regulating greenhouse
gas emissions in each of those
sectors, we're
not anywhere close to
what the goals are that we
set forth for
ourselves. So
I think I'll echo
Marlene in
saying
we're facing greenhouse
gas emissions.
Those come with a
hazardous
emission,
which in most
cases is volatile organic
compounds, which create
smog and puts our kids air
at risk. And then you
combine that with risks
from PFAS,
not just potentially
um injected by
oil and gas, but from
all sorts of other
sources. Plus
fracking chemicals,
plus any damage that
might come from trying
to sequester
uh co2
from oil and gas.
And we have to ask ourselves,
you know, what's the cost?
How much does this add
up to? And how does
it measure against
the royalty based
income coming
from this coming from
oil and gas? And so
I think in listening to different
parts of the agenda
today, um
you know, I've been grateful to
hear the progress.
I've been concerned
to hear that on the one
hand, um we're
concerned about PFAS
in New Mexico Water
and that we're
reopening um
the reuse
of uh
fracking
produced
liquids
um outside of
oil and gas
operations.
And really
needing to name that
our groups will have to go
through another rulemaking
process on that in
March. Even though
the W QC C just
prohibited that reuse of
produced water
outside the oil field
for five years.
We'll need to go through
the carbon
capture and sequestration
rulemaking that will
be forthcoming
when what we really should be
doing is taking the
free energy from the
sun combined with battery
storage or wind
and battery storage
and really
making ourselves energy
independent, taking
action to free
ourselves from,
from these hazardous wastes
and really count
what the cost to
our state is from allowing
industry to
act unfettered.
So, thanks for all you're doing.
Thanks for bringing these important
topics, but I hope
that we can measure
the cost and
take action
this coming session on comprehensive
climate action. Thank you
so
much.
Thank you. Anybody
else,
Don. Do you have any final words
of wisdom on
radioactive waist
whip?
Oh, you have an audience with
the great Don
Hancock.
Thank you, Senator. You should know
better than to ask me a
question.
Don Hancock's Research
and Information Center in
Albuquerque. I
guess 22 points
I'd make just very quickly.
Um uh
One to follow
up on what Secretary
Kenney said in response
to Representative Ariana's
question.
Um I would put
it uh a context
is
um I
testified two years
ago before this committee
after my
organization, the Department
of Energy, the Environment
Department and a variety of citizen
groups preached a
settlement on
the new renewal permit
for wip wi
and congratulated
doe and SIMCO, the
contractor for
agreeing to a number of
provisions that were
stretches for them.
And I said at the time,
the real, it's
great that they have
agreed to these provisions.
The real test is whether they're going to
comply with them or
not. And
unfortunately, two years
out as I
have told them directly.
Um I'm
very disappointed in their
lack of
compliance.
Um And I think
that's a whip related thing
but, um,
Representative Sarana
asked about loss. Alamos.
I think the same thing is true
there. And so there's a significant
amount of frustration
um in
groups like mine and
others.
Um And
I think you saw some
of it expressed by Secretary
Kenny as well, uh
in this lack of compliance.
So we need
the Department of Energy
Los Alamos and whip
to do a lot
better.
Um
The other thing that
I'm just
calling to your attention that
I'm quite concerned
about is it looks
like the Department of Energy.
Uh at Whip
is going to move
forward with what's
called a supplement
analysis.
And uh Senator
Cillo Lopez knows the National
Environmental Policy Act.
So wip
environmental Impact
statement and record of
decision says
that whip will operate
not past the
year
2033
doe in fact,
wants to operate with what
we say is forever.
What they say is at least
50 more years past
2033.
So they have to do some kind
of National Environmental
Policy Act
process
to
say that they can move forward with
this, the proper
process to use in that would
be an environmental impact
statement, either a new
one or a full supplement
to what they've done. It looks like
they're going to move forward
with what's called a supplement
analysis, which will
say we don't
need to do more.
Everybody knows everything they need
to know about us
operating whip forever.
And by the way, we won't even let the
public comment on
it.
That's not ok.
Um, and I
bring that forward
to your attention
because I think it would be
useful if,
um, uh,
members of the legislature
and other folks,
um, in state
government
start telling the Department
of Energy. Now that would
not be ok.
So that maybe they will
um do a
better process
and a public process
and actually let people
understand and
comment on what the
impacts of keeping whip
open forever when
our state would be.
Thank
you.
It's been a great meeting. Thank you,
everybody for attending. Thank you committee
and good to have you here with us,
Senator. We
need your big brain here in this
committee, big
issues. All right. Thanks
everybody and thanks to the staff again. Great
job today. And thank you,
Paul.
We are adjourned.
