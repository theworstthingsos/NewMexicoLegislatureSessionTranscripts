In the long.
Okay thank you
secretary we're going to go on
now to the LFC presentation and
then we'll go to questions from
the committee.
Thank you madam chair.
Most of my analyst or in the
office work and preparing for
the hearings later this week we
have.
This model Taurus we saw this
morning is on the loose on that
this afternoon public schools
for and then also ginger
Anderson please stand she's
another highlands fellow and
she'll be working for us during
the session choose a getting a
graduate degree in social work I
believe that the violence of.
Quickly I'm going orient you to
the volumes the three volumes
and we've done that before and I
think you know a lot about him
so do are super quick but volume
one is the policy discussion and
the report cards if you set up
to read anything in order to to
read the first ninety.
Plus pages the volume on the
policy discussions public at
higher at health and Human
Services you know just good
general background on the goals
of government the successes and
accomplishments and challenges
the policy issues and some of
the major expenses we face.
Volume two.
Volume two has the details of
all the recommendations for FY
twenty three which is section
four of house bill two of
recurring there's no
nonrecurring in here but after
all almost all the hearings
you're gonna have in the next
couple weeks or recurring for FY
twenty three you can have a
nonrecurring subcommittee this
meeting at the end of this week
but most of it is next year's
recurring appropriations.
So the narratives of our pretty
important and well written I
believe and informative and I
you you know environment health
public safety at the it during
hearings well you can keep an
eye on some of the committee in
in in.
Going to for every agency and
finally volume three.
So much has some of the most
interesting and important
information you can provide for
project of the.
You know I'm gonna just like a
few these pages almost about
half a dozen questions from
members of the last month the
how we doing on unemployment
well on page eighteen.
Here's how we're doing on
unemployment the first session
rather house bill two last year
put six hundred million and and
despite the draw down it looks
like going forward we have about
four hundred million and
balances in the unemployment
trust fund and hopefully we've
which reached a steady state on
that with unemployment claims
having fallen way off so.
When I just just some other
examples.
Page forty five General Services
Department health benefits one
projection there in the red this
forecast shows there were no
hole about twenty five million
ending the we're not ending.
Middle of the month of October
twenty one and and getting worse
basically every month you're
very important to pay attention
to the actual condition of this.
Some of like a few other
examples where we show workload.
In general for many agencies
workload is going down here's
the A. K. love page fifty one
downward trend in workload in
the courts the some of that
reflects the COVID environment.
That may not sustain but that's
where we are today.
Page fifty nine inmate
population way off you'll find
in the LFC recommendation the
cause of this decline and
workload that is the number of
prisoners in custody the LFC
didn't have an increase
projected for corrections
recommended for corrections
because of this decline the
workload.
page one twenty one you can hear
more about this this afternoon
but forty five percent of the
budget going to schools and
we're down on page one twenty
one down on membership.
From a peak at three thirty one
to three oh seven and about a
seven year period a decline of
of.
Twenty five thousand almost it
but eight percent and a six year
period and accelerated during
the pandemic.
Do know for higher ed on page.
One fifty eight higher
unemployment.
Of sharply in the last ten years
down twenty seven percent less
five years down eighteen percent
so among the many things you've
got to look at how to properly
for right size person how to
account for all the revenues not
just general fund think about
workload is issue of the
approach these budgets a lot of
information in this document to
say like one more revisions.
Page two hundred and.
Of the four twenty may be
allowed to leave a comment here
but FY twenty one or versions of
seventy two million so you don't
want to put too much in agency
budget submitted ultimately
system the treasury of and it's
not spent so with that I'm gonna
turn it over to Mr solely that's
the orientation our documents
you'll get more the Dave every
hearing you'll get a different
sheet and you'll get for the
bigger agencies what we call a
high level different sheet so
Mister so is going to present
the highlights of our
recommendation that all wrapped
up with a few more questions.
Thank you Mr.
Right so I'd like to turn your
attention to value one.
Starting on page two.
And there's also a handout that
you have it's got a summary
table of recurring.
Recommendations for both LFC and
DFA.
So madam chair.
at the end of the summer the
committee adopted budget
guidelines that set out the
priorities for how to develop
the LFC budget recommendations
and those guidelines were really
important because they talked
about prioritizing education
spending health and Human
Services child welfare and
public safety.
the guidelines also gave
direction on making sure that we
were shoring up agency budgets
coming out of another round of
solvency to make sure we back
filled the use of non recurring
money and maybe in agencies
recurring budget that's an
important backdrop to the
overall spending recommendation
which is a little bit less than
fourteen percent you might ask
how can you grow government for
that much in that big it's the
answer is you're not really if
you look at this document.
On page four you'll see kind of
an inverted triangle.
So the new money
That was projected by the
economist in this December
revenue estimate was about one
point six billion dollars the
LFC guidelines and and
recommendation called for
basically not spending all of
that and setting some aside for
tax reform about four hundred
million.
But then also back filling of
the to unfunded liabilities that
the state had the biggest of
which is Medicaid the
expectation is knock on wood
that the public health order
ends next fiscal year if that
happens then the the state's
enhanced federal after that
we'll go away and the state will
have to increase its
appropriations for Medicaid
which is grown during the
pandemic significantly.
There's other liabilities that
exist out there the education
retirement board is got a huge
actuarially unfunded liability
there are lots of other budget
mechanisms that you had to do
with the budgets even this
year's budget.
That need to be back filled and
then the other big pieces the
compensation fully funding the
the compensation package the LFC
was recommending that would
start in FY twenty two and
continuing to FY twenty three.
So about more than a more than
half of the a fourteen percent
increase our dedicated to
shoring up the budget still in
doing those kinds of spending
activities then there's the
three percent compensate the
three percent of the new money
went to compensation that's a
seven percent total compensation
that split over two years with
three percent starting in the
last quarter of this fiscal year
four percent next fiscal year
obviously you need to build and
three percent in the agency
based budgets and then three
percent and targeting programs
that have a demonstrated track
record of getting results we're
likely to get results as well as
other prioritize spending within
the agency budgets so in volume
one let's start with talking
about some of the specifics.
So early childhood you had some
discussion this morning about
that the new trust fund that was
that was established and is now
starting to spend money off
spending an extra ten million
dollars for early childhood
programs which relieves the need
for big general fund increases
and in fact most of the general
fund increases in and this
department budget is to back
fill the use of of non recurring
money that was left over from
for pre K. but the other ten
million dollars going to
expanding services for things
like home visiting that
hopefully will be matched with
Medicaid that will be stretch
those dollars even further
continuing to expand a pre K.
for three year olds
As well as supporting
Tribal early childhood programs
of about one point six million
and then doing work for supports
as well the children youth and
families department LFC
recommendations about a seven
percent increase
this recommendation prioritizes
evidencebased programs
particularly in child protective
services to get better outcomes
in that particular program
The the recommendation provides
a significant amount of funding
for the expansion of the number
of positions that the department
has not at the level that they
requested we think they've
already got a number of of
funded vacancies that they're
struggling to fill that's going
to be a common theme that you
hear throughout your budget
development discussions is LFC
try to fund a targeted
interventions that we're going
to improve outcomes day and many
of the executive asks were for
agencies to get more money for
hiring more people when you
consider we're likely and full
employment particularly for
professional services that's
going to be a major challenge
and you want to pay specific
attention to how much money they
already have to hire people
today that they're not I'm able
to hire before you want to add
even more money to those based
budgets CYFD is a good example
of that.
The education budget for public
schools overall it's more of a
more than a twelve percent
increase above this year's
graduated from the general fund.
The big pockets of spending
growth for
the public schools are obviously
going to be in the state
equalization guarantee that's
the funding formula
the increases are largely driven
there by out
any creating another increase to
the at risk index.
back feeling some money that was
used in the SCG this year to
make sure that it's recurring
going forward.
Making sure that the extended
learning program that adds the
ten days after school
programming and teacher
professional development is
universally funded and all
schools would be a participating
in it and that teachers would
have new higher minimum salaries
that when combined with the
compensation recommendation
would put the getting salaries
north of fifty one thousand
dollars
level two sixty one thousand and
level three around us seventy
thousand
districts could that were high
performing could opt out of
needing to find the ten calendar
days if they're not already
doing it but they have to be a
high performing school district
when it comes to student
achievement and ensuring that
you don't have large achievement
gaps that's what the court says
an expectation in this court
findings and if it's a new if
it's a district that's move
newly implemented the program
they would be have additional
flexibility going forward to
implement that program being
able to convert some of the
day's towers.
finally there's recommended
increases for the Indian
education fund to try to address
some of the
lawsuit findings related to
cultural linguistic needs of
students
There's also funding for early
literacy initiatives of about
six point three million I will
say the tribal
the recommendation for the
Indian education fund would give
tribes and nations maximum
flexibility to determine how
much to spend on the type of
programming that they need
whether it's through their
tribal libraries and support
programs whether it's developing
a tribal departments of
education all with the again
cool of improving language
acquisition as well as that
there's other recommendations in
higher education for
diversifying the teacher
workforce higher education is
about a four and a half percent
increase
most of the money is geared
towards the institutions primary
educational objectives and and
and instruction in general
there are also some targeted
increases moving over to page
four.
for student support services and
wraparound services the
subcommittee heard a lot of
testimony and work on that
there's also targeted funding
for again this tribal education
initiatives there's about one
point seven million in
additional recurring for dealing
with teacher pipeline pipeline
issues Unadilla gate teacher
shortages and like I said the
six million for student support
and wraparound.
In Human Services the Human
Services Department obviously
has the bulk of funding
In the recommendation to replace
the lost federal funding that is
anticipated going into FY twenty
three.
The general fund recommendation
also does support that
enrollment continuing extends
postpartum services for new
mothers for one year rather than
dropping them off Medicaid after
a very short period of time.
To also raise hospital and
provider rate affected by
utilization inflation and
minimum wage adjustments.
For behavioral health there's
recommended increases for the
nine eight eight crisis now
phone line using both recurring
and non recurring funding
there's also money for
a non Medicaid behavioral health
providers and I would say that
the Medicaid behavioral health
request was fully funded.
The health department has about
eight a half percent increase
some of the most notable policy
proposals in this budget
includes increasing provider
rates for the Medicaid DD waiver
providers as well as enough
funding to support the
elimination of the DD waiver
waiting list that's going to be
supported with seven and a half
million of general fund the
primary support for being able
to eliminate the waiting list
are the a massive influx of
federal funds that will be
available the next couple of
years will need to pay attention
to how that is implemented
because we'll need to likely
back fill some of those federal
funds with general fund in the
future if the build back better
proposal which it doesn't look
like it's going to pass in its
current form doesn't pass but if
that provision in that bill does
passed in the federal government
would pay for the elimination of
the waiting list going forward
so that's something that to keep
an eye on.
Recommendation also includes
other increases for public
health and epidemiology response
and it also replaces the use of
some non recurring revenue and
some of those programs Judiciary
it's about a five percent
increase overall on average for
the judiciary the judiciary is
another good example of where
there are targeted salary
increases above and beyond what
we talk about when we mention
the seven percent teachers got a
targeted increase in this case
judges and other court a person
public defenders that help with
real hiring as well as the
a district attorney's.
Public safety is another good
example of of large increases to
both
provide additional compensation
above the seven percent for
state police but also in this
particular case the LFC
recommendation doesn't recommend
expanding some of the positions
particularly civilian positions
that are important for fighting
crime like in here labs to be
able to process those
corrections department just Mr
Abbey talked about this is a
department significantly
impacted by workload declines
the number of people and.
Isn't started declining before
the pandemic and it's continued
through the pandemic alleviating
the need for funding increases
for this department some of the
funding was reallocated towards
justice reinvestment type of
services to try to continue to
reduce recidivism and some of
the savings were directed to
other public safety agencies as
you can see on the bottom of
page six with criminal justice
reform package that the
committee had.
What.
You're making reference to the
committee recommendation.
LFC yes yes madam chair
representative.
The LFC recommendation I've
talked about the compensation
and how that would work there's
also
recommended compensation
increases for those lowest paid
state employees as well as
employees in higher ed and and
public schools to bring the
minimum wage up for public
employees to thirteen fifty an
hour
Pensions there's a scheduled
increase for the employer
contribution of one percent for
next fiscal year by law LFC
recommended putting an
additional one percent on top of
that for a total of two percent
contingent on the legislature
and governor enacting
legislation to continue to chip
away at that solvency I talked
about a broadly tax reform in
the bottom of page six and then
if I could turn your attention
to the nonrecurring spending.
Page five of this handout madam
chair members of the committee.
We'll go over the nonrecurring
have questions.
So.
What I have shown here is
there's an LFC total column and
that total column includes
general fund it includes arpa
the LFC recommendations spent
all of the art of funding before
the special session that the
committee finished its business.
And then the next column you can
see some of the LFC
recommendation for arpa was
enacted during the special
session.
And then this next column is how
much of.
Is left over and needed to fund
to fully fund the LFC request
and what is that total look
like.
So I'll just for purposes of
what's is the LFC recommendation
includesd just focus on that
column and then you can see what
you may have already advanced
and and spending like on roads
out of the arpa and you'll have
decision points
about how to allocate the mix of
general fund arpa and other
state funds the chair in LFC
talked a lot about how all these
different funding sources have
to be packaged together it
looked at in their totality to
really get the full picture so
in total for transportation LFC
recommended
nonrecurring spending of almost
five hundred million dollars
including four major investment
projects like examples would be
passing lanes and some of those
highways that need major repair
down southeast New Mexico six
laning again portions of I.
forty things like that.
another trying to money for
local roads rest up upgrades
charging stations equipment
roadway beautification which was
done in the special session.
Broadly speaking for economic
development type initiatives
about six hundred and forty
seven million some of these
you've already done so for
example broadband
do did tribal libraries tourism
but then there's money set aside
for public private partnerships
for like
energy hubs
hydrogen energy hubs as well as
brought economic development
investments and fifty million
dollars for higher education to
use as the state portion of
federal matching to match
federal funds for our indie type
initiatives.
Water infrastructure you have in
your marks for these existing
processes using STBs for like
the water project fund or for
colonias or for
the tribal infrastructure fund
the LFC recommendation is to use
the are for money and staff that
on top of those funds to provide
even more water funding
available ideally the agencies
would use that are pro money as
the first dollar out thus
creating more capacity and time
for planning the bigger STP
funded projects going into the
future.
the last two can be categorized
as a real jobs natural resources
and quality of life initiatives
including money for tribal
libraries a big investment real
jobs and natural resource
improvement you did about forty
million during the special
session there's about fifty
three million of related items
like soil water conservation
districts things like that those
are additional investments that
are the LFC plan and fifty five
million for regional rec centers
and quality of life projects
higher education a hundred fifty
million for the lottery
scholarship program again the
art of money would be the first
dollar out the door and then the
lottery money would build up a
cash balances and that would
result in lotteries ability to
fully fund tuition for the next
four to five years
opportunity scholarship is about
forty three million dollars
there's other investments for
faculty endowments to help with
your behavioral health education
and nursing
programs the institutions of
higher ed of not been able to
keep up with the data type of
demands the state has with
hiring of faculty needed to
teach in those programs you
could go to them and say will
fully in doubt you know for
thirty positions to be able to
hire more social work faculty to
double our degree production to
meet the workforce demands or
teacher colleges or nursing
programs you did about fifteen
million of that for nursing.
Line thirty six would be for
Developing evidence based
behavioral health and child
welfare programs one of the can
hitters to expanding the network
of of community programs that
actually work our start up cost
for private providers the state
could use the art of money to
help with the start up cost and
then the providers could turn to
start billing Medicaid or
billing families first and
bringing this federal dollars so
it's a good bridging strategy
that the committee recommended.
I'll wrap up with the there are
some COVID specific responses
that are still out there about
seventy four million
the hospitals is one of the you
did most of them during the
special session the hospitals
the LFC recommended twelve
million to help with their
staffing issues to be leverage
with Medicaid dollars again
Medicaid is covering nearly half
of the state it's the biggest
Karia next to Medicare for
health care services it should
be at the table to help finance
some of these particular issues
finally madam chair on the
bottom or the other column or
the other bucket four hundred
twenty million.
A lot of this includes your
normal specials and
supplementals kinds of requests
this is still a pretty hefty
number of a hundred ninety one
million and eighty seven for I.
T. projects that normally handle
through your subcommittee and I
I think if I'm correct madam
chair you're going to want that
subcommittee not just look at
the those narrow nonrecurring
options but everything on this
list which is totals over two
point three billion dollars will
be a little bit less than that
because you spent about four
hundred and seventy six during
the special session so much two
billion dollars worth of
nonrecurring spending will be
part of that sub committees
were.
Madam chair with all that
spending a both during a
nonrecurring if you look at the
the last page
the LFC had a reserve target of.
Thirty percent and LESC was able
to meet that reserve target with
significant increases in both
recurring spending and use of
non recurring money for the
future with that madam chair
have been answer any questions
all right David go ahead.
I'll turn Representative
quickly.
Working from the supplemental
document for the last two
decades New Mexico's experienced
a boom or bust seems like almost
every two or three years look at
this is the slide we show off
this goes back to FY I six but.
Open down and that can make your
head spin.
but I I discussed this morning
what painful decisions that had
to be taken when the legislature
gets too aggressive so much
booms are nice but downturns
require painful cuts in for this
boom so we are in a bone for
this boom some question I would
suggest is an order of Mr slowly
talked about the pyramid on page
four it talked about fourteen
percent in the LFC
recommendation doesn't look
cautious but he pointed out that
about a percentage back filling
and much of the rest of it is to
bolster pay which is necessary
just to maintain the services we
have to keep the people during
the work.
Might seem funny but there's
more nonrecurring funding than
the current and I think that
matters a lot if you look at
page of.
Page three I'm comparing the
executive in the LFC
recommendations for recurring
and non recurring.
Then a few things stand out.
You know public schools
incredibly were only a million
different.
And and that bodes well for
resolving some of the
challenging details like
pensions or extended learning
time.
K. five plus another reforms
higher there's a huge difference
to your of eighty nine million
you know that looks like in
higher ed department an increase
of three hundred plus percent we
understand it's the opportunity
but that's almost double the
amount last year and and that
that doesn't that's
Doesn't quite make sense though
so you really want to get into
that.
The the last big one that really
stands out is one thirty two
Medicaid.
And the LESC is a hundred
fifteen million higher than the
executive on Medicaid and at
that was ten million below the
agency request and for but to
get a new Medicaid forecast and
if anything the LFC
recommendations can be too low
to cover the Medicaid with the
executive recommendation
proposes a.
A of supplemental appropriation
of about that amount to cover
Medicaid and let my point would
be in the in the second bullet
we all.
We LFC staff from time to time
to recommend using nonrecurring
revenues for recurring
appropriation but we tend to
want to do that in those
downturns when we're trying to
keep keep the trains running
we're trying to keep the ship
afloat.
Well this isn't one of those
times this is one of the time
where we are in a very
favorable economic conditions
this isn't the time to you know
use those.
Budgetary tools that help us
survive but might not both well
down the road we have to come
back and replace the money not
the time to replace the money
when we have now what's the
what's the other side of that
coin of being low on Medicaid.
Is that almost every other
budget added together the
executive is a hundred million
higher than the gonna be
streaming through on the front
pages the paper recent weeks of
show those agencies with double
digit increases at a lot of it
comes because of what we
perceive to be just under five.
we although I don't have this in
a bowl and I think it's
important to make sure you look
at total recommendations and not
just general fund especially in
the natural resources area of
the LFC recommendations and
guidelines take advantage of
other state funds and federal
funds to stretch the dollars and
and I'm I'm pretty sure in some
of the key natural resources
agencies like EMNRD and garment
LFC is higher even though
general fund for the low.
The.
In addition to flagging the use
of non recurring for recurring
in FY twenty three operating
budgets I would urge some
caution in making of recurring
appropriations from special
appropriations executive has
special appropriations to total
seven hundred and twenty seven
million Mr slowly pour the LFC
is a little over a couple
hundred million you know some of
those in both LFC and exec some
of those are truly nonrecurring
or some of them are spread out
over multiple years which is a
good way to convert nonrecurring
to recurring but I would urge
caution in using non recurring
money to start up recurring
programs that you're gonna have
to fund in future years
This morning I mentioned
workload.
And even as these increases are
pretty pretty significant
workload is down in many areas I
have listed some public higher
ed enrollment use in juvenile
facilities adult corrections
prison population child care
just to give some examples.
Now in terms of the ability of
of government to address the
appropriate appropriations
increase of I would point out
that the US in the New Mexico
economies or effectively at full
employment especially the U. S.
economy with unemployment on
Friday was announced at three
point nine percent but as low as
we're gonna get New Mexico still
six point two percent.
But especially for the
occupations were we want to hire
people and government to address
our spending needs of
professional applications
professional occupations like
health care nurses doctors
advanced practice nurses
teachers engineering accounting
IT and project management
especially in these areas I
believe in New Mexico ripple and
so so practically government
managers will be hard pressed to
hire staff to to expand
operations the LFC recommend
some but on a much lesser scale
than the executive director.
And finally I I I'm gonna flag
it's sometimes worth looking at
the budget act The New Mexico
statutes chapter six section
three paragraph ten eleven and
funds of budget the LFC
recommendation addresses all
aspects of the budget and
including general obligation
bonds and severance tax funds Mr
Slee didn't talk about the
beginning.
The hearing.
One seventy other
recommendations for severance
tax funds NGO funds the total
half a billion.
The executive doesn't have
recommendations for those of
them of the operate command
Daschle's Mr so we covered so
thank you madam chair.
Or anything David thank you
Charles and thank you secretary
Romero for The presentation
we're going to go ahead and go
to questions follow start with
Representative Anderson.
Thank you madam chair.
That.
Listen to the.
Act the LFC presentations.
peers thank all have virtually
identical total for.
Eight million four hundred.
Five million year okay very
little.
For.
And yes I looking at the
explanation is secretary Romero.
Was gonna ask.
One secretary Romero.
The first is a helpful walk in
this legislative session if you
will number the pages.
Because you're not have to hold
it up and show it to you.
It's going to be critically
important that the information
you.
That we're able to track.
Secretary I see that higher
education is going to get the
billion dollar.
Madam chair Representative
Anderson I apologize I apologize
now.
Thirty years and all we're not
the numbers
that is an oversight on my part
the biggest thing increase for
higher education is the economy.
At eighty five point five
million dollars of
recommendations so that we
really see because these are
higher education institutions.
Our prior gate well I was really
secretary asking about the
billion dollars to table
Representative general fund the
high.
there's a line item says higher
education one billion dollars.
So I wonder about that.
Back to the table with the.
Patience is higher education on
the.
Yeah yes you're correct the
opportunity scholarship.
Five point five billion.
Of course it was on the field.
Education program nine million.
the reason for this decision is
that going to get a two and a
half million dollar increase.
Representative that's right it's
a two point five dollars.
Thank you for that cations is
that the only what what on that
page that has increases and
marketing other increases no no
no and so.
It all.
The the res very credit with
the majority.
And I can get the.
Exactly these increases for.
Thank you because that will be
very helpful of the work we have
madam chairman
because this page posed to.
All of the items under higher
education here seventeen million
dollars.
Making one wonder rules I wonder
where the other eight hundred
and eighty three million dollars
go so
Madam what I'm not happy.
With the addition for the same
amount of money and there is no
way to.
Compare.
We got a hundred seventeen
million dollars identified for
higher rate of.
The bill credit there's no you
know that's a lot of explanation
act.
Yeah get off all for dual credit
I have no problem with it I just
don't understand what.
To
The general industry training
On page
thirty.
And then
taking all and total so you can
actually see what
is our.
because of that.
I.
Secretary Romero I've I've heard
early in the only one that has a
copy of this and I got this from
staff we got it all for the it's
it's available on my medical
care but we did not printed on
project because I believe they
were going to do that I say okay
we it was our understanding.
That they were going to be
provided by the presenters today
but of course the staff super
perhaps be and so I have this
and.
It's interesting because it it
starts on on what I have in
front of me actually starts on
page thirty.
And gets into the
High level by agency code but
it's not it doesn't provide the
detail that I believe the
representative would be looking
for at this time.
Senator.
Well I
live next to you and I was told
that they had.
The also I'm not sure why.
There's I'm sorry.
Madam secretary we do not have
those and staff is telling me
they have not been delivered.
Chair I I apologize for that.
All right let's go to any other
questions Representative Dixon.
Madam chair
Questions I think of the.
Representative.
with regard to the centers of
excellence I was just wondering
Lavery on the phone.
Excellent.
Four of western.
here and then.
Who is
year off.
My.
Sorry madam chair and secretary
could you just elaborate on what
defines a center of excellence
that Ellison Mike closer for
the.
Thank you.
Can you put your money
Representative Allison closer to
her there you go.
Thank you.
This is.
At.
Sir can do not on.
Where there is that active users
program and so we need to give
you an additional.
Activities.
For
For
Programs.
To try to hello.
The the the purpose of this year
we get more.
And then
you know.
To.
are made in education
is that have the.
Have the program will program.
There have been
go out into the workforce in New
Mexico.
Thank you secretary thank you
madam chair another question
regarding the ten million
dollars
sorry hundred million dollars in
nonrecurring spending for the
ten year public safety
initiative
madam chair and secretary I was
wondering where those funds go
in terms of agency oversight.
Hi.
Madam chair representative the
funding will come to the will
of.
The appropriated to DFA under
the current proposal and DFA
will then
Allocate that money to the local
jurisdictions we do we do that
are pretty much on a regular
basis with the a lot of
different programs that we
minister and so it just makes
sense that that DFA we have the
mechanisms for doing that and so
that's why we're recommending
that come to the Department
line.
Thank you madam secretary of I'm
sure I have I think just
of one or two more questions
Madam secretary in terms of the
hunger initiative in the
fourteen point four million
dollars I think that's a
fantastic initiative and I
really appreciate that
We're addressing that I was
wondering however I know that
there were other task forces
that
Members of the legislature had
proposed for instance I know
there's one on social work and
so I was curious how.
This particular task force and
its budget recommendation was
selected as opposed to some of
the other
also worthy causes thank you
madam chair.
Madam chair representative I I
think it was just you know the
hunger.
Issues came to light during the
pandemic and I think for the
last couple of years we've seen
an emphasis on trying to address
hunger needs I'm not sure that
it was over in the other purpose
other than it was just
we we've already had that
momentum going and we just
wanted to to make sure that we
started putting the resources
where we know the needs are.
Thank you madam secretary madam
chair last question
with regard to the health
professional loan repayment
program the two point five
million dollars
who will be qualified for that
And is that a sufficient amount
of money to cover applicants who
would like to participate in
that program thank you.
So Madam chair representative my
understanding is that the higher
education department has done
some analysis to determine that
this is sufficient to cover that
particular program and so
applications I mean basically
it's it's in in I have to get to
the specific details and I'm
happy to do that on what is
considered L. profession and so
please allow me some up an
opportunity to get that
information for you.
Thank you madam secretary madam
chair up I have no other
questions thank you already
thank you representative
Representative Crowder.
Thank you madam chair
my first question is is a
general question for both the
secretary Charles solely
Charles you made a comment about
teacher salary the tears would
be just north of fifty one sixty
one and seventy one I think and
within the secretary's proposal
they're showing a compensation
to provide to treat teacher
salary tiers.
It looks like they're looking at
sixty.
Fifty sixty and seventy I
believe it is so are.
Are the pay raises for the
teachers on the same plane or is
there stark difference in the
teacher pay between the two of
Madam chair representative.
Delicacies a recommendation
starts with increasing base pay
for teachers and then there's a
little bit of a bond that gets
them north of those figures for
the extended learning program as
the and the the recommendation
is that House Bill to include
new minimum salaries so that you
can be assured that the teachers
actually receive the salaries
for the time that they would be
working.
Then madam secretary do you how
we get to the those numbers are
a little bit different we're
taking into account that the
vast majority of spending on
these extended learning programs
are for a teaching or okay so I
I think either save madam chair
Charles in your opinion they're
they're fairly close is that
accurate okay
madam secretary in your
presentation I I did find myself
in agreement with the
Representative Anderson we're
we're.
Highly lacking in details on
here so it's very difficult to
understand on your early
childhood you show seven hundred
and sixty six point seven for
regional literary coaches.
And when you come before with
with the
Budget request to the to the
committee it would be very
helpful to have a lot more
detail what's defined scope
where they have to do how do you
measure outcomes how do you know
if they're successful and I
think you'll be very helpful if
if we see that in your public
safety request you're asking for
for recruit schools including
two lateral schools for about
just under five million to be
very helpful if we had some
definitions and details on what
those schools are how they have
to perform how's it going to be
measured how they fit into the
system I I don't know that and
then the other one that caught
my attention was on jobs and
economy madam chair the cannabis
control division at our L. D.
six point five million I don't
have any details at all on that
I have no idea what that is in
in the cannabis and hemp bureau
it New Mexico Environment
Department two point three
million I need a lot of details
on that to to understand it to
want to be comfortable with it
so I just want to give you a
heads up now that those are
those are something that we're
going to need more information
to help decide for discern which
one of these we believe is best
for the state of New Mexico and
and what we really needed and
all that the madam chair my last
question is for Charles Charles
of page five year book
Under health department you have
a million dollar for fire safety
program it's a top of page five
third line down.
And I'm really curious why the
one million dollar for fire
safety program is not under the
public safety department or
something how did it wind up
under the department of health
Madam chair representative
because it would be in the
public health program to better
study and understand what's
going on with
Ation basically issues with
criminalize use of firearms or
for a possibly for suicide and
so those are the for
epidemiologists to to study
those issues as well as develop
a prevention programs that could
be rolled out to communities to
help alleviate this problem okay
it and I see right now what my
interpretation when I read
something like that I I see it
firearm training program or
something of that nature that
for the country would seek spots
I appreciate it thank ranchers
already are Representative
Herrera.
Thank you madam chair and thank
I think everybody in the hi I
appreciate this so although it's
always overwhelming to me that I
am sincerely appreciate all the
work that's gone into.
I'm.
I I saw Maria we're putting ten
million and the rolling down the
library program thank you I
think everybody who could do
that Representative Armstrong
and I worked on for a couple
years so that's deeply
appreciated can you tell me how
much for putting in the trial
tribal libraries and how much
for putting into rural librarian
down its Madam chair
representative you all
appropriated ten million for
tribal library development
during the special session so
we're matching this in the rural
libraries with ten million
dollars okay
really kind of different the ten
million from the special session
was depend but clearly to work
with department of Indian
affairs and that's intended to
be for construction of at least
several libraries and planning
grants where is the ten million
for for the rural libraries in
general is an endowment fund
pursuant to statute that is
spending of a recurring revenue
stream to make formula
distributions to there must be
forty were leveraged that will
be operating expenses coverage
correct thank.
can I trust can you go into a
little more detail about how
you're going to put the are the
money into kind of the wanted to
you know the water trust fund
that tribal and the colonias in
and how you're going to build up
those funds with our committee
so that we have more
expenditures can you just go
over that a little more detail
for me
Madam chair representative.
So the special session you
appropriated the remaining arpa
funds the in their entirety to
the appropriation contingency
fund so they weren't in there
the other day but they should be
in there shortly
and then in house bill two
you'll make appropriations out
of that appropriation
contingency fund that would
supplement what you're the
setasides you have in STV's and
what I was saying was that I
hope the agencies when their
accounting for
the spending of those dollars
would spend the the converted
our pet dollars first because
then that would can if they NMFA
water transport they've already
got a list of projects that have
been vetted and gone through the
process that they'll present to
this session it's likely they
won't open that up to an
additional you know ten or
twenty million dollars for the
session but they could use
whatever you approve.
From the harp of money to go out
the door first that's going to
create a surplus of that same
exact amount in their STBs that
then they can plan with
communities across the state
this next year to come before
you with the bigger ask.
Madam chair and I chose I'm
caring for the NMFA's so it's
fifty.
Requests so so when you get this
this are committee in
How much do you anticipate that
that will be that's what I'm
trying to figure out what kind
how much money are we talking
of the Madam chair
representative the
recommendation is for an
additional thirty nine million.
For the water trust fund.
In nineteen and a half million
each for the colonias and tribal
infrastructure.
This is on page five.
Yes lines twenty through twenty
two of my hand up thank you and
also can you talk to me about
the different.
And I have the same problem as
Representative and Anderson an
outer and I remember talking
about this in two thousand
nineteen it would be nice for
everybody to call whatever
they're calling it the same
thing I mean you know I don't
think the LFC budget and just
you know supplement those
numbers so we can compare you
know we can compare things that
you know if if the PED called
something five thousand other
names and you guys call it so no
one can compare anything so you
know it just be nice for
everybody to work up one good
that's the same so I I along
with that it's impossible to
follow this and and it is very
difficult so I just want the.
Governor's staff to understand
that if it's been that way as
long as I've been on this
committee which hasn't been very
long I refuse struggle with the
can you talk about the
differences in the amounts of
money between with that of the
of the administration's calling
for when you guys are calling
for in life watershed management
fire suppression and those
things because those are huge
issues in our rural parts of the
state so I mean this drought has
water tables are low
Fire suppression is nonexistent
because our mutual domestic
water systems you have to have a
six inch pipe to feed a fire
hydrant so I'm just saying we
don't have that infrastructure
we desperately need to start
really feeling in that my hope
we could do that with our money
can you just kind of talk about
that.
Madam chair representative if
you look you look back at my
hand out on page five line
twenty six.
There's a twenty five million
remaining in the LFC
recommendation for watershed
restoration forestry and
firefighting teams.
And what is the governor's
office calling for in this.
madam chair Kerri Rivera can
answer that I don't think it's
appropriate for the LFC staff to
respond to somebody else's work.
Representative Romero.
Excuse me on secretary Romero.
Madam chair representative on
I can tell you that the
recommendations for
The energy for EMNRD is higher
than the LFC is recommendation
and we do focused in on
Watership
I'm.
I'm waiting for staff to act
exactly what the differences
between that but the I think for
state engineers office and for
energy and minerals Environment
Department that is active with
the executive is is focused in
on is the climate change of the
draft and more mental issues
that are are are plaguing our
state right now so manager I'd
also like I think I think I just
saw them pass out the documents
and and so I'm I apologize again
for you not receiving it sooner
but you know my experience has
been that the this presentation
is always been a high level
presentation and so it's mostly
just to explain what the
executive budget recommendations
consist of I think the details
that that Representative Crowder
and some of you of the others
are looking for are going to be
you're gonna get those specific
details with during the agency
with agencies come to present
before you when you have a both
budget analyst DFA budget models
and LFC budget analyst and you
have the agency in front of you
so I hope that you will feel
better knowing that there's more
details coming and I apologize
again for you not having the
documents when we started this
meeting.
Secretary Romero it understood
that it went to the sergeant at
arms office instead of up here
so it's been sitting down here
apparently go back to
Representative for go ahead
thank you thank you madam chair
thank you Secretary stuff so I I
guess my question is when.
This page which is kind of a
high level that the equipment is
the grant matching funding for
wetland and watershed protection
is at one point five million so
I I guess when we get done here
I guess and we get the
department here will go down
into the weeds a little bit and
see how they match but it looks
like it's pretty far off but
that's that's all I have to say
thank you madam chair.
That's a good call good COVID
secretary Romero but I could
tell you that I'm just looking
at the document now and
when I'm looking at these high
level tables I'm not sure if
we've been talking about just
complete general fund here or
other state funds or what we're
federal funds are what we're
talking about.
When I look at table one is our
aggregate number of the total
amount.
We care about what particularly
with those general fund
allocation so let's go to the
next person Representative
Trujillo was on my list she
stepped out for medical school
Representative or small thank
you very much madam chair thank
you madam secretary thank you Mr
silly and and LFC madam chair
madam secretary I guess a couple
of of overarching questions one
specifically around the Medicaid
treatment has been explained in
madam chair set out we're gonna
dive into a lot of those details
appropriately so in the over
this course of this we can HSD
hearings.
But madam secretary from your
perspective given the hundred
fifty million dollars difference
and the difference where it's
one time in the executive verses
recurring base budget in the LFC
is that do you have a specific
reason or frame why that is is
that the sense that more people
will be going on to the state
insurance exchange or are those
details better for us to dive
into later in the week.
Madam chair representative small
thank you for the question
I think the executive was really
concerned about the amount and
and just felt like you know it
wasn't sustainable and so Zacks
you the Human Services
department to look at that and
to to come up with the plan
and so we think that addressing
it in the short term will
hopefully we'll have a long term
plan we still don't know whether
the the public health order is
going to be extended and and
what that happened
Mr so we've talked a little bit
about that and so we have
opportunities now to give time
to fill the gap until we can
come up with a long term plan
and that one Fund the above menu
items and so we really need to
look at the for the experts and
have them come up with the full
on how we can reduce and not
maybe parole Medicaid as as much
as.
Been suggested right now okay
thank thank you madam secretary
at eight that's a very you know
that's open and I see madam
chair no Mr Ivey.
Would you such a big chunk of
nonrecurring revenue to address
recurring need it's important to
look over the hill and say
what's the budget going to look
like in FY twenty four so you
know page four four three we
have a healthier outlook for the
general fund.
It's it's the kind of thing that
you might want to keep in mind
if you have that thank you madam
chair and thank you Mr Abbey and
madam secretary Mr Abbey brought
up really looking because it's
there the executive approaches
nonrecurring looking in the what
what the out year projections
are for Medicaid costs
Secondly.
Madam secretary.
In terms of of such that with
the remaining are for funds that
we are now your in or on their
way to the the the state
treasury.
I guess one question is you you
know that we those are addressed
in the LFC recommendation are
there do you anticipate further
detail addressing those from the
executive perspective.
Is question one and question and
comment one eight to that whole
area of consideration in
building on what Representative
had at a asked about.
You know there's many of the non
recurring large appropriations
that were made in H. B. two in
the most recent special session.
Likely will
support shared
goals you know there's ten
million to the river stewards
program for instance with New
Mexico Environment Department
the the executive highlight on
the one point five million for
watershed and for wetlands it is
really seems like there's going
to be a lot of crossover so I
think the COVID is going to be.
We need to work through is is
been discussed.
Integrating the the
nonrecurring.
Substantial once in a generation
investments and see how those
fit into kind of our on going
needs but specifically to the do
you will the executive make
recommendations for the
remainder of the federal the
unspent federal funds.
Madam secretary.
Madam Chairman representative
small at this point I'm gonna
say the answer is no we really
are you know I think given the
past few months and what came
out of the court hearing we're
we're relying.
To some extent on the
legislature but we have we hope
that there's going to be
conversations about the use of
those funds
the one thing that I need to
caution everybody about is even
though there appropriated in
their appropriate contingency
contingency reserves are the
corporation's payout we still
have to follow the federal
guidelines and and and and and
the reporting requirements and
so you know I think we just want
to be sure that whatever and
that's why I think we need to
have a conversation I need
because I think there needs to
be collaboration the executive
and the legislature on the use
of those funds because bottom
line is we don't want to have to
repay those funds because we
used in a way that we should not
have.
Absolutely thank thank you madam
chair thank you madam secretary
that that if that sounds great
you know there's a strong
framework that will be able to
work with but I think the point
of mixing of really seeing
nonrecurring federal other
nonrecurring dollars along with
recurring state funds is part of
what we're doing together now is
appropriate the overall spending
levels are you know very close
they'll be a lot of detail work
but that's what I'm sure is that
it's up to do so excited for
that thank you madam thank you
Representative Lara go ahead
Sir.
Thank you madam chair thank you
madam secretary for the Haidle
presentation I had a couple of
of of of I guess I have
questions and I know we're gonna
have I know I understand the
we're gonna get into the details
with the with the working groups
on some of these items but the
on the education of page it's is
here this twenty one point seven
twenty one point seven million
for and anticipate insurance
increases.
And what I what I want to ask
your what I wanted to to convey
here is that this is something
about that are really going to
be looking at because I really
want to know who this is for
such as can be for teachers is
it going to be for the bus
drivers is going to be for
social assistance so that's
something I want to that I want
to look at as far as that
allocation for their participate
in insurance increases.
And one other thing that I'm
terrible so put it on your radar
possible we will talk about in
the higher education working
group is the dual credit there's
a ten million dollars is being
allocated and I recall venter of
secretary during your
presentation you had mentioned
those could be expansion.
With those two million dollars
so I would really like to know
what's being expanded and how
how the universities are going
to
receive this and what the intent
is of those of these ten million
dollars so I just wanted to put
those aren't on your radar madam
secretary and we'll be
discussing it the I guess during
our working upon higher
education thank you mentor ready
thank you I've got two more
number gonna have a hard stop
because we have our next
presentation and that the
representative Allison and then
to wrap up this Representative
Sweetser so go ahead.
Thank you madam chair of my
question is for madam secretary
on your slide for compensation.
Of the second vote the teacher
minimums fifty thousand sixty
thousand seventy thousand and
seven percent for all school
personnel.
I would like to know and I'm
curious about how you arrived at
the seven percent what criteria
or what data was used to make
that of.
The decision on seven percent.
So madam chair representative
Allison you know I think it was
just we know that we are
struggling with finding teachers
we know that we're struggling
with keeping teachers and we
felt like the seven percent
increase in across the board
would would be so this is a no
what we do is we we we get it we
figure out what what percentage
of the cost and then we look at
if we multiply that by seven
percent what that cost is going
to be and what the impact could
be we actually have data from
the public education department
where we can run information to
find out what the what the
impact is going to be we just
bill like seven percent plus the
increases the tears are really
going to get us where we need to
be in trying to retain and and
recruit more educators to the
state in Mexico this would be
higher than our surrounding
states.
This thank you for that madam
secretary the reason why I ask
my question is this past Friday
I met with educators in my
district and they produced a
graph where some of the teaching
person that receive a salary
between fifteen and twenty five
thousand were paying an
insurance or a health care
premium between four hundred and
eighty six and seven hundred and
seventy eight dollars per month.
Whereas in the Albuquerque
police or the Albuquerque public
schools of persons with a salary
between thirty and forty five
thousand we're paying one
hundred and thirty six and two
hundred and seventy two dollars
a month of the graph that they
produced was of the title.
Health care premiums and
disparities and it was produced
by of national education
association of New Mexico and
I'm wondering if that should
have been figured into the
percentage of raises to be made
and why does it seem that the
rural community is paying more
for their health care premiums
than the urban areas.
So madam chair representative
Representative you know I think
that's a really good question
and I think it's definitely
something that we need to dig
into I don't see it just with
I don't know why they would be
paying higher in rural areas
than the service areas.
My understanding is that the
rates should be to say that the
insurance rates the same but
definitely something I need to
look into I can tell you that
the recommendations for the
teacher anymore was a discussion
between the governor and
education leaders in the state
and so I.
We build that we have our
recommendation meets the the
request that that that were
presented at the time but we
definitely I would love to see
that report and I would love to
look into a little bit more to
try to figure out why there's
such a disparity.
Representative what we're gonna
do is I'm secretary Senator
we're gonna save that question
for the next presenter and I
think he'll be able to answer
that for you okay go ahead thank
you madam chair did you have any
more questions no that was it
thank okay thank you Mr
Representative Sweetser wrap it
up thank you madam chair and I
just have had a number of
conversations recently on the
hunger initiative which crosses
eight agencies and is going to
be very difficult I think for us
to track and I just wondered if
LESC can give us any kind of a
comparison of what the
particular agency
recommendations are going to be
you know it's nice to look at
this and see across the agencies
but then we're gonna have the
agency independently and feel it
be nice to be able to compare
that's my only request madam
chair.
With more than a dozen agencies
asked to address the hunger
initiative and mostly with
recurring funding.
As I understand this is a
nonrecurring funding source so
that would be a flag to to
expand these hunger initiatives
with nonrecurring funding again
sometimes highly it's reasonable
to start out a pilot program few
naturally going to continue it
see if it works and then moved
to recurring but this is
probably one that wouldn't go
away after here too so LFC
generally didn't recommend of
the hunger initiatives that were
spread across many agencies or
couple exceptions thank you for
that director Avid madam chair
but some of these are things
that are funded so the this is
an expansion effort that that
you're not recommending an
expansion of is that basically
okay I thank you madam chair.
All righty well I think that
wraps up this segment of our
hearing this afternoon I thank
secretary Romero and and David
Abbey and Charles Lee for the
presentations this afternoon and
I'd like to go ahead move into
our next presenter which is the
public schools support and
Senator you gonna kick that off
all right very good.
Yes this particular web how can
we have to start a new weapon
are so the give us a couple of
minutes if you have to run down
the hall so to start a couple
minutes.
