that regional planning, regional
services were the way to go for
our state. And when we discuss
this in one of the committees,
somebody asked me the question
of what percentage of our state
needed mental health, behavioral
health, substance use treatment,
I indicated that probably 50% or
more.
And one of the LFC analysts, uh,
Ruben Esquibel indicated that
she thought it was much higher
than 50%.
So I'll turn it over to my
co-sponsor, Senator Woods.
Mr. Chair
I want to thank you for
the opportunity to present
today. I'd like to break down
the bill for you in the
sections. Section one creates
the behavior Health Trust Fund.
It's a non-reverting fund in the
state treasury income from the
investment of the fund is
credited to the fund.
The State Investment council
will follow prudent investment
rules.
Uh, for this fund quarterly and
annually reporting requirements
to the legislature.
Initially, annual distribution
of the fund will occur July 1st,
2026 equal to 5% of the average
end of the year market values of
the trust.
Similar structure to the early
childhood Trust Fund, the corpus
of the trust.
is counted as part of the
reserves for financial year
2026.
Section 2 is the Behavioral
Health Program Fund.
Creates a program fund in the
treasure that is subject to
appropriation by the legislature
for.
Number one, mental health and
substance abuse treatment
intervention and prevention.
2
The necessary infrastructure
technology and workforce
supports that facilitate the
delivery of behavior health
services and programs.
3 matching funds for federal,
local, and private money and
grants related to behavioral
health services and programs
including Medicaid.
For
Offsetting costs incurred to
comply with federal requirements
related to behavior health
services and programs. 5
implementing of a regional
behavior health plans throughout
the state.
And under B, it requires
reserves of unexpended funds at
the end of the year to go back
into the trust.
Mr.
Uh, Mr. Chair.
I appreciate the time today and,
and we're open for questions.
Excellent. Uh, thank you very
much, uh, Senator Stefanik,
Senator Woods, we'll go to
questions from the committee.
Senator, uh, Representative
Herndon.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh, and
thank you for us. So just for
clarification in terms of the
mental health and behavioral uh
uh behavioral health aspect of
it. Uh, you indicated that, uh,
mental health.
treatment and support, and I
wanted to make sure that that
would include for our mental
wellness rooms in our schools
and for
Uh, individuals who would serve
as interns in those rooms to
support our to support our
students.
Mr. Chair and Representative,
uh, many of the aspects of this
were included in Senate Bill 2
and expanded to include the
requests and the ongoing efforts
throughout the entire state.
So schools were met Mr. Chair
Representative Herndon, schools
were included.
Thank you very much. And does
that, Mr. Chair and Madam uh
presenter does that also include
the interns from our, uh,
colleges and graduate programs
that would serve in those rooms
to help the students.
Um, Mr. Chair Representative
Herndon, it isn't a Senate Bill
2 hospital. It's in your house
bill too. Thank you, Mr. Chair
and thank you presenters.
Thank you and next we'll go to
Representative Lujan.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
to um sponsors for bringing this
forward.
Um, I didn't hear the beginning
of it of the.
The comments on the bill.
So we are investing $1 billion
from general funding to this
fund at this time, Mr. Chair.
um, Mr. Chair and Representative
Lujan, the money, the amount of
money was stripped from the bill
that'll be determined by House
Bill 2 and the negotiations
between the House and the
Senate.
Thank you for that. I appreciate
that very much, um, Mr. Chair,
uh, that's, if I can, if at the
time after reviewing this a
little bit more, if I can come
back for a second round, I'd
appreciate that. Yeah, no, that
sounds great. Uh, we'll go to
Representative Luhan or sorry,
excuse me. Thank you,
Representative Han. We'll come
back, we're gonna go to
Representative Garrett and then
represent represent Garrett.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for presenting this.
My question is on section 2,
page 3.
Um
Lines, uh, basically 4 to 19. So
this outlines how the behavior
health program fund can be used.
My question is, uh, the
healthcare authority administers
the fund.
But to use these funds, does it
require legis it
Does it require specific
legislation on all these issues,
just how does that work?
Who's gonna decide, I mean, this
is basically everything in the
kitchen sink that it can be used
for from IT to facilities to
people. How will that be worked
out?
So, um, Mr. Chair, Madam Chair,
and, uh, Representative Garrett,
I have with me as well today,
Adrian Avila, who's chief of
staff for our Senate Finance,
but first of all, the healthcare
authority is the single state
agency to receive federal
Medicaid funds. So that is why
they are identified in this
bill, and the second part of
your question had to do with how
the money would be appropriated?
So, um, it does have language in
here that the legislature would
appropriate, but uh if you want
further detail, I could turn to
Adrian.
Uh, Mr. Chair, yes, briefly.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Representative
Garrett. So yes, it is subject
to appropriation by the
legislature. So once you all
create the corpus every year a
certain percentage, 5% will be
distributed out. So let's say
hypothetically it's a billion
dollars.
Starting in 2027, 5% of that
plus 5% of whatever it generates
in the market, we'll get to come
out and basically that, let's
say that's 50 million.
Right? And at that point, HAFC
and Senate Finance and LFC will
basically say, all right, this
50 million based on regional
plans, based on what we need for
Medicaid, based on potential
changes at the federal level.
We have to use it for behavioral
health.
But there's an opportunity to
leverage Medicaid dollars to
make that $50 million into 200
million. So you've suddenly
taken a billion dollars worth of
savings.
And guaranteed up to 200 million
a year.
In perpetuity.
To come in, and that's not
general fund money.
Right? So that's kind of the
full structure, and then in
terms of the specifics of how it
gets dispersed into the
communities. I think the key to
that is once you um say you're
appropriate to the healthcare
authority, they will review
regional plans, that's in Senate
Bill 3, that framework, um, they
will review regional plans and
basically look at this is the
gaps. These are the things that
are needed in a certain region,
and you all will have all that
information to make and
representative, if I might add.
Think about other state funds as
you've appropriated through
here, this would be considered
one of those other state funds
that we appropriate.
Mr. Charon, panel, thank you.
Thank you, Representative
Garrett, Represent Ereta, then
represent Pettigrew.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
Uh, Senate, I deeply appreciate
this bill. I, I have to let you
know I was at a, a meeting with
a hospital doctors in at Holy
Cross Hospital in Taos in like
the beginning of January and I
had seen later work that day,
and he said they were looking at
a billion dollars in behavioral
health, and I, I announced it to
the doctors and in unison they
all said, thank God. I, it was
incredible, the wave that went
through that room and they're
probably
20 doctors in that room. Uh, it
is, it is so needed and um so I
thank you for this, but I do
have a few questions, you know,
as Tip O'Neill says, all
politics are local, so I wanna
know. I have um in our, in our
hospital in Espinola, they got
uh Senate money, um.
money,
uh, earmarks, uh, to do a detox
center, but they really didn't
have the money to run it, you
know, it's one thing to build a
center, it's another thing to
keep it running. So with this
kind of uh funding uh do that.
Uh, Mr. Chair, a representative
her. So yes, this is both
operational money and
infrastructure money. Senate
Bill 2 will go into the details.
You all actually appropriated
within House Bill 2 in the
specials, um, most of Senate
Bill 2, and that includes money
for facilities, and it includes
money for detox, so if
They need to, for example, add a
few more beds and they need to
rent the space and lease the
space. There's money for that.
If they need the startup money
to hire the providers to provide
the service. There's money for
that. And then within the
recurring budget, Medicaid is
the primary payer for behavioral
health services. So, ideally,
the pain of the services once
they're stood up, there's money
in there, but the flexibility of
Senate Bill 3 and the
flexibility of Senate Bill 2.
Um, ensure that, for example, if
someone isn't covered by
Medicaid.
That money can be used to cover
those individuals.
I thank you for that, uh,
Adrian, thank you, Mr. Chair.
And then I have another project
I'm working on in Cuba, uh,
where they have kind of an
abandoned school center that
would be perfect for a rehab,
working with the county to get
the, you know, to have them do a
land swap with BLN who kind of
owns the land, and then we could
bring in a a rehab center
serving the Navajo Nation up
there and serving the community
of Cuba and um looks like it's
all gonna come together, but of
course they.
need help too, so this would
also help with the um the city,
maybe buying that and running it
and leasing it to a provider who
would then uh provide the rehab
uh for that community.
So Mr. Cha and Representative
Herrera, I just, uh.
It's possible, but this is based
upon regional planning.
So if an individual entity came
in by itself to request
something and wasn't part of a
regional entity, they might have
to go back to collaborate with
everybody else in the community.
Thank you for that, uh, uh,
senator, uh, and, um, yeah, they
are, we're working with County
of Sandoval and everybody else,
but thank you for that. Deeply
appreciative.
Thank you Herrera, uh,
represent, uh, Pettigrew then
ranking member chat.
Thank you, Chair, and thank you,
senators for
Bringing this legislation.
Um, chair, my first question is
to, to Senator Woods, asking
what perspectives he saw inside
of.
Gonna be one that
Made sign on.
If I understand your question,
you're saying.
Why did I wanna put this
together.
Determine, yes.
German, sorry, leaving you out
of the discussion, apologize.
Representative play grew.
You know, it took a little
talking to get me on board with
this.
Because
It's growing up.
But
That we're talking this is.
This is more than the fun that
I'm going to talk about here
because this is processed.
What happened in my particular
area.
Sure.
Is that 5 counties came
together.
They're trying to do a regional
critical care.
Behavior health.
Clinic
hospital, 12 bed deal.
And
For them to come together, they
knew that.
They didn't have the expertise.
Mexico
To handle the situations that
came upon them.
So
Look
But they band together, they're,
they're, there's asking me to
try to fund their clinic. We, we
did get together $10 million to,
to get this deal started and,
and, you know, they say they've
got enough money to put it
together.
And just to tell you the truth,
they're talking about using
lounge chairs.
Actually,
Because we're talking about
people in very critical
situations, Mr. Chair.
So
I got to thinking about that
pretty hard. And then I went out
uh.
Behavioral health resources is a
provider in my community.
They invited me over for the
visit.
And many of
for the visits, I'm sure.
I have no expertise in
behavioral health.
So when I go talk to somebody, I
have many questions.
And the questions they gave me.
Or answers they gave me.
was uh
We
See a lot of people.
But we don't get to see him long
enough.
We are seeing them for 2 or 3
visits or a month's worth of
visits.
And it takes about 6 months.
The change behavior.
So what the hell do we do?
How do we, how do we help rule
New Mexico? How do we help?
Downtown Albuquerque.
And when they brought the
thought to me about
We need to do a regional deal.
We need to decide.
Let, let
Southeast New Mexico, northeast
New Mexico.
You know, originally we talked
about um
The district courts, those
Different districts as being the
ones.
In those areas.
But really
The court system AOC is going to
be involved with this, and, and
they, we need someone in charge
of it to, to, to drift it
together and again I'm going
into the function which is not
in this bill.
But you asked me,
Why I was doing this. Well, they
had to sell me on the whole
package before I came to this
deal.
So I, I hate, I'm sorry if I
that's great. Thank you, Senator
Woods. Great question.
Representative Pettigrew, uh,
back to you, Representative
Pettigrew.
Chairman and Senator, thank you
for sharing that.
Giving me an understanding, and
I appreciate that.
Chairman, uh, presenters, um, so
as I look at.
What's going to happen over the
next couple of days with respect
to house bill too.
It looks like we're gonna spend
About $148 million.
Then we have a projected revenue
for 2026.
Which means we're gonna be
pulling money out of reserves.
To offset that.
Wild guess.
It's got to come from somewhere.
And it hadn't even got over to
the senators, Senate side yet.
So, and I, I bring that up,
chairman and senators because
With the appropriation pulled
from this because there was
nowhere else you were gonna get
it from, we spent all the, all
the excess.
Um
Is it safe to assume chairman,
uh, senators that all this money
is gonna come from reserves.
And then still count in our
reserve calculation.
To start with, that's exactly
what it looks like.
We're going to count, double
count this, if you might, yeah.
Thank you for that clarification
and, you know, my concern is,
you know,
So, you were there and, and.
A muscularro at the end of the
mountain gods when um we, we
learned brand new definition of
new money.
It came out thinner.
No legislative authority, no
nothing. We just redefine new
money that we'd used for
decades.
Senator, Chairman, are you aware
that we don't count reserves the
same way we count money now. And
just a quick reminder to go
through the chair, um,
I think we're, we'll try to stay
focused on the trust fund. There
is, it does count, the bill does
count as reserves, so fair to
sort of bring up some reserve
piece, but
Yeah.
Go ahead, Senator.
The, the, sometimes things are
hard to explain in black and
white. So let me give it a shot.
We have
Reoccurring expenses.
We have one time expenses.
We appropriate every year.
For every penny
And that's what y'all are
working on, right?
Every year
The appropriate.
The appropriate the big pie, and
we appropriate it because of the
consensus revenue that we get,
the, the, the guests, if you
may, that we get.
What we're saying on this bill
and how we're going to fill this
bill.
Is that we're going to have so
much of that revenue that's
going to be available to go in
this bill.
And
Miss chairs.
And Charing Senator, I
appreciate that very much.
For it to be part of our.
Reserves, that means we can't
spend any of it.
The minute we start spending
that chair and Senator
no longer in reserves.
So, I have a whole lot of
problems with the way and the
concepts of how some of this
stuff has been done.
And I appreciate you bringing
the bill, but there's no way I
can support this. Thank you.
Thank you. Uh, ranking member
Chatfield and representative
down.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, Mr.
Chairman, uh,
You know, whenever we talk about
violence, I say we need to deal
with the people. Whatever way
people, they come wanna take my
guns away from me. I say we
don't need to deal with the
guns. We need to deal with the
people. We need to deal with the
issues that are affecting our
society, and I, I think that
that's what this would do.
You know, I don't think you're
spending the reserve, you're
spending your spending the
interest off of those reserves.
You're keeping the reserves.
But you are specifying where the
interest will be spent. Is that
true?
That's true, uh, for one year,
we're not going to do anything
with this money except show it's
in a fund.
And for many years after that,
you're only spending the
interest off of it. I just read
the bill. That's true. Yeah,
thank you, sir. So, uh,
You know, the most interesting
part of the bill to me is the
last.
Last section, Section 3, says $1
billion will be appropriated
and so I had to get it in my
head straight.
Um
And that's, that's what I see
here, you're appropriating the
future interest off of this, uh,
reserves. It'll still be held in
reserve, it'll be held in
reserve in this, in this fund,
like a lot of other money is
like the money for ECHCD. Is it
a fund like uh the water trust
fund.
Uh, those are little savings
accounts and, and this
appropriates money to a fund,
and it spends the interest.
Uh, so
I, I probably will vote for it.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very remember
Chatfield. Uh, next we're gonna
go down then represent Duncan.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, senators for being here
today, and I, I'm wondering and
maybe Munoz is also here.
Whoever wants to answer this.
Do you think that there's any
risk by placing us at the office
of the courts, creating, um, I
mean, courts are supposed to be
impartial. How does this make
sure that in in sentencing that
they remain impartial. Are we
creating a behavioral health
model to for criminal justice.
Is this what we're doing?
Oh, go ahead. We're not trying
to solve crime problem here.
If that's, if that happens.
I hope it does.
But this is not a crime bill.
We're we're not expecting to do
group therapy and, and, and
solve crimes, Mister Chair.
What we're trying, we, we want
the criminal justice, the AOC
involved in this because they
see people that come in to their
system repeatedly.
How do we
How do, first, how do we locate
those people?
How do we
Administer service to those
people.
How do we create the direction
to send those people.
So
That's where I see AOC coming
into this program, Mr. Chair and
Senator maybe but we're the
appropriators and so we're
setting up a fund and giving a
different branch, judicial
branch, it looks to me, the
grantmaking authority, and I'm,
I'm not, so that does make it
criminal cause you cause you
need to be in the courts, or,
OK, so help me here, help me.
OK.
Um, Mr. Chair and Representative
Doo, thank you for the question
and I'm gonna try to answer, but
Adrian has all of the detail.
Um, first of all, this is only
the trust fund, and the trust
fund is the interest that's
gonna come off in order for the
legislature to appropriate.
Senate Bill 2 and 3 get into the
details. The bill that dealt
with the AOC actually did get
changed quite drastically to
include many more.
Entities on that planning group
so that the AOC was just the
coordinator, but it brought in
behavioral health providers
brought in other stakeholders
that brought in state agencies,
so the original intent of the
AOC and the and the districts
got changed quite drastically in
a different bill. This bill is
only the trust fund, but if you
want more detail, Adrian can
provide it. OK, because Mr.
Chair and senators, the very
first language says
appropriation. It's making an
appropriation to the
administrative office of the
Court's Regional planning
statement and I think, sorry,
yeah, so we'll just, we're on
Senate Bill 1.
And we're taking up uh we we
will be, we will be discussing
Senate Bill 2, and that was the
desire for this spot, yeah, OK,
thank you, Mr. Chair. So what
we're voting on right now is
Senate Bill 1 to make an
appropriation for behavioral
health programs. Uh, great. So
Senate Bill 1 creates the
behavioral Health Trust Fund, if
members will look uh to the blue
page, the amendments.
The, the, the transfer section 3
on page 4 was stricken entirely,
so I guess let me, I'll just ask
to confirm. So, well, we'll
confirm in HB 2 there is no
money in here right now. Fund
hasn't been set up.
This bill that we're considering
today does not appropriate any
money into the fund. It creates
the behavioral health trust
fund. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm
gonna have to, I was reading the
wrong one. Thank you. Great,
thank you very much. OK, we'll
go next to Representative Duncan
and then uh keep going from
there.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh, thank
you, senators. Uh, I, I couldn't
agree more with um what we need
to do to help our, our folks
that have these problems.
Um, just 11 quick question,
well, two quick questions for
you, uh, Mr. Chair.
Senator.
Um,
can, can you explain the
regional
Um, unless you just set on
County, for example, um, would
we be, would we be down with,
uh, Senator Munoz with Gallup,
or how would that work out and
Yeah, I mean, are we gonna
travel 100 miles.
In any given direction.
Um, Mr. Chair, again, this is
the trust fund, so the regional
planning and the regional
entities were in Senate Bill 3,
and if you want to delve into
that, Mr. Chair, uh, Senate Bill
3, I can have Adrian get into
that.
Mr. I'll, I'll just, if I could
just talk offline with Adrian a
little bit and that would be OK,
Mr.
Thank you very much,
Representative Duncan.
Uh, OK, we're going to go to
Representative Luhan and then
Vice Chair Dixon. Thank you, Mr.
Mr. Chair, um.
And I'm probably gonna be
trending on the same lines in
the next just as representative
Doo and understanding and
putting this all together, but
this is just the fun we're
talking about. So, um, go to my
notes here.
So the program fund will be
administered by HCA subject to
appropriation by the legislature
to provide money for services
and programs related to
behavioral health.
So, HCA is only gonna be the
administrator of the funds where
are the
And this might go to the next
bill, and you can tell me that
if you will.
Where is the planning? Where's
the, where, where are the
oversight of the programs and
everything else that this, this
funable fun, Mr. Chair.
So, uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative Lujan, that's in
Senate Bill 3.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Then we'll wait for a chance to
talk about that, Mr. Chair. OK,
so.
This is, so the HCA will only
function as as a.
Well, rather as the appropriator
of of the funds as.
As the legislature gives them.
So, um, Mr. Chair and
Representative Lujan, the HCA is
the um funding authority because
they will have the ability to uh
take in any federal match, and
that's why they are identified
in that. The legislature is
still the appropriator and the
planning groups will in fact
request funds to be
appropriated.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And so,
You would agree if you could, if
you, you might, the, the HCA is
fundamentally the the
responsible, the.
The agency that has the um
could I say this?
The expertise and behavior
health, Mister Chair.
Senator
So, Mr. Chair and Representative
Lujan right now, um, the
healthcare authority being the
single state agency for Medicaid
for the entire state does
actually have the uh behavioral
health collaborative located
within it, and it does
collaborate with all state
agencies on behavioral health.
It was determined Mr. Chair
Representative Lujan that close
to 19 state agencies, it was
either 17 or 19 state agencies
do participate.
paid in some type of behavioral
health. So there needs to be
some entity that coordinates
them. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh,
thank you for that answer. And I
don't want to get into the weeds
or anything with the other bills
cause this is what we have in
front of us, Mr. Chair, but I
think it's, it's information for
the community to have that that
that the behavior have
collaborative will be repealed
and NSB 3. Is that correct?
I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear
the question Mr.
Chair, the behavioral health
collaborative will be repealed
in SB3. Mr. Mr. Chairen or Mr.
Chair Representative Luhan Yes.
Mr. Chair and, and um senators.
Where I'm, where I'm concerned
is that we're just gonna give
some, we're gonna get some
fiscal responsibility to the HCA
without them having the overall
uh authority over the
programming and planning of what
happens in behavioral health,
Mister Chair.
Do you care to comment on that,
Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair, uh, Representative
Lujan, I would let Adrian, uh,
speak to that because he's
familiar with the whole package
of bills.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair Representative. So in
repealing the behavioral
collaborative, uh, the reason
for that is you don't want
competing entities making
decisions at the local level.
Right? And the Beaver Roth
Collaborative hasn't met in well
over a year, and it has a 15 to
20 year track record of being
ineffective.
Right? So in Senate Bill 3, it's
a new framework where all three
branches of government are
actually held accountable. It's
not just the healthcare
authority.
Right, and
It's the healthcare authority.
The courts
And the legislature all playing
a pivotal role in ensuring the
success of the behavioral health
system of New Mexico.
And that is a drastic shift in
paradigm than what we have
currently, which is just the
local behavioral collaboratives
that has a CEO that hasn't been
hired in well over a year, and
they've gone through cycles and
iterations and changes with
every administration and every,
you know, few years, you have
something drastically changed.
So now we're providing
stability.
The courts out of the three
branches of government are the
most stable out of the three,
right? The courts are there,
they have institutional
knowledge, they, they serve as
that leveling field. So that's
why they were included to help
facilitate regional planning in
Senate Bill 3. The legislature
is the oversight body. You all
will receive all the data, you
will receive all the plans, and
you will get to say, oh, there's
an implementation issue right
here. Every quarter, right? So
every 3 months, the legislature
will receive those updates. So
it's like
completely different paradigm
shift and in doing that, that's
one of the reasons why we had to
um
Cut the behavioral
collaboratives.
Thank you, Adrian, thank you for
that explanation, and I will
wholeheartedly disagree with
that. I will agree, however,
that yes, there's a
dysfunctional aspect of our
current behavioral health
collaborative, and we all know
that.
However, to put in the
behavioral health.
Structure that we need in our
state.
In the AOC, which is not the
place where this belongs.
Because that is not their
function, and take it out of
the, the agency that has the
expertise.
And has all the as you as you
reflect within this bill.
To give them the authority for
the spending because of their
their influence or not their
influence, but because of their
expertise in Medicaid.
I believe is not the way that we
should be going in our state,
and I'm putting that on the
record, Mr, Mr. uh Chair because
I think that that is not the
direction that our state should
go in when regarding and
rebuilding our behavioral health
system.
And
I really appreciate the funding
that we're going to do in this
bill. This is wholeheartedly
where we need to be.
Um, and with that, I'll I'll end
the discussion about SB 3. I
just wanted this committee to be
aware of that that is what is
happening, that is what the,
what we are, we are looking to
do through this this funding.
Bill that we're, that's in front
of us. My next question, Mr.
Chair, will go to um
Where would we find or where
would there be increases for the
fund.
Um, through our budget process,
Mr. Chair.
If any, Mister Chair.
Mr. Chair Representative Lujan,
could you repeat the question?
So, um, subject to what will be
allocated in funding this year
from um.
The states, is there a plan in
place that we would, we would
increase the funding to this
particular fund in the future,
Mr. Chair. Uh, Mr. Chair,
Representative Lujan, this would
still be left to house
preparations and finance
Committee and the Senate Finance
Committee every year.
To do an appropriation.
Thank you. I would just hope so
that we would, we would increase
that funding if we don't get
what we're asking for, Mr.
Chair, um, because I
wholeheartedly believe that this
is a fund that is really past
due it's time, um.
I would also ask Mr. Chair, Mr.
Chair, that
That the SIC will be doing will
be um
Responsible for um.
Creating the investment um
portfolio for this fund. So
Mr. Chair, if I may, what have
we accounted for that in our
budget so far is, is the
increased duties in.
funding through HB2 as of yet.
Does anybody know that
I haven't seen SB2, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I hope
that that we do look at what the
budget is for the SIC um and
make sure that we are, we are
going to adapt to, um, what
their needs are gonna be, not
just for this, but for other
things that are other
investments that they do because
the return is um as mentioned
in.
And the information here is of
great value, um, Mr. Chair,
that's all I have right now.
Thank you. Great. Thank you very
much for representing Wuhan.
We're gonna go next to Saint
Vincent and Repsaka.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
senators. Mr. Chair, I've been
learning a lot from these
senators the last couple of days
and they've poked his many holes
in my bills, so they're teaching
me how to ask questions, and I
appreciate that. Now is the time
where we we show that's right,
that's right.
That's right. But I like them
both, so that's the way it goes.
So what I'm understanding is
Senate Bill 1.
does not put any money into this
fund.
Right, Mr. Chair. That's
correct. OK.
But as the legislative body, as
the appropriators, we can budget
or we can appropriate.
As much money as we need to in
the behavioral health.
Is that correct?
Mr. Chair.
Uh, Mr. Chair, I'm not sure that
as much as we want to, but we
can appropriate money.
Into any fun that we want, that
we set up. This is setting up a
fund.
Essentially this is just a
Putting a title in the, in the
place.
To put money is what this does,
OK. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and,
you know, I'm one of the new
members on appropriations. I
like money.
I know how to save money. I know
how to spend it as well. And Mr.
Chair, what I'm asking is, and
maybe Adrian can break it down a
little bit easier, but why do we
need the fund?
Mr. Chair.
Well, I'm gonna start, Mr.
Chair, and if it's not enough,
we'll turn to Adrian, but we are
really looking, Mr. Chair,
Representative Vincent to the
future.
Setting up a permanent fund for
the future where we can draw the
interest we means that we will
continue to have services for
all time.
And it is an investment in the
issues in our state, and the
mental health, the behavioral
health, the substance use, it
helps address some of the crime,
some of the other problems of
our society, and so it's a
forward looking uh tool to use.
But if you want really specifics
about how it would break down, I
would turn to Adrian
and I appreciate that answer and
that did help me a little bit,
and Adrian, you could probably
help me out.
a little bit more, so.
How do we get a billion dollars
into a fund.
Without getting into our
reserves.
There's multiple ways to do it,
uh, Mr. Chair. One of the
options, for example, every year
there are reversions.
Why not have the reversions just
flow into a font that then will
build interest and compound, and
then suddenly you have a new
revenue stream from money that
wasn't spent by an agency.
You have another option, one of
the most volatile revenue
sources that the general fund
has right now is the interest
earned of money that's sitting
there at the treasury.
Right, you all know there's $6
billion in capital outlay.
That's appropriate. It's like
that's earning interest
overnight, you know, basic
savings account.
Those revenue sources are
unaccounted for. It's like,
that's money that you could put
in here that then can go into
the market and get 5 to 7.2, you
know, potentially 12% in some
funds, uh, return, right? So
it's a way to ensure that
today's money, now that we have,
you know, oil and gas revenues
through the roof, taking the
day's money and investing it
into the future. I want you to
go back real quick to like the
60s and 50s.
When, you know, everyone's
predecessors who's who's here
right now. They decided that oil
and gas money should go and fund
public schools.
Right? Money from the state land
office when royalties and, you
know, selling leases and things
like that, that should go and be
saved and put into the market.
They could have spent it all
back then.
Right? It would have only been a
few million back then.
But now look at the billions of
dollars that we have in
investment income.
The state is on a trajectory
right now, where investment
income.
Will match and surpass in a few
years.
The amount of revenue that we
get from oil and gas.
But that's only if you all
continue to make the decisions
that you've made over the past
few years of creating trust
funds like these, where you take
today's money, put it into the
market, and instead of in the
future having to raise taxes.
You just live off the investment
income from your wise decisions
today.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And what
was that number? How much, what
was the reversions? What was
that reversion number?
Sorry, there and thank you
Representative Vincent. I think
there's 2 questions. If you
could give us sort of the FY 24
of versions separately, there is
unspent capital outlay. I think
there's you, uh,
chief of staff, you mentioned a
few different sort potential
sources. I think the
representative is asking if you
could go back through those with
sort of the amounts.
There, please.
Uh, Mr. Cha, off the top of my
head, I do remember the capital
outlay number cause I was
looking at that one earlier
today, and um that number of the
amount that's anticipated to
revert here at the end of June
this year from Capital Outlay.
And this is funding where they
have spent either 0%.
Or 1%.
So it's things that haven't
moved at all for 4 years plus.
Right? That number, if I'm not
mistaken, was at 130 million.
So I mean, you take things like
that and you can piecemeal
together a billion dollars
relatively quickly over the next
few years.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Ari. I appreciate that. Thank
you very much, Representative
Vincent, uh, Representative
Baca.
Next please.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you for your presentation.
Um, Mr. Chairman and senators,
what is our current cash
reserves right now, what is the
percentage?
That we have now.
Uh,
go ahead, Mr. Chair, uh, I
believe from your guys'
framework, but you adopted
within House Bill 2, you're
coming in for FY 26 at 31%.
31 and change. It's like 31.3.
I think he was chairman, and
then, you know, kind of question
that was kind of asked, and I
just want to make sure that I
heard it is based upon the
Estimated revenue for this year.
And the money that has been
allocated through House Bill 2,
Mr. Chair, do we have a deficit?
In that revenue projection as
opposed to what has
Currently contained in house
bill or House Bill 2.
I think there was an amount that
was, was shared. I'm not sure if
I was able to, if I, if I wrote
it down correctly.
Um, Mr. Chair, I'm sorry, could
you repeat the question? Yeah,
so, so um
Mr. Chairman and
When we're talking about is, we
talked about, you know, the work
that we've kind of done with
Senate bill.
I was with House Bill 2.
But we're what we always look
about is the revenue
projections. So my question, Mr.
Chairman, and Adrian.
is based upon the revenue
projections.
And send in House Bill 2 in its
current form, is there a
deficit, um, in that.
Uh, Mr. Chair, I don't believe
so. The consensus revenue
estimate, uh, decided to stick
with their December estimate
because there's not enough
changes.
Uh, within the market and other
factors that they take into
account to.
You know, reduce the estimate.
So as of right now there is no
deficit.
Thank you, um, Mr. Chairman, and
thank you for that. Um,
And Mr. Chair, Mr. Chairman and
uh senators, um.
The other portion and it was
also an
The location of this trust
funder who has oversight. I do
understand us as appropriators,
but the, the courts, I mean, and
uh Mr. Chairman, senators, why,
why they're, why not in some of
the other.
Why not just our, our, you know,
our healthcare authorities or
white in some of our other why,
why we placing that trust under
that agency.
Um, Mr. Chair, it's actually
placed within the healthcare
authority.
So Senate Bill 2, which is a
different bill making
appropriations, just has two
appropriations going to the
courts, and I think we're mixing
the two ideas. The trust itself
is at the healthcare authority,
and I'll point you to section 2.
And uh third sentence, the
healthcare authority shall
administer the fund.
Right. Nowhere in the pill is
there any mention of the courts.
Uh, and thank you, Mr. Chairman
and thank you for the answer. I,
I just, you know, as we, um,
I think that we all are in
agreement about the the need for
support in this area. Uh, how
many, you know, I just
Um, I just wanted to make sure
that just like with everything
else, Mr. Chairman and senators
that we are living within our
means, if you will, and I think
that's an important part about
it because the money that we
have today, um, we have to be
good towards that because as
other um
If we have a change in revenue.
From, uh, you know, certain, uh,
industry, if you will, that will
make it very difficult and so I
just want to make sure just like
with everyone else that we
talked about Mr. Chairman, about
being fiscally responsible.
And I just want to make sure
that we, by doing this are not
unintentionally causing us
issues down the road, you know,
10 or 15 years. So thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you very much, uh,
Representative Baca. Uh, there's
boundaries.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Uh, sponsors I am a really,
really big advocate for
behavioral health.
It is a problem in my district
and has been for a long time and
I know it's statewide as well,
but Mr. Chairman and our
senators.
To me this is like telling one
of my children, I'm gonna set up
a trust fund for you.
And then I don't put any money
in it.
I said, well, maybe I'll tuck a
little here and there as I can,
but
I think this should be such a
priority that we actually put a
billion dollars in to start the
fund.
And until we do that, I think
we're a little bit premature.
Thank you.
Great, uh thank you very much.
um Representative Brown. Uh, OK,
uh, representative Pettigrew
asked for another question, so
we'll go back to represent
Pettigrew.
Thank you, Chairman, and I
committed to only doing one and
uh with some of the commentary
that's happened, I'm gonna have
to change my question to hold to
that commitment.
Mr. Chair and Adrian.
You talked about specifically
about the way that we're
investing, and if we continue on
the track that we're going.
We'll be able to offset.
Oil and gas revenue within a few
years.
Chairman and
Adrian
Right now, if I understand that
our state investment council is
Overseeing somewhere around.
50+ billion dollars.
And Chairman and Adrian with
respect to all the changes that
we've made in recent changes
from house bill to a year or so
back and
Senate Bill 26, Senate Bill 378.
Every redefinition of new money,
all these different things,
chairman.
And Adrian.
Please explain to me.
Cause I, I can do the math, the
math's pretty simple equation.
We need to be somewhere more
state Investment council needs
to be somewhere north of
managing over $160 billion a
year.
Plus
To match
Oil and gas revenue.
Please tell me.
experiment
And put it in context, please.
With the goals
Uh, the first phase of the ETA.
Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Chair, so let me uh
clarify my, my statements. Um,
it's the amount of money that
would flow into the general
fund. So obviously the amount
that's generated by oil and gas,
it flows into many different
pockets within government.
The amount that goes directly
into general fund.
That level is the level that
we'll be able to match.
Dollar for dollar with
investments. So it's not the
full 150, it's, it's lower. Um,
and then,
I'm sorry, could you clarify
what you meant, Mr. Chair, uh
representative with ETA
chairman, um.
I'm gonna, I appreciate your
answer, Adrian, and you answered
a piece of that that was the
relative piece because at the
end of the day, we're looking at
a trust fund.
And I was trying to get to the
math equation and the statement
that, that I heard.
And what you just corrected for
me, helped me get there on my
own.
I appreciate you giving me a
little bit of latitude cause
it's way outside the bounds that
helped me bring the math back
together. I think I'm gonna
agree to disagree. We're gonna
have to have a different
conversation offline. Thank you.
Thank you, Representative
Pettigrew. OK, members, thank
you for really good questions.
Uh, I want to thank the
senators, um, I'm gonna ask, so
just I think kind of bringing it
together for, for us. The health
this fund, senators is going to
live, um, it'll be a new trust
fund.
Uh, the, at the healthcare
authority.
It's at the state, Mr. Chair
State Investment council.
Uh, with the healthcare
authority sort of overseeing
that.
Uh, the healthcare authority
would be receiving the
percentage, uh,
Every year.
With it and that's the
behavioral health program fund,
that's the fund that's meant to
Senator. That's the fun that
sort of every year is going to
uh take the money that's the
interest earned as well as 5% of
the corpus, and every year, um,
dedicate that across the variety
of programs that are outlined in
Senate Bill 3, and many of which
are included in our house bill
too at initial funding amounts.
That's correct. OK.
And
You've worked, senators, you've
worked closely. I see Secretary
R Miho in here, Secretary de
Blasi, there's been a great deal
of work with those two with the
executive on this.
Uh yes. Uh, I don't know that
they've identified an amount of
money, so I can't speak to that
and maybe Senator Woods could, I
think it's more just sort of
seeing that that there's no
we're just creating the fund
right now. Um,
Secondly, um,
OK. So, and, and we're not,
there's no money going into the
fund. We're not sending any
money on HB2 this our Senate
colleagues, Chairman Yos will be
looking at the bill, uh, but
right now we're not sending any
money into this fund, it's not
set up yet, although it could be
here relatively soon.
Um, should, should we pass? Um,
OK. Uh, I think I'll just do a
couple of clarifying things and
members, um, the budget that
we're sending over to the Senate
will have 31.2% reserves. This
is our general fund financial
summary, um, were below the 6%
spending target recurring that
we've set in LFC that we've
adopted here, and so we're, I
think, you know, good questions
and and concerns about spending.
It's something that we've uh
been mindful of and held to, for
sure. And obviously, none of
whatever goes into this fund
won't be counted as recurring
spending. So, um, we're working
very hard at that 6% target. I
know the chairman is will be on
their side as well.
OK, I don't have any other
questions. We'll go to the vice
chair for emotion.
Mr. Chair, I would move a due
pass on Senate Bill 1 is
amended?
There's a motion.
Second,
uh, it's been seconded by
Representative Herrera. Is there
any opposition to that motion?
OK. Um, let's, uh, let's go
ahead and just briefly call the
roll for this one, please.
Representative Baca.
That's a yes vote,
Representative Brown.
Uh, I'm gonna vote no and I'd
like to explain my vote very
briefly.
Representative Chatfield,
Representative Dell.
No, and I'd like to explain my
vote. Representative Duncan.
No.
Representative Garrett,
Representative Hernandez.
Yes, I'd like to explain my
vote.
Representative Herndon, yes.
Representative Hereta,
Representative Little.
Representative Lujan.
Yes. Representative Pettigrew.
No.
Representative Sanchez.
Representative Sareana
Representative Silva. Yes.
Representative Vincent? No.
Vice Chair Dixon.
She's small.
Uh, we're gonna go to
representative Brown,
Representative Dow, and then
represent Hernandez for a brief
explanations.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So I'll
reiterate the sponsors that I
believe we have a huge problem
and we do need to do something
about it.
But I'm looking at precedent. I
have tried 3 years in a row now,
Mr. Chair, to get a
transportation trust fund
established.
And I had been tabled every time
because of lack of an
appropriation.
So I'm just trying to be
consistent with the rules as I
understand them, and Mr. Chair,
if we could do this.
type of bill, we could create
1000 trust funds and never fund
one of them, or very few of
them, and so I think in some
ways this is not uh a good
precedent, but again, I do
believe we have a huge problem
to solve. Thank you. Thank you,
Representative Dow, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I too
believe that, you know, this is
a very, very well-intentioned.
Um, I think my freshman year, we
had less than 100 funds. Now
we're over 200. We keep creating
funds, um, I've noticed that
some bills that some fun
creation.
when there's no appropriation,
skips the appropriation
committee. I appreciate that
this came here and then I also
see that later when the bill
doesn't pass, it was in House
Bill 2. Well, it was in House
Bill 2, now we're making it
recurring and I mean, I'm still
trying to figure out this
process of transparency and
accountability to the public. In
addition, it feels like the next
couple of bills we're going to
hear. It's a foregone conclusion
of how this is going to be
appropriated and I have concerns
about that. Um, I absolutely, I
believe.
We need it and I think we have
the money to do it out of the
general fund. If it's 200
million a year, fund it 200
million a year. Thank you. Thank
you, Representative Hernandez,
please. Thank, thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Um, uh, senators, uh,
I'm a former behavioral health
worker. So I just first want to
say thank you for carrying this
bill. Uh, my, my only concern is
the use of capital outlay
reversion, so I just want to
state that for the record, um,
especially with the Navajo
Nation, uh, communities that,
uh.
Depend on this. Thank you. Thank
you. OK, uh, senators, thank you
very much for the work. Thank
you for uh the questions. We're
gonna uh go to Chair Munoz now.
This is Senate bill to members.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee.
staff can we announce the vote,
please?
Yes, the vote came to 12 members
in favor.
5 against.
Mr. Chair.
Can ask a question before we go
to the next bill.
Sure. Could we just get the,
there's Cinopil 1, Cenil 2 and
Senate Bill 3, and we just have
explain what each is and how
they interlate just real briefly
because I had a question on 2,
but I see now that I, it's
answered in 3. Great. Yeah. So
what what we're gonna do members
we're taking up Senate Bill 2 at
the request of the sponsors, uh,
as an explanation. We're not
gonna be voting on this bill.
This is to provide
more context that helps
illustrate some of the work that
we've done uh through our
budgeting work. So, um, in
answer to your question, I said
Garrett, we'll ask the sponsors
and chair Munoz to give a bit of
that overview, um, and again,
just as clarity, we're, we're
not gonna be voting on this uh
Senate bill to we are though
gonna discuss it at the request
of the sponsors. I think it
makes good sense.
So, thank you, Mr. Chair. Senate
Bill 1, it sets up the structure
for the trust fund, just like
the early childhood trust fund
when we only put 350 million in
there and diverted some oil
revenues to that. We saw that
fund grow to to it's gonna grow
to 11 billion in the next year.
And so we saw that fund grow.
This is a basis for almost every
other fund.
Early childhood trust fund has 2
appropriations are too earmarks
that go into that trust fund
that make it grow so much and
because oil and gas have shot up
over the last 4 years. That's
why we've seen that fund grow so
much. As we look at Senate Bill
1, we'll figure out a revenue
stream to fund that. We'll
figure out how to put money in
there and then we'll kind of
move forward. It, it may only be
a 1 or 2 year plan to try to get
money in there, but we will
appropriate money this year into
into Senate Bill 1.
Cin belt 2 is
It is the funding portion and it
decides who gets funding, how
the funding is held, uh, we'll
go over that in just a minute.
Senate Bill 3 is the guardrails.
It tells every agency and and
the courts, the healthcare
authority, uh, Department of
Health, um.
trying to think who else is
involved with the University of
New Mexico Department of Public
Safety, DFA. It tells them how
that bill's gonna operate.
How the, how the regional plans
are gonna come together. Who's
gonna operate the readers'
regional plans, who's gonna have
input in the regional plans, uh,
how the regional plans are going
to be determined, that's all in
Senate Bill 3.
So as we look at these 3 bills,
I mean, this, this is an
innovative approach and Adrian
uh went to Miami and looked at
the Miami model, we looked at
the Houston model. We talked to
everybody across.
The state, I think we spend
maybe 8 hours on Zoom dealing
with behavioral health from
Carlsbad and and the people in
Carl's bed to the people in
Farmington, uh, Gallup.
Gallop is kind of the same as
Santa Fe. They have the same
operator but a different market.
So we, we pulled all those
together and, and said, how does
it function and how, how do
these three bills really need to
play into each other and how do
we need to fund them, and how do
we need to fund them correctly.
Uh, we pulled in the courts
during the special session we
appropriated money to the courts
to do uh a sequential intercept
mapping which gets everybody
that's headed to jail, uh, on a
mapping plan so that they can
deal with that. The courts has
agreed in
And everybody's, I think, in
agreement. We hope.
Uh, from what we know they are
all work together with locals.
Whether it's the Carl's bed, I
can't remember the name of the
one in Carl's bed, the guy with
the beard, but uh, yeah, and so
we've met with him several times
to Farmington and how their
behavioral health system works
and what their needs are because
because farming tent to Gallop
is completely different beaver
held me. We have no beds, we
have nothing. We have to ship
everything out or we have to
hold them in jails. Uh, it's
different than Carl's red
because they have treatment,
they, they needed a quick
reaction for payment. And so we,
we gathered that up and, and
built that into Senate Bill 3.
3. And then we said, what is it
gonna take to operate this, this
idea or this innovative way that
we're gonna operate this, these
behavioral health systems.
And, and came to the conclusion
and drafted these bills, and
they got amended a lot in the
Senate with a lot of input from
the executive agency, uh, who
agreed to get rid of uh the
behavioral health collaborative.
Uh, that was the executive's
request.
Um
And so
There's a lot of planning, uh,
Adrian spent time with the
governor. We're going through
this, so we knew that the exec
was on board, uh, and, and knew
what her comments were on the
structure, so it has been well
vetted, uh.
We think it's been well vetted.
We don't know who we don't know
hasn't had their input in, but
we've tried our best to
accommodate everybody. So what
Senate Bill 2 does and, and my
co-sponsors here, Senator Shindo
is the main sponsor and Senator
Lagos is on thereenindo and and
with me, Senator Bill 2 is
making an appropriation. It
addresses community needs in a
broad range of services,
including planning.
The version, outpatient,
inpatient, crisis response,
mobile units, behavioral health
care, education.
Homelessness, correction,
discharge, equipment and
vehicles and housing.
Uh, eligible entities to receive
funding are state agencies,
local governments, tribe, and
federally qualified health
centers.
Uh, with that, Mr. Chair, I'll
turn it over. I did send a copy
of this sheet, the funding sheet
out so people can look at how
funding is scheduled.
We think that we don't know what
the numbers are coming out here,
hopefully we, we designed it to
succeed and we'll see what
happens when it comes out here,
uh, and so with that I'll turn
it over to my uh co-sponsor.
Thank you, Mr. Tarrant. Thank
you, Representatives. Glad to be
back in this side of the
Capitol, uh, do want to, uh,
just give you some information,
the way the bill's laid out.
Sections 1 through 13 are
already captured and House Bill
2.
Uh sections 14 through 23, I
have a total of 60 million, and
they are yet to be dealt with,
uh, but in each one of these
sections, it tells you who it's
going to and for the cost and uh
uh for instance in one,
administrative offices of
courts. It's for regional
planning statewide resource
mapping, and it comes out to
$1.7 million so we've tried to
lay it out as well as we could,
um, glad that Adrian's here
because he's see.
The brainchild of this, but I
think that it's gonna give us an
opportunity to set in motion
right now, not years from now,
how we resolve this behavioral
health issue.
Great. Thank you very much,
Chairman Munoz. Uh, thank you,
Senator Gallegos, um, good to
see you, uh, Vice Chair Sendo.
Yeah, anything to add, again, so
members um were the FIR talks
about some of the, the, the 3
bills, Senate Bill 1, which we
just acted upon, Senate Bill 2,
which we're taking up.
For discussion purposes and then
Senate Bill 3, which is
mentioned in the FIR which is in
the, the health committee. Um,
any questions on Senate Bill 2,
starting with Representative Do
please. Thank you, Mr. Chair,
and thank you, Senators. Uh, hi,
Senator Shindo. Um, OK, so I, I
haven't heard this before, and
so I'm wondering on.
How does this
I see the money that's going to
each division. It's going first
to the healthcare authority,
correct?
It goes the healthcare authority
first and then
Uh, all that because there's a
schedule that need to happen.
And and so.
81 Adrian answer so, so the way,
go ahead, Adrian. So Mr. Chair,
Representative down, um, the
money, these are direct
appropriations. So where you see
money going to AOC, it's going
directly to AOC. There's no pass
through.
Um
That was with the trust fund.
That was a whole different
animal. OK, thank you, Mr.
Chair. So my question is,
I guess my question is why?
Because we, if we want to
leverage Medicaid Medicare
dollars. If we're giving a
direct appropriation, we're
choosing not to bill for
Medicaid. We're choosing just to
forego any federal match for
this particular fund.
Uh, Mr. Chair, so there are
certain things that Medicaid
just won't cover.
Right. So regional planning,
Medicaid does not cover that.
They, it's very much service,
direct service. So, um,
All of these, ideally, and when
you see Senate Bill 3, their
specific language in there that
says every region has to
optimize, leverage, do
everything possible to access
Medicaid. And then if Medicaid
can't be used because of federal
rules or because we don't have a
Medicaid waiver for a certain
type of service, then, OK, you
know, you can tap into one of
these buckets as well, you know,
but it's, it's as flexible as
possible to really capture the
full scope of the needs of
behavioral health for the state.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I'm
thinking this is way more
globally, um, where we are
really pushing people towards
evidence based in in ways that I
don't even agree with, um, you
know, Herrera and I say, like,
why are we making home visiting
the evidence-based, and the
answer is we must draw down
funding. So why is this one? Why
is some another program which is
prevention, intervention.
What, what is the, what is the
thought process beside by
foregoing.
billable units or so it's
flexibility.
Uh, Mr. Chair, it's flexibility,
but more than anything, it's, we
need to build up the
infrastructure, right? You can't
bill if the provider hasn't been
hired and you haven't put them
on payroll, right? You can't
bill if you don't have the bed.
Right. So that's gonna be it.
That, that goes to my next
question. Do we have the
clinicians to do this and why
this versus building a
workforce, you know, it depends
on the area and Hobbs that they
have all the clinicians they
need, they just need other
resources to help them succeed,
right? In Farmington, they also
have the beds, but they they're
shorter clinicians in Hobbs and
in that area, they're building
the $60 million center, and
they're attracting the
clinicians, but what can, what
help can we give them? Well it's
different in every region. I
mean, we have
No behavioral healthcare in
Gallup or grains. Only thing we
have is emergency services
crisis response team in grants,
who goes out on the reservation
from Rama Pine Hill to Oisibola,
Laguna Akima, and if there's
something that happens, they
have to haul him into
Albuquerque, so they don't have
a facility and they don't have
the healthcare providers to, to
do that. Now, could they build a
facility? Yes, but there's no
funding for building because we
want this stood up as quickly as
possible. If you gotta go lease
a building, go
of building, right, you gotta go
buy equipment for your building,
go buy equipment, you need to
turn on the lights, go turn on
the lights, but stand this up
and make it work regionally, and
then let's see what actually
you're gonna need to make the
system grow and really work. OK,
thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, Senator, for that. And what
if you have a vacant building
that needs to be remodeled.
Well, there's money for that,
you can that can apply for a
vacant building to lease a
building and remodel it because
you have to have the
infrastructure in place before
you can get to then these other
points. And so Mr. Chair and
Senator, when you talk about
regional, it's like, so Demming
could have one separate from
from grant separate from Sierra.
So the regionalization model
came through because of the way
the judiciaries are set up and
because the judiciary ran the uh
sequential intercept mapping. He
already did it in Santa Fe and
Rio.
In Los Alamos counties in this
north. So they know what the
targets are. They all went to
this meeting and they said, all
right, what are the things that
we need in these three regions
in this, in this judicial
district. They were given
post-its, they write them all
down, and then they came back
and said, OK, pick 5 things from
this that you can, that, that
you think we can accomplish
within the year and with the
money we have, and they were all
given votes with little dots on
them and they voted on the 5
things that they think they
could accomplish and and that's.
started operational last month.
2 weeks 2 weeks ago and so they
in the 4 month period, they've
managed to figure out how
they're gonna handle where the
shortages.
On behavioral health needs in
Rio Riba is completely different
than.
In Santa. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I'm still processing. Thank you
so much for doing this
presentation, and I would love
to see.
Any of the interim work or any
of those.
Those, any of the documents that
I can review before we take a
vote. Great. Thank you very much
for presenting down, uh, we're
gonna go next to Representative
Silva, then Representative
Garrett.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh, thank
you, senators. I appreciate the
report. Um, I have a couple of
questions. Um,
Just bringing up a couple of
issues in the FIR. I'm
wondering, um,
On administrative implications.
It says leveraging federal
Medicaid matching funds takes
months of negotiation with CMS.
And it may not be possible to
leverage all possible federal
dollars by June 30th, 26. Do we
have an estimate of how much
what the range of money we could
match between um
Passage of this bill and June
30th, 2026. So. Well, the
secretary of the Healthcare
Authority, Mr. Chair, is here
and he could possibly answer
that, but just to give an
initial stab at this, um,
You won't know what services are
needed in a region until they do
their regional plans.
Right. And you'll have regional
plans that might be done really
quickly. There might be a few
stragglers here and there, but
that's why the courts are there
cause they have a stable
presence throughout the whole
state.
Um, to help them facilitate
coming together.
And, you know, just being and
getting everyone in the room.
But in terms of leveraging
Medicaid, if they identify a
certain service.
In Senate Bill 3, the healthcare
authority is gonna provide.
Every region in the courts, it's
like, OK, from our gaps analysis
that they've been doing.
These are the things that you
all might want to focus on. Here
are the standards of what's
billable for Medicaid, so you
know, going in, you can make an
informed decision.
And then at the same time, if
something isn't billable for
Medicaid?
Here are guidelines, evaluation
metrics, other performance
targets for you to be able to
ensure you design it in a way
that maybe one day, it could be
eligible for Medicaid.
Right? So we're trying to set up
the region for that success. Um,
Uh, the Secretary or me who
would like to add anything.
Um, Mr. Chair, um,
Representative Silva, um, I
think that was really accurate
answer, um, I think a lot will
depend on what comes in through
the plans, um, obviously
Medicaid reimbursement uh for
direct services would be the
goal, uh, and that's really the
primary avenue. There are some
other ways that Medicaid can
support certain administrative
activities, we would be looking
really hard to make sure that uh
we are able to leverage Medicaid
Match whenever.
possible. That's always a goal
of our agency to optimize every
single state general fund
dollar. It's really hard to
answer the question without
knowing exactly what services
would be supported, um, but I
would imagine that, uh, we would
be able to stretch these dollars
pretty far. However, uh, there
are limitations on what we can
match in terms of
infrastructure, um, so I just
wanna make sure that we're
working off the same set of
expectations there, uh, can't,
uh, do a full match on. Thank
you. And Mr. Chair, if I could
point you out in
The bill, page 6 and 7, section
8.
Uh, basically line 25 through
line 3.
We've incorporated language
within the appropriations and
with Senate Bill 3 that.
Even though money's eligible for
non-medicaid stuff. If we know a
Medicaid program exists for
delivery.
And an entity just needs to do a
few tweaks in their current
model to be eligible for
Medicaid.
We're encouraging them to shift
in that direction and get them
the funding for, you know, the
specific type of vehicle that
could then qualify for.
Medicaid service, right? So
we're, we're pushing them in
that direction.
Great. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and
um
Uh, senators and so I have 2
more questions. The, uh, there's
an emergency clause for SB 3 but
not for SB 2. Can you explain
the discrepancy or the reasoning
behind that. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Senate
Senate Bill 3 is enabling
legislation, so it needs
emergency clause to get enacted.
Uh, it has money in it and, and
Senate bill 2 will be booked
through House Bill 2.
So it will be available. Great.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and then
finally, um, section 4 in the
bill, um, states that
I go to section 4.
That all clinics should be in
the municipality with a state
institution of higher education,
and the one the FIR says that
this needs clarification. It
might leave out institutions
like Donanaa Community College,
for example, in uh in my
district, I have 3 of those, um,
but also if clinics are in the
municipality. What about clinics
that are in unincorporated parts
of New Mexico. How does that
fit in with the regional
planning. Can you just help me
um understand that a little bit
better. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
So, Mr. Chair, Section 4 is for
facilities, right? To be able to
like really get that
infrastructure off the ground,
and the initial thought is focus
on a hub and spoke model, right?
Community colleges, branch
campuses, or your institutions.
They're located in more urban
areas where you can address the
workforce and have more of a
pipeline to fill these jobs. So
if you're gonna invest in
infrastructure, you need the
heavy infrastructure in those
type of areas. And then do from
there mobile units to hit the
more rural areas, right? To
start things off. Now, it's up
to the region to decide. Now
that specific language in
section 4 very much is limited
to that bucket. So if you want
to access that bucket, it had
that language, but I believe the
way you all passed it within
hospital 2, you removed that.
stipulation.
Uh, OK. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you very much
Representative Silva. Next, we
have Representative Garrett.
Thanks, Mr. Chair. I want to
thank you. I now understand
whatsequential intercept
resource mappings, which I did
not know an hour ago, so thank
you. Uh, practical question,
regional planning, are those the
13 judicial districts.
We're talking about.
Yes
Thank you. Um, and then my other
question is,
So Senate Bill 3 is going
through our committee process
now on the health side, not 2,
but 3.
Is that correct?
OK. And this spill is already
Mr. Chair.
Completely in house bill 2 or
are there parts that aren't bill
has been addressed in House Bill
2 as we're passing it out. I'll
have some questions that
illustrate, um, but it's been
done in close collaboration,
collaboration and consultation.
Although not word for word.
Thank you. That's my only
questions. Great questions. Uh,
we're gonna go next to
Representative Pettigrew, then
Representative Brown. Thank you,
Chairman and thank you, senators
for the presentation.
my first question, uh.
This is
Directed the
Senator Munoz, with respect to
the facility in Hobbs.
I just like for him to readdress
what he said to the committee to
I can verify a few things.
Well, uh, Mayor Sam Cobb, and I
had a long conversations about
behavioral issues and what he's
trying to accomplish with the
Miami model in Hobbs. That's a
$60 million facility, if I
remember it correctly.
Uh, but the mayor did, we were,
we did consult the mayor. Uh, he
said he was fine with the plan,
he, he's been tracking it and
his lobby has been tracking. I
can't remember whose lobbyist
is, um, but they've been
tracking what's happening in in
they seem to be in unison with
us.
Thank you, Chairman and thank
you, Senator. I'm very well
aware of what what the plans are
in Lee County with respect to
that. It's not a $60 million
facility, and it's very specific
in its focus.
experiment that's all I have.
Great. Thank you very much,
Representative Pettigrew. Next,
we have Representative Brown,
then represent Luhan.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and um
so here's Sheo Munoz and
Gallegos, so I guess that's the
caucus.
Mr. Chairman, I, I know we're
not going to vote on this bill
today, but I really like this
bill.
It shows a lot of forethought, a
lot of planning, taking into
account what was learned on some
of the field trips, uh, to, to
explore these models and um what
I really like too is, Mr. Chair,
the, uh, that we're engaging a
lot of state agencies to try to
deal with this problem. I think
the regional approach is the
right one, and as was stated,
Mr. Chair, um,
Every
Partner of the state's a little
bit different and um the, the
needs we have are different from
what you might find in
Albuquerque, for example, down
in the southeast corner. So I
just wanna say, um,
This is really good.
And um
It's my understanding, and
here's a question, Mr. Chair.
Uh, so to bundle the cost of all
the things identified in Senate
Bill 2 would be is it $92
million Mr. Chair.
Um, Mr. Chair and Senator, when
we started on this path, we, we
all gathered in leadership and I
gathered and represented small
and, and we didn't know what
we're gonna need, right? We,
well we didn't know is what we
don't know, right?
And so we said, what is a crime
package gonna take, what is
behavioral health gonna take,
right? How do we make that jet
balance and adjustment and what
that is. I mean, we've looked
across the board and we, we've
set our target number at 140 and
because of comments by agencies
and everything else, we've
increased it up to the 200
maximum, we don't know where you
are at currently, but one thing
we don't want to do is leave
somebody short, you know how
that goes, you get home and say,
oh, yeah, I need another $2
million to finish this project
or to do this, right? And so,
We, we don't know.
It's a learning lesson. It's
innovative. Nobody's done it
before. It's hard to figure out
what exactly you're gonna need
because we don't know what the
needs are gonna be in Carlsbad.
We don't, we think we know, but
we don't know, but once they do
their planning, then we're gonna
know it.
You know, there's never always
never enough money, that's all.
We've done our best to try to
account for what we think the
costs are. Uh, we've had a long
conversation with the.
I don't know where the other
secretary went, but there was
two of them there. She's over
there now and long consultations
with them and, and even them
coming in and this says
something about cabinet
secretaries and meeting with
Adrian at 7 in the morning,
right? Till like 9:30 trying to
get this done when we had quiet
time and, and we can focus.
And so there's been a lot of
consultation and a lot of
numbers to, to kind of crunch
about.
We think it's right, but we hope
it's right, but it will get it
stood up.
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman
and uh thank you for that, and
again, good job. I'm impressed.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for Brown.
Uh, next we're gonna go to
Representative Lujan and then
Representative Her Hernandez.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. My first
question, Mr. Chair, is
Was the chair of
Um, Health and Human Services.
Consulted in in the drafting of
this legislation.
Mr. Chair in uh I don't believe
they were drafted, they were
informed as a bill kind of moved
along, um, but they weren't
consulted in the drafting.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, would
you say that the reason why we
have the Committee for Health
and Human Services is because
they have formed and put
together.
A committee of those that have
the background and expertise in
longevity and working on these
issues, Mr. Chair.
Um, Mr. Chan and Representative,
uh, Senate Bill 3 passed
unanimously from that committee
this morning. So this is the
guardrails, this is the money
portion. I mean, that's the
guardrails. This is the money
portion. So they were well
informed of the guardrails. Uh,
there was very few amendments
made over there.
Uh, so they seem to be in
agreement with us. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Would you say that,
can you, can you identify those
guardrails, please? Uh, we're
discussing Senate bill 2 right
now, and Bill 3 is in health.
Um, we can send you over all the
guardrails and a copy of the
bill so we can do that.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have
been studying that bill as well.
I don't believe that there are
many guard rails as we should
have in that bill. I feel like
we are focused on um.
We are focused on an agency, the
AOC, when this is not their
mission.
And changing their mission.
Regarding behavioral health.
And
If I made the mission of the AOC
is
Hang on just one moment here.
The administration office of the
courts exists to enable the
courts of New Mexico to
accomplish the mission through
ensuring that the courts have
adequate equitable.
Equit be equitable distributed
resources, ensuring that the
courts have in use current
technology, providing a fair and
equitable statewide human
resource system, developing and
implementing improved court
processes and supporting courts
in their use, collecting and
providing information on.
On and for the courts, ensuring
Mr. Chair,
um, excuse me, and I, I.
I want to apologize, but I have
a lot of concerns of how we are
restructuring the AOC to do.
And I'll get to the budget part
of this if you will, to do what
we already have agencies to do,
and I'm wondering how this is
going to affect those budgets
for HCA for DOH and DFA in their
recurring budgets, if we're
going to implement.
All the, the resources and
everything into the AOC, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative. Well, the AOC,
your mission they just read is,
is new diversions and new, new,
uh, new ways to handle uh the
judiciary system. When we have
someone that's arrested 567
times with the competency bill,
I think you guys have heard,
haven't heard on the floor.
Yeah, it's crossed over.
I mean, these are companion
bills they're gonna work in
unison. The courts are the first
interceptor, sequential mapping
tells you who, who the problem
children are in the court system
and what services they're going
to need.
But if you can tell me, have we
spent 800, um, about 900 million
I think Ruby ends right around
$900 million in behavioral
health money matched with
Medicaid, on track to spend $1.1
billion this year, and have we
moved the needle?
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Senator, for, for bringing that
population um into the
discussion, you know how big
that population is, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair and Representative,
no.
Adrian, do you know how
With the population is that very
small of that of that
demographic that we're
discussing, Mr. Chair, that
specific demographic that
interacts with the criminal
justice system that is in need
of uh mental health services is
less than 5% of the. Thank you.
And,
It's a very small population to
chair, but they are repeat
offenders, and I would
wholeheartedly agree with you
that we need to be.
We need to address what is going
on there, however, to
redistribute.
All this, this funding to this
one agency where this is small
population of what they deal
with.
And take it away from the
agencies that are doing all the
work that have the expertise,
and I understand that we have
put a a.
Well, over a billion dollars
into our current.
Budgets and we're looking to do
that again in this budget.
Gives me great pause, Mister,
Mister Chair, I don't think we
have the correct all the
guardrails that we could
possibly have to oversee this
type of budget. I agree with you
there are, there are
inadequacies, there are issues,
however,
Doing this, I
I would assume it's gonna take a
lot of responsibility or a lot
of.
Administration efforts from the
current agencies, state
agencies, and putting those
responsibilities.
And to
The AOC, which this is not their
purview, Mister Chair.
Can you respond to that?
I, I'm in consultations with
with the uh.
Judicial branch.
In the Chief Justice.
Um, they've agreed to do this.
They've agreed that they can
handle it um during the special
session, that money was
appropriated. Uh, they've
agreed, they ran that program
and so they've agreed to do
this, uh, we're all in this
together. This is the first time
you're gonna see all three
branches of government actually
functioning together to
accomplish something, you have
the, the judicial executive and
the legislative. And when you
have that, I don't know how
you're gonna fail when all three
branches are gonna have
accountability.
And in tracking, um, the
judicial branch has agreed to
it, I can't tell you if it's.
They agreed to it, and so they
said they're gonna do it and the
Chief Justice is uh indicated
that they're going to make every
effort to see this.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, I
understand that there could,
there could be alliances that we
can build and we can strengthen
those alliances, and I
wholeheartedly believe in that
statement that you're saying.
However, where we are and where
our responsibility is as
legislators and overseeing our
budgets and what this means for
them, I feel like this is going
to affect.
Certain agencies recurring
budgets because now we are going
to be putting the
responsibility.
Of what the current agencies or
state agencies doing and
creating a whole new state
agency at DOC, where this is not
their purview.
And I, I
I'm very concerned about that,
Mr. Chair, I would say in the
significant initiative in
section 2 specifies the
administrative office of the
courts will receive $7 million.
The allocation is supposed to be
divided into two types of
grants, with the first focusing
on enhancing regional case
management, behavioral health
grant writing, peer operated
crisis response and recovery
support services and behavioral
health and homeless outreach and
engagement.
Improvements in regional case
management is needed because the
clearance rate for a court cases
across the state is below 100%.
Obviously we talked about that.
We are
backlogged, but that is not due
to that doesn't for me.
Reflects what this bill and what
we're trying to do here, and
I'll continue, Mr. Chair.
Moreover, Section 4 focuses on
creating regional transitional
acute care facilities and
certified community behavioral
health clinics.
I'm sorry, Mr.
Chair, I, there's, there's just
so much here that I have, I have
a hard time believing that we
are going to the AOC is equipped
to do all the things that we
already have in place, and I
fear that through our budget
process, it has to be reflected
in somehow in some way.
I have, we have our
Our secretaries here. I don't
know if they want to make
comments to this, but I am, I'm
greatly concerned with, with how
this is unfolding, and I'm quite
concerned that we didn't have
The Health and Human Services
Committee weigh in on how this
was all unfolding, Mr. Chair. I
just, I have to say this. I'm,
I'm concerned about this. I want
to believe that this is how this
is going to all be OK and
everything, but I'm having a
hard time because we just
changed the HDA to the HCA and
what was the price tag on that?
Can anybody tell me that, Mr.
Chair?
Lots of money.
Welcome to Appropriation
committees and, and when
appropriation bills come in with
structure, that's the way
appropriations work, uh, Senate
Bill 1 was an appropriation
bill, Senate Bill 2 is an
appropriation bill, and we're
appropriate, I, I mean, you can
be mad at us all you want and
and say this is not a cut to any
agency. We're not taking their
recurring funding. This is new
funding. It's non-reoccurring.
We're going to stand it up,
we're gonna figure out how to,
how to fund the next level for
the next 2 years, um, but no
agency is
being cut, and, and if you
think, and you still think, and
this is my issue is, if you
think we move the needle $2.5
billion was spent over the last
3 years of mental health.
If you think we moved the
needle.
You can vote no, but if, if, uh,
you think we've moved for, this
is gonna move the needle, then
you should probably vote yes.
Thank you and Representative
Lujan, yeah, please wrap up.
Thank you and I do commend you
and I commend all the work that
you're doing on this. I really,
really do. I think, and I hear
you, and I've heard this
throughout the interim and how
you've been working on this.
However, I feel like there are
some gaps here. I hope we can
all come together and really
work on those gaps and how we
can do this. I do have serious
concerns. I do believe we do
need to move the needle. I have
been working, Mr. Chair, on this
and working with the, the
commission at the AOC on
behavioral health for the last
couple.
couple years. I have been
working on the issue of
competency. I have been
monitoring and working towards
how we can better do this in
grass, and get a grasp around
this. That's why I have my
concerns, Mr. Chair, I want to
put that on record as well. And
I wanna say I do commend you,
uh, senators, Senator and all
that you've done here.
I, I'm just taking pause. Thank
you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. OK,
we're gonna go next to
representative Hernandez, then
to Representative Duncan.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, uh, the
behavioral health work I did was
with, you know, the AOC
framework, Mr. Chairman, I
believe the AOC works. I believe
that AOC needs more investment
and that we need to make this a
statewide initiative. Mr.
Chairman, my question is, uh,
and senators, thank, thank you
for, for the work that you guys
are doing on this, uh, the
question I have is on page, uh,
P
3 section 4.
Um,
The, the behavioral health team,
I understand now includes our,
our, our judicial.
Um, uh, system which I'm, I'm
glad that it, it's always been
like that, Mr. Chairman. Uh, Mr.
Chairman, um, I, uh, my, my, my
question is,
Is our law enforcement officers,
are they part of the behavioral
health team.
Mr. Chair Representative within
Senate Bill 3, there's an entire
definition for behavioral
stakeholders and local law
enforcement is included in that,
as is public schools and there's
a whole list.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, uh,
and the senators, I, I, I asked
that question because, um,
Uh, in Shiprock, uh, you know,
they're, they're needing 3.7
million to complete their
command center.
And in a rural communities, Mr.
Chairman, our law enforcements
are really the people in the the
the first ones to identify the
problems, to understand what.
Who, who, who, who needs to be
to to be responded who who who
also needs to be there and so,
uh, um, uh, Mr. Chairman,
senators would would section 4
be uh opportunities for.
The Shiprock community to apply
for some of this money to finish
their their command center. Um,
Mr. Chapresentative, not for a
police station, it's a
behavioral health facility, uh,
in line with the bill than it
would.
But not for police facilities,
not for command centers.
They're, this bill is is for
treatment and to set up
treatment if Shiprock wanted to
add
In that building
A mental health corner section,
however they want to do that,
then they would be eligible for
funding.
Thank, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Uh, my last question, Mr.
Chairman, um, representative
Duncan and I participated in a
meeting with our San Juan County
legislators in conjunction with
the ah San Juan Regional
Hospital. They're doing
something regionally right now,
uh, that I think is, is, I, I
hope gets more attention, uh,
senators, with that project be
eligible in Section 4.
Mr. Chairman Representative,
yes. That was chairman, that
concludes my questions. Great.
Thank you, Representative
Hernandez, uh, Representative
Duncan and Representerrera.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh,
Representative Hernandez, asked
one of my questions that was
about the Farmington area and
that stand up program there. Um,
Senator, can you talk a little
bit about, uh, Mr. Senator, can
you talk a little bit about the
regional planning? We're in
district.
11, so there's 11 and 11B,
right? Or there's 11 and 11A.
1A, OK. Can you, can you address
that our needs are different,
but they're somewhat dissimilar,
so, so, uh, remind me of the
facility we just mentioned, the,
the hospital.
Regal. So when, when you go to
regional and we're in 11 and
118, right? And and you have San
Juan Regional in there and the
11th district meets and said,
OK, what does this look like,
right? We, you know you what you
what you're short of in that
area. Gallup has Santa Feo
Corners recovery, which is the
same one as Santa Fe recovery.
They're the same operator. So we
have an operate two operators
with may have completely
different needs. You have the
facility. We do not.
have a facility, we have a
hospital that may have room for
a facility. And so when San Juan
Regional says, OK, we need
intervention, we need these
treatment programs, we need
this, and, and
11 A Gallup says they need uh
mobile response. They need more
police training. Those are the
things that that each region
gonna be able to target
separately. That's why it's so
different, right? And that's why
it's so not confined. The
guardrails are there, but the
guardrails are so flexible that,
you know, if, if
Because we, this is an
interesting scenario. Farmington
doesn't do this, but we pick up
every person for detox,
especially when it's cold at
night, right?
And we shelter them overnight.
We can't hold them cause there's
no criminal cause, but it, that
is a leading to what alcoholism
is for us. It's changing a
little bit right now with drugs,
and other mental health issues.
So, we know what's happening in
those people's lives. I mean, a
couple of weeks ago it was 7 and
below, no snow on the ground.
The police are out there with
drones and body scanners and
trying to find heat sources so
those people don't freeze to
death. Numerous
incidences of of people.
Of of them doing that. I think
Farmington did it for a while
and there was a lawsuit and it
kind of stopped her. I, I don't
really know exactly, but.
They're so different in
regionals, you don't wanna.
Cork screw somebody in, you can
only do this.
Pick what works in your area and
pick what works in the same
district area.
And then determine those needs
and then fund them correctly.
Thank you, Mr. Cha. Thank you
for that, Senator. That, that's
what I was wondering about and
Quite frankly worried about
cause our needs aren't the same.
I don't think there's anybody
sitting on this panel that
doesn't have.
Um,
some, a family member with a
knee.
That's it. I'm grateful for
this, um.
Uh
I
The, the last question I'll ask,
so.
If, if the feds.
cut dollars and restructure what
they're gonna do. How will this,
will this have an impact on the
programs that we set up in the
next year or so, and then what
do we do if, if those dollars
from the feds are cut, and we
can't utilize as many of that.
Well, you know, we're watching
Medicaid really, really closely
right now and what's happening
at the federal level, because
that is our biggest cost to the
state budget. And so when that,
if they depend start cut on
Medicaid, it's Katie bar the
door and and start grabbing
money to save Medicaid and and
everything we need to do.
Um, this bill is structured, you
know, if you can get Medicaid
match, great. Let's get it done.
But let's not wait for Medicaid
match if you need it. So let's
figure that out and, and then
figure out.
We don't know what, we don't
know on the funding level,
right? We don't know Farmington
system's gonna take 3.5 million
and Galop's gonna take 3.5
million and all of a sudden
we're short all over the state,
but we
We've done our best to figure
out what the number could be in
in kind of gave it a little bit
extra and so that's what we
don't know, but.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, Senator. Um, you know,
I, I always, I always go back to
this one thing, when's the best
time to plant a tree?
20 years ago, when's the next
time today? I'm grateful for the
step forward and planning this.
Thank you. Thank you,
Representative Duncan.
Represent, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, senators. Um, I may have
missed the obvious here, but I
just want to ask the question
anyhow, who's in charge of
deciding who sits on the
regional Behavior Health
councils.
Center
The center is in charge.
There.
Uh, Mr. Chair, representative
Ferre, so within Senate Bill 3
that provides that framework,
right? So the behavioral health
stakeholders will all meet and
come together. AOC will just get
them in a room, be like on this
date, this is when we're
meeting. Anyone who's interested
who deals with behavioral
health.
You're welcome. State agencies
involved with your health.
You need to send someone, right?
Um, there's no definitive.
This person, that person needs
to be in the room, it's very
much tailored to the that
region. So, some regions, um,
well, all regions will
definitely have local
representation, right? So local
government, county government,
people, you're gonna have the
behavioral health providers in
that area.
Some regions might want to focus
a little bit more on youth,
right, cause they're dealing
with a lot more youth behavioral
health stuff, so they might
want, you know, CYFD and the
public schools there. Other
regions might deal primarily
with adults initially in their
first iteration of this. So it,
it'll vary depending on the
region, but within Cenate Bill
3, there is a stipulation saying
that if a behavioral stakeholder
requests to be part of the
planning process, AOC has to let
them in. No one will be excluded
if they feel.
That their voice needs to be in
the room as these plans are
being formulated.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Jarrett.
Thank you, Adrian, and um, so
these, these uh regional
Councils will set up their own
um
Governing
Authority, I mean, who votes and
who doesn't vote, is that how
that will work?
So Mr. Chair.
And so, Mr. Chair, um, Senate
Bill 3 creates a behavioral
health executive committee
composed of 7 members. You have
that.
Uh, secretary of the Healthcare
Authority.
You have the Medicaid director,
and you have the director of
behavioral health services at
the Healthcare Authority. So 3
from the executive. You have the
director of the administrative
office of the courts.
Who basically, you know.
Organizing the meetings and the
administrative officer of the
courts will appoint 3 behavioral
health experts. This is the
committee that will basically
review all the regional plans
and basically go through them
and be like, OK, yes, this
qualifies for Medicaid. Let's
figure out based on the
appropriations of legislature
gives, how to piecemeal these
together and you get this much,
you get this much, deliver on
this, and they'll ensure the
outcomes and monitor. They have
to meet a minimum of once a
quarter, and it's those key
stakeholders.
Not a designee, it's the
decision makers in the room, and
they have to report to you all.
Every quarter as well.
So, as there's implementation
issues, if there's design
issues, there's immediate time
to pivot. You don't have to wait
till the next session.
Um, and then in terms of the
regional plans, it's done by
consensus. So the people that
are there,
Come to a consensus, if there's
a contentious issue, it gets
elevated to that committee who
will use data and other things
to make a a final determination
if the region can't come to a
consensus. Mr. Chair Adrian,
that was very helpful, thank
you, I, I really didn't
understand how you'd work this,
so thank you, thank you.
Thank you,
uh, down for a second question.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. OK, so
we're, this appropriation is
This one sets up the fund. This
one created one year's worth of
appropriations.
One year.
Then each year or quarterly at
some point someone said
quarterly, we'll come back and
decide what additional
appropriations are needed or
What happens after you're one.
Well, in, in the way I
understand this, the quarterly
is just our information from
The group to tell us what's
working and what's not, then we
as a legislators will redirect
on what needs to be done to
correct. So if we find something
that works really well in one
sector, another sector doesn't
have that capability, and we as
a legislator get to determine,
then we would be in the next
session looking for more monies
to readdress these until the
billion dollar.
Fun gets fully funded, and then
it's self-generates the 5% $50
million a year, we'll always
have to supplement, but if you
look at it right now, where 1.2
billion.
is our projection on behavioral
health right now. What if we put
that money.
To better use.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, Senator. So if the
When you're saying they'll
report back to us. I mean, I, we
have a gazillion different ways
that folks are supposed to work
back to us. Are we
reauthorizing. We'll have to
reauthorize each year.
Nothing's a given.
Is it are we in house in Senate
Bill 3.
Are refunding the these projects
in perpetuity or there and
they're just coming back and
giving us report like everybody
else does.
Uh, Mr. Chair, not necessarily.
So when you get the reports,
right now, we have no real sense
of how much it's going to take
to invest and fix our
infrastructure for being
relevant, right? So in the
regional reports they'll
identify their funding
priorities, and now you'll have
a number.
And you'll have the deliverables
of what the different things
they want to do in those
regions, and then you all can
make an informed decision of
whether to fund them or not,
right? And then right now,
Senate Bill 2 creates the
buckets. We created enough
buckets to hopefully cover any
ideas that the locals can come
up with to address behavioral
health that's custom to their
area and their needs and their
gaps.
Um, if next year you find that,
for example, section 4 still has
a balance of 43 million, but
section 3 got wiped out
instantly and their behavioral
plans say there's 3 other
regions that want to do that,
shift the money.
Right? It gives you that
flexibility. But this is kind of
a down payment, taking a best
guess ideally, every last penny
is going to be spent.
Before the next session, right?
Um, however, we don't know what
we don't know and until we have
those regional plans,
We've been flying blind up until
now, but starting next session,
you won't be.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you very much down. OK,
members, thanks for great
questions. I have a few first,
is there a timeline for the
regional plan to be submitted.
Uh, Mr. Chair, they have at the
absolute latest, 2027.
However, they can get that done
within the next 2 months. More
power to that region. So it's
very much how quickly they can
coalesce and identify their
gaps, and, and come to a
consensus. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Reporting begins in, in May
reporting begins in May of 2025,
see if they've started the
action, right? And then
quarterly reporting from then
on.
And, and we'll see if they're
moving the needle, but reporting
begins in May of this year. OK.
Thank you for that and um
The
so in our budget in this you've
structured it for some of these
sort of um FY sort of current
year FY 25 through FY 29, um,
Here in section one.
Um, I believe we go through at
least FY 27 and probably FY 28
for some of their
appropriations. Um,
Is there, I guess a
any fear that sort of our, the,
the way to solve these issues,
at least from the consensus
level will simply to be sort of
fund everything if we're
consensus driven sort of if a
request.
Yeah, how do we evaluate that or
um
Sort of what's in and what's
out.
Well, the data will tell us
that, right? If in the 11th that
Farmington reacts quicker than
gallop, and they're they're
spending money in your, maybe in
year 25, a year from.
Last December, they're spending
money and they're appropriating
money out there. We'll be seeing
that data quarterly, right? And
if Gallup is slowing down and
not getting their work done,
then we're going to say, well,
OK, they're not really active in
behavioral health, um, hos is
looking for more funding for
this situation. So as we get to
those points, the data will tell
us who's who's moving, who's not
moving, what plans are being
built, how the process is
working, and, and where we
really need to target money and
where, you know.
The islands of behavioral health
exist, right? Northeastern New
Mexico may be a total completely
island for behavioral health and
sure that's gonna be ultimately
it's sort of that 3 AOC 4
executive member committee that
decides that funding because
we're appropriating to large
buckets, it's that 7 member
committee that will decide that
to sort of shift funding or what
have you in that scena.
Mario.
Well the appropriations will be
made directly, right, to AOC so
they won't be able to shift the
money out of AOC. They'll be
able to see if AOC is
performing, but they can award
money through grants, I think
the healthcare authority can
award money through grants to to
process it. There's other
awardees, they won't be able to
ship money from one bucket to
another.
And, and so they'll have to
appropriate out of the dollars
that they have in those buckets.
Thank you, chair, and but they
like sort of the shifting sort
of community X that has their
act together or District X,
they'll, that's where that that
um group will control sort of
who gets the grants from the
various areas of funding which
we've collaborated closely on, I
think, very well, and I don't
know, you still here. Maybe
she's listening.
Uh,
Madam Secretary, if, if, if this
gets stood up and, and all of a
sudden we see a bucket run
empty. Is there an opportunity
ship behavioral health money
from the agency into that.
Yeah, and we can, if you want to
answer, I think I'm
My sense, uh,
We
You know, if we're waiting, we,
we.
We're shifting substantially
sort of our approach.
Um
Waiting until 2027 for sort of
community plans would be failure
in super unsatisfactory. I mean,
that's, that would be.
pretty
Not a good outcome.
Um
I think it's less likely.
And Madam Secretary, Mr. Chair,
if you guys think differently
that we're gonna spend down some
of these buckets, although I do
foresee and sort of year 2 and
year 3.
That community sort of.
There's no cap to what
communities will request because
if everybody is able to come in.
Which is fair, and it's a
consensus different process.
The, the, the easiest and sort
of clearest way to that is
anything somebody suggests.
The the way for that plan to be
approved is to say yes.
And I wonder if that starts to
test our sort of funding
capacity at some point.
Mr. Chair, I think that's a
really good question, and I do
want to just, um, my
understanding of this package of
bills, um, is that it's really
additive to what the agency is
currently doing. Uh, we will
keep our foot on the gas, um, we
stood up 5 CCBHCs, uh, we have
plans to roll out more, um, I
don't think there are a lot of
gaps in terms of the budget
right now and so that allows the
executive priorities to continue
while this.
is going on, so I don't want to
create the impression that work
will stop for 2 years while we
wait for plans to roll in, um,
we will also be sort of adding
to our portfolio and more
authentic and engaged planning
process with regional
communities, um, I showed you
all during my budget hearing the
gap analysis that we're working
on, hoping that that will really
inform decision making, um, and
allow for some rapid, um, sort
of.
Ability to strategize at the
local level to fill in gaps and
so to make sure that we're not
duplicating as well, but I just
want to reassure you I don't
think that um from the
healthcare authority's
perspective, anything is
stopping uh while we wait for
the plans to roll in. That's
great, thank you and Mr. A. And
uh Mr. Chair, if I can just add,
I just want to clarify the 2027
deadline. That's the deadline to
have both the regional plans and
sequential intercept mapping
done. The courts say that they
can
all sequential intercept mapping
done within a year and a half.
So that's kind of why we have
the 2027 deadline. Senate Bill 3
includes language that the
regional plans don't have to
wait for sequential intercept
mapping to initiate. However,
one sequential intercept mapping
is done, they have to come back
and
edit, right? Their, their
regional plans. So it's, it's
meant to be kind of a cycle, but
2027 is the drop dead deadline
for for everything. Got it. OK,
thank you very much, Mr. Ada. I
don't, I think we, so chair, um,
I'll, I'll conclude, I think,
uh, the flexibility and
engagement locally, which is
sort of a core feature of this
is great. I wanna thank you for
that compliment the work.
Um, while in compliment director
writing in our work, we've, uh,
I think reduced some of the, you
know, this will be the first
year of trying something that we
all acknowledge is new needed
broadly with some questions in
different areas, uh, the bill
that we'll be sending you uh
sort of reduces in some areas
what could have been seen as red
tape, so that we make sure and
get the money out, um, and
we'll, I think the reporting
feature
It's a very strong feature and
having that built in is, is very
positive, so, um,
Anyway, and appreciate this
opportunity in committee for
taking time and
Yeah, we're, we'll wrap up and
then go to you, Mr. Chair.
Obviously we won't be taking a
boat, but thanks to the
committee for great questions,
Mr. Chair, back to you. I, I, I
just want to tell the
legislators, I mean, this is
gonna be on us too.
Each of us have those problems
in our community, and this can
be each of us to push those
collaboratives, those regional
plannings. It, it's not gonna
just throw it on the courts.
Legislators have a big stake in
this.
I mean
Believe it or not, and when you
see things that aren't being
done correctly, you're gonna
have the help and the, the
ability to do that.
Um, so don't think cause we
passed this bill that, that all
this behavioral health stuff is
gonna get set up and done
magically. It's gonna take
legislators attending meetings,
pushing, talking about
priorities and making sure that
they're, they're going forward,
um, because there'll be places
where they're gonna be islands
where you're not gonna have that
and I, my biggest fear is
Northeast New Mexico, where you
have large land masses, very
few, uh, people around and, and
not a lot of service and how's
that look in that area? I mean,
it's gonna look completely.
different in every area, um, so
don't think once we pass this
package that the your
responsibilities are up because
we all want this to start
working in, you know, God bless
Adrian and
Putting up with me cause I
didn't know anything. I, I
shouldn't, I know nothing about
Haver healthcare. I'm not even
an expert, but I've learned more
than anything in Sen Schindel is
the same way and it's like, we
were tasked with this while you
guys were tasked with crime and
so this is, this is the process
and this is the way it works,
and so, just remember to
legislators that when these
things hit your, your, well,
it's gonna probably be around
this weekend, I'm guessing, uh,
when these things hit your
communities, I mean, then the
work starts.
And you may be in session, so
you can trigger up those people
while while that's happening, so
thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator,
Senatoregoing to close with.
No.
Just thank you for listening and
the great debate and the
discussion points, I think we
just want to take behavioral
health forward uh before we've
been in the last few years. So
thank you for your time.
Great. Thank you all very much
committee that'll conclude us
for today. We'll be back
tomorrow afternoon to take up a
couple of bills, uh, and then
we'll be addressing the budget
Friday morning.
Was that where, uh, is there
anybody, let me ask, is there
anybody who wishes to give
public comment?
Great. Uh, we do have one person
online.
Tanika
Yeah
Good afternoon, Mr. Chair, um,
Madam Vice Chair members of the
committee. My name is Tanika
Sosa Gonzalez. I'm a board
certified psychiatric nurse from
Las Cruces, New Mexico. Um, I've
started AOT, stood up the first
CCBHC in southern New Mexico.
Um, I oversee the, we've done
two rounds of sequential
intercept mapping in southern
New Mexico and Donana County,
and I oversee the collaborative
that is responsible for um
connecting the pieces of this.
Um, I also sat through hundreds
of involuntary um court
proceedings, and I'm
very concerned that um I'm very
concerned that we are not
specifically laying out language
in these bills that provides
provisions for youth, um,
sequential intercept mapping,
um, sequential intercept mapping
was codified in the Cures Act,
and so it's very prescriptive
and highly different than adults
sequential intercept mapping,
and I really believe that the
youth and the the youth of New
Mexico deserve to have their
needs assessed, and the
communities in New Mexico
deserve to be able to assess the
needs and um of their youth and
provide for them, um, under the
umbrella under this umbrella.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you very much. Thank you for
your work. OK, uh, I think that
concludes our public comment.
Members, thank you, and we'll
see everybody tomorrow.
