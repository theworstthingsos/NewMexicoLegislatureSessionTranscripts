Madam Vice Chair.
Madam Chair, here you have a
quorum. OK, so we have a core
and we're gonna start with
Senate Bill 88 as amended.
So whenever you're ready, Madam
Vice Chair and senator.
Um, thank you.
That's not.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, so
Senate Bill 88 creates a
Medicaid trust fund.
And, uh, the idea here is like
some of the other trust funds
will put money in it and
eventually will start drying off
5% of what's in there. Um, how
it's funded is the overnight
deposits to the treasury. So,
taxes or fees or whatever comes
into the treasury, uh, it sits
there in the bank overnight, and
then it goes off to get invested
wherever it's going, but the
interest from that night is what
goes into here.
And what we're looking at here
is if you look at the FIR $279
million from overnight deposits
that
For one year, OK?
Uh, so $300 million a year until
it gets up to $2 billion and
then we stopped putting money in
it, but then you start to draw
off of that, the 5%.
And that 5% is then matched with
the federal money, and so
That's how you, you, you fund
the trust fund. Does it replace
Medicaid, uh, money coming from
the general fund? Absolutely
not.
Uh, but it certainly
Uh, changes the dynamic of where
the money comes from.
So
With that stand for question.
