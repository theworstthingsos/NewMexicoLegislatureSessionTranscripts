This meeting for the House Appropriations
and Finance Committee to
order, we'll first
ask Miss Baker to call the roll
please.
>> Here.
Yeah,
here
here.
Representative.
>> Thank you very much. Um
We're gonna go
straight to House Bill
seven and
ask uh
Wisinski and her experts to come
on
it.
Uh ok, great
to see you. Uh Representative
Zap Pansy, we
have an amendment here.
Do you want to uh briefly
explain the bill? I know the amendment is an
important portion of the bill.
Uh If
um maybe you
can explain the bill and then we'll go
to the amendment if that's ok with
you. >> Thank you. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman and Members. It's
great to be here with you
today on House Bill
seven. House Bill
seven addresses the Health
Care Affordability Fund
which was established just
in 2021.
Um and has already showed
major success.
Um I want
to on the nature of
the programs that are
being funded by the Health
Care Affordability
Fund. Um
These programs
are uh
resources
for
consumers to reduced
costs of insurance
in the private market.
So all of these
um programs
that have been created by the office
of the superintendent of
insurance um
are supporting
consumers and purchasing
private insurance.
Um This bill
specifically
addresses the
fact that the health care
affordability fund
distribution to these
programs is scheduled
to go down
um in for
fy 25
and the bill is
introduced um
was attempting to increase
that distribution for Fy
25. Uh
Mr. Chairman and
Committee, um
the amendment
uh was specifically
drafted to avoid
impacting the fy
25
budget um
and pushes
the uh change
in the distribution so that
it would be hitting an fy
26
so that um
this Committee as well as the
legislative finance Committee
can really factor
into the
planning if this bill were
to be adopted or it
is not our intention to
impact any of the
incredible work that's happened
already in this Committee.
Um Mr.
Chairman and Representative
I also have with me an
expert witness,
Mr. Colin Bao from
the office of the Superintendent
of Insurance
and um
I might pause
there
to
entertain questions.
>> Thank you very much.
Thank you for that
Members. Let's go.
Now I ask that
we mov'e
amendment
0.227834
0.1. Is that the
copy that you have?
We mov'e that for
discussion.
It's been moved by represent
second by Representative
Garrett. Thank you all for that.
Ok. And
representative, you
just explain the amendment,
this changes
the effective date by
a year. So it does not impact
this current budget.
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Ok,
great. Thank you
for that. Are there any
questions on the
amendment?
Ok. I don't see any
questions on the amendment.
Is there opposition to
adopting House
Appropriations and Finance Committee
amendment? One
thing none, that
amendment is
adopted.
Ok. Uh Thank
you very much representative. Now
we can go uh to
your expert and then we'll
go for public
comment.
>> Uh Mr. Chair Members
of the Committee, Columb Baio with the office
of Superintendent of Insurance.
Um I think the, the only
thing I have to add is
that we're very proud of the
work that has been done
on the uh
health care affordability
fund. And uh I think
that we have a good, good, strong
track record. We've seen uh
increased enrollment in our
programs uh because
of them and look forward to
continuing to work on them.
>> Fantastic. Thank you very much.
Ok. Uh We'll go
now for public comment.
We are going to keep the public comment
pretty brief, uh just starting
as we work through
our bills. Uh If
anybody wishes to speak in
opposition to house Bill seven
as amended, please
raise your
hand.
Okay.
Opposition. No,
that's ok. Lots of
eyes. But uh
ok. Uh Is there
anybody
online?
So?
Ok.
Ok. Now we're gonna go to
support, please
go ahead line up in the middle.
Uh If everybody could
keep it within a minute, please,
that would be great. But we want to
hear folks uh what they
have to say
it's like you go get
it. Please
go ahead and you can stand right
behind in the middle. We should
have our mikes that pick it. >> A
thank. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee,
I'm Brent Earnest with
BL and M and Mexico Health Insurance
Exchange. And as
Mr. Baio mentioned, we've seen
significant growth in our
enrollment uh
and it partly tribal
to the great work of health care
afford fund and we look
forward to program being
available
>> a little bit
closer.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair Members of the
Committee, Deputy
Secretary Health
Care Authority Services
Department, our department
strongly in favor of
seven for
reasons of greater accessibility.
And thank >> you. Thank
you very
much.
>> Good afternoon Chair as a member of the
Committee. My name is Andres Quil.
I'm the campaigns manager of the New
Mexico Dream team. Uh I live
in Albuquerque and I am here to
ask you uh to pass
HP seven. This
is important to me because of my mom and
how unaffordable healthcare
the healthcare she needs can become.
My mom has prediabetes and
with that, she has to pay 100 and
$4 every six months
for a blood analysis over
100 every three months
for her, for her diabetes,
cholesterol and blood pressure
medications plus
$80. For every
consultation with her current
situation. She is unable to
access insurance because it is
unaffordable and she ends up having to pay
out of pocket if this bill
is passed, this will provide folks
with more realistic and affordable
options for people like my mom to
access insurance for
this. I urge you and Members of the
Committee to vote in support of HP
seven. >> Thank
you.
Mm >> Hello,
Chair Members of the Committee. My name
is Yanis Hernandez.
I'm an community organizer with the New
Mexico dream team and I live in the best
city of New Mexico, Las Cruces.
Um It's not a secret that the working
people all over the country struggle to
make ends meet, pay their bills. We put
on the table and on top of all
that deal with high medical cost.
That's why HP seven is so important
to nec to New Mexico families.
I know students and their families in Las Cruces
who benefited who benefited
from the fund, honest working
people all across our State would only
continue to benefit from a fully funded
O si budget request. The health
care afford ability fund
lowering premiums for small businesses,
lowering costs for coverage on the
exchange, creating a
health benefit in Mexico families for those
reasons. I urge you to vote. Yes
on seven. Thank you. Thank >> you very
much.
>> Good afternoon, Mr. Chair. My name is
Nicholas Cordova for the New Mexico Center
on Poverty. A member of the New Mexico
together for health care campaign.
We ask for your support for HP SEVEN
because our families deserve a stable
source. Of funding to lower health care
coverage costs.
Right now, the fund receives
just over half of the revenue from a
fee with the remaining 45%
of that revenue going to
the general fund. That
means right now, the
general fund is receiving
just over $100
million from this fee's revenue.
The health care affordability fund's share
of revenue should remain stable so
the State can continue lowering health
care costs for that. We
are for that reason we were to do
p >> Thank you very
much.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair Members of
the Committee. My name is John
Arango. I'm a member of the
Mexico Medical Insurance
Pool. Uh The Proof's
mission is to ensure that
all new Mexicans will
not covered by high quality
health insurance. Have the
opportunity to buy
that insurance from the
pool. We learned
many years ago that the major
reason people are not
buying health insurance is they
can't afford it
who has been working with the
superintendent of insurance
and our staff to
create an effective and cost
efficient way to
guarantee that funds available
from the health care affordability
fund will be made
available to small
businesses and individuals
who need a subsidy in
order to obtain health
insurance for themselves
and their employees.
We very much appreciate
any funds that the legislature
makes available, but
frankly, 30% of
the health care affordability
fund is insufficient.
We urge you to increase
the amount of the fund
that will be available to small
businesses and individuals
from 30% back to
55%. Thank
you. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair Members of the Committee.
My name is Gabriella Rivera. I'm
the Director of Policy and Communications
with health tax, New Mexico.
We are to support this Legislation.
We were early supporters
of this fund
and we've already
seen
through this work, we've seen thousands
of New Mexicans gain access to coverage
who would otherwise not have it.
We know that quality health insurance
means preventive care is more
frequently utilized. Chronic
conditions are better managed and
families aren't facing
devastating medical debt
when a medical emergency
hits. Thank you and we are
to support. >> Thank you very
much.
Good afternoon,
Mr. Chairman.
My name is Mark Mitchell,
former Governor from the Pueblo
of Tesuque and on
behalf of Governor Herrera and
Council, we support this
bill for all this
stated earlier. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Ok. Uh We
have uh a few
folks online. We're gonna go
first to Karen's
Ipad
and probably to Karen
herself.
I don't
see
on
you.
>> There we go.
Ok.
Good afternoon, good morning,
good morning, Mr. Chair
and Members of the Committee. My
name is Karen mccarney Brown. I'm
a New Mexican and I've spent most
of my 37 year medical
career, practicing family
medicine in underserved areas
of New Mexico. I
cared for many patients who
postponed their mammogram,
declined colon cancer screening
or never made it to see the specialist.
I encourage them to see
due to the fears of cost
costs for transportation
upfront charges due to lack of
insurance and treatment
expense.
Um We encourage you
to support the
stable funding for House
Bill seven and
um thank you very much
for your time. >> Thank
you very much. Next, we're
gonna go to an Hali
Taneja.
>> Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman
and Members
of the Committee. My
name is Angeli Taneja.
I'm a family
physician and the director
of a primary care clinic in
Albuquerque called Casa de
Salut. And we're a member of the
New Mexico together for health care
campaign also,
um just want to touch
on three points. Um
One is that we are a small
business and we've already seen
the effect for our employees
of our clinic of
the 10% decreased
premiums for employees,
employers and
employees. Um and this
has had great impact on
uh thousands of small
businesses um across
the State at a time when healthcare
costs are going up for
businesses. Um
Second, we work
with a lot of people on Medicaid
and with the Medicaid unwinding,
um uh thousands
of our patients lost
insurance thankfully because
of the subsidized
cost. With the health
insurance exchange, we were able
to help them get on
to very affordable insurance,
more affordable than ever
before. Um And
this is really important to
stop uh people
from not having insurance. And third
of all, we work with many
uninsured people
and hope that they can get
access to insurance
and preventive care
and needed care. So we don't end
up having to pay more and
disrupt their lives and their
family lives by not
having that. Um Please
fully fund the
distribution. Thank
you. >> Thank
you
Sarah Minor
shovel.
>> Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and
Members of the Committee, I'm Sarah
Minor and I'm the outreach and community
relations manager with New
Mexico voices for Children.
We stand in strong support
of House Bill Seven because we
believe that all New Mexicans
should have access to affordable
health care coverage. Since
its inception, the health care
affordability fund has been a
lifeline for tens of thousands
of New Mexicans while
lowering premiums for our small
businesses. We
believe that this fund must be
stabilized to preserve these
important gains and to
ensure affordable health care access
for even more families.
We thank the sponsors for
introducing this bill and
we strongly urge your support.
Thank you very much. >> Thank
you very much.
OK. Next, we're gonna go
to Cecilia
Opinion.
>> Hello, Chairman and
Members of the Committee,
Min Nombre Cecilia Pinon.
I live in Anthony, New Mexico.
Very close to the border.
I am a community
organizer organizer
with strong families, New Mexico.
We ask for your support on
HP seven,
the health care affordability fund
distribution bill HP
seven will keep the funding
levels constant. So the health
care affordability fund
can continue to provide
affordable coverage
to families across New
Mexico. Thank you.
>> Thank you very much.
Uh Next, we're gonna go to
Dave uh
Poff
>> uh Marae
uh board Members,
uh Nana Nanni
Dave Pecos.
Um I'm a member
of Youth United for Climate
Crisis Action
and
um
uh HP seven sounds like a
really good deal. So I
would
I urge you guys to support
the bill. >> Thank you very
much. OK. Uh
Thank you Mr. Pecos. And next, we're
gonna conclude with Leroy.
So
>> good afternoon Chair
and Members of the Committee.
My name is Leroy. So I'm
from Tolaga, a
small community north of
Gallup in mckinley
County. I am a health
care leader with the New Mexico
together for health care
coalition. Many
don't know that Indian
Health Service is not health
insurance coverage.
Many people here in mckinley
County are left without
the care they need because
IHS is limited
and not health care
coverage. I am
proud that the health care
Affordability Fund has
made it possible for
there to be a $0
premium for Native
Americans up to
300% of the
federal property
level. It is very
important that the health
care affordability fund
distribution is
stable so our
communities can
finally realize
the promise of the
treaties and have
access to truly affordable
health care coverage.
Health care is unaffordable
without insurance coverage.
Please support HP seven
and stabilize the
funding to keep
the current programs as
reliable sources of
health care for our
communities. Thank
you. >> Thank
you very much, Mr. So, ok,
that concludes our public comment.
Thanks for everybody for being
uh efficient. We're gonna
go first to Representative
Chatfield.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
uh Mr.
Chair
representative
after
the amendment.
Uh I assume
that this bill still
does just
what it did before which
is
maintain the current
level of disbursement
into
the general fund and
the current level of
disbursement into
the health care
affordability fund
because I under it's my
understanding that it
was is
being dispersed at a certain
percentage.
Uh Now
it's set to
for the percentage to
change and the more of it
to go into the general fund less
into the health care
affordability fund.
So with the amendment, it's
still just does that same
thing, it just maintains it at a
certain level.
Is that true or false?
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and Representative Chatfield.
Um
What the
distribution was scheduled to
go down 30
to 30%
for this coming fiscal
year that is
maintained with the amendment.
So it will still go down
to 30% for
this fiscal year.
However, it will go back
up to 55%
for fy 26
and with the >> amendment which
>> is the >> current level.
>> That's correct.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Rep
Sam Sheffield. Next, we'll go to represent
Luhan, please,
>> Mr. Chair. I think that question
was uh I'm pretty sure we
have to step out. So just in
regards to the those concerns
with including the uh continuing
the distribution language
in the statutory provisions, your
amendment takes care of that. Is that
correct,
>> Mr. Chairman and Representative
Lujan? Yes, >> that's perfect.
Thank you. I think that this is
obviously much needed
and I know from my own community
and the support we have
for and the need we have for this
and to continue it and
even grow it. But
thank you for bringing the bill forward
and this is
this is a big, a big
piece of what we need to do for the State.
Thank you, >> Mr. Chair. Thank you, represent
Laja. Next, we'll go to Rep
Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I guess.
Uh Thanks for the presentation. I
just have one question.
Uh Do uh native Americans
pueblos and tribes qualify for
this,
>> Mr. Chairman and Representative
Garcia. Um
Actually, one of the programs
that has been created by
the Office of the Superintendent
of Insurance for
um the use of this fund
is to provide
um 100%
free healthcare
premiums for
Native American individuals
that enroll on the
exchange,
>> Mr.
Chair.
They do, am I correct
>> Mr. Chairman and Garcia?
And, >> and the reason I'm asking Mr.
Chairman is because a lot of Native
American have insurance,
but a lot of them are a little
bit under because
you know, the the
the the quality, not the
quality of cover that you have,
they don't have enough coverage
sometimes or they have
an issue with the hospital and they have to
go out of that hospital into
another place. And I
just wanted to clarify that
the public knows that they aren't
qualified. So, thank you
very much. Thank >> you. Thank
you very much Garcia.
I don't see any other questions.
We'll go to the vice Chair for most
of. Thank >> you, Mr.
Chair. I would mov'e a due
pass on house bill seven as
amended.
>> Ok. Second by represent
Garcia, he was quicker this
time and represent
Figueroa is quite fast
as we see. Ok, there's
a motion for a due pass
on House Bill seven as amended.
Is there any opposition to adopting
that motion? See,
none. Ok,
thank you very much.
Ok. Uh Next we're
gonna go ask for Sam
Garrett with House
Bill 20
eight
>> Mr. Chair. There is an
amendment.
>> Ok, I think we've got it passed
out. Represent Garrett. Uh Please
feel free to explain the
bill. You can
uh when it's appropriate
explain the amendment and ple uh
great to have your expert
here. >> Yes,
and uh Mr. Chair in Committee.
My expert is John Brooks,
chief of programs at
the New Mexico Finance
Authority.
Um
House, let's
see, House
Bill 28
is the New Mexico Finance
Authority's Public Project
revolving fund
projects bill.
I'm carrying this Legislation
on behalf of the New Mexico
Finance Oversight
Committee. As
amended. The bill
authorizes New
Mexico Finance Authority
to provide loans from the
public project
revolving fund
to 100 and 38
qualifying entities. The
original bill was 100.
It adds 38
totally vetted projects
throughout every corner of the
State. Uh
They qualify
based on the terms and
conditions established by the
New Mexico Finance
Authority. The Public
project revolving fund
legislative authorization
carries a three
year
authorization
period.
The P PR F
enjoys a AAA
rating from S and
P and passes
that benefit on to
its bor borrowers
from the inception of the
program. N MA has made
2250
P pr F loans.
Totally more than
$4.75
billion. NM
FA is currently servicing
over
1100
public project revolving
fund loans which equal
about $1.86
billion. Uh Would
my expert witness like to just
add an additional
comment,
>> Mr. Chair, oops,
Mr. Chair and com uh
Committee Members. This
bill is our
annual authorization bill.
There is no appropriation
associated with this
bill. As
Representative Garrett has
pointed out, this bill will
allow us to uh
work with those
projects that are located in many
of your communities throughout the
State. Uh Without
this authorization, we will not be
able to work with those communities
until the next uh next
year. So this allows
us to work with
those um those
projects and communities,
but it does not
say that they will
get a
fighting
excellent >> that we
stand for questions. >> OK.
Thank you very much. Uh
Now we'll go to the
amendment. Can I ask that
House Amendment, House
Pros and Finance Committee
amendment one be
moved
>> Mr. Chair,
I mov'e House
Appropriations and Finance Committee
amendment number
1227616
0.1. So >> we have
that
there's a motion there a
second
by represent.
And Garrett, you
explain that this
adds additional projects
that can be considered,
this does not obligate
the State to selecting
these or any other project.
>> That's correct, Mr. Chair.
>> Ok, great.
Any questions on the
amendment?
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
So Chair, I have a problem with
this bill in general just but on the
amendments, we're adding even more
to my,
my questions on
adding to this fund
for
um charter
schools which I know we
placed this earlier.
It seems to be to my
attention here that we're adding
and building
upon that um
list but also
I'm seeing in the amendment that we
have public schools
on this list. So my
question goes to
why are we,
how are we so
inefficient with our
um capital
outlay uh
through our public schools
process that we
need to do this Mr.
Chair.
>> My expert will answer
that.
>> Um madam Chair, I
mean, Mr.
Chair Representative
Auja, this, this
bill just adds the
the authority for uh
the finance authority to
work with both public schools.
And so also charter
schools, it does not
give them the
ability or give
them the assurance that we are
moving forward with those projects,
but it just gives us
authorization.
>> I understand that and I have a
problem with that language and we
already have a process in place
for our capital projects
through our capital
outlay. Um
funding source
through that we are,
that's in place. So I my
question is, where
are we missing the mark and why are we
circumventing that process
to include it in this Mr.
Chair,
>> Mr. Chair and
madam Madam
Representative
Representative,
they are qualifying
entities to apply for
public project revolving
loans under the
statute.
that
>> Mr. Chair
Representative Lujan.
So what happens is
if there's not enough capital
outlay that's is uh added
to that particular project,
they can come to the finance
authority to
uh complete the project.
So in the event,
so for example, if you have a
$10 million project in
capital that gives them 8
million, they could come to the
Finance authority for the remaining
2 million and complete their
project and have a completed
project.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair again.
I that's I have
a problem with this process. How long
have we been? When was
this amended to
allow that to happen to
include charter schools and, and
school districts? Mr.
Chair,
>> Mr. Mr., Chairman,
Representative Luhan
at charter schools and public
schools have been authorized
for at
least 20
years.
>> I'm just through this process and we're
so why we,
if it's a blanket
um a
acceptance to the
process, why we, why
we um specifically naming
schools,
>> Mr. Chair uh Representative
Luhan, we have to have
the actual project
and, and name on the
authorization or we cannot
fund their, their particular
project So the bill
says
just in the outline,
for example, in line
102, the Pueblo of
Akima in Sla County,
we have to, uh, have
specific names who
we're going to fund
again. It doesn't give
them, uh, the, the
loan right now. We still have to
go through a lot of work, but it's
just a authorization and it
has to be a specific
project >> and I understand
that, but I can understand with
our counties and maybe being
significant to the
rural of our counties.
And I don't have a problem with
those. I have a problem with our
schools and there are specific
schools names
listed. Why isn't
it just blanket to all Mr.
Chair?
>> Um And thank you,
thank you. Go ahead and answer.
We've asked Miss Cars
Well, from LFC, they
also give additional,
there's additional
context.
>> Um Mr. Chair Representative
Lujan, if I could just maybe
clarify a couple of things.
So all this does is
provide sort of additional
an additional financing
mechanism for
the entities named in
here. Um The public
school capital Outlay Fund doesn't
necessarily fund all
types of projects schools
might want to pursue.
Um And Mr. Brooks can
correct me if I'm wrong on this.
But um
schools can also use the
Pr F
to um
go out for
issuing their
general obligation bonds that
their voters have approved.
So it's just kind of another tool
in the toolbox and
the statute requires
the finance authority come to
the legislature every year
to get the
authorization that this bill
provides for
them to lend
to entities for
uh projects over a million
dollars. So all this
does is give them that
ability, >> Mr.
Chair, I do understand that, but
there's still a conflict of,
of what I'm asking
why they are
specifically
named in
charter schools enlisted. Why
isn't it just a blanket for
all those that have
capital projects to be able
to go through the process or am I
missing something? I
think
>> Mr. Brooks go ahead >> and
so Mr. Chair representative,
we have to list the
author the, the
naming entity
or the school
district by
name. Otherwise, we
cannot finance the project,
so we cannot take a
blanket authorization for
all school districts. We
have to list and
identify each specific
school district, charter school
public entity
or whatever. So that's why you
see um
specific names
specific
uh
>> and that and represent,
I'm gonna ask if I can ask one
quick clarifying question
there, the
districts that the names
that we see here
AAA public
entity eligible for
this fund,
whomever is their
governing board
essentially
authorizes them to
make this application
correct, >> Mr. Chair.
That is correct. >> Ok.
Back to you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair,
Mr. Chair. I I don't know that I
just have some, I just have a problem
with this and how this is how
this is done or
when we have all these other for sources
and we have even more matching
funds coming for
that. We were voting on and
authorizing and I'm
just a little
perplexed with, with the
addition of this even though it's
been in place. So
as you can understand, there's a lot
of money going
all over the place. And I, I just would
to get a balance
of how we are spending
our taxpayer dollars and
including and continuing
to include and growing those
uh different types of funds
and different types of projects.
And understanding that
I, and it's to my understanding
that maybe charter schools
didn't, didn't qualify for
this all
together and when they have
because they're not allowed, there's,
there's an act, a charter school act
that doesn't, didn't allow
maybe it does now
for them to go
out to
um to
have this benefit as well. And I think
that's more recent and I have some issues
with that Mr. Chair. Thank
you. >> Thank
you, Mr.
Montoya. Let's go. We'll
keep onto.
Thank you, >> Mr. Chair
and Representative.
I think
I had some questions. I think that
some of that discussion helped me. I
think if I understand
right, there's a
fund during
bef before the lead up
to this legislative
Session and or every
legislative
Session,
the entities that
qualify
come to get on the
list
because they've been authorized by
their, whoever
it is that makes the decision for
them to get on the
list.
And, and
then I guess it is is it first
come first serve
or if there's
more applications
than there are, then there
are funds to
distribute?
Um
I'm just wondering how a
determination is made
at that point.
If,
if people do get
on this list,
how then
does are, are is there
or if, how the decision is made
as to which pro which projects get
funded?
>> Mr. Chair Representative
Montoya? So what takes
place is each
applicant uh su
uh submits a loan
application. We
have uh we take their application
in full consideration
and then we make a loan
as we make AAA
pool of loans,
then we will issue bonds
to reimburse ourselves to
re re uh
receive the fund
and therefore make additional
loans. So it's a revolving
loan fund in, in
that respect. So there's always
going to be sufficient
amount of money based
on the number of loans and the
repayments that we uh
reimbursements we make on
each bond issuance.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. That was the only
question I had. I just didn't understand
the process. Thank
you.
>> Uh OK. Uh
I don't see any other
questions. Let's go to the
amendment. Uh Can we
have a motion for adoption of House
Appropriations and Finance Committee
amendment? Number one.
Ok. Second by
represent Garcia. Is there any
opposition to adopting the
amendment?
Seeing no opposition
amendment is adopted
now can have a motion to
adopt HB
2928 as
amended, >> Mr. Chair,
I mov'e the Committee
adopt HB
28 as
amended
>> second by percent. Figure it off.
Ok. Is there
any, is there any
opposition to adopting that
to passing A B
28? Seeing
none?
Ok. We'll go
now to House Bill
29.
>> Sorry.
Um, House Bill 29
is the New Mexico Finance
Authority's Public Project revolving
Fund appropriations
bill. A second one. Again,
I'm carrying it on behalf
of the oversight Committee
which voted unanimously
to endorse the bill.
It appropriates a total of
13 million from the
public project revolving
fund. Again, it involves no
general funds.
It's 6 million to the drinking
water State revolving loan
fund held at NM
FA. It's used
as a State match for
two epa
capitalization grants,
2 million to the local
government planning fund
and 5 million to the
Cultural Affairs
Facilities
infrastructure fund
held at the Department of,
of Cultural
Affairs. Again,
the appropriations contained
in House Bill
29 do
not impact effect
or draw from the state's general
fund that we stand for
questions.
>> Thank you very
much
and there is not, we do not
have any amendments any additional
>> Mr. >> Chair?
Great. Thank you for that.
Is there are there any questions
on House Bill 29
represent Montoya, please.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
representative. I'm just
wondering why
if there has to be
on the other applications.
What's the difference between how
this this fund works
and the fund we just
heard
about
>> Mr. Chair representative,
there is a uh
source of funds that are
available in the, in the
P Pr F and
within the P Pr F, we
can make appropriations
to each one of those uh
specific programs.
Two of the programs are
located in in the house,
which is the Dr Water State
Revolving fund, which
we make loans out of
also the local government
planning fund, which we
provide grants
to local communities for
different types of plants
and then the 5 million to Culture
Affairs for their
appropriation. And
so these are funds that are
held within the, the P
pr F that we make
appropriations each
year. >> So
thank you, Mr. Chair.
Maybe I didn't ask the question.
Exactly right.
I'm just trying to understand why
the process is different. It doesn't
appear as
if the loans
have to be approved
or have to be
submitted by somebody that
follows the same process
and then it, and then
there's amendment attached
to this that says which
projects have been approved. I'm just
wondering why there's a,
the, the, the >> diff
Mr. uh Mr. Chair
representative. The difference is
there is a flow
through of cash in the P pr
F as we issue bonds.
And then there is a set
aside in a specific
account that we have
in that account, you know,
as we make uh um
money through interest
and payment, we could
take that money and allocate it
to a specific
fund. And this is
three allocations that we
make each uh each
year uh on a standard
basis. >> Thank you, Mr.
Chair. I'm not sure I still understand.
I might talk to you offline
to just educate me why
there's a difference in the
process. >> Great.
Thank you. Represent Montoya.
Happy to go into it, Miss Kzo
if you want to add anything. Always
good to sort of.
Yeah, >> Mr.
Chair Representative Manto, I think
I can clarify. So
the difference is um
this bill is not authorizing
loans, it's making
appropriations
from the revenues that go
into the P pr F.
Um The
statute allows
for appropriations
from that revenue
to go to seven designated
sources and
this bill authorizes
three of them. And essentially the,
the statute also
sets a limit on
the portion of
the GG RT revenue that
feeds the PR F
that can go out as appropriation.
So essentially,
there's cash going from this
revenue source into
the drinking water, State revolving
fund for State
match, uh the Cultural
Affairs Facility Fund.
And the other one this year
was local government
planning fund.
>> Thank you, Robert
Monto Lohan,
please.
>> Thank you. Thank you. Um
Maybe Miss Carwell might
want to come back up here, Mr.
Chair. And
so as I'm reading
this in conflict
duplication in comparison
relationship in our
fir
um
so Miss Kzo, we have
$30 million that
go as an appropriation
into those three separate funds.
Is that correct? And, but what
are the seven you
said?
Not mentioned, you mentioned
>> there's the top of
my
head.
So, and and
Mr. Brooks might be able to fill
in the rest. Another
eligible use is the
clean water State
revolving fund for these
appropriations. I
believe there's a fund
for State
parks.
Do you know the other two, John?
>> The other two is
for
that. I think it's
transportation
and also
for
all kinds.
>> You, Mr. Chair,
Representative Youth Conservation
Corps. >> Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So how much of
that $30 million
is going to these
projects or
that they're they're buying
for through the
application process.
What what is that
amount? >> Mr. Chair
Mr. Chair Representative
Lujan, the $13
million is not going for
any of the projects that were
listed. These these
$13 million are going to
these specific programs
that you see before
you. >> So
Mr. these are already decided
and so your
amendment
adds to everything.
>> There's there's no amendment
for this for
29. Sorry to
be clear. >> This >> is >> the
amendment to House >> Bill. That was
the amendment for House Bill
28. >> I
see.
Thank you Mr. Chair for that
clarification. So
then, and
we are on house Bill
28. Is that
correct?
>> We're on house
Bill.
>> Thank you.
Um
So
from that $30
million what we're
so this is a completely different bill
that than we just voted
through then I need
to adjust my vote for the
previous Bill, Mr. Chair.
Um I don't know if I can do that, but
thank
you.
>> Ok. Thank you representative
w work.
Ok. Uh Any other
questions on House Bill
29
>> Mr. Chair, I mov'e a due
pass on House Bill
29.
>> Is there a second
by,
is there any opposition
to a due
pass on House Bill
29
thing? And
that is adopted as well?
Ok. Thank you very much. Represent
Garrett.
Ok.
Uh Members in
consultation with the sponsor
who dedicated some of
the um
the grow funds
towards this process.
We can table House
Bill 52 as
amended again. A big
thanks to the sponsor
who worked with us and did a
lot of work on his own.
Uh Can I ask for a
motion to Table House Bill
52
second or is
mov'e 2nd
2nd by Representative Lohan? Any
opposition to that?
Seeing? No,
that's >> tabled Mr.
Chair. The
sponsor did want
for us to publicly
thank Amanda for
her support in
facilitating this.
>> We have that on the record
now on House Bill
130.
Uh
Sam Chatfield, we'll head
on it.
Ok.
Ok. Representative
Chatfield, great
to see you on House Bill
130. You
can talk us through the
amendment.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe
the amendment just strips the
appropriation. Ok. We
have amendment
0.228008
0.1. Is that what you
have
this German? I just signed
it but I don't have it yet. Ok.
We'll make sure you get
it.
I believe that's what it
does.
Ok. Can
we mov'e the amendment
for
discussion?
Moved seconded by
Representative
Garcia.
Ok. You clarified this
strips the appropriation
of Chatfield. This is in the budget,
correct? Yes, Mr. Chairman,
it is. Ok.
Ok. Any questions
on the amendment?
Is there any opposition
to adopting house appropriations
of finance amendment? None. Number
one to House Bill
130. See none
that's adopted.
Oh,
ok. We've adopted the
amendment uh
representative. Do you
want to explain your bill? Just
sort of go through it briefly
and then we'll go to public
comment.
>> Yes, Mr. Chairman, uh
this bill just uh
creates a cloud seeding
weather modification pilot
project in the New Mexico Department
of Agriculture.
It requires reporting
and it makes it an appropriation to
carry out that
activity.
>> Great. Thank you short and sweet.
Um Is there
anybody here who wishes to
speak in opposition to
uh House Bill
130?
Please come on up.
>> Thank you,
ma'am. >> If you could come just a bit
closer so we can pick you
up and just a bit to the
right, right in
there,
right. >> My name
is Sunol and I've
lived in
Espanola for 50
years in New Mexico for
58 and I'm a
concerned citizen,
not back
by a
group, but
um I did
contact
through a friend, a
meteorologist
for the Air Force who
said he has
some doubt about
the technical
ability of the person who wrote
the text. The
phrase to mitigate the effects
of climate change brings
my concern
that the person who wrote this
does not have a working
level knowledge of
atmospheric processes.
These are his words, not
mine. It
seems to be written in the
mistaken belief that
humans uh
control the
temperature of the earth.
He says that
um
attempting to
cede
um towering
cumulus clouds
much outside the summer
monsoon season
should not be
done. The
height of the monsoon season
is from the fourth of
July to the 12th of
September and
so seeable clouds are
unlikely to be
available outside that
time period. And the point
is that in order to see
clouds, you have to have
clouds, there
needs to be an experience
forecaster
in the,
>> ask you
to
just please conclude your thought
and then please
conclude your
thought.
>> The um
the effect effectiveness
of cloud seeding is still a
matter of debate and there
are concerns about its potential
environmental and health impacts.
According to a report by the
Wilson Center, cloud
seeding could upset
Rafiel patterns,
amplify or change
seasonal cycles, deplete
stratospheric ozone
and potentially
harm.
>> Thank you.
Now, we're going to go online
first. We're going to go to
Jennifer
Robbins.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and Members
of the House Appropriations and
Finance Committee. My name
is Jennifer Robbins and I'm speaking
to you this afternoon to strongly
oppose House Bill 130
on the cloud seeding pilot
program as a New
Mexico resident for nearly 18
years and a colledge educator.
I am highly concerned about the
risks that come with this water
modification program
and I am really concerned about
the inorganic compounds
like silver iodide which
are sprayed into the atmosphere
to create artificial
precipitation. I am
an individual who is highly sensitive
to metals and the water
modification studies done
so far are not convincing to
me that my health would not
significantly suffer from
exposure. The bill
also states that water
created by this artificial
means would be deemed part
of our natural water, which
I find to be fully misleading to
the public on its origins.
Cloud seeding ultimately
changes climatic patterns.
This means that places that
would normally receive
moisture can
start to experience drought
due to artificial processes.
And of course, we start to see the
atmosphere trigger
rainfall. But what happens
is there's no controlling
what types of weather form from
these processes. We have
seen globally devastated
flooding that has occurred
due to such methods of weather
modification. There have
also been documented failures
of programs already
historically, just look
to project storm fury. Please
conclude your,
yes, this is not to mention
weather events like
operation Popeye where
they use silver iodide, which led
to international regulation.
In conclusion, I ask that we look
for a more safe and effective means
to sourcing water that does not
pose greater risk than advantages
in this State. Please vote
now on HB 130.
>> Thank you. Ok. We're gonna
conclude with
Dave Pecos,
>> Dave
Trimmer.
Uh I wake
up,
>> oh, I see.
I'm just finding my
comment,
Marica, Members of the Chair and Members of
the Committee. Greetings to all.
Uh My name is David Valencia.
I'm a member of Youth United for Climate
Crisis Action. I'm
from Albuquerque, New Mexico District
six. I'm
speaking here to oppose HB
130. Uh It
seems to be a profit based
polluted, dirty energy
industry and
economic activity.
Oh, sorry about that. Profit
based polluted dirty energy
industry and economic
activity have never made
indigenous communities safe and
in fact, actively and
perpetually works against the health
and well being in these communities.
Cloud seeding programs are a
false solution to the climate
crisis. There is plenty
of uncertainty when it comes to this
technology as it risk impacting
our natural ecosystems and the public's
health, air pollution is
one of the primary concerns as there
are risk, there is a
risk of silver iodide
particles being released in the
atmosphere.
Um And furthermore,
uh please conclude your
thought. It just seems
like a yeah, it just seems like a
false solution. Uh
So yeah, I just urge all
representatives who claim to serve the
health of the people, especially
those most at risk to oppose
HB 130. But thank
>> you. Thank you very much.
OK. Now, uh
is there anybody who wishes to
speak and support here?
Please come on
it,
>> Mr. Chairman and Members of the
Committee, Tiffany Rivera with New
Mexico Farm and Livestock
Bureau. I want to thank the
sponsor for bringing this bill
forward. Um Cloud seeding
is something that our membership is
very interested in
and we appreciate the continued
effort by representative
Chatfield to allow these
pilots to be um
taken throughout the State. Thank
you.
>> Thank you very much, Mr.
Rivera. Ok.
Um ok, I
don't see anybody else. Uh I
want to note representative,
I guess your expert George
Bomar is
on our zoom.
Uh if
oh and
sorry on
zoom. Uh
is
Camila Romero to
speak and support.
Let's go back to you,
please.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair Committee
Members, Camila Romero with the new
Mexico State land office and the
land office, Stanton.
>> Ok, great. Thank you very
much.
Ok. Uh Mr. Bomar
is there is your expert. Do you want him to
add anything
>> Mr. Chairman? A brief statement
would be >> great. Fantastic,
Mr. Bear.
>> Yes, Mr. Chairman, can you hear
me? We can
Mr. Chairman Members of the
Committee? My name is George
Bomar. I'm a
meteorologist.
I worked for 45
years in developing
an extensive cloud seeding
program in Texas.
I've been working with the
Roosevelt soil and water
conservation district
to develop a cloud
seeding program to increase
rainfall from
thunderstorms that occurred
during the summer.
Uh A limited number of
seating events has taken
place in the last two
summers enough
to convince us that the
potential exists
to get substantially more
rainfall by using aircraft
to see the storms that
develop
research to date is
compelling that seeding
poses no environmental
risk and
there's no evidence suggesting
that cloud seeing
Robs Peter in order to
pay Paul. Thank
you. >> Thank
you very much Mr. Bomer.
Ok. We'll go to questions
from the Committee. We'll go
first represent Herndon, then represent
Luhan.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Mr. Presenter.
Um Could you please
just comment briefly,
how do you know that this
cloud seeding will work?
The your expert just
announced that there's been
substantial more rain
since the seating has
occurred currently.
So how much more substantially
more and how do we know
it won uh
misdirect weather
patterns?
>> So, Mr. Chair uh
representative,
this program has
been used
extensively in
seven of our surrounding
states for many, many years
and I will let the let
the expert go ahead and
speak a little more if you have
something to have
>> Mr. Bomar.
Yes, Mr. Chairman Members of
the Committee, George Bomar
again,
we have evaluated the
seeding that's going on in
Texas. That's summertime
seeing uh
over the last 25
years. And we've observed
an average increase
of 10 to
15%
in seasonal rainfall
that translates to
1 to 2 inches spread
over a target area
of several million
acres.
Much of the seeding that's done
in the Western United States
is for snowpack
augmentation
and the evidence
is even more
substantial that
that sort of seeding
amplifies
the uh
aggregation of snowfall
on mountain ranges which
eventually turns into
snowmelt.
>> Thank you Mr.
Expert and Mr. presenter.
Just one final follow up
question with respect to that.
So, looking at the increased
rainfall that has occurred
in Texas and maybe
in some other states,
uh there has been a
substantial decrease
in rain in New
Mexico. How do
we know that, that, that those
seedings did not adversely
affect New
Mexico
>> Madam representative. This is
George Bomar again,
the typical
movement of thunderstorms
is from southwest to
northeast and so
much of the seeding that's been
done in Texas
has impacted
storms moving away from
New Mexico.
And we have not
been able to see any
storms in New Mexico.
It's very reasonable to
think that
during the summer, you will have
storms moving
out of northern
Mexico into
New Mexico that could
be seated
and they are seated
normally 15
to 20 minutes once
they develop in a, appear on
radar. And
so using
aircraft, we're able to
pinpoint
precisely when and
where seeding material
is implanted
in the updraft
to ensure that the
rainfall
occurs within
the designated target
area, which
in this case would be in the
eastern plains of New
Mexico.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Mr. Thank you,
represent >> her representative,
please. >> Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Um
We've had a couple of discussions
about this Mr. Chair. Um and
I've been something I've been looking at
um as we are looking
at the
changing in our climate in our
climate crisis that we're
in. Um So some
questions and I'm trying
to get through the bill. Mr. Chair is
I'm gonna go, what are the,
what are the amounts
necessary
of silver
iodine needed
to raise
those
um
percentages in our rainfall?
I guess. First of all, what is
since we are in a drought
State
condition,
start out how,
how much
of this substance that we,
we need to use
for cloud seeding
and what would those
outcomes be for our
State Mr. Chair.
>> So Mr. Chair, I'm gonna let
my expert answer.
But first, I would like to say
it doesn't necessarily
require require
silver idy.
Sometimes they just use
dry ice, plain old dry
ice.
Uh So I'll let my
Mr. Bomar if you want to add,
>> please.
Yes, Mr. Chairman madam
Representative, this is George
Bear. We
are finding
very
recently that in the
summer time in the
semiarid Southwester
United States
that thunderstorms
are in greater
need of a
hydroscopic material
like the salts,
potassium
chloride,
uh uh sodium
chloride
rather than silver
iodide. And
we're seeing less
usage of silver
iodide, which is a
what we call a glaciogenic
material that is, it
helps to form ice
within the cloud
which attracts
cloud water and turns it
into raindrops.
Uh We're using less
A G I or silver
iodide and using more
of the salts because
they seem to be
more effective
in uh droughty
summers when you have
uh more scattered
uh thunderstorms
that
develop and
uh don't grow much
above the freezing level in the
atmosphere, which
is what you have to have in
order to be effective with silver
iodide.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um
So my concern is too and looking
at uh environmental
uh unintended consequences
as well with using uh
any, any kind of salt
substance or
uh
ingredients
to,
to hydrate our clouds,
so to speak, but then it would
dehydrate our landscapes
um and our, our
our uh flora
fauna and those things. So that
would be my question is
unintentional consequences
to further dehydration
of our soils and, and,
and our uh other
environmental
um
issues that, that
salts come
to, to come into question
for by doing this. So
what is the regulation?
How often would we be using
this Mr.
Chair?
>> So, >> go
ahead, Mr. Chair.
I think, first of all, I have
someone from the Interstate Stream
Commission that's President and
might be able to speak a little bit
about the
regulation.
>> Please. Come on up,
sir.
>> Good afternoon Chairman. Um
I'm Frank Scott with the New
Mexico Inters.
Good afternoon Chairman, I'm Frank
Scott with the new Mexico Interstate Stream
Commission. And we're
tasked with licensing weather
control modification in the State.
>> Ok.
Oh, prior to
100 and 20 days before
it
patient would have to
follow.
Thanks
you. It
alterations
sponsored
would
for in their application
if approved
the
>> Thank you Mr. Chair,
I
Mr. Chair in on page
two lines,
21
through 24.
The active cloud seeding pursuant to
project funds in whole
or in part by the State of New
Mexico or
a authorized by the State of New
Mexico Department of Agriculture shall
not be the basis of
any claim or liability.
Can you explain that Mr.
Chair in
regards to what you just said through the
application
process?
>> You
guys,
I just think it means what it
says. I mean,
it's pretty simple right shall
not be the basis of any
liability. It's been through the
permitting process. It's
gone through all the processes
of, of what we do.
It's not something that's
brand new. I mean, we've been doing
it for years and years.
We have not.
Seven other states have
been, uh
Texas is getting the
water it flows over. New Mexico,
goes to Texas
and uh anything I can
keep here I'll willing
to do so, >> Mr. Chair, I, I
wholeheartedly
respect your position
in, in trying to help us with
our arid climate
here in New Mexico.
Um I just,
I think I would just need some more
research and information on,
on this bill and see what it would
do and how those other states
are managing.
Or is this bill based
on what other states have in
statute? Mr.
Chair?
>> Uh I would refer that to
Mr.
>> Bomar.
Yes, Mr. Chairman
madam representative,
every, virtually
every State west of the
Mississippi has a
weather modification
statute
and virtually all
of them require a level
of insurability by
any individual or
organization
that might be doing cloud
seeding
over the last
70 years
when weather
modification or cloud
seeding has been
regulated.
Uh there have been a number of suits
filed. There has never
been an award
by a court of law to
anyone
who successfully
proved that he was
impacted
adversely
by a cloud seeding
project.
Nonetheless, there is
in the statutes, the
provision
that uh,
whomever is operating
either ground based generators
or aircraft, uh
has a degree of
insurability
that they would be able to
respond in a court of
law to a suit
should it be filed?
>> Thank you. >> Thank you, Mr.
Chair, I guess,
Mr. Chair, my Chair. My, my
question just goes to like
the unintentional
consequences of the use
of this and the accumulation
of salts and substrates
into the ground and soil.
And with that, uh uh
what that would cause
again, unintentionally is if
I don't see anything that's been
measured, I I couldn't find
anything from other states
um referring to
how they are managing
that information and that
data as we do
know in our State here, that
if you're flying around our
State and you, you know,
low, low areas
and you see uh
accumulation of salt
already where we, we're having
desertification
that is already happening. And I
don't know that this would be something that would
add to that and it's something that
we, we really need to look
into. I would need to look
into to, to fully
understand the
cause and effect, but it's
not something that I
is off the table, Mr. Chair.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. >> Chair
II. I believe my
expert
can
speak to the amount of
residue in the water
that hits the ground.
>> Uh OK, let's keep going
on. Yeah, if we could do that
offline, that would be great.
Um We're gonna go to Vice
Chair Dixon and then
represent.
>> Thank you Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Chatfield for presenting this.
Is there money in the
budget?
>> Yes, there is.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Representative
Chatfield, uh Mr.
Chair. Um since
you know that is our primary function,
I appreciate knowing that.
Um And thank
you very much other questions. >> Thank
you
Montoya.
>> Uh Thank you madam Chair
or Mr. Chair. Um
The your vice
Chair just asked my question
uh is whether or not
this was funded if there was
money for this? And
uh I see
energy environment
and natural resources will
vet it >> so
great. Thank. Thank you very
much. Uh Just
a brief uh I guess
a point and you mentioned this
representative Chatfield, this
is a three year pilot
program to sort
of that uh by
going through the Department of
Agriculture working
with N MS U.
We're gonna be
rigorously
tracking, uh what
goes up, what comes
down everything
associated with that for three
years. Is that
accurate
>> Mr. Chair? That is accurate.
I in the, I'm
not sure if the amount of funding
will last
uh three years, maybe it will, maybe
it won't. I, but
that is the intent. >> Yes, sir.
Ok. Thank you, Sam
Chatfield. I think that's helpful for
all of us as we see that
we're, we have a program
in place. We're gonna be able to
track as long as this money
is sufficient and
then we'll be able to come back. So
thank you for that. Uh
I don't see any other questions.
We'll go for a
motion
>> Mr. Chair. I would
mov'e a due pass
for
House Bill 130
is amended.
>> Ok. It's been moved by vice Chair Dixon
second by Representative Armstrong.
Is there opposition to
adopting that
motion?
Ok. Seeing none,
we've adopted House Bill
130 as amended. Thank you.
Representative.
Ok.
Um
Great to see Representative Herrera
here.
Come on
up,
come on down.
This is House Bill
148.
Mm.
Ok.
Uh Whenever you're ready, please
go ahead and tell us about
House Bill
148 and
introduce your expert.
We'll go from there.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you Committee and I
am House
Bill 148
is the annual water projects
fund projects
authorization bill
Uh my expert witness
today is Michael
Vonderheide and he is the uh
managing director
for public Programs
at the NM FA New
Mexico Finance Authority.
I'm carrying this bill on
ha on behalf of the NM
FA uh
um
the Oversight Committee which
unanimously endorsed the bill.
The bill authorizes the New Mexico
Finance Authority to make
grants and loans for water
projects from the water
project fund.
And I just want you to
know that in the last
15
years,
this bill bills like this
bill has passed unanimously
in both the House and the
Senate every single
year. So this is just kind
of a um
uh
you know, an automatic
thing that we have to take because
it's in statute before this
body every year.
Uh And I'm excited to
tell you this year.
Uh They approved a
list of projects to recommend
to you for funding.
Um
You know, they go through a
thorough evaluation
of the applications by
seven agency
review teams just so,
you know, and the final list
of projects includes 65
projects uh
totaling approximately
277
million. The
65
applications are made of
eight flood prevention
projects, seven water
conservation or treatment,
recycling or reuse
projects. 45 water
storage conveyance and delivery
projects and five
watershed restorations
and management projects. And with
that, I'll stand for questions.
>> Thank you very much for
Santa
and editor. Is
there, are there any questions
on the,
any of the
projects
represent Lohan. Go
ahead. >> Thank you.
Uh This, we did go over
this and this is what we do every
year and thank you for being the sponsor for
this year. But my question
is rel
relevance for dollars
um for the projects
that we have listed
for in this bill
and for what this fund
does and
a and a loan. Is it
a loan project? Mr.
Chair?
Are they loans
>> if you could explain the nature?
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee, Michael Vonderheide.
I'm the managing director of public Programs
as the sponsor mentioned.
Um So these projects
of these 65
projects, there is no appropriation
attached to this bill.
The funding does come from
severance tax bonds
and the water trust fund
distribution. I believe that's
currently 116
million or so. So
these are more projects
than we have available,
but it does allow the finance
authority to make grants and,
or loans to these
qualifying entities here. Should the
bill pass? >> Thank
you. Uh
And I'm just gonna make
mention II I totally support
this. This is something we need to do.
Um And I just want,
you know, just mention in, in the
previous bill we heard with NM
FA with House Bill
28 in regards to,
I mean, there's, there's just a lot of
duplication. I just think
we need to kind of get
a balance of everything that's going
out and how we're managing our,
our, our funding
and how we have that reflects in our
budget, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
>> Thank you very
much
Garcia Garso
Garcia. >> Thank
you, Chairman. Uh
What is qualifying who
qualifies?
>> What is I'll, I'll
leave that to an expert
>> Mr. Chair and, and
Representative Garcia,
any political subdivision
of the State would be a
qualifying entity for
Water Trust board
funding. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for the, for
the bill. You know, you know,
all the smaller communities
are struggling to qualify
for anything because number one,
they're uh
uh
they don't get paid for what they're
doing. And, you
know, a lot of our
smaller
uh communities don't have
the funding or the
know how matter of fact to get
these grants. And, you know,
this is good if we can help them
out to get
funding or
to educate him on how
to apply for grants.
Because if you don't have the capacity,
you're not gonna apply for it.
And if you do apply for it and you're
not quite aware of what you're
doing,
it. Thank
you, >> Mr. Chair and
Representative Garcia.
You're absolutely right.
But I want to tell you, the New Mexico
Finance Authority has done
amazing job
of trying to reach out and
help people small
governmental entities that you
and I work with, you know,
uh land
grants, mutual domestic
water systems, uh
small counties, small
governments and they
reach out and, and they can
come to them for a
planning grant under
the, I think the public
projects. Um
um
uh yeah,
uh
local government. So,
so we've been, we've
been working really hard to make
it easier for small
communities to get water
funding. It is. And,
and we've done that through an,
a series of
Legislation that will come up.
Do you remember
you as a
body recommended
another 100 million? So
this list of 100 and
65 instead of
just funding 100 and 50
million this year, you're gonna
fund 250
million, which will bring a lot
more smaller
uh projects that have
been approved into
getting paid this year and to
getting the money to do the actual
project, the,
the, the trust
fund that Representative
Armstrong took
this morning, the matching
fund is,
is gonna make a world
of difference. We've also got
Legislation going to
uh give the cogs more
money so that they can
have 400,000
a year for grant writing
and uh technical
assistance. So we
are just kind of doing a full
court press Representative
Garcia on helping
small rural communities,
the help they need to write the
grants. Maybe then
to even carry out the grants.
If you get a complicated grant,
it's hard to carry out. So
it's kind of a full court
press this year on
helping small
rural communities get
the help. They need to really get
these grants in the Hopper
and uh get them
through the uh the programs
that we have.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thanks for
that answer. You know, because, you know,
as well as I do,
these smaller utilities always
have a problem with compliance
or audits. And,
you know, it doesn't matter how much money
we give them on capital loudly, they
can't spend it because their audits are
always out of
whack. And,
you know, and I've
been here for eight years and I know some of
these uh places we're
trying to help are falling
further and further behind.
So if we could help these smaller people,
that would be really helpful. >> Great.
Thank. Thank you. Represent
Garcia. OK. Uh
Next we're gonna go to
or were you, was that?
Are you?
Ok, great. Excellent.
Represent Montoya, please. Thank
>> you, Mr. Chair. I don't actually have a question
but I think we skip public
comment.
>> Thank you, Representative
Montoya. Uh Is there
anybody who wishes to make
any comment on House
Bill?
148?
Thank you for that.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and Members of
the Committee. I'm a Baldonado
registered lobbyist for the New Mexico
Oil and Gas Association.
Uh No moga supports this bill
because it will allow the State to serve
communities by keeping up to date and
creating necessary water
infrastructure projects in
communities across New
Mexico uh for
projects such as water
conservation, flood
prevention, water
storage and watersheds. And
we extend our thanks to the sponsor
for bringing this bill forward. >> Thank
you. Great. Thank you very
much. Uh
Is there anybody online who
wishes to make comment?
See none.
Ok. With
that, we'll go for a
motion
>> Mr. Chair. I mov'e
that I mov'e
a due pass for
House Bill
148.
>> Ok. It's been moved by Vice Dixon
second by ranking member Armstrong.
Is there any opposition
to a due pass for House
Bill? 148?
Say none,
>> Mr. Chair. Can you show me
as abstaining from that
vote,
>> please?
Uh

and take the role for this
one.
>> Yes.
Yes,

Yeah.
Vice

>> I think we on
253.
Yeah, we'll ask
uh
representative
uh l thank you for coming back.
Chair. Come on
up. Uh
we're gonna get the amendment passed
out.
Ok? I think we're all passed out
Chairman. Thank you for coming back.
Sorry. Uh
We appreciate you coming
back and I'm proud
to be on this bill as well. All
right, >> whenever
you're ready, uh >> go ahead.
Thank you. >> Uh
The amendment has been passed out, but
if I May briefly explain
the bill and then we'll get to the amendment, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman House Bill.
253
proposes solutions to two
significant long term risks
to the State capital
Outlay program.
The first,
the risk of soaring debt
capacity poses
a risk to the
state's bond rating.
And secondly, long
term oil and gas revenue
declines that
could jeopardize the state's ability
to make new investments in capital
projects and protect
its existing needs.
That second problem is
tied to the fact that capital
outlay is the state's most
reliant program on oil
and gas revenues
in many years. Nearly 100% of
our capital outlay is reliant
on that industry. And though
the legislature has taken steps
to insulate the
general fund from oil and gas
volatility in, in the
general fund, we
have no backup plan at all
regarding the state's capital outlay
program. How
the bill protects the state's bonding
rates. Is that house bill
253 proposes
amendments to the Severance tax
Bonding Act that will
tie annual long term
debt capacity to
median debt ratios.
This will constrain the level
long term debt the State
takes on each and every year to
pay for capital
projects to prevent
the State from being
overleveraged in the event of
an oil decline. And
to put us more in line with national
norms for measures like debt
per cap per cap per capita,
excuse me and debt to
personal income.
These constraints would still preserve
significant levels of bonding
capacity and far
more than ever has historically
been available.
If the legislature moves
toward a blended formula
funding model for capital
outlay, utilizing
the bonding program, some
amount of general fund and
this new source created in
this bill, it can likely
sustain the levels of of
capital outlay spending
uh of the last couple of
years. How the
bill bill, how the bill will
build long term resiliency
for the capital outlay program.
House Bill 253
also includes mechanisms to
turn today's
surpluses into
future recurring revenues
dedicated to capital outlay
programs. It
does it by distributing the
savings from the reduced
long-term bonding
capacity to a new
fund dedicated to capital
outlay. This fund
would then become the quote
backup plan for
capital as oil and
gas revenues
declined and
reduce pressure on the general
fund to become
the in fact replacement
source, the fund
will spin off about 5%
each year starting immediately
to be appropriated by the
legislature for capital
projects. And with
that, Mr. Mr. Chairman,
I May, if I May speak to the
amendment, please. Thank
you the amendment
in this bill or actually >> sorry,
we'll mov'e the amendment. Thank
you, Vice Chair. If you can mov'e the amendment
for discussion. >> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I would mov'e House Appropriations
and Finance Committee amendment
one which is
0.227891
0.4.
>> Is there a second?
Ok. It's been by ranking member
Armstrong. Please
go ahead and discuss. Ok.
>> That is the, the amendment that I have in
front of me. The amendment
authorizes the Board of
Finance to convert any
excess cash
available in the severance
tax bonding fund
at the end of fy
24 into
a one time
distribution to the new
reserve fund.
This would come from one
time, one time
savings generated
by using general fund for
capital outlay this
year. This could
potentially provide it
with the jumpstart of hundreds
of millions of dollars.
It would also only do
so after
other authorized issuances
of the bonds are
made. The amendment
also makes several technical
changes suggested by the Board
of Finance which
we can discuss in more
detail if that's the pleasure of the
Committee. And with that, that is our
amendment. Thank >> you very
much uh Chairman,
um great explanation
and thank you for explaining the
amendment. Are there any
questions on the
amendment?
I don't see any. Is there
any opposition to
adopting House Appropriations
and Finance Committee? Amendment? Number
one?
Ok. We
have an amended bill.
Um Is there anybody
who wishes to speak uh
in opposition to House
Bill?
253?
I don't see anybody, anybody
online.
Ok. Anybody here who
wishes to speak in
support.
Ok. And
online.
Ok. Uh Don't
see anybody. So
we'll go now to the Committee.
Are there questions from
Members?
I'll ask a couple
quick questions. Uh
Chair uh
Chairman Lente.
Um this
as you explained, this
sort of resing your explanation.
You're, you're
building a fund
here um
that will serve
our capital needs far
into the future. Is that
accurate? >> Yes,
Mr. Chairman accurate. Great.
>> And miss, you're also
at the same time
ensuring that we don't
sort of spend all
the way to the limit of the debt
capacity that's been created
by the very large
production boom
while still allowing
uh as you
said again, in your opening,
really strong amounts. We've
chosen not to use
that bonding the last couple
of years, even
as we pass your bill
in the bill that I'm proud to be part
of, we would still have
the ability to use some of
that capacity,
as you said, in a blended
manner with General Fund or other
sources, Mr.
Chairman. Correct? Ok,
great. II
I don't
see if there's any other questions.
I just maybe then I
would just say I want to
thank you and the team
at LFC for your
leadership. I'm proud
to sign on and support this.
It is in keeping with
our financial
decisions over the last
several years, making sure that
we have enough to
do what we need now,
but very much planning
and investing for a future
that could look very different and
making sure that we
avoid some of the past
mistakes that
um you have to really
pay for over and
over again in the future. So I want
to compliment you
uh and with that,
um let's go
ahead.
Oh, Representative Brown, I
talked to go
ahead.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
Chairman
Lente,
ok. So this is the first
I've heard of this and
so I just have to ask
a few questions.
So Mr. Chair, we have
$3.5 billion of
extra revenue this year, we had
nearly that same amount last
year and this proposal
is to bond
$500
million.
So
Mr. Chairman and and
Chairman
Lente,
I'm not sure this is
really justifiable given
all the extra revenue this is
creating looks like long
term debt,
pretty massive debt.
Um
At what what I
mean?
Not really sure and perhaps
uh >> can
uh thank you.
Uh uh
Chief Economist
Torres.
>> Yeah. Ok.
I apologize Mr. Chair.
So I, I was
just, again, I'm just seeing this for
the first time I was in another Committee
as you were to Chairman
Lancy trying to get a bill heard.
And so I just, I did, I just
scanned this and perhaps too
quickly. So now
I get it. Thank >> you.
Thank you very much.
Ok. We'll
go for a motion
>> Mr. Chair. I would mov'e
a due pass for
House Bill
253
as amended.
>> Ok. Is there a
2nd
2nd by Representative De La
Cruz? Uh Is there
any opposition to that
motion
seeing? No, thank you
very
much.
Ok. Uh Now we're
gonna go
to
House Bill
232
ok, by Sarah whenever you're
ready.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair um
House Bill
232
as amended, um
creates the
infrastructure planning
and development division
uh within the Department of
Finance and Administration.
And this is the bill that was
crafted in the interim
uh between LFC
and D FA um
based on I think extensive
feedback um over
many years uh
from Members of the
legislature.
Um So
what um
House Bill 232
does is
it create, it moves
certain infrastructure
and capital related functions
of the local government
division to
the infrastructure
planning and development
division. Uh The
rural equity ombudsman
and local government
infrastructure capital
improvement plan.
Functions of
L GD would mov'e to the
new division along
with other short or long
term programs.
And this funds
and funds of other
divisions of D FA is
as determined by
the Secretary.
Um the
whole point of the
infrastructure planning and development
division is
to provide assistance
to local governments,
councils of
governments and
um tribal
governments in identifying
and accessing funding
for infrastructure development
from available sources
and administering
funding to complete
capital projects
and providing guidance
to project plans and
developments. Um
This bill fills a
critical function and a
gap that has
existed in the State for
many years.
Um My
expert is
Callie Carwell from
LFC
and I think we would stand for
questions. >> Great. Thank you
very much. Uh Is there
anybody here who wishes to speak
in opposition to House Bill
232?
See nobody online.
Anybody here who would like to speak
in support of House Bill
232
Kate.
Uh and we, yeah,
Mr. Billingsley,
please,
>> Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee,
Wesley Billingsley, local government
division director and
capital bureau chief.
Um We the Executive
do stand in support of this
division. Um I think, you
know, we would like to see
a division where we can
track capital projects from
beginning to end and I think this division
will do that in the future.
>> Thank you. Great. Thank you and
thank you for your work on the
effort. Ok.
Are there any questions?
Uh I, I don't see anybody who
wishes to speak online
there. Any questions uh
from the
Committee?
I don't see any. Uh I
would go for a motion then
on House Bill
232.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I mov'e
that house bill
232
as amended
do now pass?
>> Ok. It's been moved by
ranking Armstrong saying by
Representative Brown, is there any
opposition to that
motion? Seeing
none?
Ok,
Sanchez.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair Committee.
So how still
270 does is
uh seeks additional funding
nonrecurring for the state's
technology enhancement
fund. The Higher
Education Department manages the
spending of the monies from this fund
by statutory requirement.
Uh The state's economic development
department plays a role,
advisory role in the use of the
monies. The fund
was created in 2003
had no appropriations
until
2023.
The main purpose of the fund is
to supply available stream
of State matching funds for large
federal grant applications
involving collaborative
research proposals,
better positioning the
State of New Mexico as a research
leader. Um I have
a whole page of uh items,
but I'm not going to read those basically this
fund. Um
our three universities, New
Mexico State, uh
New Mexico Tech. And then
MS U use this funding to get
large grants, uh federal
grants. And
we, we desperately need this
money to keep, to keep our
schools uh
competitive with other
states and other
universities.
Uh I myself,
I'm a electrical
engineer. I went to UN M I got my
bachelor's master's. So
I firsthand understand how
important this is as
well as working at Los Amos National
Laboratory. Our schools
really need this to have
a advantage to
a compete with
other states. Uh
Mr. Chair and we do have an
amendment um that's
actually gonna
strip the appropriations
language and also
um clar
clarify some wording. I'm sorry, Mr.
Chair. So I don't know if you want to
hand that out. >> Yeah, let's go
ahead. We'll get that handed
out. Oh,
it's already out.
Ok.
Um We have
0.228057
0.1
Mr. Chair. That's correct. Ok,
great. Can we mov'e
that amendment for
discussion?
Ok. It's been moved.
Is there a second?
Ok. It's been seconded.
Um
And uh
representative, you
explain this strikes the
appropriations
and also adds
in um
clarifies some language.
Yes, >> it just takes out a few
words from uh
page
uh
it's going to page
three.
>> Ok. >> Also Mr.
Chair, I just want to
clarify that there is $10
million in the budget going across.
And also uh we're gonna be
seeking additional funds in the
Senate. So I just
wanna answer that before the
question gets asked. You got
>> it, got it out
there. Thank you very much.
Ok. Are there any questions
on the amendment?
Uh
Herndon >> First
Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr.
President. There is one
error in the amendment
because there should be uh
line 14 on page
one. There should be
a amendment taking out the
word, making an
appropriation.
No.
>> Yeah, we we're
getting, we're
in, in coordinate.
Yeah, in
most cases, yes, not
in this case. >> Why
is this one different Mr.
Chair?
This
>> great, thank you,
Representative Herndon.
Our, our chief of staff uh
informed us that
because this is a
fund that needs to be
able to make appropriations
that it's the authorizing
of that fund and the language
around the fund. It needs
to have making an appropriation
for that fund to then be
operational. >> So thank
you Mr. Chair for that
>> clarification. Great question.
Thank you for that question,
Figueroa.
>> Thank you Mr. Chair. My
question is why I strike
the language around
workforce education
and training on page three line
six. >> Mr.
Chair representative.
Uh we didn't want to
complicate the bill and I know
some departments
asked to have that language
removed. So that's the
purpose.
>> Thank you Mr.
>> Chair.
Thank you. Represent
Fido. OK.
Any other questions on the
amendment.
Any opposition to
adopting house amend
House Appropriations and Finance
Committee amendment one to
House Bill
