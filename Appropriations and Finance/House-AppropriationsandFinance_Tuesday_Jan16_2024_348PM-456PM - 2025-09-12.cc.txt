Thank you.
Testing testing.
Webcast capture.
Work with them. Okay, Great. Uh,
okay. Thank you to our staff
very much for addressing that
Represent. Pettigrew will want
to go back to you. Thank you
again for your indulgence.
Thank you. Chairman and
Um
Technology is fun, isn't it?
And so
Let me back up for a SEC
Chairman if you don't mind.
Let me ask you question with
respect to the feed Bill.
They will give you $100 for the
feed bill.
Covers every everything in
there.
And at the end of the year, you
only spent 75 what happens to
the other $25 chairman. Uh Mr
Versi Aga.
Thank you, Mr Chairman and
represented Pettigrew.
Just to make sure I understood
your question. You wanted to
know.
Of the amount appropriated in
the feed bill.
Any unexpended balance. Question
is what happens to it at the end
of the fiscal year? Yes, sir.
Okay.
There are
Two parts to defeat one is the
appropriations for the
legislative session. That is all
of Section one.
That's those are the House and
Senate expenses for per diem
mileage session staff and the
like.
There is also
In your feet. Bill House Bill
one on Page five.
Section four. Those are also
appropriations to the
legislature.
For the interim that includes
interim expenses pre session for
next year.
An intern program.
Dudes for, um
Organizations to which we
belong.
The legislative information
Systems. Senate Rules Committee.
And Capitol Buildings Planning
Commission.
Any appropriation to the
Legislature, the institution
If any of that amount is not
expanded at the end of the
fiscal year that goes to
legislative cash balances.
That's a separate
Uh,
Amount that goes into the
Treasury. It's known as
legislative cash balances. It
can only be used by
appropriation.
So even if there's money left
over
I can't spend it. Lfc can't
spend it.
Council cannot direct me to
spend it has to be appropriated.
Everything else that you see in
the feed bill that are the year
round operational expenses for
the council service.
Loc L E S C. The House chief and
House and Senate chief clerk's
offices and leadership staff.
At the end of the fiscal year of
that money is not expended that
reverts to the General fund.
Thank you, Speaker. And thank
you, Mr Bursey, Aga for that so
With respect to that.
Chairman.
How much
What is the existing legislative
cash balance?
Mr Chairman and
Represent Pettigrew and members.
I believe currently about the
legislative cash balances has
approximately $6 million in it.
I would with the permission of
the chair, and the committee
explained that
Legislative cash balances as I
mentioned is used.
For is, um
Has to be appropriated.
So
Rather than the Legislature
don't know how else to put it.
Competing.
For capital outlay. Funding that
legislative cash balances is
often used for capital upgrades.
And replacement and the like. So
this last year, we used
legislative cash balances to
update upgrade the committees
with new mix new screens in the
light.
If we get carpet if we get
furniture
If we reconfigure offices like
we did how the House and Senate
leadership offices all that
comes out of legislative cash
balances again. It gets
appropriated.
We are in the process of looking
of updating the H back.
In the in the building.
And other
Construction repair, etcetera
that gets done in this capital.
That is
Ah! Ah reviewed and approved by
the Facilities Review
subcommittee, which is made up
of the speaker of the pro TEM
and the
Four leaders, Um
House and Senate majority
Minority leaders.
Thank you, Chairman. And thank
you, Mr Bursey. I go for the
lesson. I think I have one more
question with respect to that.
So when you say appropriated,
that means it has to be voted on
by 112 people.
Mr Chairman represent Pettigrew.
That's correct, and usually
those capital upgrades are put
in special.
Special appropriation Section
five of the thank you, chairman
and thank you, Mr Bursey Aga, so
I needed to step back and
recapture that.
And so
Mr Chairman with respect to non
session expenses.
I have several different line
items in here.
The kicker for me, chairman.
The difference between the 2020
to 30 Day session in the 2024
proposed the 74.3%
Increase from almost 4.1 million
to a 7.1 million.
Can we highlight some of the key
factors in there?
Looks like one of them, maybe
information systems and some
other things like that. But, uh,
travel expenses for interims
Looks like it went from a
million to 3 million.
Um
Yeah.
Mr Chairman and Mr Bursey Iago.
Could you just kind of capture
those thoughts?
Certainly, Mr
Chairman and represent
Pettigrew. You're correct that
if you look at the
Non session expenses.
Interim only, for example,
legislative interim expense went
from 1 million to 3 million.
I would like to point out that
Because that's a year round
expense. I would be more
focused. I would ask that that
you look at
Uh, the FY 24 appropriation.
Last year, interim expenses went
to $4 million This year. We
brought it down to 3 million
The reason it increased those
substantially from 1 to 4.
million is because we were in
the middle of litigation.
We had the redistricting
lawsuits.
We have several other lawsuits,
one on Oprah.
Right now. We've got another
lawsuit on the environment.
There's a constitutional
amendment constitutional
provisions about guarantee mean
That, uh, the state
Use.
The extraction and use that for
the benefit versus protecting
the environment. That lawsuit is
going on.
Because redistricting is over,
We felt that we were able to
drop that from 4 million to 3
Million, so that's actually
decrease for about 25%.
But we did have
Legislative information systems.
We've really tried to upgrade
not just what we have here, but
we've also tried to create a lot
of the cyber security.
And we have a number of
firewalls and the like to
protect that, so that's been
significant.
From 1.7 in FY 22 to 2.7 now.
But really, it increased from
2.1 to 2.7 from last fiscal year
to this fiscal year. Those seem
to be the biggest jumps one
other one well that those seem
to be the biggest ones.
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you,
Mr Bursey. Aga, I'll pass it on
to somebody else. Thank you.
Thank you very much represented
Pettigrew. We actually have
represent dela Cruz and
Representative Garrett and we
have others.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
We're here that this is more of
a statement. Hopefully somebody
for consideration as we move
into the future.
All of the legislators here at
the table are
Have incredible responsibility,
billions of dollars that were
responsible for
The Legislature is a whole again
the amount of money that we have
to deal with for a wide array of
things that impact new Mexicans
the citizenry in general.
And what I would like.
For people to consider,
especially the citizenry that
can see this podcast or
broadcast.
That we are all volunteers. I
can't tell you, Mr Chairman. How
often people think, man you guys
in the Legislature must really
make the big well, I got here in
22.
And at that time we were being
paid for the up about 150 bucks
a date.
And with that 150 bucks a day in
Santa Fe, New Mexico, and not a
cheap place by the way.
Mr Chairman, you have to find
lodging.
You have to find food. You have
to take care of your fuel offer
100 and $50 a day and the folks
are up here.
There may be some that are
independently wealthy. I don't
know. I'm not one of them If
there are some here
But they come from all walks of
life, Mr Chairman.
And this is an incredible
burden if you're coming from the
farthest corner corner of New
Mexico.
Northeast doesn't matter where
you come the miles and miles and
leaving homes and jobs and
businesses.
And we got a raise.
We are no longer to $50 191
dollars. I think we've got a $41
raise.
And
What the state does is it? It
uses the federal government per
diem but understand this because
I was a government worker. I was
a career government worker. We
used to get paid per diem who
went out of town.
But we also got our salaries.
Now I'm not advocating for a
salary.
Remember what I would like
people to consider in the
citizenry out there and the
leadership both in the House.
In the Senate.
And
In the executive
Is that
It is an incredible burden and
privilege to be here, but at the
same time, it shouldn't be so
difficult My first year at the
Legislature by office meeting, I
will not see the name of this
young woman.
Had a child with her every day
in that office.
Because it was too difficult for
her.
To be able to have that child
somewhere else.
So she had her with her in our
office, and I thought it was
great. It was fine, but I
thought to myself something just
doesn't seem right to me.
We should be paid something that
is more reasonable that
approximates reality, which, by
the way, folks
It also includes our dry
cleaning, because it's not
optional. You have to wear a
suit tie.
It's not optional. We are
expected to look professional
and represent wealth.
I'm gonna start there. Mr.
Chairman. I think everybody gets
the picture. I really asked for
that consideration for all of
our folks in the Legislature.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you Represent Garrett, please.
Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you, Representative Dollar
Cruise. That's a good argument
for salaries because you can't
really raise a per diem. My
question. Um, Mr Chair is
Um, 35. This is Page six F for
the interim duties of the Senate
Rules Committee. So that and my
correct and understanding that
there isn't a regular interim
Senate Rules Committee. Can you
just explain that?
Mr Chairman, Representative
Garrett. That's a good question,
But the Senate rules Committee
is the only rules committee that
meets in the interim, but it's
as made it
It's not necessarily they don't
set days and have meetings. They
may as required by if there
needs to be at appointment
approved or
Go ahead and Mr Brush Iago will
elaborate. Mr Chair.
I would. I would add. Um, Mr
Chairman representing Garrett.
Is that
The Senate Rules Committee is
actually authorized to meet in
the interim through the
Constitution.
It's specific to allow them time
to consider.
Any appointments to boards and
commissions.
That are being nominated so that
when they come into session
A lot of that will have been
bettered. Lot of those
individuals will have been
vetted and then they can move
more quickly to the Senate
floor.
Thank you. That's very helpful.
My second question Mr Chair is
on the non recurring 23 to 24.
the feasibility study for
district staff offices and
operations. The original
allocation was 2,500,000. Can
you explain the status of that
fun today?
Mr Chairman, Representative
Garrett.
The total expenditure for that
was in the neighborhood of 3 to
$400,000.
So
Uh huh.
That that particular
appropriation
Is completed. There's it was
specific to that study. Nothing
else can be done with it.
Uh,
We do have them on contract
Still in the event that some
committee would like them to
come in and and present to
testify before any committee,
house or Senate during this
session.
Uh, but if they don't that money
won't be used and that again
because it's part of what was
appropriated to the Legislature
would revert to cash balances.
Thank you. And if you can give
us an update after the session,
that would be helpful. Thank you
very much.
Thank you Represent Garrett.
We're gonna go next to
represented. Chatfield then
represented Brown.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
On page
Five.
Legislative interim. I know you
said something about this a
while ago, but I didn't
understand it. So that's why I'm
asking Page five.
We dropped
224 to 225 legislative interim
expenses a million dollars.
What happened?
Mr Chairman, representative
Chatfield.
In 2020 to $1 million was
appropriated for interim
expenses. A number of things
happened Number one. We had a
number of lawsuits in process.
The number of authorized, um
Travel for both for legislators
and extra committee. Days
increased, so we were getting
close. It was the lawsuits
primarily that concerned us so
from 2022 to 2023, we increase
it from 1 million to four.
Okay after redistricting has was
done that particular lawsuit and
we're done with that.
Uh, we felt we were better off
dropping it down to $3 million.
We still have some lawsuits
pending, but we still have a lot
of travel out of state
organizations as well as interim
committees.
Now I understand it. Thank you.
Second question.
Personal services and benefits
up 29%. We talked about that a
little bit.
And when I When I look at that,
I think about
The LFC.
And all the wonderful people
that help us in the interim.
I think about Legislative
Council service and the great
job that you all do.
I think about
House appropriations.
And I think about Senate finance
so
Did we come to some kind of
consensus?
So that the people
According to their time spent
here.
And the expertise.
That they have.
Are paid.
Appropriately and fairly across
the Mr Chairman, representative
Chatfield. That's the pay band
issue that
We have begun to take a look at
We don't want to just
Keep salaries stagnant and lose
these folks who helped us so
much to other state agencies,
And we're looking at trying to
pay for not only, um
Hmm. Years of experience but
actual expertise as well and I,
and that is contemplated to
continue. And I'm gonna let Mr
Bursey I've explained it.
Thank you, Mr Chairman and
representative, um
As leader, Casey was mentioning,
Um, leadership has instructed
The
Three directors, the two chief
clerks and the Chiefs of staff
for the leadership officers to
discuss
The pay band issue what we call
a classification compensation
plan. Long story Short is the
only time that pay bond was
increased was whenever the
Legislature provided across the
board raises.
So
From 2008 when the reception
recession hit to the present.
It would only increase by 1%
here. 3% there five or 6% more
recently when we had more money,
but it really did not keep up
with inflation or cost of living
or cost of labor indicators. So
we had one of our fiscal analyst
Clinton Turner in our office
doing assessment.
And
Yesterday at the Legislative
Council meeting in this room,
the council instructed us to
continue working on that to come
back after the session to the
Legislative Council, too most
likely, uh, present an expanded
compensation plan so that, uh,
legislative staff could be, uh
Compensated accordingly and that
we would have a better we would
be in a better position for
recruitment and retention. Um
So that that's what we've done
with that. And so the increases
that you see for
Three.
Committees to cheap clerks,
which includes the leadership
offices. Those of increased on
average between about 8 to 11%
lfc a little higher because
they've got some more staff.
Ours was a little higher as well
by the 11% because we're hiring
a little bit more staff.
But yes, all of that is
reflective of
Adding staff and compensating
them accordingly.
So, Mr Chairman.
Do we know
How much we're gonna raise Each
of those positions or we're just
increasing it by 29%. And we're
gonna
It out after the session. I
mean, which which is it, Mr
Chairman and represent
Chatfield know what we're doing
is we're
Increasing the pay bond.
Yes.
We have been instructed by the
council to come back to the
Legislative Council with
recommendations on hiring
guidelines for what it pays
staff when they start
What you pay staff.
Who have been here a long time
Legislature might give across
the board. Absolutely, Mr
Chairman, and I don't think
anybody could deserve it more
who gets to go to that meeting?
The Legislative Council. Any
member of the Legislature? It's
a public meeting.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you
very much represented. Chatfield
represent brown, please.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. And, um
I just have a couple of
questions, um, when it comes to
the Capitol Buildings Planning
Commission, Mr Chair, we see
that
Proposal here is for another
$100,000 for the 2024 request.
Could you tell us, please? What?
Mr Percy Aga assume what is
being done by the commission and
why the extra 100,000? Thank
you, Mr Chairman and represented
Brown.
The Capitol Buildings Planning
Commission is a statutory
commission. It is
One of the few that has
representatives from all three
branches.
There are four legislators on
that commission is usually the
speaker, the pro TEM and the two
minority leaders.
It also includes the secretaries
of G S. D.
And D F a
Transportation.
And one cultural affairs. It
also includes the state
treasurer, the Supreme Court
Justice.
And I'm probably forgetting one
or two others.
What they do is they're
responsible as a statute lines
out.
To do master planning for three
cities, primarily
Albuquerque, Santa Fe in Las
Cruces, Because that's where so
many of the state buildings are,
and they want to make sure that
they do master planning.
Um, to find out where staff is
going to be housed.
In addition to that, my
understanding it is the only
commission through its
contractor that has a complete
inventory.
All state buildings and all
state properties, whether
they're owned by the state, or
whether they're leased by the
state.
And we've been updated when I
say we we stabbed the committee,
but we have a contractor
Architectural research
consultants.
That updates that information so
we know how many employees are
where and how it fits in with
the master plans for those three
cities and the state.
As well.
And statewide.
Mr Chairman, Um
Leader chasing and Mr Bursey
August, So thank you for that.
Is this commission working on
the proposed executive new? The
new executive
Mr Chairman and representative,
the Executive office building
was actually approved by
statute.
Close to 15 years ago.
Uh, it was not built partly
because of the recession.
The lack of funds. It had been
put off for quite a while.
It is not the ultimate
Uh um, decision maker on whether
or not the deal be executive
office building gets built.
Because it's already in statute
that really has been up to the
executive. However, the capital
Billions Planning Commission has
had a number of updates.
From, uh
GSD staff.
I should say more specifically
Facilities Management division
staff.
On that process, so they're
aware of it, and they have
endorsed it.
But they have they're not the
ones to decide whether or not it
gets built because it's already
in statute. It's usually up to
the executive.
Okay. Thank you for that, Um
Mr Chairman, I also have a
question, I guess for Mr Bursey
Argo on the national news and
membership fees.
I know we pay for the National
Council of State Legislatures.
Could you just detail quickly?
What the other
Uh,
Groups are that we
Mr Chairman and representative.
The
Do that We pay our to the
Council of State Governments.
National Conference of State
Legislatures National Conference
of Insurance Legislators
National Council of Legislators
from Gaming states, the Energy
Council and the Education
Commission of the States.
And those are annual dues. Okay.
Um, thank you, Mr Chair. And Mr
Bursey August. So, um, that's a
pretty long list. Do we have
some that have very little
participation from our
legislators. I know NCSL is
probably in my mind. The big
one. What about those other
ones? If you could just give us
a little bit of a breakdown,
please, Mr Chair.
Mr Chairman and representative,
we We have a lot of legislators
that attend.
Legislators and legislative
staff that attend NCSL
conferences.
Also mostly legislators attend
council state governments.
The ones that are
Less attended would be the
National Conference of Insurance
Legislators and National Council
of Legislators from Gaming
states.
Those are roughly $25,500,
respectively.
The Energy Council. We have
quite a bit of representation on
that.
And the Education Commission of
the States. Uh, I think we're
allowed to legislators on there.
And in addition to that staff
from the L. E S C, attends those
as well the ones that are
probably least
Tended.
I think would be the National
Conference of Insurance
Legislators and National Council
legislators from gaming state,
Mr Chair. Maybe there could be
some cost savings there if we're
really not attending them, and
then finally Mr Chairman and
leader chasing and Mr Bursey
Iago, um did the full
legislative finance Committee.
Uh,
Decide on this.
Particular, um, proposed budget.
Um
And in particular, the 29%
increase was the full committee
involved is the question
Mr. Um
Chairman, representative.
Lfc recommendation. That's
before you is slightly different
than
These are adjusted.
Mr Chairman and Mr Silly. What
does that mean? That means Mr
Chairman that, um Lfc was not
presented fully with the
proposal for the additional
staff, and that's something that
has been
Worked out, um, before the
session, too.
Recommend adding into the LFC
budget.
And so, Mr Chair and Mr Psyllium
So lfc was. I'm sorry. I'm I
want to make sure I get this
right LSC.
Did not weigh in on this or how
much much input or any at all on
this one. The LFC recommendation
was to increase the LFC budget
by
5%
And then there were additional
considerations that were
Brought during before this
session to be included in the
feed bill because they wanted to
expanded services that
The pay bond issue was closer to
being settled. Well, thank you,
Mr Chair. Thank you.
representing Brown. We're going
to go next to represent of
Sanchez.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I just
wanted to make a quick
statement. Um
The separation of powers depends
on us funding our own branch of
government, and we're always
taking care of all these other
agencies and, uh,
I think we need to take care of
our own legislative employees. I
just wanted to make that
comment. Thank you. Thank you
Represent Sanchez represent
Herndon. Do you have a question?
I do, Mr. Chair? Uh, and
presenters. Mr. Got just wanna
clarification to make sure I'm
understanding because you use
terminology interchangeably here
and I want to understand what
you mean. Sometimes you use the
term 2024 request. Sometimes you
use it as a fiscal year.
And so what is the difference?
Tell me why that difference in
terminology on these documents.
So if I look on Page one, for
example, at the top, you talk
about the 2024 request. If I go
down further you talk about the
fiscal year of 2024. So tell me,
what is the difference in terms
of these amounts and
And what does it mean? If you
could help me to understand
that?
Thank you, Mr Chairman and
representative Herndon.
The session expenses.
For this 30 Day session or for
cattle or for the 2024 session.
So section one of this bill,
which is pages one through
Roughly page four.
Oh, that is for just session.
House Senate and Legislative
Council service. All of the
staff that we hire, um for that
time.
The rest of the appropriations.
Are for fiscal year 2025 that
begins July 1.
There are some exceptions, for
example.
The $2.7 million for I t
equipment.
We do that for both fiscal year
2024 and 2025.
The reason for that is because
if we don't get a head start on
ordering that equipment
We're still dealing on occasion
with supply chain issues.
And we want to. We simply want
to get a head start on that.
The same thing with the, uh, the
dues for the national
organizations.
Um, I think we do that for both
fiscal years because on
occasion, one of those usually
ends yourself uniform law, CSG
might come back and say we gave
you this amount, but actually,
we need
500 more 2000 more something
along those lines, so we just
make sure that we can expand it.
For
The two given fiscal years. But
in short the session expenses
are during fiscal year 24 that
we're in now.
And the rest of it is
operational for fiscal year 2025
Thank you, Mr Chair, and Mr
Berger, For example, If I look
at Page three
And I look at, um her DMX.
For House of representatives,
and it says that there is it
used. This is the term
appropriated for 788 guess that
million. Or is that thousands?
Not sure? And then they talked.
It reduces it comes considerably
before 101.
1001 100.
So I'm looking at Page three of
this document stuff in it.
And it says in its a request, as
opposed to a fiscal year.
Okay. Thank you. Mr Chairman and
representative.
Yes. So
What we have is
At the For the first column.
what was requested what was
actually spent.
Out of the 2022 appropriation.
That's that. FIRST column The
second column is what was
appropriated and the 2022
regular session.
The next one is what was
actually appropriated. 2023
session and the last column is
what we are requesting today.
For this 2020 during this 2024
session.
So thank you And Mr Chair and Mr
Bursey, I got just a
clarification for me. But why
such a big drop?
And per diem for the, uh, Mr
Chairman and representative
The drop from 23 to 24 because
we went from a 60 day session to
a 30 Day session, Okay?
Thank you for that
clarification.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you.
Representative Herndon. We're
going to go now to
representative Garcia.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you. Presentation. Quick
question under
How's the chief clerks at the
bus a little bit over a quarter
of million dollar increases that
normal
Mr Chairman, representative. Are
you talking about the the
increase?
Just how to chief clerk's office
from from 2024.
2025. It's uh
$160,200
The
You're talking about the
appropriation from 23 to 25.
Mr Check.
Mr Chairman and representative.
Part of that was to ensure that
the staff has been, uh
Compensated appropriately and to
ensure that we have a little bit
more that we have not a little
bit, but that we have equity
between the House and Senate
session staff. That's always
been an issue, so the chief
clerks have worked. They work
under the same pay bond for
session staff.
And some of that increase was to
reflect. Um uh, increases for
session staff salaries as well.
Thank you Mr Chairman role, but
there's that about normal for
year to year.
Mr Chairman and representative
that that's really normal.
There's some fluctuation in
there, and it depends on a lot
of factors because included in
in this is, um um again. This is
I'm sorry. This is actually
interim.
Um some of this is is the
percent increase to ensure that
we've got salaries if we
increase the pay bands because
this is this is your ground
staff.
It also reflects any increases
in leadership staff.
Because the leadership staff is
included in the chief clerks
budget.
So that's included there as
well.
Thank you, bro. Thank you, Mr
Mayor. Thank you very much for
some Garcia Rapson Lahham,
please. Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chair. Just I came in a little
late to I think you might have
covered some of this, but I just
wanted to
Just ask a quick question. What
is the difference? Um, lfc.
Um
Hires for FTS versus a
Legislative Education Study
committee How many
I mean, after Easter each have
Mr Chairman, Um
I don't know the exact number. I
believe our FC has about 40. FTE
s and l. E. S C has
approximately 15. I believe
10.
0 10. I'm sorry.
Okay. Thank you for that. Okay?
And then this really quickly and
you may have covered this
problem before. Even last year.
The
Um the big increase from fy 23

offices.

In effect from covid and hiring

reason for that really quickly.

Your round staff. Okay, there's

million dollars increase in

yellow sheets.
Impact report, so those will be
our clerk's offices, 114 and 115
lines.
Mr Chairman and representative.
Um
FY 24 budget was
Is that dude, Mr. Chair? I could
just be simply the 60 day versus
the 30 day as well. Okay, well,
these? No, Because these are
actually your thank you. So
there's been increase in
salaries and there's been
increase in leadership staff.
Great. Thank you. I wanted to
just reiterate what
representative Um Sanchez said
and really supporting our staff,
and I hope we can move to a
place where we can actually have
staff for all of our
Um legislators full time. Thank
you.
Thank you, representative Han
Vice chair, Dixon.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Um, couple
of questions, um, on the Senate,
sort of the breakout in the
packet for Senate expenses and
House of Representatives
expenses. The last line is other
expense. And I was just curious
if you could elaborate, provides
some examples of what is
included in that category.
Mr Chairman and representative,
uh
They have, Um well Oh, I know.
For example.
All of the bills that get a
printed by state printing are
included in here if they have
any contracts.
Um, with anybody during session.
Those are included in here if
they have special needs, like,
um
Language interpreters sign
language interpreters and the
like.
That those costs of being here
supplies paper anything that's
used during session that is not
already covered by salaries and
members, mileage and per diem.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you, Mr Bursey. Aga.
Another question. Do we know if
the House and Senate chief
clerks included pay band
adjustments in their requests
for this coming year?
Mr Chairman, representative and
Vice chair. Yes, they did.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Last question, Um
For Legislative Council
services. Um
You've got the subscriptions for
participating in organizations.
But is there also
Uh, subscriptions for, um,
research materials and like
newspapers.
And things like that.
Mr Chairman and Vice chair. Yes.
In the Legislative Council
Service, your round budget. We
have subscriptions for the
library. There's a number of
different um
Newspapers, periodicals,
journals and the like that are
included in there.
Excellent. Thank you so much. I
appreciate it. Thank you very
share. Dixon, Robson Pettigrew
for another question quickly.
Thank you, Chairman for a
second. Go. Um Mr Bursey, Aga,
um, Chairman, Mr Bursty Aga if I
read section 10 correct, it says
amount set out in sections three
through eight. This actor
provided for information
purposes only and can be
transferred among categories.
Chairman and Mr Bursey Iago.
But to me
That means that there's
29.6 million that we can just
roll wherever we want without
budget adjustment requests
without
Without record without
Legislative oversight.
Would that be correct?
Mr Chairman.
Mr Chairman and representative
just to make sure I understood.
You're talking about the
appropriation at the bottom of
Page five of $3 million
And it goes over to the top of
Page six.
That may transfer amounts from
the appropriation.
During those fiscal years to any
other is that
Which I'm not sure. No, sir. Um
I'm looking at
Chairman. I'm looking at
category Transfer section 10.
Uh, line 24 is where it starts.
A J goes to line one on Page
nine.
What if I read this correctly?
Everything from
Section three, which starts on
Page four.
Page five.
Yes. So if I add all that up,
Chairman I come up with
$29.6 million, most of metals.
And
According to section 10 chairman
That money is allowed to be
rotated anyway. You want
Within those categories would
that be correct, Chairman?
Mr Chairman, Representative. Let
me start with section 10, the
category transfer
What that is.
Providing basically is the
Legislature having its own bar
authority. So, for example, if
any of the legislative agencies
LFC LSC Council service.
House or Senate chief clerks if
they need to move money from
Contracts to salaries or vice
versa, or something out of other
salaries because
Any number of things can happen.
For example, there might be a
change in leadership and they
decide they want either more
staff.
Or they're losing staff. They
want to put something on
contract. Then we have that bar
authority if you will to move
These are category transfers and
go from personal services to
contracts to others, or any
combination of that.
That's specific to each agency,
And that usually goes through a,
um, a process of determining how
to do that. And who can do that
Chairman. Mr Versi? I guess I
appreciate that so
Section 10 just like it was
written for me.
It seemed like any of the any of
them. Anything that was defined
in Section three could be moved
to Section four.
Section four Could be moved to
Section eight. Understand From
what I just heard.
Um, like Legislative council can
move so from PS and maybe to
contractual contractual two PS,
and maybe you can move anything
around within those three items,
but you can't just send it over.
Chairman and Mr Versi Aga, two
legislative education or correct
Thank you very much, Sherman.
Thank you Represent Pettigrew
represent Brown for a second
time.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. I think
I read section 10 about the same
time representative pedigree did
And I really wasn't sure what
that meant, And I think it could
be written more clearly. So for
future reference to get it down
a little better this time, But I
just think that that was
It was just not Mr Chair, I I
just
One quick question if someone
can answer
Um, who requested the additional
FTS that we've been discussing?
Mr Chair. I apologize. I didn't
hear that question. Um, Mr Chair
of the question is who requested
the additional F T. E s.
Who's requested the additional
FTS for lfc.
Specific.
Was it? Yeah. Was it with Lfc? I
believe is that correct?
Hmm. Um, Mr Chairman and
representative. I'm not certain
my understanding is that it
probably was leadership and
consultation with
With LSC management staff that I
I believe that was leaderships
now. All right. Thank you. Thank
you for presenting Brown. Thank
you both. I don't see anybody
else on the list Director. See
if I could ask you to come up,
and that's just if
If you really quick questions,
um first thank you, Madam
Leader. Director Bersih Aga,
Director. Silly number one. It's
our It seems like there have
been in the past pay disparities
between House and Senate session
staff.
Were beginning to address those
disparities through this is that
correct?
Mr Chairman. That's correct.
Yes. Okay, great. That's
Fantastic and we're proud of
independent upon our staff here
in the house and knowing that
we're going to fix that. Yeah is
really positive second. Um,
there in the past few years,
especially going back to, uh
1920 21.
The Legislature, in contrast
with other areas of the budget
kept the legislative pay and
increases outside of
extraordinary expenses around
like lawsuits. Those were kept
pretty flat. Is that accurate?
Chairman.
Mr Chairman. That's correct. And
to be clear they trailed the
budgets that we provided for the
executive and other areas.
That's correct. OK, thank you
for that. Finally, director
silly during the session. We, uh
there was a significant focus on
accountability and oversight
from the lfc. Is that would you
say that's accurate?
Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, Okay.
and in order to do a lot of that
accountability and oversight,
there were regular conversations
at LFC meetings about both
additional staff and also the
right place to put those staff
That is correct, Mr Chairman.
Okay, thank you, Director Slee
and in terms of sort of the
choice about where to put them
the ultimate decision to house
many of these accountability and
oversight staff in LFC does that
sort of track with, um LLCs core
function on a bipartisan basis
for the Legislature to do
accountability oversight.
Recommendation at times as well
for the state's budget.
Yes, sir. Mr Chairman and you
have

has been recognized as the
nation's top evaluation unit.
twice in just the last couple of
years.
You've got some situations with
the vast expansion of the cost
of health and human services in
the state.
You know, we've got one analyst
overseeing $12 billion new
Healthcare Authority, but
Department.
Along with a bunch of other
little agencies. HHS has
expressed the need to supplement
Mr Versi. August, Um
High quality staff in terms of
research and fiscal analysis,
and and that was the some of the
discussions that lfc those
committees on how to
Force multiply what we already
have between both agencies.
Great. Thank you for that
director slowly and obviously
we're placing, um
Uh huh.
Uh, responsibly, additional
responsibility and opportunity
with you and your excellent
team. Um, and that, as you said,
we've just in in Medicaid,
health and human services.
That's now a $12 billion. This
will take
The Yeah. We're gonna have a lot
more folks who can. Many of the
members have really pointed to
Okay. Thank you very much for
those members. Thank you for
great questions for concise
questions. Uh, with that, madam
leader, Mr Versi Aga, Is there
anything briefly like to close
with? I think we're good.
Okay. That's all right with that
I would open to a motion on
House Bill one.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I would
move. Um do you pass for
hospital? One.
Okay. It's been moved by Vice
Chair Dixon seconded by
representative dela Cruz. Let's
go ahead and do a quick vote for
this, Um
Yes, Miss Rodriguez, please.
Allison? Yes?
No. And I'd like to explain my
vote Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Yes, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you very much ranking
member Armstrong.
Uh, thank you, Mr Chairman. My
only concern that was brought is
you know, we're trying to make
sure that agencies hold to a 5%
6%.
And, um, I was just surprised by
the LFC. Not that I am not
supportive for sure. But I was
surprised to see that that
wasn't the actual original
request and just have some
reserves of on that. Thank you,
Mr Chairman. Thank you Represent
Brown.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
You know, Seeds Bill is going to
pass, no matter how many. I
mean, it's clearly going to
pass, but
I did have a real problem with
section 10 and the way that's
written. I just think it's too
loose, and it could be
interpreted different ways and
we want to make sure that we
drafted Bill. So, um, that's the
main reason I voted No and the
secondary reason Mr Chair is I
really would have liked to see
Kind of set up what we have when
we look at any appropriation.
We've got the LFC wreck and then
the agency record. I just don't
get the impression we had that.
Dichotomy, at least for
discussion purposes.
Thank you. Thank you. Vote of 14
to 4 House. Bill One has passed.
Thank you, Director Burciaga.
Thank you very much. Leader
chasing directors elite. Okay,
We're adjourned for today and
