don't know if there's anybody
online.

Madam Chair, the House Health
and Human Services Committee
substitute for House Bill 398.
Would me the insurance holding
company law to allow for group
capital calculation reports and
and liquidity stress tests.
The bill also proposes to amend
the health maintenance
organization.
To modify the timeline for
examinations of health
maintenance organizations and
contract providers from every 3
years.
You know less frequently than
every 5 years, manager.
This time we'll stop the
question. All right, thank you.
Do you want your expert to say
anything or do we want to go
ahead and
witness is Elizabeth Johnson,
says he, and you are welcome to
speak.
Adam chair, senator share and
members of the committee. Thank
you. Um, this is the same bill
that we, the, I guess we should
say the majority of the content
in the bill is the same as
Senate Bill 277, which passed
out of this committee,
unfortunately, it wasn't moving
quite quick enough, so we needed
to amend it into a House bill,
um, and this is required for us
to meet our accreditation
standard, and that's required by
January 1st of 2026, so, and it
must be done.
by statute, so we don't have
many other options. Thank you.
All right, thank you so much.
Uh, is there anybody in the
audience in support of this
legislation?
Anybody in opposition.
Nobody online. All right, now we
go to the committee.
We have a due pass from Senator
Sheriff before we do that do
pass, do we have questions.
And we have a second from
Senator Chiaroa, but we're
having, we're holding that until
Senator Bergman's.
Only because the committee
analysis says
on page 13.
Subsection B and G are
identical.
Not that I wanted like an amend
the house bill right now, but
You guys notice that?
Madam Chair, Madam vice chair,
what page was that?
Page 13.
Subsection B.
Be in subsection G as OK.
Which is at the bottom of page
14.
Madam Charing and Madam Vice
chair, they are the same. That
was.
Looks to be a drafting error,
but um,
I
I don't know how to proceed at
this hour.
I believe, uh, enrolling and
engrossing, fixing.
I don't think we need an
amendment.
OK, that was my only question.
Thank you, thank you for that
clarification. Any other
comments from the committee
before we go to the motion?
See no so we do have Senator
Sher as the, the motion and the
second is from Senator Figueroa.
Anybody in opposition of this Du
Past motion?
seeing none, please record all
in attendance, uh, as in the
affirmative. So that is 10.
Uh, to 0.
Thank you.
He's busy. Thank you.
Right, Senator Wirth, I think
you're, um, or Senator, uh,
Representative Barrega.
And Senator Worth.
Yeah.
Oh, it feels great. That's why I
was standing by the thing.
so hard
No thanks
All righty, Representative
Brego, um, just so when, uh, and
just to remind you, we do have
10 minutes, um, for you to go
ahead and do that and we'll,
we're gonna kind of squish it
down a little bit. So if you can
be short and sweet and to the
point, we would all appreciate
that.
Um, good evening, senators, and
thank you for hearing us this
evening. House Appropriations
and Finance Committee substitute
for House Bill 493 basically
seeks to codify guidelines for
DFA and state agencies, the
safeguard and management fund
distribution, disbursements to
local entities of capital outlay
and other special
appropriations.
Thank you, Senator Wirth, did
you want to make any comments?
have your expert.
We do have an amendment. All
right.
Uh, can we get a motion to move
the amendment for discussion
purposes?
It's my favorite thing, Madam
chair, and move it do not pass.
Uh, appropriation and just the
amendment, Senator, the
amendment beg your pardon and
then I move 0.232140.1 for
discussion purposes.
All right, thank you.
Go ahead, sir. Uh, thank you,
Madam Chair and members. Uh, so
just quickly to put this in
context, this is the bill that
codifies the 2013 executive
order of Governor Martinez that
has been
You since that date, despite a
number of different things, um.
AG opinion, question of whether
one governor continue can
continue executive orders of the
prior governor, but the
important thing is we need to
get something on the books. This
committee did pass another
version of this that I was
carrying, uh, and it's just we
didn't hear it intact.
What this amendment does, let me
just walk through exactly what
it does on page 2, line 25, the
bottom of the page, we strike
section one.
And replace it with the
following, and these are changes
that have been negotiated with
DFA uh to get everybody on
board. The new language will
read a grantee shall have
completed an audit for one of
the past 2 fiscal years.
And the most recently completed
annual audit shall be a public
record pursuant to the Audit
Act.
Again, compromise negotiation.
Uh, the next amendment is on
page 3, line 12 before the word
deficiencies, we add significant
deficiencies. So just to clarify
Senator Worth, um, for committee
we're in the green copy.
Uh, that's where we're, you're
referring to is the green copy.
Thank you, Senator. My apologies
15 on page 3 again and I'm
sorry, line 14 on page 3 in
front of deficiencies, we again
add the word significant.
Um, on page 3 line 21.
Uh, we delete.
Or if the opinion of the most
recently completed annual audit
is qualified, modified,
disclaimed, or adverse.
Um, so this deals with the
situation with what the
department is reviewing and
determining whether or not to
allow the entity to be able to
move forward in managing its own
capital outlay or whether we
need a quote unquote
intervention.
Uh, on page 4.
Uh, there's just a
qualification uh on flight 10.
about subparagraph B before, uh,
The the word do we add if
necessary, comma, the state
agency shall have determined
that it can impose and has the
resources to implement special
grant conditions. So again,
giving some flexibility, it's
not a mandate, but it gives the
department an option likewise on
page 4, line 15 before C if
necessary, the state agency may
have determined that another
appropriate entity is able and
willing to act as fiscal agent.
It's not an automatic thing, and
again gives the ability to have
some flexibility there. And
That is the extent of
The amendment. Again, this has
been a negotiation, uh, state
auditor has been involved, uh,
DFA has been involved. I very
much appreciate you kind of ran
bills on both sides, two
different versions, everyone got
to the same place, and I think
how to stand questions.
Thank you so much. Uh, any
discussion on the amendment?
Senator O'Malley.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I
was just wondering if there was
a definition for significant,
that's just a term determination
that we make.
And Madam, our guests to keep
their head on earth as deputy
state auditor.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
Uh, the terms uh material
weakness and significant
deficiencies are taken from the
standards the auditing standards
issued by SCPA and also GASB,
the general, the government
accounting Standards Board.
And the standards on on auditing
statements.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Any other questions
on the amendment before I go to
community to public response and
then come back to the committee
on the final bill. Senator
Figueroa.
A question on the page for
ifsaries, who decides if it's
necessary and how.
Madam Chair, Senator Fierro,
that would be negotiated between
the grantor and the grantee.
And the whole intent of that is
to allow flexibility so that
there's
Somewhat of a relief valve.
So it's not hard and fast. The
way it's being administered
currently, it's a hard and fast
rule, and there's no place to
go.
And it's the manager, if the
grand tour and grantee don't
agree on whether or not it's
necessary, who makes that
decision?
Madam Chair, there is an appeal
process.
And uh ultimately the CFO of the
Grand Tour Agency will come to a
decision.
But by that time
are
And we anticipate that it would
have been negotiated.
The whole idea is to release the
funds.
Any other questions before we
entertain an adoption, uh, a
motion to adopt the amendment.
Can I get a motion to adopt the
amendment. We have a motion from
Senator O'Malley. Do we have a
second?
second from Senator Wirth.
Anybody in opposition to the
adoption of the amendment.
See then,
See no,
please go ahead and mark all uh
in support. Now we go to, uh,
public, uh, if there's any
public testimonies or anybody in
the audience in support of this.
We're just going to do a show of
hands. We're actually not gonna
do any public testimony to come
up to the mic, but seeing none
anybody in opposition of this
bill, uh, as amended.
Do online. All right, anything
else from the committee?
What is the will of the
committee?
We have a due pass from Senator
Sher.
As amended
Sorry, Pat, we moved really fast
here.
Yes, so we have a DuP pass, uh,
as amended from Senator Schr,
second from Senator Ramos.
Is there anybody in opposition
of the DuPass motion for this
bill as amended.
See none
Uh, let's go ahead and uh record
that all present are in the
affirmative for the Du Pass
motion.
That is it. Thank you very much.
You have a 10 to 0.
Thank you. Thank you committee.
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow in
some capacity, but I'm not gonna
jinx it. Otherwise, uh, thank
