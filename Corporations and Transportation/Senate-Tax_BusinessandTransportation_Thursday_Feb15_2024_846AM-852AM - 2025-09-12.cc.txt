Okay, We have a corn. Alrighty.
So let's go ahead and get
started. We have, uh, House Bill
251 Committee. Substitute house
Bill 251 special license plate
procedures.
Representative Duncan
Senator. Thank you, Mr Chair. I
appreciate you can meaning the
committee on a very short leash
here for this piece of landmark
legislation that we're going to
discuss this morning.
I I do appreciate it. Really 80
years of Smokey Bear. I think so
Many people know the story of
Smokey Bear.
Uh, and he's been the lead
agent. Uh, although mythical,
uh, the lead agent for Forest
health, Animal Health and force
for 80 years. This is to
commemorate the eight years of
his existence if you will.
And the Forest Service and all
that we do to keep force
healthy. I'd like to differ if I
may to a representative Duncan
who shepherd this out of the
house, the sheriff you comments
as well.
Thank you, Mr Chair and
committee.
One of the co sponsors is
representative Vincent,
representative Vincent's father
in law was on that crew that
found Smokey Bear when he was a
cub.
And so there's rich history in
New Mexico. Um the $12 will be
used for the making of the
plate. Um, And while that plate
we don't have a warehouse full
of plates that plates ordered
and sent to the individual that
gets it, there'll be a weeklong
probably waiting of this, Um,
the rest of this money will be
spent.
Um, going to the Forest Service
for the fighting of forest fires
and education. Um, and after the
year 26 if they're not no longer
50% of the plates they're
stolen sold than this plate will
go out of existence.
So it's a win for everybody.
So, Mr Chairman, we are open for
Comments or questions to the
audience. Anybody here in
