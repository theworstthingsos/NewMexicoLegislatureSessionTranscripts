Senator Wirth.
Senator Hamblen.
In addition here.
When we have a current right
okay thank you four get started
I was going to go ahead and
folks are already audience for
watches been asked to rule over
a just be a tool for.
As well as SB fifty four.
And SB sixty eight by the
respective sponsors of the so
that you'll know.
Office.
With that.
Of.
Six sixty eight.
So tool for.
This B. fifty four and SB sixty
eight.
The in the Senator share of all
of.
All.
He won the wrestling match last
night so that's where you see
sitting right there and
So we'll go ahead and go with
the Senator Woods with the S. P.
sixty six I know you have a
The men of the proposed
amendment directed to committee
if you.
Can go a present that.
Of the proposed amendment is the
problem with the way the bill is
written.
Gross receipts tax are
distributed twelve months.
A monthly distribution Google
says it will be an annual
payment so essentially all it
does is make the distribution
monthly instead of an annual
distribution.
So.
And.
Me tell you it goes on home page
one line twenty five strike and
you.
And page two.
Line to strike the in this and
insert their of one twelfth of
the annual.
Therefore it just simply make
set up a monthly payment instead
of an annual payment.
All right Senator so
we need to move that amendment.
I'm more than happy to that
amendment Mr chair.
I move that we.
For some of the so that we do
not pass the original.
The amendment to the amendment
would assessment with us up to
the bill thank you so thousand
chair I move to move the
equipment.
The second.
Second by the Senator no any
opposition to the
The the motion.
I see none committee on amended
bill so do it back in the bill
back on a bill.
This bill.
Came about.
With the purchase of some
private property putting into
the state property.
And when that happens the state
are the local governments the
counties the city's the
hospitals the different mill
levies that are are put on this
property now don't get paid.
So what this bill does it ask
for gross receipts tax to pay
that.
This bill creates a new gross
receipts tax distribution to
political subdivisions and milk
well there you go months.
In the amount of the property
tax that would have been due on
the real property if it had not
been acquired by the state the
exception is the department of
transportation.
In the prior calendar year and
the real property is to be
valued as nonresidential
property and by main required by
the property tax code.
That's essentially what it does
Mr chair I do have examples.
Of the what this kind of
property tax he is if you want
me to go into those.
Chose a pretty big range.
I chose the Vermelho park I
don't know if any of you know
where the very may hope park is
it's up in Colfax and those
counties up there.
But just to give you an example
if it's a bagel ranch you know
it's it's probably.
I don't have the exact figures
for that acres but it's a.
All.
Probably half million acres
something like that it's a big
ranch.
And the value on the property
rules is nineteen million six
hundred fifty thousand dollars.
And the land and improvement the
actual tax that they pay on
that.
Is a hundred eighty four
thousand four hundred and twenty
four dollars.
So.
What I'm trying to tell you here
that.
Property tax in New Mexico and
don't let Senator Wirth here
this property tax and state New
Mexico is pretty cheap
especially the abalone impacts
on agriculture property.
And.
So it's not going to break the
the bank but it is a huge amount
of money that goes to Colfax
County here that they wouldn't
get if that particular right so
Colfax County and local
governments would not get that
was that kind of money and you
could see that could really hurt
them provide service services
for their County.
And for the local government and
for the hospital boards and for
irrigation district and for
everything else that we have
built in the school so M. A. of
all four
the offset is the state would
pay it.
And the local government would
get it if it doesn't get bought
if it's not ever transferred to
the state properties.
Have an owner faces.
To the local.
So I'm just trying to keep the
local government poll.
On these property J. exchanges
Mr chair and with that I would
stand for questions thank you
Senator so before we go to
committee for questions will go
to the audience anybody here in
support of Senate bill sixty
six.
Good.
Good afternoon Mister chair
members of the committee my name
is to probably have a registered
lobbyist with New Mexico from
the rest of Europe
Representative twenty thousand
families across the state we
thank senator what's for
bringing for this piece of
legislation that looks to
address losses for tax base
which is a long standing issue
that negatively
disproportionately affects our
rural communities our local
counties municipalities school
districts and other entities
such as hospitals institutions
of higher education and various
special district receive funding
through the payment property
taxes losses to this tax base
can make offering basic services
more challenging.
For local governments increase
fiscal instability additionally
the reduction of private
property owners in our rural
communities make them lesser is
resilient and reduces the
opportunities for employment and
economic growth for these
reasons we ask that you support
Senate bill sixty six thank you
thank you.
Mr chairman Mr frustrated on
behalf of the Mexico categories
in New Mexico will.
Of all the places previously
stated
we support the bill we do.
We know late acquisition go to
the state because right now
states have they can't take care
of and we need that money to be
going into rural communities to
keep them how to keep our
Rangers our farmers to be able
to produce and provide fifty
five four it not only The New
Mexico citizens of the United
States.
Thank you.
Built in favor anybody no
opposition.
I see none of.
The baby I just don't like to
build.
Okay are now we'll go to the
members for for questions.
Anybody want to know so good
thank you that made up for the
other all right will the.
Good committee Senator Kernan.
Thank you Mr chairman when we
first is trying this out but but
I information with ferment and
I've been there and done without
thinking about that particular
branch it is kind of an outline
this is probably there aren't
any other branches as
substantial as that so just I
can understand the value those
improvements and the property
tax on that but if you look
maybe across the state and maybe
some other branches that were
quite simple Nibert may help
because it is really may
actually goes into Colorado
With with the same impact the I
mean this is a huge impact not
to see how that would absolutely
affect this particular County
with that loss and and I know
what it's like to lose tax
dollars to the county to the
city so I understand that
concern that
so.
Help me understand a little bit
about
if we take a ranch is sold in
forced us to another project.
That this was not I this is
chance to the state
would would for some reason
purchase ranch such as this and
take it out of the the the
taxing
I guess.
The tax so.
For from private to state is
what you're talking about here
is that that's correct.
And so the G. R. T. I mixing
property tax with G. R. T.
taxed.
Does the G. R. T. tax just come
from what the state collects
across the state needs that part
of money to their portion of
that G. R. T. what somehow
replace that lost property tax
can be sent directly to the
county.
That is the plan what I
originally had in this bill.
Was the agency that purchased
the land they would directly
come out of their budget.
And when I went to council
service they said the I think
that's a doable deal.
So they came up with the idea
that gross receipts will be a
better way of doing this they
and doing it with that agency's
budget.
So Mr chair and senator
I guess.
a little bit concerned about the
reduction G. R. T. to the state
right now we're really good
check me collecting a lot of
state has plenty of money to do
this and that so down the road
just things we know we're gonna
change probably at some point is
triggered that with maybe a
lenient for cost of the state
that might have a right that
because.
Forward.
One of the questions just
thinking about
private land in New Mexico we
know it's fairly limited I mean
if you look in across the state
county by county fair Kelly has
a different part of land is
still project at my very little
privately so I'm just wondering
if and we've had several very
large ranches and Eddy and Lea
counties that have sold over the
last few years but they've some
to our private entities and not
the state but so I guess it
doesn't affect our family with
our property taxes just those
product projects anyway just a
little bit concerned about the
future right now so it's good
that as revenues sure over time
we might have different problems
but I do understand what it's
like to lose that G. R. T.
And have it shipped someplace
else so I really didn't have
have the concern for that puts
you talking about that's all.
Thank you Senator Griggs.
Thank you Mr.
Thank you Santo Domingo.
One of the issues we have
statewide emissions in the
current annually is the federal
government provides detailed
page to the the local county and
that's payment of the taxes that
were.
Land has been
Taking over but some of the land
is been is.
Held by the federal government
in Ontario county it's a
substantial amount and our San
Juan County I believe in the the
bigger.
But.
The federal government makes
kids page each individual county
to try to help with the loss of
the tax revenue from those
properties now that amended bill
payment is part of your we way
lower than the property tax.
But the Senator do you all on
on average how much of a
counties.
Revenue general fund revenue com
for proper.
Property taxes the main way of
county funds their activities
the gross receipts is the other
way.
What percent one or the other
would very quite a bit by county
so I cannot tell you that.
The shares Center out
I'll try to help you with that a
little bit.
Sure we received the majority of
their revenue from five cities
receive the majority of their
revenue growth for change that
Kelly's organ we don't get a
whole lot of appreciation so
they have to make an important
judgment.
Romeo Division we've been a
county commissions problem.
I.
But
In this particular fashion if
you use your travel or usually
example of the latter ranch down
south with forestry both both
happen beyond what to turn and
both large property.
It's a substantial here are some
of these counties especially in
the rural county talking about.
Who have limited revenue
shortage.
You know down in in the in any
you know there's all the oil and
gas activity
from Cherokee county we've got
the federal government a lot of
you know that sort of stuff you
Colfax County you caring the.
They're short of revenue and
with
private entities issues low.
Now one of the things that we've
got in our packet is the is
concern about using gross
receipts tax.
The way you do it.
they mention it maybe it out and
use the distribution from DFA
down
worthy of a huge they'll Mario
if it comes from the general
fund our general fund gets
funded a lot of our grocery
future actions to show but also
additional general fund Mr chair
Senator ditch money from other
sections of.
G. R. T..
Sure that might be it might be a
better approach to evaluation.
This this committee
but I think I think this is
perfectly reasonable if the
state is going to move private.
Into state ownership.
The.
The counties primarily were
there and it use use that fact
for whatever the.
And I think I think it makes
sense station reimburses for.
Sure sure thank you for.
Thank you a Senator of Griggs a
Senator Wirth Mr chair just a
couple of questions
on page two the distribution
goes to.
The political subdivisions that
includes.
School districts that area yes
so they get a separate
distribution the the county gets
a separate distribution.
You know the county surely.
One property taxes I guess it
could be done in several ways
when property taxes come in the
county treasurer Mexico's
distribution.
To the to the here again shin
districts in the according to
their mill levies and to the
hospital districts and they they
make those distributions I'm
pretty sure of if it's property
tax now.
How we would do this I would say
would be up to the county and
the tax revenue department to
figure that out whether it would
be easier to go directly to the
school district.
With gross receipts I don't
know.
I haven't thought that far ahead
two zero two the school district
allocate growth.
I don't think school districts
with gross receipts tax.
Not all you know I again it's
it's it's a very.
And unique way of doing the
funding is here but I just think
it's important that the I mean
it's also been a special
district any you have a
landraces in this area from the
health any any kind of political
subdivisions going to get its
own your marketers and is
setting and gas second question
is.
This is done annually.
Correct the distribution all
these would be the monthly
distribution yes well twelve PM
Yushin but it doesn't so it
continues in perpetuity.
Yes and as on page two it says
in a match is not a property tax
that would have been imposed on
a real property it was not owned
by the state.
So are we valuing that.
The for property every year to
figure out what it's worth
forces set the prices paid at.
Had it figured that it was said
at the purchase price it was
purchased.
Mr chairman I think that a
lawyer in the says there's some
squishy room right there so that
if you've got the state.
You know the state's doing
improvements on the piece of
land in the value.
Just received we have raised
higher.
You know that it looks to me
like a phone number press to go
up that's why that's why I have
it such that it would be.
The original value on on the
state rules on the county rules.
My intention is not to tax the
state improvements that they put
on it my intention is to keep
the county hole as it is the day
it so.
Yes the Mr chairman I think
there's some that language there
is interesting.
You know I I guess and then I
see what you're what you're
doing here but this isn't just
this is this is a major policy
shift.
Really in terms of spots not
just apply to L. bar which is
where this started but now this
applies to any time and again
we're having a discussion the
session I senator bill and I are
caring a little bill that's got
a lot of people talk about land
acquisition by the state and
trying to stop any of that I
know there's also bill in the
house they got tables that would
allow for some more land
acquisition but this would apply
to me the state for any.
The simple that's important the
simple it's not I'm not an
easement it's a fee simple
ownership of the land of the
state did that this apply to any
piece of land correct the in in
in that.
I think we should really think
about a thought about trying to
put in the bill on a and it was
way too complicated.
To encourage the state to sell a
piece of property before they
bought a piece of property when
we start talking about.
Of land within the city.
we have State Land that may be
abandoned more live somewhere
not being used.
And.
You know everybody likes new and
shiny.
So many times we bill New and
steady use what we have and so
those are things that I
considered.
But the main thrust of this year
right my idea is let's think
about buying private property.
And just for example.
The state of New Mexico.
Is presently.
Forty three point eight percent
thirty eight and we get to track
forty three point six percent
private land.
The state of New Mexico.
It's forty three point six
percent private land.
I think about that.
It's eleven percent state trust
land.
It's eleven percent travel in.
It's thirty four percent federal
land.
And local government has point
five percent.
So when we start talking about
buying private land.
There's no one it's majority of
the state.
Yes keep that in mind I
appreciate that Mr chairman I
guess I guess my my concern is
similar to what Senator Kernan
highlighted this I mean this is
really creating a.
A long term recurring.
Expense and it would seem to me
I guess I would feel much more
comfortable you know we're when
we don't have money we're not
buying any land clearly in the
state when we run out of money
which is not a position to do
that but when the risk resources
and something happens
it seems to me that if it's a
better conversation at that
moment to figure out how to
maybe it's all it's a one time.
Lump sum money that that gets
distributed out to kind of
address the impact of that
versus creating a recurring
obligation that once we what you
know once we run out of funds
and you can't cut this one off I
don't think I mean it's it's a
it's a G. R. T. M. out and and I
and I I understand that the G.
R. T. Bakit because I think it's
going to be general fund is
gonna have to to to pay this
piece that comes that we're not
collecting this anywhere this is
coming out of the general fund
is that is that your
understanding to pay the G. R.
T. incorrect.
Well G. R. T. flows into the
general fund you're right.
Hello thanks Ron general fund
also you part of the severance
tax fund every year the
distribution goes into the
general fund but I love the
thought to have their a little
bit a little of it.
Because you rang the bill own
your thought.
How much do these counties and
other equipment local
governments lose when it goes in
to so publicly State Land and
that's exactly what you're
saying what is the cost of this
going to be.
To the state.
The exact same amount that the
county loses.
You're right thank you for those
comments are appreciate that and
I think that there's there's a
piece of that let me also say I
think there's a tremendous value
depending on what we're doing
with the land of those to those
I mean again New Mexico as we
all know is an extraordinary
state and we have extraordinary.
What resources and accept
something and get reserves which
otherwise let me let me here's
the other thing here's the
here's the other interesting
thing if the state is going to
come in.
And purchase something that
remains open space in perpetuity
for all of us versus a private
seller turning around and
selling to someone who's going
to go put in a subdivision and
take out.
The ranching history that's been
there.
you know that's a different
discussion and I just think
that's another side of it were
actually thank you and I might I
see you shaking your head
somebody actually I would go
with that while I got you on it.
Low this to Mister chair hello
this too because.
Is New Mexico management is is
New Mexico gonna manage the
land.
That they purchase.
You're saying that it's going to
stay in the ranching industry so
are we going to keep running
council met.
Are we going to hold it back.
For other reasons and then
should there be a user fee.
Turned around and pasties taxes
because if it was a rancher he
would have to pay taxes.
So shouldn't who ever uses that
land also be required.
To fund local government because
they provide chairs they provide
services to the city are to the
county residents.
So who find jokes do we just say
well the state of those.
Where we're talking the same
story right.
I just want to make the point Mr
chairman and senator as you know
one trying to make that there's
a cost when the state takes over
private land there's cost it may
be the the public good.
But even if the public good we
need to keep and the cost that
that lands generating.
And I'm not input and account
cost on these things some of
these counties make more money
off the cap tax than they do
property tax.
And I'm not even showing that
point because one reason I
thought the buffaloes to cheat
so I didn't bring that to the on
the for the male part but I will
tell you that the buffalo herd
is valued.
At.
Just a minute.
There are thirteen hundred
thirty to head.
And for one month well for the
value is three thousand three
hundred fifteen thousand six
hundred dollars.
So even on this ranch the
buffalo herd is a value a great
value even though the taxable
value those buffalo bar is high
is I think they should be but
you know have those livestock
values are set and I know
heather said and we don't
probably need to get into that
discussion right now that might
get you in trouble.
If we start going that way I
appreciate it I mean it's an
interesting idea I just again.
Some reservations but it's good
to have the it's good to have
the discussion thank you Mr
thank you the Santo Domingo
thank you Mr chairman so the
former county commissioner Andy
was really excited by this bill
think about Rio Arriba County
but that the senator and we
started to think about what
senator Wirth last would come
out of the general fund for the
G. R. T. my only question to you
is by chance to New Mexico
counties look at this bill and
you get their support.
I did not talk to the New Mexico
counties I did not.
That's the question I have a
suggestion thank you.
Senator critics for the second
time.
Thank you Mr chairman one of the
ask Senator or appropriations or
are about yeah the the title the
title of the bill in the new
material page one talked about
receipts tax to the political
so.
In the body.
There's no major change that
that last it's section seven one
and I
think
that's what.
The
ideas that our and we might just
replace it with payment from the
FAA instead of you know coming
directly from G. R. T. it can
come from whatever the FAA.
And then I wanted to to.
Action you Sir were Senator and
and Mr chair getting back on
page two on why.
Three is for.
We're Senator Woods have with a
very close by the subdivisions
where property apartment owned
by the state say something along
the lines of what was posted at
the time the real property was
required by the state thank you
we if we were to somewhere like
that that that should satisfy
your dollar amount no.
Did you know what it would be.
And it started to increase
issues from the time it
required.
chair chair Senator I I don't
know if we wanted from Mandan we
want to try to hash it out here
and live center who would just
go work on a man than that
which.
I mean that that direct that
that mean that that that does
what he's trying to do Senator I
think it answers your concern
about that you may have some
other control which I I don't
know but
I think I think what the
senators trying to do has had
real value to especially the
rural county.
you know and the majority of the
counties in the state or or
rural.
And potentially or impacted if
the state wants to go on
purchasing Sri.
Which may never happened but it
if if the average.
They know.
The county knows what it will
continue Russian.
And the state knows what is
going to cost on an annual
basis.
So.
Mr chair Senator I I certainly
like you to think about that and
and try to move Shannon would
bill us or with his insurance
and he'll look at that for staff
so thank you Mr chair
okay Senator Kernan took time to
listen to all.
Thank you Mr chairman just
covered you know this is all
coming together trying to figure
out what the right thing is we
know that should something like
this happen particularly to this
particular account that there.
The actions of the state have
created a reduction in revenue
to that particular account and
trying to figure out how to make
them whole.
I know how that I know how that
feels when there's policy
changes and then something
happens and then you know what
particular areas from harm I
wish we could figure out a way
to do it in because I do think
that the bill that's in the
house to kind of restrict the
state from purchasing this would
be a really good disincentive
for the state if the state had
to pay in some way for the
actions that they take from the
purchase of the product plans
it there has to be a remedy and
I'm not quite sure what it is
and whether it's a G. R. T. or
some other way to do that but
we just have so little private
land stayed in New Mexico that
which we have to be really
careful the special areas so I
wish we could figure out a fix
and help with some of the
smartest people sitting around
this table to try to work on
that so you know hopefully
cannot afford is yes sure.
I.
On it so anyway I I do
understand the issue and.
and concerns.
And
in those areas for the sales.
Thank you senator of Sierra.
Thank you thank you Mr thank you
for reading this for
Practice the this those reserves
and the talk about a pending
sale of this property what what
Mr chair and senator Coleman
what prompted this bill was I
found out about a large ranch
sale the L. bar which was a
thirty two million dollar
purchase by the state New Mexico
by the New Mexico game and fish
and they used a lot of federal
money to do it I'm not gonna
tell you different it's an
excise tax on ammunition and
firearms and it's it was brought
under a habitat of time.
The purchase that's what that
money is supposed to be useful
have to so naturally our
purchases habitat I mean you're
purchasing that happened so but
what happened was.
But County also was losing money
now on that case I could be all
but I think it was only like
fourteen or fifteen thousand
dollars is all that property tax
works for the county.
But it was actually two counties
that was
Cibola in Santa Fe really this
with two counties was I believe
we can only and McKinley in
Santa and this so rich is up on
the edge of of mount Taylor and
you know
about thirty miles from.
The interstate but still.
The counties lose in those tax
dollars.
So thank you for that Sir this.
Mr chair.
Senator is when the federal
government says pilot payments.
Are they at full value or the
discounted rate would understand
of Health payment from the
federal government.
I really don't know how they
determine that I know that they
say will will get you fifty
percent this year and forty
seven percent this year and and
how they actually determine
what.
The bill is going to be I do not
know they give help for for all
of for service land they give
Rubio lamb land they give it for
for air at Air Force base being
there they give it for and Los
Alamos gives it for
The labs of their I really don't
know how they do that.
Magician Mr but I do not know Mr
chair Senator
Mr chair Senator Iowa city
manager.
we the city is to receive a
discount of.
How the payments from state
university.
They were to pay the full amount
they pay a portion of what it
would this bill would be more
amenable to people from the
coach's discounted rate.
Well.
That's funny do you discount the
rate to the sheriff.
Who do you want to take the
discount to.
Maybe maybe the roads or maybe
let's make a smaller highway.
I
thank you I appreciate your
answer but I'm just trying to
help you.
Something is better than
nothing.
Your that's right Sir get your
right.
So currently.
The so that's all that that's
all I have a sure thank you
again for being here.
Just so you have good reason to
do so thank you for your
questions.
The question I had on the
Ongoing provide to the US center
the.
Senator curtains question and
then also regional.
Making it the concern that I
have is to.
On purpose to the for the value
of the property and so forth so.
What the pleasure of the
committee.
Yes.
For the past by whom.
Senator Sanchez for.
Second.
Senator Griggs.
The second.
I'm sure you're thinking.
So
I just heard a voice and I saw
Maria has in go up so I thought
it was the.
The sounds very like.
So we do have a motion on the
floor for the past motion and we
have a second.
Of go ahead and take growth
Senator Brandt.
Yes Senator Griggs yes Senator
had a meal no Senator Kernan yes
Senator sentence yes.
Your comment.
A pass.
Senator Wirth no.
Senator Hamblen no.
Senator Tom in the past.
So if this goes down in the
system that.
This is a way to bring it back
and more discussion and maybe
amendments.
I think in a I think it deserves
more discussion.
He's.
What's the count now.
Four three.

Senate bill thirty eight tax
code changes of raiment with the

than that our on this bill and
with the forty.
Thirty minutes a presentation
thirty minutes a question.
For less if you choose to say I
think it was the pleasure of
your a disability you have
Senator.
So.
Mr chair I have a couple of
people here
The first one is Pam Stokes
Legislative Council and she's
just here to make sure that
whatever comes out of my mouth
is at least true.
In a hundred ninety six pages
and I might get something wrong.
the other one is is Tom Clifford
he was the secretary of DFA
amongst other things and is a
really smart about taxes and so
he's here also make sure that
whatever comes out of my mouth
issue for so just wanted to put
that out there that I I have my
safety rails as you can see on
either side.
But Mr chair and senator Wirth
particularly.
does anybody on this committee
or anybody in the state honestly
believe that our tax system our
current tax system is working.
I submit the answers no okay
and so we have this hundred
ninety six page bill here but it
is not a panacea we still need
of regulation reform we still
need some work force of reform
but this building address that
but it certainly that step in
the right direction.
You know this is sold Chinese
proverb this is the best time to
plant a tree was twenty years
ago the next best time is today.
And so with this particular
tracks tax form
today is the day okay we have
some money to make sure that
things in case we're wrong
little bit we can take care of
that so now's the time to do it
what I call this one of my whole
goal here is what I'm calling to
see change S. E. A. the S. is
for simple I'm a relatively
simple minded guy and I need a
simple tax policy to understand
and so do most other people.
This achieve that.
Yes raise enough money I'm not
trying to cut any programs out
of anywhere not trying to cut
taxes at all okay we've made
obligations to pay our bills we
should pay those bills so this
one is designed to raise that
same amount of money but the
most important one is the a and
that is attractive is it
attractive to new businesses.
If it's not attractive to new
industries then we don't want to
do it now I know that there will
be but people will behind me the
raise their hand and say who's
opposed to this okay they're
back there and I understand that
and I understand they're here to
to defend whatever tax breaks
that they've negotiated with the
legislature over time.
And if it were me I would be
doing the exact same thing I get
that okay I also know that what
we've done for those folks back
there's really a bandaid on a
seriously broken system.
And we've been putting bandaids
on for decades.
Now it's time to look at
something else because our their
parochial concerns really the
best for the state.
And that's what we're trying to
get out can we do the best thing
for the state of New Mexico.
One of the things we never talk
about when we do special tax
policy for somebody.
Is a tax exemption for one
person is a tax increase for
somebody else.
We never account for that mostly
because the person we're raising
tax on the No Way and they're
certainly not the room saying
Hey don't do that to me just for
them.
That's rare.
Yeah the question I have for you
is if this.
Really fixes our tax policy and
really attracts new industry.
And one of those leave.
But ten new ones come in that
are of a greater economic value
to the state.
Are we better or worse off I
submit that we're better.
I don't want to running a those
folks off.
And that's not my intent but I
understand where they're coming
from and and and I'm not going
to even argue that the
Four against them I'm just
saying that we need to look
broader and I think this is
broader.
So one of the things that we did
in our efforts to to do tax
reform years ago we took the tax
off of food and I just want to
go through this story real
quickly.
Was it was a great idea state
tax of food people should be
paying tax on food thank.
The best of intentions great
idea best of the tensions what
could possibly go wrong.
Well when we limited the tax on
food in that same bill we raised
the tax by half a percent on
everything else.
We raise the tax on diapers in
school clothes and shoes and
sheets and towels and utensils
everything else in the family
uses we increased the tax on.
When we did that.
Our local communities which I
just heard about.
Many of our local communities in
fact most of the local
communities.
Received most of their their
revenue.
From the grocery store.
And when we took the revenue
from the grocery store away all
of a sudden these local
communities have this terrible
decision to make we don't have
the revenue to pay for fire
protection and libraries and
road repair and and and.
So what are they going to cut.
Fire protection libraries this
is a real issue for our for our
local communities for while and
so we as a legislature came back
together.
And we did the whole harmless.
That's what the hold harmless
did for those of you that we're
here what the hold harmless did
is we as a state.
Rate the local communities what
we thought they weren't getting.
In gross receipts tax on food.
There was a formula but it
certainly wasn't perfect okay
console the hold harmless
another great idea best of
intentions what could possibly
go wrong well as we know oil and
gas revenues do this and it did
that and suddenly without oil
and gas revenues we did not have
the funds.
For hold harmless.
We couldn't pay the city's
anymore for the G. R. T. they
lost.
So we came back together with
another great idea best of
intentions.
And we'll well the city's three
one eight increments and we
allow the counties three one
eight increments the idea was
that they would do one H. now
and when it later on when it
later and what they did was
three one eight slow in the
first committee meeting for
council meeting or commission
meeting or whatever kind of
meeting they had and so three
one eight from the city and
three one eight from the county
is sixty eight which is three
quarters of a percent increase
in so now what we have done in
the effort to reduce taxes for
the poor.
We increased taxes by one and a
quarter percent on everything
else.
Everything else.
What's interesting here is that
the the the the poorest of us
and that's why in New Mexico.
We're on what I will refer to as
food stamps at the moment I know
we have a couple of different
names for but and they weren't
paying tax on food anyway.
So we did not relieve that group
of people of any tax burden.
What we did is we added one and
a quarter percent to everything
else without relieving a single
penny of tax burden for them.
Last.
Here we go with the best of
intentions and that's what we
did because we we we just keep
playing with this you know who
did get a little bit of a tax
break will you all me okay why
because I'm assuming that none
of us were on food stamps or
park today although I may be
getting close.
So.
When we lowered the tax on food.
The food that I bought I got a
break on.
But the food the person who had
food stamps did they didn't get
a break on because everyone
paying.
And this is just a good example
of what we done it was what we
have done with our tax code over
time.
Our techs who really should be
for the greatest benefit for the
most people.
And so all those special
interests that are back there
who have com and follow and work
for their their thing.
Is it really for the best
benefit those are the things I'm
trying to get at is that we
really are.
You know there was a study done
on our tax code by
perched in your they're one of
the largest accounting firms on
the planet.
It is usually came back and says
New Mexico's Texas a number
fifty out of fifty states.
And then what did we do what we
had our economic development
department we have taxed we have
go to Ernst and young show them
all of the special tax breaks
that we would give people.
Then they came back.
A good movie the number thirty
six.
But if Ernst and young one of
the largest accounting firms on
the planet can't figure out our
tax code.
Who can.
So maybe Pam.
This is a huge problem it's a
huge problem that we have so we
often talk about broadening the
tax base because we've got this
this tax policy that has all the
holes in it that we refer to as
the Swiss cheese effect.
Because we've taken chunks of
the tax based input holes right
through it.
We've been talking about
broadening our tax base for
decades.
And we don't get there.
We just don't go there it is
really kind of frustrating to me
so.
There's a couple things here.
All of these Texas the text this
is called the tax expenditure
report these are taxes not
collected.
In December.
When the legislative finance
committee met.
The report from our own of tax
revenue department.
Charted here which I know it's
hard to see what it says is that
we're not clicking three billion
dollars in taxes three billion
dollars because of all the
things in this book.
That's from tax and Rev in
December.
That's huge.
Now frankly I I love the oil and
gas you may not notice it
because I have them oil and gas
equipment all all session.
But I understand the oil and gas
is an extremely volatile.
Industry.
And I know we talk about this
boom and bust cycle but that's
not what happened to the oil and
gas oil and gas does this.
The price of oil could drop
precipitously to not.
Because we just don't know
what's going on in the world.
So we lose control of what what
we're doing.
Console.
Really just tell you briefly.
What's in this bill.
A whole lot of repeals of stuff.
But it generally tries to make a
uniform two percent gross
receipts tax.
It combines some other taxes
like the premium tax and motor
vehicle excise tax and the
telecommunications taxes all in
two G. R. T. so that we don't
have those special taxes so we
don't have special taxes for the
most part.
And we don't have.
Deductions credits or exemptions
for the other part.
We did in in an effort to to
fulfill some promises that we
made if we promised any of these
folks back here any kind of tax
exemption.
Credit or deduction in the last
ten years.
We said they can keep it for ten
years so we're gonna fulfill
those promises for ten years.
And I think that's important
because I don't want the rest
the country to think that we're
just gonna come out here and we
need on things without at least
thinking about it okay so those
are going to stay there.
The repeals however.
Really offset.
But the fact that we broaden the
tax base dramatically.
So that's where all of that
comes from there's a couple
other things that you'll see in
here one is if you look at the
F. I. R..
You'll see that we have this
huge gaping problem with
personal income tax.
But I have amendment right here
to fix that.
And so if you look at that you
say it's going to cost almost
half a billion dollars.
But if we fix it that half a
billion dollars we appears.
And that really is is critical
to keeping this thing read a
revenue neutral okay here's a
civil.
Simple things that happen in the
it was fixed to fixed.
We did do some other things we
change the personal income tax
in the corporate income tax so
we didn't touch those is that
the general I wanted to
originally and some of you
remember that that I had a
personal income tax and
corporate income tax justice two
percent.
In this case so we kept with the
progressive tax system so now
it's two four six percent for
both personal and in corporate
taxes in the numbers in there or
or they're.
We did raise some fees in one
spot.
The gasoline tax which funds or
roads at least.
The dramatically funds are does
other things going there.
The more electric vehicles and
hybrid vehicles put on roads
last gasoline they're going to
buy so what we did is we try to
figure out what the average.
Of vehicle in the currently
existence today how many miles
does it drive on average how
much fuel does it by on average
and what is the tax that they
pay on fuel on average and we
came up with the idea that
electric vehicles could pay six
hundred fifty dollars.
Is that registration fee to make
up for the gas that they don't
body.
So.
The other thing we have here is
peer meeting.
Absolutely this taxes every
everything every time not even
gonna be shy about that I know
there's a bill out there to
eliminate peer meeting but what
that does sixty percent of
today's tax revenue comes from
peer meeting.
If we eliminate permitting we
have to raise the the tax on
diapers in school clothes and
shoes and utensils dramatically.
To make up for that sixty two if
we do away with so this payment
but permitted to percent.
Which is a lot better than
permitting at our current rates
in our current rates very across
the across the state.
But the big thing that it does
well it reduces our tax.
By the way our tax our effective
tax rate in the states really
the state park is four percent
yes it's five point something
but we give one point two two
five to the to the locals and so
or the state tax rate is really
for.
So we're cutting the rate in
half but we are broadening the
base we're doubling the bass so
if you cut the rate in half
would you double the base you
come up with the same revenue.
Come up with the state revenues.
For a long time we try to get
away from the G. R. T. because
G.R.T.  was weird because nobody
else had a G. R. T. so people so
G.R.T.  is weird but you know
what's happened over the last
couple years seven states have
adopted the G. R. T. just like
ours.
We're was good.
We couldn't accept.
So.
I do believe that the tax on
food was regressive.
And now we've got to do
something about it.
The bottom line is.
This bill.
What's the right doubles the
base keeping it neutral put tax
codes don't have to be
complicated.
What I have in my hand right
here is a type version of what
is called the current code so
when general Kearney marched
into Santa Fe in eighteen forty
seven during the Mexican
American war there was no fat.
Because the Mexicans understood
that the north Americans what
they will call the time.
Reasonable people they want to
refuse anybody and they came up
with the current code which is
forty four cents as long yes a
couple of them are long run on
sentences but there's no period
in there until you get to the at
the forty four sentences long.
It's got thirty three sections.
But starting at section twenty
one to thirty three it's what
the tax collector cannot do.
So that means the first part of
this is what the tax effect.
Can do and so some of my
favorite parts here.
There shall be live levied on
all peddler's license once
peddlers licenses a territorial
tax of the following rates
first if the panel will travel
in carry goods on foot five
dollars.
Second if one of more beasts of
burden five dollars for each
beast.
Third if a court or other land
carriage eight dollars.
Some of my favorites though
here.
The point every licensed to
brochure or dram shop keeper
transient that's like a bar but
I think we would expand that
expand that definition and today
to be other things that make
people happy.
There shall be levied a tax not
less than ten in not more than
fifty.
Dollars.
I do believe the colonel colonel
John Carney had a problem with
billiards tables because they
were thirty dollars for each
table so you know.
What for drink but thirty
dollars if you want to play
pool.
Forty four census we lived under
this tax were similar.
Until nineteen fifteen this is
the very first actual New Mexico
tax code now remember we were
state nineteen twelve.
This is the very first tax code
now this one is all property
tax.
Versus business tax.
This one is twenty two pages so
we really went from about twenty
to census to twenty two pages
what an astronomical increase.
Really was.
The tax property but not just
land it taxed your bed in your
dining room table.
And what we did is the
legislature's we said we need
three thousand dollars a year to
run our state so each county
needs to come up with the
proportion of mount of tax and
so then the tax collector went
out there and counted the land.
And the budget in the dining
room tables and set off this is
how much tax you all.
And we send it to the state.
Most of this is what the tax
collector cannot do to you.
But interested even in nineteen
fifteen we had special carve
outs for the purpose of aiding
and encouraging the construction
of sugar beet factories broom
factories will in mills smelters
water power plant Siemens
plaster manufacturing water
waste pipelines ditches and
canals the show must be taxed.
So they had the same people let
their maybe even the same
lobbyist and some K. looking as
all the.
The.
Twenty two pages twenty two
pages.
Our current tax code.
Is one thousand three hundred
forty eight pages that nobody
understands.
With the exception of maybe
these two.
In that is the problem.
It doesn't have to be
complicated.
The G. R. T. is actually very
affordable tax.
This bill eliminates all of
those massive tax breaks in some
cases that are constitutionally
questionable and certainly
complicated but the other thing
that I think is important is in
our tax code today when we get a
house bill two about ninety
percent of that money is already
a lot of we as the appropriating
body has rendered our ability to
appropriate because we have
special funding that goes to
special things.
This bill puts us back in charge
of our own budgets to give us a
chance to look at things one of
the things that we didn't do in
this bill I should say Pam did
in this bill.
Is we make sure that all of the
bonding from the special funding
sources would be paid.
So all the people that are
worried all know my bonding with
no we have to pay a from general
fund because all the money goes
not general fund but we have to
pay those.
And so I believe that the right
thing to do here.
Is to target our help.
In over the last several years
we have really targeted.
Help to the people that are that
are the most needy we've
increased help for them for by
about a hundred and thirty five
million dollars recently.
In targeted.
In things like liquor.
That's actually helping the
people we meant to help verses
the the the food tax which harms
the people we thought we were
here to help.
So I believe this gives us a win
win win win opportunity first
the poorest among us when.
Okay they get a lower tax rate
on the diapers and the school
clothes and utensils and
everything else but they still
don't pay tax on food because
they still get the the the food
stamp system snap.
You're not paying tax on food
now.
Then.
And we've targeted aid to that
group of people in the tune of a
hundred thirty five million
dollars they went to middle
class wins the tax rate comes
down.
In the understand it.
Industry actually win because
it's attractive they can figure
it out.
I know that the group that's
most harmed by this is the whole
herd of attorneys that need to
read this to figure it out.
But industry when as well
because all of a sudden they
have a tax code that they
understand and rates are down
the state wins because we have
revenue neutrality.
We're in good shape but we also
have a dramatic opportunity for
growth which we have not had in
decades.
Today we have the money for the
safety net today's the day to
plant that fruitful tree.
We have a beautiful state.
Let's let the rest of the world
know it get rid of that book.
You go less than thirty minutes
Mister chair I think thank you
Senator share.
So
The.
Well to the audience to see
anybody is in support of bill
thirty eight.
Opposition to Senate bill
thirty.
Thank you.
Can you come over here us to
with folks that are listening on
the zoom more on webcast can be
able to hear.
Thank you thank you Mr chairman
members of the get committee my
name is Brent more of a
registered lobbyist for here in
Mexico USA and with all due
respect to the senator and his
attempts to
redo gross receipts tax you
Ricoh USA stands in opposition
to the bill the reason why
you're in Mexico USA stands in
opposition to the bill is there
one of the many
Entities that has a deduction
contained within the bill they
actually have to related to the
activities that occurred down in
unison I would tell you what you
Ricoh USA is one of the many
examples of the use of tax
policy to incentivise companies
to come to New Mexico and here
in Mexico USA built a facility
near Younis that they put about
five billion dollars into it was
a massive endeavor for them to
create the facility the employee
numerous it individuals down in
Eunice and those are high paying
jobs so I understand there's a
frustration with gross receipts
tax I understand there is a
desire to address various things
but when you look to
specifically here in Mexico USA
the the facility and the
the jobs that are created down
there are an example of tax
policy succeeding and these
standard respectful opposition
to this bill in addition to
hearing co USA represent a
number of different insurance
and trade associations they have
concerns over the attempts in
the bill hi to.
Change in the approach to the
tax the premium tax it is
something that is they are not
in support of because anytime
you start changing premium tax
you start talking about costs
that are then baked into
premiums and those affect people
who are buying the policies and
so
I won't list all the various
other clients but we have real
concerns with this bill thank
you you.
Somebody else.
Whether somebody else okay I
think we have the person on the.
Go ahead yes hi good afternoon
Mister chair members of the
committee my name is Jay and I'm
a senior research and policy
analyst with New Mexico voices
for children and we do stand in
opposition opposition to Senate
bill thirty eight while there
are components of the bill that
we do support repealing the
forty percent capital gains
deduction overall this package
would result in hundreds of
millions of lost revenue for the
programs and services that help
New Mexico's families thrive the
proposed changes would also make
a revenues more reliant on about
Tyler oil and gas revenues which
are estimated to decline over
time we also propose taxing food
given are really high rate of
food insecurity in the state
good prices we know are
increasing families are
struggling to afford food and
even if they have sent me might
not qualify for snap or it might
not cover all of their food
purchases on a monthly basis so
for these reasons we oppose
accent of thirty eight thank
you.
Thank you.
The.
Do we of anybody on the
committee for questions.
Once.
I know it's a big bill and I did
tell the sponsor that will have
the least given one hour or less
depending on the questions and
so forth and but we're not gonna
take any action on this bill
because it's very complicated
but I wanted to give them the
opportunity to present and and
and in here you know what what
because you know that we've been
talking about broader base what
is that mean but I know that
Senator sure has been for many
years.
On this and I think you know
hopefully at some point we're
gonna have to seriously look at
this in ways that we have
because our volatility of oil
and gas industry and and and so
forth so with that for over the
Senator sure Senator Kernan to
thank you Mr chair in that in
that particular explanation
inure to expert sitting there
and I know they do know a great
deal and you certainly do as
well but I have just a couple
questions when you repeal the
looking at the municipality the
one two two five to have returns
back to the municipality have
hello this is city or
municipality make up for that
loss with the chair you know
you're thinking on on when that
goes with the what's left and is
it just basically what they
impose on their local community
so Mr chair and senator really
they get they get their their
prod Tax base back okay
so food is a big one okay it's
all of a sudden the the the
thing that most broke our tax
system what's the food tax and
so they get that back we're also
not at least with this bill bill
repealing any of their other
taxes so I think the the city's
in fact according to the FIR the
cities are are doing great with
this.
Mr chair and senator is there
anything in the bill that would
prohibit municipality for for
from implementing additional
taxes on themselves locally.
Of other than what we have today
you know we've got limits today
on what what we allow cities to
do now if there's nothing else
but it broadens their it doubles
their tax base just like it
doubles the steaks Tax base.
And they're not so in their case
we're not cutting their we're
not doing anything to their
right this is only the state
right.
So this doesn't affect the
city's in any negative way at
all in fact it but help sponsor
for its tax things they don't
tax today so so Mister chair and
and senator I know last year I
believe that was an effort to to
mandated misspelled just could
not implement additional taxes
but there's nothing in this
nothing here that has any of
that so true that's true yes my
areas more percentages when you
talk about the food tax and that
going back on and I remember
when we we took the tax off it
but we did raise some of the
Texas is certain percent and so
that would flip flop in this we
would put the faith that bond
with their B. reduction us and
all other taxes and services to
match that yes and so that's the
whole point so it we go from
effective right state right
because we still give the one
point two two five that goes
away but we broaden the tax base
for the cities but so yes the
tax on the diapers the
additional tax on.
All those down to thank you Mr
chair and of when you pick up
that not the big book but the
second thing but the one that
list all the implements and
chins and exemptions if you took
all of those four percent of
those do we actually utilize our
actually utilize in order to
know so many of our out dated
that if you could do a
percentage yes let me let me ask
if either one of my smart people
know exactly what that is I know
that a huge part of them are are
simply updated.
But.
Not all but I can't give you an
honest percent so Mister chair
Senator is there an industry
specific it is may be impacted
more than any other industry I
mean if you looked at that and
we're removing all of those is
there one particular industry
that stands out as maybe being
harmed more than any other.
I'm not the the one industry it
is most difficult to figure out
is agriculture because
agriculture has exemptions so we
don't know what those mean.
And I would like to point out
that in our own caucus we have a
former.
Of the dairyman in a rancher.
One of them thinks that this is
good one of them thinks that
it's neutral in the other one
thinks I'm trying to destroy
Act.
In a rural caucus so this I
want.
I know that probably many
businesses corporations and
specifically Ranko and that was
mentioned earlier they have long
term contracts for issue of the
day
in research and and and those
contracts are based on a promise
made our legislature by this
government that would impact of
course everybody has their own
impact that to contracts of
playing a role in you know we we
make a profit support not going
to keep now and you said ten
years but that doesn't that
doesn't help us there's is older
than ten years so we talked
earlier United about the issue
of grandfathering input is the
appropriate time frame and how
do we respond to those
businesses that have some
contracts that would absolutely
be impact
you know that the company would
be if if we renege on that
promise so do you have a comment
on that yes so Mister chair of
of actually been struggling over
here Ranko specifically for
awhile and there's some others
out there.
And it's.
The Ranko is kind of unique in
what they do and what they do
for the world the so they're
involved in in the world economy
probably greater than most of
the other things in New Mexico.
And I've been trying to figure
out how to deal with that.
In this particular bill hi said.
We should all be the same.
But if there is a an amendment
that makes sense if we extend
the promised to fifteen years or
if we figure out a different
promise I am certainly open to
that.
but to just say no.
I don't think that's a good
answer.
We all know that we have to do
something.
We all know even your raincoat
that our current tax system is
broken.
And we have to fix.
This is the fix thank you that's
all I have thank you thank you
Mr foreman.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
senator.
Bring this forward a budget for
the year your work and up.
Up to this
So it is a very small thank you.
The figures suggesting a six
hundred fifty dollar fee for
electric hybrid I suggested a
hundred twenty dollars and
environmental groups went nuts.
At the negotiated down to eighty
dollars how to cope but up to
six hundred fifty.
Well a I didn't ask.
I guess that was my first.
But what I didn't do this is I
try to figure out is it in.
And I will admit that this was a
SWAC schools a scientific gas as
opposed to just a guess but how
many vehicles do we have in the
state today what is the average
mileage you know how many miles
per gallon do you get on the
average you know F. one fifty
pickup trucks how far does it
drive and so you take all of
that and you know how many
gallons as it take to get there
and I said well this is the this
is how much of a gasoline tax
for fuel tax diesel tax this so
much fuel tax.
That vehicle pays today you're
going to take that one off the
road and you're going to put it
and let vehicle on the road it's
going to travel the same
distance on the same road to.
It's six hundred and fifty
dollars.
Generically six hundred fifty
dollars in gasoline or fuel
taxes that the electric vehicle
does not pay.
So that's that's why I was
simply trying to maintain of
neutrality in our role fund
because that that was one of
them that we that we touched
here so how do I make that
neutral thank you thank you for.
Sure I I hi calculated must be
malfunctioning as.
The report says you got every
person drives twelve thousand
miles of the average card is
twenty five miles a gallon get
eighteen cents federal of
seventeen cents.
state and works out to about two
hundred and fifty hundred sixty
dollars when you came up with
her and said well let's move on.
Yes.
So.
Where there were able I can't
tell from reading this what is.
It is it to hear you correctly
you said at this point is
revenue neutral.
first of all the registration
fee is multi year so I'm talking
about the whole thing but the
whole bill by just going back to
registration from an yes the
whole bill.
Is designed to be revenue
neutral.
If you look at the FY are those
people say oh no it's it's not
if you fix the personal income
tax.
with this ammendment then it
gets very close to revenue
neutral he could be positive in
fact.
But it's certainly the it gets
very close.
Well.
Mr chair and senator I
Is that this is what the
The analysis of the state that
doesn't.
Well let me open this up yes so
when taxed Rev did their first
analysis of it they took what we
tax today and cut it in half if
you look at they didn't account
for any broadening of the base
they didn't account for any of
these going back into the.
To the tax base they just took
were taxed today cut in half and
came up with it's going to cost
two point seven billion dollars
but if you don't have this yes
it cost two point seven billion
dollars for you at this.
Delicacies portion and it's a
range here says maybe fifty five
million and they were accounting
for the fact that we did not
have.
This fix for personal income tax
with the fix for first personal
income tax and according to the
LFC analysts.
It might actually be a positive
and revenue.
Okay well.
But thank you Mr chair thank you
senator.
I I again I applaud what you're
trying to do that is a full
agree we need to do
Some major changes.
but is it too much too fast and.
I think we need we need to.
For you and the others to
provide more specifics.
did you ever give any
consideration to to doing this
and phasing it.
So yes absolutely Mr chair and
senator Pam is been working on
this for at least seven times.
Alessio.
Thank you yes and she said to
put up with me all of time.
so one of the if we have in fact
try to figure out how you could
face things.
The problem is I can't anyway
figure out how to do it so that
it doesn't pick winners and
losers right away so if we are
relieve some of the tax burden
from somebody but not somebody
else well now it's not fair it's
not equitable we go to court and
we lose okay.
if we try to do little pieces of
it that is really where we get
the volatility because things
like that happen
and I do believe this is this is
far more refined than.
When when I first asked him to
do this she did what I asked
which was not very refined.
So this is this is far more
refined in getting that so that
we can get right there I don't
know how to do it in phases I've
tried to figure it out for
years.
It's time to plant the tree.
Well.
Thank you Mr chairman.
And.
I wholeheartedly agree we need
to do something majority of the.
I can't plant a tree.
that's all I have a.
Thank you as senator one senator
Wirth thank you thank you thank.
you know I want to use this to
kind of also highlights and
things that I think we are going
to discuss the session that you
for the gun that discussion on
within this bill one of the
things I know we're gonna have a
bill to look at the brackets and
personal income tax yes
what's interesting about this
version is that you've got I
live by what I'm seeing here
twenty eight percent of New
Mexicans are now at six percent
brackets which also includes all
of the small businesses yes so
and again you need that's going
to generate a chunk of revenue
that they're gonna be paying
their that they're not paying
from all the other little things
they're paying so Mr chair
currently there are five point
nine.
Hello.
Yeah I I guess I could go to
four five but you know to for
six sounds better I I I never
happened again I think you're
gonna see some different.
Staff for me one of the things
for a long time I used to always
say you know when we were at
four point eight four point nine
you know if you make sixteen
thousand dollars for the same
taxes make sixteen million
dollars and I just think that
you can put in some additional
steps into that into the gap
there that will actually provide
tax relief to a whole bunch of
folks in the middle and that's a
good and I think you can also
pull up a little bit on the
topic and it's what's more
programs city into the tax
Mexico there and I'm certainly
open to that absolutely we've
talked about that with both
corporate and getting good
exposure I've got I've got a
bill you can sign on.
No I think it's I just I think
you're right that the constant
money what I'm what I'm really
focusing on is the concept of
what you're doing there the
other thing I think interesting
is and I kind of I ten a curious
tell me a little bit about what
you think on corporate tax.
Again this of course is just C.
corporations yes so it's a
pretty small number of taxpayers
I think it's like two hundred
and fifty and and like maybe
your experts have some sense I
thought I again these are it's
it's a structure that most New
Mexico small businesses are
either escorts are LLC's and it
passes through a personal income
tax yes but see court often
under here so what is the you're
putting more brackets at really
lower levels and I'm just
curious we even have C. courts
that make less than two fifty
five hundred here is and what
kind of what what are those so
Mr chair and senator I I don't I
don't know who those people are.
In fact I wanted to eliminate
the corporate income tax
completely because the corporate
income tax in New Mexico today
representative less than two
percent of the entire budget
general fund revenue okay less
than two percent it's it's very
very small.
But frankly as I was ready to do
that the name Wirth kept jumping
in my head and pounding me
because there's so much thinking
on corporate income tax and and
how we do that.
There was another effort there
that if we did not have a
corporate tax.
That that was the on in the
potential unintended
consequence.
It.
That we could become some kind
of strange tax haven it did not
that was not beneficial to us as
a state it would be one of those
gigantic big tax breaks in and
everybody everybody suddenly
becomes a C. corporation and
nobody pays tax at all.
And so that's why that's in
there which just to try to avoid
that unintended consequence
because Pam was smart enough to
think that there might be a
unintended consequence in there
if we if we did what I wanted to
do.
And I accept it Mr chairman I
would not talk about politics
fast.
What is this due to local
governments I mean we taking
away their increments here to
impose additional G. R. T..
Mr chair Senator in this bill
notes this bill does nothing to
local governments nothing except
brought their tax base but it
also does not take whether
increments I have thought about
this it doesn't make sense and I
do believe at some point we do
need to look at what the what
the locals to.
Because we gave them three eight
two three eight three eight
three eight six eight.
And so somehow we need because
we've brought in their base we
need to bring that back but in
this bill nope this is only
state portion of this doesn't
touch the locals at all Mr chair
does it does repeal the hold
harmless now.
In other the whole talk the
state payment to stay home Munoz
that repeat repeals the state of
is this not the whole harness
but that the state share the one
point two two five yes it
repeals that but again it
broadens the base dramatically
which I believe more far more
than makes up for that Mr chair
property tax does not there a
few taxes we did not touch we do
not touch the severance tax we
didn't touch the gasoline tax we
did not touch property tax.
I appreciate that and just just
one final thing I think it's I
think the the discussion about
your Ranko is is ties into the
and another important thing that
we really need to think through
it and.
When you when you put these
exemptions in place you need to
do offer up tax policy reason.
And you know we can defer
disagree on page you know what's
the basis of the reasons but I
think we did we've gotten
finally we're doing a better job
at least a putting.
You know a sunset on the bill
and make sure there's an amount
for the credits and not it's not
as good completely wide open but
I just think as we go back and
look at these.
All of these credits and
deductions are on the books my
sense is that there's a bunch of
them that don't need to be there
anymore and and we also have any
and you've basically made a goal
way and this yes and they all go
away but the problem is and
Senator currents you know goes
away and that I think makes
sense go away you're kind of
starting from scratch.
but I think you're on to
something though and I think
this is something we all need to
think about if you're gonna come
in with new.
Exemptions go figure out some
that can go away and pay for
what you're putting on and make
sure the policy make sense and
we've been so hesitant to.
To go and take these off the
books.
That we just end up putting more
on the books and we're we're
headed into that into that
universe again I can feel it you
know we're going that way once
we have revenues like this all
of you know now is the time to
go get my exemption relied
adduction and I just think we
need to be looking at both sides
of that and and this you know
this seeing what happens when
you when you reset because I
think is a fair coming would you
agree this is kind of a a reset
absolutely Mr chair Senator this
is a reset.
And.
It and there's certainly room to
to make adjustments adjustments
on the tax rates adjustments on
how long promises should be
kept.
Absolutely but this is the base
I mean you know the if if we
don't plan to treat can't grow.
But I am most interested in the
fact that we took away the
special tax exemption for a
broom factories.
Well this is a job I say one
more thing I may put you on the
spot a little bit but you know I
know for a while there it was.
Sign this pledge signed this
pledge that you will never.
Raise any revenue this year and
I think you know.
At one point you indicated I
think you just signed that
pledge I did and I appreciate
you what you've said that
publicly and that's why I'm I'm
repeating it and I just want to
say that you know when we were
at the opposite of where we are
now when we literally were at a
point where.
You know we work started.
Cut classrooms and do all that
stuff Senator was always willing
to be in the discussion and and
potentially to vote for things
that could raise some revenues
so and and looking at both sides
doing good policy and I think
that's that is the incredibly
important place to be in the
uncomfortable middle on this
stuff because it's really easy
to get the one side and say I'm
just gonna I'm I'm not gonna
touch touch or what happens and
what we did let's also for every
single reduction and it's all
fun and then the minute we get
into a top space on on on our
campus and so again I just think
that that's what's been doing
this long enough with you I just
commend you for being willing to
to have these kinds intend to
have us have this kind of
discussion which I think is a
good thing good thing to do
thank you for that that's all I
have Mister chair thank you sent
work Senator Brandt and we've
got about eight more minutes.
Thank you Mr chair you have six
if I talked like a.
Thank you Mr chairman appreciate
it Senator share you know this
is a.
An interesting thing I think one
of the first things you ever
talk to me about.
And I just implore this
committee.
To get this passed so Pam that
have to do this every.
In this state you know see so.
and then is the tax tax or you
go to get it done before that
and the you know of anything
anytime you need a tax bill them
you go to Pam and.
Is bills are almost two hundred
pages.
I feel sorry for having to do
all this work with
yeah I appreciate some of the
changes you made
I by like this of more of the
simplicity didn't realize we're
so you have an income tax
and and I did want to say that
you know if you're paying six
percent on a ten thousand in
income verses six percent and
ten million dollars of income
person with ten million dollars
income is paying a lot more tax
same percentage but a lot more
money I'll never know that
personally because I'm never
gonna have ten million dollars
in New Mexico but you know
that's it is you know so I think
is one of the philosophical
differences that people have
over the tax system is whether
percentages the same this dollar
amount
which is one of the reasons I've
always liked the flat tax idea
to where everything's paid in a
sales tax.
Because we know that so much
more money spends more than
someone less money it's kind of.
Kind of a no brainer.
You get a million dollars in
income every year you're gonna
spend more than the first and
only ten thousand and.
Therefore your tax your of a lot
more into the system it's based
on what you spend in the we're
not harming people who actually
save money.
but
I am a little bit concerned
about the of the year Ranko
situation but at the same time.
One of the reasons were in this
situation.
Is because of all these
exceptions that we've given and
I I would say I've never brought
a pet project tax exemption up
here for anybody.
And I hope I can can always
continue to say that who what we
need is a tax system that works
for everybody not just for part
of the population so that when
we're looking at a company in
asking a company to come to New
Mexico it's you know everyone
pays this it's just the flat
that we pay we don't give you
special tax break to come here
and we were a bride you in other
ways but we're not going to
bribe you in that way
and so I do think it's something
that could really benefit our
state I think it's something
that could could help our local
communities
You know Ron always talks about
when he was the more Alamogordo
I never been in city government
hope to never be in city
government because they actually
get a lot of phone calls and
I'm.
You have to many problems are
addressed your trash that can
doesn't get picked up in the
call your city councillor you're
more.
Thank you has anything to do
with that but.
No.
So he your nose the situations
the the income every time we try
to tweak things every time we
try to not think through things
and and Sir till then I will say
that you know search years been
doing this longer than I have
been up here on the specific
thing.
and so.
It's been researched and then we
have a study that that looked at
and we paid money to have
someone study.
So Mr chair we paid four hundred
thousand dollars to do a study
and then tax revenue wouldn't
give us the basic that is so we
didn't do a study.
But we spent squandered four
hundred thousand dollars.
Because our own state would that
give us the data we needed to do
a study so so we passed a bill
are there was in the budget
can't member with the toll Tax
arrive to do the study yes are
to hire someone to do a study
they did and they never gave
that study to legislation yes.
Pam wants to correct me up so
okay Sheeler is still dry like
me.
I I literally told her to make
sure that I was not yeah the
that that I was being is
truthful and honest as I can
some of you know that I might
exaggerate on occasion in both
of these folks are here to make
sure that this doesn't happen
today Mr chairman Sir I think
that's one of the problems is
you know we we are so we need to
look at it we need to study it
we need to and so then we pay to
do it.
And the government who supposed
to actually answer to us who
then we answer to the people of
color public
They don't give it to us.
Now that we did nothing to taxed
wrote for not giving it to us
to.
Not to my knowledge is actually
comes in Council services
someone and give us the study
can I allow either or both of
them to answer Mr fairness I
want you to get into much
sharper Committee yes there was
a study done by Ernst and young
and they were given some data it
was difficult of there were some
difficult times getting the data
I think what happened is right
after the years you finish the
study that federal tax cuts and
jobs act was passed which pretty
much obliterated any kind of the
data that was done so it it was
immediately updated that that's
what happened but taxed
Representative did provide data.
Thank you so anyway I think
that's a it's something we need
to.
Continue to talk about move
forward as we want when we're
ready Mr chairman and I went up
but not today but for Pam sake I
think we really need to get this
bill for.
Thank you all right the Senator
Griggs.
Thanks for shared and Center
real real quick the the one
point two two five is going away
a yes Mr center okay and and one
point two five one point two two
five your way because you
believe that your state tax
state sure tax because arguably
the one point two two five is
the there's a panel of these
absolute package.
so.
This is the the issues I've ever
had with with this is the
challenge with you discount the
shot and Mr chair Senator use of
indicated that you're not
dealing with them other than
broadening their faced by by
allowing them to have.
Food food mostly and everything
else as well of the and we're
sure sure and we know or I know.
That the food taxes substantial
to every community and yeah I
know Pam does what the dollar
amount should be banned over the
course of time there's as food
the hold harmless payments have
diminished which the full part
was famous for primarily food
over also
medical services I believe as
well so what we're what we're
going to see if if and when we
can implement this if we're
going to see the the state tax
be at two percent to receive the
the municipalities on top of
that page will be some of.
Because we don't know what that
number is because it is going to
vary by each municipality
because of taxes already have
imposed.
so when we when we talk about
this we talk but we we can
certainly say that state tax
will be at.
But we somebody moved here.
They're going to see a taxes not
X. if they're thinking about
just the state tax so as we turn
around and market New Mexico
we're gonna have to figure out
how we how we actually do that
from a tax perspective because
of traction Los crucis will be
different than the taxed
Alamogordo will be different
than the tax in Farmington will
be we did different and that
taxed Albuquerque.
those are things that I I think
as we go forward.
We can address but I think those
are things will have to address
because your portent we're we're
we're marketing in our state two
people from outside our state on
oil what your tax rate in which
my gonna pay if I move to to New
Mexico.
you think
And and others like that I think
this thing to do to consider
those things if you phase out
the exemption incrementally.
Not.
Right now we face amount
incrementally to you get to a
point where the two percentage
which would be the point under
your stuff but you you phase it
out so they don't get hit boom
because they're used to have an
additional.
Which is zero and so you've got
to you need to get them to to to
which you don't get to to to
tomorrow we.
Ratio of and four percent
increments have percent ical
which I I don't know but and you
do that when we look at will
you're doing it differently so I
can't I think I would make this
suggestion if we go if we don't.
Deal with it the way you're
looking at a is that there's no
longer anything that the
economic development department
does it would create a zero tax
for.
It would be a a two percent for.
For show all the time not just
the full.
I think that would be be
realistic important to look at
is a different a different
approach to to that.
But you know Mr chair Senator
your this use.
This year's pretty cool stuff
and I've I've got to be you know
Pam and Tommy Asian Preciado to
working with because I know.
The restriction we need your
help for sure but it's this is
your New Mexico has got to
change some way.
And we're going to see other tax
bills.
And we've I don't know which
one's going to be good out of
all that what I what I like
situation I like yours some and
a lot but the
The two four six.
One two four six or one three
five.
I don't understand where we
decided somewhere down needed
one point nine.
Two point eight whatever the
numbers are with the the point
something.
Representative numbers are.
Representative members and their
air easy for people to look at
they can they can just grasp it.
But the other stuff is different
show which Mr chair Senator
thanks for doing that.
And I look forward to seeing
where they should go.
Thank you I know we're living
over time but I'm gonna give us
Senator Kernan just just one
quick comment Mr chair he
mentioned the the one to two I
am a circle back around and and
you know you all heard me say
that when for instance Hopson
Karl Spence both losses one to
to five due to the the bill
we've talked about previously
and when the FIR came out this
cost to the state in order to
return it back
with two million dollars and I'm
not sure just brought me in the
face that use in municipalities
would be able to make up I mean
that's what the costs that was
going to be just to communities
and and so that that kind of
concerns me a little bit you
don't need to respond that just
that just came to mind that that
was a huge cost to the state
which in fact was a cost as we
lost seven
billion notice Munoz believes
not here arguing against.
They think they're doing all
right.
Well the.
I want to thank the the sponsor
of the bill on those but a lot
of work into it the.
Copy of this bill I think in
June.
For July I can remember he said
if I need some sleep and I think
I got the first part of a fell
asleep and so but no it's.
But I appreciate the work that
he's put in I've ever been since
I've been in the Senate and
Senator sure and I've been on
committee for eight years and
this is the first time in this
news that we're not part of it
but you know he's commitment and
looking at these things and then
we talk about the fact that we
have a very you know complicated
tax you know let some point
we're gonna have to do so so I
appreciate the work completed
all the comments you can take
and so forth and with this go
from here thank you Mr chair I
also can get everybody a two
percent tax tie.
You need.
Yeah I I maybe at some point you
know Senator share has come up
with all these various props
that are visible property and so
at some point we will have to
establish the appropriate
something at the museum to all
your props in it over the years
and only so thank you again
Senator thank you thank you okay
so we'll move on to Senate bill
fifty senator.
We have.
That is the ability of.
Good.
Here is there are.
All right Senator thank you Mr
chair.
Senate bill fifty.
relates to construction.
And it affects the right to
repair act what this bill does
is put a process in place.
For a situation where a
homeowner a builder and
subcontractors have a dispute
over products that are in the in
home put into the home.
It puts a process in place
before a suit is filed to set of
steps and I'm gonna let my
experts discuss those different
stamps
And I think the this issue is
one that has caused real concern
amongst our home builders in our
subcontractors.
And what this bill really does
is give them a right to address
the problem and fix the problem.
Before we end up in a lawsuit
over the problems.
And so it's kind of a.
The litigation process that lays
out for that to happen where
someone who's impacted gives
notice there's a right by the
contractor and the sub
contractors involved to inspect
the situation and see exactly
what the problem is and then
figure out if there's a way to
get that problem fixed which I
think at the end of the day
benefits everyone
and so with me today at the
table I'd like you to them just
to say a few words about what
the issue is mackenzie bishop
was the general contractor
appear on the story who is a
subcontractor and Randy trainer
who is a lobbyist for the home
builders and I think what I well
the to you guys as to who wants
to go first to kind of give a
way of the land Mr chairman
members of the committee
I have to say it's always
someone sitting in this chair
and it's nice to be here nice to
be back in the building
For number of years we've been
trying to address this problem
and I actually uh introduced a
bill in two thousand three to
address this problem maybe that
means I'm not a very good
lobbyist because I'm back here
in the twenty twenty three doing
the same thing
We have a situation where.
The process is of the Courts the
processes of the insurance
companies all these things kind
of come together and form a
perfect storm and the kind of
get weaponized against the
industry in a kind of gets taken
out of our hands we're.
You don't just common sense
would tell you if we can get the
two parties together maybe we
can figure this out and avoid a
lot of litigation.
we have people who are.
Receiving checks.
For construction defects
litigation homeowners and they
literally have no idea what
they're the fact is in their
home.
This is right and I I I just got
a general contractor the sub
subcontractor subcontractor to
be here today because this
relationship between the general
and subcontractors is the
essence of the construction
industry for for all industrial
construction industry
particularly with housing in
this relationship is being
stressed to the point that is
causing some serious long term
effects to the industry which it
will affect everybody in this
building and so with that I'd
like to that McKinsey say war if
you were here.
What.
I hear I'm supposed to use this
if.
Mr chair members of the
committee my name is McKinsey
bishop
co owner and founder of the
browser homes in Albuquerque New
Mexico where a large privately
owned and locally owned
homebuilding company will build
about a hundred and fifty houses
in Albuquerque and Santa Fe this
year
Randy mentioned the issues that
are that are out there I I want
full disclaimer I've never been
sued nor named and one of the
suits.
But all of the people that built
my house is half they've been
they've been named in suits with
some of my competitors and
ultimately my hi employ over
forty people none of them
actually build homes the people
that build our homes are people
appear who owns a subcontracting
firm employs two hundred fifty
folks and I rely on sixty to
eighty of of companies just like
appears in order for us to build
homes when I started my company
in two thousand ten we were
targeted at affordable housing
we started at a hundred thirty
nine thousand dollars in
northwest Albuquerque my costs
since then have more than
doubled it's impossible for me
to build a house under three
hundred thousand today and
that's that's a real shame you
know we're here because of we
have a housing crisis we have an
affordability crisis and.
We're not gonna solve all those
problems with this bill but
we're going to solve one of our
biggest problems which is our
inability to get into the
affordable insurance my
inability to get it and my and
my subcontractors the inability
to get it because we quite
literally run general liability
carriers out of the state and I
won't still appears thunder let
him give you give you his
anecdotal story but.
Used to be in Albuquerque there
were three or four roofing
contractors who serve the vast
majority of our industry today
there's one we have one roofing
contractor that serves eighty
percent of the new home permits
in the Albuquerque area and the
lack of competition the lack of
you know refinement in processes
and things that exists when
there are multiple operators
within a given trade secretary
that's not good for the business
that's not good for the customer
that's not good for me so what
we need to do is we need to make
this easier we need to not
stacked the cards against the
industry because what's
happening right now is if I get
tendered if I if I get tendered
with a suit for with a
notification of suit my
insurance company requires me to
for that to them and once it's
and because of the way my
policies written I have no say
in how that gets a due to it's
not about what's wrong in the
house I don't even know what's
wrong in the house of read these
pleadings and the pleadings that
come in there literally copy and
paste change the address it
could be any one of these things
that's wrong and if there's
thirty or forty of them in the
neighborhood I can't afford that
so I tended to my insurance and
my hands are on by time no
longer involved in the process
of adjudicating that resolving
it and so you know this isn't
about this isn't about making
sure that builders and
homeowners and customers are are
able to solve their disputes
we're not even getting to that
point and so what this bill does
is it creates a step in the
process where let's figure it
out let's fix that let's do
what's right and if we don't you
should see me because I deserve
to be sued some.
Hi my name's P. R. M. story I've
been in the construction
business since nineteen eighty
eight.
Start in the drywall Business
NADH the vote up or stuck
Division in nineteen ninety six
we're one of the largest
contractors in Albuquerque Rio
Rancho and Santa Fe we do work
for most of the.
Duction billers in that market
and we have been just inundated
with lawsuits that are.
It called construction defect
but they're just alleged I've
never seen a defect I've never
been called in to look at the
fact I've never been asked to
come and fix a defect the first
time we hear about it is when we
get sued and so we get sued and
then again like McKinsey my
insurance company requires me to
tender that claim to the
insurance company at that point
I lose control of the claim I
can't negotiated I can't fix it
I can't even contact people I
have to let my insurance company
do it and unfortunately they
don't offend me they just find a
way to settle so they settle the
complaint.
And then then following December
I get with an increase of a
premium price so the last four
to five years I've had twenty to
twenty five percent increase per
year.
For my insurance costs I came
within two weeks of being out of
business when Cincinnati left
New Mexico and and amount states
close the doors there was no
insurance companies for
production builders and for or
production subcontractors in
that I could find a state New
Mexico I had to go out of state
and go to Arizona to provide
insurance within two weeks I was
going to close my doors and I go
two hundred fifty people
fortunately I found insurance
for expensive but I did.
I can absorb those costs I have
to pass them on to the builder
Attorney press some on the
homeowner so affordable housing
is being decimated well he just
told you from a hundred thirty
nine thousand over three hundred
thousand dollars and it's going
to keep going up less and less
people are going to have the
ability by home we're gonna have
more renters or homeowners
pretty soon so it's not good for
any which is not good for the
industry and as a subcontractor
on a looking for is to be
treated fairly if I done some
wrong with the fact let me see
it let me fix it and if I can't
fix it we'll fix it and again
I'm not stopping anybody from so
we've I don't do I'm supposed to
do but I never got a chance to
fix anything so
so these costs are getting to be
out of control it's hurting all
of us could you imagine
McKinsey's getting increases
from forty or fifty or sixty
subs every year just because of
insurance not accounting
materials and labor and and
smaller companies are going to
come in the smaller subcultures
are going to get involved
because they're scared of this
situation they can't afford
insurance even start so our
labor force is shrinking our our
demand is increasing and we're
having to try to fill this void
but it's it's an up hill battle
and without some help to get out
of these lawsuits and let us
manage our own defects if our
eight defects actually then this
is going to spiral out of
control I think for rural
housing will be extinct in the
state of New Mexico thank you.

New Mexico okay we have offered
as a whole fifty states we're a
big company we represent we do
arbitration for almost all of
the national home warranty
companies to buy extended
warranties that houses all on
whatever everyone has a right to
repair clause in their contract
because they go we want to give
the bill to the opportunity to
prepare but most importantly we
want to make sure that consumers
taken care of and they get their
things fixed not the description
of insurance company or
something like that everybody
has been some of the state is
that right legislative and I can
tell you that all of those
states have seen such a
diminishing number of court
cases that would come into a
court because they get it taken
care of by the builder between
the homeowner and whatever else
I could go on for hours on this
I'm just going to say quickly I
really hope we do this this is
going to be and all is going to
cure all step in the right
direction let's face right to
repair legislation and we'll go
from there hopefully as Jack
Larson people we we have a lot
more work to do to to make sure
that we can take care both
consumers and catch.
Thank you thank.
Thank you.
The side anybody on June this is
support okay go ahead.
What's the.
Yes hello.
Mr Chairman do you hear me yes.
Thank you Mr chair committee
members my name is Steve Hale
and I am a builder in the
Albuquerque area.
several years back when I was
president of the state home
builders association I became
aware of this issue which was
happening at that time mostly in
the Albuquerque area and I thank
the kind of a practical view of
this issue the laws in the state
of New Mexico have a lot of
Outside litigators to come in
and take advantage of the system
and really so lease the builders
without benefiting the whole.
without benefiting the
homeowners and what this bill
does it doesn't let home
builders off the hook it gives
them the opportunity to make
things right if something is
wrong with the hoping that
they've built and get that
corrected where's the way it is
now the whole what loan for home
builders are cut out of the
action and really it's these out
of state lawyers Center seem
most of the better thank you
very much thank you.
No more leave.
Yes.
This is Laura Vassar I am a
reminder in the Albuquerque area
and president of the New Mexico
homebuilders association with
right Mr chairman and members of
the committee thank you for the
opportunity to speak in favor of
support of SB fifty.
Fifty is vital to helping our
housing affordability in
maintaining our skilled
trades people working for the
people of New Mexico the
majority of states already have
similar legislation and have had
for a number of years dealing
with this very problem this
problem.
And where the legislation comes
from Mr regret the frivolous and
abusive litigation generated by
construction class action
lawsuits this bill if passed
will provide a clear path to
resolve really issues by
pointing out specific areas of
construction defects for the
builders and subcontractors to
go in and address for the
homeowners.
Is also helps stop the
escalating insurance costs that
my colleagues have spoken out
here today federal help maintain
our skilled workforce building
homes for.
Instead of them having to close
up shop and further diminishing
or work.
And thank you senator Wirth for
sponsoring this bill greatly
appreciate your work on this.
ready
Anybody in opposition.
We'll go to.
Mr chairman members of the
committee to really I think
you're representing the
travelers.
I first learned about this issue
month or so ago and I was told
that there was a problem with
some of the practices of an out
of state law firm and I think
the appropriate path for dealing
with that is the disciplinary
board for.
And I Hey respect this funds are
obviously.
And I just want to emphasize
that that's the path that I hope
folks take we also have concerns
and are opposed to any kind of
force or coercion classes
because it restricts access for
that person who's been wronged
or potentially even more to have
access to the point I also heard
over a number of issues that the
insurance industry is the
problem and that our insurance
rates are going up and I I think
that's a larger problem for this
body my insurance rates are
going up every rates are going
up that.
You're on multiple issues and I
hope that we can get it that way
thank you Mr chairman thank you.
What.
Thank you good afternoon this is
okay from here.
Sure the allowed no voice I will
certainly try to Mr Chairman
good afternoon Mr chairman
members of the committee my name
is our partner and registered
lobbyists from the half of the
county has been low for the I
will start off by the first of
thank you Senator Wirth he was
very kind enough to send us a
copy of the legislation before
the session started so that we
could review it and provide
contact contacts and comments in
addition I want to be really
clear that we don't propose the
concept all right to repair
right to cure in fact I think
the more important things this
is a really good idea.
What's the problem becomes as is
so often the legislature the W.
on the details it's how we do
that and I'm certainly
sympathetic to many of our local
construction companies and
subcontractors in particular the
subcontractors but their rights
should not be elevated at the
expense of aggrieved consumers
Mr chair and that's what
unfortunately some of the
definitions in particular this
legislation.
and I will get to detail into if
you are but.
Legislation and I would ask them
to look at some of the
definitions with respect.
For legislation has a F. as
drafted does not require that
the fielder build to the
building up so and it's also
about how whether or not.
The whole could be on behalf of
so what you have is the
factory owner for example in in
the stock of.
The whole.
The rental home on leave it may
render the home not for the life
of the consumer but it's not
gonna happen Mr Chairman in the
US would not believe that
consumers would not have any
recourse under this legislation
general sorry are certain trade
right.
First of we're more rural.
I will be here to do something
else.
And so I just want to say this
gentleman that I believe that
there are solutions in their
workable solutions to this
legislation into this issue with
this legislation doesn't get us
there and I appreciate again
said to us and I really
appreciate.
With the so that we can.
Of the bill that really quite
frankly reflects his intent I
think that reflects the intent
of the people that you hear
current slow because the bills
are read does not reflect that
impact on and Mr Chairman status
and I agree with who have less
his lawyer personal.
And I'm very proud of our
profession I'm a little bit
larger problem in but I will
tell you that the lawyers that I
know that I work with are for
ninety nine point nine percent
these are people who genuinely
care about the profession and if
someone is not a hearing to that
code of professionalism and
ethics they should absolutely
report to the discharge and I
would absolutely support that.
Thank you Mr thank I believe we
have one of on June.
In opposition.
Yeah Mister chair members of the
committee my name is rob trying
in in your arm and my coming
through yes.
So I'm consumer protection
internet
here in New Mexico a practice
only in New Mexico my entire
career I've been doing it for
twenty five years.
And the problem that I'd like to
bring before the committee about
this bill is something that
we've seen it's it's it's
entirely one sided and it's
entirely anti holder
and some of the things that have
been alluded to I think need a
closer look so for example the
the the the definition section
of the bill is very detailed and
one definition
contains words that are
the defined in the second
definition section but when you
break it all down it defines
defects is something that must
violate the code or impair the
structural integrity of
functionality of the dwellings.
So as we've heard we're going to
be looking at situations where
with that that's not true
perhaps is problems of windows
or perhaps is problems with the
stucco that's not going to be a
defect and that's not going to
be able to be addressed by the
law.
Second.
and this is really a big problem
your honor or.
This is really a big problem
Mr chair members of the
committee we it requires the
consumer the whole.
To send a letter where they give
you notice about today the fact
that that sounds fine and it
would be fine except when you
get into the details of what
that actually means as defined
in this bill.
And what it actually means is
they have to just maybe.
Read in reasonable detail each
alleged construction the fact.
Including the location of it.
And how it impairs the dwelling.
Now the problem of course with
this is people are just not
going to know.
People will not know why they
were sleeping.
They might not know where the
leak is really coming from where
the leak is on the on the rural
side you just see water coming
in through through your ceiling.
And the way this bill has been
drafted and list the homeowner
is able to essentially hire an
expert to come out and determine
all these defects in their
location and how the the
dwelling they're not going to
have a right to the redress
functions that are set forth in
the bill or alternately to the
courts.
thank you.
Thank you all right of we're
back in the bill anything lower
center before going to committee
no Mr Mr chair and I would just
note that
again we've we have been given
some technical pieces to this
this bill is going to Senate
Judiciary and I assure you
between now and Senate Judiciary
we're gonna sit down and do a
lot of work and and and really I
I again as as was mentioned
suggested changes and tweaks and
we need to get this right
everyone's committed to doing
that thank you all right at this
point we'll go to the committee.
The second motion for the past
well you're Senator Hamblen the
second by Senator Kernan.
With the growth Senator Griggs.
Yes I did they'll have questions
do we give the residual from the
asking a question that I just
got really excited he got really
excited.
Representative arms are for
real.
I do have several questions
so would you visit with me on
the floor tomorrow
Trying to help to okay all right
well it will before we go on
with the roll call continue with
we'll go we'll go ahead and give
Senator topic of question thank
you for share it's just been
real quick on some of the stuff
you all
Are you having more trouble with
spec homes are custom built all.
Do you know thank you your honor
I'm sorry.
Mr Chairman Senator Griggs what
we find is that most of these
mass action lawsuits occur with
large production builders in
large to the in subdivisions in
the easily these of these homes
are always under ten years old
because of the statute of repose
and so that these these these
subdivisions are sought out and
those homes are sold out so
they're not necessarily custom
you know more production
builders however I would say
that you know the the this type
of law they actually hold
conferences on this stuff and
they figured out a way to now go
after the custom home builders
and so this is an ever evolving.
Form of litigation.
And so what is the answer to
your question is yes and yes.
And we share and and and senator
experts
do you guys and and I don't know
how it works with the show but
this is the general contractor
often is responsible for the
responsible role work with for
the homeowners warranty.
At and I'm I'm gonna guess for
shared and and senator that you
guys find will show if you find
a home or warranty hello this is
that interface with what you're
you're trying to do here.
Mr chairman members the
committee center next it's a
great question we do have to
provide a warranty we provide at
least all speak for my company
internet specifically there is
no as far as I know there is no
requirement for a warranty under
the state statute it is
customary for like my general
liability policy is bundled with
a long term structural warranty
provided by a nationally you
know under written insurance
firm and so I find.
Essentially bumper to bumper
coverage for the first year and
I administer that warranty so I
have people that are paid to be
reactive to customer complaints
and customer issues that come in
they are documented they give us
pictures they describe what's
going on in reasonable detail so
we know who to send out to
repair it because we don't
inconvenience our homeowners
so really that's the way it
ought to work and it's really
only thing should get escalated
with eighty are if that's
prescribed in the contract or
litigation if it's not if I'm
being non responsive and not
perfect not performing up to
what I've agreed to
contractually I don't know if
that answers your question or
not.
For sure and centered and you
know it it does and then I I
guess are you she in issues.
That your state and outside the
warranty period or or how is
that has it planned out becuz it
surely looks like if you offered
to warranty.
Then vision issues shouldn't
hardly come up
but Mr chair and and and senator
you guys.
Just explain that a little bit
because this is this doesn't as
I read it there's no time frame
for the complaint and maybe
there is but as I was looking at
I didn't I didn't exactly catch
it so if you're if you're two
years out
Then.
Then boom you you're you're here
outside the warranty period and
by the by the claimant so we're
sure you maybe you guys could
respond to that Mr chair and can
centers yes that's correct we
to provide to the home builders
a warranty some builders are one
year similar to here so we do
basically bumper to bumper for
what I do drywall stucco for the
two years that's managed by the
home builder they'll call us if
they have a a and an issue with
the with the homeowner we
schedule the the appointment and
do the repair to their
satisfaction we get a sign off
that everything's okay with the
house so we do that for mostly
two years so between the second
year and the tenth here is where
the start coming in and and the
the attorneys are coming in that
are coming in of seven eight
nine years just under the ten
year limit of repose right and
the gather these homeowners up
and by that time there may be
another issue with stock or dry
wall or cabinet or tile that I
don't I'm not aware about
because we're out of war to the
builders out of warranty and
we're not we don't know about
him right so that's what we're
trying to do is if there's
something out there that we need
to prepare after the two years
it was significant enough to be
a defect let us know I mean I
many times I've gone out to
houses for five years later
because a homeowner home
builders I work for in in
respect for them into working
for them all do repairs right so
we're not opposed to do repairs
after the warranty but this all
happens after warranty and
before the ten years and then we
just get to the lawsuit not
knowing there's been any use or
defect in any any help sure Mr
chair and and share what you get
if you have basically to the
issue.
One of the measures is the claim
that time when they when they
come after after the other one
is what you have to do with with
your insurer or and the fact
that you have to turn it over to
them and and then that's you're
you're right you're going to go
up because that's what that's
what they do when they have to
pay the ultimately rage rage
rage in.
I want.
Mr chairman I want everybody
here to kind of compare this to
another issue we've got the
other issue we've got is medical
malpractice and doctors and as
we're doing certain things in
the in the legislature we're
increasing the cost of
malpractice insurance which go
wrong doctors out of state this
particular deal potentially runs
you guys out of state because
you can continue to operate with
the increased cost you face and
consumers as we were talking
about moments ago with the
Increase in prices will people
can't afford those and now with
the increase in interest rates
your price you're going to have
to come down because their their
price use here this what they
can buy they can either do it
because of the rates are low
they can buy more or if rates
are high the by election
this this sort of stuff is just
aged dollars in sensors we goal
show me shared and gentleman
that those are the the things
you can termination are worth a
managed as you go forward
there's some stuff that I think.
You can work with these guys on
the to come up with stuff on I'm
glad to hear because I would
have thought it would be this
way we thought it would be more
with a.
And you should back home with
the but the large scale builders
to that's what they do primarily
is build spec homes is that
there is more opportunity for
challenges with with those types
in a a custom home builder where
that that Haller excuse being
built for somebody in their
their a lot sure you can you can
develop the punch list you can
develop the things with them to.
To really address the challenges
I've got and I'm I'm gonna bring
up one last thing that I've been
wondering whether really want to
or not because this one doesn't
doesn't specifically deal with
this issue but one of the
biggest challenges the country's
page faces stems from an
incident that occurred right
around nineteen seventy.
Just before some of the folks in
your were born and it's some
other stuff but.
In nineteen seventy H. right
around there.
Lawyers were allowed to
advertise for the first time and
so what did you want to do and
you wind up having.
More fish in a barrel
and they have to make a living
from.
So Mr chair and share that with
you my comments I think we can
make thank you can make
something that works but.
I have a better picture of what
what's going on so thank you
thank you all right so we were
voting so if you can relate
Senator had a meal.
Yes Senator Kernan yes about six
but not the.
Senator Sanchez hope sorry
Senator Tallman yes.
Senator Wirth yes Senator
Hamblen yes.
And Senator Kernan thank you I
you know I didn't have any
questions but I just think it's
a certainly very important to do
this this isn't happening in my
area right now and I hope
they're not paying attention and
maybe they'll come to my area
but I will tell you we have
great developer stand they're
doing a great job many of my
friends have moved into some of
those subdivisions and and that
the fact that people are are
being this swept into this idea
that they can join some sort of
lawsuit and then find out what's
wrong with their home just seems
really really unusual and an
unfair and I hope that this
passes I hope that we can stop
this in Albuquerque and Santa Fe
and I hope it never gets to my
area I'll be very disappointed
we need those homes and we need
fairness and this isn't the
insurance company's fault and I
don't want to put blame on the
insurance companies have thank
you make make it work here they
are can lead and we see have
seen that in the other issues
that I won't go into right now
thank you.
Mr chair did they call your name
did you vote on the idea of the
last one okay in addition to the
test.
Make sure we get the chair wrote
in that three early seventy S.
motion thank you all right to
run low we have SB fifty two
Senator AUMENT.
We're gonna try and get through
all the bill so the we're gonna
do probably our stop at I.
Five o'clock maybe five fifty we
have a committee dinner tonight
at six OO.
The Senate folks know.
Representative this court.
This is.
Senator permission to go to
Florida.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr chair.
So
I don't have a expert witnesses
Mr chair because you sure the
would allow and of course.
Already.
So this thank you for.
In this in a timely fashion
early in the in the session but
it's a very straightforward
simple bill the.
Child tax credit.
it would increase the increase
of across the board fifteen
percent
To.
It currently the range now is
from
Hundred seventy five of.
Dollars to twenty five dollars
per child and this bill would
increase that tax credit amount
Resulting in a range of this.
of.
Of of.
Of the two hundred dollars to to
to to to twenty nine dollars
So it's a fifty percent across
the board of increase with the
the decreasing amount depending
on the see your salary so the.
The FIR points out the
additional exceeds.
For spans a tax expenditure the
cost of difficult to determine
but like.
But likely significant LFC has
serious concerns about the
significant risks of state
revenues.
From tax expenditures an
increase in revenue volatility
from the erosion of the revenue
base but this.
For India if iris only eleven
the eleven million dollars.
The increase but is my
understanding that there
Several of.
Bills in the works that would
to.
With the.
Change the tax brackets.
In all likelihood that those
change text particularly with
result in increased revenue
which would offset the eleven
million dollars it's that's
predicted to be a lost in this
particular bill Nye I did for
consider a doing a bill that
would increase.
Make a significant change in the
in the tax brackets because we
have one bracket the goes from
twenty four thousand to
somewhere in the neighborhood of
a hundred eighty to two hundred
to a thousand.
But the US economists up in the
bill drafting section.
Well it first eight if you look
at that and you think it would
be very progressive we need to
look at a tax bracket that goes
from twenty four thousand two
roughly hundred eighty thousand
but this economist at a study
and showed it really was much
more correct progressive than
you would think so then I
decided not to mess with the tax
brackets because of that and
decided to go with an increase
in the child tax credit because
it's small is is targeted to low
income folks who need a lot more
of that need a lot need a lot of
assistance in
Reducing their.
Income tax burden.
So you know as a lot of folks in
that low income tax brackets
that can't afford childcare.
So they have to thank have to
quit their job.
So that was the thinking behind
this bill Mr chair was to.
target.
Some income tax relief for the.
The low income folks because
after because after looking at
the tax existing tax brackets.
and surprisingly found that they
weren't they were more
progressive than you might think
that concludes my remarks Mister
chair we've opened to.
Any questions all right thank
you senators so this time we'll
go to the audience anybody in
support of Senate bill fifty
two.
Hello Mister chair members of
the committee my name is that
incentive you know pull them
into New Mexico Center online
poverty we stand in support of
this bill because it will
benefit every child in New
Mexico increasing the child
income tax credit will not only
help families but it will boost
our economy this increase the
child tax credit will have many
proven benefits including
improvements improving infant
and maternal health reducing
childhood hunger and increasing
New Mexican outcomes across the
state with low income families
the greatest benefit from these
reasons we stand in support of
the thank you.
So that.
Okay thank you anybody else in
the audience in support of
Senate bill fifty two.
But we have a the person on
soon.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee my name is Katie
and I am a senior research and
policy analyst New Mexico voices
for children and we also stand
in support of Senate bill could
be two and a show that credits
like the child tax credits can
have a budget for a family and I
went to improvements in child
and maternal health stronger
education outcomes and reduce
hunger and poverty we really
appreciate the sponsor and
recognizing the importance and
potential of our state child tax
credit in improving family
economic security for children
throughout New Mexico I would
however like to also bring to a
similar bill on maps house bill
one forty four that would
provide a substantial increase
in our CTC for families with low
and middle income specifically
and it also affects the credit
amounts moving forward so that
they wouldn't lose their value
over time so I would certainly
support this bill in its concept
and increasing our child tax
credit a more substantial
increase targeted to those who
are struggling the most
financially is more likely to
provide the benefits and impact
our kids really need at this
happens again we think that
sponsors for this bill and we
hope this committee will support
increasing our state tax credit
thank you.
Okay.
Thank you so we'll go to
The company's position thank
you.
I don't see anybody in
opposition.
Hello the committee any
questions from the committee.
You and.
With Senator Griggs.
Thank you for sharing that.
When you know the credit the
credit goes up
you know to twelve.
over right over three hundred
fifty thousand dollars you're
gonna get a four dollar
the increased child tax credit
which you're probably didn't
that mean much
Would it be and I I don't know
if we're trying to really help
the folks that are that are need
more help maybe go a little
higher and stop at a hundred
thousand dollars not not given
any additional.
Hey any the higher income.
Numbers with with much help and
I guess one of the things to Mr
chair and senator.
Are there any are there any of
the tax bills that are in New
Mexico going to change you know
standard deduction which may
have a have an impact on on
stuff like this
because I I mean with federal
Stephanie changes tax deductions
were you didn't.
I don't know whether they
exactly workers I don't have the
I have a kid that that fit in
that when that standard
deduction went up I mean the
whole goal that was to simplify
reporting and laminate you know
I am the budget deductions
so I don't know I don't know
where we're headed in in New
Mexico to but I.
That there might be some of the
changes to that so Mr chair
Senator have you heard you know
Mr chair Senator that's correct
there are some tax opposes that
would increase the.
The direction.
Which which may affect this
potential that that's why as
Mr chair and so that's why the.
We're gonna vote on this bill
today with.
Come back and they can take that
into consideration when they
decide whether to include this
bill in the package.
So your point is well taken
thank you thank you for sorry
senator Neville.
Thank you Mr chair might just
have a so Senator we've met with
grandparents raising
grandchildren before the session
started and one of the questions
they asked is there would be a
tax credit because we have one
grandparent who said she never
thought she'd have to raise four
grandchildren and now because of
that she said I have four
growing boys and I don't think
you have to be done and so I
just want to thank you for
bringing this forward because
the grandparents did ask about
that Mr Chairman just a comment
no questions thank you thank
you.
Rios.
I know that we're not gonna take
any action on this particular
bill also want to thank the
sponsor for presenting and we
will look at what other of you
know taxes with regard to the
tile Tax Court or forthcoming
see if this fits in with part of
the package thank you thank you
Mr chair thank you committee for
your.
Time and consideration today
thank you.
You Senate bill fifty five
Senator Campos.
For the
for.
The.
So
okay.
This is really of a.
Go ahead senator thank you very
much Mr chairman members members
of the committee it's great to
go ahead and be here with you
today.
There is a student from New
Mexico highlands university who
is also here with me and he's
been observing this afternoon
but the reason I bring that up
because one of the lessons here
at the rental site for the
privilege to be got.
Well I am gonna go ahead and
produce expert witness in a few
minutes but the the reason the
reason why I am I'm making this
up this Madam if I may
the student again is in the
audience and with that one of
the lessons of the legislature
is to practice patience and so
one of the reasons why he's here
and while I was sitting up here
very quietly listening is that
as we do move forward there so
many parts to this process and
and again I just want to go
ahead and point out that I
really respect the committee in
that process but along with that
there are a lot of lessons to be
learned as we move forward so Mr
he introduce your student
please.
I I sure will and I'm gonna go
ahead and ask him to stand into
that has been with me with
committees he's been of
presenting he's been doing all
these things so he's there in
the back of the please stand and
introduce themselves and I'll
I'll explain why I teach people
this way so.
Thank you up the bottom line is
clear enough I'm a sophomore at
makes one's immerses business
administration.
All right Senator Campos dollar
thank you for being here thank
you thank you very much Mr
chairman again with that process
as I bring students in I I
really let them express
themselves and so along with
that he's been doing an
excellent job with that today so
Mister chair and of course
members of the of the Committee
with me today is a JD Bullington
he is the expert witness as we
discuss Senate bill fifty five
so this is Senate bill fifty
five would create the state
transit Fund and it would
appropriate any money in the
fund to the department of
transportation and this bill
basically allows transit
agencies including the tribe's
municipal county regional
transit districts and agencies
to receive state funding which
then the local agency would use
to match federal funds the the
setting up of this fund is
imperative and the reason for
that because as we continue to
go ahead and roll with transit
to
funds and and with the
transportation itself in our
municipalities and tribal
governments what we're finding
is if we can set up if you will
the impactful piece of having a
resources to leverage it
definitely would help
particularly in some of these
areas where they're trying to
develop transportation units but
it's very difficult to do
because and just about is
particularly do not have the
funds to do so with that Mr
chair if I may I'd like to also
differ right now two of my
expert Mister JD Bullington.
Thank you Mr thank you Mr
chairman members of the
committee and and thank you
Senator Campos for bringing this
bill forward my name is JT
Dalton I'm the registered
lobbyists for the New Mexico
transit Association this is the
coalition of municipalities
counties all around the state
including Santa Fe Albuquerque
Los crucis Farmington pots Los
Alamos you name it
that have a responsibility and
a duty to provide public transit
and we have we are one of the
only states in the nation that
does not fund public transit
directly at the state level we
are dependent on the local
funding and we're dependent on
federal funding.
here's here's the problem we
have been trying to create a
pipeline for some state funding
for several years and our
economy sort of been up and down
and this is been a real
challenge and we've tried to
approach this from there many
different points of view what we
would like to do is create a
fund now this is currently an
empty fund and I know that that
is.
You know a point of concern
sometimes going forward but we
think of with the revenue
situation the state New Mexico
in a week we can put some money
into this fund which then could
be used as a match and leverage
more money in here's the
challenge we have.
I have the data if you look at
all three congressional
districts on average fifty
percent of the process all three
congressional districts need
replacement right now and that
price tag is huge these these
these needs these buses get
crowded out by other capital
outlay requests
they just don't seem to be a
priority so we need to fund that
can help pay for these buses
these buses they took they are
constantly starting and stopping
they have a lifespan of only
about six to seven years believe
it or not because there's so
much wear and tear on on these
buses there's a lot of benefits
to public transit that I won't
go into but it a public transit
is a fact of our life and it is
dramatically under funded not
just buses but projects for up
Americans with disabilities act
the bus stops I know that the
the repair station in Carlsbad
for example I've had
conversations with this doctor
Representative Kathy brown they
can't they can't keep up they
don't have the facility to keep
up with the maintenance to keep
all the buses that they have
running and on the street and in
good repair so this is a serious
problem and it's going to get
worse if we don't do something
so we're asking for you to help
us move this fund a long and we
think we can get some money into
it and get a revenue stream
going so we can use it for
federal match thank you Mr chair
thank you Mr chair available for
questions already so before will
go questions will go to the
audience of anybody in support
of US Senate bill but I.
Scott Scanlon registered
lobbyists for the Norse in.
Transnistrian or as they're
known up here the blue bus folks
and we have to L. standing
supporters of the blue bus folks
just Committee and thank you
both members we stand in strong
support of of this bill for all
the reasons that the sponsor in
the and the experts have
testified to
we have our buses run.
From the Colorado border all the
way to the city of.
You're at the City of Santa Fe
and they go back and forth up
and down all around day after
day and this is a real problem
if we're trying to move people
into the public transit if we're
trying to do something about the
air and all sorts of other
weather and climate issues I
think this is a very strong
building we were to support
thank you madam chair thank you
Scott anybody else in the room
in support of this bill.
Fiscal.
We come up a little bit closer
to the microphone can pick you
up thank you so much more
members check check.
my name is Richard moody I'm a
member of the New Mexico
veterans and military families
caucus
The transport transportation
budget for the New Mexico
department of veterans services
for twenty twenty three is only
fifty thousand dollars to
provide services to the
thousands of veterans living in
rural areas well not
specifically mentioned in this
bill Senate bill fifty five
could alleviate some of the
troubled veterans having getting
from rural locations to medical
appointments in the VA hospital
in Albuquerque for instance by
providing funding for alternate
modes of transportation veterans
and military family caucus
supports this legislation
legislation thank you.
Thank you so much anybody online
I don't have very many online
and support.
Kate anybody ons online in
opposition of this bill.
Anybody in the audience in
opposition of this bill.
Right now I go to the committee
are there any questions or any
participation from the
committee.
Just really quick money again I
think the fact that there's not
money in here yet just fine I've
got a bill that Senator Campos
hearing Senate finance tomorrow
that has money it's going to go
away.
You know you gotta get the fund
in place of the of the vehicle
so the appropriators can go put
the money and so I mean I think
this is.
Part of our discussion about
what we can do with all this
nonrecurring money what better
way to put it into a long term
planning and I mean I think it's
a great idea just appreciate
that.
Thank you senator Wirth anybody
else in the committee.
Before I go to Senator had any
of public do perhaps if there's
no other questions or comments
hold on we have a we have a due
pass we have a second from
Sierra before we vote on this
before when I have you call the
roll I am fully aware of just
the needs you know and gentleman
was talking about veterans our
rural communities are heavily
dependent on these trends and
opportunities or lack there of
which is why we need to continue
to support those and so thank
you Senator Campos for bringing
this forward we certainly
appreciate that you madam chair
and at this point when we take a
roll call vote.
We're voting on this bill for
the second I yes Sierra
seconded.
Sentiment how to meal time made
a motion.
Can you tell schools.
Senator how to meal yes Senator
Kernan yes Senator Lopez yeah.
Senator Clemente yes Senator
Wirth yes Senator Hamblen yes.
When.
Six four and three absent for
absent.
Six four six six oh six four
five that six the number four
okay so you you have it at this
point the UNM six zero we do
have three absent but the
regulation to the moves on to
the next.
And members of the committee
really particularly.
We do have I know Senator souls
is on his way he was expecting
to do this and so we are going
to have to go in order I don't
expect his bill to take a while
we do want to get two years
before we we have a hard stop at
five o'clock Senator Padilla.
So if you don't mind waiting
waiting place just for a moment
percent our souls to get here.
And and then we'll we'll move
on.
You know I want to move as
quickly.
So the next bill we are going to
be hearing this from Senator
souls it is Senate bill fifty
six distributed generation
facility supply cap.
And then most likely it and then
what we will do is is finished
off with Senator Padilla is
Senate bill sixty two office of
entrepreneurship and innovation.
Okay
Yeah okay.
Some.
I'm sorry.
Bill seems very.
Straightforward.
Senator Padilla how how do you
feel your your bill will go.
She said that twenty second.
Hold on just a second.
Center city and get up there.
We're gonna move on will we'll
bring in Senator souls this
shortly afterward but we are
listening to Senate bill sixty
two office of entrepreneurship
and innovation from Senator for
the thank you madam chair
members of the committee thank
you for hearing us today yes so
I think you all know that I've
been working for several years
to find ways to support
entrepreneurs that are
innovating new things here in
New Mexico so we can attempt to
do our best to to support them
with with services that get them
to focus on on their their craft
and what they're inventing in
the intellectual property
they're inventing with all the
different services around the
marketing human resources
technology
you know all the different
technical support same in the
day the that they might need so
that we can that support them
and keep them here in New Mexico
we have students coming in doing
a lot of this work at UNM New
Mexico tech New Mexico state and
then we just have people in the
community they're doing a
fabulous job of creating things
so what this office of
entrepreneurship and innovation
would do and and and several
members of the house so I worked
with throughout the year we have
a a bill in the house as well
would essentially create this
office of of entrepreneurship
and innovation it would create
an advice on entrepreneurship
entrepreneurship and innovation
advisory committee and then it
would also create a fund that
would also start very small so
that we don't sort of triple
written we do we make sure that
we set up the right way
but seven hundred so thousand to
to set up the office was
professionals to help do all
this work and then grow from
there based on what they would
come back with and then a two
million dollar fund that would
allow for loans up to five
hundred thousand dollars so that
they get that that sweet spot of
money that they need to get to
the next level we do have their
of their various things that go
on in the community from the SBA
to to a few others but those are
primarily businesses that are
already in action and this is to
stand up these entrepreneurs
that are just you know be in the
Raman noodles and and inventing
things and and doing a really
good job I know we all know them
I know you know some of our own
family members have done this
and and done a wonderful job
doing it.
I just happen to have Mr New
Mexico nineteen eighty here
and he he he he's got a lot to
say in terms of our state
investment council all the
various things that he's done in
his career from the Chicago
board of trade I think we all
know his his his are many of us
know his his resume I engage
with him quite a bit madam chair
members of the committee for the
CNM ingenuity centre the stem
work that they do there and he's
just working really hard to
support the exact same people
that I'm here to talk to you
about today so I'm gonna ask Mr
here lavender to say just a few
words and then we'll take some
questions whenever you're ready
thank you senator of madam chair
Mister chair I'm not sure who's
who the madam chair.
The and members of the committee
I really appreciate the
opportunity to come before you
guys today the I think.
What I can see in New Mexico
after having moved back here
thirteen years ago is that
entrepreneurship has kind of
been the the step child the the
angry stepchild out the window
and I think that what we're
seeing now is an opportunity for
entrepreneurism to really have a
significant effect in New Mexico
I think my I believe let's grow
our own that's that's critical
but the.
Following our own lets people
and that's been the biggest
problem in the course of my
working in this particular area
since sixteen what we watch
things happen as we watch
companies to people with great
ideas great companies start get
started and then leave there are
you there and you know Austin or
there and San Jose or there are
somewhere else and our and and
you know I'm for one and really
tired of seeing that so I think
this bill I think laser great
framework for keeping keeping
helping us keep entrepreneurs in
New Mexico I think that there
are.
Issues about the process and I
believe that this bill is wide
enough written.
Widely enough I was a little
hard written widely enough to
allow for the implementation in
such a way that really matters
so I'll be happy to answer any
questions that the committee
might have are the chair and I
think that can't tell you how
much I just really support this
and I believe all of the
entrepreneurial community with
which I work also supports this.
Thank you Mr madam chair excuse
me and and and there's there are
many details here in terms of
what the office will do how the
fund will work and who will have
oversight over it you know one
of the critical items that I
think most people when I was
starting my business over twenty
years ago it was almost as
though the state of New Mexico
in the City of Albuquerque we're
trying to convince me not to go
into business and create jobs
the this this is a great team of
people that are going to help
navigate state government help
navigate local governments
licensing all the different
permits that they may need to to
go through and all that so we'll
take some questions whenever
you're ready I know you want to
keep moving great thank you very
much Senator are there any folks
in the audience that are in
support of this bill which could
then come on up and and state
your name and if you will go
ahead and make your comments.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is Mary Kay
route registered lobbyists for
The New Mexico restaurant
association we stand in very
strong support of this bill
small businesses employ more
than half of our workforce and
this type of support and
empowerment for our innovators
and entrepreneurs will help our
economy come stronger and more
diverse would like to thank the
sponsor for bringing this
visionary legislation thank you.
Thank you so much anybody else
in the audience in support of
this bill.
We have surface Gerald online in
support of this bill Sir would
you please on yourself and go
ahead and give your testimony.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee I'm
cert sterile senior vice
president of the greater
Albuquerque chamber of commerce
and we are in support of this
bill I'll keep it brief a lot of
work is been done in recent
years to provide more
opportunities for companies to
access capital provide
commercial space change job
training including funds to help
them grow but we know that
there's so much more sticking to
to partner with entrepreneurs in
those initial development and
testing phases and alternately
encourage their exploration and
started here in New Mexico
economic diversification over
the long haul depends on a
supporting entrepreneurs in key
growth industries today and this
bill provides the infrastructure
for that support thank you.
Great thank you very much
anybody else show up online.
Okay and there's nobody opposed
online.
And I again just checking nobody
opposed in the office the
audience mentor who say one
small thing very quick I just
want to thank your staff who has
done a wonderful job of giving
to me some great advice and all
the different background that
that that your staff has right
now I know that we move our
staff we have a lot of staff to
come and go but yes right with
right now that are helping us on
this to thank you.
Right thank you any questions or
comments from the committee
Senator Kernan thank you madam
chair and and senator and miss
lavender and just it reading the
FIR it appears that there might
be some concerns on the part of
the economic development
department with regard to
additional FTE ease and and
concerns with with regard to the
to the committee that will be
making the loans and that they
have time to to do the oversight
for you in sync with the
department now in our state
pretty much on board since are
gonna have to manage this it
that thank you madam chair and
and senator so initially I was
not going to come to you with
the need for for actual
appropriations for staffing and
this and that but if you look at
the bill on page two starting
really at the top on line one
just outlines that in in the
first passed in the offices
created there would be a
director appointed and and that
the funding for that is in the
approach appropriation amounts
in the later in the bill and
then that it outlines what they
would have responsibility for or
what we would expect that we
don't want to give them too many
much direction we want them to
be innovative that's the whole
point of the bill is to be
innovative in terms of how they
would set this office of so so I
think that we would apply the
fears of the departments I put
that in there specific staffing
I was initially thinking well
gosh you know we have a can see
rates here maybe when they fill
those vacancy rates they could
use that staffing to set to work
here but this helps them with
additional staffing and and bump
them to do that thank you madam
chair and tell me about the the
membership of the committee and
appoints those and is that
totally from the governor's
appointing presidents yes thank
you madam chair and and and
senator so you go to page three
the advisory board starts on
line seven wealth starts online
I in detail on line seven I want
to keep the small and have folks
that really are directly engaged
with with what we're up to here
so the secretary or the
secretary's designee I felt.
You know they're they're
engaging economic development
morning noon and night some and
I'm assuming that the designator
the secretary whoever that is
would have a lot of very
important permission to share
their the president of the State
University so this would be UNM
NMSU New Mexico tech or their
designees so there I'm assuming
they're gonna get someone maybe
from the science and tech park
over UNM next the I still feel
that might be the person that
the designated this committee
and then a member of of the
public who really has been
engagement Namik Development
entrepreneur innovation we have
a lot of entrepreneurs that have
done a great job why would we
just capitalize on appointing
one of them to this board that's
why some of that with.
K. and madam chair with regard
to the loans that are going to
be made by this committee they
have this sets the interest rate
in I did they develop that to
the rulemaking process or.
In the state thank you madam
chair Senator it exactly what
you just said which would be
rulemaking they'd have a guard
rail with no more than five
hundred thousand dollars per so
it may be that let's say they
analyzed reviewed and approved
for a home that would only for
all two million over there would
only be for loans we're going
over time those returns on
invested would come in they'd be
able to utilize those monies to
further expand and and make that
thing a little more meaningful
I'm I'm.
Guessing that they they would
rely heavily on the gentleman
our summer team like like the
state investment council like
the gentleman to the left of me
here lavender to use the the the
prudent investor rules and all
the different things that that
the state investment council as
we have a lot of experts that
would help them that way thank
you that's all madam chair thank
you senator Senator Tallman do
you still want to ask your
question.
Thank you thank you madam chair
two quick questions except short
answer.
Why why isn't this a.
Place under the economic
Development Department why you
went to the governor have to
make the appointment I can't be
administered by the economic
development of our.
Mr chairman and and so madam
chair and the Senator I I'm not
maybe maybe not following the
question exactly why is the is
the office being placed in the
department of economic
development.
The.
Separate from the economic
development of our the noted met
Mr Madam chair and Senator no it
it's it's what the economic
development department does
again like I said earlier
morning noon and night this is
this is directly in their
wheelhouse so they would have
We appoint many boards that roll
up to various departments that
are appointed by the governor
whether the department as an
option.
What was okay.
So.
Thank you madam chair thank you
in the secondly what.
The FIR says that
On page three the the currently
the.
The department offers a walk
range of support to
entrepreneurs.
So what are you gonna be doing
that you can have it all part of
it is already doing.
we would be focus primarily on
entrepreneurs and innovators the
department has Mr madam chair.
Senator they have a wide range
of things that they do if it
were if there were if they were
doing this we would have to come
before you and and ask you for
this office to be created so
we've also worked in the in a
room with a Representative Dixon
a few others to to figure out
how best to support
entrepreneurs verses the larger
companies the the product on the
department is is focused on
bringing into the state or
existing companies looking them
up this is this this spot of
people that are out there
creating new and vibrant and
exciting things.
Thank you Mister chair itself.
you don't feel that the we have
a detailed Department is filling
in the that you feel needs to be
met that correct segment
thank you madam chair and
senator I think that we need to
directed focus on this when I
created the office of broadband
access and expansion there are a
lot of entities in state
government that we're working on
broadband
there was very little
coordination the through put on
a dollar was was very poor this
is going to bring some of that
focused directly to these
individuals and lift them up and
help them succeed.
Thank you thank you Mr chair and
there is a madam chair.
I lost track madam.
I know Benny and I looks.
Yeah so thank you madam chair
that's all and thank you for
bringing this bill forward.
Both of the week yes thank you
senator Clemente before I make
my comments any other questions
from the committee.
I do have one quick question
before I ask for what the Willis
of the committee
I'm wondering if there are age
limits and let me give you a
little bit of context on this
because in Los crucis we have a
program that I get to the
wonderful opportunity of making
trophies for and M. C. there
Vance it's the kids can youth
entrepreneurship program and
this program is actually under
the community action agency of
Southern New Mexico these are
young people ages eight to
sixteen who are learning how to
do business they are creating a
product they are understanding
advertising their understanding
budgeting and money management
and profit and loss these are
young people with business
licenses that they're required
to have and it's an amazing
program young woman made felted
animals that were super popular
if you want to be able to sell
felt the Chiles to one of our
locally owned shops to where
they can go ahead and sell those
candles jewelry one young man
was actually making fly you know
I am not a Fisher person but the
flies on the spot for people who
loved fishing and that kids
stuff went like that and so I'm
wondering that you know they're
certainly not brick and mortar
yet but they do have
opportunities to sell our
farmers market and they have a a
market twice a year and so I'm
wondering is there an age limit
on the opportunities that these
young people would be able to
benefit from this department and
would you consider making sure
that there isn't a restriction
for these young people madam
chair there is nothing in the
legislation that I have for you
that says that there's any
appropriations to anyone
participating in it I'll tell
you when I saw the very first
business I started was a pay
phone business and that's how I
want to open the document.
And and I was about fourteen
when I did it and and I had
about thirty eight loans all
over Albuquerque I really wish
this and been around I went I
got my actual business up around
a lot faster the settlement
madam chair I and the members of
the committee I'm not thousand
sure the protocol but I would
like to add the people you're
talking about those kids are
exactly who can take advantage
of this bill of this al this
concept because you know we're.
As a goal of those Senator
Padilla said as they grow up
this is exactly what you need
you know we were I have said
this earlier about and Senator
Shendo said this at recognize it
with this thing that they leave
the that's what happens these
kinds of funds are available to
a lot of companies use young
companies I think this is this
is exactly I mean a lot of a lot
the those are the people we want
to see.
And and and madam chair when I
started my business once again
outside there were multiple
things at this office will do
frontrunners.
Probably that I was even
thinking that I needed and so
it's going to be a great support
for individuals I appreciate
that the six grade I made
plaster Karia signs.
To my classmates for holiday
Garia so I'm very grateful for
this opportunity of.
I started working madam chair
when I was eleven so probably I
don't know started working when
I was thirteen
this.
That's why I needed the support.
All right what is the will of
the committee.
So I have a second.
Senator Wirth the second when we
go ahead take a roll call of.
Tom and made the initial with
made seconded.
The
great.
Senator how to meal yes Senator
Kernan yes Senator.
Madam yes.
Senator Wirth strong yes.
Yes sorry.
The is.
My heart.
All right six in favor one
opposed to your bill goes on
next committee thank you very
much very much for going to
finish off with Senator souls
thank you for waiting and coming
back and waiting and coming
back.
Well it is okay so I get it I
get to close out.
All right we're Senate bill
fifty six distributed generation
facility supply capped thank you
madam chair of this bill is
changes the arbitrary cap of a
hundred twenty of the solar or a
TV system on a house of a
hundred and twenty percent of
the average annual usage that
was very important when it was
first put in to keep people from
putting in a huge amount that
that had to be sold back to the
Electric Company they had to buy
it very high racks that were in
place initially to stimulated
those of almost all gone away
now and this cap now gets in the
way when people are trying to
put in the system as they moved
to an all electric including
electric vehicle charging
changing from gas does to
induction stoves changing their
gas furnace out to put in the
geothermal heat pumps for
instance those all require extra
electricity this takes away the
arbitrary hundred twenty percent
cap that would keep them from
doing that so that they can
right size the system I know
there are likely some people are
going to bring up concerns about
consumer protection if you all
remember we passed the consumer
protection bill a few years back
and so those protections are
already in place and with that
I'd stand for questions that are
so this is the bill was brought
in for conservation yes okay.
all right do you have an expert
at all or you're you're the
expert okay.
You're the expert right now.
I hear you anybody in the
audience supporting this bill.
Hi Jim I want to go ahead and
come on up.
Even though you just walked in.
Racing from across anybody else
will Jim is getting his notes
together anybody else in support
of while he's getting his nose
to gather anybody in the
audience supposed.
One two three four okay anybody
online opposed.
Okay so let's go ahead and get
Jim will have Jim speak first
and we'll have the rest of you
speak will also have the person
who is online service all those
are you'll be speaking next
online.
To make sure you hold the button
there you go okay
thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee my name is Jim day
sure to and I'm with the
renewable energy industry
association of New Mexico we
have sixty diverse members been
around since two thousand four
for many years there's been an
arbitrary limit on how much
solar can be installed on a home
or business at a hundred twenty
percent of historical usage.
Well this period is prevented
people from properly sizing
systems to anticipate their
increase electrical uses this
problem has become more acute
with the increased interest in
building electrification and
electric vehicles.
You may hear from opponents
opponents of this bill side the
need for grid safety and
reliability to keep this
arbitrary limit in place but
it's a false narrative because
there is the interconnection
rule seventeen dot nine dot five
six eight that is in the process
of being updated that requires
extensive screening process by
utilities for all solar systems
connected to the grid you also
may hear that it's a consumer
protection requirement but I
will submit that we don't have
such requirements for how big of
cars that people come by how big
of a home you can buy so I also
suggest that that's a false
narrative we urge the committee
to pass this bill so that we can
eliminate unnecessary barriers
to the adoption of solar thank
you very much thank you Jim also
want to thank you Rico Gonzales
for let me know the we do have
to people online and support so
Serra if you will please on mute
yourself I do want to point out
that we are trying to wrap this
up at fifteen after five at the
latest so those of you who are
here the audience and here on
and online if you can just kind
of be aware of the time so Sir
if you will please and yourself.
Yes thank you good evening madam
chair and members of the
committee my name is Sarah
Salazar and I'm a member
representing the New Mexico
chapter of the American
institute of architects A. I. in
New Mexico with over five
hundred members around the state
support at the fifty six
addressing climate change
increasing renewable energy and
resiliency our priorities for a
I.
In two thousand one excuse me
twenty twenty one the global
building and construction sector
accounted for thirty four
percent of the overall energy
demand good design ideally looks
twenty trees and buildings so as
times change we don't have to
demolish and rebuild over again.
On site renewable generation is
also a common tool for
appropriate sustainable design.
If you trade activity in
buildings includes allowing for
different energy needs that
can't always be known now
caps of the generation that are
out of step with national
standards and current technology
stand in the way of reaching
energy goals and don't
encouraging necessary current
modernization.
We also recognize that balancing
responded installation with
distributed generation is
important.
Our state's energy
interconnection rules and manual
kept pace with the federal
energy regulatory commission and
New Mexico Ian Energy his
findings and recommendations
going forward following passage
of the energy grid modernization
roadmap act twenty twenty this
could be a more appropriate
location for any cap on
renewable energy distributed
generation to both ensure great
infrastructure is not confirmed
and also allows increase
capacity as modernization
occurs.
In summary taking away this
inflexible distributed
generation cap combined with
sensible and timely updates to
the rules for interconnection
with our energy grid will move
New Mexico tort our energy
transition goals while
maintaining grid reliability we
support SB fifty six and thank
senator cels for bringing this
down thank you thank you Serra
Jeannie if you will please on
yourself and go ahead and give a
brief testimony.
Yes hello can you hear me now
yes we can.
Thank you my name is Jean Austin
and I represent the league of
women voters of New Mexico.
The league supports policies
that
Will incentivize people to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions
by moaning greater energy
efficiency this means installing
solar and wind energy of we are
concerned about the limited
would decrease the incentive for
people to prepare for a full
transition to electrification I
myself personally have
experience that and so what we
would do is to support
eliminating this opportunity can
thank you.
Thank you very much all right so
we've got folks in the room
again by show of hands who's in
opposition one two three four
five okay Jennifer you will
please go ahead and come up
behind Senator souls and if we
can be aware of the time.
Hello.
Mr Chairman madam chairman woman
recalled in sauce without Paso
electric.
The the hundred and twenty
percent on on the on the cap is
not necessarily arbitrary it is
a hundred percent use of
the homeowner or the small
business person in the that has
the rooftop or DG plus twenty
percent and so when you go
through the twelve month
calendar someone to produce a
lot in use a little bit of
energy and some months you
produce a lot of energy and use
a lot of energy and so at the
end of the day did it evens out.
I I think it as as people begin
to get Tesla's and and leaves
Jim Jim has a leaf
you let us know what what what
is in your system you can
increase your system and so that
that is not arbitrary.
And then the consumer protection
I understand what they're saying
that it is you know something
that that that we have an act
on.
But I have to take the calls I
average I've average at that I
was looking at my numbers about
five a year where there are
mostly seniors who are taken
advantage of by solar companies
and at least a hundred twenty
percent we have somewhat of a
cap on the on the pricing for
for what the the solar companies
would be selling to folks if if
they're bad actors and believe
me most of the companies that we
work without past electric great
people we get systems in they
get a mon and we move forward
there's just a few that have
been really really bad actors
and so that that's where we see
that hundred twenty percent
being an effective tool
for both consumer protection and
use that one's home or business
and with that I'll leave my
comments there thank you madam
chair one.
Next.
Good afternoon madam chair
chairman members of the
committee had Roose my with the
New Mexico rural electric
cooperative association and I
got have to point one is anytime
you deal with electricity.
There's danger and so are in two
thousand twenty two electrical
contacts across the United
States increased.
Thank goodness that did not
happen here in New Mexico but
they have increased the the
latest fatality was a young man
twenty two years old in Ohio.
So what occurs is you got back
feed when the system is
oversized you go back feed that
for that power flows in rivers
and so when when I'm in or out
there isolating a problem.
Sometimes it may take time to
isolate the problem and you may
be working on a hot wire and so
yes Sir there is danger when
working on that system.
The other issue is.
From a consumer protection
standpoint we had in one of our
co ops our system was way over
bills.
And it took months to resolve
the issue with the call up the
the customer and the solar
company for the coop in the
customer had to go to the
attorney general's office and
the consumer complaint division
at the PRC two funny get the
issue resolved so there is
issues out there respective
consumer complaints so consumer
protection thank you so we
respectfully oppose this bill.
The.
I would like to before you make
your testimony just know that I
would like to give the committee
at least ten to fifteen minutes
to go ahead and ask questions so
if you can.
Keep your your points concise
place.
madam chair members of the
committee Carlos looser with the
Public Service Company New
Mexico in this is more I just
wanna voicing concerns you know
it's you know I I have talked to
the sponsor briefly and and some
other you know solar companies
and also with our our colleagues
at the other utilities it's more
of a concern because this bill
is for solar leases it's because
right now if you own your so
your solar system out right you
can you can build it as large as
you want as long as it stays
within the electrical code.
This bill here under sixty two
dash thirteen yes thirteen one
is for lease systems and that's
a that's where you heard all
past electric with the concerns
you know any kind of you know is
when you know when we have a
great relationship with our
local companies and it's just
one of those things where of.
If these start over sizing the
the least
said solar facilities then those
could you know the then those
but most ball of owner will
customers who may not know
exactly what they're purchasing.
Maybe have an oversight system
and then they don't really get
the benefits of you know the
racks
the you know to the only in the
system though it's just in the
system so I mean the those are
just the concerns that we have
and and I understand we do have
consumer protection laws in
place but I just try we really
wanted to bring to the
committees attention that it is
as for the least systems and
some of the concerns we have
thank you.
Madam chair Mister chairman
Robert Romero on behalf of two
because of the trickle up as
many of you know kit Carson now
is providing a hundred percent
solar power during the daytime
within with them solar arrays
distributed around their service
area so if if the systems over
bills there's no capacity for
this extra solar power and we'll
have the problem that mysteries
one was was mentioning without
batteries or something else they
can to handle anymore solar so
that working with their with
their customers to make sure
that the right size of solar
systems because there's not
capacity thank you.
Chairs and and members of the
committee my name is Bernard
treat and act manager government
affairs for Xcel energy serve
the east side of the state I
respectfully with excel opposes
this bill remember X.
respectfully on the court in the
Mara Rico wasn't as so Rico good
luck but anyways
I just
You know the a lot of the
conversations around the utility
stuff electricity we forget
about the the engineering side
of this and there's a lot goes
into that to serve people
reliably.
Safely economically but we also
have a crews out there every day
that that we we work really hard
to keep them safe so with the
other comments made we
respectfully oppose thank you.
All right thank you very much I
would like to point out on page
three line six it says owned or
leased by the host it's not just
a least bill my correct on that
Senator souls yes that's my
understanding to the most of
these our own but there are some
companies that lease rooftop
space but those effectively are
still used by the host at the
site great any questions or
comments by the committee
Senator Kernan thank you very
much madam chair and thank you
for the bill you know I I and
concerned about the cost to the
utilities and certainly excels
in my area and they've done a
tremendous job make huge
investments in southeast New
Mexico and it concerns me that
maybe this is a good bill that's
going a little too quick and too
sent and maybe just a sense
could roll out a little bit
slower that of the capacity and
the ability to do the upgrades
necessary safely might be a
better way to go but I do worry
about as a consumer of excel
that those costed if they become
pretty significant as they have
to build out to meet the needs
that's going to come on me as a
consumer and so I I really do
appreciate you know we have a
lot of Southern southeast new
Mexican The New Mexico and that
we support everything that I do
worry that anything that might
affect our co ops which we have
also in Lee County as well as
excel that's done a great job of
providing the energy we need in
that area anything that's going
to create additional costs there
yes economy as consumer is
concerning so I appreciated and
and certainly
and happy that people are
wanting to use solar I think
that's that's going to be the
future and a lot of cases but
just a little too quick for me
thank you thanks Senator Kernan
Sierra.
thank you miss madam chair.
And Center for reviews for you
have a comment so the center of
a.
Maybe I heard it wrong but if we
pass this bill more people going
to get killed is that.
Is that true.
Madam chair and and senator I
think the comments were
nationwide and had to do with
people working on electrical
systems of which certainly
people working on solar systems
there's a lot of energy there
and if people are careful yes
people die from because energy
is dangerous in whatever form in
large concentrations there is
not been to to my knowledge of
that I've heard other than the
COVID today that because people
are building larger systems to
accommodate the increased
electricity that they're
anticipating using that is
because the huge upswing in the
number of people injured in the
solar installation industry.
Thank you for that answer thank
you.
This one quick comment.
I like to talk about the big
elephant the big elephant I
think today is that being talked
about is these companies just
don't want to increase
competition thank you.
And I'm sure that's all I have.
Thank you senator Clemente
passionate a.
Thank you madam chair of.
Just a question of on on these
facilities distributed the
regeneration they recorded
connection studies or this too
small to require interconnection
studies for generating
electricity.
Mr chair lord madam chair
Senators
I'm not sure exactly how to
answer that it is the
responsibility of the utility to
insure and we passed a law last
year I think was last year on
grid modernization that gave
them money and ability to
upgrade the systems in order to
handle the additional renewable
energies that are coming some of
the companies have done that
some of the companies have done
great modernization by just
switching out smart meters to
more smart meters instead of the
additional interconnections and
lines and stuff is there's a bit
additional DG they certainly are
still able to put that into
their rate cases it's already
been a pre approved to do so as
they move forward and so I don't
know if that answers your
question Senator.
But maybe one of the utilities
that are involved with this
maybe they could answer.
Simply.
Record somebody sure.
Assisting on.
Madam chairwoman and Senator
Senator we do as far as I
understand we do not do
interconnection studies for DG
connections what we do do is we
get a application for for the
systems and then once the
systems are in we go out and
inspect the systems make sure
that the inverters are all set
to to the right cycles in the
like and then
approve the system and then the
systems are then on and moving
the energy on to the
distribution lines from there
but I I think they're they're
small enough that that there is
not a need for a for a study.
No we were suppose you madam
something about the summer
renewable energy credits are not
worth or not
Chair and senator when I put in
my solar system approximately
twelve years ago I was getting
substantial payments back for
the extra energy that I produced
and it was sixty dollars a month
over the energy I was using over
the years those have been
decrease those were put in as
incentives to get the industry
moving and going they have
decreased substantially now and
so this was put in at that time
so that I didn't put in the
system four times what I needed
so that I can start the of my
retirement funded on the extra
energy I was producing it made
sense at that time to put in a
cap so that people did not
overbilled the system to and I
think the term used at the time
was we'll we lean in the extra
energy and making money off of
those systems those credits have
been cut back substantially
where it does not make any
financial sense to oversize a
system because the cost of
oversize in the system is never
made up on extra energy over
what you would be using this
arbitrary cap of twenty percent
above prevent somebody who is
anticipating switching
everything in their house over
to electric being able to right
size the system for that because
they're historical use would not
indicate that they could put in
a system that big.
Going forward.
R. thank you
before we go to help center had
any of.
Mr or madam chairwoman and so
Senator I heard from several
constituents of Los Alamos to
support the bill and so they
asked me to thank you for
bringing the bill forward
because they've run into some
issues and the senior bill they
wanted me to just send on my
thank you and I want to publicly
state that because they know
that they're listening in on the
thank you madam chair what
senator Wirth thank you madam
chair I guess my my questions
for Robert and Kate Carson
because I've actually super
impressed by kit cars and all
they've done and I I know there
was a constituents who had a big
house in Eldorado where I
represent but another house up
north who was trying to hook in
and ran into that problem where
trying to build a system out and
then because the record passes
the Carson wasn't letting her do
that but I guess my my question
is.
You've got that issue right now
right with a hundred twenty
maybe someone wants to build a
system that's a hundred twenty
can they do it or can you tell
on the can't do it.
Madam chair Mr chair Senator the
end of a.
Find a.
The madam chair Mr chair Senator
I think what they're doing is
they're they're having them put
into battery systems I think
they're over there at least
three encouraging them to but it
is it is it is a problem there
so
This that they support solar but
they've gotten to the point
where they don't have capacity.
So Mister chairman with we're
we're in a great space this is a
million eight I also I just work
on the contract just ended more
than twelve years and I was
getting eighty to a hundred
Bucks a month and now you know
we're doing some very
interesting things with
batteries and it's just
unbelievable what you can do now
and I mean I think but I also
hear what I hear what's being
said you know especially and I I
like to hold out kick forcing
because they should be commended
for building where they are any
and we certainly don't want to
raise a Jewish or someone's
trying to put three hundred
percent of what they're going to
use off with that but I I get
your argument though there's no
economic reason they would do
that it's going to have to
pencil out for for what they're
doing and I would just add one
more thing Mr chairman I think
we're all going to get ready for
you know the need for electric
truck goes the other way so
you're gonna be able hope that
into your house and it'll
powerhouse for four days this is
reading about the path that's
got such a big battery and so on
the world is changing here and
again I think to the extent that
you've got out.
An old percentage here I mean I
get the argument I think this
this obviously was gonna apply
across the state but I'm also I
I I hear exactly what what's
going on where you're completely
built out and how does the
system I work with that and and
someone's gonna have to show.
Sounds to me because it goes
based on what I think Rico said
if they show right now I'm gonna
use a hundred fifty percent
sounds like that particular
utilities willing to to work
with them.
But they should have to do that
though that's the challenge so
it's it's a very interesting.
Bill that you have brought to
and and again I appreciate you
bring it Senator Shendo in the
intention and simply because
you madam chair you know just
the this bill
you know I don't think we've all
looked at the Carson is one of
the more progresses in terms of.
To see them there posing as of
trying to figure out you know
but I understand I think approve
a Senator Wirth question and and
and also response to you know
the why that may be but at the
same time with the right size
you know to fit current needs so
I'm I'm hoping I know that we're
moving in that direction I know
that the even the on some of the
tribes in the COVID area as well
as the PNM are are looking to
develop these a.
Not this.
Home but community solar types
and so in the whole world
changing and so forth so I hope
that you guys can come to some
you know agreement or figure out
what what's best for twelve
years and.
Thank etcetera etcetera etcetera
etcetera rex.
Thank you madam chair and
Senator board I'm here at all
and.
Dagan eight I would I wish it
were.
We're just a little bit
different I mean I think maybe
you're close with these guys I
don't know maybe or not maybe
you you can't you can't come to
something with them but if you
can.
I would like to to see that
because I I don't think I'm
ready to go with it I mean I
think you've got to have it
anyway Senator but I'm I don't
think I'm ready to do that and I
hope that there can be some
conversation to bring it right
to we're works because I I don't
I don't know if there are to be
a cap I think you've got some
great arguments on the this side
of the of economic for for
somebody this put it on I don't
I don't know that you know I'm
ready to go by four truck
because I don't particularly
know the request for anything
but.
I just faxed me repair there but
the
thank you for bringing the bill
thank you for the conversation
thank you Madam thank you
senator just before I go to the
will of the committee that they
do want to make a comment
because my wife and I both have
were very fortunate to have a
solar system on our house
and I was clearly instructed on
where the fuses were on both the
inverter and in the in the in
the the fox you know we are
slowly moving on getting our
house in that zero we were able
to replace our gas furnace with
electric furnaces last summer
and our next project is going to
be our stove and we know that
our solar panels don't can't
handle the capacity of where
we're making those changes and
very fortunate to do so so I'm
excited about this opportunity
because we've got opportunities
on our roof to continue to add
more solar panels so I do
appreciate that at this point
what is the will of the
committee.
That some of the past few Center
were to have a second.
Second Sierra let me go ahead
take roll call the.
The group.
That in education this symbolic
no.
Senator Tallman yes Senator
Wirth yes Senator Hamblen yes in
addition yes.
Thank you all.
K. five to three year build now
congratulations Centers angles
now goes to the floor we are of
all ages make your
house then of this for from our
forty four dinner this.
