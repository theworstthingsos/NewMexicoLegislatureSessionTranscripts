Okay?
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Members
of the committee also with me
today is our it Director Mike
Baca and we have m v d director
Ted Gonzalez, if you have any
very detailed questions, but I
don't have much to add Just that
This really clears a path for us
to be able to offer this new
technology development and offer
it as another option. You know
nothing. Nothing mandated, but
an option for
Customers to be able to use
this. Um uh, you know the like,
like the sponsor, said the use
of this will be fairly limited
at the onset, and it is across
other states, but within time we
expect T s a to accept these We
accept, expect a lot of
applications to accept them, so
we'll stand for any questions.
Right, Okay.
Before we, uh go to the
committee for questions, so go
quickly for the audience.
Anybody here in? Uh, some
support of this bill?
Anybody in opposition.
Questions from the committee.
Or do pass.
You have a 2nd 2nd 2nd by
Senator Sanchez motion by her,
Hamlin.
Clerk can call wrote
Lopez? Yes.
That your worth?
Yes, Senator Hamlin? Yes.
Senator Sanders? Yes.
All right. You have a do pass.
7 to 0.
Thank you. Senate Bill 40.
Senator souls.
Whenever you're ready.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. This is
an identical text building that
was in the past out of this
committee last year. It was not
included in the final omnibus
tax package. Um, it's for
geothermal ground coupled heat
pumps. These are mostly for
residential small businesses
where they dig holes run lines
in them. Use that latent heat
within the thing to greatly
lower the cost of both.
Heating and cooling of buildings
or one of the main pieces on it.
That's important is that it's a
refundable tax credit. But other
than that, it's the same as what
passed last year and I'm open
for questions.
Thank you, Senator. So before we
go to the committee will go to
the audience. Anybody here is
support of Centerville.
40
Quickly.
You do need to come over here.
We have to hear.
Yep.
Should be
I think that's on your chairman,
committee members. I'm Ward
McCartney from Glenn. Um, I get
the Texas Energy and power
newsletter. I subscribed to it
because First article I read
about six months. The article
said that in cotton in response
to the Yuri Storm, and Texas
wanted to
Uh,
Construct six or eight gas fired
power plants to meet peak
demand. An, uh, just play that
so they wouldn't go through the
black rolling blackouts. Um,
that was going to cost the rate
pairs $8 billion more than $8
billion. It would raise
everybody's bill by 15 or $20 a
month. Just the base pay.
Um, they did a study.
And the gas furnace and a house
last 15 years. So instead of
spending $8 billion for a gas
peaker plants they can
incentivize people to go with
heat pumps in their homes,
replacing their gas furnaces
with heat pumps and thereby
lowering the electrical demand
on the system.
Um and that would cost incentive
ization would cost a half a
billion dollars, and that's why
This is so important that we
incentivize switching over to
energy efficient heat pumps
because they lower that peak
demand and they save our
ratepayers money and I'm trustee
on the Squirrel Co op board,
and, you know, saving our
members co op members. Money is
the name of the game. Thank you
Appreciate it.
Mr Chair Committee members. My
name is Rocky Bacchus.
Um my companies have installed
Close to 1000 geothermal heat
pumps in the state of New
Mexico.
After the
Heat pump credit expired.
Sales dropped almost totally.
Uh, it's a It's a very growing
but technology needs to expand
and improve a whole lot and
without a consistency and
incentives. It makes it very
difficult for
Pioneering folks to invest in
it, so I would encourage you to
reinstate this. It's had a gap
from, I think, 2000.
20 or something like that. So
it's been several years, but
I encourage you do pass. Thank
you.
Good afternoon, Mr Chairman,
members of the committee. My
name is Melissa Bernard in
I'm here representing the Sierra
Club Rio Grande chapter are
35,000 members and supporters
and strong support of SB 40,
which will help families,
businesses and government office
buildings bring on ground source
heat pumps that will reduce
energy bills and reduce air
pollution both in the atmosphere
and an indoor air quality.
We support this tax credit as a
way to increase access to this
innovative technology. Thank you
for your support.
Thank you. Alright Committee any
questions from committee
members?
Oh, you work moving to pass
Pass. Have a second Senator

Hmm. Ah, Senate Bill 58.
Or Jerry. There you are.
Yes.
Do we have?
They're in the books, okay?
Ready.
Questions from committee.
Senator Lopez. Mr. Chairman, I
have one question.
In reading some of the
descriptions as to where some of
the potential facilities are. Is
there anything up north for a
potential site? Um, Mr Chair?
Mr. Chair, Senator Lopez. So if
your question is, are there any
electricity generating
facilities from potential
potential, Um
I believe there's certainly
potential, um, the greatest
potential geothermal resource in
New Mexico. It runs all the way
from the north to the south. And
so, um yes, there are lots of
places in the north of
concentrated along the Rio
Grande rift.
Where
Geothermal electricity, Curious
Mr Chair because there's always
potential for, um
How should I say more business
development with this type of
business, especially looking at
some of the land grants up north
to see what they have available
for him? Just potential. Just
thinking. Thank you, Madam. Mr.
Chair. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. And so
my lines were thinking about
land grants to and how we could
generate funding for land grants
and how they could generate
their own source of income. So
my question was going to be
related to land grants. And do
you know how many direct
permanent operating jobs
A typical project could
generate.
Um Mr Chair as senator, her
Um, Mr Chair as senator. Hurry.
Me. Um um
Oh, I have. I guess this figure
that I've looked up so
A geothermal electric plant.
employees of a bit more people
than a combined cycle gas power
plant. Um I guess there's you
know additional geothermal
operations and pumping and all
that stuff to maintain.
The number I've seen is
somewhere on the order of, you
know, 30 to 35 employees in a
thank you, Mr Chairman, Senator,
this would be great on land
grants were always trying to
find a way to use the lamb to
generate ones. And that's final
question. Thank you.
Senator Senator Worth
So back to the hold Harmless a
little bit. So I'm reading in
the F I R that it's a small,
relatively small amount of
money.
But it
That basic. So the tax
department came and asked you to
If it seems like they've got
huge issues with trying to
temper system Is that really
where that's coming, Mr Chair
and we don't have
Anyone here from the Mississippi
palette ease of the counties
that have
Have weighed in. They may not
have seen the amendment yet. So
I just flagged that typically
when we do these gross receipts
tax exemptions.
You know, there's a hit to local
governments. And so that's I
think why you had it in there in
the first place, and it was in
last year's bill. Um, so I just
wanted to flag that is a change
that
Someone may have some issue with
down the road. But again, I do
get but again. I think this is a
Let me ask one more question.
Mr. I know that this well, I
guess is this the same bill that
went through the interim
committee, the Water National
Resources Committee and was
endorsed and and were there any
other changes from last year's
version?
To this year's version, or is it
basically
Great. Okay, well again. This is
we don't need to reinvent the
wheel. The geothermal. Just say
this. The geothermal.
Issue is is super important, and
I'm excited about this
direction. And so we just need
to get this one across.
Uh,
And I appreciate that Mr Chair
and
We're going to have a little
discussion on the corporate tax
coming up on Thursday, but also
LLCs there's a whole string of
business formations, which are
passed through entities and
you're right. They're paying
A personal income tax, depending
on what they're
Income is on that. So for sure.
That's all I have. Mr. Chair.
We don't have anybody else on
the list. E Mr. Chair, I moved

tax credit here. I want to thank
the sponsor again for carrying
it for us. Thank you.
Thank you.

and work. Thank you.
You. Thank you. So now with the
committee senator had a meal.
Mr Chair, Not a question. I just
wanted to thank the bill's
sponsor for bringing this
forward. I supported it last
year, and I had a number of
ranchers and farmers and rural
northern New Mexico. Remind me
the importance of this bill, and
I told them I would thank you on
their behalf. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
Kill him.
And it's worth. Thank you, Mr
Chair. I also supported this
bill. My my only question, And

The F I, R has gone from $4
Million to $38 million. You have
any explanation for
How our friends over the LFC.
Went from 4 million to 40
million.
So, Mr Chair. I'm just I'm just
flagging it because again, we're
trying to put together a tax
package within a
You know, there's a capacity
question, and so there maybe
some way depending on where we
are and what the numbers look
like that we might need to tweak
this a little bit, given that it
did.
Again. Go just surprising to me,
and we're gonna need to get an
answer for what? What That
analysis is.
Good. No, I think that's key
because we're gonna
So, Mr Chair I again I think
this is this is part of the work
that this committee did together
in a bipartisan fashion. I
really want to get
This end, But I'm just flagging
that because again, it does.
It's surprising to me, that's
all I have. Yeah, that's that is
a significant jump. So if we can

Join us.
Hmm.
All right. Thank you, Mr
Chairman, Mr Chairman Last year
we
We've moved some of the
remaining functions of the PRC
that were not necessarily
consistent with their mission.
We moved it over to D O T the
transportation issues there that
are not monopolies, essentially,
taxis, ambulances, that kind of
thing. Bunch of others.
And, uh, we found that there
needed to be a little bit of
cleanup. I've got two experts,
attorneys from the each of the
entities and I'll let them
introduce themselves and go
through it. But mostly, this is
technical stuff. It cleans up
some of the things so shouldn't
shouldn't be too much heartburn
for anybody. But would you guys
like to introduce yourselves and
a couple of words Steve
Hambleton I'm general counsel
for the Department of
Transportation.
This is mainly cleanup act, the
original
160 Senate Bill 160 from last
year was 159 pages long and
we've had a joint committee of
PRC personnel and D O T
personnel working on on this
transition, and one of the
things we found were some, uh,
cleanup matters essentially
technical matters that need to
be done with this. The one
Real substantive matter in. This
is the way you would would
appeal from a final decision of
the agency. PRC appeals go from
that agency directly to the
Supreme Court, mainly because so
many of the things that PRC
decides or matters of great
public interest, Um what's being
transferred to the Department of
Transportation?
Is are much smaller kinds of
issues. And so what? The big
substantive changes the appeal
from final decisions of the
Department of Transportation
will go to the District Court to
leave to go to the district
Court here in Santa Fe, or if
the hearing is heard, and some
other county would go to that,
and I'm
isn't it. Elizabeth Jeffreys and
I'm here from the public
Regulation Commission. I've been
working with the staff.
That, um
Administrate these this act.
I think we'll stand for
questions with that, Mr Chair.
Okay. Thank you. At this time,
we'll go to the audience.
Anybody here in support of
Senate Bill 201.
Was there something
The team obviously has been
working hard on this trend.
Transition. Um thank you for
helping audience. Can you please
introduce yourself as secretary
of the Department of
Transportation? Thank you. This
transition has been going well.
We look forward to taking over
these responsibilities. I think
it's gonna work. Um, for us, but
these cleanup materials will
just make the transport. Thank
you.
Everybody here in opposition.
So you done questions from the
committee?
Senator working just really
quick. I appreciate that again.
This is a continuation and the
key thing real issue is the
appeal. And this is head of the
Senate judiciary. So we're we're
gonna work on it when we get to
that committee.
Great, alright.
Okay?
With that. What is a pleasure of
the committee?
Could you pass past were Senator
Hamlin, 2nd 2nd by senator
hearty meal.
And Tolman Senator brand.
Senator Gregg's.
Senator had a meal.
Senator Lopez Tommen.
Senator Senator Worth Yes.
Senator Hamblin.
Senator Sando. Yes, we have
seven gasses for a do pass.
Thank you, Mr Chairman to
Branton. Greg's were with me and
the governor's office just now,
So that's probably haven't had
time to get down here. So
they're not stiffing your
transit. We we are. We are aware
of that. Thank you, Senator. So
Centerville 99 Senator do Hick.
Hmm.
Mr. Chair. Evening. I am here on
Senate Bill 99, which deals with
the excise tax on cannabis.
When we passed the Cannabis
Regulation Act, we created a
step up in excise tax from 12%,
which it is now to over the next
five years. It would go up 1%
each year, um, ending finally at
18%.
When you combine that with G R
T, which is also tacked on,
we're going to end up somewhere
over 27% about at the tax rate
for for cannabis while I am all
for bringing in as much revenue
as we possibly can from
cannabis, about one third of the
retail market for cannabis right
now is illicit.
And so it puts the legal folks
who are following all the rules
at a real competitive
disadvantage when we are
continuing to ratchet up the
price, uh, for them in a way
that does not impact, uh, folks
operating these illicit outfits,
So this is an effort to this
bill would take out that stuff
up that would keep the excise
tax at 12%.
And it's an effort to
Try to tamp down on the illicit
market has part of a kind of a
group of bills.
That are going for the session.
That's it. Thank you first go
out to the audience. Anybody
here in support of Santa Bill
99.
Anybody in opposition.
The nun committee. Any questions
of Senate Bill 99.
Mr Chair. I just question did
this the agency bring this or
where is this coming from?
So, Yeah, Mr. Chair, Senator,
This is something that that the
agency wanted. We didn't put it
in our kind of omnibus Cannabis
bill, Because at that point, I
didn't remember that when we
make new
Felonies. We automatically go to
finance so I was trying to keep
stuff out that we get the
overall bill.
Three and answer that Senator
menu also appreciates
sitting right there.
Yeah, okay.
Senator Tollman assistant. Thank
you, Mr Chair as wearing
Why is there a threefold
increase 28.
Mr Chair, Senator. Um, I think
you would have to ask
representative Lundstrom that
question that This was a
provision that was put in on the
floor of the house. I believe,
originally two years ago.
So you have to ask who
Representative Lundstrom was the
one who put that in and and and
I assume it was to maximize tax
revenue from cannabis, which
isn't necessarily a bad idea.
It's just that it also pushes
people to the illicit market.
When when you were increase
those costs. Thank you.
The answer. That's all I have.
Mr. Chair. You want to make the
motion for you?
Senator Greece.
Thank you, Mr Sharon. And and
thank you, Senator. I'm sorry. I
missed some of that. But could
you the the 12 12%? I believe it
is. That's the number today and
we want to stay at that that
number we We don't believe you
know, an increase to you know,
it's something that ought to be,
and that ought to be worry. Stop
so
Could you kind of lying that out
for me just so I feel better.
Sure so keeping it at 12% and
then adding that to whatever G R
T is going to to apply,
depending on where you are in
the state.
Would keep us right around 21%
of the overall tax rate that
would apply to cannabis and that
is that's pretty standard. For
what a lot of other states are
doing. They tend to range
Cannabis is taxed in different
ways in different states, but of
the states that tax it in the
same way we do, Uh, amounts tend
to range from about 17%. If you
start getting
Into the 25 and over range. You
see a whole lot more people
buying from the illicit market
because they can get comparable
products for a cheaper price.
Um, and so we want to do
everything we can to not
encourage that illicit market
and so that that's the aim
behind this bill.
In this chair and and and share.
Thank you for that. I mean that
that explains that a little bit
to me. You know, we're gonna
have some bills here. Uh, we're
going to see that are going to
go the opposite way on on
alcohol, trying to just, you
know, keep you from from usually
it and this one is trying to,
you know, keep the
The legal market for cannabis
and at a reasonable rate and I,
it's just it's all interesting
When you look at everything, and
I'm I'm not willing to make
them, you know.
But I have one recommendation
that will make for those of you
hear that A real supporters of
cannabis.
Years of numerous states.
That have legalized cannabis,
And it makes sense to me that if
we all have, we all ought to be
able to trade with one another.
And I think that would take you
know federal action, but I think
those of you who support that
Should be should be looking into
that to see if you know of New
Mexico. Cannabis is the top
cannabis anywhere.
It would be a great to market it
in states that
You could really do some good
with it so
Thank you, man. Mr. Chair, Mr.
Chair, Senator from your lips to
President Biden's ears. Thank
you, all right.
Thank you. I don't have anybody
else in the list of the

When we want to send a Bill 68
senator menus.
What's that?
Oh,
Good afternoon, Mr Chairman,
Senate Bill 68 as you just
heard, Let's just start right
there.
Let's just start with light.
There was marijuana. How would
you like to have your 12 year
old targeted?
By the marijuana industry
online.
Well.
As a 12 year old. How would you
like to have your six year old
targeted by the marijuana
industry?
In advertising.
Mexico Kids code is crucial to
safeguarding Children and our
privacy and online and so and
supporting the digital world
digital experience in the world.
One that supports exploring what
they wanted to do.
But not when kids are in crisis.
We know they're addicted to
screens.
Let me see depression and
anxiety, Right? See?
There's even a camp in towels.
For dick Screen addiction for
kids.
But the solution isn't easy.
It's taking away forbidden
social media because kids need
to socialize.
Research shows that kids
participate in modern life when
they socialize and socialize on
their phones.
And whether we like it or not,
Today's world is all in line.
Have 20,000 instagram posts.
Over a five day period.
And, uh, as as we watch this,
I'm here to tell you that those
approaches don't work. We need
to keep
Mm hmm. Because we need to keep
pairing with control and pennant
parental consent and the harmful
addictions that demand our kids.
Addiction is still there simply
hard to identify the privacy
innovation evasive and frankly,
people lie.
Colleagues come. We come for the
solution for making online
spaces. Kids were
Bases where kids spend less time
on predatory and more privacy by
design.
I don't know if you know this,
but I can tell you
Not by your name and not by your
digital Your phone number by
your digital. I d. I can track
you.
I can track you by where you
leave this building and where
you headed next.
I can track you if you go from
leave Walmart.
I can track you inside WalMart
If you make a left hand turn and
spend 15 minutes in the TV
section.
We can track you.
You can track you as you make
patterns in the store and we can
track you and create habits and
where you go.
You can track you as many times
as you go to McDonald's and the
amount of time you spent in line
in McDonald's.
You can track you with your
purchases.
We can track you with
everything.
But it comes to Children.
In predatory practices. That's
where we draw the line.
This bill wasn't letting
committee last year with
overwhelming varsity bipartisan
support.
And then she would and experts
who are with me today will do a
better job explaining this.
The law and the technology. But
before I turn over there, and I
can tell you one thing,
attorneys in generals in 33
states, including the Mexico
have sued Meta for deliberately
designing its products to appeal
the kids that's detrimental to
their mental health.
That choice and industry group
representing groups like Meta,
Amazon and technology are many
other others that have filed no
less than 66 lawsuits
challenging this regulation and
other states.
Big corporate playbooks are very
simple.
They want to track your
Children.
They want to send them predatory
information.
They want to know what your kids
are up to.
And it's detrimental to
themselves.
That have an expert witness.
Good afternoon chair and
committee members. I'm Nicole
Roja here on behalf of five,
writes us a project in
cooperation with Reset Tech and
the five Rights Foundation. We
are focusing on educating US
stakeholders about international
best practices for age
appropriate design.
Research shows that the mental
health crisis affecting our
youth has been deeply
exacerbated by the presence of
data driven advertising to
Children and the use of
psychologically manipulative
design features intended to
prolong the time spent online to
which Children and teens are
particularly vulnerable.
But there is a proven vetted
regulatory framework to address
these issues. The New Mexico
kids Code model design code at
its core SB 68 is very simple.
It requires businesses only
gather the personal data of
Children that is required to
provide the service that they
have requested.
And then to not sell it or use
it in any other way. This means
no tracking, no profiling or no
manipulating of kids through the
use of their data. Secondly, it
requires online platforms to
take an honest look at their
products and practices and
assess whether their data
practices behind that product
present a risk of material harm
to Children. Those risks need to
then be mitigated before the
product is offered to the
public.
This is the approach we're
seeing. All we see with all
physical products in the world,
right? We see it with cars. We
see it with cribs. We see it
with power tools, and there's no
reason we should not see it with
products that are used on the
despite that choice, which the
senator mentioned a trade
association representing the
biggest of big tech Amazon,
Google, Meta tiktok, many others
suing to enjoying the kids code
in the states. Numerous other
states are considering this
measure at the same time,
including Maryland, Minnesota,
Vermont in Illinois and
It's already law in the UK and
Ireland showing that businesses
can comply.
SB 68 is not require any form of
content, moderation, and it does
not infringe on the rights of
parents to raise their Children
At the same time, it doesn't
place the onus on parents to
monitor their kids for every
online interaction importantly,
it does not limit the
information opportunities or
resources available to youth on
the Internet. You can still
access any content any
information they want. They just
can't have it pushed to them.
From algorithms trying to
sustain their time.
Uh, this committee unanimously
approved this bill last year,
and it has changed since it's
been here last year. We've made
it stronger against legal.
Attacks. Some of the changes are
we have provided definitions for
best interests of Children. We
stricken any reference to
content to the bill to clarify
that the bill is strictly about
data management. The one time
you will see the word content in
the bill is to clarify and
explain and make sure that kids
can always search for whatever
content they want.
Um
And we have also included
language to ensure that the bill
does not interfere with existing
rights and privileges of
Children. We say that there is
no requirement for ages
assurance and even if a company
does decide to estimate users
age, they must do so in the most
privacy, protective manner
possible, ensure this is a
reasonable vetted bill that
walks the line between online
privacy and safety in a manner
that will actually benefit kids
and keep the Internet available
to all.
I'm happy to answer any
questions about the bill and
respectfully ask for your
support of SB 68.
And you may not know this.
Army Amazon.
Who sells products.
And suicide supplies and
They know only the consumer
history and they target them in
that, But as suicide rates go up
in Children, and if that is a
target of something that they
look at
They're add feeds on greatly
increases. The algorithm says
that they're surfing the
Internet.
So
Be aware of what she shop on
Amazon Senator Shindo
No shop.
No problem. Alrighty. So, uh,
we'll go out to the audience.
Anybody here in support of
Senate bills 68.
You guys can, uh
Think about a minute to make
your remarks right?
Thank you, Mr Chairman and
Committee excited to be here
again presenting this bill. My
name is Greta Mcenany and I am a
CEO of a tech company that
focuses on youth. Mental
wellness. Um, I'm here today
because you spent all health and
online safety has been at the
core of my personal mission and
my professional career products,
technology products and media
products that I've built have
Impacted 10 million young
people. I've been in this space
in a while. I understand the
challenges that we face in
getting this bill across, but I
think it is incredibly
important, um, that we have some
kind of regulation in place. I
won't spend too much time as I
think the senator conveyed. You
know how young people have a
digital and physical life, and
they're just growing up in a
world that's so different from
ours.
Um, but just as we create safety
measures for their physical
world, we have to create safety
measures for their digital
world. That's where they're
developing a large portion of
their identity and that identity
turns into mental health. And
then that turns into, you know,
um there's there's a lot of
impact. Sorry, there's a lot of
impact.
Financially and otherwise, when
we look at the mental health of
our young people, so our youth
deserved to be safe and healthy,
and this bill is a down payment
on our future for generations to
come. Thank you.
Sure chairmanship.
Chairman Shindo and Committee
I'm Larry Chandler. I'm a
pediatrician here in Santa Fe
and I'm representing the New
Mexico Pediatric Society. The
state chapter of the American
Academy.
Pediatrics. We support this
bill.
Um, I won't be long. I did have
a bad piece in the new Mexican a
couple of weeks ago that outline
the importance of this bill.
But the Internet holds
tremendous potential to benefit
Children and their families.
Children routinely use apps
websites and other online
services to attend and
participate in school complete
their homework Research Learn
about the world explore their
emerging identities, communicate
with friends and loved ones.
Learn about and engage with the
political process developed
professional skills.
For their eventual careers and
to be entertained.
Children should be able to
engage in these valuable online
activities without being harmed
by the very providers of the
service they use, unfortunately,
should wrap up your statements
were trying to keep okay.
Alright. This bill aligns with
the American Academy of
Pediatrics. National Priorities
are requiring digital platforms
to prioritize the well being of
Children and adolescents. Thank
you for supporting this And not
only do I represent the
pediatricians, but as my button
says, the kids sent me
Thank you. Thank you.
Because we will have testimony
on both sides. I am good. Okay.
Gotcha. Thank you. So my name is
Aaron Army. Who? I'm an educator
and mother here in New Mexico.
And I urge you to consider the
severity of where we are today.
I would be surprised if if any
of you understood the depth of
what crisis is My daughter is a
survivor of and all overdose.
And we've been in a struggle for
years and years and years after,
uh, going through lots with
social media. Um I would say
that there are so many issues
from drugs being pushed menus
readily available to kids,
Fentanyl overdoses have gone up
3000% different content,
suicides, mental health, They've
heard all of them.
Um, I really am upset and
frustrated when I hear parents
should be more involved. I hear
Take away the phone, then it'll
be solved and there are so many
devices even TVs. Now, um,
connect to Internet and so
there's not a simple solution of
just take it away or don't allow
it.
Um
Hi. My name is John. Helen and I
experienced this. I just believe
it really does affect them.
Thank you.
Anybody in opposition.
To the bill.
You guys can
Introduce yourselves and
I had my timer here so
Mr Chairman and members of the
committee, and Marshall
Martinez, executive director of
Equality. New Mexico Equality,
New Mexico Believe very strongly
that young people, especially
LGBT Q. Young people need safer
standards to protect them on the
Internet, but with due respect
to the sponsors and advocates
supporting this bill, we do not
believe this is the way to do
this. We are worrisome about
words like conduct, which are
loosely defined.
Could be used to chill content
or make companies afraid of what
is considered conduct as it
relates to young people
Something we've seen weaponized
in many other states. We fear
that loose definitions such as
best interests of the child
would open up, especially LGBTQ
content and or conduct from
being accessible to young, queer
and trans people who are in
desperate need. These are
particularly dangerous times for
queer and trans youth across the
country.
And we cannot further the harms
perpetuated against them in the
name of protecting them, as has
been done in other states in
such well intended but similar
ways.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Members of
the committee. My name is Naomi
Valdez. I'm the director of
public policy here at the A. C l
U of New Mexico. I want to thank
Senator Munoz and representative
Pamela Herndon for continuing to
raise this issue. Um, data,
privacy and mass surveillance
are two issues that the A C l U
is deeply concerned about. We
are also also very interested in
getting it. Some of the
predatory practices that were
mentioned.
Um, they can protect our youth.
That being said, um, we cannot
support this bill and its
current form. Where concerned
that by design, this bill gives
a lot of discretion to the A G
to determine what is and is not
harmful content as well as some
of the broad language that was
mentioned previously and the
incentives that that might
create for platforms to restrict
access to content that is
constitutionally protected.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair and members
of the committee. My name is
Heather Smith from both futures.
While we appreciate the
conversations about our concerns
with the bill
Even with the updates to the
language we would like to mix of
New Mexico senator approach that
trust our leaders to be engaged
in the solutions proposed to
protect us. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Members of
the committee, Jason weeks
registered lobbyists for the New
Mexico Hospitality Association
and the Albuquerque Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce. We stand in
opposition to this bill. Both
entities stand in opposition to
this bill today for a lot of the
reasons that were stated the
Internet is a very powerful
tool, and it's improved our life
and lives and measurable ways.
Um, that powerful tool, though,
has also created a lot of
complex issues for us in terms
of access to the Internet and
both services.
Content and products. Um well,
both organizations very much
appreciate and understand that
we need to limit content that
that is harmful to Children. We
do feel that this bill goes too
far. We do feel that some of the
definitions in the bill are
problematic. Child is defined as
anybody under 18 and what's age
appropriate. There's no guidance
as it relates to what's age
appropriate for a 12 year old
versus a 14 year old versus 17
Year old that could change.
Um And so, for those reasons, we
just think that the bill needs
to be tightened up. We look
forward to continuing discussion
But standing opposition today.
Thank you.
That will be the committee.
Senator Hamlin. Thank you, Mr
Chair. And my apologies. I do
have to leave. So I, um I'm one
honored to be able to to speak,
sponsored this bill because I
think all of us are in the same
boat. We want our kids to be
protected when I scroll
When I do my nightly scroll of
Tiktok. Sometimes there are
things that pop up that I'm
like, How did this get on my for
you page?
Completely understand it and
supported this last year. The
thing that has been brought to
my attention, especially by the
advocates, is how it impacts
LGBTQ people, senator manuals
talked about suicide rates. The
LGBTQ community considers
suicide every 45 seconds.
And if there are not resources
there for them to be able to
search to find help. If this
keeps that from happening, that
is concerning for me, I think
there are conversations that
have been started and that can
continue to have. I think there
are valid concerns, But I also
think that this bill has a lot
of potential to move forward, so
I would encourage conversations
to continue if it moves out of
this committee or if it comes
back to this committee.
Because I think we all have the
same intentions. We want to make
sure that it gets right because
when we're talking about the
Internet, there's so many
different things in components
that come to this.
And we all want this to work to
protect our Children. But there
are always inherent.
Under layer things that we're
not thinking about because I
didn't know about this in terms
of how it impacts the LGBTQ
community until having Kevin
conversations with the advocates
and as I finish up, I just want
to thank you for speaking to the
committee today because I know
it's terrifying and I want to
thank you for doing that,
because it's a big deal. The
fact that you got up there you
should be very proud of what you
did.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you. Thank Senator.
Senator Hearty meal. Thank you,
Mr Chairman, So mine is in the
same realm. So being the only
gay senator in New Mexico. I
don't only represents Senate
District Five represent a
community who reaches out to me
to be their voice. And that
community is the LGBTQ plus
community. And so they reminded
me so many youth turned towards
the Internet for resources.
Something that Senator Hamlet
and I didn't have. As we grew
up. We had to stay closeted
until we were old enough. And
now we're seeing kids who can be
their true authentic self. But
sometimes they still don't have
that parental support at home,
so they go to the Internet for
these resources, and it can be
an isolating time for LGBT Q.
Plus youth, and so I just want
to make sure that this bill is
the strongest possible that it
will protect the LGBTQ plus
community before I also agree to
send it on.
I support the sponsor with this
bill, and I understand the
intent of it, but I need to also
speak up on behalf of a
community that I represent,
which isn't only District five.
But the L G B T Q plus community
and also want to thank you
because it's not easy to send up
and speaking as a former
teacher, I'm proud of you. Thank
you, Mr Chairman.
Thank you, Senator.
Nearly questions from the
committee.
Senator Brent
I'm sorry.
Okay? Yeah, Senator Brent will
tell them.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. I'd be
glad to yield Senator Tollman.
That would be fine. But I'll go
ahead and ask a couple of
questions. I know. One of the
big concerns on this is social
media platforms and
But it doesn't just apply to
social media platforms, right. I
mean, this applies to Google.
And so how do we make sure that
people's rights are protected
When when they come to the
freedom to look things up
online? I looked things up all
the time on Google. You know,
I'm on the phone or my tablet
constantly on the floor, looking
things up or occasionally
playing games.
But, you know
How do we make sure that that I
don't have to give my personal
information to
Uh, to prove that I am at least
18 years old.
Happy to take that question. Um
so
Yes, this would apply to Google
and I do want to point out that
Google and services like that
are one of the main online
platforms that
Track and monitor all over
online behavior, so it should
apply to Google and there's no
reason since it's not a content
bill, it would not prohibit
anyone from searching for
content. There's no reason no
person can just not go on to
Google and search for whatever
they want with the bill would
prohibit is if Google actually
knows that someone is a child,
and Google does because they
track our every movement.
Google wouldn't be able to use
the personal information of that
kid to try and maximize the time
they spend online. Google owns
YouTube like to point that out
in some states, where folks have
been trying to figure out how to
protect kids online, Um they've
gotten crafty and carved YouTube
and Google out of these these
bills because Google also owns
Google.
Classrooms, which is not
protected under our federal
student privacy laws, So I mean,
it does apply to Google and all
these other things, but it would
not prohibit or keep that
platform from working. It just
means they have to have
responsible and ethical data
management practices when it
comes to collecting and using
the information of kids.
Because they have thousands upon
thousands of data points on all
of us.
Thank you, Mr Chairman, and I
appreciate
That and I'm using Google as an
example obviously used platform
but you know, you've got being
you've got, um I mean, it
applies to all of them. It makes
it I don't know I I have
concerns about there's two
lawsuits in California. I just
think that the the the smart
thing for us to do at this point
gets to wait and see.
Um, before we really I do think
it's Perrin. Parents response
and I know it's grandparents
that
You know?
My grandson's six years old and
he can get get around things.
A lot of you. We think we're
going to block with this.
They're smarter than um, And so
I just have a lot of concern,
but I also understand the risk
to
I I always am Good.
Thank you, Senator and Senator
Tollman.
Uh,
This may be a dumb question.
We're gonna ask it anyway.
So how do they
So if we passed this law, how
does the Internet discriminate?
From one state to another.
They know where you are. But how
do they how they black?
Certain messages.
How do they discriminate from
one
State to another happy to answer
that so
We know from research that
because of the way online
platforms work, and this is,
this is really apparent in
research from Europe, where the
countries are so small, right?
They're smaller than a lot of
our states right And we can see
that different countries have
different regulations and one
online company one platform can
can accommodate all of the
different laws of each of those
different.
Um countries, so it's one
country is more protective.
They'll do that there and then
you go a few miles, and there's
something else happening to
comply with the
Um
Regulations of that country so
they can do it. But I feel the
need to emphasize again. This
isn't about
Content like anyone can always
get to content It is about
Saying You can't these companies
can't collect more personal
information and then sell that
to data brokers sell it to other
online platforms sell it.
Um, and manipulated that way in
order to exploit young Children.
it's not about preventing them
from seeing anything online.
Okay. Thank you for that.
Answer,
Mr Chair.
Senator Tollman.
I don't have any money also on
the list.
Questions. Uh, what is the
pleasure?
Emotion for do pass by Senator
Coleman.
Second
Mr Chairman. How about a
substitute motion? I move to
table.
Substitute motion table.
It's not available so called the
road
Senator Brand senator had a
meal.
Lopez? Yes.
Senator word
Yesterday. Yes.
I mean for a
Thank you.
That concludes, uh, this
committee. So thank you.
