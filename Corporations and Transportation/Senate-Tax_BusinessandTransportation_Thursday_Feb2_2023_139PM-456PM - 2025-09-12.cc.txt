Already so we have the
amendments to of a with the
motion to amend the bill with.
Sanchez.
Pardon you want to move your
amendment I'm Mr chair a move
the.
The amendments as of recently
described.
We have a second by second chair
a second any opposition with the
amended bill is presented by the
sponsor.
Some discussion and in those
gushing.
Discussion purposes.
But.
I was wondering because what
you're trying to get set up
because so thank you Mr chairman
and and I have a.
Just a slight question.
On the
Going from forty to thirty
miles.
is a.
That was a big for golf carts.
Well I appreciate your humor but
no I'm not I'm not being funny
I'm actually ask users question
here does that make it no
actually work for golf carts.
Mr chair.
The as far as.
As far as I know it no.
Are you sure.
I'm ninety percent sure.
Okay.
Because I mean.
I.
Yes if you want like lonely or
yes love take yet but it goes
more than forty miles right.
Yes who was thirty minus is a
the two fifty color brand.
Of current popular brand that we
didn't want to exclude because
we would I think it's a certain
Toyota Toyota model.
Yes the deal team have a answer
on that maybe that expert
witness who zoom zoom and
there's just a couple of DOT
guys back here that might have
or maybe your expert knows.
Mr chair of the committee
actually it's more of a motor
vehicle question and so I can I
can background yes Sir and it
seems off highway vehicles of
the golf course classified
differently than a passenger
vehicle as sort of the same
question that comes off of
highway because they're not
allowed on the highways and
interstates another vehicle
which is classified as a pop
highly people would not be
subject to this bill is not
passed I had the past.
Thank you for.
Your.
To to thank your expert would
like to chime in.
Yeah sorry I was I'm now off
mute okay good and you get your
hair and.
Please introduce yourself.
Yeah the records from more
senior attorney with the natural
resources defense council or
NRDC and thank you for taking
the time to consider as twenty
two create a bill for state of
New Mexico
of one friendly amendment to the
Senators description of the
amendment with respect to the
minimum range again hybrid
electric vehicles I that is
designed not actually to
include that way on a raft for
S. U. V. but to crack the fact
that as with the forty mile
minimum range and this is for
plug in hybrid electric vehicles
that drive.
Primarily on electricity points
to exceed a certain minimum
range can go over to gasoline
keep going to drive the
grandma's in Colorado or
whatever.
if you keep it at forty then
only the Toyota Rav four the
lower to thirty many other
vehicles including one named
after Santa Fe would qualify two
hundred Senate increase access
the nice and final act hybrid
SUV so it's not for golf cart
this is for point and hybrid
electric vehicles driving like
to see us serve your daily
driving the on electricity
switch us when you need to make
a long awesome thank you so much
that that really helps answer
the question for me
actually probably would prefer
hybrid personally than than a
full elector myself so that I I
actually didn't know this would
apply to hybrids so that's
something good to know thank you
Mr chairman thank you circle in
person smile to questions on
your thank you isn't right no
Senator Griggs.
Thanks for sharing and centered
and you're actually listen
Clubcard.
Golf courses.
has.
for installation in their golf
cart.
The other one battery in the car
instead of share.
And.
The range of batteries I think
it's something that you should
check.
Because I'm I'm looking at the
you know the definition of
electric vehicle in here and
why.
A golf cart so long as it goes
thirty miles.
We meet the definition of
electric vehicles.
And.
I don't think that you're into.
I think that's what it looks
like if that battery will get
that much more I fishing golf
cart fifteen more.
On H. chopper but I know these
new batteries go for.
I don't know how far are you.
But I I think you would be
important for you to check that
to see.
The cage when you show this to
your range of at least thirty
miles.
I don't bring it into this
year's forty miles in very far
and thirty miles is what.
And.
I would think we should be going
the other way.
You know with the
regionalization hundred more or
something like that a request of
a listen to the you know the
discussion I I do believe shares
with the new lithium battery for
golf pro.
May need to be sure that they
don't fall under your
definition.
Thank you madam Mr chair.
You.
I think it's because that
question okay go ahead.
Yes I think the answer provided
by the state DOT representative
in the room by here again and
that this is only for on road I
wave your calls for medics flew
all cards or anything as such
and there is no on or a.
Our electric vehicle battery
electric vehicle available
purchase as a minimum range
anything close they're all much
much much higher than generally
Four three hundred mile range.
So this again is more specific
to plug in hybrid electric
vehicles that have both battery
and a gasoline hybrid motor.
That can enable the average Joe
to do almost all of their daily
driving on electricity cleaner
cheaper and then switch over to
Fastlane Education all longer.
Well as Mr chair is is the.
Representative in the DOT said.
Encouraging the golf carts would
be registered.
So that being register they
would be.
Do with it that in order to re
register is a have to pay the
fees with it so that I think it
registered that that can be
think of a problem because they
don't have to register.
This only applies to vehicles
that are registered with the
motor vehicle division.
There should.
The chairmanship Department I
just your you got a definition
in your.
That I know that D. O. T. and
you know cars have have you know
know strange definition of what
it is.
Have that maybe somewhere else
with all.
But right here in addition.
For electric vehicle you
basically definition was.
I don't know Mr chair and
senator you wanted to amend the
it.
Then the definition.
I remember that I don't know how
to do that just for the the just
didn't know it didn't change the
definition just talked about.
I make
Irvin and senator groups I'm
seventy Schardin Clarke in the
cabinet secretaries the tax and
Representative department I
think you want to look on page
five line eighteen and nineteen
were stipulates that part of
being an electric vehicle is
that it's manufactured primarily
for use on public streets
roadways are high.
So that those with what Mr
Valdez from DOT is the exact
language in the definition.
And and Mr.
Not going to happen in New
Mexico I if you are.
You're familiar with members
community support of.
Before the vehicle of choice and
a lot of those division golf
cart.
R. J. it's just.
This is the clarity of it all
and I understand if you've got
at their center of approach to
say and you do.
Transaction.
Very much so we might feel for.
Who is that.
Visit definition on page five
of.
Does that answer your concern
But then I.
If I might also.
Point out another.
Fireman on page five and is that
the vehicle as rated at no less
than two thousand two hundred
pounds unloaded faceplate.
And also that and I'm advocating
and taxpayers to apply for a
certificate of eligibility from
the department.
Would allow them the opportunity
to screen out anybody who
attempted to provide vehicle
that was not an office on route.
We should.
Okay all right your phone for
the office of public streets
also your golf cart doesn't
weigh two thousand pounds of
the.
Related.
Center I'm not gonna the labor
department sorry we can move on
to that already okay thank you
thank you Senator Griggs a
reason the York offer only goes
fifteen miles is because you
play executive courses those of
plates MPGe of courses our
schools thirty four.
Chairman members.
Usually confuse act court or
for.
In school fifteen miles.
All right we digress okay of we
do have a motion for the
amendment to the bill we do have
a motion and a second.
Any opposition to the amendment.
I see none.
You have an amended bill now
we're back on the bill and then
we'll go to the audience
To see who is in opposition to
this bill.
You want me explain a little
little bit more.
Okay briefly thank you Mr
chairman and members of the
committee we this bill creates
so three in sections of the
first one is to provide for a.
The.
The tax credit for those of.
The two vehicles are priced the
retail price of less than fifty
five thousand dollars
As I said before the credit is
twenty five hundred dollars
except for the the those are the
individuals who of.
I have a
Income of an annual health so
the just income less than.
For it to two hundred percent of
the federal properties property
poverty level guidelines as
published by the US department
of health and Human Services.
So in the second section Mr
chair.
Prides provides for three
hundred dollar tax credit for
the purchase and installation of
a charging unit.
There's a total of of.
The million dollars in credits.
For the the elector charity in
each of the next five years
ending in fiscal year twenty
seven and also
There's also a ten million
dollar a.
Limit for each of the next five
fiscal years.
For the
Tax credit for the purchase of
but like to do so the ten
million dollar
packet of money for the tax
credit for the purchase and a
million dollars for each of the
next five years.
Cap for for the installation of
purchase of a of a
T. V. Alecta charging.
Which I I bought my I bought one
for including installation and
equipment for two hundred
seventy five dollars although I.
I did hear somebody who spent
upwards of seven hundred dollars
in Santa Fe but then again you
know eggs are cheaper market
cheaper in the country and the
more expensive in Santa Fe so.
and the third section it's new
to this bill Mr chair.
is a eighty dollar additional
registration fee for.
Of total.
For a battery powered like fifty
eight thousand forty dollars
annual registration fee for the
plug in hybrid.
since
These vehicles obviously don't
to.
Pay a fuel tax both state and
Federal which.
Bind is thirty five cents a
gallon eighteen cents for the
Feds seventeen cents for the
For the state.
And finally a Mr chair Senator
Steinborn seven point seventy
seven percent of the
Fees that we will collect we'll
go into the state road fund and
twenty three percent of the fees
that we collect from.
We'll go into the transportation
project fund.
So that Mr chair briefly
explains it gives you an
oversight of the bill and
Because we stand for questions
of before we go to committee for
questions so we'll go out to the
audience those that are in
opposition to this bill.
Those are in favor of this bill.
Mr chairman of the committee
chair about the executive
director of special projects the
part should we stand in support
of this bill we believe that it
Alliance greatly with our own
initiatives of electrified the
state and promoting adoption of
electric vehicles more poorly
from DOT perspective the the the
biggest concern for us is the
option of electric vehicles and
its effects on the road fund in
the highway maintenance of our
state and the impact of adoption
on those funds so the eighty
dollars for electric vehicles in
the forty dollars a plug in
hybrid seventy seven percent
going to the road funded twenty
three percent going to the
transportation project but does
a long way to help supporting
our roads in New Mexico as the
adoption of the vehicles
increases thank you thank you.
Mr chairman members of the
committee meetings committees
and I'm with the New Mexico
automobiles Association we want
to thank the sponsor for
bringing up this bill the bill
is going to help the support
adoption of electric vehicles
yes balance at the providing
additional red revenue to the
duty to provide our building
maintenance of our roads and
bridges thank you Sir you.
good afternoon Mister chair
members of the committee this
gonna was disruptive Revenue
chapter we stand strong support
of as we twenty two we think the
sponsor for his excellent
amendments and we think the
committee for hopefully making
this the year that for even tax
credit the eighty dollars fee is
closer to the consumer reports a
fair fee for TV's most states
have hired gas taxes The New
Mexico which is why their TV row
these are higher the reduction
in range for plug in hybrids
makes the benefit applicables to
more cars but most importantly
the double credit for low income
New Mexicans using the same
definitions as a sustainable
building tax credit is another
step toward making easy
successful for all drivers these
cars these cars in charging
stations with the settlement
money and federal funds for
charging stations three so we
just ask that you will support
this bill thank you thank you.
Thank you Mr chairman and
committee I'm telling my part
I'm actually here we have
Charlie markets is a registered
lobbyist for the alliance Ohio
native I went innovation and
they stand support of SB twenty
two they believe that this tax
credit will allow more people
have access to it and I think
vehicles there is still some
concern fifty five thousand
dollar limit because the cost of
these vehicles can go much
higher but they're also in
support of the organizations as
well thank you Mr trump you.
The.
Thank you Mr chairman good
afternoon and members of the
committee my name is Jim data
and the secretary of director of
the renewable energy industry
association of New Mexico
as an electric vehicle owner I
can tell you that we're in the
early days of a transition to
electric vehicles they are they
are less expensive to maintain
they have much lower energy
costs
Smoove quiet and you could fill
up the whole and they have no
emissions which is obviously
very important there's about
three million electric vehicles
on the road in the United States
but a very small small
percentage of those are in it in
New Mexico I think a lot of this
is due to the.
Cost percent once although there
are less expensive to own
overall that purchase price is
been a barrier so I think this
tax credit will help many more
people to have an electric
vehicle for those reasons we
strongly support the bill thank
you.
Thank you madam.
My name is Danny cap on private
internet advocate with the NM
and we are also very excited to
support said it needs to as
amended as amended and our goal
is to the state missions
frequently I turned fifty
percent of our great way to the
Mexican for things that might
otherwise be a financial for
thank you thank you.
Mr chairman of the.
Walker's state lobbyist for
natural resources defense
council action fund and your
strong support for this bill are
compliment the senator for
eighteen minutes it's a smart
bill makes so much sense thank
you.
Our.
Good afternoon termination of
members of the committee
promises are with the Public
Service Company Mexico.
You know sports Senate bill
twenty two as it will make you
fees and charging stations more
affordable.
And that will also from
electrification which PNM is in
the process of having for
expectations programs in place.
This also provide clear energy
from transportation standpoint
and of course the national fees
will help a little bump.
For these reasons we support
thank you.
Good afternoon Mister chair of
this Martinez of tri state
generation and transmission
association on behalf of our
Leslie Levin members here in New
Mexico you know our our loop
renewable local B. fifty percent
by twenty twenty four to six
years for the EPA and I want to
invite you all to we have a yes
level for the next month here
for any of you to driver test
drive if you want.
Race Center Tom and I would
thank you all right thank you.
All right I believe we have the.
Couple of or a person on zoom hi
yes Mr chair we have
two people that want to speak
with you right now.
Excuse me
Intel's target so.
Senator.
But in two minutes okay.
Or less.
Good morning Mr chair and
members of the committee my name
is Daniel Pritchard and I live
in this house can you hear me.
Yes.
Where I'm speaking in support of
Senate bill twenty two and we
have to organizations I am on
the board of directors and
Representative Tesla owners club
of New Mexico.
And it's several hundred
supporters.
I'm also on the executive board
of renewable to house and it's
hundreds of members.
We believe that the reduced road
repair fee contribution is still
kind of high when you're talking
about the wind come and
moderateincome
people in the.
In the state and our attempts to
our promote climate solutions we
would prefer to see that zero
instead of eighty dollars or a
hundred and twenty dollars the
the the reason being is that
there's very few electric
vehicles in the state today it's
less that way less than one
percent and it's going to be a
while before you see any
substantial impact but we do
support the the remainder of the
bill thank you very much for
those for the opportunity to
provide comments.
The next one is on the console.
Yes thank you very much chairman
Chen no members of the committee
my name is on Solomon that co
coordinator with the climate
focused environmental
organization three fifty New
Mexico and on behalf of our
nearly seven thousand members
three fifty strong supports this
bill.
The rapid adoption of electric
vehicles is a key aspect of the
clean energy transition and the
tax credits in this bill will
allow customers especially lower
income customers to more easily
four clean electric vehicles.
Of these vehicles are not only
cleaner they are far cheaper to
fuel and to maintain and they
will reduce the fossil fuel
pollution major source of
diseases such as asked about
emphysema and heart disease.
And they will cut the carbon
emissions which are driving the
climate crisis so for this and
many other reasons we think this
Senator Tallman for introducing
this bill and express our strong
support thank you so much.
Chair the next speaker is boring
summer.
Yes
chairman Shendo and members of
the committee my name is Maurice
honor and R. E. a resident of
Albuquerque New Mexico in the
crowd form owner of.
an electric vehicle for almost
two years
And I am
very glad that money senator
Senator home and is introducing.
This bill
I believe that it will do a lot
to help lower income New Mexico
needs
get on the.
We need of.
Have you been able to hear me
yes.
Okay.
to only clean energy vehicles
and it will certainly help me
with the amendments on the lower
registration fee for my electric
vehicle so I do support and hope
that you will pass this bill
thank you.
Given that
also for repairs okay.
Good afternoon Mister chairman
committees of the committee
members I'm Barbara Calif
speaking for the league of women
voters of New Mexico the league
believes that government should
educate the public about how to
reduce Vigil carbon since and
should offer incentives to do so
this bill will encourage
ownership of more of elector
vehicles in New Mexico the
charging unit tax credit offers
a further incentive to switch
from fossil fuel to electricity
I urge you to pass this bill
thank you.
Thank you.
All right now go to the
committee for any additional
questions on the amended bill.
Thank you rex.
Thank you for sharing for the
billion annual going back to the
amendment where we changed it to
thirty
Thirty miles away
from the New Mexico or the cost
at least fifty five thousand
dollars we'll go thirty market
official economic the.
Why but one of the things that
senator Tom and I've talked
about stuff over the course of
New Orleans about.
The the number that registration
fee should.
On these types of collars and I
wanted to give you guys an
example.
And the example would be if the
car.
Get twenty miles to the gallon
it was set to go eighteen
thousand miles.
That means you would use about
nine hundred gallons a day.
Nine hundred gallons gas time
seventeen shares is a hundred
fifty three dollars and gas
staff.
At fifty three dollars does it
mean in the state and that all
in New Mexico.
But if they only go thirty miles
in range will that would
probably be closer to accurate
because we couldn't leave New
Mexico.
I'm being funny without.
But shut you know I mean like.
If you charged a if you charge
an additional fee the Senator
about the I thank you cut it
down I think I like your
original number better.
Because I think you would be
more.
More accurate but but all in all
these years to it's a debate on.
What it ought to be.
And the the electric vehicle I.
I don't know and and Mr chair
maybe Senator or members of the
O. T. and average electric.
Call our senator Senator tall
and special is that way more
than a normal is.
Vehicle yes definitely so
Senator it seems the ways more
it in theory should put a little
more stress on the on the
roadway.
Show the the cost should.
Arguably the a little more so
when we when we started this in
the center brought in and I've
seen some of the emails and he's
gotten word people's wanted
actually the number reduced.
But what Sierra we stand and
Center Tallinn did reduce the
number.
But it looks to me like as we
look at this stuff the number
may need to be at least where
what if it does need to be
higher.
And that that would just be here
my argument I don't have a
specific number to go with those
numbers I just I just right here
on how to how to get to that.
I don't know anybody else came
up with the number they came up
with will.
So it will Mister chairman
Senator of before we.
I have somebody give an
explanation of how they came up
with.
Something less than when I came
up with but I didn't agree with
but you said eighteen thousand
average person drives about
twelve thousand miles a year you
said eighteen.
So if I if the to the twelve
thousand miles your car gets
twenty five thousand miles again
according to Consumer Reports
I just do the math that's four
hundred eighty gallons you would
use if you have that and you
have R. five four hundred eighty
gallon time seventeen you get
eighty one dollars and sixty
cents and so that's sort I get.
The shares Center that come that
is the twelve thousand versus
the eighteen yes I came down for
a forty dollars for anybody.
Usually I used cars and cars are
going to be huge under twelve
thousand miles you can drive
with so I I'm not.
That's why the the when they
when they look at these numbers
thank you twelve thousand the U.
eighteen eighteen fifteen eighty
twenty four thousand miles and
so you just kind of float around
in between of so that's why I
use eighteen with with the
educators kind in the twenty
first and twenty but that's just
that Mr chair Senator
legislative session discussion
that's that's why you would were
you will have enough where I was
why I want what I want
Are you state the number of the
bigger you all the sins of the
of the smaller well I think
that's which it was a compromise
environmental groups wouldn't
support it this week I got down
forty dollars from hundred
twenty to eighties environmental
groups wanted fifty four
dollars.
And so I did I came down more
than halfway there twenty I'm
still twenty six dollars above
what they wanted but it's forty
dollars hello what I wanted so I
came down more than halfway.
But if you want to hear of us a
thorough explanation.
Of the how they came up with
fifty four dollars Sen my expert
witness who's on zoom can
explain it to you.
Mr chair Senator I appreciate
that but we just heard from the
team the average weight of
electives Education Act than the
average of band which should
mean that it it does.
Hardly more damage to the road
surface and we make chair
Senators justification which
part of yes yes and I don't know
anybody.
But I just I just wanted to
bring out of.
That view
for
me.
What what you're actually doing
it is wild DOT is going to get
this money is defined in the
bill.
It's probably not what they're
going to need to take care of
the Roach because the.
Arguably the damage that these
other vehicles due to greater
than revenue they're doing so
what are the Mr chair and and
senator
have you talked to your text
for Sunday in New Jersey bounces
around that I don't know we have
to do today so your your tier
one public comment if you
include the federal tax of
eighteen dollars eighteen cents
ago you double my eighties
dollars you get a hundred six.
R. yeah.
but
Thank okay we're done.
Thank you Mr okay all right
thanks to the bay.
Right now thank you I will go to
Senator Kernan.
Thank you transaction thank you
senator just a question about
looking into certification and I
guess the department's going to
have some process where people
percent that certification to
the Department
Have hello this.
My concern is I had a
constituent called me about
doing a solo project on the
house and try to get the
certification from the.
Company that actually did the
work and miss the deadline
because the company would
provide that in a timely manner
we've got a one year opportunity
here is there anything that's
going to be more complicated for
the auto dealer to provide
better sit going to be easy
process and guaranteed for them
to receive that certification.
Thank you for that question the
I'll have my
other experts can you answer
that question secretary please.
Mister chairman Senator.
this is one of the few tax
credits that's drafted to have
taxed that people certifying
agency typically we see a
subject matter expert agency
like EMNRD or someone certify
these so the language to
services that the credit can be
provided in that matter that the
department prescribes so we'll
be able to request whatever
documentation we need to.
Verify eligibility as far as
timing
the amendments I think that.
That there were some of this was
on a fiscal versus county here
basically and so we've ironed
that out
the thing another thing that's
unique about the way this one
this drafted is that there's a
cap but if you're not if you
don't make it within that cap if
we run out of capacity then your
first in the queue for next year
so there might be some
flexibility there
As far as if if you're late
getting your documentation of
whatever from your dealer that
makes sense thank you Mr chair
and so with regard thank you I
think that helps to have the the
roll over in other words if you
miss it the first year in the
end I just wonder Mr chair
Senator do you think that ten
million will be used up quickly
in that first year do you think
that these passively Mexico the
FIR indicated to that their
estimates only eight million
views but that's.
You know that's a lot of
assumptions of the look you know
how they came up with it but
that's what the FIR stated six
million Mr chair and so we might
not spend all with that roll
over to the next year the
capacity so it would be ten plus
two million if it's not all use
no it can't start over that.
That correct to it doesn't roll.
The ten million.
The left of the room no and
okay so
And help set is sort of the same
for the for the charging
stations I would assume the
credit would be similar to that
going forward so I think I heard
Mr chairman when we were kind of
this thing about EDC other day
you said by twenty twenty thirty
that they weren't going to
certain companies weren't even
going to produce the fossil of
the combustible the General
Motors going to stop producing
gas powered it so I guess is not
two thousand thirty I think
Vogel.
Lows is the projected business I
read that they're going to see
us cease manufacturing of gas
powered cars and.
The the two twenty twenty five
or six so Mister chairman
Senator sunset on this credit
because I'm just wondering if
we're not gonna be able to I
also feel anyway everybody's
going to be getting the credit
most people so would you
consider a sense said it's with
the anticipation is only for
five years this is for five
years that's what it is in
fiscal year twenty seven thank
you that I didn't see that.
in I guess Mr chairman and
senator is there a federal
income tax credit to buy
anything.
Mr chair and sorry yes but is
much more restrictive.
I don't have the details but
it's.
So we can correctly was
basically car has to be the
vehicle SB manufactured in the
United States.
Thank you Mr chair not the total
car but I thought it was part of
the inch process my.
Those you know the answer to
that.
That that's okay I'm just I'm
just curious because I maybe the
details but they're not it's
much more restrictive the staff
seven seven thousand dollars for
that income tax credit at the
federal level so we have that
seven thousand plus we're gonna
have the twenty five hundred and
in the end one thing I've I've
read recently was both Ford and
Tesla have significantly reduce
the cost of their vehicles and
that's dropped quite a bit so
you had another I maybe six
thousand dollars a year so we're
really going to get a pretty
good deal with NET out of state
I'm not sure if the tax credit
right now I think with the drop
in the cost
just a thought in the line of.
It is with the dealers dropping
the prices that's Mr chair
incentives is temporary.
That's I don't see that lasting
five years it's a very.
Short term September's New
Mexico is getting.
The deal is getting so goodness
to that even you might consider.
But I have to travel more I I in
rural New Mexico is pretty
difficult in the new ones of the
five hundred miles
one last question so when you
talk about the certificate and
how that certificate can be
exchanged
Every day
So K. particular car that
receives a certificate the file
for the credit and then that car
sold to another individual to
set individual also get a
benefit of that second hand car
and take advantage of that
certify Mr chair and senator I
don't believe so but finance my
expert witness secretary
attacked and rose.
To confirm that answer
page three Mr chair online
fifteen a certificate
certificate of eligibility maybe
sold exchange otherwise
transferred for the full value
of the credit so if you sell a
the the does that new owners
could also take the credit for
Mr chairman and senator the
language on page three in
paragraph F. is really difficult
but so I think what to do but
maybe the expert on lines of
credit this is wrong with way
interpreted that is that if I go
into the dealership and by the
selective vehicle today the
dealership or someone could by
the credit from you so that I
get the benefit and we delay
right there said of having to
wait for my tax refund in the
next that makes it thank you
all.
Okay thank you Senator Kernan
Anyone else in a different.
Mr chairman Sir thank you
so I I think Senator Kernan did
a good job
Madam had some good questions
So I just had a question just
to.
What's the purpose.
Besides giving a tax credit
what's what is the goal.
Why are we giving the tax code.
What the seo Lecter View.
So Mr chair would be correct if
I said to subsidize.
Collector vehicles because you
want to get more people into all
right.
Okay.
So.
How long.
Do we continue to subsidize.
Electric vehicles.
This bill cause for this
service.
Tax could end in fiscal year
twenty seven no I I I understand
what the bill says that we're
gonna do it for five more years
how many years have we been
doing.
The the state or the federal
either one.
The state has and hasn't been
doing it.
Here I'm sorry the state has
been doing at all.
Mr Chairman center so
you're very persistent because I
I thought you got this past
before and I appreciate that
your persistent individual and
so why so that's one way we are
very much alike so I'm just kind
of wondering since so yes was my
understanding is the federal is
the first program I don't know
what the current programs I
don't really keep up the for the
original programs for certain
number of vehicles the first fax
number that's been reached.
On tests and I think each
manufacturer had that same thing
with the first that's number I
don't remember what the number
because they said subsidized
ability to subsidized to get it
going to get the industry
started now we've got all these
companies are saying we're
running a make gas vehicles
anymore I think they're a little
bit ahead of themselves on that
because I don't know that we
have a grid that can handle all
elector vehicles by twenty
thirty the great if we do.
I just don't know that we do.
How long do we subsidize this
industry.
Mr chair.
Your.
I.
The we're talking about the the
original question was.
The card manufacturer
subsidizing hello do we as a
government subsidized the
candidate for the federal
government vote for it this bill
only seven point provided tax
credit for that so to fiscal
year twenty seven.
I don't expect.
I could be dead by then so.
Mister chairman Senator I hope
not but all of this could be hi.
What I can promise you I won't I
want to sponsor another tax cut
bill thousand twenty Mister
chairman Senator I recommend you
never make a promise like that
especially not around the
surface of on disposable to do
for our
so just you know I I just
recommend you don't ever do that
but I just I'm not sure of the
need because these vehicles are
very popular I couldn't buy a
Tesla today I'd have to get on a
waiting list
and and you honestly.
They start to get up to the
likes of four five hundred
dollars five mile range.
It's it's start mentors me now.
For a one of my vehicles I will
always have.
As far as I can always have a
Gaspare truck because.
You tell with like the the for
electric trucks.
I could tell my trailer seventy
miles is not a whole lot of
camping I can do on that.
So yeah that's just the that's
where the technology is today so
you know I appreciate it thank
you we'll keep talking about it
as far as the tax credit goes in
this may be more for taxed Rav
them for you you may not have
the answer you might so you talk
about four thousand for someone
who's who's under two hundred
percent of poverty level which
is about what forty thousand.
the two are percent poverty
level for an individual be about
forty thousand.
Not sure okay
what happens if they don't have
a tax liability are they just
sent a check from the state yes.
Okay so we're paying people to
buy.
I guess that's Mr chair Senator
says one way you can okay so I I
think I'm gonna talk to senator
Wirth about maybe you know we
did the the teacher deduction in
here maybe we have to change
that to a credit if we can do
that by an electric vehicle we
can do it to buy pens and
pencils and notebooks for for
children in the classroom thank
you Sir appreciate you bringing
the bill.
Thank you.
Thank you
I don't have anybody else on the
list.
What is pleasure the committee
this becomes part of the state
thank.
We hope this will all of this in
this one of I'm sorry this is a
tax credit so we're gonna hold.
This one as we've done all the
other of tax credits and
exemptions and so forth so we
won't take any action at the
moment thank you for that.
Thank you Mr thank you
The committee for giving this
your thorough consideration.
Thank you.
All righty next on the agenda is
just be ten the additional
twenty twenty one income tax
rates was senator Shendo and
Representative Chandler.
All right.
Sure you're welcome to go ahead
and start.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee.
The.
The Senate bill ten will do is
provide rebates to all New
Mexico residents.
Of New Mexico first item tax
filers
The rebates.
Will be seven fifty four
taxpayers that file single or
married filing separate tax
proof of who filed merry finally
joint head of household or
surviving spouse would receive
of fifteen hundred dollars about
a hundred seventy five thousand
New Mexico personal income tax
filers will see this a tax
relief.
Propose rebates offered fast and
efficient way to return about
billion of New Mexicos is stored
Revenue Service directly to
taxpayers the bill also
appropriates a thirty million to
the Human Services department to
make payments to New Mexico
residents who do not file a tax
return many New Mexicans are not
required to file a personal
income tax return due to low
income levels and this
appropriation was sure that they
are able to share this relief.
Taxpayers budgets are our
students then due to inflation
that includes a higher cost of
food heating gas and other basic
necessities this relief will
help countless New Mexico
families make ends meet.
General fund reserves are
projected to reach sixty percent
at the end of fiscal year twenty
twenty three.
prior to this decision to prior
to the decisions made during the
legislative session by with
prudent recurring tax relief in
a sensible state budget these
freebies are fiscally
responsible nonrecurring
commitment of the state that
will ensure that the state can
maintain a balanced budget for
future years
here with me is my expert
witness is our secretary of a
faction ref of Stephanie
Schardin Clarke so at this time
of.
Mexico and to make a statement
thank you okay thank thank you
Senator Shendo just for
clarification this is a bill
that will be voted on because it
is a nonrecurring request my
correct on that great that that
for information for the the
committee at this point before
we go to the committee is there
anybody in the audience who is
in favor of this bill.
K. one hand here anybody online
in favor of the bill I know this
time okay we have two people in
favor the bill.
yes we do have someone I'll give
you a chance to go ahead tally
that in just a second so I see
two people in favor of the bill
here in the audience either of
those in opposition of the bill
please raise your hand in the
audience.
See nobody in the audience in
opposition.
manager doesn't appear anyone's
opposition on the far right so
since we just have to hear to
align I was wondering why
certain for just happened if
they are LA utility take care
that if we can go ahead and have
those of you who are in favor of
you will come between Centers
secretary so the microphone can
pick you up.
If you will Senator Shendo do
you mind handing the the for
Michael.
And you might have to hold the
button so that the microphone
picks up your voice.
Thank you chair Shendo members
of the committee my name is Alex
past year Smith I'm acting
deputy secretary for the Human
Services department and I stand
in support of some in at the New
Mexicos thank you Mr Zuckerman
is many of you know we provide
critical safety net services
like food and nutrition support
of the Medicaid program
behavioral health and child
support we've had a successful
partnership in the past with the
tax revenue department in
distributing rebates to non
filers in our past
collaborations we've distributed
an average benefit of five
hundred seventeen dollars to
eighty five thousand five
hundred and ninety two lower
income New Mexicans totaling
twenty two million dollars so we
feel confident HSD that we can
partner again with TRD on this
initiative these Raby these
rebates are particularly
important this year because as
you all know food prices have
increased by over ten percent
compared to last year and
beginning next month in just a
couple of weeks a twenty four
percent of all New Mexicans are
going to see an average of one
third reduction in their snap
benefits that's really important
we have the highest percentage
of state residents enrolled in
the snap program in the country
that's significantly higher than
the US average of eighteen
percent we also have changes
coming to our Medicaid program
this year we anticipate between
eighty seven thousand four
hundred thousand New Mexicans
rolling off of the Medicaid
program and so these rebates can
help support other health care
costs as those New Mexicans
which to other forms of
insurance thank you.
Thank you very much Charles.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee and Charles good
marker speaking on in favor of
this bill on behalf of New
Mexico voices for children
action fund and we're so
strongly in support of this bill
and want to thank the sponsor in
the administration for bringing
it forward
we're in favor of especially in
light of the long term prospects
for
New Mexico's revenue picture
where while also at the same
time presently New Mexicans need
this relief Sonal this is a
smart way to provide some relief
to Mexicans without endangering
our long term prospects where we
know that eventually the oil and
gas revenue is going to decline
over the long term so this it
being a one time expenditures
it's a very smart way to go
provide that relief thank you.
We have it online.
Yes.
All right page if you would like
to testify you are welcome to
underuse yourself.
Yes thank you at U. committee
maintenance page nine and I'm
here New Mexico voices for
children to stand in support of
the ten we know so many families
in our state are struggling
financially and needs income
rebates will help ease that
stress and Ms to better afford
basic necessities like food and
housing all of providing a boost
to our economy yes I believe
this is a great use of one time
surplus money out we would
however recommend at and let's
just see the rebates
progressively structured so that
families who are most in need
receive a larger rebate since
raising food and energy prices
hit lower income households that
are in.
Again we support SB ten and
thank you secretary is very much
for this important initiative.
Thank you page what else.
No that's it okay so now it
moves on to the committee.
There any questions or comments
from the committee.
Senator Kernan.
Thank you Mr chair.
Yes.
Checking the appropriation on
page three no.
For.
With regard to the
administrative costs this being
appropriated Services Department
three hundred twenty thousand
two Texas red in the four
hundred and twenty two thousand
up to the DFA so I'm just
curious
is it intended that those
appropriations would be too hard
additional FTE ease or being.
I think you have trouble hiring
people now so can you kind of
tell me how those dollars from
your perspective would be spent
madam chair and senator Clinton
that's a great question no we're
not looking at hiring additional
FTE ease
with the to to do my best for
all three agencies that we've
received an appropriation the
twenty five thousand that's
appropriated to HSD would be
mainly to address their costs of
standing up their application
platforms they have a web based
secure application for the
thirty million dollars for non
filers and that includes for
example the cap for a you know
the I'm not a robot cost trying
to weed out fraud is as many
different ways as we can
the appropriation to taxed Rav
is mainly for contractual
services the gin Tax program but
a little bit of staff costs but
it's it's mainly but those are
existing staff it's it's it's
mainly the fast Gentex provider
I'm having to do some
programming to make this happen
and then the reason that DFA has
a larger.
And is that they are the
contractor with the state's
fiscal agent bank Wells Fargo
and so the costs here are for
printing and mailing and all of
that to get the rebates out the
door as quickly as possible
thank you madam chair
so the Gentex program the
administrative costs they're
happy determine what that's
going to be projected to they
just tell you what they're going
to have to charge madam chair
and Senator Kernan no we have an
existing contractual language
with them that we build in we
have there are our lifeblood
kind of we are we we do all
kinds of work with them there
the provider both Gentex and
tapestry and we have annual
contracts already in place and
will add this to the scope of
work but there are ready
procured and negotiated rates
for their services so madam
chair do you have to add
additional dollars anytime you
make a change to Gentex
madam chair and Senator Kernan
that's a slightly complicated
question most of the work we're
doing with them right now is on
a time and materials basis
because frankly we don't have
enough funding to pay them for
it on the deliverables basically
that's been the case since about
twenty nineteen so when we add a
large projects such as this we
do end up doing a time Tyrael to
dish into a contract with them
so just curious madam chair just
with regard to administrative
cost
You know I'm sure that's a big
part of what your budget is
needed for and so the probably
many different layers that where
that money comes from and how
it's expended that it seems that
just quite a bit of money if
you're not adding FTEs I guess
it's just what type of contract
is basically is that correct.
That's correct and and madam
chair and burn and I'm looking
at the back of the the tax and
Rev FY are and the three hundred
fifteen thousand of that is is
estimated contractual costs in
just four thousand of it is for
having materials technically to
deal with return mail thank you
very.
You any other questions senator
Graham.
Thank you
Madam chair.
Or chair.
Senator Shendo and and this is
really for tax or of so thank
you're now talking.
so I I have some constituents
and myself who never received a
tax refund from last year.
if they didn't from last year
they can receive this one.
And what do they do about the
fact that they never received
madam chair and senator brands
by and large rebates are out the
door and have been for several
months if anyone hasn't received
one yet it's probably a signal
that their return is being held
in error there are times where
we've reached out to tax payer
for example to identity for
identity verification or
something not meshing on the
return.
but what they should do is at
this point contact the
department to to find out where
that return is that they can
contact me directly or get to
the three you and I'll make sure
they get to the right place I
can get to use remain yes I
think that.
Just got a notice that was being
held up for and and I do have
several constituents about same
issue as the are the same
problem.
so my concern would be that
they're not gonna get it again
because they didn't get a last
time
so.
Okay let's be happy to speak
with you for your constituents
about that thank you.
Right before the accident but he
also committee Senator Wirth
will collect Senator for second
time thank you madam chair and
thank you Senator Shendo for
bringing the bill I think what's
important about.
The discussion here is and as we
talk about the total tax picture
is that this is nonrecurring
dollars and I just want to
highlight what was said some of
the public testimony.
I think there's room to do a
piece of this as part of the
overall tax discussion we're
gonna have
you know I'm concerned about
doing that a quote unquote.
Tax package that has a massive
recurring.
Donor to it and so I think.
You know we're gonna have to be
careful with that and we're
going to get chance to see that.
But there's room to do both and
so I will tell you to do have a
specific question I'm not sold
yet on the dollar amount I mean
I think that's really gonna this
is kind of a unique one it's
going to depend on how this fits
into the.
Into the overall picture of what
what's available for
nonrecurring so you know I may
be looking at that amount that's
lower than this
Well I have some some maybe they
want to double it but I think
that's going to be a continued
discussion I do have a question
I'd like to get madam secretary
here take on.
You know the comment that was
made with about how this weather
goes to everyone or whether we
do put some kind of a means
based in their this this
currently goes to everyone I
just like to have you explain
why
it's in that way in the bill
madam chair and senator Wirth I
can answer that in two different
ways from a state fiscal
perspective
as you know New Mexico was
income levels are fairly low
amongst the state and if we
created income cut off we
actually don't reduce the fiscal
impact of the rebate program
that much because there just
aren't that many higher income
filers in New Mexico
so that's from the state fiscal
perspective from a taxed ref
perspective we feel strongly
about trying to keep the
eligibility for these rebates
identical to the eligibility the
last rebates and the reason for
that is because we've already
done some of the work
the those that have already
received those rebates can stand
assure that they'll receive
these because the populations
are identical and so there's an
administrative part to getting
this money delivered to
taxpayers very quickly we
estimate that we can probably
issue the five hundred thousand
plus a CH payments six to eight
weeks after bill is signed
that's just about six weeks to
our program and and yes and have
everything ready and then that
would be the same time we would
start through the fiscal agent
bank to print and mail warrants
there's about three hundred and
fifty or so thousand that will
receive a paper check again
those will go out about fifty
thousand per day through the
bank until they're done so we we
really want New Mexicans to
receive this really quickly and
that's part of the reason that
the eligibility the same and
madam chair I know we've we've
changed the event the first one
of these we passed it did have
an eligibility threshold how
much longer in terms of the time
frame if you have to build it
from
scratch based on what we do.
if you look at insurance senator
Wirth I think the devils kind of
in the details on that and I
would hate to take a guess at
that without consulting or IT
staff but three months maybe is
what we could do with the
different eligibility criteria
one big factor that is important
is that we keep any rebates tied
to a taxpayers twenty twenty one
tax return part of the reason
that the rebate season was so
difficult for tax and Rev last
year was that we were tasked
with issuing rebates starting in
may twenty twenty two based on
tax returns that had not yet
really been filed and processed
it takes several months for a
tax return season to close and
and basically for the dust to
settle but now we would not have
that issue based on twenty
twenty one returns that and the
twenty twenty two returns aren't
even do Intel April eighteenth
or maybe even October fifteenth
so we wouldn't want to move
that.
Great thank you very much that's
all I have.
I think you Senator Kernan for
second time thank you very much
madam chair I have constituent
that contacted me and I'll send
you this letter actually he was
incarcerated in our local G. O.
facility and I just wonder how
we protect those into them and
they should be protected as well
with someone taking their I
don't know how you do that but
he he felt like he should have
received something I don't know
why but I'll send a letter
because I don't know what to do
with it so if you don't mind.
Please respond to that that
would be very thank you.
Any other questions from the
committee.
See none.
Senator Lopez madam chair I
moved to pass.
Second
moved to pastor center Lopez
second from Senator Brandt when
we please take real problem.
Senator Brandt yes
Representative Senator great.
Senator had a meal yes Senator
Kernan yes Senator Lopez yes so
defensive yes Senator Tallman.
Senator Wirth yes Senator
Hamblen yes Senator Shendo yes.
We have a hundred percent is
there a.
All right etcetera etcetera on
the Senator of your yes do you
have members of the committee we
do have Senate bill forty one is
the next one I don't see Center
for the in the room but I know
as expert witnesses here the.
Isn't a secretary thank you very
much years of this boy your ears
must been ringing.
So I.
Affect fluid all right.
All right Sir next bill is
Senate bill forty one local
telecom Care changes for the a.
Senator did you have the forces.
Thank you Mr madam chair madam
chair excuse me
Thank you very much for allowing
us to be heard this early in the
session we really appreciate
that
Senator forty one really is a
directed cleanup if you will
further modernization of the New
Mexico telecommunications Act of
two thousand seventeen which was
quite a lift if you all remember
three years slog of my own a lot
of other legislators following
on the field long way to get
that done and essentially it's a
it's of a simplified a bill
based on what we've brought over
the last two or three years to
further simplify the direction
that we gave the PRC back in two
thousand seventeen we did give
them two years to promulgate
rules on that legislation and
implement and they took all two
years
we are because it really we
provided microphones in this
room I need to get some for the
other rooms to.
And so
Okay so basically it requires
the PRC to regulate the basic
voice services of all
traditional landline companies
in the same manner that that
we've been regulating rural
telephone companies and and we
have also I've also brought
forward to you measures to but
for the reform the rural telcos
are rural telecommunications act
and we did add that as an
example sacred wind to that
particular type of regulation
about two years ago and madam
chair what this does is it takes
this company who's been on a
massive what one company it
directly affects there would be
others at different times but it
takes is one company and places
them in the regulatory
environment that all the other
companies in the state of New
Mexico or in it simplifies the
process by replacing really
seven subjective rather than
vague requirements
for this one single you know the
company and and it makes that
the requirements clearer and
easier to file and and and
allows them to continue to
invest in New Mexico to further
push broadband out you know due
to some of the hinterlands and
things of that nature it
establishes effective
competition in areas when other
provider when another providers
awarded funding from the state
or federal broadband program so
really two or more would
establish effective competition
that way and then I think it
really is as you all know you
know on the broadband front work
that I I've been doing in this
legislature for quite some time
future broadband investment and
so I think this is very helpful
that way
you know that there are a number
of jobs that are created through
this effort not just for the
companies that actually employ
the people but also the the the
economic development that the
services that they provide for
you know the bills into
communities by having you know
the highest speeds and from a
broadband standpoint and that
investment but also ability to
provide those telecommunication
services that way the
legislation does not increased
regulation on any voice or
broadband provider in New Mexico
simply.
Creates parity really is is what
our objective is here and then
this legislation does not
automatically Review relieve any
company from its obligation to
provide the basic voice service
to its customers I know that was
a concern of some of the members
of this committee when I was
walking around we're talking to
folks does not remove that
obligation to provide those
services
And then of course the PRC is is
still the place to file concerns
you know when you have issues in
the locality wherever you may
live I do have an expert witness
here today Mr Leo up aka who we
all know does work for lumen
previously CenturyLink per
previously quest and all the way
back down the line and
miss madam chair and so that's
essentially I'd like this to the
pocket just a few things and
then we'll take some questions
but I wanted to introduce the
sporty thing.
That is about madam chair my
name is Leo Baca I'm the
director of government and
regulatory affairs for
CenturyLink lumens in New Mexico
I've I've been with the company
for forty one years going all
the way back to mountain about
actually so I've seen it all
I've seen the the evolution of
the phone he was ten our state
here.
I've seen I've seen the
evolution of the phone industry
I've seen the evolution of the
network of technology I've seen
everything you could imagine and
one thing that I have seen in
the past twenty twenty five
years is the decline in the use
of a basic land line phone you
know how many of you still have
a phone at your house that you
use for voice not just your
alarm system but you just use it
provides and it's very few most
most people have these.
And.
And so what this bill deals with
is that basic land line phone
which in today's market
CenturyLink serves about fifteen
percent of the customers in our
market areas we only serve about
fifteen percent of customers
with landline phone service the
reason is is because the other
eighty five percent either have
a cellphone or they have a voice
over internet or they have Skype
for.
Fixed wireless there there's all
sorts of technologies that have
evolved over the past decade and
that's all folks are are
communicating now even years
soon call that we're on right
now they're able to communicate
with us we can hear their voices
that's voice service or presume
and that's all because of the
internet and that's because of
broadband that's out there so
this bill deals with those lines
land lines are going away and is
the dying part of our business
essentially and what we'd like
to do is is create fairness and
equity with the rural phone
companies so that we can have a
little bit less regulation.
At the at the beginning of this
and then be able to go to the
commission for determination of
effective competition where we
do have two or more competitors
and with that we can will stand
for questions thank you are you
alright you've heard the story
from a problem eighteen times
since I've been here I think we
finally have a bill that is is
is simplified and pare down to
exactly what we're trying to
accomplish I think we're very
good shape but this one thank
you.
Thank you senator at this moment
I would like to see who in the
audience is in support of this
show of hands.
Two three four five.
Who in the audience is in
opposition of this bill by show
of hands.
Nobody will pay anybody online
in support of this bill.
Anybody online in opposition is
our a notice that there was a
gentleman there.
The summer just raise your hand
Madam chair the work is part yes
right so let's have a couple of
folks here and we will give that
one person online and up to the
testify if I can have to from
either side
if you will I will ask you to
come up here so that you can use
the microphone of people on the
webcast can hear you.
So the two on this side of the
two on the side if you will go
ahead and get in line.
You're welcome to come on up
this Madam yes please.
Senator sorry.
Did a little dance for you Mr
chair and members of the
committee my name is Chelsea
Canada and I'm the director of
public policy at the New Mexico
chamber of commerce the chamber
supports Senate bill forty one
the bills needed for a few
different reasons we agree with
Senator Padilla the
communications industry has
changed significantly
significantly over the years
regular phone service is quickly
being replaced with wireless
service and broadband regulating
one company differently in a
competitive environment can be
harmful to that company SB forty
one proposes changes that will
provide a simple transition for
proper PRC oversight it also
provides a simplified objective
tests for the PRC to determine
effective competition the market
this bill will help New Mexico's
economic development efforts by
allowing all providers to
compete on a level playing field
and will encourage investment in
broadband New Mexico chamber
think Senator Padilla for
sponsoring this important piece
of legislation we ask that the
committee passed this bill thank
you.
But chairman members of the
committee Jason Espinoza
registered lobbyist with the New
Mexico technology council as
well as New Mexico idea which is
the economic development
professional association we
stand instructs part of the
legislation and really what this
bill is about is is right sizing
regulation here in New Mexico we
want to create the regulatory
environment that creates an
incentive for companies to
invest in the things that we
want and in this case.
Broadband yes there you go there
it is all right which is
broadband it I want to things
that I just want to know to when
we look at land line on only
according to the national center
for health statistics in terms
of adults the only have land
lines it's only three percent.
I here in New Mexico and then we
look at wireless only for adults
that seventy six point five
percent so we really do need to
update and modernize our
regulations so that we can
invest in the future thank you.
Yeah stand maybe off to the side
over here I think it's.
Mr chairman members of the
committee let's take a selfie
holding the buttons to push the
button on the microchip.
You don't have to get any closer
to assist hold you have to hold
that button.
Although I speak Mr chairman
members the committee might take
us on the on this
executive director for the New
Mexico exchange Kerry group I'm
also a registered lobbyist The
New Mexico exchange carrier
group is an association of ten
rural telephone companies in New
Mexico providing internet land
line broadband services for
rural areas of the state we
stand we stand in strong
support.
Senate bill forty one we want to
thank senator perfect Padilla
for sponsoring the legislation
as you know the voice market in
New Mexico is very different
than it was twenty years ago.
The land lines and all
traditional phone companies like
the real test companies and
lumen we are seeing decreases in
our our land lines and of course
an increase in our broadband
lines because that is where
everyone is moving.
Senate bill forty one proposes
changes that will regulate all
land line phone companies the
same as the rural telephone
companies which have been
regulated in this market for
twenty years.
The enemy CG again supports this
parity of regulation for all
phone companies and we ask for
your support thank you.
Mr chair members of the
committee my name is Bianca the
terrace and I'm here on behalf
of sacred wind.
Is already done such a great job
of explaining why you should
support this bill and I just
wanna let you know that segments
of point them thank you.
Thank you so much we saw the
person online would like to
testify yes.
Fernando Romero.
Fernando speaking against a pay
but there's nobody else online
who is speaking in favor.
That's going to be given an
opportunity to speak with the
opposition of this bill Fernando
please on yourself.
Thank you very much and good
afternoon madam chair committee
my name is for non Remond and
communication workers of
America.
And I have been a member for
twenty nine years our New Mexico
State to be presidents and
members are speaking against us
forty one.
Garcia to be a New Mexico team
are against the regulation of
this major telecommunications
company this major
telecommunications company has
service quality obligations to
consumers of New Mexico.
See WA's the union that
represents the technicians who
are the frontline workers with
this major telecommunications
companies customers every day
they see the problems first hand
and have witnessed the changing
business practices that are
exacerbated the issues that
resulted in New Mexico your sis
decision to reinstate service
quality issues just a short time
ago.
SB forty one will jeopardize
subscribers.
Access to essential voice and
broadband services.
And this major
telecommunications company will
not be obligated to maintain its
plan.
An undisclosed number of
subscribers especially those
fifteen percent that Mr Baca
quoted earlier earlier in rural
New Mexico our land line only
with no cable or cell phone
connections seniors and
households in rural and fringe
areas that don't have the
alternative cell phone service
constitute a large proportion of
those kinds of customers.
Those consumers also rely on
home security dialogue organized
services due to for cell phone
service and also for subscribers
to lifeline which in some areas
required in service the most
important is crucial nine one
one services with caller ID will
accurately identify home
addresses we care about the
three percent that orders have
spoke of to where they have
access to these services.
More evidence from other states
show that absent regulatory
oversight there will be a
decline in service quality and
consumer protections with the
investment from president
Biden's infrastructure
investment and jobs and the
commitment governor Lujan
Grisham will investing quality
problem with minimum speed
standards which will handout
ways over I. T. services but
until that happens we must hold
off on the regulation of this
industry it is for this reason
that urgent vote against SP
forty one thank you for your
time madam chair committee.
I thank you very much appreciate
that were good with public
testimony yes Mr Senator Padilla
thank you madam chair and I and
I do want to thank Mr Amman for
speaking I think he covered some
very valid points I will say
that in the effort to pass the
two thousand seventeen measure I
spent about a different times
over three year period in the
union hall for CW a going piece
by piece and and ensuring that
the work we got done in
seventeen was something that
they were well included and and
and that that organization was
was a part of the of the of the
work they're at since I can tell
you I was literally in a
ballroom and Indian cultural
fair in the when the inner
interim Indian and cultural
affairs committees and we had a
a call there we had multiple
discussions with union
presidents on this matter and I
have to respectfully disagree
with one of the comments that
was made there and I think it's
one of the more critical ones
and that's the you know that
jeopardizing and and and cutting
off lines or whatever that is
completely that's not allowed at
all so if you look at that sixty
three dash nine eight S. six dot
two.
All carrier of last resort this
is another section of law that's
that that is referenced in the
bill but it's it's another
section here I just want to read
it to you madam chair any
telecommunications company this
is very important any
telecommunications company which
has a certificate of public
convenience and necessity
permitting it to provide message
telecommunication service
between or among local exchange
area shall not be allowed shall
not be allowed to terminate or
withdraw from providing message
telecommunication service
between or among local exchange
areas without an order of the
commission upon a finding that
there is another
telecommunications company in
place table providing service
without interruption so chair of
the COVID well I I have a great
deal of respect and it worked
very closely with CW a over the
years and has been a a really
tough effort that you know that
there's no way that a company
can just back out of a
particular area of this company
that I'm it's here today or any
other company they would have to
go to the commission the
commission which is a regulatory
body in our state would have to
then approve that.
Can't imagine under what
circumstances they would approve
that but there's there that
that's that's just a false
statement respectfully it's not
true so.
Thank you senator for the and
now I'm going to the committee
are there any questions from the
committee.
Senator had a meal.
Thank you chair and this is
something I have one question.
Fifteen percent Representative
one lines fifteen percent is the
other eighty five percent of the
billion.
great question Mr chairman and
senator how do we have it's it's
it's essentially all of the
above there's a portion that
would be voice lines which are
not regulated by the New Mexico
by in state law there
That they're regulated at the
federal level but they're in and
they're really not even
regulated because that call in
that ways is delivered over the
over brought the broadband
connection wireless connections
so what the regulation what is
yes so if they only have a
wireless option in their area
that's also not regulated this
maintains regulation this is a
critical point I'm glad you
asked this this maintains the
regulation over this company
just like any of the other rural
companies that exist in New
Mexico some of those companies
might have thirty five hundred
customers this one is gone from
roughly nine hundred thousand
customers it at its peak to less
than a hundred twenty five
thousand so and and I would
envision with the advent of
technology and I think you know
we I think we all those as every
ten years we advance over one
hundred years in the previous
technological advances every ten
years now eventually the land
lance's won't exist at all but
they are still regulated and
they still need to be maintained
just like they are today.
This doesn't change anything
about that just one more
question so it is very the last
caller was in opposition that
are hearing you say that there
would still be a commitment to
rural New Mexicans of the still
be connected no disruption in
their services if you take for
example in one on that which is
Rio Arriba County we have a lot
of other to have to walk from
one side to get a signal on our
cell phone but does
she ever needed to use or sell
is there still.
Mister chairman Senator that's
exactly why I thought I would
redo the actual a rural here
Kerry of last resort addresses
exactly what you're talking
about not under discussion today
but other pieces of legislation
caring this time another bill
that the chair this morning
actually makes money is
available for what you're
describing to further improve
that network to to shrink that
mile down to that person's house
but that's a whole other measure
that we're not talking about it
but I'm pushing that went
through as well I move to we're
gonna try to get that done this
year also.
Further questions thank you
thank you any other questions
from the committee.
Senator Wirth thank you madam
chair.
So I a couple of questions.
Basically if I read the
effective competition the new
definition make sure I
understand this
it requires that voice services
are reasonably available from
two or more for the providers.
So what what is what is
reasonably available.
I.
Up madam chair Madam chair
Senator Wirth
In most cases ninety nine
percent of the cases were
recently available with me is
like if you have phone service
at your home and there is a
cable company whose facilities
are on that street you don't
currently have service from them
but there are currently on that
street and you want to be able
to get service from that cable
provider.
And disconnect your landline
from CenturyLink.
Recently available means that
within within a reasonable
amount of time they be able to
get a line from the table on the
street to your home and you'd be
able to get service from them so
you'd be able to get service
from this other provider in a
reasonable amount of time.
That's that's mostly what that
means madam chair why not just
leave the the current language
is being struck on page twelve
line twelve says provide the
same reason we comparable
service at the time for which
the finding of affect
competition saw.
Okay because again as I read
this and and if you look at our
FC I mean if there's a service
within a wire service center
here just if broadband is there
anywhere basically there's a
finding of of effective
competition I mean I just this
is the way this is drafted B.
and C. I will tell you to me.
It's it's.
It's basically eliminating the
requirement of affected
competent.
Because all you need to do is
have.
Technology somewhere that
provides voice services
regulated or unregulated whether
the voice services are provided
by the altar provides receive
state or federal funding
assistance.
I mean it just ended and the
definitions that are in here.
If there's a broadband it I mean
this is a great question and I I
will tell you I have a staff
person in this building who
quite frankly the cell service
justice center would that army
of said cell service didn't work
couldn't get internet finally
the thing that's that's been a
game changer something that's
not in this bill which I think
is available to every single new
Mexican it's just expensive
right now starlink.
And it's high speed that's the
way I I will tell you that my
house in Santa Fe.
I couldn't get the internet's of
fortunately with all due respect
your company it did not offer me
fast service I got a little bit
faster with the tiny little dish
when we put a starlink satellite
on the roof about a hundred
Bucks a month.
Game changing and that's
available anywhere in New Mexico
so for anyone who's got
constituents having trouble
getting internet starlink does
that and and obviously the
satellite it's different
So again I just.
Is there a reason why you
wouldn't leave the language in
there because I would as a
lawyer Reese and we're going to
Judiciary so we're gonna have
this discussion more reasonably
available is is a ticket to a
whole bunch of.
Lawyers in court fighting or
what that means and before there
was a definition it was
basically provide the same or
reasonably.
This.
Which is more of an equal
service sites what flag that is
an issue one second thing could
under the new definition could
the competition be affiliated
with your company.
So can we would like to take
item one in New Mexico yeah I
mean if you want to treat let's
try at least to get to the
bottom ones okay and madam chair
Senator Wirth.
I think the word compatible is
is bothersome because what does
comparable me I have lived
through a couple of procedures
and part of the PRC where the
old law that's been stricken
here there's words in this old
law that you can get five
different lawyers at look at the
same word and it looks
differently to all five
different lawyers so compare
what's comparable is that
compatible enough is that to
compare I don't know so we're
trying to simplify this and just
really look at the reality of
what we're faced with the market
place we serve fifteen percent
of the customers in most of our
service area we do have we don't
even have to count starting
because we got we have the cable
company provide service and
direct us there's affiliates of
other companies who are
competitive local exchange
carriers who are in competition
with us I mean we're even
talking in areas like rat tone
and Las Vegas the lan has
competitors within the lamb we
have lost many access lines in
the eastern part of the state to
companies who have a competitive
local exchange carrier affiliate
and so fixed wireless is out
there the vast majority of the
state we don't even need to
count starlink because there's
there's lots of competition here
in Santa Fe there are a few
areas very few areas that I I I
received a call from a rancher
outside to Gallup P. lives maybe
ten miles outside of Gallup and
this was just Pat this past
Saturday and.
He was concerned about his his
monitoring system for is
ranchers concerned he wants to
see his alarm to work I had a
technician out there Monday
morning to go check it out and
that technician checked ten
miles worth of line to see if
that was working properly and
found come to find out it was
and it was a problem with the
equipment we respond and right
now the commission does not
regulate broadband and anytime
anyone has a problem with
broadband we respond.
Stop it because the words using
in order just as ambiguous
reasonably available you're
gonna have exactly the same
issue what does that mean and so
I don't I don't I'm just
flagging this and again you're
going this year is our flag this
is something to look at because
I just think that's a piece and
then we'll end yeah well that
was the only thing I would add
is again none not a tourney but
what I would say recently
compatible is the speed verses
that speed that to me would be
what could would would make
compatibility recently available
with the whole this service is
available through this mess this
this modality and then you have
another modality available over
doesn't mean that they have to
be the same speeds but but they
should be held accountable to
another company twenty two going
to compete in the year where
they might be
at the exact same speed.
the in if they don't get that
other company doesn't and
they're penalized.
That make any sense what it does
and again or putting some new
definitions into the bill that
alternative providers which is
key because that's what the
sections and again I don't want
I don't want to do the judiciary
here but I'm just saying
alternative providers is defined
as a person.
In other provides voice services
regarding technology used person
is then defined literally could
be a person you know so could be
we could be someone who's got a.
Very small little satellite set
up which again I use the example
the one I know from up north
there was a company that was
trying to find.
You know broadband one work and
the wind blows in the tower
falls over all those kinds of
things I just I just think that
that you know that issue of of
what we're doing here is we're
basically.
I can appreciate Mr chair and
and then as the example you just
again I just wanna make it clear
that that's your description was
a broadband these are on the
lines that already the actual
hard pots lines already exist
but here's the key thing though
if that broadband supplies here
you you've brought if if there's
any broadband in the area
there's effective competition so
so I just I point out okay and
and the second thing just.
Previously there was a
requirement that that.
For competition the that the
other company had to be
unaffiliated with the
petitioning carrier that's been
removed so my question is so you
know this company could set up a
small subsidiary that's doing a
tiny piece and all of a sudden I
just am curious why were why why
that needs to be out so I'm
flying some things for the next
step your legislative.
I've been around here for twenty
years and I've seen these bills
and I know how challenging the
stuff is and and I do think
we've reached the point where
parity is a good goal I'm not in
any way criticizing that but at
the same time.
You know I just want to make
sure we're not doing something
that's going to result in I mean
look at the fire up north.
I mean for public safety reasons
you know that's a perfect
example lots of those
communities really do did not
have access it's and cell cell
service didn't work there's no
internet up there and the one
thing they have is a land line
and and again I appreciate I
want to study this carrier of
last resort because I think
that's a critical question.
Okay again if if this passes and
you said you'd like to get out
of this business of land lines
are going away.
They're going away I think in
the in your testimony you said
landlines are going away no I I
think I think that's the reality
is a land lines are thing of the
past and this is a legacy
carryover and this bill will
allow you also.
That more of the money that
previously couldn't use and
broadband and again that's the
goal is to make it more
accessible I think that's that
is that I can't speak for them
but but but the the state of New
Mexico should have the goal of
modernization of apps all of the
above and I support that I mean
I think we need to.
We need to get there I just
think those questions about just
because I would just tell you
the very good lawyers that
drafted this bill there's a
reason things are in the things
that we talked about that this
morning.
I mean some of the the wording
that's there and so I just think
workers world we're moving
forward going to have that.
Discussion just making sure that
that we're not creating a
situation where.
There's an automatic scenario
where.
There's not gonna be
availability of land line one
that's really all that's there
and I know you're not that
you're that's not what you're
trying to do.
But that's just a quick the the
issues that are gonna continue
to look at that's a half thank
you thank you thank you senator
Wirth and thank you very much
for the that's the discussion
because those are the points
that is the whole point of of
why we're having these these
committee meetings as to to
workshop the stuff out and make
sure that it's doing what the
intent is are there any other
questions from the committee
senator Sanchez.
Thank you madam chair and just a
quick question and to touch on
what senator Wirth said so if
you have a smaller company out
there we have won their boss
Care I don't know what he
reaches maybe a thousand people
are I if his speed is not up to
will he be penalised.
In any way like he was talking
to the the small satellites that
they have up north does not
affect any of the small little
guys you Mr chairman no it
wouldn't and also again that's
broadband which I know that we
talked about that's eventually
some of the and and and an
option that we're saying is part
of effective Cup competition
definition but we're we're
really far off the.
Off the path I just hired of
talking about that senator madam
chair Senator so I just okay.
That's it any other questions
one final thing they'll that the
key thing is that that property
of one thousand is going to be
sufficient to trigger the
effective competition in that
area.
Under this bill so just so I
understand and that's that's the
that's the piece it only takes
did only takes you know two or
more right here on the O. H. is
but it doesn't years count as
one of them of takes two
additional companies.
Okay so that's good for them to
get clarification to understand
that.
But I it does begin counting
yeah.
Thank you madam chair senator
and senator that's the what
themselves four I thank senator
Sanchez Wirth anything else
before ask for with the will of
the committee is.
What is the will of the
committee.
Under the tax center Kernan two
passed by the second second
second by Senator Stewart meal
when we took roll call the.
Senator.
This Senator Lopez yes.
Representative yes.
Senator Wirth.
Yes.
Senator Hamblen yes Senator
Shendo yes.
Already on it eight.
Zero years yes good looking
Judiciary Commission.
The definition.
Already
souls can we get those.
He's in his office.
You want to have this back I
guess.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right since we're waiting
for Senators souls are going to
go ahead and move to SB forty
eight the city or county
mandatory vehicle inspections
from senator Wirth and
representatives capacity then
when center souls is here will
do that and then after that
will hopefully will hit SB forty
six from Senator Duhigg center
with your of your it's all yours
thank you madam chair and
representative of Sapanta keys
on her way over I know we also
have a number of folks from the
City of Santa Fe who are here to
testify in support of this bill
basically what this would do is
allow class a
counties and municipalities
within classe counties to enact
an ordinance to establish an
inspection program for vehicle
noise or safety issues Class say
counties include Bernalillo Dona
Ana Santa
San Juan in Santa Fe I see I
brought my expert witness which
is the best thing I could do in
this case this is Carol Romero
Wirth city council from Santa Fe
so the issue with the vehicle
noise has been one that has been
huge here in Santa Fe and all
what
Council Romero Wirth talk about
that
the key of this bill is that
it's not a mandate in any way
this is really an option for
local governments to put in
place an inspection program
currently in the state of New
Mexico we have one up for type
program and that's in
Albuquerque Albuquerque
Bernalillo care for the when
there were serious issues with
air quality in in Albuquerque
they put in place a vehicle
inspection that exists to this
day and we did that by statute
basically allowing the local
government to put that in place
this.
Bill would do.
The same type of thing you would
authorize those local
governments that decide to move
forward to put that in place and
so we can get into the specifics
of the bill but that's the
general gist of it and I would
be able to counsel their work
who can speak about the issue
from a from a real local state
it from Steinborn what we've
been dealing with here in Santa
Fe.
Thank you US senator Wirth and
Peter and thank you committee
for it hearing this bill this
afternoon I have with me
senator or senator.
city councilors sig Lindell and
I also from the mayor's office
Danny Makki and
We had county commissioner there
we go.
from Santa Fe County here with
us too so if you need other
local perspectives we have been
dealing as many cities across
the country have been dealing
with this loud vehicle noise and
we get a lot of complaints from
our constituents we're getting a
lot of complaints from downtown.
Merchants hotel owners and
tourists even and that it's very
loud there are people who across
in this is a city in this is not
just in our downtown area but
across the city where people are
suffering from very loud vehicle
noise we are doing a number of
things at the local level to try
to address this we are we've
been very successful in the City
of Santa Fe and lateral hires to
increase our police force the
city council recently past an
ordinance to the top of the fees
for altered vehicles and all the
altered mufflers and vehicle
noise we are seeking your help
in allowing us to do a vehicle
inspection program where we
would be looking for safety
things and among those things
are would be not just altered
vehicles are altered mufflers
I'm so sorry but
things like a broken windshield
or a cover over your license
plate or a license plate maybe
that's sold its dole and you
can't read it anymore so these
are these in inspection programs
are things that happen across
the country in other communities
we're asking your permission to
do them in class eight counties
only
and they would allow for a
number of
Items to be looked at to make
sure that the vehicle is safe
this is not an admission this is
this particular bill is not
emissions related it's it's
about the safety of the vehicle
and we're happy to answer
questions and Mr chair we do
have Representative pants Keefer
the first first time here just
just got here so I'd like to
just this may be her first
Senate committee is.
Good afternoon hi Mr chairman
members of the committee I'm
just pleased to support this
legislation and it really came
to us from constituents so I
think it's it allows for this to
be utilized in the the in
municipalities are concerned
with it and and I really
appreciate the localized
approach.
This is just to reiterate it's
the key thing is is just classic
counties so again that that
narrows it down and again it's
local option and with that would
have to stand for questions a
great thank you.
So at this time we'll go out to
the audience those are in
support of this bill.
This is because if you hear a
few here.
I want to again the state couple
of folks because we were in
interest of time we get a couple
of people here if you can come
up to my in New Mexico people on
this side.
Thank you Mr the way thank you
Mr chairman committee members
were names Tom Anders and in
Santa Fe.
Today on sept.
Also in member of stop
aggressive driving which is a
citizens group here in Santa Fe
we've been working with the city
council personally I have
documented all the noise issues
etcetera to our city council
twenty months ago and since then
we have successfully over those
twenty months with the.
Support of counselors sig
Lindell.
Got one.
Nearly one ordinance to increase
the fees on the tickets from.
Twenty five or thirty dollars
whatever it was something like
that two one hundred dollars for
the first.
First offense and two fifties
thereafter and three hundred if
it's a third time.
Hi
To tell you that we have
received at the office are
excuse me at the meeting of the
stop aggressive driving which is
every held every two weeks act
of one of the
of.
Hotels here in town very
graciously.
That hotels in giving us a
meeting space because they are
victims and their visitors are
victims of of the loud mufflers
and one of my favorite
expressions is allowed more for
a few years we've all X. most of
us have experienced those the
sound like a.
Open pickup truck going down the
street with the chainsaw and.
Running and.
So there there
impacting of the people and who
are
Hard of hearing in fact one of
the strange things for people
who are hard of hearing and have
hearing aids that noise is
amplified because of the
construction of the year and it
really are triggers both vets
with these P. STD are to go into
a very stressful in panic mode
so hi
again no I I just wanted to
point out these things
Albuquerque has fixed speed
cameras and
It has a problem with racing.
This bill will obviously thank
you I'll be real sure our cut
off thanks.
again thank you Mr chairman
serve taken so long we can allow
for a couple minutes that's it
thank you.
Good afternoon Mister chair my
name is Justin green I'm if
thirty two day old county
commissioner from Santa Fe
County so thank you very much
in support of this bill for
variety reasons I appreciate the
local often and the class say
counties to simplify it for
these counties that are a little
more urban that that you might
need this in urban situations
where the echo and the urban
situation of it's already loud
enough in cities as it is Santa
Fe County has this issue with
the in this the county limits
and within the City of Santa Fe
and I stand in support of this
thank you very much guys thank
you.
Hello my name is Mona K..
For me quickly but the whole
downturn my name is Mona K. I
grew up in Albuquerque have
lived in Santa Fe for forty two
years now socially I've been in
the state my whole life the
noise level in the streets from
the individuals that are
willfully modifying their
mufflers just to make noise and
drive around at night has become
a serious problem in our city I
live half a mile from more there
been times when I've thought I'm
going to have to move it goes on
to two in the morning sometimes
all afternoon I really support
this bill this is impacting a
lot of people's lives
this were the city
one of the city councillors at
the meeting to raise the.
The fine so that a lot of these
packages that they put on cars
have names like Nibert hater or
angry housewife I don't find
these sorts of
Packages
Being purchased by anybody who
wants to live in a in a
community peacefully this
aggression so I do support this
bill one hundred percent just be
for forty eight thank you.
If.
What.
The property.
Good afternoon chairman and
committee members my name Cygni
Lundell I am the mayor pro tem
for the City of Santa Fe and
city council for district one
thank you for hearing us today
thank you for bringing this
forward to senator Wirth
I'm in full support of this and
our it's a health and safety
issue I would also say that by
allowing us to have this type of
inspection it would not put the
enforcement of this on to police
and our first responders so that
they can be spending their time
on issues that are more critical
than the muffler issue
It it's a huge constituent
problem.
At bart to ask our first
responders to be spending their
time doing that it's not really
the focus for their enforcement
but we need some help with this
so I hope you'll support this
and I appreciate the time to
speak thank you chair.
One more beer.
Thanks.
Good afternoon thank you chair
members of the committee my name
is Jamie kasa and my Santa Fe
city council representing
district four I come to speak in
strong support of this bill as
my colleagues have mentioned
this is a challenge in our city
we've heard from our
constituents but this also does
provide us the opportunity to
look at local options to see how
we can improve the safety of our
roads as well as better you look
utilize our public safety
officers time so thank you all
so much for your consideration
thank you to the sponsors for
bringing it forward a very much
appreciated.
All right I'll go to folks in
opposition of this bill.
Or not to have anybody support
no okay chairman and body work
okay all right thank you anybody
in opposition of of this bill.
I see none will go into
Committee for questions Senator
breath.
Senator.
And we're we're back to the
texting while driving issues on.
The personal jokes are
the.
So I I all the testimonies from
people to New.
that seems like there have an
order so I'm I'm confused why do
we need to change the law for
the entire state when the sounds
like it's a city Santa Fe issue
and they've already dealt with
the COVID of Mister chairman
Senator thanks for the question
first of all we're not changing
a lot for the entire state all
we're doing is giving Senator
classe counties the option of
looking at this this is a huge
issue in Albuquerque I know
they're talking about actually
they've gone down no waist
cameras that are up voice and
camera maybe the wrong word but
a noise sensors that are up to
deal with this issue I would I
just spent the night in downtown
Albuquerque and I was amazed
quite frankly two o'clock in the
morning I mean the noise was
extraordinary and so.
I think the reality is for these
communities where this is an
issue this just gives their
local government an option if
it's not an issue in a classic
County then certainly the local
government would move forward so
I just the the worst thing we
could do is is mandate this and
require this from a state level
we're not doing that it's local
option in select counties.
He was chairman of the.
Senator doesn't this make it
where people will register the
vehicle without this inspection.
So yes if you look at basically
there will be a requirement
to go in and do the inspection
and and on page three of the
bill
it basically gives motor
vehicles the option to refuse.
To register the vehicle if the
owner is required but has failed
to provide proof of compliance
with the deal with the vehicle
inspection I think that's no
different than what exists now
in Albuquerque and Bernalillo
county with the air issue and so
that requires an inspection you
go get the inspection you bring
in a certificate of compliance.
Okay Mister chairman Senator
Who pays inspection.
So the individual owner again I
I guess let me just say this I I
shouldn't answer that way
because that that would be up to
local government but my guess
would be that they're going to
require.
You know the car owner to go in
and have it inspected
and that's going to be an
expense there's no question
but I think and I think as was
pointed out earlier.
You know there's a variety of
different things that that.
They could look at under this
bill but that's going to be
built into the ordinance so to
be specific to that local
community Mr Chairman etcetera
so.
Your expectation is is that the
city would open up inspection
stations.
That in the poor state in the
union.
People who are already
struggling to make ends meet I'm
gonna have to pay to go have an
inspection on the vehicle.
So that they can have a
registered vehicle legally to
drive to get back and forth to
work so Mister chairman right
now I don't think the city's
going to put in place city
inspection stations I think it's
gonna be local businesses no
different than what happens
right now in Albuquerque that's
been in place for many years
it's a process that's in place
different private entities offer
the inspection and so again
that's a model that has worked
there
what it would look like here
would have to be defined I I
would note that they there also
is a provision that allows for
an exemption.
For certain vehicles because of
age or type of vehicle that's
one of the issues that come up
as you know my hot rodder my old
cruiser
has a muffler that's loud
without a modification that
something that could be
discussed and addressed in the
ordinance.
So Mister chairman Senator the
city will decide what what the
decibels is going to be allowed
to they're going to decide
how much noise of vehicle to
make that's all the love to the
city to decide a city to city
basically.
Mr chair if if a if a class
eight county or city within that
county combination of elects to
move forward this thing yes and
those are the issues and let me
just say right now for law
enforcement you know seeking to
issue a citation they're dealing
with all those issues right now
you know what's the measuring
tool what's the decibel limit
all those kinds of things so
again I think that would all
have to be spelled out in the in
the ordinance though Mr chairman
Senator what happens if
I live in Rio Rancho they don't
do this I drive to Santa Fe in
my motorcycle and it exceeds the
noise ordinance what happens to
me Mr Mr chair you're going to
get a citation.
Under the or you just heard
you're gonna get a you're going
to get a citation from the
police that's still in place you
know this this applies if you
live in that county so if you're
driving to a different County.
This would not apply.
This program.
So we don't want people from Rio
Rancho Mister chairman Senator
coming to Santa Fe thank you Mr
chairman we'd love to have you
in Santa Fe in many of you come.
And again it's the nothing's
every Davis so it's in and not
and nothing's going to change
with this bill to how your
impacted coming from Rio Rancho
Santa Fe if you modify your
muffler I think you've heard
from the council council they
just increase some of the.
The fees to try and address it
that way I just think within.
The local communities this is
another option to.
Require that inspection to again
get get the get the problem
fixed not just pay the fee but
let's get the problem fixed so
we don't have.
This level of pervasive noise
what was gentleman Sir I
appreciate that I understand
what you're saying I understand
however because of a few bad
apples you're raising the
expense of every person that
lives in Santa Fe poor rich
doesn't matter to be able to get
to work and have vehicle this
register instead of dealing with
the people individually that are
actually causing the problem
we're again putting another fees
on every citizen.
Obviously this the county for of
Santa fe's are excited to do
this the long as you get this
bill passed so you know.
Word you're gonna make it more
difficult for those in poverty
in Santa Fe which is already
very hard to survive in this
county
involved you're gonna make it
even harder for the is going to
vote for them because they're
gonna have to pay whatever the
FIA's there's no limit in this
bill is to what if you can be
and I know the one in
Albuquerque for the smog
valid converter Jack has just
gone up and up and up every year
and makes it more and more
difficult for those in poverty
to actually comply with the law
and the other vehicles
registered which we do have a
problem with the state already.
So Mister chair again I think
you're making an assumption
about what the fee would be
again I don't know whether the
city plans to assist and there
could certainly be a program to
assist those with lower income
to do that I've got a another
bill on fees and driver's
license that I'm looking forward
to discussing with you but
that's how for for this today
you know basically taking away
someone's driver's license
because they can't pay the fees
and we'll have a discussion
about that on the floor but
that's a different deal than
today but this this really does
say you know here in Santa Fe
decided to move forward as a
city or just the commissioner
was here could be city county
thing as Bernalillo is then that
it would be up to the local
governments to determine what
that look like and obviously
these role models who are
hearing from all of their
constituents and so you know the
point you raise of I'm not
minimizing in anyway.
The measurements are appreciate
that I appreciate that you and I
have always are able to have a
respectful
disagreement without being
disagreeable I wish everyone was
that way of your and I do
appreciate that we've always
been able to do that I as you
can tell just like with the
cell phone bill the right server
years ago I don't agree I think
this is again governments
reading or doesn't need to we're
for punishing every citizen.
For a very few people.
That are disrupting the
community those people need to
be once dealt with not everyone
that lives here thank you.
Thank you Senator Griggs and F.
Sierra.
Thank you Mr chairman Senator
and and Representative.
You guys you guys know my
background so you know I I don't
have a lot of issues with local
options but couple things I want
to I want to find out in in your
bill
on page five we decide we
describe safety maybe manage.
But we all we we we pick out a
few and then we say and other
vehicles are required to meet
certain.
Safety standards established by
order maybe pretty pretty broad
Senator and
I don't.
I don't know that I'd like to do
that as for just allow any
community to to come in and make
up you know whatever.
That needs to be show I would
certainly prefer that to be
tighter on what it is it they
can do the cares
You know there thank you for
staff which any number of things
that
might be applicable today and
not very applicable tomorrow.
Show I'd I'd like to see that
looked at limitation or then
when we go to to page four back
online online twenty three were
talking about if you.
if you've got of a vehicle and
you know the county the county
or the city in order to ask you
that county here there's more
and person registering vehicle
doesn't have for the purpose
okay.
conducting origin maintenance
inspection and the person
registry does so for the purpose
of evading.
The north shore.
Says it works.
So you you come in here and you
get together just this driving
something that's too loud.
And.
How do you know he's of baiting
or not because the only way I
see that that is going to work
if you give him a ticket in you
I don't know how you find out
that he went to Espanola to
register the car instead of
registering Santa any did it for
the purpose of evading your
niche yes taking the court.
And if if people start to get
tired of this board and sure
they get tired of having this
they start going to Espanola
where pitchers.
One of the challenges with
registering vehicles is it takes
a long time some time if you're
buying or selling your call or
you buy a new one and you decide
you want the dealership doing
eight and will okay well that's
another one to what if the
dealership instead of sending it
to the.
The registration outfitting
Santa Fe station that to
Albuquerque they should because
they get it done faster because
in in Alamogordo.
To Rocha desert fashion
Cloudcroft at fast food from
sometimes ation the.
All right I think you need to
look at hello you think that's
going to work the case is you're
gonna wind up with a lot of
people in municipal court and
you're trying to prove something
that I don't know to prove to
begin with that they did it
purposely I think you need to
look at that.
In the and I want you to go back
or to go back page two investors
this is.
The existing all.
On on page seventeen you're
gonna see word interventions
reasonable.
And I believe we were just
talking in the bill just moments
ago and Senator I believe that
for sure this to work you
brought up in and there it is
right there again and show.
While we're while we're dressing
Spain's we might think about
addressing that so here's center
there those are those are my
comments I might I might help
you it spans the bill but I'm
I'm not sure where I'm going
with this afternoon and and I
appreciate I appreciate those
lessons and I certainly think
looking at page five language
stating that a language up on
the.
The breadth of the inspection I
would know that the reasonable
grounds deals with the stolen or
embezzled vehicle self doesn't
it's existing and I appreciate
that I.
From Senator.
Being online I just I also will
say I had some fun earlier in
the session reminding some of my
colleagues that the language
that they were now amending is
the language of the amended two
years ago in the bill.
It was come around every.
Thanks and.
And and thank you.
Councilman.
Thank you Senator Kernan thank
you very much Mr chairman thank
you and not be surprised to
learn that even and Hobbs New
Mexico we have a noise issue and
it's it's amazing during the
night and I live quite a few
blocks from the main
thoroughfare but I can hear that
noise through the skylight and I
just got a text from mine and I
she's watching with us watches
Class say so I'm not gonna go
down that road that.
Yeah.
We do have that but I'm curious
it just Albuquerque Mister
chairman Senator it did they
check for emissions as well or
just.
Well this so.
Mr chair Senator it's just
emissions so there is you know
we do have there's a statewide
there is a noise ordinance
statewide there's a penalty for
that and then local governments
also have individual ordinances
you heard about the counselors
here.
But in terms of inspection the
one thing that's being inspected
is for air and that's under the
air quality act from effort
that's right we we gave we gave
private we we allow the local
government there.
Thank you Mr chair this doesn't
it this one included mission
system strictly state.
So wise and safety when you talk
about
No worries for safety maybe
that's why I'm not a and.
So I'm Mr chairman thank we're
just trying to give the most
flexibility I think for the
reasons that have been brought
up by your colleagues to your
right the inspection the
inspection component of this you
may be far more controversial
than the noise piece and so I
think you could very very easily
see a local government saying
we're we're we're going to
target the noise that's what
we're gonna do we're not gonna.
You know moved to the inspection
so just give them a choice so
Mister chairman Senator going K.
five when you talk about the I
guess the maintenance or safety
issue regard windshields
mirrors.
Places that are covered which
that's a safety issue because
many times they're trying to
protect their identity but none
of those things are included in.
The city's.
Reasons that you could be pulled
over so if you have a broken
windshield this would not give
it forty PM there law
enforcement's not enforcing this
from that perspective are
correct so I mean I think that
to the extent that there is an
existing I think this is this
it's similar to noise so there
is an existing organs you can be
pulled over for one of these
cars with noise for if you've
got a broken windshield and that
violates a local for a state I
do think that they can pull you
over even now even now so but
this is this is this is just the
inspection piece of it so I'm
not I'm not we're not adding
penalties your tier we were
you're pretty sure that you
could be pulled over for for
those things certainly a broken
tail light things like that we
know that I guess I'm a little
concerned about adding
additional.
Reasons for pulling a car over
there because we sure get since
we have major issues that one
thing leads to another just just
throwing that out for that
and it's not mandatory so as
city or county can do whatever
they want.
And
do we have met left we don't
have now in Santa Fe places
where you can go
to to have the inspection done
could there is committee
vehicles registered in Santa Fe
Santa Fe County right now.
Mr I don't know the answer time
frame Mr chair where you can
have seventy thousand car show
up over short period of time and
have everybody in compliance so
Mister chair and I think that's
exactly the issue the local
government will address and that
this is gonna work and so
there's going to need to be an
education piece and a time frame
and.
You know hopefully just if the
local government did move
forward by passing this you can
get a whole bunch of people are
going to get the monthly fixed
versus taking and failing the
inspection and and go in that
direction so I mean inspection
is still going to be there but
again.
The details will be designed if
a local government moves forward
and I'm happy to work on a floor
amendment to add.
County if you'd like me to.
Thank you thanks
okay that's all I have Mister
thank you to Senator Tallman.
Thank you Mr thank you Senator
for this forward as well as the.
Representative.
I guess I'm confused it is there
is there not a statewide noise
ordinance.
Mr chair I believe there is a
statewide noise annoys us.
So the major portion of what
you're trying to do is to reduce
noise.
So how would this.
Improve service so Mister chair
and here's the big difference
right now if you're cited for
allowing vehicle you pay a fine.
And you move on the point here
is we're trying to stop this and
actually inspection you would be
required to fix Mr chair in
order in order to get the car to
car licensed in that area you
would need to go to the
inspection passed the issue and
fix the issue I mean that's the
problem with the current.
Penalty system is it.
It's not it's not stopping the
problem.
Thank you thank you Mr chairman
and having lived in this sixty
seven different states I find
law enforcement.
Is a very lax here so you show
me a place which is endorsed as
lecture shown in places Lara
violations so.
I drive Academy every day
sometimes three times a day
speed limits forty five people
consistently going sixty five
miles an hour I've never once in
fifteen years seen anybody
stopped there we consistently
see people driving around the
license plate numbers
experienced that before used to
drive my son's not.
Before you moved to Phoenix AZ
he's not bothered about it
anymore some of.
sources go next Judiciary Mr
chair Senator yes from where
they can correct so what you of
college can correct some of the
profits.
Mr chair I appreciate the
suggestions that I've been given
and I think those are good ones
is to look at some of the
language right now I'll probably
support this issue because it's
not mandatory for this.
With the five.
Big supporter of local
government when I was a manager
always hated the state mandating
stuff so.
The redeeming feature of this
so.
So what I one last question Mr
chair in the bottom of page two
of the.
The fires to.
This requirements the cost of
the spending counties will be
the center of the program
development.
For instance the legislation
allows for exclusions vehicle
types in your mouth with the.
Those are the challenge that the
seven one.
I have a problem.
Mr chairman I think we take this
one step at a time but again it
seems to me that that being able
first of all there's already a
program that is in Bernalillo
Albuquerque on NBC's been
dealing with that and I just
think that you know if the if
this moves forward and and and
the city elects to proceed an
issue I will certainly discuss
with the local government is
making sure that at the state
level we give the state the time
to put the plan together here
because it's got to work in
conjunction and and make sure
the resources are here to be
able to do the I. T. work to put
that program in place but it's
premature to.
You know the trying to guess
exactly what that looks like
because again I don't know that.
The other local governments are
you gonna use that so it just
this would just give them a tool
to do it.
So this is just what I am going
is live in Santa Fe with huge
problems occur.
Will
A lot of complaints and it's
amazing how far when the
atmosphere's conditions are
right only.
That noise sometimes of almost a
mile.
It is a big.
I
appreciate and understand why
people are so upset about the
north thank you Mr chair thank
you again for bring this for you
Senator a.
Lopez.
Thank you Mr chairman
I have just a couple of
questions to ask and I know it's
not in the legislation itself
but when we talk about local
government implementing what
about the age of the vehicle
right.
a lot of the problems I know in
my own community self only of
Albuquerque we have a lot of
residents who have older cars.
Some of them are loud most of
the ones that we Hill R. that
allows ones are the the younger
generations to the donuts at the
intersections.
you know that's just really the
last schooling it would make
those those turns whether
burning rubber and such that
happens in our community a lot.
there lot of where the big
trucks.
So those those big duly trucks
those groups now these are the
ones that they hold K. and stuff
with their really loud sometimes
to that drive down in my
neighborhood.
And.
I guess you know so I ask about
the age of the vehicle.
what about what this could this
be extended to motorcycles.
This is so Mr chair Senator
Lopez I think the answer is yes
my sense I don't have the depth
is right for me but vehicle I
think would include I assume
there's a definition the code I
can look at that I do want to
point out on page four at the
top section Hey online three
through six the ordinance may
exempt or exclude certain
categories or classifications of
vehicles and may exempt or
excluded vehicle because of age
or type of vehicle so there's no
question for the same the same
issue
You know with some older
vehicles I think.
Again that can be addressed and
needs to be addressed I mean
that discussion needs to happen
as part of the local ordinance
yeah and Mr chairman so I have
sat there lot of Harley Davidson
persons in my neighborhood of
the to have a loud sound when
they're driving which I
personally like to hear
but is yeah there's there's some
of these other variances which
is not stated here but then when
you take it to local government
it depends of what a community
are going to be in
and who's who's making the
decisions US city councilor
County commission level.
you know and and we talk about
Mrs vehicle noise for safety
inspections of course the table
is open for them to do.
If they choose to do both I
really think it's a burden on
certain communities.
in the state.
It'll be a burden on my
community.
And if you refuse based on if
you have a broken tail light
which officers to stop you if
they see a suspicion I mean it
happens
if you have a broken windshield
which I've driven around
sometimes with a cracked
windshield and driving around
thank you.
There's there's other things
that do come up.
The intense may be good but for
me the concern Mr chairman is
how it's implemented with local
government.
and for me Mr chairman it I
think.
Could be used against maybe
lower income communities don't
have readily available
opportunity to fix their cars.
I have cars in my neighborhood
my own neighborhood where they
can't afford six.
And they drive but they have to
go to work we're working class
neighborhood.
And there are certain variances
in other parts of town where
maybe they don't have as many
opportunities and granted our
city council in Albuquerque is
pretty amenable but I'm just
curious as to how this would be
used in other communities.
Yes Santa Fe has one side of
town and some have the south
side of town where is going to
be implemented and what.
those who have Harley still to
save on one side of town they
live in many different parts
those who drive big trucks which
are very noisy diesel trucks to.
At diesel trucks.
When I sit at your to get my
money out of the credit union I
can't hear because the diesel
next to me is blast in this huge
noise and they don't want to you
turn the car off their truck off
because of the noise factor and
those are very noisy as they
drive through my community also.
So for me Mr chairman of granted
is just classic counties it
doesn't affect smaller
communities but for me in my
area have concerns.
So I just wanted to address that
Mr Mr chairman because I just.
City councillors and county
commissioners change ordinances
can change it result we've also
had in my neighborhood
ordinances dealing with
you know how was state
neighborhood associations.
Meditation is with regards to
access for no smoking.
availability right a certain
shops selling of liquor I mean
there's all these different
types of things that affect and
I think a matter of I think you
just have to have caution with
this Mr chair I think the intent
is good.
but I really have some concerns
because I I would.
Not wanted to see one
neighborhood versus another
because of the differences and I
I know in my neighborhood there
would be self thank you.
well I haven't but I've got a
question just for clarification
on the.
On page four were is no on the
number of first paragraph Class
a county or municipal within a
more establishment for safety
maintenance and specs and
ordinance so what that so that
is passed.
Then you're going to ask every
person in that count as a
vehicle to go to inspection.
Is that what the question was
whether there's capacity to do
that was a so Mister chair I
think I think that's going to be
determined by how the ordinances
is put graph that in place as of
right but I'm and then again
conceivably that could that
could be the scope but there's
also you know a whole bunch of
exceptions that are provided for
in here in terms of how it's of
how it's put together so I just
wanted to cover because I think
when Senator Brandt was asking
about you're at now you're
asking people to.
No pay fees to go to all this or
or yeah you know for all
everybody that owns a vehicle of
mine issue read in New Mexico
for was maybe just for those
that are violation be increased
the penalties but not
necessarily making everybody go
through well Mr chair now I I
think I want to be clear it's
its whatever the local
government decides so it's
different than because right now
we have a situation where it's
just a penalty.
It pulled over you get a ticket
you know this basically would
require an inspection process
and depending I mean there's you
can see the language you're
right on top of page four
paragraph may it provides that
the ordinance can simple exclude
categories of vehicles so yeah
okay not appreciate that and
then the yeah I know I I stay in
Santa Fe hotel and so the same
thing you know like to agree to
morning Haidle poll that going
on the street I would walk up
and start looking at what was
going on with the.
As of a recent down so yeah you
know stand in your and I think
No leave it to class a those
urban areas that you know.
So from this a lot more but I
also understand you know Senator
Lopez is concerned so that the
what is it a pleasure the
committee.
A movie pass motion with the
best of second.
Ocean my worth.
Second by Senator Hamblen.
Okay the growth Senator Brandt
Representative Senator Griggs I
just.
The path.
Huge Senator Kernan.
Senator Lopez.
Senator Sanchez.
I just.
Senator Wirth.
Pass yes get full.
I'm sorry Senator Tallman.
Senator Hamblen yes.
Senator Griggs.
No explain more about.
Senator Kernan.
Government.
Representative Ezzell.
Our next.
If we can do a no brick yeah can
I make a substitute motion.
The okay thank you for your you
can make more I just make a note
grants to tradition.
The
Stewart.
State of Oregon.
The supersede enough that yes is
supersede right.
So I mean I think technically
you probably need to take the
vote on the do you pass and then
make a substitute motion motion
if that fails.
Okay now.
Sierra right.
Senator sent to.
No experiment with.
Senator Tallman.
Able to test before just
one and I'm sorry it was
senator.
Taking these north of the
border.
You already voted.
No it to get the will of these
key New Mexico yes chairman is.
And the Senator Shendo yes.
If three yeses and all the rest
now for for.
Yet for was a test yes I have a
common Wirth New Mexico Senator
Hamblen I didn't write it down
I'm so sorry it's a type of four
two was number five point.
Two three four five so now I
think there's a substitute
motion if you want to make a
substitute for the options they
want to put.
As of the moment knowing what
could be an option for ensuring
the judicial we need to explain
okay so that we're going to
substitute let's have the two
German explainable.
Thank you for sure I just wanted
to first of all the opportunity
but we should've Lopez once but.
At the at the same time research
and I do believe cities have
noise ordinances and may be the
thing that would work with some
of that is if we do believe that
no wages is really the issue
let's look at what the.
Family can be for excessive
noise and may be changed that
and maybe you get the same
result without having to go
through the shop thank you Mr.
If.
Mr chair Senator
I could probably have voted yes
but
Where I am from where I'm at in
my area if you know if I would
hate to see someone come up and
testify from the ranch and the
muffler's draggin because I just
came from checking cattle and
they get a ticket to come in
support of bill or do something
to me and it is depending on
what the local government does
but if they do do that so.
We'll go on to the next will.
R. as in no reputation to to
share with no Representative
motion to have second for the
second by Senator AUMENT.
The roll Senator Representative
though Senator Griggs.
Is.
Yes descended the judiciary.
Senator Kernan yes I'm sorry
your kind of movie percent yes
Senator Lopez.
Senator Senator.
Yes.
Senator Thomas yes Senator Wirth
yes Senator Hamblen yes Senator
Shendo yes.
So what can I do that as well by
the coalition of the bill.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
members of thank you
Representative right.
Okay we can have Senator souls
are you on the other here good.
Senate bill forty five children
were grown couple he from credit
so.
I thank you Mr chairman.
I just wonder whether loud
mufflers an oxymoron but.
Yeah.
For.
All right Senator says this is
having to do it tax credits we
can hear it will not take any
action.
Mr chair and
this is the same bill that you
all heard last year that got
rolled into the discussion about
the omnibus tax credit one there
was also a solar tax credit they
are very very similar it makes
the credit refundable so that it
is available to people of all
income level it's the same one I
would hope that this committee
would also put this into that
staff is you're looking at the
various tax credits that are
being proposed this is for
geothermal ground coupled heat
pumps
in the past they have been
relatively inefficient the new
generation of heat pumps are
incredibly efficient they use
way less energy to heat and cool
homes than traditional they are
been relatively slow on the
uptake lots of that because
moving energy seems magical we
all know when we turn to the gas
on it we see a place where the
heat is coming from we know when
we have water dripping over
something we know where the
calls coming from heat pumps are
just moving the Energy not
generating the energy but they
are incredibly efficient and I
would hope this committee would
include this as a very seriously
into your whatever you're on the
bus tax credit bill is this year
and I'll stand for questions
right okay before we go on to
the committee for questions of
up to the audience of those are
in favor of the Senate bill of.
On the Senator one of forty six
forty five.
But.
yeah you can just come up in the
make it quick.
That old but.
Thank you senator Shendo

three minutes too long as it I
try Senate bill forty six.
From four to four closure
protection act.
Senator do it are you able to
go.
Do it Senator introduce you bill
thank you Mr chair members of
the committee this bill would
create the wrongful foreclosure
protection act.
We have a tsunami of
foreclosures coming towards us
and as anyone who has read the
paper basically since two
thousand eight now is there is
an unfortunate trend months
mortgage servicers especially to
centrally not play fair when
they are seeking to foreclose on
on on on the Mexican homeowners
I'm really homeowners across the
nation but but we felt it here
as much as anywhere
I was a consumer protection
attorney for a number of years
before I.
Got here hospital lot of time
suing banks and mortgage
servicers and and actually spent
ten years working on the case
trying to make a claim for
wrongful foreclosure and failed
I would became real clear was
that we needed to we need to
actually amend our statute in
order to address this problem
which unfortunately despite the
fact that.
We see both things like Wells
Fargo.
penalize for in class action
suits every couple months the
behaviors don't change so and
and here everywhere but
especially here in New Mexico
someone's home is likely the
largest asset they're ever going
on and one of the cornerstones
of their financial stability so
we want to make sure that if
someone is being foreclosed upon
basically that they are treated
fairly and that they get
accurate representations from
the folks who are are seeking to
forclose and that.
If they're not treated fairly
there's some recourse for the
and so to that end we have this
bill I have here with me Kevin
Holmes who is fantastic consumer
protection attorney in
Albuquerque and he knows a heck
of a lot more about this stuff
and I do so I will defer to him
to explain the bill and we are I
we look forward to the
discussion.
I'm sorry Mr chair before you go
I do want to mention that Mr
Holmes has been talking with
John Anderson and Chris Moran
the folks who represent the
bankers association community
bankers association my
understanding is that they have
not identified any specific
concerns about this bill that
that they're just we're having a
and general open dialogue with
them because we want to make
sure that the changes we make
here I don't have negative
impacts especially our community
banks and and on the smaller
communities in New Mexico where
there might only be one bank
there who's who's do mortgage
lending to that community so I
just want to make you aware that
those conversations are are
happening as well thank you.
Go ahead Mr chair Senators thank
you for allowing me to speak my
name's Kevin Holmes on the
consumer protection attorney in
Albuquerque and I'm also an
adjunct professor of law at the
UNM School law I teach trial
practice civil depositions and
the men invited guest speaker on
areas of consumer protection and
consumer finance.
And like senator do again her
past life sometimes I to
mortgage banks and more
importantly their servicers for
full closure of years in
mitigated foreclosure cases and
I'm here to talk to you about
the structure of the wrongful
foreclosure protection act tell
you some stories about cases
I've had and why this act is a
good fit to stop this kind of
behavior and explain to you why
the current law that we have in
New Mexico that we think
protects people against these
kind of abuses does not.
To do that first I think the
poor we understand some of the
basics of for closure because
it's my experience even people
with mortgages I understand how
that works ultimately for
closure is the process by which
somebody who.
Has a loan that secures property
gets that property sold to pay
off the loan.
One a lot of people don't
realize though in the context of
mortgage foreclosures is at the
amount of money that the banks
and servicers pursuant
foreclosure isn't just the long.
That fees that costs that their
own attorney's fees they
sometimes falsify what we call
property preservation fees and
additional monies they claim are
necessary to collect from the
house and if the amount of money
owed on the loan with those fees
at the end of the for closures
more than the house sells for.
They have every legal right to
go after the homeowner directly
to take the rest of that money
out of their pockets garnish
your wages and sell everything
they have.
So why we have a structure to
this bill when we we have is
simple.
Thanking and mortgages are
highly regulated around the
country by a series of state and
federal laws up to the point of
foreclosure.
And that's because foreclosures
a creature of state law not
federal law and there are no
federal statutes on the books
that governs the process for for
closure and said each individual
state promulgates or statutes
and rules which means in order
to protect people in the
foreclosure process the only
thing we can do is ask you all
to pass a bill directed to the
foreclosure process and that's
what the wrongful foreclosure
protection act notice here it it
is directed only at the
foreclosure process it's not
about pre servicing it's not
about what happens after it's
not about the statements in the
bills it's just the foreclosure
process and that's on purpose to
narrowly tailor the legislation
to the problems I've seen.
The reason.
We've structure this bill the
way we have is really two fold
one.
Senator for sure research by the
future table foundation study in
twenty eighteen and twenty
twenty indicates that somewhere
upwards of seventy five percent
of debt collection lawsuits
filed in state courts including
for closures go to the full
judgment.
Meeting the debtor never answers
and never contests the validity
of the claims by the the credit
company or the bank and it's
just rubber stamped by judge and
what that means is that if
there's an incorrect
representation in the lawsuit in
foreclosure and it goes to
default judgment that incorrect
representation of the amount
owed how old the loan is and
whether it's enforceable whether
the person even has a mortgage
in the first place.
Gets transferred over to the
default judgment entered against
the person.
Second.
We see are an extraordinary of
wide category of
misrepresentations and abuses in
mortgage foreclosures and I'll
tell you some of the the
highlights of my particular
career in this area here in a
bit but it is astounding the
kinds of things that happen to
people in foreclosure cases the
least of which is that the banks
and servicers simply cannot or
choose not to really keep track
of people's mortgage payments in
the amount of.
No one thing I didn't mention
that I think it's important to
understand I use the term banks
pretty loosely here.
Because the overwhelming
majority of mortgages
underwritten and initiate in
this country now actually put
out by non bank entities they
are not New Mexico bank and
trust their rocket mortgage
quicken loans their loan depot
dot com.
And the majority of the
activities that I complain about
in that that are addressed in
the wrongful foreclosure
protection act actually
activities done by what are
called servicers which is a
corporation that assists the
loan holder and collecting
payments and going to for
closure and is truly the
servicers were the primary
problem in this industry and the
individuals most directly
pointed at by this legislation.
The bill has three components it
has a list of specific
disclosures that have to be put
in place in the complaint at the
time the lawsuit is filed.
It has a prohibition on
misrepresentations and
omissions.
And has a requirement to inform
the consumer the homeowner the
the target of the shoot of the
possibility that if the loan is
too old to be enforced in state
court that it can't be.
And they can't and shouldn't be
tricked into making a payment on
it.
And there's an important reason
for that we call this zombie
that.
There's a time limit to enforce
defaulted that we called the
statute of limitations once that
period of time runs that that
doesn't technically disappear.
You just can't sue in court to
enforce it.
What.
If you trick someone.
In the voluntarily making a
payment even ten dollars on that
otherwise unenforceable that it
comes back to life and that's
what we call somebody that.
So.
The.
I think and Mr chair I think
this homes some of the the real
life examples that you've seen
chair of what what this it would
be going towards would probably
be helpful I can do that let's
talk to storage we give you some
more stories you know mine and
we'll talk about why.
One story I think can be
sufficient sure okay this one
yes all right.
What we may not understand is
that sometimes.
Mortgage banks will file for
closure on a house but the the
mortgage language if they
foreclose on is based on the the
legal description of the home as
opposed to the street address
that is action the mortgage
documents and so if there's a
legal description error for
example if your neighbor's house
is actually the one that's
behind but they file the
paperwork to forclose and they
put your legal description.
In place instead the fall
foreclosure and take your house
I represented a client who had
two houses one she owned and
when she rented out her husband
she were both legally blind.
And her husband took out a loan
on the rental property in order
to support his piano tuning
business and then he died.
And this is at the height of the
beginning the foreclosure crisis
the bank sued losure and
presented her with paperwork
allowing her to obtain a
judgment where she wouldn't have
to any extra money they would
just take the house.
And even though the mortgage was
on the house next door the legal
description that presented to
her the sign was both houses.
And as a result they took both
houses and she didn't find out
about this and tell the realtor
came and knocked on her door and
said I'm here to see the houses
that are for sale.
She contacted me I figured out
exactly what happened and I
wrote a letter to bank America
saying this is a legal
description area clearly have
two houses here but the mortgage
is only on one and their
response back was.
Every party to a contract as a
duty to read the document they
told me the blind lady should a
read the paperwork she signed
and we're not obligated to do
anything it took me a year and a
half a litigation to convince
them to give her her house back.
And ultimately the the strength
of the laws available were not
enough to adequately compensate
her for what she.
And if I may I'd like to address
some of the analysis by our fine
staff folks here at the
roundhouse on this particular
bill and particularly the
suggestion that there already
protections in place at that
address is going to be a for.
We know that New Mexico has a
relatively strong law on the
books called the unfair trade
practices act that was a bill
passed primarily aimed at
misrepresentations by door to
door salespeople and things like
that.
We've tried to say it also
applies to debt collection but
there are some fundamental
problems line the U. PA that
collection.
One.
If the person you're attempting
to collect the debt against
doesn't actually over the debt
they're not a consumer under the
terms of the unfair trade
practices act which means they
cannot bring a plan.
In this case on a Cessna.
Because if you weren't part of
the misleading transaction the
started it you can't ever sue if
you're later pursued for
somebody else's that.
There's also a requirement in
the unfair trade practices act
at the agency representation be
knowing.
And that makes sense for you
talk about a car dealer who was
the condition of the car and you
can figure out what he knew and
what he didn't know but when
you're talking about a mortgage
bank and multiple levels of
servicers all of who have
different information and none
of them who have complete
information about the to look at
it you can't ever prove.
What they only together which
means it's virtually impossible
to meet that knowing
misrepresentation requirement of
the project there's also
requirements under the U. PA
that in order to make a claim
for damages you have to have
lost money or property.
And so if they take your house.
But then they give it back.
You have no claims.
The biggest concern I have in
cases like this is not the basis
where I'm called in the help
ones on.
People don't know how to get
older lawyer can't afford one no
listen to them and I and I think
about what what happened in that
case if I hadn't gone involved.
We have the fair debt collection
practices act on the books it's
a it's a comprehensive debt
collection statute.
Back in the bad old days a
twenty ten it was used to trying
to push some of this back but
there's been an evolution the
long the last two years that
really matters.
In twenty seventeen the United
States Supreme Court case of
Henson V. Santander consumer.
Held that if that was not in
default at the time the debt
collector.
Then the FDCPA will never apply
and what that means is is that
if the servicer servicing the
lawn in the homeowners making
payments and then the homeowner
falls behind on their payments
and the servicer does any number
of abusive things because the
service or started out in a good
relationship with the homeowner.
The FDCPA but actual practice
act never applies to that
servicer.
And then in twenty nineteen in
the case of Tuskegee McCarthy
hole fix the United States
Supreme Court held.
That the enforcement of a
mortgage to see someone's house
and a non judicial foreclosure
sale and sell it is not debt
collection.
It's the enforcement of a
security instrument I don't know
the actual difference between
those and most scholars don't
but that is the holding that
taking someone's house to sell
it to collect that is not debt
collection and so the FDCPA does
not help us in these cases the
statue limitations for that law
is only one year and so if you
have folks who've been in the
middle of a fight with the banks
for many years and they finally
get help it's too late and Mr
chair will I I know you all have
have been here for a long time
before we a go to public comment
or questions of committee on
very briefly tell you the way
that I got into this consumer
protection work I was doing a
lot of wrongful death work and I
kept seen over and over again
that when someone would die I
these marketers would swoop in
and do it be is very shady
foreclosures very quickly and
that the more I dug into it the
more I found out that at least
with Wells Fargo it was a
company policy that when your
when a homeowner Dyess target
that house target that morning
family.
For for closure
we had a winter rise ation in
July we had blatant Mr they
would just line say you owe us
forty thousand dollars when
actually they owed the is like
three hundred I mean the it I
was I would not believe how
believe these abuses are had I
not seen the myself but they
they've been happening for years
and and sadly they they continue
to happen.
And if that will what will get
us.
That that's our our presentation
Mr chair.
Okay thank you up.
Already before we go to the
committee will to audience
anybody in favor of of.
Senate bill forty six.
Chair members if you just set up
here in a speak to the Mike so
that the folks of.
You're listening can also hear
appreciate that thank you.
Mr chair members of the
committee hold a button there's
a button.
Doing this all wrong there you
go here ma'am it not only us but
everybody else can Mr chair
members of the committee and my
name is is about Lopez and I'm a
student intern for Juliana
Cooper and I'm speaking here
today on behalf of New Mexico
trial lawyers lawyers
association and we offer our
support for the bill
it's.
to broaden the rights and
protections for New Mexico
homeowners particularly those
who are facing foreclosure due
to predatory practices by
mortgage lenders and New Mexico
farmers should deserve and be
ensured that
They are offered the opportunity
with this bill so thank you.
Thank you.
They also the audience.
We have anybody in opposition.
But we are
not in opposition this well just
to.
The bikes are I'm so sorry to
self.
As told the staff I think thirty
on okay Mr chairman and members
the committee I just want to
reiterate reiterate.
yes I'm John Anderson with the
New Mexico bank association and
we've been working with that
that the sponsor this bill for a
few days and we have a few
concerns we totally understand
what the intent is and I just
wanted to call the fence of the
committee that we are in
discussions and they're very
friendly and hopefully those
things that seem to be of some
concern to us we can basically
come to some conclusion not the
I might say that one of the
things that I think it's very
important for you to to
reiterate here that what had
just been discussed here there
are fewer and fewer banks that
are in basically in this
business the mortgage business
is basically evaporated in the
main for many of our banks and
and one thing that we're trying
to do is to make sure their
heart we don't lose more
participants so with that I just
I don't have anything else to
say I just want to thank the
sponsor for willingness to work
with this thank you thank you.
Right with that will go to the
committee.
The.
No it was the.
All right Senator X..
Thank you Mr chairman as and
thank you Senator I mean I'm I'm
interested to to hear that Mr
Anderson doesn't have a whole
lot of problems with fish
exactly which is still working
fine you know transaction which
stuff out because I'm in this
thing to me.
While there's a lot of stuff in
here that is.
Issues something I mean
especially when you go into the
civil remedies park were there
and it when you top for you get
actual damage and including
come.
Compensatory consequential and
incidental and the yet statutory
damages on top of that and
community damages on top of that
and then caution reasonable
attorney's fees and then in job
do declaratory and other relief
I don't know where that New
Mexico in the law right now but
that looks like a a big a big
deal if you if you are a lawyer.
And it looks to me like it gives
you an opportunity to to start
looking.
For.
Instances where something could
have happened are you talking in
here about
Misleading statements made for
all and and written and the only
way you're going to deal with
oral appears in court.
Kasia Mr chairman and you guys I
don't I don't see how you.
You know and you're talking
about staff that who knows when
it occurred
it looks to me like in the in
the testimony
some of the Asian shares were
brought up or specific instances
it may even be credible.
In their actions.
And would be able to be
approached differently and.
Not meeting this I
I don't know I don't I don't
think I made exactly ready to
support this just because of the
age.
Its over arching brought.
And then when you even in
section section I don't I don't
know which for some I've seen
this
Mr chair and in center
And get me started on the issue
should for section G. either.
What we talk about liberal
interpretation worried should be
liberally construed
and that that may be common may
not be.
I don't remember that and that
looks like that gives.
That puts the means of the
Plainfield huge.
Way imbalanced.
In just a additional medical.
And.
What you have today when you go
try to borrow.
On on anything
The mortgages are not
negotiable.
When you see the receive the
documents really oversight over
you're not you're not going to
negotiate this term in the
middle of this morning somewhere
Nobody our state the wadis
probably somebody that reach
every term in those standard for
mortgages presented by every
lender.
I just I mean I don't know how
many there to wait more about
the shore stuff
and and wait until this gets
through Judiciary if it goes
there she what in the world
comes out of the but it just
looks to me like it's it's way
too big and I just I'm not rich
supported today show thank you
Mr and senator thank you guys.
The intentions right
that.
I just I just can't get my head
around so thank you for sure
that.
Great thank rigs Senator Brett.
Mr chairman of service to real
quick question Mr I keep hearing
these advertisements about help
people put liens on your home
basically instead of identity
theft that's home.
Point the aft does this do
anything to protect anyone who
gets that.
Mr chair Senator all defer to
Mister Holmes on that because I
have I don't know maybe you know
what I'm talking about Mr Holmes
I think I do Mr chair Center we
we have a long the books called
the lead protection efficiency
act and that is primarily
directed at preventing people
from putting in proper liens on
people's homes it provides
remedies including actual
damages statutory attorney's
fees real similar to those
available here this is only.
Actions related to the
prosecution of foreclosure so
somebody puts a lien on your
house incorrectly and then never
does anything in court on it.
This act in the retention.
Thank you.
I'm gonna keep looking at this
I'm not raise support today
either it does concern me
I I I'm really trying to be
careful not to do any more here
in Richmond bills and so it
concerns me but I also concerns
me
I know and the Wells Fargo thing
I actually look back at my wife.
With that because my mother in
law passed away in August my
father in law's on hospice and
my wife's the sole survivor
she's she's an only child and so
we're trying to work on making
sure so I think their mortgages
through Wells Fargo so we may be
talking to you very soon.
So so I appreciate that warning
because we're going to you know
keep up with that on these there
has to be though a lapse of
payment right they can't just
come and try to forclose if the
payments are up to date is that
correct Mr chairman Senator
Brandt any violation of the
terms of the mortgage contract
can lead to a foreclosure the
one thing that hasn't discuss as
we include reverse mortgages in
this bill because those are not
covered by most of the other
bills reverse mortgages
typically carried out by the
elderly most common reason for
for closing on a reverse
mortgage is the resident
allegedly goes off into a
nursing home or times what they
do is they send a letter in a
plane envelope and if the owner
doesn't respond in thirty days
if we're close and so when you
have an elderly person who gets
mail from some bank they never
heard of and they don't even
open it the next thing you know
they find out they're being
foreclosed on and so their
number of conditions that could
lead to foreclosure.
People being a hundred percent
current on the payments and Mr
chair Senator if I might give
you an example from from one
case that I had where
I have a dollar can I just
retain UMass.
You know that this happens I got
John.
We know it so as to this case
that are a decorated police
officers murdered in her home
her her brother who's also a
he's a he's actually in an
undercover narcotics officer in
another state he comes there the
next day he goes over to wells
Fargo's right down the street my
sister's been murdered there
like we know we know her she was
in here all the time it's all
over the news he says what we
why we how are we going to deal
with I can't deal with her house
right I wanna make sure nothing
happens to always gets out what
we need to do they say don't
worry about it we're just gonna
put everything office he says
okay.
Couple months later he goes and
he's picking up the mail and and
nothing was on deposit to now
the property is three months and
default he goes into his Wells
Fargo and he says can I pay you
guys for six months because
we're still dealing with the
stuff they say you can't you
can't pay more than to do but
passed the three months that's
do and that'll get you caught up
says okay take my peers please
take my money.
The.
He should be all paid up at this
point they hold in the suspense
account they do not apply it to
the mortgage that they put a
suspense account the by the way
they can then get all of the
interest or the interest in
aspen to count is pure profit
for them
but they also then go ahead and
for clothes because so then two
months after he's who's being
that payment he thought thinks
they're all paid up he this guy
gets a call from the neighbor
saying they're throwing all your
sister stuff away in a big
dumpster what's going on they
had foreclosed on the house he
never he never knew about it
because about it by then it's
it's five months past due and
they're saying well he's never
contacted us at all when when we
ended up suing them over at
their defense was that this guy
when he gave them the money he
should have specifically written
down for them don't put this in
the suspense account please
apply it to the mortgage so they
blamed the morning is the guy
who's mourning his murdered
sister for not telling them how
to do their job and and so yes
sometimes you're right like
usually there's going to be a
default but there are situations
where there is someone is paid
up and there's this this should
not happen
and it it it does repeatedly
thank you very much appreciate
that thank you Mr chairman thank
you Senator Brandt
Nobody else in the committee.
C..
What we motion for do best way
is Senator everyone.
I would second the motion.
Please follow Senator Brandt the
Senator Griggs.
Senator Kernan now.
Senator.
Madam yes Senator Hamblen
Senator Wirth I'm sorry yes
Senator Hamblen yes Senator
Shendo yes four three two passed
for three thank you Mr
conditioners.
So our last of the
the roll this over a.
Senator Brandt.
His move
from the health care and yes.
All right Senator thank you Mr
chairman this is a very very
simple bill actually this this
bill has huge ramifications
this bill protects disabled
persons from being able from
being discriminated against.
When it comes to organ
transplants now I will say in
New great question by Senator
Griggs sit next to me has this
been an issue in New Mexico
thank god now.
And specific right up front
we've not had this problem in
New Mexico that I know of but it
has happened in other states.
And people who are disabled has
lost their lives.
Because in other states.
They were discriminated against
for organ transplant center.
And only because they were
disabled and the physician for
the transplant.
Decider.
So their life wasn't worth given
the order.
This bill prevents that from
happening in the state.
That's really all the bill does
I actually received a phone call
before I came down committee
today out of the blue didn't
seek it from the National
I just lost it down syndrome
network they had heard about my
bill and wanted to know how they
could help it's become their
number one bill in the nation.
And so they're going to be
sending a letter of support the
next couple days we'll have it
will we'll get it through the
floor and not worry about it
right bring that tomorrow so but
not pollutants are worth on the
spot but the lieutenant
governor's involved in this bill
coach Gonzales for Lobos he has
a daughter with down syndrome
our previous pastor who we call
this bill glories law
personally because her daughter
glory has down syndrome next
test for children with down
syndrome at but glory is the one
that is most at risk and so
we're just trying to prevent.
This from happening in our state
and save lives in our state
thank you Mr chairman that's all
I have thank you for the
audience to.
The bureau of US Senate bill
seventy one.
As amended.
The body both.
If anybody out.
Okay all right now go to
committee
Senator Hamblen.
Thank you Mr chair I I mine's
more of just a comment because I
not able to
are absolutely it the incredible
who have downs and typically
folks who who are living with
that I need a heart transplant.
And and so it it saddens me that
there are other states that have
had to that there are people who
live in other states have had to
experience this you know people
who use a wheelchair and and I
you and I both talked about this
is like putting people first
because it's really about people
who wind up having particular
conditions our abilities and so
it it bothers me that that
number one I'm glad you're doing
this but I'm it also bothers me
that we have to do this because
there's precedent in other
states so mine is more of just a
comment of thank you for
bringing this forward I hope we
never have to have this issue
addressed Mr chairman I guess I
do need to disclose as a
disabled person on this bill
will affect me as well.
And so I I appreciate this and
thank you that's all I have
