I know you're so like, like.
Um, and then we'll, uh, Senator
Stepanic gets here, otherwise
we've got Katie, and we've got
Senator Duhig, uh, here and then
we'll, we'll continue going on
in that order. So, um, Senator
Souls, go ahead, but, but I do
have to don't go ahead actually.
I'm sorry. I'm getting a little
ahead of myself. If you will,
please take the role.
Senator Figueroa.
here,
Senator had a meal.
Senator O'Malley.
Senator Paul.
Senator Ramos.
And the entrance is excused
Senator share.
use
And a verse
is excused Senator Bergman.
Senator Hamble here, we have 7
or 4. All right, we do have a
form. All right, Senator So,
you're free to go.
Thank you, and I won't spend all
10 minutes reading the entire
bill to you because it's not
that complicated, uh, this
comes, uh, it just updates and
modernizes our reimbursement
process when we travel to
interim committees and other
types of things, uh, as many of
you know I fly a small airplane.
However, the reimbursement for
flying a private airplane is in
state law and all the rest of
our reimbursements are based on
federal levels, uh, the state
law has not been updated in well
over 20 years.
for small airplanes, um, as a
result, when I fly and I try and
always circle that I flew my
airplane, but the people doing
it don't always see that and I'm
more than one occasion, I've had
to rewrite a check because they
overpaid because they paid on
the federal level instead of the
state level, which cost a lot of
extra time and and money and
people, essentially what this
bill does is it says that all
reimbursements will be based on
the federal level, so there's
not that confusion. That's what
it does.
All right.
Anybody in the audience in
support of this bill.
So not anybody in the audience
in opposition of this bill.
So none. Anybody online? I.
No? OK.
All right, so now we go to the
committee and any questions or
comments from the committee,
Madam Cha move fast. We have a
pass from Senator Ramos. Are
there any comments or questions
before we go to the Du pass
motion.
Right, we have a, uh, do pass
from Santa Ramos. We have a
second from Senator Adammilo.
Anybody here, uh, in opposition
of the DuPass motion.
seen none, if you will please
record all of.
Uh, present, uh, in the
affirmative. 8 to 0. Thank you,
Madam Chair. I think I still
have about 9 minutes bank you
probably do. Thank you.
Someday we're gonna have to time
a bill presentation.
It was like 40 seconds. All
right, since Senator Stephanics
is not here. Senator, do you
think you ready to go? Thank
you.
Good morning, chair members, um,
we're here on SB 352. I have
here with me our uh the medical
investigators of the state whose
name is?
Good morning members of the
committee and Madam Chair, uh,
I'm Heather, Doctor Heather
Gerald.
Madam chair.
What this bill does is it says
that when there are pictures of
an autopsy, uh, they are not
public records, um, unless they
are for the use or potential use
in a civil or criminal
proceeding, uh, there is an
unfortunate trend happening of
people
up autopsy photos and then
putting them on YouTube, um.
It is, it is gross. It is not
appropriate. And so we are
looking to protect um the
privacy of those individuals and
their families, uh, by creating
this exception, uh, essentially
to Era.
Thank you, medical examiner. Do
you want to say anything?
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. 3 quick
points. New Mexico is one of few
states where autopsy photos are
not protected. 2, the requests
for autopsy photos is
increasing, as well as they are
posting on the internet, and
number 3, autopsy photos are
retained by the Office of the
Medical Investigator in
perpetuity as forensic evidence
and are available for civil and
criminal proceedings
normal procedure of subpoena
request by attorney legal.
Or legal counsel. Thank you.
All right. Thank you so much.
And so Senator, do you think if
we do have public testimony,
you'll have 5 minutes to respond
to that, uh, in the audience is
there by show of hands, anybody
in support of this legislation.
Recorded none. Anybody in the
audience in opposition of this
legislation.
Recording none, anybody else.
All right.
So you, we've got you online.
We're gonna go ahead and just,
uh, here, if you will, one
minute.
If you'll unmute yourself,
please.
And you'll get a 32nd warning in
your chat.
Go ahead.
OK. Thank you very much. My name
is Soil Campos Biggs. I'm a
social worker. I'm also the
chief policy advisor at the
Albuquerque Police Department.
I'm grateful to the sponsor and
to Doctor Heather Gerrell for
bringing this legislation to you
all today. I think it's an
important, easy, and good way to
protect.
People, I think it is also
particularly important to us for
high profile victims of crime.
So thank you for bringing this
up in APD supports this
legislation. All right. Thank
you so much.
All right, now we go to the
committee for any questions or
comments from the committee.
Senate sheriff.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
So
Madam June Senator.
Pictures have been around a very
long time.
In a state for 113 years.
Why today?
Madam Chasen, so I think what we
are seeing happen today that
probably didn't happen in the
past, is people getting
obtaining these autopsy photos,
and then posting them online for
their own commercial benefit.
And Sandra.
commercial benefit.
Some managers under, so YouTube
channels that that post the and
we see this happening in all
sorts of areas, not, not just
with autopsy photos, but there
are whole YouTube channels that
are
R
That all of their content is
just law enforcement stuff that
they have read, um, and that is
That was how they, they make
money on that channel is by by
posting this stuff and, and also
posting things like uh autopsy
photos.
So Madame Chair and Senator
autopsy photos are the purple.
Madam chair senator, yes, that's
what we're trying to, to fix
with this.
I'm sure I'm, I'm, I'm just
Surprised that
That this is even
issue.
Also surprised that we have
people that are sick enough to
want to do that. Well, I'm not.
OK. All right. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Sheriff. Any
other questions?
What is the will of the
committee?
We have a new pass from Senator
Sanchez. We have a second from
Senator Figueroa.
Anybody in opposition of the Du
Past motion?
see none, if you will, please
record all in attendance and.
support of the dupe.
By the way, doctor, thank you
for all the work that you've
done on, on the, the gene hack
is very trying for all of us.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Many members.
All right. So we have um Senator
O'Malley, are you, are you ready
to go?
Or I see Senator Pinto in the
back of Senator Pinto wants to
go, would you like that? Yes,
thank you. I'm waiting for
someone. Thank you.
All right, Senator Pinto, this
is your first time in the
committee, so I want to go ahead
and give you the, the lowdown,
um, on this. Uh, what we will do
is, um, have 10 minutes for your
presentation. That also includes
your expert, and then we will go
to public comment.
Uh, if there is public comment,
you will have 5 minutes to
respond to that public comment
before we go to the committee.
You're ready to go.
Thank you, Madam Chair. We have
Senate Bill 413, which seeks to
increase the statutory cap on
differential rate investments
from the severance tax permanent
fund in the New Mexico private
equity funds.
And businesses from the current
11% to
14%, um, and I have with me the
former Senator Shannon Robinson,
and we probably might have
Caroline McCrosson, who's also
the economic development
director of the city of
Albuquerque, and we stand for
questions.
are you saying that um Carolyn
was online.
Madam Chairman, uh,
She is the daughter.
Of Eric McCrosson.
Who unfortunately, in terms of
timing is being buried today.
Her whole family is down.
Uh, at, at the, the
site to, to have his funeral and
burial. OK, so she's not here
today. She's not here today. I
can call her.
If, if, if we need to hear from
her as well. She's very
supportive of this.
Because she is aware of what's
happening with
Scientists who are
losing their contracts and jobs
at Sandiaia Kirkland and Los
Alamos.
All right. Thank you so much.
Uh, anything else further on the
bill before we go to public
testimony, Senator.
All right, by show of hands, is
there anybody in the audience
that's in support of this
legislation?
See no, is there anybody in the
audience in opposition of this
legislation?
They've done. Is there anybody
online? No, right now I go to
the committee.
There are questions or comments
from the committee.
Senator She always knows to look
at me and I'll.
to name them, and I'm sure I
move under Ramos ask a question.
All right.
I can't wait to see how what the
other options are that are gonna
come if we finish up these last
two weeks.
All right, we have Senator,
Senator Ramos?
Did he just set you up or you
really have a question?
He just set you up right.
Senator Haramilo. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator, for you
being here. Can you let me know
what types of jobs are being
lost at Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
I spoke to
One of the
wives.
Of the family that I know.
I, she was going to contact me,
but this, the bill moved faster.
Purse and her husband.
lost his job of research for 40
years.
And I won't disclose his name,
but she says at some point
she'll be able to talk when he
knows exactly what's happened.
He is just the first that we've
been able to contact.
And, you know, he had 40 years
as a mechanical engineer at
Sandia.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator,
the reason why that concerns me
is because Los Alamos is my
district, and if I know that a
number of scientists are losing
their jobs, and I haven't heard
from them. I want to know how
many were being affected.
Madam Chairman, the
What's happening is no one wants
to say or do anything yet.
There's there's a lot of things
in flux.
The reason why we would do this.
He is not so the state
investment council can spend
this money.
It's so that if in fact
What we expect to happen.
Has
And we have a lot of talented
people.
Entering the marketplace with a
concurrent pattern with their.
The laboratory.
For a university.
We can have the money available.
To do a private equity funding
that would include those
scientists and get them to stay
here and develop their.
They, they're manufacturing,
Madam Chair, Senator, I know
exactly where you're going, and
this bill would exactly protect
that group of people. Now I see
based on what you're saying, you
know exactly where you're going
and I know exactly.
Thank you, madam.
Senator Rubles really wants to
ask a question, so I'll go to
him, I'll go to you after
Senator Robbins Senator Pinto,
thank you for bringing this bill
in front of us today. What is
the basis for making this
increased investment in an
underperforming program.
7
Mr. Madam Chair and um Senator,
if you take a look at the FIR
even though it was
underperforming the second part
of it was that it still brings
the economic development of um
jobs into the area.
OK.
Madam Chair, um, senator, what
is the relationship of the, of
DFA investments in the
NMPEIP and
Alongside the SDPF investment
increase.
What's important to realize is
that
Madam Chair,
what's important to realize is
that
Yes
This fund
Was
Started at a time in 2002.
When it really got going and
unfortunately, that was the time
when pay to play.
Yeah, it was happening.
And
Fortunately, this money has all
been.
re replaced.
But not recovered.
So if I have the
Uh, if you on the fiscal impact
report for 162.
or compost is built that puts a
$700 million cap on investments
and of this type.
That bill has a really good
Statement of what the, the
various funds are at.
And you'll see that the state
investment council uh has
invested the
So
The
Investments they made.
In private equity lost 4%.
And everybody else was positive.
And the reason it lost 4%, is
there still factoring in these
negative experiences we had.
It's time to get past that and
move on. The important thing
about this bill is look what
kind of an answer we got from
the state investment council.
That's the first time, Madam
Chairman, we have ever heard
anything from them.
About where our money is, what
their plan is and this bill will
create an opportunity, but it
doesn't create a necessity to
make this investment.
It's just there in case what
we've anticipated may happen.
And it's not uh a bad thing or a
good thing. If you can handle
it.
You can keep that research going
and you can keep it in New
Mexico.
Madam Chair, no further
questions.
Thank you so much. Senator
Ramos. Senator chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So I
know that we have uh
All of these brilliant
scientists that have patents and
things like that today.
Um
they prevent it from
Going into business with their
patents today.
Chairman, the only thing that,
that really restricts them today
is their finances.
They're like very successful
people.
to take
put roots into New Mexico,
they've a nice house. They've
got a good retirement.
They didn't, they don't have
equity money to invest in uh
manufacturing. That's why this
type of financing is important
and it's why we want to get the
state investment council to be
more interested in not just
private equity funding, but
really looking at individuals
that have patents that something
can be done with.
So, Mr. President.
And it tours
Um
weren't their private
Investors out there today that
could invest in these.
Madam Chairman, yes, there are.
So, Madam President, if, if it's
a really cool thing,
That an investor thinks they're
gonna make money off of private
investor, not the state.
Why wouldn't they invest?
Madam Chairman, I hope they
would.
It doesn't slow, this doesn't
slow them down, nor does it
create competition because this
is the kind of private equity
investment that very few people.
are able to make or capable of
making financially.
It's kind of like the higher you
fly, the fewer.
And that's what that's what's
going on. I don't think this is
going to upset those people who
are making private equity
investments, as you'll notice
they're not here.
They don't feel like they have
to defend it.
What they have
And I'm
So I'm trying to be
I'm trying to be more than
polite about this cause I think
you're correct.
I think you're correct, Senator.
So
Madam chair
I don't necessarily oppose the
concept here.
But our investment
portfolio, no matter what it is,
is designed to make money.
Um
And
The whole purpose of the, the
permanent funds when they were
set up was to pay for education,
essentially.
When the natural resources of
New Mexico.
ran out, so that
10 years ago.
Um
And so in these cases, while
there's certainly a possibility
to make money.
There's also the possibility to
lose money, and that's why I
think that the private investor.
is in a better
spot to do that because the
private investor to look at it.
And so forth. And if we simply
say that, well, the state's
gotta do so much of this.
Then we'll do it.
But
Potentially we get less return
on the dollar.
And the whole point of that is
the whole point of the fund is
to have more to turn on the dog.
So, I do have one other question
though.
Madam Chair and senators.
So we talk about investing in
New Mexico. So you get this,
this really smart guy from the
labs.
And he goes, wow, here's my
thing, here's my, uh, in the
state, invest in it. He goes,
but I don't really want to live
here anymore.
Because the taxes, the
regulations, or whatever. So he
moves to Texas, where there's no
personal income tax. Well, we've
invested in him.
And now they're really not in
New Mexico business anymore. Is
there any safeguard in there to
say you have to stay in the
Mexico business.
Madam Chairman, it's, it's rep
it's written into the bill,
however,
There have been problems with
the state Investment council in
some of the private equity firms
that they've already invested
in.
So you could have a private
equity firm that's located in
Santa Fe, which there was.
Some of the former SIC
representatives worked in that
one, yeah, they were hotshots
and we gave them money and they
failed totally and they invested
it in some of some of their
investments went out of state.
So we need to
Work with the state investment
council to get them to
understand, number one, this is
a, they have a responsibility,
yes, to make money, but number
2, this is a jobs bill.
And in order for this to be
sustainable, they've got to get
into investments with companies
that are going to repay it.
And so that's when
Like you said, private equity is
gonna be more attractive to the
scientist and then ours because
there's gonna be criteria that
this SIC is gonna put on them
that may be onerous. We hope it
is. We want this money to come
back and not be a drain on the
severance tax fund.
And Madame Chaian, uh, senator,
uh, in the FIR it also says that
it creates greater flexibility
for the SIC.
Um, to make these investments to
diversify the portfolios.
This um
Madam Chan in, absolutely, I see
that.
But
Senator Robinson, you made a,
uh, a statement, we have to get
the SIC to understand.
And I agree with that, but
should not.
The law forced them to
understand instead of us just
convincing them somehow cause
We're not going to convince them
if they want to invest in
something else, unless the law
says thou shalt only do it for
New Mexico companies.
Madam Chairman, I think there's
enough.
Uh, requirements in the bill.
In the walk
They need to comply with it.
I think our finance our LFC is
designed to go in and find out
from groups like the SIC who are
a little bit
disassociated from us.
You can almost get out of that
out of Santa Fe before you find
their office.
But
They don't participate in this
process very much.
And God blessed him.
However, it it it's important
for us to to call them in and
say, hey, by the way, where did
you put our money?
That would be just an excellent
question.
Because then we can know, well,
what did they lose money on?
What did they win gain money on.
It, it's, it shouldn't be a
secret.
And we should get
More involved with them just to
get to know them.
Get to know what their opinions
are besides just an FIR that we
don't get to see.
with the chair of um senator,
we're not, we're just increasing
the fund, everything that still
stands within the bill about New
Mexico businesses, New Mexico
private equity still stands
within the bill. We're not
changing any of that. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Madam,
I get that. I also, I also know,
and I, I, I'm concerned because
of what happened a long time ago
because I was here.
And
And it very much is is Senator
Robinson said it wasn't pay to
play world for a little while.
In that concerns me.
Uh, I would
So I'm torn because I want to
see us invest in New Mexico.
I also want New Mexicans to be
successful and pay back.
Alone, OK.
Um
And it just appears to me that
certainly the old ones.
Oh, we never got paid back on
it, he said, uh, money went out.
And the company spent it and
then disappeared.
Um
And, and so I'm just, that's,
that is really my concern with
this.
Um
I, I understand what, what
Senator Pinto is trying to do. I
actually
I think it's a good idea, but
I just want to have a more warm
fuzzy feeling that we're not
gonna just throw more money
away.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Sheriff. Any
other questions or comments?
But that they are burden to my
apologies.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator. I'm just curious
since you also did reference
Senator Campos's bill that is
changing the exact same section.
But it's removing the percentage
and is instead changing it to
$700 million.
You have an opinion on, you
think the 14% is better overall,
or do you think the 700 million
is a better overall.
Madam Chairman,
uh, I, I prefer 14%, but it
doesn't matter. The state
investment council is now has,
is about to spend up to 9%.
So there's adequate money.
To, to do this.
It's important to know that we
don't have to spend it, and it's
also important to know that
Senator Compos's bill may not
pass.
Madam Chair and, uh, senator, I
think it's the perception of
whether you want to cap it at
dollars or percentage because it
seems my, my personal
preference, it's it's a
percentage is better than um
trying to put a dollar amount,
especially when we talk about
inflationary indexes.
Thank you, that answers my
question.
Thank you so much. Any other
questions or comments from the
committee.
What is the will of the
committee?
I'm moving too fast.
Yeah do pass motion from Senator
Berkins. Do we have a second?
Second from Senator O'Malley.
You will please take the boat.
Senator Figueroa.
No.
Senator Hail.
Yes.
Senator O'Malley.
Senator Paul
Senator Ramos.
Senator Sanchez.
Senator.
Senator Bergman.
S
Yes.
We have
Yeah
4
5 to 4 but
Thank you, Senator Pinto. We're
gonna keep you around.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee that 460 Senate
bill for 60 is just adding
language, um, providing that
loans from the severance tax
permanent fund for film projects
may be made to independent New
Mexico film projects.
And uh we still have Senator
Robinson and we'll stand for
questions.
All right. Thank you so much.
Uh, going to the audience, is
there anybody in the audience in
support of this bill?
If I we've got 2 people by a
show of hands.
Is there anybody in the audience
in opposition of this bill.
For anybody online.
All right, we're gonna have the
two of you come on up. We're
gonna let you speak for a
minute.
Um, what you will see, uh,
please come on up behind the
Senate sponsor.
And you will see it the 32nd
mark, the 32nd morning to go
ahead and wrap it up.
Come on up. We wanna make this
go. Thank you so much. Thank you
so much. Good morning, counsel.
Thanks for, uh, hearing this
bill, and thank you to Senator
Pinto for bringing it up. Can
you please say your name,
please, for the record. My name
is Devin Hawke Ludlow, an
independent filmmaker. I work
with uh Santa Fe Film Council,
other film councils, so I don't
speak on their behalf.
I work with a lot of independent
filmmakers here in New Mexico,
um, in our attempts to grow this
industry and grow this part of
our economy, both creative and
monetarily. We support this
bill, every filmmaker I know
does support this bill. We want
to see more support from our
legislature, and this is a great
example of it. Um, we want to
make sure that this part of our
economy flourishes, it grows.
It's a really important time for
film, nationwide and in our
state in particular, and
We think this bill will help,
especially local filmmakers, so
local actors, directors, writers
have the ability to fund and
grow their projects, so we're in
support of this bill. Thank you
so much.
Thank you. Hi, my name is Robert
Dennis. I'm a resident of Santa
Fe and Senator Wirth's district.
I'm retired out of the motion
picture business in Southern
California.
I've been here about 5 years
now. I also support this bill. I
support modifications to the
existing statute that's on the
books, uh, I think it represents
a large pot of money that could
be put towards local New Mexico
and and state produced uh
original content. I think it's
very important to support this
industry right now. It's
undergoing.
A lot of change, a lot of our
filmmakers, a lot of our below
the line crew are out of work
and could use the support. Thank
you very much.
Thank you.
Right, uh, Senator Pinto, you
can certainly respond to public
testimony or we can go ahead and
go to the committee. Uh, Madam
Chair and members of the
committee, as you've seen it,
you keep up with a lot of what
happens in the world of uh
Netflix and Hulu and all of that
if an entity comes in and does
one small project within an
area, it brings in all kinds of
investment after we've seen
some.
In some sense, like a resort to
having uh being the film
location and then next thing you
know, they're booked down for
like 2 years and you can't get a
reservation in there. I think
there's a big impact out there.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you so much, Senator
Pinto. Any questions or comments
from the committee?
rounds, Madam Chair, looking at
uh Senator looking at the fiscal
impact report. It says there's
no significant issues, previous
loans prudent to the existing
film loan program
were not successful in terms of
return on investment.
What is being done to make this
work.
Madam Chairman.
What's interesting about this
bill.
I we cut out.
The Independence
In the first
Round of film financing.
What we got out of that.
Was
A few
Investments that didn't work.
A few investments.
That did work
But they didn't necessarily work
on the on the positive.
size of their of their total
expenditures.
But they led to
Series on TV like Wildfire.
Wildfire was one of the most
Uh
Prosperous
Um
Series that we've had here.
That's what really returned
money to New Mexico.
And then, of course, you know,
Breaking Bad.
Breaking Bad made millions for
New Mexico in employment and
engross receipts, and we gave
them millions as well.
Those companies.
Wildfire and
Uh, Breaking Bad, they were both
made by companies like Netflix,
um,
Uh, uh
Raleigh
MGM
Um
Uh
The lion's gate.
Those all those companies have
their own distribution network.
So they could comply with the
film financing at that level,
because they had their own
distribution network that
knocked out all the independence
cause they don't have a
distribution network.
If we move with this bill, what
it'll create for us is a much
more sustainable economy.
Because as these gentlemen say,
There is not going to be a
distribution network.
To get, get their bills uh their
films out, but if you look at
the recent
awards, the Oscars.
2
Two individual films were made
by Indies independents.
And they got Best Picture
documentary and another one.
And one of them doesn't have a
distribution contract.
The film about Gaza, that's
certainly a political matter.
However
If you don't have a distribution
contract, you're not eligible
for any financing or any
consideration. It's gonna be up
to the state investment council
to meet the individuals like
these two gentlemen.
And go through the
pre-production financing
questions.
That's the most valuable money
you can get in film is
preproduction, and that's what
we gave.
To start the film.
Finance process.
Gary Johnson signed that bill.
When it was put into place.
It's a, it was a union.
Ah, it's a union market.
And he understood that.
And we competed in that union
market, successfully.
Why? Because we were able to
loan pre-production financing at
a
very reasonable rate.
And there wasn't another state
in the union that could do it.
When we competed with the first
film finance bill, I thought we
were gonna compete with
California and John Henry told
me, no, we're gonna compete with
Canada, and he was right.
And we want
And that's why this is a huge
industry and why it had a huge
impact.
Now what we have is the chance
to make it sustainable by
getting these gentlemen's
efforts involved. Sorry it took
too long.
I'm a good filibuster.
Madam Chair, senator, um, do you
know approximately how many
loans have gone through this
program.
Madam Chairman, once again state
Investment council.
It wouldn't hurt them to come
over and talk to us.
And give us some charts and say,
you know what, when we did, uh.
Um
In plain sight.
The the film lost money, but
then we got a TV series out of
it.
So you've got, you gotta look
and say, well, we lost a little
money here but boy did we make
money bringing in all this
activity on a series.
So that's the kind of question
we could ask them and they could
tell us, you know what, uh, we
listened to Gary Bland and he
was
Take her shirt
And Gary Coco was in charge of
of looking at movies and he's
retired.
So to get involved, they're
gonna need to up their, their
capabilities. There I go again.
Thank you, Madam Chairman.
Madam, no, you, you're, you're
great. I appreciate the, the
answers. Uh, is there a
potential for a recurring impact
on the general fund?
I believe, um, Madam Chair and
Senator, I believe there will
be, but that's uh it's still too
early to tell.
No more questions, man.
Thank you. I believe I have
Senator Sharon and then I have
Senator Patillo.
Um
Thank you, Madam Chair.
So we talked about the
distribution system as opposed
to.
The actual creation of the.
The film or the TV series, how
exactly would
With this investment changes the
distribution system. Madam
Chairman, it doesn't change the
distribution system. It just
means that other entities will
be eligible for funding.
Because the people that come out
of Deney College, the people
have come out of San Juan
College.
The people who come out of UNM
media arts, the New Mexico State
and CNM have programs now. You,
you go to
I mean, it's all over the state.
We're, we're creating people
that are capable.
But we can't get them to move
into the business side of it and
get more involved.
Now
One more thing
Yeah
When Sony came in here.
We gave them a lot of money.
And they upped the scale of what
our people could do.
And then they wept.
And the people are saying now,
well, that's why you don't have
any big productions, cause
Sony wasn't satisfied to stay
here. Well, I will produce to
the committee the story of Sony
in Wales.
There are 2-time offender in
that kind of market practice.
They went in, got money in
Wales, used it, created a
minimal response and then got
out.
So you need to know that this
can still even with the big
companies that come in there and
make a big investment, we can
still have trouble. That's why
we have to be on top of it.
Sorry, taken too long.
It's right, Senator, we, we, um,
it's just that we've got a very
ambitious agenda, so we do ask
that our experts get um right to
the point and make sure that and
are certainly, as you know, if a
question isn't answered, there
will always be a follow up. So,
go ahead, senator here.
So, uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
I just, so Netflix certainly can
can distribute whatever they
produce.
But the independent
Filmakers sitting out there or
watching.
They can't distribute that, and
so while they can, we can invest
in their film.
There's no return on that unless
there's distribution.
So that's what I'm trying to get
at.
Madam Chair and Senator, there
are different avenues now, even
with music, when you go onto the
internet, it'll put the TikTok
and a lot of these um social
media, the outreach can blow up
very quickly, um, in which you
probably wouldn't need a
distribution, um, that network,
it'll just kind of happen
within.
Within the social media.
OK, Madam Chair, so
We're counting on the
independent filmmaker to just
have their film go viral.
Madam Chair, Senator, yes, in
some, in some instances, yes.
But not
Madam chair, um.
OK. I do think the distribution
system is what we need to focus
on.
Um
And how do we get the the
independent and
Shows or whatever.
Out there
Because there's a lot of stuff
doesn't go viral.
There's some that does.
There's a whole heap that done.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Sher. Senator
had a meal. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Senator. Mine
is just a comment. I think of
all those students across New
Mexico who have been motivated
by the film industry right here
in our state. I saw one of our
professors from northern New
Mexico College just walked in.
We have some students in
Espanola who are doing some
really good films. We just can't
get them out there. Now, Madam
Chair, Senator, I want to bring
the attention to a documentary
that should be out in the
mainstream which is independent
and just isn't there. And that's
the documentary.
First we bombed New Mexico,
which focuses on the New Mexico
downwinders and the Trinity
site. This independent film has
a tremendous impact and could
help us in trying to compensate
those who are affected by the
bombing at Trinity site. Now
Madam Chair, for those who might
not know and those listening at
the film highlights the efforts
of a good friend of mine,
activist, Tina Cordoba and
Loretta Anderson of Laguna
Pueblo, who have been fighting
for years for the federal
government to acknowledge the
harm done to their communities
and
conclusion of the Downwinders
and post-1971, uranium miners
under the 1990 radiation
exposure compensation Act.
Independent films can have a
powerful impact on telling the
stories of people and in telling
the stories of New Mexicans, we
can turn to independent
filmmakers to help elevate our
voice. And with that, Senator, I
will be supporting your bill
because I do see the impact this
could have. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Any other questions or comments
from the committee before I make
a few comments and then I'll ask
for a motion if there aren't.
Um, Senator Pinto, I'm wondering
and we've had a little bit of a
conversation about this
beforehand. Um, if these loans
can go to projects on tribal
lands. The reason why I ask.
because during the interim, we
had some indigenous filmmakers
present to the economic and
rural Development Policy
Committee.
And um and her name escapes me
right now, but she's, uh, she
had a book out last year, and
she's done a lot of work, um,
but they can't get the tax
breaks that everybody outside of
tribal lands can get, and that's
maybe just more of something
that I'd like us to ponder on,
on really trying to explore how
that can be more equitable.
Because the tax incentives that
we're giving Netflix in
Albuquerque, and we've got some
film studios down in Las Cruces
are not available to tribal
communities, and, and I hope
that maybe if you and I can work
together on that because there,
there needs to be some more
equity on there. And also, I
mean, we've got Camrock studios,
Dark Winds, the season 3 of Dark
Winds launches tomorrow night,
and I'm very excited about that.
And every time I go, if like I
know that Senator Hana meal when
you drive to Los Alamos, you
drive past the Darko studios.
And the times that I've driven
past there are the Camel Rock
studios, and I've seen the Dark
Winds cars, the police cars that
are back from like the 70s, 60s,
70s, early 80s and some really
some like, oh my God, who is
designing fashion at that time,
you should.
Uh, but we did it, and we lived
through it. But this is the
thing is is that these, these
communities, so I, so my
question is,
Can these loans be uh given to
projects that are on tribal
lands.
Madam Chair, I do not know that.
But I know there has in order to
build on the tribal nations you
need to get permission.
So that might be something that
we, I would love to work with
you on because um we are seeing
more and more.
Uh, incredible pieces of work
come out of our tribal
communities and um and yet
there's, there's a little bit
more of a struggle there, um, to
get those done. Uh, if there are
no other comments or questions
from the committee, what is the
will of the committee?
Madam Chaing will do best.
All righty. Do we have a second?
second from Senator Britons, if
you will please take the book.
Senator Fierro.
No.
Senator had a meal.
Senator O'Malley.
Senator Paul.
Senator Ramos.
Yes.
Senator Sanchez.
And to share.
Senator Worth is you, Senator
Bergin.
Send it to him, yes.
So you have due pass on the 6 to
3 vote. Thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. Thank
you, sir. Pinto. Uh, we're gonna
go ahead and go back to Senator
Stephanics.
Uh, so this is Senate Bill 118.
Senator, we have a committee
substitute for you. Am I
correct? OK.
Thank
you.
Madam chair, um,
Thank you for hearing this bill
this morning, organ donor
license, uh, registry and uh
Do you want me to explain the
moment or you wanna move it for
let's move it first if we can.
Madam Chair, I move a do not
pass on Senate Bill 118, but I
do pass on the Senate taxes
Transportation Committee
substitute for Senate Bill 118
for discussion purposes.
So
Man, um, I need to reference the
original bill for the
substitute. The original bill
came from the Legislative Health
and Human Services Interim
Committee. It's to encourage
more organ donations throughout
the entire state, the original
bills changed, uh 44 sections of
law.
And the cost was prohibitive, so
taxation and revenue and
regulation licensing worked with
me on this committee substitute
so that they will in fact get
out the information more like a
QR code or something like that
to Allstate agencies, but that
is what this committee
substitute does, so we can still
encourage organ donation.
All right. Thank you so much.
Uh, and do you send to parents?
Did you have an expert or do you
wanna, it came from the interim
committee, so there's no expert
and actually this is Senator
Jerry Ortiz's EP notes
brainchild.
Thank you. Thank you. All right,
just by a show of hands, we'll
go to the audience now. Uh,
anybody in the audience in
support of this legislation.
They have one, is there anybody
in the audience in opposition of
this legislation.
Going online, nobody. You want
to come on down and, and give a
minute testimony.
So you'll have one minute,
you'll see the vice chair give
you a 32nd warning,
but I think.
I'm Janet Williams with the
National Organization for Women.
My husband had a transplant and
all I can say is this would be
life saving, please pass it.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
All right, see no other public
comment, we don't have anybody
online. Um, now I go to the
committee.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So I
only have one page of the
committee substitute, Madam
Chair, but you talked about, uh,
a QR code in there. Is that in
the law somewhere or in the bill
somewhere?
No, uh, Madam chair, senator,
uh, the second page is only one
sentence, and I don't know if
it's on the back. You mind
reading it? It's, oh, is it,
it's copied on the actual back.
No, it's not.
All right, OK, that's right. I
don't do that. I don't need the
last sentence. I don't probably
just says, OK, so, um, Madam
Chair, the department indicated
that there would be a variety of
methods for uh working with
different state agencies, the QR
code is only one of them.
Another might be paper
applications that send on
another might be um an email
application, so uh that is not
specified here. They just agreed
that they would do it.
So Madam Chair, why is, mine
says donor right on it. My
driver's license.
Obviously, we can.
Today. Uh yes, madam Chair,
Senator, this, uh, opens up the
opportunity MVD text under Texan
rev will work with all state
agencies to encourage any
application. So if somebody
applied for TANF or for Medicaid
or for SNAP or child support,
they would be given the
opportunity and the means in
which to say I will also be an
organ donor. So it's spreading
it out. It could go to
corrections, I guess, um, it
could go to a
of places.
All right, thank you. So, Madam
Chair, my wife.
I didn't even know you could do
a pancreas transplant till she
got a pancreas and kidney
transplant.
And it's kind of hard to even.
Old, but you got a kidney and
pancreas transplant, diabetic
type one diagnosed at age 11.
And so that really did save her
life.
All in favor.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Sheriff. Any
other questions or comments from
the committee.
Senator, thanks for bringing
this bill. I
I really, um
It really is touching uh when I,
when I think of people that have
had transplants.
And uh
Anything to make this thing,
make things easier and better,
of course.
I have a
God Godchild's.
Oh, sun.
Had a heart transplant at uh
I believe, 8 months old.
And saved his life.
So we're real thankful for that,
but my big question is, is where
is all this information gonna be
gathered?
And uh
And spread, you know, after you,
uh, bring in all these different
entities to gather this
information.
Thank you for the question,
Madam Chair, Senator. So the
reason tax and Rove, which is uh
controls MVD.
I helped with the design of this
substitute bill is because all
of the information would come
back to them and it would end up
on a driver's license or in the
records of the driver's license.
So let's say, um,
A state police found um an
accident and it
Went into a serious.
Health issues and perhaps the
person died, they would be able
to call up this information and
pass it on to the next person
taking care of the person.
Madam Cur Center, there'll be uh
election bank and then
transferred over,
uh man center there currently is
that at the MBD at the motor
vehicle division.
Thank you very much, man.
Thank you, Senator Ramos. Any
other questions or comments from
the committee.
Senator Figaroa, move a do pass
on Senate tax business and
Transportation Committee sent
you a bill, 118. Thank you. We,
we have a 2nd from Senator
Sherrod.
Is there anybody in opposition
of this new past motion?
See now, let's go ahead and
record all those present in the
affirmative for the due pass
it's 9 to 0. Thank you very
much, Madam Chair, members of
the committee. Thank you,
Senator.
All right, Senator O'Malley, and
then um we'll jump to center guy
goes, cause I see you sitting
over there.
Now, Senator O'Malley, this one
we have recorded that this could
be
Uh, possible, uh, inclusion in
the tax package, so we are gonna
hold that. We have
2 holes today, that and, um,
Senator Brant's Senate Bill 455.
So today we're going to hear
that for those of you in the
audience, this is a possibility
of it being.
considered for a potential tax
package, um, we're hoping to
hear about that soon. And um and
so what we will do as a
committee is we will hear
questions, we will hear public
testimony if needed, and then we
will hold it here in the
committee.
And so, uh, Senator O'Malley,
uh, go ahead and go.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you for the committee members
for the opportunity to present
Senate Bill 422, uh, to make an
appropriation for operational
support for for affordable
housing nonprofit organizations.
And with me online is Robin
Powell. She's a senior director
of policy and planning for the
New Mexico Finance Authority. I
know they changed their name,
but I don't remember what it
was. Um, so this, uh, this came
about as a discussion with
actually um Protem Stewart and
it had to do with the fact that
uh there are a lot of the bills.
Right.
Oh
All right.
So that there are a lot of bills
for housing development and of
course this is these are capital
dollars.
And um nonprofits do play a role
in getting affordable housing
out the door either through
partnering with development
organizations or builders, and
they do a lot of the planning.
So, um, as you probably have
heard it and, and as many of us
know it's difficult sometimes to
get affordable housing off the
ground. It has to do with
pushback a lot of times from
neighborhoods, there's zoning
issues, there's all kinds of
problems.
And um this is where I think
nonprofits come in and can
either partner with the
developer or be the developer
themselves and getting a project
off the ground and and um.
So I, I think it's important.
This is uh $5 million request.
It is over a period of 5 years,
um, it would go through MFA, MFA
would manage this fund, um, they
would of course create the um
From the gate of the rules
associated with it.
Um, but I think what's important
about this going to New Mexico
Finance Authority and I, and it
does say in the FRII does talk
about the um the new um what is
it, housing office of of uh.
Housing with uh under the
administration. It is a new
organization, the Mexico Finance
Authority has a lot of
relationships already with
organizations throughout the
state, and so I think that um
they would have the capacity to
carry this out and um any
questions about that, of course,
I will direct them to Robin
Powell, who's on life.
Senator, do you want your, your,
do you want Robin to go ahead
and make any statements, OK,
Robin, if you will go ahead and
unmute yourself.
Um, good morning. This is Robin
Powell, senior director of
policy and planning uh for the
mortgage Finance Authority.
Thank you for letting me um
testify virtually this morning.
Um, and I'll be happy to answer
any questions, um, for Senator
O'Malley or the committee um
related to the work we do or the
partnerships that we have across
the state.
Thank you so much. All right,
now we're going to go to the
audience. Are there folks here
in the audience that are in
support of this bill by show
hints?
See if there's anybody in the
audience in opposition of this
bill by show hands.
See none. Anybody online?
Right, now we go to the
committee.
Senator Hadami.
Madam Chair, Senator, thanks for
bringing this bill forward. How
did you come up with the 5
million?
Uh
The chair Senator Camillo, uh,
this was with, uh, discussion
from New Mexico Finance
Authority, uh, we looked at the
possibilities of maybe 10
organizations.
Um, maybe more depending on what
the request would be.
And uh some of the work that
they're doing throughout the
state, um, this does open it up
for folks who are also doing
work on homelessness.
Um, and, um, so this is how this
number came about, Madam Chair,
Senator, and I just think it's a
really low number.
When you think about the need of
affordable housing, transitional
housing, and housing the unhomed
rate.
55 million just seems like a
small drop in a bucket where we
need so much help. Um, this is
something that would benefit Ria
Riba County where we're looking
for transitional housing.
This is, this is a good deal.
That we're not voting on it.
But I'm happy to actually we are
my apologies committee, um, uh,
Izzy who is
Somewhere here, uh, has said
because it's an appropriations
and as soon as you said the
appropriations,
so we will be able to vote on
this bill. Thank you, Madam
Chair. See the need in New
Mexico even just in my district.
This is a good bill that could
help with ensuring we put a roof
over someone's head. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Hami.
Any other questions or Senator
Figueroa, and then I'm sorry,
Senator Figueroa, I'm gonna have
you go after Senator Berns.
things that I'm sure I just have
a quick question, did this end
up in House Bill 2?
When it crossed over from the
house, this appropriation.
I don't believe it did.
OK. Do you have plans to try to
get it in there. So yeah.
Well, it was a little late.
So
That's why, uh, Senator, uh,
Madam Chair, Senator Bergman's,
um,
After, you know, much discussion
and we were looking at the bills
coming in, Senator Stewart and
I, uh, yeah, that's why it has
high number.
So that's why um this came
about.
OK.
All right, Senator Figuero.
Thank you, man. Thank you,
Senator. Um, I, my question is
about the criteria for selecting
what organizations, projects get
the funds. That's not in this
piece of legislation and given
uh Madam Chair, that it's
affordable housing and homeless
services and transitional
housing.
Which one is the priority and
how is that decision made and
who makes it.
Uh
Madam Chair, um,
Center Figueroa, uh, that, I
mean, so the Mexico Finance
Authority has a lot of uh
experience in this area and um
of course they have a board and
so they, they do reach out to
communities and I believe that
that's something that will be,
will be done in terms of looking
at the state, um, and, uh, and
then already, uh, they have some
very strong requirements. They,
the their, um, you know, when
they contract with an
organization, they do follow up.
Um, in a lot of cases, uh, and
this may happen, they may
require some funding from the
other sources of funding, um,
nonprofits do get because
they're nonprofits, they do,
they are able to get funding
from foundations, for example.
Um, so they're, they're gonna
look at that, and I, and I
believe that they have the
capacity to really screen uh
those organizations.
Madam chair, that was the second
part of my question, are these
organizations going to have
funding from other sources or
cities, municipalities,
counties, uh, can opt in for
these projects can really get
done, but it sounds like MFA has
their criteria, has their
process, and we'll be running
all of that, um, is there a
required report out, so at some
point we will be able to see how
this money was spent.
And I will, um, I, I believe so,
but I will, uh,
As Robin to weigh in on that
with the Mexicoinance Authority.
If she's still here. Thank you,
Senator O'Malley and um Madam
Chair and Senator Figueroa, yes,
um, you, as you may know, uh,
MFA has a legislative oversight
committee that we report to, um,
and that means 4 to 5 times
annually. We also typically uh
report to legislative finance
Committee and then um right
before the session, we typically
report to um the legislative uh
finance services.
Um, with updates on any state
funding that has been
appropriated to uh either the
housing trust fund or the
mortgage Finance Authority.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Robin. Um, that's just
exactly what I needed to know.
We need to get this money out
and working.
Right, thank you.
Other questions or comments from
the committee, Senator Sheriff.
Um
Thank you, Madam Chair.
So we got to get this money out,
but can you tell me how that
actually works on the ground, so
there's $5 million. Who gets it
and how do they get it and what
do they do with it?
To
Um,
Medicare, uh, Center share. So,
Nonprofits are already engaged
in this on some level, um, uh,
and I'll use, you know,
Albuquerque as an example, um.
And the most, uh, I could say
the closest example I have is
the song of community land
trustst which is right next to
the on the market. There's 33
acres that is dedicated to
permanently affordable housing,
they have a partnership with the
city of Albuquerque, um, to get
projects off the ground, um,
they are a nonprofit
organization. They work with
private developers at times
they've been the developer, by
the way, all building and all
the development, of course, it
goes through the private.
sector.
Um
This is what they do. They, they
engage the community, they work
with uh uh the the developer in
terms of planning and, and um uh
because uh there's an author
seems, there is a gap depending
on where housing is built, if
it's getting uh built in areas
that are, um, there's some be
zoning uh.
situations or older
neighborhoods or where you're
gonna get possibly some pushback
from the community, they engaged
the community and they go
through, that's how they help,
um, and so in terms of getting
the, the
The projects that we, we have
now a lot of money that's
getting appropriate for capital,
that's bricks and mortar and uh
and so I think that this is uh
this organizations can really be
helpful in getting that out the
door by working with
communities.
So
Madam Chair and senator, is
there any
kind of uh oversight or
transparency, a mechanism in
this, uh, Madam Chair, send
sender share absolutely and as
was mentioned by uh Robin the
Mexico Finance Authority. They
do reporting, um, every year
and, and, and I think it's 3 or
4 times a year.
Also, there's, there's some
pretty uh strong criteria, uh,
in terms of working with
nonprofits, um, Mexico Finance
Authority has a very good record
of that. They have the capacity
for oversight, um, the profit,
they already partnered with
other organizations, nonprofits,
and private developers. So, um,
I believe that it will have
strong oversight.
So
Madam Chair and senator, so in a
NMFA.
This is their money and they
deal with it the way they do
anything else is that.
I suppose it's something outside
of him and so this would be uh
it's like a new program. I mean,
they do, they do have other
programs, but this would be
Senator, if I can, I just want
to make sure it's it's MFA. It's
not NMFA. It's the mortgage
finance mortgage finance
authority. I'm sorry ised itself
to Housing New Mexico. It's not
in New Mexico Finance Authority.
The mortgage mortgage that's
thank you for that correction
because that's I just, just so
that that that we want to make
sure that Senator Sher.
Everybody understands who this
is actually under.
My apologies, Senator Sheriff.
Oh, that's good. Thank you.
So, so, MFA right, gets the
money and then they distribute
it the way they would distribute
or work with whatever else they
have.
Oh
So when you talk about engage
the community.
Does that mean they're knock on
doors and say, hey, we're gonna
build some low income housing in
your neighborhood? Well, it's
um, it's a little, I wouldn't
say it's that simple, uh, and,
you know, engage the community,
you, you have meetings with
them, yeah, sometimes you have
small meetings with the
community, you, you tell them
about the planning, you help,
they, they be, they're usually
part of the planning process,
for example, um,
And I think that you have a more
successful project project and
you probably can get a project
off the ground if you do that. I
think that's really key.
Great. Thank you, man.
Thank you, Senator Sheriff. Any
other questions, Senator Ramos,
Madam Chair, I, I, it's more of
a venture center. It's, it's
more of a comment. I know when
in my district, we are
desperately needing.
affordable housing, but
There's no such thing as
affordable housing.
You know, when you have a small
house that's
In 1100 square feet, 1000 square
feet for $270,000.
Um
on a low income can afford that.
So
I don't know what our answer is
going to be to our constituents
because
We can keep throwing more and
more money out there.
But
If we can't make things decently
affordable, then
What can we do? I think this is
something we truly need to work
on in the interim and hopefully
bring together.
The package and some reasonable
ideas to.
affordable
Thank you very much, ma'am.
Thank you Senator Roberson, I
think you're really touching on
a really important thing is
that, you know, I look at when
we look at these issues, I look
at it as a bicycle tire and
those spokes I talked about this
before.
Is that this is one area we're
looking at affordable housing,
but we also have to look at
whether or not people can make a
decent living and whether or not
their job opportunities of their
mental health crises or if their
addiction issues, homelessness.
And so we, we look at all of
those things and I think we're
all having the same questions
like, how do we do this? There
isn't just one solution to it.
We have to look at it as a whole
and all the different things
that impact that. So I
appreciate you bringing that up.
Um, are there any other
questions or comments from the
committee?
What is the will of the
committee?
Man.
We have to pass from Senator
Bergman's. We have a second from
Senator Figueroa.
Anybody in opposition of the
motion?
All right, so go ahead and take
a, uh, if you will, go ahead and
take uh the, the boat.
Senator Figueroa.
Yes, Senator had a meal.
Senator O'Malley Senator Paul.
Senator Ramos.
Yes.
Senator Sanchez.
Senator Sheriff.
Senator Worth.
Senator Bergmann, yes.
Senator Hamblin, yes.
Yeah, but do pass on a 7 to 3
vote.
I'm sure many members. Thank
you, Senator O'Malley. All
right, we've had Senator
Gallegos, who's been an eager
beaver and here from the
beginning. And so we are going
to go ahead and Senator Brandt
is willing to sit back there in
his fabulous green socks, uh,
and listen to this, and then
we'll go to Senator Brandt after
that.
It's just some sweet stuff. It's
bacon. Uh, you do love me. Oh,
bacon and eggs, where to go.
Man after my own heart.
All right, Senator Gallegos and
Senator Campos. Uh, Senator
Gallegos, just to give you, just
in case you haven't heard, we'll
do a 10-minute presentation bill
presentation, then we will go to
the audience. You have an
opportunity after the audience
testimony to respond if you so
choose. If not, then we'll go to
the committee.
It's all yours. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Um, Senator for you Senate bill
408 uh today just wanted to give
you a brief update on it. Uh,
this is actually gone through
the legislature a few times, uh,
we now have uh Anna Silva, the
acting secretary of GST in
agreement with the procurement
numbers. What this bill does is
allow the uric caps to increase
from at different levels, uh, in
order to offset some of the
costs.
Uh, for building constructions,
this bill helps every city.
County and school district in
the state and its smart business
week, I have, I introduced my
extra expert in just a minute,
uh, because of the cooperative
education services. We're able
to put people on procurement.
And it is easier for the
districts to go ahead and find a
contractor instead of having
gone through RFP process that
takes time. This is one way to
get the, we talked about in that
uh we have a lot of money out
there that's not being used.
This is one way to get that
money back into the public use
instead of storing and I've got
Sen compost, my co-sponsor, one
of my co-sponsors here with me,
and I yield to him for a few
comments. Thank you.
its chair, thank you very much
to members of the committee.
again to my co-sponsor as we
move forward, just a couple of
things and he would continuously
hear these things in the news.
We see the rising cost, if you
will, of uh preparation, if you
will, with architects,
engineers, and also with the
cost of construction, but this
uh does it keeps up with the
times and it assists all of us
as we move forward to ensure
that projects are completed in a
very timely manner and of course
according to the schedule and
the resources that are
available. Thank you very much.
Madam Chair, thank you members
of the committee.
Thank you so much. If you'd like
your expert to make a brief
statement. Go ahead. I'm sure I
would. This is uh.
David Chavez from Corporate
Education Services. Madam Chair,
members of the committee, thank
you for the time. I'll, I'll
just mention 3 items that'll
speak to the points that that
were uh made uh by Senator
Gallegosson and Senator Campos
on the cost of labor, uh, that
has increased significantly
through the, through the years.
Uh, we've seen cost as high as
$1000 per square foot in a
recent project on a recent
project. We've also seen that
because
of the time it takes for
procurements to be put out on
the street that entities are
finding that they're having
their money revert back to the
state or the federal government.
So these the raising of
procurement limits would assist
in that regard. Thank you.
Thank you so much. All right. So
now we go to the audience. Uh,
is there anybody here in support
of this legislation?
All right, let's go ahead and
we'll get you to back up over
here.
Lucy will take care of the
microphone so that we don't have
any ear blowouts.
Is there anybody, uh, while
they're getting up there,
anybody here in opposition of
this legislation?
Anybody online. All right, so
we've got you two, so you've got
a minute piece.
Uh, wait a minute, if you will,
I think the microphone needs to
get on.
Go ahead.
Lucy, it doesn't sound like that
mic's on.
Well, it's gotta go online,
yeah,
good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Bianca Gutierrez. I'm
the uh registered lobbyist for
the Gordian Group and the
sponsors explained this really
well. Uh, one other issue that
we're trying to solve with this,
is that currently?
There is a $12.5 million cap.
Per 10 year in a 10 year period.
So right now we're really trying
to crank crank out these road
projects and so if we have, you
know, awards going out every 2
or 3 years for
3 million, 5 million. Thank you.
Um, once a contractor hits that
limit, they cannot do any
business with the state until we
hit 10-year period, and then
they can go back out for bid. So
thank you for hearing this
today. Thank you to the
sponsors.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee stand
around for the school
superintendents and something
called the Coalition of
Educational Leaders, that's
about 230,000 students. That's
about 1000 administrators that
includes charters. Madam Chair,
we stand in full support of
this. We have for the last 3
years as we try to deal with
this escalation of cost and not
keeping up on our statutes with
that. This is good business,
this is good procurement.
CES is a trusted entity in that
regard and used by county
cities, universities and
schools. Madam Chair, we asked
the committee to please, uh,
prevail accordingly. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Uh, if you'd
like, I mean you've got glowing
reviews, so you're certainly
welcome to respond to public
testimony, or if you'd like, we
can go ahead and go to the
committee.
I'm sure I think we're ready to
go to. All right, we have
questions or comments from the
committee.
Senator Ramos, then I'll get
Senator. Madam Chair, senators,
thank you for bringing this bill
from us at the very beginning
you mentioned negotiations with
GST and you kind of
Give us a breakdown of how that
went and what you're
negotiating.
And turned Senator Ramos, I
thank you for that question. Uh,
so for years we've had
Um, or my view of what this
needs to do, um, so during
COVID.
The prices really increased.
And at that time I thought if we
would tie a PPI was product
price index would self float.
In Anna Silva's very, very
Strong will
Uh, she's very good. She's
actually the acting secretary
currently of GST, uh, but she,
um, wanted to cap it at the
limit of when I started the
negotiations, I was thinking 20
million overall.
Uh, we're now at that level or
at 7 million, which currently
were at 4, so it'll give us 3
men who rise on the construction
site, um.
The discussions been is the
state needs to feel that they
have control over procurement.
And it goes back and turns
center to, uh, before your, uh,
that problems with like
computers and cars and stuff.
People were going outside
procurement to buy.
Items
It's different in construction,
even in the pioneing and
engineering, you actually have
to have a vision of what you're
doing, what you're repairing, or
what you're building, and you
just don't go out to Walmart and
just purchase, so it takes a lot
longer process, be able to do
this, but in talking with GST,
they just wanted to be able to
have some controls.
I thought a good place to end
was 10 million.
Uh, she was at 6.
I was at 8.
Now we're at 7, but we've agreed
on all the numbers in the bill,
and I got scars to show for it.
Uh, she's very good at what she
does, uh, her job is to oversee.
state monies, taxpayer monies,
and so I think we've done a
really good job in the last 3
years and tried to appease her
and try to find the truly a
middle ground, uh, she's told me
that she doesn't see an.
An increase anytime soon, but if
you look at it, uh, Miss Chaves
was, uh, talking about um a
$1000 square foot in Eunice we
started gymnasium right before
COVID, we signed contracts that
gymnasiums being built
currently.
$300 square foot.
But if you go to Gran Grant and
Gallup, I think over there
they've got facility that is at
$1000 a square foot, and it's
really hard to make up those
kind of changes financially when
you have these caps on there, so
as it was brought up earlier,
um, I misscaters that, you know,
once you hit that cap, you've
got a long period of time of
very little or no use for a
contractor or that agency.
Until you get past that
timeline, so we've adjusted in
the the contract the uh.
The timeline and also the
financial cap, so that helps us,
uh, get to the point that
there's more work that can be
let out.
And that gives Anna Silver the
comfort that she has some
controls in place, so we're just
not running rampant. I had asked
David Chavez to follow up on
that or an accomos covered it.
Oh.
I, I think he's OK with it, so.
That's all I got.
All right, thank you. Before I
go to Senator Sher, I do, um, I
did receive a, a text from our,
uh, assistant county manager
Jonathan Massas down in Boana
County, who is also in strong
support and and also echoes many
of the same concerns about
moving projects forward and how
this is essential. Senator
Sheriff.
Uh
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm
going to support this, no doubt,
but the question is,
Questions.
So architectural and engineering
services.
For a single contract over 4
years, we moved it from 7.5
million to 15 million, so we
doubled that.
I yield to Mister Travis to
explain that piece.
So we
We service um
All of the educational entities
in the state or we have um JPAs
with all the educational
entities as well as cities and
counties.
And then we have a lot of
architectural firms under
contract. So I went to them to
see what those procurement
limits should be, um, both on
the member side and on the
vendor side, and these are the
recommendations that they
proposed to us, and these are
the recommendations that were
presented to state purchasing.
Mr. Senator, uh, if I may, it's
actually on page 3 so that $4
million cap is a different
section, the actual architecture
was in uh the uh page 3 of
starting with Lang.
In $115 million increase from
7.5
in Madam Chair and Senator,
discussed from a discussion that
I had with Senator Word two
years ago on how we get the uh
architectural organizations in
on this so they feel that they
have some room for capabilities
also, so we took their
Their arguments or their
discussion points with us and
rolled it in this bill to
clarify and clear some of their
problems.
that I'm sure I understand. I
just, so that's a, that's a
Do that
That portion of it.
I
So it kind of has a a two-edged
thing. So if you double that,
the stats in itself not drive up
the cost because now the
engineer, hey, we're gonna.
more.
For the architect.
Essentially what that does, it,
it extends the um limits in
terms of what they can do over
uh that extended period of time.
Um, so the single um PO for the
2.5 million, no, no single PO
can exceed that.
And you can't exceed um.
15 million over a four-year
period of time.
Um
So there are limitations in
terms of, in that respect.
So then the flip side of that is
15 million going to be enough.
Because.
We've doubled it right here,
and, and the cost of
dramatically increased all
across the whole world. So 15
gonna be enough next year.
Um, and then the same with the,
uh, infant.
Definite
How long you can do it for 10
years or more.
Um
the total is 12.
$12.5 million to $30 million I
got that too.
And so that means you can over
10 years as, as an architect,
you can only make $30 million.
for one company, no matter what
you do for the state.
So those limits are, you're
correct, there are a single,
single PO may not now exceed if
if currently it's 4 million, so
you a single PO may not exceed 4
million, and you cannot exceed
12.5 million in the aggregate.
That's what it is currently in
place. So what is being proposed
is the 7.5 million on a single
purchase order and 30 million
over a period of, I think the
language reads.
10 years.
OK
And that that may be somewhat
inhibitive if it truly means
that um you have to wait 10
years before you can re-solicit,
um, our practice is in in it's
yes that we resolicit every 3
years because it does two
things. One, it provides uh
continued capacity for vendors
and then secondly, it provides
an opportunity for those vendors
that did not have an opportunity
to solicit initially.
To solicit um
Quicker than that 10-year period
would would allow them to.
Adam Jarrett want a job where I
can get $30 million.
Yeah.
I want a job where I'm limited
to $30 million.
Thank you.
Uh, any other questions or
comments from the committee.
What is the will of the
committee?
have chairs, he mumbled quicker
than you.
So we'll have you as a second.
The Senator Sanchez and then
segmented by Senator Ramos. Is
there anybody in opposition to
this DuP pass motion? no. Let's
go ahead and list all those in
these uh in attendance in
affirmative, you have a 10 to 0
to pass.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you members of
the committee.
Right? So we have Senator
Brandt's, uh, Senate Bill 455.
This is a GRT bill, so we will
hold that, but we're getting it
right in time to hopefully
consider for a tax package.
Fingers crossed.
Subcommittee, we will, um, hear
public testimony if needed, we
will, uh, ask questions, but
this will be a bill that we will
hold.
Senator Brand, it's all yours.
Thank you, madam. It's good to
be back before this committee,
um, I've got a
receipts, tax deduction bill
here for coinsurance, so if
you're like on an 80/20 plan and
you're paying the 20% yourself,
um, right now we charge grocery
seats tax on that, and so this
would take that away. We're
trying to get all the taxes off
of medical.
But my
Expert introduced herself and of
course you all know Charlie.
Madam Chair and committee, my
name is Dana Gray, executive
director of Desert State
Physical Therapy Network,
representing 30 independent
private practices throughout the
state.
Charlie, did you need to make
any comments?
If you will just make sure you
identify yourself, Madam Chair,
Charlie Marcus registered
lobbyist for Desert states
physical therapy Network.
Uh, this was brought on because
last year there was a bill
passed by Senator Morris.
Senate Bill 36. It was amended.
It was then taken into the
omnibus tax bill.
And when that happened, the
amendment didn't make it with
it.
And so all we're doing is coming
back and putting that back in
there.
Thank you so much. All right,
now we're going to the audience,
uh, those in the audience by a
show of hands, uh, uh, raise
your hands if you're in support
of this bill.
But I saw one in the back, was
that
No? OK, you're getting a little
excited about another bill.
That's what happens in this
committee. There's excitement
all around.
Anybody in opposition?
See no anybody online? Right,
now we go to the committee.
Thank you very much. Nobody
online for the record.
Any questions or comments from
the committee.
Madam Chair, my only question
is, can you just elaborate a
little further on what happened?
Was it, did you say 2024 or 2023
when it was left out of the
It was in 2024.
And was it
Exactly how this bill is written
now. That is correct.
And we've also run this by the
Secretary of Taxation and
Revenue.
And she supports it.
OK, that's all.
work. I think that was a little
confused because I thought that
the
I thought the 2023 tax package
one that.
Where this was signed. This was
one of the things that Senator
Brandt negotiated with the
governor
Yeah, it's the 2023.
Senator Moors.
I don't think we did. Senator
Morris didn't do one again.
You're correct.
And so the and so the
amendments.
I'm also curious, how did the
amendment not get it?
Just a little bit, so it was
adopted here, but it didn't go
into the
That that's correct, uh, Madam
Chair, Senator Worth.
So this was more of a a a record
keeping error that.
As this effect.
Other questions or comments from
the committee, Senator Figaro.
Thank you, Madam Chair, in
reading the for the FIR um
This will be a 25 $26 million
hit.
To the local government.
With 7 million hold harmless,
though.
They'll end up about 18 million.
I chair Senator, that's, that's
what the FIR says. I'll have to
trust him on that one, getting
into those.
details is not my repertoire.
Um, but
Anytime you
suspend GRT on something, you
have two effects. You have one
on the general fund for, for us
and one on the local funds
because that's where they get
much of their, their funds.
You know, I think it's a policy
decision that we have to make as
a legislature.
Whether or not we want medical,
medical expenses to have taxes.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
So just out of curious, is there
anybody in here from the
municipal League?
Anyone online from the municipal
League, if you are, please raise
your hand.
There's, there's a a.
on this, this
There should be some
conversation for anybody.
OK, might be some conversations.
Nice for them, and work, uh,
just a follow up question I'm
sure I know there's another
proposal that Senator Steinborn
has to eliminate the GRT for all
medical if that, if that were
included, would that include
this?
Madam Chair and senator is my
understanding um co-insurance
has been added to that bill.
Copays and deductibles are
already deductible for
healthcare. It's just the
co-insurance part that is not.
And I sing that just.
That bill also has a massive
Impact on local government. So
one option is for us to just
To the
Seduction or exemption,
whichever it is, or the state
portion.
which we've done before.
That way the local, because I'm
really concerned that that's a
$7 million hit to Santa Fe. I
think it's a 20+ million dollar
hit to Albuquerque.
Um
So
We've got, we've gotten
ourselves in a world of trouble.
trying to do hold harmless ilful
Janetti.
realized that when the food tax
was taken off and it was
represented that that was
revenue neutral. It was like,
OK, well, let's just be sure.
Put them old armless on and it's
been a mess after for 20 years
ever since, so.
And I don't think old harmless
is a good way to go. Uh,
although I did discuss with you,
you'll appreciate this, madam
chair. It's good that I did
discuss with Senator Steinborn
since uh Las Cruces, both the
city and county imposed the 3
8s, and they're getting a whole
harmless payment, you know, we
could impose the, we could
reallocate the impact on local
governments for those that have
opted into the uh 38 center
signboard didn't like that too
much, but that, you know, that
would be a, a fair way to do it.
I sponsor on that bill, so um.
Yeah, so I don't think that will
happen. That's right, Senator
Bran they're like, oh boy.
Anyway, just those issues,
discussion.
Thank you. Any other questions
or comments from the committee?
All right, so we got a lot to
chew on. Thank you very much,
Senator Brant. Appreciate that.
Look, look forward to seeing
what you come up with and if you
can help me find, you know, the
money for you to come up with,
that'd be great too. We're,
we're all hoping for that. Thank
you very much. All right, now we
go to
Senator Maestas.
And then I know I saw Senator,
uh, Representative Herndon
around here, she might be
outside waiting, but
Right.
Players center my Madam Chair,
honorable members, thank you so
much. This is Senate Bill 377.
It is a New Mexico United
license plate bill in New Mexico
United, as you know, is the
United, uh, soccer league soccer
club from here in New Mexico. It
was founded in 2018 in its
inaugural season, Madam Chair,
led the league in attendance
with close to 13,000 spectators
each season. The last 4 seasons
it's been in the top 2 or the
top 4 in attendance nationally.
uh include such cities as
Detroit, Miami, Pittsburgh,
Tampa Bay, and Louisville back
east and the Western Conference,
uh, El Paso, Las Vegas, hated
Phoenix, uh, San Antonio, and
Sacramento. um.
The license plate will not, uh,
Be different. It will be the
classic black background with
the yellow with the uh
Uh, the letters in yellow, and
as you know, it's a 5-year
program and at the end of the 5
years, if, if, uh, the license
plates diminish in popularity,
it will be discontinued. It will
pay for itself as the United
fans will pay a $50 extra fee to
have the specialized plate, so
it will be a great way to
promote um New Mexico with our
top uh.
Professional team. I'm joined
Madam Chair, by David Weiss
Carl. He's the vice president of
Media and Impact for New Mexico
United. Please welcome my
expert.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Senators, thank you for having
me here today. New Mexico, we're
we're proud to be New Mexico's
professional soccer team, been
around since 2019, our inaugural
season in as, as Senator Maestta
said, uh, every single year
since that time we've been in
the top 3 in attendance despite
being in the 2nd smallest market
in the entire USL championship
by population. So, uh, the pride
of New Mexican fans is is
unmatched. Our, our mission
statement as an organization is
to bring New Mexicans together
in ways they've never been
brought together before and to
be an agent of positive change
in New Mexico, you may notice
that it does not include
anything about soccer there. We
love soccer. Soccer is the
medium. Season 7 starts tonight.
We take on Sacramento on the
road. We're going to win. Um,
but, uh, our, our primary goal
is to bring New Mexicans
together and and a secondary
goal is to show the world what
New Mexicans can achieve when we
come together. Uh, we've
achieved that in in the way that
Senator Maestas mentioned there,
which is again being one of the
top teams in attendance every
single year, despite being one
of the smallest market. Uh,
we've achieved it by being the
only team at the USLL that fully
scholarships our academy program
because your ability to play
soccer as a kid shouldn't be
based on how much money your
parents have. Uh, we've also
achieved that, um, in a lot of
different ways by offering free
clinics for kids around the
state and each one of your
districts, um, for, for kids who
want to explore the game for the
very first time. Uh, like I
said, our, our team and New
Mexicans are unmatched. Uh,
we're very proud of our fans.
They travel like no other. Uh,
we think that they'll have these
license plates on their cars and
and show
the world, uh, what New Mexicans
can achieve and what we're made
of. So, um, the proceeds from
this uh license plate, the
special license plate will also
go towards uh the state tourism
department who also does an
incredible job of making sure
that people know what New Mexico
is all about. Uh, so again,
we're proud to stand behind this
and and would be available for
questions.
OK, thank you.
All righty. So by show of hands,
are there folks in the audience
in support of this bill?
We have 4. Are there any folks
in the audience that are in
opposition of this belt?
Anybody online?
We have one in support. All
right, so we're just gonna go
ahead, um, please let the person
online know. Thank you very
much. We'll have 3 of you come
up if you want, uh, to go ahead
and speak on your support.
Or we can just don't all jump to
the microphone at once.
Pardon?
We'll just, so since he's the
only one, so we're just gonna
hear from this fella.
You'll get one minute and then
we'll go to the committee.
There's a, yeah, that'll be that
microphones on. Madam Chair,
members of the committee.
Man, uh, my name is William
Faris and I'm a retired computer
scientist here in Santa Fe and a
constituent of, uh, Senator
Worth.
I just wanted to say I support
United, and I will buy one of
these plates. I look forward to
you passing this bill. Thank
you.
We'll let Lisa speak.
She's a diehard fan.
Madam chair, members of the
committee. My name is Lisa
Maxwell. I'm the minority
analyst here, and I stand in
support of this bill because
soccer did not come to my high
school until 2 years after I
played.
Or after I graduated and but it
came two years later through
adult soccer league and I played
from the age of 19 to 29, and I
played coed and I had to be on
the field cause it was, you had
to have at least one woman and
I, I was always the one woman
out there. I actually broke my
leg on my first month and I
still went out to practice and
play, so I'm in support of this
bill. Soccer is a big thing in
our area in our state too.
Thank you.
Thank you so much. So Senator,
you're welcome to respond to
public testimony or we can go
ahead and go to the committee.
Committee, any other questions
or comments?
That had to be. Well, Madam
Chair, I see you're trying to
show up my lowrider capital of
the world,
but in all honesty, I wanna
thank United for coming to rural
northern New Mexico. You come up
to the Tierra Maria Chama area,
and it's the first time those
kids have ever played or
experienced soccer, and they
talk about it so much so that I
had a few parents who wrote and
asked me to support the license
plate. So the impact on having
the team come to rural northern
New Mexico is having an impact
on students and I wanted to
thank you for that. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you so much, Senator had a
meal. Senator Sheriff.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Every year we get a new
For many new license plate
bills.
Many license plates do we have
now, do you know?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator,
there's a bunch of statutes, but
not of very many in production
because we tweaked the statute
thanks to Smokey Bear a couple
of years back where after 5
years, uh,
The uh
The, the department of
transportation looks at how many
is being purchased and they, and
they cut.
They cut the program down, so
they're still in statute, but
there's about maybe, gosh, 15 or
so license plates still in
statute. I think there's about.
6 or 8 that are still available.
And so after 5 years, if this,
after 5 years if we put another
couple license plates on the
books after 5 years of
After each year they get cut in
that way it uh.
The top 5 or 6 stay alive.
Madam Chair, one of the concerns
is, is that we make
bunch of license plates, and
then we sell a couple dozen of
them.
We sell a couple dozen.
Uh
And it doesn't, you know, Smokey
Bear or whatever.
Uh, there's a handful that
That really have a lot of
use
A wildlife one, for example.
Uh, Senator Worth, he's got like
5 of them stuck on his car or
something.
But uh
But there's so many others, uh,
I don't think I've ever actually
seen a smoky bear one, and
that's only 3 years old, I
think.
Um, maybe they're all in Lincoln
County.
But uh
So let's just how many of these
are we gonna make and how many
of these are we going to sell
and I know we don't know either
one of those, but, but that's
always been a concern, you're
gonna make several 100 sell.
a couple of dozen.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator,
share the, you're right, that we
would have to purchase a batch
of 100, uh, and then, uh.
They would pay for themselves,
assuming you sell those 100, but
I think United has such a
fantastic communication system.
Would you like to comment on how
would, how would you market
these uh license plates.
Absolutely, uh, Madam Chair,
Senator, absolutely. We have,
uh, as we mentioned earlier, we
have the 2nd highest last season
attendance in entirety of the
USL championship and in big
markets like Pittsburgh and
Sacramento and and the like. And
and so our fandom is is is
unmatched with that said, uh, we
do have a very robust
communication system that
includes large email campaigns,
text messages.
Uh, we have two separate, uh,
television deals with, with
local television stations, one
in English, one in Spanish. Um,
we have a robust social media
following, um, while I obviously
I cannot guarantee the number of
purchases. I feel very confident
that our fans, many of whom are
watching online right now, um,
would be very much in support
and be willing to purchase
these. I know I'm going to go
out and spend some money on it.
Right, Madam Chair, and so it's
$12 for the license plate, 50
total, but 38 goes to tourism
Department of Tourism.
And what do we expect them to do
with the $38.
Madam chair share, good
question. I think if we sold
1000, it would be approximately
$38,000 to tourism, and they
would uh.
It could go to to TV
advertisements or, or billboards
in, in um airports, things of
that nature, we just bolster
their, their tourism budget.
All right. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Senator Sanchez.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator for bringing the bill.
Um,
So I don't think I've ever
replaced my license.
And there's a lot of great
license, you know, when you buy
a new car, you put your license.
So
Madam Chair and Senator.
What's the process, you say, OK,
I want this license plate. You
gotta go back to the MBD wait in
that long line.
You know,
Tell me the process of how I
would get one of these licenses.
Thank you, Madam Chair,
convinced me you're gonna go
with me and we're gonna get it
at the same time I will stand in
line with you. The lines are
quick. MBD is super efficient,
um, so you would purchase it
just like any other plate. You
literally would walk in there,
give your registration, your ID
address, things of that nature,
and then you just say, hey, I
want a united plate, and they,
they.
the extra, you pay the uh the
fee, the normal license plate
fee with an extra $50 for the
United plate.
Senator, Senator, uh, if I may,
Senator Sanchez, Senator Werth
might have something else to add
to this. So I just, I just put a
Fishing played on. I did it
online. It took me 2 minutes.
Oh, and I just picked up my
registration. It cost me 28
bucks and it was there within a
week.
Madam, so you can do it online
and then you just mail in your
other plate or you throw it away
or put it up on the wall, put up
on the wall, it goes in your man
cave, Senator Sanchez. I'm gonna
have to get a man cave too, OK,
all right.
I gotta go play down a man.
Well, maybe with the state
architectural and engineering
contracts you might be able to
make that happen there too
questions about state law
requires you to send it back,
uh, so every time you're in a
buddy's garage, take note.
We won't say a word.
Uh, any other questions from the
committee.
What is the will of the
committee,
Madam Chair, we have a Dus from
Senator Berns. Do we have a
second?
seconds from Senator Figueroa.
Anybody in opposition to the Du
Pas motion.
see them, if you will please
record all in favor. You have a
10 to 0 due pass.
Thank you very much. We have um
Representative Herndon, and I
believe, I don't know if Senator
Worth, if you're co-sponsoring
this with Representative
defendants. You're gonna sit up
here on the day, OK, so
representative Herndon, we are
talking about uh House Bill 66
Workers' compensation changes.
The
So Representative, welcome to
the committee.
Thank you, madam just to give
you a background, you've been in
my committees before. We will
have a 10-minute presentation on
your bill, uh, which also
includes your expert. Then what
we will do is we will go to uh
audience participation. They
will go ahead and have to take
that comment both in the room
and online. Afterwards, you have
5 minutes to respond to that if
you'd like, or we can just go
straight to the committee. So
I'll ask you that after that.
But uh you are welcome to start.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, we are bringing a
bipartisan bill before this body
that increases access to justice
for workers.
House bill, House Judiciary
substitute, committee substitute
for House Bill 66, is also a
bill that represents a
compromise negotiated with
insurance companies, the
workers' compensation
Administration and workers
who've been injured while at
work.
Madam's here, I'm also proud
that much of what is presented
in this legislation started with
the task force that met over the
past year. I'm proud that a
group of attorneys, workers, the
workers' compensation commission
and the insurance companies came
together to the table to work
together to get us to this space
today.
Now, Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
House Judiciary Committee
substitute for House Bill 66
accomplishes two things. One, it
increased the statutory fees for
attorneys that had not been
adjusted for 13 years. And
second, it increases the
discovery fees so that doctors
are adequately reimbursed for
the professional expertise they
provide in workers' compensation
cases. That's it, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, just
those two things, and Madame
here, I would like to introduce
my expert for today. Please
introduce yourself.
Madam Chair, my name is Pete
White. I'm a worker's attorney.
Uh, I've done workers'
compensation for 32 years and
Uh, I'm honored to be asked to
be the expert before you today,
and I stand for any questions.
Great, thank you so much. We
appreciate that. Um, by show of
hands, who in the audience is in
support of this legislation?
123.
All right. Anybody in opposition
of this legislation.
No recorded. Anybody online?
All right, so we're gonna go
ahead and let the three of you,
if you will, come on up.
And will take care of you and uh
we will give you one minute
apiece. The vice chair will time
you, uh, at about 30 seconds,
you'll see a 32nd sign, if you
will, that will start to, to
wrap that up. Go ahead, Madam
Chair, committee, uh, my name is
William Kedney. I am a
professional healthcare
provider. I got sick in 2020.
Uh, I got COVID working in at
the employer of a hospital, and
to this day, I am still in
litigation with them.
With my illness.
Not only was I comatose for
several months at University of
Texas Tech.
But I was my insurance was
canceled while I was on that.
Um, I stand in support of this
because my attorney, I had to
get an attorney, has been
working on this for 5 years and
going on 6.
And all I can tell you is it is
absolutely horrible, what I've
gone through. It is a mess, and
these attorneys need to be on
level ground to deal with these
insurance companies. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Good morning, Madam Chair. My
name is Emma O'Sullivan for the
New Mexico Center on Law and
Poverty. We thank the sponsor
for this bill. We stand in
support of this bill because
workers' compensation, the
workers' compensation system is
a vital safety net that promote
that protects thousands of
workers from the economic
hardships created by medical
bills, lost wages and other
costs that a worker incurs after
a workplace injury. Yet many
workers that suffer these
injuries who have paid into the
workers' compensation system
never obtained the benefits of
that system, partly because of
the lack of incentive for
private attorneys.
to take those cases by
increasing attorneys' fees, this
bill would help more workers
receive the support they need by
increasing the amount that
employers may pay in discovery
costs, the spill levels the
playing field between workers
and employers trying to offset
some of the advantage employers
often have because they have
more financial resources. This
bill is good for New Mexico's
workers and ensures a more
equitable system for, for
workers' compensation. For these
reasons, we support this bill
and we ask that you vote, do
pass. Thank you.
Thank you so much, uh,
representative, you have an
opportunity to respond if you'd
like, or we can go ahead and go
straight to the committee. Um,
Madam Chair, would you please go
to the committee? All right,
thank you very much. Are there
questions or comments or
concerns about this from the
committee.
Senator Figueroa.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, sponsor for the bill.
I appreciate the collaboration
and all the stakeholders at the
table and how long you have
worked on this bill. Um, Madam
Chair, my question is about the
House Memorial 83 Task Force and
their report, and if the report,
according to the FIR indicated
that these things needed to be
raised and suggested, for
example, the 3000 for discovery
be raised to 3500, which
The bill does, but then the bill
also plans ahead and increases
it to 4000 in 2027, 4500 in
2029.
So I'm wondering why you chose
to go beyond the report of the
memorial.
And why you chose to do it this
way instead of say attaching it
to CPI.
Madame Chair, members of the
committee, thank you for and
represent, uh, I'm sorry,
senator Figueroa.
So what we did, uh, and sitting
down and collaboration with
everyone. We didn't want to
make, we did not want to have 13
years to go by again before
there was a time when we were
looking at these costs that were
engaged and involved in the
items that we're looking at
today.
Looking at the CPI, CPI did not
seem to be a very stable way to
go among the people sitting at
the table, so we chose to look
at a more defined direct way to
come forth for the next few
years and coming up with an
amount. So you're looking at
only a 6% increase, uh, next
year, a 7% increase after that.
And then everybody comes back to
the table looking at
evidence-based information on
how we should proceed after
that.
Thank you. And then Madam Chair,
we don't have to look at it
again until 2042, right?
Yeah.
Uh, Senator Wirth next. Thank
you, Madam Chair. I'm happy to
be in the Senate sponsor on this
bill, and I just, I do think it
would be helpful though
representative, and for your
experts since he's here and
practices in this area. Just
give the committee a sense of
kind of how we got to this point
where the workers' comp system.
With attorney's fees.
That with this cap which is.
Very different than certainly
what I'm used to. I think it
would be helpful, kind of put
that in perspective.
Which to me
Really justifies what's
happening in the bill.
Madam Chair, thank you, Senator
Worth. Uh, I began practicing
while 32 years ago, and that was
just
Just shortly after the 1990
workers' Compensation Act was
passed before that time, every
worker's compensation claim was
handled in the district courts
and attorneys made a lot of
money.
So I heard uh representing
workers in those cases, um, and
there was an apparent crisis in
the insurance back then, they,
they formed the workers'
compensation Administration to
control costs, and part of that
was to put a cap on attorneys'
fees which started out at
$12,500. At that time, uh, the
lawyers representing workers
disappeared in droves and uh
But even back then, there were
about twice as many attorneys
representing workers is now, so
a certain number stayed on, but
that's how it started, uh, and
then there were increases, the
last increase was 13 years ago,
and since that time,
Really, the number of attorneys
who were willing to represent
workers has gone down to the
point where there are
approximately only 33.
Doing it now and most of those
are in Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
I think there are only 4
attorneys outside in rural areas
who represent workers, so it
really is, it has become an
access to just justice problem.
Uh, it's just very difficult for
a worker to find an attorney and
then the way the system works,
uh
A worker who is found to have a
compensable claim has a
lifetime, uh,
Right to seek medical benefits,
which means he has a lifetime to
fight.
medical benefits if there's ever
an issue once the attorney fee
cap is reached in that
particular worker's claim, he
can never uh ask for more
attorneys' fees to be awarded,
so it's very, very difficult for
workers who have complicated
cases who have serious injuries
to even find the attorneys.
And just one more thing, ma'am
here. So basically, I mean, are
you billing on an hourly basis
up to the cap. I noticed in the
FIR there were just a limited
number.
of cases above the cap and then
what happened? I mean, again,
you kind of said it's.
I mean, if you reach the cap.
What do you do when you reach
the cabin, how do you deal with
that?
Thank you, uh, Madam Chairman,
Senator Wirth.
So
It's not many cases that reached
the cap of their smaller cases
and typically a lawyer will
charge 10% of the benefit
received by the worker. So a
worker receives $10,000 on a
small claim work with attorney
will get 1000 from the worker,
1000 from the employer insurer,
same uh but uh
Hourly is is another aspect for
longer cases, workers' attorneys
keep track of their hours and
can build if a case is
complicated, goes through
depositions, goes to trial.
Those are the type of cases that
can reach the cap.
In, in a couple of years,
usually or a year. So, um,
The judge, the judge always has
discretion on what a feature to
award, so they have that, and
they have to make sure that the
workers achieved the benefit for
the lawyer to get a fee, but
once once the cap is reached,
that's it.
I hope that answers your
question.
Madam Cherry does, and I just
for the non
Lawyers on the committee.
And I appreciate a ton that
you're
Willing to do this kind of work,
just to understand that this is
part of a
Compromise 35 years ago.
Um, and so it just seems only
right that we're slightly
adjusting the.
the fees here and I'm saying I
appreciate representative that
it went through the process of
having the task force. I've got
to build a session that did the
same thing and
So you immediately go, oh, we
need to send this into the
interim. Well, this came from
the interim.
This came from all the work and
everyone's sitting at the table.
This feels like this is a
Reasonable compromise that still
is gonna have a situation where
you're gonna hit that.
That doesn't mean you're not
gonna the cap's not gonna still
be there. The cap is still
there, so it's just a little
more room.
Thank you Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Worth. Any
other questions or comments from
the committee?
See none. What is the will of
the committee? I'll move to pass
pass from Senator Wirth.
We have that from Senator
Bergmans. Why don't we go ahead
and take the boat, if you will.
Senator Figueroa, yes.
Senator Jamil.
Senator O'Malley.
Senator Paul.
Senator Ramos? No.
Senator Sanchez.
Senator.
Senator Wirth, yes, Senator
Bergman's, yes, Senator Camp.
Yes.
Yeah
That they do pass, you have a do
pass representative on a 6 to 4
vote.
Thank you, Madam Chair and the
Senate Judiciary, which you've
given up the chair preview, so.
Like treating chair who?
Yeah,
Senator Cervantes, you're up
next with your son Bill 318.
We'll take your water. We won't
take your snow. It'll melt by
noon.
That's right.
Good morning. Thank you very
much
I hope you'll find discussion
about uh Senate Bill 318. Senate
Bill 318 is principally a
modifications to what is
referred to in Mexico law as the
unfair trade Practices Act. This
is a law that was adopted
initially, interestingly to deal
with use auto sales, the back,
back at the time when there was
a practice of roll rolling back
odometers and uh that that led
to something uh that you have in
front of you, which is the
unfair trade practices that it's
essentially the, the soul of our
protection laws in the state of
New Mexico, so it provides
remedies against deceptive,
misleading advertising,
marketing and sales practices.
Earlier in the session, we
passed a law to make it unlawful
to possess a weapon conversion
device, a plot switch is the
common example of one of these
weapon conversion devices and we
attached the possession of those
that the purpose of this bill
principally is to attack the
manufactured and sales of these
types of weapon conversion
devices online, and so, uh, the
bill does a number of things,
but it, it defines and provides
a number of definitions that
relate to weapons and weapon
conversion devices.
You'll see that uh pretty
extensively discussing the bill,
adding the, the weapon
components, but you'll also see
language in there that addresses
principally jurisdiction and
this will be an interesting
discussion for all of us because
I know this this will probably
generate, generate some of the
opposition to the bill.
What the opposition will not
want to acknowledge the fact
that um I bought some things
today online, many of you all
probably shop a lot online
anytime you go onto Amazon or
buy anything else, uh, we're all
in a new kind of marketplace,
and the issue is whether you or
I as a purchaser in the state of
New Mexico who buys things
online can bring suit against
the seller of the product.
Um, when New Mexico used to have
law that suggested that by
maintaining a registered agent
alone in the state of New
Mexico. That was enough of
consent by a foreign
corporation. We say foreign need
to mean uh corporation from
another state that's in the
legal parlance, so we'll say
foreign corporation doesn't mean
a foreign company necessarily in
a foreign country but rather
just a foreign state.
And in New Mexico, the law used
to be that if a foreign
corporation had a registered
agent and many of them did here
for accepting service of process
and otherwise, that was a
consent to New Mexico courts for
jurisdiction.
We had a recent case decided uh
that the court said that that
alone is not enough to have a
registered agent is not enough.
There had to be New Mexico law
that essentially said we're
accepting or we're um
essentially
Requiring jurisdiction of the
state of New Mexico over people
who sell products into the state
of New Mex even though it's
online. And so, part, part of
this bill and I think uh
substantial part of the
opposition is going to come from
those who are going to maintain
that you mentioned the courts
should not have jurisdiction
simply because they're selling
their products to New Mexico
online, uh, using an online um
um marketplace and and um that
will be an interesting part of
the discussion. I think it's
something we should adopt and
accept.
is the fact that we're, we're
living in that kind of world
right now. If somebody sells a
product online, it comes in and
stadium next when it causes harm
and principally again here a gun
conversion device that that
company should be a susceptible
to being brought into New Mexico
court and I'm using guns as an
example, but this will apply
broadly to any number of other
products that could cause harm
to New Mexicans and uh the fact
that they're availing themselves
of our market, our citizens,
making a profit and again, I
have no criticism of them.
Do any of those things, but to
suggest that they shouldn't be
subject to New Mexico courts or
remedies of New Mexicans here in
their home, uh, jurisdiction. I
think ignores the realities of
how we now buy things and how,
how the marketplace works, so
this is a a novel.
I shouldn't say novel. I don't,
I don't think it's really novel,
but it is a, is it a recognition
really of the novel way that we
now shop and buy things and I, I
buy most of my things now online
as well too.
So, uh, you'll see that language
in the bill as well. The other
thing that the bill principally
does is increase the penalties,
statutory penalties. Uh, we
haven't done that in decades and
the reality is that because of
the unfair trade practices Act
and the way it was originally
organized, we put in statutory
penalties and put in recovery of
attorneys' fees.
Recovering the transuse is
unusual for us in the law. We
don't usually do things like
that, but there are some rare
instances. The best example is
civil rights.
Uh, we, we offer recover the
train's fees when a claim is
brought based on gender
discrimination or race
discrimination because the
damages are relatively
inconsequential and there
wouldn't be enough motivation
for people or lawyers to bring
cases for civil rights
violations. The unfair trade
practices Act from its inception
did the same thing. It said,
look, if you're suing for
somebody rolling back an
odometer and a used car, the
damage might be a few $1000 but
we want to discourage the
practice so aggressively that we
want to provide for a statutory
penalty. We put in an amount of
damages in the statute and say
you're either gonna get this
minimum amount of statutory
damages or the actual damages,
and then we further encourage
the, the uh representation by a
boarding for legal fees. So
those are the principal
components of the bill. There's
a lot in here. Uh, I look
forward to your questions and I
hope you all don't stump me.
And I'm looking around for an
expert. I don't know it's going
to the Senate Judiciary
Committee after this, so you got
your chances there. Yeah, those
guys and they're really cranky
these days. I gotta tell you,
they were up late last night
late, late night sessions.
Uh, so by show of hands, uh,
anybody in the audience in
support of this legislation.
To that we have 2, anybody in
opposition of this legislation.
123. All right, unwind.
One opposition. All right, we're
gonna hear, uh, to, just if
you'll let the person know
online that we're recording that
their opposition will get their
name if you'll get their name,
but we're just gonna go ahead
and stick right now to testimony
in the room.
So if I can get those in support
and then following that, you
each have one minute, the vice
chair will time you. She'll show
you a 32nd sign letting you know
when you have 30 seconds to wrap
up.
You will go ahead and Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
I'm Meredith Main, and I'm
speaking on behalf of the League
of Women Voterss of New Mexico
and the American Association of
University Women, and this is a
common sense, um, proposal. I
mean, it brings us in line when
we're buying so many things
online, we've got to make sure
that um that those vendors are
held accountable to New Mexico
law and uh we really appreciate
the work of the
sponsor, and I urge you to
support it. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Drew Setter, registered
lobbyist for the Giffords
Gunines Prevention Group, and we
stand in support of the
legislation. We appreciate the
sponsor bringing this forward.
We've been working with him on
this issue for a couple of
years. Thank you.
All right, thank you so much.
Uh, those in opposition, if you
will, we'll give you one minute
as well. I do want to recognize
online, uh, Renzo Soto and
Alison Riley, who are both in
opposition, uh, Renzo and Alison
will record that opposition,
but, uh, we're gonna go ahead
and just hold on to testimony
here in the room right now. So
we do have that recorded. Thank
you very much. Go ahead. Good
morning, Madam Chair and members
of the committee. I'm Larry
Sontag. I'm part of the Better
Together New Mexico Advocacy
Network. I'm also an Air Force
veteran, nuclear weapons.
security specialist and a
veteran from the Albuquerque
Police Department, so I have a
lot of interest in firearms and
weapons. This bill broadly
redefines destructive devices,
firearms, and other parts and
ammunition.
Though intended to expand
consumer protections, these
vague and sweeping changes could
have serious consequences for
law abiding gun over gun owners
like myself and the firearms
industry here in New Mexico.
By expanding government
oversight and enabling lawsuits
against manufacturers and
dealers. This bill creates
unnecessary barriers to firearm
ownership, commerce, and
potentially violates Supreme
Court precedents protecting
access to commonly used
firearms. Thank you.
Me to members of the committee,
my name's Keith Gardner. Lobby's
for the National Shooting Sports
Foundation with a trade group,
trade industry for the firearms
industry, um, in the country
and, and it, there's several
things that's uh the senator and
I have spoken about. This is a
big comprehensive bill, so admit
it's kind of tough to talk
about, but I'll go to the
highlights of that concerns um
my folks. And number one,
obviously the vague language.
When you use words like may or
tend to be misleading. There's
not any specifics to that and so
to be able to actually put that
in as a part of a lawsuit,
especially.
When you insent at this point
going from 5000 to $250,000. Um,
the incentive for certain
attorneys to go after those
things significantly changes.
Also, I'll say that um one of
the things really concerning is
one doesn't even have to be
harmed to actually demonstrate
or or bring forward and finally,
the really important for both
the farms and non-fims. If you
look at the remedies for a
frivolously placed lawsuit and
recovery, they changed the
standards. It changes the
standard by which
someone who's received on the
back end of a frivolous lawsuit
by which they can recover
attorneys' fees. That's a
significant change in this piece
of legislation that will harm,
uh, everyday New Mexicans. Thank
you, man.
Thank you so much.
Um, madam chair, members of the
committee, Senator. My name's
William Fireri and I'm a retired
computer scientist here in Santa
Fe and a constituent of Senator
Worth. I stand oppose this bill.
SB 318 singles out in New Mexico
firearms businesses for special
treatment by setting exorbitant
penalties beyond all other
businesses. This is not fair. We
learned in the 2023 session that
it drives up liability insurance
rates to unaffordable levels for
all providers similar to what is
happening with our healthcare
providers.
Federal firearms licensees are
our first line of defense
against illegal gun use. We do,
we don't want to put them out of
the business. SB 318 also
encourages private party, uh,
third party lawsuits by
organizations that have not been
personally harmed by an alleged
violation. This is a tactic
pioneered in other states
against women's health care
providers. Please don't
encourage this in New Mexico. I
urge you to delete section 7
paragraphs C and D and restore
this bill to an even.
Handed update to our consumer
protection laws. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you so much. Uh, Senator
Cervantes, you do have 5 minutes
if you'd like to respond to
public testimony or we can go
right to the committee. Thank
you, Madam Chair. So the notion
that this bill has anything to
do with attacking women's right
to healthcare is absurd. I don't
know where the uh opponent would
be referring to any part of this
bill. This is not in any way
attaching the weapons that
access to healthcare and I think
the committee knows well that I
wouldn't be supporting anything
of the kind. The, the reference
to damages, uh, Mr. Gardner's
point, you'll see on pages 16
and 17, realized that
what he left out was the
qualification that that damage
is only imposed if a person is
aware of an unfair deceptive
practice in the marketing
manufacture and distribution of
a firearm, um, and the, in in
that case, you have to show that
level of, of knowing uh and
unfairness of the practice.
What's interesting about this is
that Congress long ago exempted
gun manufacturers from
liability, which, again, I
really can't begin to conceive,
but they did so. However,
Congress also
But it's not discussed often is
Congress also put exemptions to
that immunity. So gun
manufacturers are generally
immune from liability for the
products they put into the
marketplace and that in and of
itself is highly unusual.
Put a pinto in your Ford Motor
Company out on the road, you're
liable for putting the gas tank
in a place where the explodes.
Is, we, we have all examples of
products throughout time.
And I'll, and I'll take a moment
to point out the fact that uh I
know that travelers are often
maligned in the in the building
and just, just remember
something that 10 years ago, we
probably remember picking up the
paper all the time and seeing
rollover accidents where tires
were exploding and people were
being killed.
Um, you don't hear about those
anymore. Why? Because there were
a lot of lawsuits and those
lawsuits led to the things we
all now have on our vehicles,
anti-rollover technology, better
tires, uh, stabilization
systems. We don't hear about
those SUVs rolling over anymore.
The same way we don't hear about
cars being um exploding because
of location of gas tanks for all
the malignment of trial lawyers
from time to time the lawsuits
that we bring lead to change in
industry, lead to change in
design and technology, and I
think I, I, as a lawyer, I'm
proud to be part of that change.
over time. So the goal here is
to have gun manufacturers use
the latest and greatest
technology to assure their guns
are not converted, uh, we, we,
we've made it illegal again the
possession of a clock switch,
but we don't talk about the fact
that the guns are designed so
they can be modified, so they
can be clock switched, uh, so
that somebody can get a 3D
printer here at home, go home
and in 10 minutes convert their
weapon into an automatic weapon
and if you haven't seen uh uh
Glock, uh, firing 30 or 40
rounds in a matter of 2 or 3
seconds, you, you.
You should see it. You should go
online and watching YouTube,
watching somebody try to control
a handgun discharging that that
kind of ammunition, a matter of
a second or two. So, uh, we're
trying to make sure that the
manufacturers manufacture their
guns so they can't be converted.
And that really is the issue
and, and the congressional
exemption that said that we're
going to immune gun manufacturer
says they're not immune if
there's a specific state law
that addresses something
specific as, as in this case and
that's the goal here is to fit
within that congressional
immunity where Congress said,
we're going to immunize gun
impact your.
but not under certain
circumstances. We believe this
bill allows us to do that and by
breaking lawsuits against gun
manufacturers, I think we're
gonna solve some of the problem.
I know I've gone more than 5
minutes, but just a little bit
more, madam, uh, uh, the
gentleman said, I bought a guy
online. I'm a gun owner. Um,
I've been a gun owner my whole
life and I've bought guns
online, um, and, um, I take
advantage of the marketplace. I
don't think the manufacturers
should be able to sell a gun to
a dealer here in town. I have to
go through a dealer, of course,
but I don't think they should be
able to sell me a gun that
malfunctions and that hurts me
or hurts somebody else.
Thank you, Senator Cervantes,
and actually you were at 3
minutes and 30 seconds, so.
Yes
And so, um, at this point, we're
going to go ahead and go to the
committee.
Um, I see Senator Sher has a big
book out, um, and so,
He's ready to go, um, if we have
questions or comments from the
committee before I
to send it a share, let's see.
So excited about asking
questions.
And.
All right, I'm gonna go ahead
and go to Senator Sheriff. I've
got that book memorized. I'll
just see it.
Madam chair, it's, it's, it's,
it's always, always a challenge
to go against the
Senator Cervantes, who probably
does have the big big red book.
Memorized
But there's a, there's a couple
of things in here that uh
Uh, that I just want to touch on
before I, before I get to
deep into this.
Um,
Certainly the uh
Uh, the unfair trade Practices
Act was if something
Did not work the way it was
supposed to work or was designed
to work. Isn't that true?
It's a very broad statue,
Senator, you've got it in front
of you, so we can start going
through it in some detail. It
was adopted as its head in 1967
and um many of you probably
weren't even born at the time it
was adopted, but, but the, the
language of the bill goes far
beyond what you're just
describing. It relates to any
false deceptive, misleading
advertising, marketing sales,
uh, you can't sell a Gucci bag
for $50 and call it a Gucci bag
with it's a knockoff in New
Mexico legally that would be a
violation of the unfair trade
practices that you can go
through any number of different
scenarios.
Where the act is used to keep
essentially.
And services uh on it.
And again, it's not just goods,
it's services as well too, so I
can't misrepresent my services,
um, I can't mis misrepresent our
chili product or my legal
services without running afoul
of this act. Yes, so, uh.
Madam Chair, absolutely. So you
can't say hatch chili if it's
not hatch chili, except that I
think we've made an exception to
say had chilly when it wasn't
him.
You want to get into that
center? I'll be happy to debate
that one with you for hours, but
well, we, we do have one more
pill that I think is gonna take
a little bit, um, yeah, if, if
the truck with your chili comes
from Mexico and it stops and
hatch for the driver to get out
and get a slurpee and goes back,
it's been in hatch.
Yes, yes, and so, so, obviously
we have exceptions uh ourselves
in in our unfair.
Uh, great Practices Act.
But, but generally, uh, if you
say this item or this service is
going to do that, then it has to
do that.
Uh, whether it's uh
But
A car or whatever. Now, if
there's some danger in there,
OK, great. So the Pinto was, I
owned a Pinto once upon a time,
by the way.
That well, that's an image,
that's an image for all of us,
Senator, you're really, you in a
Pinto, oh man, you must have
been great with the the
standard. I loved it. OK, what's
that? It was a standard. I
pretended like it was a Mustang.
So, so I understand, um,
Yes, potentially dangerous, uh,
things, even though they're
working the way they were
designed to work, except that in
this case we used unfair trade
Practices Act because
It didn't really work the way it
was designed to work, because if
you hit it from the rear, it
blew up, and that was not.
Uh, that's, that's what made it
unfair. That's what made it
change.
Uh, in, in, in susceptible to
this.
But
If I get a uh
Uh, uh, uh, Henry Lever action
rifle.
And
When I
work the action and a bullet
comes out the end, and I work
the action and a bullet comes
out every single time.
Then it's doing exactly what it
was supposed to do.
If I worked the action in the in
the block, uh,
Cracks and blows up in my face,
then it's not doing what it was
designed to do was that.
to say that one is, one is doing
it, so therefore it shouldn't be
considered in the unfair
Practices Act, but the other one
where it broke and damaged me,
hurt me.
That, that could be then saying,
hey, this didn't do what it was
designed to do.
Well, if you'll allow me to back
into your answer just a little
bit sooner, you, you, again, I'm
stuck on you driving a Ford
Pinto, but um it was, it wasn't
just that the Ford Pinto was
exploding with a gas tank. It's
that the company knew the gas
tank was exploding and their
engineers knew that it was a
design defect and yet they did a
cost-benefit analysis. They said
the cost of us settling and
paying the debts for the fire of
the Pinto was far less expensive
than redesigning and
remanufacturing the car. That
was the that was the problem
with the, the lossess in the
Pinto in your example, I would
agree with you that if you got a
fire.
it does what it's supposed to
do, yes, but what, for example,
Senator, if they use an inferior
grade of metal, for example, in
constructing the device and the
metal failed and that caused you
an injury, either because of an
explosion or a back blow or
something else or maybe the, the
uh barrel became swollen because
of the heat and that caused an
explosion of the device under
that scenario, the unfair trade
practices Act should allow you
the right to or your family if
you're killed, to have some
recourse against the
manufacturer they knew their
product was defective.
Yes, madam, and, and I agree, if
it's, if it's working the way it
was.
Designed work, told me that it
was gonna work.
Um
If they told me though that it
had inferior.
Um
Metal
And I bought it anyway.
Cause I knew
Is that unfair? I mean, they
disclosed it. That, that becomes
a fact question center for a
judge and jury. The question is,
what is, what are you expected
to know and what did they
disclose to you? Did they
disclose enough information to
you. That's why when you all
turn on the TV and you see the
drug manufacturers' ads and you
see all of the potential side
effects that's intended to
advise you when you open any
package these days and you get
uh 20 pages of the fine print
trying to tell you all the
warnings and the information
that we throw immediately in the
trash. That's designed to alert
you to the
the potential consequences of,
of misusing the product or the
defects of the product for which
it's not intended. So to answer
your question, if they told you
that the product had all these
defects and it was considered a
fair warning to you, big bold
letters and large print and so
forth. A court might say, yeah,
you had enough warning and you,
you took that risk. So it would
really be fact dependent.
So in this particular case,
Madam Chair.
Um
The um
If, if I were buying a firearm
that was really
Um, uh, uh, uh, for show,
something you say, hey, this is
really cool, you hang it on the
wall, you never use it, uh, and
it said,
Don't use it, although it could
physically be used, I suppose.
Um, then that would be one of
those cases if they said this is
uh uh for show only and don't
really use it, then that would
not be unfair.
Even if I used it in it, and it
cost me.
Again, it would be fact
dependent and it would depend on
what the warning looked like,
what the, what the change was
and so forth, um, it would,
that's where we have courts
really is for somebody to look
at the facts and circumstances
and say, yeah, this was unfair
or this was a fair warning.
OK, so,
When I, if I may, so, um, just
send a share, just hold your
thought, um, uh, a couple of
things I do want to make sure
that if you're going to ask a
question, make sure you get on
the list because we also need to
let uh representative Chandler,
know when her bill is coming up.
Um, so if you do want to ask
questions, please uh get your
name on the list. Um, also, let
me remind you to go through the
chair.
Thank you very much. I'm sorry,
Senator Sheriff, please
continue.
Problematic chair, you're the
one that can throw things at me
and I'm good with that.
I'm not a good 8.
Also counting on that. OK, I'm
gonna have you move your phone
though because every time
you're, your alarm goes off, it
There we go.
I'm waiting for the, the Viking
horn to keep going up.
OK, everybody that's texting me
just stopped.
So.
Um, I got all my own questions I
can't, I can't ask yours anyway.
So, um,
Now I've lost where I was.
My apologies senator.
Journals on display, so really
the uh the ferret, um,
Fair Trade Practices Act.
It was about people doing
intentionally doing things.
That were
Unfair, they, they, they didn't
work the way they were supposed
to work and they mis-sold or
oversold, undersold, whatever it
is they were doing, right? OK.
So in this, um,
The there's a couple of reasons
why I'm confused by it or
concerned by it. 26 pages,
almost all of which talks about
firearms.
doesn't talk about
stuff you buy from Team you
almost all of which is.
looks just like everything else
made in America, but it's not,
doesn't work the same.
So
In that case, there's thousands
of items, 10s of thousands of
items, maybe 100,000 items that
you can buy from China. It might
look.
Like what you can buy from the
United States, but they don't
function the same way.
Would this cover any of that?
Uh, yes, this, this bill goes
beyond just firearms. You write
the bill principally, uh,
describes and defines firearms
because that's the, the
objective or the goal behind the
bill is to
Uh, began to have manufacturers
manufacture farms that cannot
readily be converted to in the
unlawful use and that's what
when you look at the language in
here, we know it's, it's
unlawful in New Mexico to
convert a weapon to an automatic
weapon. It's been unlawful for
since Al Capone to uh to own or
to buy automatic weapons again
with some restrictions and some
limitations and registrations.
collectors, all kinds of things,
but generally speaking, it's
been unlawful to have a.
Gangster era
Uh, but manufacturers
manufacture guns knowing they
can be converted and, and
Potentially
Um, I suspect they do so
intending them to be readily and
easily converted. Um, so the
goal here is to uh allow for a
recovery where the manufacturers
manufacturing gun they know is
going to be converted for an
illegal use.
So, Madam Chair, if we can
We can sue.
The Chinese Communist Party,
cause that's who makes
everything in China. Nobody
makes anything without their
permission.
Um
For all of the, so,
My wife bought a bunch of ties,
and I got grandfather ties. She
bought this whole bunch of ties
so my kids could draw, and they
didn't look like this.
said they looked like, well,
they were plain.
But they weren't this size.
They were more like
This size
Was that unfair and deceptive.
I'm, I'm having trouble
understanding your questions and
maybe you can restate it for me
again. I'm, I'm, it was it uh
was it unfair or deceptive for
your wife to buy you the wrong
size tie, um, no, because she
thought she was buying that.
But she ended up buying a tie
that no, that's not a false or
deceptive practice. The, the
practice of false or deceptive,
the way the act works is it's
limited to uh the manufacturers,
sellers, suppliers of goods and
services. So your wife's not a
seller of a good or service, so
no, we're getting the wrong size
for you is not a false or
deceptive practice.
No, but which team you?
The false was team you being
false when they, when they
showed a tie on an adult, but
when it came, it was a tie for a
kid.
Oh, I see what you're saying.
Um, that would have been false,
uh, whether it was deceptive or
not.
Uh
Again, that would be a fact
dependent circumstance where
you'd have to go in and say they
intended to sell uh ties the
wrong size and we're trying to
unload wrong size ties for some
reason that, that could be a
false inceptive practice doesn't
sound like it would be to me.
Again, you'd have to show that
they were purposefully
misrepresenting their product
and knew it and intended to
financially benefit from doing
so.
Well, that, that's
So yes, we've got all the gun
parts in here that I'm gonna
come back to, but the, but the
bigger picture is
That
Because
I can order things.
Right here, sitting at this
table, if people would stop
texting me.
Even though it's not shaking the
table now, it's shaking my
chair.
Oh.
Yeah, but I would prefer it not
to whoever's continuing to text
me.
Um,
So any company that's selling
anything in New Mexico online.
Could be affected by this, even
if they sold.
Any item at all. I could sell
pencils.
OK, so I buy a box of pencils
online and wait a minute, it
doesn't write the way I expected
it to write. So now that pencil
company could be sued.
Under this
Um,
it seems it touches everything.
Well, you're asking two
questions. Does the bill attach
the good, uh, the sale of all
goods and services, yes, it
would attach to all goods and
services, but you would still
have to show a false and
deceptive practice, so selling
you pencils is not gonna and,
and on top of that, you not have
to only have falseceptive
practice. You have to show some
injury to you. You have, you'll
have to show that you somehow
were injured by getting the
wrong size tiere or the wrong
pencil.
I don't know how that could
happen, but again, you're giving
very simplistic examples,
pencils and ties. I, I'm looking
at um any number of other
products that could have very
serious consequences. We, you,
you've talked about yourself
when we saw recently the
Israelis were able to plant
bombs in cell phones and have
those go off in a coordinated
attack.
And killed many, many people end
up using cellphones. So, uh, our
products are, are in a whole
other level center and not, I'm
not talking about pencils.
You're talking about mass
castration devices.
Which is really what they were.
I don't know how the devices
function. I just know that the
Israelis were able to implant
something in cell phones that
were then sold and people use
until they decided somehow to
trigger an explosion in all
those ways that kill people.
If we can continue to direct the
questions for the bill.
So
Um
So um, let's just go to page 3
here, back to the firearm thing.
A firearm means any.
A weapon that will or is
designed to or may readily be
converted to expel a projectile
by the action of an explosive
explosion. The frame or receiver
of such weapon or any firearm
muffler or firearm silencer.
So that's a pretty long
definition of firearm, including
a muffler and a silencer.
Um, and a receiver, Firearm
includes any handgun, rifle,
shotgun, but does not include
any antique firearm of the.
Um
So
In this particular case, we're
defining firearm.
has
a firearm muffler or silencer.
That really a firearm?
center, the definitions here for
fire and farm accessories
destructive device are our
definitions that we're pulling
from our laws so we're
consistent. We've been dealing
with as you well know, uh, gun
safety, um, and, and firearms
legislation for now several
years and so I've sponsored some
of it and we've had that debate
on the floor many times whether
it's um
gun show loophole, whether it's
red flag, whether it's a 7 day
waiting period and all of these
laws were now uh Senator
O'Malley's, uh, um, assault
weapon we spent a lot of time
last night trying to define what
an assault weapon, so we're
trying to marry the definition
of a firearm here to where we're
using that definition throughout
our laws.
But
Madam Chair.
Uh, the, the, the first part
means any weapon that will or is
designed to or may readily be
converted to expel a projectile.
By the action of an explosion
explosion.
OK, that's
A gun.
Uh, you've got
bullet that has the gunpowder in
it. You've got the primer,
you've got the actual
projectile, though when you hit
the primer, the gunpowder
explodes, that's the explosion
in the projectile leaves the
barrel and goes somewhere.
You can't do that with a
silencer or a muffler.
There's nothing there, it's just
a piece of
Something, uh, as a metal
outside, the inside is
Made of something else to
To help muffle the sound of it.
But certainly there's nothing
exploding in there.
So how come that's now a firearm
by itself, it does nothing.
By itself, I can't even use it
as a stick to hit you because
they're short.
I agree, Senator, and so what
I'm suggesting to you is that
we're dealing with in this
section too is modifications
done unfair trade Practices Act
and what we're simply doing by
this bill is bringing over
definition of firearm that we
brought over from all of our
other laws where we've been
defining what a firearm is
elsewhere and um I would agree
with you that that there may be
some question about how we
define that to include a
silencer, but let me just give
you a good example. If you look
at the preceding language, we
also include a frame or receiver
of a firearm right? And I agree
with you, you can't.
spelled projectiles, but the
explosion was just a frame or
receiver, but we've defined
those components uh in our law
as, as a part of a fire or a
fire, we even though it's a
grant you it's only a component
of the firearm and the best
example I can give you that is
that um I'm not gonna out one of
my friends here in the building,
but one of my friends has many
component parts uh that can be
assembled to create an automatic
weapon. So if we were to enact a
ban on automatic weapons, this
individual can simply take those
receiver parts, put them all
together and create.
an automatic weapon that
wouldn't be sold by anybody, but
he'd make it, make it at home.
By the dozens.
So
parts the Madam Chair, the parts
themselves until, until your
friend assembles them.
They're just parts because I, I
have in my garage, I have, I
have lots of tools and lots of
parts for lots of things. I'm
sure somebody could go through
there and say, gosh, you could
probably build a rifle out of
what I found in your garage.
Maybe I could, I don't know.
I've got lots of stuff.
But certainly I'm not building
rifles.
So just the fact that it's in my
garage, would that be uh
Considered a firearm based on
this, because I have
I have things that could be
turned into a barrel.
and I'm sure, yes, that's rights
but we've defined firearms so
broadly that we've incorporated
the component parts to a firearm
within that definition. I'll
give you another example if you
look at the definition of a
destructive device, right?
You'll see.
On page 3 up at the top there we
find it.
as a combination of parts, so
we, we're taking the components
and we're, we're putting them
all within these definitions of
what is either destructive
device or a firearm, and I, I,
you know I could probably have a
good uh discussion about whether
or why we've included a firearm
silencer in the past or muffler,
I don't know, but I, I, what I
am telling you is this
definition is what we're using
and have used consistently
throughout our laws for dividing
a firearm.
Well
Madam Chair, I just
You know, it's one thing to make
me a criminal just because I
have a uh
uh
Air-cooled gas operated magazine
fed shoulder fired.
Sporting device, that's, you
know, that's one thing that we
did last night, but this is a
whole different thing that you
can go into my garage and find
that it's possible.
I could have the stuff.
Even though it's, it's not
really a receiver if I have
enough stuff to make one, but
have the tools to make one.
I don't really have a barrel,
but I have the tools to make
one.
Wow
That seems to be going.
Way beyond the pale of what
would, would be a firearm or
destructive device.
Think about it this way, I mean,
I'm sure senator, what we're
trying to avoid is we're trying
to avoid people gaming us,
right? So it'd be really easy to
say, well, we didn't sell you an
assault weapon, we just sold you
all the parts for an assault
weapon and we did it with 6
different transactions from 6
different vendors and so each
one of them says, I didn't sell
you an assault weapon, but if
there is a coordinated effort
and they're selling and
manufacturing parts that can all
be put together and knowing that
they're doing so, I, I would
argue that yes, they're selling
an assault weapon.
Even though they're only selling
a part of the assault weapon.
Oh
Madam Chair and senator,
I can, I understand where you're
coming from here, but I, I
believe this is so broad that
That I don't even actually have
to have a receiver.
I just have to have the ability
to make a receiver.
And then I have a firearm.
Madam Chair, you're asking
whether you'd have a firearm if
you made the component parts,
yeah, you would.
Um, the goal is to get the
manufacturers of the, of the
component parts to not.
Knowingly participate in
creation of component parts that
can be made into an unlawful
weapon.
But yes, the technology exists
for you to make these parts
yourself in your garage. There's
no doubt about it.
You're not gonna be a
manufacturer.
Unless you're selling, I guess
you could be, I guess, yeah, you
could be. Well, if I was, yeah,
yeah, I get that. If I were
making them, if I were making
them give them away.
Maybe, but if, but if I just
have the ability to
Because the stuff's in my
garage.
Yeah, the goal here is if you're
making those, if you're
manufacturing those guns, even
it's in your garage and you're
selling them online. You're,
you're gonna be manufacturing
guns and you're liable for the
harm that that device may cause
to others.
you should be.
If I'm making them.
Uh, just the ability to make
them. You're making them and
you're selling.
So
Um, the, uh,
Uh, if we finish at the end of 3
firearm accessory means any
device specifically adapted to
enable
The wearer or carrier.
About one person of a firearm.
Um
What, what, what are we talking
about that? So I'm where are you
wearing or carrying what makes
that a firearm.
Or firing accessories. Is that a
holster.
Senators by firearm accessory
would be a device adapted to
enable the wearing or carrying
of personal firearms. So yeah,
that would be, that would be a
firearm accessory.
The holster, yes.
Be a firearm accessory the way
it is defined.
Why do we have to have this in
the unfair trade practices.
Again, uh, well, because again,
you'll have to go to where we
make unlawful, what is the what
would be an unlawful uh device
or practice of merely having a
firearm accessor is not going to
be unlawful, but if we're doing
so in a way that creates an
unlawful use of a firearm than
it would be, so um I could get a
holster maybe not uh a good
example. I'm trying to think of
where a firearm accessory uh
would apply to conversion of a
device, but I think that that
may very well be a way to
capture again the lock.
Switch, the idea behind what we
call a log switch. I, I'm not a
firearms expert, Senator. I, I
own a few weapons, but they're
none of them were modified, none
of them are really anything too,
too tricky, but there's a lot of
folks who are very sophisticated
with weapons and guns and are
able to convert and manufacture
and do some very interesting
things with their weapons, so uh
that's why that's such a broad
definition of an accessory.
So
And, and, and I kind of go back,
Madam Chair, to the whole idea
of what's in my garage. So if
I'm talented enough,
I can make
Furniture
Which I do sometimes.
I have the tools, I have the
skills of the knowledge, OK.
Mostly for me it's woodworking,
I'm metalworking, but.
Um, but if I have the
The skills to do something.
And this is my big concern that
this seems so broad to me, madam
chair, so broad.
That a a gunsmith, a legitimate
gunsmith, works, uh, you know,
his FFL licensed guy, and he
fixes firearms all the time, uh,
there, that are just old and
worn out. That happens.
Um
And so he, you know, refurbishes
them legally, does all of that.
He may have all of the stuff to
make an automatic weapon.
You may have all of this stuff
to do this.
I don't have the the firearm
skills to this like you.
But I do have tools and I can
make things, and I could
probably make something out of
wood.
The
That you could find illegal
somehow. I'm trying to think of
what it was I could make.
Um
But
But this seems so broad to me.
it just the fact that the the
materials are available and the
skills are available that then
it becomes a firearm, just
because it could.
manufactured into a firearm.
Or an
A holster
A lot of people make holsters.
Haven't tried to make a holster,
but I think I could make a
leather holes.
So that's, that's just what,
what, what really
What really bothers me here. Um,
You know, firearm part means any
component part of a firearm,
including ammunition.
Go get a firearm part.
Include ammunition. Well, the
ammunition by itself doesn't do
anything, uh, unlike the old
western movies, if you throw
ammunition into a fire, it
doesn't shoot.
A bullet and untie the rope
behind your hand.
It goes bang in a bunch of
little pieces go out that even
if you're close to him probably
won't hurt you. Well, they might
cut you, but they don't kill
you.
I just
It just really this, this whole,
and, and you've admitted that
we're opening up the unfair
trade Practices Act, which I
believe I've heard you say is
dangerous.
Didn't I hear that you say that
you didn't want to go there? No.
for me.
OK.
All right, I'll believe you.
I'm opening up the app, uh,
again, this was adopted in 1967.
I don't know when we last
increased the penalties, but I
think I'm told it's decades. So
yeah, I'm opening it up, um.
And, and if I can just very
briefly, I know you didn't ask
me a question, but I can help
you, I think, Senator. So if you
look at the depth, the, you're
looking at the definitions of
firearms and so on, but I would
suggest to you is that you look
on page 6.
Um, existing language, page 6,
line 17.
This is the, here's the
definition of what is an unfair
or deceptive practice. This is
the heart of what the bill is,
is the entire act is intended to
do, is to attack unfair
deceptive trade practices, and
this is all existing language we
define what that is, and you'll
see there's already an existing
long list on pages 6789.
We were already in the past over
many years list of things that
we have specifically defined to
be an unfair accepted practice
and, and you'll find some of
those pretty interesting to read
through. And what we're doing
here is we're adding on page 9,
a 25th paragraph or 21st
paragraph, which would be an
additional prescribed unfair
deceptive practice, which would
be knowingly.
That's key. Knowingly
manufacturing, advertising,
distributing, or offering for
sale a firearm for destructive
device or firearm part, or
accessory, contrary to the laws
of New Mexico and the state of
the United States. That's,
that's the key to getting by the
immunity in the congressional
law. Congressional law says gun
manufacturers are immune from
liability unless they're doing
something contrary to state or
federal law in doing so and we
defining it that way.
Yeah, in, in, in, in Madam
Chair, I
I completely understand that the
the state law.
portion of all of this and that,
but that's also what confuses me
is why do we want to make
Our state law
So restrictive.
beyond the federal law.
And uh again I go back to the
whole idea that
If, if the
If the device, whatever it is,
doesn't do what it's.
Uh, so, uh, advertised to do.
It doesn't matter whether it's a
gun or a car or a pencil.
That's unfair and deceptive.
But if it does what it's
supposed to do.
Then I don't see how it's unfair
and deceptive.
And I do need whoever's texting
me again to stop.
I feel like we're in the Swiss
Alps whenever there's a heavy
bill and his phone keeps going
off and that we need lederhosen
Enrico cough drops.
So I do want to let, right, we,
we will finish the agenda today.
So, um, and we are supposed to
go onto the floor at one
o'clock. So I just wanted to
Plant that seed with you, sir.
I am concerned straight up.
That
This thing is targeted at
firearms, period. It also
Defines firearms so broadly.
And accessories, so broadly.
That it just, it, it looks like
it.
Incorporates virtually
everything to have to do with a
firearm, no matter what.
Um, the Glock switches.
We, we did pass a bill saying no
block switches.
And I was OK with that.
And if you've seen the YouTube
video of that.
So the first round goes that
way.
And then it goes up there.
What's the point in having one?
I
Doesn't seem to be useful and
also doesn't seem like it could
kill many people because all of
them go up in the sky pretty
fast.
Seems like a wasted ammunition,
a waste of time and a waste of
effort and a waste of everything
else.
Um, but,
The band the Glock switch fine.
But I guess then what this is
really going at is lock.
You're saying, uh, Madam Chair
and Senator, the clock
specifically designed their
firearms so that you could put a
glock switch on it.
Um, Madam Chair, I would, I
wouldn't make the accusation
because they'll probably get
sued for defamation and get by
uh Glock, but um, so I, I'm not
gonna say that they manufacture
their gun with intent, but they
should be um
subject to somebody exploring
that possibility and I wouldn't
be surprised to find that
there's email internal
corporations says, yeah, we know
our guns being converted by
these devices and um and then
the question would be what how
did they respond to that? Did
they have their engineers
redesign the weapon? Did they
have them do things with the
weapon to make that impossible.
I, I don't know, but I'm, I'm
not gonna make the accusation
Glock is doing this
deliberately, but they should be
subject to liability if they
are.
That's all this does.
So
Madam Chair and senator
If they, if they truly didn't
know. I mean, Glock's been
around for a long time.
When the 1st 1980.
Um, so they've been making.
Uh, started with the believe the
Glock 19, 1st one I recall, so
they've been making um.
Handguns
40 years or more.
The Glock
knew
So they certainly didn't know
that they were making a a
firearms that could be converted
to automatic 40 years ago.
That also means there's a whole
bunch of those out there.
There'd be millions of them out
there.
What would you suggest?
How, how do you, how do you fix
that? So you say, OK, or new,
new one.
We removed whatever or added
whatever to to make sure the
glock switch couldn't be on it.
But for
decades, literally.
The clock was a well-known
trusted handgun used by police
forces used by
Militarries around the world.
And then somebody developed
Glock switch, and it wasn't
Glock.
But you can do the same thing
with other firearms.
You can turn other firearms into
automatic weapons.
I
Somebody's gonna figure out how
to do that, even if it's just a
game.
Oh
So
In that particular case, it's
not the firearm that's the
problem.
It's the switch that's the
problem.
Block is doing exactly what the
Glock was designed to do.
And always does what it's
designed to do. It has, it has a
very, very low.
A malfunction rate.
Um
So why would we want to go after
firearms? Why don't we go after
the things that actually turned
the firearm.
Into something illegal.
They'll go after the Glock
switch, which I actually voted
for, as opposed to the firearm
itself.
Why would, why would we not
focus on that?
The device that makes it illegal
instead of firearms.
So I share a lot of questions in
there. The bill does exactly
that. That's probably why we
define this as a firearms
accessory, right, because the
switch would be an accessory to
the device, um, I'll ask you
questions that are back to you
and interesting, which is when
we, and we have the sponsor
House Bill 8 where we have the,
the ban on the so-called Glock
switch, but it doesn't say glock
switch, it's a weapon conversion
device. We defined it broadly
without specific reference to
one manufacturer and we had law
enforcement strongly supporting
that request, and, and you're
right, it's an uncontrolled.
Weapon when it's used. I've seen
it too and I, I can't imagine
anybody does it for any reason
that I can think of to control
seems like an uncontrolled use.
But why did the police, why law
enforce it so strongly want us
to include that in our package
and why is that initiative of
the governors here. Well,
there's a reason for that and
and why is it why are you
referring to it repeatedly as a
glock switch.
Uh, we didn't call it that in
the law, we called it a weapon
conversion device. It's called
you're using the word lock
switch because it's become so
synonymous, this conversion
device with that particular
weapon clock that in my mind
there's gotta be some link
between that particular weapon
and these conversion devices to
suggest that that particular
weapon is more susceptible to
the use of these switches.
That's why we call it a block
switch, but you're right, it
could be used to convert or I'm
sure there's devices to convert
other weapons, but why?
Why is the Glock so synonymous
with the notion of conversion to
these automatic weapons. There's
probably a reason for that. I
don't know what it is, but my,
my suspicion is that particular
weapon is more easily converted
than perhaps others, and others
may be impossible to convert.
Yeah
So Madam Chair, I
I agree, uh, in, in the, the,
the broader sense in how House
Bill 8 was that uh that I voted
for, yes, because I know that
there are other things that
other people can do to, to make
a
Legal firearm and illegal
firearm, but the firearm itself.
Which is what this bill is all
about. Well, half the bill is
all about.
I
It just looks to me like we're
going after the firearm.
Not the conversion.
accessory.
So
Anyway, so that's the, that's
the first part, the second part
is all about how we touch or we
are touched by any sense, uh, in
New Mexico, um.
For any product that we bought
online.
Uh, that also seems just
terribly broad because what I
suspect will happen there,
Senator, is all of a sudden we
won't be able to buy anything
online in New Mexico.
Uh, in, in that, that bothers
me.
Because
you know, people ask me where do
I get my ties? I don't know. My
wife has a computer, or credit
card, and a relationship with
the UPS guy. I don't know where
they come from.
And so now all of a sudden,
Everything stops.
All commerce
All online commerce in New
Mexico stops.
Because again, this is, this at
least appears to me to be so
broad.
You start suing 2 or 3
manufacturers under this for
anything.
And everybody says we're out.
And now
Let me pack up. Maybe that's
great.
We've been beating up small New
Mexico businesses all this all
session long, we've just been
taking a hammer and smashing
them.
We're about to smash them again
here in a few minutes.
It just beats snot out of them,
but maybe the right thing here
is we just go ahead and stop all
online businesses and maybe
we'll have New Mexico business.
Well, maybe that's perfect.
Except the Mexico businesses
simply cannot produce all of the
things that we bought and lot.
So there's this 22 problems, uh,
senator and Madam Chair. One is,
is
This is so broad when it comes
to firearms, and you've even
admitted this is about firearms.
And the second part of it is
I believe it touches so many
other things that we rely on.
That all of a sudden, there
won't be any commerce and online
commerce in New Mexico.
Because people are going to be
afraid of this. And what I use
is, is, is an example here is
everything you touch now.
says
This is known to cause
Cancer in the state of
California, the state of
California has determined this
is known to cause cancer.
And why is that? Because
When you came up with the rule,
this is everything has to be
tested to see if it's gonna
cause cancer.
And the manufacturers, the
people said,
It's a pain in the butt.
This has a really high peta
factor for those who weren't
here yesterday, Pet PITA, that's
pain in the rear factor, OK?
And
Uh, so it's a real pain in, uh,
pedia factor, to get everything
tested. So they put a label on
everything.
Everything in California is
known to cause cancer.
Because
Well, we went so far and so
broad, it was just easier to to
do that instead of anything
else.
All right, Madam Chair.
I'm not ready to shut up yet,
but.
I appreciate your consideration,
sir.
Thank you, Senator, Senator
Wirth.
Oh, thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
hoping we'll have a continued
and long discussion in the
judiciary about all the legal
issues I move to.
Right, Senator Wirth, given if
there are no other questions or
comments, we have a do pass
motion. What is the 2nd, the 2nd
from Senator O'Malley.
I know that we're going to need
to take a vote on this one. You
will, Rebecca.
Senator Vigaro.
Yes.
Senator had a meal. Yes.
Senator O'Malley,
Senator Paul.
Senator Ramos.
And she.
Oh
Senator Wirth, yes.
Senator Bergman's.
Yes.
Senator Hamlet, yes.
You have a 6 to 42 pass, good
luck in judiciary, Senator.
Thank you.
All righty, we are going to hear
and a vote um on this on, uh, HB
11 today.
And we have Representative
Chandler.
I believe there are
only we did not do. I felt like
I should have been in the Swiss
Alps.
OK.
All right, Representative,
welcome to the committee. So,
um, what we do in the committee
is we have, we'll give you
Uh, in this case, if you need 15
minutes, um, I know there have
been some changes to this from
the house version. We'll give
you 15 minutes to present also
with your expert that's
included.
Then what we will do is we will
go to audience participation,
based on the number of people
that may either show in support
or in opposition, we will hear
audience participation, but we
will limit to one minute apiece.
So if you're crafting your
message, keep it to one minute,
you will be stopped if you go
beyond one minute, we will do
the same thing online, but most
likely fewer people online since
we've got uh such a large crowd
here in the audience. So, um,
Representative Chandler, you are
welcome to go.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. How
do you handle amendments? Would
you prefer I hold it?
Or presented as part of my.
And so, um, you, you have one
amendment, yes, ma'am.
There were 2.
I did not present to, Madam
Chair.
Uh, which number do you have as
your member representative last
three digits are 21.1.
All right, so this one's your
amendment.
Not sure if this one is going to
be issued or not. I don't know.
Um, so let's hold on. So, if you
will, um, go ahead and present
your bill and then talk about
the amendment and then we'll
move the amendment. Um, very
good. Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, and I don't think I need
15 minutes. Um, house Bill 11.
is a uniquely New Mexican
version of paid family and
medical leave.
And it is now called Madam Chair
and members, the welcome child
and family Wellness Act.
And it has two parts. One part,
I think you could liken to uh an
insurance program wherein the
employer and the employee pay a
small premium into a fund that
we're creating, it will be
administered by um Workforce
Solutions department.
In that fund will help support
working individuals.
Who
Um, experience certain um.
Things like, um, any illness.
Um, they may be fostering a
child. They may be the object of
a domestic violence situation
where they need some time to
address things, bereavement
leave if a child is lost who is
younger than 18 and military
leave if a family member needs
to address certain things after
one of their um their family
members were called up to serve.
So that's one fund, and that's
like an insurance fund, and it's
similar.
to what we have passed and
presented in the past to this
body and to the house, um, Madam
Chair.
The other one is a unique
approach to help support
families who are having a new
child or a a welcome my new
child through adoption or birth,
and in that case, we are
proposing the creation of the
welcome child Fund, which will
be funded through
appropriations, um, it will
provide that, um.
A person either adopting or um
having a child, both, both
parents may take up to 12 weeks
of leave.
In a sense, it's unpaid leave,
but there is, um, job guarantee,
you know, um, but it also
provides what we're calling a
rebate.
To support and assist that
family welcoming that child, a
rebate of $3000 a month for 3
months. Um, so it's unique and
it's different, but I think we
feel very fortunate that we have
strong revenues um in our early
childhood department that will
be coming in, that will help us
support, uh, you know, infants
actually, um, Madam Chair and
members in a way that we have
not been able to do thus far,
and I think it will be a great
boon.
To us in the state to be
supporting families who are
having new children.
And
Madam Chair, that is the essence
of our bill.
All right, if you will, um, if
you will address the amendment,
and then we'll move the
amendment. Um, yes, Madam Chair.
So as I said, it, the last three
digits are 21.1. The first
amendment strikes reference.
Um, and it's on page 3 and we
are eliminating language on line
6.
through
line 8 stopping at or going
through the or, and what that
does is
This um provision has been in
the bill for a long time and it
was um frankly, the result of
negotiations with the railroads,
um, the railroad industry
pointed out to me that they're
already subject to these kind um
that they would not this
provision could not apply to
them because of federal law
would exempt them, but it was
pointed out more recently um
that
This, these, this language also
excludes others such as the
airline industry, and that was
not the intent, so I agreed to
modify it as part of my
negotiations with labor,
frankly, Madam Chair.
The um other um amendment is on
page 22.
And I think we're all suffering
from allergies, Madam Chair, um,
line 22, 18, and that's just a
renumbering, that's the result
of some other changes that
happened in the bill and um.
No, excuse me. Number 2 is line
22, line 10, after employed, we,
um, we insert self-employed and
that was I received some input
after the the bill um pass the
floor that we omitted that
terminology because this bill
does apply to employed
individuals as well as
self-employed, and it was just
an erroneous omission, Madam
Chair. Um, um, item 3 is, as I
said, a renumbering um line
items.
4 page 22, line 20 is um the,
the next um few um provisions,
amendments, Madam Chair, are
intended to address something
that was brought to our
attention wherein.
Originally the bill or the
current bill provides that the
30 $3000 a month stipend will go
to one parent, and there was
concern that could that could
create um conflict if the
parents weren't living together
or there could be an issue, so
the next um few uh items, 45 and
6 are in or 4 and 5 are intended
to address the situation where
there are 2 parents involved in
their um is not agreement. So
what, what would happen is it
would be split between the two.
two parents if they're they're
not aligned in terms of who
should get the money, Madam
Chair.
So with that, that I believe is
the um totality of that uh
proposed, Madam Chair. Thank you
very much, Representative. Um,
is there a motion to move the
amendment for discussion.
I moved I moved.
Yes
Is there a discussion on the
amendment?
opposition to the amendment.
I see no, let's go ahead and
we'll.
Right, that we have the
amendment adopted.
Right, I
Yeah
Right, at this point, uh,
Representative noticed that you
have uh an expert. Do you want
your expert to make a few
statements that's
Um, Madam Chair, that's not
necessary. Um, she's just here
to help me with fielding some of
the financial questions.
All righty, so now we are going
to public testimony. And so what
I need to see first and foremost
is by a show of hands how many
in the audience are in support
of this legislation. Keep your
hands up, please.
Thank you for the wait.
19 on this side.
23457891, 1213, 14.
16.
16 on the right side, the wave,
I'll give you extra points.
Thank you very much.
That time of the session. All
right, now by show of hands, how
many are in opposition?
Keep your hands up, please.
You'll count that side. I'll
count this side.
No two hands, Christopher.
you, I used to be a teacher. I
see that stuff.
All right, I'm gonna have, now
you're gonna have to make me
start again. I'm sorry, on this
side, if you please, Senator
Bergman's has got that site
already. 12345.
8
Did you count already?
16. All right, thank you very
much. All right. So what we're
gonna do,
is we are going to do 15 and we
also have uh several online.
We have
3
And support, and we have
1234567.
89 in opposition. So what we're
gonna do is we are gonna hear
both, not all of them. So what I
want is 15 people in support,
then we will have 15 people in
opposition here, and then we
will do
Since we have 3 yeses, we're
gonna do 3 yeses and 3 no's, and
I'll pick the, I'll pick those
folks. I know that there are
some folks that haven't
testified yet that we're hoping
to. So remember, you do have one
minute apiece, the vice chair
will give you a 32nd warning.
Um, so if you can please wrap it
up when you see that 32nd
warning, and we will go over the
instructions in Zoom. Uh, if you
can let folks know though to,
to, to get ready. So if you
will, let's get it going. Thank
you, Madam Chair and members of
the committee and
Thanks to Representative
Chandler for continuing to be a
champion for workers with this
bill. Please say your name.
Matthew Henderson from OA.
Uh, I am here though to express
some concerns about shortcomings
in the bill. Um, as you know,
the bill started off providing
12 weeks of paid medical leave
and it is now 6.
So, um,
In the spirit of speaking the
truth to the
Best deliberative body in the
state of New Mexico. Um,
We came to this committee uh
with an amendment drafted to
address that and to amend the
bill to 9 weeks. We hope you
will consider it. Thank you for
your support.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Lance
Senna, policy director for the
Center for Pacific Policy and a
four-time cancer patient.
The last time I came before this
committee, I mentioned to my
doctor told me I wouldn't be
able to see my hot girl summer.
While battling stage 4 cancer.
It's clear that I beat those
odds, despite nearly dying twice
within the year. The only reason
I'm before this committee is
because I had access to a
comprehensive medical leave. My
fellow New Mexican transplant
patients were not that lucky.
Cancer patients have, are having
their clinical trials defunded
and Medicaid cut, while some are
being denied their transplants
completely because they do not
have the ability to take 12
weeks off or find a caregiver
that can afford to do so. We are
being hit the hardest during our
darkest times. Cancer patients
like me will continue to
struggle, and 6 weeks are not
enough to go through a
transplant, go through
treatment, or get further their
caregivers. We stand in support
for
paid family medical leave, but
urged this committee to amend
the medical leave to 9 weeks
from 6 weeks to meet the all to
meet the needs of all New
Mexicans. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of this committee. My
name is Gabriella Baez, and I am
the executive director of New
Mexico Voices for Children.
We appreciate the hard work and
champion of paid family medical
leave by the sponsors and many
lawmakers throughout this
session and hope to see paid
family medical leave signed into
law this year. New Mexico
families deserve it. However,
New Mexico Voices for Children
remained neutral and did not
stand in active support when the
House Committee substitute was
presented.
We see and are grateful for the
hard work you all are doing and
that the house did to make these
laws hopefully real this year.
And we continue to have concerns
about the committee's substitute
and propose an amendment for
this committee to address some
of those concerns. Respectfully,
Madam Chair and members of this
committee, this amendment could
address the concerns about
inadequate leave amounts for
non-parenting leave. Thank you.
Madam Chair and committee
members. My name is Bernard and
Hardy, Ham is preval and Dena.
I'm a lobbyist for animated
vote. I'm also a mother and a
caretaker. We are here in full
support of HB 11 and 2 in 20 in
2006, I was expecting the
arrival of my son, Lorenzo. I
had no PFML.
My job made it clear they would
not hold my position. Soon after
having my son, my mother was
diagnosed with stage 4 breast
cancer as the only daughter, I
assumed the responsibility of
caring for her. Only 8 months
after having my son, I lost my
mom with no financial income, my
son and I were homeless. I share
my story.
Because people should not be
left in poverty because of an
unforeseen tragedy.
And also,
We urge your support and to
increase the leave from 6 to 8
weeks. Thank you for listening.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Oamba Umi Advocacy
director for AARP New Mexico,
uh, we stand in support of this
particular bill. Um, we have
270,000 unpaid caregivers who
contribute 250 million uh unpaid
hours in family caregiving for
their older parents or siblings
or spouses, and even their
grandparents, and so what that
essentially does is allows them
their loved ones to live
independently at home, um, stay
out of house costly.
hospital visits, um, reduced
long stays in in nursing homes
and so for those reasons, we
urge you to pass this bill.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, um, members of the
committee, I'm Meredith Main
speaking on behalf of the League
of Women Voters of New Mexico
and the American Association of
University Women. We stand in
very strong support of this
bill. We appreciate the fact
that it's been streamlined and
that it is much more um directed
toward really helping uh new
children
get off to a good start. This is
very good policy,
economic policy. We've uh seen
people ending up living on the
streets or in their cars or
whatever because they have lost
jobs and haven't had any leave,
so this is very, very important,
and you're gonna hear from
people who are gonna say, well,
my business gives more than um
the state would require if this
bill becomes law, and that is uh
for any uh business that does,
there's a waiver possibility.
So it's very important that they
just um apply for that waiver
and they could be exempted from
this, but we really appreciate
the bills and thank the sponsor
for doing so much work on this.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, John Lipshutz
with the New Mexico Federation
of Labor, wanted to start by
thanking very much the sponsors
of this bill in the House,
especially the chairwoman for uh
for accepting our recent
amendment and also uh very much
want to thank uh the lead
sponsor in the Senate, the
Protem Mimi Stewart for all the
work that she's done on this
bill. Uh, we represent over
40,000 workers throughout the
state, uh, and we represent, uh,
we, we stand strongly in support
of this bill.
Uh,
not necessarily because this
bill will help all of our
members. In fact, a lot of our
members do get some form of
leave already through how they
bargain, but we strongly believe
in uh in the fact that all
workers in the state, whether
they're union or not, deserve a
certain benefits, um, in the
alienable benefits and we
consider this to be one of them.
So we strongly urge, uh, that
you support this bill. Thank
you.
Hi, good morning. My name is
Kelly Nakati. I am an only
member in early educator from
the Zuni Pablo.
If my employee had offered
medical leave, I would still
have a job right now. I was an
early educator for 8 years and
was recently terminated due to
health issues with my heart.
Taking time for off for medical
purposes was not supported at my
workplace. If I had up to 12
weeks of paid medical leave, I
would still have my job right
now. I strongly support paid
medical leave for all New
Mexicans. We all need a life
lifeline just in case something
happens. No one should have to
lose their job just because they
need some.
time to take care for the house.
Thank you and please urge to
pass um HB 11.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Jessa
Cowdry. I'm the vice president
of operations for Common Spirit,
Saint Joseph's Children.
As the largest provider of home
visiting in New Mexico, we
journey with hundreds of
families weekly, starting
prenatally and accompanying them
through the 1st 3 years of their
baby's life. When I ask families
in our program how this bill
would impact them. This is what
parent Nicole W said this
financial support would be a
tremendous financial burden
lifted off my shoulders. I would
have been able to focus on my
full attention on taking care of
my newborn and soaking up those
precious.
Moments.
In my situation of being a
single mother and facing my
son's diagnosis of cranio
stenosis going back to work with
something I dreaded, even
thinking about this support
would have greatly supported
that.
Uh, well, we'd like to see maybe
in the future a full year of
support for newborn babies. This
is a great step in the right
direction, so we are due to pass
HB 11. Thank you.
Morning, Madam Chair. My name is
Emma O'Sullivan, workers' rights
attorney for the New Mexico
Center on Law and Poverty. We
thank the sponsors for this
bill. We stand in support. The
federal family and Medical Leave
Act does not apply to most
employers in New Mexico and even
to covered workers, it provides
only unpaid leave. This bill
would help ensure that we all,
no matter what our family looks
like and no matter the size of
our employer can take the time
we need to meet health and
family needs. To really meet New
Mexicans' needs, the 6 weeks of
leave provided in the current
version of the bill should be
increased.
So many common serious health
and family needs last longer
than 6 weeks. We urge you to
extend the weeks of leave and
pass this bill. Thank you very
much.
All right, thank you. Before we
move on, we've had 10 speakers
so far, so we have 5 spots left.
Uh, Madam Chair and committee,
thank you. I'm Megan Greene,
president of CWA Local 7076, and
I'm a current state employee.
I'm speaking both for myself and
my 5000 CWA union siblings
across the state. Together we're
asking you to support HB 11. As
new parents as chronically ill
and disabled workers and has
children caring for aging
relatives, we don't deserve to
lose our jobs, go unpaid, or
worry about putting food on the
table or paying rent while
caring for ourselves and our
families, taking care of our
families in a time.
of need should be a basic human
right, not a privilege afforded
only to the wealthy and not left
to the whim of our employers.
For many of us dealing with life
changing diagnoses 6 weeks of
leave is not sufficient. While
workers' rights are under attack
across the nations what New
Mexican workers want and need is
to have lawmakers put our
working families first and pass
HB 11 this year.
Madam Chair and members of the
committee, I'm Janet Williams
with the National Organization
for Women.
We strongly support HB 11. We
believe that paid family leave
will protect families when they
have medical issues, and we
believe businesses will benefit
from loyal employees who are uh
feel cared for in their time of
need. Please support HB 11 and I
also think we should extend it
from 6 weeks to 9. Thank you.
Thank you. Before we go, cause I
know that we, uh, you're gonna
be translating, correct? OK,
yeah, no, that's fine. So that
means that we have 2 more spots.
Um, and so I, and, and we will
also extend that to the
opposition as well. So if you
will, please go ahead. OK.
I'm just speaking on my mother's
behalf, who's a pre-K teacher.
She was recently in a car
accident and she had to continue
to go to work with pain and it,
she never got the proper rest,
which made everything worse
overall.
And we would really appreciate
the support.
Thank you so much.
Hello, Madam Chair, members of
the committee. My name is Joey
Senna.
Most people don't know me, but
know my wife, Lana.
I've been her caregiver for 15
years. Has she's been battling
cancer?
I didn't have access to PFML and
worked the entire time.
Well, she was going through
transplant.
Caregivers need more than 6
weeks for medical leave and I
urge the committee to pass paid
medical leave to help all the
Mexicans.
Thank you. So there is one more
spot.
And then we will extend the same
thing to the opposition.
That's it. All right.
So we will go to 15, uh, in
opposition if you will please
line up.
We'll go online, we'll do online
in just a minute after we finish
in the room.
Uh, remember when you are giving
testimony, if you can please say
your name.
So that we can get that for the
record.
And you've got one minute. Thank
you, Madam Chair. I'm Carla
Sontag, president and CEO of the
New Mexico Business Coalition.
I, uh, want to share with you
that this would be a nightmare
for employers, but I really want
to talk about the effect on
employees. Before I do that
though, I wanna share that we
have had 528,000 emails.
Come to the legislature in the
House and the Senate in
opposition to this bill. On
behalf of the employees who were
part of these emails. There are
some issues, many of them do not
want to be taxed right now. They
need the money to feed their
families. Secondly, there are a
large percentage of employees
who are going to pay into the
fund mandatorily and not be able
to take advantage of the
benefits.
Uh, it puts a strain on
employees when an employee is
out that the others have to
cover for them because employers
are unable to hire in that
amount of time. And the last
thing I would point out that
most employees are not gonna
realize this benefit on the
family portion and on the $9000
gift is gonna be taxed
separately after they've already
paid the tax to get this.
They're not going to be
expecting that.
And if they've already spent the
money, they're gonna be in
trouble. I urge you to say no.
Thank you.
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Dana Gray,
executive director of Desert
State Physical Therapy Network
representing 30 independent
private practices throughout the
state. Hiring a temporary
clinical replacement is next to
impossible, as recruitment of
physical and occupational
therapists to this state is very
difficult. In addition,
credentialing health care
providers while much faster,
still takes 30 days to complete
and is not a retroactive
effective date. If you choose an
employment agency and can find a
traveling therapist.
The contract for the traveler
costs more than the fixed rate
of payment for services.
Currently, patients are either
not treated in a timely manner
and or it creates an increased
burden on already stressed
healthcare staff.
If unable to find a replacement,
access to services becomes an
even larger issue. For these
reasons, as well as the others
just stated, we respectfully
oppose this legislation. Thank
you.
Madam Chair, committee members,
my name is Tom Patterson.
I serve as president-elect of
the New Mexico Cattle Growers
Association. We oppose HB 11.
It isn't fair to the 800,500
agricultural employees in New
Mexico who would have to pay
into the program to subsidize it
but never receive any benefit
because they worked less than
150 days a year. Nor does HB 11
understand how production
agriculture operates. Our work
cannot be put on hold or
livestock suffer and our crops
like our chili and our onions.
bad. HB 11 assumes that
qualified labor is available to
fill in for an employee on leave
who's been doing that work.
In rural New Mexico, that is not
the case. HB 11 is not fair to
our agricultural employees,
production, agriculture across
New Mexico cannot operate under
or afford HB 11. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
senators, thank you for coming
in on this cold Saturday
morning.
I'm John Beltre. I'm the New
Mexico election transparency
Network chairman and also a
state leader for Better Together
New Mexico. I was asked to share
a story for an employer who
couldn't make it today out of
Corrales, who has a very small
business. She's been working
hard for 5 years.
HB 11 would put a huge amount of
stress on my friend's business,
creating difficulty managing
without employees for extended
periods of time, they would
struggle to keep the positions
filled, which could cause them
to reduce the hours of their
operation, also putting a huge
strain on the other employees,
Madam Chair.
As Carlos said with better
together New Mexico, and she was
kind of under on her number.
We've received 528,183 calls to
action opposing House Bill 11,
please consider opposing it.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, committee members
and Jerry shallow, president and
CEO of the Rio Rancher Regional
Chamber of Commerce and we stri
we stand strongly opposed to HB
11.
The bill raises taxes on all New
Mexicans without clear
understanding of its long-term
financial impact. No actuarial
analysis has been conducted, and
the Financial Review used was
based on outdated version of the
bill, raising concerns about
transparency and accountability.
There is a huge difference
between an actuarial study and a
financial analysis. So financial
analysis is a hypothesis.
And an actuarial is a scientific
review.
HB 11 would increase property
taxes, making homeowner home
ownership even more expensive,
so counties can participate.
It would also hike up gross
receipts tax so cities could
participate. The state
employees, school district and
contractors would require higher
state income taxes to fund the
expense. Even our students would
be burdened with higher tuition
and fees as colleges and
universities would have to
increase.
Costs to cover this. Plus the
state has to come up with
another way to come up with $200
million in expenses every year
to cover the part with the
newborns for the new families.
New Mexican taxpayers should not
be forced to write a blank check
without a full unbiased
financial review you've hit your
time. Thank you.
I think
the committee, uh, my name is
George Gundry. I'm the owner of
Tomasita's Restaurant here in
Santa Fe, a 50 year old
restaurant started by my mother
in 1974. I am supportive of
reasonable family medical leave.
In fact, I support the parental
leave section of this bill.
However, overall, HBL 11 is, is
too burdensome and too big on
our family owned businesses.
Businesses that are currently
struggling. Um, to be honest,
established, successful
businesses like mine will figure
out how to manage by raising our
prices.
Holding off giving raises to our
employees or taking other
creative measures. However, it
is inexperienced in up and
coming entrepreneurs will be
hurt most by this bill and also
by restaurants in rural areas
like Cuba and Espanola and Tia
Amaria and places like that. Um,
these young people are the
future and the message this bill
sends is clear. You are better
off leaving the state and
starting your business where
small business is more supported
and more appreciated.
Should by some miracle this bill
failed this session. I urge the
sponsors to do what they've kind
of not done yet, which is meet
with the New Mexico Restaurant
Association have a real good
faith dialogue and conversation
and come up with something that
our small business can work for.
I ask you to vote no.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Gerald
Hamilton. I own and operate 5
small assisted living facilities
in Albuquerque and Edgewood.
Um, I've talked to a number of
my employees, not all, but a
number of my employees and
universally they tell me they
don't like this bill. Um, I
stand in opposition to the bill.
My employees don't want to pay a
tax for the benefit, and they're
afraid of the abuse that they
would uh see among their
co-workers and the, the
corresponding increase in their
workload when people abuse the
lead that maybe um given to them
by this bill as a business
owner, I'm concerned about the
operational hardships that this
would create for my businesses
in each of my facilities.
My assisted living facilities, I
have about a dozen employees. If
one or two of those people are
out at the time, I would not be
able to continue to deliver the
level of services that we
provide, and I would have to cut
back. Other similar businesses
in healthcare would have to cut
back their services as well. So
this would create an access
problem for people that need our
services and would increase uh
the costs that would be passed
on to the customers. I used to
support, to uh not support this
bill and to give it a do not
pass in this committee.
Good morning. My name is Bridget
Dixon. I'm the president CEO of
the Santa Fe Chamber of
Commerce. While we appreciate
the amendments made to House
Bill 11, we remain deeply
concerned about its long-term
financial impact on businesses.
Employers are already struggling
with rising costs, and this bill
adds another layer of payroll
taxes that could force tough
decisions, reducing wages,
cutting jobs, or increasing
prices. The fiscal impact
statement shows that the program
costs will escalate
significantly over time.
This raises concerns about the
long-term sustainability of the
fund and the potential need for
future tax increases or benefit
reductions. Businesses need
predictability, and the current
structure of HB 11 creates too
much uncertainty. We urge
policymakers to consider to make
a more balanced approach, one
that supports employees while
ensuring businesses can remain
competitive and financially
stable. For these reasons, we
cannot support HB 11. Thank you.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
Senate. Uh, my name is Eric
Rasmussen. I'm a small business
owner in Albuquerque. Uh, it's a
family owned business, um,
This bill, like as, as many
small business owners know it's
extremely difficult to run a
small business. It's crushing to
run a small business here in
this state and this would be
just one more burden in addition
to this new burdens that have
recently been placed upon us.
Um, it is not easy to find
replacement employees,
especially for such a short
period of time, and then that
just compounds the problem
because then if I have to do
find somebody, get them trained,
which takes approximately 90
days.
Now I've have to fire them or
let them go. Now unemployment,
now my unemployment insurance is
gonna go up as well. So, uh,
while I can empathize with
everybody that needs to paid
family medical leave. I also
have an uh over 30 year
background in healthcare, uh, I,
I have empathy for those folks,
but right now small place is
being crushed and this will just
continue the crutches.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Carol White. I'm the CEO
of the New Mexico Restaurant
Association, and I'm here to
express our strong opposition to
House Bill 11. Well, we
recognize the importance of
supporting families during
critical times, we have
significant concerns regarding
the fiscal implications
administrative burdens and
potential negative impacts on
our state's restaurants. The tax
burden and the compromise bill
is significantly better than the
taxes proposed in the original
bill.
But the fiscal impact
shows it to be insolvent in year
one in a high uptake scenario
and year 2 in a middle uptake
scenario. Also, the lack of
dedicated funding source for the
well Child Benefit Fund raises
serious concerns about the
sustainability of this program
without clear appropriations and
funding mechanisms, the burden
to pay for this tax will
ultimately fall on the
taxpayers.
So while the intentions behind
House Bill 11 are commendable.
The consequences for our working
families and economy are
troubling. We urge you to
reconsider this legislation and
explore alternative solutions
like House Bill 446 that support
families without imposing undue
tax burdens on New Mexico's
working families. Thank you.
Thank you. So we've had 10 in
opposition so far. We have 5
spots left.
We will stick with the 5 spots,
so I'll let you all thumb
wrestle it out in the back to
see who finishes that off.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, members of the
committee. I'm Kelly Fajardo.
I'm here on half of the New
Mexico Farm Bureau. I'll keep my
remarks brief because we do have
folks online ready to give their
testimony. The New Mexico farmer
does not support HB 11, just
like the rest association, we
have not been invited to the
table. We represent thousands of
employees, employers, um, they
would like to participate. We
have we have concerns about how
this legislation will impact our
agricultural producers. The
additional expenses and
employment burdens will strain
our agricultural businesses that
already operate on a narrow
margin.
Thank you.
Thank you.
fast
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Bianca Gutierrez. I'm
the registered lobbyist for the
New Mexico Grocers Association,
and I'm not going to be
repetitive on what everybody
else has said, but I do want to
add that the grocery stores, we
have all the mom and pop shops.
They already run at about a 15
to 20% vacancy rate.
And with passage of this bill,
the grocery prices, New Mexico
already has the 6 highest
grocery prices in the nation,
you will see another
considerable increase. Thank
you.
Madam Chair, senators, my name
is Ramona Goolsby, and I am here
today as a concerned consumer.
If this bill passes, I will have
neighbors who will have their
taxes increased, Wordsmith to
premium.
I will go to businesses who will
have their taxes increased. The
businesses will have to raise
costs to stay in business. I
asked my dentist how he was
going to cover for his hygienist
when she's out for 12 weeks for
maternity or 6 weeks, he said, I
can't. That means that I will
have to wait longer for
professional services.
That other New Mexicans who are
already waiting extended periods
of time will have to wait even
longer and we'll probably have
to pay more. Thank you.
Hm
Good morning, chair and members
of the committee. My name is
Beth Dowling. I'm from Sandoval
County.
I want you to know I
The impact on employees is not
necessary for you to consider
with this bill to qualify for
leave, House Bill 11 requires an
employee to have contributed to
the paid family leave fund for
at least 6 months in the 12
months prior to their
application for leave. So this
isn't an automatic benefit. You
go get hired and in a week, you
can then take paid family
medical leave. They have to be
employed for 6 months, which
isn't being.
Disgust
In addition, higher taxes on
employees that aren't going to
benefit from this bill need to
be discussed and go back to the
drawing board. Thank you.
I met him sure members of the
committee, Jason Espinoza
speaking on behalf of the
Associated General Contractors
Mechanical contractors, sheet
metal contractors and AO which I
stand in opposition to the
legislation. Uh, first
construction projects really do
run on strict schedules when
workers take extended leave,
it's not just a staffing gap. It
disrupts entire project
timelines, delaying completion
and increasing costs for
contractors, clients, and
taxpayers on public projects.
Unlike office jobs, these are
roles that cannot easily be
covered with.
temporary workers. Uh, second,
construction at work is
specialized in safety sensitive,
bringing in short-term
replacements for skilled trades,
isn't always possible. And when
it is, it raises serious
construction construction sites
depend on experience and
teamwork, gaps in personnel
increase the likelihood of
accidents. Uh, this one size
fits all approach does not work,
stand in opposition. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Jason. All
right, so we do have just
because of time, um, we will be
going to continue um public
comment online, uh, and then
that will give the house, uh,
sponsor an opportunity to
respond. However, because
Senator Wirth needs to get down
to the floor. He is going to
offer up a quick amendment
because of a typo in the bill.
work and I'm, I'm not sure it's
a tight, well, I think it is a
typo. I'm gonna yield to this,
the sponsors on page 11 line 1,
section C, the dates as
currently beginning January 1st,
2027. I think that was supposed
to be July, which is consistent
with paragraph D, so I yield to
the sponsor to make sure that's
correct. It's just delays by 6.
It makes the 2 time starting
time periods line up.
Exactly, Madam Chair and
Senator, I appreciate it. We, we
just caught that.
It's just a very minor um just
difference that we didn't catch.
So that is a friendly amendment.
Right. Is there any opposition
to the amendment?
no that it is adopted.
So I'm sure, I do need to go
down and start the floor. I
think it's very important that,
and I appreciate what you're
doing, giving plenty of time for
public input and for members to.
Have time on this bill. I'll
make sure that
whip on the, on both sides,
excuses members up here.
Keep in touch about what's
happening. Absolutely.
Thank you, Senator Wirth. All
right, so now we are going to go
ahead and go online, um, I do
want to make sure, uh, we have 3
still in support, and then um we
have
9 in opposition. Um, what we're
going to do is, uh, we will hear
from the 3 in support. I will
recognize the 9 that are in
opposition and then, um, going
to pick a uh uh 3 people to
speak in opposition, uh, as
well. So, um, if we, we're gonna
go ahead and go with Reinhardt
Lorenz, who is in favor, and
then um I'm
You're right, um, I'm gonna go
ahead. A West.
OK, and then Francine, and then
what we will do is we will go to
Alison Riley, Debbie Moore.
Um, I'm gonna recognize that
Terry Cole from uh the
Albuquerque Chambers on there,
but, um, we'll recognize that
she is in opposition and then go
to Larry Reagan, uh, to go ahead
and speak, but we do have all of
these names that are recorded.
So Reinhardt, if you will,
please go. You will get one
minute. You will see a 32nd
warning in your chat to wrap it
up. If you do go over one
minute, we will cut your mic. So
go ahead and start.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Reinhardt Lorenzo and
I'm the owner of First IFilms, a
film production company in
Albuquerque as a local small
business, we are part of the New
Mexico film industry that has
brought millions in revenue to
the state, and hundreds of new
jobs to New Mexicans, offering
paid leave will build trust and
loyalty for film workers.
Employees are larger film
productions who are covered
under union agreements are
protected with regards to health
insurance, retirement plans, and
paid sick leave, but the
proposed bill and paid family
leave
would allow us to care for these
employees even better.
For these productions, payments
into the program would be
minimal compared to workers'
comp contributions. Businesses
with fewer than 5 employees or
66% of New Mexico businesses and
many of our film businesses,
including mine.
would not pay a dollar into the
program while they and their
employees would still receive
the benefits. Please support
House Bill 11. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Uh, a West
Sarkash, if you can go ahead and
unmute your mic, you have one
minute.
Hello, Madam Chair, members of
the committee, this is a Westar
cash with small business
majority of public policy
director. I stand stand in
strong support of HB 11 because
we know small businesses across
the state need to be able to
operate and um compete on a
level playing field. The only
way to do that is to offer
comprehensive benefits like what
we find in HB 11. Both people
and support and opposition have
talked about the
difficulty of hiring a
workforce, and it's because none
of us would apply or want to get
a job from someone who does not
offer paid family medical leave.
This is one of the important
ways to do that. Um, one thing I
would recommend is that we
increase the amount from 6 weeks
to 9 weeks because it has to be
similar to other larger
corporations that already offer
paid leave, um, but most small
businesses in the state are
Itching to be able to provide
these benefits and HP 11 is a
sustainable and affordable way
for them to do that. Thank you.
Thank you, Weston. Now we go
lastly to those in support,
Francine Campos, uh, if you
will, unmute your mic. You have
one minute.
Hello, um, good, good afternoon,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Francine
Campos. I'm the director of
human resources for a large
aerospace company in New Mexico.
Um, I also sit on a lot of
boards, nonprofit boards in New
Mexico and California. I'm also
the proud member of Main Street
Alliance and the co-chair of
Women in Business, Professional
Development Committee for the
Albuquerque Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce, I strongly support the
New Mexico House Bill 11. This
bill would provide essential
support to New Mexico families,
allowing workers to take the
necessary time.
off without the fear of losing
income or employment. Small
businesses are the backbone of
our community, yet struggle to
offer paid leave to employees
who are in need.
These type of bills have been
implemented in other states and
continue to work and help
support their communities. These
bills have not only done that,
but these trained businesses and
also improve their well-being of
their employees. This policy
will train New Mexico with uh
workplace morale, improving
productivity and supports
economic growth, with little or
no contribute um contribution.
New Mexico has the opportunity
to lead ensuring businesses
sustainability while allowing
employees to care for themselves
and their family. I urge
thoughtful
consideration of this bill, our
businesses, employees, and
communications Nina. Thank you
for your consideration.
Thank you so much. All right,
before we go to opposition, I do
want to recognize, uh, those who
have registered in opposition.
We have Mark, we have Howard
Hutchinson, Larry Reagan, Kathy
Kamal, Alison Riley, LaDonna
Clayton, Debbie Moore, Peter
Campos, and Terry Cole. We are
going to hear from randomly
Larry Reagan, Alison Riley, and
Debbie Moore, but we do have the
rest of you, uh, registered as
uh an opposition. So Larry,
you're gonna go first, if you
will, on unmute.
yourself, you will have one
minute. You'll see the 32nd
warning in the chat. Go ahead,
Larry.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. I'm Larry
Reagan, president of New Mexico
Farming Livestock Bureau. We, we
are the state's largest ag
organization with over 20,000
members. Uh, we, we strongly
opposed to House Bill 11. It
would impose a real hardship for
farmers, ranchers and small
business owners.
In addition to all the reasons
it's already stated, there is no
pool of temporary workers for ag
labor. So, uh, this, this, this
bill would uh
be a tremendous hardship and we
strongly urge you to oppose it.
Thank you.
Thank you. And so we have Alison
Riley next, and then we'll be
followed by Debbie Moore,
Allison, you have one minute.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Alison Riley, public policy
director for the New Mexico
Chamber of Commerce, and while
we appreciate the intent behind
this bill, we must respectfully
oppose. This bill introduces new
taxes at a time when employers
and employees are struggling.
Early analyses indicate that the
fund could become insolvent
within 2 years, potentially
requiring further taxpayer
support. This introduces
unpredictability and discourages
businesses looking to expand or
relocate. The economic risks and
financial burdens associated
with this legis
l ation could ultimately
outweigh its intended benefits.
While we all support family
leave, but New Mexicans deserve
a sustainable fiscally
responsible approach, and
therefore we ask you to vote no
on HB 11. Thank you.
Thank you so much, uh, lastly,
Debbie Moore, you have one
minute.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members, uh, as
stated, my name is Debbie Moore
and I'm present CEO of the
Greater Las Cruces Chamber of
Commerce. Uh, I try not to
repeat some of the things that
have been said, but this
legislation has undergone
several re iterations over the
past few years, yet it remains
of great concern to our business
community, and therefore we
continue not to support its
passage, uh, not only will it
raise taxes for New Mexico.
There's no identified, confirmed
funding formula which could uh
rely on legislative
appropriations and
the future does not include
guardrails around uh WSD's
authority to adjust the benefit
in the event of surpluses in the
fund as opposed to adjusting the
rate. Based on what has been
said before, we respectfully
urge you to say no on this
legislation. Thank you very
much.
Thank you, Debbie. Um, also,
just for the record, we had two
others that showed up in uh
support Jess Clark and Artemis
Tesero. So, but we're not gonna
go to those, uh, we are going to
go back to the bill's sponsor.
Uh, you have 5 minutes. There
are a lot of points brought up
there that you can um hopefully
address in 5 minutes. Um, thank
you very much, Madam Chair. Now,
I first want to address the
concern that employees are gonna
be way away from work, um, it
comes up every time we talk
about this bill.
And it's a point that I wish I
didn't have to bring reiterate
again, and that is.
If an individual is sick.
And need up to 6 weeks of leave.
They will leave the workplace.
The bill does not create
illness. It does not cause
pregnancy.
It simply provides support for
individuals who have those
conditions are about to deliver
a baby or adopt a child. It does
not create the situation. So
when I hear um from
The the criticism that.
This is going to create a
hardship on the business, the
bus, the hardship already
exists, but what it does is it
ensures that the employee has.
Wage replacement and circum
circumstances and and job
protection in other situations.
And it also has shown that
individual employees are more
likely to return to their their
home employer.
So it is a win for employers not
a loss.
Also, Madam Chair, I would point
out that large companies in the
state have programs like this
already. This helps our small
businesses compete with larger
businesses, and the state is
providing support for those um
those businesses by offering
something that might be
considered a comparable program,
so it assists with small
businesses competing for
employees. We know that there is
a low participation rate in the
state employee.
participation rate and I, I
submit to you that this bill
will help increase participation
because it provides avenues for
employees to take time off when
necessary and they will not need
to leave employment entirely.
that we have made, we heard many
employers concerned about the
cost of the program, and we have
lowered it, Madam Chair,
significantly by limiting the
number of weeks to 6 weeks. I
would point out to you that in
other states where these kinds
of programs exist, the average
usage of medical leave, the
medical leave piece is 7 weeks.
So it is very much in line and
it is very comparable to what.
actually taken and it's also
comparable to a disability plan
that I had when I was working,
which was 6 weeks. So you know
it would be great if we could.
Do more in the future and maybe
we will be and we can look at
the program as it as it has been
in place for a few years and we
can see and it's always open to
adjustment to increasing, but I
think this is a a good way to
phase in the program and it is
still a very generous plan. We
have lowered the premiums
significantly so that an
employer will be paying 0.1%,
0.15%.
Remember that point 15% and the
employee will be paying 2%, and
that amounts for a minimum wage
employee to $1 a week, and for
the employer it amounts.
To
Um, let me see, weekly, $2.88.
No, I don't have the employer
cost right here, but I think
it's 75 cents a week, madam
chair. So again, we have brought
the cost down significantly. I
would also point out for
employers with fewer than 5
employees, the employer premium
is waived, they do not have to
pay into the program, um, Madam
Chair. So, um, we have listened
to the stakeholders. We have
conferred with the chamber.
The um restaurant association, I
dispute that we have not
discussed the bill with them,
and I think this reflects much
of the input that we have
received. It's a compromise bill
that was acceptable to the
house, and I will point out,
Madam Chair, raising the the um.
The the bill from 6 weeks to 9
weeks would increase the cost of
the program.
From between 124 million and 143
million and so I would suggest,
Madam Chair, that although I
appreciate where the advocates
are coming from and and uh I
think at this point, we would
like to stay with the 6 weeks.
There's always opportunities
moving forward in a few years to
look at that again, Madam Chair.
Thank you so much,
Representative. We now go to the
committee.
Senator Ramos, Madam Chair,
thank you and thank you for
being fair and letting so many
people speak.
That being said, this bill is
not fair.
And um Madam Chair and Sander, I
mean, a representative, I'm
sorry.
You know, we've heard from
numbers of people that are
objective to this bill.

The home care and hospice

Uh, the New Mexico Healthcare

slash IDD providers.
Uh, all these people are against
this bill because it's gonna
affect small business and, you
know, that's a real big concern
of mine. And madam chair, I'd
like to ask how many people out
here are actually business
owners.
OK. And how many people here
have uh paid W2 employees.
OK.
Well, and I'm, I'm glad to see
that there is a mix and I
appreciate you all for coming.
Um,
On, on number 7, Madam Chair.
We are looking at
It says item number 7 on page 4,
line 10. It says an individual
who's
Close association.
Can you give me an uh
Can you tell me what you mean by
close association?
Madam Chair, Senator, could you
repeat um the reference page 4.
Line 10 on number 7.
Um, Madam Chair and um, senator,
the entire clause reads an
individual whose close
association with the applicant
or the applicant's spouse or
domestic partner is the
equivalent of a family member.
And Madam Chair and um excuse
me, I'm I'm in representative
mode, um, senator is, um, we
live in a very diverse, a
beautifully diverse state where
there are familial relationships
that are not necessarily by
blood relation, and I think
we're all very proud of that.
And so what this encompasses is
those types of relationships,
madam chair and.
And Madam, uh, chair,
Representative, this just leaves
things wide open. I come from a
huge family.
OK. And then, in Grant County,
we're all related one way or
another.
You know,
uh, I've got the minus family,
we've got the Morales family,
which is Howie Morales's family.
I've got the Seville's family,
so.
I, I would like to see either we
amend this bill and take close
association out.
Or we figure out an actual uh
meaning for close association
because that just leaves a wide
open. That could be your
neighbor. I mean, we love all
our neighbors. I have a, I for,
for where I live in Hurley, I
have tons of friends that I live
next to that are very close
association to me, so what
what's to stop me from or stop
an employee from taking off from
work and uh say, well, my
neighbor here, he needs a little
bit of help and I'm gonna take
off 6 weeks so I could go help
him.
And uh what's to stop them from
doing that, Madam Chair, and uh
representative, Madam Chair and
um senator, a couple of points
I'd like to make and that one is
this um definition is identical
to healthy workplaces Act, which
this body enacted a few years
ago, and that's why we decided
to use it so that there would be
a consistency between the earned
sick leave law that is currently
in place and this long.
Secondly, um, the process
discourages use of the leaves
for anyone who is not a family
equivalent because it requires
the person not to just call in
one day and say I'm taking off
to take care of my neighbor if
that's your hypothesis. Um,
Madam Chair and senator, it
requires to substantiate the
need, and so what would one
would have to show is there will
be um forms and requirements
issued through rulemaking that
will identify how that person
will identify the medical need
if that's what is at issue and
how one will establish that
there's a close familial-like
equivalent relationship, so it
is not a situation, Madam Chair.
someone is simply going to call
in and say they're leaving, they
have to apply for the for the
leave and substantiate the need
and the relationship, Madam
Chair and senator. Madam Chair
Representative, I, I still think
that's really open-ended. Um,
can you please give me the
definition.
On close association.
Um, Madam Chair and um senator,
there is no written definition.
There is, there will be a
rulemaking process where those
those um items will be expanded
upon, and again, Madam Chair,
this is the identical to what is
in the healthy workplaces Act,
which is already in place in the
state, Madam Chair and senator.
Madam Chair, representative, we
still have, we already have
domestic partners, um, spouse,
family.
So why would we need this? And
uh I, I'd like to make the
motion that on line 10 page 4,
we remove close association.
And
With the
And uh on uh, I'm sorry.
Close association with.
And the on line 11.
Manage.
Representer.
As a verbal amendment.
OK, page 4, line 10 on number 7.
it reads an individual whose
close association with the
applicant or the applicant's
spouse or domestic partner.
is the equivalent of a family
relationship.
I would like to uh strike close
association.
With the
Be
Represent representative.
Um, madam
Chair, Senator, um, if you're
asking me if that's a friendly,
it is not a friendly amendment,
as I pointed out, this is in
line with the healthy workplaces
Act, and that makes sense to
keep the definitions um
identical.
OK, so we do need to take a vote
on the amendment.
Uh, is there any other
discussion on the amendment
besides Senator Ramos.
So if you vote yes to support
the amendment or no to decline
the amendment.
Rebecca, if you will.
Taro.
No.
No.
Oh yes
Yes.
No.
So
So, uh, 5 to 30 minutes.
I
Madam Chair, thank you very
much, uh, also, uh, Madam Chair,
Representative, why wasn't there
an actuarial review done since
we have one, we have a great
actuarial person in OSI. They
could have really done a good
job for us and that way we know
exactly what we need and exactly
what you charge. Um, I've, I've
been an insurance agent for many
years. I've sold Aflac. I've
sold the surety that provides
this type of policies, and
there's no way someone's gonna
get one this inexpensive because
that fund
would never last.
So what, why would we uh get an
actuarial review done before we
even present this bill, Madam
Chair Representative.
Um.
Madam Chair, Senator.
The bill outlines what the
requirements of the program,
absent such a requirement, it's
difficult to do an actuarial.
The bill does provide for an
actual aerial study that will
begin on January 1, 2026, and
that will be reported to us in
an adjustments are needed, it
can be done at that time, but an
actuarial study, we, we heard.
businesses and individuals raise
concerns, and this was one of
our, our provisions that we
added, we thought it was an
excellent idea. There will be an
actuarial study, Madam Chair and
senator. Madam Chair
Representative, I, I have
trouble um passing a bill that's
built on an idea when we need to
get facts in front of us before
we um can actually pass this
type of a bill that's going to
affect so many people.
A Madam Chair, um,
representative on the FIR.
Um, it states.
It's risk insufficient
contributions. If enacted in New
Mexico would be the lowest
income states to implement a
PFML program.
The lowest payroll base could
result in a payroll contribution
being insufficient to cover the
needs of the fund.
And that's very worrisome.
Very worrisome for all of us
because when we're putting
together bills here in the state
of New Mexico, we should be able
to fund things to the fullest,
and it's really sad that uh
we're gonna try and, and, uh,
and, and build our, our
employees throughout the state
of New Mexico, but we know that
we have the lowest payroll base
in, in the, in the union.
Um, Madam Chair, um,
Representative
Um
So what's going to happen when
someone has a 1099 and they work
under someone, are they gonna be
able to, are they gonna have to
pay this also and how is that
going to be done if someone's
working on as a 1099 employee.
Um, Madam Chair and senator, if
the 1099 employee person,
because I think the the person
wouldn't be an employee, they
would be a contractor, madam
chair and senator, that person
would be self-employed and that
person has the ability, um,
Madam Chair and senator opt into
the program if they so choose.
And thank you for, for, uh,
correcting me and the
contractor, you're absolutely
correct. I appreciate that.
OK, yeah.
So
You know, usually when a bill is
like this is passed and it's so
devastating to small business.
They, they adjust and uh
You know, I could see.
I, I've been a business owner
for 27 years. If this type of a
bill would have passed 27 years
ago, I applied, I probably
wouldn't be in business right
now.
So what's, what's going to stop
an entity from cutting all their
employees and making them all
part-time.
making sure that they have under
the limited uh uh personality
when it comes to your bill,
Madam Chair, Representative.
Um, Madam Chair and senator.
Um
Comparable programs exist in 13
states, and I believe the
district of Columbia.
Um
All of those states.
Have small businesses.
None of them have experienced
the kinds of doom doomsday
scenarios that you've just
outlined and I actually heard in
public comment.
Um, so I think to expect that
our businesses would go under,
really doesn't give enough
credit to New Mexico businesses.
Why would we think that all of
these other states have been
able to implement such a
program, but here in New Mexico,
our businesses don't have the
wherewithal, the smarts, the
entrepreneurial, um, you know,
commitment to be able to
implement a program that is at a
very small.
costs and indeed has shown to
bring employees back to
employers, not lose employees,
Madam Chair and senator.
Madam Chair, uh, representative.
I, you know, I, I think we do
have some very great business
people and very smart business
people. That's why they're
against this bill, Madam
representative.
So with all due respect.
Um, Madam Chair Representative.
I don't think anyone up here
ever wants someone to lose their
job over sickness, so I feel bad
for the people who have lost
their job over a sickness or an
accident.
I also don't think that anyone
wants to have this close their
doors due to this bill and for
these people to be losing their
jobs either.
You know, a double tax, a tax
that gross pay and then tax that
after they're paid out is
definitely not a good example
for a good deal here in the
state of New Mexico, um.
Mm
You know, whenever we pass
bills, we always have unintended
consequences and I think the
biggest unintended consequences,
having people
Uh, or having employees.
Uh, get cut in hours, get cut in
pay because of a bill like this.
Kind of similar to what we did
with our, with our family
doctors in which we had a huge
unintended consequence. We lost
30% of our, of our doctors in
the state of New Mexico and now
we're big people and trying to
create a different bills to help
them out.
So I, I really, I really, uh,
urge this, this committee to
To, uh
vote against this bill and, and
uh really listen to the people
that are actually out there
paying the employees and, and
they're trying to give them a
better life by creating
employment.
That's all I have for you, madam
chair. Thank you,
Representative. Thank you,
Senator Ramos.
Other questions from the
committee.
All right. Um, before we get to
the vote. Thank you very much
for your comments. I, uh, do you
want to share some concerns, um,
with the, that some have been
hurt as well. Um, I'm wondering,
representative, this is
certainly a different version
from
But PFML has been in the last
couple of years, especially
between what has been kind of
the original and this, if, if
you were to do like bullet
points on that.
Um, yes, madam Chair.
One of the key differences is we
have pulled out.
The bonding component that was
in the original bill that you've
heard over the years and created
a separate funding mechanism
that still provides up to 12
weeks of job protection, but
instead provides this a rebate
program we're calling it, but
it, it's to help support the
family adjust to a new child
within the family and provides
some amount of financial support
so that the family, the parents
can bond with the child, either
through adoption or birth.
That's separated. Then we
maintained largely, Madam Chair,
the structure that has been in
previous bills wherein there's
medical leave exigency leave,
safe leave, bereavement leave,
and we're calling that family
wellness leave, but we've cut
back, um, the amount of weeks
that are available are up to 6
weeks, not 12 weeks or 9 weeks,
there the original bill had 9
and then possibly a step up, and
we've lowered the
premium, um, because of our
ability to move the the
pregnancy piece out to um the.15
and the 0.2. The rest of the
bill is pretty much the same,
Madam Chair and senators.
OK. Thank you very much.
Um, you know, there's, there's
my colleague Debbie from Las
Cruces and I've had a lot of
conversations about this
because, as mentioned, there are
those
Oh.
There.
That couldn't have been more
coordinated than, um, there are
those businesses though that
have specialty employees that
um, you know, not in any way,
uh.
Make it making the skills that
are required to be a server, I
could never be a server because
I am just the biggest klutz and
I have mad respect for servers
and people who are doing
customer service because it's
very hard work.
Um, but there are jobs that
require specialty training. I
think of my dental hygienist as
well. I think of a radiologist,
I think of somebody who has to
have some degree of, of, of, of
skill, expertise and training
and or certification, and they
have every right to be concerned
about this because my colleague
and I have talked about there
isn't a pool of people and um
there have been suggestions
about maybe having a pool of
people who are retired who can
do that because every business
is going to plan for 12 weeks.
They're going to always plan for
the, the longest time because
they have to.
Um, and so have there been
conversations about those
specialty, those specialty jobs,
Madam Chair, yes, there have,
and you know, I, I can
appreciate the concerns, but as
I pointed out, um, Madam Chair
and senators.
The person will leave regardless
if a person needs to leave
because of pregnancy or
adoption, they will leave, um,
and that the um employer will be
facing the same replacement
issue and the like, Madam Chair,
so you know, I I'm sympathetic
um but there are provisions in
the bill that obviously when
you're you're pregnant, you're
gonna be giving um notice to
your employer and the notice may
become obvious over time, um,
Madam Chair, so you'll be
communicating and there.
We
to plan. There are also
provisions in the bill that
require certain notices when you
have the ability to know that
you're gonna have a surgery or
something is coming up that
you'll have to or the employer
will have to adjust, so they, it
encourages the employer and the
employee to communicate about
how much time will be taken in
terms of the medical leave
piece, the um doctor is uh will
be asked to to provide an
estimate of how long the person
may need to be out and so we
recognize, you know, there are
Going to be um growing pains or
adjustment pains, no doubt about
it, but as I, I have to keep
reiterating these individuals
are going to be sick.
That's not going to change
whether or not this law passes,
Madam Chair.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
You know, it, it's it.
The, the comments about still
reeling from the pandemic, um,
you know, I, I don't expect our
small businesses to really kind
of come out of that whole.
Probably another 2 years.
And so the, the idea of having
to kind of climb out of that by
feeling that this is coming down
on them, um, is overwhelming and
it's very scary for every single
small business owner. I think
of, uh, Jerry at Savemart who
has 24 employees, and he's been
the type of person who uh has
helped support a funeral for one
of his, his employees, um, you
know, in many small businesses,
their employees are their
family.
Um, and so, uh, I, I
Can feel the stress, and I can
feel the concern from our small
businesses.
But I also have to look at when
we have these conversations
about
Having no workforce or having
people that aren't willing to
work and how can we recruit and
retain employees as well.
And I don't know if, if this is
the exact solution, but I do
feel that it's a way to do that
because I know that there are
nonprofits and small businesses,
that there's no way they can
afford the Affordable Care Act.
There's no way they can afford
to provide health insurance for
their employees because as much
as I like the, the, the
Affordable Care Act, it's not
friendly for small businesses or
nonprofits. And so they come up
with creative ways to take care
of their employees, nonprofit
that I know of has a 4 day work
week.
And uh they work 10 hours a day
and they get every other weekend
off.
And those are some of the
incentives that I know that
small businesses have really
come to create and employ um to
put in to make sure that their
employees feel um taken care of
and supported and uh if there is
an emergency, and so, um, you
know, I'm, I'm, I'm torn about
this and I've expressed that
with you on a number of times,
uh, because I do see the
opportunity for retention and
recruitment.
But I also see the, the, the
importance of being able to take
care of your employees and
making sure that those employees
feel that they have a place that
that calls them family and that
treats them like family. And so,
um, I, I, I do encourage a lot
more discussion about this. Um,
I've had questions about how
many businesses outside of
Albuquerque have been talked,
and I know that I'll get the
list uh of that because often in
southern New Mexico or any place
below Socorro, we have a
tendency of getting ignored, and
then we get really crabby about
it when it happens.
So, I do.
Encourage that, especially with
the people who are advocating
for this, that those genuine
conversations have, um, because
businesses have every right to
be concerned and and
legitimately worried, um, and I
do feel that this might be one
of those instances that may not,
I hope if I'm wrong, I will
totally uh um acknowledge that
and own it. Uh, so at this
point, I would like to ask what
is the wish of the committee?
Then.
I move to pass.
motion from, I'm sorry.
Substitute motion to table. Hey,
motion to table is not
debatable, so at this point, if
you will, um, that is, that
motion to tables from Senator
Scherer. Uh, if you will,
please.
Rebecca take the vote on a
motion to table, so a yes.
Uh, to table or a no to decline
the table.
Senator Figueroa. No a table.
Senator.
Senator O'Mal. No.
Senator Senator. Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
Senator Wirth.
Senator Burton not a table.
Note to table
The table
The tabling motion has failed,
uh, 4 to 6, um, and so now we go
back to the DuP pass motion.
And that was by Senator
O'Malley.
And where's the 2nd 2nd from
Senator Bergmans.
This committee moves way too
fast for.
Flow through it.
O'Malley and Berkley, and this
is a motion of a do pass.
Senator Figueroa.
Yes
had a meal.
Senator O'Malley.
Oh
No, ma'am.
And.
And it
seemed to explain my vote.
Then your word. Yes.
Perfect.
Yes yes
You did no, no, no, change my
vote
all of us just.
I mean, I, I, I hope there are
people who are wearing brown
pants in this room because we
all just kind of went, wait,
what?
So he didn't get to explain his
vote till after we take count
the votes.
I could, I could see by the
shock on your face that I've
done something bad, right? You
were like they're not supposed
to be looking like that. No, no,
OK, well, we'll correct your
vote to no. Senator Sheriff's
vote is corrected to no.
Thank you for the little bit of
levity.
And it's your hand. Yes.
Senator Wort, yes.
I don't think you, did you call
me?
And when share to worth.
Did you get me? We did, yes.
So on a 6 to 4, you, uh, you now
head to your next committee,
which is Senate Finance.
Thank you everybody for being
here. Thank you. So did you
still want to explain your vote?
I do, yes, OK, so hold on. So
it's just
There seems to be an enormous,
enormous, uh.
Amount of opposition.
I don't think that it's good law
when
When we are divided so
So clearly divided.
Good laws when we have a
majority of people that say,
yeah, that's a good law.
Actually more than a majority,
not not half plus 1.
I personally think that in the
state, it's half.
More than half on my side of
this thing were to no.
All that does is divide us and
tear us apart, and we need to
stop dividing us and tearing us
apart.
So many bills that we've done,
Madam Chair, have just been so
party line. We're not even
allowed to have an amendment,
and all that does is create
animosity among us.
We need to find a way not to
tear ourselves apart. New
Mexico's strong when New
Mexico's strong, but when we
decide to tear ourselves apart.
We're weak
Thank you, Senator Sheriff.
Uh, before we adjourn, I'd like
to thank Sky Boring Kim Lagan
for providing us with breakfast.
Um, thank you everybody for your
