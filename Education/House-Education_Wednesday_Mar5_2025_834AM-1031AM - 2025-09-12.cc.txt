All right. So good morning
folks. So we're going to start
off with House Memorial 43
because we have members in and
out presenting here, there and
everywhere. So um representrola,
good morning, please.
Morning, uh, Mr. Chait,
uh, we have talked, I guess, um,
probably for more than I would
say this decision about the um
Hispanic education or bilingual
education and some of the
feedback that we keep receiving
is our education, Hispanic
Education Act and bilingual
Education Act, um, are not uh
completely funded and we don't
know exactly what is working
some place in our state. So this
is a study.
um, we're asking LESC to study
doing that in our committee,
what is in our state, what is
working, what is supporting our
students and how can we amend
the act or improve the acts to
have the um enough funding to
support the diverse needs of our
students, and with this, Mr.
Sheer it stand for questions.
Hm.
Alright, thank you so much. So,
um, are there folks on Zoom that
are here in support of House
Memorial 43 and wish to speak,
please indicate by raising your
hand.
For for House Memorial 43. Are
there folks in the audience that
are here in support of House
Memorial 43. Please indicate by
raising your hand if you wish to
speak.
All right, so if you wish to
speak, if you would please line
up behind our presenter.
Oh, I saw your hands, yeah.
No, you don't want to speak. Oh,
OK.
It's the first time for
everything.
Right, Opposition.
House Memorial 43 is there
opposition on Zoom to House
Memorial 43?
That populate
In the audience is their
opposition to House Memorial 43.
All right, so we'll come to
committee.
Many represent memo.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative, um, I 100% agree
with this. I think we need to
figure out what is it that um
that we really
Um
As, as uh, as, as Hispanics and,
and those that that this issue
is important too, we need to
figure out.
Is this, um,
The way it it's currently
written this act of serving our
students the way we intended
them to be.
Um, and especially with 60% of
our students being Hispanic.
Um, we need to make sure, um,
not only
That their needs are met, but,
but also that that there there
is the right kind of tools.
For teachers,
To be able to educate this like
ELL students or Hispanic
students or those that that that
uh aren't proficient in in
English language because I know
me as, as a, as a teacher uh who
does not speak Spanish, um,
struggles to uh doing that, so I
think that if the act needs to
be rewritten in a way so that we
could get a different um funding
in there in order to be able to
help the teachers across the
state to be able to meet the
needs of our students. I think
this is excellent, thank you.
Thank you, Representing Garrett.
Uh thank you, Mr. Chair.
Representative, I have one
question.
On page 3.
It's just a technical question.
Line 17, it says the council
shall meet as necessary.
But at least twice each year at
the biannual Hispanic. Oh, I'm
sorry,
sorry.
You're, you're giving represent
Torres Velazquez a heads up.
Heads up so she's not surprised
with that question a little sign
that tells us we have it up
there.
Uh, representing Robert
Caballero, please. Thank you,
Mr. Chair, and, and thank you,
Representative.
And thank you representative for
your comments.
I think to a large extent
because our population is so
predominant in the state, um,
our faces are everywhere, our,
our children are everywhere, I
think it, it's often taken for
granted.
Um, and I think that's what we
need to pay close attention to
is that it's taken for granted
that because we dominate.
Visibly in the state that
everything is hunky dory for for
lack of uh, you know, going well
with us. However, the data that
we have up till now in terms of
our children's progress, Mr.
Chair and Representative
indicates that we stand
We need a lot of improvement,
uh, in many areas that.
Which was the purpose.
Of, um, enacting the Hispanic
Education Act.
And um, so I just wanna make
sure that.
When we undertake this study.
That we stay
Intentionally involved.
Um, as it
Holes
And that we ensure
What I've been
Really just a strong proponent
of along with many others, uh,
my predecessors and.
During my time.
Insisting that we in
institutionalize.
Institutionalized means
embedding.
Everything that we do.
Um, with our children.
The changes so that.
As we
Roll out whatever
recommendations are made. Excuse
me.
That we ensure not just at the
local level, but more more
importantly at the state level
that we ensure
The outcomes are clearly
Articulate it
And um.
And our expectations for our
children's success.
And that's really probably the
most important part of this
study in this, in this memorial,
um, it's not a competitive.
Um, memorial, it's not meant to
compete.
Um, with other uh oppressed.
Um, populations in our state,
but I think that we can be the
leaders as we um roll out.
Um, this particular study and
demonstrating um the tools that
are in place.
And, um, enhancing those tools
that are in place and then
making sure that we do recommend
as a part of this, it has strong
legislate during the process and
after I'm very concerned that
um.
Because
We've not funded.
Appropriately, um, the efforts
in public education department.
It says very clearly in the FI
in the um sorry legislative
education study group analysis.
Um, that that's been one of the
areas that we have failed.
Uh, we've not properly given the
right, Mr. Chair, amount of
attention.
Um, as, as noted in all of the
analysis that were provided to
us. So if we just follow the
analysis and those that
undertake this, Mister Chair, I
meet the expectations and create
some tangible.
Uh, institutional changes across
the board for our children's
future, thank you. And thank you
for bringing this forward. Thank
you, Mr. Chair.
Represent.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you, Representative for
bringing this forward.
For, uh, Mr. Chairman for when
we talk about studying.
And we're talking about
recommendation. I do believe
very strongly in going through
the legislative education study
committee.
You know, as we, as we talk
about it, as we gather
information, um.
Mr. Chairman, Representative,
what types of information in
this part of your moral do we
hope to kind of get that will
give us a picture of how we can.
Address some of these concerns.
Mr. Chairman.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
um, I always believe that as an
educators we don't know I could
tell you what I would hope, but
I'm sure I'm gonna be surprised,
but um what I'm hoping is to
have data.
Of how our students are actually
doing in this we we heard it in
the inner committee that there's
some improvement in some areas,
some students are improving, but
not really, not the students
that we focus in this study. So
that's one of the areas that I
want to see. One of the things
that I would like also to learn
about is what type of dual
language program, what type of
bilingual programs are out
there.
Which ones are making the
strongest impact in our
students.
Um, another is, uh, which type
of, um, um credentials, teachers
are holding who are making the
biggest impact, uh, we have seen
results of when we combine uh
some um uh is strategies in the
classroom or some teachers
preparation make the biggest
impact in our students so we
wanna know which ones are doing
the best, um, And, and, and
thank you, Mr. Chairman, and,
and uh representative.
Um
I agree.
And I agree that
You know, data, we have to use
data.
And we have to figure out one of
the things, Mr. Chairman and
Representative.
Why have we seen a decrease in
bilingual education programs.
You know, I think that's a big
part of me is why is it, is it,
is it staffing? Is it, you know,
the testing, is it the
identification?
The other big thing, Mr.
Chairman, is I, I like the part
about the cultural aspect of it
as well. And, and Mr. Chairman,
a compliment to you and a
Trisco, uh, heritage when we had
our LESC meeting there and we
had the mariachi band was
probably one of the
Places that I was most honored
to walk in as they played as we
came there. So I do believe that
that is a part of it, uh, Mr.
Chairman, that we do look about
it because those types of
activities.
Are about engagement. We want to
give our students, all students.
Not just our Native American
students, not all students a
reason.
Or they can come to school and
they can, you know, do things
that of interest to him.
Because if we can't get them in
their seats, we can't teach them
the reading and the math, so.
Um
Mr. Chairman, the last thing
that I like about this, and I
support this.
is about the students.
And I think that's important
just like we've talked for other
things and we talked about the
middle school reform.
When we talk about issues of
student safety. We have to get
the student voice as well as the
consumers and parent voice.
And and also a a cross
representation of the
Uh, of our students as far as
this, and I'll, I'll say that
they're in recognizable that
there are different views of it.
Um, as a Hispanic, my family's
been here since 1700s.
I, I, I don't share some of the,
the recent films like I've never
been oppressed, um, for, for
this, but not to say that some
have it.
But I think that we need to get
and take a look at and getting
from the students.
What is it that they need?
To support their program to
support their schools.
And that how can we support our,
you know, as far as to retain
that. So I, I support your
memorial. I thank you, and
again, I really appreciate very
much that you made it a study
going through the interim
process. That way we can give it
the time.
And the energy and the attention
needed to make.
Well thought out.
Bonded
Recommendations. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Represent
Mr. Chair and a representative.
Um
coming from a background of
Native American where we
Uh
Only up embrace.
bilingual education and
cultural, but there are some
areas that uh.
We are still lacking and moving
forward, we need to address
those so looking at from that
standpoint into into the study
that's gonna come uh as uh.
that is being proposed.
Uh, one of the things that I
strongly support and have always
supported was parent
involvement.
You need to make sure that the
parents are involved.
And that uh what is
Where do they come from? What,
what do they want? And again,
you can see the diverse in that,
uh, hearing, um.
Representative Montoya talking
about um.
Not being able to speak the
language.
We have many of our young people
that are in that situation, and
yet they have children and so uh
they themselves off the
bilingual education is what
we're finding out.
Otherwise, uh, we call it Nas
Navajo English, they mix it all
together and we're trying to go
back to just, you know.
Uh
Trying to go back to uh.
Make sure that they really speak
the language.
Otherwise, uh, we're, uh,
developing another culture.
So that, that is one area that I
would strongly recommend that
because education comes with
family and um I myself have 5
children, my oldest speaks
fluent Navajo.
My youngest has no idea.
So I said somewhere along the
way as parents we fail.
late, didn't pass on the
language to some of our
children. And then the other one
is that um
When you are in the state of New
Mexico.
And
Yeah, um, as it was expressed
here that
We have um
Diapers
Uh
Groups that are in
And we have to make sure that
the study is not generic and
just say these are Hispanic
speaking people.
And this is the way, this is
what we see, but you're gonna
have to look at uh where they
come from, what communities do
they come from and.
Of what is their language, their
culture like there because it's
not, uh, there's some little bit
of difference.
That was stand and know that so
that uh they would continue that
because that's the group that
they come from.
And uh
So I hope that it's not like
This
study is going cover all and not
look at the difference that may
appear, and that's what I have
seen with some of the studies
that have been done.
And in order to do that, that's
the only way we can be
successful.
Uh, to carry that on them. I
applaud you wish you uh success
at the outcome, the data,
everything will help the
different schools.
And work with them it
takes time comments here
are one of the richness of our
states of diversity, and one
size fits all who never support
whatever.
Don't have anybody to represent
Torres Velasquez.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee and representative,
um, thank you for, um,
Thank you for creating this
memorial. Thank you for inviting
me to sign on, and I'm a proud
co-sponsor. Um, oh, I love the
questions always and, and the
comments from this committee and
it makes the memorial so much
richer. Um, thank you all.
I would like to bring up one
last point that's important to
me, um.
Although the Martinez and Yazi
lawsuits aren't consolidated,
the trial was consolidated.
The Hispanic Education Act and
the bilingual multicultural
Education Act were very
important to the Martinez
lawsuit.
And as we work with the courts
in looking at what has been done
around the lawsuits.
Um, we wish to work with this
committee see and by we, I mean,
all the universe that's involved
in advocacy around Martinez and
Yazi.
And I'm thinking this might give
um some structure to some of the
questions that have been coming
up and some of the things that
came up in the trial that are
important to really look at in
terms of each of the acts, um,
because they are two different
acts, but they do tie together
and very important ways.
So, um, I'm hoping that.
That's part of the examine
what's happening in these.
All right, um, representative,
thank you for bringing this
forward. Um, I know we had a
good discussion last week around
your bilingual unit, um,
Bill and um and thank you to
Director Senna because I think
through um the legislative
Education Study Committee
process is that we used to have
a joke, um, a few years ago in
the legislature and years before
that.
When you have a memorial,
nothing else would happen to
them, but through um the
leadership of, of Director Senna
is that the memorials that we do
pass end up becoming
substantive, um, studies for
which we as a legislature,
because let me, let me remind
members too that um
We
Even though some members might
not be voting members on on LESC
you probably as a member of of
House Education
Committee will be an advisory
member to um the legislative
education Study Committee and
the LESC staff to all of us as
members and so um the guidance
and your expertise, don't, I, I,
I just don't want to give the
perception that we're throwing
it on LESC and then do as you
wish. They're also working
collaboration with.
us on where we would like to go,
who we would like to bring in
the table and they're good about
working with us on that. So
we're not just kicking this to
an outside organization, they do
whatever and then we are working
separate of them. We're working
together on these policies, um,
in, in order to just like the
stated goal here is to improve,
improve the process, improve um
our students throughout the
state, so we're very much and I
want to encourage member.
s to continue being active um in
those discussions um within
those meetings as um
This sort of study um ultimately
rolls out, so um thank you
representative Corola certainly
happy to uh work on this in the
interim and and come up with
good solutions. So Robot
Caballero.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, I move it
to pass on House Memorial 43.
Alright, so we have a do pass
motion on house Memorial 43
seconded by Representative Mino
Amoya, um, is there any
objection to the Du pass motion?
Singan
Yeah do past House Memorial 43.
Thank you, representative. All
right, so we're going to go back
to what had been our first gen
items, so Verlazquez, please
give you a moment to set up.
All right, Representative, when
you're ready.
Mr. Chair, thank you, uh, Mr.
Chair, members of the committee,
we're here, which is relating to
Hispanic education, um, and
protecting the preservation of
New Mexico's heritage Spanish
language in particular languages
and culture, um, even though it
is protected in the
Constitution, we're finding that
it's important to put it into a
bill because um there is a
misperception that it, it is not
uh something that is in law.
And so, um, we're putting it
into this bill, along with a
couple of other elements and
cooking out the piece on
achievement gap because that's a
term that was used when the bill
was first created in 2010, and
we really don't use that term
anymore in 2025. Um, we also
don't use so much opportunity
gap. We, we're
And meeting that goal. Um, when
the case went to trial and it
was uh it was.
It was first in as in every
case, the state tried to dismiss
it and one of the excuses they
gave was very similar to
something that um Representative
Royal Caballero mentioned and
that everyone expects Hispanic
students to do well because
we're the majority population.
But what was used instead by the
attorneys was the race card. And
so the question was, well, um,
They're talking to the judge,
Hispanics are white. It's not
our fault. They're not doing
well. And the judge had nothing,
she, that was one of the two
times I saw her get very angry
in that court.
And so we're here to say also
that Hispanic students are very,
very important in our state. Um,
we are the majority population
in the public schools.
And so we want to make sure that
we do everything we can for
lifelong success for our
students. Um, we are looking
also at parody along the lines
of the advisory councils. We've
had an advisory council since
20. And um,
They have on a voluntary basis,
all of their costs they have
covered on their own, whereas
others, and we would like to
make sure that anyone who is
interested in service, um, the,
the compensation in terms of
mileage and, and the per diem
that um other councils receive.
Um, we're also looking at making
sure that um biennial, biennial
summits, and the council has
been holding summits, um,
regularly, and so we want to put
that into the law.
And, um, not sure if I'm missing
something. I think that might be
it, um, I would like to um ask
our, um,
My expert witness and I am also
going to point out that the
co-chair of the Center for Gomez
Chavez and um
She mentioned, um, but, um,
Do I ask of the expert witnesses
introduced themselves. If they
could introduce themselves and
then we'll go to.
Thank you. Good morning, Mr.
Chairman, members of the
committee. I'm Doctor Candice
Castillo. I'm the deputy
secretary at the publication
department that oversees all of
our student support services,
um, programming with the
Hispanic Education Act being one
of them. Thank you for having.
Good morning, committee. My name
is Julia Rosa Emsley. I'm.
Good morning. Hopefully you all
know me. I'm Representative
Taiamira Valuya. I wanted to
really quick say something, um,
this is the biggest piece for
me, not only the parody, so, so
there's equality within, within
the, the advisory councils, but,
um, the, the, the part that we
added in there about protect and
preserve New Mexico's heritage
Spanish language and culture.
That is huge because um.
Like we said in, in, in the
previous memorial, um, we are,
um.
We, there are so many rich
cultures here and I think, and I
know a lot of northern New
Mexicans are feeling that their
culture and their language is
being lost.
Um, so, so, and I think, and,
and that, that is the language
that's been here for hundreds of
years.
So, so, and, and so being able
to preserve that, that is, that
is New Mexico.
Um, that, that is a part of it.
We've done such a great job, um.
And, and, and I'm, and I'm, I'm,
I'm gonna be excited to see all
of the, the, the, the strides
that we that we uh actually
obtain in the native uh
protecting the Native American
languages, but um I think that
we need to start focusing too on
our heritage languages, and, uh,
and making sure that those
cultures because I want my
grandchildren to know where they
came from.
Um, not only, I mean they're
gonna hear it from me and
they're going to hear the
traditions that got passed on
from, from, from my father who
is who is big with with
traditions, but um, but I want
them to be to to hear it around
there and, and, and those and,
and share it with their with
their students, uh, their, their
fellow students that maybe don't
get it at home.
So
That that is one of the the
major pieces for me and not only
um with a with a lot of these
things, I think, um, I asked a
question in the very beginning
of, of this um.
Um, of this session when we were
talking about budget and, and I,
and I asked about why there was
such a huge difference of of the
funding.
And um and one of the answers
that I got was because the act
uh doesn't require the things
that other acts do. And I think
that's um a lot of this is, uh,
so that was one of our major
goals is OK, so let's start
looking at them and um realizing
that we do need the funding.
It's just we need the right
wording in there to open up that
funding, and I think this is,
this is a start.
Thank you.
Mr. Chair, I failed to mention a
very important um expert that we
have with us today, Patricia
Trujillo from the Great. Thank
you so much.
And with that we stand.
Thank you. So we'll go to our
audience, so folks on Zoom, if
you're hearing support of House
Bill 487 and wish to speak.
Please indicate by raising your
hand.
With that populate and then
folks in the audience, if you're
here to speak in support of
House Bill 487. Would you please
indicate by raising your hand?
All right, if you would, please
line up behind our presenters,
you will have up to 2 minutes.
Please welcome, you have up to 2
minutes.
OK, bueno Diaz, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee, thank
you so much for listening and
hopefully supporting uh this
important bill. I'm Jennifer
Gomez Chavez, and as you've
heard, I serve as the co-chair
for the Hispanic Advisory
Council. We are celebrating our
quinceanera of the Hispanic
Education Act here in New
Mexico, we are blazing the trail
nationally, and we want to
continue that.
As a 23 member, uh, Hispanic
education council, we are in
support of this bill and its
support of the changes, um, that
you have heard.
The first, of course, is that we
are the only counsel that does
not receive.
Per diem, mileage and per diem.
We have been operating in this
mode since 2011, and for us, we
are passionate, passionate,
committed to this work. And so
we have not, uh,
Demanded this or required this,
but now we've discovered that
we're the only ones without
this. So we're hoping that you
will support so that we can
bring all of our uh council
members from across the state,
the council represents many
leaders, educators, business
owners from across the state to
um discuss, uplift, and make
recommendations to uh the
secretary.
Um, the other thing in regards
to Spanish heritage, uh, the
protection and preservation for
us, it's key, you've heard from
Representative Baca in the
memorial previously how
important it is to bring forth
Identity, cultural identity, so
that our students and even their
families feel like they can see
themselves in the educational
system so that they're motivated
to come to school and we
recognize and honor them.
Thank you so much.
Please. Good morning, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Loretta Trujillo and I'm
the executive director of
Transform Education in Mexico,
and we stand in full support of
this bill. I'd like to, um,
uplift two points. One is that
language and culture go together
like land and water, and our
relationships to the lands here
runs so deep.
At a time when our nation is
divided on these things. I'm
proud that our state is not.
You all have remained dedicated
to preserving the rights of
language and culture, and this
is an example of that leadership
that we're inviting you to all
engage with at this time. I want
to uplift the voice of someone
from Chama, New Mexico, a young
woman named Annaia Romero. Over
the last year and a half
transform engaged 150 young
freedom dreamers from around the
state, but in northern New
Mexico, in the village of Chama,
this was her single highest
priority because the language of
my family is dying.
And I appreciate Representative
Mea Al Moya for pointing that
out. As a career educator with
20 years in the classroom,
that's nearly 2000 students that
I've personally worked alongside
of. And I can say in the city of
Santa Fe, culture is sometimes
Dying.
And it's because we need the
materials, we need the
curriculum, we need the
pedagogy, and we need the
opportunity to stand in support
of our students. So I ask you to
vote on their behalf. Thank you
very much.
Thank you.
You're welcome. You have up to 2
minutes.
Good morning. Good morning to
and members of the committee. My
name is Mandy Torres. Um, I'm
the education reform director
for New Mexico. However, today
I'm here, um, as a member of the
Hispanic Education Advisory
Council. Um, and as it concerns
parent. How you spend your money
is reflective of your values, so
the saying goes, get funding for
our historic acts was zeroed out
in two of the three proposed
budgets this year, despite much
concern that we have yet to meet
the obligation that the Martinez
Yazi ruling has set before us.
I'm thankful for legislators
like the bill sponsors who have
been relentless.
and asking why. My oldest
daughter is in 5th grade, and I
can only recall twice when
Hispanic culture was
acknowledged in school. Once
during a unit covering the house
on Mango Street and a unit about
the ancient mine and Aztec
civilizations. My daughter
doesn't really like school, but
she's excited about middle
school because she can finally
take a Spanish class.
Validating students means
schools must use students'
experiences and perspectives as
tools for better instruction
every single day. By recognizing
students' backgrounds and
identities, we can create
connection and make it more
likely that students will not
just come to school, but they
will be engaged and like being
there.
This is why it is crucial to
support the Hispanic Education
Act, the first of its kind in
the nation. We must preserve a
language that has been lost to
so many to so many because the
education system historically
tried to erase it. Our Hispanic
students who make up the
majority in New Mexico student
population must be consistently
provided with more opportunities
to see themselves in their
learning. It is also only fair
that those serving on councils
for all of our acts be treated
equally with equal opportunity
to be compensated for their time
and equal opportunity for a seat
at the.
table with a Hispanic education
summit where council members,
parents, and students have the
opportunity to lead discussions
about what our students need. I
urge you to vote yes on HB 4807
to ensure that our values are
aligned with what our students
need and want for success. Thank
you.
Thank you.
Welcome. You have up to 2
minutes, please, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, my
name is Doctor Patricia Trujillo
and I'm the deputy cabinet
secretary for the Higher
Education Department. And when
I'm not working in government, I
am a proud professor of Chicana
and Chicano literature with a
specialization in North Central
New Mexican literature, and
there is such a specialization,
um, and I've, uh, really proud,
um, to, uh, also extend the
spirit of this, um,
Bill to higher education, uh,
the agency stands in technical
support, and we celebrate that
the agency for the first time is
named in this bill, uh, because
we believe here in the state
from a cradle to career
perspective on education, and,
um, as higher ed, we have a lot
to offer. We can be a liaison to
our higher ed institutions, uh,
for instance, New Mexico
Highlands that has the Institute
for Culturally and
Linguistically responsive
learning and teaching, uh, to
help us prepare the pre-service
teachers, uh, who are, uh,
you know, are going to be those
teachers in the classrooms. Um,
so, uh, I know that PED works
with our teacher prep programs
directly, but we also have a lot
to offer in terms of support.
And also, I just want to point
out that in the state of New
Mexico, 52% of our bachelor's
degree earners are Hispanic, and
so there is also a need for us
to think about what it means to
be Hispanic serving
institutions, which all of our
institutions current, we
currently have those
designations at all of our
public institutions, um, rather
than just Hispanic enrolling.
institutions, and so, uh, I
think the sponsor for bringing
this bill forward and stand for
any questions after, if anybody
has some.
Great. Thank you. Please,
welcome. Hello, my name is
Georgia Royal. I spent 20 years
with Roberto Moragon, developing
bilingual educational materials
based on New Mexico culture. And
I want to say New Mexico has a
chance to be the leader.
In terms of both Spanish and
Native American languages. It
should be
You know, they should be
recognized not only language but
culture, they go together.
Um, our constitution.
States that, you know,
instruction should be given in
Spanish.
And I always, when I think of
these issues, I always think of
A child walks into the room.
Nobody looks like him.
Nobody talks like him.
And none of the materials.
Talk about who he is and how you
feel so out of place.
Particularly
The people that are
Heirs to
You know, the original settlers
in New Mexico are very ignored.
Um, so I want to see New Mexico
be even better than the Quebec
of United.
Thank you. Welcome. You have up
to 2 minutes, please.
I'm here to support uh.
This legislate, you'll see,
you'll see I'm Daniel Antonio
Herrera
like a little little history
lesson. I used to be a teacher
in the Mountaineer Public
schools and also in Berlin.
Uh, about Manzano, and there's
other places like Monzon, many
other places.
Who have indigenous roots. In my
case, it was my
Grandmother, who was, she had
ended.
Apache
And oddly enough doing some
research.
Uh, the Pueblo Maggiano and many
other pueblos, um, such as
Abiquiu.
We knew that we had a lot of
Native American blood in us
anywhere from 40 to 60 to 80%.
We were isolated and that's
where we got our wives and
husbands way back then, well,
that's who we are and that's who
our language is.
Heritage language, so many of
the words that we think are
Spanish are not
coyote
uh take a lot goes on and on,
and I'm proud of that.
And I'm proud of my Apache
grandmother.
Great. Thank you. So we'll go to
the folks that are joining us on
Zoom.
Elisa
Good morning. You have up to 2
minutes, please.
Yes, good morning, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Elisa Begueeria, and I
serve as the superintendent of
Lake Arthur Municipal Schools.
I am a member of the Hispanic
Education Advisory Council, and
a mom of two Hispanic bilingual
young ladies. I am here today in
strong support of House Bill
487. This bill enhances the
Hispanic Education Act, while
ensuring the preservation of our
Spanish heritage language and
cultural identity.
Additionally, this bill calls
for support for the Hispanic
Education Advisory Council.
Since we are the only education
advisory group in the state that
does not receive mileage or per
diem.
As one of the 23 members of this
council, I can attest that we
dedicate our time and expertise
to improving educational
outcomes for Hispanic students.
Without the same support as
other advisory groups.
Providing basic compensation for
our work, not only ensures
fairness, but also builds a
network of advocates who can
expand and enhance programs
statewide.
This is an investment in our
students and the future of New
Mexico. I urge you to support a
House bill for 87 to preserve
our heritage, support our
communities, and create lasting
opportunities for Hispanic
students.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Lawrence, good morning,
Lawrence. You have up to 2
minutes, please.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee. I am
representing in Laa, New Mexico.
We were founded, uh, 25 years
ago by the WK Kellogg Foundation
to increase access and success
in education.
And
15 years ago, we joined forces
with many community partners to
advance the Hispanic Education
Act.
I am proud to stand with all of
my colleagues and partners to
support this important
legislation. I'd like to thank
our legislators for your support
of this initiative. I would also
like to thank the leadership of
the New Mexico Public Education
Department and the New Mexico
Higher Education Department for
their ongoing collaboration and
support. I want to thank
Representative uh Velasquez or
Torres Velasquez for her
leadership to move this forward
and thanks to Dr. Jennifer.
Gomez Chavez for her leadership
to continue to advance the
Hispanic education Act.
I served for over a decade on
the Hispanic Education Advisory
Council and um we thank you all
for supporting this important
legislation.
Thank you.
Yeah
Doctor Marlene Melendez. Good
morning. You have up to 2
minutes, please.
Thank you and thank you
committee and representatives
for the good work that you do
every year.
I am coming in support of House
Bill 487. I'm a I'm a member of
the HA, the Hispanic Advisory
Council.
And I, um, I just want to give a
little narrative, um, why I come
today is because it's really
important that we don't forget
our Hispanic students.
When I was a doctoral student. I
had a wonderful chair.
Uh she was African American,
originally from Georgia.
And she told me this story
because often she would talk
about how wonderful it was to go
home. How wonderful her, her
home was and how her family, she
missed her family and how
beautiful it was there.
And I asked her one day why she
didn't return, and she said
this, that when you become the
minority majority, you become
invisible.
And in that invisibility,
people, people.
tend to ignore.
That culture, that race.
What I'm asking is that you
don't let our Hispanic children,
or our students become
invisible. I understand that
we're the minority majority.
And that we're all learning
within this education system,
but supporting our culture.
And supporting our students and
understanding their history and
giving him the root of
understanding will support them
throughout their education and
bring them back to New Mexico,
where we need the support
economically.
So again, my name is Doctor
Marlene Melendez as a member and
a colleague of PA.
I understand how hard my
colleagues work amongst students
amongst our, our neighborhoods,
our communities, our parents are
superintendents, our teachers.
Please consider passing Bill
487. Thank you very much and
have a wonderful day.
Thank you.
All right, so we will move to
opposition. Is there any
opposition to house bill for 87
on Zoom, please indicate by
raising your hand in our
audience, is there any
opposition to House Bill 487.
Right? I'm not seeing anybody.
Represent
Excuse me, thank you, Mr. Chair
and um.
Thank you, Representative and
sponsors, co-sponsors, I'm very
happy to join everyone on this
piece of legislation that's
extremely important. My, one of
the, um.
Best things that happened to me
when I, uh, Mr. Chair.
Uh
Got sworn in in 2013 was to have
Representative Meera.
Uh, who headed the, uh, House
Education Committee at my side,
he was the majority leader and
um I.
Was uh proud to learn a lot from
from him about the legislative
processes, but more importantly,
how dedicated he was to Hispanic
Education Act and all of.
What we envisioned as
transforming our educational
system, uh, on behalf of all our
communities of color in the
state of New Mexico.
I also, Mr. Chair, am a proud
original founder of Chicano
Studies.
That dates back to 1969, I just,
and we envisioned, Mr. Chair,
um,
An education system.
That not only provided access
and opportunity.
Through our educational system.
For our children, but also um
one in which they could envision
their own future.
Um, and envisioning their own
future, in my view, and this is
uh uh something that I've been
bringing up since I've been
elected and before all the 56
years that I've been involved,
my husband in the audience, it
was also and so, um.
But I, I want to clarify
something, Mr. Chair, that's
really important that when we
talk about culture, it goes
beyond what we wear.
It goes beyond what, how we
dance. It goes beyond um our
music.
Our culture is embedded in our
worldview.
It's how we enter the classroom
and, and we bring that.
Those rich traditions, Mister
Chair, from our homes.
Um, and not just the language,
but.
People have to understand that
how we view the world.
is very different.
And different is good.
When we bring those differences
to the classroom.
Um, we're actually enriching the
classroom.
Mr. Chair, enriching the other
students, we're not at risk.
And many of you have heard me
say this over and over again. I
I just
Cannot handle.
The um
Titles were the words that we
give and that we throw out
because if we tell a child or
even say, Mister Chair, at risk,
and they hear that.
What are we doing to that
child's mentality, and that
child's view.
Why
Why are they at risk? We should
be elevating.
That and talking about how
they're come with their
language, come with the rich
cultural traditions come with
their worldview, and they enrich
our classrooms.
And that's the approach that I
keep talking about
institutionalizing. We have to
change that worldview ourselves.
The way we view things so that
we can change our approaches. So
that brings me to my question. I
have.
One question.
Um
That I'm very concerned about.
Um, because right now, as we
know, our educational system is
under attack.
Um, Mr. Chair, and I love this
bill because it uses the
terminology and the
introduction, it says protection
and preservation.
Protection and preservation.
The more that we can interject
in our legislative.
Process protection and
preservation and all that we do,
Mr. Chair, my question is, um,
we made a move from replacing
educational success.
With academic success.
Can someone, Mister Chair, speak
to why we made that.
Change.
Mr. Chair and Representative
Caballero, that's an excellent
question.
We, we played around with what
wording to use in that section.
And we felt that educational
success kind of went with what
you just described.
Is this a good student? Are they
on the honor roll? Are they
making the grades? Are they, you
know, are they hitting the
marks, and we felt more
important than looking at points
or grade point averages or that
type of thing that we wanted for
all.
Academic worldview.
So that they could get a taste
of everything that was available
to them and make their own
choice in their academic
careers. And so that was why the
difference between educational
and academic. And I can't.
Doctor Emsley, but, um, you,
you're welcome to add. OK.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and, and
thank you for that.
I, I, um, I just don't want us
to lose.
The holistic.
Approach
Um, and confine our evaluation
of progress.
Solely on the academic, that
sort of defeats now I'm, I know
you're fine, um, and we're not
doing that. I know that we are
enhancing, but in in
And as part of that.
That we
Ensure what I just described.
That approach.
Um, so that
Our children don't also see Mr.
Chair.
Um, that they're.
Soul roll
In this educational setting.
is to
Only achieve.
Academic success, that's that's
ultimately what we, what we want
to see, of course, because we
know um in the future, but.
One final point of why I think
this is so important is that.
When I also identify myself as
woman.
And the reason I do that is
obviously that is my makeup, um,
with a father who's tribal, a
mother and.
But the beauty in.
Promoting our children, our
classroom and coming is that
part of that cultural tradition
that we bring to the classroom
that we bring to our everything
we do is the fact that we act in
the collective.
We already come from acting in
the collective and from a
community. That's a cultural
tradition.
So
We don't want to lose sight.
Uh, of
Encouraging our children, our
Hispanic population, all our
indigenous populations from
continuing that collective.
Uh, community sense.
And world views that they bring,
because that's what we're
losing.
In the educational system by
focusing on the individual.
Verses 2, verses.
The community and collective
enrichment that they give and
that they're gonna give back to
their communities when they
finish their academic
preparation. Thank you, Mr.
Chair and thank you,
Representative.
Thank you, Representative Baca.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you uh for bringing this
forward.
My questions are going to start
around the, the makeup of the
council.
Currently as it stands, so Mr.
Chairman.
Representatives
What, what is the current makeup
of the council if you're able to
answer that.
And how are these, uh, this
council selected or who will
participate.
So the council is made up of 23
members that are appointed by
the Secretary of Education.
The statute is pretty um clear
about the makeup, it's business
members, a parent, people from
higher ed, people from public
ed, Currently, we have 19 active
members on the council.
Um, we have a few open seats
that were actively filling.
And the statute requires a
council to meet twice a year.
And thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you for that. It's
important with the, with the
makeup of the council that it
be.
As far as across the spectrum.
And I think that's the important
part of this we understand this,
as I said before, if you look at
the roles of
The 1690s and the 1700s, my
family's name is on there, OK?
We were here.
So I think that we have to be.
Very cognizant of that to make
sure that we have.
of, of a variety of rules.
No one's ever asked me, but I'll
tell you.
Uh, my great grandfather was
also Apache.
And my grandfather, cause you're
like, how do you get a 65
Hispanic? Well, my grandfather's
German, so that's how you get a
65 Hispanic.
But, Mr. Chairman, you know, the
thing about this is
It is important that we
understand that.
Even for those families that
have been in New Mexico.
For hundreds of years.
Their culture and their identity
and their customs.
Are also uniquely unique, so as
we
As we take a look at this, as we
talk about these types of
things, we also have to
recognize that the um
The traditions, the cultures in
there.
Um
In like the Rio Grande Valley
and the Rio Grande Corridor are
different than they are in the
North.
And then down there in Duanna
County in the south, so Mister
Chairman, um,
I had to say that because this,
this is important, but I also
Have to recognize is that
Just because you have a surname
of, you know, of Hispanic.
Doesn't mean that we
All have the same types of
things that we cling to, so I
have to say that.
Mr. Chairman and a
representative.
What is the current
dollar amount of this fund.
Thank you, Mr. Sherman. Um,
representative, so our budget
ask for the last um
fiscal year and this fiscal year
has been um $500,000 which is
what historically, at least on
the last 3 years have been
requested and most of the time,
um, being funded at that has
been, um, traditionally what,
what has been requested from the
public education department to
support the programming that the
Hispanic education at does.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you in regarding the
funds, so
In my, you know, again, the fact
that Mr. Chairman, we're talking
about
And the reason I brought that up
and asked about the fund for the
The per diem and for the
mileage. So that's, do we, is
there any money in that fund
now, Mr. Chairman and
representatives.
To support these types of
activities or would this have to
be a new appropriation.
Um, so that we can provide for
per diem and mileage.
Thank you, Representative. Uh,
thank you, Mr. Chairman
Representative, we would
definitely need to be able to,
um,
Have an increase on that
request, um, reason being is
because as it has been a stated,
um, the council has not been um
receiving any type of funding
for their services or per diem,
so that hasn't been part of the
expenses that the current
appropriation supports.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When
was the last time and the reason
I'm asking obviously is from an
appropriation standpoint, you
guys know that many of us, my
colleagues here also said on
appropriation. So, Mr. Chairman,
when was the last time that fund
was, was, was funded or uh
received an appropriation.
Baca, thank you. uh, this last
fiscal year we received 500.
Mr. Chairman,
and I'm sorry,
no, we're good.
I just have to understand it,
so.
Mr. Chairman, so of this fund,
is it revert back every year? Is
it, does it revert back to the
general fund? What happens to
these funds?
What have these funds been
dispersed on if we've had
$500,000.
And we haven't received per diem
and we haven't received mileage.
Then what are some of the
expenses or the draw from this
fund.
So the the fundingation bureau
at the department does. We do
mini grants out to the schools
for them to do any kind of
programming, um, that's arts,
music, um, anything that
bolsters identity and the
history of the students and
their family life, we fund those
types of programs primarily
right now we have mariachi
programs, folklorical programs,
we have drama programs we have
spoken word and poetry programs,
and then we.
have um some like New Mexican
banda, like in ecos, we have a a
panda group that we're a student
group that we're funding.
And then we also do progressive
leadership funding as well
through a curriculum named
Latinos In Action, and then we
partner with the Hispanic
Education, um.
Institute and they also do
progressive leadership
programming with us.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you for that. So you're saying
basically that most of the
monies that you received.
Have gone out to support
programs in our school K-12. So,
Mr. Chairman, there's no other.
funds or other uh monies to
support that.
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative Baca. No, at this
time, no, and also of note is
that because the Hispanic
Education Bureau is so new,
added that appropriation, we
also cover, uh,
salaries and benefits for 2.
That's kind of what I, that's
kind of, um, I, I think that
this is important. I'm gonna put
a selfish and shameless plug for
creating a mariachi group in the
Lawson School District. So uh
I'm gonna do also I love uh folk
dances and flamenco, so, um, Mr.
Chairman, those are my
questions. Thank you.
Thank you, Representative Gary,
thanks for bringing this forward
and updating it.
Um
Couple of comments, it's, it's
in looking in and thank you
Representative uh Moral Moya for
talking about protecting and
preserving and culture.
Is
We have, you know, I looked up
the statistics, 150 million
Americans speak Spanish.
41 million speak it as their
first language, 13% of Americans
speak Spanish, and we know.
We have lots of Spanish speakers
as an ESL teacher.
I had Mex students from Mexico,
but I had students from many
South American countries in
Central American countries.
So
Spanish, as you know, um, I grew
up in California and we never
learned vosotros the plural
because it seemed like nobody in
America uses it, then I went to
Colombia, Colombia on a
conference and they were using
it. So how do we, um, is this a
topic that you're addressing is
one time APS adopted Puerto
Rican Spanish curriculum.
And it even with my not fluent
Spanish, I thought, huh? So are
you dealing with this in the
advisory.
And I don't need
Thank you.
Yes, so there's partnerships
internally within the department
with the language and culture
division around specifically
heritage Spanish, along with
like world languages Spanish,
which are two different things,
um.
Due to an article that came out
in the New York Times around the
loss of New Mexican specific
Northern heritage Spanish, we're
doing a bunch of work in
partnership with different
external partners around there,
so yes, it's a huge conversation
that advisory council is part of
it, um, we've got a work group
doing, um, a harvest of
instructional materials that are
specific to New Mexico right
now, so yes, the answer is yes.
Thank you and and I appreciate
the gentleman who brought up the
fact that his heritage was
native, representative Baca
because the fascinating father
Bill Sanchez brought up the
issue of how many Jewish.
Uh, ancestors people have, which
is another dimension of.
Our history
Um, my only other question is on
page what I brought up when I
did the wrong bill.
On page 3 lines 16 and 17, the
council shall meet as necessary,
but at least twice each year at
the biennial his Hispanic
education summit, sorry, I'm an
English teacher.
Um, they don't meet twice each
year at once so it's.
Uh
Got it. OK, that's it. Thank
you.
Represented Latta.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, uh, Representatives for
bringing this forward. Um,
Spanish was my first language.
I am
Thanks to the support of my
family and my dad in particular
and my school teachers in my
early years.
I was able to, you know, uh,
adapt to both languages.
Uh
I had to teach myself how to
read Spanish.
Um
I have of course a couple of
questions, Mr. Chair. So,
Um
The
The group
Advisory group.
It consists of 20 some odd
members.
They meet on a regular basis. I
went to the last one they had in
Las Cruces. I was there.
So, in a nutshell,
Um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, what, what, what
does the group do? What is the
goal of the group?
Mr. Chair and Representative
Lara so the sole purpose of the
group statutorily is genuinely
and then to partner with, with
their primary purpose is to do
events like the one that you
attended in Las Cruces to
harvest community.
Engagement and voice around
Hispanic education and the needs
of our students and families,
and then bring that back to the
secretary annually in terms of a
formal advisement around what
they think the department should
be doing for students and
families.
Thank you for that. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Uh, I'm glad you said
that. So now, what does the
secretary do with those uh
recommendations? What have, what
have we seen implemented from,
from that.
So since 2010, 11.
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Representative Lada,
since 2011, the um advisory has
advised different secretaries
have.
absorbed different
recommendations and giving them
legs and operationalized them. I
think one of the biggest ones
for the advisory is the creation
of a family, um, engagement
liaison within the department,
the community engagement office
that used to exist in the
department was part of an
advisement from the HEAC, um,
this work of the language, the
heritage language work is the
previous advisement from last
year that now grew legs and it's
actually manifests itself as a
work group that's doing the
research, so those are just a
couple of.
examples, but theoretically the
secretary takes what the he says
and builds it into the strategic
plan and makes it part of the
daily work of the agency.
Depending on the secretary,
depending on the advisement.
Thank you for that. Thank you,
Mr. Chair, and, and, and uh
presenter, you know, this is uh
Uh, you had mentioned something
earlier when Representative
Garrett had asked and you had
mentioned curriculum.
And so I, I worked with
instructional materials. That's
what I do.
Um
Couple of years ago, was it a
couple of years ago we had a
history and social studies.
Um
Not one publisher, Mister Chair,
submitted any new.
Instructional materials for New
Mexico history.
Our students are still using
textbooks from 2016.
Um
We are some of our more
resourceful teachers, Mr. Chair,
have found uh additional
supplemental materials online
and we've ordered those for
them.
But one of the things that did
come up.
And I think I, I would, I
wouldn't, you know, it's
something that we chuckle about
back home is Mr. Chair, is the,
the relevance of, of, of that.
And how our kids in Donana
County and in Gadsden relate to
The history of New Mexico.
And, and, and for the uh from
what I've been told, Mr. Chair,
and for my conversation with
teachers and and with others is
that they don't.
Um, many of our students, Mr.
Chair, are recent immigrants who
have just come over and, and
they don't relate with that.
However
That does, that's not a bad
thing, because they still are
exposed to other things that uh
other people have been
experiencing for a long time.
And how they, how they, the
How, uh
The old establishment as Mister
uh uh our representative had
mentioned his family he's been
here since the 1700s.
That, that's very relevant and
that is important to know.
But our students
Mr. Chair, our most, our more
recent immigrant or newcomers,
you know, they, they kind of
struggle to understand that. Uh,
it was mentioned, Mr. Chair,
about the language for sale and,
you know, um.
The, the
The lady who I rent from what
I'm here in Santa Fe who's
become a friend who's from
Argentina.
And I had told her, you know, in
our conversation, I told you
know mosey to tell.
And she goes, that's fine. Well,
we'll talk that way.
And so in it but there's there's
a small differences.
In the language itself and in
the words that we use and how
and how we express things, but
the basic idea is still the
same. We understand each other.
So, Mr. Chair, uh,
is um representative is working
is the group is a working group
considering.
Working on
Not just curriculums, but
getting uh but instructional
materials that you can get out
there.
to the schools
Or kids to utilize. Is that is
so critical. I know ISU has done
a little bit of that, uh, and
they have some, they have some
online curriculum that they
offer. However, Mister Chair,
you know, I don't have
Engage. I don't have Savas. I
don't have these big publishers
picking those up.
And if they don't pick those up,
then our students aren't exposed
to these.
So I'm wondering if Mr. Chair,
if the committee is working
actively with the structural
Materials Bureau and make sure
that those materials are
accessible to our students.
Mr. Chair, thank you,
Representative Lara. Yes, that's
part of the current work, um,
I'd love to invite you beginning
so that you can say exactly what
you just said, um, they've just
convened, they've had two
meetings this.
Fiscal year around this work and
the goal is to make
recommendations for our
students. So if I'd love to
invite you to come and speak.
Thank you for that. I appreciate
that. Thank you, Mr. Chaves. You
know, it just doesn't also, it
doesn't only apply to to the
history, but to all the
subjects.
And you know, we have, there is
that requirement to make that
that the materials are uh
culturally and linguistically
relevant.
And uh just translating it to
Spanish does not make it
culturally and linguistically
relevant. It doesn't. So I would
really appreciate, Mr. Chair,
if, uh, you know, if the, uh, I,
I appreciate the invitation. I
do not, and I would really like
to, you know, participate in
that and see what's coming of
that because that is so critical
for our kids, for them to be.
Uh
Included in the curriculum, not,
not, not just in the curriculum,
but in the materials themselves
where they can see.
The faces and the language and
the people reflected in the
materials that they have.
Thank you, Mr.
Chair and Representative, if I
can jump in on that, um.
This is a, this was a major
point with the Martinez lawsuit
and the um witness that we had
come in was Christine Slater,
and she had created a statewide
report addressing the very
question that you're discussing
here. And I think you might be
interested in seeing that. I can
send that to you and I'm, I'm
really so proud of this council
and this current office and
bureau and liaison for doing the
work that they are doing in
reaching out without the funding
that they need and um.
I, I do see that with additional
funding, you know, more could be
done, but certainly this needs
to continue when we discuss the
Martinez and Yazi lawsuits
around um
With the LESC around materials
and curriculum. Thank you for
bringing that up. Thank you Mr.
Chair, I'm sorry, I apologize,
one more thing and I'm glad you
said that because there's so
much more important than just
checking that box of a CR.
It's much more important than
that. OK. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Um
So I do want to thank you all
for the work that you're doing
and, and especially the nuance
because as we've heard in in
committee today that there are
so many versions of Spanish.
dialects, words, my dad grew up
in northern New Mexico and
Chimayo, uh, my mom's from Los
Padilla in the South Valley of
Albuquerque and family's been
there and same lot of land for
hundreds of years now.
And that's one thing that they
used to argue about was words
for different things around the
house, um, and that's just in
New Mexico and then
representative lot is bringing
up the difference with with
students in, in the southern
part of our state, um, and, and
I think being able to
acknowledge and recognize the
the historical tradition and the
linguistic differences within
the New Mexico, but also
expanding it to um what our
student population looks like
and what global Spanish.
is because um for a lot of these
students, hopefully they are
able to be put into the position
of being able to utilize and be
knowledgeable of, of all
different versions. So, um, it's
very complex, um, and I
appreciate that you all are,
are, are attentive to that
nuance, um.
I didn't want to say though, as
far as the grants that go out to
some of these programs in the
Hispanic Education Act,
especially since um we've talked
about funding is that that's one
thing that I think this
complements the work we just did
onentrola's memorial really well
is that we are able to start
looking into what that funding
look like to make
recommendations is putting money
into the Hispanic Education Act,
the appropriate place. Do we
need to move some of these
programs up the line, below the
line.
um and where to put them so that
we are able to not just provide
um um grants that are there for
one academic year for students
and um that there are districts
that are uncertain if they're
going to be able to have it the
next year. how are we going to
fund it for the following year,
but that they're um good
sustainable programs for our
students because like
representative Baca said, um,
our Mariachi program is
something at a Trisco Heritage
that we're very proud of and we
will make sure that other
schools.
wish to have a program like it,
they may, they wish to go a
different route. They may also
do that, um, so thank you for
that work. Um.
With that being said,
Representative Robo Caballero.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move uh
to pass on House Bill 47.
Alright, so we have a new pass
motion on House Bill 487 Caviero
Coolla.
Any opposition to the due pass
motion, none.
do pass House Bill 487.
Congratulations. All right.
Oh, no, please, outward
expressions of sport or
dissension.
All right, so, we're going to
transition to represent pedigre
if you want to come get set up,
but we do have some students, I
understand from Santa Fe High
School. Joining us. Is that
true?
OK.
If we could have you all, we're
gonna have a microphone.
If you all would stand up and
tell us what grade you're in.
So name and what grade you're
in, please.
Uh 00. Well, that's beyond my
control, but please, welcome.
Hello, um, I'm Madeline Banner,

All right. I think that
everybody welcome to house
education, folks.
Alright, so represent Pettigrew,
please House Memorial 32.
Good morning, chair and
committee members to today, I
think is officially my first
time in front of this committee.
So, uh, I'm not an educator,
chairman.
And uh I didn't stay at a
Holiday Inn last night, so I'm
not sure how good I am with
this, but I am a solutions based
person.
And over the last year.
Through the different schools
that I've gone to.
And I'm talking K through 12.
And then teachers.
One of the things that I hear
from
Talking to the teachers is
The
Decision making that they have
to go through with respect to.
Micro credentials versus going
straight for a master chairing
committee, as you may be aware,
several schools out there offer
the opportunity to
Motivate
The teachers to go straight into
their masters.
Some of those may not have the
school based.
Capability to take that teacher
where they want to go.
And so you take a um
A teacher that focuses on gifted
children and they want to go to
a very specific district based
off of
What those issues are within
that district.
Or they may just want to go to
the area because it's a
beautiful place to live, and uh
so they don't get that same
opportunity.
So, chairman, with that.
We put together house memorial
32 to ask our PED and our higher
education groups
institutions to come up with a
way
To
Give college credit hours
towards a master's degree for
their micro credentials.
Mr. Chairman and committee
sitting next to me is Mr. Stan
Rounds. He is the executive
director for Mel and to say
whatever he wants an opening
comments and with that.
You guys can just take it on
whatever questions you have.
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, good morning.
This is not a new issue. I've
been in education since 1973.
This is the 4th iteration of
essentially the same question.
As teachers move through their
early teaching.
And the end their next levels of
licensure.
What does that conform to?
And we've we've had several
models.
And what we always find is a
collision between the higher
education pressure for masters
or I'll call it
post-baccalaureate study.
And others study that may be
directed at their readiness as a
teacher.
So under this iteration we now
have microcredential.
Microcredentialing sort of
wedges itself among both of
those what isn't happening,
which hasn't happened, well it
has periodically as we've gone
through this journey.
It hasn't included the higher
education institutions
recognizing that other training
that is happening as a
superintendent of schools for 27
years.
I paid for a lot of education
for my staff.
And the key element was always
how do we ready them to be the
best teacher for the student
every day.
And that isn't always in
confirmation to a post
baccalaureate course of study.
This is the pressure that I
always brought on universities
and colleges was if we do these
kinds of training as a district,
bringing outside experts and do
it, how can we then count that
toward degree granting that
occurs. It's only logical to do
that.
Well, this is that question
again in today's Vogue.
So the question really is how
does microcredentialing work
interrelated to uh post
baccalaureate studies on the
part of teachers right now
they're this asks for this to be
studied by the public education
department who is the licener
folks, did you know that higher
ed used to be the licener.
They recommended licensure to
the state and if they didn't,
you couldn't get it.
That was removed years ago 20
some odd years ago.
And so as we move through these
thresholds, we ask you to have
this or through this memorial
have a discussion between the
public education department who
is the licensing side who has
determined that
microcredentialing should be
part of this through their
regulatory process.
And the colleges and
universities that are doing the
granting of of degree programs.
And then Mr. Chairman,
E
Whatever their study becomes
comes to and is reported to you,
this body, the body of LESC,
which is your interim committee
with what their findings are so
then you can determine what are
the proper statutory
Changes
Or modifications that might be
made. Mr. Chairman, in a
nutshell, that's this particular
bill. Thank you.
All right, Mr. Chairman,
committee, we stand for
questions.
Great
Thank you all. So we'll go to
our audience and folks on Zoom,
if you're here in support of
House Memorial 32. Please
indicate by raising your hand.
Folks in our audience, if you're
here in support of House
Memorial 32. Could you please
indicate by raising your hand.
Alright, we'll go to opposition
is there opposition on our Zoom
for House Memorial 32.
Folks in the room is their
opposition to House Memorial 32.
Committee members. Questions
represent BACA.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you, uh, Representative
Pettigrew for bringing this
forward. uh, Mr. Chairman and
Representative Pet, this is kind
of out of the box thinking.
And this is really about how
what it kind of brings us to
question about his teacher
advancement in and how do we,
how do we not only prepare that,
Uh, Mr. Chairman and uh
Representative Pettigrew, we
have talked about
The importance of professional
development. We've talked about
trainings that that teachers
have.
Taken upon themselves so that
they better.
are prepared to serve our kids.
And so, um
Mr. Chairman Representative, and
your witness there, uh, Stan.
When we talk about receiving
credit. Is there a limit to the
number of credits that could be
earned.
Through microcredentialing.
Mr. Chairman, usually in.
The collegiate or university
designed the short answer is
yes.
Often these are granted on one
hour basis, those kinds of
things, and it's, it is placed
into the program of study for
the individual in the master's
program, and I'll just make one
note your LESC, uh, analysis on
page 5 says in this regard, the
this the field would benefit
from studies of microc
credential design implementation
and impacts including how micro
credentials influence teachers,
instructional practice and
Student learning. I think that's
Mr. Chairman Representative Bo
is sort of to the basis of your
question. So it's how do you
meet the the convention of
higher education.
Degree plans.
Versus what needs to happen in
the classroom, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you Mr. Chairman and uh
Representative Pettigrew and
Stan Rose. I mean, when we
talked about it, we talked
about.
In in some terms, micro
micro credentialing leading to
as far as having a teacher
receive endorsement or being
highly qualified in an area.
And, and Mr. Chairman, and what
I like about this is it's
basically saying that through
these other trainings,
They may not be college courses,
but they still help to prepare a
teacher to be very effective.
And Mr. Chairman and
Representative, anyone that's in
here, these students that are
here.
Your best teacher in school may
not have been your person who
had the most degrees on the
wall.
But Mr. Chairman, your, your
best teacher, if you look back
to your favorite for any of us
up here, our, our most
influential elementary school
teacher was some a teacher that
was able to connect with us.
And was able to actually.
Find out what motivates us, so,
um,
I, I think Mr. Chairman, like
this bill.
And again, I like the fact that
we study it. I like the fact
that we take a look about how
that impact. So Mr. Chairman,
like,
Um, when we talked about
Like when I had my master's
programs, I was able to transfer
in 12 hours.
That were
Whether it be independent study
before I was in that program.
This, I think gives us that
opportunity as we have sat here
on this committee and through
the LESC and said that
professional development and
training is important, so Mister
Chairman represented Pettigrew,
I appreciate you're out of the
box uh thinking and your
co-sponsor, and I support this
uh.
Mr. Chairman, with permission,
I'd like to add to that. Um,
Inside the the stud inside the
analysis.
One of the, one of the great
things on page 2.
There's the micro credential
courses were developed by PED
and collaboration with a group
of different.
Sinners, but on top of that, New
Mexico State University,
University Community College.
So these micro credentials.
That were put together that
focus on classroom environment.
Assessment li literacy,
multi-layered systems of
support, culturally and
linguistically responsive
instruction in family
engagement.
Were put together.
My PED and higher education.
Surely there's a way to bridge
that gap.
To help
Do this. It was, this was a
collaborative effort when this
came together.
Oh, I'm looking at it saying,
OK, they're surely, surely we
can come up with a way to bridge
this and.
Accomplish two things. Thank
you.
It was me.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative and Mr. Rounds,
um, I, I really like this, um, I
very happily say that in
December, I finished my last
micro credential, and I will
never have to take another one
again. Um, so because I am now,
um, well, I'm officially not
level 3 until next year, but
yeah, uh, but yeah, so I'm, I'm
finally there, but, but these,
these are no joke. They're not
just just showing up for a day
and or or reading some material,
um, and, and
But people don't realize is
that.
You have a brand new teacher.
That is just figuring out the
world of teaching, which is a
huge lift on itself.
And then
You have
Microcredentials that you must
take within a certain time limit
because you're level one license
is not renewable.
OK, so you have you, uh, and,
and believe me, it took me
longer because I could not, uh,
I had 4 that I had to take and
um.
I couldn't do it during the
session. I tried once and yeah
never opened it, just wasn't
gonna happen. So I knew that
when I'm here.
That's not gonna happen. So it
took me longer than most, uh,
because I have a lot of other.
Uh, plates to spin in my world,
not only teaching, so, um, but
that, that's the thing is that
they have to do that and we also
have letters training in New
Mexico, so brand new teachers
have to be trained in letters,
so, so all, all of these things
that they have to juggle while
trying to figure this all out
while trying to be the best that
they can be and holding their
own sanity.
Believe me, um, it's, it's been
11 years, but I still remember
it, um, and so, um, but, but
those are the kind of things
that this is, it's not just, um,
like you said, it's developed
along with higher ed, um, I have
went through several of these,
one of them being the New Mexico
Education Acts, uh, mentoring, I
think uh a student engagement
and cult and and linguistic
materials, um, so those, they
are.
They, they taught me a lot about
um um different things that I
can use immediately in the
classroom. I have to tell you it
did give me a lot of um
immediate information that I
could use, so it wasn't just
I've sat through a lot of
professional development.
And, and I'm like,
Why am I here?
I'm gonna be honest with you,
and I can guarantee you 90% of
teachers do the same thing.
They're like,
And there's some of them that
I'm like I can probably.
Teach this better than the
person that is that is that is
uh, you know, I, I probably know
more than the presenter. Those
kind of things that what I
learned in those micro
credentials was valuable, and I,
and, and I can only speak for
me. I know other people may have
issues or whatever.
So being able to, I think for
especially for those level one
going to a level 2.
Oh, me, I already had my
master's. I got that done and
out of the way and swear it
almost killed me but uh but uh
uh but that was um, um, you
know, I didn't need that, but,
but those that don't have that
yet, it's invaluable and, and,
and I think I, I'm, I'm very
glad that we're gonna be
studying this because they're
there has to be a way, even if
it's just as um as um elective
credits.
You know, even if it's it's
something that that is going to
be able to um help these these
student these teachers because
those that are then all of this
and trying to get their masters
too.
Um, is, is, uh,
It's it's huge and it's
overwhelming and, and
unfortunately, I, I personally
believe that that's one of the
major reasons that that uh that
weight that we put on brand new
teachers and all of the things
that we throw on them constantly
expects them to do that, do it
proficiently is why we lose many
of them in the 1st 3 years.
Many of them.
So thank you, thank you so much
for bringing this.
Thank you, Mr. Cha. Uh thank you
representative for bringing this
to us, uh, we have a
presentation on microcredentials
in the Inner committee, and we
have this conversation. I think
it's very important and
hopefully you will be part of
the conversation when um I think
PD is working with you. um, to
make sure that um teachers are
included and that's something
that I start thinking when Rep
Miramal Moya.
Cheering
I did experience of the teacher
is very important to hear we
were talking um about how
overwhelmed our teachers are
with everything with this with
letters with all the trainings
and everything, so how can we
incorporate everything and make
it a successful. So I think the
voice of the teachers should be
there. And I just wanted to make
sure that I say it and I share
it, um, when you are part of
this conversation, please
include the teachers in this
input. Thank you.
German and and representative
um.
are the reason why I brought
this.
And this wasn't my idea. I
didn't, and, and actually I I
guess in a way that the memorial
piece was I wanted to run
legislation and what I realized.
Chairman and, and representative
is, I don't know enough about
this.
What I do know is that our
teachers as has been described.
Um, are very overwhelmed when
they first come in.
And with everything else that
they have to do. And then add
the fact that that um
Male or female.
You had family to that.
You have all the other parts and
pieces, the moving parts and
just life.
Some way to
bridge that gap.
That
PED says this is important. We
need to do micro. We talked
about and we talk about the
master's degree and how you
continue to grow and, and your
ability to educate in your
strengths, understanding your
strengths and gaining new
strengths.
My opinion, chairman and, and
representatives, this gives you
the best of both worlds. You,
you, you bring the teachers.
The teacher brought the problem.
Now we have public
that can come together that can
give you some information to
LESC and then let you guys.
That are are leading this
charge.
Potential solutions on how to
come up with the best way to
accomplish this for our teachers
and for education in the state
of New Mexico and with that
said, yes, we do have people uh
schools across the country
states across the country that
are doing some version of this.
But once again, this gives New
Mexico the ability to I look
forward to hope for, for you
guys supporting this and having
this further represent.
Thanks, Mr. Chair. Thanks,
Representative. Um, I would just
add, adding, um, letters.
Uh, which isn't a micro.
Prudential course but which.
Probably involves more college.
Graduate work than most of the
micro credentials.
So, um,
And then your second issue is,
will they actually do the study?
Chairman, that's why the
reporting back to this uh to
your interim committee.
because there are things like
letters that probably has to be
partial process, you are divine
what that needs to look like in
statute. Thank you, Mr.
And I would just add Mr. Chair
and Representative.
It's important that they're not
just.
I cave.
Chairman committee, I'm happy to
send you copies of.
We, we, we, we believe you,
especially as a teacher,
um.
All right, I represent.
Well,
um, um.
I, I had heard about this
briefly, read it very quickly,
and as I'm looking at it, I have
a few questions.
Um
What I understood this to be was
that you were going to look at
uh conducting some kind of
research.
Survey study on how the microc
credentialing was going as a as
a whole.
Um
And so I can see here that it's
a lot more than that.
Um
And so
I have some questions about the
lot more than that, but I'm also
curious, before we start on
that,
Um, I'm wondering, um,
If you can tell me, because you,
you are in the.
Legislative education, the LES
that you referred to, um,
working with numerous
institutions, and I'm wondering
who you worked with at the
University of New Mexico.
Chairman and representative, I
didn't work with anybody with
respect to this when I
referenced, uh, University of
New Mexico and New Mexico State.
I referenced the second to the
last paragraph on page 2 that
says micro credentials were.
Courses were developed by PED
and higher ed.
This came together through a
collaborative effort.
Um,
that's if I can add this
memorial.
Well, let's back up micro
credentialing.
It's what's being represented on
that page to discussion. How did
we get to the current practice
including some New Mexican
design and determination of that
is, so what we're doing is
asking to go back and reststudy
that.
To discover the who.
The why and the how all three of
those that need to happen as we
look at how then that interfaces
with the other candidates that
they need to get in. What does
that provide as a package, if
you will.
To them as they're moving
through that stream, uh, I'll
remind the committee that that
uh.
Teachers who received their a
level one license.
That has a termination in it has
a 5 year life that's all it has.
And by then they have to pass
through these these passageways
to to move to a level to
teacher.
And in that this is part of the
requirement of credentialing for
micro credentials, but there's
also the requirement for
attainment of a master's degree
if you want to continue moving
along that stream. It's not by
level 2 necessarily, but it's in
that stream of study they're
having to go through, so we're
not divining anything asking for
a study of that process.
So, so just to clarify, let me
see if I get it right.
You are, um, you are looking for
a study, you're looking to
create a study.
Of the process of going from
level 2 to level 3.
The options involved and how
this might be one of become one
of those options, is that?
It's, it's, it's a little wider
than that, Mr. Chairman
Representative, Mr. Chairman,
sorry, I didn't I don't think I
referred to you there, Mr. So
what this is is looking at the
current system of
microcredentialing.
That is in place and is
operating.
And asked that this the public
education department who from a
regulation standpoint, put that
into
Into being.
They did it through study with
universities and others that are
listed here. We're asking now
that it's underway to then look
at that practice and then I add
one piece to it and that is what
does that do to the teacher
passing through.
With the other requirements of
credentiality that they have
required, including an eventual
attainment of a master's degree
as you move up level 1 to 2,
level 2 to 3. We're just trying
to look at what is the
conjunction of that what, what
should that be? And then for
them to provide input to you
essentially through your interim
committee as what they find and
what they might recommend to
that thesis to that question.
Mr. Chair Mr. Chair, um.
And um
Doctor Browns, are we looking at
them, um.
Are we looking then, uh, again,
just to be clear as micro
credentials as an option for
passage to level 3. Is that what
this study is or are we looking
at?
Studying
How it has been going with.
The teachers who have been
taking micro credential classes
because.
Um, all, all of the teachers I
was working with were taking
microprudential microprudential
classes, and there was a a wide
range of.
Um, benefit and questions and
Some of the things that came up
in in this report.
Mr. Chairman, this is an awkward
answer because it's really both.
We're looking at both facets,
uh, and, and the lens that we're
suggesting is the lens of the
person passing through the
system because at the end of the
day the systems issues are the
issues that may stymie as an
example, I think, Mr. Chairman
is representative Paul Moya has
indicated earlier we lose about
60% of our teachers in the 1st 5
years that are, that are new
teachers.
Could this be part of the
impediment in that? Is there a
way to meld together the, the,
uh
The master's degree programs as
an example at our at our
colleges and universities with
my credentialing so that one can
feed the other and ease that
path and coordinate.
All the parts you're trying to,
Mr. Chairman Representative.
Um, Mr. Chair, I have a couple
more questions if it's OK.
We are OK.
Um
As Mr. Chair, um, and, um,
sponsors. Um, are you
considering in any way looking
at incorporating some kind of
comprehensive study of the types
of professional development that
need to happen in New Mexico on
a like on a yearly basis, um, or
at all, um, what is needed and,
and looking at the.
Evaluating what was delivered.
So Mr. Chairman, I that may be
an outcome of the study. We're
not presupposing what they will
find, um, being a
52 year licensed New Mexico
educator. I would hope that they
that they dig into those kinds
of substantial questions. So I
would hope the answer would be
yes. We're not prescribing that
in this study, but I would hope
that knowing the play.
And Mr. Chair, um,
I, I did ask the question
before, but I'd like to repeat
it just.
Because I want to know, um, do
we?
to do.
Do we know anyone at the
University of New Mexico who was
involved in actually developing
the courses um.
That were provided as my courses
at the University of Mexico. I
wasn't invited into that
discussion, I believe that
Doctor Glenn Warren were the
ones that precipitated that
discussion. I wouldn't want to
hazard.
And one last question, um, Mr.
Chair. Um,
You know, we've got a couple of.
Curriculum packages that are
coming up.
Um, from the Senate, one in
science of reading and one in
mathematics, you foresee that
these might be taught through
microcredentialing classes.
Mr. Chairman, Representative
Torres Velazquez, that's a great
question, um.
I think in the scope of.
Best likely best practice.
As you move through time.
It wouldn't be, be, it would be
perfectly appropriate to make
that part of a micro
credentially.
Smorgasbord a key element, Mr.
Chairman Representative that's
under discussion now is should
higher education be required.
In their scope of teacher
training to include trainings
that are required in the field.
And that really, Mr. Chairman is
the the root of this question in
micro Mirabal Moya indicated,
Mr. Chairman, I heard several
things that were learned that
are those I would expect that
the sites of
Might be a logical parsing out,
Mr. Chair.
of Garcia.
Yeah
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Chair
Representative.
Uh, I appreciate that there's
gonna be a study done to help
our teachers that uh to get to
the next level.
And
It would be at their pace and at
the time that they really need
it.
Sometimes it takes longer.
I come from a very rural area in
western New Mexico.
And uh
My question would be, knowing
that, uh.
We have schools there that are
federally funded.
The
That operates um there.
And then we have our schools
that have been contracted.
A contract for federal programs.
And uh they run there.
Uh, well, the, uh, these schools
also be part of the study.
Uh, so that we would know.
Uh, what their needs are because
they're in a very rural area and
having to uh
Go to the next level, they have
to take certain.
I remember one of our teachers
to go.
All the way to Albuquerque just
to attend classes in this a
two-hour drive one way.
And then having to go back again
and
It was
And uh
How, how would that
With the study, uh.
So Mr. Chairman, just as a
sidebar in the last 40 years
that has been part of a question
I've asked from a policy
standpoint in this state for us
to serve all of our students, we
need to figure out how do we
integrate all of our educational
systems.
What I've found is, and I think
in answering Mr. Chairman, your
question, Representative Garcia,
uh, we don't have jurisdiction
from the state of New Mexico on
BIE schools as an example.
So while it would be available
to them.
And people might be licensed in
that my understanding of BIE
requirements doesn't necessarily
require a new Mexico license to
teach in a facility on New
Mexico geography uh grounds and
and so my hope would be, Mr.
Chairman, that we could shrink
the mileage for everybody.
And provide the substance for
everybody.
That allows our practice to be
uniform across that I reflect,
Mr. Chairman, final point on uh
Magdalena and Navajo Prep, uh,
who are contiguous educational
facilities, and I know in my
years of watching students work
back and forth between those,
the desonance that happen.
Uh,
focus and standard training Mr.
Chairman, my hope would be the
answer would be yes, but Mr.
Chairman, um, I'm not sure.
How far your authority could be
exerted that would require.
Rather than
Mr. Chair Representative, uh.
The school that I have been.
and I don't know how many other
schools.
Chairman, I apologize because
obviously I don't know
everything. Mr. Chairman, I, I
acquiesced to that and, and so
in that respect for them to
receive the licensure in New
Mexico. The short answer is yes,
it would apply to that being
your policy, Mr. Chair.
The zoom gear.
Mr. Chair, I move a due pass for
House Memorial 32 a second
motion on Memorial 32, seconded
by Representative Mido Amoya.
Is there any opposition to the
DuP pass motion?
Right
To do pass House Memorial 3. All
right.
So Senate Bill 19.
Senator Steinborn.
Good morning, ma'am, uh, Mr.
Chairman, committee.
Good to be with you. I have
officially crossed over, which
is great. It's a good sign.
Um
Senate Bill 19, Senate Bill 19,
uh, Mr. Chairman, committee
would provide, would require
that the higher education
department provide 10 hours of
training to newly appointed
university regions. And uh
leaders of governing boards of
community colleges. Right now,
uh, Mr. Chairman, committee, as
we know, a lot of appointed
regions, first of all, they have
very important jobs. They're
running multi $100 million
institutions, they're hiring
presidents, they're setting.
tuition, they're agreeing the
infrastructure and they're
really charting the direction of
that school and what it has to
offer the states,
and with that, the future of our
kids and our state.
So it's important that, well,
number one, that they're
qualified and they're the right
people, but that's another piece
of legislation, Senate Joint
Resolution 7, and I hope also
makes it over to you. But what
this does is it says no matter
who is picked, that we give them
training, that we give them some
training and some fundamental
areas that will help them do a
better job on um the on the
statutory underpinnings of New
Mexico education law.
For higher education that they
understand the resources
available for students' success.
Because I think often these
regions are very siloed in their
community and just in their own
little board. They may not be
aware, there's national
organizations that can help
them. They have colleagues
around the state. So I think
this can help on that. They need
to know about ethics policies
and transparency and Open
Meetings Act and things that
sometimes
They may run afoul from and they
end up doing things behind
closed doors and, you know,
aren't best practices. So it's
important that they know that.
And then, of course, um, good
governance policies and best
practices and fiduciary
management. So this bill defines
what those 10 hours would be.
Um, it would be high quality
standardized, I think in some of
the boards I've spoken to with
community colleges, they like
the across all these different
entities, um, so they're all
kind of working from the same
baseline. And so with that,
Um, happy to stand for
questions, uh, Mr. Chairman. All
right. Thank you. So we'll go to
our audience.
