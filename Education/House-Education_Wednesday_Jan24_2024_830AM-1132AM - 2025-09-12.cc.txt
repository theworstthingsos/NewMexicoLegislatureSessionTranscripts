At the convention center before

I'm here what's happening.
When is the think you mister
scher thank you is very nice to
be in the side of a community
or ten even.
Thank you.
Thank you so
at this thirty nine
working on this
only here and you say here's a
little times i'm awaiting a
teacher and made wealthy chance
so
when I was at school and you
know many of the prep times of
teachers know here we street
most of the time I thought
corporate.
You mean when you're fight no
external compensation.
Because there were no any other
teacher where they will do that
at the same time that I was
doing so that's why these really
important for me it would have
all the resources human
resources needed to fulfil the
needs and that just emergency
findings or students a special
cultural diversity
with this little time when I
into the people who is sitting
with me is
that consponsor on the bill I
also have so sign up johnson who
is a system professor as at a
new mexico university
and there are some experience
also sitting here in the pack
that we we need and we've had
questions we can always refer to
them if it's okay and i'm gonna
ask as the same a doctor says
anybody.
Good morning.
Also
for twenty.
This morning and so i'm.
So i'm gonna start with I think
what is important about this
thirty nine is that we need to
provide opportunity for all new
mexico students participated.
At this point right now
according to the stars.
System for twenty one twenty two
we have forty nine percent of
our students of art of our
district.
Schools on how by lingo
education problem.
Almost half of our schools have
those problems in.
And so when I want to do
coming.
I find a recommendation first of
all
what would I want to share there
was one of their findings that
shop me as a professor at
university level is that at this
time right now we only have
five.
Retain the billing almost.
We must provide recurring
funding to recruit and we.
Are by linguist teachers and
professors so that we can meet
the knees as I said almost half
of our schools have bilingual
educat.
And then the the recommendation
of twenty twenty two also
indicated a recommendation that
includes finally.
Course work in the standard
teacher preparation and that's
great actually mexico state i'll
give an example we are already
doing that think they're gonna
swear doctor and I hold that
developed at and it's been in.
Teacher preparation program to
already have that course work
for all our students this
academic year we have two
hundred.
Program
and we also have twenty four
graduate students are getting
graduated certificate for by.
We are only two and mexico state
again if I can say the numbers
again two hundred and forty
three and twenty two grad so I
think a grad student so I think
you can squeak clearly that the
discrepancy and regards to us.
So programs and so I asked that
with those specific lfc
fighting and recommendation that
there's clearly a need and and
especially if we do.
That how.
Hi quality by lingui.
With culturally responsive.
As students would.
The.
Good morning.
Very happy to.
I've been a strong proponent of
complying.
What we.
Culturally enriched students I
don't bel.
We bring special enrichment to
the classroom and this.
Comprehensive approach to being
able to do.
Are.
The focus of the outcomes in
terms of the azimatinus.
Particular bill is.
This.
And I think the important.
Is that this is just the
beginning we've got to have the
institutions begin to inst.
The funding.
Those in our audience on my
right hand side here if.
Number of people.
Thank you
college college
support legislation I just want
to be
responsive.
Allocation of funds going to
mass state

awesome work together
operating a problem of the
reason that we have established
with as well
we have twenty eight percent off
the funds actually come from the
college it has helping out with
the
college to sort of I teachers so
just want you know if you can
bought the process as the
moves or

part of the system that has not
been adequately resourced and
identified from many many years

the education ecosystem is in
need of this bill to pass them
that we can produce the teachers
in the educators on the health
care professionals that are
citizens in new mexico so deeply

and that we need it correct the
credit inadequate education

english language learners need
of american low income issues

excuse for this upcoming budget
here there are no lack of funds
with the one fall of over three
point six billion dollars new
money
the funds appropriated in this

dropped in the bucket.
And yet are students should
never be a drop in the park.

all you this morning i'm gonna
use my two minutes in the
following way first
once again agents on the world
center for the education study
of double's populations can also
represent the ben hon leadership
and public policy institute that
then on senior under the aspects
in took legion guidance of dean
eric there in the audience like
to begin first with a couple of
comments first that is that it
just reflecting on base funding
typically equates to maintaining
the status quo right and
when I think of house bill
thirty nine it really does
respond to the hall the hotel
the whole student you've heard
testimony this morning of
individuals coming from the
medical sciences right you've
heard individuals speaking from
the lens of chicago studies from
the elements of specifically
billing education and education
in general were really talking
about a systemic approach to
supporting all of our students
and also responding and creating
an infrastructure
that is actually supported
fiscally up for multiple years
right expanding upon that base
funding that exists.
I like to transition really
quickly to a couple of things
specific to the believer being
home leadership and polite
policy institute it's a
fellowship that we offer there
to support
graduate students to have access
to
basically
a masters agree in that
leadership or also the
potentially a master's agreement
business administration or even
social work with an emphasis on
leadership and an emphasis on
supporting typically our
marginalized communities within
the last six years we've
supported thirty two students to
acquire their masters.

school of social work and at new
mexico highlands university with
asked aspirations to change
these numbers i've been
collaborating within mexico
haven't university school of
education dean eric in the
development of an indigenous
knowledge road map and this
roadmap is a community based
collaboration between our two
professional schools to ensure
that more social workers
teachers and educators are the
available to meet the ins of
case through twenty nine mexico
students and this larger view is
hopefully through culturally in
linguistically responsive
education that includes
professional curriculum
development and community
engagement and may I remember
remind the community the
committee and the communities
that the new mexico indian
education act of nineteen
seventy eight had legal
educational and moral
stipulations and these rights
were meant to assure that
students would receive equitable
and culturally relevant learning
and environments opportunities
and instructional materials
forty five years later that
we're still we still have much
work to do and this remains on
the shoulders of all of our
educational systems the which
also includes the social
emotional learning needs of new
mexico students following our
pandemic some institutions have
been doing this work with
limited resources insufficient
person now inadequate curriculum
etcetera all of this information
is not new funding from house
bill thirty nine could advance
the goals of departments
programs.
Thank you.
Good morning mr chair my name is
michael the biggest and I am the
executive director of the
language education on mexico
we're not profit providing
instructional and language
support to new mexico schools
for over twenty two years in
order for us to effectively
prepare our students we have to
make sure that we're also
looking at sufficiently
supporting our insurance as well
as our people service teachers
and administrators from the
beginning with the tools in the
north that they need that we
know makes a difference in every
start with our institutes of
higher education and the types
of supports that house bill
thirty nine is presenting last
year we had the opportunity to
celebrate our states fiftieth
anniversary of our budding of
multicultural education act and
one of the things that many the
constituents around the state
and many of our partners who are
in the room agreed on is the
fact that we have a lot
celebrate we we have a lot more
than we need to do in order to
really effort fill what our
students need and that starts
with bald moves and you know I
really feel that house will
thirty nine is the first of
those bold moves that we really
need to get behind in order to
support the education of our
students in an economy thank
you.
Then whining.
Please good morning good morning
chairman rometo and members of
the committee and the scenario
matter from betty no new mexico
in southern dynamic county and

department of borderlines and
ethnic studies that mess you
within the college of health
education and social
transformation our department is
named in house bill thirty nine

with colleagues across the state
to shape it in a very
collaborative relation away my
colleagues and I hear animals
you have joined with southern
new mexico k twelve teachers and
high school youth from more than
ten districts including gadston
last course this miscollator
silver city carls bad in real
dosso to write units and lessons
that portray histories from
these communities that are not
part of the existing curriculum
we've also developed films games
posters and museum exhibitions
that are culturally sustaining
for categories of classrooms
we're very excited to be in the
first stage of piloting and
researching these materials with
our partners and we've had a
very good success so far
a twenty twenty one study out of
stanfords college of education
is titled ethnic studies
increases longer run academic
engagement and attendant and
they followed ninth graders at
san francisco
unified schools and showed that
those who took at night studies
courses showed significant
increase as an enrollment
attendance total earned credits
gpa persistence in matriculation

we directly support the new
mexico key to implement the us
strand and social study
standards called ethnic in
cultural identities arm to this
end we've delivered professional
development workshops for more
than two hundred social studies
teachers across our state so the
next step is to create a
research programs that provide
empirical data as the next step
to support the implementation of
culturally sustaining and
linguistically sustaining
education for this work to
continue and scaffled it to a
state white ski.
We need to grow and sustain the
faculty staff and research

developed a severe auditory
processing disorder and the
captioning helped support me at
the same way that hearing a help
support the committee
I
support the bill because it
provides collaboration that
provides opportunities that
provides for the recognition of
how we live well even with our

I hear I think.
Good morning
mr chair members of the
committee I hope you can hear
me.
Okay thank you my name is teresa
gomez and I oversee a program
house at the university of new
mexico's division of community
behavioral house in the
department of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences called
honoring native life I am here
to attest to the importance of
funding initiatives related to
mental health and suicide
prevention and tribal
communities are connected to
house bill thirty nine I am from
the public island and have been
involved in behavior of arena
for approximately fifteen years
with the focus on policy and
policy implications for native
americans tribes nations and
quibbles and new mexico during
the past year or program
honoring native life has gained
extensive experience working
with native youth community
members and providers as well as
tribes needs
play blows
and on a nationwide basis and
and I suicide prevention but
unfortunately the issue of
suicide in need of american
communities continues to be a
devastating public health
disparity in our state behavior
or health conditions such as
depression ptsd anxiety and
substance use disorders are
important respected for some
safe these are same conditions
also impact native students so
so an emotional wellness and
their ability to focus on their
education a well documented fact
is that there are limited
numbers of social and behavioral
health providers state wide and
even fewer that provide
culturally appropriate services
the availability of these
services tailored for native
youth drops significantly the
further away the services are
from tribal communities honorary
need of life is actively
addressing desperately by
providing culturally only
appropriate mental.
Thank you all for you.
Is there any
two house bill thirty nine it's
been so
much forgotten to committee
professor is there any
opposition.
Thank you mister chair
A brief inquiry.
The stake holders were that were
involved.
I represent a large part of
someone county.
And the nab.
So can you.
Thank you mister she don't think
you might not deliver lane for
the question they were several
community meetings involving
universities and college but i'm
gonna ask at the experts who
have actually the numbers of how
they were involved.
Yeah.
Is that okay going to pick us
please with a question.
Thank you mister chairman and
members that the committee just
pickles the cofunder and code
director of the leadship
institute based here in santa fe
and and represent lane the court
nation
act.
Communication on site at anti u.
Same effort was.
When we convened in september
close to a hundred faculty and
program directors to
create
the development.
Higher education institutions
submitted their budget request
and realizing none of these were
included in their request about
presidents.
The idea is that in the next
effort of community colleges and
branch colleges like it you and
them gallup.
Will be the next effort after
hopefully the success of.
Yeah.
And i'm i'm glad to hear that I
hope you.
And I just asked the question
because I had go.
The.
That is.
Who have been worried that we
have taken.
Is could universities do this.
And I think I know that the uni.
I started the of the foundation
at northern new mexico college
so I know how much money you can
bring it to a university.
Asking univers.
And you think this is important
and I know you do.
Why can you make.
It is a lot that we give to hire
it I I actually think the bigger
problem
I actually think the bigger
problem is the salary level that
we have.
That that.
Why aren't you doing th.
A couple of questions
I count forty.
The.
And i.
The.
Thank you thank you mister she I
think you're gonna refer to a
question that's something that
um when I ask when I because to
answer.
Thank you mister chairman
representative gear.
I believe that across the entire
spectrum throughout the state
most of these programs have been
in existence so most of them
have governments in
accountability
systems in place the heart of
this effort is really to
increase the base of these
programs so that they're not
operating on in a scalable way
but there is no question or
doubt that across the entire
spectrum for all of these
programs represented in the bill
i'll all have systems in place
for which one whether their
minimal state investments but
the majority are federally
driven so that stringency of it
hereans to the accountability
and the use of these resources
are well established.
The question
house bill to eighty was
passlash year.
And.
That's not part of this
I did get update from higher
education secretary
rodriguez because I they're not
included and I think that is
import.
The.
Um.
She said the higher education
dep.
Completed.
The department and committee are
in the process of scor.
The committee is compri.
I will community members so i'm
just you know there has to be a
interface or.
And so that's a concern that I
w.
Thank you mister chairman
representing it that is deemed
is how we bill the network so
that with the establishment of
the two technical assistant
centers many of the people who
have provided tester money with
the example work that they're
doing.
The hotel in the vision is that
all of that becomes part of the
network so all of the faculty
and subject area experts become
part of that technical
assistance center framework to
support communities at that
level to support teachers in the
classroom to support entire
districts to support local
school boards and create the
kind of connectivity that is so
fundamentally not aligned at
this point so the larger vision
is to create that kind of
network and why funding for all
of these programs are so
compelling to create that kind
of connectivity let me just give
you one classic example that the
leg shared with this committee
what was created in two thousand
and six to address the shortages
of personnel in the health field
using doctors as an example the
b a m d program you for young
people who are in the program
today.
There is a compliment program
called communities to
pathways in careers in health.
That has largely an exclusively
been funded with federal
resources they did not receive
the multi year grant for that
continuation without that
compliment program you really
are minimizing the vision to
fulfil with the bamdey program
because that pool will only
narrow without the complement in
the fact of getting young people
at the mid school level through
high school to realize what it
takes to prepare for feels in
this very challenging area so
it's another example of how soft
dollars are create programs
create momentum but with the
lack of heart dollars invested
requested by higher education
institutions u n in this case
for it to business stained over
time were really are so badly
this connected that the end
result is the input don't match
consistently over time for the
kind of outlets that results in
the glary statistics than facts
with the shortages of nurses and
doctors behaviour help personal
as just one example that is the
example across the entire
spectrum.
The concern for hous.
Some of the institutions of
those people here then my final
thing was pointed out
I have saw it and then I notice
that it was also.
The.
To.
Historic.
Representative.
Thank you thank you mister.
And thank you very much I
appreciate your bringing this
build forward and i.
You have been here long enough
to understand that I fight for.
There is one particular school
that is bit left and that is the
union you both are rosal and the
ridders of branches my
particular area is made up at.
When we're talking about
read those so
that's right there in the
midscale patches back.
Students as well.
But my problem is and here's
where it's going to get real
sticky folks and I I just call
it like I see.
We have to be a.
And I understand that h bill
thirty nine is will increase the
number of billing.
But you're asking for an
appropriation of twenty seven
million five hundred and fifty
two thousand.
Yeah.
That's a big big request that's
a big what that you.
The.
The problem is.
With the volatility of the oil
and gs industry which is
funding.
What is it now forty what
percent of states edu.
It's over forty percent and I
wonder I don't want to give a
wrong number there but that's
where the mon.
Twenty years.
That we have seen those prices
go like this guy rocket.
So the sustainability for this
request I think we're going to.
That's my concern.
It's going to be.
One of those things that really
glared at me.
There is no performance measures
in this
I want to know the results of
and where this money is being
spin whenever we are talking
about all the different avenues
that you want this money to be
spending and that's a big
concert of mine because a lot of
these programs are ready.
Earth is.
So therefore I do have concerns
about that.
Which you know performance
measures in in.
I feel are worth following up to
make sure that that money is b.
In this.
Point that out in any direction
here.
I'm going to get through my note
cause they have paid just turned
in all the analysis of.
One thing that I was very
encouraged to see in one of the
analys.
Sturdies in that the enrollment
has increased thirty six
percent.
It is shows and up tick on.
That mister chairman.
Yeah.
My problem i.
The.
Best education.
Thank you mister schert and good
representative check check the
chat field sorry
that's actually the purposes
that being in the plan of the
university to stay there to
support these programs and then
when I ask let cover up because
just pine on this
thank you miss chairman
representative thank you for
that question.
The intent of this bill.
Is to supplement and increase
the base budgets of the programs
salvage some of those that have
been driven with federal
resources to inject an
investigate resources so that we
addressed the sustainability and
so again the outcomes
are well measured and because
most of these programs are
supplemented with federal
dollars the stringency in
compliance in meeting the
outcomes that represent it is
raised is an appropriate
question and end to your
question as well the intent is
really not to bypass hd in this
case as the statutory entity
responsible for overseeing
higher education institution
program are desired development
and investments but the reality
is that these exist largely in
many cases the result of
legislators.
Responding to faculty
personally addressing the needs
that higher education has really
neglected so if we're going to
one address being among the
highest in the nation for lowest
academic achievement if we're
going to address the
manifestation of poverty that
manifest into the state being
among the highest four hundred
that men are fast in terms of
the the highest rate of hunger
manifested into health
disparities cycle the violent
optimately suicide the
investment of twenty eight
million
multi billion dollar budget is
really drop in the bucket so we
either invest now or pay the
consequences of what has
resulted in the neglect of
appropriately support porting
these programs to create the
kind of human capital capacity
that we don't have if we don't
invest whenever going to have.
The ability the capability.
Of that dressing the education
crisis that in my mind has
largely been created but not
taken responsibility by higher
education institutions by
prioritising these areas that
now results in the kind of
shortages of teachers
educational leaders social
workers behavior hell nurses
counselors and very directly
representative you and I have
had very long discussions with
regard to the needs of roll
communities in new mexico the
way that we're able to address
the kind of shortages that that
exist in your community the
larger region that you you
represent is that some of the
basic quality of life issues for
the youngest members of your
community to their elders.
Everyone in the middle because
there aren't the human capital
capacity that has been invested
so that people are not leaving
communities rating ghost
you and I have talked about how
do we create the work for so
that the communities that you
represent continued to be
viable the vitality of for you
and many of us want to continue
to raise our children and
grandchildren in the beauty of
rolled your mexico so this is
really at the very heart of how
we move to that point so that
young people are not leaving
behind people who who cannot
move creating those towns
throughout the state
and I really appreciate one the
very hard questions that you've
always asked of me and my
response in your openness to
understand as we continue to
work in and developing
strategies for program
development to address some of
the needs that you've expressed
to me that I had pledged to
support your efforts and were
still working on many of these
areas particularly for those two
whom you are so deeply
passionate about and those.
That.
Knowledge of of the subject.
Support the inter.
The.
I I too are some questions and
i'll be very brief and direct
like I always
because these aren't really
trick questions as soon as the
chairman and representative.
For the othe.
Group through who the targeted
groups at this locked suit.
So cater twelve to events who
were and their server
minorities students people sense
of color.
Okay sure.
And I want to I want to kind of
friends that it's kay twelve
students I want to phrase it
like that.
Because that's.
The.
Um.
My other mother question this
may go not necessary to you but
made to our.
Secretary or to or deputy serv.
Seven million dollars anywhere
in the budget they were
presented by ped or by the hir.
Mister chair represented a
bucket can I ask you to clarify
that question for me are you
talking about the agency
requests that that is that it's
exactly because as we
as we consider this budget.
And we are looking.
I just need to know as was this
number.
Figured into both the segment.
Or the request.
These groups
mr chair representative thanks
for the clarification so a lsc
doesn't have a doesn't have
preview over higher education
and so the recommendations for
these kinds of progr.
For five million dollars or
recommendation for five.
But not specific.
I don't want to miss speak but I
know some.
As part of the psp process and
you heard a little.
Have observed absorbed into
their institutional budgets but
I can't speak to you to them
individual.
Thank you and I think that's
kind of in the in omena be
honest this.
The.
It really is because the the
very intent in the very core of
what it's trying to do.
The special you talk about the
mental healthy and talk about
these.
My my issues and this is why i'm
trying to get to is some of the
activities that are outlined in
household thirty nine.
I actually go to activities.
Outside the education around so
but my question mister chairman.
The the funds these poorly too
allocations they cross many
different departments with an
unab.
Studies.
It may be the ba md program i'm
gonna pick up these future
doctors right here two point
five million dollars for you and
him.
Those funds where they if
they're not expended by the end
of the year or those funds.
Thank you mister assurant thank
you representative for your your
question who had the numbers.
At doctor made off i'm joining
us to come and ask her.
He had come to the s.
That three point five million
and.
Yeah.
And I will say this I fully
support band program.
But when we're talking about
while in gold multilateral
indication that's actually in my
opinion it's a separate bill
we're talking abo.
And I think that's that's kind
of what that's number to be
honest and right now I I will
stay this I am very torn about
this because some of the
activities I support that I do
think that we make it easier for
our future doctors going through
that program
but there is a lot across over
and there's a lot of activities
that I believe not only go
outside of the areas of this
bill mister chairman but also
the different groups that were
not action or the austin was
also
so
mister kemin two dockets so you
said that it will support our
band student
as far as it will would tuition
with housing.
But currently we do.
Students and of course.
But we do cover last dollar
scholarship for that and we have
had seventy five percent
increases in two.
We've also had undergraduate
back of tea and school and
medicine
costs in the original bo.
Again the rising costs for
things and right now we're just
looking at trying to get the
doctors in the school.
The salary so that's another
component and then we have.
So there have been this news and
staff support as well but then
our students specially after.
The other thing is.
Students who are on the wa.
And by the end of their
sophomore year.
They will be brought into a
school and to the amd program
should be have right currently
should we have.
It's also trying to expand that
so we can.
And thank you
and part of my point
some of this bill which intended
is to help kate while students
is actually geared toward
salaries of folks outside of the
education on due to program or
emotional association health and
I think that's that's where it
is.
Two thirds of this bill
is in my opinion.
Right in line where it should be
but there are when we're talking
about you know and again this is
no disrespect as I wish I was a
doctor which I was like.
But I I think the request to
support salaries in the band de
program.
And the you know as far as of
housing is actually is is a
separate asking it's it doesn't
necessarily that's one of those
sayings it doesn't necessarily
be in house bill thirty nine so
i'll leave that at that but I
just wanted to highlight this
that.
Those are the some of the
critical points for me that.
Give me a little bit of
indigestion right here so i'm my
last question mister.
Currently we have funds
available through the indian
education act.
In his spanish education act.
In mr chairman how do those kind
of overlap I mean because those
those funds that were given I
would like to know what are the
fund balances of those
and
sorry this house bill thirty
nine
lap.
With so many intended.
Uhm.
Alchemism thirty nine because in
my in my humble.
I see some overlap in there
because I do agree that.
Our higher education.
Institutions should be doing the
same way so mister creme is
there anyone that can basically
ask or answer about.
The fund balances of those two
funds.
And the intended target and use
of those funds.
As it relates to a house bill
thirty nine.
The.
The.
Mister chair representative I
can I can speak a little bit to
the appropriations that you are
made to.
The department is responsible
for administ.
In an education act
well the funds were to support
in an education action to the
indian education fund your
appropriate fifteen million in
that fact we think.
Again this under also
administered by the department
and go to support a number of
initiatives both in school
districts
travel communities as well as I
believe some hire
programs to support initiative
language supports.
Fought with more specifics on
that there again you you
appropriate a twenty million for
five twenty four there was also
about a four million dollars
reversion or a balance in that
fund I should say.
The.
Secretary.
No.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Just as a reminder because i.
Word expressions of excitement I
know you all are here please do
that outside because we're going
to quickly transition to our
next bill so we certainly
appreciate your being here
represent bucker to
thank you mister chairman and
thank you and and and just like
with this and I choose support
many of these initiatives my my
and and congratulations to.
I guess for myself there were
some parts of this bill that I
thought did not necessarily fit
with the in.
Are in the intended group of the
yazi martinis there were some
areas there.
In those errors that don't
necessarily fit but thank you
mister madam coaches.
Thank you miss german and
representative good ola it's a
really danting task that you've
taken on and I think it's really
important you've got my yes vote
but there is a lot of
reservations and things that
will need to be cleaned up so
for that I gave me the
encouragement to continue this
road there will be a lot of
obstacles but whatever it is in
the way is a learning curb that
you're still on so then yourself
to experience the next steps of
what you will experience with
not to take personally but it's
there's a lot to learn still in
the process right good job all
right thank you represent madrid
and if you have specifi.
Sure she would come
all right so by a vote of seven
two three you have a due past
thank you
alright thank you folks for
being here we appreciate it that
was online thank you for
being patient alright so we'll
transition I do want to think
again you know and company are
free now issues this morning
certainly appreciate that
right so I mentioned.
But we're going to go to our
vice chair representative
eighty four so give it a moment
of weight time offer.
Yeah.
So
representative
please when you are ready
hospital eighty four
folks if we could have a quiet
please even up here on the panel
the madrid reservation.
Also get my teacher voice to
mister chair
all the techniques apply here
yet ten minutes you know
seventeen in stretch okay
thank you mister chair thank you
members i'm here to present
house bill eighty four
which is to.
Technically speaking at same as
public college accurately
compensation and with me today
satio wit she is a principle
lecturer at UNM main campus in
the biology department so i'll
open with a few remarks than
satio will say a few things and
them will take questions so
household eighty four relates to
higher education it requires a
minimum compensation for non
temporary and temporary faculty
at public post secondary
educational institutions it
makes an appropriation of forty
four million from the general
fund for the fiscal year twenty
twenty five and subsequent years
it also defines a non temporary
faculty it means that employee
add an institution which can
include an instructor professor
like sure and other categories a
temporary faculty means an
employee at a public institution
that includes
an adjunct instructor or term.
A non temporary.
Er is somebody that has a.
I'm going contract temporary
means it's like course by course
or term by term.
This is we've heard many of you
heard this bill last year when
representative to here was here.
An issue is that many of our
gifted faculty members who would
like to teach in higher
education end up and of course
i'm not against this because we
need more faculty in our cape
twelfth system but because of
the scrumple and see in salaries
they don't go to higher
education institutions many
they're starting salaries for
the ones with
when your contracts are below
the fifty thousand mark of a
level one k twelve teacher many
of them scramble they may teach
at three institutions to make
living wage it's.
And as we focus on career
pathways as we focus on in the
tight labor market is as one
analysis
provided
the salaries that would reach
would attract and retain
teachers and higher education
offer or are very inadequate i'm
going to ask my expert witness
now saturate to explain a little
bit more and I want to
compliment her in the people
she's been working with they've
done a much deeper dive er
throughout the campus says the
two year in for your campuses of
new mexico in providing the data
and a streamlined bill so.
Okay okay that's much better
thank you okay think you
represented
my name is you wit my principle
lecturer in the biology
department that you and main
campus I have a non ten year
track continuous position that's
eighty percent teaching and
twenty percent service
and we're representative of you
are you an am are faculty union
and i'm also the vice president
for higher education for
afternoon mexico i'm honored to
be able to speak with you today
about published college faculty
compensation.
I started my teaching career at
young m as in our junk.
I now have a continuous
appointment as a lecturer but I
will always remember how
stressful it was to be an
adjunct starting out with low
pay no benefits no certainty of
having another teaching
assignment from one semester to
the next and i've witnessed many
of my colleagues going through
these same struggles.
And i'm here to ask you to help
us.
So as representative garrett has
said this bill would establish
minimum pay rates for faculty at
public colleges and universities
across new mexico including both
four non temporary faculty with
continuous appointments as well
as for our temporary focus our
junks.
So we propose a sixty thousand
dollar minimum for continuous
faculty at four year
institutions a fifty five
thousand minimum four continuous
faculty at two year
institutions.
A two thousand dollars per
credit our minimum for temporary
faculty at four year
institutions and an eighteen
hundred and thirty three dollar
minimum per credit hour minimum
four temporary faculty of four
year institutions and
establishing these minimum
parades as a central to
maintaining the stability of our
teaching work force in higher
education we need these minimums
to retain faculty in higher many
of whom are currently leaving
for better pay in case of
twelve.
We need these minimums to
provide better learning
conditions for the influx of
students that have been funded
by the opportunity scholarship
we love to see higher enrollment
on campus but this is a
challenge for us these students
will be better supported by a
stable and experienced work
force of faculty we are
experiencing a boom in and
romant things to these
scholarships but at the same
time we have fewer faculty to
teach them this means that class
sizes are getting bigger
especially at the introductory
level and those first semesters
are critical for retaining
students.
Our students are currently not
getting the support they
deserve.
We also need minimum pay rates
to help faculty at the bottom of
their institutions pay skills
who are currently suffering from
food and housing and security
this has been documented by
unabs basic needs project which
was conducted in twenty twenty
three in collaboration with the
new mexico's hire department so
just for an example because I
know we have represent a couple
of representatives that
represent volunteer county at
unam's valencia campus according
to this survey nineteen percent
of faculty service reported that
they had very low food security
forty two percent reported that
they were housing in secure
within the last twelve months
and twenty four percent reported
that the experienced
homelessness over the last
twelve months.
So we have to do better
thank you for your attention and
your consideration i'm ready.
Thank you mister charlie's ten
for questions great thank you.
There was a.
Please on the end
of the morning you're taking the
executive director of any new
mexico standard supported
on behalf of our members of.
Great certainly appreciate
revenue all right next please
spend you have a two minutes
welcome.
It's making i'm speaking on
behalf of the legal voters of
new mexico and the american
association of university women
for the new mexico branch
and we've strongly support this
bill and we thank representative
for bringing it forward and I
thank you
I don't remember your daily the
lecture but thank you for your
amazing research i'm going to
speak as a former factory member
and actually dean in vice
president santa fe community
college where I spent twenty
eight years
and I am going to say that the
only thing I don't like about
this bill is that it seems to
discriminate against community
colleges when we have public
education salaries we don't say
you're whether you're in this
school or that
and I don't think we should you
know make the salary
differential between hired
universities and hire it
community colleges I can say as
a facility member I took thirty
eight years I had a bit of that
janked I understand
and I think it's really
important to understand it
colleges you have five semester
a five course semester load plus
you have committee work and
you're there twenty four seven
it seems you're also helping the
students who have those special
needs food and housing and so on
there so many people who are
calling on you for
just basic knees what do I do
how can I help my trial so I I
do discriminate I think there is
a discrimination here that is
unfortunate but I do whole
heartedly speaking of behalf of
my organizations for this bill
thank you.
The.
Thank you mister chair members
of committee john lipsheets with
a new mexico federation of labor
if l c I l we stand in
solidarity with our education
brothers and sisters but overall
in general we believe in for all
positions in government that we
see when you increase salaries
that that helps to recruit and
retain workers this would be no
different we thought that the
great work it does this
legislature did last session or
two sessions ago when they
increased minimum salaries for k
through twelve educators at a
time of crisis that has
certainly led to increased
participation in came through
twelve education we would hope
that youth take the same
philosophy with a junk faculty
as well thank you.
Yeah.
Two minutes welcome
good morning mr chair and
representatives
my name is alinoshina c and i'm
an adjunct instructor at central
new mexico community college i'm
also a graduate worker at you
and
and and first of all i'm here
and strong support of this bill
last semester I ty five courses
between you and i'm in cnn all
while completing my doctoral
course work in order to make a
wage that is barely livable
unfortunately this is not
sustainable on term and it's a
symptom of the gigafication of
higher education our junks like
myself are forced to take on
more than our capacity to make
ends meet with little or no
benefits and contracts that
renew every couple of months so
we are essentially hired and
fired on a semesterly basis and
our job in security contributes
to high rates of stress which
take a tall on our health and
well being so a livable minimum
faculty salary would mean that I
wouldn't have to take on five
courses every semester and a
humane work load would allow me
to give my students the support
and attention that they deserve
a junks like myself love
teaching and enriching our
community members but in order
to do a good job we need to be
able to pay our rent go to the
doctor and buy groceries so
that's why i'm urging you to
vote yes and house bill eighty
four not just through the well
being of a junk like myself
throughout new mexico but for
the better meant of our higher
education system and the
students that we serve thank you
so much.
All right we'll go to.
A good morning you have a two
minu.
Can you hear me now I can hear
you now please
my apologies mister chair
members the committee I read in
western full time faculty at
northern new mexico college i'm
also the vice president of the
local ft union and as ee I am
the new mexican and i'm lucky to
be able to work in my home state
I have been an address and I
have also watched my peers not
be able to afford to stay in the
field they love northern we
serve around eighty percent
hispanic in native american
students many who of whom are
pilgring eligible and a certain
economically challenged our
students benefit greatly from us
stable work for
and so I urge you to support
this bill so that we can provide
the quality education that our
students deserve thank you.
Welcome.
Good morning chairman romero
members we vanessa hawker and
the executive director for the
new mexico independent community
colleges and we think vice
target for bringing this
legislation yes we are in fact
having difficulties hiring full
time our part time faculty.
The difficulty with this bill
the forty four million dollar
appropriation in the bill is not
in either the legislative
finance committee recommendation
nor in the executive
recommendation we estimate just
for the independent community
colleges it would cost a minimum
of twenty six point two million
just to implement the minimum
standards which were bright out
or less than the university
standards are faculty a lower
division courses fully
transferable why should
community college backlet be
paid less than university
faculty are we respectfully
request that a study be done to
look at all of the issues issues
regarding faculty compensation
at our post secondary
institutions and how to find it
so that the cost of this doesn't
have to get passed on to the
students thank you.
Chairman members th.
Hello can you hear me we can if
you'd speak up just a little bit
more that would be awesome but
you have up to two minutes
good morning chairman romero are
now still longer professor at
the university in the mexico
school and president of united
academics at the university of
new mexico I represent
approximately fifteen hundred
back of the across the five
campuses a UNM in u and m stand
strongly and support of HB
eighty four.
In the mexico legislature has
decried the exploitation of our
job faculty for over twenty
years in two thousand three
seller joint memorial thirty six
pointed out the quote various
studies have shown that the
majority of part time fable the
members teach under substandard
conditions the memorial asked to
study the over reliance of part
time faculty into recommend the
establishment of minimum
acceptable faculty salaries in
two thousand six and two
thousand seven several bills
proposed a recurring
appropriation of fun to
basically have adjunct
compensation rates equal to
those that all type faculty and
in two thousand fifteen SB five
nine seven recommended the
creation of the fact the
compensation parity fund to
address the inequity and
compensation between adjunction
both time faculty after more
than twenty years of legislative
study and consideration public
educators and higher rate are
still waiting for the
legislature to address the over
youth and abuse of a job
faculty.
L LFC analysis suggests
enactment of each b eighty
fourth proposed minimums well
have a negative effect on
employee morale to the contrary
faculty moral will dramatically
improve as a result of an acting
HB eighty four with negatively
affects back of t moraler
poverty wages in extreme pay and
equity according to the union
basic major project twenty nine
percent in your mexico faculty
experience both housing into
insecurity last year in
according to our own analysis
the fact we salary data
temporary faculty are paid on
average less than half with non
temporary facility or paid for
the same work ie teaching course
it.
Ringing this bill forward can
you tell me our.
Yes thank you oh mister chair
representative
thank you for that question yes
we did incorporate benefits into
the calculations so we estimated
for the salary employees at
thirty percent thirty eight
percent friend rate and four the
temporary part time faculty many
of which don't have benefits but
some of which do we estimated in
the eight percent friend rate so
we did include friends rates.
Mr chair and representative or
the executive budget no but it
is basically an appropriations
bill so so for the upon ins.
Yeah.
Mr turn representative possibly
possibly okay
I mis.
The biggest racket.
Our college.
Univ.
The foundation.
I fully support this.
Mr representative that is a
great question.
The.
I think the wording would
continue and possibly some money
could be obtained.
And we have heard legitimate
feedback on the bill
and it's something of the bill
passes I would work very hard to
incorporate
what we know there's fifty five
million floating around it's
probably been spent forty times
but I would work to get some of
that money.
Thank you mister thank you
representative.
Thank you mister chair and.
Personal experience.
The.
And the bread.
Of the faculty they are.
The.
At the university.
And what the gentlem.
Stated.
The.
We have faculty mister chair I
dropped faculty graduate workers
who.
When you put the pencil to it
are working for below minimum.
Wage.
And expected to carry the same
notes there are no provisions
made no
exceptions made.
You sign that contract.
And your ex.
Is in the contract.
But deliver.
So.
This is this particular.
Is not even going to tap into
the bare minimum but it is the
beginning and i.
That.
The legislature.
Should not be the fall back.
Because the institutions have an
obligation to take care of the
bat of the university the
students and the faculty.
Without students without happ.
So the institutions have to
begin to look at where their
cost.
Instead of adding to
administrative costs.
They need to look at how they
can.
Institutionalise and recurred in
their budgets.
For and make allowances for.
Adequately and sufficiently
providing.
The grad worker pay.
There is a reason why the
graduate graduate workers
organized there's a reason why.
Trend.
Has forced workers to rise up.
The.
And fight for what it is that
they should be adequately
respected and paid for and so
there's no reason why.
In this case there's a lot of
recent way this should happen.
As a particularly.
There is no pl.
Statement of support on my part
i've had the lived experience I
can tell you for.
My income with my retirement if
I had just been relying on
adjunct or and or graduate
worker pay.
My husband and nine would be
declared indigent.
And that's a statement that is
across the board and all
institut.
Requesting large budget but not
acknowledging and respecting the
the burden.
Thank you representative.
She's representative gear to not
actually elbow buddies on the
finance and so my my questions
are going to be targe.
I think that's where.
Ma.
Mister chairman representative
garage i'm.
Fire
analyst jorgan.
I see and.
The three year for the four year
branches the three year cost is
going to be forty five thousand
or forty five million recording
to your independent is fifty two
billion for a total of ninety
seven million dollars re
occurring funds okay i'm mister
chairman.
Having said.
On the fine outside one of the
questions that comes up
mister chairman.
Is about the coverage of the
opportunity to scorge and
legislative scholarships.
And one of the questions that I
came up mister chairman another
committee is.
That the legislature
appropriates are gives more
money for these scholarships and
the universities in some cases
it seems that they increase
these prices my fear of miser
chairman and representative is
that.
By increasing these pay.
If the legislative watery scott
if the legislative score to
prince out.
These costs will be.
Are directed.
Mister chair representative that
has clearly been.
An issue that the council of
university presidents and others
have stated.
That they fear they would raise
their tuition and as we know
that is already happened
somewhere so it's a very
legitimate concern.
And thank you mister chairman
and thank you the other.
The other concern that I have is
actually that.
For some universities they may
increas.
The.
Thus further.
Expanding that cost and I do is
there any when we talk about a
junk professors do we talk about
class though we talk about class
size because like in college is
yet have so many students in
order for the class to make.
Have those considerations been
kind of accounted for your bill.
Mr chair and representative one
point is that this man it
couldn't be used for new ftes it
would be supplemental many and
i'm going to ask my expert
witness to talk about the other
point on class sizes for th.
Representative thank you for
that question it is a good one
yes I would say that from my
lived experience on the ground
that you and
classizers have been going.
And so rather than
have to rather than fees going
up what we're seeing is that
classis.
And thank you mister permanent
one of the other questions is
and again correct the numbers
wrong to chairman and
representative.
We have a twenty seven or so
high re.
The.
Regarding four year two year and
community colleges at my
somewhere in that ball.
Mister
vanessa can you confirm the
number.
Thank you I was off by one
missus chairman representative I
guess the other question about
it is of those.
Universities.
How many of them have like a
contractor collect a bargain in
agreement were.
Are they staff because that's
you know as far as can go in
there in provide negotiations
for salaries because.
I do agree with my colleague a
representative of cabinet that
the legislature should not.
That are doing this and I think
the legislature.
A lot of stuff falls on it so do
we know about the
collected bargaining agreements
negotia.
The.
How are you them actually do we
know I mean as I said I know
that we do that at the k twelve.
Or or negotiations of whether be
with the.
You know any a you know as far
as with all
do we have that at the.
Yes thank you for the question
mister chair representative I do
not know the exact numbers in
terms of how many institutions
have faculty that are ununited
states that for the most part
for the adjuncts you and I was
the only one that includes our
junks in their collective
bargaining agreement.
Does that into.
So mister chairman and
it does actually vinicity or
something that.
Colleges that I represent in
addition to the military.
In different so not all but most
of them d.
Thank you mister chairman thank
you.
Talk about it
for many of our small
institutions they have come
before this legislature never
actually asked for additional
fund.
The.
And my question it may be more
of a statement is that when we
set these minimums we do force
or may force the hand of some of
our colleges in universities.
To actually reduce staff.
Basically pay the the remain.
That is a concern it it does
involve like it's at each each
institution.
Should be able to.
Negotiate in consider it with
staff and especially because
you're talking about temporary
stuff and I think that's really
where the point.
Four times now that's ten yeared
stuff pretty clear cut to me.
It's the temporary.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Of.
I'm reading i've read.
Mister chair and.
A representative I don't think
it's really a new program I
think it's more of a concern
that they would hire they would
need new staffing to
oversee oversee it.
Madam chair of mrperiod chair
and repres.
The.
The harry.
The.
I I understand.
More competitive recruitment.
The.
The.
The.
Let me ask another question
chairman repres.
Benefits the text with holdings
everything that goes lo.
Mr chair representative i'm yes
that is our goal to be able to
include both a the salary as
well as the fridge.
Okay.
Mr chairman and.
The.
So I I don't.
This bill addresses salaries but
it does not address benefit.
Some faculty have twelve months
appointments and this the bill
only addressed a salary issues.
In my understanding this gr.
The.
You are correct that twelve
months ago he are not currently
included in the bill as it is
written I will say that i'm
twelve month contracts are are
much less common in
most of those who have them
according to the analysis that
we've done with the salaries and
that we collected through public
records requests our already
higher even after adjusted for
you know a twelve month rate
prorated.
I'm so so most of them in our
view would not be in need of an
adjustment to make these
minimums.
So some was totally taken out
of.
Okay.
Yeah.
So mister chairman and.
The.
The analysis from.
Whenever they're talking about.
Their main campus versus their.
Eliminated done and and grants
branches says the ad this does
not include the cost of c.
And leaving all other faculty at
the same rate.
Mr chair representative made I
just want to clarify that I
understand your question is your
question about compression and
whether the funding includes
you know additional monies to
bring up people who would be
compressed with my question is
your making a big difference
between those
that are paid below the minimum
and leaving the.
So.
The.
Mr share representative I will
just say about compression in
general it is already an issue
in higher ad at all levels
so this wouldn't be creating a
new problem that we already have
we already have this problem in
higher and one we're talking
about paying faculty more
livable rates of pay compression
really should be a secondary.
The.
Thank you for that response.
Are you all taken.
The.
Consideration.
Cost of living increases.
Hoping to get this.
Mr chairman presentative that
would be a later step.
I'm sorry.
That would be excuse me later
step a later step
service determined whenever
you're saying that that would.
Come in later what is that
going.
The.
The request that you.
Mission
mister representative the first
step is to raise the minimums
that step one.
Yeah.
Mrperiod german and
representati.
Yeah.
What what the cost is the bes.
Chairman and represe.
The.
And the purchase to do away with
that p.
Provide funding for.
Choose to go into the.
A quickly thank you mister
chair.
Um.
Thank you for your comments
they're all totally relevant
many of us sit on appropriations
or have sat on appropriations I
think that representative had a
really identified this ongoing.
Problem.
My own feeling is whether this
bill passes in this committee or
not I do believe that because of
the timing there's not add a
quick time
I do believe the suggestions to
do I hate to do this and I know
there's been past studies but I
think we need to updated study
in light of the opportunity
scholarship of the lottery
scholarship so.
What i'm gonna propose is that I
come back with a memorials state
this is my thinking out loud so
I think what they need to do and
i've talked to satio about this
is due in memorial with a deep
dive it does in barbaria see
because so many of these
temporary non temporary
professors are in our education
preparatory programs it's a very
common higher so I think what I
need to do is come back with a
memorial involving l LFC l s c
representatives of the various
collegiate organizations
that people like sad year the
people who are in the situation
and do a deep divine come back.
Um also is as we know the budget
a lot of it is done before this
week before the session so I
would like to do a more
realistic I am committed to this
and I know many of us I know you
all see the problem but it's how
to solve it realistically but
also in a way that really
addresses the concern celebrate.
But for it so that's my proposal
mister chairman if you can if
that's enough to say it that
way.
You'll come back with the
memorial we.
Yeah actually make this.
Appreciate representative girl
willing to make that step for
this does have a po.
And I think the study was going
to be very necessary to make the
whole picture everybody come to
the type of list do some
negotiations then let's breach
in it where it's got a rope
mister chairman thank you very
much.
With your chair you i'm going to
ask your to coast sign the
memorial often
sounds good okay so with that.
Thank you thank you all right
folks so for our members.
Also.
German.
So it's
not a secret place you know what
will come up on your google map
wait is it going to show up on
my dial
I don't I don't think so
I don't know a four one line
so well reconvene on friday
thirty
you have a good afternoon.
Yeah.
Yeah.
