Um, I'm lucky enough to have had
the opportunity to play a small
role in creating HB 54 and want
to speak briefly just in strong
favor of this piece of
legislation.
As we look to protect the lives
of our own children and
students. I believe this bill is
a crucial step towards saving
lives during cardiac events.
ADs in schools are, I believe,
to be absolutely essential. The
survival rate for individuals
who experience and out of
hospital cardiac arrest in the
United States is about 10%.
However, the survival rate jumps
to 70% when an AED is used
within 3 minutes, and when that
AED usage is coupled with CPR,
that survival rate goes up to
95%.
It's also a common misconception
that cardiac issues are
exclusively life-threatening to
adults only.
When in reality a school age
child dies from sudden cardiac
arrest in the United States,
approximately every 3 days,
which makes it the number one
cause of death on school
campuses in the #2 cause of
death for anyone under the age
of 25. AEDs are
Just about as necessary as fire
extinguishers and are used in
schools much more often than I
think we realize just a few
weeks ago, a 16 year old
sophomore named Randy in
Oklahoma.
Collapsed to the floor during a
basketball game because his
heart stopped, his opponent
Magnus ran to grab the AED in
the school and and immediately
administered CPR, which ended up
saving Randy's life.
In a video of their reunion days
after the event, Magnus tells
Randy there was no way you were
going to die in that court. I
wasn't going to let you. So
through the passing of HB 54, we
are echoing the words of Magnus
and telling our own youth that
we won't let them die.
Equipping each high school with
an AED is not just simply
another safety measure through
implementation of these devices,
we are ensuring that we are
prepared for the worst case
scenario, giving us the chance
to turn what would be a tragic
loss into a saved life.
So this is my reasoning and some
figures for the support of HB 54
as I strongly believe it will
make a difference in many lives.
Thank you.
said, Mr. Chair, we stand for
questions.
Right, so we do have an
amendment that's been passed
out, can have a motion on the
amendment, please.
So
Mr. Chairman, I move that we uh.
Like motion to uh consider the
amendment, right? So we have a
motion to discuss the amendment,
seconded by Representative Mal
Moya.
All right, we're on discussion
of the amendments. So would you
describe the amendment
representative?
Mr. Chair, members of the.
Committee
Uh
Or
The amendment talks about, you
know, implementing cardiac.
emergency response plans and
schools, so serps are like, you
know, it's, it's it's like a
road map.
Where you
have people trained.
CPR
And how to use AEDs, and you,
you can have an AED in a school,
but if, if you don't have a
plan.
Who's gonna be monitoring the
AED?
You know, changing batteries,
you know.
Changing the pads, so it's, it's
important to have an emergency
response plan if something
happens, you know, people will
know how to respond and call
911, you know, uh, somebody will
go and get an AED and.
You know, help that person and
it's, it's not just students,
you know, it's, it's for
teachers and parents who was it.
In other schools and and you
know.
It it is estimated that.
More than 2300, 23,000 children
under the age of 18.
Who experience cardiac arrest.
Outside of the hospital.
And 40% of them.
Our sports related.
In schools as, as our expert
said, like, you know, AEDs.
You know, there there's a 70%
chance of it surviving AED.
And emergency, you know, cardiac
emergency response plan.
Can increase survival rates.
From cardiac arrest by 50% or
more.
By enabling
trained lay.
under a team
Take action and you know the
surs can be standalone
guidelines.
Or merged with the school's
existing medical.
Emergency response plans, and
they can be used by school
personnel, healthcare providers,
boards of education, school
safety advocates.
You know, more than, you know.
You know, 300 and almost 360,000
cardiac.
rest occur outside a hospital.
Every year
And nearly 90% of them are
fatal.
So the American Heart
Association is working to
increase the number of people.
perform, you know, CPR in an
emergency and currently only 40%
of these people get.
Immediate help they need before.
Responders alive.
So the
This plan will enable schools to
have uh uh just like you do
active shooter drills, you know,
you, you.
You, you have a plan.
And you, you, you have whose
strained, you know, where the
AEDs, who's keeping track of,
you know, the batteries and the
pads, so it's it's, it's, uh,
you know.
And, and
You know
We, we can help with those, you
know, setting up those emergency
response plans and and.
And they're not rocket science.
And you know they're easy to
implement.
And you know we we.
We think, you know,
Just having AEDs in schools.
That's, it's a great thing, but
you know.
How to use them and have a plan.
You know, makes it
more effective
People who are
Really
Thank you.
So
that it?
Mr. um Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, basically amended.
describes a protocol to be used
and to make sure that they
And thank you, Mr. Chair,
soresentative Baca on the
amendment.
I think it was Chairman and
thank you for bringing this
forward. Uh, that's definitely
support this bill.
My, my question to you, Mr.
Chairman, and uh,
Representative
Every school right now is
required to have a safety plan.
So my question, Mr. Chairman and
Representative is rather than
create a new report.
Or new plan separate from our
school safety or other crisis
response plan, would this
somehow fit into that plan
instead of a standalone
separate, because then you're
gonna have to create a
mechanism.
For review, you're gonna have to
have a mechanism for somebody to
reviews it as opposed to just a
plan that is submitted as part
of our emergency response plans
for school.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee
representative Baca. That was
the bigger idea. This would be a
part of the school's safety plan
anyway. This would be included
in it. And what has happened in
the past is we haven't seen the
AEDs being actually um.
Reviewed and incorporated and
acted upon, but now this would
be included as a part of a
bigger safety plan. So your
point is well taken, and that
was the intent of this piece of
legislation.
And thank you, Madam Chair, and
just like.
When we talk about.
Legislative intent.
Somebody could read this
amendment.
And think that they're
To create a
A separate plan instead of part
of this because it says.
You know, as you, you see, I'm
looking at a each school shall
develop and implement a cardiac
emergency response plan.
See, that's where I think that
there could be.
Some confusion that it's
separate from the plan. Do I
think that we absolutely need
the plan? Absolutely. I do think
that it is, but it should be not
a separate standalone plan.
Because then, you know, schools
already have.
To report to someone. So I, I
just think that I know that
people, as we pass it here, I
understand that.
But I think it would carry
confusion and that other people
would feel that this was an
additional requirement.
Um, on a very necessary part of
the school. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Thank you, Representative
Vincent.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Appreciate the legislation.
And I know that every now and
then we get on the same page and
we.
We like this kind of this kind
of legislation and as a 25 year
Advanced EMT and paramedic.
Um, I, I love the fact.
Cause I'm a witness and I know
the defibrillators work.
I've watched him work.
And
Mr. Chair
And representatives, when you
When you respond to a call.
And you put somebody that you
know is clinically.
Pulseless and apic.
And
you put a defibrillator on him.
And then 3 weeks later,
They come down the hall of the
fire station and bring you a
Um
way to cookies?
Um, that's when you know that
you're doing good work and it's
very fulfilling to do that. So
thank you for this.
Uh, on the safety plan on the
amendment, this does involve
training.
For the teachers
Does the teachers get training
on the AEDs? Are they required
to get the training on Mr.
Chair, members of the committee,
Representative uh Vincent.
The idea was that every person
in the school would be trained,
not all at the same time, but
you never know when you might be
the person who's there to
actually save a life.
And in the past there had been a
bill that was passed that looked
only at the coaches. What if the
coach isn't there and the kid
needs an AED. So we wanted
everybody to at least have some
training on how these uh AEDs
are used because, like I said,
we never know, uh, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee,
Representative Vincent, whose
life you're gonna save?
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank
you, Representative Herndon.
On the
Is the training for, is the
training free?
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, we have worked out a
a plan so that the training
would be free. And uh thank
goodness to Mr. Willis, who's on
the line with us. That's part of
the things that we were looking
at. We didn't want to
incorporate additional cost to
the uh employees or to the
school.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just
wanted to throw something out
there that your local fire
departments are always more than
willing to come in and teach.
Good stuff like that for uh
public outreach and things of
that nature.
The other thing that I wanted to
know is on the device itself.
Do those, do those devices have
paramedic overrides?
And or so the, the pads are
really expensive and sometimes
they expire and you have to
throw them away.
Um, when they put the pads on.
Will a paramedic be able to plug
into that, those pads with their
life packs.
Mr. Chair
And then representative, we are
just on the amendment for now,
but part of the safety plan is
that, would that be part of
that?
Oh, you're, you're treading gray
air, gray areas here. I don't
want to let's stick to the
amendment and if it applies to
the bill, then you can point
directly where it may apply to
the bill, but we're just on the
amendment for now. OK, thank
you. Sorry for that, Mr. Chair.
That's all my question.
Represent.
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chair,
and I think we do all agree that
this is.
The
10 is exactly what we need.
On the amendment, um.
Number 2, A says beginning in
the 2025-926 school year, each
school shall develop.
Doesn't this pill just pertain
to high schools.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, Representative
Garrett, that is correct. OK, so
it should be corrected to each.
High school
And then, um,
Developing and implementing
evidence-based guidelines.
the guidelines call for annual.
Training or every 2 years
because
In the
In the bill it says online 11.
Uh, the last page, it says
training is provided annually.
But does that
Evidence-based guidelines, do
they say annually?
Mr. Chair
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, Representative
Garrett, to make sure that I
understand your question. You're
asking would there be uh
With training to make sure that
people stay current on how to
utilize these AEDs the same way
you would have a lawyer to do
CLEs on it, uh, a medical doctor
to go through.
The CLEs, you want to make sure
that the school members to um
Make sure that they continue to
understand how to use the AEDs.
That was the purpose and intent.
Am I answering your question,
madam, Madam Chair, I mean, uh,
Mr. Chair.
Uh, Mr. Chair, and, uh,
representative, it's just.
I don't want there to be
contradictions between the
amendment.
And the bill because it says
develop uh.
Amendment number 2 A 1.
It said that the plan be
developed and implemented using
evidence-based guidelines set by
the American Heart Association
or another nationally.
I'm just
If the guidelines don't call for
annual training, but training
every 2 years, but then the bill
is saying every year.
There just needs to be.
No.
Balance
Um, thank you, madam, uh, Mr.
Chair, members of the committee,
Representative Garrett, I
understand your concern. One of
the things that we want to make
sure is that the training occurs
annually and that is in
alignment with the uh protocol
that is described in uh by the
American Heart Association. So
even though they may describe it
to have it every 2 years. We
just want to make sure that the
guidelines that they set for
purposes of training and making
sure that people are staying
current, uh, on this device or,
or.
brought in the in the current
once a year. We don't think
where to go and that's kind of
why we put in the annual
presentation, but there is the
development, the guidelines, the
parameters for which that
training will occur.
So I'm, uh, if there's some
other clarification we need to
make with respect to that, we
will absolutely do that, um, Mr.
Chair, Representative Garrett.
Thank you, my final point on the
amendment is, uh, you would need
to a man, I forget the official
name of the.
Paragraph. Anybody remember
that?
The opening, you know, it says
relating to public schools
requiring
Um, I would suggest that that
needs to be.
The short title needs to be
amended.
Uh, to include that.
Um
The cardiac emergency response
plan be incorporated in the
safety plan.
That, that would need to be
added because we're changing the
content.
And that's my only
Final comment on the amendment.
Then,
madam, I do follow you.
Great. Thank you, Represent
memo.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you so much. I agree. I, I used
to be before I became a teacher,
I was the health coordinator
for, so I, I was the one
checking out all the
defibrillators and, and training
everybody and doing all this
sort of stuff. So, so I
definitely believe in this, um,
thank God my my district has one
in not only every school, but
like in the high school we have
like 5 or 6 because we're so
spread out, so like it's in
almost in every building.
Uh, because if you run from one
side to the other, you won't get
there in time, so, so those kind
of things, so I really believe
in this, um, I, I agree with uh
Representative Baca how um.
You know, developing that plan,
even just putting in the
verbiage, uh, within the school
safety plan.
Could be something that it's not
a standalone, um, just adding in
that with within the school
safety plan would be perfect,
cause then it you know that it's
just a part of that and you have
that separate little section in
there. Um, I also wanna, I, I
kind of, I, I think I followed
you on, on your conversation
with, uh, with Representative
Garrett, um, because I think uh
uh offering it annually is is
good cuz we have new teachers or
new staff, but um I know that uh
the um American Heart Associ
ation certifications for 2
years, only because I'm still
certified, so, so, and I know I
only got to do this every 2
years. Um, and so, um, and then
other questions I'll have later,
but, but I think that's, that's
kind of why you want it
annually, those that couldn't
take it this year, maybe can
take it next year, or those that
are missing, you have new
employees, that kind of stuff,
um, it's still offered, but, um,
uh, but, uh, but they may not
have to take it every year,
correct?
Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative Moya.
Thank you. All right, thank you.
Other members with questions on
the.
Amendment.
OK. So it seems like there's
broad concern about the
amendment and what it's
included, um, whether it's gonna
be all encompassing elementary,
middle school, high school, uh
school safety plans is another
thing. Um, so what I would like
to propose is that we table the
amendment.
Um, we go through with the
discussion on the bill so that
we get all the concerns of
members on the bill, we get
public testimony and um since
we've had it on the schedule,
and then you all work with us,
perhaps uh LESC staff, um, to
come up with an amendment or a
committee sub and then we can
bring this back.
All right, so I.
All right, so we have a motion
to table the amendment by
Represent Baca second by
Representative Mina Moya. Is
there any objection to tabling
the amendment.
OK.
So we'll table the amendment,
um, we had presentation on the
bill itself. So we'll go to
folks in the audience, so folks
on Zoom, um, if you're here in
support of House Bill 54, please
indicate by raising your hand if
you wish to speak, um, those in
the room that wish to speak on
House Bill 54.
Would you please indicate by
raising your hand, right, would
you line up behind our
presenters, please. You all will
have up to 2 minutes. Our folks
on Zoom.
Hold on with us. We'll get to
you all in a moment.
All right, good morning. If you
would please, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, Lily
Ortiz, uh, legislative liaison
for the New Mexico School Board
Association and and NMSBA
supports legislation that
promotes student and staff
safety. Hospital 54 is an
excellent initiative to assure
medical defibrillators are
available in our high schools,
and that staff are trained in
the use of them. This promotes
student and staff safety.
However, there is no
appropriation in house 50.
For and because there is no
appropriation, the costs would
have to be borne by the school
districts.
And it must be would like to
express our concern on the lack
of funding attached to this
initiative, which creates an
unfunded mandate in our public
schools. We do ask consideration
of uh adding an appropriation,
and we do thank the sponsor for
bringing forth this very
important piece of legislation.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir. You have up to 2
minutes.
Edward Webster, uh, government
relations director with NEA New
Mexico. We stand in support of
HB 54. On a personal note, um, I
am a certified Red Cross
Lifeguard CPR and AED trained,
um, the devices are really made
for that anybody can put these
on somebody and save a life, and
I believe within the 1st 3 to 5
minutes of defibrillation, the
survival factors higher to 50 to
70%, so we stand in strong
support of HB 54. Thank you.
Great, thank you. Anybody else
who wish to speak in sport?
Right. So we'll go to our folks
on Zoom.
So Tim, good morning. You have
up to 2 minutes. Welcome.
Good morning, Tim.
may need to unmute.
Oh, there you go.
But now we can't hear you.
If you could speak or try.
It's still not coming through.
I'm going to go to somebody
else, and then we'll come back
to you.
All right, Charles.
Good morning, Charles. You have
up to 2 minutes. Welcome.
Uh, thank you, chair.
My name is Charles Up, and I'm a
senior at El Dorado High School.
I stand in support of House Bill
54. It is imperative for every
high school in New Mexico to
install and maintain an
automatic external defibrillator
and train the staff accordingly.
Um, according to the Pew
Research Center, cardiac arrest
is more likely in those older
than 30, but can happen to
anyone, depending on a number of
certain health factors. Um, as
Jacob says, the number one cause
of death, death for students on
school campuses is cardiac
arrest, while rare rare
occurrence, having these AEDs
installed in high schools will
function as a preventative
measure in the case that cardiac
arrest occurs.
High schools are an uncontrolled
environment, so it is of extreme
importance to have as many
preventative and protective
measures as we possibly can in
case of emergency. Just as
schools carry epinephrine
auto-injectors or EpiPens for
anaphylactic reactions, schools
should carry AEDs in the case of
medical emergency. Thank you.
Great. Thank you so much.
You will go back to Tim.
Good morning, Tim. Good morning,
Chairman. Can you hear me? We
can have up to 2 minutes.
Welcome.
OK, thank you very much, uh,
committee chair and members.
Uh, I think as well too, so I
fully support House Bill 54. I
am a survivor of a sudden
cardiac arrest that happened on
May 17th of 2024, um, and like,
um, representative Vincent said
earlier, and thank you so much
for your, your career and being
a first responder, I was saved
by first responders and um the
AED machine that was used on me
at the Walmart, um, no less, and
thank goodness they had it um
just a month.
prior to my cardiac arrest. So I
am one of the survivors, and I
do fully support schools uh with
AEDs.
Because of that, um, and anyway,
it was utilized on myself, um,
between Walmart and the ER, uh,
8 times, uh, in order for my
heart to be able to sustain a
beat and so with that, uh,
committee chairman and committee
members, thank you for your full
support and, and the American
Heart Association and the
representative to help support
House Bill 54. Thank you so
much.
Great. Thank you.
Right, so that's all I have in
terms of sport. We'll go to
opposition. Is there anybody on
our Zoom that is in opposition
to House Bill 54. If so, please
indicate by raising your hand,
folks in the room, in the
opposition to House Bill 54,
please raise your hand if you
wish to speak.
Right
Not seeing anybody, so we'll
come back to committee on the
bill represent.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
again. Um, what questions, OK,
so this is for um the high
school. Um, do we know how right
now how many uh high schools in
the United States, I mean in New
Mexico, um, don't have one.
We know if there's like if
there's high schools.
I mean, I thought it was a part
of our safety plan, but it may
not be. So do we know a number
at all, any, any idea?
So Mr. Chairman of the
committee, representative Moya,
what we have found out is they
had been defibrillators in
schools a number of years ago,
but because they were not kept
up, the batteries weren't kept.
We couldn't get a determination
how many were actually there
with this piece of legislation
that will be revived so that
those hot um.
Those defibrillators would be
present in every high school,
and they will be kept current
including their batteries so
that they will not.
of fall apart again. Yes, thank
you, Mr. Chair, and, and, and
Representative, because like,
like I said, I used to do that,
so there is something on
American Heart Association that
you can have to actually keep
track and and and know when you
have to go check them and when
they need to be replaced and,
and when, and what it looks like
when, when the, when the pads
need to be replaced and, and so
when, so when you need it, it's,
it's ready and that kind of
stuff. So I definitely know, so
some most of them.
Probably had them, but they're
obsolete at this point, and if
they needed them, they, they may
not correct.
Uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative, yes, and one of
the things that we found out
when we were looking into
different types, uh, some of the
new ones actually connect to
that.
Like apps or computers in the
school, so it will actually give
the information instead of
waiting for somebody who you may
short change roles in the school
and then nobody follow up after
that so one of the things that
we actually like about bringing
it up is a new, the new models
that are out there who, who can
actually help make this process
easier.
Um, thank you. Uh, is there, um,
what I also
Um, and I don't remember, and
you'll have to correct me cause
I'm sorry, I have 21 students
coming here in a minute, so my
brain is everywhere. So, so I'm
trying to remember what I read
in here, but, uh, um, is there
something in here that is uh
requiring them to be easily
accessible. I asked this only
because
Yes, in a high school you want
it where people aren't messing
with them, but you want it to be
accessed easily in that
emergency. Sometimes they're put
somewhere in the back that is
not very and then locked.
And, and, and those kind of
stuff, so it should be, uh, you
know, something that's easily
accessible, but still not where.
Some of my very rambunctious
students can, uh, high school
students can get to them and
mess with them.
Mr. Char representative, um,
actually is part of the, the
plan that we were talking about
here because that's exactly what
we talk about, um, is maybe that
is called uh uh in the nurses's
office and however they need it
in the field that is far away so
it will never make it on time,
so part of the safety plan, Mr.
Chair, is a is is who needed
when and how accessible it is.
Yes.
Yeah, and, and, and I thank you,
Mr. Chair, and I, I, I agree
with that because like I said,
my our high school, I think.
They said we're spread out. I
think we have 56, possibly
because we have one at the
football field, one at the pool,
one at the, you know, one in and
cause we have spread out
buildings and, and you're never,
I mean, it depends on how it
might be different if you're, if
your campus is closer or
compacted, um, but ours is
spread out, so it's a, it's a
little bit different, but we've
done that already. Um, now, um,
Mr. Chair, I do agree uh that
uh.
Why wasn't there an
appropriation attached with this
for the costs of these.
to chair members, I do want you
to know that in supplements and
and uh ketchup cleanup and the
things that we've done
inappropriations that uh I was
very specific about making sure
that there was money available
in the way in which the wording
was set.
purposes of taking care of the
defibrillators. If that's uh
I thought that was an easy way
to do it than to try to put a
separate appropriation in the
bill.
OK, uh, good. Thank you, Mr.
Chair, because that's, that's
huge, that's one of the biggest
complaints that I get from my
superintendents around the
around the the the state is, is
uh is that when we require and
most of them, I think a lot of
them, they might need updated
ones, um, hopefully there's,
hopefully there's not a school
out there that doesn't have one.
but, uh, but you never know. Um,
also, uh, uh, do you know if
your language also includes
since, um, you know, hopefully
if we get uh the everything
figured out with the.
With the amendment and requiring
training and stuff like that,
um, even though the training
might be free to the school, the
teachers are still going to be,
if it's gonna be done outside of
school hours, uh, they're gonna
need that there's extra funding,
so they're so that the teachers
can get paid to be trained, um,
uh, you know, it, this would be
great, but teachers do a lot
more unpaid uh than most people
in their jobs, so and um so
definitely we would need to be
able to the the.
s would need to be able to be
able to to pay for the teachers
to get trained at that point,
whether it's a a stipend or
their daily rate or whatever,
but yeah, um, so make uh as, as
long as, as that verbiage is is
in there too, um, as far as
that, I really think that this
is a great idea. I, um.
I love, I've I've been a part of
it for for years, uh, as far,
especially keeping my coaches
cert certification up, I have to
stay up to date on this, so, um,
so, so this is, is really
important because uh there you,
you have seconds and, and, and I
think especially up at the high
school, um, now.
Sorry, I have one last question.
Now, are your
uh, Madam Chair, is your hopes
that
When we talked about um
A lot of the trainings and the
plans and and everything else is
your hope that this would be a
part of uh the schoolwide type
of training like we like I think
you mentioned like, like you do
uh fire drills or something like
that. So would this be another
drill that we would do so that
everybody is, is, is ready and,
and we see how fast that that
response is is taken, is is that
your, your hopes and or
intention in this,
Mr. She representative, um, I
think that will be up to every.
school, I mean, you have a
school who can do this.
That would be in my view that
would be the best, but I think
it will be up to the schools,
um, I'm kind of speak for my
school, my district, how they do
the trainings, how do that they
do that, that um practice, but
I, I think every district and
school has their own, but I
think it will be apt to each
one, the to develop their own
plans and to to do the pro well
we're gonna try to do here in
Brazil is everybody's is is
doing it.
OK, thank, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you Caballero.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, sponsors and experts, and
thank you to the students who.
gave testimony.
Uh, it was very helpful and it's
also extremely important to hear
from directly from our students
on this, so thank you. So I have
a couple of questions. One,
And it may be for your expert.
R AED's effective.
Also for seizure disorders or
seizures or strokes or any
anything that appear within that
family.
Of what might be um.
Part of a cardiac arrest
I think 80s are strictly used
for.
Starting the heart, so, but I am
not a doctor, so I can't speak
about.
Using for other purposes.
Thank you. I was, um, in one of
our analysis, I.
Looked at it, it makes
reference, Mr. Chair, to similar
life threatening emergency,
which is why I asked, but I,
that's something I can inform
myself on and maybe worth
looking into as well. Um, and
it's important because I know of
in our family there our
grandchildren suffer from
seizure disorders, and so, and I
also know in the district that
there are children that's that
have seizure disorders, so
that's what prompted.
the question, thank you for your
answer, and we'll all look into
it. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and
then I have um
The other question is, I've seen
AEDs all over the place, um.
Airports and public, a lot of
public places.
I'm curious as to the notice.
How are students, um, or our
students noticed.
Of the AEDs.
Being available
And are they noticed in their
language?
their preferred language such as
Spanish or multi the other multi
languages that might be
something that we might, um,
consider or
I guess encourage Mr. Chair, to
be placed in their plans. I
don't know, maybe the plan would
be more uh applicable, because I
do know that we have.
Schools all over the state that
are um multilingual.
And so somewhere, somehow, uh,
and there, and I also know Mr.
Chair, that there are a lot of
activities at the schools that
have families and extended.
Visitors, um, that might not be.
Fluent or uh literate in
English.
And so that might be something
that we would um
Consider somewhere, I don't
know, it's a
I'm not sure if you considered
it Mr. Chair and sponsors, and
if so, would you agree that
That would be part of the plan.
Mr. Chair
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, representative.
I am so sorry.
Uh, I
Representative Garrett is right
there and she's just uh right
now.
So I just
I just want you to.
Representative of
Caballero, I, that is a great
idea to make sure that when the
defibrillators or wherever they
are displaced, uh, place rather
several languages that this.
Life-saving
Protocol is, is available.
Well, thank you for that
recommendation. OK, thank you,
Mr. Chair. It is really
important, so thank you very
much for, uh, entertaining the
suggestion and I look forward to
uh passing this bill and for it
to be implemented. Thank you,
Mr. Chair.
Thank
you. I think he was chairman and
thank you.
Um
I, like I said, I support the
spill actually fortunate in 2023
to actually receive it from the
Senate side, and I was
primary care and on the health
side along with my colleague
here.
Um, Mr. Chairman, the question I
have is, what is the average
cost of a defibrillator and also
housing of the defibrillator.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, I'm gonna ask Jacob
Willis who is online. He's been
doing a lot of research on this.
Jacob, are you available to
answer that?
Yes, thank you. I am available
to answer the question. Um,
chairman and members of the
committee, so
The average cost of an AED
varies from about $1200 to about
$2500 depending on
Like how new the unit is, um,
and what, what specific model it
is. The model that we've been
favoring in our researches we've
been making the bill is D5 AED,
um,
5 AED, I believe, costs about
$2000 maybe a little bit less. I
think it's about $1700 per unit.
So if that answers your
question.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you for your answer,
expert witness, um, you know, I
guess that the, the, my
question, Mr. Chairman is
cost of also the upkeep, the
batteries and replacements,
because I know that the
batteries themselves.
They have a certain, you know,
using the AED lifespan or life
cycle, so.
Uh, any idea about those costs.
Mr. Chair, members of
Jacob, do you have also those,
uh, numbers, battery and the
other items that.
Yes, chairman and
representatives of the
community, I do. So for the if I
have AED in specific, um,
It is essentially included in
the warranty. Um, it's a little
bit more of a unique.
Um, when you phrase it, like,
You need policy, I guess you
could say, basically, you pay,
you can pay upfront or pay a
yearly fee of about $200 per
AED, um, and with that fee comes
with the warranty, so
That covers the upkeep for all
of it for the AED itself, um,
whether you pay it upfront or
whether you pay it on a yearly
basis. So the policy of what you
do, so say you need new
batteries in the AED.
Um, they send you an entirely
new AED with batteries and you
just put your old one with the
old batteries in the box and
send it back to the Avive
business or warehouse, um, and
so that takes care of the
upkeep. So they essentially take
care of it for you. It's very
nice.
Thank you, Mister Chairman, and
thank you for your answers.
And as I sit back there when we
did the spill.
And 23
Um, I was pretty much new to
legislator. Now I'm a little
older, wiser and got more gray
hairs here, um.
But
Madam, uh, Mr. Chairman, and,
and, uh,
Representative
Representative.
You know, one of the things that
we're saying is we're talking
about high schools here.
But we're missing a lot of folks
out there as well.
You know, like, I'm gonna, my,
my colleague, Doctor Blakely
from APS I was just asking her.
They have 21 comprehensive high
schools.
And they have 30 middle schools
and 87.
Elementary schools.
A lot of schools and that's a
lot of kids out there. And then
we throw in our charter schools.
State and local charter schools.
We're missing a lot and I, I, so
I guess, uh, Mr. Treman.
One of the
Would you consider as far as
understand with the high school
because I, I agree with the high
schools because in order to have
NMAA sanctioned events, you need
a defibrillator there.
But madam, uh, Mr. Chairman and,
uh, representatives.
What about the elementary
schools? And what about those
staffs? I mean, we're talking
about another, an APS alone,
280,000 elementary and middle
school kids.
And so uh Mr. Chairman.
Talking about like a tier
system, like maybe this year we
talk about high schools.
But in your bill, maybe we talk
about the implementation of the
application of this bill towards
our middle and elementary
schools. And Mr. Chairman and uh
representatives we're also
talking about appropriations
which you sit on and which I sit
on and other members of this
team.
I don't want it to be.
A cost where we're having to
make very tough decisions. I
will say that we have increased
money in the SCG. I do believe
that currently right now there's
money in our state, our SB 9
monies for capital monies that
may be used from here.
But I know some districts are
cutting it tighter than others.
And so,
Um
Mr. Chairman, I also think that
in the interim, as we sit there,
we need to put some money aside,
real money that's built into the
budget to help support this. In
my last comment, um,
Mr. Chairman is really about,
you know, with the AD I
understand about the
certification, but because of
the instructions, if anybody
could come by that has access
can also
Do that as well. So I, I don't,
you know, I want them to know
that I do believe.
That is Vincent said, training
can come from local people.
But we also need to take a look
at any costs of training our
folks here. So,
You know, like I said before, I,
I don't know, I don't know if
you're open to that or, or
coming back and saying, hey,
this is maybe for this 25, 26
school year.
And then we in the 26, 27, and
how people are able to do it
sooner.
They can do it sooner.
But I, I, I think that this is
one time we need to take a
stand, we need to make a
statement that we care about
this, these things work. I
support your bill.
I just would maybe just humbly
and respectfully ask that maybe
we make some of those changes so
that we're not back here in our
next 60 days and we're putting
this and we're finally covering
those folks in middle schools
and elementary schools. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chair.
Um
That's a really good
Um, adding it, but staggered so
that everything doesn't have to
be done at once.
Just a small thing that
representative Maor Bob Moyer
brought up is the size of high
schools. I don't want a mandate
how many were needed, but I was
at Su Cleveland.
And uh they drove me in a golf
court, uh, golf cart for 5
minutes to get to where my
meeting was.
So I would just say install a
minimum.
Of one.
And, but not to say, you know,
for every building.
That it, it could get very
expensive, but just a
recognition.
That some of these high schools.
Uh, you would die before the
They got the equipment because
they are sprawling.
But there's many schools where
one is adequate, there's smaller
schools.
So that that's just a practical
suggestion.
Without man
other questions from committee.
All right, so I have a little
work to do. You would get to get
to work with members. Certainly
all of us are very open and
willing to work on that, and
then once you do, please submit
those amendments, just recognize
the 24 hour rule before we can
schedule the bill, right? Cool.
We're gonna roll it.
Yep.
Thank you all. Thank you.
Right.
So
Right.
Representative Garrett.
OK.
He
These aren't students.
So before we go ahead and get
started, I'd like to recognize
folks from the local leadership
from land Federation of School
Employees.
We are classified employers are
they around?
Stand up to be recognized.
All right. Welcome, folks.
Welcome to House Education.
All right, Garrett, please.
Hospital 69.
You, Mister Chair.
I'm here today to introduce
House Bill 69.
The loan forgiveness multiplier
Act.
I want to mention that this um
Hospital 69.
is essentially identical to
2023's House Bill 403.
Uh, this legislation was passed
by this committee, House labor
with unanimous in this
committee, the full House with
bipartisan support past it,
Senate Ed was unanimous. It was
literally the next bill at 11:30
a.m. on the final day of the
session in the Senate, and time
ran out because our beloved
senators were hugging each
other.
So this is one of those pills
where I sat at the back and
cried.
Um,
I have it, so I do have an
expert online if we need her.
Uh, and that is Amy Chulata.
She's the outreach and advocacy
manager for the student
borrower's Protection Center.
So the public service loan
forgiveness.
program PSLF, it's a federal
program that provides federal
student debt relief to public
service workers who have worked
in public service for 10 years.
They pay their monthly payment,
uh, every month for 10 years and
then they're eligible for this
public service, uh, law and it
was enacted in Congress by 2007.
When the first group of
borrowers was eligible for
cancellation in October 2017,
98% who applied were denied, and
I was included in the denied
group, I will add as a personal
note. The program has
complicated and confusing
requirements, a year's-long
investigation by FT and the
student borrower's Protection
Center.
found that borrowers were
routine rotund
talk, sorry.
Routinely misled by their
servicers, uh, on the steps that
they should take to pursue the
program and anybody who's had a
student loan, I went through 4
different companies, so a lot
of.
misinformation happened. Many
public service workers didn't
know they were eligible for the
loan program, they weren't
notified by employers and some
employers actually refused to
certify their years of service.
the Biden administration,
several changes were made,
particularly non-tenure track
employees at institutions of
higher education, which includes
adjunct and contingent faculty
can now uh calculate the number
of hours they work by
multiplying each credit or
credit hour.
taught by a multiplier.
To determine whether they met
the 30 hours per week, uh, which
is the full-time threshold that
you're required uh to meet in
order to qualify for the loan
program.
Uh, in the beginning, they
weren't eligible, but they are
recognized now by the Department
of Education, which I understand
does still exist, um, to qualify
for this loan.
Um
And so what, what had happened,
some schools would only certify
the exact classroom hours, which
failed to take into account the
time spent not only doing
classes but grading and doing
required office hours.
So this bill tackles two of the
common issues with the PSLF
program, a lack of awareness
about the program, it's
benefits, and the issue of
adjunct and contingent faculty
certification, and I want this
involves no state money. This is
simply getting the certification
from an institution that you
qualify, so we're not talking
about anything in the budget.
The bill does 3 things. It
mandates that institutions of
higher education use a
multiplier of 4.35, which is
commonly used in the other
states that have this hour to
calculate the hours.
Uh, it encourages institutions
to maximize the amount of time
they're able to certify and to
treat consecutive academic terms
as continuous employment, even
if there's vacation breaks. It
mandates institutions to certify
employment in a timely fashion
for both former and current
employees when it says.
Former, I taught at two
different school districts, uh,
Pasadena and uh.
Uh, Albuquerque and so when they
say former and former, it means
some some place that you worked
full time, but you're not any
employed there anymore.
allows institutions to certify
employment directly with the US
Department of Education for
groups of individuals if the
department sets up that process
and finally it mandates that
public service employers
annually share the information
about the program with their
employees. They're supposed to
share a letter, a fact sheet,
and
list of frequently asked
questions. This is not something
that an institution has to
invent the documents are already
created by the US Department of
Education and the institution
simply makes those available.
Other states have passed this
legislation.
Ah
5 states that I know of that
have mandated include Colorado,
California, Oregon, Washington
and New York.
Uh, and this bill is very
similar to the one that was
passed in Oregon a few years
ago.
So, um,
I urge you.
Obviously to pass it with that,
I stand for questions. Uh, does
my expert witness want to add
anything?
Am I able to speak? Can you hear
me?
Yeah.
Uh, I'll just say very briefly,
like, good morning Mr. Chair and
members of the committee. Uh, my
name is Amy Salata, and I'm the
outreach and advocacy manager at
the student borrower Protection
Center, a national nonprofit
policy organization focused on
ending the student debt crisis.
This bill will ensure that those
eligible for PSLF in New Mexico
get to reap the benefits of the
program. To date, only 5450 New
Mexicans have received PSLF, and
we believe that number could be
much higher if these measures
are implemented across.
the country, 8 other states have
passed similar bills regarding
notification of the PSLF
program, and 5 of those states
have also mandated the
multiplier be used to calculate
hours. Um, thank you for the
opportunity to speak and I'm
happy to answer any questions as
well.
All right, cool. So we'll go to
our audience or their folks here
who are in sport of House Bill
69 on Zoom, if you would please
indicate by raising your hand.
folks in the audience.
All right? So if you all would
please line up behind the
sponsor. You wish to speak,
you'll have up to 2 minutes,
please.
Uh, good morning, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, John
Dich with AFT New Mexico, um, in
2023, I was on that journey with
Representative Garrett, also
shedding a tear at the end of
the session as time ran out on
this very popular piece of
legislation. And I think the
biggest thing that this uh bill
does or has the potential to do
is something that
representativeoral Moya
referenced earlier is that
educators do so much more
outside of the classroom and
that's really what it's at the
heart of this legislation. We
know that contingent faculty and
adjunct um
Educators, they maybe only see 3
or 6 credit hours, but what this
bill does is allow them to have
that multiplier count towards
their office hours, their
advisement, their grading, their
student supports that all happen
outside of those very small
course credits, and this allows
them to be um more quickly
certified for their service loan
forgiveness under these
programs. So we urge you, as you
did in 2023, to support this
legislation, and hopefully we
can get it through the Senate in
time here in 2025. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
2 minutes. Welcome.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee. My
name is Johnny Montoya, director
of government relations for New
Mexico State University, and uh
we'd like to thank the vice
chair for, for carrying this
important piece of legislation,
and we stand in strong support.
Thank you.
committee members, Edward
Webster, NEA New Mexico
government relations director,
um, we stand in strong support
of HB 69 based on what John
said. So we urge you to vote yes
on SB 69. Thank you.
All right. Thank you so much.
Anybody else who wish to speak
in sport?
Right? So we will go to a person
on Zoom, so Veronica.
Morning, Veronica. You have up
to 2 minutes. Welcome.
I think I made an error, sir,
but um, I'm, I've been in higher
education teacher in nursing for
over 14 years, besides being a
nurse for 44 years, and I am
still paying off some of my
student loans for my master's
degree, and I, I just never
seemed to meet the criteria. So
I would appreciate these
changes. Thank you very much.
All right, very appropriate
mistake. Thank you for joining
us.
Alright, so is there opposition
on Zoom or in the audience here
with us.
In opposition for House Bill 63,
please indicate by raising your
hand.
time. All right, then, we will
come to committee representing
Moya, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and um
thank you, Representative, um, I
remember this one, so, um, so,
um, I, I, I really believe in
this program. Um, I, I have 9
payments left, and just just to
let you know, I have 9 payments
left for my for my bachelor's
anyway, so, so, um, I think this
is a great thing, but the fact
that there are some people that
don't realize that they qualify.
This is huge. Um.
Uh, so this is basically just
making sure uh like the bulk of
it is is making sure that those
the those postsecondary teachers
now have access that couldn't
have access before because the
way it was, it was multiplied,
correct?
Mr. Chair and Representative,
yes.
And then, um, thank you, Mr.
Chair, and so, um, I also like
that uh that you kind of put in
there that they need to answer
the, because everything is done
digitally, unless you want to do
it the way load, the snail way
on, on paper, and then you have
to go and deliver it, but
everything is done digitally and
um and I know that you said
former employees, I had to uh
had to do all that. My, my
district is great. All you gotta
do is let them know poof, and
they get it done, but other
people, it might get lost in
their email and so, uh, or
you get a wrong email, but you
have to recertify every year,
uh, when you're, when you're on
it because you have to, you, you
have to certify those new years
to count towards and and they
have to have verification. So
the fact that you're putting in
here that it should be done in a
timely manner is great because
um they kind of have to
They need to look for it because
if it's not, then it closes and
then you have to go it again and
do it again. It's, it's a pain.
It really is
But it's worth it in order to
get lots of stuff for given in
that process. So, um, so thank
you for for putting that, um.
What is, um, now I just totally
lost the.
The
Can you run through me with just
one more time as far as the the
the.
The calculation of of the time
worked. How does that?
Work in uh what's the difference
between how it's calculated now
and how you would like it
calculated.
Mr. Cha and Representative in
the past, it didn't exist.
So this makes it and many of our
adjuncts teach at 2 and 3
community colleges, so this way
they can add it up.
Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
So that makes sense because it's
not just one institution and,
and, and each one doesn't have
to stand alone, it'll be
aggregate as far as uh for all
of them.
Yes, Mr. Chair and
Representative, excellent, thank
you. That's all my questions.
Thank you.
you represent me or sorry, Robo
Caballero.
The other, yes, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, Representative, and I do
recall this and thank you for
bringing it up again. I just
wanted to say um as well
speaking from personal
experience.
and having been an adjunct and
part-time faculty, this is.
On the minds of everyone, um.
Because it's a huge burden. And
so if we could do this, that
would be uh and get it to the
finish line and signed, it would
be a huge benefit and help.
In that very difficult
qualifying process because it's
long. I've been through it, Mr.
Chair, uh, you have to.
Supplement with so many
different qualifying points, and
it's just very difficult, but
what's more difficult and I'll
just add this is trying to add.
Uh, legislators who are
students.
Who have are on student loans.
And getting us as public
servants, uh, defined as public
service servants.
That is even a bigger challenge,
and I'm going through that.
Uh, right now, and I will tell
you that our senator, uh, Mr.
Chair Lu Han's office has been
extremely helpful in navigating
through that. So I say that
because I don't know how many
more of us legislators are in my
position, but it, it.
It, we, we're not even in there.
Because we're the only state in
the.
So again, that's a huge um other
point I have, I wanted to just
add to it because somebody might
be in that position.
I hope they will be, uh, we have
students as legislators. Thank
you. So I have a big question,
um.
Well, I don't know how big it
is, but it, it is a question I
want to know whether
This would be a combination of
Contact and credit time.
Would that be, how would that be
defined or how would that be
worked out?
She's representative each
contact hour of class time would
be multiplied that's what I
thought.
So then, Mr. Chair, thank you,
representative, um.
The other
Comment I wanted to make when
possibly question is that I'm in
the ethnic studies program.
And there are lots of ethnic
studies programs in our high.
Institutions.
And we are part of what we must
do to comply with our academic
program is community work. A lot
of community work. In fact,
that's what ethnic studies.
Um, is really based on is the
relationship between Mr. Chair
of the academia and, and
community work, would community
work.
Um, be part of that multiplier.
Contact uh considered contact.
Mr. Chair and Representative,
this refers.
To the teaching hours of an
adjunct or contingent faculty
multiplied to that 4.35
multiplier would take that into
account, but there would not be
a separate uh.
Point for that.
So, thank you, Mr. uh.
Mr. Charon, representative, so I
failed to say that, yes, we, we
go into the schools, high
schools and middle schools.
And uh part of our curriculum
requirement is to offer
teaching. So I guess that would
be part of that. And that was
why I was um asking that
question. So thank you, Mr.
Chair and Representative.
This is an excellent bill, and I
urge the committee to vote for
it. Thank you.
Thank you. Any other questions
from folks, comments. All right,
so I'll accept the motion at
this time. Represent Virgo
Cavia.
I, I move, Mr. Chair, I would do
pass on House Bill 69. So
there's pass motion by a
representative Royal Caballero
and 69, the second buyer
representedital Moya.
Um,
Is there any opposition to the
Du pass motion?
Right? Seeing none, you have a
do pass House Bill 69. Thank
you.
Right.
So I'll go to your
representative Gonzalez and
House Bill 297.
All right, are you ready?
Please
Um
Thank you, Mr. Chair. um
Thank you committee. Um, today
we are here presenting House
Bill 297, um, which is an
expansion for licensure for an
for computer science
endorsement, um, for all grades,
um, I do want to introduce my
expert witness that is here with
me.
Um, Miss Paige Prescott, she's
executive director for the
Computer Science Alliance.
Um, I do want to make a note
that this piece of legislation
does um support existing
legislation right now. Um,
currently there's an existing
pathway for computer science
endorsement, um.
The existing pathway, however,
um, there's 2 of the pathways
that are set to expire, um, now
coming up in
Now, now coming up towards the
end of the year, um, and they're
also, um, the licensure um
requirements were very specific
in the previous piece of
legislation. So this just opens
up the pathway, um, to include
not just secondary licensure,
but also K-12 and all the other
types of licensure that can
exist. Um, so essentially this
bill, and I do also want to make
a note, Mr. Chair, that there is
an amendment, but if, if
preferred, I will present it
when it is. Yeah, if you would
present it and then we'll go.
to the amendment. OK.
Um, I do want to make a note
that to receive.
The computer science
endorsement. Um, it does in the
bill and the legislation give
multiple pathways of how that
can be attributed, um, the
pathways are listed in
legislation, um, starting on
page 3, earning course credits
in computer science, um, passing
a license or examination, um,
having minimum years of work
experience, having industry
certification, um, completing
minimum hours of professional
development within a specified
time and having so many years of
computer.
science teaching experience. Um,
this bill also does um request
an appropriation through public
education specifically towards
um professional development and
assistance with this licensure.
So with that, anything
additional.
Please welcome.
My name is Paige Prescott. I am
with uh education
nonprofitmputer Science
Alliance, and we worked to
expand computer science
education in our state,
primarily through teacher
professional development, uh,
and I was, uh, I worked with,
um, representative Sareana in
2021 to pass HB 188, which was
the original endorsement.
Uh, since that endorsement
became effective and up um
available to our New Mexico
educators, we have 129 uh
teachers that have gone for that
endorsement. We have seen that
it's very motivating for
educators to have a pathway, a
clear pathway to get an
endorsement in computer science
and it motivates them in their
professional learning and their
choices, and it also helps
administrators to decide
and when and who can teach
computer science in their
schools, um, since 2017, uh,
we've been working on policies
to support computer science
education and these um bills
that are targeting the expansion
and inclusion of other educators
to provide computer science, but
with competencies that are
aligned to computer science. Uh,
we are going to be able to see
in the future our students.
Having much more access to
computer science and high
quality computer science, um, in
their schools.
Thank you.
Um, so thank you, Mr. Chair, um,
with that, um, I will go ahead
and if you have your amendment
in front of you. Alright, so
in front of us.
Represent.
I move to I just uh for
discussion.
Alright, so we have a motion to
discuss the amendment seconded
by the Vice Chair Garrett. All
right, so please representative,
um, essentially all the
amendment does is it just clears
up some language, um, uh,
instead of just using a
semicolon to, to.
Say that all of those pathways
that I had mentioned instead of
an or you do not have to
complete all of those pathways
to receive this endorsement. You
only have to complete one of
them. Um, so the language is to
at least one of the following,
and it just.
aligns the language to um really
just be clear that you only have
to complete one of those steps
to attain. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you. All right.
Questions on the amendment.
that
solved all my questions about
the bill, so thank you for doing
that wonderful amendment.
It's not
I'm sitting there. How can I
possibly do all that stuff.
Thank you.
Can anybody top that?
All right, so,
Problem solver and
thank you Mr. Chairman, I move
adoption, right, so you have a
motion to adopt the amendment by
representing Moya. Is there any
objection to adopting the
amendment?
No
We have an amended bill.
Cool
Um, thank you, Mr. Chair, um,
you know, again, just wanna add
the importance of how, how
important preparing for the 22nd
century is, um, I will use that
language as one of my other STEM
colleagues has used that in
other terminology and um I think
this is just um one of the many
steps towards really stressing,
particularly within schools.
Um, and so with that, I ask you
to support and we stand for
questions.
All right. Thank you all so
much. So we'll go to our
audience. Is there any
opposition or opposition.
To House Bill 297 on Zoom,
please indicate by raising your
hand, folks in committee.
Please raise your hand if you're
in opposition to House Bill 297.
Alright, no, we will go to
sport. Is there support on Zoom
and in our audience for House
Bill 297, and you wish to speak?
All right. So, sir, in the back,
you look like the only one, so
if you would please come up to
the microphone.
You'll have up to 2 minutes.
Welcome.
Oh you have OK.
Uh, good afternoon, Mr. Chairman
and members of the committee. My
name, good morning, I guess it
is. Uh, my name is Roy Soto. I
am a registered lobbyist for
Microsoft.
And for general dynamics IT.
And, uh, but I'm also here to
speak as a
Former state chief information
officer and cabinet secretary
for the Department of
Information Technology. I was
the first cabinet secretary, uh,
Microsoft, first of all, has
always supported computer
science education.
I think that it's been one of
the leading employers of
individuals that understand
computer science.
Uh, as a cabinet secretary with
the department, uh, we struggle
to find people that were
qualified not only in the
department.
But throughout the state
government that understood
computer science.
Yeah, people say computer
science is merely coding, it's
not. Computer science, and I'm
gonna read this is a study.
Of computation, information.
And automation.
Applying principles of logic,
engineering, and mathematics to
various functions.
So
People think that there's still
a telephone. It's not, it's a
device you can do everything
with it, or.
My grandkids know more about
computer science because of this
device than they do.
Learning in school
Yeah, I've been working with uh
uh Miss Page and uh
and Aga says we enacted the
first piece of legislation. Why?
Because Arizona.
Utah
Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas.
Their legislation.
Embodies computer science in the
schools. We were the only ones
left out of it, so I support
this bill as amended, and I
encourage you to also support
the appropriation for future
development.
Thank you.
Thank you. Anybody else in our
audience speaking in support of
House Bill 297, right? So we
will go to Amy online.
Good morning, Amy. You have up
to 2 minutes. Welcome.
Hi, good morning. Um, committee,
I, um, along with Paige
Prescott, sit on the expanding
computing educational pathways
team for New Mexico. It's part
of a national coalition to
expand computing education to
all areas of the state, and I
wanted to echo what the previous
uh speaker said that computer
science is a lot more than just
coding. When we teach computer
science, we're also teaching
foundational mechanical
engineering, electrical
engineering.
And if you look at the new
national career clusters for
CTE, um, which you can get them
through the college and career
readiness bureau, um, digital
technology and computer
programming is now a
cross-cutting cluster, so they
expect, according to the
national experts on workforce
development, they expect
That the need to understand
computer science and computer
technology will be necessary
across all career clusters from
agriculture, um,
To marketing. If you look down
at NMSU, they have an
outstanding uh computer science
department that works hand in
hand on agricultural technology,
um, so computer science and
computer tech technology is
absolutely vital um to our kids
and right now in this age of
people, um,
Deciding that because vendors or
um people that wanted to sell
you something, say you don't
need to learn to code, the AI
will do it. Uh, we need to stand
up for computer science in New
Mexico, because um it is
absolutely vital to our
continued success and being able
to grow our own scientist that
can go on, um, to work in
industry, because if we don't
grow our own, um, then our
further workforce development,
it's going to fail. Thank you.
Thank you.
Right
We don't have anybody else, so
we'll come to your committee.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
um, Representative. I, I was
very happily signing on to this
bill, so I, so I definitely
believe in it, I just have a
couple of clarifying questions
though, um.
But on page 3, when it's talking
about the different ways that
they can um get the endorsement.
Um, the, when it says pasta or
or I know with our, we now
striped or struck a past, but
the department approved teacher
licensure uh examination for
computer science. Is there one
already, uh, that's
differentiated from science
cause I have taken the science
endorsement and it is pretty
crazy, um, so, and so I would
hate for it to be lumped in
that, so there is there one
specifically for computer
science now.
Mr. Chair, uh, Representative
Miramal Moya, yes, there is a
specific praxis and other
provider, um, exams for teacher
um competencies.
Thank you. uh, thank you, Mr.
Chair, and, um, and so correct
me if I'm wrong, that you're
wanting this to be a K-12 type
of license, not as specifically
just a secondary, uh, license,
correct?
Um, Mr. Chair, um, Madam
Representative, um, it's just to
expand the option to open it to
any license, which is very
specific to only be secondary,
but you can also have a K
through 12 and all excellent,
thank you. um, thank you, Mr.
Chair. The other
Um, OK, yeah, so the 3 or more
years of computer, I, I really,
um, so this was the on, on the
last page, on page 4 in, in uh,
in that subsection 6 where it
talks about 3 or more years of
teaching computer science and
having that uh that thing, so
this will definitely open it up
to those that are currently
teaching that we'll be able to
get this uh this uh this
endorsement and um and not have
to go through all of the other
stuff because they've been
teaching it forever, right? So
this is really helps those
current.
s correct?
Um, Mr. Chair, Madam
Representative, yes, it does,
um, it does recognize the value
of progress, um, just to give
you some background on history
of computer science, um, in
2018, the standards were adopted
by the PED for K through 2
instruction has been taught um
throughout the years, it's been,
you know, varying in
implementation within the
schools, um, so again, this is
part of the rollout is to allow
this endorsement to be as.
To now come to fruition um for
those teachers that may have
already always been teaching
computer science.
Excellent, um, Mr. Mr. Chair
and, and Representative, I
really like the different ways
that we can get to this because
often with our CTE.
Um
Programs is, is finding people
to to teach them.
One, and finding people that
have the exact education, so
this gives them many different
avenues, whether they have
experience in there and they're
working in this industry that
that that's gonna count and get
them that endorsement.
Everything else, because uh it
sometimes we have a desire to
have these classes, but to find
people to film is a completely
different story.
Um, and, and, and the, and the
students, um, would love to take
these classes, but again,
finding someone to fill that
position is, is, is huge, so
giving them many different
avenues for this endorsement,
it's great. Thank you.
Representative Urola.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and
Mirabal asked a couple of my
questions, so I think I have
just one. I hold up technology
endorsement.
Um, and I really like all these
choices because when I was
applying for, I just check what
I have and I checked all all of
them. What, what is different in
technology endorsement from this
one for secondary level, Mr.
Chair, Mr. Chair, Representative
Guola, um.
The
This endorsement is different in
that it aligns to computer
science competencies that exist,
uh, national organization of
Computer Science Teachers
Association has specific
standards that are uh not just
the content, but also um other
aspects around computer science.
So it does differentiate in
terms of the, the content that's
there, technology endorsement is
more broad in the types of
classes that can be taught.
But computer science is going to
um dial in a little bit more
specificity, uh, based on the
computer science standard.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I'm just thinking that um I was
offered to teach computer
science several times with my
technology endorsements, so
that's what I was confused on
that, um, so somebody who Mr.
share, somebody who has that
technology endorsement could do
computer science.
Mr.
Um, Mr. Chair Representative
Gudola, that is correct, um,
right now there are very few
restrictions uh through the PED
on what, on who can teach on.
Courses and the endorsements
needed in specific to computer
science. However, we anticipate
that that broad, um,
Uh
Net for educators is going to
start to close as computer
science education matures in New
Mexico and so we are
anticipating this with this
endorsement that there's going
to be um
Some standards, some
competencies that are specific
to computer science and that
administrators will know who is
prepared to teach computer
science in the future. But right
now, yes, it's broad if you had
a technology endorsement or not,
you could teach computer
science, not all courses, but
many of them. However, uh, we
think that.
And we've seen this occur or the
Um, discussion about this, that
it will start to narrow, and so
we want to make sure that we
have teachers that are endorsed
properly in order to teach those
courses in the future.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
uh, panel for this um my last
question is, um, everything in
education changes frequently. A
technology goes faster.
Uh, I keep saying whatever I
learned when I went to college
doesn't exist and whatever I'm
just a he didn't existed when I
went.
Um, I think the only part that I
would love to see in this, um,
maybe in the future is a
continuous improvement plan for
this cause um
With
Uh, whatever we are teaching to
the students may not be relevant
or be very basic in some years,
but that's just a comment. Thank
you, Mr. Sharon. Thank you, bye.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I also want to
echo that sentiment, um, being
that this is a fairly new
endorsements and again is
referencing the.
maturing education scape, um,
that was, um, you know, some of
maybe the original attention in
the original piece of
legislation. Um, so now writing
it.
And opening it up so that we
wouldn't have to revisit this in
2 years should it expire, um,
but also very much recognizing
the intent that with technology
change with computer science
changing, um, as that advances
and more requirements are put on
the national computer science
may need some evaluation.
Thank
Thank you. Any other questions
from the committee?
The will of the committee?
I, Mr. Chemova do pass on House
Bill 297.
So we have, we do pass motion I
represent Aurora is seconded by
Representative Royal Caballero.
Is there any opposition to the
Du Past motion.
feel obligated. OK, you don't
go.
Right, so you have a pass on the
House Bill 297. All right. So,
That's it for today, folks.
We'll see you. Oh.
There are folks, sorry, thank
you for the reminder.
All right, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and, and,
and audience. I have some of my
Berlin High School staters here
and they're, I believe there's
20 students that came up today
and they are gonna be shadowing
many of that are on uh on this
panel plus, um, a couple of a
few senators and so I would like
for them to stand up, introduce
themselves, tell me your name,
grade, and who you are
shadowing.
All right, do we still have the
microphone around microphone,
microphone.
Is he microphone. Can we get the
microphone please for the
students to introduce
themselves. Uh oh.
Almost
All right, you can pass it to
him. We'll just pass it down the
line. Thank you.
I'm.
I'm a sophomore, and I will be
shadowing Susan Herrera.
My name is Cole Rodriguez. I'm a
junior and I will be shadowing
Representative Brian Baca.
My name's Olivia Montoy. I'm a
sophomore and I will be
shadowing representative Mirabel
Moya.
My name's Naomi Theodore. I'm a
senior and I will be shadowing
representative Ca Alejandra. I'm
a freshman and.
Excellent. uh, Mr. Chair, these
many of these kiddos had to put
up with me in elementary school.
I was their PE teacher, um, some
of them have had me as a science
teacher in high school, some of
them will have me as a science
teacher in high school. And then
I think even some of them I was
their basketball coach, so there
was a, so they, they, they've
they have to put up with either
coach T cuz that's what they
called me or Miss Moya for a
long time. So, but, but very
proud of these kiddos and and
I'm so glad that they're that
they're here today. Great,
welcome to House Education.
Pray with that, we will see you
all on Friday.
