Representative.
Representative

Good morning I'm

I'm going back to
Representative.
I.
Okay thank you
chair woman.
Garrett.
Last year when we get rid
I just promoted
you.
Chairman.
Here. Great we
do have a quorum.
Right so this is almost like an
asynchronous state good morning
everybody.
At school if you need
to keep your cameras off I totally
understand just stand
by but Madam pretend
please be soft on
us this morning.
Well I just want
to thank all of
you for.
Staying up all night
pasaporte legislation
so
at reminiscent
from me for when I was in the
house I think we did about
5 times or my 20
years so it seems
to have stepped up a little
bit more in recent
years.
It wasn't just device back
then
so.
So this is
the E. R. B.
contributions you
may remember last
year that we tried
was Senate bill
42
to increase
the contributions
to the E. R. B. 1
percent a year
for 4 years
up last year we
were at 14.15
percent your
before us
so when we passed the bill
last year
to move it eventually to
18.15
percent trying
to reach a little more parity
with para.
When it got to the house
they cut it in
half.
So we funded 2
years at one
percent.
That second one
percent is due to go
into effect July
one. What
this bill does
is reinstate
those 21 percents
that work up last
year the
LFC in the
interim
determined that
they had funding to
increase the E. R. P.
contributions by 1
percent this year
so this year.
Fiscal year we will
have the one percent from
last year and the one
percent that the the
LFC suggested
putting in and
then we'll have another
one percent next year
so essentially
races that year
be employer
contribution
at 2 percentage points
more over 2
years so
this year
because of last year's bill
it'll be 2 percent inexorably
one percent up on not
being too confusing
but I think it's
important to realize
how we got here
so the the
additional one percent for the
next fiscal year is in
the budget early in the
budget for it
for the educational
community
K. 12
it's about
$20000000
for higher read it's
about another 12
of both of those
are in the budget
so.
This attempt to reach
a better more
parity with para has been
going on for a number of
years I know
you all know this but the
benefits to
educators have
been scaled
back I think
pretty significantly
over the last
10 years.
E. R. B.
recipients
don't really get
a good cost of living
adjustment because
for last
since 2012
R. coli has
been attached
to the solvency of the
fund. Well
we've now done that with
para many
many years later
so the multiplier is
different you have
to.
When you're when you if you
start right now
the multiplier smaller
for your first
5 years or
so then it starts
going up it's an
incentive to stay in
teaching longer
up but when people talk
about well wired to reining
in the budget
it's because they have been
rained and
consistently over
the last 15
years and
so now really the only
thing missing is an
employer contribution
we can't use our promo
any we can't use
nonrecurring money
that's against the
law so this
will help the solvency
of the fund
and that's it in a
nutshell Mr chairman
I don't have any
experts
happy to answer any
questions.
Great thank you madam
pretend so we'll go to
the attendees side those in
support of
Senate bill 36 please
indicate by raising your
hands.
In a moment.
All right so you have a to
2 minutes for
pre for is
better.
Mark please
2 minutes welcome yes good
morning Mr
chairman.
We lost you we
got some muffled sounds

is okay so
the closer we I'm within
Mexico County university president
and executive director and I
Representative 74
universities in the presence
and and working with the
regents of those universities
we also are members of stakeholder
groups that have have worked with
the Sanchez with this
with this legislation for number years that's
public and and higher
at and yes
it does increase the R. B.
contribution which is
is been needed for some time
it does have to keeping this
the fund solvent and then for the
liability and it
does it's important for teachers

option this is part of how
we are able to retain
our person I'll just
note with all of

contributions to the educational
retirement fund for the following
reasons
one retired educator
should have the security of the stroll
pension during their elder
years and this bill
will help provide data
security for New Mexico
educators for many
years to
it will also help retain New
Mexico's teachers in our
schools as a number
of educators dwindles the
pension benefit really
is an incentive for attracting
teachers to our state.
