Thank you and i'm bill souls

where the beautiful ord.
Background in history and
education at just about every
level.
The.
Middle school and elementary
principle high school
school board schoolboards
association.
Then on this committee all
twelve years now that i've been
in the legislature and chaired
it for the last eight
so all things education I I warn
people out.
Very nice to be on this and I
think when we know that
including higher more than fifty
percent of the budget is
education this is a very
important committee to make sure
that we're doing right for our
kids in our education.
Is our been our long time
education committee secretary
and make sure that everything
runs smooth and well and mary
end if you'll help with that.
My shadow is.
This is an animal soccer player
as she was the team captain
defensive player the year first
team of conferences last year
she's a public health graduate.
Social worker public health
areas.
In my elbow surgery.
But met her last night and
invited her to come to see
inside baseball as the what's
going on with.
The.
Yeah.
She looks little but don't mess
with one of the.
And then some of our regulars
that we have all the time stand
rounds who is superintendent
association joe gean with the
school boards association
charles good mocker who for
years have been with any a and.
And other things.
From new zealand.
And works in the the senate.
Yes communication department.
The.
Yeah.
I'm getting confused with the
other one and daniel with less
sea and you're going to be
regularly.
Wonderful and so when their
questions from the less and in
the back you might.
Haven't heard of your lots
during this legislative session
as well couple of things you and
things aren't that different we
all of the meetings are web test
we are going to be starting at
eight thirty in the future make
sure they don't a short session
we don't get behind can keep up
with all of the bills as i've
done in the past we tried to
allow in public comment anybody
who wants to make pump public
comment that limit that to two
minutes people in this committee
have been very good about that I
somewhere jokingly tell the
story when time we had the
president of the nava home
nation in here and I gabbled him
down when he has two minutes
were up by trying to be very
consistent with whoever is in
the committee so that we don't
have people that are.
The other thing is as we've done
in the past we will always end
about five minutes before the
floor session so there are.
Many times warn people when
they're down there if they want
to keep talking their bills
likely to get rolled over but
that's a commitment to our
committee that we are down.
As always and in most of the
committees comments come through
the terror just so that we.
Trying to think any other.
This committee we have not had
any kind of a rule that all
amendments must be you're ahead
of time if it's a long amendment
that certainly is helpful for
mary and to have things written
down if it's just a one or two
word correction or something
fairly simple that we can do on
the will try to do that but
unlike the finance committee we
don't typically rewrite bills on
the fly in this committee which
makes it very hard for the
public.
The s.
Now
couple of things also this is a
thirty day session and so.
The.
Charles good mocker is talked
about having a committee dinner.
But that's a little difficult in
the thirty day the house is
having theirs on monday i'm
going to check with the chair
about potentially having a
combined committee dinner of
both.
That's a little easier in
scheduling it certainly easier
on the lobbyists and others who
manage all of that so
potentially next monday may be
the committee dinner for
education both house and senate
will see there also are burritos
that I believe were.
Available to us from department
of tourism
so please grab one of those
more than that job yes.
I would.
And that's with the annual m SB
a needing a where out school
board members from around the
state come up to the lobby to
learn about edge.
The.
Anything else again we will
start at a thirty.
We are to join the house or a
budget overview when we.
Encourage everyone grab a bari.
Thank you all for being here for
the the first meeting
appreciated and we try to start
right on time please try and be
here on time and again i've got
a commitment to the committee
that will finish in time for the
floor s.
With that thank you all for
being here let me turn this off.
