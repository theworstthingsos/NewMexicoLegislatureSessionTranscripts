in 2 in terms ago, this did go
through the interim process. Um,
and one of the reasons
Um, you kind of touched on this
difference between T Tel
endorsement and and bilingual,
and it's actually really
difficult one. We don't have the
data to know at the moment we
don't
know which Tors teachers are
serving how many ELe students in
their class, for example.
Although we also know that we
have a lot of English learners
across the state and so much of
a difference that would make,
but I will say also that one
thing we noticed, um, when we
did look into an LFC noted this
as well in their eva
With that we actually have a lot
of bilingual endorsed teachers
in the state, but only around 20
of them are teaching in BMEPs
and national research as well as
local surveys in the state have
attributed this to an extra
burden, uh, that bilingual
teachers have felt and having to
create additional resources. If
you look at the HQIM, the high
quality instructional materials.
There are some Spanish language
arts approved curricula, for
example, but if I'm a 3rd grade
bilingual teacher, and I need to
be able to teaching.
High quality instructional
materials in English for all the
subjects for all my students,
the equivalent native language
don't exist. Thank you,
Chairman, and again, bilingual
to me is a lot clear, clear
picture, OK.
It's the teasel.
Uh, you know, at a
I can speak in and for, for many
schools across the district.
I, well, there may be only a
few.
Bilingual certified teachers.
Anywhere from 15 to 20% of the
staff or more have a peaceful
endorsement, and that's why I'm
Saying is that you, we would
have to, you know, make those
kinds of determinations by
having that Tiesel endorsement
alone.
Does that qualify me, Mr.
Chairman, the other question I
have is how we're we're
beginning to have multiple
endorsements. How are we going
to navigate that? So I will give
you a scenario, Mr. Chairman, so
I may be a national board
certified teacher.
I may be receiving a special ed
differential.
Right? Cause I may be national
board.
Serving in special education,
and now we're stacking these
endorsements whether it be
teasel on top of that. So I, I
think that one of the
One of my concerns, Mr.
Chairman, is really not the
program itself. I, I don't, and
actually I, I
I think that we should be doing
this.
But Mr. Chairman, as I have made
comments during the LF or house
appropriations is that we as the
education or the um
As far as the LESC should be
having more conversations.
through the interim as we study
this as we look to identify
programs, how this works in and
make sure.
That without a doubt that we
have the information necessary
and the total cost, and we get
that into the budget under
Committee endorsed legislation.
I think that way it ensures
because as of right now, um, if
this is not in the budget of
House Bill 2 is already kind of
passed out.
Um, if there is changes or this
is added.
It, it could be problematic
somewhere else. So, uh, I thank
you for bringing this forward,
um, and I do support the concept
of it. I think that the, the
challenges that we have in front
of us make it uh kind of
difficult this time. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman
You may I just say something,
uh, something we think about
bilingual education, the person
who is teaching um like I was
teaching in Spanish and I was a
bilingual teacher, but my
students were going to the uh
science class where the teacher
was not teaching in in Spanish,
but they need to they need to
make sure that they meet the
needs of the student and provide
the resources and provide a um
the protocols and all that, all
the supporting the students
needed, um, I could talk to them
in the language that they.
understood, but when they went
to the other classes, they need
those supports because they were
receiving the instruction in a
language that they did.
It was not the first language,
so that's why it is also
important and that's when we
need to, I agree to review the
whole thing of bilingual
programs because I stood many of
the teachers who are providing
services for the students.
Are not being recognized because
they don't they don't teach in
the setting who is easily
identified. I don't know if I,
if I explained this clearly and,
and it's true about the budget,
the, the bill was drafted.
Before the budget was finalized,
so.
That was something that we were
trying to get there. Thank you,
Mr. Chair and Representative.
Yeah, thank you, um, and again,
uh, Mr. Chairman and
Representative Goold, I, I, I
definitely, I see the need for,
and I too want to figure out is
how do we create an opportunity
for more students have access to
that and that more students have
the support of a TSO indoors
teacher because when we talk
about this, it's about access
and I, I, I will sit here and I
will say that that's an
important part of it.
So Mr. Chairman, as I say,
please representative, it's not,
it's not the concept, it's
really about how this fits into
the equation. And just like
we're talking about it, and
we've said through this
committee and through the LEAC
in the interim.
It is, you know, important for
us to tackle some of these very
difficult conversations.
Uh, through the interim so that
we can get information and we
can basically see how it all
fits together. Um,
And that we can get it properly
funded and understand the impact
of
To the SCG and to our state and
permanent funds.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And you represent Roel
Caballero.
Thank you, um, Mr. Charon, thank
you, Representatives.
Um
For bringing this forward.
It's been
Long overdue.
We've been talking about.
The need for bilingual.
Endorsed teachers.
Or
As long as I've been here and
Mr. Chair, I understand it's
been a concern for all the
previous um generations that
preceded me and so I think.
Mr. Chair, I think it's
incumbent on us.
Schools
Public education department.
To take
Action
Um
And an insurer that our students
are receiving.
Not just the adequate education
as called for in Martinez and
Yasi and other.
Uh, determinations around the
state.
And
I came in a little bit late, so
I do wanna ask one clarifying
question before I proceed, but
Did you uh Mr. Chair and
Representative, did you discuss
who's covering the cost.
Because when I came in, the
discussion was mostly around.
costs
And, um, not having the money
and putting this off again.
And going through the processes.
In the meantime that we keep
putting these decisions off.
Our children are not being
served.
In the fullest capacity.
And so my my concern and
question is who does cover the
cost? Did you address that,
Mister Chair?
Mr. She, uh, Madam, uh.
That has been actually a
discussion here, um is um right
now because he's not in the in
the in the.
House Bill 2, it will have to be
absorbed by the, the, the
schools and districts, so that
will take a hit on the, on the
schools uh on the school's
budget, yes. So, thank you, Mr.
Chair and Representative, I kind
of picked that, that up and that
takes me to this point.
And that is that at some point.
Um
The schools and the universities
who prepare our teachers.
Uh, everyone involved.
Um, has to find the way.
To do this, and we've been
saying this.
As I said, for years.
We're not
Institutionalizing.
Our bilingual.
needs in our
Budget preparations.
And so consequently,
It gets deferred to the state.
And then we go back again and
say you need to put this into
the budgets, right? Because we
have a need, we have a gaps to
fill.
And then we come back again to
us. So we're going around in
circles, and what bothers me,
Mister Chair, is again our
children are going through the
school system, they can't afford
to wait.
They are being um left out.
Of receiving.
The highest quality education,
bilingual, multilingual
education that they should be
receiving.
I noticed here that there was a
point made, and I think it's
really important and I think
it's higher.
But the LFC indicated that 19%
of our public school students
have been identified.
Um
As
English learners in 2024.
Whereas the national rate is
10%.
So
That's a significant number, and
where does the responsibility
fall.
In terms of providing this
education.
And it's, it goes back to our
schools.
And it goes back to our
department.
To ensure that um.
That is
That is met, but I would
venture, Mister Chair, to say
that that 19% is probably
higher.
Um,
Because of the way that we're
evaluating. So, I'm
I'm in full support.
Because I believe that we have
to find the way and when we
enact legislation like this, it
sends a strong
Mandate
And I, I do call it a mandate
because we're in the position,
Mr. Chair, of mandating our
schools to turn.
The education around so that our
bilingual students receive not
just the minimum, not just
inadequate.
But an education that's going to
ensure their futures.
And that's not happening, Mr.
Chair. So,
My belief is we enact the
legislation and it sends uh.
A strong message. And that's
what I think has to happen. And
we have to make it work. We have
to find a way. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Represented Sheffield.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I'm thinking that uh to get this
endorsement, you have to take uh
Representative
Uh, Robi Caballero and my and my
test the pueva.
Well.
Um
You know
There's a kind of a process here
that to get
Get something done. Many things
if it's not in the budget, it
just
Dozing
He dies.
This creates policy.
It creates policy in all of our
schools.
And I think it's a very
important thing.
But I don't think it's the only
thing.
So if we create this policy,
It, it dilutes the
SEG by $32.4 million is what my
review here says, so.
Uh, like I say, I think it's a
very important thing. I don't,
but I don't think it's the only
thing, so it just pulls.
Money from from everywhere.
Into
Uh, this
Group.
And I, I think we should.
roll this thing over till
another year.
Get it in the budget.
And get it paid for.
It's, it's a little different
from some things when if you
pass the bill and there's no
money in the budget, it just
dies, this creates school policy
and
And so I thought more wise.
Yeah
Put it in the budget.
Representatives.
Hopefully my voice. Oh.
Doesn't give out.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee.
Um, sponsors bill sponsors.
Thank you, uh, an expert witness
and members of the audience too.
Um, I would like to share a
little bit about why I co-signed
onto this bill.
Um, after it was drafted, I
heard what Representative Gurola
was doing.
And there are many reasons why I
support this bill.
Um, one is that we are looking
at a group of students who are
legally protected.
They are legally protected by
federal law.
To have their needs met.
On language. So English language
learners was a group in the
Martinez lawsuit because they
are a federally protected group.
This is not a class action
lawsuit.
We're simply talking about.
All English language learners in
New Mexico.
It was the Martinez lawsuit that
brought forth the bilingual
Education Act, bilingual
multicultural Education Act, the
Hispanic Education Act, the
Indian Education Act.
And special education.
One of the things we are finding
currently.
Uh, so the lawsuit, the trial
was what was consolidated, not
the lawsuits.
One of the things we found in
the trial.
Was that, um,
There was a shortage, a severe
shortage of bilingual and ELL
teachers.
As you mentioned, uh,
Representative Baca, uh Mr. uh,
Representative Baca getting
confused. I know you're Valencia
County, gentlemen from Valencia
County.
Um
The number of bilingual programs
is drastically decreasing.
The same is happening across the
state.
We had
Add as tense, a model programs
in the Albuquerque Public
schools.
And probably another districts
as well.
That are now the whole school
has decided.
That because of all the other
burdens being placed on
teachers' time.
They did not have the time.
To continue teaching bilingual
education.
This is a problem.
When we're looking at.
Um, even though it's, even
though it wasn't in the Yazi
lawsuit.
There are 2 active lawsuits.
Currently in our courts.
And so when Martinez is asked by
the judge.
Are you satisfied?
With what the state has done
because this is not.
A lawsuit against districts or
boards of education as I
mistakenly said on some old
medication I took last time I
spoke. Sorry about that. This is
a lawsuit against the state.
against the PED.
And the court.
Delegated
The remedies to us.
I wasn't a part of us then.
A delegated those.
Remedies to the legislature.
So the, the ruling came in in
2018.
And here we are
7 years later.
And when people say I don't
understand.
Why nothing has been done about
this lawsuit. This is one piece.
Of the Martinez lawsuit.
And when people give excuses for
it not being in the budget. This
is, this was my concern when I
raised questions about the
budget.
This was one of my concerns.
Where is the money?
Or bilingual multicultural
education.
And what is it going to take
from the courts.
To put it in there.
Because right now we have a
decision and we are not acting.
On that decision, and it's our
responsibility to take that
action.
Currently in the Albuquerque
Public schools unless they
closed it in the last month.
We are still under a consent
decree from the 1990s.
Or English language learners.
How long will it take us to meet
the needs for a sufficient
education, not a glorious,
brilliant, wonderful education
that our kids deserve.
But our judge said we don't even
have a sufficient education.
Or English language learners,
not even sufficient.
What will it take?
For us to get there for these.
At-risk categories.
19%, it has grown a bit since
2010.
Where it was 15%.
19% is a large.
Percentage of our population.
And when we look at where we
are.
In the country
In terms of ranking.
51st.
This year.
And when we look at the needs of
our students at risk are at risk
categories.
And we look back historically.
And what we have done for them.
I want to be proud of the
decisions that we made for our
students. I want to see us
proceed.
In a positive path forward.
Um
Yes
I fully agree that we are going
in circles.
And we've been going in circles
since before the 1990s.
That's why we had the Martinez
lawsuit.
I don't know who is covering the
costs, but right now the school
districts are covering the cost
of teachers.
And the cost of
Whatever it is, the outcomes we
are having with our students.
And so
My question Representative
Gurola.
For you and for the expert.
is what will it take?
Mr. Chair, and Representative,
uh, I, I, I agree with you. I
think um um we need to take this
stand. I mean, like you have
mentioned our students can't
wait one year more to.
For us to find the budget, um.
Uh
Research has shown that the best
way to learn English is through
their home language and our
state has this diversity that is
not accounted on. We are uh
improving in language and
reading, but during the inner
committee, I asked which groups
are improving because our
language learners are not
improving because especially
students are not improving. So
which groups are improving. So
the ones who are improving are
the ones who are.
Always have that, that, that the
hand to improve and the ones who
are getting behind are still
getting behind.
So, um, I, um, I think, um, like
Annie mentioned here this was a
study done.
2 years ago, so we're gonna do
it again and we have data from 5
years ago from LFC to they did
in the in in our committee so we
are going in circles and, and
thank you for letting me present
here knowing that this doesn't
have the budget, but I think we
need to keep talking. Hopefully.
With the support of everybody
and all the committee.
And push a little bit, uh we get
somewhere because our students
are getting behind and we are
gonna end up with students who
are finishing school and know
where the place we want them and
we know they deserve, Mr. Chair.
You represent me.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, thank
you so much for this, um.
I
When this was presented to me, I
definitely, uh, wanted to sign
on to it, uh, because when I
think of um.
My bilingual teachers, um, I
think of my two students that
just came.
Um
I think they, they came last
year, uh, barely speaking any
English, having to take my
physics class.
Um, my English speaking students
struggle in my physics class.
My Spanish speaking students. Oh
my gosh, and I don't speak
Spanish, so, um, so, so I can't
bridge that gap. I do whatever I
can in order to do it, so the
people that have to.
Carry the load
Or not only
The Spanish, they have Spanish
12 and 3, and then they have
their bilingual classes. We have
2 amazing.
bilingual teachers.
But they have to be a physics
teacher.
Because they care about these
students and so many times I
have to
I have to teach them the
concepts that we that we're
doing in there cause they're
like, wait, what are you doing?
And so, and so they can then
help these students and these,
these two boys, they're they're
twin boys, they're not the only
ones. There's, there's a nice
little group and, and as they go
on it, they, they learn more
English, but, but if, if my
English speaking.
Students
We're getting taught in English
are struggling with this.
It is just difficult and which
Right now, the no, the schools
don't.
Provide
Um, material in Spanish, not for
science.
It might in some things.
Um, if, if I could just have my,
my, uh, my textbook in Spanish
and at least give them that.
And then maybe we can go that
would that would be a huge
thing. But there is an issue,
so, so just like I, I, I 100%
believe that um.
Special ed teachers should be
getting paid more because they
they do more. They have an extra
caseload and everything else.
Bilingual teachers are, are, are
pretty much up there with them
because they not only have to
teach their content, they have
to be the schoolwide
translators, they have to be the
school like I mean there is, if,
if you have those teachers, they
are everything to everyone for
these students.
And, and, uh, and I have a quick
question. What does it take, um,
And you may know this, um.
Only because since I don't speak
Spanish, I never looked into
Tsal thing, um, and, and yeah, I
have way enough enough things on
my plate. I'm not even gonna go
there.
Uh, but what does it take to get
a tea sole endorsement.
teacher?
Mr. Chair Representative, um,
Miraval Moya, there are a number
of ways you can get there. Um,
I'll say if you're a beginning
teacher, for example, you need
to complete 24 hours of PED
competencies and 12 hours in
upper division or.
So, um, thank you, um, Mr.
Chair. So this is in addition to
their regular work, and
everybody knows if anyone sat in
the classroom for more than 30
minutes, then you know how much
work we do, but in addition,
I'm, we're, we're doing this to
get this endorsement. Now it's
not as entailed as a board
certified, which that's another
thing that I, that just blows my
mind, never gonna get that, um,
because that just takes too much
effort on my time, but,
but, you know, and, and we pay
that differential for for them
because
They put in the work.
This isn't just something that,
hey, I can speak Spanish.
Give me this.
This is something that you are
putting in the extra time
outside of your classroom
duties.
And getting that in order to
benefit your students and um and
so.
So I 100% believe in this, and
I, I too agree. I, I understand
that um.
I know that there is uh when
things are important enough, um,
they find ways to get them into
the budget. The Senate changes
all kinds of things on the other
side, um, and, uh, a lot of
times they end up lowering the
the raises for teachers, which
makes me bad when it comes back
to us, but yeah, um, but, uh,
but things can happen. It, it
can be done, and, and I agree
with you, it's, it's been kicked
the the can has been kicked down
the road for years.
And, and, and someone needs to
pick it up and do something with
it. Thank you.
Thank you. Um.
quickly because you've already
had your chance, represent
Torres Velasquez.
Um
Just a reminder that our judge
said money is not an excuse.
Thank you.
Or a um
So representrola, um,
On page 5.
Up at the top line 1 and 2,
that this provides a one-time
salary differential.
Did you address that
the understanding and then it
has been a confusion on this
part, uh, one time it was one
time a year.
But, um, and I double check with
the drafter and with some um
experts and but it's also under
us one time and then never get
in again.
So I think that needs to be
clarified definitely because um
yeah.
Yeah, Mr. Chair, that's a great
question. This language, it
looks to like uh looks to me
it's based off of the NBCT, uh,
differential language, which is
the same. It also says one time,
but it is apparently been
interpreted to be one time per
year. So we have statute one
time, but seemingly, I mean,
cause the way it reads to me is
that it's one time and if you're
TSO or bilingual certified, you
get the one-time payment and
that's
It.
Your chair and the language is
copied verbatim from what there
is for NBC.
differentials right now.
OK, um,
That's a little bit concerning
as well now that we go to
nationally board certified, um,
uh, differentials as well. Um.
I guess, um, my next question
was, so this has an estimated
was 30 some million dollars.
Get to the SCG. What would that
mean to school districts in
terms of maybe you don't have
this right away, but in terms of
the budget, we just passed for
the upcoming year. What would
that mean for school district
allocation.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee, um.
It's, it's, it's actually a
pretty complicated answer, I
think, or complicated picture to
get a good answer, honestly, I
think it's important to remember
that a lot of school districts
are already providing a stipend
or differential for both TESOL
certified and bilingual
certified teachers. And it's,
it's hard to know exactly um
which are and which aren't.
So for those that are already
providing some sort of stipend,
this would be a much smaller hit
to their, to their budget
because they're already doing
something, um, obviously if they
weren't paying any kind of
stipend and they would be
required to do so, then they
would have to take that from
there.
And so
When they take from their
existing budget means.
So, Mr. Chair, um,
One more quick clarification I
guess is uh for bilingual
especially, um, school districts
that offer a bilingual
multicultural education program
approved by the department,
they're already generating
bilingual units. And so school
districts across the state
generate about $52 million in
bilingual funding.
Um, in bilingual units already.
So I would imagine, although
this is not a, you know, don't
quote me on this. School
districts are probably using
some of that bilingual money to
pay those bilingual segments
already. So again, it would, it
would depend on the district and
whether or not they have a
bilingual program, uh,
currently, that kind of thing.
In the of
This $52 million I mean, do we
have an accounting of what the
school districts do with that
money, or is it
Going through the SCG and could
end up any different place. Mr.
Chair, uh, so.
Yes, yes and no, probably. So
the department, but again,
bilingual programming is pretty
complicated because it isn't
just one bilingual program.
There are multiple kinds of
bilingual and each of those
different programs are funded at
different levels because of the
requirements associated with
them, the number of hours that
students are supposed to receive
in bilingual instruction, that
kind of thing.
Um
And so part of the department
approves those programs based on
how they apply for that funding,
and so they receive their
funding appropriately according
to the programs that they that
they provide.
And, and, and thank you for that
answer. I mean,
Um
I guess
Part of the larger talk.
And then we've tried to have
that at the beginning of, of our
proceedings here in-house
education is the talk on the
budget, um, and the budget we
just passed, um, out of the
house side, um there is
basically $35 million that has
been taken out of the SCG, um,
because part of the argument
from our finance folks, and I
don't want to call out names or
anything, but the folks that
also sit on asropriations and
finance part of the the logic
behind that is that we
have declining enrollment.
Um, and it's frustrating for me,
um, certainly as, um,
The the sponsor of House Bill
63, um, that the secondary
factor was taken out of um
The budget
And so that was about $50
And so that was about 50 million
dollars-ish, um, for the
secondary factor.
Including the $35 million credit
that was taken on the SCG and so
where we're talking about adding
another
Issue into the SCG we're in this
constant tension where we would
like this.
But there's a potential adverse
impact to funding on school
districts.
If we act in this way because of
what we voted out in
HB 2.
And for me as a legislator and
this is my 11th year and 7
chairing this committee is a
constant.
frustration where we would like
to make a statement because
nobody's denying that this is
very much a need.
Why
We have that tension where we
could put a strain on our
existing school district's
budgets where I'm on a call
every week with school
superintendents from all school
districts that are worried and
concerned about their budget.
This next year.
our finance committees and
especially the issues around the
SEG and what goes into the SCG.
Because if you notice in the
budget, there are large
increases in teacher
compensation, which nobody's
disagreeing that we need.
That is above the line in the
SCG.
But
Very little other places in that
SEG where we saw large increases
is below the line.
Competitive grants that not
every school district may
qualify, they may not want to
qualify for or the hurdles are
just so high, they're unwilling
to go through that process.
And that's what's frustrating.
We debate singular issues.
But when it comes to the
financial portion.
We are caught in this tension
between do we approve something
like this that we very much want
and very much need.
But on the back end.
Puts a stress and a strain on
our school district.
Whereas if we were to
have, say, and substantive input
on that budget.
We could have that more
substantive debate about what
goes above the line in what we
find in not
Straining our school district's
budgets, because I agree that
School districts also have input
and say within their budgets.
But we cannot put them in a
financial.
In financial peril either.
And that's why I point out that
for me, this is the utmost
frustration.
Because I would like to really
go through with this, but it
concerns me that.
If we do this, we put a
financial strain on our school
districts. Um, so that's a
little bit of my, my, my soapbox
speech here, um, that it, it is
a constant frustration, um,
because the needs there. I think
the information is there that if
we could provide stipends in
these areas that we will get
those teachers who are sidelined
on that have bilingual
certification, but
For whatever reason, are
unwilling to to teach in our
bilingual classrooms and I'm
TESOL certified, um, because
I don't know, I took a bunch of
language classes in college.
Um, all over the place and so I
qualify providing those services
because it's very much needed in
my classroom. Actually, I'm
going through the processes now
of improving my academic Spanish
with the goal of becoming
bilingual certified, because
that's the direction our student
and our population is going.
I see it in my classroom over
the past 10 years that there's a
definite need for it, um.
But
Again, um, for me, this is the
utmost frustration that we have
policy that we want tied to
budget.
But there's such misalignment.
That we have
Do we pass policy that we want
and see is necessary, but put
the strain on our school
districts.
It's frustrating. Represent
Baca, I saw you.
Itching for a statement I didn't
know if you want to quickly.
You know, Mr. Chairman, um,
Again, I, I think that.
This, this is absolutely what
needs to be done.
But when we talk about
consistency and we.
Talk about going through the
interim and having the impact.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, on the budget
and where we already have
districts that allows because of
the increase to our health
benefits and our teachers'
salaries and our steps and other
legislations. My fear is that it
would cause
burden
And also Mr. Chairman, um.
Many of these types that are
that are proposed here are
actually part of collective
bargaining.
So I'm gonna tell you that, you
know, a little little little
secret here before I was on the
admin side, I was on the
collective bargaining side for
NEA.
And uh, so, um, my, my fear is
that some of these would also be
impacted the collective
bargaining process, which is
affecting unions and others
would also be affected. So, uh,
Mr. Chairman, um, with that, I
don't know if you're ready to
entertain emotion. I'm not and
you just gave a speech which
disqualifies you from it, but
representrola,
one of the things that I will be
um and I have to be honest here
fear is.
It will impose something like
this to the districts, they are
gonna sacrifice the program even
more.
Because bilingual programs have
been the easy cut.
So when um they have a charter
of budget and what would be the
program that the school will?
So I'm afraid that it so I'm
gonna, I'm, I'm willing to work
if I get the support of the
committee to bring something
more concise next time.
Because I don't want to decrease
the programs because we passed
something that cannot be funded.
I don't know if I'm
Explaining my point. So if we
tell the school now you have to
do this then the school is gonna
say OK then I don't do it.
And it's gonna kill the program
and so you're willing to roll
the bill for now and, and.
Hopefully with the support of
the committee.
Do something that is gonna.
Help, yeah.
Oh
Quickly, if I, I just have a
statement and then we'll get to
two additional comments. Um.
I mean, I appreciate that and I
guess my, my talk is that and
and.
hope for this committee is that
we have something more
substantive in the
Interim in terms of the
budgetary talks because it's
absolutely necessary, and I
appreciate the work that our
folks on HAFC do that are a part
of this committee as well.
But when we're talking about
what programs to move above the
line, what needs to come with
that? It's funding.
But not only that, it's uh a
once we have programming above
what we don't attach.
This idea that we have declining
enrollment as reason to take
money out of
The state equalization guarantee
because then we put a strain on
things. So I saw represent Royal
Caballero and then I'll go
around back again.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. and my
I, I appreciate
Um, the sponsors.
Willingness to continue to work
on this, but I think my position
is where the House Education
Committee.
And as such,
When it comes to uh policies,
Mr. Chair, that we believe.
are
Um, principal.
Our priority.
Or are
Issues and policies that we
believe.
Um, strongly about.
I think it's important for us to
send a message.
And we send a message by
endorsing the legislation.
Understanding all the discussion
that we've had about money.
But money has been and has
representative Torres Velasquez
mentioned.
is is not an excuse, I think
what as an education committee
by passing legislation, we
understand.
That
There's costs and the burden
would be placed, but we're also
assuming that.
It's
It's uh gonna go through the
process. That's an assumption
we're making, and I think that.
The assumption is valid, Mr.
Chair.
Budget is, I mean, appropriation
bill has passed.
Um, we understand this is gonna
take money, but I think we have
an obligation to send a strong
message. Anyway, as to how
education when we pass
legislation like this. So
that's, that's my ultimate
position on this, I think we
should move forward.
resumed in one way.
Well, thank you, Mr. Chair, and,
and I just wanted to express my
frustrations, especially finding
out or, um, you know, knowing
that, um,
Even though we properly vetted
like the SAG and and the
secondary increase and and um
and I even.
Argued with with some people in
the very beginning of when, when
I didn't see it in their budget
in the LFC budget and, and it
was in the other two budgets,
and, and why and and and this
guy and that was committee
endorsed in legislation, but it
seems like sometimes we're
talking to the wall.
Because if they don't feel it's
important, even though the
educators that are in the
education system. I think it's
important, then it's not gonna
happen. And so where does that
Where do they trust our judgment
and and that's my question, and
maybe it just needs to be put
out there because I'm, I'm, I'm
getting frustrated with when
something needs to be cut
because I guarantee I can almost
guarantee you it's gonna be a
different thing with education
funding when it comes back from
the Senate, just because it is
every year.
And uh, so, um, and, and if it
and if it's something if, if,
uh, you know, we have, I think
something to study beavers, we
can take those things out, um,
and, and, and put it towards our
kids, sorry, like it's, it's um,
but when, when, I mean, and I
don't want to pick on uh uh LSC
guys, cause you're the only one
left in here, Chapel,
but, but, uh, all the rest of
them bailed on you, um, but,
but, uh, but no, that's, that's
where it's frustrating. It
really is because the ones uh.
Even with that SEG it was
committee endorsed, it was
vetted, it was, we talked about
it for a long time. It was
something that we wanted forever
and it was still not included
because they didn't think it was
important and that's
frustrating.
Jeffrey.
Thank you, Mr. Cha.
Uh, you know, I'm very honored
to serve on the probes and LFC.
And uh since I've
Billyle since the day I came, my
7th year, we've increased the
Overall budget to education by
60%.
60%.
Uh, we've gone from almost last
to dead last.
And I, and I don't like that.
I invite you.
Come and talk to me, Mr. Chair.
Uh, I don't control the process,
you know that, uh, we have staff
that's riding with, there's
what, 25 of us on just approach
and a good number of us on LFC,
but I invite you to come talk to
me. If we're not putting the
money in the right place, like I
say, the 60% increase.
Apparently we're missing the
The
The boat someplace
Of where to put it and uh I'm
not an educator.
Uh, I do, I do several other
things, but that's not something
that I do.
And I invite you, I invite.
Each one of you in here.
Come talk to me, and I'll push,
I'll push for.
For a little better choices than
me and I can win, means, uh, but
I, I do promise you I will try
to, try to help get it.
Get it right. Get it in the
right place and.
And uh
Uh, you know, I'm honored to be
able to
To do that
So
Hopefully we can, we can work
together and get it right. Thank
you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate
that and we do have
An LESC budget where we had
money in certain places, which
is where that discussion is
because that's done in the
interim, so our position was
there represent Dores Velasquez.
Um, I, I'm excited to be, uh,
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, I'm excited to be on
this, on this committee, um, uh,
just to reminder that primarily
the Martinez lawsuit is a school
finance lawsuit. And so it
disturbs me to hear how
districts are still suffering,
and I don't know what it's gonna
take to address those needs, um,
but I look forward to working
with this committee and finding
solutions.
Thank you and and that's a lot
of the work through our
legislative education study
committee and especially talk
around the SCG because then we
get into these sorts of tensions
that are difficult because I
understand represent Rogo
Caballero in wanting to send
that statement, but remember,
it's two pronged. We send a
statement about a particular
issue, but we also
extend a statement that uh we
are willing to put financial
strains on our school districts
as well. And it's, it's
Frustrating and a frustrating
tension, I think to put
Um
Us and all of us into, but
represent Corona, I will.
What say you in the fate of your
bill since it's your
legislation.
I really want, uh, Mr. Chair, I,
I appreciate the support from
everyone. I think we all
understand that this is not just
a commodity. This is a need for
our students for uh.
For our state, um, and if I can
ask probably most of you could
say that.
You are heritage languages and
your language was lost because
it was not value. So this is
something that I think needs to
stop at one point because that's
that's our state and in our
constitution we are a diverse
state with two languages with
all native languages, so if the
committee is.
Working with us like we have,
um, hopefully we are not gonna
go to another inner committee
having a beautiful study with
all the data and with no
legislation coming out, so, uh,
let's work and hopefully we get
and I have a couple of sponsors
here and I would like to hear
this way. OK, thank you.
Alright, so we'll roll House
Bill 200 certainly appreciate
that and the robust discussion
around it. What's that?
Oh, I'm sorry. You could, you
could be, you're subtle in your
approach, Representative Cullen.
Oh, I'm sorry. You could, you
could be, you're subtle in your
approach, Representative Collin.
So represent Colin, please.
So
thank you, and I'm glad that you
rolled it, but I, I will tell
you.
Where your Rancho is already
fighting too because we're $22
million short because of changes
and that we implemented some
programs early on and I've been
fighting for them.
In the beginning of this time,
and I will continue to fight for
them. I voted for HB too.
Because of education that's in
there and that we need to find
certain product, you know, we
have to fund these.
There's a ton of special
projects that I see in the
budget that I think be go away
and put towards education
because an agreement with the
Yazi Martinez lawsuit, we were
part of that lawsuit. We need to
be really looking at that and
how we're changing education.
And we need to make our
priorities as a legislature for
that.
Um, so, again, um, I think
It's something that in the
interim, I think we can work on
it and uh see how we.
And I appreciate that. And the
last thing I'll say about it is
how much money is going toward
the reserves.
As well, because
We're putting that for the
future, but the best investments
we can make.
Also are right here for
Our students and our children,
um.
As well. So that's another
investment that we could,
anyway.
Representative House Bill 251 I
believe is next.
Rivers in Hall.
You are up.
To, as they say in German.
Right.
I will, before we get started
though, sorry, representative.
Um, I do want to recognize.
That we have my former
Government, economics teacher,
Joel Fowzer joining us today. So
welcome Mr. Frazer. It's good to
see you again, as always.
Welcome to House Education.
All right, Ison Hall for real
this time, please.
Good Morning, Mr. Chair,
committee. Uh, I'm here to bring
forward a House Bill 251
relating to educational
retirement.
Providing additional options to
change the beneficiary for
retired members who have
designated a spouse as a
beneficiary. I also have today
an expert witness. He's the
deputy general counsel Jacob
Mall.
Uh, the ERB and this bill, uh, I
didn't realize it till this last
year, but
PERA has allowed a change of a
beneficiary.
For years and years and years,
whereas ERB didn't.
And that's what this addresses.
Uh, there is no financial impact
to this and
We stand for questions.
Right, could you identify your
expert again for us, please.
Yes, sir. Sorry, Mr. Chair.
Jacob Mall, he's the deputy
general counsel for the
educational retirement Board.
All right, thank you.
So we'll go to our folks on
Zoom. If you're here in support
of House Bill 251, if you would
indicate by raising your hand,
please.
With that populate folks in the
room, if you're here in support
of House Bill 251, would you
please indicate by raising your
hand.
All right, if you wish to speak.
OK.
Oh.
We don't have anybody. So we'll
go to opposition. Opposition to
House Bill 251, if you please
indicate by raising your hand on
Zoom, please.
folks in the audience, any
opposition to House 251, uh, you
all aren't particularly popular
today apparently. OK.
We'll come back to committee
then. Committee questions.
OK, Represent Royal Caviero,
thank you, yeah.
uh
Move a Du pass
or I mean I'd like to move a Du
OK, we have a due pass 21.
A second, oh OK, fighting over
it represent Mirra Moya.
OK, represents Vlada. Is that a
question? Oh, OK, it's not a
motion. OK, la.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Thank you, our
representative for bringing this
forward. Quick question.
So I'm assuming that when we,
when you remove one beneficiary,
add another one, it's a person.
So
The, the beneficiary that you're
adding, and I don't know, please
forgive me, I don't, I don't
know this because I
automatically put my wife as a
beneficiary.
I, uh
does it have to be a person, the
other beneficiary?
Can it be an entity? Can it be
an organization and it'd be
something else besides a person?
Uh, Mr. Chair, Representative
Lata, it does not have to be a
person, it can also be, uh, such
a thing as like a special needs
trust, uh, that's created. So
there are options, uh, what this
does is it allows somebody who
has their spouse as a
beneficiary to change that to
something else. So another
person or potentially like a
special needs trust.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. T.
OK. Any other, did that inspire
anybody?
OK, no. So we have a do pass
motion by Caviero second by
representing Miro A Moya, uh, is
there any opposition to the Du
pass motion.
See none.
You have a due pass on House
251. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair, committee, have a good

committee subdistributed,

Mr.

discuss the committee's seconded
by Representative Roel
Caballero, in the opposition?
None. We got a committee sub.
All right. So give us a moment
while everybody gets a copy of
the committee sub and then you
can explain it for us.
All right, so we all have a
copy. Oh, Representative
Herndon, if you could please let
us know about the committee.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee, when we were
last here, there was uh a great
deal of conversation about uh
making sure that there were some
more specifics put in the bill,
um.
Mr. Chair, um, members of the
committee, Representative
Chatville, I know this was
something that was very
important to you. So uh with
that, I'm gonna have my expert
introduce himself and go through
some more details about the
changes that we've made in, in
accordance with our conversation
the last time.
Uh
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, my, my name is Mahesh
Sita with the American Heart
Association.
So the, the changes to to the
bill is, you know, implementing
a cardiac emergency response
plan and this is, this is not a
a mandate for every school
teacher to be trained in CPR,
the schools have the discretion
to.
You know, implement their own
plans using existing, you know,
safety or medical teams, school
teachers or like, you know,
administrators, school nurses,
so it doesn't, it gives a lot
of.
You know leaveage to, to, uh,
flexible I should say to schools
to implement this and then the
serps are pretty simple, like,
you know.
Having, you know, uh, AEDs in
proper place, you know, what to
do when when there's a certain
cardiac arrest.
And the implementation is like,
you know, the first year it
applies only to all high schools
and in the following year all
all schools including charter
schools, middle schools.
Thank you Mr. Chair. All right,
so discussion, folks on the
committee sub, so we've already
gone to public comment and done
all that. So we come directly to
committee.
Questions committee.
It looks so studious.
I'm calling, please.
chair.
I have a question in reference
to um this is an unfunded net.
For the, for the moment, um, I
I'm not quite sure I can answer
that affirmatively that it's an
unfunded mandate because there
is money available in school
budgets, but I will be also
talking to the Senate to make
sure that it's a very clear in
terms of money that would be
available to make sure that
these defibrillators are
available, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative Cullen.
Um, because serving on a school
board, we would get a ton of fun
unfunded mandates, and we would
always have to switch from
operational funds to be able to
cover these, and that was always
kind of a concern for us, and
that's a concern for me
particularly. I'm all for having
defibrillators in schools.
The chair, um, and quite a few
years ago we had a friend that
his son died playing basketball.
He certainly support this, but
um funding is always the problem
that I have because we
continuously do unfended mandate
and unequ support it for our
schools.
Uh, thank you. Thank you for
those comments and I, um, Mr.
Chair, members of the committee,
Representative Cullen, I fully,
I fully agree with you. The
other thing that we looked at
very carefully, there was some
reversions at the higher level
of PED and where was that money
then left and how could it have
been reallocated. So if you
will um bear with us, we are not
looking to put an unfunded
band-aid, um, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee representing
Cohen on any school, and I know
in rural schools it's really
an issue in terms of funding,
but it's also an issue in terms
of safety. So I just want you to
know we, this is something that
we're paying close attention to.
Um, yeah, so I'm fully
supportive of it, but that was
where I was had to hang up
because um.
Painted over the years, and our,
our district already has them,
so we've already.
And APS is.
Representable Bakavea.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and just
real quickly, it occurs to me.
Um
Based on Representative Cullen's
comments, and I appreciate that
Rio Rancho is taking being
proactive needed.
However, I think our school
districts and um our
communities.
Need to or should or.
I hope
Um, begin partnering um with
our.
With our private sector and
adopt a school.
Or adopt a district concept
whereby, for example, the Heart
Association, um, makes
contributions by adopting the
district, right? Or poorest
district or other associations
that are health related in in
this in this particular case,
but it can also help Mr. Chair,
our districts along other issues
as well, and it's a concept that
we incorporated in the
communities that I was
organizing before.
Coming
And um as a legislator and it
worked beautifully. It was a
great partnership.
And as it continued to grow, I
mean, as as one began, it was
like a ripple effect. We had
more businesses and community um
associations asking.
To adopt.
school or a district. So for the
year or for 2 years and make
that commitment, but anyway,
that's a suggestion that would
help make.
These, um,
Less of a mandate.
And help find a way to um.
Fill the gap in funding. Thank
you, Mr. Chair, was just a
suggestion.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
um.
What are the major changes
between the original bill and
the committee sub.
There uh members of the
committee representative uh
Moya, I'll let my
Expert explained it and I'm here
for, uh, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative Moya, I think the
major changes is like
implementing the uh cardiac
emergency response plan uh for
all schools, I think the the
first year of the implementation
is.
Only high schools and and the
following year would be middle
schools, elementary and charter
schools.
OK, thank you, um, Mr. Chair.
So, um, I know when we were when
we talked about this last
several of us, especially those
that that I mean uh think
Representative Baca, um, he
actually works, he's the head of
safety for his district and
stuff like that. It was
suggested that we put in there
that um the um
To implement an emergency
response plan within the
school's current safety plan,
not another plan on top of that.
Um, why wasn't that?
Uh, done.
Uh
Mr. Chair, uh, Representative
Moya, I think, you know, if, if
you uh section 3.
Uh, from line 5.
You know
It says each school shall
develop and implement a cardiac
response plan that addresses the
appropriate use of school
personnel. So according to the
legal drafters, you know, that
covers the flexibility, you
know, they can use the existing,
you know, uh, so that, that
encompasses that flexibility for
schools.
OK, um, thank you very much.
Is calling for a 2nd time,
please be brief. Thank you.
um, I, I just like to kind of
respond to something.
Um
It's, so we did that, I had um.
But naloxone in our schools
before other schools have them
we did partner.
With other organizations to
cover those naloxone.
So, um, yeah, so that I think
that's in the community.
Yeah. Great. Thank you,
Representative Lara.
Ah, so we don't need to adopt
the committee sub. We're gonna
move it. Remember the
appropriate motion is
Yeah, remove a do not pass on
House Bill 54, but they do pass
on us education committees, so
I'll leave it to you, Mr. Chairs
representative Lara not pass on
the house, uh, house built.
54 and a do pass on house
Education Committee substitute
for Hospital 54. All right, so
we have a do not pass on House
Bill 54, but it do pass on house
education committees for House
Bill 54. Do I have a second?
Taking by representatives
Velasquez, uh, Madam Secretary,
if you call a role on a do do
not pass, but I do pass.
Representative Gonzalez.
Representative Guola.
Representative ladder.
Yes.
Representative
Murbal Moya.
Yes
Representative Robo.
Caballero, yes.
Representative Collins.

All right, so we have an
explanation. Resume column,
please.
Sure, um, the
I voted yes just as long as we
don't create a.
Thank you.
So I have 820 or
You have a due pass on.
Committee for House Bill 54.
Thank you Mr. Chair and members
of the committee.
All right, Pur and Ferrari.
Give it a moment, switch gears
here.
I'll spill 375, so please
represent Ferrari.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
It's so nice to be
For education, my.
Days with interim committee with
education was always so exciting
and I miss it.
But with that, um.
Um, House Bill 375 is um
intended to incentivize the
licensing of more behavioral
health professionals in New
Mexico and to serve um as
psychologists, psychiatric
nurses, nurse practitioners,
physician assistants, um, and
for addiction medicine and
social workers. And because
we're investing so much right
now in behavioral health.
We recognize how that impacts
our families are, you know,
workers, um, it is so important
that we also develop the
workforce, um, to help provide
um behavioral.
He
And um this, the purpose of this
bill 375 is created a graduate
behavioral health, uh,
scholarship fund for the purpose
of providing debt free
scholarships to those who enter
a graduate behavioral health uh
degree program and um it
appropriates $10 million to, um.
Higher ed uh department to
create and administer the fund.
And um it it's covering all
related costs including um
tuition, materials, licensing
fees for each year covered by
the scholarship, and it also
provides scholarship support.
For as many years as the
students commit to practice in
New Mexico. So there is a 1 to 1
ratio, you get free scholarship,
you get one year to serve um New
Mexico.
And um they're also to make it
so it's not so easy for someone
just to leave, there's a penalty
up to 3 times the value of their
scholarship for those who
default on the contract
obligation, um.
To practice in New Mexico for
not practicing, so I would like
to introduce um my expert, um,
Miss Connie Bhill, who's um,
also been a driver.
Uh, in this, in getting this
scholar. Thank you so much. um,
he brought this bill in Senate
Health, and it got pre-approval
in the, in the pre-session.
The letter that I wrote gives
you an idea of the work that
went into the background and not
say enough about Representative
Ferrari, who's been a
Really her committee and the
health and I want to also
represent the uh thank and
acknowledged uh representative
Jones, Kate.
And Chavis as well as Senator
Linda Lopez, they're all
co-sponsors to keep it brief, I
will just go over the data real
briefly, but this is without a
doubt, the most important bill
in this if we hope to support
the 3 bills that are going out,
SB 1, the trust fund bill for
Billing Door SB 2 and SB3 will
build the proposals that we need
to build a system of care that
we've so badly been needing.
But if we don't have the
workforce and we don't start now
and make the investment in our
colleges, our universities, and
our students, giving them
debt-free education, and all the
support they need to be
successful, then we'll be cut
short. Right now, the DOH and be
nurses.
As you know, this is a crisis
across New Mexico, not only in
the criminal justice system, but
across the board for families
and communities.
Um, if I could say anything, I
guess we did not add the degree
program from NMSU which I think
could be an amendment. They have
a program for masters in family
counseling. So as you look on
your letter has regard to HB
375. We'll have a second bill
coming out, and now it will be
397. Uh, that has appropriation
in HB 2.
That's a $3 million stipend bill
in behavioral health we're
asking for 2 million, and you'll
probably see that bill down the
road.
But as far as who was contacted,
um, I have been working with
Center Ferrari for at least 6
years on these issues and I
recognize that we have been
having talks with UNM um Medical
school, Doctor Youngren has a
PhD forensic psychology. I spoke
to Doctor Alexa Doig of UN NMSU
nursing and mental health.
Gina, you're a sound of all as a
chief of staff at UNIH and
they'll be starting a school of
social work coming up the
psychology PhD which goes into a
postdoc.
The importance of that program
is that those PhDs justice
system, and they already are.
The forensic program directly
leads into a job with the
district attorney's office in
Albuquerque right now.
The, the load of the behavioral
health people in the court
system, such as the DA's, it's
huge as well.
I also spoke to Dean Nelson from
Highlands University School of
Social Work, um, eastern New
Mexico will soon be starting a
master's degree in social work.
And I want to acknowledge Santa
Fe Community College, um, as a
student, I've gone to 5 schools
in New Mexico and Santa Fe
Community College has a fine,
um, mental health counseling,
which could be really key to
even a nurse with dealing with
her, with her clients, so.
So with that said, I just also
brought some costs because the
cost of as far as I'm concerned,
I brought you tuition and fees
from the UNM uh tuition, um.
From their main campus, um, and
also and uh the last one I Let's
see, you and I'm sorry.
Uh the crowd's point of view.
On the backside, typically
you'll see a two-year program
but he finishes their master's
in 2 years. On the PhD level, it
could be as much as 4 years, so
you're looking at 27,000 up to
28,000 times 4.
That's a pretty big sizable
chunk.
The FIR refers to the fact that
we do have a loan forgiveness
program, but
Who of us in this room wants to
be educated with the big debt
following us.
And if we can get our students
out, give them the support they
need right up front as an
investor. The key points I want
to bring out.
is we need to.
Train and retain.
As I was just speaking to
representative Ferrari, many of
my friends from New Mexico Tech
went to medical school. I was a
grad student at the medical
school. I couldn't wait to
leave.
The only thing that held me was
really the fellowship from New
Mexico. I got a full fellowship
that kept me here.
I have got worked at a 5 other
medical schools and in New
Mexico can take you a long way,
but right now, we need to try to
keep those students here at
home. We need to try to support
them in every possible way, and
I also want to bring attention
to, I think I gave you the
handout. We have a very current
program at UNM Medical School.
It's been in place. You may ask,
well, how can we hold those
students accountable. They do
get their scholarships, etc. How
do we keep?
Well, UNM has come up with a
very good application process.
In fact, I wish that all of our
do exactly like the, the BAMD
program at UNM. What it does is
it takes students from the
undergrad level. It gives him
full support housing, tuition,
books, tutoring, because
remember those do have to take
the really tough MCAT test,
which is very expensive. So UNM
is helping those students to get
into our medical school here.
In every way possible, and they
only have 28 slots right now.
So,
They do have funding through the
legislature for this program.
We're definitely, and I would
appreciate the fact that Senator
Ortiz could not be with us
today, but he's with us in
spirit and wanted to testify
cause this was originally his.
So with that. Thank you so much.
So we will go to our folks on
Zoom if you wish to speak in
support of House Bill 375. Would
you please indicate by raising
your hand.
Well the populate folks in the
room. Is there anybody here that
wishes to speak on the House
bill in favor of, so if you
would please stand behind your
presenters, you'll have 2
minutes, please.
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Troy Clark from the Mexico
Hospital Association
representing 47 hospitals
throughout our state, uh, we
appreciate the sponsor bringing
this bill forward, it is not uh
unnoticed by anyone in our state
that we have a shortage of
providers and efforts to address
our access issues, uh, such as
this are appreciated by the
health community. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members
of the committee, my name's Luke
Otero, representing the city of
Hobbs, New Mexico.
This legislature has made in.
incredible investment in
behavior health with the child.
Educating and providing the
healthcare providers to.
Services
It's gonna be essential for its
success.
The city of Hobbs has been
instrumental to be behind us
from day one, we continue to,
we'll see it through and
anything we can do to support.
We will be there. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Anybody else? Please,
you have up to 2 minutes.
Um, my name is Lorena Valencia.
Um, I'm a graduate from Eastern
New Mexico University, and I'm
currently enrolled in the
masters at NMSU. Um, I'm very
happy to be here and I see some
familiar faces and I really
appreciate any support and um
the work that you're doing here
impacts students like myself and
hopefully further generations.
And I want to thank you for
that.
Great. Thank you. All right, so
we'll go to our folks on Zoom
that wish to speak in sports. So
Tom.
Morning, Tom, you have up to 2
minutes. Welcome.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and
team members of the committee.
I'm Tom Chesney, president of
Southwestern College right here
in Santa Fe may seem a little
paradoxical to have a private
institutions president speak in
favor of this, but there are at
least 5 reasons that we speak
with one voice and strongly for
House Bill 375. 1st, workforce
pipeline development, increasing
the number of trained
professionals entering the field
is absolutely essential. We
graduate dozens of master's
prepared.
Counselors and therapists every
year we would like to see more
of them stay right here in state
and would encourage pathways
with our other public
institutions to do so. Second,
this will elevate public
awareness of demand,
highlighting the behavioral
health careers, reducing
financial barriers for many
students, one of whom you just
heard from. Third, industry-wide
benefits leading to more
graduates staying in New Mexico,
increased demand for continuing
education certification and
additional advanced training and
degrees offered by colleges you
mentioned, including my own. And
potential for future expansion.
Hearing in New Mexico private
college support this bill,
legislatures might and a few,
uh, in a future session,
consider us as allies and
partners and create carveouts
and opportunities to support the
dozens of students that we have
over 300 currently enrolled in
behavioral health, master's
degree prepared programs right
here in Santa Fe and our Tierra
Nueva, uh, counseling center
serving 500 Santa Feans without
a waiting list of over 100.
This will strengthen
partnerships. This bill is
indeed one of the most important
in the House. I wish I could be
there with you right now, but I
have to get to my own cabinet
meeting. Thank you.
All right. Thank you.
All right, Enrique, good
morning. You have up to 2
minutes, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good
morning, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee, um, Enriqueel
speaking today on behalf of the
Greater Albuquerque Chamber of
Commerce in support of House
Bill 375. The chamber has
advocated this entire session
for policies, programs, and
investments that helped make New
Mexico more competitive with our
surrounding states. House Bill
375 is an important component of
getting us there. Uh, this
proposal is a strong effort to
train more behavioral health
professionals by paying
stipends.
For their tuition. But then
following up by keeping them in
our state, serving New Mexicans.
Senate bills 12, and 3 was a
very bipartisan effort to start
rebuilding our behavioral health
system. House Bill 375 is
another building block on top of
that foundation. Thank you. We
do ask for a do pass on House
Bill 375.
Thank you.
All right. So I don't have
anybody else on the list in
sport, do I have opposition on
Zoom to House Bill 375.
they'll populate, you have
opposition in the room for House
Bill 375.
Right, don't have any.
We'll come to committee of which
I don't have any except
represent Lara.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
presenter for bringing this
forward. I just have a couple of
questions.
So, um
Um
Bills, there, there's an ask for
$10 million for the fund for the
scholarship fund.
I'm, and my question is, how
many people, how many students
are participating or would be
eligible for this.
Cause I'm concerned about the
sustainability of the of of the
Of the, of the scholarship.
Uh
Mr. Chair and Representative,
um, with the uh amounts that are
estimated at $27,000 a year per
student if we just took that
down to 25 and multiplied that
that would.
You know, uh, not go really far,
but uh the multiplication, about
100 if you would go through the
chair please for your
commentary.
Thank you, Chair. With that
said, um, yes, rep Laura, uh, I,
I appreciate that question right
now, uh, all of these programs,
Eastern New Mexico is about to
start a master's in social work.
UNim is about to start a social
program, um, you know, and.
As far as the numbers go, you
can look on the FIR. The FIR,
uh, basically said how many
careers there are within the
colleges for behavioral health.
There's a lot. As far as the
number of students, there's way
too few students and part of
what this bill will do is give
the college's student
representation, in other words,
we have a bachelor's degree at
New Mexico Tech and Psychology,
but it ends right there.
But Animus, you down the road
has a master's in with this
fund, NMS keeping them in New
Mexico, bringing them to another
program.
I also would like to acknowledge
UNM's don't currently have a
master's, but they do have a PhD
program. So again, there could
be a lot more cross up the
incentives and bring awareness
to the dire need and help
support those students so they
go out debt-free.
So to answer your question, do I
have the solid numbers? No, I'm
sorry, I don't. I, and in my
humble estimation, uh, I'm
seeing maybe 10 graduates,
maybe.
Nurse practitioner program and
uh nursing program at very the
numbers are way too low. In
other words, but this will be a
non-rever and I want to also say
it opens it up to out of state
students, you may say, NMSU is a
board or college, they can pick
up students from UTEP.
Also
Taus could pick up student
students in taxes, bringing them
recruiting people at Lane,
Sandia, Intel.
So if we give the right
incentives, we can system in New
Mexico for behavior.
Thank you. I'm still concerned
over the sus the sustainability
of the scholarship.
Uh, one of the, one of the
things that came up that was um
someone who in during public
comment.
I had mentioned a private
universe.
So we have, we have information
here, Mr. Chair, Representative
about our state colleges.
Uh, but our public colleges.
But we, you know, with this
apply to students in private
colleges as well.
Mr.
Um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, I don't think we
have any behavioral health
private colleges here in New
Mexico, Burrell College is
osteo.
ath ic not behavioral health.
Thank you for that
representative. So the, the
gentleman who spoke.
Earlier during public comment.
Had mentioned that they have.
Quite a few students
That, uh
That would, that would benefit
from something like this, and
I'm wondering if
You know, I, I just really wanna
know if this is gonna be
available to, to all students
because Mr. Chair, I remember we
had a discussion about this.
A couple of years ago, but
regarding uh.
Well, uh, students who are going
through medical programs.
And the scholarship applied to
students at UNM but didn't
necessarily apply to students at
Burrell.
And so I'm wondering if this
would be the same thing, Mr.
Chair.
If I could help out with that if
you look on page
eligible institution means a
graduate degree granting of
higher education that is
enumerated to section 11 of the
Constitution, so it needs to be
in New Mexico State
Constitution.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I, I appreciate that and uh I
was just curious because, uh,
you know, it just
These things pop into my head,
these questions pop into my
head, and I just wanna make sure
that that it when and if
When if we establish this.
That once again that is
sustainable.
And that we can have something
going for, for many, many years
because I, the way, the way I
anticipate this is the it'll be
10 million.
This year, it'll be another 10
million ask next year.
And, and I, I'm good with that.
I just want to know, you know, I
just, I just wanna make sure.
That the students who do
participate in this, not only
stay in it, and I appreciate
your example that you gave, Mr.
Chair, about uh students coming
from other states, very familiar
with NMSU and and the students
come from Texas.
But uh I just
want to make sure that if we do
invest in this, that, that we do
have the maximum amount of
students that participate.
And that they are fully
committed to providing these
services in Mexico.
Thank you.
you
Um, I
I just want to make a comment.
Uh,
Yeah, I agree, we want to see it
maximize possible. I've seen
over many years when we
implement scholarship programs,
it seems like the universities
all of a sudden start raising
the rates right around that same
time.
Um, but, uh,
my, my question is, is I've been
looking at this, you know, we're
looking at this also with
medical students as well and I'm
looking at and expand the BAMD
program.
But um
My question is, is would there
be preference given to New
Mexico residents.
In state tuitions less, less we
know they're already here.
And we hope they stay here
because of the brain drain and
Representative Cullen,
um, this would be, um, a program
that's set up under um higher
education department and they
will do the rulemaking and um
most likely set something like
that.
Represent care.
Thank you Mr. Chair. Thanks for
bringing this bill. We know
there's a great need.
Um.
Several of it.
And
As you may or may not know, um,
our chairs policy here is to
send bills that just so you know
that.
But my question is, have you
talked to appropriations.
About whether this money for the
scholarship.
I identified as a use of the
moneys being.
Allocated for behavior health.
And House Bill 2.
Mr. Chair and uh representative,
the stipend bill is in HB 2.
This funding is not included,
but um, as far as your question
to whether the behavioral health
funding could do it, um, we are
hoping that it is because there
is so much funding, and then we
also um hope that um.
As we are looking to uh our
workforce that, you know, this
would be recognized as a need.
And we also are talking to the
Senate that.
Maybe they can help, uh.
Put it into their side.
Thank you, um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, so House Bill
397 is the behavior health
student stipends.
Uh, which can go to graduate or
undergraduate students, has that
bill been heard yet?
No, Mr. Chair and
Representative, it has not come
through this committee.
Because of the numerical it was
dropped a little bit later, so
it's a little bit higher.
OK, because um.
It's a different Mr. Chair
representative, it's just
different because it includes
undergraduate.
It, it's just a different bill,
so yes, we will hear it in here.
Um, it's sort of language, Mr.
Chair.
In House Bill 2.
I'm sorry, representative, uh,
Chairman Romero and
Representative Garrett, could
you rephrase that question,
please. So,
Mr. Chair, in the budget,
they'll have a line item and say
2 million.
Is for behavior health stipends
contingent on if House bills 397
passes or something.
Any language
So that we know that money is
for that bill.
Um, yes, Representative, thank
you for that question. No, but
the difference between, um, the
representative from Tassville
and ours is that we recognize we
have two very large scholars. So
we did not feel it was needed.
Um, we chose to focus on the
graduate level because those are
the ones that are going to get
licensure that can provide
immediate care diagnosis, but to
answer your question, um,
There's no specificity, but
we're very happy that 3 million
was appropriated and this we're
asking for 2 at this point.
Ultimately, as I recognize
representative ultimately,
personally, I would like to see
a behavioral trust fund bill
come out at some point so that
we have a permanent fund for
this, but at this point and this
legislature, this was a bill
that Senator Ortiz Pino brought
forward and so we just followed
through on it. So thank you for
that question.
Uh, thank you. So, Mr. Chair,
um,
My only other question is that
it calls for higher education.
To make.
The rules, but there's also a
lot of rules in.
In it
Um
So that that was a question I
had and but the real question I
have is when you require people
to serve time.
This says that they'll have a
contract with higher education
department.
To serve that time.
With higher education department
then be required to make sure.
That they follow through on that
commitment.
Mr. Chair and uh Representative
Garrett, um, yes.
Uh, thank you.
Um
OK, so Mr. Turn representative,
the, the budget director says
that that financial aid as you
remarked, would be applicable to
either bill, so there is 3
million there.
That would be uh could be
applied to. Uh and Mr. T, that's
all my comments and questions.
All right, that answers the
appropriation question.
All right, Representative
Gonzalez here next.
Um, thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you, Representative, thank you,
expert, um, as a representative
in Las Vegas with the State BHI
I can tell you that this is
absolutely needed. Um, I think
we definitely have a need for
these professionals in our
state, um, I do have some
questions though with um.
And I apologize. I came in a
little, I missed the first start
of your presentation.
But just about
Taking our talent, putting our
dollars to keep them here in the
state of New Mexico. How do you
see this impacting residencies?
Do we have enough residents,
like as far as the residency
pipeline, is there enough here
in the state that we would
capture those students coming
in. Is there any sort of tie in
to where they have to fulfill
those requirements to then do
the active service to remain
here in the state of New Mexico,
um, or, as you mentioned, I was
already asked about the out of
state students trying, you know,
trying to attract them. Um, is
there any sort of
correlation or requirement to
fulfill those residency
requirements.
In state, um, and how that
translates into leading into
full-time employment.
chair and represent.
Uh, Mr. Chairman Romero and uh
Representative Gonzalez, yes, as
you well know, BHI in Las Vegas
is hiring traveling nurses. Um,
to answer your question about
how we retain the students.
Um, honestly, I don't really
foresee it as a major problem. I
think first and foremost, the
students applying to our New
Mexico universities.
Are probably predominantly local
already.
Um, but this pill as opposed and
I wanna go back to
Representative Garrett's comment
about HP support this bill, the
stipend bill is very different.
The scholarship bill in its HD.
They can stop at the masters,
but as you know, there's, if you
look at the licensing and I'll
just go back, licensing in New
Mexico allows aroized, so there
are several degree programs
within our colleges already that
would support a master's degree
program being able to uh
Diagno
As far as the students and who's
gonna get into the program,
who's not.
I think already, uh, the
students in New Mexico are gonna
buy attrition being given uh
priority, but this bill is only
purposefully done so that as I
talked to the College of Nursing
in Las Cruces because they have
UTAP. What if they can bring
those students over and
honestly, people love living in
New Mexico. I mean, if we
provide the incentives for the
colleges to bring students, keep
them out of debt.
And help them get jobs like the
BAMD program has been doing very
successfully, and I don't think
we have to fear.
You know, any discussion of
those students not. Thank you.
And, um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, um, the, I think
your question was about
residencies in New Mexico, and
yes, especially in our rural
areas, um, and, uh, there are
programs where they support.
Um, the different, um, hospitals
or clinics, um, to have
residencies and that might be
something that we might need to.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. um, thank
you for that answer. Um, I would
like to see an emphasis on again
is, um, studies in all fields
where, where you do your
residency is often likely where
you want to end up and so, um,
you know, keeping them local, I
think would be a preference
there, um, also just because,
and this is maybe up to higher
ed to to make the rules once and
if this goes through, but um,
because you are.
Giving the scholarship to
possibly out of state to
possibly, you know, other
institutions, rates vary.
Would there be any sort of cap
that has been thought of or be
placed on per student per.
Her lifetime per se, you know,
again, just making sure that
this fun lasts a while, um, with
the changing of rates, we did
see when Opportunity scholarship
was passed when lottery was
passed, college rates did
increase, and so, um, just
ensuring that rates are
consistent and and again just to
be able to serve and keep the
scholarship going.
You know, over the course.
A while, a few years. Um, is
there any sort of thought or is
that something later on to be
determined um by HED once this
goes into play.
Mr. Chair and Representative,
um.
I don't think you're implying
that we need to put a cap on
what the universities, but just
what this would cover, um, I
think so that we can have the
fullest effect, we wouldn't want
to do that. We would want to
make it so that the student got
the support that they needed so
that they, um.
Could be successful.
Um, thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes,
no, I, I wasn't necessarily
suggesting a cat, but like out
of state tuition versus in state
tuition can be considerably
higher, um, you know,
institution at, you know, just
different institutions within
our state can be considerably
higher or less so. I'm just
thinking of the long term
effectiveness.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you, uh, representatives
for bringing this forward. Um,
My questions are going to build
on uh my colleague
Representative Garrett, um, we
kind of think like, which is why
we support a lot of legislation
together. So, um, Mr. Chairman
and Representative, I'm gonna be
looking at page 4 of your bill.
Um
It it basically starts, uh, Mr.
Chairman, with, uh, starting on
line 20.
Uh, and ending on page 5 line 7.
OK. So my question, Mr. Chairman
and Representative.
I
Do we currently have any other
scholarship in New Mexico.
I.e., the legislative lottery
scholarship.
Or the opportunity scholarship
that has such a requirement as
to
Serve a number of years after we
have um.
Made the investment in the
education program.
Chair and Representative, um, I
don't know.
Oh, you do. Oh, OK. My expert
knows.
Thank you, Chairman and
Representative Baca, the answer
is no.
And I think that maybe.
Uh, somewhat of a mistake
because
Oh, although we're.
Helping our students.
The main goal of this bill is to
make sure of their success.
Um, the lottery scholarship is
great. The opportunity undergrad
programs, um,
But again, what, what are we
really looking at as far as
workforce development. I mean,
in the end, how many, I mean,
I'd like to know from higher ed.
I don't know the numbers. How
many students dropped out?
Or have left the state after
they get their degrees. So the
premise of of
Having students repay something
is not unheard of, and as you
know, we have a bill that does
repay loans.
I mean, so we're intentionally
repaying, but that's after this
bill is to make sure that they
come through debt-free and that
we can retain a workforce and to
be honest, if you're gonna come
to graduate school in New
Mexico, and I can tell you as a
graduate student at NMSU and med
school.
You can go anywhere you want in
the world with an education from
New Mexico, and many students,
unfortunately, do go, so the
point of being this is a focus
on doing what we can to retain
our students and honestly, our
grad schools are so great for
whatever student decides to go
to NMSU, UNM, New Mexico Tech.
There's all very positive
things. And the students coming
to New Mexico love it here.
I'm just gonna say that if we
can help them to get the
education free, provide the
facilities as we will be in SB1
and, and we can build the
workforce. I think people would
be very happy to live in New
Mexico, and they would, they
would be happy to be here
debt-free, so.
That's, that's my comment. Thank
you. And Mr. Chair and, uh,
Representative Baca, I just got
a note from someone from UNM uh
who's um working or in charge of
the title for E child welfare
scholarship and the students
have to pay that back.
So in essence, we're asking them
to pay it back by staying in New
Mexico and uh working.
Where they can earn money.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you for that answer, but
now when we're talking about
institutional scholarships.
Like through you and him or
through other that have provided
these scholarships, Mr. Chairman
Representative, one of the, when
we're talking about.
Policy and setting precedents.
That's what's really
Um, a concern here.
You know, as I said, Mr.
Chairman, I've said it many
times through this committee and
through the interim, one of the
greatest resources that we
export, which is the greatest um
detriment to our state is we
make an investment in these
young people's education through
the legislative lottery, an
opportunity of scholarship and
they leave.
And so Mr. Chairman and
Representative, by actually
having that in there.
It actually makes it more
difficult for me to support the
bill because uh I think that, do
I, we have made investments in
other licenses, but when we're
talking about Mr. Chairman and
Representative.
The mechanisms to
Collect these.
Scholarships and to collect
these funds.
Makes it more difficult. Do we
really want to take.
These students
And hold them and find them and
possibly take legal matters.
Who's, who's, where is the
enforcement of that. And so, um,
That, that is, you know, um, a
question, Mr. Chairman, I'll go
to my next question.
And this may have been um.
covered and so if it is, I
apologize. As I said, I was
actually uh representing
Representative Garrett's bill on
another committee, but um the
number of years, uh, as I said,
uh Mr. Chairman and uh Reson
Ferrari. I have a couple of
graduate degrees myself, but I'm
gonna look at pursuing a
doctoral degree, right? Is there
a number of years that is
limited that I may receive.
The um scholarship for my
doctoral degree.
Thank you, Chairman Romero and
Representative Baca, that's a
really good question.
Um
Graduate students don't always
finish in the ideal time frame.
OK. If you look at the stats, an
average uh master's program on
average in the nation might
finish instead of and PhDs of
the ones that I've seen working
at 5 medical schools and, you
know, they're really dependent
on the person, but typically I,
I haven't really seen many PhDs
that finish in 4 years.
OK, so this scholarship is not
limiting, and it's for the very
purpose. Adult learners who have
children and have to, you know,
in the past I had to hold a job
down just this will support them
as well, and it won't penalize
them.
For having taken uh more time,
uh, as far as a full-time
student, it's usually 3 credits,
uh, 3 classes, 9 hours, which
typically most people can
handle, but again, this does not
limit the adult learner. It does
not put limitations. So I think
that's a bonus, um, for any
student considering to go into I
thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you, uh, expert for your
answer, um, and Mr. Chairman, I
I do believe and I don't from a
higher ed. I did, I do
understand her or was someone I
went through, my grad programs,
was that to be a full-time grad
student was a minimum of 6 to 9
hours. It wasn't just 3 hours,
um.
And so I, I, I also, Mr.
Chairman and uh Representative
Farry, um.
When we talk about
For many folks, the coursework
for their doctorate is, you
know,
A number of hours, but then to
their completion of their
dissertation are those years
also counted towards the
Uh, time that we're going to
fund this, or is this only
active when we're pursuing or
taking classes, or if I would I,
Mister Chairman, would it be
said that if I am working on my
dissertation for a number of
years.
With those also
Would I be paid for, would I be
eligible for this stipend be uh
because I have not graduated
yet.
And yet I am actively pursuing
and working on a degree, Mr.
Chairman.
Um, yes, yes, I recognize that
sometimes it takesation.
Typically a dissertation or
anything you do like a thesis,
you have a particular number of
hours when I referred to 3
cloudy hours, so full time is
basically 9 hours when you're
represented Velasquez, um.
Sometimes you can actually just
have a certain number of hours
because to work on your
dissertation. So in that case,
you wouldn't be, we wouldn't be
paying you as being a full-time,
you know, 9 hour graduate
student, we would be paying you
for whatever that particular
course loader. Thank you.
And thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you for that answer. Um,
Mr. Chairman, my, I have one
more, and again, it's not quite
clear in this bill.
Instead of one time
Is that one time
What if I, what if I changed
schools? What if I enter?
Uh, Mr. Chairman and NMSU.
And then I actually I choose to.
Go to UNM.
The, is it a one time? I've
taken, I, you know, I take a
number of hours at uh graduate
school for master's usually 36
hours. I take 18 hours at New
Mexico State.
Uh, because of life
circumstances, I moved to UNM.
Would they then be eligible to
pick up the scholarship where I
left off, or does it terminate
with just one school.
Mr. Chairman
Uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative, if you'll refer
to page 5.
Um
The scholarship is for um a
period of one academic year and
um they may be provided to an
eligible student until the
eligible student completes a
graduate behavioral health
degree. Um, I believe, uh, when
the scholarship is terminated
upon the occurrence of
withdrawal, um, or failure of
the um eligible student to
achieve satisfactory academic.
You know, uh, progress.
Set by the institution, uh, then
the person would um have to stop
and pay the program back unless
um.
You could go into the pro into
another program type of.
You know
Uh, continuation you were going
for your master's.
From NMSU and behavioral health
or to um UNM.
You can transfer that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and uh
I'm gonna take it one step
forward.
Mr. Chairman, Representative
Farris.
What if I'm doing my master's
online through an out of state
university.
Um
Grand Canyon University, um,
Whether it be the northern New
Hampshire University. I see the
commercials all the time. I'm
sorry, um.
It worked.
But
Mr. Chairman, when we, we talked
about
Just like Mr. Chairman, right
now, we, we are not allowed. We
talked about lottery
legislative, we're talking about
in
State
Um
Institutions
But
Mr. Chairman and Representative,
is this also applicable to
If I'm doing my master's or
graduate degree or doctoral
degree through an out of state,
um.
Institution, would I also be
eligible for this scholarship.
Mr. Chair and Representative for
New Mexico institutions or, you
know, higher learning, so most
likely NMSU or um UNM or some of
the other programs that are at
our other state, but not to go
out of state to another, um.
Institution.
Um
Mr. Chairman, Madam Chair, can
you point me to the word says
just in state tuition or in
state institutions.
Uh, representative, so if I
could.
the presenters. So we have page
2, which we already mentioned in
reference to represent ladas,
uh, question is that it says
eligible institution, which
means those outlined in the
Constitution. And then if you
look at page 4,
Uh
Under subsection D2, distribute
to to each eligible institution.
The eligible institution being
those that are in the
Constitution as stated as higher
education.
Um
Thank you, Mr. Chairman for that
clarification is my questions.
Great. Thank you. Um, I don't
have anybody else on the list.
Um, so apparently from the
discussion, there's $3 million
in the budget. It could be
interpreted as fitting for this
program, um.
I guess
My question again, and I'm, I'm
sorry, I just need some
clarification as to why
not have
And give priority to New Mexico
residents over non-residents,
um, for this program.
Mr. Chair, um.
We want to attract.
People who will come and stay in
New Mexico and serve our
residents, our patients, um, the
Um, higher ed uh could.
have a preference if they have
all the applicants, um, if there
is a shortage of applicants,
then they could free up to
include people who will come out
of state but agreed to stay here
for
Whatever, um, years that they
were um given the scholarship.
And most likely then stay and
that's, you know, the goal to
increase our behavioral health
capacity and providers.
They're so desperately needed.
And, and I appreciate that I
guess part of where I'm coming
from is that that's on the front
end, but even looking like long
term as this as a potential way
to attract our students, some of
whom are here today as a way to
get them into behavioral health
services because they know
they're residents here. They
could go to an institution here
and they could um attain this
scholarship in order to help
them work in the community
because we always talk about in
education, the best teachers are
the ones that come
from their community and
understand the issues that their
people um.
Our, our, our experienceriencing
um.
And then, um,
I guess
Why, um,
We have a requirement to work
within the state.
Um, but
Have you looked into the most
underserved areas around our
state for behavioral health and
where those may be.
Chairman and Representative
Romero, uh, to answer your
question about whether we would
give priority. That would be
completely up to the um
Institution because they have
admissions.
Right now, I can say if you look
at the MD uh program, the BAMD,
it's primarily going to New
Mexico residents.
The conversation I had with the
uh director of the school of
nursing at NMSU indicated to me
that it would be very beneficial
if we could pick up students
from a literally half hour, an
hour away in El Paso and come to
New Mexico. This bill would
allow the universities to
recruit.
From
neighboring states, and that I
think could be key. I is it
gonna be the predominant, um,
you know, enrollment, no, but
all of this is to give our
colleges and universities, the
incentives that they desperately
need to, to not only from the
high school level up and you
know, because you teach high
school.
Um, the high school students
need to know if they knew like,
I don't know, I'm just saying
from from Highland High to New
Mexico Tech, I got a full
Regents. I would have gone out
of state from
Um, New Mexico Tech to the med
school, I would have gone out of
state, so the more that we can
capture our students, keep them
here, support them 1,000% with
debt-free education. Yes, that's
our absolute priority, but this
bill allows the universities to
also take students. I will
acknowledge.
Uh, and the comments by
Representative Gonzalez, some
universities do have a large
discrepancy between in and out
state tuition.
I'm, we're not presuming that we
want.
Mandate what the individual
institutions charge for in or
out of state, and I acknowledge
that that could be a substantial
amount more, but in the end, I
don't foresee this bill as
Necessarily bringing a huge
amount of out of staters, uh,
Representative Romero, but it
will entirely help our in-state
students for, thank you.
And, and I appreciate that. I
mean, here we're talking about
10 million in the bill, but 3
million potentially there in the
budget and if we do have out of
state folks to come in and we
start diluting them.
That pool of money for.
Our local students. So I just
flagged that as a potential
issue. Um, and then I guess
there's question from can't
remember if UNM, but um,
Would this mean full-time
practice, part-time practice,
half-time practice that they
would have to practice within
the state.
Um
After receiving this.
scholarship funds. Thank you,
Representative and Chairman
Ramiro, typically, um, as you
know, in social work and anybody
who has
Ever been in the field, it is,
we really do have to dedicate
that training time and yes, it,
it really does need to be a
full-time employment, as you
noticed in the bill also, we're
supporting licensure.
So our goal is not just to
graduate that student, but to
help them through the licensure
process.
OK, and that would enable them
to be ready for the workforce
ready to get hired, ready to to
be part of the solution. Uh, the
licensing fees can be pretty
high, uh, for the, I believe it
was the NP I looked into it,
$600 so this bill actually wants
to get a grou a graduate student
totally debt-free out of the
college. The only thing lacking
here is the housing and the and
MDBA at UNM does provide
housing.
So I guess to answer your
question, um, we want to make
them ready. They will be ready.
There's no point in graduating
without taking the test and
getting your licensure because
you can't practice, so.
The goal is to help them in
every way we can, and yes, they
will be working part time. I
just want to clarify again the
note that came in to
Representative Garrett on a
stipend. This bill is not
particularly for stipends. The
other second bill that we will
be asking for, um, is going to
ask for that. This bill in
particular is for the graduate
side of education, not
necessarily the stipend part or
training part, so with that
said,
Um
There is reason to believe we
could potentially and we did
talk, maybe get this into the
Senate.
Um, as an addition to HB 2.
However, we can get the funding,
whether it's through the
governor, but I think that the
whole state would be in
agreement that this is an
absolute.
Thank you. What's the will of
the committee?
The tough question.
Representative Lara.
Right,
so we have to do a second
represent Gonzalez, Madam
Secretary, if you call a role on
a do pass motion, please.
No, I'd like to explain my vote.
Representative Chatfield.
Representative Gonzalez.
Yes.
Representative Guola.
Representative Ladder.
Yes.
Representative Maribal Moya.
No, and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Representative for Ba Caballero.
Representative Collins,
now with.
Representative Torres Vales
Vales.
Yes
Representative Vincent.
Vice Chair Garrett.
Yes, and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Chairman,
and I don't need to explain my
vote.
OK, so we have numerous members
to explain their vote. Please
keep it very brief in your
explanation because we have some
students here and we got to get
to the floor, and Buck.
Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thank
you for bringing this, uh, Mr.
Chairman, it's not that I don't
support this initiative. I do
have a concern when we set
policy and we're talking about
uh instituting paybacks of these
funds and so.
Uh, it's not that I don't
support this, but I think that
we're setting precedents and I
would, uh, I really do think
that requiring HED or higher ed
to.
Be responsible for recouping
those, those monies, I think
would be extremely burdensome on
a higher ed.
Thank you, Representative.
Um,
for me, um, I don't think that
the state should become a
collection agency, um, in
reference to this, I think that
the way we could have had the
bill is that you pay back.
They backed the student loans.
year that they stay here versus
in that front.
le ed I'm 100%.
But again, there's no
appropriation. We've been really
um in this committee here, we've
been holding back pass bills if
there's no appropriation.
Thank you
$3 million represent Miua.
Um, thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, so
basically for me it was, it was
purely because of, yeah, there
was 3 million, but what we're
asking and 3 million of them is
is chump change compared to a
lot of these things anyway, but
um, we, um, not that this is
really beneficial and that we
shouldn't do something similar
to this, but we just held back
other stuff that were highly
beneficial because they weren't
in the budget. And so I'm not
going to pass this one and say
no to that one.
3 million and the budget
representative Garrett.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was
inclined to say no, but I think
you really have to go have a
what I call a come to Jesus talk
with HAFC before it goes any
farther.
Thanks.
All right, so you have a due
pass on House Bill 375. So thank
you all so much. We appreciate
it. Thank you, Mr. Chair and
thank you committee. Um, we will
do that, um, with HAFC and other
provider uh funding uh areas,
but also, um we can um
Look at um amending it to where
the HDD is not responsible for
making sure the students stay in
the um state to serve, but
possibly the institutions. So
thank you. All right. Thank you.
So, we have some students.
So
Some are leaving. All right, so
we have students. So it looks
like some of them have already
introduced themselves, but we
have other students. So if you
would quickly tell us your name,
what school you're from, what
grade you're in?
Stand up please.
