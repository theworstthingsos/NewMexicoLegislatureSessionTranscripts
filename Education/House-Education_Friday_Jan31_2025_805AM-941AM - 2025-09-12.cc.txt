Share Romero.
Here
So, um
As it's day 3, the primary focus
is going to be over the public
education reform fund and the
growth funds which we started
last year. There are some
programs in it, so the folks on
our panel are going to give us
an update and then obviously if
you have questions, maybe follow
ups to Wednesday's discussion
over the SCG, um, categorical
appropriations or obviously the
presentation from this morning,
just let me know. I can add you
to the list and we'll go through
the list.
All right, so, Director Senna,
looks like you're gonna start,
so good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Chair. Good
morning, members.
Um,
I figured you were getting tired
of hearing my voice, so I
changed it for today.
Uh
Just so you wouldn't get bored.
Um
So the run of show for today,
Mr. Chair, is I'm gonna, I'm
gonna go sort of a brief, a
brief overview of the public
education reform Fund.
What it is, why it exists.
Um, and how we've used it in the
past.
And I'm going to hand it over to
Sunny and Sunny's going to talk
about grow.
how that
that fund works and again why it
started and what it's being used
for.
Turn over to the secretary.
She'll talk a little bit about.
potentially some benefits to
long term.
appropriations and and some long
term pilots and how that might.
He both either the department
and obviously folks who get that
funding.
And then we'll talk
specifically.
And then we'll talk uh about,
we'll go back to your budget
sheet after we do that overview.
talk specifically about some of
the recommendations.
uh, the three of us have for
those for that specific fund the
PERF.
So, the first thing I'll do
today is tell you a little bit
about the public education
reform Fund and some of you have
been here long enough to know
about it and and kind of what it
is. But for those of you who are
new, especially.
I hope this will be helpful. So
in 2019, the legislature passed
Senate Bill 1, House Bill 5,
which is a omnibus education
bill that included a lot of
initiatives, including the
creation of the K5+.
extended learning time programs.
At that time
There was an appropriation made
to the SCG.
For those programs, and those
were essentially incentive
programs for school districts
and charter schools to add.
School days to their calendars.
Uh, K5 plus,
required that folks add 25 days?
An extended learning time
program.
required that school districts
add 10 days.
And so for those additional
days, school districts and
charter schools will receive
additional funding.
I, if I had done my homework
properly, I would know the exact
number, but it was upward of
$200 million that you were
appropriating every year.
For those programs.
But those programs were
optional.
And so essentially what happened
as the as the department
administered those funds.
They set, they set them aside
and a school district.
School districts, um
participated in the program
They received additional funding
at the end of the year, whatever
was left of that appropriation.
Uh, reverted but not to the
general fund.
That those funds reverted to the
public education reform Fund,
which was created with the
specific purpose of catching
those rivers.
So
Um
We can get you a 5-year history
of the of that fund if you'd
like. I didn't bring it with me
today because I wanted to stay
pretty high level, but
essentially what happened is you
had
Especially at the very
beginning.
More than 100 million, 100s of
millions of dollars reverting.
Because uptake in the K5 plus
and extended learning time
programs was pretty minimal,
especially at first.
And so you had
Millions of dollars reverting to
that fund, and each subsequent
legislative session.
You all were able to use funds
from the public education reform
Fund.
to pay for other education
initiatives.
So
Starting during the 2020
legislative session, you all
started using money in the purf.
to pay for other things.
Non-recurring initiatives.
And so you've been doing that.
for the last
4 or 5 years.
In 2023, when you all pass,
Sonny's reading my mind. We've
been doing this too long.
When 2023, when you all passed
House Bill 130.
You repealed the K5+, and
external extended learning time
programs, doing away with that
altogether.
And you appropriated money
directly to the SCG for the
increase to instructional hours.
So rather than having optional
programs for school districts to
buy into.
What you all paid for was for
every school district and
charter school to increase the
number of instructional hours.
hours
According to House Bill 130,
could be used as local districts
and charter schools saw fit.
did not mandate days.
But what that did, it also meant
that there were no more
reversions to the public
education reform Fund.
So over the last two years
you've continued to use the
remaining balance.
in the public education reform
Fund to pay for education
initiatives on a non-recurring
basis.
But obviously, the fund balance
has continued to decrease to the
point where starting this
legislative session, there's
about $14 million left.
Public education reform Fund.
That you can still appropriate
and you'll see in a minute,
we'll talk a little bit about
some recommendations to use that
balance.
Um
Uh, we won't get into the
specifics yet.
But I will say that the reason
we're talking about this at all
is that both LESD and LFC have a
proposal.
To shore up, if you will, or or.
But another lump sum of money
from the general fund into the
public education reform Fund.
So that you all can potentially
fund
Multi-year pilots that will be
then evaluated, studied for
effectiveness, and then you all
can use that information to
determine whether some of these
initiatives are worth either
recurring funding or maybe
another round of non-recurring
after a three-year period.
So with that, Mister Chair, I'm
going to stop talking about
Perth. I'm gonna hand it over to
Sunny to talk a little bit about
grow because there's been a, I
think a little bit of confusion
about whether this is Perth or
grow or some people say perf
grow, right, there's all kinds
of of names and so hopefully
when we're done here, we'll get
that cleared up and I'll let
Sunny talk about growth for a
few minutes. Thank you, Mr.
Chair and thank you John for the
introduction.
Um
The sponsor of the Grove fund is
with us. I'd like to recognize
our, our chair, um.
President small, uh.
curve actually influenced some
of our thinking around grow. It
was sort of a.
Initial idea that maybe we
should have a pool of funds.
That we use.
To research innovative ideas.
And given the influx in oil and
gas and knowing the horizon in
which we would have to
potentially start prioritizing
recurring over non-recurring
funds. Um, there is this idea
that
Maybe there are some ideas worth
testing out.
Giving it a little bit of a lead
time to study and understand
what's working and what's not
before we move a non-recurring
type of item into a recurring
appropriation in the future.
And thus
Gro was formed, the idea of
making a down payment today.
Testing it over the course of 3
years and then determining by
the end of the pilot program,
whether we should reprioritize
funding because things are not
working or we should actually
build this into our base budgets
because it is the new way of
doing business. That was the
initial impetus for grow.
I think what might have gotten a
little confusing last year we we
do a very poor job of
Surprise, we have an idea, um,
there was a lot of
Concern about this large fund
getting a lot of appropriations
and having a lot of measures and
accountability tied to it.
Um
There was also, as you're all
aware, a separate appropriations
bill that had been floating in
recent years called House Bill 2
Jr. Um.
These two got combined.
In the process of the
legislative session last year.
So not only did you have these
large grow appropriations like
60 million for teacher
residencies and principal
residencies.
But she also had
$160,000 appropriations to
specific districts or charters.
To
Also
called grow appropriations.
Bill did get signed, um.
The accountability measures were
removed and vetoed.
But there was a 3 year
appropriation made for the large
agency grow appropriations and
two-year appropriations for all
the member ads to grow.
This year there are 2 proposals
coming forward to you.
One is to put those
accountability measures back in
place for grow with some
changes.
And also
To look at the public education
reform fund.
As a mirror image of grow given
that we have partners.
With the legislative education
Study Committee, who are really
invested in the work of studying
education reforms, so including
them as a partner to look
specifically at education
reforms. So,
You've got a bill for grow
accountability.
That includes LFC and DFA.
And then you've got a public ad
reform fund accountability.
Bill that includes PD, DFA, LFC,
and LESC, um, in the process of
looking at these.
Proposals in front of you today,
so that
We start at the beginning.
defining what the measure of
success is.
So that by the time we get to
that 3 year mark.
We have some joy and
accountability on what we're
trying to achieve here. And in
that process, having a
collaborative effort in
determining whether we should
continue these investments or
not.
So that's uh very high level
overview of what is in front of
you today. You can see some of
that.
the very last few sections of
your high level, which we'll go
over later, but with that, I
will turn over to the secretary
to talk more about how this
affects PED specifically.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee and.
Thank you again for joining us
this morning. Um, so I wanna
start by just um.
Speaking to the value of
multiyear funding.
Um, and the idea of funding new.
innovative ideas, as Sunny
mentioned.
The idea of testing.
new concept tweaks over several
years.
As we figure out.
is this something really, um, I
just wanna concepts in terms of
what they can do for us, um, we
also all agree.
That multiyear funding allows us
to do things on time funding.
Um, when we have one time
funding any time it takes time
after House Bill 2 assigned to
stop.
think about what is the intent
of this funding to to develop
plans to devise our scopes of
work and to really work with the
school districts that.
takes time and then to get the
money out, right, that takes
time.
to start that.
Every
fiscal year take time and so
when we have multiyear funding,
it allows us to take advantage
of doing it once and then really
pushing out that money.
And implement years.
Um, from
the
District and charter school
perspective.
Many of them will not even
entertain or take up.
Initiatives with one time
funding.
Um, they, it's worth their
effort, uh, they are hesitant to
high funding, so, so that just
allows us to bring them in, get.
on board when they know that
they with the funding.
um
As we think about what we need
to do to improve states.
address a very serious chronic
absenteeism issues.
Um, it really does take a
longer.
term vision and effort and so
again.
Um, and what it means to both
the department.
Um, and to our to.
Um, and then from, you know, the
tribal perspective as we think
about.
Um, our education acts.
only to.
Our school
Rely in need some consistency,
their process to approve funding
levels they're given funding on
an annual basis um.
Affect all
And so again, very strategic to
align.
The
finding that we are responsible.
overseeing education system.
Partnership
With our sister and.
Um
And and to really align that
with our strategic plan, our
strategic plan.
It's very, and the ability for
us to look at the funding that
be thoughtful over a series made
of um all of that is really to
have the opportunity for
multi-year funding, um, that we
get to really be.
Um
I do want to speak a little bit
about um the the the Perf girl,
I think uh I that's, that's what
I call it, it's, it's the perf
grow.
Um
And uh just getting.
Just really understanding that
legislation.
Um, I want to be clear that.
Evaluating the effectiveness of
our programs being really clear
about performance based.
Scopes of work
And efforts is something that I
truly.
Um, prioritize to get the
outcomes that we want, we have
to be thinking about.
What do we expect to get with
every dollar that we spend in
this to be intentional upfront
in developing those um
performance measures, those
desired outcomes, and they
really need to be within every
aspect of what we're doing, the
upfront planning.
Um
The defining of our evaluation
of our programs and then all the
way through, um, the works as
well as our contractors. Um.
But I do have some, some
concerns.
Um
I think that um the process in
which we engage in.
With the LFC and LESC, um,
around collaborating about our
budgets and our ideas, I think
is really, really positive.
Um, we already have very strong.
And the EASC that we partner on
and we collaborate on. Um, I
would be concerned if um we
have.
A process in which.
We require approval.
Um, um
the LFC or LAC before we could
move forward would really could
have the potential of slowing.
down.
The overall process.
Um
I, uh, I think the language also
is very focused on.
More of that approval. And so I
would like to see it move more
towards that place, um, I think
that together as partners, we
have the ability to be really
thoughtful about developing
performance measures or what is
it that we.
Um, what is the legislative
intent for this funding? What is
it that we need to do in terms
of student outcomes, um, and
that we can really be effective
in planning in that way, but I I
do have some concerns about.
the way it's kind of framed in
the legislation that can take us
away from.
Um, the collaborative sort of
part, you know, you, you can't
move forward you're doing, and
so that would be a step away
from.
the current design, and I think
the role that each of us have in
terms of the executive and what
we need, those are just some
things that I I really.
As we think about.
Um, it's not the idea of
multiyear funding. It's not the
idea of developing performance
measures that are really focused
on student outcome on that
design and again, um, I just saw
the bill.
And so I need to really look at
it and we'll definitely have
conversation, um, I just wanted
to raise a couple of sort of
thoughts about um.
Mr. Chair, uh, thank you,
Secretary. Uh just wanted for
people's reference, Senate Bill
201 is the bill that secretary
is referring to this is an LFC
endorsed.
piece of legislation that was
introduced yesterday.
So
If you weren't, if you weren't
quite sure.
What we're talking about just
yet. Um.
So Mr. Chai, I think now we're
going to get into
sort of the, the specific uh
proposals that that each of us
have for this, for this.
Hoofro
Um, before we do, I just wanted
to say I don't know if I've had
a chance to do this yet, um.
Just to think.
Sunny and the secretary
designate.
For helping us to coordinate
these presentations for you. We
hope they've been helpful as the
secretary has said, um, it's
been a really nice partnership.
Some of you were in the in the
event earlier today and I think
it's clear that we're talking to
each other on a pretty regular
basis.
collaboration between education
and finance focus is I think
also very apparent.
So I just wanted to thank them
both for the partnership during
this week. It's been extremely
so if you, if you still have
your budget sheet.
We're gonna turn now to page 3.
And I'm going to go very briefly
over one section starting with
line 133 on page 3.
If you have, if you, oh, I
should have said this, I can't
believe I haven't pitched this
yet.
If you have this at your desk.
This is our LESC annual report.
Hot off the presses.
And if you don't have your
budget sheet, it may be a little
bit different because as we move
through the session, things get
changed a little bit.
You can turn to page 124 in the
report.
And you'll find a copy of the
high level that you've been
using all.
All week
And so on that high level,
If you'll turn to page 126.
You'll see that that's the same
version that you've had in front
of you all week.
With, with the, with the
differences between all the uh
recommendation. So if you didn't
have it, you didn't bring your
homework.
It's OK.
We, we've got it here.
All right, so very quickly on
line 133 through 141.
This section you'll see says
public education reform Fund
online 133 on the left-hand
side.
This section is dealing
primarily with the balance
that's in the fund currently.
mentioned earlier that there's
$14 million already in that
public education reform fund
that has not been spent from.
A previous reversions.
in this particular section has
to do with some recommendations
from the 3 of us about how to
use that money.
And you'll see that's one place
where the executive is
recommending taking money for a
career technical education.
It's the place that I mentioned,
I think on Wednesday that both
LESC and LFC have recommended
paying for that learning
management system and the
microcredentials that we talked
about.
And then that line 140 is some
fun to clean up.
That actually working with DFA
analysts.
kind of talk to us a little bit
about that.
Very minimal negative balances
across multiple funds in the
agency that have been there for
years and years and years, and
this is just a zero things out.
So that's the current amount of
money.
Very quickly, if you'll turn.
To line 93.
I'm gonna just take us back in
time so Wednesday very quickly.
You'll see on line 93.
is a $150 million.
education reform Fund.
And that is from
I think it's 83. 0 my goodness.
Sorry this is this is, this is
why I forgot to take my glasses
off. I was
I was almost flawless on
Wednesday. This is what happens.
Man, everybody looked really
confused and I thought, what am
I doing wrong?
Uh, I can't see your faces when
I take my glasses off. So like
what, 83.
It's a, it's an appropriation to
the public education reform Fund
from the general fund.
So essentially what we're doing
is we're we're appropriating
some of that balance that's
left, and then we're also
putting a bunch of money in it?
That's the proposal.
And then if we'll turn now
The line. Let me take my glasses
off.
One
65.
These are the, these are the
potential uses.
For that $150 million.
That would be placed into the
public education reform.
though.
One more time, just for clarity.
General fund appropriation to
the public education reform
Fund.
That would then be used for
these purposes.
Over the next 3 years.
So every number that you see
here divide by 3.
That would give you your your
annual appropriation for each of
these proposals.
If they, if the bill passes.
So very quickly I'll go ahead
and go over LESC and then I'll
let Sunny talk uh about the LFC
recommendation and then if the
uh the secretary wants to talk
about.
Some of the recommendations they
have.
So the first is innovation
zones, that's $45 million that
LESC is recommending innovation
zones was started uh with a 2022
appropriation
and it's essentially focused on
high school reform or
transformation, and as, as I've
talked about this week, we know
that secondary students need a
lot of additional support. We've
talked about attendance and the
lack of engagement at the
secondary level, and this is
money that the department has
used to support school districts
in charge.
schools with figuring out what
should our school look like?
That includes creating
Graduate profiles aligned to the
new graduation requirements.
And potentially revamping the
kinds of courses or offerings
that they have for students in
order to increase engagement in
And ideally student outcomes.
This 45 million, as I said, is
divided by 3, so it's about $15
million a year over the next 3
years and is very similar to the
amount that were already
spending on innovation zones. So
this would, as the secretary
said,
Guarantee that 3 year.
pilot, so folks know that money
is coming, the department
doesn't have to revamp things
every year or figure out whether
or not they're getting or how
much they're getting every year.
The second is support for
attendance, support for
attendance for success, which is
your uh
Attendance law
we've heard
Uh, all of you have probably
heard about chronic absenteeism,
especially since the pandemic,
but even prior to the pandemic,
we had schools that had high
levels of chronic absenteeism.
That's only been exacerbated by
the pandemic and even though
numbers have improved over the
last couple of years is still an
issue of concern for, for most
of us, and so this would help
the department.
to pay for initiatives including
personnel support at school
districts and other initiatives
as well.
I do want to talk a little bit
about line 168 because this is
unique to LESC.
In in the way that we're
recommending support for
students who are unhoused.
Over the interim.
LESC heard about a pilot that
was run in 3 school districts.
That essentially paid students,
homeless students as defined by
the Federal McKinney Vento law.
$500 to go to school.
Every month, $500 a month.
And for that money, students had
to go to school.
had to participate in some after
school programming and tutoring.
School districts had to create
some infrastructure to support
those students during the pilot.
And they were pretty much no
strings as far as what students
could use the money on.
And without having uh the
presentation in front of me.
The folks who ran this pilot
said most of that money went to
pay for the things you might
expect for families who are
experiencing homelessness.
Homes, transportation, food.
These are basic needs that these
families are able to meet with
those cash payments.
Normally, graduation rates for
uh students experiencing
homelessness.
is in the low 60%.
This pilot found that the
students participating graduated
at upward of 90%.
And so we see some really
promising results from this
pilot that's already happened.
And so ESC staff is recommending
$10 million a year.
For the next 3 years.
That would pay for about 1500
high school students every year
for the next 3 years.
1500 is about.
Half the number.
High school students
experiencing homelessness. So
essentially a focus on juniors
and seniors to help them
graduate during those final two
years, uh.
high school.
Line 169.
Math achievement
I, uh, essentially a $5 million
a year to support the department
with some professional
development for teachers, and
I'll let the secretary talk a
little bit about that because
that's also part of their
proposal.
A secondary educated literacy is
helping secondary teachers,
primarily middle school teachers
with that literacy component
we've trained most elementary
school teachers at this point
are finishing up training most
elementary school teachers in
structured literacy that science
of reading that you've heard so
much about. This has expanded
some of that work.
Uh, to secondary teachers
specific uh
To their content area.
or how content area teachers at
the secondary level support
literacy.
Line 171.
And I'll actually let Sonny talk
a little bit about this one
because um it's something that
we, we've heard about too, but
he's also brought to LFC, which
is innovative staffing
strategies, and this is related
to the opportunity culture model
that we saw in Carlsbad.
how to leverage high quality
teachers across the school.
And then uh on line 172, another
LESC specific.
Recommendation as the creation
of a statewide STEM innovation
Network.
This would be housed at an
institution of higher education
to coordinate.
STEM resources across the state,
both for K-12 but also for
higher and workforce. So this is
an education, but also a
workforce development
initiative.
And again, that's a $2 million
per year.
the next 3 years.
Sonny, you want to talk a little
bit about yours?
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, John.
Uh, I, I just like to
talk briefly about line 174, and
then I'll hand it over to the
secretary to talk more about the
executive recommendation. Uh,
line 174 is an indigenous
education initiative, um,
spurred largely by conversations
that you've all probably been
hearing lately about how do we
improve.
Educational outcomes for our
indigenous students. This would
provide about $5 million each
year to test out a new formula
that would be an allocations to
tribal education entities and
the support initiatives related
to Native American student
programming.
Uh, this
Likewise with uh
A comparable to the $5 million
that um is in the LESC
recommendation, which you will
see, I wanna make sure I get
this right.
Um
Online 94.
And with that, I'll turn it over
to Secretary Descent Patilla to
talk about her initiatives.
Thank you, Sunny, um.
So I will say that um.
Director Senna did a really good
job explaining uh those.
In their budget, uh, our budget
has of the innovative staff that
I welcome and I think would be a
great with our school districts
and charter schools, um, we just
have those um items coming out
of different, um, I will.
know that um the $150 million.
That would be, would be, um,
dependent on the passing of the
legislation, I'm sure Sunny will
talk some more about um the so.
That would be something you're
all in agreement, our priorities
and that need to happen are tied
to the passing of, um, I would
just um.
like that for you all as well.
Um
The only thing that I, I think.
Didn't really speak about.
Um
Um, that funding really allows
the public education department.
To support our schools
designated in need of
improvement.
It allows us to work to go into
the schools to spend time with
them, with their leadership and
with their with their teachers,
um, and to really look at the
areas that are leading to them,
allows us to look at student
assessment data with them to
develop some uh priorities and
some very focused strategies to
look at how they are going goals
and then monitor them over time.
We can give them um some
additional sort of professional.
Um
Um, and so this funding is
really critical for allowing the
the department to do that. It's
highly effective.
It's highly popular as well
among schools that are getting
that extra support.
also able to contract.
With uh folks that can give
additional sort of support over
um.
Over a school year and over
multiple school years.
Um, we are this year doing this
work.
Not just of improvement where
we're expanding that effort to
help other schools that are
inviting us in and allowing us
to give them that support to
address some of the challenges.
The team that goes into school
up of various bureaus that have
specific expertise that support,
so I think that was the only one
that that uh John didn't really
talk about.
So with that, Mr. Chair, I think
I'll just, uh, you know, repeat,
I think maybe what the secretary
said earlier, obviously.
We're very fortunate.
Mexico's in a in a fortunate
position to be able to have the
sort of money to be able to put
in a in a fund like this.
And try out these ideas.
Uh, and as the secretary said, I
think we're all committed
regardless of.
the final version of a of a
piece of legislation or whether
there's legislation at all to
continue to partner.
And evaluating the
effectiveness, um.
One thing I didn't say about
this report, especially for new
members, and for any member who
in the legislature who's not
part of the education LESD
during the interim is you will
see the work that the committee
and the staff have done in
trying to evaluate some of the
the programs that we already
have in place.
Both from a sort of um
qualitative lens because we
talked to a lot of people to see
how things are going and to the
extent possible.
Some quantitative analysis about
the effectiveness of programs.
That the
In this 3-year version would
actually give us a pretty strong
foundation to continue doing.
With that Mister Chair, I think
we'll stand for questions.
OK.
I'm sorry, I, I can wait until
we kind of get into questions,
but.
I did want to, um, the direction
that we are working at in PED in
terms of how we are looking at
the funding that the agency does
remind with our strategic plan
and the goals of the agency.
Um, we are doing.
Something that we have not done
before.
Which is really working very
intentionally across our various
programs to make sure.
That when we're doing that
budget planning, we're thinking
together about how, what are the
roles that we each play in
addressing a specific like
graduation rates that they're
planning with the budgets that
they are responsible for
planning together to make sure
that they're leaning in.
That we're uh working together
so that we have efficiencies.
And not duplication and that
we're really thinking about
those outcomes and developing
our scopes of work for.
Um, the money that we procure
services for as well as the
money that goes out to a school
districts and charter schools
and in that really developing
our performance measures for all
of that location that we're very
clear about our expectations for
this money that we can tie the
money to specific outcomes and
that that's all done on the
front end before it even flows.
Um, agency staff right now.
Um, has completed their midyear,
uh, mid fiscal year looking at
where are we at with with our
funding, do we need to pivot?
Um, maybe we're seeing some
really great success in a
particular area, let's do some
more, um, reflecting with the
school district to pivot at this
point to figure out where do we
wanna really kind of double down
in terms they're also doing
planning for next fiscal year.
Thinking about where, where do
we want to focus, where can we
collaborate performance
measures, um, this department,
one that I'm really excited,
well, um, help us at the
department to be accountable
about how we're really.
Directing and and spending
aborative work within the agency
and I think in terms of ensuring
that we are supporting, um, the
academic achievement.
Great. Again, thank you all for
for being willing to be here for
a second day and also to our
house appropriations and finance
chair represent a small thank
you for being here. Um.
Remembers first on my list I
have Representative Chatfield.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Uh,
fortunate to serve here.
On the education
On the LFC
During the interim
I serve on the New Mexico
Finance Authority Oversight
Committee.
When you start digging into
funds.
There are hundreds.
And that
You know, no country kids, you
come in there and you think I'm
gonna learn them funds and more
the more you dig, the more funds
you find out there are pretty
quick, you just uh, it's like,
whoa.
So, tell me.
What the purf girl can do.
I think it's, I think the growth
fund idea is great, you know,
gives us a couple 2 or 3 years
to see if something's working.
Uh
And if it's not, well we do it,
but we don't do away with it, we
just leave the funds, usually
just sits there and goes on
into, you know, and so now I'm
seeing this, this fund that's
being rescued to keep her from
dying, right?
So if it does some good, well,
I'm, I'm for it, and if it
doesn't do some good, well then
I'm not for it because it just
makes it more confusing to those
that follow us.
What can this perro, what is the
difference between growth funds.
grow
Because you said they were
almost identical, right? They're
they're somebody used the I
heard the word mirror image come
out of there a while ago. So
what is the advantage?
You're having this perf grow.
Uh
As opposed to the growth funds
and exactly.
Good and bad, what are the
differences between the two
funds. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, Representative. It's the
big elephant in the room. I'll
actually say that.
This attempt is a good faith
effort to include.
Um, our partners at the
legislative education Study
Committee.
In this process, the growth fund
is only a negotiated agreement
between DFA and LFC and it's for
all state government
initiatives.
Um, education is a large piece
of that, and we have a sister
agency that is particularly
focused on education, hence,
trying to create this.
peace.
Like row, but for education.
In conjunction with LESC.
So
Mr. Chair, that is exactly.
But I thought, and I'm not for
it or against it yet. I haven't
got to, I haven't got to see the
legislation.
But uh
That does answer my question and
and thank you.
Thank you represent Vincent.
It is Representative Vincent.
Yeah,
I was gonna say I didn't know if
there was another one. We got
appointed to committee or
anything. I sure hope there's
not, Mr. Chair.
I'm just sitting here pondering.
I, I'm trying to, I'm trying to
soak all this in and, and, uh,
I, I was really getting my, my
arms around health and I've been
there for 2 years and now here
I'm trying to get my arms around
this, and I know it's a very
important subject.
But I'm gonna start backwards on
my, on my, uh, questions.
So you mentioned on line 168.
And the students that are
unhoused and
You mentioned a pilot program
that you have looked into where
they're paying students and you
saw a 90% good outcome. Would
you explain that to me?
Mr. Chair Representative
Vincent, welcome to Education.
Thank you.
Uh
To be honest, I'm probably not
the expert on on this particular
piece where we're happy to send
you the presentation that the
folks so this is uh an
organization of Albuquerque that
actually ran the pilot.
Cuba school districts, one of
the school districts in Las
Vegas. I always forget which
one, and I believe there's a 3rd
and I, even though I keep saying
I can never remember it. I also
don't go look it up. I should do
that. Um.
And
And again, they're getting a lot
of support from the school. It
isn't just the money.
OK. So they get the $500. But as
I said, the students are are in
addition to just attending
school.
are also required to do tutoring
and other support services. The
school is the school district is
required to create that
infrastructure of support for
those students, so it isn't just
the money, there are other
pieces that come with it.
And again, I'm paraphrasing on
the results, um, but the school
district, the superintendents
and the folks who work directly
with students there, couldn't
say enough about how effective
and positive it was for the
students that participated.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and, you
know, I, I go back and I'm gonna
make a couple of examples when I
go back when I was a kid.
And I can't be a, I can't even
imagine being paid to go to
school.
You know, it was kind of
something that, you know, I
wanted to do because, um, you
know, we took care of cattle
and, and it was really hot and
dusty all summer, and I used to
just sit there and dream. I
can't wait to go back to school.
I can't wait to get in an air
conditioner and have clean
clothes on, it's gonna be so
nice.
Uh, so my second question is,
On, uh, let's see, oh, on
section 9.
Let's just, yeah, section 9 from
165.
Down to 174. Would you tell me
what those at the end of
innovation zones on 166, those
small numbers 12, and 3. What is
that?
Mr. Chair, Representative, those
refer to footnotes, which you'll
find on the last page. OK.
So I don't have my regular page.
I'm looking in the book and I'll
just point out that um the one
means that it's contingent on
legislation.
2 means that it's appropriate
for 3 fiscal years.
And the 3 means it's from the
public education reform Fund.
OK. Thank you very much.
And also Mr. Chair, so this is
her secretary Padilla.
I know you got your hands full
and everybody wants to be in the
middle of the pack and, you
know, I mean, I, I've heard we
have to graduate 15 to 1800 kids
to get in the middle of the
pack. Is that correct?
Mr. Chair Representative
Vincent, uh, to get us to, um,
the national average, it's more
than that, it's a little over
2000.
As students to get us there.
Um, yes, sir. OK, so,
I keep hearing absenteeism is
one of the biggest things.
I'm trying to go back, cause
sometimes I think we outsmart
ourselves.
And I try to go back.
Whenever I was a kid and I was
going to school.
What is changed? Why?
This kid, why do kids not go to
school.
And how can we make them go to
school, and I know I'm, since
I'm new, I'm only going to get
to say this one time.
And then I won't say it no more.
Uh, and I, I might say it again,
I'm not for sure.
But whenever I was in school.
I remember if you were an
athlete.
We used to get swats.
And
I'm not talking, I'm talking if
you are late to class 4 times if
you get 4 tardy, you're getting
a SWAT.
If you're an athlete,
The principal don't swat you.
The
Coach watch you.
And I remember getting my first
set of swats.
And I wasn't late anymore.
Why, why do we have these
problems now?
And do we need to swat kids
again?
And if you could just make sure
you keep your discussion through
the chair, please. Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Mr. Chair Representative
Vincent, you know, the issue
around chronic absenteeism, I
know you've heard us say this,
it really is a very complex
issue and there are many
different factors.
that um impacts whether or not.
Um
We know that we were had
attendance, but it.
Certainly, um, worsened.
During the pandemic and after
the pandemic, and this is true
nationally, nationally, we
really have not rebounded.
And our attendance, the way uh
that we would like.
Um, but
the reasons why students, um, do
not come to school again.
Very
Um
Some it's an issue of whether or
not you feel like you need to be
there every day, cause when we
were, you know, and during the
pandemic didn't necessarily have
to be at school, right? In order
to to.
To be a student.
Um, and so I think really
changing people's mindset that
it really does matter.
That you're there every day and
that's not just the student, I
think that's true for families
and.
others and so um we have an
attendance campaign right now
that is really meant to.
Um,
just say that in order to be sex
successful in school and in
life, you have to show up every
day and so.
The changing that mindset and,
and really being clear that it
matters, it really matters and
that.
Me not being at school.
Um, affects my ability to learn
and to obviously pass my
classes, but they're also
indicators as to whether or not.
Going to graduate and be
successful.
postsecondary.
Um, behavioral health uh
concerns are also a barrier to
students attending.
Um
Really feeling that they have um
a strong sense of belonging at
school that they feel good about
being there, but they feel
supported.
That they feel that uh they can
be successful barrier.
There are many challenges that
families experience, whether
it's housing insecurity,
economic insecurity,
transportation.
Um, challenges, all of those
things can also be barriers to
attending school, um, or, um,
particularly for our secondary
students, um.
that school's relevant.
It's something that we hear from
students as well like.
Am I really learning anything
here that um I'm interested in,
or that's gonna help me into my
um, my, the rest of my life,
done many things to address the
investment.
behavioral health investments
that you see in our budgets,
things like CTE, um, and
innovations of relevance and
interest for our students, um,
really focusing as well on the
preparation.
Um, and abilities of our
teachers and our school
administrators is also a big
part of that, so it, it, it is a
very complex issue. It's not,
um.
Things like community schools.
Um, and, and those sorts of, um,
an environment at school where
students and families want to
be.
Um, for many families, they may
not feel that even.
Success for themselves in school
and so it's hard for them to.
You know.
tell their child, you really
should be there perhaps they
didn't have the best
environments that we create.
Being engaging, being
supportive, um, all of those
things to school.
Thank you for that and thank
you, Mr. Chair. My apologies for
not going through the chair. I
get, sometimes I get zoned into
what I'm doing and I forget. uh,
Mr. Chair.
I, I mentioned, you mentioned
that um.
You gave an example about.
Maybe LFC not being engaged in
some of your approval processors
or recommendations. Would you
explain that?
chair.
Um
It was more of a reference in
terms of um.
And again, I got to really
understand this pill.
Um, but
The idea that um.
The LFC would have to approve.
what the department.
Is planning to do.
How we are measuring uh our
performance measures.
Um
I
Before we can move forward, I, I
think that.
I do have some concern there.
Um, I, you know, I, we talk
about the um the men, they do
the same for us. They evaluate
our programs.
year round
Um, they have specific
performance indicating on.
Constantly creating another
layer, I think that is.
It requires um.
Our ability to proceed with our
work would be contingent on
their approval, that piece makes
me a little bit.
hesitant.
And so I would have to really
understand what that would look
like.
Um, it's not the collaboration,
it's not the program evaluation,
it's not setting performance
measures, all of that I think is
incredibly already.
Um
Uh
The the 3 year funding we're all
on board with all of those
things, but I think if we create
additional layers.
Um
Of oversight and approval.
Um, that
could have the ability to.
If I may, Mr. Chair.
Um, representative, uh, I just
want to clarify and give some
assurance that the bill says
That these plants must be
approved by DFA in consultation.
With LFC and LESC.
We do recognize the role of the
executive and implementation and
we see ourselves as partners in
this.
Um, I do want to just add that
um if you
Recall LESC recently did an
evaluation of the teacher
residency program.
Um
part, part of the issue with
that evaluation was that there
were not data.
collection processes in place
before the program was started.
And so the evaluators were
unable to determine if the
program works.
Or not.
We
By no means want to delay
processes before they get
rolling, but we want to make
sure that all the
People who are
Vested in overseeing these
programs are clear about what
the expectations are, what the
measure of success is before we.
start
running with the program and
hoping that we can find out
information after the fact.
Mr. Char just add one more thing
if I could uh representative.
I think one thing to keep in
mind here, um, and, and I agree
with almost everything everybody
said, um.
Is that, as we've mentioned this
week.
Our state's ability to fund
these kinds of initiatives
either on a one year or
multi-year basis is relatively
new.
We've been, we've been funding
public schools primarily through
the SCG.
For the majority of the time
we've been finding schools. Our
ability to fund these kinds of
short-term pilots or test runs
at things is still within the
last easily within the last 10
years, if not within the last 5
or 6, and I think one thing that
is probably worth discussing in
this process is what is, what
are the different um
Agencies for lack of a better
term, entities capacity to do
this work well?
And while understanding that it
does take some time to build.
kind of evaluative
You know, almost academic sort
of research.
evaluations for these kinds of
programs and so one, I agree
with LFC that we want to do that
well and make sure and and so he
referenced our attempt at
evaluation, and it was, we were
just unable to match.
folks because of the data
systems that didn't line up.
While also acknowledging that we
need to build that capacity.
Either within the legislature or
within the executive or both to
be able to do those things well
and so sort of not putting the
cart before the horse in terms
of asking for what could
potentially be onerous.
Requirements
That we may or may not be
actually able to to accomplish,
right? So being thoughtful,
because we do want to make sure
we're spending public money
well.
But also acknowledging the time
it might take to build that
evaluative capacity to the place
where we can actually come to
you, hopefully as partners and
say this is working really well,
let's keep doing it, or we tried
it, everybody did their best.
didn't get the outcomes that we
wanted, let's stop doing it.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair
and thank you for that
explanation. That helped a lot.
Appreciate the time, Mr. Chair.
Thank you representing me.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, thank
you for all of your expertise
and explanation, um, um, I have
just a couple of questions. Uh,
first, I do like the um.
And I've said it several times
in my couple of years here, um,
I, I get, I, I've heard
throughout the state how
frustrated uh Elias are with um.
The reimbursement process. So
the this um this uh perf fund,
the 3 years' funding is, is, um.
So
It opens up so many
opportunities to so many of
these school districts because
they get to plan on the money.
They get to actually develop a
program and then see and have
enough time without having to to
to play the game all um all
your, uh, every single year to
figure it out and actually see,
so I, I really do appreciate
that. Um, I do have a question,
uh, for Madam Secretary, um.
I know, gosh, I don't even know
if it was this interim or if it
was last interim, um, we had
talked with uh with PED, um, I
know you weren't there, but uh
hopefully someone can maybe tell
me, um, but, um.
Um, they had mentioned cause we
had we were asking about the
reimbursement process and why it
was taking so long, and you
would mention that um you were
understaffed at that point and,
and that's why it was taking so
long, um, are we still
understaffed or is it something
that, uh, hopefully we can kind
of
Um, maybe get stuff processed a
little faster. I understand it's
complicated, but.
Mr. Chair represented amid
Amoya, um.
was staffing, but it was also
the um.
Significant amount of federal
funds that were flowing through
the agency which um was a
significant amount more work for
our fiscal team.
For our program team.
And so it did slow things down,
but I am happy to say.
That, um,
We have um instituted some some
big changes we're tracking the
flow of money through the
agency, um, on a weekly basis. I
am actually looking.
At how much time it is taking to
process um all of the funding
through the agency team.
Um, we are well under our our
KPI targets.
process, um, we have a new sort
of um.
Technology tools that are
helping us move it forward. We
have been clear with all of the
staff that this is a priority,
we have to move funding through
here, we're in a very different
place than we have been in
different years, um, we're just
really tracking it, uh, very,
very closely when there are
barriers to moving, um,
contracts or other things
through, um, I personally get
involved sometimes the issue is
on the school districtarter
schools and.
Or uh or an REC and so we just
are that we're able to move that
money through, um, because we
wanted it out in schools where
it belongs, so I'm really happy
to report that I'd be happy to
sit down with you and share with
you, um, that the amount of time
is taking us to process our our
funding.
That's good. Thank you, thank
you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for
that explanation, cuz I know
that's a lot of times when I do
talk to, um, other districts,
that's probably one of their
biggest frustrations as far as
the money um and then you run
into having to keep cash
balances and like all this other
stuff, it's it's a, it's a mess,
so I'm so, I'm so glad. Thank
you so much. Um, the other
thing, um,
um,
Supports for students unhoused.
I've mentioned this before. I, I
just wanted to really quick, uh,
Mr. Chair.
Uh, just put a a a a little plug
in there. I, I really.
I liked, I got to sit in in that
um.
Presentation.
And um
And I can only think of the uh
several.
And there's plenty of kiddos
that come to mind through
through my my uh teaching in
high school that um.
I knew that they they through
many different reasons that they
didn't have a home. They were
couch surfing.
Uh, sometimes, you know, for
whatever reasons, either the
family didn't have a home or
just the child didn't have a
home, um, and when they were in
my class.
If I could get them there, they
were successful.
But there were so many things
that would keep them from
getting there.
And sometimes it's just
transportation, sometimes it's
just sometimes it's just, you
know, that there was so many
different things. It's chaos and
and all this other stuff, but I
really think that if it's
something that we can meet a a
physical need at that point.
With the requirement of you can
still have this while you, so
you come to school.
Just like with this pilot
program moving even those 1500
kids to a 90, I mean, cause many
of these kiddos very seldom do
they graduate.
I lose them their senior year. I
really do. I can kind of get
them there, the younger, the
younger years, but their senior
year, they have a lot more
freedoms and they have a lot
more choices and a lot more
attitude. And they're, they're,
they're not there and, and
that's what's what's very
frustrating because I know if I
could just get them in my in my
classroom, um, we can have them
be successful.
Um
So I think this is, this will be
really good, uh, a 93% rate for
those 1500 students would be
huge for our graduation rates,
because that is the that is the
the the major issue across the
state.
Um, so I'm, I'm excited to see
something like that.
Um
Mr. Chair, um, I just wanted to
say a little bit about.
Um, and it was something that I
didn't get to mention, um, last
Wednesday, so I'm glad we're
still on this subject.
Um, but, um, there was a, when,
um,
Mr. um
Sunny
Had mentioned the the difference
in discrepancy between.
Let's see, or not or the
differences between um LFC and
LESC's recommendations. It's um,
what is it lines 8 and 9 for the
changing of the SCG of the the
secondary, um.
Uh, base units, um, I just
wanted to say.
Um, I 100% believe that 6th
grade needs to be put up there,
but as far as with secondary,
um, I'm, I was looking in our,
cause I know we did it in our
wonderful little um.
Committee guide here and on page
45 is where we, um, we had the,
we were talking about the state
equalization guarantee.
And in here, it says that the
legislature has not modified um
in several decades, including
the basic pro program units, the
last were modified in 1993.
That's the year I graduated.
So, and I have been out of
school for 31 years.
Um, education when I graduated,
did not look like it is right
now.
Did not cost the same. Did not
like in in any, I mean, right
now I can't educate students
without a.
Laptop in front of them.
That's expensive. A quality
laptop.
Right now, many schools might
have a laptop, but so many of
these children are, are
frustrated because they're slow,
they don't work, they break,
they do everything and and
there's so many different things
that we get halted because we
don't have the funds to
correctly.
Um, pay for the things that
today's education.
Uh, requires.
Um, so, so having a formula.
Yeah, and I think what, 93,
correct me if I'm wrong, um, uh.
center, um, isn't that, that's
just the basic one, wasn't
secondary like even before that,
not, not changed.
I think I was 2. Representative,
you know, I'm going to look at
at Daniel and I would say 1970,
1976. Yes, Mr. Chair, I was too,
yeah, so that's how old I am,
um, but
But yeah, so I mean that's,
that's crazy when you think
about that, that we're still
trying to educate students, and
yes, we've tacked on, but this
is supposed to be a base
education.
For everyone.
And then we add on the special
ed and the and and the other
things, the other services that
they require. But are we really
funding that base education for
secondary students. And so this
is, um, so that those extra
units are really needed in
secretary, uh, secondary, uh,
and so that's just kind of my my
plug for that just so.
So the powers that be can hear
that.
Thank you, Representative, and
you're part of the powers that
be because we're going to have
that bill in front of us on
Monday, so.
All right. Next on my list, we
have Representative Lara.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
panelists.
Great information. You know I've
been kind of quiet over here on
Monday and Wednesday, but
today's today I have a couple of
questions.
Um
Mr. Chair, and uh I wanted just
to.
To a
give you my appreciation for
that, uh, project.
For students who are eligible
for McKinni Vento.
That is so, so important and so
critical. And one of the things
that I really appreciate is that
funding was flexible.
And they were able to use it how
how it was needed.
So, uh, Mr. Chair, I have a
question regarding that. So, uh,
Is this uh the school districts
are gonna have to apply.
For this money if they want to
implement this program.
Obviously they're gonna have to
apply for it, but how is, uh,
let me ask, uh, the department
or how are we gonna encourage
school districts to apply for
this money.
Mr. Chair Representative a lot
of, uh, thanks for the question.
So there is no bill associated
with this and so like a lot of
line items, if it were to
happen, it would flow to the
department.
And the department would be
responsible for administering
the funds. We have spoken to
staff at PED.
work with McKenny Vento students
already, um, and I think
Part of the
The process here might also be
potentially contracting with
someone who can help to
administer the program to ensure
fidelity to the pilot model, so
that students are are
Filling their part of the
requirements, but so that school
districts as well have those
those in that infrastructure in
place and so it would really be
up to the department to
communicate that out to
districts to make sure they're
aware of it, as well as
administer the application and
award process. OK.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
for that director sent out and I
saw that little footnote, the
number one on there.
So if it, you know, yeah, I
don't know if anybody has
already.
Started the initiating the
legislation or if it needs to be
initiated because it's, you
know, this is something that I'd
be very interested in, Mr. Mr.
Chair Representative Latta, that
number one in these particular
line items actually refers to
the legislation around
the essentially the enabling
legislation for the
For the transfer and and sort of
reshaping that person that
3-year fund.
Thank you for that. Thank you
for the clarification, Mr.
Sanna.
Uh, one other thing that I have,
Mr. Chair, is I'm also looking
for the, I'm looking at the
attendance for Success Act.
The supports
What exactly are those supports?
Mr. Chair Representative Lata,
thank you for that question. Um,
we have received funding over
the last couple of years, um, at
the department, um, for
attendant supports, this is
something that we've been, um,
including in the executive
request for many years, um, we
didn't get it 1st 1st year or
two and so, um, we are receiving
some funding and the the
majority of that money.
Let's go directly out to school
districts for them to determine
how to best spend those funds.
Some funding we use to um
provide technical assistance for
all.
Elie around chronic absenteeism.
Um, we have, um.
We that they uh uh develop
attendance plans, so we help
them with that. We host the
comments, we have our, um, with
the vast majority of that money
does go directly out to our
funds.
They may invest uh in technology
that helps them with early
warning systems or to
communicate with families when
students are not.
Um, showing up to school where
they reach out and engage them
and ask, you know, you're not at
school today, um, what, you
know, what's going on, some
schools higher, um, attendance
coordinators that work with
students that um have chronic
absenteeism issues or they're
engaging the families, finding
out what the barriers are, help
them to navigate and maybe get
access and they may need. So
those are different sort of uses
of the funding with increased
funding, um.
which I'm very happy about.
will allow us to do more, not
ever to get more out to the
schools to do that, really
important.
Because it is very much tied to
our student proficiency rates.
Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr.
Chair, that I, I, I'm so glad to
hear you say that because, you
know.
Even the school districts that
flexibility to do to customize
what they need to do to get
their students back into the
classroom is, is so important.
And uh Mr. Chair, Madam
Secretary, I'd like to ask. So
is there a way, or is there
something a a method or is there
a framework in place that will
allow
districts to share with each
other their best practices.
Mr. Chair represented Lata
absolutely, I think um.
Um, you know, we, um.
lift up those best practices
that we see around the state.
Um, uh, with our school leaders,
um, for me, it's really
important to be able to to tell
those stories, we do it in
committee, we do it among um
school leaders in our
communications that we have with
them, we.
can pull together groups of them
to work on specific issues that
they're interested in.
Um, there is a quite a bit of
interest across school districts
and charter schools to work with
the department on the attendance
for success Act itself.
Because uh they feel like
they're to that act itself.
Um, we work with CYFD it when
they report to our chronically
absent, so really trying to
improve those processes, um,
hearing from them about what's
working and what's not working
and then allowing them to share
ideas, I'll say one other thing
we have an opportunity this year
with the Permians strategic
partnership who is helping us
find a cohort of of districts
that are working together on
those, so we're getting uh.
ideas, weigh in, and then we
also have some some uh
contractors that are giving them
some additional support.
And so that sharing of best
practices is incredibly
important, and we definitely
that sort of work and everything
that we're doing.
Yeah, thank you, Madam
Secretary. I look forward to
seeing the, the results.
Um, I think it's critical, as we
all know about it, uh, having
the students in the classrooms,
and I think this is a this is a
great step forward for that.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Gonzalez.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, just
as a matter of understanding the
budget and what's in front of
us, I know we skipped down to
like 165, but just as a matter
of someone new coming into
looking at this budget, um, my
actual just question is from
lines 142.
163 just is that something that
just is in there as a matter of
accounting policy like funds
that are just that have already
been allocated that are just put
in.
Completion of the budget for
this year.
Mr. Chair and representatives,
that's a good question. Um,
there's a lot of line items and
so how do you bucket them and
categorize them.
The section you're referring to
are non-general fun.
Non-public education reform
fund.
funds. So everything else.
Uh, the section 9 appropriations
are separated out because those
are for 3 years, while
everything else you see on this
page is just for one fiscal
year.
Mr. Church just add a little
more clarification is you'll see
the the initials at the end of
those items, uh, those are
indicating the funds from which
that money comes for, comes from
to pay for these initiatives.
So for instance, online, let's
say.
140
That's, well, the first one, the
$150 million for safety, the
PSCOF.
the public school capital outlay
fund.
So each of those um
acronyms there sound stand for a
different fund, and that's where
that money is coming from.
Um, Mr. Chair, thank you for
that, um, those answers, um,
particular, especially when I
see a school in my district,
always wondering, you know,
what's going on within the
budget, is it particularly
refers to that, so thank you for
that clarification.
Thank you, Representative
Collin.
chair
Um
One of the questions I had is in
reference to the end-house
students.
The, um
The $500 payment. So those are
cash funds that are going to
those students.
And
into law, so I'm just kind of
going back to when I was served
on school and stuff, not being
able to give cash payments to
students or.
Are there
How are we working around the
law in reference to giving cash
payment.
Yeah, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative Cole, it's a good
question. Um.
To clarify
That, I mean, obviously students
are being paid. It's not
specifically to go to school.
That's part of the requirements.
I just wanted to clarify that
this is specifically for
students who are already qualify
under the federal definition of
homelessness, essentially.
Um, you're probably referring to
the anti-donation class.
And so Mr. Chair Representative,
there's an exemption in the
anti-donation clause for
indigency.
And so this would this would
fall under that exception.
Thank you
ask questions. All right,
representative Torres Velasquez,
please.
Um, good morning, and what a
wonderful presentation and I
really.
Like this resource, it's got a
lot of data and
Love Data
Um
I have to ask, I know that we
didn't talk about this today,
but we've talked about it during
the week.
Um, can you please remind me the
status of funding for the
Hispanic Education Act.
Um
Within any aspect of your
collaborations.
Mr. Chair, uh, Representative
Torres Vasquez, I'll take a shot
for all of us here. Um, without
running you through all the
lines.
I'll sum up this way.
For the current fiscal year.
There are, there are 3 $500,000
appropriations, the Hispanic
Education Act.
Black Education Act.
bilingual, multicultural
Education Act. So 3 different
line items at $500,000 in the
executive recommendation, there
is one line item.
For $1.5 million or the three
acts combined, so essentially
lumping together those three
appropriations.
For a recurring related
recurring.
appropriation.
LESC has a non-recurring line
item.
Also, at $1.5 million for those
three acts.
Specific to that line item LFC I
don't believe has any
recommendation in that same way.
Thank you, Mr.
Thank you, so representative
champion.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving
me a second bite.
Uh
I just went online, read the
legislation, so gives me a
little more to talk about in
the.
Secretary, I pray that you will
hang with me cause you know I'm
a
big supporter, but
When I, when I read the
legislation.
Page 4916 is one of the places
where it occurs, but it says.
that the uh
EFA
Governors
After consultation with with the
LESC and the LFC.
approve
And it goes in throughout the
document, what I see is after
consultation.
It does not say upon approval.
So it basically cuts out the
LESC.
The LFC
From approving the the this
funding is for sure, is that
true?
Mr. Chair, Representative, yes,
that's, that's correct. Thank
you.
That's all, Mr. Chair.
Great. Thank you others with
questions. OK, um.
I have a couple of questions and
again, thank you all for being
here and being willing to to
present to us over 2 days or 3
days in the case of our director
of LESC, um.
I have
So we've talked a lot about the
collaboration, which I certainly
appreciate um
And I'm glad represent Chatfield
brought up Senate Bill 201, um.
Because part of what we've
talked about, I've talked with
you, Mr. Liu, about it with
director Senna last year as we
were kind of talking about um
Grow funding and what would be
the future of it, and we know
that we have legislation now
that kind of further flushes
out, um.
Uh, the growth fund and the
accountability measures.
Um
And that grow.
I
Under the purview of LFC and
DFA.
Um, and I had raised the issue
last year about LESC, um, and
so.
Um
believe this is where the idea
of the perf and what we do with
the for fun, it's kind of.
Some of those conversations that
we all collectively as a
legislature had, um,
Around that is is that, is that
right?
You mean, OK, um, I just want to
make sure I get sort of the
history around it, um, because
we had talked about, you know,
if we're going to
Include LESC and to grow an
education program.
Have to go back and amend the
government Accountability Act.
Right, and to include the LESC
into it, um, and it seems like
now with the Perth, this is the
inclusion of LESC and the
perspective there, I guess,
where the rub is for me and and
the issue is that I saw the
draft of the bill, I guess, 2
days ago, um, for the Perth.
Um, and I've been chair of the
LESC for 2 years now.
And
And so I share the same concerns
as the secretary raised that if
we're proposing in our budget,
putting $150 million into the
Perth for programming to utilize
over 3 years and have this be a
process in which we're
evaluating funds and
And I saw the initial bill,
yesterday and apparently it was
an approved by um
yes, LFC um committee, so maybe,
maybe it was my bet on my part,
but um,
We
never really engaged in
substantive discussions as to
what that bill would look like.
And that for me, for me is
frustrating because here we are,
um,
In the midst of the sessions
were 2 weeks in, um, and we have
a bill that substantively and I
appreciate the inclusion of LESC
into this process because I
think it's very, very necessary
as I've made kind of my work
here at the legislature.
Advocating for LESC inclusion
into the budget process where
we're starting to see here, but
the evaluative process in
education in general because um
I've worked with the LESC staff
for
Some of you like my entire
tenure, my entire 11 years here
um at the legislature in
different capacities and I have
the greatest trust in um LESC
because I've worked with them
most closely, but certainly our
our our friends at LFC they've
been a part of the committee, um
for a year, a few years ago, um,
Why
My issue is.
That lack of inclusion. So I
guess I was wondering about um
Mr. Liu about the, the way that
bill came about and what sort of
the discussion was with
The folks on our side.
Because I honestly feel quite a
bit left out and for me that's
frustrating.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I'm sorry to hear that you felt.
left out of the process and we
will commit to including you and
your staff, um,
Or expeditiously in the future.
Uh
Your staff has been aware we
have been in consultation and
communication about this idea,
which
As you can see in both
recommendations, we are both
recommending 150 million.
Uh, to the public education
reform Fund.
For these 3 year pilots, there's
a lot of alignment in those
recommendations, uh.
As I'm sure you're all well
aware, counsel service is quite
backed up.
even our bill received changes
from proofing and
drafters there.
up until this morning, so.
Uh, there were delays in getting
a final draft out, but
I do want to assure you, Mr.
Chair, that your staff has been
aware about
At least conceptually, how the
bill is being constructed and a
Just if I could too, just add
that um.
Yeah, I think, I think Sonny's
right, um.
Obviously, we've talked, we
talked pretty regularly as
staff.
I, I will say when it comes to
committee endorsed legislation
as you well know.
It's, it's the committee's
prerogative and the chair's
prerogative what to bring
forward, whether or not.
We all agree, is is always a
question and I'll I'll point to
House Bill 63 is an example of
of another place where we have
Conversations about how 63
between both committee folks,
committee members and staff.
You'll see some, some alignment
in the family income index
portion of House Bill 63, as
well as the English learner
factor.
But then a divergence.
When it came to secondary. And
so I think part of this is
communication and then part of
this is each of the committee
members and committee staff.
Following the leadership of of
our of our committees making
decisions about what ends up in
legislation that other folks
agree with and, and some pieces
that
You don't.
And that's helpful to hear. So,
so what I'm hearing though.
Reading between the lines is
that this was a member brought
bill.
post for endorsement from LFC
and not a staff driven proposal
that was proposed by the staff
for committee.
endorsement. Mr. Chair, um.
There's a very gray area.
Related to
Staff versus committee.
Uh, direction. I think that
There has been discussion since
growers.
Enacted
To put accountability measures
that were in place last year.
Action to grow as a.
Sort of
Secondary reaction to that
proposal from the committee.
staff did bring up that LESC
needed to be part of the
process, particularly when it
related to education.
appropriations. And so the sort
of back and forth exchange
between staff.
And
Many members to sort of get an
understanding of where all the
issues might lie.
Resulted in a proposal to have a
perf.
Ro fun, essentially. So there's,
there's a bit of, um, I think uh
Discussion that happens between
members and staff as they
develop these recommendations to
further.
refine what the final
recommendations will be. I hope
that answers your question.
Yeah, um, it, it does, Mr. Liu
and
I guess, like if we, if we're
talking about inclusion within
LESA is part of what I'm
thinking and envisioning to
along the lines of collaboration
is having a bill that has the
endorsement of both or at least
the consideration of both.
Interim committees since it
would impact us on Eliasy
obviously our staff but also us
as members, I mean.
I
In the chair, uh represent Vla
as a voting member and you know
Amoya representrola has been um
advisory member and has
attended.
chair Garrett has been a voting
member and um we
Yeah, conceptually we've we've
talked about it.
But we haven't had a bill, so
I'm glad, you know, we'll be
able, I'm sure it'll get
referred to our committee and
we'll be able to evaluate it,
um, each and every one of us as
it comes through, um, but I
think that sort of involvement
in our continued collaboration,
um.
Especially as it involves our
interim process um I think it
would behoove all of us to go
through and have the
consideration of.
of both interim committees prior
to coming to the session.
Bill that we're trying.
Representative Chatfield had
enough time here. Um, um, not
listening to anybody else's
question, but reading the bill,
um.
But, but, but, um.
Yeah, um, to be able to actually
have time to to do that and
consider it prior to coming
here, um, would be much
appreciated um in the future
cause um we have made that
commitment and we've put it into
our our our respective budget
proposals $150 million but um we
also want to make sure that
The the functioning pieces of
what we're going to expect of
the school districts that are
awarded this money, um, are, are
things that we can do and that
we agree with.
Um
As well, so, um,
With that, I don't know if
anybody else had any other
questions. Um, again, we
certainly appreciate all of you
being here and walking us
through all of the issues as
they pertain to the budget, um,
and policy attached to um the
budgetary issues and obviously
uh HAFC is going to continue
their work in crafting the
budget, um, and we look forward
to continue working with you all
um, and with them on that
budget. Thank you, uh,
representative Lada, I know you
have
um a shadow you want to
introduce and then I'll have
some comments for committee
about next week.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, I do.
I'd like to uh welcome uh Miss
Melanie Sapero.
Monsieur, and MSU camp program.
You shadowing me today.
The pea is, is, is, um.
I
He's part of the NMC camp
program.
and uh
Director, you know, I talked
about this. Um, she is part,
she's part, uh,
The camp program is, is, is a
program that's intended for
children or farm workers.
Who are eligible for FASA for an
eligible for grants and and.
To continue their education. So
the program supports them the
first year, the first, the first
year, but consequently thanks to
state funding, it supports them
throughout their, throughout
their uh additional years in
school, and I'm very happy to
have her here today, and she has
other
Uh, uh, there are others that
are sharing some, uh, some on
the Senate side, but I just
wanted to welcome Melanie and,
and uh I hope you have a good
experience here with us.
Thank you.
Welcome to the House Education.
All right folks. So on Monday
we'll begin hearing bills. We're
going to have a couple of days,
um, where the theme is the LESC
endorsed bill, um, because most
of those bills have been over
the course of 2 years that
they've been vetted by various
stakeholders. We've heard about
them in the budget proposal
further consider them in the
actual bills um on Monday and
Wednesday. So we'll start at
8:30 here in the room, so please
be on time. We'll start at 8.
30 sharp, 8:30. Yes, um.
Yeah, well.
8 o'clock because if you've
noticed, we've had varying floor
times. So I figured to give us
enough time to evaluate the
budget, have enough time for
questions, we would start a
little bit earlier, um, which we
may have to do as we get closer
to the end of session, but I'll
always announce it so the
members are well aware of the
time, but please be here at 8:30
on Monday. So with that, have a
nice weekend, folks and we'll
see you on Monday.
Representrola, please say thank
you for giving us this week to
get ready with the budget, I
think I said it throughout the
week, but I think this is gonna
give us a a head start.
Even the worst this week, so
