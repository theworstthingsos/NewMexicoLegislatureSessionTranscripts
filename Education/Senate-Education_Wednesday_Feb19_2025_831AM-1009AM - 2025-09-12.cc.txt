counted out the math is power,
which is scheduled now for
Saturday from 11 to 12:30 in
room 322. That's the Senate
Finance Room, uh, conservation
was gonna be in this room, we
couldn't do it here. So I would
encourage people, uh, my
understanding is it's got lots
of great information about math,
why it's important, you know,
how we could elevate that as
part of our education
curriculums and things and then
it'll generate lots of good
discussion. So please share that
with colleagues, encourage them
to end.
public and everyone else. We're
very fortunate that Lane and
some of the other uh groups have
funded the ability for us to
have that.
Having said that, uh, we're
going through first the bills
that were rolled over from our
Monday meeting, and then we've
got 3 new business bills. So
with that.
00 yeah, I'm sorry, and we have
a couple of shadows to be
introduced. If you would please,
thank you, Mr. Chairman,
committee members. I'd like to
uh introduce uh Jonathan
Longoria. Um, he's very, he's a
senior at UNM who'll be
graduating in May, uh, hopefully
going to law school after that
and he's really just been
involved with
specific engagement uh with the
College Democrats and
indivisible Albuquerque, so you
just welcome him. He shout on
me.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh, I'd
like to also introduce my shadow
for the day and Helia Hill.
She's a junior at New Mexico
Highlands University. He's
studying political science and
is looking at potentially law
school, but she's keeping her
options open. They're welcome.
Mr. Chairman, thank you very
much, shadowing me this week has
been Miss Haley Biddegan, would
you stand up, please?
Hayley is a senior at Logan.
At schools. Uh, she will be
graduating and whenever she
starts up her next venture in
her life, she will be attending
college in Portland, Maine on a
on a volleyball scholarship.
She's done a really good job up
here. She's fascinated with what
happens up here and I do wish
our young people much success in
the roles they take. Thank you
very much, Mr. Chairman.
Wonderful. Were you a, are you a
middle hitter?
Outside hitter.
What
Middle hitter or outside hitter?
That was my role always too. We
have to jump twice as much as
everybody else.
Senator Figueroa.
Mr.
Chair, I wanted to introduce
Kylie Pucella. She is a
political science major from you
and and see how we do that here.
Welcome. It's always nice when.
have guests here in education,
people still working on their
educations and stuff. It's very
much uh who we are here in
education.
With
With that, Senator, whenever
you're ready.
Thank you, Mister Chair. They're
trying to get my expert in.
Um, by phone or by Zoom, but I
can start, uh, Senate Bill 314.
Uh, we do have an amendment, so
would you like the amendment
first or the amendment part of
what makes the bill relevant and
then let's move the amendment so
that we then are talking about
what we're really gonna be
voting on would be better. That
would be better.
So sorry.
I forgot.
Amendment 230991.2 be open for
discussion purposes. Thank you
very much. Thank you, Senator.
So if you would please explain
the amendment and kind of in
context with what it does.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, my um
expert who is the one who
brought this to me. His name is
Javier Sanchez, and hopefully
we'll get him on by Zoom or
phone eventually, but um.
Originally, the bill was written
to give an appropriation to the
Torrance County Farm and
livestock Bureau, and there was
a question about the uh
appropriateness of that or this
uh developed school curriculum
about a particular um.
History of.
Curriculum related to the area,
so in fact the amendment.
Strikes Torrance County Farm and
Livestock Bureau and inserts in
lieu thereof estancia municipal
School District and Mountaineer
Public School District because
that is the area that would be
encompassed by this colonious
history uh program.
And senator that it also it
looks like it changes border
regions, New Mexico State
University, to public education.
That's correct.
And then the number 3 section is
just a
The actual in the body of it
what was changed in the title.
Correct. Thank you. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Yes. OK, so.
I'm not sure that the audience,
you know, in is necessarily
needs to go out to them.
Committee members' questions
about the amendment.
Give you all a chance to kind of
to catch up and read through
what it does.
You've read through it or
comfortable with it. Somebody
will make a motion.
Adopt the amendment.
Move the adoption of Amendment
2.230991.2, the Senate Bill 314
and I'll thank you. It's been
moved in, seconded. Is there any
opposition to the amendment.
The opposition to the amendment.
Seeing no opposition, you have
an amended bill.
Thank you, um, Mr. Chair.
So, uh, going on to the
particular bill and I'm not sure
is Javier Sanchez on yet?
You're flying solo.
He says he's on the phone, can
you please unmute me.
Anyway, I will go ahead and um.
Uh, explained the bill, uh, Mr.
Chair members of the committee.
This is a request for an
appropriation to develop a
curriculum.
For a high school in New Mexico
course to be offered locally
that is focused on the
settlement of the lower Estancia
Valley from pre-Columbian times
through the modern era.
So this would be a particular
segment this wouldn't take over
uh a history course for the
entire semester. This would be
in addition to an incorporated.
OK, so, uh, Mr. Javier Sanchez
is unmuted and I'd like to
introduce him, uh, to say a few
words.
Hello, good morning all.
Can you hear me?
Yes, please go ahead.
OK, very well. Well, good
morning, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee.
My name is Javier Sanchez.
And I'm joining you from over in
the community of Ewing, which is
just southwest of Estancia
between Estancia and Mountain
Air.
Um, uh,
Senator Stefanis uh captured the
essence, uh.
Quite well, uh, basically what
we're wanting to do.
Is where.
The challenge is that uh
Many of our many of our young
people, as with young people in,
in a lot of places in rural New
Mexico.
Um, tend to view their
communities, their birth
communities.
As springboards as
As places of departure rather
than destinations.
And so what we're trying to do
is familiarize young people or
young people with the historical
precedent that has that has
birthed.
Uh, the world around them.
In other words
We're trying to use the past as,
as a window into future
imaginaries. We would like to
offer our young people.
Uh, an intricate understanding
of the landscape in which they
find themselves.
So that perhaps
They can imagine a future for
themselves in their birthplaces
and
Change the, the perspective,
alter their perspective.
And the idea is to influence
different outcomes, different
outcomes for the region.
And so using history in this
fashion is, is, is, uh, seems
like uh, like, like a good way.
To to offer these new
imaginaries that I'm talking
about and so
What we hope to do, we're we're
not entirely sure how it's gonna
fit, uh.
Uh, within, whether it's going
to be a standalone course
whether it'll supplement an
existing course that remains to
be kind of seen as the, as we
delve into the project and, and
developed it uh at the, at the
current stage, we do have a, a
draft uh syllabus for a for a
course, for a curriculum, we
have a, we have a budget in
place for what we think, uh, we,
we can, as far as the reading
material and all of these
different things.
But we find ourselves in a
particularly well poised to take
advantage of
A latitude that was, that has
been granted the local school
districts as a result of the
passage of House Bill 171.
From last year.
Which uh has given in in uh I
believe it's section G8.
Uh, of the 24 units required for
graduation, there are 2 units
that have been set aside.
Uh, for each local school board.
Uh, to, to develop as far as
academic content and performance
standards, so having spoken with
uh senior leadership over at PE.
We find that this is a very,
very good time, a very good
strategic time to develop a
course like this because it, it,
it, it would fit as one of the
two units.
That, uh, that, uh,
Local school boards and
governing bodies or governing
bodies of charter schools uh
could, uh, could, could develop
as part of the 24 units that are
required for graduation.
So, with, with, uh, the wind in
our sails, so to speak, we hope
to, we hope to proceed and, and,
uh, and uh
Utilize that latitude in order
to help our young people
understand the places that
they're from.
And uh furthermore, answer the
essence of uh the, the question.
Of that, that human beings ask
themselves the timeless
question, you know, who am I?
Where do I fit in this world?
And so that's kind of it in a
nutshell, uh, if, uh, you know.
Are there any questions for me
in particular.
OK, thank you.
Um, anything else, senator?
Uh, thank you, uh, Mr. Chair,
this is a bipartisan bill over
in the House Representative
Anita Gonzalez and
Representative Stephanie Lord,
who also represent parts of that
county are also supporting this
bill.
OK, thank you. Um, out to the
audience, just show of hands,
those in support.
And in opposition.
I wanted to come and speak.
Not um online, we have one in
support, Kevin Dunning.
Mr. Dunning, you have up to 2
minutes.
Mr. Dunning, if you're there,
please go ahead.
Uh, I, my apologies, Mr.
Chairman, uh, I inappropriately
raised my hand.
OK, thank you. Um, we have
questions from the committee.
Senator.
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, thank
you very much. I appreciate what
you're trying to do to keep that
history alive and well by going.
to get this done.
There is a concern, though I saw
on the FIR.
Under significant issues.
The 3rd line down states, the
indirect appropriation to this
entity may be in violation of
the anti-donation clause in the
mix. Is there anybody here from
PED Madam Chair, Mr. Chair,
Madam Chair.
Uh
Mr. Chair, that I believe that
comment was written before the
amendment, but I'm happy to hear
from PED. They're all shaking
their head, yes, so that did fix
the problem there.
I appreciate that that is very
rich history and I like what
they have added down here under
other substantive issues on the
FIR.
Whenever it says that 15.
100 farms, 15,000 farms had
female producers.
I love that.
Madam cheered that Mister Chair,
Madam Chair, I'm going back and
forth here. I I apologize for
that.
Like I said, it's important for
our young people to know about
the history of where they live.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Senator Figueroa.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, this is
great in that it gets at the
intent of local elected.
Um, which is the change in our
graduation requirements to make
it culturally relevant to our
students. It also gets at the
history intent.
To learn history.
In relationship to understanding
where we are and what our future
could be, as your expert witness
spoke eloquently about.
My questions are about the
amount and the process.
Um
And the FIR pointed out in the
language of the bill says for a
high school in New Mexico
history course.
That course already exists. It
has the standards in it that
would allow any teacher to
create and teach this unit right
now.
So it doesn't require a law in
order to do it.
Um, and it's pretty standard
practice for teachers, Mr.
Chair, to create units and teach
them as long as they're in line
with state standards.
So
In terms of creating the
curriculum.
I'm not sure why a bill is
needed, but if it's about the
funding.
Mr. Chair, I'm wondering if we
need to change line 22, because
I'm not clear, is this funding
needed to develop the
curriculum.
Which, like I said, is normally
done without.
funding, we write it, send it up
the chain, it gets approved.
Comes back down and we do it.
Um
Or is it about the materials is
what we're really after here if
funding for these schools to get
different and additional
materials in order to
So Mr. Chair, first of all, I'd
like to clarify, are we talking
about the FIR from 214.
I have
in front of me.
Um, yes, Mr. Chair, I'm looking
at the FIR from Valentine's Day,
that lists the New Mexico
history standards that would
allow this material to be
currently taught.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chair and
Senator, I'd like to have my
expert respond to the amount of
money.
Mr. Chair, Senator Figueroa.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
OK, very well, very well.
So, uh
Well, we would like.
So the amount of money that we
are requesting would cover.
Uh, the implementation, the
development will come from, from
a committee that has come
together to do this
gratuitously.
Um, uh, it's, it's more, it's
more focused on the
implementation and what we have.
Budgeted is enough, uh, so
there's
Well we sort of envisioned if we
could, if we could, if we could
uh have the maximum, right? If,
if we were to go for the maximum
of what we can do.
Uh, we would be talking about
Reading material, we would be
talking about salaries for
additional instructors we would
be talking about uh potentially
Uh, um, vehicles in order to
shuttle uh to do field visits to
some of the historic locations
in our area. We would be talking
about annual operating expenses.
To include printing supplies,
repairs, all of that.
We would also be talking about
presenters fees for uh local
experts to come in and, and uh
and present.
And so when we talk about
reading materials and the amount
of maybe 1212 books, a dozen
books.
That would be utilized for about
uh 100 students in each
location.
Uh, this is what we come to and,
and, uh,
Uh, I, we can't help but, but,
uh, but note that uh
Any, any, any individual
teacher, history teacher who
would be motivated to do this.
Uh, to take on this, uh, a unit
within a unit, so to speak,
would be, would be.
Overwhelmed.
At the, at the amount of, of uh
of resources needed in order to
provide an adequate
understanding of this history.
So
Well, we know, what we know is
that the current New Mexico
unit, uh,
does not mention
At all.
At all.
Any of the towns.
For settlements
Or personalities.
That have shaped our region.
Not even one.
Not even a one.
And so this is, this is
something that is.
Glaringly omitted from our
students' understanding and so
This is gonna require.
This is gonna require
significant resources and
significant effort in order to,
in order to implement and
We've got the effort, we've got
the effort, we have got the
effort.
But what we need is is is the
funding side of it and we don't
know how this is gonna turn out,
uh.
Precisely
Um, we, we would love for this
to be a standalone unit, but it
may not be so we wanna have, we
wanna have plenty of attitude in
the language of the bill and in,
in, in our scope of work, so to
speak.
Uh, to be able to, to, to have
flexibility and be able to
retrofit and achieve the maximum
result.
If that, if that answers the
and with that information in
mind, I think this bill might
limit Mr. Chair, the intent, um,
and I would propose.
Changing, making an amendment to
change the word develop on line
22 to implement.
They're talking about needing
resources and materials and
possibly books. We're talking
about implementation.
Um, and I wonder if that would
be a friendly amendment.
Mr. Chair, Senator, it is a
friendly amendment.
Would you like to formally make
that amendment.
Um, yes, Mr. Chair, I move that
page one, line 22 of Senate Bill
3 strike the word develop.
And insert in lieu thereof
implement.
And
Senator, wouldn't that also
require a change on line 12.
Yes, Mr. Chair, you are very
wise. Also strike the word
develop on line 12.
And insert in lieu thereof
implements.
Everybody understand the
amendment.
There were discussion on the
amendment.
Mr. Chair, our very wise analyst
has pointed out that in the
amendment we already passed.
On line 3
Or item number 3 says to develop
a
So all that we really need to
change is the title.
I would like to withdraw my
First Amendment and move a
different amendment.
On
bill withdrawing the First
Amendment. OK, we'll take that
off the table. Go ahead,
Senator.
Senate Bill 314 as amended line
12.
To insert after the word
developed.
And implement curriculum.
And implement
OK, Senator, that is a friendly
amendment.
Any discussion from the
committee about the amendment.
The opposition to the amendment.
Senator, your bill is now twice.
Other questions, anything else,
senator?
Um, the only other one, Mr.
Chair, is for the committee to
keep in mind, we changed the
graduation requirements to allow
local electives to be developed.
We need to keep in mind that
250,000 a pop.
89 school districts, we're
talking $22 million.
Coming at us in the future.
We're setting a precedent here.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Senator. Ques other
questions from the committee on
the bill.
The result.
Mr. Chairman, I don't have a
question. I just a million
dollars.
Or the appropriation 250.
$1000.
Towards every school district
comes to us courtesy of the New
Mexico oil and gas.
Thank you very much.
The other questions, I've got a
couple of, of questions or
concerns, um, and very similar
to what Senator Figueroa was
just pointing out is
Has this been proposed to the
local school boards?
For their funding in there
through their SCG.
Uh, Mr. Chair, um.
This has been discussed with the
school boards.
That were interested is
especially stancia and then
mountaineer and stancia uh was
interested and then they uh
superintendent thought there
might be some issues unless
there were extra resources. I
don't believe the topic of the
SCG was discussed at either
school board.
We have very small school
districts there. So, um,
mountaineer is interested and
willing sania uh is looking at
resources.
Thank you. And the senator, the
reason I ask is, you know, very
similarly is these are the kinds
of things that ought to be
funded through the district with
the district school board and
superintendent making those
choices and decisions. Um, we
woefully underfund schools
still.
Um, for several years I've been
trying to get a couple of $100
million allocated in the SCG.
Encumbered by laws by us, so
districts could make these kinds
of choices if this is a priority
for the district.
I worry and I do not think that
this committee once next year to
have 89 districts and actually
the larger districts would
probably have multiple, um,
Horses of this sort coming at
us, each asking for their share
of $250,000 so that they can
develop and implement their own
uh local programs. Again,
normally, teachers and as a
teacher, I very much did those
in my math classes is develop.
fun things, interesting things
for kids, um.
Field trips, yo, and those get
funded typically through the
districts if there's funding
available. Um, and I think we're
much better off.
Funding it at the larger scale,
so districts are making that
local decision and control
rather than all of them coming
to us.
you know, I, and I, and rarely
do things like this, do we say
no to and they go and sit in
finance and people have spent a
lot of time and effort, um, and
goodwill and nothing happens,
that we would be better off.
Adequately and fully funding
education and let local boards
and districts make those choices
if this is one of their
priorities. So, you know, I, I
can't support it for those
reasons. I think this is the
wrong way of doing it where
whoever has the legislative
clout, might be able to get it
for their district and the
others suffer, and we ought to
be doing this for all of them.
And so it's in no way saying
that learning this history is
not a good thing. I mean,
absolutely it is and for local
communities. I don't think this
is the mechanism for doing so.
May I make a comment,
uh, Mr. Chair, I believe that.
Individual land grants and
communities that have a long
history are not included.
And the curriculum that the
state and the school boards
determine.
And as an elective, I believe
that this will appeal to
families and children of
families that have some rich
history.
Um, that they would like to
encourage their children to
continue learning.
I don't believe that this type
of course would become a
priority for a school board.
And that is my concern, and I
totally understand planning.
At the larger level.
And I'm not an education expert,
but I do understand land grants.
I do understand the safe is and
this is unique to that this
community. Thank you.
Thank you, again, it's by no
means is my opposition against
the history or anything of that
sort. I just don't think this is
the way to, to fund education,
uh, implementation programs on a
piecemeal by district by
district, and by topic by topic.
So.
With that is there, the will of
the committee.
Mr. Chair, I move for a due
pass.
Motion for a due passed by
Senator Thornton.
Second by Senator, if you'll
call the role.
cinder boom
By the way, we had had a
request, please Ca your
microphone on and off when you
vote so that others are watching
and trying to record the votes,
so no, no offense to you, we've
all done that, but just so they
get it recorded. Thank you. I
forgot to mention that early.
Yes
Cinderel
Yes, Cinder Figueroa, yes.
Cinder Hickey
Yes
Center Nova
Yes.
Cinder Ramos.
Yes. Senator Thornton.
Yes. Cinder Pope.
No, explain my vote.
Sender souls. No.
We're, we're over here, she's
saying 8. I'm counting 7, that's
why we have the math bills, not
just the
I have both of 72, the bill
passes. Thank you. Thank you,
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee.
Oh yes, please, Senator, I
I apologize.
I voted no. I, I support what
this is. It's just the
mechanism, you know, just those
concerns there, so.
You'll move on, Senator and.
best of luck.
Next, uh, we're gonna have
Senate Bill 325, Senator Campost
Correction Substance abuse
counselor Ed, um, and if it's
quick, so you don't have to come
back, we'll jump down then the
Senate Bill 354 afterwards then.
So Senator, whenever you're
ready. Thank you very much, Mr.
Chair, members of the Senate
Education Committee.
Uh, in essence, uh, Senate bill
325 appropriates 500,000 from
the general fund.
The New Mexico Department of
Corrections for the purpose of
establishing and administering.
post-secondary education program
for an associate degree in
alcohol and drug abuse
counseling, the appropriation is
for the expenditure in fiscal
year 26 and subsequent fiscal
years.
Uh, in essence with this, this
would make the program available
to qualified incarcerated
individuals in all state
correctional facilities.
Public and private and Luna
Community College, uh, would go
ahead and develop the curriculum
and grant and associate degree.
Uh, to those individuals, uh,
and with that, basically, uh.
Mr. Chair, members of the Senate
Education Committee. This is
what this bill would do, and I'm
available for questions.
Thank you, Senator. Um, out in
the audience, those in support
of
Senate Bill 325?
Would you like to come to speak?
Anyone in opposition?
anyone online.
OK, so, questions from the
committee.
never at all.
Mr. Chair and sponsor, I'm
wondering why.
We are asking Luna College to
develop this course. It's my
understanding that this course
and certification already exists
at multiple higher ed
institutions.
So why aren't we just having
them?
do it.
Uh, thank you very much, Mr.
Chair. Thank you very much,
Senator Figueroa, in terms of
the uh curriculum for dealing
directly with our correctional
facilities, uh, this program
would go ahead and be developed
specifically for the uh for the
inmates, even though we already
have, if you will.
curriculum that is developed at
other institutions. This one is
gonna be very specific for
inmates, so that as they uh get
their associates and then move
on once they're uh sent back
into uh society, if you will, at
least they have the opportunity
to advocate for, uh, at the same
time, go ahead and uh uh become,
if you will, counselors to go
ahead and assist with the
addictions.
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm
No
I
yeah.
Thank you, Mr. Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you sponsor that is really
helpful.
Um, I wonder if the sponsor.
has seen the physical impact
report and the comments from
corrections that say it will
cost on their end at least
625,000 to implement this in the
corrections facilities. So is
the 500,000.
Meant entirely for the
development and then later we'll
do an ask for the implementation
or how does this work?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you very much, Senator for your
great questions as we deal
directly with this.
as a former president of the
Community College, one of the
things as we developed the
curricular, if you will, for
associate degrees.
Uh, the resources, of course,
would go ahead and cover that
and then the implementation
where you would find, if you
will, uh, additional
implementational costs would be
that if any of the uh
correctional facilities,
uh, decide to take this on
beyond whatever the resources
are that we can secure, uh, then
that would have to be absorbed.
Uh, possibly by the institution,
which would be Luna Community
College, uh, to go ahead and
form some form of uh tuition and
then also by the department in
terms of uh the classroom space
and and or other details, but
our intent is to go ahead and
work directly with the amount
that would project.
Thank you, Mr.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, sponsor, so the intent is.
Is this going to be a
tuition-based course.
Mr. Chair, and of course, uh,
Senator Figueroa to begin with,
it is not, but as it goes along,
as an example, if uh it does
take hold and we find that
there's gonna be the need for
additional resources, there
would be some form of tuition
either absorbents from the
institution and also from the
Department of Corrections in
terms of how they would help to
go ahead and defray some of the
additional.
costs for the implementation of
the program in the.
Thank you, Mr.
So
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, Senator for bringing this
bill forward. I think this is uh
Very important
Incarcerated and coming out.
Only helping themselves but
helping. Has there been any
thought to making this really a
statewide program.
A different institution and
really collaborating with
others.
I just worry about bigger type
of program.
Uh, so, so, Mr. Chair, Senator
Pope, uh, another good question
as we talk about the overall
evolvement of a program such as
this.
Uh, yes, there has been that,
uh, that, that discourse and the
thought process in terms of how
we can uh take this across, if
you will, to the entire
correctional, uh, system as well
as to all of our institutions.
So again with the behavioral
health bills that are making
their way through the
legislature if SB 12, and 3 were
to pass.
Along with that behavioral
aspect, there would be resources
available there. The second
aspect would be uh institutions
of higher learning that are
going to be interested in
helping to support a program
like this and to work closely
with the Department of
Corrections, they also would be
given that opportunity, but
again as we deal directly with
addictions and the type of
issues that uh we're dealing
with, if you will, by those that
are not incarcerated, the intent
is when we work from within, uh.
The individuals once they're
released and they go back to
their neighborhoods, to their
communities, uh, we find that
these are the individuals that
can really tell the story of
what drug addiction, uh,
alcoholism and the related uh
addictions, uh, continue to go
ahead and do to themselves and
to their families and to the
community, so another great
point, the intent is to
eventually uh create this so
it'll be uh in uh applied
statewide. Thank you very much,
Mr. Chair. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, Senator, and I think you're
right.
Folks who have experienced this
and they really have that lived
experience.
Uh, thank you, mister.
Thank you, Senator Thor.
He, um
Thank you, Senator. A couple of
questions. Ha, has this been
tried?
Before any uh Mr. Chair, and of
course, uh, Senator Thornton,
uh, there have been, uh, aspects
of this that uh have uh.
Been utilized, uh, but in terms
of the specific associate
degree, uh, we have not
developed that program to the
extent that we need to, so this
basically in terms of
Uh, courses and uh seminars,
discussions, uh, that has been
uh.
Implemented, but when it comes
to the actual associate degree
in terms of how this would work
internally.
Thank you. Um, thank you, Mr.
Chair, uh, Senator.
One of the things that I saw in
the in the fiscal impact report,
it referred to after uh an
individual graduates from this
program that they would be.
Uh, required like 3000 hours of
supervision.
Once they get outside, that's
like a year and a half.
And, and, um, who is gonna be
responsible for that supervision
and
I'm concerned about the $500,000
to implement the initial
program, but obviously there's
gonna be costs associated with.
After a successful program
implementing the supervision
required to support the program.
So, so, Mr. Chair and uh Senator
Thornton as we go forward as an
example, once the individual was
to secure the associate degree
and then they go back out into
their communities within that,
uh, through their parole
process, there will be not only
the supervision, but there would
also be, if you will, people
that would be in the behavioral
health.
Uh
I don't want to call it
industry, but in in in that that
spectrum of, of society, uh,
these individuals then would
offer, if you will, the
supervision, the guidance, and
the practitioner pieces that
would would also assist the
intent is not only to use this
part, but also to go ahead and
tie in, if you will, uh, the
behavioral health mechanism that
we're developing uh for our
entire state, but this is again
a re-entry piece that uh that
that would be applied in terms
of the
sources that uh would be
utilized uh the experts, the
supervision would be coming from
some of our existing agencies as
we deal with the the the
practicum piece once they get
out into a society to go ahead
and practice and become, if you
will, uh, addiction counselors.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Um.
Stick with that, uh, that's all
my questions.
Thank you, Senator Ramos.
Mr. Chair, Senator, thank you
for bringing this bill through,
but I've, I've known some
Some of the best counselors.
That have been incarcerated and
got into the behavior health uh
industry and and uh.
Or do we need them and uh you
know, their experience speaks
very, very well for him and they
do a great job and uh not only
that, but their whole heart is
into it and I, I think this just
could be a great program.
Hopefully this is a program that
uh.
We can
Talk about in the future and
being successful, we can spread
this type of program throughout
the state of New Mexico. So
thank you so much and uh that's
all I've got Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Senator Ramos. Thank you. Other
questions?
Question that I have, uh,
senator is typically new
programs, degrees, and things go
through the higher ed department
is the higher ed department
aware of this? and they weighed
in and what is their stance?
and, and you're correct that
usually applies to the four-year
institutions when it comes to
the uh to your institutions, of
course, working with uh HLC
working with the Department of
Higher Ed, uh, the curriculum
platform is developed and it's
submitted, if you will, for
review.
Uh, and consideration,
particularly for accreditation.
So within that, uh, the
information has been submitted,
uh, for not, not necessarily for
review. Again, it's all gonna be
contingent upon uh resources
that may be available along with
what uh could be developed.
Uh, but in terms of the full and
the uh extensive, if you will,
development of the curriculum
and the resources that are
available. It hasn't reached the
level yet where it has received
approval before the resources.
Thank you, Senator,
most community colleges are
funded with local tax dollars,
um.
Foundation, some other things,
uh, as the, at the regions at
Luna.
County Community College, are
they aware of this? Have they
supported this, you know, where
is, what is their stance and
have they looked at the local
resources to support it as
opposed to coming for state
resources. Thank you very much,
Mr. Chair, an excellent question
when it comes to the adoption
and the support of the mill
levy, and that's been uh uh
something that within this
particular region, uh, and Luna
Community College covers most of
northeastern New Mexico in terms
of the actual.
adoption or resolution, or if
you will, uh, going forward with
this as a specific curricula
that has not been considered by
the board of trustees, but it is
being considered by the
administration and by faculty in
terms of something that is
definitely needed, particularly
with what we're dealing with,
uh, with the addictions that uh
that we have.
Thank you, Senator, uh.
Is this going to be
Implemented in the corrections
centers and thus is it going to
have faculty going there or is
this going to be a distance
education
program. So it's a very good
point because it'll go ahead and
it'll be uh it'll be dual,
there'll be go, there'll be some
online, but.
The instructors also go into the
facility. Over the years as I've
dealt with different programs,
uh, we, we take the programs
into the facility and there's a
lot of the uh uh in class
instructional components,
however, with online education
today and then dealing directly
with uh a lot of the academics
it can also be done online, so
it would be a hybrid development
of uh the way instruction is is
uh submitted.
Thank you, Senator. The reason I
ask is Southern New Mexico
Correctional Facility is a long
way from Las Vegas.
Our faculty going to travel down
there to implement the program
there, or is this really geared
towards correctional facilities
in the northeast.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
This is, this is to go ahead and
start something that'll be
statewide.
The uh
Academic, uh, the, the, the
academic approach, the curricula
in terms of the instruction
itself.
It will be online and it'll be
in class.
Once this is fully developed,
the intent is that whether it be
Southern New Mexico, eastern,
western or northern New Mexico.
That this particular uh agenda
if you will or curricula could
be uh implemented anywhere, but
again, it's uh in its infancy
stage, uh, in this definitely
would go ahead and give the
start, and then from there we'll
see how it rolls out throughout
the uh and and Senator, I'm
looking on line 24, it says the
corrections department is going
to establish and administer.
This program, uh, and then with
Luna County Community College be
more just the fiscal agent for
departments wanting to do this.
I'm trying to understand how,
how the mechanism between those
two is gonna work. Who's getting
the money to do this, you know,
how, how's that gonna work?
So, so, Mr. Chair, first of all,
the resources would go for the
development of the curricula and
the implementation of the
associate's degree.
500,000 then goes to Luna
Community College.
Along with that, there would be
the coordination so if resources
are needed in terms of how to
implement this throughout the
correctional uh facilities that
that would be the coordinate
piece along with that, these
resources would be shared in the
development of the program, the
curricula, and more importantly,
in the uh the uh earning, if you
will of the associate degrees,
so it would go ahead and be uh
an effort between corrections
and lunar Community College.
And as has already been stated,
eventually to become more of a
statewide program, additional
resources in the future would go
to the Department of Corrections
or the full implementation, but
right now in developing of the
curricula and the implementation
uh, the majority of the
resources.
Senator, and I'm looking on page
2 on the last part on the
appropriation, says $500,000 is
appropriate to the general fund
to the corrections department.
Oh, the community
college, so it goes to them and
they then are going to contract
with the community college and
with Highlands. So, so, uh, Mr.
Chair, as we go forward, when we
talk about corrections, the
resources are there for that,
but Luna Community College would
go ahead and have the resources
and to implement, if you will,
the associates.
I
think I understand that's the
intent, that's not what this
says. It says this money is
going to corrections.
Yeah, and
And it it
Doesn't say that they
Have to go through Luna County
Community College is going to
grant the associate's program.
Islands is going to develop it,
but the money y'all is going to
corrections. It's not going to
the other two entities from what
I read. So, so thank you very
much Mr. Chair, as we deal with
it in terms of the clarification
as we deal with this, there
would be the joint powers
agreement that would go ahead
and be through corrections, and
it would go to Luna Community
College to develop the.
OK, Senator, I, that's not what
it says, so, you know, that
might be the intent, but, you
know, as you know, being up
here, words matter, but that
last paragraph on page 2.
It says
To for them to administer the
secondary education program for
an associate's degree.
In that it doesn't even talk
about it says to establish and
administer.
So again, Mr.
Chair and misunderstanding, and
I, I have no, uh, so Mr. Chair,
as we deal with it very
directly.
In terms of that, so the
resources here's here's
Department of Corrections,
resources goals for the
development of the associate
degree and the curricula.
And then the implementation that
would be the joint powers
agreement, even though it
doesn't say joint powers
agreement, there it goes to the
Department of Corrections.
their Luna Community College
would develop, if you will, the
implementation of what that
curricular and the associate
degree would be and then from
there the Department of
Corrections would implement that
throughout uh the correctional
uh department.
But in terms of the
instructional piece, that would
be through Luna Community
College.
OK, Senator, again, as, as I
read through it, it just says
community college will grant the
associate's degree, Islands will
develop the curriculum. The
money's all going to
corrections, so.
You know that I
I'm just trying to follow how
that trail might work because
it's not spelled out in what's
here. It sounds like, you know,
kind of a
You know, hope, hope the
corrections.
Follows, you know, what, what
others want, but the money seems
to be going to them to
establish.
Things and that they're the ones
that are going to be making the
other determinations. So, but I,
I'll, I'll leave it at that.
The other question, Senator
Rozel.
Mr. Chairman
Thank you very much, Senator
Campos.
I'm kind of bothered by that
language too.
Would on line 19.
Would where the words establish
and administer.
In working with the language
that Senator figure Figueroa
came up with would implement be
a better word?
Uh, Mr. Chair, and, uh, and
Senator as as as we deal with
it, implement is uh is a
friendly amendment if you wish
to go ahead and make that
change, and I, if I may just
quickly go back to what the
chair is is talking about as
well.
clarity purpose in terms of what
we're dealing with, uh, if this
bill was to uh make its way
through this committee, I'd make
sure that the uh outline the
direction and uh how this whole
purpose would uh uh.
would evolve. So thank you very
much, Mr. Chair, Senator Bell.
Mr. Chairman and senator.
That would solve a lot of
problem because whenever you are
uh.
Naming lunar Community College
and New Mexico Highlands
University for developing the
curriculum and providing with
the corrections department in
postsecondary education program.
That kind of spells out where
we're trying to go with this in
my opinion and.
It, it would have to be changed
in two places on your bill, and
I think that the first place it
needs to be.
it in there would be line 11
implementing a post-secondary
education.
by using the uh the uh community
college and the university
Island University.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to
see this bill go forward because
any time that we can keep.
Those particular inmates on the
right path.
And hopefully, reducing
recidivism, I think that that
might be a, a way, good.
And if the
Presenter of the bill is open
to.
Those changes.
I would like to see it go
forward.
Mr. Chair and and Senator Rizel,
uh, they're considered to be
friendly amendments in both
places, uh, but again, I, I
leave that to the discretion of
the committee.
Mr. Chairman, if that is the
case, I would like to.
Have an amendment to Senate Bill
325.
Line 11 striking establishing
and.
In lieu thereof.
Inserting the word implement.
And on page 2 line 19, striking
the word.
Establish.
And changing that to implement.
And that would be the crux of
that particular amendment, Mr.
Chair. OK.
There's a motion.
Hold on.
Thank you.
OK, let me, let me see if I have
this right, because Maryanne's
the one that's got to make sure
she gets the wording all right
here. So on line 11, we're going
to strike establishing and put
in implement.
On line 24, strike established
in and employment.
And then on page 2, line 19,
strike established and put in
implement.
Yes I have that correct?
And
Implementing
dramatically.
OK.
Yes, everybody understand what
the, the amendment is.
Any discussion on and my only
comments on the amendment is, I
still have a concern that the
money is all going to
corrections, not to Luna County
or.
The Highlands, which it sounds
like they're the ones that are
gonna be doing most of the
initial work where the
implementing actually comes
later, but
Mr. Chair, if I may respond to
that, uh, I will go ahead and go
back and work on that to to
assure the process and I would
get information to you as soon
as possible regarding uh what
that direction would be.
Though I might ask, and it, it's
really up to the committee, you
know, whether we want to send
you a way to to fix that and
come back.
On Friday with those amendments,
I would be much happier with it
rather than
Sending it on where we get a
chance to actually look at that
and make sure that we have it
right coming out of this
committee, but I, again, would
want to defer to my, my
committee members.
Mr. Chairman, I think that's an
excellent idea if that's.
Uh, the purview of what the
presenter would like to do to
make sure that there is a
correct bill coming out of here.
So, so, Mr. Chair and, and
Senators, all members of the
committee, uh, I have no problem
with that. The whole process
here as we continue is to
continue to evolve and make our
legislation better, so I
appreciate the uh the responses
and of course the direction.
Thank you, Mr. Senator at kind
of your choice whether you want
to come back with a different
bill that does it differently or
rework this one through
amendments.
Um, please let me know as soon
as possible if we can get you on
Friday starting to back up a
little bit. We had one bill just
got rolled over for Monday, you
know, kind of a, you let me
know, please. So thank you very
much Mr. Chair. I'll go ahead
and I'll follow up. It'll
probably be in the form of the
amendment unless it looks like
uh gets too complicated to do it
that mechanism that we have to
come with a substitute,
but I'll work on that today.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair
for your your understanding,
Senator, and
Um
It, it's being held in
committee.
Uh, so we're, we're essentially
rolling that over until the
sponsor tells me.
Um,
just for other people's notice,
the sponsor of Senate Bill 286,
the Education Freedom Account
Act as requested that that be
rolled over probably till
Friday, he's supposed to get
back to me today on that bill,
so we will not be hearing SB 286
today.
Um, Senator Campos, since you're
there in the hot seat, we're
gonna jump down to SB 354 Padre
Antonio Jose Martinez
documentary.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair,
members of the Senate Education
Committee and, uh, as we can
tell as we move along and a lot
of these things are worked, if
you will, outside of an SEG or
if you will, the ING for higher
education in terms of those
formulas.
Uh, but this one is, uh, is very
interesting, and I, I don't
know, I was looking to see if I
have an expert that would be
able to.
To assist to better explain as
we uh we deal with this if the
individuals are not available,
uh, I'll go ahead and I'll
proceed, but in, in essence, Mr.
Chair, members of the committee.
Centel 354 appropriates 200,000
from the general fund to
northern New Mexico College.
For the purpose of contracting
for the production of an
educational document documentary
on Padre Antonio Jose Martinez.
Uh, and so basically that's what
um what this bill does, Mr.
Chair, members of the Senate
Education Committee.
Fari Antonio Jose Martinez was
born in Abeu in 1793 and died in
uh uh in Taos in 1867.
He was excommunicated by
Archbishop Lamy in 1858, but was
fondly remembered by his
community thereafter.
For several reasons, number one,
because of his uh ongoing
commitment, if you will, to
helping to take care of the
poor, the community, uh, to
continue to go ahead and be a
community leader and those are
just some of the aspects of what
this would do.
Uh, in terms of the resources
and, and again going to one of
the community college or in this
case, uh, to Northern College,
which is a 2 and a 4 year
program.
Uh, the documentary would be
made, particularly because this
occurred here uh in northern New
Mexico and from there it helps
to go ahead and share part of
the history.
The individuals that are helping
to bring this forward have been
very much involved in past
documentaries throughout the
country and within that in terms
of the expertise that is uh been
brought forward the intent is to
do this at a school where
students would learn not only
how to make the documentary, but
also participate in its making.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you. I'm 354, those in the
audience in support.
Anyone in opposition?
Nobody online, so questions from
the committee.
Action from the committee.
Hello
I move we do pass. We have a
motion for a do pass from
Senator Pope.
Seed by Senator Hickey.
Uh, Senator Ezel, you have a
question. Go ahead, please.
Mr. Chairman, thank you very
much.
Again, this goes back to keeping
that particular area in tune
with what what their past was,
but will this be, let's see.
Will this be put out to other
areas of the state or is it
specific school?
So thank you very much, Mr.
Chair, and uh Senator Riel.
In terms of this, um, many
schools have been contacted.
In seeking, if you will, um.
support in terms of what their
film programs are.
how they would be interested in
helping to
Uh, support the making of a
documentary, uh, but in terms of
this, uh, right now, the whole
procurement process and the
fiscal agent would be Northern
New Mexico College for this
specific project.
Thank you very much.
Uh, Mr. T and Senator Compost
one will thank good uh.
Program going there at the
school for making documentaries
and.
Small films I'm, I'm assuming
that, is that correct Mr. Chair,
Senator is, uh, you're correct,
and one of the things that
Uh, I believe the president of
the board, uh, they continue to
do is to find ways to.
Uh, better involved the students
that do attend, uh, the northern
New Mexico College.
Mr. Chair.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Senator, I, I just have a brief
question. It keeps referring in
the bill. It says Northern New
Mexico state schools that
northern New Mexico State
College. Is it northern New
Mexico State College?
I haven't heard Northern New
Mexico State school. So it's
northern New Mexico College and
in that uh as the they first
began originated, of course, it
was the uh community college and
then from there is the uh sought
to go ahead and be recognized as
a for your institution, uh, they
went into the northern New
Mexico College and so that's
the, the official title, but
what I'll do is make sure again
that everything is consistent in
terms of that, but this is.
going according to not only the
drafters, but the school itself
in terms of what they're
referring themselves to.
Yeah, and so Senator, yeah, I
guess I would propose that we
use the official term Northern
New Mexico College instead of
northern New Mexico state
school.
As I looked at that, it's like,
am I missing one of them that
I'm not aware of. I think it's
Northern New Mexico College.
That's Chairman, you're correct.
And so if I can make an
amendment to fix that, we're on
line 12.
Instead of state school, it says
college. Drake State School and
say college, and then I think it
is also
And out of line 18 in the
northern needs to be
capitalized. New Mexico.
Strike State School and put in
college. I think those are the
only places.
Mr. Chairman,
Mr. Chairman, as I, I, uh, I saw
that as well, uh, a couple of
things that would be considered
a friendly amendment, but in
order for us to do this
properly, is there a way to
possibly bring this back with
the amendment with the, the
proper name.
I, I hate, I hate to back you up
in terms of the the committee
for further consideration these
are things where when you come
back we're 5 minutes to kind of
nod our heads and say yes, I'm
fine with coming back with a, a
nice clean copy of things
instead of doing it through the
amendment process, if that's
what you would like to do, sir.
Uh, Mr. Cherry again, going back
to the committee, I leave that
to your discretion.
You understand the work that
you're going through, and these
are technical issues.
Again, working through you, I
want to make sure that we do
have uh
Bills that are that that are
clean as we move forward and,
and they also state the intent.
I'm comfortable doing it either
way, committee.
You wanna send it back or do it
right now?
OK, we're gonna send you away to
come back with, with that
correction, because I don't
think we have a northern New
Mexico state school and, and Mr.
Chair, members of the uh Senate
Education Committee. I really
appreciate your due diligence,
understanding, and again, I
apologize for the time taken and
we, we should have been
a lot clearer apologies. That's
part of what the committee
process is for is to get a whole
lot of heads and, and eyes
looking at things so we get
things right. Thank you, Mr.
Chair, members of the Senate.
Yes, so we will hold this in the
committee and it'll be rolled
till Friday.
Yes. Thank you very much.
Anden provided he's able to get
it done by then, I suspect we
will, but yes.
OK, Senator Figueroa.
And again, for anybody watching
anyone in the audience, we are
not going to be hearing SB 286,
the sponsor has requested that
that get rolled over, probably
to Friday, but he is supposed to
get back to me today.
So Senator Figueroa, SB 345.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
committee SB 345 has a couple of
changes.
To the teacher licensure section
of law, um, if you look at.
In the bill itself.
Bottom of page 2.
There's underlying new language.
For licensure that a teacher has
passed that New Mexico teacher
assessments or the New Mexico
teacher portfolio, this is
already being done, it's not
new, it's just putting it into
the statute, teacher portfolios
are used, especially in the
alternative licensure path.
Um, the truly new language is
page 5.
And that is reciprocity.
Agreements for instructional
support.
Providers who are licensed in
other states and are LESC.
Analysis.
And the FAR in our committee
analysis, yeah I'll give you a
pretty good list of who an
instructional support provider
is. These are EAs, school
counselors, social workers,
nurses, speech language
pathologists, audiologists, etc.
By adding section C on page 5.
We allow folks who come with a
license from another state in
these areas.
To get a reciprocal license in
New Mexico.
Allowing a local superintendent
to require mentorship.
I'm requiring that they
demonstrate the competencies.
And meet any qualifications, but
it's a reciprocity, and if you
compare a paragraph B.
To paragraph C, you'll find
their parallel.
These are the same reciprocity
requirements for teachers.
I'm sorry, paragraph A.
To paragraph C.
So with that, uh, Mr. Chair will
stand for questions.
Thank you, Senator.
Do we have anyone in the
committee room and support of
Senate Bill 345.
You got some hands up. Do we
have any opposition?
All right, if we could have a
few folks that come up.
Public comment. You have 2
minutes.
Please, uh, state your name and
if you represent an
organization.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee. My name is
Greg Frosted. I'm assistant
secretary of Education for the
publication uh for the public
education department and we want
to thank the sponsor for
bringing this bill forward. We
strongly support it and urge you
to move it forward. Uh, this
bill will help with making sure
that we have a more teachers and
more diverse teacher workforce
and also support some of the
instructional support providers
that we have, um, we have a
severe shortage of
Many types of instructional
support providers, including,
uh, speech language
pathologists, occupational
therapists, and others, and we
believe that this bill will help
with that. So thank you very
much.
Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee stand rounds for the
school superintendents coalition
of Educational Leaders will echo
Greg's comments. I just want to
point out that to get these
licenses in other states, they
go through many of the same
hurdles, in fact, for speech and
language pathologists is the
same nationwide, uh, this is an
important uh uh.
Fixture that we need to put into
our system so we can in fact
recruit from out of state and
easily place them where they
need to be. We thank you for
your support.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee, Joe Guiha with
the New Mexico School Boards
Association for all the reasons
stated, we support the the bill.
We feel that this will certainly
help with uh retention and
recruitment and uh we thank the
sponsor for.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, Matt, Paul from
Public Cha Charter Schools of
New Mexico. We support the bill
for all the reasons stated, um,
a number of our charter schools
have had challenges with for
from uh instructional support
providers and sometimes
administrators from the state of
Colorado and others, and I just
say that we think the sponsor
from the for this, and we hope
it's the beginning of a larger
conversation about uh teacher's
licenses and reciprocity. Thank
you.
Thank you.
Good morning, Chairman and
members of the committee. My
name is Whitney Holland,
president of the American
Federation of Teachers New
Mexico. I urge you to support
this bill because it removes
unnecessary barriers for spying
educators while maintaining high
professional standards. This
approach expands access to the
profession, values diverse
teaching experiences and helps
address educator shortage areas.
Please vote yes to support a
fair and effective pathway.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Mary Par Sanchez, and I'm the
president of the National
Education Association in New
Mexico. We stand in strong
support of Senate Bill 345 for
the reasons listed, uh, I
represent teachers outside of
Albuquerque and I had an
educator in Roswell who, uh, her
first language was Spanish, had
spent thousands of dollars
invested in the Prax test to, to
Become uh get level one license,
had there been an alternative
pathway, she definitely would
have not had to spend thousands
of dollars to retake and retake
the test. So I think just like
with students, sometimes one
standardized test score is not
sufficient to um look at the
overall quality of what a person
brings to the classroom or or a
student, so I urge your support
and thank you very much.
Thank you. And online we have
Eli Cassas.
You have 2 minutes.
Good morning, Mr. Chair. Good
morning, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee. My name is Eli
Cassa and I'm an educator of
over 16 years, having served as
a teacher, principal, and
currently the manager of policy
and programs for Teach Plus New
Mexico.
Thank you for the opportunity to
provide uh public comment today
in support of Senate Bill 345.
As a school leader, I have seen
firsthand the challenges that
educators face in entering the
profession, and I believe this
bill takes a crucial step
forward toward addressing these
barriers while maintaining
rigorous licensure standards.
This codifies uh current
practice while ensuring multiple
ways to demonstrate competency,
and research shows that
licensure exams are not the sole
measure of teacher
effectiveness. Portfolios offer
a more comprehensive
performance-based evaluation of
readiness, and additionally, SB
345 helps to fill critical
vacancies in our schools, while
maintaining high standards for
professional qualifications by
clarifying reciprocity and
codifying processes for
instructional.
support providers that include
counselors, speech language
pathologist, pathologists, and
other specialized roles, which
will help address shortages in
these key school roles in our
schools in New Mexico.
This bill is a win for our
schools, our students, and our
future educators. It supports
aspiring teachers by providing
flexibility and demonstrating
their qualifications. It reduces
administrative burdens
associated with licensure and
then ensures New Mexico schools
have access to highly skilled
ISPs. For these reasons, I
respectfully urge the committee
to support Senate Bill 345.
Thank you for your time and
consideration.
Thank you, and there was no
opposition in the room. Was
there any opposition online?
There's none, so
I still want to give you an
opportunity if there's anything
left out in your presentation.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chair, there
was, and I need to conclude with
that to be clear with the
committee and clear with the
public that is listening this
reciprocity piece refers to the
educational license for ISPs,
instructional support providers,
but there are many ISPs that
also require an additional
license.
Possibly a medical license, for
example, a nurse needs a nursing
license, an occupational
therapist must have an
occupational therapist's
license, etc. So if those
professionals come in from
another state, this reciprocity.
Um, recognizes their educational
license from that other state
and offers up the reciprocity
for an equal educational license
in New Mexico.
It does not provide in this
statute reciprocity for the
medical or the additional
license they're required to
have.
So this piece of legislation
will be more impactful. It's
effect will be multiplied
significantly, um, if
We choose to pass some of the
compact bills that will
recognize some of those
licenses, uh, from other states
as well.
That needed to be clear about
that piece.
Thank you, Senator. We will now
go to the committee.
Any comments or questions we
have Senator Riel.
Mr. Chairman, thank you very
much, Senator Figaro. I
appreciate what you're trying to
do here. We do have families
that do transfer in these
families do need.
To be able to get up and
running. I understand that.
I need clarification on
practice. I don't understand
what that is, is that proof the
federal level or?
Explain to me about that. I'm,
I'm not informed.
Mr. Chair and Senator Prax is a
teaching exam in various subject
areas and then general teaching,
it's one of the exams that uh
teaching Canada can take for
licensure. They usually have to
take multiple parts.
Um, for example, secondary
licensure requires the general
ed, a secondary science, um, it
has multiple pieces, but Prax is
the company that makes the exam.
Thank you for that explanation,
Mr. Chairman and Senator Figaro.
I'm reading here in the FIR that
it's used by 46 states in DC.
And this does replace the New
Mexico teacher assessment.
It is the form we are using now
and I'm gonna ask.
The expert here to correct me if
I'm wrong, but I believe we use
practice for all of our exams at
this point or almost all of them
if you could please introduce
yourself. Sure thing. Good
morning, Amanda Debell, uh,
deputy secretary for the
Department of Education and good
morning, Senator, thank you. Um,
it is true we use Praxis um for
the exam for um what is done
currently and so we would be
matching, um, what is being done
across many other states.
Mr. Chairman, Senator Figaro,
Ms. Bell, thank you very much,
but I'm assuming that this does
come from the federal, federal
guidelines, is that correct? Am
I?
Or is it
Specific too. Yes,
and senator, it is a state. It
is uh what we have decided will
be for our practitioners and
education. OK, thank you very
much for that, too.
Add to that clarification, is
the name of the company.
Oh yeah
That clears up a whole bunch
then, OK. Thank you very much
for that. I thought something I
had missed something over the
years, uh.
So the my question there has
been answered.
I am concerned about one of the
analysis from the Department of
Public Safety, Mr. Chairman and
Senator Figueroa, I did not
realize that New Mexico is not
part of.
Uh
National Crime prevention and
privacy Compact.
And so there's would still be
the issue with fingerprinting
for the background check.
How onerous do you see that as
far as?
These people coming into the
state and being able to just go
right into work.
Mr. Chair, it can be onerous and
can take weeks, um, but it has
to be done.
So, Mr. Chairman and Senator
Figueroa, what would it take for
New Mexico to be.
Part of that compact.
And, and the reason I'm asking
that.
I have to have a background
check done.
And I'm not a criminal. I want
people to understand that right
up front.
But for me to have a certain
license you're in the state of
New Mexico, I do have to have
the fingerprinted.
And have a background check done
and I cannot use that particular
piece of identification to go
through the security port at
any.
In the airport, even though it
does have my picture on it and a
birthday.
And to me
That supersedes what my driver's
license does, so I'm kind of
confused there, but that's just
another issue I will pursue
further, but what would it take
for New Mexico to be part of
that background check done.
Where people can come in and
just go right to work because it
is needed.
Mr. Chair, I am not familiar
with that compact. I joined the
senator and as being one of the
people who's required to get the
background check and
fingerprinting in my profession
as well, um, and I did not know
that that compact existed until
I read this analysis, so Mr.
Chair, I'm gonna offer here
publicly to pursue that with the
senator as something potentially
New Mexico could join and
alleviate this burden for
folks in the future.
Well, Mr. Chairman, Senator
Figueroa, the reason I'm
bringing that up is many years
ago whenever I served on the
House Labor Committee, that was
one of the issues whenever there
was a concern from especially
the teachers unions.
On hiring somebody, say in the
superintendent's role or a
principal's role of the school
that there could not be any
background checks done.
Until it got down to the final,
whatever the cat might be, the
final 5, I guess if you want to
call it something like that. I
can't remember for sure that
particular number.
And it was very troublesome to
me that this wasn't taken into
account first because they would
have done the interviews.
And that person that might have
been in the top 5 for
contention.
Might show up as
Some evil person.
And so
At that point, I did ask this
question why that background
check was not done first.
So
I would like for PEED.
Why this practice hasn't been
adopted by the state of New
Mexico because it would be a
benefit.
To the school systems in the
state of New Mexico.
That's just me though.
But Mr. Chairman, I will let it
go at that. I understand what
this bill is trying to do.
And I think it is very good, but
I just don't like it being.
Taking weeks because I know what
a fingerprint chick.
Just do.
Well, thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman.
Thank you Senator, and just want
to assure members I got my uh
substitute teaching license a
couple of years ago.
even got the license?
This is someone coming from a
person who had a
Top secret SCI clearance and
government, so I, I will say PD
is doing their job. Senator
Souls.
Thank you. Um, my question on
the bottom of page two, where uh
says for a level one license has
passed the New Mexico teacher
assessment examination, we're
taking out examination and
putting or a New Mexico teacher
portfolio.
Typically that is in there to
show content.
Uh, competence, not teaching
competence.
How would someone typically
people who don't pass that, it's
in the math area, no surprise
there from some of our prior
conversations. How would someone
show confidence in math through
a portfolio?
I will let the expert witness
address that, Mister Chair. It's
true. Yes, Mr. Chair and Senator
Souls, um, for this and a math
endorsement would still require
an examination. Um, and so it
would just be to get the initial
level one licensure for teaching
that that can be demonstrated
through a portfolio that would
be done during the time that a
candidate is actually in an
educator prep program, so real
time this the candidates are um
being assessed on their
performance.
in
Mr. Chair,
An expert I'm thinking about
someone's gonna be a 4th grade
teacher.
And they can't do 8th grade
math.
And therefore, they're not
passing the test. How would they
demonstrate that they're capable
of doing elementary licenses
through 8th grade. How would
they demonstrate through a
portfolio that they are able to
do 8th grade level math. Yes,
um, senators, um, chairman and
Senator So, I think that we are
working with the educator prep
programs so that we have a very
tight rubric on the um display
of competency for specific
content requirements and um the
rubric, it will go through the
PP.
Yes see, um, as it is rolling
out, and that will be done
through rule.
Thank you. And part of the
reason I asked, I had been in
the teacher prep programs at New
Mexico State and regularly
students who were unable to and
didn't spend the time to learn
to do the math, would try the
test once or twice and then the
dean would just wave it.
Uh, I was very concerned about
that.
Uh, because, you know, the
comment was often, well, they're
gonna be really good with
children.
Well, that's more of the
teaching side of it.
I want people who are good with
children, but I also think every
elementary teacher ought to be
competent through at least 8th
or 9th grade math.
Yet that was waved away and
essentially using a portfolio
type of mechanism.
I don't understand how we can
assure
The, the, they all had passed
the math 111, 112, but having
taught at universities, and most
people have, you know, if you
show up to class every day, it's
hard to flunk a class. You know,
even if you're not completely
competent in it. And so I just
have a concern with, you know,
how in some particular areas,
you know, we're going to show
competence and math tends to be
the one that is often waived,
again, you've heard my comments
before in society somehow, you
know, it's OK to not be good at
math, but nobody would.
would dare let a teacher go
through who wasn't able to read.
So
Please try and assure me.
Chairman and senator Souls, we
can assure you that the the
content area instruction, um,
and knowledge will be there in
our candidates, um, the the
option also will be there for
candidates to take the what is
currently the praxis exam, and
it does not take away from the
requirement for the science of
reading exam that is outside of
this, um, this work.
OK, thank you. I'll continue to
watch cause I don't understand
how you can demonstrate math
competence through a portfolio
without having to actually do
math problems that are either
right or wrong.
With answers, so thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Do we have
any other questions or comments
from the committee?
All right.
What is the will of the
committee on Senate Bill 3.
We have a due pass by Senator
Novin a second by.
Senator
Senator Boone.
Yes.
Cinriel
Yes, Ciner Figueroa.
Cinder Hickey
a novel?
Yes, Center Ramos.
Senator Thornton
Yes.
Pope. Yes. Tinder souls. Yes.
And Senator, you have uh a due
pass
7 and 2 excuse.
Congratulations. The next step
will
Have our last meal of the day, I
believe, and this is gonna be
Senate Bill 344.
A for vision and hearing
screening.
By Senator Souls.
Thank you. This is a pretty much
straight appropriation bill. Let
me give you a little bit of
background about it in that if
children can't see and they
can't hear, they can't learn,
um, and therefore it's incumbent
upon us as educators to ensure
that we are screening all of our
children to make sure that they
can see and hear appropriately
and make referrals on for those
who show difficulties, uh, there
has been a pilot in the state
that has been funded outside of
the public.
Education department and the
legislature that has shown great
promise in being able to quickly
screen and provide a database
for how many is there, uh, and,
um.
Y'all know I stand rounds. He
has been working with that
outside provider. It's now time
to try and scale it up
statewide, uh, for a small
amount, $2 million which in the
big scheme of the budget is very
small to ensure that all
children are screened so that we
then can make referrals to
healthcare and others to deal
with that so that they're able
to take advantage of the
learning and so.
rounds. Mr. Chairman, I'll make
my comments short.
Over the last 18 months, we've
had 14 districts take this proof
of concept into application in
their districts.
All of those were rural
districts and the reason for
that is the edge on this is, is,
is the right thing is that rural
districts have considerable
difficulty in meeting the state
requirement in screening, vision
and hearing.
It requires a nurse in most
cases or nurses assistant.
Uh, in most rural districts, you
might have a nurse one day a
week.
So the idea was to remove that.
Using a, using technologies with
existing equipment.
The software
And in fact, we found that the
screening was better than human
screening was, um, and the
hearing part also will be uh.
Available here immediately be
coupled with the vision
screening.
Uh, so it was a proof of
concept, every district was
supportive of it. It's something
we recommend go into the system
of $2 million over um a couple
of years is, is a good way to
get the next nudge into this,
uh, for, uh, for the state to
contemplate making it statewide,
those dollars would allow it.
stay wide based on the proof of
concept that we did over the
last 18 months. We'll stand for
questions.
Thank you.
Do we have any supporters of
Senate Bill 344 in the room, if
you could raise your hands.
Do we have any opposition?
Right, those in support, if you
can line up and if you, if you
would like to make a public
comment, you have 2 minutes.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Gloria Doherty, and on behalf of
the New Mexico Nursing
Association, school nursing
association and the New Mexico
Nurse Practitioner Council, we
stand in support of this bill to
take care of our kids.
Thank you.
You missed, uh, urs Clough,
superintendent Corona Public
Schools.
In one of those rural
superintendents and Mr. Round
referred about. I had a day of
nursing to my district this year
just to meet the hearing and
screening because the rapid
growth of our kids coming in.
I was not part of the pilot, so
I was kind of at a stand and he
didn't bring it to me in the
first place, but I was I came on
board late on this because of
what happened, that's the
excuse, but being in a rural
district and having come from
Hagerman, having dealt with Mrs.
Ael on this issue before. It's
very important for us,
especially with a lot of influx
in our area with new people
coming in from outside of state,
new students, so we have no idea
who those kids are. I greatly
support this effort. We would
definitely implement it and
would help me assure that I have
full nursing services that every
kid is provided for that walks
through my door.
Corona schools. Thank you.
Thank you.
I don't believe we have any
supporters online or any
opposition.
So unless there's anything else
you need to state.
Senator, we're good to go. So
any questions or comments from
the committee?
Senator Isel was up first.
Mr. Chairman and Mr. Chairman
and Mr. Rounds, thank y'all.
Today this is very important. My
husband is selective hearing
which I'm sure most white.
I just had to point that out,
Calder, in case you're
listening, OK, uh, I'm seeing
that this is kindergarten
through.
4th grade, but you.
Any remaining ballots will
revert. Can you tell me why that
is in this particular bill.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator
Uzel, by the way, being another
one of those people that has was
born in the last century and by
the way, I'll remind both of us
we also were born in the last
millennium.
which kind of hurts, um, and,
and we're, we can't, we can't
solve the selective hearing
problem. I've been one of those
people that.
Uh most of my life, but, but.
The reason this is focused on K4
is on our current statute
requires us to do screenings
from K through 3. This picks up
the 4th grade edge that we think
is considerable.
Again, uh, and, and, and pays
for that. The reason it reverts,
uh, uh, Mr. Chairman Senator, is
because uh this is specifically
purposed.
Designed for the cost.
We're not assuming every
district will implement the
statewide. The money is
sufficient for that, but should
that not occur, the right, the
right thing to do.
Is to revert that money of
course I'd prefer that revert to
be used into the future, but uh
I guess I'll stop my uh.
Comments about how best to.
Handle leftover money.
OK, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator and
Mr. Rounds
Uh what about Medicaid whenever
we're talking about these
particular.
Young people that might need
help there.
Uh just me Medicare, uh they do
any type of screening for
hearing and vision.
So Chairman Senator, thank you.
This is very important to
understand this is the screening
side.
That's done by law and that's
usually non-mediated
reimbursable although it could
be under certain provisions.
Uh, the Medicaid is more for
them the service side where the
need exists. This doesn't have
any influence except it does do
the screening that would then
move them to the next
professional level for
intervention for glasses.
We hearing. OK. Well, Mr.
Chairman, Mr. Chairman, and Mr.
Rounds.
Right now I've done a little bit
of look into this because I
understand hearing aids as well.
Oh
There's over 3 act and I didn't
know if.
The screening by this as
Medicaid for help for these
students.
Mr. Chairman
I believe the answer is no
unless it is done by a school
nurse, we're trying to allay
those costs.
By doing this, so I'm not
certain that this would apply to
the Medicaid reimbursement, it
might.
I will research that for you.
That's not the purpose of this
plan. This is for the
identification side.
OK, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,
Mr. Rounds, thank you.
Any other questions or comments
from the?
Senator Figueroa.
Mr. Chair and Stan, I'm
wondering about the 2 million
goes to PD and you've talked
about using technology.
Relieve the burden on the humans
for this, and then adding the
hearing screening.
Uh, but
Bill itself doesn't mention
districts, how you, how they are
going to do this.
Or do the school districts apply
for a grant and say we want to
do it this way, send us the
money, how does that work?
So Mr. Chairman, the reason we
chose the public education
departments because we believe
they are the best recipient
because we are not we feel like
that's centralized we trust.
These the public education
department to
Work with us on the
intentionality of this.
Um, and, uh,
I know Greg's here and and the
rest of the folks.
So that's we we believe that the
fund should pass through them,
go to schools.
Uh, most probably on a
reimbursed basis.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. That was
my only question.
I don't see any other Senate
Bill 344.
Move a path
Uh do pass from Senator Figueroa
and a second from Noma.
Sender Boone
Yes
Cindriel
Yes, Cina Figueroa, yes.
Siner Hickey
Signature Nova.
Yes, Centurramos.
And
Yes
Pope. Yes.
Pope
cinder. Yes.
you have a new pass, I believe
it's 7 S's and 2 excus.
Congratulations and
Let the chairman come back up
and.
close us out.
Thank you. And, and first, thank
you team. We got through partly
because we had a couple of
rollovers, but we got through
things, um, and so.
I had known ahead of time, we
could have started at 9 instead
of 8:30. I apologize for, for
that portion of things, uh,
because we've got some
rollovers, we are going to start
at 8:30 again on Friday, uh, I
think we've got a pretty healthy
agenda now as a result of that.
I also would like to remind
people about the movie screening
on Saturday in the Senate
Finance Committee room and it's
open to the public. Uh, it's at
11 o'clock. It's very much about
math education and the
importance of.
and things of that sort, please
encourage your colleagues to
attend. Uh, any other comments,
questions, announcements.
If not, thank you all and we are
adjourned.
