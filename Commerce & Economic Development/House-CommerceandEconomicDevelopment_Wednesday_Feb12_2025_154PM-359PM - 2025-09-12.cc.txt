Serato.
Madam Vice Chair.
Here,
Madam Madam.
Thank you.
All right. Well, we'll go to HB
14, uh, Chairman Lin, you have
the floor.
I appreciate the consideration
of the time this afternoon. Uh,
House Bill 14 is
A proposal to help working
families in New Mexico.
last legislative session.
Uh, myself and my co-sponsor, we
we brainstorm on, on.
The next new way to help.
Mexicans and middle income.
Uh, single fiers and joint
filers I know oftentimes we we
exclude a single fighters and.
Focus a lot of our attention on
those uh.
and those with children.
Uh, we, we talked initially
about how maybe we could amend
or create something.
To the same effect of the low
income comprehensive tax credit,
uh, that being an option, but we
recognized early on and with the
help of some economists is that
oftentimes that that has a cliff
effect where people will benefit
from a program like that.
The only benefit to a point
where they make a certain amount
of money.
They don't want to make any more
money, so then, so then they
they they're stuck.
cycle of just wanting to stay
where they're at.
Something that we don't.
necessarily want to have happen
or create for the Mexicans
create disincentive really for
for folks not wanting to make
more and fear that they will
lose their benefits. So that's
where we talked a little bit
more about the uh establishment
of House Bill 14 and what House
Bill 14 does.
Replaces and expands the current
New Mexico working families tax
credit.
With what is now considered the
New Mexico earned income tax
credit.
So the
Pres that I mentioned, the
earning income tax credit.
It's really a concept from
President Reagan's era in
regards to uh how to get people
into the workforce and it's an
evidence-based federal program
showing to bring people into the
workforce.
Reduce poverty
And improve outcomes for
children and improving local
economies and so in
Mexico
Curran statute in place or what
we have the working families tax
credit has seen has seen major
success in providing.
195,000 working New Mexicans
with an average benefit of over
$500 per year.
Current credit provides a 2 25%.
Match of the Federal earned
income tax credit.
The state's working families tax
credit has been shown to reduce
poverty.
Improving Mexico's labor force
and partition and participation
rate.
However
As I may have mentioned before
that there's some problems that
exist, for example,
And a person without children,
those single fiers.
Working a minimum wage job,
maybe 25 hours.
For a week
They don't qualify for the
working families tax credit.
This population largely doesn't
qualify for any state or federal
benefits.
But they are taxed further into
poverty.
Every single year, both by the
state and the federal
government, often because of
large social security and
Medicare taxes.
In fact, and I'm glad that um uh
we have Brendan here with us
from the Legislative Finance
Committee.
A recent legislative finance.
Committee program evaluation
found that the low labor force
participation rate amongst
childless young men was a
significant problem in New
Mexico.
And may be one of the key
factors holding back our
statewide labor force partition
participation rate.
What this bill does is it builds
upon the strengths of New Mexico
working families tax credits and
solves some of his problems by
offering an expansion to workers
without children.
This is done while increasing
the benefits for everyone who
currently gets the working
families tax credits.
The bill itself has 3 main
parts. The first part is that
the bill increases the federal
match from the current 25%
match.
To expand it 5% to 30%.
Second, the bill makes.
101,000 more New Mexicans
eligible for the earned income
tax credit.
I dramatically extending the
eligibility thresholds.
That the that the legislation
provides and finally the
building couples in Mexico from
the federal earned income tax
credit, allowing us to tailor
this program for the benefit of
New Mexicans by way of expansion
into single fiers and also those
in regards to however much they
make and how many kids that they
have.
The increased credit adds
significant benefit to all
households, for example,
A single parent with one child
working a full-time minimum wage
job currently gets about $700
from working families tax
credits.
Under this expansion, that same
family, that same person would
now receive about $1100.
in a credit.
Essentially
Making them
Not have to pay any state income
tax.
I was 14 also helps smooth the
transition from low to moderate
income families by extending the
eligibility thresholds. Let's
say that a single parent with
one child gets a pay raise that
increases their salary from
A minimum wage job, and they're
now making $20 an hour.
With the working family's tax
credit, the benefit decreases
from $700 to $200.
However, under this new
proposal, they would receive a
$600 refund because the benefits
remain higher or longer.
As a person increases their
income.
As I may mention before, with
Lichter and many other tax
proposals that target low-income
families, those create cliff
effects.
Which benefits decrease very
quickly as a person increases
their own income.
The earned income tax credit,
the working families tax credit
and HB 14 don't have this
problem.
They work to bring people into
the workforce, reducing poverty,
improving childhood outcomes and
strengthening Mexico's economy.
HB 14 further.
Furthers the strategy provides a
way for Mexico to continue to
invest in improving the quality
of life for all New Mexicans,
especially those.
That are single fiers and those
that are lower to middle income.
Oaks
With that, Madam Chair, I will
stand for any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
for your presentation. Do we
have anybody, um, in opposition
of this bill.
We have anybody on Zoom?
Do we,
do we have anybody in favor of
this bill?
Would you like to speak on it?
All righty, then let's go to the
committee. Oh.
We do have one person on Zoom.
Page, you have one minute.
I think you. Good afternoon,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Paige
Knight, Deputy Policy director
with New Mexico Voices for
Children, and we stand in strong
support of House Bill 14. House
14 has a very similar design to
the federal EITC and therefore
the current working families tax
credit, but it makes a number of
really key improvements, which
would really help amplify the
mini study benefits that tax
credits like the EITC have been
shown to provide, uh, such as
improved educational, employment
and health.
Outcomes for children and
families and increased earnings
in workforce to the patient. HB
14 does so by allowing for a
more generous credit amount and
by extending the credit and
therefore its benefits to more
hardworking New Mexicans,
allowing them to be better able
to put food on the table to pay
their bills and to secure
greater economic stability. We
also really appreciate the
expanded ha out amounts under
this proposal, which helps
further mitigate any potential
cliff effects that workers
may experience some, say, a pay
increase or a job transition.
And finally, by decoupling from
the federal EITC in this manner.
This proposal is a wise and
proactive way to ensure the
credit best serves New Mexicans,
and that they are able to
continue receiving these, this
important tax credit, regardless
of what happens federally. We
urge a due pass on HB 14 and
thank the sponsors for bringing
it forward.
Thank you. Anybody else on Zoom?
All righty.
Uh, any questions from the
committee?
And emotions from the committee,
it's the will of the committee.
Second, right.
Um
had to take, take the role.
Representative Armstrong.
Representative De la Cruz.
Yes
Representative Hernandez,
Representative Lente.
Yes. Representative Mason.
Yes.
Representative Matthews? Yes.
Representative Murphy,
Representative Pajon.
Representative Serrado.
Uh, Madam Vice Chair, Madam
Chair, Madam Chair, the final
tally is 10 votes. Yes, 0 votes,
no. Thank you. You got it.
Thank you committee.
All righty, if we can go to HB
22.
That
Thank you.
I will send up another note.
All righty. Would you like to
begin? We would. Thank you,
Madam Chair,
members of the committee, thank
you all this this afternoon.
This bill is about fairness,
credit card fees.
Backwards
and turn over
We'll get it together, madam
chair, I promise.
So members of the committee,
this bill is about fairness.
Credit card fees are a cost of
doing business and employers
should not be passing that cost
on to their employees. Workers
in the service industry rely on
their tips. It's not extra
money, it's your wages.
I'm sure at this point I would
like my co-sponsor.
Representative Hernandez.
Thank you.
Uh, Madam Chair and members of
the committee. So what House
Bill 22 does um is really
something that's simple but
significant, um.
I'll just explain it. I will not
read this so.
Um, tipped workers.
Uh, when you
are getting your tips, POS
systems, um, I wanna make sure
that.
This is not about
Saying that restaurant owners
are doing this on purpose, um,
point of sale systems when
they're shipped into New Mexico,
um, and really everywhere except
for the few states that have
done this by default, um, they
take.
The credit card fees.
Um, the portions of the credit
card fees out of.
tips that you receive every day.
Um, what HB 22 will do is put a
stop to that. So in the states,
other states that have passed
similar legislation, uh, when a
new POS system is.
sent into the state, um, that is
turned off and cannot be turned
back on. So what we're trying to
do is
For a chip worker, um, the tips
that you make are the tips that
you keep, you don't have to.
credit card fees, um, out of
that, so.
Anywhere between 3 and 7%
depending on the credit card.
Um
This bill is not meant to
penalize small businesses, we
recognize the challenges that
they face, um, we're just trying
to, to make it.
to
Thank you, Representative.
And as representative Hernandez
mentioned, many modern point of
sale systems have.
And updated
And they stopped this practice,
but
It's, it's a very simple.
Simple bill in the sense that
you work for your tips.
The customer expects to provide
you with a certain amount of
money.
Because you did a good job.
And it's unfair and bear in mind
not every server makes.
Large amounts of money is in
their tips, so if you are able
to take part of that money and
pay for fees on a card.
That just takes away from that
amount that they need.
So we are trying to make sure
that doesn't happen.
Uh, we're not saying that it's
happening large scale, but on
any scale, if it happens to one
person, one server, it's not
good.
So
that we're
open for questions.
Thank you. Uh, do we have any
anybody opposed to this film?
Do have anybody on Zoom?
Already? And do we have anybody
in favor of this bill?
All righty, if you'd like to
speak, if you come up to the
front, the attendee will hold
the microphone and you'll have
one minute.
Nobody wants to talk now,
everybody got real shy.
This is an interesting committee
today, uh, anybody on Zoom?
OK.
Emma, you have one minute.
OK. Um, Madam Chair, my name is
Edna O'Sullivan for the New
Mexico Center on Non Poverty. We
thank the sponsors for this
show. We stand in support of
this bill because we believe
that hardworking individuals who
receive tips shouldn't have
their wages taken to cover their
employer's normal business
expenses. Most tipped workers
earn much more in tips than
their base wage, so making these
kinds of deductions from tips
can have a significant impact on
their overall income.
Case are clearly emphasizes the
tips are the property of the
employee, and it's already
illegal for employers to take
any portion of an employee um an
employee's tips under New
Mexico's minimum wage Act. We
believe that credit card
transaction fees should be no
exception, and workers should
receive 100% of the tip that a
customer leaves to them.
Codifying wage rights is
particularly important when it
comes to tipped workers because
the service industry is already
plagued by bad business
practices. Statistically, tipped
workers are more likely to face
adverse working conditions like
sexual harassment and
discrimination, and they're more
likely to be women and people of
color. According to a recent
study, workers in the food
service industry in New Mexico
are more than twice as likely to
be victims of wage theft and
workers in other industries.
This bill is good for New
Mexico's typical workers because
it protects their main source of
income, their tips from unfair
deductions made by their
employers. For these reasons, we
support HB 22 and we request
that you do pass. Thank you.
That is all, Madam Chair.
We'll go to the committee, uh,
Representative Matthews.
Thank you, uh, thank you, Madam
Chair and thank you presenters.
Uh, this is, uh,
It's an interesting.
Uh, idea and I.
And I'm
I'm wondering if it could have
an unintended consequence, so I
just wanted to.
See what you all thought.
Would, what would keep a
Restaurant owner
Uh, from
Uh, posting a sign that no tips
except cash.
Um
Nothing but if they can only tip
in cash, then the problem that
we're facing here would already
be gone.
Um, because what we're do what
this bill does, sorry.
That one is suctioned, um, what
this bill is doing is so
The point of sale system is
taking that 3% on average, um.
Credit card fee for swiping the
credit card and automatically
taking that.
That a percentage of that.
Out of the tips rather than it
being absorbed as a cost of
business by the business. So if
they can only tip in cash,
you're getting the full amount
and the credit card processing
fee is already gone.
Madam representative.
So the bill's intention is to
Not allow business to use.
Tibbs for transaction fees for
the card processing fee, so if
it were cash as the
representative said it's there's
not a problem because they get
their amount.
They usually put it in their
pocket right away.
Uh
Madam chair, thank you. Yes, I
understand that, but if we, if
we say that the tip fee is gonna
be paid by the employer, which
is what the bill does.
And that's an added cost to the
employer because the employer
doesn't share any of the tip, is
that correct?
Uh, Madam Chair and
Representative, so.
What happens with the point of
sale systems is that, OK, let's
say that you have.
An $80 bill and a $20 tip.
100 bucks, nice easy round
number.
Um, you, they swipe the credit
card, 3% of what it's doing is
it's taking.
What would that be 20% of that
$3 and um and then the business
absorbs the rest.
What this bill would do is
instead of it taking that.
Take it all to the business
owner rather than having the
employee pay.
For it.
Um, and over time in a month
that adds up to a decent amount
of uh in the FIR I think they
said that it was like $17 per
week.
$80 a month, that's quite a bit.
Um
I'm sorry, I had my.
off.
Madam Chair represented sure
that.
That that
Has that way I can't imagine it,
however.
Um
You can pay in cash, you can pay
through card. Most businesses
allow you to do one or the
other.
And so in the in those occasions
where.
There might be a proprietor who
wishes to deduct that because
it's also a choice.
Wishes to do that. It just means
less to the server.
Because they're using part of
the server's tip.
To pay a transaction fee.
So I'm not sure that I'm
answering your question, maybe
Representative Hernandez can
take a start with that.
Madam Representative, so there
is nothing from stopping uh a
proprietor from.
Going to cash tips only, cash
only for their whole business,
um, what that really does though
is that.
I mean, you know it, I know it,
where, what that's gonna end up
doing to the business is making
it so that less people, you
know, who carries cash anymore.
Um, so, but there is nothing
anywhere from stopping that.
Uh, the question
50 cents a transaction going to
stop, I mean, 50 cents on like a
large transaction, um, going to
stop somebody from doing that.
And the reality of this is that.
Most people are most businesses
are not walk in and say I'm
gonna take this out, it's how.
The point of sale systems are
set up by default.
And
Most
Most restaurant owners or
managers aren't going to go
into, you know, pick in the
settings.
Of a
Very complex sometimes system,
um, what this is trying to do is
just make sure.
That in those most cases that.
By default and that it can't be
turned on when we're in the
state, so.
Um
Yes, it, it will slightly
increase the cost, um, but.
It will help the people and go
in cash only is only dinner I
think hurt that business in the
long run.
But that is uh that is their
choice, that is not something we
can dictate.
OK, I, I mean, I was just
wondering if if anybody had
thought about that whether.
It was a concern. I don't know
who you worked with when coming
up with Bill.
Um
And uh I hope you're right.
Thank you,
uh, that, that actually has
been.
Uh, I was brought up to us.
Um, went down that path.
Of figuring out what it would
actually like cost on different,
you know, on average, and it was
such a small, like it was a.
Small amounts of the business
but a considerable amount to.
The server that it still was
worth it. Thank you.
Thank you. Uh, Representative
Mason.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative.
Uh
I'm, I'm a little
Confused
I've never had a restaurant, so
but I see this on my slip.
Adam representing where you add
your tip on the bottom.
When
Say the total like the example
you gave.
$20 tip, $80 bill, $100 total.
You run the card.
Does the card not charge a fee
on the $10?
Representative, no, um.
So for that $100 on average,
it's about 3%
uh to you know be able to get
the retail but
excuse me just a second, let me
clarify my deal a little.
Uh, Madam Chair representative.
If it takes like our credit card
machines and ours don't show
tips.
$100
It uh I the store.
I, you know,
On the $100
The
So
There's no way that, but.
So you're saying that I
actually.
Employers covering the 30s or
whatever cents on.
On the $20 tip was 60.
60 cents.
But what happens?
Wave of the credit cards is.
A lot of the small business I
don't know in your area, but in
our age, do not charge.
I do not pay a fee.
And the
You know,
For the
I can get
Providers that will run the card
guards the employee the store
owner nothing.
But they add a fee too.
Credit card at that time.
Who
Tea
Madam Chair, so instead of.
$100 it would be $103 to also
cover the fee but the but the
customer pays the fee.
But that actuality they pay more
on those type of parts
but we find it in our small town
me chair.
You don't see any of the big
boys done it, but the little.
Little little restaurants,
family restaurants a lot went to
the no fee credit card.
So,
if I might, so.
Chairwoman uh represented Mason,
this doesn't touch that.
This has nothing to do with
that, so if you in your area
pass on that the cost of that
service to the customer.
That's fine. This, this bill
does nothing with that at all.
All that it does is disallow.
Any of the, the, the transaction
fee will be passed on to the
tipped employee.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative.
I see where you're coming from
and.
In reality,
Adam Taylor.
Purr is
Is going to pay the fee.
The customer themselves all fees
are past the bottom.
One way or another.
and
Um, I'm just trying to figure
out how to explain it. OK, so if
your establishment decides to
pass that that $3 fee on or the
30% fee, or sorry, 3% fee, then.
The customer will pay for it. A
lot of places, especially bigger
chains, that kind of stuff they,
you know, absorb that into.
Cost of
Um, so this is just.
When you have a tipped employee
and you have that the extra tip
that's run on a card.
Um, right now what's happening
in their point of sale systems
is that it's breaking it up so
that whatever percentage that is
1518, 20 plus, um, it takes that
much of the credit card fee and
takes it out of the tip.
And so what we're trying to do
is keep it from being taken out
of the tip and just being put
out into the.
what the business
Um, covers rather than what the
tipped employee covers that,
that's all that this does, so it
doesn't um
been talk of doing things
wouldn't be allowed to charge a
fee on tips or tax or any of
this stuff at the federal level
we're we're not touching any of
that.
Um, and I was like, I, I think
that that should be a federal
level thing, not on us because
financial is yeah.
A little over our all of our
heads here, but um, yeah, so all
this does is take that.
On the $100
it would take that 60 cents and
instead of taking it out of the.
tipped employees
tip, it would take it and.
put it out of the $80.
So that the business owner is
paying for it rather than the
tipped employee.
Thank you Madam Chair.
So the employer ends up paying
instead of 3%.
5%
Madam Chair, he's paying the
entire 3%, whereas now he could
be paying 85% of it or 80% or
whatever that relation with the
tip.
would be so it's, yeah, it the
the 3% is not getting bigger.
It's just his portion of the 3%
is now 100% instead of in the
out of the $100 you would have
been paying 80% of that of that
3%.
we're making this,
but actually the employer.
Gonna pay, what was it?
$3 on 100.
Instead of
But actually he's playing $3 on
the 80 so he his his percentage
went up.
uh
Any way you pay it and
On Madam Chair.
But consumer will pay.
Nothing
Everything in in our business
world is a pass through cost.
We don't, yeah, or we figure it
into the price of our goods,
something will have to be
adjusted on.
Pay for the fee
Thank you, madam. Thank you. Do
you have any other questions
from the committee?
What is the will of the
committee?
I'm Chairwoman. I move we do
pass on House Bill 22.
Alright. Do I have a second?
OK.
Alrighty, Patrick, take the
role.
Representative Armstrong.
Yeah
Representative De la Cruz.
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lente, yes.
Representative Mason, yes.
Representative Matthews.
Uh, yes, for the comment after
the.
Representative Murphy? Yes.
Representative Parajon.
Representative Serrado.
Representative Armstrong?
Uh, no, and I'd like to explain
my.
Madam Vice Chair,
Yes.
Madam Chair,
Yes, Madam Chair, the final
tally is 9 votes, yes, 1 vote
no.
Alrighty, um.
So the bill has passed, uh,
Representative Matthews would
like to explain her vote.
very briefly, uh, I'm not really
explaining my vote, but I
received a text as after I had
asked my questions that this.
This conduct is already illegal.
Or restaurant owners to do that.
So I'm just
Wanted to pass that along.
Because it might be relevant
whether
With the future of this bill.
Madam, so
There's some confusion in the
middle about the mandatory
minimum wage versus this part of
it.
It is something that we have
that I have been talking with a.
Employment lawyer about to
figure out if that is actually
if if it would already be
covered or not covered under it,
so we're running the bill until
we have a conclusive answer.
Um, because right now.
Uh
Leader, Armstrong.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair, I,
I'm just concerned that, um,
first of all, that employers
would do this.
Second of all, that um.
I don't, I don't
I've owned a restaurant, I
wouldn't do it, but that's me,
uh, and then, uh, I also, it's,
you know, mandating on.
Employment once again, and
that's a concern for me. I, I
don't like mandates.
Um, so, uh, just a concern for
me, and I'm, I'm interested to
hear more about the bill and
where it goes with the
representative Matthew's
comments as well. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you.
Alrighty.
Um, we've got HB 241.
OK.
Already. Please explain the
bill.
Um, OK, so House Bill 241.
a man is amending, oh.
And could you, um, we, we're
having a hard time hearing I'm
trying to get close enough but
not too close. Perfect, thank
you. Um.
Alright, so 24, uh, House Bill
241.
is looking to amend the
definitions in the gaming
Control Act to include allowable
gaming expenses and uh the
balance of net tape.
Allowable gaming expenses.
it's
um, but essentially what it is,
is fees for things like
licensing fees, security and
surveillance expenses, um.
Installment payments.
for leases and a whole bunch of
it would take to run a to run
gaming, um, and the balance of
net take.
Means the amount of remaining
after gaming operations um and
actually my expert can explain
this a whole lot better. Can you
introduce yourself, please?
Yes, what it is, it's 2 years
ago we were here.
I'm sorry, I'm Bill Jennings.
I'm president of the Veterans of
the Durum nonprofit
organizations in New Mexico and
I'm the commander of the
American Legion for the
Department of New Mexico.
2 years ago we were here and we
passed, I believe it was house
bill 253.
Which allowed all of my
85 so groups.
After allowable gaming expenses,
had to pay 20% to charity.
And the gaming board was here
with me and voted in all
committees 100%.
10 months ago they decided to do
away with that gaming expense.
And now we have nothing.
There's 11
Different things, so we're not
asking for nothing new.
We're just asking to get back.
What we got
Two years ago with the House
bill that was passed here will
stand for questions.
Well, first of all, thank you
for your service. Appreciate you
being here today, um, do we have
uh anybody in opposition to this
bill?
OK. Uh, if you'd like to speak,
if you could form a line, we'll
get the attendant to hold the
microphone and you'll have a
minute.
Madam Chair members, my name is
Pat Garrett I'm the chairman of
the gaming control board. Um,
this particular bill is kind of
complicated and if I explained
it, I would confuse you, so I
have my chief legal counsel and
my head auditor here to explain
this.
Hi, my name is Michelle Pedo. I
am staff counsel for the gaming
control board, and we're
opposing this bill because, um,
we are familiar with the bill
that took place 2 years ago. And
the point of that bill was to
change the 60% charitable
contributions to 20% because we
found that um the clubs could
not survive if they were giving
that much to charity. It just
wasn't feasible. Um,
And that was also in line with
how we were doing our
calculations and what we were
requiring at the clubs. Now what
else we weren't doing was this
list of the allowable gaming
expenses, that was contained in
our rules. Um, we were not
requiring that because that
requires the gaming manager to
take the gaming tax money, um,
pay these expenses, then turn
the rest of the money over to
the organization itself, which
then does whatever they're gonna
do. Um.
The point of this is, the money
should not be going from the
gaming manager out to these
expenses. It's not saying that
they can't pay the expenses.
It's saying that it's the parent
organization that should pay the
expenses. They often have bylaws
that um require certain people
to sign the checks coming from
these places. Now,
If you have a gaming manager
who's not necessarily a member
of that organization, signing
the checks that go out, um,
that's concerning. This gives
the parent organization more
control over their expenses and
how they're paid.
Um, another concern with this
list is, it's a bit duplicative,
and you do have in here that
some of these allowable gaming
expenses are for lease payments.
Um, however, there's also listed
in here for gaming device for
parent maintenance. Now, the
lease agreements are for the
gaming machines. The lease
agreements should be containing
clauses that allow for repair
and maintenance of those
machines as they are at least
machines. So you run into the
problem with this definition.
These clubs might actually pay
for repairs that they're not
supposed to pay for, and that
should be covered by their lease
agreements. Thank you. My name
is Steve Snedden and I'm the
director of the audit and
compliance division. And I'm
here to speak on any questions
or just give a little brief
A review of the 3 attachments,
um, basically, if you look at
them, the amount of revenue that
went to the uh the licensed
clubs was 39% that they could
use to pay any bills. Once they
started, excuse me, once they
started deducting uh
The distributor payment or other
expenses, that percentage goes
up for the bills, obviously, but
the amount for charity
decreases. So, um, by adding the
allowable gaming expenses, the
whole formula changes and
charity goes down. Um, if we
don't add it, they will have 40%
of all the revenues to pay bills
and 20% goes to charity and then
the other 40% or whatever their
uh lease agreement is, goes to
the gaming machine.
uh lease provider.
Thank you.
All righty. Is there anybody on
the Zoom in opposition?
Sure. Alrighty, is anyone in
favor of this bill?
Right.
You like to speak. You've got a
minute.
Um, the attendant will hold the
microphone. Madam Chair, members
of the committee, um, I'm
Richard Gay, I'm representing
the VFMPs here. I had a
A great time representing Bill
Jennings and his operations and
the other nonprofits.
Uh, you'll hear legalese on
this, uh, I just want you guys
to keep this, Madam Chair
members, uh, these are not
The Taj Mahals of the world.
These are not the Caesars of the
world. These are shoestring
budget operations, uh, and if
they need to have stability and
what's called allowable gaming
expenses, they should have that
and I appreciate if you guys
would consider that. Thank you
so much.
Thank you.
Anybody else?
No.
All righty.
Um, let's go to the committee.
Um
Representative de la Cruz.
Thank you, Madam Church. So,
In enacting this or expanding or
mending, it would allow more
flexibility.
Or
The operators of these, they're
they're veteran organizations,
right?
So explain a little bit more to
me.
Why that flex flexibility is
needed and why it's not
happening now.
Yeah, um
Just they took the gaming
expenses away 10 months ago.
My post 118 in Rio Rancho. We
had the 3rd largest, we had 8
slot machines. We have since
ceased operation because it's
No longer
A viable
thing, but if we got these
gaming expenses back, then we
might bring back our gaming.
Represent, did you want to
expand?
OK, so
What make it a little more clear
for me, please.
Why you could no longer have the
machines there. What I'm not
quite understanding what
happened.
Oh, OK, before.
10 months ago
There's 11 items we were allowed
to take out.
Before we paid
Uh
charitable donations we were
allowed to take out the purchase
price of non-cash prizes,
security surveillance, they have
to be maintained under 24 hour
surveillance.
Another thing
We found since we took him out,
our electric bill went down.
60% because you have to have
these machines turned on 24/7,
whether you're open or not.
Which I see no reason for that,
but would address that later.
You need to have independent
accountant fees, license fees,
including renewals and gaming
machine license fees.
futility attributed to the
licensing premises.
installment payments to an
independent.
Administrator release payments,
gaming devices, repair and
maintenance.
Gaming employees' salaries and
employees.
Gaming supplies.
Approved management feeds.
And license permission, repair
and maintenance.
That adds up to a lot of money
over the course of a year.
Madame Cur, it seemed that I
heard some of the folks that
spoke spoke earlier that that in
leasing these machines that.
The owners of the machines are
supposed to be maintaining some
aspect is that not happening?
No, none of the organizations
own the machines.
You're basically two
distributors.
Or she gaming and.
New Mexico gaming have to you
have to lease the machines from
them.
And they owned them.
And most of the leases are based
on a percentage of what the
machine takes in.
We could remember to go through
the chair.
I made up.
Uh, Madam Chair, I read the FIR
and I gotta tell you, it wasn't
particularly clear.
I have a lot of friends that go
to VA's. I sometimes go as a
guest.
I know that these.
Locations create a positive
atmosphere of camaraderie and.
Brotherhood and and family.
Uh, and
And I
I guess
I'm not real clear having having
read the FIR Madam Chair.
What, what is happening?
You had money that you were able
to collect, right?
And you were able to
Pay the fees or not the fees,
but the operation costs of these
machines, right? Yes, and then
something happened. Was there a
rule that was brought down that
said now you can't do that.
Yes.
Madam, Madam Chair.
Yes
Two years ago, we had a bill, I
believe it was 253. It was
passed here.
It allowed us all of these
gaming expenses.
So for a year we were allowed to
have all of these.
And then the gaming board back
there.
In their wisdom decided to take
that away from us.
So all we're asking is to have
those expenses back.
Which we were given the right
under House Bill 253 2 years
ago.
Madam Chair
You know offhand.
How much revenue you earned in a
year at your location on those 8
machines total.
Madam Chair, I
Don't have those figures with
me.
Could you give me an
approximation?
That make how much money we took
in in a year.
All told, forget, you know what
it costs to operate the machine
or pay the state or any of that
on average, what do you think
the total was on those 8
machines. We were one of the
3rd, we were the 3rd largest,
and I think.
We were taken in
Right at 95 to 100,000 a year.
So
I, my concern is, so man a long
time ago in a different life, I
was director of Parks and
recreation.
At other community centers and
not just the community, we had
standalone senior centers.
And in those senior centers, one
of the things that happens is
they play bingo.
It is
They love it and there's they
enjoy it. In fact, many of the
little gifts that that we are
given here at the legislature. I
take him to the seniors, to my
nearest senior center, because
they use them as little gifts,
OK?
As part of the bingo game. Well,
the other thing that they do is
they'll take a little
collection, I'll take a little,
make a little pot.
And everybody puts in a quarter
or a buck or whatever it is.
And then they play bingo and
somebody wins that, so there's
that aspect and then there's the
little price, but
There was a time, Madam Chair,
where
Our
State
And concurred by our attorney at
the time, this was in.
The middle 90s or so.
That they said that this was
gambling.
And that it needed to stop.
So the county manager said,
Art need to put a stop to that
bingo or that little pot of
money can't happen against the
law.
I thought it was stupid.
I just thought it was stupid.
And so we, we, we put a stop to
it, we did.
Well, I'm gonna tell you what,
Madam Chair.
seniors didn't sit still for it.
They started calling their
county commissioners, and it was
a weird thing because within 3
or 4 days, they were allowed
back to play that bingo.
You know, I don't know, they
might be collected 25 bucks or
whatever.
And I, and I,
I kind of get the same sense
here.
You know, you've got a group of
folks, you're talking veterans,
you're talking their spouses,
you're talking.
You know, the, the, the views
have family events.
all
I, I for the life of me can
understand like now if you were
making a million dollars or
$500,000.
You know, every year, because
that was a net that you were
talking about.
Not all the costs that were
associated.
for life, we can understand the
logic of why that's not
allowable.
Thank you, Ma.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Serato.
I think
I got a red book. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you
representative. I'm just trying
to understand because um when
you came up, I said we've
already done this. We do this so
often. Um, so I was a little
confused, uh, and I appreciate
you coming forward and helping
us figure this out.
It seems in the analysis from
the gaming commission that
they're like, that's why I grab
the statue on too. It seems that
they they were saying that.
If we pass this, nothing would
change about the distribution
was in their analysis. And I'm
just kind of curious how you all
as a sponsor and and the expert
on this field that it would
change, even though the game
board says that it would, would
essentially be the same.
That's my only question.
I'm sorry, Madam Cha didn't
quite understand that. What's
the question? Yeah, madam,
representative expert, um, so
just in the analysis of the
gaming control board, they said
that um if we pass this today.
That, uh, the calculations for
nonprofit organizations will
remain the same. The leadership
of the body of the organization
will continue to have control
over the distribution of gaming
funds.
Um, as a leadership body are
ultimately responsible. So they
say nothing will change if we,
if we do this, and I'm not and
I'm just kind of curious.
Well yeah, something is gonna
change. I'm gonna get back my
liable gaming expenses.
So that I originally was given
by this committee 2 years ago.
Representative, Madam Chair, is
there anything you wanted to add
to that as well just so.
represents
the changes I think is closer.
I'm chair represent the changes
in the stability.
Of any industry that's looking
for stability and regulation and
statute.
Yeah, you, you
They might not be wrong when
they say the distribution won't
change, but it's the ability to
make.
Payroll make your invoices and
your um your your debits and
your credits. That's what runs
small businesses is that that
the stability of it, that's what
this does.
Madam Sheriff
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
I'll I'll, I'm good
for now.
I appreciate you coming up. Um,
there's, there should be there
seems to be a lot of confusion
and questions. Um, the first
question that I have for you all
is, um, why the gaming control
board, um, stopped allowing this
to to happen. Could we start
there?
Yes, madam Chair, um, members of
the committee, I think there is
a lot of confusion about what
allowable gaming expenses is all
about.
Um, there's this thought that
we're not allowing them to pay
their bills, and we are, there's
nothing stopping them from
paying their bills, it's
actually giving.
The commanders and the
leadership of the posts more
control over how their finances
are spent.
With allowable gaming expenses,
it's going to be pretty much the
gaming manager who may or may
not be a member, and they aren't
necessarily a member of the post
or that organization. They're
the ones paying those out. Um,
we stopped even doing this, even
though the rule still existed
this previously we stopped doing
this, I think in 2016, uh, Mr.
Snedden can correct me if I'm
wrong. And that was at the
request of several clubs because
there were concerns.
That money was getting held up.
At the gaming manager's desk
pretty much, um, because they
were paying all these expenses
and the clubs are waiting for
them to get these expenses so
they can take in the money
because they had other things
they needed to do.
Um, so that is the concern with
this. It was requested by these
organizations to stop this
practice. I think there's a lot
of confusion. It's
Hearing Mr. Jennings.
We, we've talked to people,
we've tried, um.
They think we're telling them
they can't pay their expenses,
that's just not true.
It's giving the clubs more
control. The actual post
defenses. That's what we did.
Um, and that was the point of.
OK, so, um,
There seems to be a disconnect.
And I think we want to make sure
that the that.
These types of clubs can still,
um, you know, continue to gain.
And so, um, I sure would like
there to be a meeting or some
kind of a meeting of the minds
to be able to clarify this.
Also, from my understanding of
what uh Representative Cerrado
read, even if we were to pass
this, it would not affect.
Um, is that what I heard? It
would not affect, yeah, Madam
Chair. OK.
I'm out of my money.
Where am I supposed to pay her
out of out of my pocket.
Come on, I mean, there is
confusion here, but it's caused
by the gaming board.
OK. Uh, representative or uh
Representative Lente.
I don't mean to interrupt your
train of thought, Madam
Chairwoman, and, and folks, but
Seems to me then that with this
bill,
It, you're pres it's very
prescriptive.
A line items exactly what you
can spend your money on.
Yes, that's what we're trying to
clarify and put it in there and
that's what you want. Yes, we're
allowed to pay my gaming
manager. I'm allowed to pay the
maintenance on my machines, yes,
that we're trying to clarify it
because
We had this a year ago, but the
gaming board destroyed it since
then.
OK. It was in 253 2 years ago
after a allowable gaming
expenses. We're now trying to
clarify what those allowable
game expenses are, Madam Chair.
OK.
But without
This legislation.
In regards to how the current
gaming board wishes to see.
And operate
It almost gives you more
autonomy to spend the money in
any way you want to versus
These 1 to 11 ways in which is
outlined in this bill, madam,
it's 11 items that were allowed
to spend their money on.
And it's all plain here, 11
islands and, and I guess what
I'm trying to say, Madam Chair,
and and and expert inert, um, is
that if someone told me
You're allowed to spend, I'm
allowed to spend my money on
these 11 items.
I would hate that more than if I
could spend my money on.
In any other way that I wanted
to.
Am I wrong in that
interpretation?
I'm sure you can't spend it any
way you want. When those
machines are opened up when the
money's counted, everything has
to be with 2 people in the room
with the complete video camera,
so everything has a video
record.
And there's 2 people to verify
all the money so nobody can
spend the money any way they
want. It's all well regulated.
It's just that 2 years ago they
misconstrued a labo gaming
expenses and all we're trying to
do is clarify what those
allowable gaming expenses are.
And, and Madam Chair, one last
follow up then and I appreciate
the, the, the back and forth,
but it seems to me then that,
that the organization that
regulates gaming in New Mexico,
that that is your charge,
correct? That is, that is your
job is allowing you.
The autonomy
To pay your bills, spend your
money.
And in whatever fashion that you
need to do so to operate your,
your facility, right? And so,
I, I, I, I just question again,
is, is this necessary? Are we,
are we helping you? Are we
hurting you? I understand you
want to be prescriptive, and I
appreciate you wanting to do
things by the book. I think we
all do.
But at the same time, um, you
know, I, I, I, I'd rather help
you than to hurt you and
And, and at this point, it
almost seems like if if we pass
this bill, we're going to
restrict you greatly in regards
to what you can do. No, madam,
madam, cheer up. I believe that
you're gonna be helping all of
the nonprofits in New Mexico.
Putting a definition to what
allowable gaming expenses are.
Because right now it's muddied
in the water.
And we want it in writing what
the allowable gaming expenses
are, and that'll help all of the
nonprofits in New Mexico. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. So what I would like,
um, I'm gonna ask the the uh
gaming control board, um, to
work.
Um, with the sponsor, um, I, I
think that it's, it's.
Part of your charge to make sure
we can reopen or they can reopen
and uh have the, the information
that they need to do that. I
also think um maybe giving some
type of workshops or trainings,
uh, to make sure that they're
able to do that. Um, I am.
I'm, I'm happy to. I would like
to roll this bill because I
don't wanna.
In any way, um, hurt.
You know, the impact that the
veterans have on or what they're
trying to do, but I, I also see
that this bill may not be the
vehicle to do it, but I want to
make sure that the gaming
control board is engaged and
actively working to to fix it.
Uh, I'm gonna refer to the
sponsor.
There needs to be some more
information here to make sure
that we, that between everybody
what needs to happen is actually
happening.
Um, so yeah, we would like to
roll this patrol in just a few
minutes
and figure out where the
disconnect is. Thank you, thank
you, and I would like a report
back, um, as to how the, the
negotiations are going and if we
do need to bring it back, I will
schedule it. So thank you.
Already, if we could, we could
uh clear the last
Um
If we can get the sponsor for HB
307.
Yeah
So before we start, um, at this
time we're gonna hear House Bill
307. The plan is to hear from
the sponsor, uh, her experts and
take public comment.
Um
Please note we will not be
voting on this bill today. There
are several, uh several other
bills on the topic that are
making their way to this
committee and to ensure that we
do not pass conflicting
legislation, we're gonna hold
this bill for our for final
consideration until the other
bills catch up. So with that,
I'm gonna ask uh the sponsor to
go ahead and, and begin.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you committee members.
I am here to present on House
Bill 307.
And first, if it's OK, I'd like
to introduce my experts.
Um, first I have Codyinsky with
the ACLU, um, and I'll, I'll,
I'll, I'll hand it over shortly
for opening remarks. I also have
Nicole Rocca, um, as experts as
well, and then Marshall Martinez
from Equality New Mexico and
Lena Weber from ACLU New Mexico
to provide sup supplemental if
if necessary.
So technological advances have
given us so much to celebrate
and certainly the Internet and
smartphones have created
convenience and access to
knowledge that so many of us
never dreamed of, but we are
also aware of the dangers that
lurk there.
Many of us in this building have
been working to find ways to
limit the harms that can come to
people from online activity,
especially young people.
Now with the increased urgency
around the risks to our personal
information online, House Bill
307 is a gold standard for
legislative policy to protect
all New Mexicans from the harms
that can befall them online.
This bill is aimed at limiting
the amount of information that
can be collected about us
without our consent and
therefore limiting how that
information is used to
manipulate us and to and to find
and harm us.
Privacy and cybersecurity
experts estimate there are
approximately 1000 data points
available for each and every one
of us online. This includes
things like basic information,
purchasing records like what we
buy, how often we buy it and
where health data like our
medical conditions, behavioral
data used to profile us and
real-time location data that
tracks our commute where we shop
and how often we visit certain
places.
The unchecked gathering and
trading of this personal
information on all of us can
lead to real harms, and New
Mexicans deserve better.
In House Bill 37, we worked with
many advocates to achieve the
most protections possible while
guaranteeing the freedoms of
individuals. This bill restricts
what online entities can do
without our consent and create
space for consumers to opt into
sharing more information in
order to achieve personalization
in their online activity. For
years we have seen children
protection. We have seen
children protection groups, the
ACLU and LGBTQ organizations at
odds on how to protect minors on
the.
Internet, and this bill was
drafted with all of those groups
at the table and in full
agreement.
And with that, Madam Chair, I'll
hand it over to Mr. Binsky.
Madam Chair and members of the
committee.
Thank you for holding this
hearing on establishing robust
protection for our privacy at
this critical moment in our
history.
Technology permeates every
aspect of our lives and the data
that technology creates can
consequently reveal the places
we travel, the news we read, the
health care we receive and the
relationships we establish.
For example, our broadband
providers use information about
our online browsing to place us
into categories like working
class.
Unlikely voter last income
decile, and tough times.
Similarly, data brokers sold
location information collected
from apps expressly marketing it
as revealing medical patients in
their healthcare or churchgoers
and their religious beliefs.
It it can be and is used to
track visits to abortion
clinics, and all that
information is simply clicks
away for federal and state
agencies without a warrant or
judicial oversight.
This bill stops the flood of
data at its source. The
companies that collect our data
would be limited to only
collecting what they need to
provide the services that we
request.
The companies that sell our data
or use it to build vast profiles
of our lives for targeted
advertising must get permission
first.
These measures build on and
improve on the work done in
other states and established
common sense guard rails against
those who would breach
confidential relationships or
circumvent legal restrictions on
governmental intrusions.
Moreover, those guardrails have
been established with key
constitutional principles in
mind, especially the First
Amendment.
It steers clear of telling
platforms what speech they can
host and it permits advertising
and content moderation decisions
that do not use our personal
information.
Even in its recent decision,
broadly affirming platform's
editorial rights, the Supreme
Court noted that it was not
addressing.
Each whose algorithms respond
solely to how users act online,
giving them content that they
appear to want, end quote, based
on users' personal information.
This bill is built on that
observation and similar key
dimensions of First Amendment
jurisprudence.
We look forward to discussing
this bill.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and, and
just real briefly Nicole Rocca
will will have um a few remarks
as well.
Good afternoon, chair members.
My name is Nicole Rocha, and I
am the principal of Rocha Public
Affairs. I have been directly
involved with the New New Mexico
Kids Code over the past two
years. Not only does the IPSA
contain many of the protections
that were found in the kids
code. It provides critically
important data privacy
protections for all New
Mexicans. While privacy is
important for everyone, data
shows that the mental health
crisis affecting our youth has
been deeply exacerbated by the
presence of data-driven
advertising to children.
and the use of psychologically
manipulative design intended to
prolong time spent online. These
types of data practices and
design choices have been
incredibly lucrative, but they
are not the only way. The IPSA
does not require any form of
content moderation, and it does
not infringe on the rights of
parents to raise their children.
At the same time, it doesn't
place the onus on parents to
monitor their kids every online
interaction or consent to data
use in order for you to have
access to.
fi ci al online opportunities.
This also ensures that platforms
are not required to collect
additional information to verify
age before permitting you to use
their services.
One of the most significant
shortcomings of federal child
data privacy law is the
requirement that platforms have
actual knowledge that a user is
under 13 years of age before
privacy protections kick in. In
practice, this is permitted
platforms to build profiles on
children for purposes such as
targeted advertising, but ignore
that same information when it
comes to extending privacy
protections. The IPSA defines
actual knowledge to include age
attributed or derived or
inferred from the consumer,
including for the purposes of
advertising, marketing or
product development. This will
help ensure that youth are able
to benefit from the protections
outlined in the bill.
Specifically, youth will be
presented with the privacy
protective feed rather than an
addictive feed based on their
personal information. Unknown
users on a platform will not be
able to to contact known minors
without the minor first
initiating that contact. And no
minors will not receive push
notifications between the hours
of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.,
thereby promoting healthier
sleep habits. Thank you for your
consideration of this important
legislation, and I am available
to answer any questions.
Thank you, Madam Chair, with
that we'll, we'll stand for
questions. Thank you. Alrighty,
do we have anybody here um in.
Oh, in favor of the bill.
OK. Did you line up?
We can get the um so let's see,
let me see about how many.
All righty, if we can get the
attendant to hold the microphone
and uh we'll have about one
minute.
Per person. Uh, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, my
name is Arturo Castillo and I'm
the director of equity and
culture at Conservation Voters
New Mexico. Conservation voters
stands in strong support of the
IPSA for many reasons. In the
movement to end the climate
crisis, we are especially aware
of the impact of targeted
advertising and disinformation
campaigns on our work. In a
world where individuals are
being tracked and profiled all
day without our consent. We are
at special risk for targeted ads
that confuse and misguide us on
critical issues, allowing us to
decide what information we share
with corporate and governmental
entities.
Whether they shared that
information with anyone else is
our most basic safeguard. As
conservationists, we protect our
land, air, and water, so that
humans can live safe and healthy
lives. We believe autonomy over
the information about our lives
is at the core of these values.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Nathan
Savara and I am the program
manager at the statewide LGBTQ
Advocacy organization, Equality
New Mexico. Here to speak today
in support of HB 307, the
Internet Privacy and Safety Act.
This bill is a top priority and
in fact is a must pass in order
to protect LGBTQ New Mexicans,
especially trans youth. All of
the hard work this legislature
has done to protect our
communities, especially the
broad protections passed in 2023
was a great first step, but this
vulnerability gap cannot be
ignored. The fluidity of a free
market for data and personal
information harms us all,
especially marginalized and
criminalized communities like
LGBTQ people. We know New
Mexican values call us to
protect all of our communities.
And this protection must extend.
to LGBTQ youth along our state
lines, who are especially in
danger because of the lack of
strong data privacy protections.
I urge the committee to support
HB 307 and Internet data
protections for New Mexico.
Thank you.

committee. What a mic, OK. My

organization by and for black
indigenous Latino women and
people of color in New Mexico.
Online data can be used to
discriminate against us in
crucial aspects of our lives,
such as health, insurance,
housing and employment.
For communities of color in
particular, this can lead to
further surveillance,
harassment, systems bias and
criminalization.
We know that in other states,
law enforcement has used private
messages, search histories, and
even location data to
criminalize pregnant people for
their miscarriages
and personal decisions about
their reproductive healthcare.
All New Mexicans deserve to be
able to access the information
we need online in order to make
informed decisions about our
bodies, lives, and families.
We should be able to use our
devices without fear of
discrimination and without our
personal information being
exposed or sold for profit. We

Good afternoon, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Abraham Sanchez. I work
as the inclusive democracy
Project director with the Center
for Civic Policy. I'm actually
driving back to my home in Las
Cruces here in just a bit, so I
thank you for this chance to
talk with you real quick. Um, in
the work that I do, I spend a
lot of time working to get
accurate and up to-date
information to people all over
New Mexico about our democracy
and our elections. And
unfortunately, the proliferation
of myths and disinformation
continues to be a growing and
very serious problem for our
democracy. And so I urge you to
support this bill.
Right now, not only is it really
the wild west online when it
comes to these things, um, but
even worse than that, they can
use the algorithms to target
people and actually really build
against them and ultimately even
potentially radicalize people.
And so um I hope that in this
space we can all agree that a
healthy and strong democracy is
very important for our state.
And so I believe that
legislation like this is very
important um in order for us to
proceed that way going forward.
Thank you very much.
Good afternoon, madam, and
members of the committee. My
name is Alondra Reyes. I am the
policy and partnerships manager
at the New Mexico Immigrant Law
Center, as one of New Mexico's
only organizations providing
legal services to immigrant
communities, we support HB 307.
Many families qualify for forms
of relief that lead to legal
status and
Of separation before getting the
legal services they need if
their data gets into the wrong
hands and is used against them.
New Mexico has a long tradition
of welcoming immigrants, and we
know they are an essential part
of our communities, our
neighborhoods, economies, and
knowing their immigration status
could be shared with ICE, could
further instill fear in our
communities, which makes all of
us unsafe and puts families at
risk of separation. We support
HP 307, because it would help
prevent the
Collecting and sale of New
Mexico's personal information
and prevent the illegal tracking
of our online activity.

your support of HB. Thank you.
Uh, if we could go to Zoom now.
Matt Schwartz.
You have one minute.
The chair members of the
committee, thank you for
allowing me to testify today.
Thank you for your attention to
data privacy. My name is Matt
Schwartz, and I'm a policy
analyst with the Consumer
Reports based in Washington DC.
Strong data privacy rules are
critical, because companies are
increasingly surveilling our
every move, both off and online.
This has led to an erosion of
our basic expectation of
privacy, along with concrete
harms that can hurt consumers in
a variety of ways, including
financial scams, stalking, and
unfair price setting just to
name a few.
That's where we're glad to see
that New Mexico is taking steps
towards giving consumers more
control over how their
information is collected and
used. We support the general
direction of this bill,
especially the provisions on
data minimization, sensitive
data and the private right of
action.
Though we are continuing to
analyze and we'll share more
detailed thoughts at a later
time. Thank you for the time and
happy to answer any questions
you might have.
Lydia Harris Grigg.
Hi, good afternoon. My name is
Lydia Harris Gregg. I am the
parent of a 2 year old child.
Uh, I grew up in the digital age
and I've been chronically online
since I was about 10 years old.
My data has been collected,
sold, shared and used against me
from big companies to individual
people. My child's life has
never been shared online. I've
never shared their photo, name,
birthday, or any personally
identifying information about
them online. However, my child
will grow up in a world that is
dependent upon the digital
space. Right now when my child
makes their first online
appearance, their data will be
collected, shared, sold and used
against them. They will be
tracked, monitored, and
manipulated with the data
collected from their online
presence. Right now you have the
power to change that. You have
the power to enact HB 307 and
ensure that my child will have.
The option to opt into data
collection, giving them the
power to opt out and allowing
them to participate in our
online world in a way that is
safer and more equitable. I'm
asking that you please support
HB 307 and help me protect my
child from data mining that
leads to exploitation. Thank
you.
Alan Butler.
I came out in chair members of
the committee for the
opportunity to testify today in
support of HB 307, the IPSA. I'm
Alan Butler, the executive
director of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, or
Epic. Epic is an independent
nonprofit founded 30 years ago
to secure the fundamental right
to privacy in the digital age.
Advertisers, apps, data brokers,
and others are constantly
tracking us. The websites we
visit, what we're doing, who our
friends are, what those friends
are searching for and clicking
on. And this has real harms and
affects your constituents'
wallets, raising the cost of
everything from insurance.
groceries. It doesn't have to be
this way. Good privacy laws can
promote innovation and allow
businesses to thrive while
protecting privacy. That's why
Epic supports HB 307, uh, and
how it places critical limits on
the data that companies collect
and how they can use it. These
data minimization rules better
align companies' data practices
with what consumers expect and
place important protection in
place for minors, prohibit
discrimination online.
That's why Epias committee
support HP 307. Thank you for
the opportunity to testify
today.
Whitney Holland
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Whitney Holland,
president of the American
Federation of Teachers New
Mexico. I represent thousands of
educators who are dedicated to
not only teaching, but also to
protecting the safety and
privacy of our students and
communities. This bill is vital
because it ensures that our
personal information is ours to
control, protecting us from
those who would misuse it
manipulate, harass or
discriminate. Educators like all
community members deserve to
know that our online activity
and locations aren't being
tracked without our consent.
This is especially crucial for
those in vulnerable.
situations. I urge you to
support this work to protect our
privacy and safety. Thank you.
Construento.
Good afternoon. My name is
Gwendoline Omana. I serve as a
reproductive justice program
manager
with the United.
Uh, today, thank you so much for
creating this opportunity for me
to express the urgency to
support each 307 because I see
this, this is not a partisan
issue. It's about safeguard the
individual freedom, sovereignty,
family privacy, and a small
business competition.
the profits from tracking and
selling our personal information
without consent, putting
children and families and
businesses at risk.
Parents should not be afraid of
what the children are visiting
online and they should be
knowing how to protect their
data and young people seeking
health information should be
protected from unwanted
tracking.
No one should
have their personal that
weaponized against them, whether
to manipulate consumer behavior,
influences, insurance rates or
target individuals seeking
productive healthcare
HB 307 restores control to the
individual by requiring
transparency and consent before
companies can collect and sell
personal data. It also
strengthens small businesses by
preventing monopolistic
corporations.
from using unfair data practices
to uncomplete local
entrepreneurs. This deals about
sovereignty, privacy. Thank you
so much.
Ellen Hengisbach.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Ellen Hegebach. I'm with Purg,
the public interest research
group, a nonprofit that
advocates on behalf of
consumers. We support HB 307
because it provides meaningful
rights and protections for New
Mexico consumers. When we use
our favorite apps, websites, or
smart devices, the companies on
the other side are often
gathering far more information
about us than what's necessary,
and they're often using that
data for a relevant purposes.
Just last month, the Texas
Attorney general.
Allstate for collecting people's
driving data without them
knowing.
We found that Allstate's data
broker was selling this
information widely online.
These practices are all too
common and are dangerous for
consumers' personal security.
The best thing for New Mexico
consumers is to change how
companies can collect and use
personal data upfront.
The bill does this by limiting
the processing of personal data
to what's necessary to provide
the product that consumer is
looking for. This will limit the
most harmful and dangerous
practices while still allowing
businesses to provide the
products and services that
consumers are looking for. Thank
you.
Um, let's go to, uh, opposition.
Anybody in in the room oppose
this bill.
Ready? We can get the attendant
to
Hold the microphone, you've got
one minute.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Jason
Weeks, registered lobbyist for
the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber
of Commerce. We very much
appreciate what the sponsor is
trying to do and um with the ALU
and EQ and M are trying to do
with this bill. However, we
think that this version of uh
data privacy goes too far in
terms of restricting how we
interact with the Internet. The
Internet is something that
typically makes our lives
easier. This though will
negatively impact how New Mexico
businesses that are Internet
based, offer their services on
the Internet.
Interact and how we all on a
daily basis interact with the
internet. We think that there's
better alternatives that are
less restrictive that accomplish
almost all of the same things
that this bill does, the other
thing that I would mention is,
this also has a private right of
action in it. So this could lead
to a flood of litigation in the
courts when an individual
consumer feels like they're
getting the wrong data or that
somebody is tracking their data
in violation of the bill. So,
for that reason, we urge that
the committee strongly evaluate
the issue and look at some of
the other alternatives.
that will be coming before this
committee.
Hi, good afternoon, chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Alison Riley, public
policy director with the New
Mexico Chamber of Commerce. We
understand the intent of the
bill and appreciate the
sponsor's work on this important
issue, however, in its current
form, we have challenges and
concerns, and would like the
opportunity to discuss this with
the sponsors and work on making
these necessary changes, but
right now we respectfully oppose
HB 307 as written. Thank you.
Uh, anybody on
Zoom.
Renzo Soto.
You have one minute.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Renzo Soto representing Technet
we likewise appreciate the
intent, but we are respectfully
opposed to the bill, um, as we
think it would significantly add
to the growing patchwork of data
privacy laws. We do support a
uniform interoperable privacy
standards, make sure that
there's consistency and
predictability for businesses
and consumers, however, the bill
does draw heavily from the
California Consumer Privacy Act,
which has been the most
burdensome state privacy law
that no other state has
replicated.
More specifically in like most
states that use an opt out model
307 has been discussed opt in
and a number of the prohibitions
placed on a covered entities are
also misaligned, which would
complicate compliance. We are
also concerned about the broad
rulemaking authority as well as
the private right of action on
the latter, we would know that
no other state offers to
enforcement mechanism in their
comprehensive data privacy
regulations. We also believe
that theo should instead
consider legislation that is
aligned with existing data to
privacy frameworks.
That have already passed in 18
other states. This will make
sure that the state has a
regulatory framework that
protects consumers while
ensuring businesses can comply.
Thank you for your time.
Chris Quigley, good afternoon,
Madam Chair and honorable
members of the committee. My
name's Chris Quigley on behalf
of the consumer Data Industry
Association. We are in
respectful opposition to HB 307.
1st and foremost, HB 307 ignores
that currently are heavily
regulated on privacy concerns at
the federal level. Federal
statutes such as the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, which regulates
how consumer reporting agencies
personal information in the
Graham Leach Bliley Act, which
requires financial institutions
and companies that offer
consumers products or services
to explain their information
sharing practices to their
customers and to safeguard
sensitive data. These federal
statutes exist to regulate
business practices where
information is collected and
protects the consumer.
HB 307 does not recognize that
businesses are currently
operating under these federal
regulations. We also have
additional concerns HB 307.
The definition of consumer
commercial credit, which is
traditionally traditionally
regulated differently than
consumer credit.
The measure lacks FCRA and GLBA
data and employment exemptions,
which already exist in 19
comprehensive privacy laws
across the country this bill an
outlier. In addition, we have
It is on.
Alrighty, thank you. Um, I'll
take, I'll ask the committee,
and does anybody have any
questions?
Representative on.
Oh.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um, OK,
yeah, I have.
Couple questions about this. OK,
so first and foremost I heard
data minimization.
Mentioned several times, Madam
Chair Representative and
experts, can you?
Explain that to me like I am 5,
please.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I'll
hand it over um to my expert.
Data minimization stands for the
very fundamental principle that
companies can only use your data
for the services you requested.
to pad their products, not to
sell it to data brokers, not to
do research that you didn't ask
for. So the notion is that if
you download a mobile game on
your phone in order to uh.
Play Candy Crush or jewel Match
or whatever you prefer. It might
need some of your information to
provide that service, but that
is not going to then turn around
and collect that information and
sell to data brokers who will
package it then to target you
with ads or other means. So data
minimization is this common
sense guard rail that your
information is being used in the
ways that you have asked for in
the ways that you expect.
OK, thank you. That, that helps
clear that up a little bit for
me, and so I've also heard about
other states passing the
legislation of like privacy
protection like Connecticut, for
example. So is this bill.
Like similar, are we like
modeling?
This language after what's been
done in Connecticut or any other
states or that's similar to that
or different.
Um, Madam Chair, um, I'll hand
it to my expert.
And Representative, this bill
builds on and improves what
we've seen in other states. It
does not start from scratch and
Connecticut's bill as well as
Maryland's bill and the age
appropriate design codes that
have passed in a handful of
states certainly are the
foundation for this particular
bill. The coalitions that came
together to draft this bill, did
so pulling from what we know was
successful in other states, and
also where we've seen them run
into First Amendment and other
issues. So we are learning from
their experience. That said,
this bill would be the strongest
goal.
in the country. One key
provision that goes beyond what
Connecticut or Maryland have
provided for is data
minimization.
Whereas those bills, especially
in Connecticut, for example, are
limited to what is disclosed in
a privacy policy, this bill will
no longer allow companies to
hide data practices in the
legalese of dozens and dozens of
pages of a privacy policy.
Likewise, many of those bills,
as was pointed out, are opt out.
I respectfully ask the committee
if they've ever gone through the
process of opting out of data
uses from the broadband
providers or whatnot. Uh, it can
be quite onerous. Instead, this.
Requires for companies if they
want to sell your data or target
you with ads, they have to ask
for your permission explicitly
first.
OK, thank you, so it sounds like
it's just a little bit more
expansive in terms of using
things like data minimization
now that I know what it means
and um transparency and having
to opt into things.
So, OK, cool. So lastly,
I want to know cause I'm hearing
about.
Tracking and like app tracking
and like.
Menstrual cycle app tracking,
things like that, so my question
then, lastly, is, are there any
New Mexico to our data being
sold by like outside to outside
and.
Thank you, madam, Madam Chair
Representative, that's a great
question. Um, I'll hand it,
the answer is absolutely. The
ways that our data can be
weaponized against us are most
profound in areas where we've
seen attacks on access to
abortion as well as access to
gender affirming care, as I
mentioned in my testimony, the
information that is collected
about us via our apps on our
phones or the businesses we
interact with is often then sold
on to data brokers who package
it up and that information then
is only.
clicks away to be available to
either federal or other state
agents, often for just pennies
for thousands and thousands of
data points on each individual a
particular concern of course is
your location data and it's been
very trivial for journalists and
other researchers to show that
they can purchase data on a
particular individual track the
movement of that device or
individual across state lines to
a clinic.
And then track their movements
hours later back home. It
doesn't take a lot a jump of
logic to and for what happened
or how that might be used to
harm that individual.
Madam Rocha is online too, can
provide some additional um.
Uh, information if necessary.
Ms. Rocha, did you want to
comment?
I'm, I'm here to answer any
questions related to the
provisions about minors. Um, so
people have specific questions
about that, how to answer.
Thank you.
Very much, Madam chair and um
presenters that includes my
question. Thanks. A
Representative Parajon.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative and experts.
Uh, Madam Chair, we just heard,
uh, from some of the lobbyists,
uh here uh for the chambers
that, you know, there's, there
would be a flood of litigation,
um, in courts frivolous
lawsuits, that's one of the
things that the FIR talks about,
um, so can you explain like why
they, why the enforcement
mechanism brings both the
private right of action and the
AG enforcement, why, why both of
them, Madam chair.
Madam Chair, Representative, um,
I'll have Mr. Winsky, um, answer
that.
Madam Chair and Representative,
the private right of action in
the agency enforcement are both
the center of the bill and they
work in connection together. I
think most of us consider our
privacy to be a deeply personal
right. Someone is peering in
through your living room window
at night. I don't think you
would want to have to resort to
a governmental official to
vindicate that right because of
its proximity to your the your
personhood and for that reason,
many privacy laws at the federal
level have allowed for a private
right of action to vindicate
your rights in court.
having to seek help from agency
official. This has become even
more important when many of our
data rights are so proximate to
other rights such as the right
to reproductive health or the
right to gender affirming care.
However
With major companies hoovering
up vast amounts of our data,
including from New Mexicans, uh,
it is quite possible that the
Attorney General will have a
keen interest in defending the
rights of the citizens of New
Mexico en masse, and for that
reason there is also provided
for agency enforcement and we've
seen past attorneys general of
New Mexico use agency
enforcement through things like
children's online privacy
Protection Act.
I'm sure and um representative
and and experts, so when.
For instance, when I, um, like
consent to use an app and that
privacy notification comes up.
Do I, I'm effectively signing
away when I click like I
consent, so how would this bill
be different from, um, like the
current notifications that come
up, um, you know, that are
really, really long like would
this bill just be like another
line in that extensively long
contract of adhesion that I, you
know.
When I say I consent to use this
app that I'm sure.
Madam Chair Representative,
thank you. It would not be, and
there are two reasons for that.
One is the minimization
guardrails that we described
entities would be limited to
using your information for the
purposes that you provided the
or the purpose that provided
for, so you would not have to
worry that some mobile game has
buried in its privacy policy,
uncouth practices of your or
uses of your information.
Instead, you would be able to
rest easy knowing that whatever
is in that legalese is something
that makes sense. The other
reason is that
explicit explicit requirements
around the consent provision
that it needs to be standalone,
clear and approachable for an
ordinary person and that will
help make it clear. They should
also help reduce some of that
pop-up fatigue that we all
suffer from, the places where
you are allowed to opt in or to
the sale of your information and
to various kinds of advertising
based on your personal
information, so companies would
not be able to seek all sorts of
uses outside of those limited
statutory provided provision.
Madam Chair and um
representative expert.
So what limit um that the aging
all state for selling.
Is this just allowing us to sue
in state a little bit more about
how that.
Madam Chair and Representative,
the reason that we have not
necessarily seen individuals
seeking to file suit protect
their privacy is because many
states have chosen not to
include it in their
comprehensive state privacy
bills, often in the face of
effective lobbying campaigns by
technology companies and their
associations and this previous
year, Senator Monique Priestley
of Vermont or represented of
Vermont
held a hearing pulling together
legislators from a variety of.
states that shed a lot of light
on the lobbying tactics
included.
That's not to say that there is
no privacy rights and we have
seen individuals use existing
state laws and a variety of
ways, for example, the video
privacy Protection Act is one
example of a law that does
provide a private right of
action, individuals are using
that in ways to address modern
data harms.
and representative, so, um.
Would
The, I mean, if the FCC passed a
word.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
this bill has an exception for
all federal privacy and
cybersecurity laws. So
particular information is
already covered by a federal
law, it would not be covered by
this particular bill, and that's
both recognizing the potential
compliance costs that companies
could face by trying to deal
with multiple privacy or
cybersecurity laws and also the
fact that the supremacy Clause
is part of the law of the land
if there were a conflict,
federal law would prevail.
despite comments from previous
commenters for those provisions.
So if, for example, the FCC were
to establish broadband privacy
rules like those that were
previously on the books, federal
law would cover that particular
information.
I want to highlight an important
distinction here. The exception
in this bill applies only to
information that is covered by
federal laws, not to entities,
and that's particularly critical
because we've, for example, seen
some major tech companies
purchases pharmacy lines. Those
pharmacy lines are covered by
HIPAA. If you were to exempt the
entire entity, you would be
allowing those big tech
corporations that completely
disregard New Mexico's decision
about how to protect its
citizens' data.
Chairing representative, I think
that clarifies my last question,
but um.
Yeah, my question was, you know,
it seems like.
Regulation of the information is
so broad, um, because there's so
much information, um, but.
But to regulate the entity that
um.
Is that what
And representative, uh, I would
say it's critical that we not
base exceptions to the privacy
bill at the entity level because
it would create massive
loopholes and for example, uh
some information at the federal
level, some laws at the federal
level regulate student
information.
Google has a education focused
product. If you were to exempt
the entire entity in all of
Google would be executed from
this particular bill. So it's
critical to focus on exempting
data.
In order to avoid creating
massive loopholes here.
Thank you
Thank you, Chairman Lenton.
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
Our colleague represent Pajon
asked a lot of the questions
that that I wanted to ask.
That law school is paying off.
Um, and, and this may sound, I
don't intended to be funny, but
when you have your cell phone
around and I'll be in my office
and you think something and you
open up Facebook and it's on
there, right? That's weird, it's
a weird phenomenon.
Is that a matter of that this
law would would try to affect
not necessarily.
I thought something, but if I'm
talking to somebody about
something.
Listening to us.
Is that something that this law
would
Madam Chair and Representative,
thank you. Uh, there's no hard
evidence that Facebook and other
companies are listening to us
through our phones. I doubt that
they are telepathically dropping
into our thoughts yet, but
Neuralink is a company that
exists in the world, but as I've
had it shared in conversations
with others the past couple of
days, it's because they don't
need to. All of your searches,
all of your browsing online, the
places that you visit and the
people you associate with
including the.
We are all together in this room
at this moment, uh, is being
packaged up and sold and
profiles, and that is very, very
deep view of our lives in the
inner workings of our lives,
making it unnecessary for them
to have to eavesdrop onto our
thoughts.
Awesome. And one last question,
Madam Chair,
representative and experts then
if, if, if this is mirrored on a
we're saying that this will be a
gold standard even above that
law, um.
How so?
Uh, with, with all due respect
to the previous commentators and
and the great state of
California where I am barred,
uh, I, California's law is based
primarily on individual data
rights, your right to delete,
your right to access. That means
that you need to proactively go
after these companies, which can
be major tech companies or data
brokers that try to slip in
through the cracks of laws or
dodge agency enforcement, and
that is not a fight that is fair
to ask every individual to
pursue thousands and thousands
of companies that are processing
their information.
So one key way this bill builds
on our experience in other
states that data minimization
provision that we described at
the top, which is the common
sense safeguard that the
companies that are collecting
your information can only do so
for the reasons that you gave
them that information.
Then the other critical thing is
the opt in and opt out and it
changes the calculus of who has
to have the burden of wanting to
sell your information or use it
for targeted advertising.
existing law, you have to do it.
You have to go ask the company
to not use your information in
those ways. This turns that on
its head and says no.
The Googles or the meadows or
the data brokers, they are the
ones who should be asking you
for permission. And so it's in
those two critical respects this
builds on our experience in
other states. Thank you and I
have one more question, follow
up. Uh, I appreciate you, you
clarifying before this hearing
that we will not be taking a
vote because there apparently is
a slew of other bills, maybe a
series of others that are
related to this in some way,
shape or form, and so
Are, are you all building a
package together or or is this a
standalone bill? I guess it's
understood the process now.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Representative. I, I just
found out about the other slew
of bills today, so.
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Alrighty, uh, representative uh
Matthews.
Thank you Madam Chair, um.
Thank you presenters and
everybody in the room. This is a
huge
Important topic, um.
And I think the solution to it
is going to take a lot of our
time and energy trying to figure
out what is the best course, but
I'm curious whether or not
you're your proposed statute.
Would, would be retroactive.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
thank you, Representative. I'll
hand it over to, um, Mr. Vinsky
and just to say you all are very
lucky to have him because he
will only be here for a few
days, so, um, I'll I'll hand it
over to him.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you representative. Uh, my
understanding of the bill is
that it is not retroactive and
that's for a few constitutional
reasons that generally prohibits
uh making conduct criminalized
after the fact and also the fact
that there's some First
Amendment case law that
generally says once someone is
legally obtained information,
they're entitled to do with it
as they please, that can be very
irksome from a privacy
perspective, but of course it's
the ACLU we are deeply aware of
First Amendment jurisprudence
and want any.
we support to be in line with
it.
Thank you. uh, Madam Chair, uh.
So this is primarily a criminal
bill.
Uh, I, excuse me, Madam Chair
Representative, it does not have
criminal penalties. I met
criminalized spoke a bit, but
the constitution generally
prohibits prescribing. So, Madam
chair, uh.
Presenter, this is a civil bill.
With civil penalties and no
criminal penalties.
that is correct.
And the man of the the.
Under the civil
Um
portion
Not the sole portion, but the
civil remedies.
Um, does that include both
injunctive relief and or.
Financial.
damages.
Madam Chair and Representative,
yes.
Includes both injunctive relief
and damages.
And, uh, Madam Chair, what, what
is the range of damages in your
Madam Chair and Representative,
uh, the bill differentiates
between willful or negligent
violations of the bill in order
to not sweep up uh.
Yes.
Mere noncompliance of
negligence. I believe that I'm
looking for the exact provisions
here it's 2500 for negligent
violations and 7500 for willful
violations.
And uh.
I'm sure
It
And presenters do um you came by
my office this morning and you
left me some materials, but I'm
wondering as we looking at a
number of different potential
bills on this topic.
Um, do you have some kind of a
fairly detailed kind of thing
that's going to allow us to
compare to other bills that were
being asked to.
Consider
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Representative, as I
mentioned, um, I didn't know
that there was going to be other
bills, but we can definitely do
um side by sides uh once we have
taken the time to read those
bills.
Um, Madam Chair, I,
I, I would personally appreciate
that and um I think it would be
helpful to maybe many of us, if
you all would be willing to do
that.
Um
My last question is, um, Madam
Chair, um, these.
These, uh
Players on the internet.
Um
You know, we have some names
that have been there forever,
Google and
Microsoft and so forth and so
on, but certainly a lot of the
organizations or the businesses
that are out there collecting
data and doing all kinds of
things.
Um
are
Uh, they have the resources, if
you will, to change their
identity.
Probably pretty quickly.
Um, I would assume that they
probably
Um, businesses that are in the
business of
Fraud and misrepresentation
often engaged in fraud and
misrepresentation to hide their
activities, and I'm wondering if
your bill.
Addresses
That and how realistic it is.
Sorry, it's a double barrel
question here and how realistic
it is to think.
That
We really can stop.
And have
Good remedies for.
The abuse of the privacy rules
and so.
I think you're right in that one
the natures of many of the
industries that use and abuse
our data is.
Oh, excuse me,
Madam Chair,
uh, that is, I think that is a
correct observation that many of
the industries that use and
abuse our data often do so in
the shadow of the law at best,
and that is one of the reasons
that the private right of action
is so fundamental. Many of our
agencies are doing the best that
they can to keep up with this
very quickly evolving industry,
we've seen many reports from the
Federal Trade Commission, from
attorneys general at the state
level there were years and years
and years in the making
requiring hundreds of
If not thousands of hours of
people power and that's where
the private right of action can
help alleviate that strain on
enforcers from being the sole
focal point of holding these
companies to account. I'm quite
sure that people would be happy
to vindicate their privacy
rights in light of these
incursions.
Thank you, Madam Sheriff. Thank
you presenters.
Thank you. Uh, Representative
Cerrado.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank
you, uh, representative Thank
you expert. So just for full
transparency, I'm the one, I'm
one of the ones that has a bill
up, and I don't think it's so
just want to be clear, um, and
surely, you know, the goal here
is to get to some place that is
better for New Mexicans. So I
ask these questions just to kind
of um on that. I was I had two
questions, and one's very
expensive. I don't like no one's
ever really answer this for me,
I think, but I'm just curious.
So I know we're looking at
American laws state by state.
How does it, is this is at all
compared to what they've done in
the EU at all in those
protections, or is this
completely
just a different, is that just a
comparison.
Representative, in many ways it
does have very close
relationship to data privacy
protections in the EU and now
the United Kingdom as well. uh
for starts, many of the data
rights that were first pioneered
in law there have flown through
to California and every state
law, including this provision,
but the EU is one example of a
law that has incorporated data
minimization standards is a key
part of its Article 5, and those
are enshrined here as well. I
also know that Maryland has been
working hard and included.
minimization and its
comprehensive privacy law that
it passed last year.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative. Thank you
expert for that. Um, you know,
I, I appreciate what you're
saying with the gold standard
and the opt-out and the
comparison. I, I, I get it. It
makes sense in a lot of ways.
The concern that I, I will bring
up is that New Mexico is in a
massive state. We're pretty
small. And when we do things
that are, we're, we're big in
spirit, we're small in size. And
when we do things that are, that
are, that are outside of the
norm, um, and it's fine, like we
do a lot of things that are that
are uniquely Mexican and they're
important to do so. Um, but when
it's affecting such a broad, um,
of businesses in such a broad
spectrum of consumers in such a
broad spectrum of populations,
um, it's, it's, it's, it can be
tricky, right? So my question
is, you said that California
does not
does not have the ops in either.
So we would be, so how many
other states have the opt-in at
this point.
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
New Mexico would be leading the
way in defining an opt in and
it's really important to
emphasize that the opt-in
provision is limited to the sale
of your information and the use
of that information for targeted
advertising and many of the
other provisions in the bill are
designed to accommodate the uses
that are necessary for
businesses to function. Thank
you, thank you for that, uh,
Madam Chair, and representative
and expert. So we, OK, so we'd
be the first that would have an
opt.
In structure and that is falling
off of what represented Arahan
said, would be very clearly
stated at the upfront.
Is that also part of this as
well, to speak.
That representative, yes. OK,
thank you so much.
Thank you. uh, Representative
Fernandez. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Um
my
OK
Yeah, we have a good, we have a
good committee here, um.
I do have a couple things, a
couple of um
Challenges that I see coming,
especially when it comes to
business, um,
In the FIR it says businesses
will face significant
administrative costs to comply
with this bill, page 3.
Um, so, and I could totally see
it between the legal side of
having to defend themselves, um,
as well as all of the IT costs
to change this around and make
sure that they are complying
with everything.
Um
I mean, how, how will
How will small businesses in the
state.
For this, um, and
I mean, I guess we could even go
further than that.
How much do you think something
like this would cost, and I know
that that is a crazy estimate to
ask for, but
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Representative, um, I can
hand it over to the expert.
One of the benefits excuse me,
Madam Chair and representative,
one of the benefits of the fact
that we were pulling lessons
learned in other states, many of
the aspects of the technological
infrastructure are already being
developed. I mentioned, for
example, that Maryland is
already included some data
minimization provisions in their
comprehensive consumer privacy
bill that was passed last year,
and businesses are preparing for
that, uh, similarly, we, we are
now well aware that businesses
have the infrastructure for
exercising rights to the elite,
rights to access information and
things like that.
questions were posed 10 years
ago or 5 years ago when
California was implementing its
privacy law that this should be
technologically impossible, but
we've seen that it is. That
said, we are very much cognizant
of the fact that a small mom and
pop business is not a meta or an
alphabet, and we'd be happy to
continue having those
conversations.
And Madam Chair and
Representative, um, um, Miss
Rocha who's online, can add to
that as well. Thank you. Thank
you, Madam Chair, um, to touch
on a few of the lessons that we
have learned from other states.
I will say that California and a
number of other states have
classified the personal
information of children as
sensitive personal information
and in those states already
require data minimization when
it comes to that. And so, there
are states and there is an
infrastruc
where people are already
complying, um, with a lot of the
concepts that are in this bill
with regard to users under the
age of 18.
Thank you for that.
Um. Figure out which
Um
I mean
Another thing that I worry
about, and again, business, and
I don't really need.
Yes, but, um,
You know,
So many companies for the last
years, probably.
Go buy Facebook ads.
Go by digital. Go do all of this
stuff. That is the way that the
world is work.
If something like this passes,
and it's opt in, um, what we saw
with iOS 14 when you had the opt
in on your phone now was that it
dropped by like 70%.
Now it's just anonymized ads.
You don't see any less. You
probably actually see more, but
they're kind of
And approaching, let's see what
we hit in the ether and see if
it works.
Um, I'm worried again that, that
that number gets even smaller in
our state.
that
The small businesses, the local
mom and pop shops.
are going to continue to suffer.
They will, they advertising
costs will go through the roof
there, the amount of people that
are relevant that it is.
Smaller and smaller.
Um, and again, just another
Business cost, um, and again, I
don't need an answer on that.
Um
Yeah, I, I
I think that's it. I'm, I'm
concerned about a whole bunch of
stuff, um, uh, the business
costs, uh, frivolous lawsuits
which have already all been
talked about, uh.
First Amendment rights stuff,
um, opt in small business. I, I
just think that
This
data privacy is so important,
but I think that this goes a
little too far for us to be
leading.
Um, in this realm, uh,
Washington state.
Earlier this year, um, enacted
new data privacy laws and now
there's a whole bunch of ad
types you can buy in the state,
um.
And I'm afraid that some of that
stuff is going to uh, you know,
translate if, if something that
goes this far.
Um, is enacted. I think that I
don't think that where we are
now is adequate.
But I think that this is a
little far, so I'm hoping that
somewhere in here we can get to
a nice metal.
So, thank you, Madam Chair. I
got.
Well, uh thank you all for the
discussion today. We're gonna
temporarily hold off on.
We have another, oh.
I apologize, I don't have you on
the list, uh, Chairman De la
Cruz.
Thank you, Adam Chair.
It was this draft or this bill
vetted through the AG's office
in anticipation there would be
likely litigation.
And, and I'm sure there's other
litigation in other states, so.
Two questions, Madam Chair.
Was this better through the AG's
office.
And
Can you talk about other
litigation.
Or or litigation in other
states.
Ettinger, representative, I'll
I'll hand it over to my expert.
Madam Chair Representative,
thank you so much for the
question on this bill, discussed
some bill language and we're
excited to keep discussing.
And Chairman Representative, I,
I'll just Lena's comments, uh,
she, she stated that we were in
conversations during the interim
with the AG's office and are
looking forward to continuing
those conversations on that
front.
Manpresentative turning to the
question of litigation, you
know, it's a fact in this
country that anyone can sue over
anything, so we can't say that
there will be any litigation
whatsoever, but this bill was
drafted with very careful
attention to many of the wises
of jurisprudence that have risen
in litigation around privacy
bills in general and kids'
privacy bills specifically, as I
mentioned at the top for the
ACLU protecting the freedom of
speech and consistency with the
First Amendment is a top
priority for us as well as
protection.
privacy and so we paid very keen
attention to recent
developments, the courts of
appeals and challenges to, for
example, California's
age-appropriate design code. We
watch very carefully in the
litigation around platforms
editorial decision rights and
things of that nature and this
bill is drafted not only with
those recent decisions in mind
but also looking back over how
privacy bills have been held
upheld for years and for
example, courts of appeals have
upheld providing people the
right to opt in or opt out of
data usage.
They've also upheld regulations
of credit reporting agencies,
Equifax and the such, and those
are in many ways the original
data broker, so this bill we've
drafted to be consistent with
that, be happy to continue that
conversation about specific
potential First Amendment
implications.
Madam Chair, can you describe
Representative
The types of
Data businesses, app businesses
that would be affected.
Because it seems like this is a
pretty expensive expensive bill.
And I'm curious what effect it
would have on on online
businesses that may not
necessarily be the ones we
typically think of, such as
Google.
And uh
And you talk about that a bit,
ma'am sure, thank you.
Madam Chair and Representative,
this bill would cover 3 types of
businesses. It would cover
businesses that directly collect
information from consumers,
businesses that engage in data
brokerage and businesses that
use data for targeted
advertising, so it falls in
those three particular
categories, and those three
particular categories were
chosen for two reasons. One,
they present the most salient
data threats that have emerged
through research and through
people's experiences online and
2, those are where
The First Amendment
jurisprudence is strongest for
regulation. So we were very
mindful of that. It is worth
noting that part of the prongs
of defining a covered entity is
that they provide an online
feature or service. So your mom
and pop shop would not be
covered by the bill to the
extent that they are simply
operating a physical business.
Similarly, the bill exempts the
provision of physical goods or
services as well. So many of our
small businesses that operate
on.
Street would not be covered from
the bill because they are not
part of the online ecosystem
that engages in those three
covered practices.
So the definition of mom and
pop.
and very
Because there are lots of
businesses.
Of various sizes that.
After in their estimation to
conduct their business.
Inquire of things that relate to
their business.
Uh
How would that affect those
types of businesses? Is it
because?
Yeah, you're asked questions
even by
Madam Chair and Representative.
Obviously mom and pop shop is
not a defined term in the bill,
but many aspects of the bill, I
think would align with the
practices that the businesses in
our communities are already
employing every day, for
example, the data minimization
rule that information can only
be used to provide the services
you ask. I think most of us know
that when we visit our local
grocery store or our favorite
restaurants, they're not turning
around and selling the fact that
we were there in order to make
an extra buck off our patronage
in many ways the data practices
that are.
Chief concern in this bill have
been employed by large online
corporations as opposed to the
small businesses in our
communities.
Madam Chair, I'm just trying to
wrap my head around this because
I'm asked questions all the
time.
I go on, on uh.
YouTube.
And it pops up with questions
about shampoo.
Or whatever.
Uh, sometimes even smaller
businesses will do the same
thing. They'll send me something
after the fact.
Uh
Or a purchase to inquire if I'm
interested in other types of
purchases.
What happens in those
situations?
March.
Madam Chair Representative, in
those particular cases, you as
the consumer would have the
opportunity to tell that
business. Yes, I want to hear
from you. I want you to follow
up with me, and that's the power
of the opt-in right, so that way
that when you interact with that
small business in your
community, they have your
information, they know you are a
patron. You can provide them
that opt in and say, yes, I
would like you to follow up. Let
me know about your latest deals.
It's also worth noting that I in
this particular case with the
bill regulates is, is targeted
advert
in first advertising is based
off personal information that
the company has on you. So other
types of advertising that
businesses rely on like
contextual advertising, you
visit a sports website and there
is an ad for the local sports
team on that website or website
based off large geographic areas
are exempted from the bill and
accommodated by its provisions.
This is more common, Madam
Chair. I, uh, I absolutely, I
get it.
I think anybody with common
sense gets it. I'm concerned
about.
It being a little bit
Overreaching
Um
When I hear the word gold
standard. I don't hear gold
standard. I hear it
overreaching.
Um, because
California is just
Huge already.
Thank you, man.
Thank you. Anybody else on the
committee?
Going once, going twice, OK, um,
as I said at the beginning of
the hearing, uh, we're gonna,
we're not gonna have any action.
I appreciate the discussion. Uh,
we will be in contact, uh, I'm
sure, and uh we will hopefully
the next couple bills will, will
catch up and um we'll have
