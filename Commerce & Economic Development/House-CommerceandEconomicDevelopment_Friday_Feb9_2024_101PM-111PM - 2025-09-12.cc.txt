A madam mister speaker kind lady
where does it say that it
applies to section nine in the
bill.
The.
Thank you mr speaker thank you
gentle eighty in house built two
section nine is contingent on
house bill when ninety six.
Thank you mr speaker kind lady I
believe this bill.
Or in in section nine where
those projects are.
Uhm this bill that we're
speaking about now just creates
that fund and
that's the way I understand it
mr speaker gentle lady
unfortunately everything in
section nine.
Would be covered by the
contingency for a house bill
when ninety six which means mr
speaker gentle lady all of the
member projects that are not
going to agency is that are
going to agencies but also we're
going to cargs.
Would need to um follow this
entire procedure as well.
Madam mister speaker general
lady the grow money is not a
pilot project I am referring to
just the pilot projects.
In section nine.
Mr speaker gentle lady
we are pretty confident that the
contingency language does apply
to everything and section nine.
Mr speaker kind lady I believe
my amendment only applies to
those pilot projects.
Mr speaker and gentle lady um
you're amendment seems to me to
simply be putting back in what
was removed and mr speaker
general lady it was removed
because uhm the cards cannot
handle the requirements that
would be instituted as a result
of this.
Mr speaker kind lady I
believe.
That i'm really only putting
back in what I what was
originally in the bill to set
guard rails for the.
Pilot projects I understand what
you're saying that section nine
includes the grow money
and possibly the cars but mr
speaker account lady we've had
information about the kind of
money that we might be receiving
a majority from oil and gas and
we.
Should have been making these
decisions way before four or
five days left and
making sure that we can
implement something that is
going to be that has guard rails
even the you know the grow money
the I think mister speaker can
be the only reason that we're
talking about the growing money
is because it was taken I don't
I really don't believe that this
is part of the pilot projects.
Mr speaker gentle lady uhm
I I think that that is correct
that when lfc
drafted this bill and and was
endorsed by lfc
you know the grow money or not
junior money was not included.
Unfortunately mr speaker and
gentle lady the way that it is
put in house bill too.
It is included and
you know there are many
wonderful member projects that
are running through our councils
of government but
the
um
what would be required of them
is simply unmanageable and so
they had requested you know as
part of they're being able to
manage the the funds they cannot
accommodate this thank you mr
speaker kind lady while I would
suggest we go to the senate and
move it to a different section.
Um thank you mr spent err mr
speaker thank you i'm gentle
lady unfortunately I am being
told that the senate has already
I passed their final drafting
instructions.
Thank you mr speaker kind lady I
understand the concern but i'm I
I also understand that we need
guard rails this is in just the
pilot projects alone it's two
hundred and sixteen million
dollars and in my opinion with
no guard rails were in mr
speaker kind lately we're saying
we're going to work together and
I have full confidence that we
can work together but why would
we put this kind of money out
with no guard rails.
And mr speaker kind lady you
know I wish that for some reason
I didn't understand that when we
were in our hearing whenever it
was all the days are running
together that the carg money
that grow money that has gone to
cogs is part of this bill I did
not understand it to be that way
when it was presenting whether I
missed it or not or or maybe it
wasn't revealed i'm not sure.
Thank you mr speaker think
you're gentle lady with
reverence to the and other
moneys that are included in
section nine um the house worked
with the senate to incorporate
guard rails in those programs in
those appropriations.
Mr speaker kind lady I
appreciate that but do you have
a copy.
I'm thinking mr speakers think
you're gentle lady and I do not
have a copy but when the bill
comes over from the senate we
will be able to see those thank
you mr speaker kind lady I I
really appreciate that but we
are hearing this bill now and so
we're passing legislation and
la.
Before we actually know what the
guard rails are and it's just
concerning to me mister speaker
can lady I I really do
appreciate that there to know
that that's in there
but I have not seen it and right
now we're just talking about
this bill
thank you mr speaker think
you're gentle lady umm I I
certainly
agree with you about the need
for guard rails and
accountability and one of the
things that I think are
legislative finance committee
staffed as particularly is
provide members with.
Regular updates in information
program evaluations we have
talked about the report cards so
that is members we can monitor
progress and you know in one of
the benefits um.
Over for the bill and I realize
i'm
the.
Speaking about the bill
as and how the amendment may be
affected is to provide us with
an opportunity to reassess the
effectiveness of programs
so I do think that you know it
is important to continue to have
the opportunity to work with our
legislative finance committee
but also this is an opportunity
for us to really re evaluate the
entire way that we do
accountability measurements in
in government here and so while
I do appreciate the amendment I
think it is very well
intentioned I don't think that
it is actually what we want to
do today with this bill i'm and
so mr speaker gentle lady i'm
unfortunately I cannot support
the amendment thank you
and the amendment there's for
debate to german from lee
representatives
thank you speaker will the
channel from control and those
several countries you have
please yes mister speaker I
yield to the gentleman from
this picture generally
the transparency around this
piece of legislation
is.
Fairly op
only actually internet website
is five pages of nothing more
than setting up the part
it was only have to I started
making some increase that I
discovered that there were.
A number of allocated.
Projects that this formed was
going to support over three
years period
this picker generally.
I sort of videos without these
gord
not as.
A government accountability
legislation.
But as an omnibus spending.
