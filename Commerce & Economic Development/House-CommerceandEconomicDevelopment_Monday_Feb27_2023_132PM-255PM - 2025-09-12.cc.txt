And also

Working on passing Texas I also

Thank you the.
What has to do is to have that
Madam chair representative that
we.
At.
At.
Eight hours of this isn't about
growing that number.
that will be madam chair that I
might ask how.
This is like the these.
It.
Relevant to this conversation
I'm fine with that and just
curious.
Representative can you respond
or is that something within the
community.
Contact yes chair of
the commission Madam chair
representative for those
professions that we oversee and
have responsibility for plumbers
electricians and such we
actually worked very closely
with higher education department
to ensure that there are
adequate programs available for
individuals to get licensed
we've recently taken a trip to
Washington DC to work with for
example the manufactured housing
Association they have a training
program so that we can increase
the number of manufactured
housing installers that we have
to New Mexico and so we do work
with entities either
associations that provide the
training for higher education
that provides three need help
increased where they're
shortages.
Thank you very much.
Thank you madam chair I want we
have an amendment late are there
this morning we got a thing from
the department of labor that
they have some changes on the
language so if we can maybe give
you guys that are maybe doing
amendment this committee madam
chair.
usually do a twenty four hour
Response on on amendments have
with what is the amendment it's
madam chair it's striking five
words and serving three.
So can you go ahead and let us
know on page one.
It's just.
One twenty one.
Strike is.
And then strike for and
registered with and.
So strict that replace it with
after.
Online twenty one after and.
between and and registered
participate in a.
So the sentence would read.
One twenty one a trade from a
licensed employer and.
Participates in a registered
ship apprenticeship program.
Okay so we need to get please
Right from the license employers
and.
Participates in a.
Registered apprenticeship
program.
Yes Sir yes that came from
workforce solutions with early
this morning request.
Okay so let.
What's the desires a committee
regarding the cat on.
Want to share that on the one on
one time.
Act okay.
Representative Mr wanted to go
ahead and give your the other
one thank you madam chair
representative members.
Representative question.
Makes sense and so I have to pay
for life.
Life as an architect or
engineer.
I get the rest of that is what
we're all construction sites.
That one does not sound.
Madam chair representative
that's a really good question
and the reason is because
architects and engineers are
already under their scope of
practice authorized to do work
on elevators are authorized to
do the design their authorized
their authorized to do one of
those things and so we can't we
can't prohibit them or require
them to get licensed under C. ID
for something that is already
within their scope of work.
At that sure why we need the
money.
There.
Madam chair representative again
it's just because we if we don't
have that language here then
there's an assumption that they
can't do the work that's
required within their scope of
work.
Right now after.
Okay so right chair
representative of the regional.
Okay.
The data form should.
I will.
It is the.
Let's go to she was so we've got
to do passed motion on the
original or the first
Language amendment here.

Okay it was for Duncan and use.
Yes.
Okay so Representative at and
you you.
Things that serves seventy five
percent of the syllables.
Thank you madam chair
Representative so knowing that
this bill does not apply
commercially.
I was alarmed to hear that there
is no regulation for non
commercial elevators so my
question.
Really comes from a place of
like personal phobias do you
know what how many elevator
failure calls to like private
small tribal leaders there are
roughly a year that this would
help alleviate that with them.
Action.
share.
Representative there's no way to
tell
I have there is.
Accidents

in New Mexico.
I used to run around a hundred
meters.
Katie got a call back.

Thank you very much thank you.
Right anybody else.
Okay all right what's the desire
of the committee.
This
is.
This.
Representative and in order yes
Representative don't.
Representative Hernandez yes.
Representative Lente yes
Representative little yes
Representative Lundstrom yes.
Representative Martinez.
Representative Mason.
Yes.
Representative Matthews.
Yes.
Madam vice chair yes.
yes about those ten votes yes
service for.
We have an amended bill thank
you.
There is a committee for your
afternoon.
I need to see how.
So.
Representative Duncan are you.
Are you an existing.
House Bill for provision of
Allison is I am the co sponsor
all right.
Representative Allison look at.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you madam chair.
You have to do the members of
the committee.
The secretary representing house
bill four four nine.
And all those pages.
I can sum this up in just two or
three sentences.
Okay this bill is revising the
eligibility for assistant to
displace workers declaring an
emergency and what this bill
does is it helps lines hello.
The energy transition act was
supposed to happen follow and
what this bill does is just like
how we're going to do that and
my expert witness this afternoon
the survey to more she is the
department of the.
Yes but secretary or workforce
solutions.
Madam chair.
Would you like the same thing
right now just wait for Christ
questions or so thank you madam
chair members of the committee
CPAS then when I think
Representative Allison
representative Duncan the other
co sponsors for bring this
forward basically the original
energy transition actually out
all the provisions on the first
seven pages that is
Representative Allison said this
our changes are just on the last
page some of the requirements
that the Act impose sort of
assumes that the act would be
administered as a plant was
closing but as things actually
happened in the four corners
they are started occurring as
early as is twenty twenty and
the money was not available to
be distributed to the displaced
workers and we don't want to
leave those workers out of those
benefits so this eliminates the
requirement that we can only
look back one year to make these
benefits more broadly eligible
and does not change the amount
of money available for change
anything else about the thank
you.
Madam chair we stand for
questions.
Right here favor this bill.
Everybody here because of them.
At the start of this kind of the
room.
Thank you madam chair members of

supported that was funding about
twenty million dollars to help
the displaced workers of that
territory or of that plan
and unfortunately to the state
must understand as much of that
money is not been available to
those workers so we do this as a
way to kind of keep poll
promises made to our workers to
make sure that they're able to
transition into other jobs for
that reason we very much
appreciate.
Thank you.
Yes madam chair members the

Eighty five percent of all these

Hundreds of folks that have not.
The probably the moved away to
get a job somewhere else or they
haven't been helped at all and
so I'm in strong support of this
and would like to keep them in
New Mexico is it all possible
thank you.
Representative.
Thank you madam chair I do have
a few questions out like to
start with
the energy transition acting
general.
can you all tell me they don't
care whether workers were
started to be terminated I was
at home on the.
Madam chair representative
Lundstrom at the most of the
layoffs occurring twenty twenty
two but we have heard from you
representatives that layoffs
begin and twin.
The last actually started and
two years ago chair and Madam
chair representative Lundstrom
yes that is our understanding as
of the source madam chair your
tax funds.
Madam chair representative once
for my understanding is the
economic decided not to issue
those funds for this purpose and
just gave us again the state
money from other sources to
find concerned sources madam
chair.
Madam chair representative
Lindstrom I'm I'm not a player
that money came from.
Representative at first you need
to answer that question for.
Madam chair representative
Armstrong.
I believe that so the way it was
going to work.
Legislation bonds which is for
retirements in San Juan
generation.
And then for the replacement
generation afterwards workforce
that was gonna go to the state.
That comes directly state for
twenty.
madam chair.
That is not aware of the changes
resulting.
So I I just failed madam chair
that is
the agency representation of
what's going to happen.
What we understood was going to
happen manages operation what
actually happened.
And I believe that these funds
these at.
The end of lost connections I
think it's important everybody
understands that what was
required we thought we were
going to get didn't happen.
And
I just wonder at this point.
This legislation in place madam
chair how do we know that the
funding is going to go to work
and then I used the
Madam chair representative once
during that time I can't speak
for the other funds but for the
displaced workers systems funds
which is twelve million of the
twenty million of that money was
received by the state in late
July of twenty twenty two and
transferred to our department is
still subject to appropriations
so that will that language will
ultimately end up in H. we too
so that we can spend the money
but we have prepared a displaced
worker plan as required by the
Energy tradition Act and it
provides not just for the
expenditure of this money for
correct assistance to workers
but also the full range of
employment reemployment services
and training opportunities that
we provided all mass layoffs and
we share that with a number of
sources and be happy to share
with the rest of the committees
that would actually which is our
business federal money that in
years our.
Madam chair representative on
Strom not for this purpose but
we in general receive federal
funds for rapid response to mass
layoffs and we're making sure
that our area offices in this
region extending those
opportunities to displace
workers as well madam chair able
plans which workers trying to
place the fate of the end of the
day and closed down two major R.
one.
And investing in the economy and
what that would be able to help.
This call to the same kind of
thing where these people where
they need to be trained for.
Madam chair representative
Lundstrom we don't spam direct
that where they are we trained
for but we make the
opportunities available to them
that we hosted a bridge class
for example at this in one
community college that expose
them to all the different trades
and opportunities that are
available through that college
and explained to them how to go
about the process of getting
funds to ten this training we've
also worked at the
superintendent of regulation
licensing to ensure that if and
folks need to be tested for
licensed professions that they
have opportunity to get study
materials and we've made that
that process is as easy as
possible so we'll work with the
the workers to help them
accomplish whatever career
building half of this year
Data service sure you have a
listing of all available
settling down yeah.
What are those available things.
Okay training for women to for
they don't have the normal.
Madam chair Representative
Lundstrom yes our local office
has the appointment served on
the access to the employment
database that shows all the
openings and stuff come in to
register for unemployment or to
get career counselling connect
them with the those
opportunities.
Madam chair of the money gets.
To get to talk about you're
adding more money jungle and
have low happens to people when
you have major injuries lows
down there's not an immediate
place for them to move out to
the end of the building out of
state and their skills and
traits that's going on so I hope
that we do have.
Job placement for them at the
end of the day and I hope that
the money gets worse thank you
madam chair thank you.
Representative Littles.
Yes I'm sure to the past.
Okay at least as we still have a
couple.
Sessions but we'll get back to
that thank you.
Representative of Martinez and
thank you madam chair
Representative
off of health questions.
What you want.
Currently in the energy
transition the first one.
Madam chair representative
Martinez the energy transition
instructed you to prospective
tenants.
Five thousand.
How much of the home page one
search for.
Madam chair representative
Martinez that time not aware I I
don't think any has been spent
thank you.
And this is money that.
House Bill to.
Madam chair representative
Martinez this was these funds
were created in the ETA and the
money was received directly from
economic and now needs to be
appropriated before we can send
it through.
This that
bill thank you madam chair
representative
Example of one on unintended
cons.
Russian some questions the
energy transition on.
Really thinking.
This consequences
Was.
Given what we anticipate this
was gonna happen.
Why was that not.
Fiction the original to the.
Madam chair representative
routine is that wasn't set up
with the state I was a part of
half of the case I'm not sure
that I can answer that I do know
though that and some of the PNM
proceedings were were tied up in
court in the delays in the
delivery
and that is because of PTA
contain additional language
about the money being subject to
appropriation even after was
received by the fund that's how
we got pushed from from July and
now because we need that
additional.
Madam chair representative.
Sure there's one point the.
Our goal million dollars the
fund which positional money is
appropriated to.
Madam chair representative
Martinez so I'm federally
request me by the Indian Affairs
fund that that contains the one
point.
are funds that displaced workers
systems funded workforce
solutions contains twelve
million ninety three thousand
five hundred and there's also a
funded the economic development
department which maintains five
million nine hundred fifty six
thousand five hundred dollars I
get all that money is already
with the state it's not
additional funds and so it would
just be the at forty two spend
that money will be in HB two
there may be additional funds
through and your bill or other
sources.
Madam chair representative.
Let's go to page seven.
One four.
line ten on page eight of the
strikes.
The time.
Madam chair representative from
your your I understand.
Why what are there any time
limits now.
I mean how long will this
program cool on this is still
the one districts but that.
I want you know we could be
putting out flames for ten
years.
Madam chair representative
Martinez so we we we really
wanted to do is at limits or
take away that book Act Yuri in
terms of looking for the act
itself and I think that the fun
kind of exists forever and can
be appropriated with that for
receive additional funds for
other closures that may happen
as a result of the energy
transition act with regard to
this we are working very hard to
just get that complete list of
folks who were displaced so that
we can do individualized contact
in
you can clear up to about an
employee benefits we know how to
reach them and our plan is to
disperse the funds within three
to five months of receiving it
is meant.
Madam chair representative
short.
Do you have a majority of.
Already identified.
On this.
Madam chair representative
Martinez we received the
complete list for PNM and we
have a list of people who have
applied for unemployment
benefits were just waiting for
the complete list from the west
really mining company and that
we will have a complete list.
Madam chair representative
The unions provided any
assistance to the workers your.
Madam chair representative at
the union was at present for all
of our rapid response efforts so
that's when we go to the field
we go to their place of
employment at the end of shift
we sit down with folks we
explained to them how to get
unemployment benefits and and
all that kind of good stuff in
them the new was helpful there
and also I believe that tends to
be helpful in locating workers
to Leicester.
One last question madam chair.
On page eight lines this the.
Madam chair representative.
What.
Winds fifteen sixteen.
What.
What other eligibility criteria.
Do you want to see.
Madam chair representative of
Martinez at this time we don't
anticipate any other eligibility
criteria but we felt that forty
was important because there are
other sources of funds for
displaced workers with this
particular fund is eligible to
receive so for example federal
dollars and if those are tied to
specific eligibility
requirements we didn't have to
come back to this body to get
that legislation amended we just
wanted the ability to set
guidelines for those other
sources.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative.
Thank you madam chair
Unlike Representative Lundstrom
I would devoted to this
adventure the.
Is.
A good thing I
am also I also agree that the
workers need to that money needs
to go to them so I would like to
hear from PNM
we've heard a few things what
they have been doing what they
are going to do and I'd like to
hear your response to that and
you can raise your hand so maybe
you can should lead on this.
yes chair representative Duncan
I just want to.
Clarify what I stated before so
the services some of the other
funding.
Not so much the.
bonds.
The we did have some as far as
helping out the community not
only for the Canadian running
but displace workers.
A lot of that money came from
archer over that's how that was
paid on them.
The state funds come through as
well displace oil reserves and
within PNM exposes those workers
I worked at the plant San Juan
plant that we're PNM boys they
were eligible for the secretary
to that that is being a pain in
the water so I just wanted to
clarify some of the funding
that.
That is far is giving back to
try to get back to the community
much as we could to the economic
development organizations and
displaced workers that's where
that funding is.
From the securitization bonds
with the server Senator.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Allison you know
I've.
We had conversations on this one
so.
and you may.
Madam chair maybe PNM can answer
another question as well so
Westmoreland received money from
PNM and they've given some of
that our workers and working
with those funds right now
Representative.
I'm not sure.
Senator I'm not sure where where
that money went in with the
address to the local union
office.
Madam chair representative okay
my understanding is.
Out of nine million dollars
Westmoreland lines to those
displaced workers and that was
cents prepaid back twenty twenty
two.
I could I could see what I could
go back and dig into.
Thank you madam chair so I'll
touch on that for you very
little of that is been given.
I don't know where those funds
are at but to Representative on
Lundstrom is concern is my
concern was miners the the
employees have not gotten a
response in there somewhere and
I don't exactly know where
they're at
but that's my concern we have a
lot of money here but we're not
given it to anybody and and and
I don't know where the other
part of money went to.
In this.
Madam chair representative Dick
in my understanding is that at
the Westmoreland severance
patients funds are tied up in
litigation and authorized labor
practice complaint filed by the
labor organizations representing
some of the underground.
I don't know the details of it
but understanding is that once
that complete is resolved that
the money will be distributed on
the.
Madam chair.
Representative do you know how
long that's going to be tied up
in court and.
So that could be tied up in
court and madam chair I could be
tied up in court for five years
five years these workers are not
gonna get anything and so they
are going to have to move out of
the country right of state to
get jobs.
and they will not be
Representative Lundstrom said it
will not be keeping what they
know on their knowledge and
their skills in San Juan County.
That's my fears and they will be
working someone.
And that the matter is owners
eighty one of the states
surrounding us the very top of
the screen so.
Thank you madam chair that's
your thing and.
Thank.
I have a couple questions I.
I guess for some for more
funding options
it sounds like.
Eight million dollars.
And is there twelve million in
the fund.
Yes and I'm sure there's a lot
of numbers being turned her
tears that my understanding is
that there was a pot of money
fifteen and use directly to pay
severance to its workers there
was another pot of money which
Westmoreland has reserves to pay
severance to its workers but
that is tied up in litigation
and and we don't know when that
will be great at as far as the
energy transition Act money it
was twenty million dollars in
total divided among the three
departments so department of
workforce solutions received at
twelve million ninety three
thousand five hundred for the
displaced workers find that
twenty million economic
development receive five million
nine hundred fifty six thousand
five hundred and at the affairs
department received one point
eight million dollars and that
is where the three three pots of
the twenty million exists now.
So it.
The the many that are in the
house you just came.
Well it was working our patients
table and.
To develop a plan to start
training.
Any of those affected that has
that has that happened.
Sure we did develop a plan and
we have started implementing it
get involved that number and
again on Boston this out to you
in the committee following this
meeting but it includes a number
of different elements job search
assistance I'm a standardized
process for insurance at the
bridge programs we talked about
with with San Juan college and
the other two technical colleges
there and then the direct
assistance program which is the
the for the twelve million we'll
go from here and our folks have
been on the ground really since
July of last year.
Trying to work with individual
workers for exactly the reasons
that this committee
representative Representative
Lundstrom have talked about we
understand the importance of
keeping them in.
there isn't that there's a lot
of folks need to be struggling
with just
the the three fences that
require all of this such a major
event happening I think a lot of
folks in the region to believe
it was going to happen until the
day it happened and so we just
continue to do that research and
try to make sure they know that
when they're ready these
resources are available.
Thank you and I appreciate that
but I guess what I'm concerned
about is when he's not getting
to the actual
yours more of training isn't
happening then what what is
being done how long does that
mean he's been there how long is
it available to them
I'm sure that years later I
share the frustration but it is
my understanding India based
interpretation I think everyone
agrees on the interpretation
that the money had to be at sort
of appropriated again once it
was in the state's coffers to
our department before we can
spend it as soon as that money
is available we intend to get it
out to the workers.
And that is the number of that
is workers.
No.
Madam chair and it will affect
the amount that workers can
receive you know because of the
total pot divided by whatever
that number is but it's it will
increase the amount of funding
available.
And so.
It sounds like not very many.
And
madam chair we have it.
madam chair we we are aware of
about three hundred and forty
workers between the list that
we've gotten from PNM and that
we have from our
Unemployment insurance but again
until we if expanded this window
and formally started to reach
out to the folks who might have
been laid off before twenty
twenty two we're not going to
know what that exact number is
in the estimates prior to the
closure ranged widely we've seen
four hundred there was a study
that said six hundred and so we
really just need to to have that
if this passes we need to put
out that call into the outreach
efforts to find folks who are
just like.
So it.
Yeah absolutely it.
It is a fact.
Madam chair that we know of
about three hundred and forty
but again the estimate that
would catch the folks who were
like that lay out this far back
is twenty twenty have seen as
high as six hundred I've ever
seen in a list that goes that
high but those were the numbers
that were used in some of the
initial projections and so if
there was a state that number is
six settings or just take by
every is with there be enough
funding to be able to.
You know we educate three to do
that process.
Current madam chair there would
be enough to is our plan is to
make an initial directing that
there would be enough to make
that that directing it and then
we plan to continue to pursue
federal funds to use our
existing workforce innovation
opportunity act dollars to
provide for training and I can't
say for certain that it will be
enough but we certainly are.
Thank you and so those people
that have hi Services are I it
is spending have a that process
through and have been used in
those minutes Madam chair nobody
has applied for this money
because again we don't have
offer for forty disadvantage but
folks have been applied for
unemployment benefits some
people have attended the bridge
program some people have applied
for workforce training dollars
to get training and education
and so those people were helping
as the committee.
Thank you.
Hi.
is there anything.
But we do have a sense.
That I may just have one more
question the committee that we
have right now is asking.
Like to know whether this
Department economic development
Indian Affairs actually house
for largest new forty twenty one
budget adjustment request they
knew this money was coming at.
I don't think you have to wait I
want to ask would have on the
asked for more forty on the
energy transition and not tell
you whether or not there's right
after leisure started.
Information.
Right now all the.
And
given that maybe we can still go
with our interactive yes okay.
so we do have a motion we have a
second second.
Representative and in order yes.
Representative Duncan yes
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lente yes.
Representative little yes.
Representative Lundstrom.
Representative Martinez.
Yes.
Representative Mason.
Yes.
Representative Matthews.
Madam chair yes madam chair yes
two thousand eight nine which
yes is your.
Thank you and if you follow up
that with that Representative
Lundstrom I think you have some
comments re offline.
Thank you madam chairman thank
you members of the committee.
Your.
All right.
The.
You're not last but.
Okay.
Thank you.
It over the.
What's question.
I did explain to me that
As a substitute that restricted
out late and so we are in the
process of getting this is
distributed that your witnesses
here just for today so we want
to make sure to accommodate us
so we can get as much
information as possible and then
we will go on Wednesday thank
you madam chair thank you
committee appreciate that I have
Mister presentation thank you
I'm just happy to process in the
last thank you madam chair
members of the committee of
sponsoring H. B. four ninety two
to update the cactus regulation
act as we're transitioning to
this new industry specifically
this bill codified in law a seed
to sale tracking system already
required by reduce regulation
and adds a transparency
dashboard.
Tracking cannabis from seed to
sale it is the foundation of
regulation and a standard in the
industry across the country HB
for ninety three requires a
state utilizing chase ability
system increase minimum
standards for the functionality
of that system that includes
tracking the plant throughout
its life cycle and creating a
process for product recall and
recall notification notification
to the public.
HB four ninety two requires
transparency and insurers
insurers that data is consistent
and publicly available.
This is this bill allows
information used by local law
enforcement to help identify
unregulated activity local
governments to understand and
address community concerns
consumers to locate license
businesses and licensees to make
decisions based on market data.
Transparency is a win win for.
All of our New Mexicans health
and safety.
And that's why I'm bringing this
this bill forward into day like
to introduce Christine Thompson
she's been former cannabis
Division director and metric
Representative here to day to
answer questions with me and we
do stand for questions now
unless my expert would like to
say anything.
Madam chair thank you for your
consideration first I appreciate
it my name is Kristen Thompson I
am the former
cannabis control division
director here in New Mexico
and does have a lengthy amount
of time working in cannabis
policy one of the things that
really surprised me when I went
into my role here was that
during and and it's you know I
was the first it was a it was a
difficult transitioned from
medical to recreational but this
I think was a foundational piece
that was missing this
traceability system that every
other state relies on to make
sure the products duties that is
it comes from New Mexico New
Mexico growers and is sold
through at New Mexico on
businesses for businesses
located here in the state
so
hi I felt it strong wind
strongly when Representative
Lujan brought this idea to me
and was able to help answer some
questions regarding the role of
traceability
and the original bill versus
what you have today the
substitute legislation.
That hi that should have.
Really.
What people need to make sure
that traceability works and that
human error is sort of out of
the nation so that is all I have
to say at the moment I'm open
for any questions thank you.
Thank you do we have anybody
here in favor of that.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee and
Mary Kay Ruth registered
lobbyists for metric multistate
provider of cannabis regulatory
technology systems and we stand
a very strong support of House
bill four ninety three we've
seen positive results that
robust database that tracks
cannabis from the beginning of
the supply chain to the very end
can have in other states.
Strong C. additional tracking
system that offers transparency
through publicly accessible
dashboard also helps inform
consumer choice issues of the
drugs they purchase has been
grown process and dispense why
do we licensed in Mexico
companies since there is a
mechanism to advise the public
of product recalls any issues
can be traced back to the plant
group response.
Really a big deal as far as
public health goes the dashboard
also provides valuable
information to law enforcement
grow a healthy successful and
legal market to the state of New
Mexico.
Anybody on.
members of the committee.
Representative mais.
The.
All
of that.
I'm chair of representatives.
The.
As this year why.
Right.
What.
Thank you thank you madam chair
thank you Representative that
we're not allowed to we're not
presented to substitute we we
work with Wendy and the division
to address that issue and I I
believe it's been addressed and
now supported necessitate.
It would be yes.
So we're not we're not on the
substitutes you madam chair
Representative.
At.
I'm sure Representative that
would be a dollar amount there
was an issue regarding the to
the staff the equipment staff
that this would take.
Due to the language the
states that there would be more
reporting.
Necessary with
On site visits and we took that
portion.
Yeah.
This Madam long.
The.
All the.
What what is a black mark.
That.
Madam chair representative.
When I stated that what it
doesn't do now is give all that
information to local local law
enforcement to have identified
related I'm regulated activities
so this would have a modify the
reporting to include that.
What.
Your.
We have and
I.
There will be.
Madam chair I love my experts
through question.
Madam chair representative Mason
there is definitely a I needed
for at at divisional lapse in in
the state
It was something that the there
is something that the division
has been focused on recruiting
those labs
They can the the labs now yes
can handle the amount of legal
we are sorry for legal cannabis.
Groaning.
Of the divisions were director.
The the R. can handle it it is
taking long periods of time.
and the hope is that more more
labs will become a licensed
within the state to handle the
increase in that the
recreational cannabis grown here
it's it's onerous and it does
take quite a bit of start up
capital but we have heard even
publicly in in the newspapers
that there are labs that are
here that are looking to expand
into the area so
publicly for that for more labs
absolutely it will help speed up
the process for those growers.
That was.
One of.
Growers.
All.
Over the.
Madam chair representative
that's correct.
At the end of this plan around
water.
For.
I have.
The.
We they all.
So.
A lot of the the on the as.
Thank you Representative.
Thank you madam chair.
sure I just like to ask a
question and it may take a
little while for the expert to
answer this question.
Can you tell me how big a
candidacy is.
Yes.
The Madam chair representative
Duncan they are quite small
Most cannabis actually is not
cultivated from seed any more
because of the the legalize
system throughout the United
States and and even here
starting with medical generally
you take a cutting.
as you would with the call you
know with that with other plants
if you are you're not generally
growing from seed you're
actually growing from a cutting.
Get it to to grow some roots and
then you plant that
but yes the seeds are very small
and tissue is very small tissue
is sometimes used to cultivate a
plan
but you can track it from that
moment that it is.
Arrives and.
Thank you madam chair I will
forever we raise alfalfa grass.
Hi.
Not that.
And I
Talk about requests were talking
about something totally
different.
Yeah.
So so.
Just take the seeds and the
skin.
Representative Lente and I would
say we're gonna artificially
inseminate target hours so we're
gonna take all of those things
and then we're going to track
them.
If you've got at.
I have this big for example
states to throw that.
Madam chair representative don't
get a lot
I couldn't to add very that'd
the jelly be Gaynor came as well
so I have a lot but what it
means the way this the system
works is when you place that
into a growing medium that
growing medium gets tacked.
and that tags follows the plant
through that growing medium to
it's that is transferred to a
plant throughout its entire
cycle even after harvest it
stays with the with the the
flower that is hold off it goes
with the with all of that
at the waist that gets tracked
under that plan that number Wade
and tracked and it goes all the
way to even if you're making it
into an edible it will state
that number will stay throughout
the system.
Okay thank you madam chair
that's what I was wondering so
when that's packed with that
product is packaged that number
is on there so if it's a bad
batch then you can go back to
the.
that mad cow disease came from
town yes ma'am okay yes.
Thank you thank Representative
that's that's I just knew
nothing about is one of the how.
Thank you.
Thank you Representative
Martinez.
share.
On
Two one six.
This is.
Sure the.
Madam chair representative and I
would just address that this is
a problem this is it an issue we
worked with RLD on but your
question I'm gonna give to my
experts.
Madam chair representative
Martinez
I believe that they're actually
almost six hundred retail in the
state but yes this is a section
that we did remove again
understanding that if you have
that foundation of very of the
of the good
traceability system track and
trace system that meets the
needs of at of a recreational
market that that staff time is
really not going to be necessary
that you can rely on the current
process which is through
complaint or or trace all
traceability systems send a red
flag when it looks like
something is wrong in the
calculations it does that for
you so then you know to send
someone so that is why this bill
I'm really focusing on that
traceability is important so
that you don't need the human
power you just need to know that
there is an issue have a body to
go out make double check that
that is in fact an issue and
then having force then.
Senator plans.
Age.
All.
Which we also.
He's been.
That thank you madam chair thank
you Representative for that the
crackling should be listed
market on both of them have to
replace black or gray we we and
again focused right in the two
questions where we are
addressing the substitute to
remove thank you.
Madam chair will.
Is.
This is.
Madam chair representative when
use of right we are working with
in the CCC acting director there
is not I don't believe.
And with its replaced.
Four but yes we have been in
direct contact and we took their
notes to to create the
substitute Madam chair
representative.
And one last question on that
page one one.
Uses of.
On
was optional.
Thank you madam chair
representative we do currently
use about Traxxas diem but it
needs what this does is it
codifies into all that we
continue to use a tracking
system and what it what we call
into place within it
modifications that we would like
to see in the they're tracking
system that set you so that we
have more information like I
said to all forced Forsman for
instance but if you at my ex
related to add to that the
state.
Madam chair representative
Martinez yes and part of this
thing that that transition from
medical to recreational when I
came on was that that had not
been clear those minimum
standards for what a
traceability system should have
this is very different from a
medical system
hi.
It simply wasn't there so yes
bio track of it and metric two I
am here.
With as well as just sold so the
change of name.
There is one other these systems
all will be.
At the ability come the next
contracted which we did clarify
it will be based on on you know
all other factors but minimum
standards are are normal and in
cannabis regulation we didn't go
above beyond this is just the
baseline and they all are able
to meet them.
Madam chair religion.
Show.
Your position.
Hello that's a software.
M. chair representative yes.
Just one last question.
On the last page.
Our.
Matt madam chair Representative
Representative we also modified
that state to be
Twenty twenty four.
Thank you madam chair.
Madam chair representative when
the state section more was what
I.
This of two.
Madam chair representative thank
you fix for catching that that
space be July July one twenty
twenty four.
You
madam chair what was it what was
it.
Substitute the substitute madam
chair should and I'm looking at
the substitute which we're will
come back to and and make sure
that that is.
It's.
Madam chair my answer would like
to add to it.
madam chair members of the
committee
there are two areas where there
are changes in the substitute
for that for the dates the first
one will actually be on page one
and that is around the
traceability system that
contract actually expired a year
ago and that this state needs to
issue an RFP so we don't want to
push out that or if PED is it
it's likely ready
and so that or if PED it should
be issued to this year when it
when the contract is so we made
that clarification the rest of
the concern about whether or not
something was going to be ready
does we took those to the
sections we took out of the
legislation so the hiring of
staff
as well as the
the hiring of staff the the the
requirement that you do to per
year and then the enforcement in
on page three lines eleven
through fifteen the
representative Martinez pointed
out that would have taken that
is data that does not currently
exist to be collected that would
have taken a long time that was
simply removed.
Members.
On June thirtieth what is.
Madam chair representative wants
to thank you it should say that
that is when the contract is is
currently.
But up to it was actually a year
ago was a twenty twenty two but
it was the middle of of of
implementation so it got
extended for a year.
This just creates those minimum
standards so it should just be
wet and this is is
The R. F. P. is ready to be
released.
Madam chair.
K..
In the area.
That would be confusing.
The.
What was it that.
One was a contract and.
Madam chair of the
Representative Lundstrom that is
actually that it was issued I
believe ten years ago it was
under the medical program.
Right using the dollar members
meeting.
Contacts inside the statue.
Madam chair we were working on
strategies that will.
I mean.
All the time and and.
Right on.
That.
The at activities.
I'm here.
While one twenty.
So Madam right question is are
we gonna do substitutes.
And so.
Matt madam chair Representative
I'm happy to to work with the
other changes and if it is the.
To the committee and the chair
would rather of there being you
substitutes are amended that is.
Something I would ask.
Well let's finish taking
questions that just a month and
when I'm reading the the
Associated.
It's not very clear and I think
that there's things on that act
estimated by jobs
So it is keep asking the
questions thank you madam chair
screeching that.
The representative madam chair
representative Representative
I'm happy to work on this the
changes with use for.
Madam chair I don't.
Thank you.
I will send you I really madam
chair at the question I have
those regarding language on the
regional substitute.
I'm
assuming that.
Looking at the FY act.
And so.
The chief chains around those
numbers are obligated.
Correct.
Madam chair yes that is correct
I think in discussions with both
the sponsor
and other.
At stakeholders
it became clear that those
sections were not necessary.
And and looking at the house
committee announces
are at the last concert it was
like a lot of those are taking
navigate somebody still need to
be
making sure that there was an
compliance portion of it and I
would think that that would have
a cost and so however how would
you implement this bill without
any type of funding right madam
chair
I believe that the the funding
is already at early for the work
is already being done to the R.
F. P. and they are do you to
have a new R. F. P. as many as
we as we're having this
discussion with that is exactly
I can answer but I can find out
and check.
Our family is supported as well
Madam chair representative
they are working with us on this
bill they're they're not either
for or against it but this is
something that would help them
manage
the cannabis industry a lot
better and.
Create more transparency and
awareness Madam.
Hi.
I think it's there is but so I
think the definitely need some
clarification.
So I I would encourage you to
Of those additional is so that
will attract I have here thank
you mentioned that we can give
you that you might need the
extra date Friday.
I will get right to work on it
and as soon as I leave madam
chair and try to get this as
soon as I get the stickers as
possible thank you.
Well this bill.
This is the act thank you madam
chair the two would you like to.
Present to the morals.
Thirty four this.
Thank you madam chair thank you
committee members House memorial
thirty four resolve the New
Mexico house of representatives
support strengthening
relationships between New Mexico
the United States and Taiwan in
trade the exchange of visits by
officials in support of its
organizations with that madam
chair I is there any questions
thank you this is anybody here
in support of the bill.
Anybody here opposed to the
death.
The committee.
Yes question.
I have see these.
Asked.
Madam chair representative I
seen this memorial since I've
been a part is legislature's in
twenty seventeen and and
thereafter and I was actually
part of a delegation twenty
nineteen that that travel to
Taiwan with the Representative
Roybal Caballero and
Representative Sarinana to to
learn more about the exports in
the trade between Taiwan and in
New Mexico and so I've seen this
part of the the making of this
legislature since then and so I
just before that and since then
so this is not anything new.
To have numbers for.
and represented by you have been
to Taiwan I've also done this
tomorrow before I think and it
always gets stuck it has a past
but.
Any other questions from the
committee.
Representative Mason.
Your.
A
five year all.
Madam chair representative it
short of that actually are.
As I recall that the process was
that the speaker would nominate
members of of the body to be
part of a delegation usually two
or three individuals that the
that Taiwan actually Sanchez to
make this this visit happen and
so it's actually a about a weeks
long visit and we we we we visit
the country and look at their
trade and talk about how we
construct the trade between the
New Mexico and Taiwan and the
United States but it's it's
really it's I find it very
fascinating we talk about
agriculture the exports of New
Mexico has to die one we talk
about the need act four bridges
the gap Phelps with other other
things like that that go from
the state to Taiwan was was
really interesting and then we
talked about partnerships they
have with institutes like like
and we have parking in the Los
crucis and and and I miss you so
there's a lot of components that
are actually shared between
Taiwan New Mexico that I was
aware of until action made the
visit so it was definitely an
eye opening experience and so
it's the the country Taiwan that
makes that happen.
As well.
Yeah
Thank you for.
Thank you hi anybody is.
