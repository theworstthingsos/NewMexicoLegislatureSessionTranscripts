you probably remember from last
year.
Uh, this bill establishes a
pilot program to provide a
one-time tax credit of up to
$750 for New Mexicans who
purchase a secure.
And storage device such as a gun
safe lockbox or other secure
storage designed to be accessed
only by key.

owners to take proactive steps
in securing their firearms,
helping to reduce accidents

An unauthorized access.
Gun safety is not a partisan
issue. It's a matter of public
safety and personal
responsibility.
Law enforcement, firearm
instructors and safety advocates
all agree that secure storage is
one of the most effective ways.
prevent unintended injuries,
suicide, and stolen firearms
ending up in the wrong hands.
HP 202 is designed to be
straightforward and accessible.
It allows for up to $1 million
per year in tax credits issued
on a first come, first served
basis, ensuring we incentivize
as many safe storage purchases
as possible while maintaining
fiscal responsibility.
Department of Public Safety will
certify eligible purchases.
ensuring compliance with safety
standards, and additionally, any
credit exceeding a taxpayer's
liability is fully refundable,
making it available to all New
Mexicans regardless of income
level.
Since this is a pilot program,
it will be in place for a
limited time through taxable
years prior to January 1st,
2028.
Allowing us to evaluate its
effectiveness before considering
long term implementation.
This approach ensures we take a
measured data-driven path
forward, improving firearm
safety in New Mexico.
by making gun safety more
affordable, this still helps to
strike a balance between 2nd
Amendment rights and responsible
ownership.
It empowers firearm owners to
take an extra step in securing
their firearms, protecting their
families, communities, and law
enforcement officers.
I appreciate your time and
consideration, and with that I
stand for questions.
OK
Um, Patrick, do you have anybody
on Zoom?
I don't see anybody in the
audience.
Representative Matthews.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and uh
thank you.
Representative presenting the
bill.
I like comment on this is taken
from the solar panel.
Program
Um
It was very similar to this,
that if you bought solar panels,
the state is gonna provide some
money to you.
And I heard from a number of
constituents and let me back up,
and that there was a limit to
how much the state it was going
to provide.
and there was a budget.
Right, you couldn't go over the
budget.
I heard from a number of
constituents who
Is that the solar panels put on.
They were told by the
salespeople that they were
gonna, this was gonna be paid or
a certain amount of it was going
to be paid by.
State in Mexico.
And these are expensive
transactions, more than
Um
More than probably a gun.
Then
Which is a gun locker,
yeah, and.
$50 which might actually be too
much in researching, I mean, a
decent one, and, and there may
be an amendment at some point
when we come to tax
but
like the 300 to $400 rather than
thousands, so.
Got it. Um, and a chair.
Representative, my concern is
that
That whenever the paperwork is
about an advertising this, and
it's clearly disclosed that
there that the state.
This is not everybody at this
state.
It's only gonna provide this
much to the, to the first.
You know, and once that's used,
If you buy after that.
In the same year, you're not
going to receive any money, just
honest to people what this is
because people entered into
$20,000 contract.
Solar panels, and then found out
that
There is either no money or
maybe $500 left that they could
get, and that's it, huge.
Uh
to take that you're not
expecting.
I just think it's, if we do
these kinds of deals, even
though this is a good deal less
expensive, we should be honest
with people about
There's no guarantee it's, it's
the state fund is going to be
enough to cover
that, that's it's my, um, I also
get the calls from
From constituents that are in
the same boat of, you know, or
You know, we're in a waiting
list and it'll be 3 years before
I get my money back or whatever
that happens to be. So I think
this is a great idea, um, of
making sure that when
You know, your
FFA dealers and
Yeah, if it, sorry, FFL dealers
and everybody, um, promotes this
plan that there is a
You know, no guarantee, there's
only
A limited amount of money.
Um
You know, I didn't ate my
thought behind this was, we need
to put enough money that
At $400 it's about 3300 people
who can apply for it a year. Um,
You know, but it's, it's a pilot
program. Who knows if even that
many people are going to apply
for it.
Um, I just think that this is a
Bipartisan non.

It's something that all of us
can get behind of, you know, gun

That's all I have here.
Thank you,
Madam Chair. Representative.
Um, yes, we did.

different than

of this is, yes, they can, they
can.

into it.
Um
I think the last time that I ran
this, you and I had a
conversation about display cases
versus.
Um, you know
Actual firearm safety storage.
Um, which is kind of where my
brain went first, but you're
right, the, there is no way for
us to be able to determine that
they will be putting a firearm.
That, you know, it has to be a

But, um, any,
uh, appreciate it.
I come to you and get a few of
those ideas and I would love to,
if it gets through here, pass,
uh, grab amendments.
Are there any remaining
questions from the committee?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative, um.
This is kind of a funny one to
me, uh, because like our
colleague Mason made a point of
it being

um, because it's already the

Representative Mason brought up
a good point that, you know,
this is also a state law.
Um, that they, that they are
required to have a mine is more
of a safety aspect, um.
we can get

it.
I'm not gonna go to your house

not. So, um, I could see how
that would by folks that just
were gonna buy it because it's
their own house, uh, to actually
do it. So thank you very much.
