Um, and we'll get started.
Representative Armstrong.
Representative De la Cruz,
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lee.
Representative Mason.
Representative Matthews.
Representative Murphy here,
Representative Parajon.
Here.
Representative Cerrado.
Representative, uh, vice chair
and you know.
Madam Chair
Still here.
Thank you. All righty, um.
If we, uh,
Who is gonna start the
presentation uh representative
Sanchez.
Yes, madam. OK, go, go ahead and
begin.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
So House Bill 323 revises
exemptions under the Engineering
and serving Practice Act to
clarify when business employed
engineers must be licensed.
The bill modifies the condition
by a business entity is exempt
from licensure requirements by
expanding the definition where
unlicensed engineers may perform
work.
And Madam chair, uh, the reason
we're we're bringing this bill
is um.
My uh colleague or our our
fellow uh rep and my friend
next, next to me has to build a
couple.
Unintended consequences is that
it, uh, brought about a change
for the last 80 years or so.
Um, utilities have been exempt.
They've been able to uh work on
their own without having to have
PEs or licensed surveyors.
And um
Just recently adopted some
rules.
That are are now starting to
require them.
We're gonna try to uh fix this
and put it back to where it was
before with my uh colleague
would like to say a few words on
that.
Thank you, rep and uh Madam
Chair and committee in 2023 we
were in myself and did a lot of
great things for the state and
the way that we can get licenser
in the state.
One of the things that uh I
didn't realize.
Require our utilities.
Any impacts do it, this impacts
from natural gas.
Within existing within existing
easements.
To have to read PE still steal
something.
That already has a national
standard to it national. I
learned that the basis of the
rulemaking which occurred before
I ran this bill.
That I didn't know about.
It was a letter from the
National Transportation and
Safety Board.
That was specifically directed.
Natural gas utilities.
But yet one letter from NTS
pretty sure that if if I was on
that board, the PE board at the
time on it.
At the end of the day here with
my hat in my hands saying what
I'm sorry. Do you mind if I
introduce my guest, I just was
gonna say that representative
Pettigrew is causing havoc and
now we're uh we're gonna,
we're gonna fix it again, OK.
I appreciate that, yes, please
introduce your guest.
I like to introduce.
Romero, he's the the CEO of and
uh I think we stand for
questions now.
Thank you. Appreciate you being
here. Uh, if we could, uh, if
anybody in the room is in favor
of the bill, if you would raise
your hand.
Um, and if you'd like to speak,
uh, the attendant will hold the
mic and you will have a minute.
Good afternoon. My name is Vince
Martinez. I'm the interim CEO of
the Mexico Rural Electric
Cooperative Association. Our
association has 15 distribution
cooperatives and two generation
and transmission cooperatives,
we cover the state 80 close to
80% of the state from
Um, and we stand in full support
of these changes today, as you
know, cooperatives are not for
profit. A lot of cooperatives
don't have engineers on staff.
We have to contract them. Um, so
this added cost, at a time, um.
For projects as we roll out
broadband and other things in
rural New Mexico, uh.
So for those reasons, we stand
in support of.
Madam Chair and representatives
of the committee, uh, with
respect, my name is Scott Lopez.
I'm the founder of Vita Mihor
Capital and a registered
lobbyist. We are a 501c3
nonprofit located at the Okeing
Pueblo, very active in several
infrastructure sectors in New
Mexico, including energy and
broadband. In fact, I host New
Mexico's largest broadband
conference and energy policy
symposium. I have a professional
background in utility
construction and was the vice
president of business
development and government
affairs for Kelly Cable, a
statewide, uh, New Mexico.
firm, I can personally attest
that the electric cooperatives,
telephone cooperatives, and
utilities would immediately
welcome any administrative and
financial relief caused by
burdensome regulations that did
not exist two years ago.
Regulation regulations that are
layered onto onerous, permitting
workforce and supply chain
issues, um,
Let's make it easier for them to
do business, please.
Respectfully, I ask for your
consideration to pass House Bill
323. Thank you.
Madam Chair,
Good to see you again.
Uh, and, and uh thank you for
letting us come before your
committee. My name is George
Dodge Junior.
I am a registered lobbyist for
the Metro rural co-ops.
And I'm also on the board of
trustees, vice president of the
board of trustees, uh, for, uh,
Farms Electric co op on the east
side of the state.
And I
I stand in full support of this
measure, because it helps small
co-ops like ours out on the side
of the state, we have a hard
time with uh.
With and I'm sure other portions
of the state have a hard time
with engineers.
So we can work with this, we'll
be good, OK? So thank you, Madam
Chair, I stand in full support
our co op stand in full support
on the side of the state also.
Thank you. Thank you and welcome
back to the house.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Robert Castillo, and
I've been for about 15 years
with continental Divide,
electric, and telecommunications
cooperative.
We offer broadband and teering
for many, many years. It's very
difficult to serve rural areas,
so we're trying to keep the
services as affordable as
possible, so we stand in full
and hope in your wisdom you
direct direction to go for the
rural parts of New Mexico. Thank
you.
Thank you.
OK. Anybody on Zoom and support?
No. All righty. Anybody in
opposition?
You like to come up to the
front.
You'll have a minute of the
committee.
My name is Perry Valdez and I'm
the executive director with the
New Mexico Board of Engineers
and Surveyors.
And we are in a opposed to the
bill because we feel that uh
In protection of the public
should be having a licensed
engineer, work on, work on
projects and easements and
right of interests, uh, because
of this and also uh from with us
from the state of New Mexico.
That's why this board.
Uh, issued this uh change to the
they have requested that such as
this.
Is an important aspect of any
that we also had rule change.
Uh, anybody online on Zoom?
In opposition.
No. Alrighty, let's go to the
committee. Any questions from
the committee?
I move or do pass.
All righty. Um,
That
We have emotion and a second. I
just want to make sure that
anybody has any questions, OK,
representative Serato.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, representatives for
bringing forward this bill. Um,
I'm curious just looking at the
materials from the board. Um, it
seems that on a national scale,
this it's preferred to have
licensed engineers, it seems
like that would make sense. Um,
are there consequences from
removing those requirements for
New Mexico, will we be penalized
in some way?
Madame Cherna and uh.
Nationally, it's not normal to
require to have a standard
details, drawings, designs that
we use on a daily basis.
Uh, they come from RUS, which
sets the standards for for
co-ops to build to so basically
those standards have been uh
vetted over the last 80 years
and uh like we mentioned uh
prior to 2 years ago, um.
There were no issues or concerns
with this, uh.
And because one explosion,
natural gas in New England.
now they're trying to force us
to do this, it's like a trickle
down effect where it's gonna
increase prices on the, the poor
people we we already serve that
that cost is just gonna go on to
them if we have to hire a
surveyor.
A PE and uh I know this creates
more work for uh the
professional engineers and the
the surveyors, but uh.
Ultimately our goal is we're
already using standards, uh,
that we built to and uh.
We're, we have a track record of
not having issues I'll let uh
Madam Madam Chair, the, the
complete issue of this and this
is.
Represented the
question because at the end of
the day.
The rule making that occurred.
I, I had no knowledge of.
This rule impacts existing work
that so PE work's already been
done. We have the national
standards to be able to do that
street out there.
This instruction still has to
follow.
The, the PE and the survey.
This is only inside existing
utillas, never the intent of the
change that was made
one more in a representative,
um, so.
Just so I understand, putting it
all together so that, so you
feel that that any risk that you
are taking on would be mitigated
because you already have
materials ahead of time, and
that it's and that this is.
Affecting what's already been
created. Is that, is that
correct?
Madam Chair, so the risk if it
were something else is.
You're creating something brand
new that's never been done
before, so you have to hire an
engine you've been doing this
for 80 years.
Is already a set of uh.
Standard drawings and designs
that we built to inspect so uh.
That's
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative, um.
So I, I guess what I would add
is as, as a representative
Sanchez mentioned.
The co op specifically, um,
we've been doing business for
over 85 questions that that we
posed before the board.
A professional engineers was,
you know what.
What was the driver for this and
have there been any?
Public accidents or any safety
concerns.
Um, over that 80 year period
related specifically to
engineering uh.
Electric utilities, the rural
utility service specifications,
those are, those are.
Engineered best that's part of
the United States.
The New Mexico Mexico
administrative code requires us
to follow the National Electric
sea and so we are under very
strict um.
Guidelines and um
specifications, all of our
material that we use is has to
be approved by by the RUS.
And so it just seems like an
unnecessary burden, all of which
is going to be borne by our
members.
Um, there's no one else to
absorb that those costs is gonna
add a dramatic amount of.
Time and costs at a time when
we're we're really struggling to
keep up, we've got, you know.
Make ready work for broadband.
new transmission, new
distribution. Thank you,
Representative Matthews.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair, and thank you presenters,
um.
So the change, if I understand
it correctly.
Is to allow unlicensed.
Well, I don't know if I should
call them engineers, unlicensed
engineers, would that be
correct?
To
Uh, do off-premise.
easements.
Mada Chariot be to uh well we
have our uh stakers and
engineers, they basically do
staking sheets, which are many
designs.
That are standard where we use
standard designs and uh these
are all built within our
easements that we.
We control and uh we build in
so.
Everything we build, we own.
Uh, the cops, uh, so.
Those are the people that uh
would be doing these these
designs. I don't know if anybody
Madam Chair, and, and.
Representatives, I will add the
rulemaking, like I said, was
done.
And
The late months of 2020 at New
Mexico Tech.
We brought this up, asked him to
for engineers to be able to
utility companies to add
engineers you were offered the
opportunity from one of the
witnesses to go back into rule
making 2023 and we did not get
that opportunity.
Thank you. And Madam Chair, I.
Not sure that answered my
question. I'm, I'm looking at
the analysis.
And it says currently the
statute specifically identifies
performance of engineering.
Off-premise easements.
Is constituting engineering
services to the public and is
subject to the engineering and
surveying Practice Act.
HB 323 would remove performance
of engineering within.
Off-premises easements.
From being subject to the
engineering and surveying
practice. Are you all
disagreeing with that.
Statement is
Madam Chair and and.
Language that your language that
was put in there.
Based on the existing.
free
To find rulemaking was.
We'd have dealt with this in
2023 if I'd have known.
All of this work occurs inside
of existing easements.
And has existing national
standards to it.
And as testified by my
colleague.
This hadn't started this way
until um man chair, uh,
representative, I, I'm not an
engineer and I don't.
It
Don't
Uh, pretend to be, but I've.
I'm also looking at the FIR.
And national model law for
professional engineers does not
contemplate an exemption such in
Mexico Act, let alone.
What is proposed in several
surrounding states do have
industrial exemptions, but not
all states. Texas, for example,
is very explicit industrial
sectors and conditions that
allow for exemption, but not as
broad as that already provided
my concern is, Madam Chair,
Yes
When we
When we reduce.
Um
Rules on this kind of thing.
Um, the, the people who may end
up.
Uh
Who uh are expecting a certain
level.
I mean, the reason we have these
rules is we want a certain level
of.
Competency in doing this work.
And
From what I'm reading,
In the FIR and also the.
Um, analysis report, this would
actually
Allow the work to be done by
people who had less.
Um, licensure.
I guess would be the correct
word.
And so I'm just trying to
Understand what
Why we would want to reduce the
protection of the public.
In order to happy for
The presenters to share that
with me.
Madam Chair, and I'll I'll let,
uh, Mr. Sprain add to this, but
uh I know what you're reading,
but I guess what I'm saying is,
uh, this wasn't in existence or
enforced two years ago, and we
haven't had issues till then and
I'm not seeing uh.
All I'm saying is that's, that's
not adding value, it's just
adding cost, uh, we have a
license linemen that build these
lines to specs and standards, we
have a.
Engineers and stakers that
design to those standards.
Again, these people aren't
reinventing uh specs that are
standard that have already been
accepted at 80 plus years.
Again, uh, this is causing uh.
Additional uh hazards to the
Romero mentioned.
We've asked to give us an
example of where the engineering
has been an issue and.
There's been none to to
anybody's knowledge, so um.
This didn't exist 2 years, so
we're not lessening standards.
We're trying to fix something
that was caused by a a
rulemaking that occurred in the
last 2 or 3 years, Mr. Spra.
Madame Jarrett and
Representative Matthews, I would
just add, um.
I have been the CEO of the co op
since 1990. I've been working at
the co op since 1986, so I've
been there for a very long time.
Um
I go to bed every night with two
things on my mind, safety of the
public safety of my employees.
Those are the two most concerns
that I have every day on the
job. If I thought there was
something being proposed that
would actually increase the
safety profile I'd be the first
to stand up in support of it.
Uh, what was done two years ago
does not increase the safety
profile at all because it won't
really change anything that
we're doing we're already
building to standards and.
what ends up happening is we, we
build a line and then on the
back end we have professional
engineers come in and they do a
random inspection of all the
work that we do, they'll do a
sampling to make sure we're
building to the standards, and
we passed those inspections, so
there is a professional engineer
on the back end.
Uh, and so they, they are built
to standards and uh I think that
all this uh that was done two
years ago basically just adds
cost, it adds time in areas like
uh the Springer area, the area
that we serve, uh, our
engineering firm is based in
Lubbock, Texas. Uh, they've been
working with us for many years
and so to try and do this with
with them would cause an
increase in costs because they
coming from Lubbock, uh, on a uh
constant basis to look over our
work and and do perform on this
uh on the previous bill
contemplates so that, uh, again,
you know, safety is my number
one concern always every day on
the job and so if there was
something that would.
I would absolutely done to your
two years ago does not do that,
so.
Right I'm sure, just to add, uh,
I myself, I'm, I'm a licensed
professional engineer, so it was
my.
Counterpart here, we're licensed
PEs if I.
We're lessening safety, I'd be
the first one like uh.
To admit to that. I also run a
co op.
Um
If something bad happened, we're
gonna get sued and we're
probably going to go into
bankruptcy, like why would I
risk?
Putting myself in that position
and I'm probably gonna get
fired.
Do something else, right, so,
uh, I just want to echo what Mr.
Spradlin said if, if there was
any sentiment from any of the
managers that this was causing
something to be less safe, we
wouldn't be advocating for it.
and representative I would add
that.
With this rulemaking because of
the conversation of 2023.
The rulemaking and the
requirement for this.
This change has been across the
state.
But add time.
The standard
This is correcting something.
Thank you, Madam Cha uh, if
there's no other questions about
Chairman dela Cruz and the
second by um.
Representative Hernandez,
Patrick Dealerro.
Representative Armstrong. Yes.
Representative De la Cruz, yes,
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lee,
Representative Mason, yes,
Representative Matthews.
pass.
Representative Murphy, yes.
Representative Parejon.
Representative Serrado.
Yes. Madam Vice Chair.
Yes. Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, um.
Representative Matthews.
Pa.
we're at the end.
Oh, we're at the end, so I have
to use the other go either way
at this point.
Yeah.
Um
Well, I, I, I would join the uh
the yes votes, but I just if I
can say I, it's, it's concerning
to me when the documents were
the analysis were given.
Indicate that there's an issue
and I'm, I don't have the
professional ability to judge.
Either side, quite frankly, so,
but um if you all are convinced,
I will.
Oh
So is that a yes?
Oh, it's a yes. OK, thank you.
Madam Chair, yes.
Madam Chair, final tally is 11
votes, yes, 0 votes no for the
due pass. Alright, you've got a
pass.
Yeah
All right, if we can get to
house house Bill 261.
Do we have anybody here for
hospital 61. 261, excuse me.
So we'll take about a couple of
minute recess until uh
representative Doo gets here,
but she's on her way, um, so we
will be on standby for the next
couple of minutes.
I was like,
We do have a great committee.
Well, and with that
representative, we're gonna go
ahead and start if you'll
explain your bill. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee.
I would call this a cleanup
bill, and I want to say it's
simple, but I know that's the
dreaded words that come before
your table, your bill gets
tabled, but this is, um,
allowing the regional spaceport
districts to invest
with the
funds in the, the local
government investment pool.
Right now, they have
restrictions that prohibit them
from earning the, the highest
rate of return, but also it
requires long term and they need
shorter term and flexibility.
So that's the purpose of the
bill, uh, our county
commissioner from Sierra County,
one of the three counties that
are benefited by this is online
to explain it more.
Commissioner Paxson, you can
just start talking.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair and,
uh, and Representative down on
the committee, the Spaceport Act
was passed in 1978, the
Spaceport District Act that
established the tax district was
established in 2005. Currently,
we are gathering a 2/88%.
For pay off of the bond and 25%
of uh all of the proceeds go to
county education in Don Yin and
Sierra County. There's excess
funds from paying off the bond
that uh we would like to invest
in infrastructure spaceport, but
through the state Investment
council, that's nearly an
impossibility. It's very
difficult. This bill revises the
original Spaceport Act to allow
us to invest through the
measure with the local
government investment program,
and then use those funds to
assist spaceport with
development of infrastructure.
Are there any questions?
So, um, before we go there, um,
uh, representative, I see that
we've got an amendment, so do
we, uh, wanna move the amendment
for discussion.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, there
was an error in the original
drafting that we didn't catch,
we instead of adding the um the
state treasurer, we should have
just, we should have.
Removed the State Investment
council. So it strikes on, it
strikes State Investment council
or.
And it, it's transferring this
authority to the state treasurer
and then it adds an emergency
clause so they can start right
now.
All righty. Do we have any
questions on the amendment?
Representative, thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you representative
for the amendment in the bill.
I'm just um help me understand
what, what is the significance
of changing it over to the state
treasurer instead of the SIC.
Short term and like Madam Chair
Representative, short term and
flexibility versus long term.
Any other questions on the
amendment?
We like to act on the Internet.
OK. Any opposition?
We're back on the bill. So, um,
do we have any questions on the
bill?
Do we have any um
From the from the crowded
audience here with this, do we
have any opposition.
All righty, and on Zoom.
All righty, very, it's the
pleasure of the committee.
But, OK, we do have a question.
Representative Matthews.
And I'm sure I.
I'm just curious how.
Um,
Maybe the FIR tells me, but.
Roughly how much money you're
about.
Madam Chair, Representative,
I'll let the commission.
Madam Chair and the committee
rep uh presently it's
approximately $21 million.
Uh
And and so if we move, Madam
Chair, I'm sorry if we move.
If we do what you're asking us
to do with money still be going.
Uh, to the school fund and then
it would only be the excess that
is going.
Um
The state
The local government investment
pool.
Madam Chair and, and
representative, that's correct.
The uh 25% that goes to the
schools is done in an intercept
monthly off the top as well as
the payments to the bond. Uh,
this bill would only deal with
the excess to paying off the
bond that will be paid off in
2029.
Uh, thank you, um.
Commissioner and thank you Madam
Chair's other the questions I
have.
What is the uh?
What does the committee want to
do? More approval.
Patrick to take the role.
Representative Armstrong
Representative de la Cruz, yes.
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lente,
Representative Mason, yes,
Representative Matthews.
Well I'm tempted, Madam Chair,
to say pass, but some will say
yes. It's it's a good bill.
Representative Murphy? Yes,
Representative Pata Juan.
Yes.
Representative Serrado,
Madam Vice Chair.
Madam Chair,
Madam Chair, final tally on the
Du pass as amended motion is 11
votes, yes, 0 votes, no. Well,
love is in the air today. You
have a you pass.
