Present we seem to have one of
our members provide by zoom up
he's allowed to listen in to
resume but we all legislative
members need to be present to
actually participate in that so
Representative Mason I don't
know that you heard that but I
am having as your ranking member
contact you via the
text so that's what we're trying
to get that information out to
him.
Already we can start with house
bill fifty five.
Thank you madam chair
Two handouts will come around to
you see that they are from the
Albuquerque journal and they are
September sixth of twenty twenty
two and January twenty ninth of
twenty twenty three.
So in twenty twenty one I was
contacted by retailers who were
complaining about the right
amount of self shoplifting that
was occurring in their stores.
I brought them to the courts and
corrections Committee.
Where they made a presentation
and I informed the committee I
was writing a bill to go in
energy's in the.
Eight twenty two.
I introduced legislation
are there be half the end of
January twenty twenty two
however it did not receive a
message so it didn't move
forward.
I tried amending it into other
legislation that was just it was
so important.
That was rejected.
This year I introduced house
bill fifty five and we have an
amendment as madam chair when I
was speaking with you you said
you would like to have the best
bill possible move forward.
All right.
Explain the amendment there's
two parts of the amendment.
Are you ready needs to ensure
you are we can make a motion to
have that done.
Yes.
That's right.
And madam chair and members.
The I was actually we need to
get a first.
Let's let's just.
So we have a motion that we have
a second.
Okay when everybody has the at
the amendment will proceed.
Get madam chair the problem with
the why the robbery statute
needs to be in this bill is
there was an incident it's a few
years ago we're a shoplifter was
attempting to leave the store
and store employees detained in
and the shoplifter pulled a gun
on the store employee.
Those traditionally have been
prosecuted as a robbery.
The case was appealed to the New
Mexico Supreme Court who ruled
that it was two different acts
one being shoplifting the other
being aggravated assault.
I disagree with that but this is
a way to correct it.
Originally I was going to
introduce a separate bill
because you're aware if you
start getting too many penalty
enhancements and a bill lot of
time said it stalls the
legislation.
But in order to make the best
bill.
This would be one of the
components so the first part is
the fix for the armed robbery.
The second portion of the bill
is adding the racketeering
statute into my legislation and
all this will be added between
lines one the.
Right.
Two years twenty and twenty one.
But if we get to the page number
that you're out yes so if we go
to page three of course the
office we lines twenty and
twenty one we're gonna have it
all here.
Yeah.
Legislation and and speaking
with the retailers they needed a
longer period of time law
enforcement request a longer
period of time and that's how we
keen to one calendar year that's
in my legislation to look at the
theft over that period.
Why would we need that'll
million mount of time.
We have individuals coming into
a store who are mass we have
individuals that we can't
identify for the store employees
don't know.
Consequently that's why we have
a longer period of time.
Let's talk about how the
prosecution will occur.
Each store.
And I think we're all aware
every store that we go into now
has video cameras watching us so
they're watching us place items
into the car and that are
watching the individual leave
the premise and not pay for
those items.
Once we're in the parking lot
it's an orchestrated a bill out
there's generally three or four
individuals per car.
The individuals in the car
quickly jumped out and help the
other one put the stolen items
in the car and then they move to
another business.
The best example that I can give
you up of how they're selling
this stuff is to look at the
brutality gaming in Albuquerque.
Just a couple weeks ago.
The F. B. R. Y..
Executed a search warrant on
their location and their storage
of facilities they were using
storage you know commercial
storage lots and recovered over
a hundred thousand dollars.
In stolen items.
The other way that the
individuals are selling this is
there going on to Facebook
retail or whatever they call I'm
not good at that but there's
someone over the internet.
Now if someone has six brand new
drills and they're not a company
that should be a flag that this
is stolen property.
As the
Hector Balderas said when he was
AG it was more profitable to to
do she commercial shoplifting
this way that was to sell drugs.
Many of these individuals are
convicted felons.
This is a credible enterprise
working in in concert with each
other.
And that is why we must hard at
them as a commercial enterprise
and get tough on retail crime.
And madam chair with that I
think I'll go ahead and stand
for questions I'd ask for you to
look at the editorials they're
pretty explicit about the
problem and speak about the
solution.
Thank you Representative.
I'm gonna go to the
To the audience is anybody in
favor of this bill.
Anybody opposed.
Okay.
Yes we on this side of the road
so we will start with who is in
favor of the bill.
So maybe if you'll set up
introduce yourself and give your
statement.
Members of the.
NEO.
I.
Priorities.
Because of the.
To work this.
Read more people the reason.
Back in the order of the job.
Our regional secretary.
It results our across New Mexico
were very concerned about the
growing impact organized by
having.
Service.
external that which includes
organized by right.
Ninety four point five billion
dollars.
Reserve your over here in the
plans and in our retail stores
and reports that those are
becoming more violent and
aggressive.
Relations orders result.
The loss of our product for a
long.
Awesome resellers in terms of
prices for the work items you
know still one of our stories
right from.
Razors what version viability
hi.
This result in losses in the
press or result workers arteries
of the reported use brexit act
of violence.
This is what the legislation we
need to do this issue more areas
and.
Thank you next.
madam chair members of the
committee had water rest of this
little more investors supported
very well also in the finals.
Thank you yes on the side.
Madam chair members of the
committee these Carolyn COMITTA
she with the.
Thank you.
And then the on my right side.
Alright.
Anybody opposed to the bill.
Yes ma'am.
I'm sure members of the
committee.
New Mexico.
What we recognize the problem
this bill works with dress and
make sure that we created the
saver business owners they cycle
closes SB fifty nine as notice
as noted in your public defender
department by behavior online
bill is already covered by
existing larceny and
racketeering statutes SO we'll
remedies for retailers.
Expanding criminalization is not
an effective deterrent and.
The chamber of commerce I'd like
to first indicate our support
for the amendment that was
presented we believe it
strengthens our laws against
robbery and it improves the
bill.
As each of the fifty five we are
in support of the health in New
Mexico we have a major worst
problem with serial S. healthy.
Anyone and they'll tell you a
story of watching a small.
People running in.
Great tools and.
And one now it's demoralizing to
the public.
scared and employees feel
helpless these are dangerous
situations playing around town
not able to be to aggregate the
value of the merchandise they
steal is a loophole in our.
Statutes it's a loophole that's
being exploited and as customers
and residents were all paying
the price our chamber in our
city retailers have worked with
Representative Rehm on this
issue for several years and we
preferred a longer aggregation
period that is present in this
bill thank you madam chair.
You.
Mark the.
Good afternoon madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is mark Peralta Silva and I'm
here on behalf of the law
offices of the public defender
on behalf of the LAPD we
respectfully oppose this
proposed legislation and the
amendments I would encourage the
committee to look at that by our
and the statements quoted from
our analysis as has already been
noted many of the the times to
to cover organized retail crime
in this bill I'm already covered
and shoplifting larceny and
racketeering it doesn't just
provide any new avenues of
prosecution that are already
available additionally there are
civil remedies that
these retailers can pursue and
we think that when it comes to
think about the root causes of
this crime and that this bill
doesn't necessarily need what it
intends to and for these reasons
we respectfully oppose thank
you.
Thank you.
Carlo.
Madam chair and members of the
committee this is Leri Sonntag
here for the New Mexico business
coalition we stand in full
support of house bill fifty five
something that is long overdue
we really appreciate that that
actually of Representative Rehm
to continue year after year
bring forward this type of
bills.
And this not only affects
retail outlets this affects
businesses their employees to
see what's going on the.
Level of people the audacity of
shoplifters now the violence is
often countered in those
situations with apprehension
astride the maybe.
Appreciate you members of the
Sanchez added to the bills in
addition to the potatoes that
was already there.
I just want to add in prior life
I get twenty years with the
Albuquerque police department
and fifteen almost twenty years
ago there is a major problem
with organized shoplifters who
were targeting retail
establishments over and over I
say this type of the bill is
long overdue and we encourage
you to support passed house bill
fifty five thank you.
Thank you.
Okay we are on the minute
They're on the amendment so if
the idea.
Federal has anything to add like
to any questions.
Yes Representative Lundstrom.
Just try to you don't.
I know this using
it's very it is.
I just want to try to get my
head around.
Management Ms.
Updating language.
R. as it is to the patient.
retail activities.
Madam chair and Representative
Lundstrom and although the
further on on how it's written.
Our courts have been very clear
that language has to be somewhat
if you will in late terms you
need to be able to read this and
understand that if you do this
act you were violating the law
that's why I have separated them
out in the individual acts.
So that it's clear that if you
do any that's robbery if you do
B. that's robbery and that's why
they've been separated out.
There's been comments that we
could utilized our current
larceny and shoplifting
statutes.
The courts have been very clear.
They are individual acts and
most of them are just what
they're smart enough is to steal
under five hundred dollars so
which is a misdemeanor Act.
This legislation allows us to
add up.
All of the stolen items from all
the stores in charge that
appropriate thousand I just
trying to understand what the
amendment is doing with the bill
thank.
Anybody else on the amendment.
We have a motion for the
amendment.
Would you possible.
The motion for a do pass and the
second and educate the public
rock.
Representative an enormous.
Yes.
Representative Duncan.
Yes.
Representative and is yes.
Representative Lente.
Representative little yes.
Representative Lundstrom yes.
Representative Martinez yes.
Mason.
Representative Matthews.
Know what I'm saying the reason.
What about first and then you
can follow your comments thank
you.
I share Serrato yes on the
amendment.
Madam chair guy goes yes on the
internet madam chair the guesses
are eight and those are one K.
twelve don't.
Senator Matthews.
Madam chair and members of the
committee I.
When the Representative ring was
describing the amendment he
talked about it having something
in here about one calendar year
but I actually not finding that
language.
But one calendar year under the
law is actually January one to
December thirty one and it is
shorter than one year which is
twelve months
and so for that if if that's in
here and I actually didn't never
did find that language I
potentially would shorten the
period that is what calendar
year issues in this just posted
funds.
Thank you Representative
Matthews we selected make
comment on that Representative.
Madam chair and I'm sorry if the
members on this understood if I
can take you to page three one
seventeen the aggravated of
value will be over one calendar
year.
Madam chair if I just
clarification so that language
that you talked about is not in
the.
But it's in your budget.
Madam chair Representative
Matthews it is not in the
amendment it's in the original
bill for that time period to
look at stolen property to
charge the theft over one
calendar year.
Madam chair with that
explanation that that's not part
of the amendment and I would yes
please if I can do that.
Modified that.
And.
So as modify the test is our
line and the nose are zero.
So we could go on to the amended
bill thank you madam chair
again so I explained earlier
this is to address this
organized crime we'll look at
the sept over three year period.
Each individual store will be
requested to identify the stolen
property and as we see nowadays
they will help the video of the
offenders.
they also may have the video of
the co conspirators out in the
parking lot.
And with that I think I guess
questions I can give you
examples of what we're seeing
you know
If you go into a store high
theft items are locked up if we
look at like Walgreens and save
from Cisco Walgreens pulled out
of San Francisco because of
shoplifting theft we could.
That our next door app that we
see every other day there's
something on there so.
I think we all understand the
problem.
Thank you Representative does
anybody have any questions
about.
Representative Martinez.
Madam chair representative re up
couple of questions.
Strickler and.
Shop for my own curiosity on
page one.
Of the bill.
Winds twenty one and twenty two.
One which is the private retail
of merchandise on two more
occasions the private multiple
retailers located in the state.
So I could if I was a thief.
I go to Walmart by steel.
Whatever.
I go down the street to home
people should do whatever goals
are combined.
Madam chair and Representative
Martínez yes in your describing
exactly what they're doing so
there will be generally three or
four people in a car and they
they go to one store whether you
want to make a Walmart target or
home depot.
They go in that store the steel
items they return to the car.
The drive to the next location
another one in the car goes in
and commits the the shoplifting.
Returns to a car and they do
that until late.
Have a cart full of items and
then they go to school dispersed
of those items and then return
doing the same thing.
Madam chair representative on.
We've all seen what's going on
people are no longer afraid to.
Get costs are so much
protections for.
the thief and very little for.
The moment pop shops Madam chair
representative in my district I
spoke to a lot of small
business.
and I'm not I'm not seeing
small.
Technical term I'm talking
about.
Small businesses for.
A lady owns it and points for
two kids because that's what you
can afford to pay.
and she described stealing a box
of paper which.
Cuts in two of the profits for
that day.
This type of bill I believe is
which desperately needed.
People need to be afraid to
commit crimes again.
I appreciate you bringing this
forward there was some.
Comments madam chair
representative all from people
who oppose this but I just.
Just didn't quite.
Understand I couldn't wrap my
head around.
Why there would be opposition to
this bill we see it everywhere
every district in the state of
New Mexico.
Madam chair representative.
Seeing that climbing of prime in
their area.
Madam chair representative I
have always learned.
That small business is the
backbone of any economy.
Madam chair representative I
think this bill will protect
that.
Small business again.
People don't want to open small
businesses because there's.
Problems not only.
Administering that small
business but then people not
afraid to come in and take your
stuff.
I had one one other question
madam chair.
All.
There was a question about.
The term calendar year.
This.
Why did you choose.
One calendar year Madam chair
representative.
Madam chair and Representative
Martinez you've actually there's
two questions about the calendar
year we selected based on.
You know what to provide time or
we could have said.
One year from the date of the
first offense and we chose a
calendar year it was easy to
understand and that's why it was
chosen the back up on the first
party years statement before you
got to the question I think it's
important to understand the
intent of this bill this is to
go after organized retail theft.
Let's for a moment say that
someone is stealing a loaf of
bread Act Gallo the milk.
And they do that two or more
times two or three times.
We go over to page two we're
going to add up all of that and
we're going to see that on.
On one thirteen.
That they only committed a petty
misdemeanor.
So this was done intentionally
to go after the high throughout
the high shoplifters shoplifters
who are stealing a lot of items.
And and that in my example you
would have two or three petty
agency owners if you want to
prop prosecute them
individually.
Four under this legislation you
could aggravate of you know Adam
up but they still would be a
petty misdemeanor want to take
you to one other important are
part of this.
If you go to page three line of
eleven an individual charged
with a violation this section
shall not be charged with the
separate or additional options
sure you may have to decide are
you going to Adam up.
Are you going to prosecute them
individually.
So you don't have a double
jeopardy issue.
And that's what that is for.
Madam chair representative thank
you for that explanation and
once again thank you for
bringing this bill forward.
I'm sure small businesses across
the state cheering you all.
Thank you madam chair.
Senator thank you.
Thank you madam chair
The.
If somebody in the back
representative of retail I think
our chamber of commerce this is
the core of the jobs in the
state are retail jobs and and I
would like if if you could tell
me how many of those among pods.
Would you be able to address
that Sir.
I don't.
Okay and my my point areas yes
it is eight this continues to
happen and the people who have
to write payroll checks after
have to literally when there's a
thousand dollar deductible image
they continued happy that they
will go out of business.
So if I could I would like to
ask I I find it fascinating that
those who either have never had
a of the business or are in a
business they serve their civil
remedies available like yes the
young lady in the arms loss
there.
I could.
Actually located okay Madam
okay.
All right the representative
have you ever been told how the
civil remedies come about when
they can't catch them.
Yeah madam chair and
representative Duncan what
they're talking about it's a
could sue the individual.
Wealthy individuals running out
of the store we may have an
identity issue of trying to
identify who were going to suit.
So yeah it it.
We're gonna have to go out
there's have it at a different
angle.
some of the individuals who are
the criminals up really they
don't have much.
they're doing it for whatever
reason.
But it
Yeah they would have to sue them
individually.
Thank you madam chair.
Sorry about that.
Representative Serrato.
Thank you madam chairman thank
you Representative for bringing
this forward you know I know you
brought this up before I think a
lot of businesses appreciate
your your focus on it because
this is a conversation we've
seen it across the state as my
colleagues have mentioned I've
seen in my own community and I
know my businesses in my part of
town are scared and it's hard
and so I wanted to just say that
first because they're things I
think are very valuable in this
bill I really like a lot of the
work done
and I would you want to say you
know we've seen that what's in
effect currently is not
preventing these crimes are
happening and some of what I
read you know of some sort of
had forty thousand dollars worth
of items stolen from them and
that this is a problem that we
really do need to address my
concerns I will say just the
just the content of the bill and
I'm and just for some my
clarification and so reserve
maybe don't question so I
appreciate your patience with
them
for what is difference in a year
and a calendar year and the
reason why I'm asking madam
chair and representative as kids
on the first page on line twenty
three we have the the deprived
over the span of the year over
year and then on page three we
have over the span of one
calendar year histories why
those two were state and what
the difference is in fact.
Madam chair in Representative
Serrato the.
The the paragraph on page three
gives you the definition that it
is a calendar year that we're
talking about that is the year
I agree with you we could
probably add calendar year on
the front page and make it more
specific one of the.
Things that maybe some of the
members of this committee or are
aware of let's take the City of
Albuquerque.
There is a lawsuit from the
early nineties that is called
the Clinton lawsuit.
The the Clinton lawsuit dealt
with overcrowding at the
Bernalillo county detention
center.
When the department of justice
came in and began supervising
the Albuquerque police
department the my client lawsuit
got rolled into the department
of justice
agreement.
twenty.
Different crimes the Albuquerque
police cannot arrest for.
One of them is misdemeanours
shoplifting.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative
I just.
Senator so we see a calendar
year that means December thirty
first is that right.
madam chair.
Right now to budgeteers January
wants to to December thirty
first okay and so that means
madam chair representative that
if someone were to be aggregated
that the stolen no member it be
a greater from November till the
thirty first and start fresh
again is that madam chair and
managed by your that is exactly
correct that's helpful that for
my own clarification we live
very mixed feelings about that
it at different times I I
appreciate it one part of right
and I well but I wanted to be
you know if we approach those
little difficult not and I do
want to go to one other piece
Madam chairwoman and it is
something that was in the FIR
that was brought up by one of
the folks that the PED had noted
that some of these terms are not
defined and it says in the FIR
and I won't read because I know
that's against the rules but on
terms concerted effort and
coordinated plan they're not
defined and it could be
difficult to actually apply the
law because they're not defined
on a you know if the the
representative want to speak to
that madam chair yeah madam
chair and then a vice chair I
think that concerted effort but
when we start defining terms is
when they could be in big U. S.
if you were but I think we
understand what a concerted
effort means you know two or
more individuals working
together.
Thank you madam chairman and
thank you Representative again I
I really do appreciate you your
you've been steadfast in this
you've done an amazing job
keeping up I'm still considering
how those pieces come together
but I do appreciate your work.
Representative Matthews.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee and thank you
Representative Rehm just six
just a couple of questions about
your HB forty fifty five sorry
It.
You just talked about
a concerted effort means that we
have more than.
One person involved in the crime
is that correct.
madam chair and Representative
Matthews yes.
So you're H. B. fifty five
doesn't deal with the individual
shoplifter.
May be acting alone is that a
fair statement madam chair
And.
and Representative Matthews let
me take you over to page one
line eighteen so organized
retail crime consist of one or
more of the following acts as
part of a concerted effort with
one.
For more co conspirators.
So you can have a one person
crime.
Madam chair representative
right.
You can have one person acting
alone.
I just make sure I understand
what you're saying and that
constitute a concerted.
Efforts with one or more core co
conspirators.
Madam chair.
Representative Matthews yes and
what we're really trying to get
after.
Bills for that's where we're
really trying to get after it
is.
Madam chair representative right
I understand that we all want to
deal with the gangs but my
question is really very simple
we do have individual
shoplifters acting concert
wearing as Mexico or as a co
conspirator with others degree
would that.
Madam chair and Representative
Matthews yes so I have arrested
professional shoplifters who.
Had a list of specific items to
steal.
Madam chair representative so we
agree with the one person acting
along to chapters correct Madam
chair Representative Matthews
yes one or more and madam chair
Representative Rehm as I read HB
fifty five it does not apply to
that single shoplifter acting
long you might correct in my
understanding of the bill.
Madam chair Representative
Matthews I think you are
correctly reading.
Thank you madam chair and then
the second question on page
three of your bill
You have the the penalties laid
out and.
For example in order for it to
be a second degree felony.
Prime the act the value the
aggregate value has to be at
least twenty thousand dollars
and I reading that correctly.
Madam chair and Representative
Matthews if you go to the
larceny statute you will find
these definitions for stealing
items and that is exactly what
it is from the larceny statute.
Madam chair representative
revived.
Thank you for that answer I
appreciate those those are the
same larceny up to twenty
thousand is going to be a second
degree felony this crime will be
up to twenty thousand dollars is
a second degree felony.
Right.
Madam chair in Representative
Matthews you are correct.
And I'm I'm looking at the
aggregate value not the
individual incidents that you do
is you could add my prior
description you could have
someone stealing a loaf of bread
and a gallon of milk and do that
a couple of times and I'm not
trying to make that action of
felony.
I'm trying to go after the real
group that is stealing a lot of
items that will rise to the
felony level.
Rather than maybe someone who's
really on bedtimes and stealing
just to go ahead and make a our.
Madam chair representative re my
Preciado that but
While you can find the crime
organized retail crime the
penalty is no different than and
then under existing law is that
correct.
Madam chair and Representative
Matthews correct other than what
we're gonna take with the
existing law we're gonna take
each incident and at the Phelps
up and then look at the value of
the property that was stolen.
And that will be the penalty for
the theft.
Have.
Representative how is it
different in existing law
existing shoplifting.
Madam chair representative you
Matthews I don't and state of.
Your question.
Somebody.
Shoplifting.
you Madam charge into the value
of the merchandise they take
madam chair and then you.
Look to see where falls in the
range of penalties.
That's what your bill yes
correct.
Madam chair representative
Matthews you're correct what we
what we're looking at is most of
the organized shoplifters are
trying to steal under the felony
level so that's under five
hundred dollars so I I go to
Walmart and I still four hundred
dollars I go next door to target
and the steel four hundred
dollars and I go to home depot
and I still three hundred we are
now eighth we're Levin hundred
dollars and so I've gone from a
misdemeanor to a fourth degree
felony.
And that's what we're trying to
do is we will Adam up and come
to that level.
Madam chair representative
remind I understand we act you
the change you made is to
aggregate the value of the items
take.
Madam chair and Representative
Matthews yes as I just described
and.
Madam chair representative bring
my question really is that why
you do allow for the
aggregation.
There is you have not increased
the penalty.
For.
prime.
Sample of.
It's still takes twenty thousand
dollars worth of the value of
the merchandise to get to a
second felony that's on these.
Madam chair and Representative
Matthews you're correct and let
me explain it to the committee
looks like some confusion so
let's take money you stole four
hundred you stole four hundred
and you stole three hundred.
Under this bill and under
current law.
The law enforcement agency or
the DA has a choice of charging
three misdemeanor crimes.
Because are all less than five
hundred dollars.
Or if this bill were to pass
they do a good say I'm gonna put
all those together and they're
now worth more than.
Five hundred dollars so we now
have a forty degree felony or
eighteen months in prison.
And if they continue to do more
or if they're doing shoplifting
where they're stealing high
dollar items you could have it
incident we're somebody steals
something that is a twenty
thousand dollar value period.
And and share it with friends
Representative Rehm
I provided you with a copy of
the of of HB two thirty four
several days ago correct Madam
chair representative Matthews
GS and and Representative
I'm sorry madam chair for
Representative Rehm
the the approach that we took
was to create a new crime
organized retail crime also the
aggregation but we provided that
give the games were stealing
whether twenty five hundred
dollars within a year hi County
here that the.
At that the penalty would be a
second degree felony would you
agree with me that.
Eight three two three four is
providing a.
More stringent penalty.
for.
Organized retail crime.
Madam chair and representative
Matthews I did not read your
still in great detail I saw that
So I think we need to stick on
yours stay on your bill yeah.
Here you'll be presenting your
bill next okay Madam chair
representative I'm I'm trying to
do to do is is
there's no the only change that
you may is that you allow the
aggregation of the value of the
I'm still in different places.
Madam chair and Representative
Matthews yes.
Thank you.
It is a yes anything is because
I have a couple questions.
All right
so Representative.
I guess I'm I'm confused as to
why the definitions are not
tighter that that's concerning
to me when you talk about
concerted what constitutes for
concerted efforts should this be
defined.
Madam madam chair right I
believe that it is an understood
term.
And therefore not to provide.
You know what we create and
define it if if the committee
really wants a definition for.
Well then I'd go to the next one
that says when we talk about
coordinated plan
what constitute as a coordinated
plan.
Madam chair in
I think that what you're seeing
there is
a coordinated plan is the this
that I'm going from store to
store we're working in concert
with each other going to
multiple stores and stealing.
At and Representative I they.
So in having a conversation with
you I I understand your your
thoughts and in your intent but
I think when we when we're
constructing laws I think we
need to have clear definitions
because
those will be reflected back on
into later on past sentencing
and so if those are those in
definitions are not clear I
think it because very and big
blue and so that is my one of my
concerns that several of your
terms.
All seeing for me as a layman I
don't practice law but if if
they're they're very ambiguous
and when we're we're doing when
we are constructing these bills
I think we have to be very
technical
you know I I I know that the.
The Judiciary Committee would
would be talking about some of
these issues but I believe in
this committee that we need to
talk about technical issues
because we had this past
everything want to Judiciary and
say they'll they'll sort it out
we have a job to do that we we
would worry needs still with our
our subject matter but we also
need to look into technical
issues and that's what I'm
looking at here and and that's
what I am concerned
You know
well when you talk about.
Coordinated plan so can the
planner.
of a coordinated plan be
prosecuted under this bill.
Madam chair yes and you're
talking about a coach and
speaker so in our statute we
have conspiracy we have
accessory and then of course the
individual you who commits a
crime so an accessory can be.
Get out during the commission of
the crime or after the fact and
yes they can be prosecuted.
Hey
And I does this bill out for
actor activation across state
lines.
madam chair no New Mexico only
has jurisdiction within its
borders under state law.
those are the questions I had is
if anybody else has any question
or comment.
To pass.
The motion.
And a second.
Educ you could call.
Representative and in order.
No.
Representative Duncan.
Yes.
Representative Hernandez yes.
Representative Lente nope.
Representative little yes.
Representative Lundstrom.
Representative Martinez yes.
Representative Mason.
Representative Matthews.
That no one.
By share Serrato no.
And madam chair guys yeah.
Madam chair the test is are five
and the nose are I okay
Representative you want to share
your.
Yes thank you madam chair and
thank you Representative Rehm
you know often on we did have
communications about trying to
work together on this and it
just didn't seem to work out
but I appreciate your efforts in
this area we share a desire to
make a difference in this in
improving the public safety in
our cities and throughout our
state and I
I think you are very sincere
about that as I am
and the reason I voted against
this is because for a couple
reasons one is I do think that
when we strengthen this law we
have to apply it to single
shareholders I'm sorry this year
published single shoplifters not
yes gangs and the second reason
is that I think is important to
enhance the penalties so that
they can hopefully have a
deterrent effect and for that
reason I just wanted to explain
to you why I was voting against
them thank you.
Okay.
I would like to make a motion to
table.
Session.
Representative and in order.
Yes the table.
Representative Duncan no.
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lente yes.
Representative little.
Representative Lundstrom.
Representative Martinez nope.
Representative Mason.
Representative Matthews.
Sorry.
To table yes.
I sure Serrato yes table.
Madam chair guy goes yes to
table.
Madam chair yes is R. five and
the those are I okay so we have
a tie but what I would.
will build and then you look at
the.
And developing
We are you are hearing is
because of that we're wanting we
are tired your bill's thank you
madam chair.
You.
That.
Madam chair members of the
committee
Sure seems to be very low but.
If you don't mind I'll switch
here.
He's a little taller.
Members of the committee thank
you for allowing me to change
shares.
And
Before I begin talking about the
bill just very briefly I'd like
to introduce to people sitting
with me
I'm gonna let you.
When when New Mexico state
police.
Probably president and CEO The
New Mexico chamber of commerce.
Madam chair members of the
committee good afternoon my name
is Damon Martinez senior policy
adviser at the Albuquerque
police department.
Madam chair and members of the
committee we also have
on June who will be joining as
at Sean Solomon who is with the
attorney general's office and to
as a deputy Attorney General I'm
sorry I deputy district attorney
in the second judicial District
prosecuted many of these kinds
of cases.
And let me just make a very
brief statement and then what
would you like to do a show of a
short video to give everybody a
sense ever real sense of this
crime and how frightening it is
outstanding Representative it's
under.
The minutes.
Madam chair last time we ran it
was definitely under three
minutes.
to madam chair members of the
committee members of the
audience and those on the June
house bill two thirty four is a
response to a disturbing and
frightening development in
criminal behavior that is
criminal gangs often armed who
literally attack retail stores
and make off with substantial
amounts of drugs and most
importantly in the process of
doing show they terrorized
shoppers and employees of the
stores.
I have worked with
a number of law enforcement
partners in the process of
preparing this
H. B. two thirty four and the
New Mexico chamber of commerce
the City of Albuquerque's
represented here by Mr Martinez
is a former US attorney
And the second judicial district
of district attorney's office
both Attorney General Hector
about their issue current
Attorney General well tors
This when this crime occurs the
items are then sold often
through the internet or through
fences and the proceeds then go
to fund other criminal
enterprises such as human
trafficking and illegal drug.
In illegal drugs this is become
such a problem that you now see
in many places in this state
security guards are off duty
police guarding the exit many
major retailers smaller
retailers many who cannot afford
hiring security guards are also
victimized by these gangs and
we'll have some testimony today
from small retailers who spaces
this real problem so at this
point I'd like to pause and run
the video.
When it comes to retail crime
officers are just saying petty
shoplifters using violent repeat
offenders sometimes and guns and
bullet proof vests.
Just days after a suspected
shoplifter opened fire on an
Albuquerque Walmart and then
pulled a gun on this agency
security guard when trying to
make off with the case of beer
officers of the measure are
taking measures to crack down on
violent shoplifters we we've
seen an increase in violence
shootings in retail centers and
so it was important that we step
up operations now a PD says it
has made one hundred and fifteen
arrests for organized retail
crime over the past year these
arrests turned up three hand
guns eight stolen cars and more
than twenty six thousand dollars
in stolen property well the FBI
is looking for fifty one year
old lenders only Cerro the FBI
says and they found these and
hundreds of other a possibly
stolen items at his home and
storage unit detectives believe
he's involved with a violent
game in Albuquerque.
The the this right power tools
and types of things that you
would find at your local home
depot stacks of suspected stolen
items more than three hundred
bottles of alcohol fifty one
fire arms into several thousand
rounds of ammunition now in the
possession of the FBI the FBI
saying that this case is a prime
example of how the violent gangs
they go after are related to the
crime many of us see every day
we say right that we have become
problems if we say we have a
drug problem we say we have a
retail theft problem well that's
very circular right is very
cyclical because these types of
things can be used as a barter
system the FBI says this of
money making it task forces the
same group that seized and the
record one point one million
Sentinel pales in Albuquerque
last September these can make
more money stealing from
businesses and then they can
selling drugs or guns the
Attorney General to more of
Albuquerque law enforcement
business leaders say retail
crime is out of control and they
are demanding changes it is more
profitable now to go in steel.
From our local retailers than it
is to sell drugs and guns in New
Mexico.
Thank you madam chair for
allowing us to to show the video
I think that it really
demonstrates how serious this is
and absolutely agree with
Representative Rehm and with the
people on the on the video that
we actually need to do something
about this
and H. B. two thirty four
response in five ways to.
Organized retail crime and to
shoplifting first of all H. B.
two thirty four then see
existing robbery statute to make
it clear that using a gun in the
escape in the escape of stealing
property constitutes robbery.
Excuse me and it is capable of
stealing property also
constitutes robbery there is a.
As all court of appeals opinion
that indicated that that that is
that going to go on a years
gaping out was not necessarily
armed robbery and that is you'll
hear from the expert witnesses
has oxygen prosecutions secondly
H. B. two thirty four creates
the crime of organized retail
crime and it applies to members
of gangs which over a twelve
month period steel at least
twenty five hundred dollars
every gated value worth of
merchandise from retailers we
allow the activation of the
value of the merchandise stolen
from one or more retailers.
Third of H. B. two thirty four
also applies to individual shop
low shoplifters not just those
who are acting in a gang
and you again you'll hear
testimony that there's that this
is a serious problem aso it also
provides for the aggregation of
the value of the merchandise
stolen from one or more
retailers over a ninety day
period and I shorter period
because as Representative re
mitigated we're not trying to
we're not trying to apply this
law to somebody stealing baloney
and some food for the family
third I'm sorry for H. B. two
thirty four allows the crimes to
be prosecuted in any county in
which they occur.
And for the H. B. two thirty
four edge of organized retail
crime to the list of crimes that
constitute racketeering under
New Mexico law and the advantage
of that is it gives victims
additional rights to recover the
value of the items stolen from
the perpetrators and with that
I would like to go to Sean
Solomon who is on the zoom.
and who is our expert who is
currently with the New Mexico
attorney general's office.
Okay you're on Mr solvent.
Thank you good afternoon madam
chair members of the committee
thank you for the opportunity to
appear before you today
virtually as it were a special
thanks Representative Matthews
for sponsoring this important
legislation my name's Sean
Sullivan and current currently
work for the attorney general's
office I appear on behalf of
Attorney General Raul Torres who
strongly supports this
legislation.
Former professional life I
worked the second judicial
district attorney's office for
the better part of the last
decade for the last six plus
years I was the deputy DA
supervising the trial division
which was responsible for
prosecuting about eighty percent
of the felony crime that took
place in Bernalillo county.
It's in that capacity in that
role but I can understand the
scourge of organized retail
crime and what I call retail
robbery as I'm sure the
committee is well aware from
retailers and business owners in
their districts organized retail
crime is absolutely out of
control it's costs the state
thousands and jobs and
accompanying wages millions in
lost tax revenue but those
adverse economic impacts
staggering as they are not
really pale in comparison to the
human toll that I've seen in my
job I've spent countless hours
talking to and taking statements
from employees at these
retailers who have become
victims of violent crime.
Secured a known shoplifter who
brazenly walks into target
smashes the protective glass
with a hammer takes six cell
phones when approached by loss
prevention threatens to hit that
employee with a hammer.
Prosecuted a male and a female
accomplice will walking out of
Walmart after stealing a
television pointing approached
by store employees the mail
offender pepper sprayed to loss
prevention officers and the
female displayed a stun gun the
mail then re entered the store
holding his waistband as if you
had a firearm tucked inside.
I and I assure you that this is
not the type of violence that is
in Albuquerque only issue I
prosecuted a complication Santa
Fe for an offender the fire on
the loss prevention employee
mere feet away from him just
because the employee was trying
to check his receipt this
happened at market place
supermarket it's less than two
miles from where you all are
sitting at the capitol.
To be part of that solution AG
Tauruses committed continuing
and enhancing the offices
organized retail crime task
force which is an important
statewide partnership between
prosecutors law enforcement and
large retailers and small
businesses alike were dedicated
to sustain cooperation in
tackling organised organized
retail crime I believe H. B. two
thirty four will provide law
enforcement officers and
prosecutors alike important tool
so we can begin to get our arms
around this problem.
Representative Matthews laid out
several of the tenants of the
legislation from my perspective
this really for things to focus
on in terms of helping law
enforcement and helping
prosecutors the first is that
the bill closes what I call the
blue Representative Matthews
spoke of this state versus blue
is a court of appeals decision
from actually the early nineties
it prevents and what individuals
from being charged with robbery
or armed robbery when the
offender uses force or violence
or threaten to use of force or
violence to retain property that
is to keep property that they've
already stolen four two
affectionately in the state
there's many instances I
prosecuted many cases where
items are shoplifted of the
individual walked past all
points of sale and upon loss
prevention attempting to take
back their merchandise the
offender produces a weapon so as
to retain the items and be able
to leave the same under that set
of facts currently prosecutors
faced obstacles in charging
armed robbery and we're faced
with proceeding on lesser
charges with this legislation
before the committee the crime
of robbery will be clarified to
include those situations and
allow prosecutors to hold
offenders accountable for the
full extent of their actions.
The second thing is that this
bill addresses what is the
habitual shoplifter problem that
we're all very well aware of
those shoplifters currently face
only petty misdemeanor or
misdemeanor charges without any
real repercussions when they
intentionally so shop a shop up
slightly below the felony
threshold it is not uncommon and
Representative ring correctly
mentioned this for shoplifters
to steal just below the five
hundred dollars on the threshold
they are aware of what makes
them a felony they respond to
that to that stimuli H. B. two
thirty four left allow
shoplifting offenses committed
within a period of ninety days
at one or more retailers to be
aggregated in charge for porting
like that would be incredibly
helpful to prosecutors are
currently if an offender walks
into target shop was four
hundred dollars worth of
merchandise and then in a month
walks into Walmart and shop this
another four hundred dollars
worth of merchandise that person
faces two misdemeanor charges
under subsection or section to
see of this bill prosecutors
would have the option of
aggregating those expenses for a
total of eight hundred dollars
which would be over the fourth
degree felony offense threshold
of five hundred dollars this
provision appropriately targets
those to visual fees and
provides a more effective
deterrent to their behavior.
Third the bill creates as
Representative Matthews noted
the new statutory offense of
organized retail crime which is
a statute that by my count about
half the states currently have
on the books I it would be
punished as a second degree
felony the reason why organized
retail crime is not the same
thing as simple one off
shoplifting it is a coordinated
effort between individuals are
members of groups to steal items
for possession of stolen items
with the ultimate intent to
reintroduce them legally back
into the market whether that be
brick and mortar locations like
flea markets and pawn shops or
increasingly through online
ecommerce platforms these
proceeds are then used to fund
any number of illegal activities
in coordinator retail theft
schemes the individual
shoplifting on behalf of the
group is called the booster
you've heard that term on the
house and the people who accept
the stolen goods to resell back
into the market called fences
this legislation criminalizes
both of those groups the booster
that takes the merchandise and
the fence to resell the
merchandise with that aggregate
value of the stolen items seeds
twenty five hundred dollars
within the span of a year one
year the legislation also
targets those who coordinate in
organized activities those
individuals if passed law
enforcement will possess another
tool in their arsenal to
investigate organized retail
theft lastly this bill adds
organized retail crime list of
predicate crimes and
racketeering statute which
provides an additional Avenue
for law enforcement and
prosecutors to curb an
enterprise pattern of illicit
activity.
To be clear this is not a bill
about punishing the occasional
low dollar shoplifter it's about
holding those very dangerous
individuals accountable and
those habitual offenders
accountable to drive the crime
and make our communities last is
our I leave the committee with
this I spent some time recently
in Minneapolis at the retail
industry leaders symposium in
which a number of businesses and
prosecutors around the country
discussed the issues associated
with organized retail crime
a top executive from Walmart was
present he told the entire group
the story about employees at a
New Mexico store that he had
recently visited being afraid to
go to work because of the near
constant threat of violent
encounters with shoplifters that
was the impression of New Mexico
that everyone in that room was
left with that does not have to
be New Mexico's reputation in
this arena in this legislative
session we're at an inflection
point with organized retail
crime the status quo is simply
not an option I asked the
committee to stand with the
attorney general's office and
the other important stakeholders
here today to support H. B. two
thirty four thank you again for
your time I'd be happy to answer
any questions.
Thank you
And the now.
See I I guess would just go down
the line here and I to these
experts weigh in.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you for allowing
me to spend some time with you
and I'm here from a law
enforcement perspective in
reference to this crimes
specifically those that are
shoplifters that continue to
commit these crimes to face
Littleton no consequences for
their actions just like anything
else if they continue to commit
these crimes knowing that and
knowing that they can get away
with it now that they know that
they get away with it they
continue to push the envelope
which then in turn state commit
crimes more violent we deal with
this on a daily basis and with
violence they use weapons
whether it's weapons deadly
weapons or force with a cost
harm on these individuals which
creates an unsafe environment I
can specifically tell you a
story of a of a gentleman who
lost his life because he was at
a gas clerk at the spits in
Edgewood and they went in there
to commit shoplifting stole some
items and he went out to protect
the store and he ended up losing
his life.
So again you can it creates an
unsafe environment we all in our
communities want to be able to
go out with our families to
spend quality time together
whether simply hanging out or
simply buying groceries to put
food on the table citizens of
New Mexico are witnessing these
crimes being committed creating
fear within our community this
piece of legislation will create
consequences that would serve as
a deterrent but will also create
real consequences for those who
chose to ignore the law thank
you.
Madam chair members of the
committee rob black with the New
Mexico chamber appreciate the
opportunity to speak with you
today
I'm gonna share some statistics
a kind of a financial impact of
the tax impact and then a little
bit more on kind of the the the
community an employee impact
it as mentioned earlier first
there is about an estimated
seventy billion dollars worth of
products still in in twenty
nineteen that's on average every
year cost about one point five
percent of total retail sales
it's estimated that name that
it's about fifteen billion
dollars in loss to personal
business tax revenue across the
US it's eighteen point six
billion in state and local taxes
here due to our State.
in a survey done by the U. S.
chamber small business group the
survey small businesses seventy
six percent of the businesses
said the a criminal has
threatened the use of a weapon
against one of their team
members seventy six percent.
Forty percent of asset
protection manager said in that
organized retail criminal has
used a weapon to harm an
associate says forty percent of
businesses seeing that.
I could be a mesa could be
and I think could be a punch
forty six percent of small
businesses.
I've said they had to increase
their prices due to shoplifting.
We at the the New Mexico chamber
poll released a poll last week
and we asked New Mexicans have
you witnessed shoplifting I
personally the last year forty
percent said they at that's a
lot of people being involved
directly with crime and when you
pair that with the threat of
violence that becomes a very
dangerous situation for our
communities.
And I I think sometimes we we
think about the role that that
shoplifting plays where this for
the broader context of organized
crime and we think about
somebody stealing a drill or
somebody stealing of some
clothes but there's other things
that are stolen and one of the
highest propensity things that
are still is baby formula.
And the thing about when you
still baby formula and your it's
not stored correctly or they
changed the date on it when it
expires and then resell it or
sell it overseas.
What happens is that baby
formula is not stored correctly
loses its tremendous nutritional
value.
And that child is literally
starving while being fat.
And it it is a very big problem
when you start to think about
these different types of crimes
that are associated with in this
context there's other types of
consequences that we have to be
a aware of so with that I I do
want to acknowledge before I
turn the Mike over the
leadership of Representative
reading on this issue it's it's
continued partnership with the
business community a deep
respect for his efforts and and
I want to acknowledge that
today.
Thank you.
Madam chair.
Representative thank you for
this opportunity speak to this
afternoon.
A couple years ago more Keller
initiated what was called the
metric crime initiative MCI.
And this is the second year of
it and the goal of it was to
work with all of the community
stakeholders and the
the partners such as the courts
match record District Court the
public defender's office
district district attorney's
office the county.
And the goal was to look for
something that could take effect
immediately and make a
difference immediately.
And this second year of it this
is one of the issues that has
risen to the top this issue that
we're talking about this
afternoon.
It can make an immediate
difference and what it can do to
is very accountability to the
system
One of the things that I think
is important is.
The backbone of our community is
small businesses.
These are all our friends these
are all our family members these
are the people we know who live
next to us our neighbors.
And as assistant Attorney
General so Solomon to stated
people should not have to be
scared to go to work or to live
in the community.
And with that said the City of
Albuquerque New the Albuquerque
police department support this
legislation and we're grateful
to be part of this effort this
afternoon.
I'm sure we will now stand for
questions.
Introduce or.
Anybody in the.
Representative Nibert.

state of New Mexico ready
Mexicans.
Shop every twelve dollars means
that our communities we have for
the family you our workers
retail establishments and so we
certainly understand the concern
I have right here give rise to
the bill and we also have
concerns.
So much of the behavior that is
covered here in the morning why
is the states that we go through
research and human experience
that enhances.
It is.
Act determines.
Seconds we share the concerns
that were raised in the.
The constitution protects
against.
Maybe most significantly we
always opposed furthering and
deepening the cycles of
criminalization and
incarceration I will always
return leisure to invest care
and support for communities that
address the root causes thank
you for your time.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee this legislative.
Respectively.
We appreciate.
Sanchez and the efforts of all
of you to make the state of New
Mexico as they replace however
our community which is made up
of several hundred attorney
state does have concerns of the
expansion of robbery the double
jeopardy issues our top concern
your office will impact reports
visiting the addresses house at.
Acting on a robbery thank you
all justice and also expands on
the double jeopardy issues that
we.
Lastly it is a well known that
much of what is stolen is resold
online regulated online market
places I believe that we need to
used in this based on current
federal government to address
marketplaces to ensure the
effective change we appreciate
the work.
On certainly home to engage and
this bill is forcing you to
watch out some of those.
Because.
The two thousand.
Why.
Terry called.
Good afternoon madam chair and
members of the committee I'm
gonna try to do this one without
barking dogs I certainly
apologize for that earlier
madam chair and members of the
committee I'm Terry Cole with
the greater Albuquerque chamber
of commerce we believe this
legislation strengthens our laws
against robbery and makes it
easier to prosecute organized
retail crime we support H. B.
two thirty four make no mistake
the serial aggressive retail
thieves do this because I don't
believe there will be
consequences for their actions
understandably no one stopped
him at the stores and it's
really hard for police to catch
them after the fact that's why
when they are caught they can't
simply be given a slap on the
wrist they're dangerous
repetitive lawbreaking should be
met with felony level charges
prosecutors must be allowed to
charge someone for reach help
that based on the aggravated
value of what they steal over a
period of time it's the only way
we're going to stop this
dangerous repetitive behavior
this bill moves things in the
right direction so we think the
pureed of aggregation should be
longer than ninety days and
asked for that to be increased
we urge your support thank you
madam chair members of the
committee.
Mark Peralta.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee my name
is mark Peralta Silva I'm here
on behalf of the law offices of
the public defender on behalf of
the LA Katie we respectfully
oppose this proposed legislation
we primarily rely on the earlier
statements of the guard to house
bill fifty five
but also those statements and
analysis such provided an FIR I
do want to highlight two things
specifically the robbery
amendment it's not limited to
the use of a firearm next it
also includes threat Indians so
in thinking about Representative
rings example of stealing a loaf
of bread committee child
additional of bread and as
leaving wave a pocket knife and
I could constitute
of robbery under the statute
this proposed amendment a second
we we would argue that section
three the definition of
organized retail crime is
effectively a specific form of
racketeering and as such is
likely to lead to extensive
litigation as it seems redundant
to also include
organized retail crime as a
definition of racketeering
activity I'm under the existing
racketeering statute
your spectacles of legislation
and thank you for your comments
madam chair.
Nico Stallis.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Nico
Stallis
is captured in the public
defender analysis as well as
stated by an agency Rikki Lee my
biggest concern is the expanded
definition now the constitute
robbery just by simply inserting
the word for in line twenty
three which is or to affect an
escape from the scene of a theft
we are lowering the front for a
threshold now what would be
considered robbery my biggest
concern with that is robbery is
one of the offenses listed in
the children's code which could
allow a juvenile between the
ages of fourteen and eighteen to
be charged as an adult so now we
are using a lower standard on
which would have those the same
possible consequences for the
charge of robbery so for that
reason I am in opposition to
this bill and thank you for this
time.
Bill Lee.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is bill
way president and CEO of the
Gallatin county chamber of
commerce I would think
Representative Matthews who
worked with New Mexico chamber
the business community the
Attorney General and law
enforcement partners with their
working drafting this bill H. B.
two thirty four is essential to
improving safety of business
owners employees and the public
the organized retail crime that
is right in our state is not
combined urban areas in rural
Gallup McKinley county and we
are having to deal with the
impact of organized retail crime
organized retail crime which
currently mostly goes a this is
not only devastating to our
local businesses but contributes
to crime on the streets where
those who rob it's there's going
goods in exchange for drugs
which fuels even more violent
bad behavior our businesses
struggle everyday with
increasing high cost workforce
and supply chain issues
organized retail crime
negatively influences each of
the struggles with higher costs
of goods are stolen retailers
when higher cost of goods are
stolen retailers either already
next very narrow profit margins
evaporate it is difficult enough
to fully staff of business today
people want to feel safe in the
workplace operators organized
retail crime rings are becoming
more and more brazen with a
propensity toward violence due
to weak laws and little if any
prosecution employees are often
threatened or worse by these
criminals rightly so people are
afraid to work in this
environment I businesses already
struggle to keep goods on their
shelves and customers the those
losses and large scale levels of
organized retail crime creates
only exacerbates problems it is
for these reasons that we
support H. B. two thirty four
and ask members of the committee
to do the same thank you madam
chair.
So.
Madam chair representative I
want to thank first.
This bill I've talked to
retailers and small business
across my district my state.
schools have just it.
Repeat offenders sensefly thank
you we have to do something
actually I just two quick
questions what we're about Mr
Martinez the previous presenter
had said something I've never
heard before that is no longer
state for misdemeanor
shoplifting is that.
Second question if that is true.
so I feel like standing up.
From the court tribunal
Madam chairwoman of
representatives Representative
Hernandez.
I have to be careful in
answering that question since I
was US attorney they implemented
the consent decree I am walled
off from that part in the police
department.
Respectfully if I understood
Representative Rehm say I
understood him to say that
the Clinton consent decree was
wrapped into the
APD matter the the consent
decree since I was US attorney
at that point I think let me
just say that that's not my
memory.
That works
My next question is going to.
Okay.
madam chair.
Senate
On page three one fifteen it
says if an individual commits
more than one shoplifting at
that so my only concern.
Is.
We're not trying to go after
people were just trying to make
ends.
I understand that we need to.
That that that would suggest
not.
Yes.
But NASA.
Family or and it steals forty
dollars worth of groceries over
twelve weeks that would.
Make that would be five hundred
dollars
or more and would make them
updates
be charged with a.
It's where's the two fifty so
that's.
Over five hundred dollars for
challenging I know that's not T.
is.
Do is want to do that
particularly those two days we
might be running into that work.
I can't think of so I don't I
don't know that I need a
response I just kind of put
that.
Might be an issue as long as
well but I am very very support.
Thank you.
Representative Representative
luncheon.
Thank you madam chair will.
thank you Representative
Matthews for for being in this
bill I also want to acknowledge
and recognize the Representative
read the reading the bill
previous to this cause is
working as efforts to make our
streets safer it should go up or
recognize because I think he's
offered him self service as a
police officer than this uses
ServiceNow provided to work to
do and that and you know at this
point time I want to try to keep
my comments more related to
commerce and economic
development since that is that
this committee but and I try to
stay with them for the judicial
aspect of it all but at the same
time
There's a point in regards to
how we can react to to criminal
activity within our communities
within our state regardless of
where you live it's in downtown
Albuquerque urban settings of
its rural New Mexico we have to
be able to respond in some way
so I imagine that in looking at
your your team Representative
Matthews and Madam chair
when I was in that these that
this is not a knee jerk reaction
type of response that this is
your team has created a
calculated strategic effort
mindful of the ifs ands or buts
related to how we begin to
create proactive measures to
affect better changes making our
streets safer making our small
businesses large businesses
businesses in general state was
that our our our people can go
shopping at the state our our or
those that work there can go to
work and feel safe as well and
so this body was come together
and and really take bold actions
we talk about issues like this
and regardless of if you're a
Democrat or Republican at this
point in time we obviously over
to the people of New Mexico to
ensure that their safety is
number one and that those
businesses related to this
discussion
can can can survive and that
their employees can also go to
work feeling free of their
potential risk of putting their
lives into danger and so we owe
that to them and to their
families.
My concern further into this
discussion is that I represent a
lot of the more rural aspects of
New Mexico so this is obviously
these issues are not bit in
nature right and we realize that
in our small communities I
represent the total Bernalillo
and we have a number of small
businesses there and and and and
I know I know it's there already
we're not having the and I hope
we never do have the violent
crimes and and force our our
business owners to make harsh
and rash decisions or decisions
based on those crimes but I want
to make sure that we can be more
relaxed because in essence I
feel like in many cases the
crime is coming to us and we're
sitting ducks more rural aspects
of of New Mexico and I don't
want that to be the case and so
I want to want to commend you.
Representative Matthews for your
take on this I want to commend
you thirteen regards to you
being able to come together to
create sound legislation and
obviously it's going to go to
another community chop it up but
at least at this point in time I
can appreciate where you're at
in this process but I also would
also mentioned in regards to the
fiscal impact reports that we
have.
And you know what what the first
things I I look at is is the
cost because it's going to cost
us a lot of money to do this or
or or or
The folks in in detail and and I
recognize there's a cost of and
I recognize maybe that's the
top of the state that we should
use those types of barriers to.
Create this this image that is
going to cost too much so we
should just keep the status quo
and keep things as they are now
it's very our our our business
owners I don't think it's better
our public so that being said
madam chair representative once
again thank you for your bill.
Thank you Representative Jack
and.
Thank you madam chair
Representative thank you for
bringing this forward the last
thing that any.
Business be at mom and pop for
Walmart wants is to not have the
employees that they need and not
have not be able to open the
door the next day when this
continues manager I'd like to
tell stories I could I said
hello was in Walmart and
she noticed the older.
Reader is what what our caller
noted reader was trying to get
an individual that had their car
piled high with meat and seafood
trying to leave the store.
If this bill would have been in
the fact that would have been a
felony because there's a whole
lot of food and to date it would
be a felony with one offense.
So I.
I agree with where we're going
with this thank you thank you
madam chair.
Representative Lundstrom.
Thank you madam chair moved to
pass.
The whole that motion for just a
minute Representative
Representative Serrato yes the
amendment to and thank you
Representative rings for one of
the things that was mentioned in
the FIR was a concern that the
title was not accurate and I
know we've we've made an
agreement to be able to make
simple changes what possible so
if if this fits that bill Madam
I would like to the motion to
amend the bill on page one the
line eleven after the second
semi colon adding
amending the elements of
shoplifting semicolon so that it
would read it line eleven we
read relating to crime cynical
and amending the elements of
robbery semicolon amending the
elements of shoplifting cynical
and creating the crime of
organized retail crime etcetera
etcetera.
That is just so that it is a
constitutional and fits within.
Representative is is that.
From the moment.
Madam chair yes this is a
friendly amendment and I talked
to the drafter after we and in I
think it was in the FIR with of
the analysis indicated that had
been inadvertently left out and
we need to do that absolutely.
We can
we can live to amend the bill.
Representative an enormous yes.
Representative Duncan yes.
Representative Hernandez yes.
Senator elected yes.
Representative little yes.
Representative Lundstrom.
Yes Representative Martinez yes.
Senator Mason.
Representative Matthews yes.
I share Serrato yes.
Madam chair guy goes yes.
At the S. R. ten those are.
Got amended bill and so I will
now take that position
Representative Lundstrom Mexican
food you pass as amended.
College.
Well that once again
Representative.
That's.
Yes thank you madam chair all be
very brief on questions
Madam chair representative
Matthews thank you for sampling
of all fourteen.
To put this together on.
As with house bill fifty five I
believe that there are small
businesses are on the state that
are cheering you on.
as well as everybody up here.
I have just a couple of quick
questions are one to kind of
satisfy my curiosity on page
three line sixty.
You talk about.
shoplifting offence within a
period of ninety days.
Y. nine Y. just ninety days.
And madam chair Representative
Martinez I'd like to defer to
Sean Sullivan one of my experts
to explain that time limit.
It's just already.
Yes Madam chair representative
thank you there's a couple
reasons for the ninety days one
of which Representative Matthews
noted in her introductory
remarks is that it's simply a
more targeted approach it
doesn't cast such a wide net to
include some of those those
individuals that I think nobody
here is interested in and really
harshly prosecuting which of
those those people are trying to
simply feed their families one
off shoplifting here one off
shoplifting there when you
restrict that time limit to
ninety days to really not
capturing any of those folks so
it's a more targeted approach to
individual offenders the second
reason is you have to take into
account some of the
jurisdictional issues in in
these courts for example in the
Bernalillo county metropolitan
court most cases have to be
completely resolved within six
months and so if you have a
period of a year to work with if
you pick up a misdemeanor
shoplifting on months number one
you're not going to be able to
aggregate a shoplifting in month
number nine because crime number
one will necessarily have had to
be resolved within six months
and so ninety days is less than
that jurisdictional time limit
and recognizes some of those
options.
And madam chair I I would add to
that Representative Martinez is
that that time limit also
applies to the mentor to the
metro at a restaurant the
magistrate courts throughout the
state and they are operate on a
much smaller twin women shorter
time limit in terms of
misdemeanors.
Representative Matthews thank
you for that explanation it it
satisfies my curiosity
Representative Lente made a very
good point in that we see here
in this committee deal with
commerce
The cost to society is a lot
more than what is just simply
reflected in the FY are.
We need to do something and I
agree with Representative Lente
that we this is a challenge for
us to be proactive.
Instead of reactive and shooting
from the hip because that's when
you make mistakes Madam chair
representative
once again I apologize for
bringing this forward and I urge
my colleagues to move this on.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
Yes.
Representative and in order.
Representative Duncan yes.
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lente yes.
Representative little this.
Representative Lundstrom yes.
Representative Martinez yes.
Representative Mason.
Representative Matthews yes by
share Serrato yes I yes it looks
limited.
Madam chair guy goes yes.
Madam chair the test is our line
and he knows ours or.
Happen.
Yes Representative is
Representative thank you madam
chair when the hearing for the
bill I.
I thought I heard a lot of
comments that had sincere
concerns as we saw on the FY in
a few other with others there
are concerns from multiple
agencies about double jeopardy
about how this would apply to
kids or people who would still
airpods are two fifty there are
you know very rapidly that can
be increased.
And but however this is an
urgent need in our community we
have sixty day session I don't
wanna keep holding a heart
issues I do like a bill of all
but I do want to mention that
that does bring me concerned I
wanted to express that to.
Thank you.
Thank you madam chair thank you
members of the committee and I
don't do it this is.
Isn't it right.
They can dial Act or have a
dialogue.
It.
Thank you.
Quickly we have one last bill to
hear.
Representatives of fancy weed
that has House Bill Gates
welcome back to converse thank
you madam chair.
And I.
Is really pleased to bring this
bill back before you.
And
we.
A bill to establish a creative
industry division I do have my
expert witness Mr breeder Pratt
with me and who has it arts
consulting firm an extensive
experience in economic
development in the arts and we
do have an amendment thanks to
be very helpful feedback of the
committee we have prepared this
amendment to address some of the
concerns madam chair I I hope
you have that admitted.
I move amendment two two four
six four zero point for for
discussions.
Thank you madam chair thank you
explain the amendment thank you
so what the amendment does is
two things primarily one is it
really clarifies the
intersection with film and makes
it clear that film is not
included in the creative
industry division because we
already have a very robust Film
Office and program and economic
development and then secondly
it also clarifies that that this
bill is not about tourism so
again just sort of re focusing
on economic development I'm in
and making it clear that the
overlap with tourism hi it is
not is was not the intention of
the bill and is no longer
included.
Is that.
Thank you Representative is that
the extent of your amendment
that's correct madam chair.
Do we have any
Comments or questions from the
committee regarding the
amendment.
Pass on the amendment.
Okay I'm sorry.
The the late so
madam chair with and and and
Representative so if.
I mean Madam when you presented
this the first time.
Of course they're not an issue
that those I regards to the
reoccurring.
Appropriations discussion
operation of the I.
This was going I thought I was
gonna be with that are you know
yeah
Thank you madam chair and
chairman Lente
we did does it extensively with
both Legislative Council Service
and legislative finance
committee staff on the
appropriation language they
confirmed that the appropriation
of language was drafted
correctly and that this is
drafted as it is non recurring
the FIR language I believe is
also been corrected I don't know
if you have the updated FY are
and there but
State we explained to the
concerns of the committee to the
drafters as well as to LFC and
they were unable to recommend
any changes to us on this
language.
That I'm sure we can speak on
that please.
I did actually went back and
looked at it more than a dozen
bills that were non reoccurring
and they all were almost
identical to of the
Representative is built on and
speaking with the drafter of the
Legisla- of the the FIR she had
clarified that in it and I think
you look at my email to pull up
that language on that or that
fire that's on the website if
you like I can I can pull that
out if that helps the committee
representative there are updated
FIR in our books.
Thank you as of yesterday they
can yes for two as well
Representative and it's got to
be there that it that it is
nonrecurring for because it is
that these funds.
They may want to later but it is
which is requesting what is the
bill requesting additional
records I apologize for this
being put to that thank you.
Thank you for allowing us the
question I.
But that's what we had
discussions and I work with
kids.
Does anybody else have any
questions on the act.
Representative Martinez of
course.
I'm just very curious.
Madam chair representative thank
you.
For the opportunity to ask the
question that's right.
Well since we last heard this
bill so on the amendments to
choose what agencies to clarify
because in the first FY are
there was some opposition from.
Tourism.
What was that.
How you came to your amendment
Madam chair representative thank
you madam chair and
representative Martinez we did
have a long meeting with the
secretary of tourism
and discussed some of the
services that are provided by
the tourism department verses
the Services being outlined in
this bill and the program
and we also visited we then
convened at the statewide group
that has been working on this
legislation from around the
state and the feeling was
overwhelmingly that although the
programs in the created by this
division will certainly enhance
tourism all certainly create a
trough for you know more people
to come and visit state and at a
newly renovated studio to see an
artist creating their work
it's not the focus of this bill
to enhance torrez and the focus
of this careless to really
enhance the economy and the work
force related to creative
industries.
Thank you madam chair
representative that was.
That was my only question on
this one thank you
Representative representative
Duncan.
Thank you madam chair
thank you the only concern I
have is the cost so the if I
could madam chair I'd like to
talk about some stature that I
have Colorado has five point
eight million people Arizona has
seven point two million people
Utah has three point three
million people Mexico is two
point one.
Read about.
Budgets for their arch what this
would be is Colorado sixty five
million Arizona five million
Utah five hundred twenty
thousand New Mexico five sixty
five million.
That's my are right there if you
could tell me for a certainty
that this is going to bring us
two hundred million next year
Probably jump all over but
that's my concern.
Thank you madam chair.
There is going to present madam
chair and representative Duncan
I wish we had that crystal ball
to be able to totally predict
that revenue
the Colorado program right now
there's there were two bills
actually passed for the Colorado
programs so the sum total of
Colorado's funding is a hundred
and seven million dollars but I
love to defer to my expert
witness if I may to talk about
how that sixty five million
number where that came from.
Representative could you
introduce you and yes yes madam
chair this is Mr Greenough Pratt
who is has an arts consulting
firm
but she's also had twenty seven
years of experience in
government working on economic
development arts and culture.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee and
thank you Representative for
your question
This we're we're in a new
territory there are many states
that have done this our neighbor
to the north Colorado has done
this great infusion and so we've
been really paying attention to
that and we did a small survey
this group called the creative
industry consortium of and had
sixteen organizations come
forward with what they said were
pretty much shovel ready
projects that total thirty three
million so we thought well with
Colorado being at a hundred and
seven that thirty three million
Available in just a
appropriations service in Mike
is a really a lot of need in New
Mexico.
And
in our.
Research which we've done over
the course of the past year plus
we find that there are lots of
small museums for example across
the state that need some capital
to take care of building
problems there are lots of small
business people who could stand
to have some.
Training so we expect some of
the money to go toward that.
There are college programs such
as the.
Program at highlands one eight
U. N. M. that's bringing
together the hand in the machine
under action Peter science
Other other and the institutions
that are offering various kinds
of training programs that we
think could be supported and
could bring together to really
make money flow
when we were discussing what the
bill was really all about I
think it's it's coming down to
this is an opportunity where we
have scattered people working
in the far reaches of the state
who could be brought together
with resources that could be
given ideas about how to create
a business like.
this is Judy tile down and
Silvercity that
Is a thriving business in and
brings
New Mexico's creativity out
and around the world
so.
So we think that money could be
spent we know that it's a once
in a lifetime opportunity that
the state has money to spend and
we want to grab a hold of it
because.
Of the fact that we have so many
creative people with these deep
deep roots of heritage history
that comes out in a way that can
benefit people the way they make
their livings on how they
support their families
it just seems like it's a time
when all that could be knit
together by this
Division.
And we could really left the
state up with the new industries
that right now it's just kind of
scattered and not paid attention
to in a focused way.
So we're very hopeful that if
sixty five million or something
like that could be appropriated
that it would really affect our
state in a way that is
Katelin catalytic to make a lot
of things growth.
Thank you do you have any other
questions.
Thank you madam chair I I do not
I was I thought there might be
question about construction in
this bill and I was trying to
find a better.
Representative Lente.
We already passively and right
now we're on the we have not had
any and okay I just like to make
a.
We have a second.
But.
Representative and in order to
yes the amendment Representative
docket yes.
Representative Hernandez yes
Representative Lente yes.
Representative little yes.
Representative Lundstrom.
Representative Martinez yes
Representative Mason.
Representative Matthews yes.
Vice chair Serrato yes the
amendment madam chair yes madam
chair the S. S. R. nine those
are zero at the end of bills.
Do we have any other comments
from the committee regarding the
bill.
Representative Lente thank you
madam chair I know it's five
o'clock in funding but
I just read it we really
appreciate you of that with for
for for for bring this before us
I don't but a lot of money right
and and my focus is on regarding
my district that Representative
right and and I represent a
large portion of native American
Mexico and and knowing that in
many cases the people I
represent are the original
creative industry in the state
of New Mexico yet I still see
that
sitting at the plaza and the
jewelry or going this stuff is
here so that you are creating
pots are arts and crafts or to
to to the point of the the
individual you you've
commissioned to create your
poster require a date and how we
should be able to branch out
with this up without
reservations cartoon industry
I'm really hopeful that this
type of a department will be
able to focus in on providing
the know how to those of us
disenfranchised communities that
have a lot of these individuals
within that to really bring them
up to a point where
they they they they don't have
to always feel like they can.
They have to go to the buyers
but the bison then regards to be
able to utilize more of a of of
a internet focus to cyberspace
focus market place that can
provide for the weeds because at
this point they've been able to
survive centuries doing what
they do right but if you can
find this type of industry and
the support of the nose would
like it to I appreciate that
thank you Mr thank you for your
comments Representative
Matthews.
Thank you madam chair
At.
Representative I'm impressed by
this idea also.
My my question.
It's just it is sort of goes
along with what Representative
Lente was saying
Time to serve in my mind
envision sixty five million
dollars how.
That might be divided into
requests.
And I'm just wondering if you
all have launching your own mind
as to sort of what these
projects.
What the range of requests might
be.
How many it and but what what
kinds of creative work about.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative Matthews you know
I think
What is the first tasks of this
division is going to be to do
that type of planning
and.
Even in the survey that was done
amongst a lot of the arts
council's that exist around the
state
this sixteen projects range
tremendously and size and also
between capital infrastructure
and training and support for
entrepreneurs
we have men and number of
practitioners in the creative
industry through the process of
developing this bill and so at
it's everything from you know
artist in Gallup wanting to
develop a shared studio Roger
print oriel space where artists
could receive business training
artists could receive mentorship
and that learning how to advance
an intern there the things that
they do in the evenings after
work into a full time job all
the way to
you know larger scale capital
improvement projects that could
include for example workforce
housing training shared
makerspaces shared three D.
printer
given the example and foundry in
Santa Fe they closed and all of
that business now going to
Colorado so all of metal artists
that depended on that mountain
before
for their production all of that
is Colorado is is actually
having representatives of their
businesses come to Santa Fe pick
up all of the molds drive to
Mexico.
so that's something that's right
for like a public private
partnership to create a foundry
like that so that we would have
that resource here again so I
think it it ranges and obviously
the capital projects are the
more expensive projects.
Thank you madam chair and up.
Representative just.
I was approached by a group in
Albuquerque that wants to.
Build a business that would
create two sets for operators
and I theater performances is
what that's the kind of thing
you're I mean this could
potentially benefit organization
like that Madam chair
representative Matthews
absolutely.
Thank you so much for bringing
this bill.
Representative Hernandez.
From this.
Madam chair representative okay
so.
As my colleagues of efforts at
sixty five million dollars.
Total sport about this I will
she is fantastic
So when you get to HSD maxed.
In give you.
Twenty it is that we still get
this program going with that.
Madam chair representative
Hernandez absolutely I think
what can look at the outdoor
recreation division as an
example that was funded very
small price tag to start and now
has a multi million dollar
budget that is doing great
making all over the state and
