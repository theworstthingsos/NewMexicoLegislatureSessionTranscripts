Chairman linter is out
talking.
But until he does.
But.
It's going to start.
I'm a representative.
So.
Could have to ma.
Yeah.
The.
Madame chair jimmy mice and.
The.
I'd be back to.
Madame chairman.
Former republican for f.
Did they call and reinforcements
that was
very good
so
we also.
I think it's a little bit big
and where it is.
We'll try that.
But.
With that i'm in a past the gall
over to our right here linda
cerato.
Thank you madame chair thank you
the committee a couple things
that want to go on our tests
just so everyone knows I kind of
categorize them into three four
sections but I thought it would
be useful for the members of
this committee to have an idea
of what the work for solutions
department is putting out about.
So ultra with we have the twenty
twenty three small business
profile you could see some of
the trend lines and what are the
areas we're seen some growth i'd
also like to point out the much
thicker
twenty twenty three state of the
work force on this is probably
when my favorite little guys to
go through because I think you
staff for putting this in color
it really allows you to get a
good idea where workers are.
How will we comparing on and the
tldr of this is that we're
looking better and.
I've also included in the longer
end of it it's the power and
collaborate it's about three
years old two and a half years
old now it's our strategic pla.
The actual street is much the
gr.
But this is a good
understanding of the investments
that the governor has been
looking at where she sees growth
you know where the executive
branches looking at this
opportunities in consulta.
So those are like the long
standing larger documents i'd
also like to point you to two
smaller ones that are equally
important or quarter summary
from last quarter.
Again looking at.
And then the november twenty
twent.
Some of this is similar to what
you'll find force but it is
again the most recent look at
what's happening in our in our.
I want to make sure you'll sell
finally there's two last pieces
on that I didn't want to point
out
that obviously I think a lot of
us talk about leader and g.
Leader supports.
Funding directly towards getting
growth
and so what these two are the
leader what is a bit smaller and
shape with no less impactful
show you were so worried
recently funds have been going
and what that impact is on the
average salary.
A lot of these will be familiar
to you
are and then finally j tip again
is looking at how many gt
trainees have been affected by
the program are it looks like
right after twenty three so that
would.
Um.
You know yes so this is so this
is a good
and what you were major industry
driving job driving programs are
doing interstate you know I
think I know I definitely to
prove these when I get a chance
they're pretty easy to read
through but I encourage my
colleagues to take a peek and
really use that as we're
looking.
If there's any I don't think
there's a question i'm
connecting.
I was just wondering.
You know what i'm gonna send.
With that if alex.
And he is the economic.
And so I thought that would be
great for all of us if you could
give us a you know quick
overview of w.
Great thank you for having madam
chair met.
I just want to go over a few
quick economic development
related.
Offers I want to get back on
what matter by share was
mentioning about lita and jason.
Yeah.
The.
First the clean car income tax
credit it's you can be he want
forty which is filed
it largely is somewhere to last
years and i'll be happy to
answer any follow up.
Attached credi.
Tax credit for the production
sale of certain com.
Incentivised.
Us the investment council new
mexico private equity investment
program.
The budget and.
Budget impacts.
Electronic vehicles.
It will be less.
I'm sure.
Be allocated towards new mexico
private equity invest.
To.
Alex.
Yeah.
Matthews manager the exact
recommendati.
Yeah.
And then one of the question.
One of these I was working on
the summer.
Was the possibility
of very very expensive there.
I was working with some.
The.
Tax credits that would go to low
income people tied.
In an effort to try to be able
to
encourage these folks.
I'm wondering.
Seventeen million is that do you
have any idea what the tax
credit how much of a tax credit
they're looking at.
Arizona matthews medicine I
believe the top credit for eves
would be three thousand dollars
credit.
Thank you a man chair.
I'm just concerned that three
thous.
Probably not going to.
It's just.
Which I bothered me in the past
about these tax credi.
Represent matthews manager if I
made the the
msrp
and for order for an even to
qualify has to be under fifty
five thousand dollars or under
it so to your point it w.
Thank you representative just
briefly clarifying point europe
when you're saying that
there's not funding through
listed or due to per leader are
you talking about an increased
funding or literally those line
items are not including the
budget metal by share manager my
understanding is that the l c
recommendation had zero dollars
and both leader jason thank you
for the clarification
representative martinez.
Thanks for matter whistler.
You talked about term.
Encouraging the.
Represented my teenagers manager
of leave the current languages
climate technologies
and in or they encouraged where
they mandated to invest in those
areas resident martinez manager
the the new structure of the
legislation still being worked
on but it would.
I
they need it with a new
legislation two percent of the
current eleven percent
allocation would not be
necessarily devoted towards
funds that either have specialty
and climb the technologies or a
climate technologies one of
their stuff specialties take a a
venture capital fund like costla
who with the state investment
council invested in last year
they have climbed technology as
well as another several other
technology classes that they
investment and so as long as
climate technology was a part of
the funds these are not make
them eligible and you said that
the the.
Remember seen as many chaired
the the I believe two percent of
the severance taxpaying a
current market value.
Whether the questions.
Thank you mr inward coming and
blending and there's other
questions i'm sure we can find
you thank you manager
and I will hand it back to.
So before we get too far down
the road I wanted to make sure
to introduce one of the most
important people to are
committing patrick please yeah I
I went a different direction to
say I apologize for that.
My name's patrick and the
committee assistant uh to madame
chair and this is my second year
any communication or request
that you have.
Thank you and he is the one that
is getting the snacks for
everybody so you he is the one
that we need to be nice
reason that he brings in the
lots of lots of snacks though we
we do appreciate that
on a more serious not I want to
make sure that for our committee
that we
I think the last year we did a
really good job of
working well together and I
really want to continue that
momentum with all of the members
I want is to have transparency I
want us to be fair.
I wanted to respect each other
and respect the public.
You know I I think we can agree
to disagree but I don't want us
to be disagreeable
we also need to be conscious of
the of the time I think that
many times we start late because
of you know we get off the floor
late it's a thirty day session
and you know things have to move
pretty quickly and so I think
respecting the public's time
because they're here waiting
many times so want us to be real
conscious of that so.
One of the big things i'm hoping
to really to stick to is
starting on top
and I know what I think we're
gonna say is one thirty or
fifteen minutes after we get off
our session so that way
especially once things get move
and we know that you need to be
here so if that would be
good also with amendments that
we want to do it that we need to
make sure that they're in twenty
four hours I had a time so
everybody has a time has time to
review to look at that and we're
prepared to ask questions on
those amendments I know as the
the time gets very short though
last week we moved faster and
what course will make those
adjustments but until we get to
that point and we make that
announcement
to that so everybody has
adequate time to to look at that
is you on your desk there is
already.
We already have three bills or
four bills for bills scheduled
for wednesday and so if you guys
could make sure to look through
those bills so we can get to
quickly
okay patrick is telling me that
the agenda's happening email so
if you guys are not getting any
particular emails please let
patrick know
i'm not the person to let no
because I don't have anything to
do is but patrick will take care
of you if if especially if you
need to do a substitution on the
bill please let patrick know
because then we do need to look
at doing the analysis.
Our team is prepared in that
right in that respect
that's.
Those remind notes
I just want us to keep running
really really smoothly
I know this is quickly but we
already have our committee
dinner someone make sure that
the staff is included
please make it we appreciate you
and we don't want it to get too
far down
the road with the thirty day
means so quick
we do have lots of people that
are wanting to come and
celebrate your staff and so last
year we made the the coyoty dan
this year it's across the street
it is still the coyote cafe
is just a bigger meeting
location so if you get last you
can text us or check patrick and
he will tell you how to go get
how to get there but please
especially for our staff we
really want to there so
appreciate the hard job that you
do towards the end sometimes we
don't always slow down and to
say that so we're gonna say that
that so with that does anybody
else in the community have
anything to add.
Representative matthews yes
manager would be possible and
this has happened occurred in.
Is the senate an email with the
staff's name and posi.
We need to follow up with.
I appreciate the introductions
but I have a very poor memory.
Yeah.
Represent we will get that out
to you and in fact we'll send a
via email but also get a hard
copy for everybody on the
committee that way you can just
have it if you
will get our folders go into
once those are out you can just
have it on your folder and can
refer to that anybody else.
Yeah.
Think about insurance thank you
fellow colleagues on the
committee I did want to take a
moment in the spirit of
friendship and you know clear
working together I just want to
encourage
you know the different chambers
in the various parties when
they're working on bills that we
are involved with please take
our invitations to discuss these
bills i'd have productive in
fruitful ways that we can serve
our populous as we can see these
documents we've seen some some
bright times right now and I
think we want to see that in as
many communities as possible and
making sure that spreads and so
on you know as many of you know
we're gonna be discussing a lot
of things and you know both
myself and you know represent a
matthews are bringing forward
he'd family medical leave
options and again I want to
extend you know and open
invitation to conversations
you know we have distributed
that we have reached out at
times and i've not really seen
all you know all the cheapest
come to the table to have this
conversation so again my door is
open i'm eager to continue these
conversations I just want to
make sure that folks know that
on anything we're working on we
want to make sure.
Representative manager i.
Reiterate what represe.
Any bills and.
Please.
Thank you anybody else.
The.
I will say that
I had not realized that lead up
funds were not in the budget so
I think that that's something
that this this committee I
should have some some harbor
over so we should we should talk
about that and I I will actually
bring that up since some other
leadership to see what we need
to maybe look at doing
you know I think right now there
is money but so many but we need
to also look at building
you know building air mess
because future we want to
continue working at how we're
going to spend that money and I
think working with the business
community working with our
constituents is really important
to everybody on this committee
and so i'm hoping that we can
continue to move forward and
continue to to make good policy
with that
I don't have anything else
unless anybody else does but we
will start like I said either
fifteen minutes after
the four session thirty so we
were we will be telling
representative thank you I did
have a question
not into your dinner is on the
twenty fourth I unfortunately
will not be able to town that is
in conflict with gallop day that
we may.
Anything to eat but.
Are you going to be excused that
evening for this is the
committee going to be excuse you
know we had put it down I will I
will remind leadership about it
and
then I gonna be excused i'm so
no I note is the whole committee
going to be excused to attempt
this that evening i'm hoping
that there is time for that yeah
that's the person that I have
but we will we'll double check
not i'm just curious because.
And I hope you can swing by
would love to see yeah
but.
