To be eligible for the film and
television tax credit and then
we go down to the bottom the
film production company shall
agree in writing.
One two paying all obligations
the film production company has
occurred in New Mexico.
So that's essentially what we
have in our bill it's not
necessary to have it in our bill
because it's already in statute
under the fire protection tax
credit act.
So madam chair.
The fact of the matter is.
When it comes to the trucks.
Of our legislation in terms of
the lack of payment and
conditions and safety
This law is not being enforced
Madam.
Regarding the that that
background actors and why is it
the building enforcement chair.
Well one the film office in the
economic development department
C. background actors has
a marginalized group.
In the film industry.
They see it as a they see this.
Marginalized group as a
disposable workforce after.
They see this group of
background workers as powerless.
And not at the table.
Like the I I see you members.
Or the film actors guild Madam.
And on that there's a not at the
table.
thank I have see more the film
actors guild.
House bill twenty three chair in
the half makes room for the back
on actors at the table.
And how do we enforce the law.
If the film production tax
credit act.
Is not enforced by the economic
Development Department upon
passage of house bill twenty
three.
We do what legislators of done
in the past.
When it comes to violation of
our laws.
Or the constitution.
By the executive branch.
We file.
A court action known as a writ
of mandamus.
What we call for a restraining
order and cease to desist
orders.
And in this case.
Cease and desist order to hold
that all tax credits.
Until all the obligations.
Of the act are met in this case.
Making payments on a timely
manner background actors.
Madam.
And I personally am willing to
be a plaintive.
In that lawsuit if it comes to
that.
because we legislators have
standing.
We wrote this law we created.
The film production tax credit
act so we have let's have.
Expanding when it comes to a
lawsuits especially in
recommending this.
And actually the background
actors that have been affected
would be the the planes.
And I guarantee you madam chair
from passage of house bill
twenty three.
and if this matter goes to court
because of the inaction on the
part of economic development
department.
To make the whole back those tax
credits into low payments are
made obligations are met this
back on actors I guarantee that
we will prevail.
Just like the Legislative
prevailed in terms of a lawsuit
that I have a couple of us filed
against governor Michelle Lujan
Grisham in terms of
specifically.
Creating that division in terms
of that the legislature is The
appropriation body when it comes
to the dispersing a federal
comment relief monies.
And we've done similar actions
in terms of legislators
regarding the the.
The administration of governor
Martinez.
Where we filed a lawsuit against
her in regards to a beetle that
she did.
Regarding removing half of the
language in in the bill.
That dealt with a certain
sector.
And she cannot do.
Governors can that be you know
half of a bill and the the other
bill and have impact you have to
view of the whole thank you you
know end up in another another
action that as legislators to.
Was when the governor Martinez
didn't took an appropriation
bill of four hundred thousand
dollars price that out and put
forty thousand in this place.
The governors do not have
authorizing left already when it
comes to appropriations madam
chair those are just examples.
Second item that you guys ask me
with madam chair.
Was that we wanted to
incorporate the designation of
hiring local cable cable
companies.
When it comes comes to the
disbursement of of wages to the
background workers and I I I
want to take you to I am to be
on the hand up.
And you can see on an item being
the handout.
Well for one minute chair again
you tax me with this.
And what might drafters and
Legislative Council came to the
understanding was that house
bill twenty three is not the
instrument to do this.
If we want to create a
designation of hiring local
payroll companies.
for the disbursement of wages to
background workers we have to do
it in.
This act the film production tax
credit act.
And I highlighted where exactly
this would be done.
And it'll be in this section of
that act.
And all of them and all also
highlight highlighted chair.
At not only that it could come
under the five percent credit.
But it would fall in the round
item two what it says I'm
production with the total New
Mexico budget of the following
amounts provided that the
expenditures are directly
attributable I think to a New
Mexico resident.
Who was hired as industry group
what was hired as a producer
writer director working director
directly with the physical
production and just follow the
New Mexico income tax return as
a resident in the two previous
taxable years.
So if we want to do this and and
I want to do this.
But I can't do it this year I'm
going to come back next year
because next year this will be
germane.
This is a tax bill the film
production tax credit bill is a
tax bill.
Is there a day session tax bills
are to remain.
And I'm gonna come back next
year with the bills that does
exactly that what we designate
with the credit.
That these production companies
bring onboard local payroll
companies.
And madam chair the third item
that you are.
Yes me with.
Well as to strengthen the
flashbacks.
When these are.
Madam chair.
When these bad apples go sour
and start riding.
And
Again has a twenty three is not
the instrument in which to do
that.
Again.
The film production tax credit
act is the place where we want
to strengthen club Act madam
chair.
the fourth item that you to ask
me with.
Was to make and to clarify that
the definition of person.
And I have in the I don't see.
The definition of person for
statutory purposes it's already
in statute.
You could see that includes
every everybody and anybody
including the kitchen sink in
terms of what we mean by person.
So that kind of clarifies that
the fifth yes madam chair was
that you guys.
Some of you guys.
manager wanted the.
To put more what what I refer to
you want to put more saber tooth
tiger type teeth in house bill
twenty three.
And madam chair.
It's not necessary.
The reason I say that it's not
just.
Is because we have the Mexico
the maximum.
Penalties regarding misdemeanors
in this legislation.
That are currently in statute.
And we also have in this section
not only the maximum.
Entities of a misdemeanor but
also we have a cause of action.
Yep the background workers can
pursue in court.
In terms of.
Damages it's at art center.
By the amount.
Court costs lower cost.
That would be part of the of the
payment process that would have
to be paid by a production
company get the background
workers prevailed.
And.
What's in my bill regarding
those penalties and the
processes.
This we're going off of the day
labor act.
In regards to that so this is
already in statute what we have
and what we have with the day
labor act is the highest.
The highest possible.
Means a penalty.
And
are available so
The other thing madam chair is
that we if we beef up.
And.
House bill twenty three to a
greater level of degree that
what's already in statute under
the day labor at and under the
wage act.
Then we're gonna run into some
real constitution of sparks.
If this bill passes because it's
opening a brand new area.
Of constitutionality.
You know and we know that the
day labour Act and the wait
staff that.
Our constitutionally sound.
They're vulnerable to
constitutional challenges.
Madam chair and lastly.
You can ask me with our.
following up again with the
secretary of the work force.
Solutions department I invited
her.
she has taken a position in the
past.
of being supportive of.
The legislation when it comes to
go workforce solutions component
in the bill and that you will do
everything in our power to
basically implement.
What is under her purview in
this legislation and I don't
know she's in the audience.
Representative I I ask those
workforce solutions have the
secretary J. thank you of the
committee really wanted to hear
of what was going on we were as
a committee one eight said to
give a full be
the problem.
And I think it was a question if
this bill was that would be able
to do that and so I'm just
supposed to come up and and also
if they would come up to
the tests that we can hear
everybody and they can be I want
to do as well I wanted side when
you when you are you done with
your chairman of the
presentation that would like to
move your amendment yes please.
Two and eight minutes.
Second.
And will you explain the
tremendous and so we can okay
the first item in my
presentation was the man that
man Jareth that this language is
not needed basically
the question of with only tax
credit until the
until the
The conditions.
Of
are meant by the production
company is already in statute.
So that's what we're doing with
the leading item the
page six.
That's that's essentially what
the amendment is.
Okay so I think we should have
done it.
And then and then talk about
how.
To be able to that this is true
Any yes we'll go to the yeah
this is regarding
Feedback on the amendment only
need for other bills of the
state to the amendment is
anybody is anybody in favor of
the minutes.
Continueing post.
Anyone and CEO.
We'll go with okay and so Sir
would you like to.
I.
I know would here in the and
thank you for the opportunity to
speak today I did find the
commission copy the background
actors up to a rate change in
the draw from the that was
actually developed five six
years ago in collaboration with
connectors Stackhouse or and
with the major stakeholders in
the state
And appreciate the tenor of the
idea behind supporting the
background unity I take
exception to the COVID in the
background who is marginalized
we have all the laws in place
that we need to take care of you
all over time safety conditions
hazardous conditions of those
through the bill of rights this
was the worst I State Farm
office was north by the state
was the worst I both local and
national staff after of
leadership so that is important
support for the background
communities
What we have really is an issue
of enforced and Representative
is absolutely right about that
we have a field offices
overstretch and does does not
have really
happened.
To oversee and two of issues
they have to fire.
To do so so what we really need
to address is that staffing
issues more than put another
of years
of legislation on it may
actually changed companies away
from doing production in New
Mexico the more legislation
makes the less likely they are
to come in here they'll go to
markets like and then she
probably sent that are trying to
make these are working.
Full support for the background
you have worked in this area for
over fifty years and support
them tremendously this bill is
not going to thank you very much
thank you.
Okay good to the committee on
the amendment what's the your
conversation.
That thank you madam chair thank
you Representative for going
back to the drawing board I.
That because of the all is that
this point I don't know what
would be with the bill with the
amendment in regards to the
COVID which is made I mean it
seems to me that.
This is not that we don't we
should be working on the flight
as we have a lot of these things
should be done to develop in the
interim versus trying to do this
here in the public side and and
and and this is the the
embarrassing parts of really
trying to get this right miss it
up and hope to come back next
year get rate again of only do
try to the product push it up I
don't mean that do do do want to
kick the can down the road but
at the same time what it right
the first time please try to our
best to get with the first and
then after this on the fly so
that's my comment that respect
to the sponsored everyone in the
audience thank you.
Representative Mason.
There.
Representative
I'm on the same page pretty much
with Representative let the.
Talk about a lot of.
Last time presented this bill.
And the.
The things that you've put in
here a lot of work here but
they're not in the amendments to
the bill you know at the I still
feel the bill is.
You know I do.
We have looked at each side we
have the laws of what I do have
the walls.
More than four some of.
Project the one thing.
The act we have an address that
I thought we
I know it's of.
Yes and I really don't see them
and they just was the complaints
from employees in the background
with disabilities.
providing facilities.
But different different thank
you all for the purpose of this
label.
Workers in.
In in that and I know we have
laws that are with that are
required for your use of the
Board anybody's four if if it's
Pueblo if you have this ability
the response to provide.
No service at all.
But.
You know what will wheelchairs
sensible but Roose you know
everything assessable bill and I
didn't hear that addressed all
the should I think.
Like this Medicine.
It's still.
Work on the boards with I don't.
Know how we're going to.
We'll wait to hear from our
friends at workforce and you
know on the that's the way I
think nearly everything this
bill makes progress they have
their the rights of side is that
we work for New Mexico has the
rights we need.
With workforce solution with
OSHA coming all rights need I
don't know what we have to do to
address the portion of the.
We have.
I the the background workers in
the.
At the same.
Rights is those that work for me
if I read that story I mean it's
it's great that statute at the
Robin trouble.
You know on in the conversation
even from the federal for.
I don't the.
All time.
They're not bashful about some
of the options are because I've
never had a contract person
thank goodness we tried real
hard is it for years Mike sure
we don't have to say that with
our front door you know and I
would like to see your industry.
The side thank you.
I feel that the I did get one
deal that was gonna.
For that I write it down there.
Terrible my notes here this
morning and ride home every
piece of paper about.
But the.
I've got it all the.
That
And email we receive from the
the the yes the.
There were land claims against
the film industry in fiscal year
twenty twenty to.
And your dad on the.
In the fiscal year twenty twenty
three there's always been fifty
there are ready fifty forty five
of there is a problem.
It also says that.
Right with your these are all
against the side production.
So it the.
But sound like this came from
workforce solutions we raised
our I have a speech about the
amendment to get some faxes.
So it seems like there's they're
they're on the job they're
trying these you know if we need
to.
There's something.
With the the but I don't care.
Representative that's all I have
cited as it sits right now
obviously the changes might be
that much.
Madam chair
I know we're on the amendment
but Representative Mason
mentioned the I think an
important issue that's in the
bill.
If you go to a page I.
I know for we have those
protections in there.
Gather information of
unemployment in the fiscal
manager civility or Sears
medical condition of back on
artists and provide
accommodations appropriate for
such as a lunar conditions
unless such accommodations and
reasonable or and undue hardship
in accordance with the Human
Rights Act again this is part of
that section four back on this
bill of rights and so we've got
those protections in here.
And madam chair in regards to.
The
comments that representative
Lente and many I'm sure this is
the first time this gentleman's
come before our communities or
the gentleman is never brought
his concerns to me as as the
main sponsor of the legislation
you know and so I mean not a
It's not that we're not trying
to kind of of the all inclusive
of which we have.
it just that I think we need to
put things in perspective in
terms of what this committee
kind of task me to do in terms
of kind of moving legislation
forward and that's what that's
why I tended to do but by
addressing those concerns and
how a lot of the concerns of the
committee addressed have nothing
to do with house bill twenty
twenty.
One point of order we seem to be
there's a.
This is requesting four approved
at this ammendment.
And I think we're back to having
presentation by the Sanchez
sorry to interrupt you but we
seem to no matter what it and I
excuse me
and I would move at this point
to table the amendment
until there's a complete.
All of these various issues that
Representative brought up are
put into a single bill.
and I'm just I'm confused about
what we're doing and we seem to
be spending a lot of money and
I'm moving forward still I move
to table the amendment the
secretary of.
The state.
Representative and in order.
Yes table.
Representative docket yes table
yeah Representative David is yes
Representative Lente yes to
Representative little yes
Representative function.
Representative Martinez yes
Representative makes yes the
Bible Representative Matthews
yes to table.
Madam chair.
Madam chair good yes.
Chair of the what is yes.
Okay so the minutes been tabled
I think it's really important at
this point that we hear from
workforce solutions and the
secretary so the committee can
get an overview of of what we.
Additional information so you
all have come up so we can get
you to the right.
Thank you.
Testing testing are we could.
Okay great wonderful thank you
thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Alicia
keys I am the cabinet secretary
of economic development and the
film office is a division within
my cabinets we also have
representatives from OSHA here
and from department of workforce
solutions the economic
development department and the
New Mexico Film Office support
background actors safe
workplaces and the timely
payment of the timely payments
of wages we also support the
background actors bill of rights
that resides on the film
division's website which is a
catch all documents citing the
OSHA standards and also the work
force solutions statute.
We propose HB twenty three it's
problematic in multiple ways the
institutional divisions relevent
to HB twenty three that being
Alicia and WSD have clearly been
left out in coordination and
creation of this language in
this bill as has the Film Office
and my department this is
problematic as these agencies
already enforce the issues
they're being alleged after your
first hearing we did approach
RubyAnn also the representative
to coordinate and they never
returned our phone calls or
emails there has been no
coordination no collaboration
with the Film Office with the
industry with our partners and
with our stakeholders and as you
all saw the other day there's a
lot of coordination there's a
lot of collaboration and there's
a lot of love in this industry
and so
that I think is very problematic
there are also potential
conflicts with SAG AFTRA is
background sona grievance in New
Mexico and issues with regards
to the film industry working in
New Mexico as per statute the
film the film tax credit
legislation currently requires
financial obligations incurred
in the state to be paid before a
production may apply for the
film tax credit the Film Office
currently maintains a database
of claims regarding non or late
payments from cast crew and
business and halts the process
of any film tax credit
application where there are
unresolved claims HB twenty
three creates unique payment
schedules and penalties for
employees of background artist
so compared to other employees
and invest in industry
throughout the state there is
vape vagueness and no definition
around who are which entity
would receive a misdemeanor
charge would it be background
casting directors who hire the
background actors would it be
the employers.
who's the payroll company or the
production company who hires the
payroll company and employs the
background artists on behalf of
the payroll company as the bill
is written up production could
accrue hundreds if not thousands
of misdemeanors with sentencings
and fines for each offense that
the potential decline in retreat
of the film industry in New
Mexico is a very real
possibility if this bill is
passed currently the bill is
redundant it is unfair lacks
researching coordination I will
I will defer to our colleagues
with an ocean also within
workforce solutions to talk
specifically about that but I
think that what I would suggest
is this is an incredibly
important
of the bill that we have here
incredibly important issues but
as representative Lente said I
really do believe that we need
the time we need data that we
need to figure out where this is
happening how it's happening is
that one production is that lots
of productions and so I would
request that we table this until
interim and can actually work
collaboratively to find
something of to find a solution
that is really good for all of
the people that are involved in
background talent within the
state thank you.
Thank you Secretary.
Sir would you like to make a
statement.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee I'm
Robert general and chief of the
environment department's
occupational health and safety
bureau OSHA and I'm here on
behalf of Environment apartment
and secretary James Kenney to to
pose this bill eight HB twenty
three the a portion of the bill
that we propose is the language
that diverts authority for
enforcement of occupational
health and safety rules from
environment department to
another agency States
occupational health and safety
act designates the environment
department as the agency for
Forsman of workplace safety
rules in accordance with federal
law that federal law has very
specific requirements on how the
state may implement occupational
health and safety enforcement
and by diverting that authority
this bill has the potential to
to because the state
occupational health and safety
agency to to lose potentially
federal
federal approval and federal
funding an amount of
approximately one point eight
million dollars per year and so
again madam chair and members of
the committee of Environment
Department for the reasons I
just mentioned opposes the bill
thank you.
Good afternoon Madam chairwoman
and members of the committee my
name is Kimberly Souter's by Kim
centers I am the acting director
of labor relations for the New
Mexico department of workforce
solutions thank you for having
us here today first and foremost
the department supports
background artist thank you for
your service to the state of New
Mexico and the film industry
bringing so much money into our
economy it's
by no means are we are we saying
that we do not support either of
these efforts I just want to
point out some things we will
enforce whatever statutes are
passed in terms of of wage which
payment acts modifications but I
just want to point some things
out here in terms of significant
issues with this bill house bill
twenty three men's
section fifty up part four part
part two of the Act which
creates new wage payment time
frame specific to background
artists as a new employee class.
The existing which in our
statute already covers employees
and employers in the state
including background artists and
their employers it's unclear why
background artists and their
employees need to be separated
into a separate class for all of
the employees and employers
throughout the state.
Assuming a separate statute for
background artist may be
necessary this bill prescribes
new and different rate deadlines
for employers.
This bill makes wages for
background Akhter actors due on
the twenty second and seven days
of each month well all other
employees throughout the state
must be paid by the twenty fifth
and the tenth day of each month.
Creating new and other employees
employee deadlines for
background artists and not non
background artist is likely
burdensome and costly for
employers who would have to
prescribe additional payroll
cycles each month for different
employee classes.
The proposed provision creating
separate prescribed paydays for
background artist does not in
school does not afford employers
the current option we're PED's
fall on the last in fifteen days
of each month.
And the existing wage never
statute
it's unclear why we should
continue to be an option for
employers to hire artists but in
any event industry employers may
find this change unfair and
discriminatory.
Having two different paid a
deadlines may add confusion or
disruption to my division's
current wage and hour claims
processing and otherwise it
becomes administrative
administratively cumbersome to
our division.
The proposed background artists
Bill of Rights contains four
provisions only two of which
fall within the jurisdiction of
DWS and to the Human Rights
bureau.
H. R. B. human resources are
human rights bureau the section
of the division that I enforce
invest investigates and enforces
claims which H. B. twenty three
already proposes.
And it seeks to address concerns
related to individuals with
disabilities by requiring is
part of the proposed background
artist bill of rights that
employer shall gather
information upon employment on
any physical or mental
disability or serious mental
condition of background artists.
This provision appears
problematic because it either
duplicate duplicates or
contradicts the existing
statutory and regulatory
provisions already in our Los.
Creating a civil cause of action
against employers who fail to
pay wages to background artist
properly may also be unnecessary
because background artists are
already covered by again
existing wait an hour and Human
Rights bureau Los.
Finally out the provision making
it a misdemeanor to violate the
proposed background artist act
appears unnecessary in so far as
it relates to the payment of
wages since it's already a
misdemeanor to violate the
Corona statute and we already
have prosecutorial
power to enforce these laws.
Thank you.
Representative would you like to
respond.
madam chairman the.
The information was really
overwhelming the change rooms of
our departments
Kind of a waiting to this
hearing to kind of share that.
That information was not
forthcoming to me.
and
it's just too overwhelming.
and for the committee to make a
a decision on whether to move
this bill forward in that
I think is relevant.
until you know
I have the.
Kind of madam chair the time.
To kind of up in the.
Address those concerns in the
real of top quality.
so I don't know which to kind
of.
The committee in terms of making
a determination on this bill.
So
it just the kind of real
And support the manager.
For the departments to wait to
this point in time in terms of
the moment of this legislation
to kind of bring these issues
for.
When they could very easily done
that again either prior to going
into the first.
So
I mean Madam chair I have no.
Those are.
As of rolling over this
legislation and see if we can
soak up to some.
kind of
common ground between now and
the end of the session.
But
that all depends on the on the
agencies that propped up that
information for.
In terms of of what we're how
much they're willing to kind of
give and take Madam chair on on
the on the legislation before us
but let madam chair you know my
argument still holds.
In terms of
The basically
The end the action on the part
of.
The film office the office of
the economic development office.
The kind of really hold to the
law.
I knew that when it comes to
processing these complaints of
non payment.
set the set safety and working
conditions but back on actors.
And we've got the documentation.
You know they basically turned
their back on disinformation.
You know and but
madam chair I
Basically a.
What the of appreciate the
opportunity to
Kind of roll over this bill and
give me the opportunity to kind
of really have a sit down with
these agencies
if possible.
Considering the time limitations
left in the session.
and go from there.
Representative I appreciate I
know the the people in this room
appreciate the right this bill
for a full day here are to the
right place and I think that
there obviously are some issues
the more we do into the the bill
and looking at the at the act
it's clear to me that it's an
enforcement issue SO what I I
would really recommend I mean I
I am very happy that all the
parties seem to be in the room
today.
And this is I think of a point
at it's a catalyst to move in a
direction to help
background actors that you're
trying to support if they were
not at the table for discussion
of in the past I think they are
here down there here today what
I heard was a willingness to to
work to to remedy this problem
problem and I continue to hear
just need more space issue and
so I really would like you want
to get to the bottom of it
whether it's during the
interview but we want to make
sure that people of New Mexico
are not being taken and act when
they provided services are
getting paid and if there is a
problem with that they need it
we need to find out where the
breakdown is and so I am I'm
asking everybody to continue to
be working together and to talk
I don't want us to come together
next year to interview and there
be a stalemate in that so I
would encourage you to do that
because I I think you're wanting
to do good for for this
population so thank you I am not
accept your request to roll this
this bill and encourage you to
to to make sure that you follow
through and and fix that centers
my intent thank you thank you
madam chair I'm in.
Our next bill what we H. V.
fifty five cents the sponsor is
on his way up is when I
understand so what.
Thank you.
With with.
Welcome.
