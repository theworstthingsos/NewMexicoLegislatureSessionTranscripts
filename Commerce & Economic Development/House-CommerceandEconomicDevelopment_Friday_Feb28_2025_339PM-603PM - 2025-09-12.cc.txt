Representative Armstrong.
Representative de la Cruz.
Representative Hernandez,
Representative Lente.
Representative Mason.
Representative Matthews.
Here
Representative Murphy here.
Representative Parajan.
Representative Serrado.
Madam Vice Chair,
Madam Chair, Madam Chair, you
have a quorum.
Thank you. All righty, if we can
go to Representative Matthews.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair, I'm
measuring by distance.
For the new side on the table.
Um, and, um, Madam Chair, having
voted in the affirmative to
table HB 346. I move that we
reconsider.
That action, I don't believe I
was the only one who did that,
so I'm assuming the group is
going to reconsider that action,
not just me.
Thank you. Do we have a
So we've got one of our sponsors
here. I know that the bill has
a, a substitute. Could you
briefly tell us about that since
we have already heard from
public comment, we will not be
taking public comment. Uh, we'll
go then to the committee and
hopefully we can clear this up
very quickly.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
again, this bill is essentially
outlying synthetic cannabinoids
from the hemp industry, um, we
have seen the rise of numerous
versions of Delta 8, Delta 9,
etc. This essentially ensures
that we do not allow any of that
further, um.
Persistence in the marketplace
to protect children, namely, but
anybody else who doesn't know
it's unregulated. The committee
said before you merely, um,
ensures that the rulemaking
process is in the right
timeline. We had overlooked that
in the previous um committee
hearing. We hope that you will
adopt that here.
Thank you. All righty. Do we,
um, see that we've been joined
by Chairman Linte.
And um I wanted to see if
anybody wanted to move this up.
So
OK.
OK.
Do we have any, um, it's been
moved? Do we have any discussion
on the subject.
Um, madam chair.
Yeah, can I ask you a question?
Sure, I do I need to do a move
first, um, no, cause we're,
we're, we've moved the the up
for discussion, so at this point
we're just taking comments from
the uh.
From the, the committee. So
Representative Matthews, OK.
Um
I, I would, uh, appreciate if uh
The presenters could um point
out the
Substantial changes between this
and the original one.
To.
I, I see the materials
underlined.
Um, it's kind of a technical
subject though I'd like to have
a little, little framework.
Thank you, thank you.
Madam Chair, my expert is John
Roderick with the uh New Mexico
Environment Department.
You welcome. Thank you, Madam
Chair and Representative
Matthews, the.
Changes are specific to the
adoption of rules.
Uh, under the emergency clause,
we
The sequencing was wrong for
adopting for enemyD being able
to adopt emergency rules to go
into effect.
And then the uh environmental
improvement board has to adopt
the permanent rules beginning
July 1st.
And that wasn't clear in the
first section, so what we did is
specified.
That EIB would be adopting rules
either either adopting the rules
that enemy.
Comes up with initially or
promulgating new rules, but we
just had to get the sequence on
the authorities.
Madam Chan.
I'm sorry.
Madam Chair, um.
Very
Representer representative
representative.
Um
So
OK, so new rules will be adopted
by July 1, 2025 this year,
correct?
And, and we have written in this
bill.
Writes the descriptions of the
Chemical, I'm, I'm calling
chemical. I'm not quite sure
that's the right word.
Um, substances that sometimes
get into the hemp product.
Synthetic can
Anabinoids, Madam Chair,
Representative, they're
extracted from a hemp product
that's a synthetic process we
described at length,
unfortunately, the last uh
committee.
Which we are trying to
essentially outlaw and, and
Madam Chair, uh, representative,
we've made it broad enough so
that we're not just focusing on
one. Correct. So, so this, we
won't have to keep readdressing
this issue.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
That's all the questions I have.
Thank you, Representative
Hernandez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um.
I just have a question I haven't
read all the way through this
yet, um.
OK, so we're just going to
outlaw, no, we're, we're not
going to.
Make rules for
Somehow making it legal again in
some form, OK, I just wanted to
like.
Yet down the path of what we
were doing thank you.
Vice chair.
I'm sure I'd like to move a do
not pass on House Bill 346 in a
due pass on the House Commerce
and Economic Development
Committee substitute for House
Bill 346. Thank you. Do I have a
second? Patrick to take the
role.
Representative Armstrong.
Representative De la Cruz.
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lente.
Representative Mason.
Representative Matthews. Yes.
Representative Murphy, yes.
Representative Parajon.
Representative Serrado.
Representative Hernandez.
Madam Vice Chair, yes.
Madam Chair. um
Hernandez did.
And I'm a yes.
Madam Chair, the final tally is
10 votes. Yes, 0 votes no. Yes.
Thank you.
Alrighty, can we go to HB 447,
please.
Representative Vincent, welcome.
Are you ready to begin?
Yes ma'am, thank you, madam
chair thank you committee.
I'm wondering why you didn't put
me on this committee.
Um, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, we do have uh.
We do have a video that's gonna
play and while it's playing.
I'm just gonna talk about it, is
that OK? OK.
So while they're getting that
going this bill.
It, it's a really
straightforward bill. It does 3
things. It's a tax exemption for
the riddles Downs racetrack.
For all the devastation that
you're gonna see on the video.
And um #2 is it's gonna be a
sports economic recovery.
And number 3, it provides a
temporary exemption for 4 years.
It's, it does have a sunset.
And number 4, it encourages
business stability.
And with everything that had
gone on in June.
With all the fires.
After we we went through all the
fires. This was the aftermath.
Of what you were just seeing.
And it just.
The Riddles Downs racetrack
worked diligently around the
clock 24 hours doing everything
they could to slow those
headwaters down and it just kept
coming and kept coming and kept
coming.
And
We were trying to get one end of
the track.
They literally went through the
tracks so they could at least
get it to flow through.
And there was just way too much
water and we just couldn't get
it to go.
So, uh, ultimately.
After, was it 2 weeks?
3rd 1 for the 3rd 1.
Um, you know, they finally.
They finally had to throw their
hands up and it blew through the
whole track and I'll let uh the
manager of the racetrack tell
you of the devastation.
Thank you, Madam Chair,
senators, I appreciate your time
today.
The, uh
The floodwaters that hit we
fought off two other.
Bloods prior to this.
We felt that it was somewhat of
our community obligation.
The fate these waters due to the
fact.
The residential area just east
of the racetrack as well as the
water treatment plant.
Uh, the highway 70 Bridge and
the devastation that could have
occurred.
Or the pasture lands downstream
as well.
Uh, the main sewer line for the
Mescalero tribe.
The village of Ruidoso and the
city of Riodoso and that was uh
task that we took on.
But it resulted in a $12 million
loss this institution has been
around since 1946 was the first
year that the all-American was
ran at Riodo Sedans.
The economic impact of Lincoln
County and surrounding areas.
It is $160 million on an annual
basis.
Many of the businesses in the
area have suffered greatly.
But one of the things that I'm
most proud of that we sit back
and watched what happened in Las
Vegas and so forth, we created a
task force.
Of all the local leaders.
And everyone come together.
We had one force in mind was to
get the economic engine turned
back on for all the businesses,
including the race track.
With that for the first time and
I've been at Riodoso. I started
in 1991.
I was gone for a while, managed
some other tracks, and then come
back in 2021.
So I've had the pleasure when we
were passing gaming of working
with the great Wendell Chino.
And now the president of the
tribe.
Or Padilla
Has stepped up in the community
and everyone is pulling together
in the same direction.
So the effect.
Of Riodosa Downs is broad
reaching.
In the state of New Mexico for
the breeding industry and the
United States.
As the owner of the property
says if it doesn't happen at
Riodosa Downs, it doesn't
happen.
So with all that, Madam Chair,
senators, I would appreciate
your support.
House Bill 447.
Thank you. Um, do we have
anybody here in, uh, opposition
to this bill.
He went on Zoom in opposition.
Vanessa Alexander.
You have one minute.
Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes.
Thank you.
First of all, the track has been
underwater before.
And you're talking, you know,
almost 10 ft deep at one point.
Management didn't learn their
lesson then.
Since then, for the last
umpteen, I don't know,
in the public have been telling
management to take action to
mitigate the inevitable flooding
and for years that that has
fallen on deaf ears.
The
The idea that just one and only
business where the owner is a
multi, multi, multi,
multi-millionaire who's uh
Rosino is making millions and
millions upon millions of
dollars needing what is
essentially an unconstitutional
arbitrary uh tax break. It's
just, it's just outrageous.
Uh, reading those, uh, owners
have known about uh the
and what was going to take place
if there was another fire for a
decade. This is on them. This
needs to be their mass to clean
up and there needs to be at some
point a lesson.
Anybody else?
Um
Let's go to, um, in favor.
The bill? Anybody?
If we can get the attendant to
hold the microphone, everybody's
got a minute.
Hello, Madam Chair, members of
the committee, Carrie Robin
Bruder, I'm representing Lincoln
County. Uh, we just want to
harken back to what Mr. Boss
said after the floods and the
fires we created a Sierra Blanca
Regional task force to rebuild
economic activity in the region
and we view this bill and the
racetrack as a really critical
component to that. So we urge
its passage and uh Lincoln
County fully supports the
measure. Thank you.
Madam Chair, members Committee,
Jason Weeks registered lobbyist
for the Albuquerque, uh, Downs
racetrack and casino.
We stand in solidarity, um, with
the racetrack ownership and, uh,
race, racing operations that are
occurring at Rio. So, quite
frankly, predicting something
like this would be impossible,
and investing in infrastructure
to prevent, prevent something
like this would be impossible.
Look at the images on the
screen. I'm not sure you could
have done anything relative to
infrastructure improvement, they
would have predicted this. They
do need the capacity to try to
figure out how to bank some
money to get that track running
Riodoso Downs has been there for
a very long time. It's an anchor
business in the
community. It's a part of Rio.
So, and quite frankly, without
some economic uh help.
be able to rebuild and so doing
what we can as a state to try to
get Riodoso back on its feet is
absolutely something that this
committee and frankly the
legislature as a whole should
pursue. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair members.
My name is Catherine Cruciatta.
I'm a registered lobbyist for
Sunland Park Racetrack and
Casino. We stand in solitary,
solidarity with Rudeo Downs and
um we just believe in supporting
our fellow racing community. We
want to see it stick to thrive
and and stay in business and we
stand in support, we urge your
support as well. Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Brent
Moore. I'm a registered lobbyist
for Penn Entertainment, and they
operates the track and hubs
Park. Uh, we stand in support of
this measure. The folks in
Riodoso have suffered quite a
bit and this track is an icon
within the industry and we
support the bill. Thank you very
much.
We have anybody on Zoom.
Cora Paia
Hello,
this is um this afternoon I want
to express my strong support for
HP 447 and while the Mescalera
patch you tribe and it's gaming
enterprises do not directly
benefit from this spill. We do
recognize that the racetrack is
a key driver of tourism and
economic activity in our region.
The interconnected nature of our
economy means that ensuring the
racetrack recovery will
have
positive ripple effect for
businesses.
Workers in communities,
including those on the
reservation.
This bill will provide much
needed relief that will allow
the track to reinvest its
operations, retain jobs, and
continue to attract visitors.
This will ultimately benefit the
entire regional economy and this
legislation is not just about
one business. It is about
sustaining and thriving and
resilient community for years to
come, so we do strongly support
this. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam President.
Richard Bustamante.
Richard Bustamante.
Yes, can you hear me? Yes.
OK, my apologies, uh, madam
chair, members of the committee,
Richard Bustamante,
uh, lead counsel for the state
of New Mexico racing mission on
behalf of the commission,
I strongly support this
legislation and respectfully
urge passage. Thank you very
much.

And I urge
and that the committee and Madam
chairman that just to pass this
bill.
We also economic engine and not
just the tall racing industry in
Mexico and that and it's uh uh
this is probably one of the
easiest ways for the state to
invest in rebuilding the
total
region.
And help support the horse
racing throughout the state.
Thank you.

component to tourism and the
economy at large. We applaud the
efforts of the owners and
management of racetrack and
bring
this facility back to life
following the horrendous fires
and flooding that affected the
entire community
given the race track and
and uh and raising importance to
the state. We support the
passage of the bill before you.
Thank you.
Thank you. We can go to the
committee now, uh, Chair De la
Cruz.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Vincent, so we're
to understand that the reach
track is still in er not
operational.
Madam Chair, that is correct,
senator.
Uh, we've been working
diligently with Homeland
Security FEMA.
Army Corps, uh, there's been a
lot of hoops that we've had to
jump through.
Region 6 out of Dallas due to
waterways in the US.
We should be getting started.
We've, we've done deconstruction
now we're gonna begin the
construction portion of it.
Monday, uh, talked to the
contractors today.
They're gonna be running a
bypass line from the west end to
the east end.
to divert the river so that they
can get in and expeditate the
process.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I was
one of several legislators that.
Toured not only the the race
track, but also the community
see the
The scars of the fire that was
historical.
And
Having walked around that area.
Uh, it's clear to me that that
flood was historical. It's
Yeah, you can get heavy rain,
but you don't get something like
what happened there.
Very often, if ever.
Uh, you said, Madam chair.
You said that there's $160
million of impact.
What does that mean exactly?
Madam Chair Representative.
It's, it's for the entire
region. It's, it's what we bring
in for from all of Lincoln
County.
Uh, the study's been done
numerous times in the way that
it's actually set up it's a the
racetrack representative in
another 60 million of indirect.
Because of the racetrack as
well.
That's a fairly significant
number, and I suspect Ma I'm
sure that it's probably higher
than that because there's tends
to be quite a multiplier.
To impact fiscal impact.
Uh
It's, it's just very, very
concerning, uh, and there's just
so much that's not happening
economically, Madam Chair.
So when the time comes, I'd like
to move this bill. Thank you.
Thank you. uh, Representative
Serato, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative for
this bill. I have a couple of
specific questions, um, just on
previous bills that you know,
you presented. So, um, I'm
curious because I know in a
previous conversation, um, the
the
Was there a fund set up for
Riodoso like, um, we discussed
in rural development for Chavez
to kind of fill in that gap
before FEMA can uh reimburse
folks, uh, Madam Chair and
Representative.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative Serato, are
you talking about the community
foundation or are you talking
about House Bill one.? uh, no,
the Community Foundation yes
ma'am,
so, uh.
Madam Chair and Representative
Serrado, there was a community
foundation and you know,
yesterday, and I, I hate to be a
parrot and just say the same
things over and over, but there
was such.
Mm
Nobody realized just how
Valuable the track was, our
businesses.
Uh, the end of the mountain gods
and after this happened,
everybody got together and
they're like, wow, this track
really brings in a lot of money.
And they come to town and they
eat in our restaurants and they
shop and they buy their wife,
their wive's beautiful jewelry
and things like that and that's
just a plug
for anybody jewelry
but they kept our, they kept our
economy alive.
And people were coming to keep
it alive and, and we really
appreciated it. However, that
community foundation they were
mainly helping people.
That had been evacuated and and
really don't give matter of
fact, the race track.
How much did y'all give the
community foundation?
Madam Chair Representative
Vincent Serrano.
Over half a million dollars from
the individual's owners.
And supporters of the racing
industry contributed a half a
million to the community
foundation.
So, Madam Chair, and, and
Representative Cerrado, you
know, they were, they were
actually hemorrhaging
themselves.
But they were willing to give
money to the foundation to help
the local folks in town and it
and it did real good, but one
thing that we figured out is we
didn't have enough money.
Whoever has enough money in in
the community foundations so we
learned from that and we're
trying to spread that around to
other communities like yours
that if something does happen,
make sure you have a, a.
fund set up for your community
that can stay super solvent.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I think
you representative and just for
my understanding, and you may
have mentioned it maybe I missed
it when you were saying it, but
um, the amount that you're
anticipating from FEMA to
eventually, uh, you know, pay,
uh, is there a shortfall, uh,
uh, uh, a difference between
that and what you guys are are
suffering through
FEMA's uh.
Experience is analian.
The 12 million that we've
already we lost that portion due
to our obligations.
The rental of the downs of
Albuquerque to move the race
meat and so forth.
So now we've got additional
expenses to put things back that
FEMA will. Thank you so much. It
helps clarify as well. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you if we can have a.
Representative Mason.
Yeah.
For
Is his mic on? I barely can't
hear him.
And I'm sure that's represented.
I apologize. I'll speak louder.
I don't hear good anyway so.
I don't though.
Uh, oh, it, it was a
devastating.
Events and we've see like New
Mexico has had more than their
share of them in the last few
years.
But just a question or two,
We call rid of Madam Chair
Representative.
The rest they know, so is this
exemption for the track and the
casino or just the track or
who's not paying or are they
both included in this.
Tax exemption
Madam Chairs representative,
it's just the, the net take.
of the casino, the
They know only this.
Racetrack take doesn't, no, sir.
OK. Why not?
You know, when you look at the
difference of the revenues
between the racing and her side.
The majority of the revenues
come from the casino.
And the tax portion.
The way that it was structured
back whenever.
It's not that high of a tax rate
or the racing so.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative just.
I, I couldn't, I couldn't.
Be in there where it told me
exactly.
I guess it told me exactly. I
just wouldn't believing it.
But uh
They, uh, this will not.
This, Madam Chair
Representatives.
Like the Muscular and all those,
and I heard them speak in favor
of this bill, so.
Uh, but they get no benefit out
of it.
No, sir.
I
Madam Chair represented, but
they didn't.
Received the
Damages that show they did on
the downhill side of Riosa.
Where y'all set, but uh.
OK, so I, Madam Chair
represented, that's.
Basically that one question is
all I have. Thank you and good
luck.
Thank you, Representative
Matthews.
Thank you Madam Chair, um, and
thank you.
Uh, representative for the bill
and
I'm sorry, I never caught the
name of the gentleman with you.
I'm sorry, representative my
name's Rick Ball.
B A
U G H. Thank you.
Um, just a couple questions.
Um, so the, you're asking for an
exemption from the racing.
Acts
gaming tax. I'm sorry.
From
I
Beginning now through July 1,
2029 or is it retroactive at
all?
Madam Chair, that's
representative. It will start in
July of this year and run
through 29 and then it has the
sunset.
And Madam Chair, uh.
I
And that would be about
1.6 million a year that.
You would not have to be.
Paying on that gaming tax, is
that right, Madam Chair
represented, that is correct.
And uh Madam chair.
We will
Track and uh.
Uh, the gaming operation at the
track continued to operate.
Again, starting in 20.
25.
And through 2029.
Madam Chair represented that is
correct we closed our casino for
approximately.
7 to 8 days due to our main
entrance road, the bridge at the
main entrance had collapsed as
well.
So in cooperation with the DOT.
They were able to place plates
on that road.
And we were able to reopen our
cass ever since.
OK, and uh.
So
Madam chair, um.
Representative.
I
Having this um gaming tax.
Not charged or exempt for this
period of time.
I
It is it is it your goal to use.
That savings.
In order to help rebuild.
The physical property and so
forth, is that what what's
happening here, Madam Chair,
that is correct. OK.
Um
And Madam sure um.
Is there
You mentioned some FEMA funds
uh.
Is, are there any insurance
funds or anything going to be?
On the table to help.
Make, make, make this back to
like it was.
No, ma'am, man of chair, I
apologize. Representative,
there's no insurance.
property is numerous properties
in the area sit in a flood zone.
I think I understand what's
happening. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Do we have any other
questions?
Have you
Representative, thank you, um.
And your uh representative Mr.
Ball.
Um, some of my earliest memories
were um driving up to Rossville.
My family, um, remember and
watching the horses run, um,
they're a really nice places to
sit, uh, up in the top, the
jockey Club and Turf Club but
Um, we always would would hang
out down there by the rail
because you could, you could see
and and almost feel the horses
and the excitement.
So long, long history there, and
I certainly know I own property
in Lincoln County, um, on and
off, uh, for 30 years. I, I, uh,
I currently don't.
But you have some pretty country
up there, so I might again soon.
I'm just following up real
quickly on Representative
Matthew's kind of line of
questioning. He said, if I
understand it that you've
already invested about 12
million.
In, in repairs so far, is that
correct?
Madam Chair Representative, that
is correct and and.
It continues on.
I mean, just for example with
your experience at Riodosaans,
uh, our tote board.
Um, the indicators on the board
no one realizes I mean that.
That was about a $250,000 hit.
That we've got there, the
drainage system that's not
covered.
through FEMA or Homeland or
anything such as that, uh, the
replacement of the racetrack
surface itself.
there's just so many
insurmountable expenses that
just they keep piling and
there's there's a science to
that racetrack.
not many people realize it's not
just dirt.
But that that track surface is
tested and we achieve a silt and
clay content or the safety of
the equine athletes and jockeys,
says one.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative and Mr. Bell, um.
The, so the, you, you've put
about 12 million in, how much
more do you anticipate that
you'll have to spend another 12
to 15, I would guess.
Madam Chair Representative,
every time I turn around it's
growing, uh, because we're going
to have to with the uh
assistance of NRCS and and I'd
like to go back just for a
second when I come back to
Riodoso 21, the river itselfton
in over 8 ft.
I had given notice to national
resources and Conservation
Service that we've got a
problem.
And got him to come out in 22
and acknowledge the problem and
in 23.
Uh, the culverts on the West End
had set it in and we only had
like 40% capacity of usage for
that water to flow.
And they come in and just clean
200 ft east and west within 10
days it was silted back in.
And I told him, you're gonna get
me in trouble.
And we can't get in that river.
We can't touch it.
Uh, so
Thank you, Madam Chair,
Representative, um,
So it'd be fair to say at 1.6
million a year for 4 years,
that's $6.4 million. That'll
help get things back into shape,
but, but it's sure not gonna
make you but but it ought to be
a good start is that what I'm
hearing that is representative
that's correct.
I'll, uh, I'll conclude with one
other thing, and that is not
only is there a casino there
there's also in the race track,
obviously, uh, but you also host
a lot of events and I've been
to, if I recall, Cowboy
Symposium is a very big event
and there's other things that
you host.
In the community as well. Am I
remembering that correctly?
Madam Chair Representative, we
also have our sale company.
And uh we sell.
Approximately 400 head of horses
on an annual basis at Riodoso as
well.
Uh, we had looked at moving the
horse sale to Albuquerque this
year as well.
But it just wouldn't work, so we
had to go back to Riodoso.
So we had 2 different crews and
22 different places to achieve
that goal.
And is representative Vincent,
uh, alluded to the community was
very grateful that we brought
the sales.
Madam Chair, I'll conclude just
by saying it's, it's a huge
economic driver down in in our
part of the world so encourage
the committee to support it.
Thank you all.
You, uh, Chair Linton.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I
apologize for walking in late
and I'm sure that you've
discussed this, but uh I, I will
ask a question nonetheless, uh,
you find for me temporary.
As it, as it relates to the
bill.
Madam Chair Representative,
we're talking about through 29
and then there'll be a sunset
clause in 209.
So for the years,
25 to 29, there will be no taxes
paid by your operation, uh, to
this state.
Madam Chair Representative, no
gaming tax gaming tax to this.
And then in regards to the no
gaming tax.
Um
Who owns the race track?
gentleman by the name of Johnny
Trotter and his wife Janena
Trotter.
OK. And, and, and where, where,
where are they?
Where they reside.
He runs them, uh, feeding
operation in Hertford, Texas,
but he has a residence in.
also as well.
OK, so he's from Texas, but
lives in Rioso has a, has a
house in Rio.
OK, so my, my, my questions stem
from
The LSG, the, the FIR report in
regards to some of the
substantial or significant
issues that is flagged in here
in regards to identifying um.
In regards to this matter, one
of the gaming operations amongst
the many in the state of New
Mexico that would receive this
type of benefit, which
Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm
wrong, Madam Chair and
Representative, but this will be
the first time this is
happening?
Madam Chair Representative is as
far as I know, yes, OK, OK, and
Madam Chair Representative,
would this be then in any way,
shape or form, um.
A opening up of the gaming
compacts that tribes enjoy in
regards to their gaming
operations and them having to
pay a share of their profits.
To the state.
Madam Chair Representative, I'll
have to defer to.
Madame Cherry Representative
Linte, so, uh, before you got
here, uh, our Mescalero
president Thoro Padilla stands
in full support of this, and she
will not be benefiting from
anything and no it does not take
away from any of those taxes.
I don't know, I guess my
question is, does this violate
in any way or open up the gaming
compacts in regards to this
special privilege being offered
to the Downs that, that none of
the tribal casinos or any other
racetrack as I'm reading here or
casino um benefit from today.
Madam Chair, Representative
Ling, not, not to my Madam Chan,
is there anyone from the gaming
control board here?
This is um
And Madam Chan. I bring this up
only because it seems uh a great
benefit. I mean, I understand
what you guys have gone through
and I, I sympathize for
everything we want to go to the
operation, but uh in my in my
mind, uh, this is the reason why
any one business uh carries
insurance. This is why anyone in
business, um, knows that when
they build a facility in any one
place that there's a risk
involved in that and, and I've
been to your operation beautiful
and and and and I just, I
apologize for everything that
has gone on.
Over the past year and a half in
regards to the flooding and the
fire and so forth, but it seems
to me though that it's almost
And I'll call it what it is in
in my mind, coming in late, and
I'm sorry that I, that I did so,
but uh what's a sweetheart deal?
Uh, for this race track and
casino that if this is the
benefit provided to
This, this should be a benefit
provided to all the other.
Casinos in the entire state.
is this man chair and
representative. Madam Chair,
representative Linte so.
You know, I, I would hope that
if another race track goes
through the devastation that
this racetrack went through and
it's an economic driver for
their community, I would hope
that we would give another um
tax exemption to them to get
them whole because not only does
this hurt.
It's not really about the
racetrack, it's about our our
economy in Ridoso so and in
Lincoln County.
For example, um, you know, I was
speaking with.
President Padilla.
Mescalero and they when when
they went down.
There they were down 36% Justin
Mescalero because.
As the West Texas money comes
into Lincoln County.
They stop off at the racetrack.
They have a good day there and
then they go, they either go to
town to eat or they go to our
casinos and sometimes, you know,
not everybody likes to go to the
races, so the people that do go
to the races, the rest of the
family goes and shops in our in
our midtowns and um they they
really felt the brunt of that
whenever they left and went to
to um Albuquerque, so.
I wouldn't want to call it a
sweetheart deal, Madam Chair, I
would just say that, you know,
sometimes you gotta add some
money to something to keep the
driver there.
And Madam Chan representative,
I, I fully understand. I mean,
we all went through COVID. I
know the shutdowns during that
time held a great impact to many
of the
Casinos around the state and and
small businesses alike, but when
I look at something like this
and and realize that it's it's
for one.
One racetrack and casino.
Knowing that one family owns it
that are not.
Resident or citizens of the
state of New Mexico. I, I make
the distinction immediately that
you have tribal operations that
if they enjoyed this type of
benefit, could provide their
membership with much more
benefit.
For the government from the
government structure police,
health care, social security,
all these other things that
That's what, that's why they
built their casinos. So if this
is given for this is provided
for one.
In my mind it's be right for
all.
That's for that reason, Madam
Chair, I, I can't support this
measure.
Thank you. Do we have any other
questions?
I have a couple.
Um
Hm
So we were actually for the for
the interim committees, we were
scheduled to go down to um.
To Riodoso and I think you all
were gonna hostess, and that's
when, when all this devastation
happened and so since then we've
had time to go up and we've
looked at it, um, I think, you
know, pictures are worth 1000
words. I think those are very
impactful, um.
You know, once again, I, I, I
look at.
That there is a sunset on this.
I, I get that, um.
You know, trying to make you
whole is is important, but I
also think, um.
It's not just the racetrack,
it's the whole community is what
I see. And so, um, do we know
who was responsible, what were
you all responsible for the
flooding, you know, we heard
that at the beginning, who was
responsible for the flooding.
I mean, I know, besides that,
you know, Mother Nature, but was
there preventative things that
we could have done or you could
have done uh ahead of time.
Madam Chair, that that's an
excellent question, uh, NRCS was
told.
That we had a problem.
And I know from 91 until 1996,
we took it upon ourselves to
clean that river.
And we were told to stop.
And once again, um.
When I come back
And saw the condition of the
river.
Uh, it was just like.
That's, that's all that can
happen. Nothing else can happen.
But once the fire started, there
was a a levy of
they tore that we out which
diverted water.
Uh, downstream to the pastures,
but it wasn't functioning and
that's what caused the silting
of the river.
And reduce the flow of capacity
of water to go through that
area.
And um,
Explain to me who NRCS is
our resources and Conservation
Service who reports up to USDA.
To the defense.
OK.
I mean, and, and I hear that the
insurance piece, I don't
understand. I know for within my
own family, we were given notice
this past year, in fact, uh,
regarding fires that we weren't
going to be renewed because we
were now in a fire zone.
Um, why didn't, why didn't the
racetrack have insurance, Madam
Chair, we're in a flood zone.
Was it ever insured?
Madam chair, not to my
knowledge.
All righty.
Uh, what's the will of the
committee?
Madam sure I'd like to move with
due approval. I mean a due pass.
OK, we have a second?
Because a second, Mr. Mason,
Representative Mason, uh,
Patrick to take the role.
Representative Armstrong.
Representative de la Cruz, yes.
Representative Hernandez.
Representative L Lente.
No, I like to clean my boat.
Representative Mason.
Representative Matthews.
and
no and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Representative Murphy, yes.
Representative Parajan.
Representative Serrado.
Madam Vice Chair
Yes.
Madam Chair. Yes.
Madam Chair, final tally 6
votes, yes, 4 votes no for the
DuPass motion
go to explanation of votes,
starting with uh
Carleton. Thank you, and it's
not common practice that I
explained my votes, but at the
same time, I felt it really
important that when a business
has no insurance, just like a
homeowner doesn't have insurance
and their house is flooded or
goes up in flames. Shame on that
owner, unfortunately, this is
the same case and so I don't see
why the state should be on the
line for something like this,
and so I'm glad to see that it
goes to health taxation next,
but uh we'll hear it when it
gets there. Thank you much.
Representative Matthews. Thank
you, Madam Chair, and um.
Um, I used to live in that part
of the state and was at Ruidoso
Downs a number of times it's,
it's a beautiful facility.
And what happened is certainly a
tragic. I just think it's.
I think
Waving a state tax as a way to
help somebody recover.
Um
And if that's going to be a
policy. I mean that shouldn't be
a one off.
That, uh, I would like to know
that there was legislative
approval to
Do that kind of thing, and I'm
guessing that there's nothing in
the tax statutes that really
authorizes us.
To do that. And I'm, it just
feels not quite.
Right.
Thank you, you, I think
everybody who wanted to explain
their vote explained, OK, you've
got to do pass representative.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you. Thank you.
for my
Right.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair.
Good afternoon, committee
members.
Gospel 281.
Simply removes the license or
reroval
requirement, excuse me.
For hair braiders in New Mexico,
um, um, rather than, and that's,
that's really all this bill
does, but I think it would be
much more impactful, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
if I allow my experts to present
here, one online, um, to
introduce themselves and give
their uh testimony, and that
will really explain why we're
bringing this bill forward
today.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and
representatives.
Um, my name is Timothy Green,
the 4th, and I am culture change
leader for the city of
Albuquerque.
So I've been appointed by Mayor
Keller to identify systemic and
structural issues within the
city government, local
government, um, that create
discrimination and barriers for
our communities to thrive and
access the resources that they
need.
So I'm here to talk to you today
from my emerging expertise. Um,
I've been working with our
policy committee and we have
identified a problem area, um,
around, uh, that specifically
impacts logicians and hair
braiders.
And for us, we're calling for an
exemption to Title 16, chapter
34, part 1.
Which places unnecessaries and
erroneous burdens on hair
braiders and lockticians. So I'm
gonna take a few moments to kind
of talk to you about some of
those burdens and what we, what
we have identified.
So for us, um, cosmetology
school claims that it takes
about 12 months to finish, but
if you look at the data, um
there should be a handout there.
In reality, it takes anywhere
between 18 to 24 months to
complete.
At the same time, um, schools do
not offer any type of training
in natural hair braiding or
loitian.
Um, and so therefore, if this is
a tradition in which you've
developed within your community,
your family and your culture,
then you have to go and you have
to go pay for a license that
does not deal with your
expertise or who you are, um, it
becomes somewhat problematic,
right?
At the same time, it costs
anywhere between $16,000 and
$42,000 to get a cosmetology
license, um, and Pell grants
only covered 9000 and then you
can only take out um uh other
loans up to 4000, so somewhere
between 13,000 in total.
And then last but not least,
cosmetology licensing is not
essential for public safety,
meaning that logicians and hair
braiders will not be working
with dangerous chemicals, right,
that will harm uh individuals or
will harm our environment.
And so for us, um, we would
really like to focus on how this
policy area will create economic
justice and independence for
many, many communities across
New Mexico. I'm gonna take a
moment to identify some of them.
First and foremost are our
immigrant and refugee
communities. Many of those
individuals come here with um
the skills and the practices
that they've learned from their
country and they bring those to
our community.
Next, we have to think about, of
course, our formerly
incarcerated or people coming
out of um incarceration, right?
Because this is a skill and a
career that they uh develop
oftentimes within uh being
incarcerated and when they come
out, it's an opportunity for
them to be economically
independent and uh and and.
And powerful.
Uh, we also have, of course, our
black community, which is a
source of economic empowerment
and also culturally relevant and
traditional. And then we have
our 23 sovereign nations and
tribes where we know hair
braiding is not only cultural,
but it's ceremonial and it's,
it's deeply rooted in tradition
and who they are as a people.
And then last but not least, we
also have our individuals with
disabilities, right? And
individuals with disabilities,
as we know, sometimes it can be
difficult to get um formal
employment, and this is an
opportunity for them to again um
take the skills and the crafts
that they have and to be
economically independent and
sufficient. And it cuts across
both rural and um urban areas,
right? So, um, with that said,
Not your health providers
generate anywhere between 28,000
to $65,000 a year annually.
And so, um, we have
And
We have worked with and
Identified upwards to 300 hair
braiders and logicians
throughout the state.
And so, um, when you combine the
gross annual income, that's
nearly 8.4 to $19.5 million that
these hair braiders and
lockticians will be contributing
to the state of New Mexico.
And so for us, um, in closing,
we're calling for an exemption,
um.
To, uh, these cosmetology
licensing and hopefully we can
make New Mexico the thirty-fifth
state to pass this Natural Hair
Act and um open up some economic
sustainability and independence
for all of our communities, um,
because I do believe that this
piece of legislation is a bit
antiquated and it limits the
independence and economic state
growth by having a monopoly over
the licensure of natural hair
braiding when in reality it
doesn't deal with natural hair
braiding.
Thank you so much, and I will
pass it over to my next, my
colleague.
Cher goggles and members of the
committee. I greet you today
with Salad bona, which is the
Zulu greeting for I see you.
And the village always would
respond with I likewise pour
into and see you as well.
And my name, Neima Kamaria
Hanifa Pike. I, uh.
Represent our office of black
community engagement for the
city of Albuquerque and act as
the mayor's liaison for our
black community. I am coming to
you as a 24 year licensed
cosmetologist, uh, and
anthropologist, uh, and
additionally a clinical
psychologist. My mama calls me
the ologist and um I'm the proud
mama of two.
And just rewinding the hands of
time to when I was 19 years old
here in New Mexico and uh was
told that I would be required to
obtain a cosmetology license or
a skill set that I learned at my
mother's feet and folks in the
community in my own neighborhood
back in Southern California
before coming to New Mexico and
um that it was not recognized as
something permissible to
practice to generate.
income for my family and so this
generational inheritance, which
is so rich in being able to
allow us to pass education and
information one to another, but
also generating wealth for our
community is imperative.
I'd like to highlight the, uh,
Madam CJ Walker and Madam CJ
Walker was the first woman
millionaire in the United States
of America. She just so happened
to be a hair activist and
celebrated the art form of
natural hair care and creating
products as well uh to introduce
to the community and to educate
our communities nationwide, and
so we want to develop those same
opportunities.
economically without regulation,
uh, for our community as well.
Um, I'd like to also highlight
that, uh, as my colleague
mentioned, the practices of
natural hair care truly are um
natural. We are not using
chemicals in these services when
you are in cosmetology school,
um, what you're primarily
focusing in on our chemical
applications, haircutting, but
you are never taught to breed or
lock or to twist hair and so we
are looking at this from the.
perspective of saying, how can a
board regulate or evaluate a
practice.
That they cannot teach and do
not know, uh, I was a licensed
educator for the state of New
Mexico as a cosmetology
instructor as well and can speak
firsthand, uh, to stating that
in terms of the uh exams that
are required to be taken, I does
not include.
This particular service at all,
and so we are coming to you
today to call for this
exemption, uh, from the board of
barbering and cosmetology and
that house Bill 281 will allow
this opportunity for over 300
identified um.
providers throughout the state
of New Mexico to be empowered by
opening their own companies,
contributing to our state's tax
base, but also generating that
wealth that allows for you to,
uh, own a home and present
documentation that says I have a
strong, uh, credible company and
we also know the impact of what
it looks like for communities
who can celebrate businesses
that have been built for us and
by us and create safe spaces as
well.
And so I want to give a huge
amount of gratitude for the fact
that it was New Mexico who
passed the Crown Act, which was
a protection for um hair and
regalia and beating and all the
things that um should be
permissible in our environments
and education and in office and
workplace, and so today I know
that you can work with us to
make sure that we ensure uh that
the economic piece for breeders
and loitians are.
Uh, opened up for the great
possibility and potential to
support our own families and to
support our state's economy.
I thank you for your time and
happy Black History Month.
And um Leslie, uh, I have Jordan
Benegas with the Justice
Institute on Zoom. Hi, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
uh, my name is Jordan. I'm for
Justice. We're a national public
interest, uh, civil liberties
law firm that has advocated for
the rights of natural hair
braiders to earn an honest
living for the last, uh, 30 plus
years. Additionally, I'm a 7
generation New Mexican, very
proud of that. Um, thank you
much. Thank you so much for the
opportunity to speak in support
of this bill. I'll be brief.
uh, we believe that New Mexico
should join the 35 other states
that do not require any license
to do something as safe as,
and that this bill would create
tremendous opportunity as we've
seen in other states for
aspiring hair braiders and
business owners. Um, thank you
so much for your consideration
and I'm also available to answer
any questions.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um,
would you like to have an
amendment, but would you like to
do public comment first?
Well, I also want to recognize
it um when you're co-sponsor uh
representative Herndon is also
in the room, um, and it didn't
know if she wanted to make
comment.
No, I don't have any. OK, thank
you.
All righty, um.
It's up to you. Do you want to
go into the amendment or do you
want us to go?
What would make more sense? Let
me see. I think we can do the
amendment after I think it would
make more sense let's do that.
OK, thank you. Let's go to, is
anybody here in opposition of
this bill.
The, the attendant is coming,
just wait one second. There we
go.
OK, one minute for comment.
He'll hold it.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, and Kevin Graham,
general counsel for the
regulation and licensing
department, as many of you
probably know the regulation and
licensing department has a
number of administratively
attached boards and commissions
and the board of barbers and
cosmetology is one of those, um,
the FIR that was submitted by
the RLD when those come in and
the effective board commission,
we contact the board and
commission and we get their
input. I would just point you to
that FIR the uh analysis that
was provided and the board of
barbers and cosmetology was
strongly opposed to the bill,
uh, the FA.
The RLD does not take position
on that, but board clearly did,
and so I just bring that to your
attention.
Thank you.
Anybody on Zoom?
Miss.
Just put their hand up.
OK.
Nobody on you?
Yeah.
Already. Anybody in favor?
If you want to speak, please
come to the middle. The
attendant will hold the
microphone and you have one
minute.
Madam Chair and members of the
committee, I am uh Doctor Billy
Divetti.
I'm the data analyst for the
Office of Equity and Inclusion
for the city of Albuquerque.
I come from a family of uh
breeders, and I'm testifying in
support of husband Bill 281.
This is my story. My wife and
two daughters and a niece
accomplished a breeders. I have
a son who has locks.
However, we cannot easily find
natural hair breeders around.
Because of the license
requirements around the city.
In the interim, we are forced to
import natural hair products
from Africa to supplement for
some natural hair and beauty.
That's very expensive.
Unsustainable and it doesn't
really come out as supposed to
be. Thank you.
Madam Chair, and esteemed
members of the committee. My
name is Ashley Williams, and I'm
a member of the community,
greater and natural stylist.
My entrance into the hair
industry came in childhood as a
as a competitive swimmer. The
chlorine and the perm chemicals
did not mix so to protect my
hair, I wore box braids.
As I matured, my need to self
express grew beyond my mother's
braiding skills, so naturally I
began to style my own hair, and
everyone else's.
By the time I reached college, I
was supplementing my income with
with my braiding skills, but
That is where I stopped because
of the barrier that we are
addressing today.
Reading is a cultural practice
past generationally, not a
chemical-based skill requiring a
full cosmetology license creates
unnecessary obstacles for talent
and stylists. My goal today is
to help change that by
advocating for the
declassification of the natural
hair.
Of natural hair from cosmetology
regulation so that both
practitioners and consumers can
thrive. Please support House
Bill 281. Thank you for your
time.
Madame Chair Gallegos and
members of the committee.
My name is Marjorie Germaine. I
am a proud public servant who
has served both state and city
level.
When I am not working in an
office, I serve my community
with my skills of hair braiding.
Having learned that skill from
my mother at a very young age,
I've been braiding for over 35
years. As a black woman, hair
braiding is a reflection of our
shared culture.
Air breathing starts as an
ancestral custom.
An artistic expression. For me,
Breeding here is therapeutic.
Today I'm asking for a full
exemption for licensure.
For, for our cultural practice
of hair braiding.
The hours required for
certification should not hinder
those who are passionate.
About our craft.
Please
Let's uplift natural air
breeders and celebrate our
crown. Thank you for your time.
Madame Chair Garrigos and
representatives. My name is
Diale Foukon and uh I'm from the
city of Rio Rancho.
I'll be talking to you about the
economic benefits of
And breathing
In the state of New Mexico.
There are approximately 300 hair
breeders in the state of New
Mexico.
On average
Here that's make a minimum of
$28,000 and this is without
going to cosmetology school.
Approximately over $8 million is
generated into the economy from
hair braiding.
And we know when money is given
to households that tends to
reduce crime in the community.
When community members are
engaged in the process of making
a policy change like the hair
braiding bill.
281 and
When this community members are
involved in the operations of
the government.
We know it, it improves the
well-being of community members.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Mara Tubman, and I am a
student at the University of New
Mexico. I am a person who has
braids, and I do my own braids,
and I did not go to cosmetology
school. I learned through
generations of women teaching me
how to braid hair. And sometimes
I braid hair so I can afford
groceries for the week as a
student, and many of my peers do
that and we're moving this
requirement would allow me to
get through school and, you
know, enjoy opportunities like
this I've been shadowing under
Rep Hernon.
And I wouldn't be able to do
that if I didn't have the
resources to provide for myself.
So please support this bill.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name's Alexandria
Taylor, and I'm commenting on
from a personal experience being
born and raised as a black New
Mexican, um, systemic injustice
persists, and I want to
acknowledge the comments in the
FIR in which no black
professionals were consulted in
creating that analysis, um,
these services when they wrote
that they opposed this bill
because of the hygiene concerns,
um, but yet couldn't quantify
how many lticians and hair
braiders, they actually
License. I think that says a
lot. The FIR also says that the
impact would be an indeterminate
and minimal cost, and I can
assure you as a black woman
who's been growing my locks for
6 years and has had this hair
all my life. No one knows what's
more safe for us than us. Thank
you.
Hello, my name is Eugene
Pickett.
I've been getting my hair
braided since 1970.
So I'm a consumer, you know, and
um my stylist.
Share with me a a visit that she
had from a licensing.
And she was nervous. They're
like, they're gonna put me out
of business. So I was like, I do
not want to come to your house
to get my hair braided.
I prefer coming to her very
clean shop.
You know it's an experience.
Someone mentioned it's
therapeutic when I get an hour
off a month or hour, maybe an
hour and a half is like.
My brain is getting therapy.
Cause I don't have to think
about anything else.
The touch is therapeutic is
magical.
And I think they're like today,
I, I like signs usually when I'm
talking to commissions of, oh
excuse me, Madam Chair.
In a commission
Um, usually, um, I'm, I'm
advocating for small farmers and
ranchers.
Um
So my thought is that
This is very significant.
On the last day of Black History
Month.

can. You have one minute.

I earned a certificate to
practices 14 years ago, but
unfortunately, I have severe
limitations on my earning
potential due to
a law that mandate that I get a
cosmetology license
to practice and locks.
I bless people with brains and
services with still passed down
for generations as a cultural
cultural tradition.

Hannah
Hi, Madam Chair and
representatives of the
committee. I hope you all can
hear me. My name is Hanaya, and
I would just like to speak in
support of Bill 281.
And I would like to say that I
myself began using hairstyling
as a way to so the poor myself
through college and to build a
meaningful connections with
others, um, I learned my
hairstyle skills
through generational teaching
from other people um within my
community.
As here as a part time,
um, so job as a means of
financially supporting myself
throughout college as a stress
reliever and a way to make
meaningful connections with
others.
This impacts me and many of my
other friends who are trying to
support themselves financially.
In Mexico does not teach the
care of curly hair and I don't
believe they should profit off
of it, um.
And the claim of teaching care
protectured hair.
I also believe that
Additionally, the practice of
natural care care is very sacred
and cultural and to not profited
off by institutions that don't
teach it history or how to
properly care for it. Thank you.
That is all. Thank you. OK, go
back to the sponsor. Do you want
to now, um, should we move your
amendment. Yes, please, Madam
Chair, that is amendment 2
0.231355.
You, so moved, um.
Anybody second? OK.
Will you explain the amendment,
please? Certainly. So um.
As the amendment says, if you
turn to page 7.
Of the bill lines 9 through 11,
the purpose of section.
Was to ensure that anybody who
had been, um, cited for braiding
without a license prior to when
this bill would go into effect,
should they then decide to go to
cosmetology school to learn
traditional barbering styles
that they would not then be.
Continued to be punished for the
previous citation, but the way
the language is laid out in the
bill was um.
Labeled confusing in the
previous committee, so I decided
that an amendment simply
striking suspended revoked to
just a license shall not be
denied being licensed for
barbering and cosmetology, just
made for a cleaner passage,
Madam Chair.
So does anybody have any
questions on the amendment? Uh.
OK.
Move to adopt any opposition?
is adopted.
All righty. Back onto the bill.
Any questions on the bill?
Representative Matthews.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair and
thank you all for the
presentation and your beautiful
hair with us, um, I just want to
clarify something, what you're
asking that you not be required
to get the state.
Uh
Cosmetology.
Licensing, correct?
Uh, you're not talking about
because you're from the city of
Albuquerque.
If you were doing this to earn
money in a in a location, you
would still get an Albuquerque
business license.
I mean, are you
Is that an issue here?
Yes, madam Chair Representative,
um, if you were going to be
braiding to support yourself and
if that is your living in a a
business license would still be
required. This is just removing
the state licensure to.
Say that you're qualified to
braid.
OK. Uh,
That's all my questions.
Thank you. uh, Chair de la Cruz.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Madam Chair, I'm
not really clear.
Why, why the need for this
particular bill and the reason
that I'm not clear, and this is
where you can help me.
So
You have
Uh, a, a type of of of hair
styling, braiding.
That
is also a business.
Ah
And regardless of the culture
for now.
Because hair has been dealt with
for.
Since the dawn of time.
So that being said, is there?
there is the test itself, the
licensure that's required does
not address braiding specific.
Specifically, or is that if you
go to cosmetology school, they
can't teach you that, that's
what I'm not clear on.
Yes, ma'am, um, Chairman de la
Cruz, thank you very much for
that question, yeah, that is,
that is essentially the.
point of why this bill is being
brought forward to get a
cosmetology license.
Apart from it being
prohibitively expensive to
attend cosmetology school in
many cases, it also requires
1200 hours of in this case, what
would be braiding experience for
people who in most cases as Nema
laid out and as Dial laid out.
You have to show 1200 hours of
work for something that you
learned to do when you were
essentially 5 years old. And
lastly, I would like to point
out, um, as was highlighted in
the FIR and I believe the uh
analysis from the RLD as well.
The letter
That was sent
From the chair of the
cosmetology board.
We found to be quite
problematic.
She laid out reasons why.
Lessenger for braiding should be
required, excuse me, I'm very
upset. I need to calm down,
Madam Chair.
And in that letter.
Why brating should be should
require a license. I'll just
read you the short passage, if I
may. It says many hair braiders
incorporate chemical treatments
such as relaxers, bonding
adhesives, and other hair care
products that if misused and
cause scalp burns, allergic
reactions, and other serious
health concerns without proper
training and oversight, there is
an increased risk of harm not
only to the clients but also to
practitioners.
Regulations ensure that
individuals providing hair
services are adequately educated
on sanitation, product safety,
and client protection. If we're
talking about barbering,
shaving, things like that,
waxing, even that makes absolute
sense.
Or braiding, there is absolutely
no chemical treatment. Let
relaxers, most specifically,
Madam Chair Representative.
There is no instance where you
would relax a a textured hair
care like Timothy and I have
very similar hair textures.
There is no instance where you
would require a relaxer before
you braid because that very act
negates the reason why you're
braiding the hair in the first
place. Hair becomes harder to
braid if it is chemically
straightened or altered, the
whole point of braiding the hair
is to protect the natural
texture, the natural texture is
what makes.
braiding the hair easier, that
kinkiness of the hair keeps the
braids in place, so the fact
that this person chose to write
this letter completely
demonstrates the fact that they
have no idea, they do not
understand the process of
African American or textured
hair or how to treat it or how
to style it, so I do not
understand why then they would
require a license when they
don't know how to teach it.
Thank you and Cheer up. That,
that's a great point, um.
So it's, it's, well, let, let me
not get ahead.
If somebody goes in and they go
to a business to have their hair
braided.
Do they have to have their hair
shampooed, are there similar
processes prior to the breeding
itself that that would be
similar to any barber.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
many raiders, most raiders, when
you make an appointment, they
will lay out what is expected of
you before your appointment.
Many breeders require that you
shampoo, condition and I will
say detangle your hair before
you show up for your
appointment, and if not, many
breeders offer that service as
you arrive.
Um
There was, I don't know if it
was you, Madam Chair
Representative, if it was you or
someone else that said that
there were other states that
Did not have licensure.
Is that correct? So is that a
law or an exemption?
In those other states, Madam
Chair Representative, I will be
perfectly honest, I don't know
if that law was just if they're,
um.
If they're hair care laws just
didn't mention breeding when
they were drafted or if they've
passed laws to um exempt hair
braiders, I believe actually
Jordan, if you were still
online, you can be more detailed
with that answer.
Yeah, thanks, representative and
Madam Chair, Mr. Chairman,
I can touch on that. The 35
other states that have exempted
like uh excuse me, from the
licensure of cosmetology have
enacted legislation that didn't
just that it proactively
exempted it because breeding is
widely viewed as a safe service,
uh, one that is often not
covered in cosmetology school.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
I think the struggle that I
have.
Is is that.
I would almost say, why license
anybody?
You know, look at my hair, not
much to do with it.
But I have to go to a barber.
And that barber has to have a
license.
And
That barber that I go to is
generational barber. I used to
go to his dad before him.
So
I think when I'm struggling with
is that I understand what you're
saying, Representative Madam
Chair.
At the same time, I struggle
with that idea of of the
exemption because you could
almost say that for anybody,
really.
And the other part to it is that
it seems that the licensing
process, the cosmetology schools
have been a failure.
Because in my estimation, they
should have.
You know, caught up with people
and their needs and their hair
care, which would include Brady.
And so
I, I'm supportive if, if there's
this gap, madam chair.
If there's a gap
And, and you can't, you can't go
to cosmetology school and
they're gonna teach you how to
braid hair right and care for
people's hair right as you were
describing earlier. It's a
process.
And so
That's the only way I'm sure
that I was supported because
otherwise we'd have to, in my
estimation, exempt to everybody.
So it's kind of I'm not sure
which comes first, the, the,
the.
Part of the horse
Uh, but in, in absence of real
schooling, real training that
then tests for that particular.
Here activity
Seems like
There's no other option for
that.
Thank you Madam Chair.
Madam,
thank you, um, Chairman, uh, de
la Cruz, I very much understand
where you're coming from, I
think one important distinction
I would make is when we're
talking about barbering, you
know, your everyday
hairstylists, they do use.
Potentially very dangerous
chemicals, things like bleach
and relaxers and hair dyes that
if misused can cause and I've
seen it, cuz uh my very good
friend went to cosmetology
school and I've seen the
mistakes that the students make
and things can go really wrong
really fast when you're dealing
with bleach and hair dye and
relaxers, um, people have been
bald for months and it's very
embarrassing, um, however, as
that danger element is removed
here.
Madam Chair Representative, I
think that's really where the
space for um licenger exemption
falls, it's a safe.
I'm sure I might
So
Then what would
Prohibit somebody that does
braiding from doing anything
else.
What if, what if I go to.
A barber or or cosmetologist,
I'm sorry, that does rating.
But also just wants to give a
haircut or maybe dye somebody's
hair.
That'd be different then. And
how would you distinguish from
that or would there be separate
licensure for that like I am
only Brady.
I'm not gonna.
Cut your straight hair and I'm
not gonna shampoo and give you a
dye job.
How would we distinguish in that
regard?
Madam Chair.
I'm understanding you correctly.
And I'm not, I'm not positive
that I am, so please stop me if
I'm off track here, is this.
Just exempts people who just
want to braid.
So if you're going to see
somebody who does offer
haircuts.
Leech
Chemical coloring things of that
nature.
I, uh, they would still if even
if it's the same person.
Um, they would not have to.
Receive a license to braid, but
if they want to do traditional
barbering of any other sort.
Thank you, that helps me quite a
bit, madam chair, to, to try to
understand the distinction
because like if I go to uh
change my oil, they might change
the oil in my car, they might do
the air filter, but they're not
gonna, you know, put new tires
on, and some do, some will do it
all.
So I, I think that that has to
be real clear and as long as
that's there, I'm supportive.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Madam Chairman de la Cruz.
Thank you, Chairman Luntu.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative. Thank you
experts on your presentation
this afternoon. Uh thank
Chairman De la Cruz on, on his
clarifications and a lot of
these things, I think he ends,
you answered a lot of the
questions that I had, but uh
when I heard it more, I was
like,
I I don't, I don't think is a
Would you call a lactologist?
Titian,
you're not holding a straight
razor to give me a shave.
You're not holding scissors.
To braid my hair, right? So
there's a huge distinction. I
apologize for in that I chopped
that up bad. I apologize
just add that to the bill,
please. Uh, madam, madam chair
and, and representative, the the
the gentleman in the back stood
up in opposition and, and I
don't want to.
point you out, but are you from,
I just did. God, I'm, I'm
betting really bad today. Um.
Are, are you from the board of
of barbers and cosmetologists.
Is that who you said you were
from?
Yes, sir.
I'm counsel for the.
OK.
OK.
And then that's, I, I just
really wanted, Madam Chair and
and representative, and, and the
reason why I asked you is in our
FIR fiscal implications is that
it would reduce revenue to the
Board of Barbers and
cosmetologists fund.
Um
What's the fun now?
The
Uh, the fun now is a
non-reverting fund for barbers
and cosmetology, um, just about
all of the administratively
attached agencies we have have
an individual, um, non-reverting
fund that comes in, we could not
tell you exactly how much it was
gonna cost. OK, so at this point
then when you talk about the
revenue that this fund may, may
miss.
You don't know if you're gonna
miss it.
You don't even know what you're
missing.
I think that's accurate. OK.
Thank you I appreciate that. And
so then, Madam Chair and
Representative, I
As an indigenous brother, um, I,
I recognize that I was taught
that.
Here is power, right? Your hair
is your power. You don't, no one
touches it except yourself or
somebody you let touch it. And
so when we talk about, I listen
to this this this discussion and
it, it aggravated me too for a
number of reasons because I've
sat in that chair for a number
of times and I've talked about
language integration into public
schools, and I've talked about
How can, you know, they don't,
they don't teach me Twa language
in a public school. That's why
this state needs to do this on
our behalf and pay for it,
right? And I heard your, your
frustration. I'm like, I've been
there.
And I know what you're talking
about when, when you, when you,
when people are suggesting to
you.
That you need to be a
cosmetologist or go to these
classes to do what you already
know.
What your ancestor taught you
what to do best.
And someone else is coming down
and saying nope, we know better
than them, we will make you go
to school. It's infuriating.
And so that being said, Madam
Chair, I, I, I, I think for all
those reasons.
And how I started is that you
don't use scissors to braid
hair. You're not holding a
straight razor to braided hair
and from, from this.
I call it a disgusting letter
that.
Chair the last name I don't, I
don't wanna, I don't wanna.
chop up either.
It it just further like insults.
Right, the practice, and, and,
and, and the people really. So
for those reasons, Madam Chair,
I, I look forward to supporting
this initiative. Thank you.
Thank you, Chairman, Chairwoman
Serato.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative for bringing
this bill forward for a number
of reasons. Um, I wanted to note
that every single commenter
today talked about their
experience learning to braid
hair at home and not a
cosmetology school, and I think
that reflects a lot of what is
trying to be achieved here as
well. So I have some, some
clarifying questions that I
think are also just to be really
clear on some of these pieces. I
do have one brief question,
Madam Chair and Representative,
you, you've moved a section on
eyebrow threading.
Madam Chair, uh, representative,
is that just clean up or what
was the purpose of that?
Um, yeah, Madam Chair
representative, thank you that.
came from the drafter and he
moved that section because he
believed it was just cleaner.
Just more consistent in the
language that I'm chaired
representatives
Just more consistent in the
language that I'm chair
representative makes sense.
Um, and so I, I'm curious, Madam
Charter representative, are
there, uh, opticians who are
currently practicing without
having gone to cosmetology
school and having a license.
Madam Chair Representative, I
definitely, Madam Chair and
representative, part of that is
a concern for me in the sense
that these regulations don't
make sense. If people aren't
following them anyways because
they aren't practical to their
daily work. They aren't
undermining their business,
they're not endangering their
ability to practice without
being sued.
etc. like that's why we have
these regulations to set amount
of standards so that, you know,
everyone can expect. But people
do do go to unlicensed aticians
to get their hair taken care of.
Is that correct? Correct. And
Madam Chair and Representative
and, and to me it seems that
most people are getting most of
the training at home. I do want
to go to the, the letter that um
we, you referenced and um and
pointed out to why uh you're one
of my favorite debaters to
watch, uh, but I wanted to point
out it says here without proper
training and oversight, there's
an increased risk of harm not
only to clients, but also to
practitioners.
I'm curious, Madam Chair and
Representative.
It sounds like they're not
offering training to opticians
for braiding.
Using these chemicals anyways.
So if they're not offering this
training here.
Then, then how does that fix it?
Does that question make sense,
Madam Chair and Representative?
It does, madam Chair
Representative, um.
The short answer is I'm not
sure.
Um, I will tell you a quick
tidbit and like I can see Tim's
like really twitching to jump
in, so I will definitely let him
speak his piece on this, um, I,
I cannot speak for every
cosmetology school in the state
because I know for a fact that
at least one, although I could
not tell you the name, does
allege to teach hair braiding
and did some sort of section on.
Um, African textured hair,
however, I went to a braider who
learned how to braid in
cosmetology school and
unequivocally that was the worst
hair braiding experience I have
had in my entire life, um.
As
As you can see from the young
lady who spoke earlier, who
braids her own hair, braids end
in a natural taper, as they do,
and somehow when this uh young
man who braided my hair, um.
Every braid as cause we
frequently use synthetic hair,
that's how when you guys met me,
my hair was like down to my
butt, it is not naturally that
long, um, somehow many half of
the braids that he like they
ended at different lengths, they
ended bluntly instead of a
natural taper, I sat in a salon
with his license on the wall for
the better part of 6 or 7 hours
to have the worst hairstyle of
my life. I paid my $350 I
went home, I cried and I took
them out.
So
What are we doing here?
Madam Chair representative,
thank you so much, Tim, um, if
you'd like to answer as well.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. I totally forgot
the question.
Madam Chair and Representative
and expert, uh.
OK. Well, uh, so, so, uh, that's
fine. We'll, we'll move on from
there. Um, I wanted to just, uh,
appreciate that you brought
forward this bill overall
though, um, and I think it shows
the impact of what it means to
have a body that reflects what
the state looks like more so,
Madam Chair and Representative,
um, because again, there's a,
there's a lack of knowledge that
exists without anyone speaking
up. So I appreciate you and your
colleagues bringing it forward.
Thank you.
Thank you. uh, Representative
Mason, and you know, I'm gonna
caution you with all the the
locks on your head that where to
go with this.
I'm gonna try to get a discount.
Madam Chair representative, uh.
He's right. I have no background
in this at all.
But I do have a few questions,
Madam Chair Representative.
And it and I'll have to be the
first to say I didn't do a good
job of studying this bill before
committee.
But uh
Madam Chair Representative.
As a writer are you required to
have a license as a writer.
The writers is their licensing
process.
Outside of the cosmetology.
Proved to
General public
that you are a licensed writer
I do not believe so, Liener
required for hair braiders is
the cosmetology license.
Oh.
Apart from Madam Chair, if I may
clarify, if you are operating as
a hair braiding business, then
you would have a business
license as well, but this bill
does not address.
Any changes to business licenser
procedure.
So if you have a business, you
have to.
You have a regular business
license. Well, that's something,
but uh I guess my.
Madam Chair Representative.
My take on it is uh.
It's more protection for
consumers.
You know, I moved to a town I
don't know any of y'all.
I'm looking for a hair braider.
I might get the one you got.
You know, it, uh, so it looks
like to me if we're gonna
require anybody to have a
license.
Why not if you're, if it's a
business, if you're charging
money and you're.
could be paying your
BTR on your income and all of
that there should be some kind
of license and.
Involved
Protect the consumer.
Armchair representative, yes, I
understand that point, um, but.
Without beating the dead horse
that my very worst instant was a
licensed raider, um, and I don't
know that a licenger necessarily
always protects consumers from a
bad experience, I mean.
Madam Cha represented, oh, I
agree to that, a license in
anything doesn't even your
doctor doesn't necessarily mean
you're getting a good one.
But
It where we require.
A barber to have a license we
require this to have a license
and not have a license. I, I
don't disagree on not having to
go.
through their through their
school for your.
profession.
But it looks like to me your
profession should have some.
Guidelines as to who
I
qualified
A board or something that you
have to go through or something,
you know, I'm, I'm just against
we license everybody else why
are we giving you all a free
pass with no license.
Madam Chair Representative, I
believe Tim would like to answer
this question.
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
thank you so much,
Representative Mason, great
question.
Um
The scenario you gave us was
wonderful if you came into town
and you didn't know anybody,
right? You needed to be
directed. Uh, we believe that
the free market.
Um, we'll, we'll correct itself,
right? So if you give good hair
or if you were good at lock
logician or a hair braider, the
community.
It's going to to direct you to
the best, right? And we within
our own community also take a
lot of pride in apprenticeship.
And making sure that this
generational practice is passed
down, right? So we have our
elders who are doing it all the
way going down to our children.
So I just wanted to say that,
um just just like representative
said here, um, the licensure is
is not going to protect the
consumer, especially since we're
not using any chemicals.
Thank you so much.
Madam Chair Representative, if
we may of Jordan would like to
address this as well.
uh, Jordan, I have a hard time
hearing you.
I don't know sorry Jordan would
like to.
Madam Chair and representative,
uh
thank you uh as the the leading
policy experts in this space at
the Institute for Justice. I'd
like to remind the committee
that there's a lot of data, um,
to back this up, uh, I mentioned
35 states have already exempted,
um, this practice from er and we
monitor that closely and the
data reflects that no increase
in harm to the public as has
developed as a result.
that. Uh, additionally, our, our
legal argument, um, that we have
taken to a number of states to
courts on, on laws similar to
this is that uh the government
we believe the government well
in the constitutional principle
that the government has a
rational basis to uh um regulate
a a practice or a um a person's
right to earn a living. And in
this case, in a
that it is deemed safe, um, we
believe that the government does
not have a place to to regulate
this industry. And, and as I
mentioned, one, cases in similar
instances across the country.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, representative, and I agree
too and I didn't ask them to
regulate you. I was asking.
Whether you had to have a
license.
there's a difference between.
A regulatory body that tells you
exactly what to do and just
I mean,
On your
Just like a business license. I
mean it's a license.
And I'm just
License everything.
After
And my wife have a lot.
Mhm
Required.
But uh, but at that, I will, I
guess I'm through with
questions. I don't.
Thank you. Is that from the
committee
Yes. Um, I'm gonna take a little
bit different approach. I'm, I'm
supportive of this bill because
it supports small business.
And, and I, and I think that's
really, really important in a
state with limited economic
opportunities and it supports
small businesses and the ability
to earn a living in communities
that probably need those
opportunities.
Most. So, um, and I also have
maybe a slightly different
reason. I've raised two girls,
and so, um, I was pretty good at
French braid and it might be
that I could actually qualify
for this. You never know, the
oil business can sometimes turn
pretty dark.
And uh
In the, in, and the last reason
is, is that um I don't want
there to be any shortage of
establishments that uh my friend
uh Representative Mason may need
to go. Thank you.
Madam Chair Representative, they
usually, um, you can get a
pretty good weave or a wig as
well.
Thank you all, well, I thank you
for your presentation. I, I
think that, um, hair braiding
can be a deeply cultural
experience and and I think it
invokes a lot of emotion because
it is generational and we bring
it through, um, our, our mothers
and our grandmothers and you
know, we want to pass that down,
so I, I, I appreciate that, um,
with that, do we have a uh
motion from the committee.
his.
Oh.
Wow.
Oh, as a,
OK, guys, come on, come on,
OK, we've got to do past. Do we
have a second?
But
to take the role.
Representative Armstrong?
of De la Cruz? Representative
Hernandez. Representative
Valente.
Representative Mason
Representative Matthews.
Uh, yes, but I do wonder if you
can do it with white short hair,
but maybe not.
Representative Murphy, yes,
Representative Parajon.
Representative Serrado.
Madam Vice Chair, Madam Chair,
Madam Chair, final tally for the
DuPass as amended motion. 10
votes, yes, 0 votes, no.
Humanitarian committee members.
HB 421 is next.
OK, if we can get our next group
up, we are.
We still have 3 more bills.
3.
Party's over, Linda's back.
move fast now.
All right.
HB 421.
Madam Chair, we do have a
substitute. I'd like to of
course you do.
To eat.
Alrighty, let's hear about
yourself.
So he moves up for discussion.
So.
Thank you, Madam Chair, this is
uh 231116.2.
Great, so the committee
substitute addresses some of the
concerns that were brought
forward by TRD, uh, and
essentially ensures that, um,
this is a workable program. What
this bill does is it does, it
ensures the businesses that are
taking steps to protect
themselves and investing in
security, um, tools and
operations, um, uh, are able to
see it in uh receive an instant
rebate.
Uh, so what it does is that we
have definitions, uh, vendors
have to receive a certificate,
and then what happens is, is
that if they offer a rebate of
at least 25% on business
security solutions, I can say,
um, then they, uh, will receive
an instant they will receive a a
a tax rebate from uh TRD and
then that is applied directly on
the price for the consumer who
the business consumer who is
purchasing this uh business
security solution. Um, they'll
have to uh report back on this
in section 6.
requires, and that is included
in the tax bill and that section
7. And so truly all of the the
committee substitute does is um
it clarifies, um, that the
department will certify vendors
as eligible to receive a rebate
or deduction from GRT and then,
um, section 4 ensures that will
not exceed $25,000 per year. Um,
and then it creates the fund
and, and it cleans that language
up as well and with that my
experts today are Alex Greenberg
with the governor's office and
also um our friend from
RLD,
do you want to add any comments
to this as well?
I'm sorry, Kevin Graham, who
regulation licensing department,
we'd be happy to take questions
uh about anything maybe his.
And with that we stand for
questions. Thank you. Do we have
anybody here in support of the
bill?
OK, we can.
Line up and.
You have a minute?
Thank you, Madam Secretary, if
you'd like to begin. Thank you.
Good evening, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
here in support of this bill.
Um, tax and rev stands ready to
partner with our friends at RLD.
RLD will administer the rebate
that goes to the certified
vendors for their discounted
sales, and then we will
administer the grocery receipts
tax deduction. So what happens
with the consumer is, is that if
they uh if the business is
purchasing these security uh
pieces of equipment or services,
they can receive a 25 or more%
discount on the services
themselves.
But then they're also not being
passed along the GRT which we
know can be anywhere from say 6
to 9% across New Mexico. There's
two types of savings and we
think this is a great way to
support our local businesses.
Thank you. Thank you.
Good evening, chair members of
the committee. My name is Alison
Riley, public policy director at
the New Mexico Chamber of
Commerce, and we strongly
support House Bill 421. This
legislation is a vital economic
development tool that helps
local businesses improve their
security at a reduced cost by
creating a dedicated fund to
provide rebates for discounted
security equipment and services.
This bill lowers operational
expenses and encourages
investment and further safety
improvements. With the GRT
deduction in place, companies
can further reduce costs,
allowing them
to allocate more resources
towards innovation and job
creation. Hospital 421 provides
a practical, cost-effective
solution that directly benefits
businesses and the communities
they serve, and we urge your
support. Thank you. Thank you.
Good evening, Madam Chair,
members, my name is Isaac
Romero, deputy cabinet secretary
for the Economic Development
Department, uh, EDD stands in
support of this for all the
reasons stated before, uh, this
is a really good opportunity and
uh initiative for small
businesses and we encourage that
good policy to um grow and
support our business. Thank you.
Thank you. Do we have anybody on
Zoom?
Adam Silverman.
Uh, yes, hello, uh, Madam Chair
and thank you so much for
allowing me to speak. I'm the
president of the board for EIP
for 2025, commercial real estate
development association in our
state.
I'm here to support household
421. I not only for our members
but also for the commercial
property owners. Is this, uh,
for bringing it forward due to
the rising property crime in our
businesses are doing anything
and everything they can to
protect their property and the
security measures can become.
Very expensive, especially when
you need cameras not only on the
outside of your business but
also on the inside to be able to
convict criminals for something
that they've done.
For example, we have a real-time
monitors uh cameras, but you can
only access these with high-end
cameras the software system, so
you need really good cameras and
security measures having a
rebate for these upgraded
systems a real win for small
business in our state until we
get the crimes under control,
get some relief to property
owners throughout our state. Our
commercial.
Association and I hope you guys
pass this one. Thank you.
Thank you. Alrighty, do we have
anybody in opposition?
Anybody on Zoom?
OK.
Uh, let's go to the committee.
Uh, representative Murphy.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative and.
Experts, um, curious on, on why
you're approaching.
Um, this, this way, and, and,
and let me see if I, I
understand it. Um.
You have vendors are basically
suppliers of security equipment
and services they're going to
come into my home or my business
and they're going to install
that.
And I would, I, I would think
that
What part of the underlying.
The goal here is to get.
Security systems and there's
many places as we can we have a
crime issue and so perhaps it
helps at least and gently, I
guess, um, address that issue.
Um, but why wouldn't you just
simply give uh a tax credit or a
tax break to the business or the
individual as opposed to going
through the vendor, uh, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative. The
goal is to get the savings to
the businesses as soon as
possible so that they're able to
install their security, um, as
soon as possible, as we know
businesses are already making
these investments, we want them
to be able to feel that they're
affordable as as possible so it
is a bit of a creative solution
to make that happen.
Madam Chair, Representative, and
experts. I think I just, I think
it just maybe occurred to me. So
basically, if under my methods,
call it the tax credit or, or
whatever a person would have to
wait some period of time until
they could either get that
rebate or take it off their
taxes.
So what you're doing here is
basically incentivizing the
vendors to discount it.
And then, and then giving them a
tax break for that discount.
Have I got it now, that's
correct.
And Madam sure that concludes my
questions. Thank you,
Representative experts.
Uh, Chairman Lenton.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative. I, I'm, I'm
trying to look at your committee
substitute. And so this is for
business and residential or just
business? Madam Chair
Representative, it's just for
businesses. OK, Madam Chair and
Representative, uh, why not add
residential to this?
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
this was a difficult bill in
terms of scope creep. Uh, we're
trying to limit the amount of uh
possible you know, utility, but
the main impetus was economic
development upside that this
might be going to catalyze and
while residential security is
certainly important. Uh, we
didn't want.
to be depleted by
non-businesses, um, especially
sort of as uh
Sort of underlying premises
tested initially.
Got it. So Madam Chen
representative and an expert and
you, you recognize though that
that crime doesn't just happen
at businesses, crime happens at
residential properties as well,
but you still elected to just go
after businesses through this.
Yep, Madam Chair, yes, that's
that's correct. Thank you. And
Madam Chairs representative,
then, uh, because this is an
agency bill, um, I'm looking at
page number 6 under
appropriations and it's a $100
million is appropriated.
Already? Madam Chair
Representative.
Madam Chair Representative, yes,
this is in the fund already and
uh just to note this actually is
3 committee referrals. It will
be going to tax because of the
tax rebate aspect and also to
appropriations for the fund
aspect representative.
Madam Madam Chair
Representative, I, I thought
because it was in the, in the
appropriation that the tax was
off the hook, but you still have
to come to tax then.
OK. All right, thank you, Madam
Chair.
Anybody else, uh, Representative
Matthews.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative and.
EDD, um, where did
How did you arrive at 100
million?
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
we had a case study that showed
um there's a chain restaurant in
our state that has uh many
locations throughout the state
and they spend an average of
$144,000 per location per year,
um, and so you could see where
that cost would add up and
really hurt into the profit
margins and so we were trying to
figure out a number that would
be palatable for the legislature
but still meaningful for small
businesses throughout our
country or excuse me throughout
the state, um, about 355,000 New
Mexicans are employed by local
businesses and we want to make
sure that when we're recruiting
and trying to
retained businesses or expand
them that they have the security
needed in order for them and
their workers to feel
comfortable.
Um
And that uh Madam Chair, um.
The 100 million was will that
meet all the needs with that.
Get everybody started but won't
finish the job. I mean, I'm
trying to get a sense of what
How much security is this going
to buy us?
Madame Chair Representative, I
think part of that solution is
in the amendment to cap it at
25,000 per uh business on that
and again it should there be
funding at the end of 3 years,
it would revert revert back into
the general fund.
Madam Chair, uh, representative.
Is there a
I'm sorry, I'm trying to get
through this pretty quickly
here. Is there some kind of a
Um, business size that's
required.
In a sole practitioner, a sole
proprietor.
Um
Apply for this funding.
Madam Chair Representative, I
just want to refer you to the
definition of business, and it
starts at the bottom of page one
and and that would be included,
but it's really any location
where business is conducted,
including a real estate
development site or other space,
and that's the, that's the
locations where you would expect
it to be applied, but it is not
limited against LLCs or they're
not excluded, Madam Chair and
Representative and Madam Chair,
Representative does it require
What about a company like?
I'm sorry, a company like Intel.
Uh, are we going to provide
physical security for a company
like Intel.
Madam Chair Representative,
that's why we decided to cap it
at $25,000 per business. Uh, so
they wanted to apply for the 1st
$100,000 of their security
services or products uh to be
discounted, they would qualify.
So, uh, Amazon, Intel, Madam
Chair, representative, the the
large provider, the large
providers, the large, uh.
Employers here, the large
national businesses would,
would, is there any preference
for locally owned businesses or
smaller businesses, Madam Chair
Representative, as it stands,
any business that is looking to
invest in the safety of their
company, um, could get up to
$25,000 of a rebate, and it was
really offered through the, the
vendor who's selling the
services, so they are not going
to discriminate between those
businesses. That's really by the
certified vendor, um, that that
process will be through.
Madam Chair, uh, representative,
this isn't gonna be like the
rebates we were giving for
people who were putting um
Um
What do you call them?
Um
Solar panels on their roofs.
And they were told that there
was a rebate available.
Uh, but the rebate.
When they, they signed the
contract, they put the stuff in,
they got a $20,000 bill when
they put the put the request in
for the $20,000 they were told
sorry, the rebate's gone.
And I mean, is there some notice
to these folks that
Um,
People, a lot of people were
really mad about that and got
themselves into debt for things
that they wouldn't have bought
otherwise, so I guess I'm asking
is there some protection here
that
We're not promising people a
rebate.
If the funds run out.
Madam Chair Representative, I
think the way this is structured
takes care of that because what
it would be is if I'm the, the
business owner if I have a small
restaurant and I want to get uh
a private patrol service to come
out and then I'm also gonna have
them install some new security
doors for me. The only question
is, is that private patrol
service one that is authorized
and and certified by the RLD as
being a qualified vendor 2 are
the is the equipment something
that has also been certified as
qualifying and then 3, the
business that either of the.
So the patrol service or the
provider of those doors have
they uh discounted the price by
25% or more for me, so the
person or the the business, the
restaurant buying the service
they're just gonna get a cheaper
service, 25% off on their
service, so they don't have to
wait around for a rebate. The
company who was applying and
would be also certified by the
RLD as participating in this
program would then uh come in
each year, September 1st and
file their request.
the rebate that would come in
and the way the bill is
structured as long as there's
money left in the fund they
could get up to $25,000 per
customer that they provided this
discount to in a rebate, so you
would not have a situation where
the individual like uh business
owner would ever be waiting on
the rebate, they're gonna get a
discounted price day one, Madam
Chair and representative, if I
can add to that, that's
September 1st deadline, I think
also protects against overspend
on this because, you know, what
you had with the solar program
was that people
were purchasing them through the
entire of the year and then next
year they're finding out it
didn't exist anymore. By having
that September date, Madam Chair
Representative, I believe that
secures against the funding. Um,
and I, I do have at least one
more question, uh, Madam Chair
Representative.
Um
Is there any requirement?
Um, that a business who gets
Uh,
The security system.
Paid for in part through this
process.
Is there any, is there any
requirement that they also carry
insurance to cover their losses.
And ensure
possibly even insure whatever
the security system is.
Uh, or.
Well, that's my question. Is
Any requirement that they
Protect the investment that
they're that the state is making
is helping them make, is what
I'm asking.
Madam Chair Representative, no,
there's not a requirement for
insurance, however, they are
still taking on the bulk of the
cost itself, and so, you know,
as any bookings would show you,
you know, the lost, the losses
over time on an investment, you
know, those would still be the
same factors in there especially
because they're still paying the
bulk of it.
And I think um I actually have
one more question, Madam Chair,
uh, representative, we can do
this every year.
Madame Chair Representative,
this fund is set up for 3 years,
um, and that's, that's when it
would expire after that point.
And then and the fund itself
would revert back to the general
fund, um, you know, should we
decide to bring this back again,
then we have a fun new debate in
3 years. OK. Thank you.
Representative Mason.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. I asked a couple
of questions here. One thing I
noticed in my analysis here, is
there already a
I stated the federal.
incentive program already
through the federal tax cut and
Jobs Act of 2017.
Business can ride off the full
cost.
Up to a million dollars for
purchases.
Really
Where we duplicating a process
here or adding to or?
Why not take the federal funds?
Madam Chair Representative, I
think that's the reason it's a
vendor rebate and not a tax
credit in itself so that a small
business who may not have the
tax liability to offset that
cost would have um be able to
receive a discount for their
business at the point of sale in
real time.
Thank you, Representative, uh,
Madam Chair, uh, Madam Chair,
representative, I guess I'll.
Leave that there was one thing
that bothers me on discounts.
Is who sets the baseline price?
How do we know?
That, uh
I guess I have a little larceny
in my.
And how they all get together
and jack it up.
30% then take 25% off, Madam
Chair Representative, I'm gonna
hand it over to Mr. Graham, and
the reason why is that the big,
the big piece of this that makes
this work is that it's a
certified vendor who could apply
for that. And so part of that
process will go through RLD I'll
go and hand it over to Mr.
Graham.
Adam here represented Mason that
will be part of the duties of
the RLD to be setting up this
certification process, so we
would have to set up an
application process to become
certified, uh, to either offer
the services or the, the
equipment that's there, we'll
have to set up a system for
deciding what types of equipment
will be approved there and
obviously that will be one of
the parts that we'll have to
also to develop is trying to
make sure that a 25%, uh, you
know, price cut really is a 25%
price cut.
gonna pose some challenges for
us. It's not something we've
done before with the RLD, um,
and you know, we noted in the
fiscal impact and there's gonna
be some some cost to set this up
the first year, there's gonna be
cost to run it each year because
it is going to be a totally new
program for us, but that would
be part of what we would have to
develop is some sort of a
criteria for making sure that
those businesses are truly
offering a discounted service or
discounted product.
Thank you, thank you, uh, Madam
Chair, Madam Chair
representative, uh.
You said the word there that I
really hate in these bills.
Let's try.
You know, with
It
Try and hope or
Words that I don't like to see
when we're describing the
outcome of legislation that
we're getting ready to vote on.
You know, it uh
We're spending taxpayer money.
We like to make sure that it is.
Used
In the right way, it and I, I
have, I have hope.
But
That you can pull that off.
It, uh
There's
There's always
Somebody just if if there's a
loophole or somebody's gonna try
to fall through it.
It uh
But uh
I think that was about.
That's
01 thing
And I'm, I'm sure it's not in
here and it won't ever be in
here, but.
To me, it's kind of a
That
take off a lot of people say,
I just purchased
$20,000 worth of security
equipment.
Now
I'm not eligible for any of
these funds.
You know, was the only thing I
say that I like better about a
credit other than I.
I realized why y'all did this.
But it could be retroactive to
somebody in the last 2 years
something.
apply for some help on the
system that they, they bought it
full price.
But anyway, I think that's all
today thank you.
Madam chair thank you.
With the
Legislation.
Thank you. Alrighty, what is the
Yes,
I move a do not pass on HB 421
and a do pass on house commerce
and Economic Committee
substitute for House Bill 421.
It's fast. All right, do we have
a second?
You've been practicing that.
All righty.
Hashtag.
Representative Armstrong.
Representative Dela Cruz,
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lee,
Representative Mason, yes,
Representative Matthews.
Yes
Representative Murphy, yes.
Parajan, Representative Serato,
Madam Vice Chair, and Madam
Chair. Madam Chair, final tally
10 votes, yes, 0 votes, no.
Thank you. Thank you.
OK, next up we have House Bill
370.
I believe.
We're passing out the amendment
right now.
Has everyone received the
amendment?
OK.
Go ahead, madam chair. Thank
you, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I do have an
amendment, but with your
permission, I would like to
introduce the bill and provide
context for the amendments so
that we all understand the
basics of the bill and the
clarification, the amendment
makes.
Great.
OK, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, the idea behind HB
370 is simple. Credentialing
authorizes um
Authority, sorry, um,
authorities.
Let me say that again.
Thank you credentialing
authorities of hospitals played
the role of ensuring health care
providers who treat patients in
the hospital, whether they are
employed by the hospital or not
are competent in their field and
that they follow the rules
established by the hospital for
patient safety.
However, if a provider meets all
the criteria established by
those bylaws, the hospital
should not be able to deny the
provider privileges or
credentials to the hospital
simply because the clinician may
not be an economic maybe an
economic competitor.
Access to hospital operating
rooms and continuing of patient
care by ensuring a provider can
have access to the hospital, I
can't read anymore. I'm tired.
Sorry, um, is is crucial
competent to the survival of our
community and independent
practices.
And that
That is what HB 307 does. It
ensures that hospitals cannot
deny privileges to a community
clinician who otherwise meets
all the criteria of the
hospital's by law, bylaws simply
for economic reasons. So Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
I do have an amendment which
I'll explain the 202 number is
231468.1.
Moved to adopt.
move to discuss.
Is there any discussion on the
amendment?
Or Madam Chair to explain the
amendment rather. Um, I'm gonna
have my my expert witness
explained the amendment.
Uh, Madam Chair and members of
the committee of the amendment
was discussed in the House
Health Committee, and it's
simply clarifies on page 3 line
4 at a hospital can continue to
consider the fact that a
provider may be a defendant in a
medical malpractice lawsuit in
the hospital's credentialing
process. This is what hospitals
currently do, it's absolutely
appropriate to consider a
provider safety record when
determining if they should be
credentialed at the hospital.
Um, Madam Chair members of the
committee House Bill 370.
Simply ensures that hospitals
cannot engage in what's called
economic credentialing and
aligns New Mexico with 17 other
states who have enacted similar
legislation to prevent economic
credentialing.
Economic credentialing is
basically when a hospital uses
economic criteria unrelated to
quality of care or professional
competency in determining an
individual's qualifications or
initial or continuing hospital
privileges, so the bill in front
of you and the amendment has
been a culmination of really
great feedback from Loveless
Hospital and representative
Anaya in the health committee,
um, it ensures patient safety at
the forefront can be
operationalized by hospitals and
it protects.
Access for our community
providers to their local
hospitals so they can continue
to treat patients. And with
that, I'm happy to answer any
questions. I should probably
make sure you know I'm Carrie
Robin Bruder with the New Mexico
Medical Society. Thank you. And
with that, Madam Chair, we stand
for questions. Thank you. Is
there anyone in the room in
support of the bill?
OK, please make your way to the
center of the room, the
attendant will hold the
microphone for you and you have
one minute.
You got it. Thank you, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
Linda Siegel representing the
Greater Albuquerque Medical
Association, and we support this
bill, but I want to speak for
myself personally for a minute,
because I've lived in this
community for 43 years, uh when
we only had one hospital and
the, the incident that has sort
of resulted in this bill had to
do with a hospital and a a
private, a group of providers
who became a private group who
used to work at the hospital.
And suddenly, they are no longer
qualified to work at that
hospital. And, you know, we're a
growing community we need
options and we need, if you, if
you're the patient of one of
these providers who no longer
has privileges at the hospital,
that provider cannot come to the
hospital and treat you. They can
come and visit you, but they
can't treat you, and that is
simply wrong. Thank you.
Thank you, Patrick. Is there
anyone on Zoom?
OK. Is there anyone here to
speak in opposition of the bill.
Anyone on Zoom?
OK.
All right.
We're back on the amendment.
Is there a motion to adopt,
Madam chair, I moved to adopt
the amendment. Is there a
second?
Wonderful. You haven't adopted
or adopted amendment.
Thank you. OK, and on to the
committee.
Our discussion represented
Mason.
Thank you Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative, uh.
Not too many questions on this
stuff.
Pretty straightforward. Thank
you for bringing this forward. I
think it's a really.
My doctors at home really like.
the independent doctors.
You know, we've had this
problem, Madam Chair represented
for years.
Uh
Like I don't know if I had a I
had a doctor in 40 years that
was licensed to practice in the
hospital.
Every time you go to the
hospital, you have to get
another doctor.
But uh
And I can see
You know, it, uh
We don't, we want good doctors
at our hospitals.
But also
I would like for my doctor to be
able to come to the hospital.
And uh with that I have no
questions. I support this bill
and.
Looking forward to voting it in
the in the law.
Madam Chair.
Sorry.
All right, thank you,
Representative Mason. Is there
anyone else?
Like to speak on the bill.
Oh
And
All right.
As amended, thank you.
OK, so I do pass from
representative Fernandez in a

217,000 adults live with
diabetes, and each year, nearly
10,000 more are diagnosed.
Diabetic foot ulcers are one of
the most severe complications
leading to hospital
hospitalization, amputation, and
even death, alarmingly, New
Mexico has a high rate of
non-traumatic lower extremity
amputations with over 600
hospitalizations in 2019 alone.
Uh, topical oxygen therapy has
been proven to double healing
rates in just 12 weeks, reduce
hospitalizations by 82% and
lower amputations by 73%, yet
too many New Mexicans face
insurance barriers to accessing
this life, saving treatment, the
American Diabetes Association
strongly supports its inclusion
in diabetes care and research
confirms that every dollar spent
on prevention saves the
healthcare system up to $51.
Um, so we'll skip a whole bunch
of this, uh, HB 233 will ensure
that those suffering, suffering
from diabetic foot ulcers get
the care they need before it's
too late.
Uh, this is not just a
healthcare issue. It's an
economic and quality of life
issue for thousands of New
Mexicans.
So with that, I have an
amendment, um.
This was an OSI request and
really something that should
have been in the bill from the
beginning, um, on page 33.
Uh, let me get there so.
Go.
Um, it strikes lines 15 through
24.
Um, which is the applicability
part to verify further that this
bill is only for private.
Um, insurance and HMO and does
not include Medicaid.
Um, and then adds the effective
date of January 1, 2026, because
it's insurance, we can't do it
in the middle of a year.
Um
Which will also change the FIR
to be a whole slew less than
what is currently on it so uh
with that, Madam Chair, I stand
for questions.
Thank you. Do we have, um,
anyone here in favor of the
bill?
OK, if you'd like to speak.
Sorry.
Oh, Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is Yara
Akiva. I'm with the office of
the Superintendent of Insurance
and we think the bill sponsor
for bringing this legislation
forward, we're in support. We
have worked with technical
issues and we're in support of
this bill and encourage this
passage. Thank you.
What else?
No.
OK, on Zoom.
Christine Folabel.
Good evening, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. Thank
you for taking the time to hear
such an important issue today.
My name is Christine Balbo, and
I'm the director of government
affairs and advocacy with the
American Diabetes Association.
Amputation prevention is a
critical issue for patients with
diabetes complications lead to
160,000 amputations each year in
the US. In fact, approximately
every 3.5 minutes of lost in
this country to diabetes. Here
in New Mexico, we have a
Troubling rise in diabetes
related amputations in recent
years as well. Early
intervention, including strict
blood sugar and medication
management, access to regular
medical and pot services and
preventive care is critical to
the rising tide of.
233 aims to help meet the needs
of people with diabetes.
Coverage for podiatric
appliances and medical equipment
for the treatment of diabetic
foot ulcers, a common
complication of people with
diabetes.
Can help prevent amputations.
Between 15 and 25% of people
with diabetes will develop a
diabetic foot ulcer in their
lifetime. And those who do
nearly 15% of them will need to
have a inputation
early can lower the risk of
infection, healing, and prevent
deputations.
is all.
Anyone in opposition.
Be
OK, let's go to the committee.
So
adopt him in it.
A manager I moved to discuss the
amendment.
And now I shall move to adopt
the amendment.
And
we need that, we need somebody
else to do it.
Madam Char moved to adopt the
amendment. Thank you.
All righty.
Representative Serato.
I just have one brief question.
Do other states do this as well?
Madam,
this is a widely used, um,
treatment for for diabetic foot
ulcers, um, we just are trying
to add it in uh in health
committee, we also took it from
durable medical equipment to
hold on my head, just put it
away, uh, medically necessary
treatment for active diabetic
foot ulcers, which um will,
which classifies it different
and should make it a whole lot
easier.
to both receive and um the cost
will be less.
My understanding.
Anybody else from the committee?
Oh
So I just wanted you to clarify
one more time, the FIR was
significantly higher, you're
saying that you believe it was
incorrect and.
Because why,
OK, so, um, myself and our
wonderful she's not even said,
oh, she's there, she's behind
me, um, we went down a rabbit
hole today, um, of getting or
All right. Yesterday of getting
the FIR updated.
Um
The FIR
We are under the understanding,
but we could not get.
a hold of anybody at the
healthcare authority that
Those numbers would be inclusive
if it was covered by Medicaid.
Um, not just private insurance.
So we are going to try to add
this to Medicaid session, but
not in this session, so this is
just for
Private insurance and HMOs and
That side, not that side, so the
We were told that the um the
numbers in the FIR.
Were the numbers that it would
take to cover it within
Medicaid.
Sorry.
Before this gets to the floor.
I'm gonna sit at HCA until
somebody gives me a straight
answer because we've been
chasing this for a couple of
weeks now and
The answers have been
Across the board, um, but the,
the person who redid the FIR
said that that that's what
That that's where the numbers
were coming from, so.
OK.
Thank you, Representative Mason.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair
represent this one quick
question just came to me that
uh.
So what about Medicare? Does it
cover this?
Process already or that old
people got to know Madam Chair
and Representative, uh, the
state of New Mexico does not, we
don't get to dictate that and I
actually don't know the answer
of my um expert who was the lady
from American Diabetes is,
couldn't get a flight out here
fast enough, um, so if she is
still on, which I don't know if
she is or not, um, she would be
the one to answer that question.
I did, I went into Medicaid and
private insurance in New Mexico.
I did not go to the Medicare
route because we don't get to.
change it anyway.
So I didn't get that far.
Thank you, Representative Madam
Chair.
