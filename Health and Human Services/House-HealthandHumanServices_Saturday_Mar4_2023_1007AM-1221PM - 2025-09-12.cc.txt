settlement of the creates an
opioid settlement construction
funds to be invested by the
state investment council and the
distributions are made annually
to the opioid crisis recovery
fund which also creates at the
amount of five percent the fund
balance and appropriations made
the opioid crisis recovery fund
for FY twenty four to cover the
initial twenty million dollars.
Appropriation made and this
year's a.
Subsequent to appropriations are
authorized to the opioid crisis
recovery funds that are not
authorized for any other
purpose.
So as I mentioned it also
creates the opioid crisis
recovery fund which receives a
distributions from the opioid
settlement fund.
And the recovery fund is to be
used for appropriations pursuant
to the terms of the settlement
no appropriations our lab that
are not for students to the
settlement because this can
result in a call back funds the
priority is given to evidence
based uses that are proven to
abate the opioid use disorders

disorders or mental health
conditions and it provides an
emergency I.
And.
The state needs.

Whenever you're ready thank you
madam chair of the this is a
uniform act actually and
amendments to a uniform act the
the has been on our books since
the two thousand nine.
The fryer Act prior to that for
more but the the Wolverines and
I got to the line is actually
some work from the uniformed law
commission in two thousand the.
In two thousand seventeen
to subscribe for.
Is and some other federal
actions there was a need to
update the act and so what you
have before you is the updated
revised uniform ferreted jacked.
What it does and madam chair I
can either go into detail for I
can give you a brief overview
whichever you would live brief
overview would be nice just
simply point out there's I made
major changes.
The first one is to make sure
there is equal to treatment of
children that are born to same
sex couples the second thing is
to establish a defacto parents
as a legal parent of a child so
that would be the case where
it's not a biological or
relative of a child with that
person as you raise that child
as their own.
And so has provisions for that
third.
It has provisions of that the
corporation the federal rape
survivor child custody Act of
two thousand fifteen.
To allow the termination of
parental rights of the very
first.
For service to provisions which
is really the
effort.
I'm certainly interested in as I
have a son who's average of.
They're going through that right
now.
And then
The last thing is to have
provisions that addresses the
rights of the children born
through assisted reproductive
technology so those would be the
major changes from the existing
statute over one half of the
bill is devoted to the service
issue.
With that Madam chair of my
expertise Jack Burton the
commissioner on the uniform law
commission.
And
Bill.
The other thing to which were
up madam chair.
I have nothing further thank
thank you so we stand for
questions thank you let's go to
the audience is there anyone
here in opposition.
Anyone soon.
Okay supported me audience.
Support.
We might get through this quick
today.
Okay so questions from the
committee Representative Lord
question thank you madam chair
upkeep and Representative can
you explain your disservice
about the federal right
survivors can explain what that
is.
If they.
If a woman it is right and
through that the action as a
child is conceived and born
there is provisions in here to
allow for to terminate the
parental rights of the rapist.
Without having to go through
a more extended rental
termination right it limits the
rights of that right this to
raise objections to staff for
the nation for all
Representative mortgages jumping
does there have to be a
conviction.
What I can do that madam chair
members of the committee to.
It's easier if there's a
conviction.
But it does not necessarily have
to be fixed thank you I'm
sorry to interrupt I just wanted
to get involved with that so it
thank you I appreciate that
because I'm sure something was
right they should have the right
to be able to not get that
person the printer right and
keep the child's thank you
discuss thank you.
Representative hundred.
Madam chair of the center and
is.
What exactly happens specs to a
child is born and the technology
is needed for protection the
ability of.
Well.
Madam chair representative.
Right now we do not have much on
folks with respective services
so over half I believe it starts
on about page.
Twelve reported a fourteen.
Section eight and nine of this
bill so from ages fourteen to
page thirty eight yield services
and and so number one it has a
lot of provisions about the
rights of.
The birth mother.
Yes Sir it is utilized in that
we also have provisions for in
vitro fertilization and that I
for a procedure.
All the
Issues surrounding those types
of pregnancies if you will and
try to bring us out of.
To date with technology if you
will and so you have a lot of
different scenarios you know
who's the who's the sperm donor
who's the who's the egg donor
whose you know
And do people who donate those
do they have any rights to that
child actors for yes or no and
there's a lot of contractual
agreements that that are
provided for in here that deal
with all the issues surrounding
of those.
The madam chair and
representative for verification
when the court made its ruling
and some of these court cases
that you're talking about they
outlined those items that you
are talking about no ma'am with
respect to the court cases that
works to deal with the issue of
the treatment of children to
same sex couples.
There was previously some issues
surrounding illegitimacy whether
or not same sex couples children
would have the same rights and
so there were some Supreme Court
decision in two thousand fifteen
two thousand seventeen that
because some needed changes to
our existing law and the the
former operation in two thousand
seventeen I would brought their
uniform act up to date and
that's what we're presenting to
you today
thank you madam chair I that
we've been fighting for years to
come the questions regarding of
women who were victims of race
and that now it looks like it
may finally come before use so
thank you for that thank you.
Representative Kate said David
Vincent.
Thank you madam chair and
representative of on on page
nine section two.
is this if a woman brings the
child into a home with partners
for the child's first two years
of life.
And even if the part has
periodic absences.
Is this the right or that
spouse to claim parentage
without that option.
So I understand you're you're up
but so you have a house I.
And I have a child.
No miss madam chair and
representative.
a woman brings a child into a
relationship or she's pregnant
and she enters into a
relationship.
And that child.
Has been living in the house
with the partner for two years
is that a woman I think more of
I'm sorry madam chair
representative.
Can you please tell me what that
programs about.
Madam chair members of the
committee Representative this
this program.
should play.
Workers set to assisted
reproduction.
Normally.
Section.
Also over one oh three.
For.
You need.
I will just have to assist us of
consent from right to assisted
reproduction.
This paragraph.
Play with.
Please consent reproduction.
This happens when there is.
We assisted reproduction.
If they are full of.
Child is born after.
Of assisted reproduction and.
The child into the house.
With the child as.
Then we will work with the child
for two years and hold a child
while as a whole.
For two years.
Child.
Is considered or the court could
I that that child is their job.
It's not.
It's not bringing a stranger's
childhood to files.
This process for both consent to
reproduction
this is already provided for.
Before.
Madam chair representative of
this section is outlined which
would indicate to me that it's
new.
Okay just I'm I misunderstood
your expert witness Madam chair
representative as I thought you
just said this is an existing
one.
Reporter for
think it is more else it is it
is a form of consent it is here
lieu of a written consent.
Of for.
Reproduction assisted
reproduction.
So madam chair representative
let me just read as far as I.
If if oil a woman enters into a
relationship.
With
HSD that is not the spouses
biological child.
But they they lived together for
two years raising that child
together for two years this is
the right for that spouse to
claim parentage.
No ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you madam chair I'd like
to make a motion for do pass on
H. B. three oh five second.
Well we'll put it on that but
you it's Vincent and more for
the motion and second go ahead
Representative R. thank you
madam chair.
This is bringing up a whole lot
of questions.
Such as you know other people
from other countries come which
they already do in New Mexico to
have circuit.
The service should say
this is so it opens up
a lot more people
being able to women being able
to provide that for people.
There is a chance that you know
this could be something that.
Women who have low incomes might
consider doing just to get the
funding and that we have a whole
new.
Industries of certainty for
people from other countries.
Madam chair representative I
don't know that there's anything
in here that with courage or
discourage that activity
I I can't tell you the these
types of agreements exist and we
need to make sure that we have
the structure in statute to deal
with the state's particularly
with respect to the.
Technology.
Of.
I think of there's.
People enter into agreements to
have children now and I'm not
sure that have the the statutory
structure to deal with some of
those issues have that's part of
the reason for this surrogacy
portion of this the small which.
Sorry new section for this issue
of.
Parent.
And so I was just trying to keep
up with with the experience of
what's going on in other states.
We have our state as well Madam
chair representative in the FIR.
on page five.
If the issue doesn't ever for it
says that you.
People are coming here under the
way things are now but if we
like you say streamline things
and make it so it's more
protected might try to do that.
In our state.
I don't read this act as
encouraging or discouraging the
activity I read this is trying
to put a structure.
To deal with the issues that may
arise in the program there's a
few
involved in the services.
Okay and I read on
That what will be the
consequences of not acting this
bill and that is that
perspective intended parents or
potential circuit city to other
states with center developed
legal underpinnings potentially
depriving New Mexico providers
of clients.
So I guess it could be to the
benefit of people who live here.
More than people who are from
other countries
it's kind of something that.
To see if we do get this.
Madam chair representative just
other countries of the other
states sure right but they could
use more low income women here
in New Mexico to ask for the
service.
That.
Chair representative I I can
only tell you that we don't have
the structure in the statutes
today yes this is trying to
provide some structure to deal
with the issues that arise with
respect to service.
And to make sure that this.
Of.
After that
It's and other states would be
deemed acceptable and so whether
that encourages or discourages
I I don't I don't think it
either I think it's just trying
to put in place in New Mexico
the statutory scheme to deal
with these types of groups and
to make sure that the people
that enter into those.
Have in forcible writes they can
be pursued that court of law.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Nibert I just
also wasn't real clear if of a
couple is together for two years
the mother of the child dies
then would that automatically
give the person who was with the
child for two years those rights
over of of family members.
Madam chair representative R. is
that going back to the question
Representative from Bernalillo
Sandoval yes yes that section.
As explained by Mr burden that
section dealt with the couple
did not have an agreement as to
that assisted reproduction.
Child was born as they lived
together for two years it's one
of the elements of corporate
consider to determine that that
child was in fact.
Supposed to the child.
The both of the parents of the
gather whether the merit or not
so this is Madam chair
representative only dealing with
surrogacy.
transaction did not do.
That that that section of the
user of the current that section
is amendments to our current
statutes.
To clear up
When.
A couple goes through this
assisted reproductive.
And they are
they are they are more.
Or at least a.
Thank you for your prayers
there's a presumption but
they're not very I go through
the assisted reproduction they
don't have a an agreement in
place.
One of the factors the court
considers whether or not those
that Google was together for a
period of two years and I think
about point the court's going to
assume that this child that that
came out of this re assisted
reproduction out for is the
child of both the couple that I
say that right Mr for.
Representative Snyder yes I just
wanted to make sure that it was
only during this assisted
Yes research and have a limited
together questions
Really.
Helps take the place of the
express a group of a couple.
So the court that.
Thank you madam chair.
A couple of questions so we'll
private decisions and agreements
made between individuals about
being a surrogate parent be
formalized I written by two to
three.
Not.
Madam chair of.
Yes that is the whole purpose of
this report there's section okay
and Representative diverted
expert I've got a friend who's
going through something like
this will this be what we hope
will it pertain to admit is that
only kids that are that are
conceived from the date of this
or how is the time you want to
work.
Madam chair of the the the age
old question is as to what is
the effect of our laws of.
This goes into effect January
first of twenty twenty four if
it's about.
I would I would think that with
respect to certain of rights for
procedure.
Yes.
The kids on page thirty seven
lines twenty three through
twenty five the provisions of
this act apply to actions can
move forward or after the
effective date.
Our first twenty twenty four by.
So the agreements that would be
entered into those things would
be subject to this act things
that occurred before that date
with the subject to existing law
I would anticipate that over
time point with problems of.
The logic and reasoning behind
some of these provisions and
making termination arose later
first check with this act only
be about doing work for.
Act thank you you answered my
next question.
We have a motion for two.
And the second by Representative
for is there any opposition.
Thank you you have a tax.
Okay
We will go back three seventy
six and I just
You Representative for
representative Armstrong is here
and she will be the experts
Representative Ferrary if you
want to go and sit with her and
it started.
Madam chair with four fifty one
three seven three.
And I introduce expert witness
says John Rangel and I started
working with his son as a P. T.
F. thirty nine years ago.
Yes I mean the most today.
Whenever you're ready
Representative thank you madam
chair this is help feel free
seventy six and this is New
Mexico insurance pool for
directors and
it is to amend the insured us
your insurance both the medical
insurance pool and for the
powers and duties of.
I could go through and tell you
all the things it's going to do
but I'd rather our experts
handle this.
Representative.
B. R. Sanchez you madam chair
and members of the committee job
range grow is a member of the
board can speak four I'm here as
of the former executive director
of the what we call the pool for
fifteen years and so can answer
any questions about the pool
view on.
For what it's doing and then I
can talk about the full.
So the existence self insurance
to anyone who cannot buy it on
the.
Ordinary market.
Individuals it's created in the.
The ladies I patted Jennings
that time
her husband Senator is now more
secure Roswell the specifically
designed for
up at work farmers for forty
with fewer workers and for
people.
Either with disabilities with
children with disabilities all
of the quick not I sure it's in
the private market for any
amount.
At that point the insurance
companies could simply say give
them your disability or after
your application we will not
some health insurance your.
I joined the board in the early
nineties at that point we had
about a hundred members of.
Introduced a program that
enables lower income people so
I.
The insurance at a discount
we increase the over the years
to.
Close to ten thousand members
particularly during a period
where the federal government pay
the premiums for people that
would be eligible under the
exchange but I the exchange not
yet been created the David
gauged in a.
Effort.
As many of our members as
possible off our plans and into
the exchange because we thought
change would provide better a
more permanent insurance and at
a lower cost which comes out to
be true.
We now have about four thousand
members all of whom are still
not able to purchase an
individual insurance policy
health insurance policies in the
open market many of them have
end stage kidney disease but
there are a number of others
price and in addition to the to
selling insurance and the ones
who can not quiet in the private
market we also service
stabilizing the market by taking
people who have extraordinary
costs and spreading the cost the
cost of their health care
overhaul providers so we track
for example and every meeting
anyone who's costs are a hundred
thousand dollars more we pay
particular attention to those
whose of bills are now three
hundred thousand more and we are
now tracking please provide a
member of the pool was cost
health care costs exceed a
million dollars so by taking
people who are so so just
backing up for a minute that
the.
We collect premiums but the
costs of providing the insurance
to our members greatly exceed
the premiums that I pay the that
difference what we call our
losses are there and spread
across and the insurance company
in New Mexico that sells health
insurance proportion that they
pay depends on the proportion of
the market their share of the
market a half so we stabilized
the market by taking people have
very high.
Spreading it across every
insurance provider in the state
of.
Our our losses typically run
hundred twenty million dollars a
year to give you some example of
of how expensive the group that
we ensure can be.
These changes that we're making
are changes to.
Law that was passed in the mid
eighties it simply clarifies
staff is the way that
that are we are financed it also
Opens up the possibility of our
continuing to work with the
exchange covered Medicare to
ensure that anyone applies for
Medicare for for the exchange
Is.
The state.
It sure is that our staff will
be able to work with Medicare
and the exchange to find anyone
who applies for insurance first
of the people is determined to
do
Not eligible for the exchange
for for for Medicaid before we
will insure that so on the slack
this is largely language
changes.
Has no food no for fiscal income
no fiscal impact.
Simply clarifies makes it easier
for us to do some things we've
been doing for years.
madam chair all add to that the
specific changes in the in the
bill are first to give at the
board has pretty broad
authority in in offering plans
they have to be on the health
insurance plans have to be
what's generally available small
market
we actually have authority to
offer small group policies but
never have we operate also just
individual coverage of.
And this we've been approached
over the years to do different
things health administer
a special program for the state
do right now we're we are
Health actually pays premiums
for us to serve medically
fragile children HIV aids and
now hepatitis C. in particularly
have to try to see we have to
offer a full comprehensive
health care plans what we're
trying to target is just
hepatitis C. and so they're
paying full premium for full
plantain surest
And so this allows the board two
based on some initiative of the
state to participate in that if
it's not our traditional
offering of the full
comprehensive health.
and we have some specialty
programs that we
that we do for some of our
particularly
diagnostic groups and in
management the second change
process just giving the
authority to work with the state
on on any special.
The second the change is a just
a technical change is in how we
determine our rates are rates
are set above the market rate.
And before the ACA what we did
was actuarial is there for the
rest of the market was turning
down everyone who was high risk
in so there for the regular
market was a healthy so those
were what we call standards this
range in the market when we
compared our plans to what was
in the market yeah actuarially
those are standard rates and we
charge twelve that because we
have high risk individuals well
now that the market can't turn
down high risk that terminology
is not right so it just changes
it to the average market rate
have rather than standard risk
right and we have we have been
doing at by looking at what is
being sold on the exchange for
Cleveland plans.
just a technical fix and then in
the language and then the third
change is
and Mr Rangel mentioned we had
started years many years ago a
low income of a premium
discounts of your low income we
discounted.
Premiums to make it more
affordable.
Of because it is not affordable
it's not accessible in these are
folks who are really hi need.
But the statute is very
prescriptive
up to a hundred percent of
poverty or or hello I should say
below two hundred percent of
poverty it's a seventy five
percent discount between two and
three hundred percent of the
federal poverty level at fifty
percent discount.
Four hundred percent of the
federal poverty at the twenty
five percent discount.
And so we've been doing that but
now what we have in the health
insurance exchange or what's
called the well New Mexico they
have
subsidy programs that are
what's the right word rather
than a strict here is much more
fluid based on the on the level
of income and if we try to set
our rates above those and it's
hard to do four three four three
options of of discounts and they
probably got.
Twenty options and discount so
this just changes the board
authority to set with the
discount program is so it can be
more in line with of what is in
the health insurance available
in the health insurance exchange
without going below any
subsidized market so
we keep the rates higher than
the market so in order to not
artificially incentivized people
to come in or stay in this high
risk pool
but
but still making it of fairly
comparable to the markets and so
someone
as affordable as as we can make
it without falsely incentivizing
to come here instead of of
purchasing in the market no one
is eligible who's eligible for
Medicaid no one's eligible those
Of eligible for full chair
that's over sixty five we do
offer program a supplemental
program for persons on Medicare
who are under sixty five and a
half due to disability or and
stage renal disease we offer our
wraparound plan this that's a
federally approved a program to
do that and with that I think we
can stand for questions I'm
happy to answer any more
questions about about the pool
range okay we'll go to the
audience in opposition.
Okay one step forward.
And your.
Two minutes thank.
What is our.
Register this for years health
insurance plans can you stand in
opposition to the bill today and
I would point you to page three
lines twelve through fourteen.
The language of this bill.
Three things that were at.
Well described by former
representative Armstrong but.
Use the language that's on line
twelve to fourteen what you see
is a statutory authorization to
the high risk pool to
participate in any health
insurance related program or
initiative of the state are
reading of that is that is a
very flawed description General
authorization to this
organization to engage in
activities and serve for the
members of a half is we pay the
bills for the higher risk pool
has the the expert witness
mentioned it's running a hundred
twenty million dollars that is
each one of the health insurers
market and so when you're
looking to any health insurance
related program or initiative of
the state are you engaging in
some activity or program that
necessarily compete with what
for the commercial market is
still we have to change their
significant subsidies they're
available for folks the lower
end of the of the of the
different markets on the
exchange of we don't want to be
in a position where we are
funding hires tools recesses but
then also beating with them in
some scenarios more than happy
to talk to sponsor About
specific changes to the language
then there would be and in some
ways had discussions we have
really come to any agreement
there but as we look to this
language it's very broad and are
members of the ones that pay the
bills for hi this thank you
thank you for.
Thank you with eight seconds
left.
In.
Because.
I'm glad it's not just me it's a
long day already right anyone
else enough issue on zoom in
opposition.
in the room and support.
On students of.
I guess we're the only working
today.
Of us in this year so questions
Representative cakes.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative those
would you consider the technical
issue in which your opposition
was also up in our FY are.
So we need to consider
differently and then to be able
to clarify that I do want to
specific non I'll read from the
at the end so you have to it's
us.
In reference the inner entering
into contracts or otherwise
participating in any health
insurance related programs or
initiatives in the state this
language includes broad open
ended general references that
are there.
So so let me get a response by
describing the structure of the
Board office of the pool
consists of eleven members for
members are elected I all of
that carriers in New Mexico we
sell health insurance for
members are community members
that are appointed by the
superintendent of insurance and
three others are Representative
the health community so the
board is essentially even
balance between representatives
of all the carriers of health
insurance and so we're members.
In the roughly thirty years I've
been a member of the poor
parents never been a
disagreement between the
Representative subcarriers and
the consumer members over the
direction of the questions take
we substantially operates facts
Census so I I I understand that
this language is what budget as
a practical matter the insurance
carriers are well represented by
their representatives on the for
and I don't anticipate that
support ever get into a
competition with the the company
said a representative on the
board.
Further because we always charge
more than the going rate we are
never competitive in terms of
rates and we're dealing here
with a market that is very
sensitive to the premiums that
they have to pay and so I again
I anticipate ever be.
Potentially we could offer
something that is in competition
I don't know why in the world
with finance it's five to ten
years we've been is just thirty
percent over the month over that
market rate for exactly plan.
And madam chair I can add to
that the school has created in
statute is not an insurance
company.
It's up is just to sell
commercial insurance it's up
insurance program
rated in state statute with
specific charges to
cover of those who can't get
insurance or who are high risk
and so it is
if we have met of met with with
miss more and we
are open waiting for proposed
language he plans to enact that
but we're not it's not a
commercial insurance company to
offer commercial product it is
insurance program created in
statute and
managed by for directors at the
said for carriers on the board
in the carriers in the state
electors for members and they
are almost always the largest
carriers in the state who are
rate the biggest bills who are
participating thank you madam
chair representative thank you I
I understand your answer I I
just wanted so in this this pool
it's not for medically fragile
children
Madam chair representative it is
the department of health page
for medically fragile children
on here who are not eligible for
anything else you don't qualify
for Medicaid okay just just for
the manager Representative the.
The children's medical program
receives federal funds in the
past before.
We agree to help allow them to
use those funds to purchase
insurance they were paying for
the full cost of the medical
services you should receive so
this is an example of a state
initiative okay.
What we agreed was a cake for
federal funds instead of paying
the full medical bills they
could buy insurance for those
children and then we would pay
the full medical bills that
enable them to multiply the
effect of the federal funds the
receiving by many times and and
so.
That language that that's that
we're discussing right now is
precisely.
Britain to enable us to enter in
these kinds of initiatives
another would be the Habsi
program for the department of
health said the state has to do
something about that very high
rates have seen that we have in
the state instead of taking the
funds that we have available and
paying at that time
approximately a hundred thousand
dollars per haps C. K. to get
the drug test sure of them they
instead took those funds and
bought insurance from us that
and covered not simply have seed
but the full range of medical
services that someone that
Habsi.
And that's what we're trying to
ensure that we're going to be
able to do in the future through
this particular
way thank you madam chair and
friends hello this is go back to
the bill bill has nothing to see
so I just want to say that you
know thank you for bringing this
forward I think this is shows
another really great.
State initiatives taken care of
most vulnerable but I would
still being really good stewards
of of the dollar and so thank
you.
Thank you Representative Vincent
thank you madam chair.
So I'm real sensitive when it
comes to insurance because I
think that on the.
For insurance and.
My insurance I went to get some
eye glasses the other day eight
hundred Bucks.
And my insurance didn't live.
The my the people that they
don't want lasses did why the
insurance that I had and I have
to pay for it out of pocket
eight hundred dollars.
Look what kind of lessons I have
one right now we've got me some
cheerleaders and they're way
better than the ones they
provided the so
Why why would other insurances.
Insurance companies have to
absorb a hundred twenty million
Bucks and madam chair if if if
you put a hundred twenty million
out on however many fighters
there are injured providers.
Are they don't charge me more
for insurance.
Madam chair and representative
actually it's the other way
around by Georgene the cost
across and there's actually more
than three hundred companies
that way that we assess
I am sorry that across the board
they can keep your premiums
lower rather than your then
having all these really high
risk.
in the same market the same pool
of people who are provide
insurance on the on the open
market so there's
It is it kind of is backward
thank you but if you if you
drive into the individual market
on on the exchange people who
are costing.
I mean by law of those companies
have to spend eighty five
percent of their premium on
direct care we spend nine
hundred percent of the premium
on the direct care if we put all
those people in that same pool
with those high cost everybody's
premium would go up this is a
stabilizing.
Mechanism by taking really high
risk high cost individuals
in keeping them out of the
private market.
That makes sense not really.
Madam is just just make it on a
business of almost all business
person.
And I'm sorry I think did did
you want to speak.
One point the insurance
companies to pay these
assessments also get a tax
credit yes it is.
So it's not a hundred percent.
Thank thank you I forgot I
request got that big points they
also get a tax credit of fifty
five percent about fifty five
percent.
they also the biggest payers
because they're the biggest
insurance companies in the state
do Medicaid and Medicaid
assessed and then as part of
their rates structure.
So it's matched so the federal
government actually ends up
picking up to match the vast
majority of this.
Madam chair representative and I
know that you're more hard
probably the right place but
the.
I've been here already for forty
five days is two more weeks to
go and we're almost across the
finish line and of I have seen
some stuff for the devil's in
the details.
And because and I've been saying
this at the very beginning so
it's not just towards you
insurance premiums are high and
then my wife and I fourteen
hundred Bucks.
And that's a lot of money for
me.
so what I heard you say well
let's go on and on I'm still
trying to get my mind wrapped
around a hundred twenty million
how how it's going to get kicked
out to.
All that are in the business to
make money.
They're gonna have to absorb
this hundred twenty million and
somebody's going to pay for.
Who's the some.
The somebody for Madam chair
representative for I I remember
she sent of it is the federal
government I Medicaid match
so it's a much smaller amount
than that hundred twenty that
gives a sense to about three
hundred companies by by
spreading it out that for our
it's very little on on impact on
an individual offer.
Madam chair representative is an
expert I heard you state of that
as for you talk about the
initiatives and I was wondered
like.
I wrote this question down The
New Mexico insurance pool could
possibly committee with our
compete with commercial
insurance health care plans now
is that correct yup well we.
The.
The person propose says that's a
possibility
I might.
I think it's unlikely because
for members of the pools board
Representative the insurance
companies and so they would stop
any competition I assumed by.
right because our premiums are
always higher than the market
rate I'd I'd even if we tried to
compete which we would never do.
We would be offering a product
that offers the same benefits
for more money so I have no idea
why anybody whatever I.
And madam chair and
representative right now.
we have a little over four
hundred four thousand people and
in the pool offering the same
equivalent insurance they do on
the exchange or in the private
market we're not a big.
These are folks that are really
high need or can't get it
otherwise for our special
purpose of the state that that
this is a useful and can stretch
their dollars farther by having
this and to do to get insurance
from.
And one thing that kind of
sparked my interest was are
these funds subject to audits by
the state auditor's office
madam chair and representative
we're not a state entity so that
they are they are audited by
statute have to be audited and
that that some independent audit
and audited under that.
Thank us here whatever that is
criteria that the federal
government contractors have to
be audited under and those
audits are are made public
But it's not audited by the
state.
Although we always submit every
year our copy of our audit to
the state honored just to be
sure of it there are aware that
we have a lot.
Madam chair and representative
just so that you know because
we're we're not a state entity
but we were created by this by
the state specifically to fill a
gap we we are we operate
understate procurement code
the board falls under the state
for claims we also do open
meetings so that all of our
information is public LFC gets a
copy is invited to every board
meeting where every financial
document is his provided so it
has a lot of oversight public
oversight.
And from that perspective thank
you madam chair.
Thank you any more questions.
Yes Representative.
Madam chair.
Representative I'm just trying
to see exactly what the
objection is so I I.
Sales.
Fiscal.
Is that the bill proposes
creating right health insurance
coverage all we and then if I do
with that the lower than the
average subsidized rate
available of the New Mexico
health insurance exchange at the
same income level four some
sensually simulate what we're
projecting to.
Help with understand what the
opposite the opposition is I
have madam chair and
Representative I I would not
want to stand.
In explaining the opposition we
are always above the market rate
even in our low income the
problem with our low income
program as prescribed is that
there are times when we're not
lower because we can't we can't
align ourselves with how the
market place the exchange is
subsidized.
Because we have three very
specific tears rather than a
graduated
ability to to discount so the
this is trying to align ending
up former secretary former OSI
ball chair.
Before I came jobs were our was
the chair.
The superintendent of the.
And
This
is I was.
Cision.
That we may.
We move forward the act full
during the.
Workers.
And this is missions occurred
sample.
They were given the legislation
long for years.
The overall of the store.
Few open borders and for.
Moving forward the former head
to your question is there is a
big distinction between the
local carers their profession.
And then national borders.
It's the national organization.
This is encouraging you
Representative to say this is a
bad.
The national association in my
experience.
The superintendent was they
oppose.
just again.
what that was not the case at
all with the insurance plans
your next.
Thank you madam chair.
Members of the I mean the
presenters the US only my only
other question distantly once
the ACA came into existence and
pre existing conditions would no
longer a barrier to insurance.
I'm not sure I understand what
we have.
So many people can't get
insurance to madam chair and
representative there are a lot
of people locked out for
Medicaid for
the private market
because they have even if
they're here undocumented
haven't been here long enough to
qualify.
And some are undocumented we
also have members on the pool
who might be able to technically
get other insurance that's less
expensive for them but they
would
They are so high risk and are
traveling out of state on our
network to get the care that
they need and they quite frankly
don't want to rock their boat
and start all over with a new
insurance company to destroy
Care
and and and and or change
providers so there are some.
on on and are hanging on to this
insurance because it's good for
them the coverage is good for
them and working with us is
there for them when they are
such
in prices and such Chinese thank
you madam thank you for.
He.
I will entertain a motion.
Russian to four do pass seconds.
Chavis
Can you call the roll.
Representative Kate yes
Representative seven.
Representative Ferrary yes.
Representative Jones no
Representative Lord no.
For assistance can.
Representative Anderson.
Minimized.
Yes in the.
Yes.
Okay I I agree you have.
And I texted Representative
Armstrong thinking that there
was a short here so she's.
She's coming in for that.
I'm not a very good fortune.
So we will go ahead with them
four fifty one.
Jobs.
Thank you madam chair I do have
an expert witness Dr potentially
see park on soon.
Contain some titles and that
more purple.
So go ahead
thank you madam chair and thank
you all for meeting on Saturday
and we list as long as it's much
appreciated this is house bill
four fifty one pharmacists
dispensing fee reimbursement the
purpose of house bill four fifty
one is to bring to the
legislature's attention the need
to provide support for our
community based pharmacies
especially in rural New Mexico
pharmacies that are provide
invaluable fall the frontline
care health care services to the
communities that they serve.
New Mexico has about seventy.
Of health based pharmacies I
just have one madam chair close
in Sapporo inside a small
Of grocery store in in support
of Mexico and so I'm I'm living
this first hand and solar many
of my constituents Drug prices
have continued to increase
substantially for patients at
the counter and the pharmacist
to purchase and dispense those
drugs while reimbursement to
pharmacists receive through
Medicaid programs for the
current cost of dispensing have
not they've not increased this
is the result in compounding
losses to their business and
adds to the current date
difficulty.
Of adequate adequately serving
their patients medications needs
and keeping their doors open
long term
so basically this bill simply
ask the community based
pharmacies to be a pro
pharmacies be appropriately
reimbursed for the cost for the
medications that they have to
deliver to their parents so that
they can reduce their losses and
continue to keep their
operations afloat it's vital to.
Rural New Mexico specifically
and especially and I'm not sure
if doctor from C. for their
actually would like to add
anything.
Yes thank you very much can you
all hear me yes.
Thank you madam chair
representative my name is Dr
potentially see farts on the
owner of care drug and asked
tech include sold New Mexico I'm
also the chair of the New Mexico
pharmacy business council this
bill is super simple we're
asking to be fairly reimbursed
through our Medicaid contracts
clearly the contracting is a
little outdated in the last five
years we've seen costs skyrocket
yet our contracts are like five
years old
drug shortages have also put an
increase in our ability to keep
medications on the shelves which
means that we're having to buy
things above what we're being
reimbursed at just to keep our
patients taking care us brand
name losses right now ranging
anywhere from twenty to a
hundred dollars and I'm having
to do that I can not keep doing
that and many of our rural
pharmacies are under the same
restraints we've all gone from
about forty percent of our
business in Medicaid in the last
five years to currently sitting
at sixty percent so we are the
ones that are taking care and
serving this population.
All we're asking for is fair
reimbursements if I have to pay
the cost I should be reimbursed
the cost of the drug thank you.
Thank you madam chair and
without stand for questions from
the audience in opposition.
Session.
Okay.
Okay.
Actually new to.
Okay I'm working.
So you would speak.
One of.
Morning madam chair members of
the committee that is days and
times of registered lobbyists
Department quizzes Council and I
think I think the US for the
record of maybe needing a forty
seven seconds left on the clock
but we really appreciate
Representative arms on the ring
well for us and really.
The community based in rural
perspective to this issue also
is the state for a keep your
feet is a really tough times
points the man with the centers
around as we're just asking for
fairness in terms of as a the
appropriate cost for the class
of dispensing
Glittery medications to these
communities.
as stated the special role
Mexico independent community
based pharmacies are.
slave wages and higher drug
prices and not necessarily
matching reimbursement so along
with this continues the harder
is going to be in terms of
compounding the losses for them
to be able to continue to
operate provided vital frontline
community services medications
their patients that they need to
be able to keep their doors open
for the long term.
That have stand for any question
thank you
zoom we have Dale Tinker.
So
madam chair this is Dale can
Kerr with New Mexico pharmacists
Association and I would like to
stand in support of this bill
as some of you might know the
federal CMS issued a requirement
a number of years ago for
Medicaid programs if your cost
of dispensing survey New Mexico
did not do one but they adopted
the cost of dispensing survey
from Nevada
and implemented that in the fee
for service program and that's
why the dispensing fee is
different for the for service
that it is for the Medicaid
managed care program this bill
would I think remedy that for
the community pharmacy group
that seventy some independent
pharmacies in New Mexico as you
know we've lost many of them.
and that's primarily the reason
work the dispensing fee is needs
to be corrected
thank you.
Thank you Dale so we will go to
the committee questions.
Actually I have a question.
So on on page two lines.
What does community based does
that mean like not CVS and
Walgreens or so it's it's it's
exactly what does that mean and
we're we're staff definition
madam chair I'm not sure not
sure if Dr
I can answer that.
Yes madam chair that's a great
question thank you this is
actually a designation that was
put your HSD five years ago when
governor Michelle Lujan Grisham
took office she made a specific
special designation of a
community based pharmacy and HSD
actually come to find out this
yesterday updates the community
based pharmacy list quarterly it
is documented and presents on
HSD is website so it can be
accessed by the public but it
does specifically regarding.
Anybody that is independently
owned so yes to answer your
question it excludes the chain
pharmacies and all mail order
pharmacies.
Thank you Ashlee thank you okay
in any other questions
Representative handed so thank
you madam chair Representative
I'm.
What I'm not sure I'm clear
about is with respect to
reimbursement if I get I I
pharmaceuticals from
from CVS pharmacy of a Walgreens
those organizations have to pay
a rate decrease of those
pharmaceuticals are you are you
saying to us that those
pharmacies in a community small
areas they pay the same way but
they don't get reimbursed to
sign well madam chair
representative what I'm saying
is that small independents don't
get to
Negotiate that price like the
large pharmacies do.
They're they're told what they
will be reimbursed so when it
comes to bind is if say for
example distracted which is that
in the future that I can
understand sometimes if I have
to buy Bayer aspirin for example
from the pharmacy at CVS or
Walgreens and if I go to job to
buy that that they are aspen I'm
not going to pay more for I mean
is the pharmacies and more for
the Bayer aspirin.
Madam chair actually would you
like to answer that please.
Yes ma'am
thank you for the question Madam
chair representative it gets
very very complicated at that
point getting into contracting
many of the small independents
we have to contract with what we
call GPOs are buying groups that
gives us the leverage across the
nation to have the same kind of
buying power where this bill
gets into though is the
negotiation and contracts that's
where we are unfairly treated
and within Medicaid the PBMs the
NCOs and PBMs operate those
contracts they can sort for for
for people over others depending
on lots of complications this
bill simply asked that we are
reimbursed a fair price.
And they can not.
Under reimburse us the cost of
the medication.
I hope that answers your
question thank you madam chair
so madam chair and
representative ultimately the
private independents will pay
more because they don't have the
the kind of buying power in the
kind of pull that the larger
pharmacies have so you will
private palpably paid more and
less for the Bayer aspirin but
as far as the pharmacy if you
have a prescription you might
pay the same but it actually
costs the pharmacy more
depending on what kind of
insurance you have so madam
chair of the matter
Representative so are
reimbursement rate is it is a
sense of what people pay for
example if I'm reimbursing
people in Walgreens and CVS.
These jobs is the percentage of
reimbursement different for
community based pharmacies
I actually would like to answer
that please.
Madam chair representative yes.
The.
Of so you're saying to us madam
chair representative that the
governor in into the agreement
the said community based
pharmacies would be reimbursed
at a lower rate this will help
me to understand because I I.
The time understanding why the
reimbursement is going to be
different.
Actually would you like to
explain exactly how you your
reimbursed compared to a large
pharmacy being reimbursed.
Yes thank you madam chair
representative again this gets
back in the contracting and it's
it's it gets into the weeds a
little bit but the NCOs that are
contracted with Medicaid for for
a certain pharmacy benefit
manager.
The contracting through the
pharmacies is done through that
PBM that pharmacy benefit
manager.
Most of the time reimbursements
are.
furthered networks which so.
Without stating names
in order to be in a preferred
network you have to take a
certain reimbursement.
And sometimes those
reimbursements are less than
what you can actually acquired
the drugs at however if I said
no to that for network then I
would essentially lose all of
the patients inside that
network.
I hope that makes sense I know
that that gets very complicated
with Medicaid.
The governor set aside this
community based list in order to
help increase our dispensing
fees but it had nothing to do
with the actual reimbursement
for the cost of the medication.
She's setasides she recognized
five years ago when we
approached her about that is
that we were being unfairly
treated inside the program so
she setasides and community
based list.
Which is updated quarterly to
provide us an increase at that
time she gave us an increase of
two dollars for the dispensing
fee which we were only getting
thirty five cents at the time
right now we know the cost of
medications have skyrocketed on
us the cost of a label a
prescription label right now
runs about five cents viols are
costing us almost thirty five
cents a bottle not to mention
the lead you have to put on it
so cost of increased
substantially again this
legislation is simply asking for
us to be reimbursed fairly.
And representative will say as a
member of the Legislative Health
Services interim committee we
spent.
Only six days on pharmacy
staffing the more you talk about
it the more confused yet so so
don't feel like the Lone Ranger
because it's intentionally made
to be okay and so that no one
can understand so don't feel
like you're missing anything S.
Dr Hickey Senator Hickey says
he's working on his PhD in part
in in the PBM so it's very
confusing and it doesn't make
sense and there's a lot of new
ones well this for clarification
meditate eat thank you that is
absolutely correct because
anybody madam chair who's on
Medicaid I don't understand why
we are reimbursing everybody is
the same right why isn't there a
uniform rate for purposes of
reimbursement of Medicaid is a
federal program but I have also
what also matters is expanding
it as we talk about this when
when the bill is asking for
reimbursement at a family what
does that mean what are you
asking for Madam chair
representative thank you for
that question they're asking for
fairness on if if Walgreens is
reimburses certain right then
they want to be reimbursed that
same right we're if it's real
convoluted madam chair
representative is in the PBMs of
the NCOs because they are the go
between for everyone they are
the go between between the
pharmacies and and and far off
their their the goshi here's and
so we want free we want fair
negotiations madam chair.
So one last question is do we
have the summer one.
So
Okay in terms of of of fifty go
ciation I was wondering how the
statements and to this
conversation the size of the
contractual arrangement which I
don't know how the state could
send on that so and and.
Madam chair just help we will
because as we loaded on this is
really important to stand with
voting on and
Is it also madam presenter so as
we as we look for purposes the
state get so much money for for
Medicaid.
In any way in any of that so
that money that we get for
people who are on Medicaid and
that that's what it looks like
with me here we only get given
that and so let's money once we
give up that amount of this week
talking about subsidizes.
Do you get the Medicaid is that
what you're asking for.
Madam chair representative
actually would you like to
comment on those questions it's
it's confusing how does the
state fit into this.
Yes thank you for that question
madam chair representative
basically the state this is
actually a great time to have
legislation like this because
the state is looking at bidding
right now right now they are
contracting for bidding out in
CIOS this would basically give
them a directive to say this is
what you're going to reimburse
our independence in the state of
New Mexico no questions asked.
Instead of the PBMs dictating
what we are reimbursed on you
know however they come up with
that they they claim it's all
proprietary information does
that answer your first question
Representative just.
Been here during the summer.
Of the stuff Representative even
those who were here during the
summer.
I don't understand completely
the I think I think it's
intentionally design that no one
can understand so I will
entertain a motion this.
Is there any opposition.
When you have a to pass thank
you madam chair and look forward
to thank you.
Yeah me too.
We are.
So.
Read more was kind enough to I
just want.
So I.
Here.
What made maybe I'm saying this
so that we can speak the last
bill thank you to but if you I
don't know what the Senate this
in there so if you want to get
up and get some lunch that's
fine if you want to.
Okay okay okay okay.
We will go ahead and go with
Representative Hochman Vigil.
There's.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee.
While since I've been in the
health field.
That
I am talking to you about house
bill five hundred which is
that wishes a nonrecurring funds
in the state treasury treasury
eight which is administered by
the superintendent of insurance
to provide medical malpractice
premium reimbursement to certain
health care providers.
the reimbursement percentage
will be determined by the number
of years and cactus right for
that practitioner in available
only to independent health care
providers woodland hospital for
a health system off to my left
I'm sure everyone will recognize
the easing wonderful fantastic.
legendary that me Armstrong
former representative who is
going to act as my experts today
and do you want to make a
statement that.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative
I know that you probably are
aware that there's many.
Malpractice bills making their
way.
Through both bodies and this is
one of.
this is not touching the medical
malpractice act it's a tool in
the toolbox to help recruit and
retain doctors by helping them
pay some of their premiums so if
they're here.
and stayed there for the longer
they stay here the more.
M. as pay
of their face insurance that
they have to have the for the a
patient compensation fund which
taken.
So this is a touching Act is
directly help fund the
providers.
Those who fall under that act by
paying some of that for you.
Any of you have an amendment and
we do have an amendment
passed out okay it's here right
here.
Yep.
One thank you so give give it
just a second go ahead.
Is it to passed out before you
explain it I will take a motion
to.
Does.
Hello to discuss our second
okay.
This
Go ahead.
You can always use more.
I'm not second.
What was.
Okay go ahead thank you madam
chair and so what this
ammendment does is it basically
puts in language to ensure that
the bill
goes into
At the bill goes into practice
subject to the availability of
funding for it and it also adds
language that allows for the
development of priority criteria
to disperse the fund independent
healthcare providers are
independent health care provider
groups so again concentrating on
those groups of providers that
are in the most needed help
subject to the availability of
medical malpractice insurance
and the high premiums that we
see that are being levied upon
the specific group so that's
what the amendment and.
Madam chair I could add that.
and you'll see on the bill we
were asking seventy million
which is about what we estimated
would take to.
Do this.
Providers.
So where were we able to secure.
We don't have enough funding we
have to develop criteria.
Which might be the type of
provider that we're particularly
short uncontested transition for
area of the state that but
Crisis for
Or some factor of of need need
basis but we don't have seventy
million we have to decide how to
spend fifteen minutes.
The reason for the.
Of.
We're open for questions.
Go to the audience.
And is there anyone in the
audience who is that lows in
opposition to house bill five
hundred.
Yes the no hands of going to
zoom is there anyone else who
who's in opposition to house
bill five hundred.
Okay let's go back to the
audience is there anyone here
who said that the support of
house bill five hundred.
Right as the one hand and we
know how much he's tall so we
are going to give away.
Members of the committee duly I
agree with the New Mexico
travellers Association and we
appreciate the governor and
Representative Armstrong Deborah
A. Armstrong trying to find
solutions that we now live in
Senate by providers and health
care health care providers to
come to New Mexico state.
So is it alright thank you and
I'm sorry I can't stay mad for
that.
Are we going to those now is.
Since it's part of the house
well on this one I didn't see.
The school board members
of the New Mexico Medical
Society we actually have really
mixed feelings about this
legislation I think that we
appreciate support that we're
receiving from the C. we
appreciate the sponsor
legislation has really tried to
work with us the medical
malpractice issues over the
interim but we do feel that this
bill is a recognition that there
is a looming crisis and that
medical malpractice is
unsustainable in this state
right now and that it demands
further action by the
legislature we hope that there
would be the opportunity for a
task force over the interim
committee substitute thousand
the Senate but since that's not
be tabled we do think there in
the city of broader conversation
around medical malpractice we
appreciate that we can get
there's not a whole funding is a
budget for this and so we are a
little concerned about
competitive grants type process
but like I said we we appreciate
the fact that the sponsor for
working with us we appreciate
the help that we get at this
point in time I have to say no
to anything but again we we we
have mixed feelings about that I
think works from the beginning
but was.
Thank you.
That is anyone else in the
audience.
Okay we will go to soon is there
anyone else still.
And so I could make Miller I see
your hand.
Good morning madam vice chair
members of the committee you
hear me.
Here you.
My name is Mike one of the
operations officer for southwest
bone and joint institute in
Silver City New Mexico we stand
in support of this bill over the
last two years are medical
malpractice premiums increased
over twenty percent and
assistance we can receive to
help offset that cost would be
appreciated.
As you know with increases to
overhead we cannot simply pass
on those increases to our
patients nor can we request
that.
Medicare or Medicaid.
Increase their reimbursement
those rates are set and we
cannot simply increase though so
any assistance we can receive we
fully support thank you.
All right thank you is there
anybody else who.
At the end of hands madam chair
we are ready to go to the
committee okay.
Representative Lord and then
Kate's Chavis.
Okay.
Thank you madam chair and
representative and
Representative.
so I have some questions on this
I'm going through on.
Looking at who qualifies for
this from page two to three that
would be certified nurse and The
Simpsons.
That would certified nurse
midwife certified nurse
practitioner practice physician
physician assistant or but I
interest and then it says a
number of years of practice in
the state I haven't seen her way
to the is it over here with a
number of years are they have to
be in the state.
Madam chair representative on
page two.
So it's this Madam tentative so
zero to three years twenty five
percent four to seven years
fifty percent eight to eleven
years five percent voters more
a hundred percent so my question
there is.
We determining which doctors or
of which Tennessee office would
that.
Coverage.
How do we determine that.
Based on the income how.
House eligible.
Madam chair of Representative
board so we just based on the
language of the bill
that the funding being a
separate issue aside it simply
depends on whether or not they
meet the R. type of healthcare
provider this is the right
within the bills they are
enumerated in the bill and that
they have been in practice by
into meaning they have a license
to practice for that amount of
time which that determines the
amount of subsidy that they get
for their insurance.
So if you have a chiropractic
physician or a nurse anesthetist
who's been licensed to practice
for forty seven years it will
get a fifty.
The subsidy on their medical
malpractice insurance premium so
mentor to is that every doctor
in the whole state.
Madam chair and representative
it's the independent health care
providers not hospital.
so is independent of ones who
are not employed by hospital
health system.
In the providers that are listed
are the exact same ones that are
covered by the medical
malpractice sent patient
compensation fund that
So it's meant to support the
independent providers non
hospital health system who
of participate in that.
In that fund.
to get to participate in the
medical malpractice.
Asian compensation fund you have
to Kerry five two hundred fifty
thousand dollars worth of
insurance before that case and
so this is meant to help pay for
that two hundred fifty that
basically
of premiums that you participate
in fund.
Okay Madam chair representative
and I'm sorry to see this is
Okay so these are people that
going back to the bill is
present HB eighty eight this
would be for that for those
people that cannot.
I'm trying to figure out still
there some people who cannot get
traditional coverage.
So that's not gonna help them.
So we're just looking at
independent doctors.
Come here the longer they stay
here they get refers.
It still doesn't have these
other people and concerned about
the case numbers because or
isn't covered for them.
I
second better way to do this
would be for how to lower the
malpractice in general.
And then this is coming on the
general fund this is seventy
million dollars of taxpayer
money correct to pay doctors of
Madam chair representative
that's how much is often
requested that actually will get
ripped out there's fifteen
million right now and in the
governor senior
From.
And as I said before this is
It doesn't touch that medical
malpractice act that you heard
about four doesn't touch that
this is one of many tools that
we have to help recruit and
retain providers and
particularly independent
providers who don't have as much
support as they made with
their coverages since they have
to pay for coverage rather than
a hospital health system so we
right now we do
Health professional loan
repayments we do residency
programs without medical school
and health loan for service
programs rural health care
provider tax credits the
Medicaid provider rate increases
and this is one more tool to
help recruit and retain doctors
and the longer they stay here
the more help they get on their
based on malpractice premiums so
it's it's not practice bill is a
tool in the toolbox to help
recruit and retain doctors thank
you madam chair representative
so yeah voted on the tax credits
before I can't I I understand
one more drive sectors can't
support our taxpayers having to
pay the seven million dollars to
get to stay here think there's
other ways to do it and try to
find ways to lower morning
centers so with that finish
thinking.
Representative can.
Thank you madam chair committee
of and thank you Representative
for for bringing this bill
forward I just want to go I I
understand that
the percentage of the premium
being paid increases with the
years of service and in New
Mexico and you have a good broad
base of medical providers state
you have to fit within this
medical providers I I get that I
just have two questions one is
from of Y. eight three
occurrences and want three
now practices occurrences in one
year is assuming those are
malpractice Hey Alex malpractice
where the malpractice insurance
believes that they need to pay
for the patient and why three is
that a common number among
medical providers to agree on
that malpractices a year.
Chair and representative this is
to align with what's required to
get into the patient
compensation fund so it's rather
than say will pay your premium
and you can go out and get a
million dollar premium or at
seven fifty with a lot more
prints or whatever that's the
basis required before you
participate in patient
compensation fund for
distracting the state okay so
thank you very much madam chair
and and Representative and thank
you very much
so this bill is not for
individual doctors who are
buying their medical malpractice
on the private market these are
doctors that are already being
subsidized by the building in
the state's medical malpractice
pool and this is further helping
them with that initial of pre
correct madam chair
this is a they do have to go by
this insurance but it's so that
they can participate in correct
the have to have that seven
hundred fifty or whatever that
two hundred right fifty four
they can get dense although it's
it's helping them with that base
premium amount so these are
medical malpractice are
amendments here and these are
for medical providers who are
all who are participating in the
state
medical school thank you thank
you for that clarification I
also just just practical I know
the bills appropriations
manuals but but I do like to
kind of understand just want to
go back inside thanks.
I'm a thank you madam chair and
representative I am
So
medical providers and so from
the time I start with this bill
passes this from zero to three
years you're you're paying
twenty five percent so there's
still it's it's just a it into
premium it's before that is here
and you put in zero so leave the
state in six months you did have
your malpractice rate but but
that's how we can be able to
capture everyone is that how
it's set up.
Chair and Representative yes.
Thank you very much for.
Thank you is there someone else
hello I'm sorry.
Representative Johnson
Representative Thomas.
Actually.
Sorry I just wanted to get my
drink actually it's Chavis and
then
her angel okay.
And I know I called
and I was looking for spoon
unsuccessfully.
Thank you madam chair
representative for my questions
have been answered but.
I still have more so I
understand that independent
doctor and so in terms of an
independent provider group that
would basically be a group of
doctors who has a practice
they're not affiliated with any.
Hospital or even any kind of
outside.
Company corporation correct.
Madam chair representative yes
they have their own the.
All right so.
So you have fifty million from
the governor's you money.
How long will that last.
Madam chair representative the
fifteen million I mean that's
why we want to create a fund and
try to grow this fund will
happen have to come back for
more the estimation for one year
to do this for all the
independence is seventy thousand
that's what will be thousand
seventy million.
We've only attained so far
fifteen million
that we think will get into the
budget which that means you're
gonna have to establish criteria
which part of the amendment
to establish criteria for whose
priority.
Priority could change over the
years and depending on how much
money you have or don't have so
it's that's not prescriptive
here that would be it.
And
in rules or guidance from from
both sides
But as an example we have a
crisis in OBGYN in the state we
have a crisis in rural areas we
have and so I would assume that
that might be some of the prior
to criteria is certain
professions and or certain
geographic areas of the state of
and so but it's left open to
decide that because that could
change year to year where are
your gaps armory priorities.
So Madam chair representative so
in terms of let's look at the
world areas do you have a set
and that's good but would you
why and right so I'm I'm
familiar with.
the state is Los Alamos Gallup
those areas are without will be
G. wins right now but all of
those of you why and swore.
Employed by the hospitals in
those areas so are there any
OBGYN Madam chair
representative.
That are practicing solo in
those areas that we're trying to
keep.
Madam chair representative
not that I'm aware of
specifically but again this is
to recruit and retain you might
get someone for or a practice
that wants to form our you
certified nurse midwives that
one former practices are getting
help with this among other
things to do that.
So madam chair representative
what kind of a plan is there in
place to begin that recruitment
process.
madam chair and Representative
there are
various recruitment efforts that
that go on from communities from
nonprofits from recruitment
agencies that have a whole list
of here's the things that the
state will can do for you longer
give forgiveness loan repayment
there are national organizations
other state organizations that
recruit providers
and particularly underserved
areas to FQHCs to on to rural
areas sometimes it's the
community themselves that are
trying to recruit and this will
be one more tool that they can
say the state has to offer so
then is there sort of and I the
reason I'm asking is that I'm
very interested in this
You I work for District
eliminating hospital workers
union so we're keenly aware of
especially the lack of OBGYN to
those areas that I that I
mentioned so is there a
statewide coordinated effort to
do that for are are there just
sort of all these folks to help
us there is a state Madam chair
representative there is a state
working on finding on the name
maybe there is a statewide
recruitment
entity that particularly
recruits to the underserved
areas to move at the O. H. part
help and then.
Anyone that is participating
this is going to be administered
by the office to protest
insurance administers the
patient compensation fund so
anyone that is trying to find
out about it and get coverage
and how the that works will be
informed about this availability
so if you're checking out as
doctors are checking out as
residents are checking out how
arms malpractice system here
this is the among the things
that with the thank they would
learn about.
So just finish up in here is
that Jerry Harrison or Charlie
office I think.
Charlie okay yeah okay
okay and he's a deal which.
No he's a contractor.
Madam chair representative and I
I apologize I'm totally blanking
on the name of the organization
Jerry brown's that recruits for
underserved areas
and
but also the department of
health is responsible and
through the medical school and
so forth in their training they
have programs for
Recruitment.
On providers to the state this
country.
In the studio.
Of chair representative I think
I have one more question and so
that is in terms of looking at
this fifty million looking at
the criteria that you set out
and so that you know the number
of years
do you have a sense of.
How much for each provider and
how long that fifteen million
last.
I'm.
Madam chair and representative
I don't
I I can see in honor of former
superintendent has anything to
hate you this department to the
study of how many independents
are out there that are
participating in the patient
compensation fund so we could
come up with
some kind of an estimate of how
much it would we would need
to to do this for independent
providers so that's where that's
where the seventy million came
from was based on at as close as
we can get knowing this
providers who are participating
in any this New Mexico health
resources.
Thank you this was in New Mexico
health resources you.
Thank you madam chair I have a
request okay thank you
Representative Herndon thank you
madam chair and at present
there's so when I look at the
the level of reimbursement for
insurance premiums we start at
twenty five percent in the lower
years zero three but here's my
concern if I'm practicing
medicine I'm going to be I'm at
the highest rate because of this
started so the insurance
companies don't know what I'm
going to do if I would
practicing for awhile just
companies not haven't had very
many practices against me so I'm
my insurance premium should be
lowered it just seems like the
amount of the reimbursement
should be we.
So the people coming in and the
early years of their lives of
their practice to be in the
higher reimbursement are yeah
reimbursement for their medical
malpractice about the lowest so
tell me what you would think you
because that's what I'm seeing
Madam chair and representative
one this is meant to retain
doctors here longer so the
longer you're here the more help
you get but to participate in
the and someone correct me if
I'm wrong to participate in the
fun that's not I that's not
based on what you're is that two
hundred fifty you have to get to
them participate in the patient
compensation fund is not based
on your history of planes.
That the amount that you paid
spots on your.
Session what does that stand
madam chair and presenters is
that the longer to practice my
insurance premiums are likely to
go down because I haven't had a
claim the end higher.
Matt.
Madam chair representative
that may be true if you're
purchasing completely
independently on the private
market says all based on what
your experiences than you might
have
lower claims but a lot of it is
not based on the individual
provider but on the type of
profession.
The specialty area this is the
clarifying question as I look at
this bill.
It looks like it's going to help
dot keep doctors in rural areas
and help rural areas more which
is good because that's what we
wanted to if I remember
correctly if doctors are part of
the planning they would be
considered part of a hospital
association so it would not be
subject to this of my reading
this right along madam chair and
representative there could be
clinics that are associated with
hospitals and their our clinics
that are are free standing and
not owned by hospitals so the
Presbyterian office in their
their offices are owned by
Presbyterian Hospital system
there are other clinics or I
have to agencies that have
nothing to do with ownership by
a hospital or a health larger
health systems FQHCs are
federally qualified health
centers community health center
so madam chair.
Each one of the doctors of those
times with these would be
eligible for the funds that you
are the staff and Madam chair
representative yes and then
Madam chair representative and
distant understanding that we
when you said we are asking for
money is this money being
maintained by the department of
insurance Madam chair
representative I apologize I'm
speaking on behalf of the office
governor yes I'm on contract as
a health policy adviser to
governor has in her budget
junior budget money request
fifteen million so but the Madam
chair in the seventy million yes
what is this is the governor's
bill the seventy million as well
as
what was requested so madam
chair members of Madam
representative the money for the
reimbursement is going to come
directly from the governor's
office she's responsible for
maintaining law now.
Into the project madam chair.
It goes into the budget but this
is her portion of the budget
request
and request just like.
I do we help through the
legislature and Kerry I think
Representative Hochman Vigil but
this is the governor's bill
governor's initiative.
It is a governor's priority of
I'm just understanding funds.
Madam chair representative the
funds go to the office of
secretary okay
that's what is being dispensed
okay thank you that was the
clarification
So madam chair Madam Diseno one
last question here it.
In order for those funded and
this and the bill to go forward
it looks like it will cause yes
fifteen million dollars in there
so it's that unfunded mandate
but
Where it is not clear where you
we are the system of the
criteria the system for
dispensing the fifties fifteen
million and if that no more.
madam chair and representative
the offices seclusion chair and
spending on how much money there
is year to year and what the
priority is to develop the
criteria.
Thank you madam chair you so
welcome to the world of health
care for the more you know the
less you know and.
So we do need to adopt the
amendment but Monica had to step
out so we will do that just
don't don't let me forget to go
back to that so Representative
Jones yes thank you madam chair
confusing is the truth Business
I I do appreciate the that that
the government recognizes that
we have a medical malpractice
crisis and so this bill does
acknowledge that
So.
What's disappointing is that
we're relying on the tax payers
to.
And and for and I understand
this is not a recurring
appropriation so so we're going
to rely more every year.
On the tax except it is that
right
Madam chair representative and I
should actually clarified this
creates on non reverting fund so
at the state treasury and the
these
Office of the superintendent
insurance administers the fund
that has appropriated from the
legislature out of that.
That's that's technically how
that works but I Madam chair
representative yes we'll have to
keep coming back to try and
increase the funds available
that appropriations available
into that fund so that we can
continue to do it and madam
chair and representative
the state in the state taxpayers
do a lot of things to pay to try
and recruit and retain
of providers in the state just
as I mentioned we've got loan
repayment programs and and
expanded residency programs and
a variety of tools in the
toolbox if you will that our
state initiatives and
legislatively program funds to
do that to try and shore up our
health care system yes I I
appreciate that and one of those
bills you need to set.
Yeah thank you and have such an
interesting thing whatever we
can to help health care because
all all the way around we're in
need in New Mexico but
specifically this this addresses
medical malpractice crisis that
we created Google.
I think I'll never realize that
what I I'd like to ask you about
is and I don't fully understand
is like the.
Depending clinics that we we
that were out we're hearing and
Testified in need and their
inability to get insurance at
all of those people would they
not be eligible for this and
since they can't meet this two
hundred fifty thousand.
The participate madam chair and
representative right now on some
of the issue with those
providers is that they are
classified as the same as
hospitals and have to have a
higher level of insurance and
that's what they're saying is
that they can't get enough of
their based insurance to cover
that this is a different this is
different
groups those
is there for and Campbell Tory
surgical centers this is an
independent practitioners and on
independent group practitioners
for their that fall under the
independent for the provider I
caps not the hospital campus.
Okay.
No okay and that so that
insurance is not impossible.
Yeah well I I'm pretty sure that
that the people we were
addressing the people I was
talking to recently when we we
heard HB eighty eight were
independent fully independent
and and then and
As of January when the
They will be they will be
closing the the the closing or
selling out because they can't
because they are independent and
they they can't get insurance
so.
So is there anybody in the room
that can confirm that and madam
chair and representative but
those were they might have been
an independent group that they
had a surgical facility.
True this is our first
nonsurgical.
groups is that this this and
this does not help those
independent clinics ambulatory
facility independent physicians
with military facilities is that
what they're in a different
Madam chair representative there
any different classifications
and different amount of
insurance that they have to
carry that and that these
providers.
I'm sorry mention I keep
forgetting to go through
something to get that that money
here there's a lot going on yes
so.
The media is so we're not
talking about those people being
eligible then.
Wow that totally changes the way
I was looking at this completely
Yes because of because I still
see that as I said.
During H. B. eighty eight that
we're going to be in such
terrible condition when those
clinics closed and we don't have
those the access to care like we
did before
so I I know there is somebody
mention of the G. lands and I
remember that
Madam chair.
Representative.
Representative Armstrong that
there was a women's care clinic
family clinic women's health
care clinic right here in Santa
Fe that some danger close.
That are really jumped out at me
because I know how much we need
to do to plans and they're not
even for this correct.
you madam chair and
representative yes they're not
owned by the hospital then they
would be.
If they're not owned by the
hospital that they're unable to
get insurance.
They're able to carry two
hundred fifty thousand dollars
to participate.
Madam chair representative
anyone.
Can help me on the independent
providers getting two hundred
fifty thousand I don't think
that that's an issue a practice
coverage of this of the two
hundred fifty is not an issue if
those surgical centers that
can't get
up to five or six million
because of classified hospitals
and that's a whole different
thing and that's not anything to
do with this it's not the same
providers.
But there are a lot of
independent providers probably
Madam chair representative
probably seventy percent of the
providers in the state are owned
by hospitals
but there's still a chunk of
those out there who are
struggling to try and remain
independent and those are the
ones that is targeted for so
that they can
and again it's
It is not the same issue as as
everything out of whack and
malpractice for that group
that's been here is not trying
to fix that this is a tool for
recruiting and retaining
independent providers in the
state
and so that they're not into of
all being bought out by
hospitals it's just one more
thing to try and recruit retain
individual practitioners and
we're just we're going to go to
caring who is our
analysis at the end.
This is the main secure if you
could maybe come up and get
close to a Mike.
I hope I don't.
If you spans more when we heard
the testimony on eighty eight
there was some confusion about
the difference because they were
asking to be separated out of
that portion of the
of the not malpractice of.
Thanks act that we have right
now where is they are classified
as former representative
Armstrong said there are
classified within the same
arena that hospitals are
classified whether or not
they're owned by a hospital
that's how their business have
their charge and this because
they provide a higher level of
care essentially hospital level
of care as I understand it
that's why they were classified
in that category what
Representative Armstrong former
representative Armstrong
Representative Hochman Vigil are
talking about are small
independent clinics like primary
care clinics and clinics that
exist without any affiliation to
a hospital for without any level
of care that would require them
to be classified in the same way
as a class of clinic that for
example dust Gastroenterol logy
or does surgery that's
considered a hospital level of
care so it's it's the way they
are classified and they were
asking by that filled to the
sort of declassified from that
status so that they could better
for health insurance but there's
a time for primary care clinics
in the state that are not
classified as that because they
do not provide that kind of high
level of care and they're
completely in the pan ready and
they have no relationship to
hospitals so that's who this
bill is really trying to attract
is those people who are just
providing primary care lower
lower levels of care in remote
rural areas and you know they're
not getting paid very much and
so this is as has been mentioned
just an additional tool to say
maybe there's this extra little
step we could take to make it
possible for you to purchase
health care insurance on your
own they don't get any help from
anybody else okay this year and
Representative looks like two
different levels of independence
yeah Madam chair representative.
Have.
House Bill ADA.
Asked.
So that they were still remained
the same as independent
practitioners and not hospitals
then yes this would apply.
Okay so madam chair what you're
saying is this is not a fix for
our medical malpractice crisis
no no okay it's a fifty six for
our lack of providers okay who
for which we were out because of
the crisis okay so so one thing
that you did say I appreciate
your help with that but madam
chair and turn.
You did say that and this is
this is kind of off topic but I
just want to make sure that.
It's corrected these clinics
that are not eligible for this
they don't charge the same as
hospitals.
They don't their their their
service much more affordable so
I just wanted to clear that up
because they don't
So anyway it just sounds like
this this is not the bill I
thought it was hello I thought
it was and it's kind of a
bandaid even for has independent
people that we're trying to help
I can't support it.
Representative.
Thank you madam chair.
I'm trying to figure out how to
the state this.
Ask is parses of possibly can.
Is this a seventy million.
Support trial attorneys.
Madam chair and representative
no this would go directly into
the hands of providers it's a
reimbursement to providers.
Would you be willing to change
it.
To where it paid out straight to
my malpractice claims.
Instead of anything else.
Christopher's you madam chair
and representative that's the
malpractice at this is a tool to
help financially support.
it has
if you will is if we said if you
have a a practice will help pay
some of your over had a rural
health is a lot of you stayed
here this is one of your
expenses that we can
legitimately
reverse like a loan repayment
you have loans outstanding will
help you pay your loans the
longer you stay here this is
will help you pay those premiums
we know you have the longer you
stay here it has nothing to do
with it seems like it because
it's paying for malpractice
premiums it has nothing to do
with how the actual malpractice
act works and the patient
compensation fund works has
nothing to do with that.
Madam chair representative
Vincent this is simply a way to
make sure that our practitioners
not healthcare providers remain
insured.
It's always okay and madam chair
representative.
I want to make sure if there's
any attorneys in here I do like
it turns I replaced.
I just in my mind I just if.
You know when you get visions
money maxi trial turns just
warming because we have seventy
million that taxpayers are gonna
pay for malpractice insurance
and I just see that money going
into trial attorneys pockets
instead of going into the
pockets.
Of the people so when we listen
to eighty eight.
And you know things sometimes
things just need our your money
and I listen to a man that have
lost a child due malpractice and
then I saw a man pull as I am
because of malpractice now
that's in my mind and now I'm
I'm focused on malpractice and I
want to for the fellow that once
the losses I I don't want to see
a trial attorney get the money I
want him to get Representative
in support we're not because it
is thus far.
The smart trial attorneys or
anyone else.
No but I'm just saying that's
the vision I have in my head.
Share.
Madam chair representative I I
appreciate that I have a
daughter who went to the
malpractice system for
malpractice and the caps were
not found it doesn't fail for
staff and yes we had a trial.
to help us do that so I I
understand
this does not pay into the
malpractice fund which would be
a source of funds to pay
attorney's fees for going to
that system it doesn't have
anything to do with the patient
compensation.
It doesn't go there because into
a different fine to directly
reach.
Find.
Or
practicing in New Mexico.
And staying in New Mexico who
practices.
Thank you Mr.
Thank you very much Madam chair
representative I just have one
could you explain to us why this
is not a violation of the anti
defamation.
You madam chair and
representative we have at many
programs like loan repayment
program or or others that are
initiatives of the state for a
public purpose and our public
health
and safety purpose for which you
can apply for funds and this is
one of the you have to apply you
have to meet criteria and
and so it's it's a tool that is
not any different than paying
longer payment for providers.
Merrimack's chair representative
through I think the key is the
fund so the creation of a fund
and the application of an
application process to that fund
is what allows through the
settlement process necessary to
render the intonation Clause
You're irrelevant in this case.
Thank you thank.
A couple of statements just to
put him out in the world so and
we here we know that there are a
lot of people who are licensed
in New Mexico who do not
practice in New Mexico and I
just want to make sure that we
have we take that into account
when we're looking at and what
we're what we're finding and and
then I had some previous
concerns about some of the
professions that were on and
they can that they didn't
probably.
Need as much help as as let's
say you know just.
Private position kind of folks
so and then also I had visions
in my head of some position in
if we pay their malpractice
insurance they're going to use
the money to get a new point and
that is not the idea of this at
all that that there will be some
sort of needs means testing or
with this office of the
superintendent
will determine which professions
meet the criteria and and
whether there's a of financial
need or not so can you.
Can you.
Talk a little bit about that
madam chair and and share your
manager
it does allow the offices
superintendent to create the
criteria based on the priorities
of the state
because of the state funds and
it is being I used for purpose
to recruit and retain the type
and where we need providers so
that right teria um at the state
it's it's a million dollars
instead of fifty million dollars
is going to be really tight
criteria the practicing here
you're practicing and in a rural
area here at OPG want whatever
that is at that time if there's
seventy million yes you know I
would assume there would still
be in
criteria for priorities of the
state but they may not be as
strict because we have
sufficient funds to help all
levels and again the providers
that are on here of the same
ones that are in statute to
participate in the.
Patient compensation.
