Since we may have questions for

All right.
Force your is thank you madam
chair it's great to be here this
morning thank you committee for
making me feel welcome.
So House Bill three oh fires a.
I will do is give just a little.
And then
I'll.
And then I do have a committee
substitute as well
When the time is right I can
discuss that.
So it was about a year ago
madam chair members of the
committee that we had.
kind of a terrifying experience
at Cleveland high school here in
Rio Rancho.
Was a Valentine's day and a
young man.
Ought to go to school.
she had a list
that said.
No kill girlfriend and others
and then take wife.
and he went to his girlfriend
with a gun.
And
Thankfully luckily Americal I I
don't know the gun misfired in
the jam.
And what this young man did as
he then panicked we threw the
gun and ran out of the school.
He was later found hiding and
that sh
And the.
everyone was okay you know we
back with the school but
everyone's okay.
This young man
So it's found it twice
incompetent for trial.
you just.
No had some some challenges.
And because she was a minor
and and and I learned this wall
wall you're kind of scoring our
statutes here because he was a
minor there was really nothing
that can be done at that point
she was just released.
And.
you know if of course the the
girlfriend and her mom
You know we're we're for what
one scared because obviously you
know where they live.
but also she was his girlfriend
they cared about this for
Medicare we still care about
this young.
And and want him to get the help
that he needs.
And so I was working with the
come almost of this girlfriend
these last many months or the
intro on to legislation.
that you see in front of you.
Which.
Basically says minor.
Is charged with a felony.
and this team will more likely
than not to be arm to themselves
or someone else.
that's a then we'll get to
treatments that HSD needs to
contract
provide treatment.
To the east these individuals.
And and we we we do the best we
could drafting this legislation
went through several iterations.
but.
Madam chair spoke with us to
important people
the first after talking with the
chair Chasey she recommended I
talk with judge Romero a retired
judge Romero and that was a
fascinating conversation
I will go to all the detail here
but it was a long conversation
about all the different
challenges that we have in our
children's code.
And all the things that he
respects and I was very much
overwhelmed very pretty quickly
with all those things that need
to be done.
but in the end cute General
agreed that this was a step or
two in the right direction
then the second person I spoke
with madam chair and I'm so
grateful you connected us was Dr
Neil brown.
Thank you could and that she had
Two major suggestions are ways
we can improve the bill.
and so that's that's why I have
a committee sub for you now and
it
was a good time madam chair we
can discuss that at yes I'll
move this up for discussion so
that you can
tell us about where you ended up
in and in designing this
legislation.
Thank you madam chair
so they I'm just so folks have
in case there wanting to verify
that the number is two two zero.
Two eight one point two.
And then the two and it was
distributed and should be in the
Here file.
Thank you madam chair.
The two big differences that
were made in the southern few
other little ones I can talk
about the two big ones that
drive going mention.
First it is correct that HSD has
responsibility for this work.
but it has been the practice for
a lot of readers a memorandum of
understanding or or some agree
to.
Some arrangement.
That CYFD is really the the
entity that takes care of these
kinds of situations for minors.
So we made those made that clear
in the substitute.
And the second is
we had to put some.
When we were looking at okay how
long is this treatment occurred
like will help it's no longer
needed and tell there are
received major or and other
competency on trial with the
language we have put in there
essentially made it so that we
can use Medicaid funds
and so.
The.
Was not aware of that so we made
that change as well so in this
committee order
the the language now
Does not restrict the use of
Medicaid funds for.
For these purposes.
And and and maybe another minor.
Change in the original bill
there was a kind of us last
weird three part test I just
really didn't sound quite right
And so we we made it more clear
and we made it just a.
A two part test that.
Madam chair will just.
So to hear I think I'll be.
I'll be done.
What the explaining the bill in
the substitute it's on page
eight it says the child shall
remain in residential treatment
for the location facility yes.
One the child has been charged
with a felony offense.
To there is evidence that
childhood is a likelihood of
serious harm to the child self
or others.
And the next alright after the
new language on page nine it
says this question residential
treatment hesitation facility
pursuant to section above.
Charmaine that placement child
reaches age major.
Or tell the child is completed a
trial.
So that's that is really.
the meeting the substance of of
the bill.
it was that manager I'd be happy
to stand for questions.
Thank you Representative
and we'll we'll take care of
formerly the the substitute when
we go to questions but that was
helpful for the audiences
Let's see on hold on just a sec
I just got a message that
Representative Montoya is having
trouble with the law a link if
if Doris if you can follow up
with him.
Thank you so before we go to the
audience we usually do a poll.
to see how many are in support
or opposition to the legislation
the kind of the equivalent if we
were in person raising your hand
in the room so if Gabrielle if
you could put the pull up for
house bill three oh five.
And if you are here in the
audience in support or
opposition if you could.
Way and we'll give you a few
more seconds.
Okay.
All right I think that's I think
we're there we've got a fifty
fifty split R. for in support
and foreign opposition.
We will go first next to the
audience for those in opposition
who wish to speak if you can
raise your hand.
As an opposition and we'll start
with Kim Chavez Cook.
And as you get started can I
know we have the time or up just
to be aware of being assistant
in your comments but this is
really important and and so
we're not going to cut you off
but
go ahead.
Thank you madam chair I
appreciate that and thank you to
members of the committee and
thank you to the sponsor for
bringing a bill to try to
address what I I agree is that
definitely a gap in our ability
to intervene for children in
need who have acted out but also
to ensure public safety while I
support the idea of making some
changes to address that I do
have serious concerns about this
particular approach I would very
much be interested in in working
with a sponsor to find a way
that that does this without
causing what I see as in
functionally an indefinite
you know with a commitment for
someone because of competency
issues where the dangerous miss
finding I think we need to be
fleshed out a little bit more
because I feel that we're going
to run the risk of casting the
net too broadly on children who
could then be taken from their
families and placed into a
facility for years and years
potentially if it goes to the
age of majority are treating to
competency is not always
possible depending on the
underlying diagnosis and we've
learned a lot in the adult
system I see that my time is
left a promise all wrapped up
soon but I go ahead go ahead
counting thank you so I just
wanted to say I I you know I
that is really my main concern
here is that I do think it has
the potential the unintended a
potential to result in a lot of
really lengthy commitments for
children who maybe wouldn't
benefit as much from that and so
I would love to get some
stakeholders together to really
work on the best way to do this
that that relies on a lot of the
lessons we learned from the
adult competencies system where
we've done so much work and so
much litigation to figure out
where due process is satisfied
and I think that we could
probably develop something in
the.
S. context as well so for those
reasons we propose that oppose
the bill as written thank you so
much.
Thank you next we have for non
go Trujillo.
Go ahead Fernando.
You madam chair members of the
committee my name is federal law
through your and I'm a policy
associate with oil futures we
appreciate those bonds is
concern for the well being of
young people in New Mexico
including those who may need
treatment and the ability shin
Services there is certainly a
great need to expand the the the
services for young people in the
that she then of this support
services and I state but after
reading the bill we have
concerns that young people with
disabilities living and cycle
the substance use and more could
be held in residential treatment
or rehabilitation facilities
indefinite the.
What state in the programming
can be helpful for some use
young people also need options
to exit formal systems of care
and get community support for
that reason we cannot support
this bill thank you.
Thank you next we have Allison
pock.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is Allison pop
and I'm an attorney who for the
past fourteen years have
primarily representing juveniles
in their delinquency cases in
children's court although I do
agree that there is a hole in
the system in New Mexico for
these young people today I'm
going to share a story with this
legislation could do to a young
person I represent a young a
thirteen year old boy currently
who was a single felony charge
of battery on a health care
worker which he received while
he was in the hospital yes
cognitive issues is incompetent
will never become competent he's
currently in residential
treatment out of state and
Medicaid is paying under this
bill or even a substitute this
child could be a residential
treatment for five years to the
age of majority because he will
never attain competency and also
he hits people or.
One of the issues as you what is
considered harm to oneself or
others there's no case law on
this issue for juveniles if you
threatened suicide will he ever
get out also who will pay after
Medicaid stopped paying eight
hundred dollars a day to keep a
child in residential treatment
supply is the only the O. H.
state run facility and they
don't take children with
cognitive issues are lower I
cues and what about girls
there's no place in the state
for girls who have cognitive
issues so what I see is that
this bill could unintentionally
find a big black hole for these
young people who we already
struggle finding placement and
help for thank you.
Thank you next will have those
who are here in support and wish
to speak if you could raise your
hand.
Anyone wish to speak in support.
Okay seeing none we'll go to
members of the committee
of first of all let's take care
of the substitute and which I
move for discussion is there any
Any discussion on the
substitute.
Versus the original.
Any objection to adopting the
substitute.
Seeing and hearing on your your
bill's been substituted
Representative Harper and so
we'll go to questions and I have
Representative Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative Harper for
bringing this forward I've had
discussions with my D. A. and
in several of my counties and
and this is not only an issue
for juvenile for being
incompetent but it's also one
and the issue with the adult
and so I I appreciate you
bringing this I think that there
needs to be something done madam
chair we it's a revolving door
and that the specially the
juveniles are not getting the
help that they need after
they've become.
Incompetent or or noted that
they are incompetent and and the
they're getting no help and I I
appreciate the Avenue that
you're trying to take and I
wondered if
doctor Baldwin had anything to
say to add.
To what he thinks about this he
didn't say anything Mr madam
chair and Mr Representative.
Dr bone.
Yes madam chair.
Representative Armstrong and and
members of the committee thank
you very much it is urgent for
me to point out that in my role
as a director Miss Vigil
Services Division I'm not
allowed to to support or oppose
this bill so I'm I'm I'm happy
to speak to technical aspects of
it
and.
The points that that that I
would make I think I am very
grateful for any discussion of
trying to to fill in this gap in
services and and Representative
Armstrong you're quite right
it's a it's an issue for adults
as well as for children we know
that when issues of competency
or raised people stay much
longer in jail than than they do
if competency issues are not are
not graced and and and I think
that's another issue that needs
to be faced
the point that that the ability
and virtually unplayable by
eight by Medicaid is very
directly related to to that
issue treatment to competency is
not considered medically
necessary.
And so at the federal level CMS
prohibits payments from either
Medicaid or Medicare for things
which are not medically
necessary so so treatment
competency could never be paid
by Medicaid regardless of how
the bill is right now not right
but but treatment for the
underlying issues is is urgent
and necessary and and and
figuring out could system which
does not have that inadvertent
aspect of
Mandatory confinement.
Indefinite period of time I
think is this really an urgent
aspect and it's clearly part of
the intent of this bill.
So I think that's what I have to
say at this point thank you very
much for the question.
Thank you so much doctor bone
appreciate that we madam chair I
would really encourage the
The interim health committee to
to and possibly are I I don't
know we need some judicial
people we need a lot of people
at the table to discuss this and
I would really encourage the
interim committee health
committee to take a hard look at
this I know madam chair that we
just passed legislation last
year where in incarcerated.
Where they don't have to click
the cliffs on incarcerated
people for Medicaid and Medicare
so that cliff doesn't or
Medicaid the cliff doesn't
is no longer there so we can
keep them on that and treat the
underlying problems that that we
need to so I appreciate the
conversation and the intent of
the bill and I don't really have
any other questions but I would
really like to be involved in
trying to to our help solve this
issue thank you madam chair.
Thank you next to have the
Representative Lord.
Okay want to make sure my
microphone is working can you
hear me madam chair we can very
quickly gosh okay I can't
apologize to keep having some
sort of issues and and thank you
madam chair and thank you
representatives for this bill
and it.
I want to ask does anybody
remember the parkland shooter
was horrific Nicholas Cruz that
the decade I use him as an
example all the time.
So many things went wrong with
that shooting incident
That kid had a bunch of issues
and that were unfortunate that
we're never to handled.
He made numerous threats
everybody knew he was going to
do that shooting at the school
for two years.
He's broadcasted on social media
that he was going to shoot up
the school.
That he fell through the cracks.
And it's unfortunate because
this is one of those things that
could have been prevented this
shooting at parkland could have
this is one of the ones were all
the signs were there he he told
everybody he was gonna do the
shooting put it on social media
put pictures of him with his
economic saying he was going to
shoot up the school and it was
one that fell through the cracks
on so many levels they took him
to a mental health facility and
said he was fine and let him go
and that was so unfortunate they
didn't do a proper valuation on
him.
The FBI admitted they let it
fall through the cracks and fell
through the cracks on multiple
levels so I'm always looking for
ways that we can prevent
horrific incidents from
happening and I'm hoping that
this might be one of the ways
that we could prevent a future
shooting because a lot of these
kids that do that they broadcast
it that they're going to do it.
And I know US senator Kerr
Brandt even came up with a good
bill last year and fortune died.
That said if a child broadcast
that they're gonna do a shooting
that they could be arrested on a
felony for than I thought that
was actually could still but
that died anyway so thank you
for bringing this forward that's
all I really wanted to say is
that I just wonder money people
that that Nicolas Cruz is a
perfect incident a perfect
example where this child was a
harm to himself and others
because I think you also
broadcast that he wanted to kill
himself to and this kid fell
through the cracks and I would
like anything we can do to shut
to stop a future incident like
that happening I think we should
look at all avenues so thank you
for bringing this bill forward
and thank you for telling my
technical issues thank you madam
chair thank you Representative
Ferrary.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative
I was just wondering what would
be considered at its of
likelihood of serious harm to
self or others.
Madam chair and the which of
course thank you vice chair for
for that question so we do as a
definition.
What that means it's on page
four the substitute.
It says are likelihood of
serious harm to self or others
means.
Is more likely than not in the
near future the troubles select
serious bodily harm child self
or another person or committed
criminal sexual offense as
evidenced by behavior causing
attempting or threatening such
harm.
Which behavior gives rise to a
reasonable fear of such harm.
Madam chair and vice chair.
Ferrary I think.
I would just add that
I was very grateful for some of
the comments that we got from
the audience and
one of the comments from miss
cook was that perhaps for
testing and are not a little too
broadly.
Was that definition and I would
I would very much
I like to work with her to make
sure we got that right
Thank you representative madam
chair so that are paid even if
someone just has suicidal
thoughts and and mentions that
to someone that could invoke
this whole chain reaction you
know putting them into treatment
and and and what if they you
know stayed there for their
whole adolescence I mean this I
think is very
Yeah I think is good but I think
the even with all of your
changes for the subcommittee I
think it's really going to be
our our.
Harmful to a lot of young people
or even adults.
The.
Could be caught up in this for a
long time and just by someone
making an accusation about it
could also trigger this whole
chain reaction so
Representative I.
Thank you and support your bill
they have so so madam chair and
and madam vice chair I I very
much appreciate those comments
and.
And I just want to say I'm.
I'm trying to solve a small part
of a very big problem.
Some of the comments that were
raised about you know what we do
for girls no judge Romero said
you should have language in this
bill saying that HSD has to
contract with us analysts.
You know your existing
company or or or develop one
that allows treatment for girls.
and you know and I would love to
do that but at that point I
think.
You know this perhaps this will
and we'll leave are just so many
things that need to be
addressed.
The three issues that I heard
raised in public comment I think
are issues that we can fix.
the first we've talked about is
making sure not cast in that too
broadly right it's not my intent
that if someone is suicidal
thoughts your you know makes
just the on off and statement
that we're gonna then walked him
up forever right that's not my
intent.
So we can fix that the second
was a duration.
Right and I think it is not my
intent to have a a searching
your old
You know in a residential
treatment facility until their
The I'm not a minor anymore.
so so we can we can fix that.
And then the other is what
lessons can we learn from the
adult competency and I loved to
hear that and include that in
I will mention this bill has no
impact on the bills this is only
dealing with us
minor that is committed a
felony.
And
But.
I could find self harm or harm
to others.
So are.
I would just ask madam chair and
vice chair Ferrary you know
everyone that.
Voiced opposition so that this
is a gap so we need to fix.
Now to see what's.
Let's take a step or two to try
to fix this gap do it the best
way we can.
Thank you Representative.
Madam chair that's all.
Thank you next we have
Representative Matthews.
Thank you let me find my video
here not be a voice just out of
it screen.
And I show up.
your your ceiling fan certainly
does.
That's my biggest fan in the
world.
My only fan in the entire world
is that's a big thing.
Thank you Representative Harper
thank you for taking on this
issue when I was at madam chair
I'm sorry madam chair
Representative Harper when I was
a very very young lawyer I was
appointed to represent a young
man Albert to page twelve and
had tried to hang himself.
Albert's mother had died of a
drug overdose his father had
been murdered.
and I trying to find a placement
with this family and so forth to
take to deal with Albert and it
was just.
hit me in the face at a at a
point in time when I was.
Didn't really have any idea how
to try to work on a problem like
this that we really had
absolutely no facilities to deal
with a child like Albert.
and I as I heard as I listen to
your story Representative.
And to issue statement one is.
Is.
By the time this young man acted
out and there had to have been a
history of I'm assuming it was
wasn't unlike as send drug
Mastin induced something but
there had been a history and it
it acted to me one of the
questions that your bill raises
is what was happening with his
child in the years prior to this
incident and was he getting help
and where their facilities
available said that's.
Question number one for me.
Second issue that your bill
raises is what how do we move
somebody to the quote two point
competency for purposes of legal
proceeding and that again is a
burden is it is an issue that as
a as a society in New Mexico we
have not done a good job on and
show on both of those we've got
some real challenges.
issue and I'm not trying to.
I'm gonna raise is because
people are parts of
environments.
And madam chair Representative
Harper and.
One of the I'm.
I I have a memory of this case
somewhere from the newspapers
and
one of the issues that hit me
when I was reading about it was
these parents with a child like
that apparently had a gun in the
house and they didn't do
anything to keep that child from
getting that gun.
And so there's another issue
about how we protect our
children and how we protect
society
And I am at I I agree with Madam
chair representative Harper I
agree with others who are
concerned about of a program
that would include and it's
effecting Carceri somebody.
For years and years without
hearings and so forth and I'm
wondering if
we can learn anything from
other states if they have some
programs that we could start to
look at I'm wondering if maybe
even we should be looking at
other countries and I'm
wondering if part of the
solution is not in identifying
some relief intervention.
Kinds of strategies and not
waiting for it to get to the
point where we've got a kid you
know with a gun
pointing at people
and those are all things we need
to work on and I appreciate I
really appreciate that you are
undertaken this and like
Representative Armstrong
It it.
What was so weird I went fixing
is is it is kind of a trite word
but but assembling a rational
and effective and funded mental
health system in the state for
our children and our people
and making safety is part of our
gun laws in the proprioceptive
stances in the appropriate ways
I think I think we absolutely
need to be doing and I I would
get I would also be willing to
work with you on this these
kinds of issues.
This budget bill today but.
But but but thank you for for
raising the issue and let's
figure out how to how to do this
in a way that we don't
incarcerate somebody for years
and years when we didn't need
to.
Thank you.
Thank you representative
Thompson.
You.
Let me get into a groove
Committee mode thank you madam
chair I'm so I to have some
issues I I I hear where you're
coming from but when I hear
about kids who may have
intellectual disabilities and
and that that that such that we
I'm it we don't have facilities
for kids in general but when we
start talking about an
intellectual disability or
autism for instance I mean I I
think back to what people saw
I'm my son do or
or I particularly in a
healthcare setting he would
freak out and he he he knocked
that dentist over he throw me
across that and are
Essential and our prep room and
and so those things are really
scary to me so I'm like
everybody else that I know we
need to do something I just
don't know what it is I'm I'm
working with someone and.
From from UNM center on
development disability about a
young man with autism whose kind
of been this and they've he's
been at the children's
psychiatric hospital that they
want to keep your mouth and
there's nowhere for him to go
and it's just we we have big
problems to fix that would help
with this but I I'm not sure
that this is the right way but I
Representative Harper I really
do appreciate what you're trying
to do because school shootings
are just.
We we need to do something we
just have to as everyone else is
that we just have to figure out
how to do it what to do and in
New Mexico we unfortunately
don't have a lot of options for
kids I'm I will tell you a quick
story I worked with a young man
and at Burley high school who
outwardly look like you know he
was he he hung out with the cool
kids but he had an intellectual
disability and the cool kids had
him still waiting in the cool
kids had him doing a lot of
things and he you know if he
ever got caught he would not be
competent but but like I said he
at you know on first appearance
it looks like he he's he's he's
relate with that but when you
hello deeper he really wasn't
and I eight for a kid like that
who's being used by the
typically developing kids to get
caught up so.
So thank you thank you
Representative Harper thank you
madam chair.
Thank you thank you thank you
Representative Lord did you have
any question I I I did at
another committee thank you
madam chair who is a tough
morning this morning I think I'm
still tired from the night
apologize so I just wanted to
bring up something that well why
everyone's talking I did go back
and look up that parkland
shooter and it's a hard thing
because I'm upset about what he
did but my heart breaks for how
he never got the care that he
needed I was going through and
he did he tried to kill himself
he he tried to kill himself
before two months before the
event he was often heard
muttering to himself just kill
me and there was no follow
through this kid.
Breaks my heart he he's this is
not and he's not anomaly either
there's a lot of instances for
the kids before they did the
shooting again so many signs
that they were going to do it
and they keep slipping through
the cracks the sheriff's
department had been called
twenty three times twenty three
times to his house and no follow
through on anything and I'm
looking on here it said there
was abuse domestic violence
missing person all kinds of
calls on this and again he just
fell through the cracks at the
end it turns out it looks like
and I didn't see the diagnosis
it looks like this park it had
schizophrenia.
And that he had heard demonic
voices.
And this is one of the kids we
have to figure out somehow
Republicans Democrats we got a
fake for get together how do we
stop this before we get to hear
right because I think you know
me I like my gun rights and I'm
gonna tell you you know as well
as I do some of our most
horrific
Horrific murder as part of the
killings and America were by
plane and by you.
Bombings except for us so if
people are going to kill the
gonna find a way would I would
rather do is get to the root
cause how do we stop Nicholas
Cruz from doing this again in
America how do we stop this from
happening in New Mexico and we
honestly have got to sit down
and talk these things through.
I totally understand this bill
we're trying to go in that
direction I'm him some
resistance to it but if it
doesn't get passed and we do
need to sit down all of us
together and figure out how do
we.
Because this bill right here is
for a necklace Cruz to get him
into the care that he needs long
term care because he is
definitely a risk himself to
others and these kids are
getting it not New Mexico not
Florida not anywhere some.
We have a bigger issue that we
need to tackle I just want to
bring up that.
This is the bill that would fit
for this child and I understand
other people's concerns but I
just wanted to.
Okay I get kicked now I'm still
there additional then got kicked
out and I was still there those
we're dissing Everseen anyways
that's it I guess it the the I.
T. guy Thomas stop talking so
thank you.
Thank you Representative Lord
Representative Terrazas.
You madam chair and good morning
everybody just wanted to give of
the representative opportunity
to he says I think we can fix
those things is what I heard
Madam chair representative all
of those what would you suggest
to fix those issues that were
brought up all sure that this
committee what what would your
recommendations be in the fixes
that you could do.
So madam chair and
representative process thank you
for that question
And and I think at this point I
would just say my my my mind is
wide open.
I I really.
Would like to work with miss
Clark who very generously
offered to help.
I'm also happy to work with that
Mr R. Trujillo are missus park.
I I I agree with there are
concerns that we wanna make sure
not casting the net too widely.
we don't wanna hold
indefinitely.
and our lessons we can learn
from it also some.
So I I I would like that
opportunity to to work with them
to see if we can't resolve these
issues and then have everyone
supportive.
of legislation and if we can't
get there
You know it sounds like there's
appetite to review this during
the interim.
What I would say I think
everyone agrees there there was
a gap here.
And and I would like an option
to continue.
so in the best way we can find
to fill that that gap if
possible.
Trying to find the new button so
Madam chair representative
if that it passed if we were
able to.
I'm.
This on to the next committee
and I know there's people that
are you all is on the fence or
are concerned.
it would go through
with cemex Committee of society
I'm trying to find it here
judiciary is very.
They do you think Madam chair
representative that they would
clean up some of this.
Language to clean it up to at
least.
It
sure is.
That measurements of process
yeah that committee has a
reputation.
Lots of
Clean up in committee subs and
looking things over with a fine
tooth comb
Yeah
I'm.
I'm sure they would what it out.
If you like it was in a good
place.
That's and and Madam chair
representative I I kind of know
that quietly but I mean I'm
still new and I just you know I
say that with with humble in in
in being humble and and
cautious of but I just I I
think.
healthwise we obviously need to
move somewhere and do something
that it would be a good
conversation maybe in the next
committee I think just kinda
maybe get their ideas I think
you've got the ideas from the
health committee of where they
feel
They have some reservations and
then the you have some but you
also have the right idea as a as
a whole and so you know for that
reason I mean.
I never wanted I I I feel.
Some of the same things that
have been expressed here but I
also feel that it's in
conversation there's nothing
wrong with that.
we for our just so that we can
get those conversations
out in the table and and a lot
of people do to make those
adjustments maybe would give you
a little bit of time Madam chair
representative to talk to those
of those conversations that that
that
That you feel need to be at
before the next committee maybe
that can happen so I I will
support you in in just that.
Because of that for that reason.
Thank you madam chair
representative thank you
Representative Anderson.
Madam chair you cut out did you
call on me I did go ahead.
Thank you madam chair it it just
cut out the minute you said.
The name madam chair on the
beach short point this morning I
believe the house bill three oh
five addresses are an urgent and
important issue I am reluctant
to let this roll for another two
years of thank you madam.
I listen this morning and I
think well this this proposal is
has some has some holes.
But given the late hour we're in
in the session and thinking
about of the upcoming hearing in
judiciary should this bill go
forward I think you know a lot
of good is going to come out of
this the Sanchez work in
preparation for Judiciary and
we'll see and quite frankly
seventeen days to go I'm not
sure this bill is going to end
up on the governor's desk but I
do think this.
Dialogue and debate is very
constructive in I am looking
forward to our committee leading
this move to the next committee
thank you madam chairman.
Thank you set and I'd like to
say a couple things
Representative Harper and and
you and I've talked about about
this and tried to connect with
some additional of folks to
start working I really
appreciate that you are bringing
it forward and have a
with this identified gap and I'd
I just wanna.
Make clear a couple of things
one the child has to be charged
with a felony
and that that charge of felony
is what would be a felony if
they were an adult.
Then they have to be found to be
of harm to self or others likely
and incompetent to stand trial.
So those are the
those of the that yes but I I
too have a couple of
concerns particularly around
the
capacity is to stand trial and.
Because L. as I it as I would
you can think of the US that
could be just their age.
Would deem them incompetent to
stand trial.
Just by matter of of age I
think.
And.
As well as intellectual
disability.
And you're not going to fix the
intellectual disability piece so
that would be
and you know I've heard examples
from representative Thompson
about her son you know
it and would hate to think that.
Someone made a charge against
him and locked him up in a
facility.
to a and he's an adult now but
but and leave them there for
years when that was a an
incident that needs to be
managed but he's not going to
become competent for trial.
As well as
At yeah I just I I worry about
that a lot and I think that's a
that's a a really big issue on
this and I think that what you
heard from from the audience
from of the.
Identifying that is as a
potential issue.
I do think it's an important
conversation I don't think this
late in the session is the time
for just talking about it and
getting input by their putting
in front of another Canadian
thing is important for you to
have a first hearing what I
would suggest because I don't
know that you can get enough
stakeholders together fast
enough to fix this and I would
suspect because it's happened to
me you'll never even get past
the analyst in Judiciary to get
a hearing.
unless this is fixed in a major
way particularly about how long
you would keep someone and and
what kind of capacity issues so.
My suggestion is that we not a
table it but just hold it.
And give you an opportunity if
you want to
be able to work on it.
while we're still here in the
session we would put it in you
come back with another so we
would put it on a media LA I I
don't really think you'll get a
hearing in Judiciary in the
current status I'm just being
realistic.
in the time frame of the of the
session and the issues that the
analysts are going to have
So I can't speak exactly for the
chair but I can tell you built
with a lot less issues and a lot
less serious notice of issues
You know you gotta fix some with
the analyst before the chair
would even here so that's my
suggestion is that you do that
we just hold it keep a spot we
don't have we're just after
today we're just waiting for
Senate bills to come in and we
can put you right back on if
you're able to do something with
this otherwise I think it is a
conversation a longer
conversation with a lot of
parties for the interim in in
front of courts corrections
justice it and health and Human
Services and we sometimes do
joint meetings are which would
that would be even ideal is that
we do a joint meeting and put
this as a as an agenda item so
that's my suggestion
Representative is that we give
you a chance to work on it I'll
give you hearing again right
away and then we can pass it on
to Judiciary if we think it's
it's at least worthy of a
hearing there yeah.
Madam chair I'm I'm very
grateful by that kind offer
yeah I think table in your right
now would likely and the
conversations that we could be
having some fruitful
conversations right now.
And the yeah I think.
I would much rather get out of
this committee with a unanimous
vote then the next vote.
I'm going to do sherry so I I
think the course you've laid out
is is the best one.
Okay well thank you thank you
for taking it on yeah
Representative Anderson you
madam chair just to clarify on
the point I to agree with your
point that we should defer any
action to date with the hope and
expectation that the the sponsor
will return with the a new
committee substitute all call
thank you madam chair yeah that
and as soon as you're ready
Representative Harper if you get
there.
just
let me know and we'll put it
will put it on.
Thank you and and one last
technical question madam chair
we we did adopt the committee
substitute so I'm hoping that
we'll be posted online so folks
what we see this new version of
the bill as we start looking at
changes is that correct let me
see what we can do about about
that I think we can get the
substitute posted we have on
other bills without having taken
action today so I don't think we
can take a formal action and a
committee report that adopted
this substitute and then and
then not have an Action on it
but I but let's follow up with
you and I can follow up with
maybe with right now and ask and
and Gabriel can help us with
that asked to get the substitute
posted.
So that people can see and we
start everyone starts at least
from that and not the and not
the original.
Perfect thank you Mr okay thank
you Representative thank you
committee members of the
audience I really appreciated
the the great questions and
debate thank you thank you and
thank you doctor bone for for
being here and for working with
Representative Harper on on this
bill.
Thank you.
Okay next.
We will go to Senate bill twenty
seven let's see if Senator madam
chair yes can I get a
clarification on the boat.
We're almost I mean a unanimous
no vote we're just holding were
not tabling and the adoption of
the substitute is not relevant
since we didn't take action
ultimately on that but we will
trying get the substitute posted
online but no vote no tabling a
it's just on hold.
Madam chair would be a would it
be rolled.
Possibly.
I.
Yes I'm I mean that's there's no
report on that it's just remains
on our agenda and in in the
remains in the committee and
we'll schedule a hearing and any
time that Representative Harper
is ready to come back thank you
madam chair to the most most
famous and best run committee
chairwoman thank you and and
thank you for my fan club from
the the other half of the
Armstrong caucus.
Thank you
let's see is
Is Senator Rodriguez yes there
she has.
Senator Rodriguez.
There you are.
Good morning do you have experts
that you want on Senate bill
twenty seven for us to bring in
yes madam chairman thank you
very much and thank you to the
committee I got V. are bringing
this from the other thank you
the director of the mortgage
finance authority large we're
here.
Okay it is inherent Hernandez
you sad and and Rebecca Velarde
okay.
Just make sure we get them.
Refined Rebecca.
Yes there she is okay all right
we're good to go we're good to
go Senator welcome and
to the house your our very first
Senate bill to be heard.
Thank you the all of you I
appreciate all your work your
amazing image should get done.
Let me just tell us a little bit
about this bill and it doesn't
Torrez bill by the mortgage
finance already and I'm it
merely tried doing everything we
can together you and I and
everyone else you're trying to
see how we can ameliorate the
problem with the with people
becoming homeless they're not
being able to pay their rent
mortgage payments and so on this
is that you do call the pandemic
nobody goes beyond that the
system bill handy goes beyond
that
if there's anything we have
learned is that the pandemic to
the exacerbated the problems and
and in a way it's good that we
can now see how big our needs
are we thought we had need now
they're really huge if we you
can change the exact so what
bills that I'm madam chairman
that.
We have a housing trust fund for
the state of New Mexico that I
sponsor every year and and
endorsed by the committee and
what it does is that generates
twenty five to one returns in
bonds for affordable housing
throughout New Mexico but
there's limitations are just
where the funding can go and how
much of that within that housing
trust fund in style this bill
here allows the NMFA to be able
to here are some of the funding
for rental assistance mortgages
this budget for based on need
specifically not only on
competition but on the now this
is a lot that we right.
Our problems and it also allows
for preservation of housing not
only producing healthy house
last preservation meeting that
weatherization we have
allocation are
we can fix on it there is a very
poor first new album will be
stable who would have a leaking
roof you can at least on our
help with you know fifteen that
route and things like that so
that's what it does in a
nutshell Madam chairman members
of the committee and it does not
have any fiscal impact in the
bill because the funding is
already within the housing trust
fund thank you madam chair.
Thank you would you like your
experts to say anything before
we go to the audience madam
chairman thank you for that
opportunity yes the work very
hard on this too so I will have
is the and Rebecca thank you go
ahead the.
I'm at is you need to
undershoot.
Thank you.
That we still can't hear you you
are muted but we can't hear you.
Can you hear me madam chair
perfect thank you I apologize
good morning madam chair not
members of the committee and
thank you senator Rodriguez.
I will be brief in my comments
as the as senator Audrey guess I
did a good job of covering all
the the main points of the bill
I I do want to start by thanking
the legislature for creating
that The New Mexico housing
trust fund back in two thousand
five it has been a great
investment for the state.
The state has invested a little
over twenty two million dollars
in the housing trust fund and
has benefited over thirty eight
hundred households across the
state and leveraged over five
hundred million dollars the
senator mentioned that there was
a twenty five to one return so
it's it's a great return on the
money that the state has
invested in addition to that as
we all know up housing or
construction or for rural
housing in this case is also
economic development and helps
with that and it's brought in an
additional close to half a
billion dollars in estimated
additional economic impact in
about six sixty eight hundred
jobs.
The recommended changes what
providers the flexibility to
provide funding to other
activities that address a wide
set of housing needs to the
state the flexibility will allow
us to invest these funds across
the continuum of affordable
housing to include homeless
programs weatherization
homeowner we have been are some
of the examples in addition to
what Senator Rodriguez mentioned
and with that that madam chair
Allah that Rebecca make a few
comments as well.
You madam chair members of the
committee thank you go ahead
Rebecca.
Chair members of the committee
good morning I don't have much
to add I believe Senator
Rodriguez along with Mister
Hernandez.
In the a lot of that gave you a
lot of information about I would
just tell you that practically
winds the pandemic hit you know
we really understood the need
that people are suffering and
needed things such as like
rental assistance and and they
worked really really hard to try
to find that rental assistance
but we and we would look at the
New Mexico having trust fund but
the way the statute was written
it really was construction ball
so these changes would really
allow the flag funding forced to
be more flexible so that we can
use it for a wider variety of
affordable housing and I really
think that this will benefit New
Mexicans especially during the
pandemic.
Well I have a question.
Thank you Senator are you ready
for us to go to the audience yes
madam chairman I'm ready okay
we start first with a a poll in
in this committee the equivalent
of raising your hands if we were
together

put up the pull of those who
might be in the audience in
support or opposition of.
Of the Senate bill twenty seven.
There we go so if you're here in
support or opposition to Senate
bill twenty seven if you could.
show your.
Your stance on the pole.
And we'll give it a few seconds.
Okay looks like we've got it we
you have eleven people in the
audience in support and non in
opposition.
so and next we will go to the
audience and if you wish to
speak if you would raise your
hand.
And we will call on everyone who
wishes to speak
and and we have a four o'clock
of a minute we don't have very
many people to speak so if you
go over a little bit we're we've
tribal won't cut you off but

Good Morning madam chair members
of the committee I am here to
representative The New Mexico
coalition to end homelessness
and we stand in support of
Senate bill twenty seven the
statutory changes will have
significant positive impact on
the community by allowing for
the flexibility to respond to
the eviction and homelessness
crisis the MFA will be able to
distribute these funds to
provide the assistance needed
and fill crucial gaps left by
other rental assistance in
addiction prevention funding
streams this will improve
outcomes for community housing

crisis and there's an urgent

proposed amendments to the New
Mexico housing trust fund act
would allow and that they use
these essential funds to address
the current housing crisis our
state has an affect as many as
forty two percent of New
Mexicans are now under threat of

allow MFA to direct urgently
needed funding towards rental

think the need for the proposed

agree with all of that in that
flexibility is the key in this
that this legislation will offer
that and it's so needed

Next we have a Susan Wilger.
Hello good morning madam chair
and members of the committee my
name is Susan Wilger and
executive director of the center
for health innovation we're
headquartered in Silver City New
Mexico and service New Mexico's
public health institute when
COVID had last summer we got
together with many public health
advocates and housing was one of
our our top concerns
we are in full support of Senate
bill twenty seven I think
Senator Rodriguez for sponsoring
the bill we do request that as
if the bill goes through that
you take into consideration
equitable distribution of the
resources based on need not just
solely on the population we have
seen the equity impacts of of
vaccine distribution and so we
help with and if this bill goes
through that housing resources
be distributed equitably
throughout the state thank you
so much for your time.
Thank you and Kelly Sunyani.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee again my name is
Kelly Sinn J. director of asset
management with the greater
Albuquerque housing partnership
and we stand in strong support
of SB twenty seven we we believe
MFA to be good stewards of the
New Mexico housing trust fund
act in allowing for greater
flexibility in its use
especially in this time of
greater need to the national
health pandemic is a responsible
and proactive move expanding the
utilization of the funds
provides more solutions to
maintain housing stability
particularly in assisting
households that have been
hardest hit by loss of income
under the public health orders
to focus what income they do
have one other essentials like
food medicines and utilities
residents across the state are
playing catch up with rent and
every measure that can be
executed to system is an
investment in the portents of
housing is a human right now ask
you to vote in favor of SB
twenty seven.
Thank you that's all that I have
on
So we will go to the committee
and first I have Representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair and good
to see you Senator Rodriguez I
miss seeing your face during the
interim in real life thank you
so much for bringing this
legislation forward I do have a
few questions one of beginning
with what is the balance in the
housing trust fund thank you
very much Representative
Armstrong the balance is
approximately six million
dollars now the good thing is is
that it is leverage twenty five
to one so that fund continues to
grow and grow and and that's a
fairly quickly considering the
needs that we have.
So
I'm I.
I think you need to New Mexico
anyway thank you madam chair
representative and senator and
so and what how is that Fund how
does that Romero madam chair
where does the money come from
that goes into that fund Senator
this thank you very much
accounting federal funds from
local governments yes
advertisement anyone else who
wants to contribute to the fund
but the majority of it really is
from federal funds.
I mean just add a little bit and
see if I may have a little bit
madam chair and Representative
Armstrong is that this the
mortgage finance authority is a
quite I governmental agency I
and as such they are able to
generate a leverage lots of
other funds that a lot of
organizations can't and they've
been managing these funds for
many many years so this way we
can actually give the MFA the
authority to promulgate rules to
it to deliver the funds.
Yes ma'am thank you madam chair
thank you senator I I noticed
that in this legislation you're
also creating a committee.
The help housing.
Trust fund committee I can't
remember the exact name but
madam chair and and senator do
are we going to are they going
to be able to.
Get reimbursed for travel or
anything like that I don't see
that in the bill thank you madam
chairman.
Representative Armstrong.
Is that be able to help with
promulgate rules and also to
make the decisions that based on
need they're going to be looking
at the at at the have the income
levels and other needs that
exist within the the applicants
and sell I will prefer to HSD
for additional comments on that.
Is the are you there yes madam
chair Senator Rodriguez and
Representative Armstrong a thank
you for the question the
committee is actually
established already was
established with the original
legislation back in two thousand
five the committee is a meets
when we have awards to make.
Just to give you a little bit of
a it is probably the legislation
there but there's some
appointments by the governor
some appointments by that Senate
president pro tem and also by
the speaker of the house so we
have a standing committee and
they do meet on a regular basis
as we are proposing awards they
review those up and then that
they eventually go to our board
for final approval I hope that
answers your your question I'm
Representative Armstrong thank
you madam chair and senator and
thank you is a yes that does
answer my question one of the
things that I see is added in
there new languages on section
four line thirteen is where it
starts in a trust fund shall be
awarded either on a competitive
basis or based on needs as
determined by the authority so
I'm assuming that the committee
is going to make recommendations
to
the S. forty to DFA and our
mortgage finance authority and
and then you would work in
conjunction to make those awards
so is this just on is this.
Housing that's already existing
and making sure that it's up to
cold or is this housing that's
going to be built.
Or both.
Chairman I'd I'll take a stab at
that thank you Representative
Armstrong
you know at this point it is
actually intended to help with
for example mortgages Houston's
for those that have been falling
behind that are in the verge of
losing their homes and also
parental assistance for example
if somebody is going to be
affected has been behind for you
once on their rent the rent will
actually be going directly to
the landlord and so the landlord
would be clearly justifying the
the need to have a reimbursement
for those tenants that have been
behind for example
and what was your other question
repeat that second question
madam chairman Representative
thank you madam chair and
senator and would this money be
available to build a facility.
Thank you madam chairman what
would it will be there's no
changes are as what the fund is
doing now with the current
abilities of the fund the
current rules the only thing
we're doing is adding the
potential to be able to if I am
able in legislation to be able
to expand the the assistance to
mortgage assistance rental
assistance more rehabilitation
and so on but the other which is
the building in affordable
housing the purpose of the funds
still remains.
Thank you madam chair and that's
all my questions I yield thank
you.
Thank you next I have
Representative Matthews.
Thank thank you madam chair
Senator Rodriguez it's a
pleasure to have you in our
committee.
in a a prior life I was the
attorney general's
representative on the NMFA board
and to know just enough about
housing probably be true the
dangerous
and I'm just a few questions
about the program is just ground
extra.
Incredibly since the I was on
the board many many years ago
but
I'm if I got a couple questions
about how we be sure that rural
New Mexico is involved in this
pro in this program and it is
expansion and
If you could err or one of the
experts should explain to me
what the process is to be sure
that MFA is and this and that
and this program will serve the
entire state thank.
Thank you madam map thank you
for your service on the thank
appreciate non
let me I'm going to that party
is the but I can tell you that
the mortgage finance authority
yes the gold standard for
distribution of funds out the
state and they their focus is
primarily on helping thousand
underserved communities and that
we were all just me now our
rural communities are usually
quite in your store but the the
map that you wish they were
provide which they refused to
distribute the funds develop
community in addition.
Throughout the state I will be
in the rules that they will be
promulgating the past that we
give them the ability to
establish these rules Schneid
usually people with and for
example representatives people
within
salary or income of thirty nine
thousand to fifty thousand
dollars per year for a family or
I would be at a good as an area
to show that these are the ones
that would qualify and you know
just families as well and
Schardin helpful so for more
information more detailed as to
where and how they are going to
distribute funds are what the
intent is one these rules are in
place are very because I know
they're working on that.
Yes.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative Matthews and I
thank you for your service and
on our board.
That that Senator Rodriguez said
that I think I covered the the
main points are and what we
generally do are currently under
the current regulations or the
rules that we have for the New
Mexico housing trust fund we
award funds on a competitive
basis so what we do is we have a
notice of funding availability
that we make available to all of
the housing partners across the
state under these new rules if
they get approved under the
revised Act it would open up
some more flexibility in in some
cases we cannot have the
advisory committee the housing
trust fund committee approved a
program that would be based on
not need and we would receive
applications from across the
state I just kind of give you a
something that we're very proud
of in the center mentioned is
that the.
The program since two thousand
five we've made it available or
assisted over thirty eight.
Hundred households with the over
fifty seven developments.
Those developments have gone up
in twelve rural counties and for
urban county so we are heavily
weighted to the to the the
developments in their the rural
areas we've touched a total of
US sixteen counties and so there
are some counties that have not
been assisted under this program
mainly because of the
constraints with the program and
that it was for new developments
and you housing with these
changes that would allow us to
do a little bit more than that
SO we plan on continuing to
strive to reach more of those
counties and we think these
flexible changes should they be
approved will give us more tools
to be able to do that so I hope
up Representative Matthews at
that addresses your question if
not I can not expendable bit
more.
thank you at.
Your hand then this you're
you're the director now.
Yes Representative Matthews I I
am the director for I've been
for a little bit over a year now
okay and madam chair Mister
director get your title correct
congratulations on your role so
important job just a couple more
questions
is
are there still housing
authorities throughout the state
that you all work with at all.
And madam chairman and
Representative Matthews yes let
me differs for were indefinite
jail to is the.
You thank you madam chair and
Representative Matthews that MFA
is currently the has oversight
of the regional housing
authorities there are three of
them one is a northern regional
Housing Authority out of callous
another one is the eastern
regional Housing Authority out
of Roswell in in the western
regional Housing Authority out
of Silver City so we have
oversight of those along with
Hyde I will mention to you that
there is currently a bill going
through that legislation it was
actually I believe heard at the
on the house floor a last night
that would remove MFA from the
oversight as there is
duplication between us and
height and height is the main
funder of the regional housing
authorities so should that get
passed we would not have any
direct oversight but I will tell
you that.
Those three regional housing
authorities and actually some
local housing authorities across
the state they participate in
our programs and I actually have
been recipients of some of these
are New Mexico housing trust
fund for some of the
developments and community is
that they are are able to build
across the state.
Madam chair Senator Rodriguez
thank you for that answered for
that information
It does is MFA act it all in
working on housing issues on the
reservations and pueblos.
Thank you for asking that
question is they can get into
detail on that we are we do work
with tribes that let me have is
the response thank you.
Madam chair and Representative
Matthews that that is correct
that we actually are very proud
we have a under the housing
trust fund program which is a
before you today we have made
some awards on tribal land I
don't have that the details in
front of me right now but I
would say that that they have
been very successful at
obtaining funds to do
development says some of the
most recent data examples I
would be an app Pueblo back up
my they have a beautiful
development there with that I
believe thirty thirty homes are
apartment apartment complex with
thirty units you'll see some and
Santo Domingo and some fairly
bare so in addition to the New
Mexico housing trust fund we
actually also do a.
I would say the majority of our
home rehab funds go to tribal
land they generally re have by
anywhere from thirty to forty
homes on an annual basis and
also our weather is ation or
energy efficiency program
we do a lot of units on tribal
land as well and those are just
three examples of our some of
the development on tribal lands.
I'm.
Madam chair representative here
at Rodriguez thank you for that
information also and and my last
question there's been any more
Torrance on the evictions in the
state
and it does this program let me
back up then ask a little bit a
little bit more at background
into the question I've had a
number of constituents contact
me they all there are a lot of
times retired people they have a
they have a small home in the
back of their property or and
they renting it out
the.
They're not huge property owners
by any means band part of their
retirement income comes from the
rentals they get and so you've
mentioned moratoriums while
certainly understandable
and necessary and have also
coalition difficulty for people
like that
and I'm just wondering does this
program
you do anything regarding.
The eviction moratoriums and the
possibility of providing the
back do rentals once the
moratorium's are lifted.
Madam chairman Representative
Matthews the the program will
assist as long as the funds of
course are available always
there's the limitation but the
intent here is that at least
immediately with the funds that
are now in place and and of
course through the rules they
will determine how much how much
of that fund will be distributed
per rental and mortgage
assistance for example it is
intended that they would
probably based on just my own
calculation here in my head
approximately three months of
assistance for rental assistance
directly to landlords for those
families for example you could
be you for example had a home he
rented your your little placed
behind your home or something to
make a living and you haven't
received your rent and so as a
result of that you're gonna lose
your home because that's how you
make your payment right and so
this particular legislation
would allow for us to be able to
pay the landlord for at least
three months and I'm I said
three months because this on the
calculation my hand right now
based on the funds but the
intent is to continue to with
this as long as funds are
available and that's why the MFA
is the place to do this because
they leverage twenty five to one
there's no other place in New
Mexico that does that but it
also will help people directly
by paying for their rent and and
mortgage assistance it it will
go directly to them now let me
just found a little bit on that
and I will move on to is the if
he has anything to at Rebecca
but the problem with the
pandemic infections the north
Koreans and so on has given rise
to several lawsuits much many
more now than we've had in the
past from people in from
landlords and businesses and so
on trying to to make a living
and so that we are trying to
augment for example this.
The legal services fund and I
don't want to go off to a
different tangent here but to be
able to provide funding there
also to help people who do not
have the funds to be able to get
representation when they go to
court for this on the other hand
because the Supreme Court had
ordered and moratorium you know
they're trying to resolve a lot
of if I hearings what I think
what I understand so we're
trying to navigate the the
problems that having people go
to a full court hearing over
over mental deficiencies in so
anyway I'm going to defer to is
the just make sure that he gives
you the detail that you need on
that Madam chairman
Representative Matthews.
Madam chair not Representative
Matthews I I think the the
senator did a great job of
covering that that the short
answer is that with that the
changes to the act would give us
the flexibility to assist.
With rental assistance currently
I the way the actors right and
we can assist with rental
assistance but only to the
extent that those properties.
Are up for low income folks that
have been assisted with MFA
monies in the past this would
allow us to serve outside that
portfolio I will mention that
the as you may recall at the
special session that was held in
November MFA was awarded or DFA
who contracted with the MFA for
fifteen million dollars for
rental and mortgage assistance
we were able to use up all of
those funds to assess that about
thirty eight hundred families
for mortgage and rental
assistance we also currently
have some CDBG funds although
they are very restrictive in
nature
and that require a lot of
documentation so we're doing
some of that to already with the
CDBG funds but with these
changes in this act here it
would give us a little bit more
flexibility with the funds that
are got maybe don't have as many
requirements as a federal funds
to we're not we could go a
little bit deeper and assisting
some of those are families that
have not been reached with those
other programs.
Madam chair Senator Rodriguez
director Hernandez and ms Lowry
thank you so much for bringing
me up to date on the incredible
work you guys are doing I'm I'm
so impressed by how the MFA has
really.
I stepped up and and filled a
lot of holes in our housing
programs and look forward to
supporting this bill thank you
very much.
Thank.
Thank you next we have
Representative Montoya.
The chair and the Senator
Rodriguez thank you so much for
bringing this bill as a freshman
this is particularly of keen
interest to me been working
closely with freshman senator hi
to me as well because in the
city of Espanola and in Rio
Arriba county we have serious
need as all regions of New
Mexico do I'm heartened to see
that sixteen counties are being
served in rural counties
just a little bit of a
description previous to be
elected.
I was able to work with a
nonprofit to put forth the first
ever homeless shelter in the
city of Espanola is called the
Espanola pathway shelter it just
opened officially a couple weeks
ago but we've been in taking
individuals over the last year
and in six months we've seen six
of four hundred unique cases
that's for a population of ten
thousand that's many many
percentage points higher
alarmingly then the city of Los
Angeles there's a critical
critical need is causing
distress in real tension between
the municipality the not in my
backyard the people who are
advocating for homeless the
pen it's just these crazy crazy
The problem.
I would like to learn humbly in
this is so inspiring trust me
I'm just like taking copious
notes.
And how we can bring real
solutions my question is around
the idea of what I think would
be really unique and innovative
ways to create.
Housing developments that that
serve not only you know
immediate transitional and
supportive housing lowincome mid
income and professionals
teachers and doctors and lawyers
who we want to attract to live
within the city limits
particularly with the
neighboring community of Los
Alamos where many of our folks
travel to Espanola has a very
unique challenge in that we have
very limited land.
It's sort of a Swiss cheese up
tribal jurisdiction in Santa Fe
County in.
City of Espanola and very
limited slots over the last five
years I have worked closely with
the okay Wingate housing trust
took to think innovatively how
could we take a ten acre plot
that they have to be able to
create housing that would not
only serve the tribal need but
the greater need and fostering
this inter dependence and trust
in harmony if you will.
My question is can you point to
a recent project.
That is either just completed or
in progress the kind of fits
this and described to me where
it is and how it's working and
how it serving how many families
what's the composition of the
housing.
Your thank you very much
Representative Montoya and thank
you for your interest and and
your always your commitment to
affordable housing first let me
mention that one of the biggest
problems we face in New Mexico
wait prior to this comment
shortage shortage of housing for
people I'm not only affordable
housing just how the in general
we don't have enough and so
this bill within that be
affordable housing trust fund
has been there to assist
throughout the state in
providing more housing in
general for example the
apartment complexes that provide
more and additional homes for
people to live in and of course
setting aside a certain amount
for example for people who can't
afford to pay the the routine or
the the amount that is generally
charged by landlords and so
that's that certainly a one area
and MFA just had a recent
actually quite often but maybe
yes he can describe a very
recent a project that you did it
through the MFA because of the
COVID we didn't get a chance
this summer to go into our the
additional projects that they've
been working on we usually go
and in our groups are committee
to go see them but is he can you
tell Representative Montoya at
mentioned in this great much
detail as you can with the time
we have what project you are
working on currently.
Thank you Senator Rodriguez said
madam chair and Representative
Montoya thank you for the
question I can tell you that we
have a very supportive I
legislative oversight committee
and we do try to take them out
to some of these are
developments that we have across
the the the state when we meet
and I believe that the Rebecca
and I and the rest of the folks
here MFA have a fully that the
greatest and most rewarding job
but there is in the state and
that that our our mission just
drives.
Just two to help so many
families and that's that when
you see the faces of those
families that that are being
assisted whether it's with rehab
or whether it's ation or New
apartment complex that they're
moving into is just so are just
so gratifying I'll give you a
couple of examples and then not
Rebecca may have a couple as
well maybe we're thinking of the
same ones.
We do serve the full continuum
of housing from homelessness all
the way to homeownership so one
of the things that you touched
on our programs that we have and
I'll tell you that we are are we
have a housing needs assessment
that Rebecca and her staff do on
an annual basis they updated and
there's just tremendous need
across the state our next step
is to develop a state house.
A statewide housing strategy to
put that not only what the needs
are but the resources and we can
identify the gaps and then come
up with solutions to try to meet
some of those gaps because there
are many gaps across the state
and not enough funding to meet
him all but some are very a
quick examples you mentioned.
I don't mean to interrupt but I
would like to hurry us along
because we still have a pretty
good agenda so this is great
information good discussion but
if we can
try and move this along thank
you thank you madam chair so
real quickly it Representative
Montoya that there's that
shelter that you mentioned there
in Espanola I'm not gonna
remember the name but there's
also a low income housing tax
credit that is a being renovated
their Espanola there's a project
out here in Albuquerque that
just had the ribbon cutting
where what Tresco ninety units
for families ranging all the way
down to thirty percent of the
area median income very low
income and it has a live work
environment at the bottom and
then the last one that I
mentioned it's under
construction right now it's a
permanent supportive housing
project here in Albuquerque that
does St Martin's or hope.
Hope
I'm forgetting the name of that
the development now but the is
there developing us permanent
supportive housing unit for
forty two individuals that are
homeless and the supportive
services all under one roof it
would love to give you a tour at
some point of those and give you
more detail on those projects
and I Rebecca I don't know if
you have another one that you
may want to mention real quick.
Madam chair representative the
only other one I would mention
would be the imperial building
in downtown Albuquerque it
includes twenty market rate
units out of seventy something
also include commercial on the
ground floor the model that
you're talking about of making
income is actually considered
the gold standard affordable
housing development so I think
that's a great way to go.
In the interest of time I can
absolutely get that information.
In other ways let's just keep
moving yeah sorry.
Thank you.
Any more questions
Representative.
Okay thank you Representative
Thomson.
Thank you madam chair and I'll
try to be brief so I just want
an explanation of how the twenty
five to one occur occurs where
the money is coming from like if
there's strings attached out how
that all works madam chair thank
you madam chairman and good to
see you representative Thompson
thanks for your question yes the
funding comes from federal funds
from local organizations
municipalities county
governments which and local
governments and the fund can now
take any any donations from
anyone who wants to donate and
so that's how the funds are
generated and then they get
leveraged into different
programs are different propped.
Thank you madam chair and just
one more question I'm having
grown up on Navajo I know that.
At least where I was the
majority of housing was
government owned it only and you
talk about doing some things on
on date of American research.
Are you doing those on private
residence or are they on and.
You know every every every
little town has its teacher age
where the teachers live and
those kind of things so I I and
and from my experience there
weren't a lot of privately owned
homes and so if you could just
talk a little bit about about
the restrictions in terms of of
on and on native plants thank
you madam chair and thank you
Representative at New York of
all people are very very
knowledgeable about the check
board we call it checkerboard
that CYFD regnant private
recipes you Madam native
residences and so on page yes
this does dials to everyone and
anyone that qualifies I'm in the
reservations including Navajo
but let me defer to our it is
the to be more explicit is the
can you answer a question with
more detail please thank you
madam chair representative
Thompson I'm not tribal land
that what we've been doing I'll
give you a couple of examples
when I mentioned a little
earlier was in that Pueblo back
on my that was a at thirty unit
that community or development
there it was tribal land and
there was at thirty unit
development that was done there
the other examples that I
mention on weatherization and
home owner we have have been for
a individually owned homes that
they have on the on tribal land
great experience or great
example would be in some
Phillipa they're probably one of
our highest producers there when
it comes to a
the homeowner rehab program.
Thank you that's all I have
madam chair.
Thank you thank you
Representative Terrazas.
Thank you madam chair
representative thank you for
excuse me Senator thank you so
much we're switching gears here
to.
Real quick up thank you for
bringing the legislation that
does not mean it is something
that all of us are interested in
of course keeping people off the
streets of having a warm were
safe place to go to is very all
important as I've been listening
and and I hear that you had
about six million dollars in
there and and I and I was
reading some of the stuff about
make sure that when the loads
here can be one second my
understanding is
I know that you guys are
helping.
Different homes with rental and
so forth and and I think it was
brought up that there is a
problem by one of the
representatives lose Matthews at
stated we're
it's affecting people that have
a small rental and so forth and
I appreciate you explaining that
because that it does actually
have unintended consequences to
other people who will depend on
that and.
If they have any mortgages but.
I guess my question was
Six million dollars you guys
keep.
Of a reserve in there are
minimum reserve for me because
that's I mean I guess from going
with this is six million dollars
is a small amount of money
to handle such a huge problem
and so I'm just wondering how
many how social actually be able
to help and are you even though
you leverage yourself
I see that you guys have a
wonderful way leverage yourself
just wondering how many people
you still give me ten questions
I'm gonna start with.
How many calls do you think.
Fall outside of this flexibility
that you need to help them with
rental and give me an example.
Thank you madam chairman and
Representative process the
mortgage finance authority is
governed by a board and it is a
mortgage finance authority board
call we are the oversight
legislative oversight committee
of the MFA in so the board to
the staff recommendations and
that research make the decisions
as to where the funds go to for
affordable housing based on
applications and eligibility
criteria
the simple that or let me just
go back a little bit and I know
we're running out of time so I'm
gonna be quick but the example I
can give you that clearly states
the need if it's all in one
quick picture is that in
November we all to a special
legislative session passed a.
a bill that allow for fifteen
million dollars to go to the MFA
reportable housing for you know
rental assistance for systems to
keep people warm in their homes
and and so on and in one month
the mortgage finance authority
was able to distribute those
funds that's how fast it could
go because they have the systems
in place they have the rules the
systems the framework I would
thank you distribute the funds
now is the you can be quick
because I know the chair
indicated the time frame here to
answer any further detail for Mr
for Representative last.
Madam chair representative that
I says that that is actually a
very difficult question and that
I I don't know that I can give
you a number of how many folks
will be able to assist with this
as right this would not be the
only activity there are several
activities to include homeowner
Development apartment complex
development and that a whole
slew of a housing that we do we
would allocate a portion of
these funds to assist but there
there is that a great need out
there and not here depending on
the I come out to the other
sources we can use this would be
used as a gap.
The field or if you will for
those that don't qualify for
those other programs.
I thought.
It would be difficult to give
you a number
that on how many people we are
household would be able to
assist with this these funds I'm
sorry I.
Madam chair representative I
guess that's a better question
would have been
just that little flexibility
maybe at so I don't make it so
complicated what was the
product's ability guys needed
that was not allowing you to
help certain people with certain
needs I don't.
The complication.
I'm sorry madam chairman that
the voice didn't come in as a
muted.
could you not hear me now I'm
sorry your lips moving but I
couldn't the words don't come
out he on this yeah I I hear you
so I'm not sure what the issue
is but try your question again
okay madam chair representative
let me I just I just wanted to
see that what was that this
sliver of or that flexibility
that you needed just to help
those other individuals that are
in the I think that's what I
just wanted clarification on
that just so I understand.
In a brief summary and gentleman
working at office it is the
flexibility to work best for
rental assistance mortgage
assistance more rehabilitation
or homes and weatherization
programs and so on based on need
which is specific to this bill
people need that's probably not
which are families and
households from our example
would be eighty two hundred and
twenty percent of leading rig
count is low income in.
Well Madam chair representative
you guys are wonderful program
and I'm glad that you guys are
able to get those funds
immediately to people that I
know that the user like you
stated earlier it's a a way that
they're able to process those K.
right away I guess I have had to
hopefully you can help with this
with this madam chair Senator
with
I have had some people say that
the comply for weatherization
and unfortunately they're
they're not able to get the
funding is there a reason that
that's happening is is.
Thank you are you.
You know I was looking at this
thing and it was doing exactly
what you're saying so I don't
lose was used for the that was
going through so I just heard
some of that so it is it because
of the
maybe you can explain to me why
so that when I get called on
that we can may be explain a
little better Senator your thank
you madam madam chairman of the
reason that sometimes people
can't get the help they need
when they apply it because of
the limited funds and also the
limitations that exist currently
that is bill which.
This bill would allow for those
flexibilities to take
applications and this is people
white both hi the staff
malpractice I need a dollar more
than I was supposed to make and
I I didn't qualify so this year
gives the flexibility to
promulgate rules rules to help.
On that point if I can also add
Representative that there are
multiple programs that assist
with weatherization they all
have limited funds and can only
do so much giving the
flexibility to MFA just provides
an one more funding so potential
funding source for
weatherization.
Right my last question is is I
saw you.
Maybe at I understood that
you're looking to try and help
with down payments of two new
housing is that.
Does that we understood that
thank you madam chair of.
The.
Google review I think that the
are you a fan.
I think it is fragmenting a
little bit I I I see it madam
chair Senator so yes ma'am I was
I stopped because I thought it
was doing it again no problem
thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative us businesses
already providing I long to find
forty.
Program it currently at this
bill doesn't change that yeah we
want you the programs that are
assisting currently in place and
just add more flexibility to
help now during the pandemic.
Madam chair and senator thank
you so much for your hard work I
will be supporting a bill of
course and and I just wanted to
clarify those few things and and
thank you so much
thank you for your hard work
published thank you thank you

the provisions within the law to
make sure that we can actually
get the results that we're
looking for and I and you have
closed that nest in the research
process that across the south
what we intend to do in this
bill Madam chairman members of

example we added to native
Americans in two African
Americans to the committee

are much further and higher
impacted than others by this and
we want to make sure that we
have good representation to
address these areas that are
most down impacted and so on it
also
Hours for the department to be

executive director of changing
woman initiative a native
American women's health
collective our work is rooted in
the understanding that
indigenous women and their
families are not well cared for
by the existing systems during
pregnancy birth and postpartum
it is always essential that
people with direct of lived
experience of perinatal care in
New Mexico be part of the
solution.
The women and the families that
we serve it changing woman
initiative have critical insight
about how hospitals and
providers in New Mexico could
better serve them we must inform
the questions that are asked and
respectfully and fully gather
the data from which the
interpretations are made to do
that we must remove barriers to
participation provide
transportation compensation and
training that is what this bill
does also with the federal
Montebello's having been
reintroduced this year it is
clear that there is growing
recognition that our maternal
health inequities are
inexcusable and we must take
action this bill is in alignment
with federal efforts and
positions New Mexico to be a
leader we ask for your support
of this bill thank you madam

ninety six.
Women in the U. S. are the most
likely to die from complications
related to pregnancy or
childbirth in twenty eighteen
there were seventeen point four
maternal deaths for every one
thousand.
One hundred thousand live births
in the US I ratio more than
double that of most other high
income countries countries this
tragic and preventable health
crisis is growing and it is
worse in New Mexico.
The death rate in New Mexico is
twenty one point five percent.
We rank eight eight among the
states.
Three out of five maternal
deaths are preventable.
New Mexico women of color are
more likely to be at risk for
preterm birth maternal and
infant mortality thank you for

mortality rates to the highest
among peer countries is current
rates in the disproportionately
severe impact on African
American and native American but
I think that's unacceptable you

rooted in systemic racism and
chronic stress we must do better
to improve the lives of families
in our state.
Because of the good work done
already by a and M. and then
Marci in recent years we know
that seventy four percent of

Thank you madam chair members
the committee Linda Siegel
representing the American
college of OBGYN and we were
heavily involved in the original
legislation and and work to put
this language into statute and
so we're very happy to see that
we're tweaking that language
involving more our providers and
non providers so that we can
comprehensively look at these
issues of maternal mortality and
and make recommendations to
hospitals and providers about
how to improve care so that we
can eliminate it thank you so
much.
Thank you let's try sunshine

Representative Ferrary.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative Senator
Rodriguez I'm sorry
in in your great experts I think
this is of.
Going to be great to be
expanding our our your
To be the
council
and to have more of the a better
mix of clinicians and non
clinicians and
coming from D. W. I. prevention
background
in.
Seat belts and things like that
traffic safety I'm really glad
that the committee we'll be able
to from what they determined
that not the deaths you know and
how those can be averted by you
know cheap reasonable changes to
you know the patient the
community the provider the
solidity or assistance actors
and so I was wondering with the
expansion to be more inclusive
especially of dated American
representation and people
through from throughout the
state.
Will the things that you
discover
have you already or would you be
planning to make
recommendations to other groups
such is no home visiting
agencies to do as community
health workers and perinatal
care providers that could make a
difference and or legislates
some of those changes.
Thank you Representative Ferrary
it's good to see you in in
thanks for your genuine interest
in this matter
let me just say yes they will be
working hand in hand in the
coordinated support effort for
home visiting agent do eight
community health workers and
parenting our natal care
providers to see how they make.
Together they have formed a team
are to be able to get as much
information as possible from
this research I guess it just
breaks my heart truly to know
that seventy six percent of
maternal deaths occurred
postpartum and that seven that
seventy four percent of all the
deaths were preventable and so
in doing all this collaboration
that you just that brought up
we will be able to to get even
better and more information so
we can do something about it
that's where it's at if you need
any more detail I'll be happy to
go to a doctor current item for
that Representative.
Do you need more detail on that.
Madam chair I'm sorry I didn't
recognize and and senator I was
just wondering if has the
committee already need our
provided recommendations or you
know from some of the
information they've already
gathered.
Thank you madam chair and
representative for our they have
not made those recommendations
grow at what you're yet they
want to get more in depth
information and also include
more more people might use that
and it's a matter clinicians and
non clinicians and our providers
and so on on committed to make
sure your recommendations
includesd there are very very
have already stations had direct
input.
Thank
chair and senator I my son is
best friends of white died.
Few months after birth and I'm
sure there part of your study
and I think this is you know
You know something that you know
we with all the prevention
aspects of this
should we should be looking into
what
these causes are in you know how
they might easily have prevented
my sense why are it I sense
friends why I'm sorry
in your she could still be here
today probably so I'm I'm I'm
glad to see this going forward

director of the retiree health
care of forty.
Okay I.
Just.
He's moved over and so
Representative the floor is
yours.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Canadian I'm Natalie Figueroa I
am bringing you is Senate bill
twenty one it is a bill that
came out of the interim pension
oversight committee and then
involves the retiree health care
authority and modders
modernizing some language and
updating.
Pieces of the statute it does
three things it was the limiting
aid for dependent children
participating in the program
from nineteen to twenty six so
that it is aligned with the
affordable Care Act federal law
this doesn't have any fiscal
impact on the retiree health
care is already since it has
been doing that since the ACA
was stopped in two thousand ten
but it updates the language.
For eligible number two for
eligible child dependents over
the age of twenty six the bill
replaces the term mentally
retarded with intellectual
disability this is again making
the language more appropriate
and modernized alliance with the
Social Security Administration
from two thousand thirteen.
And number three the bill the
eight all the references are
requirements associated with the
discount prescription drug
program as a retiree Health Care
Act that was something created
in two thousand two before we
had Medicare part D. supplements
and it hasn't been funded or
used to since two thousand
eleven so we're just taking it
out of the statute.
And other director as I said Mr
David Archuleta is here is there
technical questions that I can
answer for you but we will stand
for questions at this point
madam chair.
Thank you
Mr Archuleta did you want to say
anything before we go to the
audience or.
Just be available for questions
good morning madam chair members
of the committee again my name
is David let them the executive
director The New Mexico retiree
health care forty I believe that
the Representative explained the
bill well if there are any
questions this does you know
just summarize an insane or
reiterate the fact that it
doesn't change any of our
current practices it simply
clarifies some some language in
our statute that is currently in
conflict with the elements of
the affordable Care Act and
bring it in line with the
practices that we employed state
so with that it's time for any
questions thank you we'll go
first to the all our next to the
audience and first we do a poll

may be here in support or
opposition.

with us okay great so
Representative go ahead floor's
yours.
Thank you so much madam chair
and members of the committee I'm
here to present our Senate bill
one twenty four as amended this
is a really a really simple bill
but what it does is it shortens
our deadline for pharmacies to
get paid out for prescriptions
the normal the normal timeliness
thirty days and we're trying to
shorten that fourteen.
this will increase the cash flow
for New Mexico pharmacies by
reducing the wait for
prescription drug reimbursement
reimbursement from health plans
without increasing health care
costs so this is a really great
bill that will really benefit
everybody but especially it will
benefit the smaller pharmacies
in rural New Mexico which which
makes me really happy
Also I would like to add that
this bill absolutely flew
through Senate of both
committees and the Senate floor
completely unopposed so with
that madam chair I would like to
give minimal gonna go with the
really funding thank a chance to
introduce yourself and talk a
little bit and then also after
we actually are thank you for as
well thank you so much thank you
and I'm I'm gonna jump in and
and Representative and your
experts probably catch this but
I'll add one thank your
presentation fourteen days is
the standard under Medicare for
payment of pharmacy claims so
this is not anything different
done huge portion of
of pharmacy billing claims
processing yes yes madam chair
so this is just making in the
standard thank you thank you for
catching that adding more.
Thank you so
Minda.
Methodical do you want to add
anything
I just want to briefly thank the
committee madam chair members of
the committee we are so happy
that we have gotten here and
working with Representative but
this is going to true pleasure.
Briefly what I want to let you
know is that this bill pertains
only to the reimbursement of
prescriptions rocks on the
Senate side constitutio reached
out to us and we worked together
to come up with a solving one
issue because of the important
legislation last year creating
pharmacy clinicians are Clint of
are pharmacists clinicians are
now considered medical providers
and you can find services that
have been in the venue Sen
doctors physician's assistants
and others what we've done is we
have bifurcated reimbursement
when pharmacists clinicians are
providing medical services they
are paid as their fellow
providers this bill speaks to
when we have a patient bring
script to the window to be fair
we just thought that that was
important because we're very
excited that our promises have
expanded rules we want to be
clear on specifically what this
bill does and I'd like to are we
with the your permission have
actually C. R. who is the
chairman of the New Mexico
pharmacy business council and
the.
Care to run each you have to say
one thing very exciting thank
you the Farmington area in
participating in clinics and
also her pharmacy with actually
doing it herself are going to
people's homes to give them
vaccinations are independent are
trying to step in step up and
take very very good care of
their neighbors so with that I'd
like actually just a couple
words of that why this is so
important thank you thank you go
ahead Ashley and welcomed.
Hi welcome to our thank you for
having me today I appreciate the
great comments up across the
board yes we are working very
hard out here to get people
taking care of for sure I'm so
with that said I'll make it
really brief this bill is really
straightforward we're asking for
nothing but bring everybody up
to Medicare standards to help
increase our cash flow you would
not believe the amount of money
that we have out right now with
the extra costs associated with
providing patients these
vaccines I'm and so we're really
just looking to help our cash
flow the time we have into these
things is incredible as well as
be extra supplies additionally a
lot of times what we're seeing
is you know we fill a
prescription twice before we
even get paid for the first one
and so having the cash flow is
really hurting us.
This is a very straightforward
bill all we are asking is we
bring up the standards to what
Medicare has it set at fourteen
days just to help us keep our
cash flow our patients cared for
thank you very much madam chair
members of the committee I
appreciate your support on this.
Thank you then you have another.
Yes I just want to make it clear
that well this is going to be
incredibly this is our
independent community pharmacies
this will apply to all retail
pharmacies your pharmacy can you
get a prescription then you get
paid fourteen this helps across
the blue.
Thank you
Representative are you ready for
us to go to the audience.
Yes madam chair we're ready for
questions thank you thank you so
first will do pull.
Of I anyone here that's in
support or opposition of Senate
bill one twenty four.
Given another couple seconds.
Okay I think we're good looks
like you have four here in the
audience and support and none in
opposition.
So we will go to the audience of
anyone that wishes to.
I speak and first we have Marla
shots.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee Marla Schultz
registered lobbyist for Blue
Cross blue shield of New Mexico
we're here in support of house
bill one twenty four and would
like to thank the sponsoring
this not gonna go for dressing
our concerns and getting us to
this point thank you.
Thank you and next we have the
oil tanker.
Madam chair members of the
committee I'm Dale G. I
represent the number Mrs
Association and we do stand in
support of this important
legislation.
It is about cash flow and as you
all know what makes pharmacy
providers different than most
other providers is the inventory
and as potentially see parts
said the inventory burden is
pretty heavy so this was me that
up to fourteen days from thirty
the amendment in the city
distinguish between our I'm the
man in the Senate thing which
between.
Pharmacy prescription drug
claims and pharmacy clinical
services claims
sense we do have clinical
services parity.
Legislation that passed on last
year we recognized that filing a
medical claim is a little
different and file filing a
pharmacy prescription drug
claims and as you all know when
a when you process your
prescription that is build
medium the point of care the
immediate billing so the
insurance company in the PBMs
now exactly who.
And and what that prescription
drug is so with that I thank you
look forward to working on this
legislation the future.
Thank you.
Thank you now we'll go to the
committee and first I have
Representative Matthews.
Madam chair and members of the
committee I just want to senator
Tom is my state senator and I
want to thank him for sponsoring
this important bill thank you.
Thank you on next Representative
Anderson.
Thank you madam chairman I too
wanted to echo up support for
this legislation because it's
clearly one more step forward in
improving not all really
improving the delivery of health
care in New Mexico because
pharmacy that are for our
operational in the bailable on
to the New Mexicans who seek a
prescriptions is
can't be over done so I think
this is a very logical programs
this effort and I look forward
to voting for thank you madam
chair.
