Been rolled at the
request of the sponsor.
So we won't be hearing that

Jennifer.
>> Bye.

Representative
Vincent
madam, vice Chair
madam Chair,
present
madam Chair
>> here. It's obviously
getting late in the
Session.
>> So he's
here.
Are you sure that's the one that's rolled?
She's sitting in the
front.
Um
>> OK, we are going to start
with um
House Bill 233
Representative
Lujan.
And
mm
yes.
So go ahead whenever you're
ready.
>> Good morning madam Chair
and Committee. I believe
we have a another expert
witness justice Brianna
Zamora that needs to
come in by Zoom Madam
>> Chair. We, we have a substitute.
Is that correct? >> You have a substitute, but
also there uh My
guest, expert
witness will be on Zoom as
well
>> so we could pass out
the substitute
and I need a motion for
discussion
of a second
the motion was um
Chavez and the second
was
Herndon.
Yeah,
the
substitute
I
have.
Um so I think we're ready to
go if you want, however,
you want to proceed.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Um
Before you, we have a Committee
substitute for
House Bill
233.
And some
of the those changes that
we made were substantial
enough to create a substitute
bill and
some more technical and
some were more substantive.
And with
that madam Chair, I'd like to
um introduce
my guests
uh and uh expert
witness today, this is Doctor
Bronwen Neer
and online,
we have Justice Brianna
Zamora
and if
I can do a quick introduction and
then we can get into the the
substantial changes in
the substitute
uh madam Chair today. The, the
reason we are seeking uh
amendment to the criminal
competency statute comes
down to the immense
changes we have seen since
nine. We have, we
haven't seen since 1979.
Let me get adjust
myself here, madam Chair
and the need to participate in our
democracy
to keep, to keep statutes
and rules up to date.
But even more so we are seeking
amendment because we know
as a State, we can do better
for our communities.
And the way the statute is
currently written, we are
limited in what we can
offer to individuals in the legal
system who experience
mental and behavioral health
and substance use
disorders.
Although
today we are,
we are also missing the mark
on how to provide for
individuals in the legal
system who are
mentally ill but do
not meet qualifications
for civil commitment.
Our familiar faces are
being over, evaluate,
over evaluated
and underserved in our
communities.
The statute aims to create
additional legal mechanisms
to get defendants suffering
with mental and behavioral health
and substance use
disorders connected
to services appropriate to
their level of
acuity. In
addition, it seeks to
lessen the burden on
the judicial system that
has become the main provider
of initial mental health
services and to get
community provider providers
involved.
This bill will create more
opportunity for workforce
development as
as well as
creating more collaborative
and community supported
system
by adding diversion
to treatment programs.
Additional referral mechanisms
for assessment to civil commitment
and assisted outpatient
treatment, outpatient
competency
restoration,
which is lessening the burden
on the evaluation
system and
things that stayed the same
madam Chair are the
dismissal, dismissal of
misdemeanor and nonviolent
felony charges.
Um The option for traditional
competency process
and the continued mechanisms
for attorneys to disagree
with reports and
findings and to order
additional evaluations
to substantiate.
This isn't all
what
has the the
encompasses this bill
initially and in
the substantially
in the substitute.
And I would refer now to
my expert witness doctor Neer
if she wanted to add anything
to the changes
from the initial bill
to the substitute
madam
Chair.
>> Um II I
think that you covered most
of, of what we're,
what we're trying to do here
with re evaluating
the competency statute.
Um I would just add
that this
uh the amendments
and really the heart of what
this is attempting to do is to
create a more
collaborative system.
Um Mental
health is already a really
complex issue. I
think we all understand
that but to
have most of
our uh most of
our community Members with
severe and persistent mental illness
coming through our justice system
pretty continually.
Um This is true for all
13 of our judicial
districts. Um
I think it's really
imperative that
New Mexico takes
a look at this and
comes together and really
supports um
supports the entire State
but also really supports our
communities. Um
And that's, that's really what's at the
heart of this
bill
that >> just
as the moto manager, would
you like to say
anything
now? She can hear
us,
wait for her to time in
while we're waiting for her madam Chair? I just
like to add that this is a model
in preparing for this bill.
We worked through the entire
interim. Um
We got started right after
uh the last Session
and I was invited to
be a member
of the SA A
um academy
along with Justice Amoda
with Dr Niesr and
many other stakeholders
uh county uh through
our county through our State
government. And through this
collaboration, we have, we
have worked
tirelessly
to get to come to where we
are. But we know that nothing
is perfect as
madam Chair, you always say there's always more
work to do, but this is an,
this is an initiative
and uh and
the importance of this work is
not, is not,
not gone through our
health and human services interim
Committee. Um My
cosponsor is
um Senator
Ortiz Pino who
has championed
this issue for many,
many years. So
today, after much
evaluation and
collaboration, we
are here to present this bill
and if Justice
Zamora is ready, she can
add to our
comments, madam
Chair,
>> Justice Zamora. Do you
have, are you
there?
Mm. Well,
um it seems like there's something
going on. So we'll go ahead and go
to the public and then
we'll come back to her.
Um So
if you are, if you are
on zoom in
opposition,
please raise your hand and
we'll come back to you. If
is there anyone in the
room in opposition?
Ok. If you would come and
um if you want to make
public comment, go ahead and come to
the center
aisle
and there's a mke in the ceiling.
So you don't have
to
>> March
liner
somewhere else to be inside
Paia, the crux of
this
issue
to decide what
their bodies
I
access to,
oh,
substance
State to make those.
Yes, but
so that we can access
them
in our team.
Yes,
my fortune
and
certainly
>> is
the
part
of
a Session we
work
and uh the bill
suffers from
all sorts
of
what I think that the
first.
>> Sure.
Thank you,
Ellen.
You're
done.
Hold, hold. Can you hold
on one second? I I
get >> on the
and I'm having a hard
time. >> Ok.
Um
OK. What
this room is a, is a
tech nightmare. So
I, I'm sorry. Um If
you, if one of you could slide
your microphones toward the
middle
and then, and then
don't touch it or mov'e it
until it
came
on.
>> Should I start over
madam Chair and Members of the
Committee? My name is Moet Silva
and I'm the Executive director of
the New Mexico Coalition to end
homelessness and we stand
in opposition to HB
233.
Um The bill will directly
impact marginalized
communities. Um specifically
people experiencing
homelessness.
The bill does not address the many
issues with current competency,
determinations lack of trained
evaluators, lack of meaningful
cognitive testing, etcetera,
or create new competency,
recite programs.
All we have now is
NMBH I which lacks
the capacity to perform the duties
required by the
bill.
Um The original bill and the
substitute that was introduced, focus
on the judicial system and not
the individuals, many of
whom are the most vulnerable in our
society. With this. I ask
that the Committee vote no on HB
2233
>> madam Chair. Thank
you.
My name is Joel Phillips. I'm a
concerned citizen
and individual
rights advocate.
See it as
I said much earlier,
considering competency,
it's a slippery
slope
to be
protected in
any way possible by
the law. I think
this gives up some of those
Rs.
The other issue
is
although drug
addicts
and
people with mental issues
are in some ways
victims. I think
it's unreasonable and
unfair to
treat
under the law, to treat them
as victims
and not
have some
level of
responsibility.
So
to miss
any charges from them
because of those issues,
I just don't think it's fair. I think
it sends a baz
message
public and certainly
victims of crime,
an expectation that
people are held responsible
for their actions. Thank
you. I >> don't
>> think
>> exactly
yes.
Could, could we maybe close
the windows?
I know it May be warm in
here for some folks
but oh
and some folks are cold.
So that's my
excuse.
>> Go ahead. Thank you,
madam. Chair Members of the Committee.
My name is Benna Bar. I'm the chief public
defender.
There's a lot of good
things and good intentions in this
bill and it May be
able to get to where
it accomplishes what we
think needs to be accomplished.
Uh
We've talked to the governor's
office, um,
last month we talked to the
sponsor. Uh I,
I think the
problem is we're taking
treatment uh for
people with mental health issues and putting
it in the criminal competency
statute. Uh
And I,
I believe that there's
problems with having
the capacity, the number of doctors
that can do these kinds of evaluations.
What kind of evaluations are
necessary for competency as
opposed to treatment?
And then what happens if someone
is diverted somehow into
treatment and doesn't comply?
Does that mean
that they go back into the system
or if they comply and are
successful, do they become competent
and then are prosecuted as a
reward? So, I think these are
some, uh issues
that need to be worked out if they
can be worked out in this Session.
That's great. If not, we'll
continue to work with the
sponsor,
>> madam Chair uh Committee.
My name is Andrew VJS. I'm the
registered lobbyist for the Criminal
Defense Lawyer Association.
Um We stand in
opposition to the bill
uh for many of
them, the same reasons that the
previous opponents did
to. We want to commend
the sponsors, the
Chief Justice Zamora
and the good doctor here.
I think we see the intersection
between mental illness
and the criminal justice system is
one that's very
key. We
also very sensitive
competency statutes
are notoriously
complex. And because of the
subject matter, it's,
it should be done very lightly
and it should be done with as many
experts in the room as possible
so that we can reach consensus.
Unfortunately, I think
that the, the last point I'll just
make is that
we all want
better behavioral health services,
but they're just not there yet.
So some of the, in this bill, there's
some concepts in here
that just aren't there
like uh
uh comping
restoration supervisors.
Like there's like it mentions
it but, but who, where,
who are they housed with? Are
they part of the Department of Health or they
part of the justice system? We
don't know. So there's a lot of questions
we'll continue to work with the
sponsor.
>> Thank you. Is there
anyone on Zoom in
opposition?
We will go, we will go to
the audience in
support.
Uh
Wow.
OK.
Ok,
>> madam Chair, uh Jim
Jackson for disability rights
in New Mexico. And our Ceo
gary hasseen is here as
well. Um
I'm testing, I'm, I'm
in in support of this bill
because we love the concept
behind this bill. And so we
do hope that this effort
moves forward in some way or
another. But
it's also true that the more I
review this bill and I spent a lot
of time again on it last
night and the more I look
at it, the more problems there are
with the way the bill is
worded.
Um
Let me just give you a few
examples because we don't
have time to get into the
AAA long list. But
as the bill is written, there's a whole
new process for involuntary
commitment of people to mental health
treatment outside of the mental
health DD code. I'm not
sure that that's intended, but
that's what the bill says.
It eliminates a deadline.
That's really important for people
who have misdemeanors. If
their competency evaluation
comes back, they're
ready to go, either
they're competent or they're not
competent.
There's a deadline for when the
court's supposed to deal with that
evaluation and that,
that requirement is
eliminated in this
current. It
gives the district attorney veto
power over every
proposed
diversion. I think
diversion is a great idea, but
the D isn't always going to be
thrilled with diversion. But
if the courts convinced and if the
defendant wants that,
we think there ought to be an opportunity
for diversion. So there's a lot
of problems with this bill. We hope
that it can be addressed either this
Session or over the.
Thank >> you. Thank you.
Is there anyone on Zoom
in
support,
Connie?
Go ahead.
>> Hello. Can you hear me?
I'm >> sorry. Yes, we
can. >> I am so sorry.
I thank
you so much. I respect this Committee
very much. I,
I work directly with
Senator or TC Pino. I
have the most respect for
him. I heard Ben Bauer, most
respect for him. I am
very concerned about this bill.
I would request a table
on the bill.
Senate bill
233 has
a Co Copart
in the, in the Senate which
is Senate Bill 16.
I've been involved with the
Commission for
Mental Health. From the very
beginning I've attended
their meetings. I attended the one
in person I sat
next to justice Brianna Zamora.
Who knows this is coming in a
little bit late.
I also got an initial
draft from Senator or TC
Pino on November
4th and it came in as
an act. I
agree with Ben Bauer and
everyone who's in opposition,
not because it's not a
necessary bill
but because it's just not
ready. I feel like
the physical implications,
the reports from
all those departments we
heard from sentencing.
UN M Attorney General
hsdaocaoc
quoted nammi on
assistant outpatient treatment
but again, I think
we're putting the cart before the horse.
>> Thank you, Connie.
>> Can I make another statement, please?
I'm not finished
speech, >> Connie.
We are limiting people
to one minute. I, we're
being fair. Thank
you.
Ok. So, um is
there any, oh, that, that's the
end uh represents,
I mean,
it's gonna be a long day already.
Justice Zamora. Are
you on? And would you like to
make some
comments?
I think that is really
this. Um
I don't see her on.
So do you have
any?
Oh,
we go
ahead. >> Am
I commenting or testifying?
I apologize the entire
first part of the hearing I
couldn't hear. So
I wasn't sure where things were
at, but I'm
not going to do. You
are commenting.
Ok, so I have a minute.
Um,
this bill does something
that hasn't been done in the last
40 years. It
gives judges choices
on what to do when
competency is raised.
Um, and I want to
give you an example of what happens
right now in metropolitan
court, there's an individual who's
been in the justice system for the
last 15 years.
He's had over 100
cases. The cases
virtually have all been
dismissed. Um
Some are misdemeanors, some
are felonies. He's been in jail,
he's been hospitalized.
He's been
um
subject to conditions of
release, all of which is within
the judge's authority in a criminal
case. Not once
has he been connected to services,
treatment or diversion?
I am
asking this um
this body to please
uh consider alternatives
to what we have now,
which like I said is
jail
dismissal
and
um
sorry, I was, I had something
prepared to testify. So I'm not
really prepared to comment, but I
am um
do think that this is an
ongoing problem. I
hope that we are able
to address
it. I think the
most crucial parts of this,
this proposed Legislation
is section one which deals
with diversion
and section two that
deals with the competency
restoration that is
supported by the National Center
of State courts that
did uh that had a national
task force on how
to best address criminal
competency. Um
Eight of us from New Mexico,
from all different professions
went to S A MSA.
Um and these are recommendations
by them as well. So
I will, I hope that you'll consider it,
but particularly the section
one and section
two, which deal
with outpatient
restoration
and section three, I apologize,
it, deal with outpatient restoration
in the community and
diversion. We can't
build a restoration
system. Outpatient if it's not
authorized by statute.
So it is true that a lot of
this does not exist
because it's, it's not
in the law, but it's
time to build it up and it's time
to lay the groundwork because
what's happening now, what's
happened for 40 years is not
working.
>> Thank you, justice.
Any, any
comments from,
>> go ahead
and
you know, I don't get
um emotional
very often. But when I
do, it's
because
this is such a significant
issue that we
are addressing
and to be,
have people here that I
work in
day in and day in,
out for
the rest of us. Equality,
New Mexico
and,
and our other group for the homeless and
have not been
even
talked with about
this bill for them to really
understand
what this bill does
is a
disservice.
I just wanted to say that madam
Chair, it's disheartening
to hear
those types of
organizations stand here in this
kind of testimony against
a bill that is absolutely
and completely in
support of those issues.
It just happens to be.
This bill happens to be through
the lens of
the judicial
system which
we are hearing
in the testimony and comments
by Justice Aorta.
This topic has
not been introduced in
40
years.
There are parts to this that
are addressing what we need
to address because as
we know through this
Committee
that we have
a problem, we
have a crisis with
behavioral health and behavioral
health systems in our
State.
The this bill is
echoing the
cry
but also gives
us a path to
figure out how we
are going to
address this
issue.
We know in
2013
that our behavioral health system was
completely
dismantled.
I and my
child were
affected by
that
as many families,
as many people and lives
were lost
because
of what happened
then.
So I want to be very clear
to all those that
testified and who did not
even bother to
come and speak with me about
this.
I am I
challenge you
to come up with a better
solution
because this is the door that is
open right now for us
to take the challenge to
figure out how we are going
to address what needs to be addressed
through the court
system,
madam Chair. I would like
to defer to my
expert witness to add to
that.
>> Thank you, representative madam
Chair. Um
I believe so.
Um Would you like me to mov'e
it
closer?
All right.
Um
Well, I definitely
appreciate everyone coming
forward and sharing their
thoughts, opinions,
concerns, um,
as well as their hope streams and
desires really for
what we're attempting to do.
Um This process,
I would like to say started and
I'll echo this with a
group of eight of us getting the
opportunity to go
to a Sama Gaines Policy
Academy on competency.
So specifically on competency,
we were one of five states.
Uh We were there with
Alabama, North Carolina,
Texas, Washington
DC and ourselves.
Um Every
single State, I, I can
say that I have spoken with
every single State
uh in the United States regarding
what they are currently doing with
competency and everyone,
every single State is
struggling with this issue.
Is it complex?
Yes. Um
Is the complexity because
of the intersection of the
justice system and mental
illness? Yes.
Is it because most states
have a siloed system between
the justice system and community
providers?
Yes. Is it time to
solve that problem?
Yes.
At, at the Policy
Academy, we took a huge
bite. We said, yes,
we will address the statue
because like Representative
Luhan just mentioned
in order for us to build
some of these community
resources, we
have to be allowed to do
so. So
while this bill includes a
lot of
changes and
while I might agree, it
does need a little bit more TLC
which is allowed in this
process. It should
be allowed in this process.
That's how laws are
created.
Um
We took that party of
eight and we brought it back
to New Mexico and we
consulted
every single
stakeholder.
Then Bauer was in a meeting
with other public defenders.
I met with public defenders
from most judicial
districts. I met
with district attorneys from
most judicial districts.
I met with the
Senator, the representative,
I met with other legislators.
I met with executives
from
uh the Department
of Health from
BHSD I
met with community providers.
I met with our current
evaluators.
We have a system right now
that is unique
for the nation.
We don't have
a State hospital
system like other states
have, we have a
different problem
nationally. When we look
at competency, we
see a waitlist and
doj lawsuits
for wait times, getting
into restoration
programs and
initial competency
evaluations.
New Mexico took a really
progressive approach to
this. We
created the option
for treatment to competency
for those who are incompetent
and dangerous.
That is a very small
percentage of people
who qualify for treatment
to competency.
The rest of our defendants
go through an
outpatient competency
evaluation process
with contracted
evaluators.
New Mexico has
consistently been an
underserved
State and
underserved communities
in terms of all health
care related uh
agencies,
forensic evaluation is
not different.
We were paying, we were
underpaying forensic
evaluators for a very long
time. A year
ago. BHSD
increased that evaluator
rate which allowed for us to
hire significantly more
evaluators. But that
does not solve the
problem. The
problem is that we
have defendants
where competency is
raised, they
get an evaluation,
they are found not competent,
they are found not competent
and those charges are largely
dismissed. And
when those charges are dismissed,
that defendant leaves the
courtroom and
that's it. That's
all that happens. They
go back to whatever situation
they were in or
possibly worse because now
they're in a jurisdiction that they don't
know they're not
from there and they don't
have the capacity to get back to
where they have resources.
We are allowing people to
leave and go back to the
streets.
So I challenge those
individuals who
uh oppose
this bill in the same
way that Representative Lujan
does because
while I understand that we May
not have the current community
resources,
this bill
addresses
and allows New Mexico
to stand together
and say we're
ready to build that.
We're ready to support that
for our communities.
We are ready to take
a stand together that
says we will find a
way
because right now what we
have isn't
working and
it's not working for
everyone.
The amount of
disheartened feelings
that I have driving
through my community
when I see someone
in full hospital
scrubs with a hospital
blanket because I
know that they were just
discharged from the hospital
with absolutely no
plan and no
resources in place.
It breaks my
heart.
That might not be someone
in our judicial system,
but I can guarantee you that
it probably will be
for any type of
minor offense.
So while I understand
community concern
around the dismissal,
I would like to say that that's a
retention from the old
bill based
off of what stakeholders
are wanting.
I would like to say that although
I very much appreciate
um the concern
around
the need for parties
to agree in order
to mov'e forward with some of these
things, I think
that judicially
it's appropriate.
Um But I also
think that there's maybe
some,
some
misunderstanding
about what we currently have
happening here in New Mexico
in terms of what we have
available community
wide. And
I think more bills
like this are needed that
really pull all systems
together.
Thank you,
>> Senator. Did you have some
words?
Thank you madam Chairman and thank you
Members of the Committee for
letting me speak. Uh I,
I'm gonna have a, I'll be
presenting the Senate
version of this bill at
10 a.m. in Health
and Human Services Committee.
But, uh, thank you for
letting me come in and I
apologize because I didn't hear
what went on before. I would just
like to make a statement about why
I support this
many of, you know, that
in the past when
former Senator,
uh, uh,
former President pro
TEM uh,
of the Senate,
uh, I'm blocking
her name,
Mary Kay Papen,
uh, brought forth
her mandated outpatient treatment
bill. I was one of those who opposed
it. I think the first three times
she brought her forward. I spoke in
opposition finally
agreed to it only because we had
deleted the uh
option that if you
refuse treatment, you go to jail.
We took that out.
Um I've
kind of changed my tune
after, after participating
as a member as Representative
Lujan was in the
Supreme Court Commission
and, and, and hearing
two things that I, that I, that
I wanted to share with you
first. When the
court says
competency,
it doesn't
mean
they don't need treatment.
It just means
they know what's going on well
enough to stand
trial.
So if the, if the
competency
evaluation says
they're not
competent,
they can't stand trial,
we don't offer them
treatment. We don't
have a way of offering them treatment.
We just send them out the door
if it's a violent felony.
Yes, they send them to Las
Vegas and, and they
in the forensic unit there,
they, but for all the
misdemeanor cases and these
are the hundreds of people
that we see on the streets of
Albuquerque who go
through the court system
and right out the door because
they're not confident to stand trial
because they're mentally ill,
they're addicted or
they're alcoholic
and aren't able to,
to the second point
I wanted to say
is
we don't really,
I don't think we can really trust
somebody to say I want
treatment when they're mentally
ill when they're
addicted. When they're
under the influence of
alcohol.
That's,
that's not the right time to say. Do
you really want to go to treatment or
not when we, when
the right time is after they've
been stabilized
enough to make a good
decision.
And I think that's what I've come
to believe.
That makes me think differently about
this than I did when
Senator Papen was, was
pushing for mandated outpatient
treatment. This is a pretty
benign approach. If you, if
you really read through it
and it means we've got to step
up to the plate
and come up with additional
services because we have
waiting lists for most of our services
now without this
bill. But that's
what a society that really
cares for its mentally ill
and for its alcoholic
and addictive people should
do is provide the
services, not just
let them keeps. What happens
is the police get discouraged.
They arrest somebody for, for
one of these,
you know what I would call public
nuisance kind of misdemeanor
offenses taking food
off the plate of a,
of a somebody
eating dinner at a sidewalk
cafe in Albuquerque,
homeless person comes by
grabs food off the plate.
They get
arrested
and released the next day.
Maybe not even the next day,
maybe, maybe they just
released right away because they
know it's not even
pointless to go to court
third or fourth time that
happens. The police
stopped responding. It's a
waste of their time
and that's why we have the public's
perception that we're
not doing anything about.
So what they call
crime in Albuquerque, which is
largely in, in
people who really aren't
competent to stand trial
but who aren't getting any treatment?
This would provide the
treatment.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Also
joining us and briefly
introduce himself from
doh.
>> Hi madam Chair. My name is
Tim Shields. I'm the hospital
administrator for NMBH
I in Las Vegas, which
has been referenced a few
times. And I
just want to say that
uh we are in
support of this bill. This
bill does not impact
who would come to us
and we have the capacity to keep
serving the individuals
that already do come to us.
And again, this bill does
not change who is
eligible to come to the State
hospital
>> without madam Chair. We stand for
questions. >> Ok.
Uh I have Representative
Ferrari
Jones,
Vincent. Ok.
Let me write because my memory
is not that long.
Um
So I have Ferrari Jones,
Vincent and Chavez
and Herndon. Ok.
So Representative Ferrari, go
ahead. >> Thank you
madam Chair and thank you
Senator and representative
and your experts
for bringing this
forward. We've spoken
a lot about this problem
and interim for health and
human services
and,
um,
an example that I always
bring up is, um,
a friend of mine whose
son had served in the
military,
he, um, was
in jail, um,
for
somewhat of a violent
crime. He held
someone up with a BB gun
and was trying to get their
phone because he was
having PTSD and
psychosis at the same
time, um,
thinking that,
um, spies
were after him and all
kinds of things, but he
was put in jail
and
they only, um,
tried to send him up
to, um, see
if he had, if he was competent
to stand trial.
And after many
months of staying in jail
without any
um,
uh medication
or, you know, uh
behavioral support.
Um,
and
with that, he,
um, finally
got up sent up
to uh
Las Vegas. They
didn't have the paperwork, right. They
sent him back and
then,
um,
had to try and send him again.
Finally, they found
someone who could,
um, with
the veterans hospital
help him get
out of jail
and, um,
and get the ser behavioral
services he needed.
My question
is,
is the competency,
does it have to be
established
um, at only
the State hospital or
are you asking for
psychiatrists that are
with approved by the court?
Also to be able
to help with
that
>> uh madam Chair and
represent Ferrari,
uh
this bill is actually trying to
address that very thing.
So what
the attempt would be is to have
those outpatient restoration
services so
that that individual could be
seen quicker,
more timely and in
his own community.
Um In
addition, most states
are looking at starting that
restoration, that restoration
process in custody.
So
immediately when
competency is raised,
then he would
be sort of
streamlined into this other
process where there would
be that diagnostic evaluation
he would be looked at for medication
and he would start that restoration
process in custody.
Um That's
very much limiting
the time that he would have spent
in the justice system in
total. So,
yes, this and
to just go off of
what Justice Zamora
said, um, in
sections two and three, we talk
about that out. That's the
outpatient restoration
version. Um
Again,
to what Doctor
Shields just mentioned,
this doesn't impact
who goes to the
State hospital. It
just broadens the services for
all of those who do not
qualify or
May not qualify
under the civil commitment
aspect of things.
Thank you.
>> Um,
Senator Representative
and expert. Um I
think
that
that is a great
improvement
for, you know, what he had
to go through a year in jail,
um, which
wasn't necessary
but he was
able to be,
um,
uh
put into the,
um, um,
oversight of
uh the veterans
hospital.
But if he had
become competent
while he was in jail,
are you? And is this
bill going to make it? So
people are
helped to be competent
just to then go through
trial or
is there a way that they can
help to become competent
and then into
a jail diversion
program,
>> uh, represent Ferrari. That's
correct. So we would,
um, we're looking at
right this, what this bill
does is it and
back to what Justice Zamora was
saying, it allows for
more of those choices to be made.
So, without the
diversion to treatment aspect
of this bill,
what would happen is that person
would be treated to competency
and then they would go back through the justice
system. What
this allows is if
you actively engage and
participate in restoration,
then there is a different avenue
that could be taken,
which looks more like
um the appropriate
level of care. In
addition, I just want to say
um it's not
just psychiatry.
So in, in
general, psychiatrists
oversee medication.
Um a restoration program
is typically run by
psychologists and
master's level
clinicians. So
what this bill also does
is it allows for us to
build a wider net
of workforce
um across
the all tiers of
professional training.
We have so many
master's level social workers
here in the State with
um I think we have three
programs at this point
that are looking to
get involved in this system,
but we don't have anywhere to place them
at this point. So I
just wanted to make
a note that it's
varying levels of
professionals that we would be
recruiting here
and most of those people
already exist.
>> Thank you. Thank you madam Chair I'm
sorry, I forgot to address you.
Um, and
Representative Senator,
it,
um,
something was mentioned about
how, um, this
had to be approved
by the D
A not the
courts. How
does that work?
>> Thank you. Representative,
um, in the
traditional civil commitment
process, the
State has to make the
referral that
hasn't changed. So, that's
true. Now, and that, that
part won't change the
part for diversion and the
part for outpatient
restoration, that's
if both parties agree.
So it's not just,
I mean, the D A then technically
would have to agree. Right.
Um What I've
heard across the State,
um, from all district
attorneys is
this exasperation
for a competency
process and specifically
for the individuals that are
involved.
Um I have
not received any
nonsupport from
any district attorney's office
for this bill. Thank
you. >> I'm
sorry, madam. Chair. Would you say
that again? You did not have any
opposition from, >> I did not have any
opposition from any of the District
Attorney's offices. >> Yes. Ok.
Thank you. And madam
Chair. I just like
to mention Connie V Hill
who didn't get a chance
to finish speaking. She
is trying to set up
across the State
different, um, jail
diversion programs where there
is actually a facility
set up where,
um, you know, this
programs like this would be able
to send
um
I
madam Chair
clients. I don't know if you want to
say anything about that. Thank you. Thank
>> you. Yes, that, that is
something that would,
would demand
a lot of
planning. And
without this in place, I would
add those sorts of
um regionalized
um centers
would, would have a hard
time
without this type, this
piece of Legislation helping
them in that infrastructure portion,
madam Chair.
>> Thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank, thank you representative
and I'm gonna ask both the
questioners and the
um
presenters to try and
keep it as brief as you can.
So next we'll go to
Jones. >> Thank
you madam Chair
and thank you Representative
Lujan and experts.
I appreciate you being here. Good to see you
Mr. Shields.
Um
We talked about this
and, and I don't think there's anybody
here who would argue that
we have a mental health
crisis in New Mexico
that should have been addressed long
ago.
Um,
so I know that what I
know what you're trying to do, it's a big
piece and, you know, I talked
about, you know, what you, what you guys
had going with, um, looking
at competency,
it's constantly
a problem and I know
in my rural communities and
maybe we see it a little bit differently
because
as a smaller community,
we know all the people that are
in and out of the system, the
offenders who end up,
you know, they're, if they're
psychotic or they're,
uh, substance
addicted, they
end up in and out of,
of the court system
and there's no way to keep
them. So I
appreciate, you
know, my, my das
um um,
and, and I think there's no, no
argument that compete, competency
needs to be addressed and
changed.
Um,
we could talk about this all day.
I know you guys have done that for days
and weeks and, um,
but I'm gonna have to focus
in on some, some things
that, that um
are concerns.
First of all, I'm getting a lot
of pushback from
um
from
constituents and you know,
from, from others, not even out
in my district, they're
concerned that this could be
abused, that people could
be falsely accused
and end up
um
possibly committed.
And so I'd like for you
to address that and show me where that
there are safeguards and protections
against that.
>> Thank you. I,
this bill does not
go beyond the scope
of, of
what that concern is.
Although we, we need to
always ask questions, we
understand that,
but
to think
that somebody could be falsely
accused and then
penalized for that through this
process, what we
are trying to do is to
give additional
resources so
that we are
creating a new
process
to
um rehabilitation
or restoration if you
will. And I think
that that is, that is part
of the information and new
information. We don't
understand these new terminologies
and these, these new processes.
In fact,
if we are to
enact this, then we would
actually prevent those
kind of um concerns.
And I would ask
briefly my
um expert two
comment.
>> Thank you. I think that's a really
good question.
Um
The
the process for getting
civilly committed is really
challenging. Um you
have to be really
impaired, you have to be
a danger to yourself or to
others. And
the qualifications for that
is very, very
high. So,
um I think that
we all just have to recognize
that that's there
for a reason.
Um, it's there
to safeguard against
what exactly what you're talking
about. Um,
what this bill is
really trying to do is to
prov is really
actually to prevent people
from going to the hospital.
Um, while there are
additional ways for
people to get care,
the true heart of this is
for a continuum of
care and for people to
get appropriate levels
of care. Um
Right now, what you'll hear
from most people is the only
option is the State
hospital. Um
And that's not appropriate, it's,
it's really not appropriate
for most people.
Um So
this bill like Representative
Luhan just said, is really
designed to prevent
um and to create
additional treatment
options that
aren't in the civil
commitment
area.
>> Thank you. Thank you madam Chair
and thank you, I'm sorry, I've
forgotten your name,
Doctor Nether
Nether. Ok. Thank you.
Um So
uh madam Chair and
doctor Neer. Um
Representative, I, I
have some
real perspective on that, you know,
as, as a healthcare
professional and having
dealt with, you know, mentally ill
people. Um
I uh and and
also just really investing
myself in this issue, which is why
Representative Louhan and I
have had conversations about this
being a real problem.
Um I, I don't
think, well, let me just
ask, ask this as questions
rather than my opinion.
Um Is it
true that this bill
focuses on
um outpatient treatment
as
diversion
Yes,
thank you. Thank you madam
Chair.
Um
So would we be looking
at um
a person who's perhaps
psychotic and has
an addiction to
substance, whatever
that May be
being
released
to the
Street where they came
from and expected
to attend outpatient
treatment.
>> That's also a very good
question. Um
This bill also
aims at that
collaborative piece that I mentioned
prior. So
um in
inside of all of this,
um the
I guess I'll reference the Policy
academy also
created a pilot project
which is being piloted in four
judicial districts.
Um It's in the process of
being piloted in four judicial
districts, this diversion to
treatment model. Um
What's included in that
is forensic
navigation, which
you saw a bill from
Representative Lujan
earlier um
for uh Santa Fe
County to receive similar
funding, I believe that passed.
Um So there would be a
forensic navigator on the judicial
side who would hook to a
case manager
outside with peer
navigation and support.
It's an entire wraparound
process. That diversion to
treatment is a true
community support
process. Um
I think what's I think
what's also additionally
challenging is we
can't put everything
in this bill,
right? Like we can't write it all
here. So there's going to
be, there's going to need to be
a look at rule amendment.
There's gonna have to be processes
and policy created around
these projects. But
again, back to
what Representative
Luhan said, there's no
reason for us to
create policy and
programs if
legally we are not allowed to use
them. So this
bill has to happen first
before we can really dive
into and look at that.
Um the diver the
diversion to treatment, the
outpatient restoration,
all of this is
if it
exists
in the area,
right? If it exists,
it's aspirational in that
way, which a lot of other states
have done when they've looked at
statute an amendment
because of the lack of
resources. So
um it can't
go in here,
but it has to go somewhere,
but we can't do it until we
see it here.
>> Thank you madam Chair and thank you, Doctor
Neer and Representative
Lujan.
So I guess what I hear you
saying is that we're
not sure it works because
this is a pilot project.
Um But we're, we have
it in this bill and it's
going into law. Is that
correct?
>> Um Thank you. Uh Not
quite
um we know
that it works other places. So
again, going back to all of
the consultation that's happened
with many, many
other states around what they're
currently doing these
programs work. Um
And they see a lot
of benefits,
there's a lot of community benefits.
So we know they work.
Um Again, I think
what we have to be
thoughtful about is
how does it work for New
Mexico? Um How does
it work for our population? How does
it work for our communities?
How do we include our
Pueblos and our native
population. How do we
address um the
the diversity and the
equity. How do we make
sure that these are available
that people can get to them,
that there's transportation
or that there's a virtual option
or that everyone has high speed
internet, right? This
bill really touches
on the heart of
expanding
services here in New
Mexico to
address all of the
mental health issues, but all of
really the access issues
that we've seen. Thank
you. >> Thank you madam
Chair. Thank you, Doctor Nur
and I, I agree
with you that there is, there's a place
for that with some
offenders uh that
are, are mentally
ill or uh
deal with substance use
addiction on some
level. Um but
I know that that's not going
to work for everyone. I know
that the people that we see in
our communities and I'm sure, you
know, I've been, I've
driven down streets of
Albuquerque too, those
people,
uh the the possibility
probability of those
people
um
being an uh an
outpatient,
effectively
being in an outpatient
treatment program,
it just, it just won't
happen. You can't, I don't
think you can release
people into uh
their former environment
and expect them to be in and
out of outpatient
treatment and especially
if there's no motivation for them to
show up. So
I'm trying my best madam
Chair and representative
Doctor and Mr.
Shields, trying my best to
focus in on this
bill is, is about the law.
This is about um
you know, competent changes
versus
discussing treatment
options and what works with
whom and all of that
because you have
such a variety of people that
need help.
Um So,
so I, I guess I'm
disturbed that
that that piece is
part of, of
this and that it limits,
there's a seems to be a limitation
toward just outpatient
diversion
madam Chair.
Um
I presented uh and
this is how we got started
on competency as
an issue. I, I presented
the Miami Model
to the Health and Human Services
Committee during the
interim and,
and I hope that, you know, that we
can still consider that, that,
that maybe some of us could go
there. I know uh we've
got some other legislators
on board with that
successful model for
treatment. There are
people who will
not uh
comply with treatment,
especially if there's no motivation
to do so. And
I think what we were working
toward with
this and this is what I
hope competency
will address
that, that
we can change the, the
um the
mental health code here in New
Mexico to
require if
somebody's an offender, a nonviolent
offender, by the way,
that to require
that they receive
treatment. And I don't think there's
any way to require treatment
if it's outpatient.
So that model does
require long
term uh
treatment and it's
successful that it's successful
in every way. We've got those stats
and the data over 24 years,
that program that's been
developed is
successful in addressing
um
the mentally ill and
um those
who also deal
with substance use, they
shouldn't be incarcerated. We know
that we need diversion
desperately but
sending them back out to the
streets and an in
a um an
outpatient model
simply just, it just
doesn't work.
So, um
so how do you,
how does outpatient
uh how does um
inpatient diversion
fit into this picture with
competency? Can you tell me
that? >> So madam
Chair, as mentioned before, the inpatient,
we're, we're hoping to get
um
start the process while
in custody. So
I think that, that
I'm I'm hearing everything that you're
saying. Uh madam Chair
representative is we've had these
many discussions,
but what we
need to do is get
these models established
so that we can build upon what you're referring
to in the Miami example
in the Miami model
because without
having the
infrastructure through the the
justice process,
then we're not going to be able to use
those as widely
or as
efficiently and
effectively into
our diversion programs.
I don't know if that you're asking
specifically about the inpatient,
as mentioned before, what this
process would do would
start while
the, while the individual
is in custody.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative Lujan.
I share your frustration.
I, you know, I really
do and I know this is a
start, I really feel like it's a big
piece of, of the
whole picture and we need to
address competency.
Um
So,
so
where was I going with
that? So,
um madam
Chair,
it, this is such
a um a
serious effort,
you know, it, it can affect people
and in a way that
um
it can change either for the, the
better or for the worse.
And, and so because
changing this law
is so
important, I feel like we
need to keep working on this
bill and there is,
there's another bill that I'm
supporting, I'm actually
sponsoring SB
23 which
which looks at the mental health
code. That's a study
that looks at the mental health code and
takes it into consideration
and makes recommendations
which I feel like we should work together
on that, passing
this through incomplete
and, and not um
fully addressed and really
refined is
I just don't feel like that's good
Legislation at this point,
although I totally respect
what you're trying to do and I don't
want to take away from that in any
way. Um I
think we need collaboration
just not just
from the legal aspect
of mental health
madam Chair. But
from um
the medical perspective,
we have to make sure that we're doing the
right thing that's going to work in the
future. So I hope that we
can collaborate on this
and uh and
work on this bill before we
send it any further. Thank you, madam
Chair. >> Thank
you. Uh And our
time is going really quickly.
So I'm gonna ask people to
just ask questions and
answer them as succinctly
as you can.
Um I know this is a, a
heavy-duty issue
and um but
unfortunately, this isn't the
interim where we have a lot
of time. Um So I
will go to Representative
Vincent.
>> Thank you madam Chair and
thank you representative
and experts. Good
to see you doc from all the
way down from Las
Vegas
and thank you for hosting us this
this
interim.
So I just had a few questions
and I'm, I'm gonna try not to beat
this up too bad madam
Chair because I know you
don't like that.
But uh I was looking
on page two of
the substitute
line one
and it says good
faith basis.
What is good faith
basis
>> madam Chair representative,
that is a legal term and
I will leave it to my expert
if she would like to expand on
that.
>> Uh Thank you madam Chair.
Uh Good faith
basis is the legal
language that's already used
um when
describing raising the issue
of competency.
>> Thank you madam Chair. And
representative and experts.
So, um on
line two, the
court shall order a competency
competency
evaluation.
And I mean, this sincerely do the
judges, how
do they, are they
trained to
understand if somebody
is suffering
from mental illness or
psychosis or whatever
substance abuse?
>> Thank you for the question.
Um
A good question, but I will defer
again to my
expert.
>> Uh Thank you. And yes,
that's a very good question.
Um At the end of the day,
the Judge is the ultimate
fact finder. So
while we currently have
a process wherein
the Judge orders a competency
evaluation, the
reason in which that good
faith based
approach is,
what are the concerns
that the defense and
the Judge May actually see from
the defendant in the courtroom
that makes them question
whether or not the individual
comprehends
the, the whole
judicial process. There
are four State prongs
involved with competent, with
competency. So being
able to consult with your
attorney with a reasonable degree
of rational understanding,
factual, and rational
understanding of the proceedings,
uh the be the ability
to uh
consult
and assist in your own
defense.
Um and
the
uh to
comprehend the reason for
punishment.
So
if at any point,
there's someone in the courtroom, a
defendant in the courtroom
wherein any
party feels
that that person's competency
is compromised.
Competency can be raised,
competency can be raised at any
point during the
judicial process.
Uh So
that's, I guess,
I, I don't know if that answers
>> it does. Thank
you.
Did you have something to say?
Ok, and
madam Chair and
representative, so the
court shall order a competency
evaluation. How
long could that possibly
take? And is
the person put back
out on the streets? Are they
incarcerated for the time
until it takes
them to get
evaluated?
>> Thank you, Miss madam
Chair, Representative
Vincent. That would be,
that would be discussed during the
rule, the rules
and setting those those
time.
>> Ok, madam Chair. So when
we say nonviolent
crimes, could you just give
me two or three examples of what a
nonviolent crime would
be?
And then give me one example of
what a borderline
nonviolent crime would
be.
>> I am not an attorney.
Um And
so I will, I will defer
and I believe our
justice is off, but
I will defer to the expert
here for those,
those uh if we
have those examples, but it would be
anything that wouldn't be determined
as a felony or it
would be as I understand
a
misdemeanor.
That's,
>> yeah, I, that, I think that,
that, uh, sums it up. I'm
also not an attorney, so
I'll say that too.
Um, but it's,
um, misdemeanor crimes
are typically nonviolent crimes,
the nonviolent felonies,
um, I think are listed out in
statute already as well as the
violent
felonies.
>> Thank you. Thank you madam Chair. The, the
only reason I ask that is
because
you, you mentioned earlier
that, you know, if somebody goes by
and picks up some food off of your
plate and I
think that if somebody
went and picked up some food off
my plate,
say my wife's plate
that could turn into a
violent
problem right there because I wouldn't
appreciate that at
all.
Um, madam Chair
and representative. So
if the parties agree, let
me go to line, uh,
page two,
line six.
If the parties agree,
the court May order that
the defendant be diverted
to a treatment program.
If such programs are
available
all throughout
the interim,
there's no availability
and that's the, that's a
problem. So how do
we fix that madam
Chair
or is that, is that a legit
question? I mean, what do we do, what
do we do with the person >> that is
out of the truly
out of the scope of what we're trying to do
with this bill because that would lead
to what we're discussing
in the diversion programs
and in
contemplating the, the
planning of how
we,
we meet those demands.
>> That's a much bigger discussion
than this bill. So let's try
to stay on this bill and
again, remind people
to try to be
brief.
>> Ok?
So,
you know, right here
it's, I think I'm I'm ST
sticking to the bill. If you just give me
a short answer, what if
the it says
that there's gonna be, they're gonna be
sent to a treatment
program. If there is
no availability, are they
gonna remain incarcerated or
they just are they on house
arrest
>> mantra as,
as things are now, if
there is not a treatment
program in place, as
mentioned throughout the, they would
be, they would be
released.
>> Thank you madam Chair. And in
closing, I would just
say I
have some concerns where
your bill has good
intent.
And the reason I say it has good
intent is
I know how much work that
Representative Jones has put into that
Miami model
and she got
super passionate about
it where I have
a problem is I've
received a lot of
emails and
I'd be glad to show them to
you. And I
heard the opposition today
that the bill was just not
quite there
and
the last thing that I would say
is the
people that said the bill
is not quite there.
Have you worked with
them? And would you be willing
to work with them?
And do you feel like this
bill is complete
>> madam Chair? I appreciate those
questions and yes, we have worked
with some of them and others
have not even
um
I, I, I'm questioning
what, what the real issue is
when the, when you're looking at the
legal system and the ling legal
language with some of the
questions and some of the opposition
that I heard today, I will
address those.
I feel that uh
do I feel that this is ready?
Well, we as legislators
in part of our job and what we do
is to evaluate
laws and amend
them accordingly. What
this bill does is it
reintroduces a
law that has
been antiquated.
And if, if anybody
here attended
any of our interim committees, not
just in this for this
Committee, but also
in legislative finance
Committee where we were
talking with our courts
and, and das and
everybody and the
amount of
issues that we received
and the amount of funding that
was requested because
they wanted to know what the bottom
line was and why we
were at this point.
And not once until I
spoke that it was
brought up that
our behavioral health
system is
completely in crisis.
We are releasing
individuals
constantly, we call more
frequent flyers. It was a
big issue. There's a lot of
discussion. So my
question and my
response is if we do not start
this process now, if
we do not attempt to
fix something that is very
broken, then when
and how? Thank you madam
Chair. >> Thank you madam
Chair and
I appreciate that
answer. And
I'm gonna say this
out of respect for you
and out of respect for the intent of
the bill. I will
not be voting for this today just
because I don't, I, I won't, I don't
think it's complete. Thank you,
madam, Chair, >> Representative
Jones, madam
Chair, I mov'e to table uh
HB 233
for further discussion and
collaboration.
>> Representative Jones. Actually, I
think the, um,
I'm going to suggest
perhaps that we
um pass it
with A no R
so that it can go on to
judiciary because a lot of the
issues in here are
legal that we
as a Committee are not
set up. So, so
would if you are
acceptable with that,
if not, we will go ahead
and take the t vote on the
tabling motion.
>> Madam. Can you madam Chair? Can
you please explain passing
with no rec >> basically
that tells the Committee the next
Committee that we have issues
with it, but that we,
we feel like the, the
basic idea is good
enough to mov'e it along and
allow the a more
appropriate Committee around
the legal stuff to have a look
at it. >> Thank you,
madam. Chair. As long as that
does leave the door
open for us to fix
this work together,
collaborate.
I'm I find
that acceptable. Thank you madam Chair.
Thank you so much for your
presentation. >> OK. We will go
to Representative
Chavez.
>> Thank you madam Chair,
representative.
Um So
I I also have
some concerns about the
bill.
Um
on page
four, it
looks like madam Chair
that the time
frame
to complete an
evaluation has
moved from
10 days to 30
days.
Is that right?
It's at the line
one through line
eight
>> Mantri
that that
information on uh in
this section is for
the hearing, not
for the
evaluation.
>> Ok. So uh madam
Chair representative,
why was there an additional
amount of time? Why did,
why did the time mov'e from
10 to 30? Which to me
seems like
um a long
period of time to have the
hearing?
Um And what
we're doing with
that is that we're keeping folks
in in
jail for a longer period of
time.
>> Mm
Madam Chair, I'll read if you go
to page three
of the bill line 24 a
hearing on the same day regarding
the issue of the
competency and
dangerousness of
an incarcerated
defendant
charged with a felony
shall be held by the district
court within a reasonable
time, but in no
event later
than 30 days
after notification of the
court of completion
to the diagnostic
evaluation. So
we are we are
engaging in addressing
the
Yeah, for dangerousness
and currently there is no timeline.
So we are putting some framework around
this and with,
with those uh with that
uh added time
or change time. Thank
you.
>> OK.
Um So the other
um the other questions that I
have are around uh
resources,
right?
Um
How long does it take at
this point in time, madam Chair
representative
for
someone who is being
held uh
for competency. How
long does it take them to be seen
by a, either a
psychiatrist or a
psychologist?
>> I'll defer to my
expert.
>> Um at this point are
in custody, individuals
are, are being
seen in custody
by a psychologist.
Um I'd say anywhere
between one
and two weeks
after incarceration,
depending. Um
there's a lot of things that can
interfere with that
process.
Um
So I don't wanna,
I don't know an exact like
average time, but I
i it's pretty quick at this
point for in custody
defendants. >> So
madam Chair representative
for those who
are seen in jail within that, I
mean, by a psychologist within
that time frame and they need
medication. Are they provided
medication while they're
incarcerated?
>> And ch
I'm being told it depends. I
think that we, we've had this
discussion in interim as
well, but it
depends
>> madam Chair representative on
what
I'll differ.
>> Representative, she
could just go ahead in the interest
of time, just whoever has
the answer. >> It depends on
the facility. It depends
on what the facility has
in terms of their own resources.
If they have an on site psychiatrist
who is doing the medication
management, um it
usually happens pretty quickly
and appropriately.
Uh if there is a consultant,
then that might take a little bit longer
and then I it depends
on whether or not that
person feels
comfortable prescribing.
Um if there's enough
qualified staff for oversight
of the medication and the
defendant, um there's
a lot of different things that goes into
that and I would say it's a little
bit, I mean, that part is a
little bit outside of the scope of what we're
talking about here.
>> Uh Madam Chair
representative, uh with
regard to
um the
State hospital, I know it
has a different name
but you know,
um
madam Chair
representative, um my
question has to do with
um what's taken into
consideration when there's
an evaluation to
determine competency.
Do you look
at
the cognitive
functioning uh
of the person?
Do you look at um
for example, I
Qs, you know what,
what all goes
into your
evaluation of whether or not someone
is competent
>> madam Chair that would depend
on the evaluation
or civil commitment and,
and the evaluation of
the dangerousness during
the
proceedings.
That would get to your question if
you wanted to add to anything
>> madam Chair, Representative
Chavez, this
bill doesn't really change
the definition of competence
and what goes into that?
So to answer your question, yes, all
of those things are considered
by the psychologist doing the
evaluation plus a
number of other
things.
>> I don't, I don't think I have any
other questions, but I do want to just
make one last comment. I
am concerned that
while you
indicated that you have had
conversations with the public
defender, I am concerned
that they did stand
in opposition to this bill.
And to me that sends a very
strong message in terms of we
need to continue to work on
it. Thank you, madam
Chair Representative
Hernden.
>> Thank you madam Chair and
thank you uh presenters
and thank you to the sponsor of
this Legislation.
I also stand
um strongly in
favor of behavioral health
programs
that um
should be in place so that we
are decriminalizing
mental illness.
So that absolutely should
be something that we're looking
at. What I do see. A lack
of is a lack of
coordination
between
what's going on now in terms
of behavioral health care.
And so that is a,
this is the fourth bill
that has come forth
that the lack of
coordination still is not
showing how the bills are gonna be
coordinated. So
I I'm there is
one bill that is
showing that there is a
coordination that needs
to occur and it's
causing a task
force to be created
to create the coordination
that would take care of the issues
that I think are somewhat
prevalent in your bill.
So I want you to keep an
eye on house Bill 34
that's hugely important
in that coordination, two
things. Uh madam Chair that
I do wish to bring out. I I'm
concerned about
treating the underlying
mental health
issues uh
in accordance
with or align with the term
if the person is
charged or incompetent. I
think we run into some
serious problems.
The second item is, I do
think that there May be
a article 14
constitutional issue that
is raised and
uh that would have to do with
your ability to keep
a person at in
any event it unless
they have been determined dangerous.
So I'm looking at,
I'm looking at the consti
the constitutional and legal
issues here and
do think that um
I, I want to just say that I concur
with my, with my
colleague, Representative Chavez
that the fact that the public
defender who defends
these people who are most
likely to need this service
stands in opposition
to the to
the bill. And I would just
say madam Chair
and, and
um
and presenters that it
does it to have to
sit down and have this conversation
and what for whatever reason they
weren't at the table before that
we fix it and
that you have
an excellent, excellent
idea, but you have some
constitutional issues
that I am really afraid
of. >> Thank you madam Chair and
just to respond to that,
this does not change anything
constitutionally. We
are, we are still in the
scope within
the law of this bill that
you're just looking at the felony and
dangerous and criminal
charges. We're not, we're
not reaching beyond
that scope. So that,
that I hope that that
answers that question for you. As
far as the public defenders, we
have had intimate
conversations with them and
it was quite surprising
to have them here in
disagreement with us today.
I had not been consulted with
them uh prior
to to our hearing today,
but before that,
we seem to be on the same page.
Thank you madam Chair.
>> Thank you madam. >> Thank
you Representative
>> madam Chair. I think we've heard
everyone say we have problems
with this bill. I I
want to revive my
motion to table this bill
to table 233
for further collaboration
and discussion. >> OK.
We will go to the tabling
motion after Representative
Kates has had her
question.
Thank you, Representative
Kates. >> And thank you madam
Chair and thank you presenters.
And I will be quick. I
first want to very much
applaud the representative,
the presenters and Senator
Ortiz Pino. This is
a very big
lift and
one that we have heard
over and over again in
interim committees that is
needed. So
I um II
I really do
appreciate
you bringing it forward. You've
heard the comments, there's been
very good comments here and
you said yourself that you do
need to make a. So
now I've reduced
it down to one question,
which is what would
you like this Committee to
do?
>> Would like us to know or do
madam Chair.
>> What are you asking from this
Committee?
>> We're asking to take your
expertise and
your questions as
you've eloquently put forward
today and to consider
that it's not easy to make
change. But if we
don't take a position and we
don't start that change, we're not
gonna, we're gonna have the same
results.
And I think that this is that that
time to, to make
a decision. And I, I
respect what our
Chair has said
uh in her position
as a uh
send it to the judiciary
Committee for those
legal questions
to be furthered and
for us to have those discussions,
madam Chair.
>> Thank you madam Chair and, and
thank you representative. I, I
do encourage
um I, and I understand
change is very difficult
and, and especially
uh when we were talking about
um a legal change,
but you have a lot
of stakeholders here that
need to be at the table
when you are being informed
by those changes.
And, um,
and, and, and I,
and I wish you
um the support
but this is, this is not a fully
baked bill yet.
I look forward to
when it is. Thank
you.
>> We have a motion on the
table to for
a, a tabling
motion on the table
uh by Representative
Jones and a second by
Vincent. So
Jennifer, if you could take the
role,
>> is it
>> representative K
No to table? >> Oh,
I'm sorry,
I was
so I forgot
the um so a
tabling motion on
the Health and Human Services
Committee substitute for
House Bill
233.
>> So does that put us back on
the
field?
>> We have a motion to
table.
>> Did we, did we ever
adopt the
substitute?
So madam Chair, would that mean that
we're, we're tabling the
bill
>> if, if we vote
cabling motion takes precedence.
So there, if it
fails, there will be another
motion afterwards which
May include to adopt the
sub.
So we both
we are voting on the
sub.
>> So I guess the question
was if we never adopted
it can be
tabled
>> madam Chair.
Yes, I
don't understand madam Chair,
how we can
vote.
We've been discussing this but
we never adopted it. So
we're, we would be voting to
motion to table the
bill,
correct
>> it. It's my understanding
that that,
um,
this is part of the discussion
of the bill that we haven't
adopted the sub
because if we're just gonna table
it, we don't need to adopt
it.
>> So madam Chair, I'm just trying
to understand what we're doing right now.
So are we tabling the bill?
That was my intention?
>> We are tabling the sub,
which is what we are discussing,
which is the
bill.
>> So you are moving to
table for the discussion
of the and
so the bill is then you
back on the bill because we have
to
>> everybody on the same
page.
>> Ok. >> So we, this is a
tabling motion for
the sub. If it
fails, we will go
back and take
further action on the
sub.
Yeah.
>> Representative
Chavez
on the
>> table,
madam Chair.
I would like to
um adopt the sub.
Then I'd like to withdraw my
motion to table
because I thought
I was tabling the bill,
not the sub. If we have
to adopt
a seven table it,
then that, that's what we need to do.
That's what, that's my
intention.
>> So we will take the,
the essent, ok.
We will, I will ace
ace. But
if we take a motion
to accept the
sub, then that
essentially is voting on the sub.
But the tabling motion
takes precedence over
all other
motions.
>> Uh OK. I I
make my motion to, to
table hb
233.
>> We are, we are in discussion
on the sub. So we will
table the sub if the
bill if the the
votes act, that way,
if not, we will be back on
discussion of the
sub.
>> Representative
Chavez
Representative Ferrari. No
to table
representative
Jamil,
Representative Jones.
>> Yes to
table
>> Representative
Vincent. Yes,
the table
madam vice
Chair,
>> not the table, the
Sun
>> madam Chair. Uh
>> no,
by a vote of 6 to 2.
The motion has
failed
and we are back on discussion
of the sub and
I will entertain a motion
on the
sub
to I'll mov'e
in no recommendation.
So what we are moving
is a
no um a do
not pass on
house health and human.
No, I do not pass on
House Bill 2233
but I do pass with no
recommendation on House
Health and Human Services Committee
substitute for House Bill
233. So we are
voting on whether to
pass the
substitute with no
recommendation, which is
basically sends a message
to the next Committee which is
judiciary that we
have issues with the bill. But we
like the idea of the
bill essentially. >> I
second that
motion.
>> Ok.
Go ahead
Jennifer.
>> Representative Kate.
Yes,
representative
Chavez
Representative Ferrari.
Yes,
Representative
Jaramillo
Representative
Jones.
>> Let me clarify madam
Chair. We're I'm voting
on send
and sending
this bill to the
next Committee
with no
recommendation.
Sending the Committee
sub for
233
to the next Committee with no
recommendation.
Yes,
>> Representative Vincent.
Yes
madam Beiste.
Yes
madam Chair.
>> Yes. Yes.
By a vote of 8 to
0. You have a due
pass with no recommendation.
Thank >> you madam Chair. Thank you
Committee.
>> Yeah.
Ok. Um
We have uh rep
we will leave lose
representative Ferrari
at 11 for
another Committee.
And um I'm also on that
Committee so there May be some,
some uh back and
forth, but we are going to go
ahead and start
on house Bill
258
representative Armstrong
premium tax for
emergency services
whenever you're ready.
Representative,
>> thank you madam Chair
and um hello to
my fellow Committee. Uh Good
to see you guys.
I have on a little lighter
note but just
as important uh madam
Chair. Um I do
have a Committee substitute
for House Bill 258.
If someone would like to
mov'e that and
we'll take a peek at that first,
>> it will >> be >> passed,
give us a minute to get it passed
out, but I will entertain a motion
to discuss the
sub.
Ok. Do you have a
second?
Ok.
So
who made the motion
here? Ok.
So the discussion
motion was her meal with the
second by
Kate.
>> Shall I continue or do
you, am I
waiting?
>> Do we have her in >> later
home? >> I know I
made it. So. Ok, let me
see. Give us
a second. We're trying
to locate
the,
>> they
couldn't
uh I'll have >> to go over
copies. I'm
sorry,
I'm sorry. We, we don't
have copies. So give
us a, luckily the
print shop is
close.
So hold on a sec
if >> you don't mind, madam Chair,
it's a very simple
um, it's, it's adding a couple
of things and I can
explain it really quickly
while we're waiting for the sub. And
then more questions could
be asked if you don't go ahead.
Thank you madam Chair. All it's
doing is we're, we're making a few
changes to
making an appropriation
and then on the very
back page is adding
in the appropriation.
So it's very simple uh,
changes on there.
>> Representative, why did you do a
sub if it's just small
changes, >> that was just the
prerogative of the
people that the
drafter, >> I'm trying
to figure out the Ryman
reason. >> There
is no rhyme and reason, madam
Chair. We're >> in >> this
roundhouse.
>> So, go ahead. Representative.
Thank, thank >> you
madam Chair. I would also like
to um
introduce, uh, Mr. Chad
Hami, um, who's
from Hagerman, New Mexico. He's
a volunteer firefighter, uh,
fire chief there
and uh is on the Ems
advisory board
and also in the audience,
Mr. uh madam Chair
is Kyle
Thornton.
Um, who for technical
questions, he's the Ems Bureau
chief.
May I just tell you a little
bit about the bill? Ok, thank you madam
Chair. Um Really
what we're creating is an
emergency medical
services fund.
Um, just like we have a
firefighter fund
and other funds for
our emergency services
across the State of New Mexico.
Uh, this bill would
direct uh $22
million
to the emerging emergency
medical services fund to
support Ems services
across the State.
Um The,
the sub actually
is delaying the start of
all of this. And
um so that's, that's what that does.
And then under under
funding of ems hinders
timely and effective care for
patients, especially in rural New
Mexico
um
across the State of New Mexico
madam Chair. We have,
we depend on EMS
services. Uh We
depend on them in pow, New
Mexico, Hagerman, New
Mexico, we also depend on in
Santa Fe Albuquerque,
Las Cruces across the whole
State. And um
in, in 2023 the
legislature passed Senate bill
491 which directed
10%
of the premium health
tax uh for
law enforcement protection
fund. And
so all
in a nutshell,
what we would like to do
is take some of
that funding from
the health care
premium tax
insurance and put
it towards something that also
is included in health care
across the State of New
Mexico.
Um Would you like to add
anything?
>> Yes, thank you madam, Chair and Members of
the Committee. My name
is Chad Hammill. I've been involved with the
EMS system for, well,
since about 1991 and
we've seen
multiple challenges with the
MS responses here in New
Mexico, the
lack of volunteerism,
the lack of funding, the
expense of equipment.
Um
and we're starting to see Ems
services that are actually
shutting their doors on New
Mexico
House, Cuba,
they've all closed their Ems doors
because of lack of funding and
personnel.
Um This funding would
really help secure
and help, um I
guess fortify Ems
in rural and
frontier communities
um here in New Mexico,
um which a lot of times
is the only health care
available to those citizens.
Um So we
um appreciate that
um that, that we brought
this bill forward and it would be the
first big
change
in
over 20 years.
Um to the Ems Fund
Act. So thank you for your
consideration madam
Chair.
>> I'd also like to add, uh madam
Chair that I, I just,
I was introduced to Chad this
morning. I said, boy, you look familiar.
So we started chatting
while our kids played
ball basketball against each
other. Uh, and,
and then we also served on school
boards, uh, where we
would meet at school board
association meetings
and things like that, but we
promised we wouldn't hold that against
each other and that we're on the same
team. So I just
thought it was a real kind of
neat experience and
was happy to see
him.
>> We do have the sub. Did you
have more um
explanation or
are you ready for public comment?
>> We're >> ready >> for public comment.
>> Thank you for your brevity.
Much appreciated.
Um So is there anyone
here in
opposition?
Anyone on Zoom
in
opposition?
Yeah. No.
Ok. Is there anyone here
in support?
Ok. Uh Please
just come forward
and then if you're on Zoom and want to
speak in support, please raise
your hand. Go ahead,
sir,
>> 20 years.
And obviously we
know that
everything else, the prices have
risen
and the the funding is
not kept up. And
to Chief Hamil's point,
even in my community where I
serve on, on a city
council, we are
losing our rural providers
that's putting a burden back
on our community
where we're taking services
out of our community and having to
reach out into the county
to make these calls. This,
this funding is critical
to the sustainability
of the MS in our community
and most especially in our rural
and frontier areas. I urge
your support. Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam, Chair Members of the
Committee, Randy Varela, State
Fire Marshal. State Farm
Marshals also supports this bill.
We believe that it is important
that we get more money for ems
services in New Mexico.
As Chief Hami mentioned
earlier, we're losing volunteers,
the State and funding.
I think it is important because
some farmers are depleting
their funds within a few months,
2.9 million for the
emergency service is very
low. So we do support this
bill and we urge that you also support it.
Thank
you.
>> We do have someone on
Zoom. I'm not sure
if they're in opposition or
support but
TJ, go
ahead.
>> Yes, ma'am. This is TJ
Kathy, the fire chief at Palla
Fire Department. I'm
also the president-elect
for the New Mexico
Fire Chiefs Association Board
of Directors. And
I've also been given authority
from the six volunteer
agencies that help serve our
community to show
support for this much-needed bill.
Thank
>> you.
Thank you all.
Um Are there any further
comments or are you ready to go to
questions? >> Thank you
madam Chair. I just want
to make one other comment that
I heard a, a review
on the news the other day where New
Mexico is number one in
911 calls
uh across the
US.
So these are the people
that are answering our 911
calls and going to the
aid of, of people of New
Mexico. So we urge
your support and we stand for
questions,
>> Representative Kate
Vincent
Chavez.
>> Thank you madam Chair and,
and thank you uh presenters.
Can you um
ex
so how do we currently
fund these services?
Is it a tax
that? So this is
how I understand this. This
is a tax up to 10
percent for
insurance
premiums.
>> Thank you, madam Chair. I'd like
to defer to the
to um Kyle
Thornton in the audience
if I could please,
madam
Chair.
>> Uh I am Kyle Thornton. I'm the
uh from the Department of Health Mercy
Medical Systems Bureau.
Um Madam Chair
representative,
currently the Ems
Fund is actually funded
um out of
the department of Health
budget, there is no appropriation
or, or any kind of tax.
Currently,
um This bill
proposes that
a new tax um
is put on
the premium health
insurance
and that
funding then would
bolster and be put
into the Ems
Fund.
Um
>> Thank you madam Chair.
I
um
>> madam just real
quickly. Um It wouldn't be
a new tax. We
already get the tax.
We already are taxing the premium
health care fund. It would be
taking a percentage of
that tax to go
into the fund. Just a
clarification. >> Thank
you madam Chair and thank you very much
representative for, for
clarifying that. I mean,
I um
wholeheartedly
understand the
importance
um of
uh this labor
sector and, and, and I
want to fund it,
but the idea of
additional taxes
on an already
insurance premiums
did not sell
sound good at all to
me. So thank you for your
clarification. Let's say that one
more time. We are currently
already collecting this tax.
We're gonna take up to
10% of
the tax we are currently
collecting and be able
to funnel it into
these emergency services
so that we can
especially in rural
New Mexico, but all
New Mexico be able to
keep our men
and women safe. And so
thank you. Thank you for that
clarification.
>> Thank you madam Chair and,
and uh just a quick response,
I wouldn't be carrying this bill if it was a
new
tax.
>> Next. We have Representative
Vincent. >> Thank you
madam Chair and thank you
representative and I'm
proud to be on this Legislation
with you and
Chief Hamel. Good to see you,
buddy. Um
I, this is like a family
reunion for me
and my family is in the
house.
So I can't believe you
guys are still fighting
this.
I've been retired now for nine
years and I just
want to give you an example
of how underfunded
because I knew that this was
coming up and I just
want to take three
different. So when you're,
when you call 911,
somebody's day has
gone horribly
bad
and you want
a response?
You just heard Chief Hammill say
33
places have
no services. Now,
if you call 911,
you are not getting,
you're not gonna get no
help.
So
just think about that
and I, I just wanna
push this across the
line. You have
somebody that has an
anaphylactic reaction which
is, um, you know, they
eat some peanuts
and um,
they're not breathing or
they can't breathe and you
get to sit there and watch your family
member until either you
can get them the hospital
because an ambulance is not
coming.
And rem a
reminder,
70%
of all the first
responders in New
Mexico are
volunteers.
They volunteer their
services, they volunteer their
time.
I pulled up Dexter
because Dexter's right
there next to Chief
Hamels uh
area.
The current Ems Fund
Act
distribution
$7500
7500
dollars. We're used to talking about
millions or,
or even billions.
This is
$7500.
Their annual operating
budget is
$35,000.
They're upside
down
and I'm gonna ask you a
few questions here in a minute. I just want to
punch this through
um
Las
Cruces.
They get
$25,000
annual operating cost
$12
million.
Tell me that's not upside
down.
Per tali.
15,000
is what they get from the
State
operating budget. 2 million,
2.3
million
when you get ready to
buy an ambulance
chief, Hamil uh madam
Chair, what, what's a new ambulance
costing you guys these
days?
>> Um Madam Chairman
um representative
I just, um,
encumbered some money to
purchase an ambulance and it was
$480,000
for an ambulance
if you can get it. And it,
it's two year build out
time. Thank
you.
>> And I would just almost
madam Chair. I just almost say
that that's not a very fancy
ambulance.
Um,
I can't even imagine now
what your cardiac monitors
are costing. Can
you give me an example of what a car
cardiac monitor
cost,
>> madam, Chairman
representative. Um
we just purchased one of those. It was
$36,000
for the cardiac monitor,
>> 36,000
and you
or probably like Dexter, you're
getting
$7500
and a cardiac monitor costs
$35,000
or upside
down.
And you guys
madam Chair, you all know how am
as far as humanitarian stuff
goes and, and we're just upside
down in this and I, I was
kind of troubled.
Um I learned
that law
enforcement got a little piece of
this
and, and I'm not trying
to say, I mean, law
enforcement,
we have firemen so that
law enforcement have somebody to look
up to.
But I want to make
sure that why is our money
going to law enforcement
when it should be going to
ambulance services?
So I'm not gonna prolong
this. I just want to make an example
of how upside down
this ems fund is
and how important it is to get
you the funding that you
need and even the
funding
that you're asking
for. I thought
you should ask for more.
It's still not enough.
Thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank you. Next, I have
Representative
Chavez.
Thank you madam Chair. I
kind of just have one question.
Um If
you madam Chair
representative, if you look at the
fir on page
three under significant
issues, it raises a question
about
the
ability
um
for the legislature
to really
prioritize funding
away from private entities. And
for me that raises a question about
accountability.
So madam
Chair Representative is
there language and I have
to admit I have not read the
bill um or
the the substitute.
Um Is
there are there
requirements or what kind of
requirements are
delineated in
the bill or
elsewhere in terms
of accountability?
You know, we're sending State money
to a private entity.
Um How
are we able to account
for how those funds are spent?
>> Uh Madam Cheryll Defer to my
expert.
>> Thank you madam
Chair
representative. Um There
is um I
in the Statute for the
Ems um Fund Act,
it's how it's distributed.
You have to be
um part
of a
municipality, whether it's a
contract or it's the county.
It has the, they
have to be the fiscal
agent.
So elite
ambulance service AM R ambulance
service, the air uh
helicopters. They, they
can't get that unless they're
contracted through
the city of Roswell.
And then they get, they can apply
for Fund Act, but it has to be
for equipment
for that county. And
if that um
ambulance service leaves that
county, then that
equipment must stay in the county
and, and be distributed to the other
ems departments
in, in that
county. So this
fund act is for
municipalities and counties.
Um
>> Thank you, Representative
Herndon. Thank
you madam Chair and
madam pre madam
presenters.
So I want to go back
just to uh look
at two significant issues that
were raised in the fir
the first one did refer
to reporting requirements
and it states that currently there
are no reporting requirements
statutorily
required for the Ems
Fund. And it says this
represents a significant
issue with limited
legislative oversight
on how the substantial
funding increase
is used and how
communities are impacted.
So would you please respond to
that? >> I'll
defer to um
um mister
>> Thornton
and before you mov'e
the mic, be sure to talk
or you will be
sorry,
>> madam Chair representative
um The
as Chief
Hammill uh began
to explain,
there is
there are requirements
uh in the statute
and then the rule
um that was developed to
distribute the current
amount of money
that um the
recipients
must be responding
24 hours a
day to 911
calls. Um
They have to
let us know
and report
on the level that
they respond to
these calls with. Do they
have um
intermediates or basics
or first responder level
um licensed
caregivers when
they make application,
they apply and
tell us what they want
to spend the money for
upfront. And
at the end of the year,
if they haven't spent that
money, um,
which the vast
Majority spend it very
quickly. But if they
haven't, they have to explain
why. Um,
and if they can't
explain why they
do have to return
that funding. Um,
so there, there are
current standards that
the EMS agencies must
follow and
I'm sure if the
amount were to increase
like this,
um, the
statewide advisory would certainly
want to see
even more standards
applied to make sure that the
money is distributed
and spent appropriately.
>> So, thank you, madam Chair. Thank
you, Mr. Presenter. My
question to you. Is there an
audit if I
submit an application
and say I'm gonna spend it on
24
hour
Ems Services,
how do you know I did that?
Even if there's no money
left, if you don't
audit it, you just take the word
for it. And so that's
what I think this is, is
stating that the reporting
requirements, how is it
substantiated other
than they say? Well, that's what we
spend it for
>> madam Chair representative.
We do have a
fund, a coordinator that
visits these
entities and
does check how
they have spent the money and
how much they've spent
and all of those
aspects of the
reception of that funding.
So they, they,
they are followed up with
and, and we,
we try to assure as best we
can um that they
have spent the money as they said
they would. >> So
uh madam Chair, I
mean madam Chair and madam
presenter, my question
to you is, would
you consider you have to do
it here putting a
reporting requirement
uh to the legislature
on how the money is spent?
Particularly if they're
gonna be using this 10%
tax if the legislature
uh approves this
bill as it's presented.
>> Uh Madam madam
Chair and
representative,
all this is doing is
is creating more money into
the fund. There's already
reporting aspects
to the legislature
through doh.
Uh when we get our
presentation from, from
Doh ems
is under doh, it's
going to a State
entity. And
so this and there is
already uh
reporting
uh factors
inside of the
EMS.
>> OK. Thank you. And madam
Chair and madam presenter,
just one other item was
raised in the F I. If you
would mind addressing this,
it talks about
the, there has been a
lot of discussion today
about how
these the MS
services are underfunded.
But if we look at what has
been raised in the fir
it states that local
governments draw
on fund balances
uh based on taxes,
fees, enterprises
for services. And
at the end of fiscal year,
23 municipal
cash balances total
925.1
million while cash
balances for counties
total 1.41
billion. So my question
is why aren't these counties
and cities putting the
funding into
the,
into these uh Ems
services? So help us
understand what's happening
there.
>> Uh Madam Chair, I'd like to introduce
Alison Nichols, who can answer
that. Good >> morning madam,
Chair Members of the Committee, I'm Alison
Nichols policy director with the New
Mexico Municipal League.
Um to briefly address that
point. Um,
I think a few points.
First of all, some of these
rising cash balances have been
very recent just in the past
few years. Um, so,
you know, this certainly isn't,
isn't reflective of
the chronic underfunding of ems
that's been going on for 30 years.
Um, secondly, you know,
when we talk about fund balances
and I, I know the sy did
do a report on this, um,
looking at some of our small
communities, for example and saying
a community um
you know, like UIs or
Tatum has
um fund balances that
represent 90% of their
general fund operating budget.
Well, that might sound like a lot
in percentage terms,
but in absolute
terms, that's a very small amount of
money. I mean that might be
$200,000 right?
And we heard from Mr.
Hammill ambulance costs
$480,000.
So yes, they May
have some fund balances saved up
over a couple of years.
But you know, when you're talking
about addressing infrastructure
needs, water buying
ambulances, other public
safety needs, that
money goes
very, very
quickly
>> and just for one clarification.
Um madam Chair
and, and
madam
Alison Nicholson. Thank
you. Are you saying that
the statements in here about
the total balances that
are reported by D FA
in these counties and the cities
are incorrect
even if they just occurred
recently? Are you saying they're incorrect?
>> No madam Chair, I I don't
believe they're incorrect. I mean, without
specifically looking at the list, I, I
couldn't really say, but I don't think
they're incorrect.
I think I'm just pointing out
that um, in
absolute terms,
you know, small
communities that have fund
balances that represent
even 100% of their
general fund operating budget.
In absolute terms, that
figure is still very small.
Um, you know, a community like
um hagerman,
they still have to spend the same
on an ambulance as the city of
Las Cruces. Um an
ambulance is 500,000
plus dollars
and you know, they're still competing with
the larger cities um
off of fund balances that
are in absolute
terms, fairly small.
>> The other point that I that I would
just bring up madam Chair and
representative is that
um specifically
rural New Mexico doesn't have
a lot of G RT
um income. And
unlike some of the larger
cities across the State of New
Mexico, but they're still
held to the same standard
for the, the kind
of equipment that they are required
to have in an ambulance
along with the medications
that are required in an ambulance.
So it, it is a
heavier burden on
smaller entities than it
possibly could be on larger
entities. And until,
unless I knew the percentages
that came out of
Albuquerque, Las Cruces and
Santa Fe,
you know, I, I don't know those
that, that sounds like a lot of money, but
it would be interesting to see the
breakout of that.
>> Thank you, madam Chair. Thank
you.
>> Yes, you did. I just need to make one
more statement because I need to
fill, I'll make it
quick, I promise.
So I, I wanted to
respond so that,
um, uh,
Representative Herndon understood
this. It's very
uncommon for
a municipality to buy a fire
truck or an ambulance.
It's usually State
funded
and, you know,
um, there's not
enough money, the, the, the
cities usually just don't have enough
money to fund those
vehicles. That's
the way it was whenever I was
there. Um
drugs because you
and I are on the same page on
drugs. That's
what they're having to do. They're having to buy
these drugs out of this, this money
that they're, that they're operating
on. And as far as the
reporting system,
they, they do have a statewide
reporting system, all
the calls that they run
will be in a reporting
system that goes straight to the
State and that
will have drugs
times uh
situation
and um
personnel. Thank
you, madam Chair. I appreciate that. Thank
you. >> So I
do have a few
questions. Do
I, I'm assuming um
that ambulances
that emergencies do
bill insurance,
Medicaid, etcetera, etcetera.
Can you just a
32nd explanation
of, of how that
works?
>> Sure. Um
Madam Chair.
So um
they do or they are allowed
to bill if they have APR C
certificate. So if it's a
certificated ambulance, they can
bill for reimbursement of
the call,
the, um,
reimbursement rate
right now at the State is,
is low and I know that we've
always tried to, to bring it
up or, or to, to
get that to increase.
But if we look at the payer mix
in each, um,
in each, uh,
municipality, you know, if you come
down to Chavis County,
look at our payer mix. We got
10% maybe that are
insured and then
we've got, you know, 50%
that might not be insured. And then we've
got uh
Medicaid. So,
and they don't pay the full amount of
the bill. So
that's for the certificate, ambulances.
However, the city of Roswald
is not fire department
or Rio Dozo
or
um the other
volunteer departments, their medical
rescues, they cannot bill.
There's no, there's no way they
can build to recuperate
that money that
they responded on. So if you go
to um
through Otero County
and you get into,
uh let's say Tularosa,
they, they call an ambulance
out of, out of
Alamogordo, but their fire
department ems responds
with a first
response vehicle that has a
monitor, um
has life saving
equipment on it.
Then they put
the patient in the ambulance, the ambulance
takes him to the
hospital, the ambulance
bills for that
run not the
volunteer department
that >> thank you
for that. And then on,
on the house
Committee analysis
report,
the taxation
and revenue department
states that this method
of funding like
programs like ems
is more expensive than
appropriating them from the
general fund, but it
May be more reliable
for the recipients. So,
based, I'm afraid that
folks are gonna start
saying, oh, we, you know,
we'll go after a specific
fund to make sure we get more
money instead of the general
fund and, and I don't
want to set a precedent that
we are, you know, that
programs that should be
funded and 100%
it should be funded,
but
out of the general fund as
opposed to
um to the
insurance tax.
And just out of curiosity,
do you know what
the um what the
money that you're taking
out of the health insurance
premium tax
fund has
been
funding?
>> I, I'll, I'll make a quick
comment, madam Chair. Um
that, that's
it goes into the general
fund. Um
And so I'm gonna let
Miss Nichols answer as >> well.
Thank you madam Chair. Yes.
So, um currently
the health insurance health insurance
premium tax revenues do go to the
general fund last
year 2023.
Um The legislature
directed 10%
of those health insurance premium
tax revenues to the law
enforcement protection fund. I believe
Representative Vincent mentioned
that. Um So,
you know, we thought that was a great
use of that funding
that um increased the
law enforcement protection fund
uh distributions by about 22
million. So this will be doing
and essentially the same thing.
So money is currently going to the
general fund, we'd be taking another
10% and directing it
towards the EMS
Fund. >> I, I
will just reiterate my
concern that that will be
kind of a workaround
that people start trying to
use to go in to
a different fund and
being that it's more expensive
to do it that way. I would like
to see it out of the general fund.
But, and then there's just one more
thing on the fir
on page three
under significant
issues. The private
Ems,
um,
privately owned EMS
services operating under the
American medical
response brand received
about 70,000 in
Ems Fund revenue in
2024.
If they received the same
amount in the E Ems
funding, it would be
um 444,000.
Um
So
how do we get around
funding a private
for profit?
Um
>> um Madam Chair, I might
defer a little bit to Mr. Hamel, but I think
as he mentioned, um
money is only going to a
private service as part of a
contract with a
county or municipality
for specific services
and those are reported
on and, and audited.
So I'll let Mr. Hammill confirm
that
Mr.
>> Madam Chairman. That is
correct. They, they have
to be tied to a fiscal
agent for the State of New
Mexico. So if Rossville Fire
Department, the city of Roswell
has a contract with
American medical Response
in the county, they can apply for the
Fund Act money, they can get the
award, they have to
purchase equipment
um that it will be
used in the, the the
system, the EMS system
in Chavis County. And if
that entity
um leaves as AM
R leaves, they split the contract,
everything that they have bought
with
um
fund act money has to
remain in the county
and that's goes back to the bureau
investigating or
inspecting uh, the
medical rescues and the
ambulances and, and the, the
rules that, that come with
spending that money.
>> And I just like to add madam
Chair really quickly. It's the same
thing as dot
dot spends State
money. They put out a
bid, private
entities bid on that.
And that's where some
of our State dollars go
in rural New Mexico. We
cannot afford to
have and, and, and
fund our own private
ambulance service.
So a lot of places
contract with a private
ambulance service that services
the community.
>> Thank you for that. Um I
have one more
and I it seems to have
floated away.
Um
oh, it was actually about capital
outlay. So, so
what is the, the mix
of buying equipment
for rural
areas um
for their capital? I mean, how
much is capital outlay and
how much is actually just
out of their general
fund?
>> Uh madam Chair? I, that's
funny you said something about that
because I just wrote that down. I
had a Katele
request
um for uh
Valencia County for
emergency medical
equipment. So I
I of course, I funded
that but I don't
know if
anyone has any other
comments
>> and, and the reason I'm asking this
question is because I'm concerned
that we are going to
kind of commingle not
commingle but things that should
be funded by capital outlay
and I know there's never enough,
2.5 million doesn't
go as far as it used to.
But I, I'm
concerned about using
funds that should be used
for services for
buying
equipment and,
and just if, if anybody
has an answer on, on
how that exactly works
or,
>> um, madam Chair speaking
for just the town of
Hagerman. Um,
we, they did, um,
put us on a capital outlay
plan, the fire department to
get a new ambulance because
$7500 was not
gonna buy a new ambulance.
Um But when they
put us at the top of that, that
the infants
infrastructure of
the water system and the water
wells and everything that just
started down the list. So we're
gonna find an ambulance.
Um but we're not going to be able to fund
this water program this year.
And, and I mean that, so
that's with,
with us securing this fund, we
can actually go to the
bank and say, hey, we're making
this much money guaranteed because
it's set by the State, the
maximum amount we're gonna
get or the minimum we're gonna get.
And we want to purchase this ambulance
on a five year note or a 10
year note, whatever it is, how
we do the, the the
fire trucks at this time or our
fire apparatus. Um
So that's the
speaking from experience with the
Capitol. Thank you. Thank >> you.
I will entertain a
motion.
>> Thank you madam Chair. I'd like to make a
motion for a due pass
please.
>> On >> the Committee
>> on this is a Committee sub
correct. So we need
to do not pass on
House Bill
>> 250 >> 258
and a do pass on health and
human services Committee substitute
for House >> Bill. Thank you madam
Chair. I'd like to for a do
not pass on
House Bill 258
and a due pass on the
Committee substitute.
>> Do I have a second?
I have a second. Representative
Kate, go ahead and take
the
roll.
>> Representative Kates.
Yes.
Representative
Chavez.
Yes.
What?
Representative
Jaramillo
Representative
Jones.
Yes.
Representative Vincent.
Yes,
madam vice Chair.
Yes, madam
Chair.
>> Yes.
By a vote of
let me do this
by a vote of 7 to 0.
You have a do
not pass
on, but I do pass on
the Committee substitute.
Thank you Committee
and I think I
hope we have time
for one last bill
288. It should be
very quick. So I
will hand off the gavel to
my very
capable vice
Chair and
present this
bill.
>> We are on house Bill
288 health
Professional loan
definitions
and we have representative
Chair uh Thompson
to explain the
bill >> and madam Chair. I
can promise we don't have a
lot of public
comment.
So basically what this
bill is and I'm carrying it for the
speaker is
to make a couple.
It's a very simple bill, make a
couple of uh changes
slash additions
to the health professional
loan repayment. It
expands the definition of
health professional
and it makes an appropriation.
So, um on
page one
line
23 it changes
podiatrist to podia
ARIC physician,
um which is
their what they've, what
they're known as
now and then
um adding in social
worker and
other professional in an
allied health profession
as defined in the
Allied Health Student Loan for
Services Act. So it's
a loan repayment program
for health care providers.
Um There's a $10
million appropriation
and I do not know if it's
in HB two
because this kind of came to be late.
So that's pretty much what the
bill does, it expands. Who can
get loan repayments for
health
professionals?
>> We'll go to the audience
first. Is there
anyone who stands in
support of this bill?
Seeing no one will go
to the Zoom. Is there anyone
on Zoom who stands in
support?
So,
and I
see only one person in the
audience and do you stand in
opposition of this
bill?
No, he does not. So we'll
go to Zoom. Is there
anyone who sends in
opposition?
Send no one in opposition?
We'll go to the Committee
Committee. Are there any
questions? >> Uh Madam
Chair, I'd like to make a motion for
a due pass.
>> We have a motion for a due
pass and it's been seconded.
Uh It's been made
by Representative Ken
seconded by
Representative Chavez.
Um Will you please call the
roll.
>> That would be
Representative Kate.
Yes.
Representative
Chavez,
Representative
Jaramillo,
Representative Jones.
Yes.
Representative
Vincent
madam vice Chair,
madam Chair.
Yes.
>> So, uh madam
Chair by vote of 7 to
0. You have a due
pass,
>> right?
Big deal. Ok. We
are, we are adjourned.
We will meet at 830
on Monday morning in this
room. Thank you.
Have a good, have
a good whatever.
