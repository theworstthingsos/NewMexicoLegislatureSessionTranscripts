Good afternoon
everyone.
We are now ready
to hear public comment
on our first the the speaker
is Carol Peterson
allies for ed
advocacy so
please speak into the
Mike and you have 3
minutes and for those of you who
are chit chatting
behind me mum's
the
word.
I'm my son
John was born
at loveless in 1980
and diagnosed with autism
and other developmental
issues up prior
to DSM for
we've got to be part of the
nascent community
in were happily supported
by our parents
reaching
out.
People first where he was the
president arc of New Mexico
where he was a statewide
president he was a passionate
advocate in the creation of
the media waiver.
Later.
Mental illness began to set
in my
2015 he was seriously
mentally ill in
2018 he was
hospitalized
18 times
here in New Mexico.
Are we did not
receive maintaining full
service from the mental health
community
as a matter of fact they drugging
telly drooled and
sending home.
In March of
2019 he was
admitted to the New Mexico state
hospital and in
2004 hours he was
dead he was
38.
Twice in their records in the
last 2004 hours they
said he was
malingering
he was not malingering he
was dying.
They did not understand
his method of
communication they
accused him over and over
of making it all
up they did
not understand
that when he tried
to describe his feelings it
might be in terms of the visuals
from a video game
or slogans from a
commercial.
A doctor
I could
project the medical
director of U. N. M.
emergency services
psychiatric services
all told John that
if you wanted to get in that hospital
again he'd have to go out
and strangle people
we have his words
in a deposition.
This is not how you talk to
someone who takes
words literally
who obsesses about
them.
We found
many
professionals
social workers therapist
psychiatrist
group home staff
whatever who
were dedicated
who are caring
and who are ignorant
about developmental
disabilities.
We
strongly
feel that prior
to people being credentialed
they needed to be
educated
about developmental
disabilities
and how
many other stories but
we will wait for another
time the
services
one in 54 children
being diagnosed with autism
they're coming into the mental health
system like a freight
train and we are
not ready we
have work to do.
Thank
you.

empowerment program manager of
Planned Parenthood of the Rocky
Mountains.
Madam chair and members of the
committee my name is Kayla
herring I you see her

Of Planned Parenthood in New
Mexico

difficult to hear I know okay
so if you can either speak into

Madam chair and members of the
committee we are
planned to cares for
patients with SCI's
in HIV successful
work in
prevention.
And madam chair members of the
committee we
were unfortunately
unable to be joined today
by the department of health because
of those COVID concerns
however there presentation
is uploaded on the
website for
reference.
Planned parenthood in New Mexico
plays a huge role
in treating
patients
and
for HIV and
STI's in
New Mexico planned
parenthood has.
In New Mexico Planned Parenthood
has for health centers
across our state
including in Farmington New
Mexico
we find telehealth
through phone
and video systems
we provide texting
education as well as in
person and school
education and we
do community outreach across
our state.
Madam chair and members of the
community 2020
has been a very tough time
for many over the course
of the year but Planned
Parenthood has continued to serve
the community and its
patients in 2020
alone we served
14000
100 77
wholesaler visits there
are over 4000
chair
patients over
17000 FCA
yes provided over
2000 HIV
test provided
72 pep and
prep Services provided
and 32 STI
testing and telehealth
visits.
Madam chair and members of the
community S. Tyree S.
T. I. rates are increasing
in New Mexico and across
the country for
many who don't know we
are one of the highest we are
if with chlamydia in New
Mexico we rank
10 for
gonorrhea ranking New
Mexico in the country
we rank 11
and a shocking
shocking in the
country we ranked
second in civil
with.
Madam chair and members of
the community.
Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountain
values me we are
to meet patients
where they are
with meeting
patients of where they are
we use
generally mail
in yes services
for STI
screenings which include chlamydia
and gonorrhea
we do have telehealth services
to
server individuals within
the community as we all
know we are a large state
but without large state comes vero
rural areas such a small
town such as Pecos
and grant and
Farmington.
We do the test mail out
to individuals and
we respect we
do yes to mail out to
individuals.
And then have the mailing back
to so that they can receive their
tests the results
we also take
care into our patients
making sure that we use in
that patient's
gender such as he
heard him his
and they the.
We also make sure that we
do not reflect on
individuals appearance
based on male female
assuming that an individual
who me Representative now
would have a **** or an individual
who represents female may
have a **** we
also make sure
that
instead of using STDs
sexually transmitted disease
we don't continue at the
statement to a
sexually transmitted infections
remember with the disease an individual
can die and that's a statement that
comes with the disease and
infection can be
treated.
Planned Parenthood values
empowerment to patience understanding
their health and making decisions
that's right for them
Planned Parenthood offers many
services throughout our
agency 1 of them is
our HIV Department
which many planned parenthood's do
not have but we are lucky to
have part of the HIV
Department is our empowerment
program which includes
empower and Tina
power and power
was established in
1997 we
were the second program launched
by the CDC which is a
study done for
peers educating other peers
in the LGBT Q.
Q. plus community
and educating them on
HIV and STI
prevention throughout
the years and power
has a you can kept
their doors open the other 2
programs ended up closing their
doors after the study was
provided and our
continued opening their
doors and continue
providing services such
as the peer educating
other appears on HIV
prevention and just yet
prevention they continue
providing rapid HIV
testing such as
a leader which is
a fourth generation
yes with the
simple sample of blood we
can give a patient there
are resolved within 20
minutes also
there they can
detect anything that may have
happened within 15
days on anything that may have
happened in the last 14
days that particular test
will not detect we
also provide and
institutes which is a third
generation test which
can detect anything as early
as 5 weeks on
anything that may have happened in the
last 4 weeks it will not
detect with
that and power has
always kept their doors
open and even
during COVID and providing
condoms and lubrication
for individuals not just within
the LGBT community
community but the community
as a whole.
In 1998 we
also launched our teen empower
program teen empower
program is the only program
in the country that is
being launched right now it
is for L. G. B. T.
use between
the ages of 13 and
18 we talk
about HIV prevention
and FCF prevention about
sex that teens are about to
have we also
talk about sex within the
LGBT community that
normally would not be talked in
schools being that
everybody has sex differently
we also don't stop there
within our team and our
program we talk about
the program also that things
that are happening within an LGBTQ
plus live such
as coming out to your parents how
do you come out to your parents as being
gay bisexual
lesbian trans
or even non binary
we also talk about how to come
out to your followers students
your peers teachers
counselors we also
touch bases on how they
need to look for their
academics and how to
apply for colleges and what
colleges are best for them
being within the LGBTQ
plus
community.
Madam chair members of the
committee we would love to
share with you how decision
makers like yourself
can help in the work
to reduce STI
and HIV rates in
our state
the first at
category that we have include
state grants and
some ideas that we have
include
prepaid postage
on those mailed
STI testing kits that
Josh just told you
about
so that neither the patient
and for providers burdened
with the cost of mailing
Ezzell
to remind you those
kids are requested by a
patient who thinks that they
may need to
get tested and
then we mail it to
their home they do the test from
the comfort of their own home
wherever they're located in
New Mexico regardless
of if they are 5
miles from a place they
can get health care or 150
miles between is so
common in New
Mexico
by being able to pay
for that postage for
that patient where than
reducing another financial
barrier that New Mexicans
so often face when trying to
access care in our
state
another grant it would be
to increase infrastructure
to be able to expand
telehealth so
telehealth is an amazing option
that we find but it
relies on the
patient themselves having
access to internet
to reliable phones
which we know can be such a problem
especially in the rural
parts of our state so
we see this as a way to
and create equity
amongst the more rural and
urban components of our
state
next is a public awareness
campaign I don't
think that a lot of
people
are aware that STI
and HIV rates are on the
rise around the country
and even more so in
New Mexico
so what we want to
be able to do is to educate
people about the fact that that's
happening and to
provide them with options
for
at testing. In treatment
and options like that
Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains
is one of the most
trusted
providers in the state
and when we talk about
health care people listen to
us so we know
that Planned Parenthood would be a
very strong messenger in this
campaign and we
know that
for those who are most likely
to contract an STI and
most at risk of
slipping through the cracks of health
care that they listen to
Planned Parenthood when we
talk.
And we also believe that
it's critical to have grant
funding to provide
testing and treatment for
uninsured people
and that includes people who
may be undocumented
or any other can
thank concern like
that our
second I ask
is to increase
Medicaid reimbursement
rates for the
case that that tests
for syphilis and HIV
so this case that is
blood **** test
because that they have to test for
syphilis and HIV
the you can do from your own
home and the
Medicaid reimbursement rate
currently isn't anywhere
near the actual
cost of the case that
so if we could increase that
reimbursement rate to be
closer we
could really increase
access for
those
all across our state to be
able to get that critical
testing for
syphilis and HIV
as early as possible
because we know that increases
health outcomes for
New Mexicans
and our presentation
state it's very short
because unfortunately
one of our strongest collaborators
in this work the department of
health was unable to
join us however
we have lots of time
to take any questions that you
may have we
appreciate your your
comments CENIC we to
apologize it's
just an issue of concern
regarding health
and for me
I have to lower my mask so I can
hear you but that you
know how that goes
the the
I don't have a any because
I do. I
have 1 to
2 people I have
34.
I good
if you like of an auctioneer
Representative Thomson
Representative
Ferrary
Senator.
RTZ penal.
Representative
Senator.
Pinto anyone
else.
Senator Sedillo
Lopez okay let's
go ahead and get started
representative Thompson thank
you madam chair
so it's
a really set up and take
took notice when you said we are
second in incidence
of syphilis
and and that the
pretty much all the STI's
are on the
rise do you have a
sense of where that's
what what's going
on.
Madam chair and members
of the committee thank you so much for
that question it's a really important
one our
partners are strong
collaborators the department of
health would have a more
scientific
research based background
for why this is
happening but Josh
can share some experiences
that our own patients have had
and why this may be
happening.
Thank you for that question madam
chair and members of the committee
many working in public
health and working directly with the
patients there are many things that
have come into play
for being second
highest of
syphilis when we
went into shut down on March of
2020 that
cut off a lot of resources
for individuals who were
practicing on getting
tested on a regular
basis so
such as doing
testing in a bar going
to their medical health
provider going to health
centers a lot of
individuals believe that health centers
have closed a lot of as
because obviously we know that
been use such as bars
and restaurants close that would testing
would normally be available I by
community health partners
and also there is
that stigma
when going into a drug
store going into a superstore
and buying condoms
they were getting that stigma of
like why are you buying condoms
you should be staying at home you
shouldn't be doing this
as we know we're human beings
we.
Do we need that affection
we need that human interaction
it's a lot of individuals who are living
at home by themselves
or may have gone out
with friends to have that
interaction they were now
providing they were not
getting that in affection
and that human interaction in other
ways and
by doing that they were doing in
risky behavior maybe
meeting individuals on dating
apps something that they
normally may have not done so
the access to
normal testing access
to condoms
etcetera was not
easily available at that would have
been. Thank you
for that answer thank you madam chair
so how we're how we're
things looking in
those arenas
prior to COVID where we
hide they I mean has
comment made us
worse I mean it's obviously
made everything worse but
in terms of our ranking
of STI is have
you and our other states
I'm sure are
experiencing the same
things that you just talked about
so how how were
we doing before
comment.
Madam chair and
representative
the department of health
presentation which is
online has some really
helpful graphs about
the trajectory of
STI's and HIV
rates Josh
do you have some.
Thank you for that question madam
chair members of the
community
we would like to blame COVID
a lot for it but we
can't always explain comment
unfortunately we did
see a rise as over the years
you can see syphilis syphilis
we above the US
country lines so there's a country
line we happen to stay
under it in probably
in the seventies we did see a
little bit of an increase but not as
much as they
continue to go on
within the last several
years we did see an
increase and we
actually went above the
average is just that we didn't
stay below that line
I think it's really
my personal opinion it's
maybe not understanding Health
syphilis works how may be
some of the STI's work
and that is really where
education comes into
effect with that with a
lot of people don't understand
that syphilis is very much like chicken
pox of chickenpox
where and as
TI
anybody who has gotten chicken pox
it leaves a footprint in your blood
so we were to ever yes anybody
who's received chicken pox you would
test positive for chicken
pox and syphilis is
very much the same way
if you were to test somebody who had tested
positive for syphilis in the
past and has already been
treated they will test
positive for syphilis
and it just goes it to show
that they can never get a
rapid test for civil as they are
available but that test will
always come back positive
so it goes into a little bit
more details of having
to send that lapse
bees and then looking at at which
patients tighter
if the patient has gone up
to full full full
tighter the been re
infected if they have not they
have not been re infected and
then treatment is also going to be
determined on that there's the
early stages of syphilis with
treatment would be 2 shots
one visit if they are
late stages of syphilis or if
they do not know when they caught
syphilis there would be
2 shots when
did that for 3
weeks.
Thank you for that
so you talked about the at
home testing and those are
both like finger finger
sticks I would
assume.
Madam chair members of the
committee
for
all other STI's
that are not syphilis
and HIV
it is a urine test or a
swab yes
and then for
HIV and syphilis
except blood ****
consent okay thank
you for that thank you for your answers
and thank you for your
presentation thank you
madam chair thank you
the next person on my list
is Representative
Ferrary.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you.
Panel Josh
and
Kayla
I
working with the department of
health
here.
Cohorts in crime I
guess.
They asked
if I would carry the bill
SB 184
and I'm sorry I can't remember who some
of up my
colleagues as co sponsors
were but
it was for relating
to
congenital syphilis and
infants and
requiring physicians
to you know even though
secretary of
comical and took 9 and
2020 you know
ask for this and made a
proclamation or
border
physicians just weren't
doing it and so
it was requiring physicians to
test the pregnant woman
Persepolis
pursuant to
CDC guidelines
where they would
get.
Tested.
Twice with
C. 3 times total
at the pride at the first
prenatal visit again
during the third trimester
and then again at
delivery
if they were at high
risk and sounds
like New Mexico is pretty high
risk for
number 2 is that
correct.
Madam chair and representative
yes
thank you and thank you madam chair
so
the reason this is
so important especially for
pregnant women is that it can
lead to serious birth
defects and infant
death.
And it's entirely
preventable with this
timely testing and
reporting and
treatment of the
pregnant mother
so
the reason and the
high trajectory you're talking
about in
2017
a syphilis has
increased
from just 6 cases
and 2017 to
alarming 26 cases
in 2019
so
that's why this is going to be so
important and I'm glad
you brought up
madam chair and
Josh and Kayla the
fact that we need to also
make it so that it's
Medicaid reimbursable
since we do have such a
high number
of
people depending on
Medicaid so
do you have any other remarks
about that.
Madam chair and representative
thank you so much
for working
on that legislation
and for bringing awareness
to congenital
syphilis
we know that
at as Josh just
explained about the
foot print that syphilis
leaves in your
blood and
that it's
such a risk with
pregnancy we know
that the general public
probably doesn't have all of
that information that we ought to
shared here and so
that's why we believe
of public education
campaign will be critical
and the reduction
and prevention of
syphilis HIV and
all other STI's
so that we can share this information
about what to do if you're
pregnant how to be aware
of potential warning
signs as you
said you are pregnant
people would get tested
at the first visit and the
third and there's a lot of
time between those
so pregnant people
can do a a lot on
their own if they have that
education about
syphilis to prevented
or look out for warning
signs and
so thank you
for bringing that up and that just
really amplifies
the need to educate our
communities across
New Mexico especially
those that don't have
as easy of access
to health care
facility about
STI's including
syphilis and HIV so
thank you.
Sure madam chair
and.
Caleb Kayla and
Josh I think it's also
going to be important that
physicians and family
practitioners understand
how important this
is
to not just do the initial
but then also the in the
third trimester maybe
even at
at birth to make sure that we
can.
Event infants
infant mortality as well
as for the
mother so thank you
that's all madam chair.
Thank you on a
point of clarification
Josh you were talking
about.
Of.
Wait what are you talking
about you're talking
about.
Hold on that
government I mean
excuse
me.
Happen prep.
What's the progress and the
clarification I you talk
so fast I didn't understand
you.
Thank you madam chair and members
of the community that is a great
question what is prep
and pep prep
is a medication
and the way that I like
to.
Describe it it's very similar to
birth birth control
Representative medication that came out
in 2012 the
medication that anybody can
take its appeal
you take once a day
and it prevents you from getting
HIV since
the medication has been out since
2012 there has
been only a handful
of cases of individuals
who have gotten HIV
while taking the medication
correctly and it's due
to the medication can not
fight that type of
H. ID that
was attacking their I mean
system so
we highly suggest and it's
one of the things that we offer here
at Planned Parenthood at any of our
health centers across
all of our agency that
anybody can get on the
prep medication.
PEF services I
like to describe is very similar
to like plan
B. prep Services
is somebody who has been
exposed to HIV
or believe that they may have
come in contact to
somebody who is HIV positive
and is detectable
they can get on perhaps
services within 70 2:00
hours if the
medication that they do have to
take with them for 30 days
and we have found that
individuals have not got an
HIV while taking
prep Services and taking the
medication correctly for 30
days.
Thank you for that clarification
and
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino you
on here you
go.
Thank you madam chairman and and
thank you both for your
for your presentation
I understand this is the first time
Planned Parenthood
has made a presentation
to the legislative interim
committee so
we congratulate you for
your being
at the
pioneers in in re
sharing information
I'm.
I guess I'm and
and some of it may be
because of the masks and so
on but I may ask you questions
that you've covered the
answers are already there but I
I didn't get
him does
the department of health do
testing for sexually
transmitted diseases as
well.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you members of the community that
is a great question
Department of Health does provide
um services to the
community they provide
syphilis chlamydia gonorrhea
and HIV
some of the services that they do offer
the offer it at all of their
services Monday through
Friday but they
also which is
currently on hold they do
offer immense night which is an
after hours clinic
and they also offer transgender
wellness night for
individuals who is transgender
and the men's side is for men
who are having sex with men
and they do tests for chlamydia
gonorrhea syphilis and
HIV and they also treat
individuals for free for
if they come in contact to any of
us so
madam chairman and and
the presenters
then your
services the ones you do
via mail.
Simply is a is
a.
The supplement or complement
to what the health
department is doing
and it
provides.
More anonymity in in in
the reception of the service is that
what you you do what
they also do.
Madam chair and members of the
committee yes there are
multiple organizations
that provide community health work
in Planned Parenthood is
a strong partner of the
department of health in that
work
and still we have a need
across our state to
increase the
availability of testing and
care for patients
and and so as
a follow up then it
from your experience in
all of those rankings are
distressing that we're that we
rank so high
in syphilis and
gonorrhea and chlamydia all
of those.
It.
What do you what
what additional
steps.
We to be considering
taking as
legislators to
make those rankings come
down do we do
we need to.
Have more money in it to
more services
what kind of Sir what will
it take to bring those rankings
down.
Madam chair and members of the
committee we feel very
strongly that
something like a prevention
campaign a public awareness
campaign would be really
strong in this
work to
reduce and prevent
the STI's
including syphilis and
HIV
we also believe that there are
some requests that we see
at grant opportunities
here like
grant to pay for that
postage on that mailing
kit
because we know that if we even
if we can mail it can out to
someone if they can't afford the
postage back then they may not
be able to complete that
test
we also believe that
infrastructure across our
state needs to be strengthened
because the best way to
reach communities
that don't have access
to a health care
provider in their community
is through phone
or video like we've learned
in COVID but
we have to have the infrastructure to
do so
and then we believe that a grant
to be able to cover
I'm testing and treatment for
those who are uninsured will be
critical in this work to reduce
those rates
and then I'll
want Medicaid
reimbursement rate increase
for the yes that
that at is a
blood **** test for syphilis
and HIV the
Medicaid reimbursement isn't
anywhere near the cost of
the cassette and so
raising that reimbursement would
allow
organizations like Planned
Parenthood like department of
health to do more of
those tests so
I'm it's covered by
Medicaid those
cassettes
but the
amount that they reimburse
you isn't it
enough to cover the full
cost.
Have you raise that issue with the
Medicaid division and
are they working on it
what what's the status
of the madam
chair and members of the committee that
is a great question that we
don't have the answer to at
this moment but we
can get it to you and
you you you think you've brought it
to their attention you just
don't know what the status is that
the case thank.
I'm.
Okay and is just so do you
get you don't
do you get anything for the actual
work that you do on the basis
just the purchase of the cassette
that Medicaid will
cover.
Madam chair members of the committee
I am not
completely sure of that answer
but we can get it to you
okay.
Well thank you for the work you're
doing.
With all the ads for
medications
and.
Every sort of
disease.
Including
schizophrenia son ed
for schizophrenia.
Education's the yield could serve
for any of the other day during the
Olympics.
It's it's it seems
to me that we need to have
some public education
campaign around STDs
as well and and
so.
It is just incomprehensible
to me that those TV as work
I mean I'm not sure who
watches the thing about
schizophrenia and is
in.
Careful enough or in
full enough control of
their faculties
to be able to go out and then order the
medicine
but.
Never the less they
wouldn't be doing it if it didn't work
I guess it would be spending the money
so let's spend some
money on a public
education campaign
utilizing all the social
media and television that we can
I think it makes sense
because the cost to the
state the the people of the
state is enormous from these
diseases and the threat
is as Representative
Ferrary pointed out to
to children being born is
is equally great.
So thank you madam
chairman.
Thank you
Senator the next person
on my list is
Senator Pinto followed
by Senator Sedillo Lopez
followed by Representative
Fajardo.
Thank you thank you madam chair members
of the committee thank you for the
work that you do.
Kind of reflecting on what
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino
was talking about this for
senator Penn to with all due
respect can you
either speak much louder
or we or move your
**** down thank
you.
The.
In respect to the
to set and the
testing.
I don't know how much knowledge you
have of the
universities through New
Mexico
that is it
available to all
students that are on
the college campuses
are would it very
depending on if they bought
student insurance
or if they were native American
if they had I. H. S. covering
to.
Of Madam chair
and senator
Josh has that
answer.
Madam chair members of the community
thank you for that question
it was asked if
testing or the because that's
the rapidly take because that's are available
to all students on UNM
campus.
There is the shock services that
are available on UNM campus and
they do offer a variety
of testing
they do offer rapid
on HIV testing and as
well as syphilis testing as well
so it is available
if they do go through their
insurance students
to get a discounted
right being a student if
they take their student ID
and then they can go through their parents
insurance or if they have
insurance such as the Medicaid
they can go through that
to madam chair members of the committee
so it's not free
they were there is some kind of co pay
that was probably.
In in
in the neck.
Madam chair members of the
community thank you that
is correct it is not free if
they were to get a full screening panel
at the shack they do you have to
go through insurance the
only services that are available
for free right now at
UNM campus is
the rapid HIV testing
that many organizations are
working with other community
members that are providing
including of Planned Parenthood
who provides rapid HIV
testing at the UNM
LGBT resource center
we offer it every
Tuesday for any
student or any individual who would
like to receive a for free rapid
HIV test
thank you madam chair members of the
committee do you have
any statistics are
data about
how
many.
I'm probably come in for
sexuallytransmitted.
Testing and
which led into
a possible rape or sexual
assault.
Madam chair and senator
that is a really great question
we don't currently have
information on that and I
think the department of
health would probably have a much
better answer there but we can
work to get that
after this
presentation.
And madam chair members of the committee
the data you're
presenting to it
is.
I think in a manner of
speaking we're not really
talking about specific
age groups are
is.
How would you categorize stage
groups as far as STD
I mean no you because we
know.
These children sexually abused
children can.
Have STDs
to and
up to what age and then
how do you guys group
the the the
age groups as far as when you're
collecting
data.
I'm madam chair
and senator that is
another really good question
I think I really wish
our partners that DH could be
here because they're so good
about scientific
data and research
we're more in the care
space so I don't have
an answer for that today
but again we can work with the O.
H. to get that answer
madam chair members of the committee
M. but when we
talk about them
pandemic in that
manner and
even after
you know if you are in a
relationship
that you know
there can be
times
that sexual assault occurs
and that rape occurs do
you know if there
are.
The.
Sexual assault nurse
examiners available
readily available are in
with in New Mexico if
we're in
shortage.
And madam
chair and senator
thank you that's a really good
question and we
at Planned Parenthood every person
who comes into contact
and our health centers with us
is screened for
instances of sexual
violence and we
do offer resources
including
seen as you mentioned the sexual
assault nurse examiners
I do believe that
as with every
I instance of
health care in New Mexico
we do have a shortage
of sexual assault nurse examiners
and our state and
so
I think that they are working as
hard as they can to cover
as many cases as they
can but again
that's another health care
need that we're facing in New
Mexico the
madam chair members of the
committee on when we
talk about a V. abuse
children that
the gonorrhea
and chlamydia infections
are you said we're like the
highest in our
state.
Madam chair members of the committee
we don't currently have
that break down by age
so I couldn't
specifically say like
which age category
would come
would be like
highest
however time parenthood
are mandatory reporters
and so if there
were a minor
to come in to one of our
health centers who had
contracted an
STI they
would we would be required to
report that and so it would
be held
with the department of
health.
Thank you madam chair and members of
the committee and the reason I
say that is because of the
native American population in
our children
within the area that
I.
Representative
that is one of the
issues especially
when our children
come in and
if there are signs
that they could be waiting
for 45 you know up
to now it just to get someone to
come in and conduct that
sort of
examination.
And it is time
is of the essence especially when
we talk about getting
to a prosecution
and actual prosecution and
getting these perpetrators
off or out
of the community
that it is essential
and advocacy in that
manner to is very
essential and
I'm not that.
That what you do to also
leads into these other areas
not that it's just unique
in itself.
And madam chair members of the
committee is
there.
After
the.
Same nurse comes in
if there was an
admin and Administration
of
up.
Treatment does that
require another nurse
are the specific
training for that nurse
to to
administer.
Madam chair members of the committee
thank you so much for that
question
one note is that that
C. O. H. for
presentation that's uploaded on
the website does have
some demographic breakdown
so and if that's not what you're
looking for we will we can
definitely work for that
too and
Josh can answer that
question.
Thank you for that question madam chair
and members of the community
when the state nurse does
come I
have one.
When if the
nurse does come in
and collect that
data if there were
any possible
screening with they do do screenings
for a full STI
at that time they will also
treat the individual and
have individual come back for
treatment as well
they do L. source for pep
Services and they do ask the
patient if they believe that with
if it's been within 70 2:00
hours if they do need
pep Services because
that 70 2:00 hours is very
crucial to get the patient
on the medication sometimes
unfortunately it's path of 70
2:00 hours when the
person deaths step forward and
let the individuals know that they
have been sexually assaulted
but the thing nurse
does make sure that their
full screening for all
S. T. eyes and they do
treat them for the screening and do
a follow up as well
so madam chair and members of
the committee so
the.
Senator outsource
whoever's.
Doing the
treatments is
probly specially
trained.
Of.
You madam chair
and senator yes
okay madam chair and members
of the committee I just want to clarify
that it's not just a regular
nurse that on
our end but that the reserves
have to receive additional
training in order
for us
to.
Tackle this issue thank you so
much thank you madam
chair members of the committee.
Thank you very much the next
person on the agenda
Senator said the
Lopez.
Thank you madam
chair.
I did you talk
about herpes and I missed
it
or because I'd
like to hear a little bit about
how you deal with herpes
and and what that you know the same kind
of conversation but I just didn't hear
you talk about herpes
madam chair and senator
we did not but
Josh has a lot of
rich information about
that.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the community I'm
fortunate we did not talk about
herpes and for purpose
is not really a talked very
much about it just yet
the reason for that is herpes
is very difficult to test
for we can only tell
somebody if they have an open
sore so we actually
have to swap the sort
directly if somebody
does not have a sore we can
not swab that for and test
for herpes without that.
So unfortunately without them
having an outbreak it's very
difficult to test
for herpes
individuals who do test for herpes
there is some medication that's
available I'm not too
familiar on that but we
do tell individuals who on
test positive for the difference
stages of surface of
herpes that they want
to keep their stress levels if they're
having an outbreak they do not want
to have intercourse with
anybody because
they can pass it on to their
partners.
Thank you madam chair so there's no
blood test for it as
well.
Thank you madam chair and members of the
community unfortunately
the blood tests the only thing that we
can test by 4 by
black is HIV and
syphilis and that is
why education is very
important to the community
because there's misinterpretations
that you can test for
herpes by blood like
I said on the only thing that we
keep the way that we can test for
herpes is by
if they have a outbreak
and we would yes the vote
for and then send that off
to the lapse.
Thank you madam chair that's that's really
informative the other question
that I had.
Has to do with his you
described
testing and testing for
individuals who may
not have access to health
insurance.
I have talked to
individuals without access to health
insurance about testing
they are reluctant to do that
because if they don't have health
insurance.
They say there's no point
and I try to counsel and
say well no because then it'll
change your
behaviors.
But but
it.
But I understand where they're coming
from like that you know
just because just like I I
know when was talking about even
getting a mammogram and
saying I don't want a mammogram because
if I had it there's nothing I could do about
it. And
so I think it's really
important to Google testing with
treatment.
What are your thoughts about that
and and I I understood
Pratt Planned Parenthood did
offer treatments I just like to hear
more about that.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee
we agree
we very often
are in communities like Josh
has said that bar
nights or other
type of the events doing
that testing
and we very often come
across people who
say I don't want to know I can't do
anything about it
and that is one of our asks
of you all
is to
create some type of
grant program to
provide testing and treatment
for those who
can't afford it themselves are
uninsured maybe they don't
have
documentation
status anything
like that because we
think as a health care
provider that no person
should live in fear
like I don't want to know what my
health concerns are because
there's nothing I can do about
it yes you want to
add.
Thank you madam chair and members of
the committee committee
I'm that is true we see
that very much they're
individuals who don't want to get
tested because that is another
cost added on
to a bird in
kind of because they can't
afford the copays
they can't afford the treatment
so it's very important for
services such as Planned Parenthood
that we offer
HIV STI testing
and treatment as well
because we need to make it affordable
to many individuals within
the community
especially
black individuals
they yes hi it's in
the community
because they're not maybe coming
in because maybe there's a stigma
attached to it
Latinas and Latinos are very
much of course
the the second highest and
it's because they're
undocumented it's
because they were
taught to very much
you just treated with the
mix and fund of fund equity
that on a and it's going to
go away
but that's not true and we need to make
sure that we're here to assist
them and we're here to help
them in planetary hood is able
to do that we're able to provide
them with the services and
they care that they need
and make it affordable or
make it free so that they know
their status we make sure
to tell individual that it's not
what your status is that the
important but it's about
knowing your status that's more
important.
Thank you I very much appreciate
that because I heard you say
testing even when they may
not have insurance
and I I think that
all of the requests
and everything you do has to offer
testing and treatment
because otherwise I think it's
it's it adds stress
to the community it's
pointless and increases
resistance
so I thought
your presentation was excellent
extremely informative and
thank you so much for the
work that that you do madam
chair. The
next person is representative
for
harmful.
You need a you need a
might.
Yeah.
No.
Eric out technology we love
it thank you guys
for coming thank you for the
presentation a quick question
earlier guys were talking about the
HIV medications what
was that both it called
again.
Madam chair members of the committee
there's Pat
if you have been exposed
and you want to
treated or potentially
and then Pratt is
in preparation for
that so it's a preventative
thank you madam chair thank you
and it's not monthly weekly
how often is that taken the
the preventive.
Thank you madam chair and members
of the community the
prep medication is taken
daily so the
reason why I usually
big described as birth
control no matter how you
identify sexually if
your a male female
this gate we all know
how birth control works
and for prep Services
it's very important to take it
daily the same time
and as long as you take it at the same time
every single day it
is preventing HIV
the statistics are out there it
can range anywhere from 96
to 98 percent of
preventing HIV
and like I have mentioned earlier
the medication has been out since
2012
and the cases
have been less than 10
individuals who have called
and HIV
while on the medication
and that is considering thousands
and billions of people are on this
medication currently
thank you and madam chair
is it covered by
insurance.
Thank you madam chair members of the
community prepped
is covered by some insurance
but not all insurances
there are 3 types of medication
that are out there there's provide
a disco we and
and no name brand
for about a so
based on your insurance
plan it will cover
it sometimes it doesn't cover
it we are lucky enough
that the makers
of legislative disco we do
have an assistance plan
but that still doesn't cover
your copays for the medical
visits and sometimes
doesn't cover all of the
medication where
individuals are still
having to pay out of
pocket for the
medication the
medication itself if you do
not use insurance or you're paying
out of pocket can
costs hundreds to
thousands of dollars just for
one month medication
thank you thank you madam chair and thank you for
that and you
actually
let me right into I was
asking these questions I have a
friend who is he
he was he takes it on a regular
basis and
I care the bill last session
actually Senator Ortiz of he
Pino he carried it on the
floor on the Senate floor
forming that
because what's happening is
you have these companies are
giving financial
assistance to take these
medications but
that it's not counting toward
their copay and a deductible
so the and they think
that they meet met their
deductible because these
companies are can help and
contribute and
then when they
meet that you know 1500
to $3000 raise
whatever it is
they're still have to pay that
extra 1500 to
3000 for these
medications
and so and that's one of the companies
that provide assistance
to people to for
their medications.
But yet we have insurance companies
who don't count that toward
their deductible
and so hopefully I'll be
carrying that bill again this the
session
but I just wanted
to ask those questions because
it it's all of all relates back
to it so thank you very much thank you
madam chair.
Thank you very much what an
excellent presentation
I learned a lot
about.
A lot of
stuff.
And in the words of the famous
comedian the best way to
avoid those insurance costs
just put a helmet on that
soldier.
I have a couple of.
Of the public service
announcements
first of all remember that
tomorrow more tomorrow
morning we reconvene
at 9.
We will not
meet in the afternoon
because of the
issues regarding comment
I'm making trying to make
sure that the public is aware
of that we will
have public comment
at 1215 before we
recess tomorrow.
And and that's important and the
other thing that I wanted to tell
you is that.
We have to there's gonna
be an announcement thanks to
carry for re telling
me of the
governor is going to make an announcement
today about
the use of the masks
again and the
very strict
regulations about
the COVID because it
is on the rise
so in this room you
must
wear your
masks
no glitter and
no.
And no
confetti those are
the rules of this room
so when I see you tomorrow
just make sure about that because
that side says that
yes.
Representative black
double coverage is
important both insects
and on your
face.
Some.
Double masking
yes some Adam chair if
I may add to
I know it's difficult to
hear through the
masks.
However since we're
sharing might
X.. My
further recommendation
would be yes.
To either continue
wearing the mask while we're
using the Mike's
because this is the perfect way
of transmitting any kind of
drummer bacteria.
Or if we
can.
Bring one piece
and
or disinfectant wipes I
guess and have them
at our site I know that there's
additional cost of all of
this but we
need to get in the practice of
doing that because
we have found that that's a high
transmission
because of the saliva and
everything else that goes with
using shared bikes
so that's just yeah
thank you I appreciate being allowed
to make that comment
I'm glad that you reiterated
that thank you so much
presenters thank you for
your very very
illuminating
presentation
and with that we're waiting
for our next group of
speakers they're
not here yet so you can
get up and stretch for a little
bit and
then will start the
next
presentation.
Alright talk amongst
yourselves.
Susan did you want to speak all
by yourself.
She just going to the restroom

be

Madam.
But earlier
the folder

correct.
Okay in in the reason
why for those as to
why we're not meeting tomorrow
afternoon did you state
that also

Thank you.
Thank you very much just reiterating
from my
bring.
Revenues.
My
other.
Thank you for
your.
Yeah

Mr chair what I may ask
just remind for some others who are
not here who
are tier earlier Dr
Scrase
secretary department of
health and Human Services
department has
disallowed from his staff
to be present in
person for committees
which is.
