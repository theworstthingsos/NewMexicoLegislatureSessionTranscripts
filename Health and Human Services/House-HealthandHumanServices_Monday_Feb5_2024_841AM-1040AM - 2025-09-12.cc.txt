Go ahead with your
Friday.
Sorry. No, I'm
just like, I don't know.
Um So we will

and
um
on our
home.
Oh yes, we need to call the
roll.
>> Representative Kates

Chavez here.
Representative Ferrari

Representative Sapanski
here,
Representative Vincent
here
madam vice Chair madam
Chair >> madam
madam vice Chair is
excuse's
excused
>> and madam Chair. >> I'm here.
Ok. Ok.
Now you can go ahead.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Thank
you for the opportunity to present
our amendment today on House
Bill 213
madam Chair. We're looking
at the 202
number
0.228003.
What point they have
a
second?
Oh,
I don't know.
>> Representative Chavez made the
motion to enter
the amendment. I second
it
>> good.
>> Go ahead.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
Um So, and
if you happen to have extra copies, my
cosponsor would appreciate
one but otherwise
amendment one
on page one
line
19
before the period we've
inserted making
and appro making
appropriations. Um
Madam Chair representative,
you May remember we discussed
sending money
um and appropriating money
to do research
on this policy, substance
use and alcohol harms and
specifically creating
a body of research and evaluation
um that centers on
indigenous and black and people of color
communities in New Mexico. So
that's why we have to amend
the title to making an
appropriations
amendment two. What
we are doing here is
striking um
the 2,000,008
$84,000
that would have kept the general
fund hold. So previously, as
introduced this, kept the general fund
hold. The amendment on page
two. does
uh strikes that um
appropriation
and then we go madam
Chair to page
13
of the bill.
Um Here is
where this is the section in
which we created the new
alcohol and substance use Harms
Alleviation Fund.
Um What we had done
previously, as we explained on
Friday was leave this
relatively blank so that we
could get your feedback and
insight and contributions as
to how to use
these revenues.
What the language as you see on
the amendment now
says
50% of the money
in the fund is subject to
appropriation by the legislature to
support and match
federal funds for the
State Medicaid program for
the purpose of providing alcohol
and substance use, harms, prevention,
treatment and recovery services
to individuals throughout New
Mexico. Um So
that's the piece where we leverage
these dollars to a much
bigger impact by
um by the
intervention of the Medicaid
program you'll then
see where our appropriation
is. Um, sending
$500,000
for the fiscal year 2027
to 2032
to the Indian Affairs Department,
um, to contract for the
research as we've shared
previously.
Uh, we then have some
report reporting
requirements to come back to the
appropriate legislative
committees.
We then go to the New Point
C 40% of
the money in the fund appropriated
to the local government division
of the Department of
Finance to make the
annual distributions to the
counties. Uh We've
updated the formula here as
we shared previously, the formula
used to be related
or based on
alcohol-related car
crashes. We've now
updated it to
include a, a
10 year average of
alcohol-related injuries
and deaths in each county.
Um The big piece
here is that
these funds that were previously
going to the counties used
to um revert
and that put them under immense pressure
to spend quickly and not often
on the programs um
that they really wanted to invest
in. So,
what we've done here is make
these um
distributions uh
nonreverting.
Um And, and on that point,
we're really proud that the
association of counties and their
local DW I affiliate Chair and
chairs. Um Now
stand in support of this because of
the work we've done to address their
concerns in full
support. Um And then
lastly, as we
discussed previously,
uh section subsection
D um holds
10% of the money or
or distributes that to the
Indian Affairs Department
so that they May
uh make the money available
to municipalities, counties,
Indians, nations, tribes, and
Pueblos for culturally
relevant, alcohol and substance
use disorder services
and programs for Native American
populations in New Mexico.
Um So we really after
conversations and consideration
that the, the Indian Affairs Department
was, was the most appropriate
body um to be
receiving that money and distributing
it back out accordingly.
So this would capture places like
Farmington that were
receiving a direct distribution,
but open it up to places like
Cibola and other counties
um who showed
a need to be doing culturally
relevant work to support indigenous
populations.
So that's our amendment madam
Chair.
OK. Are there questions >> on the
amendment
Representative Ferrari?
>> Thank you madam Chair.
Um
So in
your um
amendment
um in section
three B,
you are attributing
500,000
to um Indian
Affairs Department
and then
another 5
million in
section D
uh where you say 10%
will go to Indian Affairs
Department. Is there a reason
you have it in both places?
So that would be of
52 million,
approximately 5
million in section D plus
another 500,000,
which is great. We need all
the funding we
can. But I'm
just wondering why you're mentioning it
in two different places.
>> Um Madam Chair and
subsection B and
Representative the
500,000 is
um on a five year sunset.
So it would be
500,000 for five
years. Um You might
know it only begins
in the year 2027
because the Legislation
has a, a delayed
implementation date of one
year. So 2027
is when we would begin to see
data that we could
actually study on the
impacts of this tax
policy. But this
500,000 for five
years is to do the research
and evaluation on New
Mexico's um
specific
uh communities.
The other section is
for Indian Affairs. That's the
money that they would distribute
outwards to
municipalities, counties
and jurisdictions serving indigenous
populations. So that
could be places like Farmington
that already had the line item or
places like Bernalillo County
who shared with us that
80% of the folks
in their detox centers
um are indigenous
people, >> madam
Chair Representative
Pade. Um
I'm wondering
why we aren't just
asking
um
uh
HC A
to do
that because they
have or doh
because they have the
um capabilities with
epidemiologists.
Indian Affairs, doesn't
they can report
to them but they really don't
have the
researchers in
place. And to
do that would be duplicative
with um
those
epidemiologists and
doh
>> um madam Chair and
representative um
this, this funding
is not for the department itself
to to do the research, but rather
to contract with
an entity that has
expertise in doing equity
related research.
And um our idea
was that in the, the
Indian Affairs Department May have more
capacity, more contacts,
more understanding of how to
draft and administer an
RP that would
um that would allow
for the contracting of
an entity like
that.
>> Um Madam Chair and
representative I
disagree that, you know, just
going out for a contract
is not as
effective as reporting
and doing it through our own
epidemiology that's
already
uh should be collecting
that information.
Um Also madam
Chair,
um I
don't see where
Farmington is being
included to
continue their programs
because they do
have um
already set up
and this isn't to
destroy what we're
doing in our State. We need to build
up and add more.
But leaving out Farmington
for their um
uh program to
help people with inebriation
and get them off the streets
and into recovery
I think is detrimental
at this point.
Do you have a >> Yes,
thank you madam Chair. Thank you
representative. It is real
that Farmington and no other
municipality or jurisdiction
for decades now was
receiving over $20,000
a month. Um
The first time it was explained to
me, it took my breath away. It was
said that coming
out of that municipality
that this was a
program
to house drunk
Indians.
When you look back to the original
statutory language, it was a
program designed to
shelter Street inebriates.
So that added up to about
250,000 a year
understanding that there are
municipalities and counties that
are ready as Farmington
is trying to do to serve culturally
relevant programs
designed by and for indigenous
people. We've grown
that fund much beyond the
$250,000 in
current law to the
10% or approximately
$5 million
that will be available to
municipalities. So Farmington,
any other municipality like
Albuquerque potentially
um Espanola
potentially, but it's now
$5 million
available to
municipalities, counties
and Indian Nations
to administer culturally
relevant programming
for indigenous populations.
So Farmington,
if they um are ready
and it sounds like they are doing
culturally relevant program in
partnership with the
Navajo Nation,
they would have access to
much more than the 250,000
as would other
jurisdictions serving
indigenous
communities.
>> And madam Chair and
representative is
my understanding that the
local DW I
programs are going to
continue. They
don't have to
necessarily, they'll still
get the funding from D FA
but you're adding another
um barrier with the
DF with the, the
county uh
government having to then
disperse to the
LDWIS
>> madam Chair representative.
Um again, the association
of counties including
their local DW
A affiliates are now
in and, and were neutral
before. But as we've continued
to flush out this proposal with
their expertise in
leadership, address
their concerns with the underlying
law, they are standing in
full support of this. So
we actually based on what's
here, expect the,
the pot of money that
is um being
shared by the 33
counties will now
increase even
at the most conservative estimates.
So they'll be sharing a bigger pot of
money. And then of course, some
of those counties that serve indigenous
populations will have access to
the additional $5 million.
Um But it is
designed very similar to
how the, the money gets
to the programs.
Now it goes to
the Department of Finance Authority,
the local government division,
they apply the formula.
So we're updating it from
alcohol-related, crashes
to alcohol-related injuries and
deaths. So it's more encompassing
and then the money would get out
with the key um
amendments here being
that it's no longer reverting.
Um And that our hope and expectation
is that they could if that's what
they're seeking to do is
also used for capital
projects.
>> Um
I think it's just
reshuffling money
besides, you know,
taking out the general
fund of,
you're, you're not putting money into
the general fund, you're just adding
that to the
community
uh percentages.
Is that correct, madam
Chair >> madam,
Chair representative, um by
not keeping the general fund
whole and redirecting that
$25 million to
Medicaid. The
assumption here is
that, of course, then we grow
the value of that dollar.
So, um
as it stands today, our
State collects about $50
million in alcohol-related
taxes. The general
fund keeps half and then that
25 is split to the local
DW I grants by
striking what's in the general fund and
putting towards that towards
Medicaid that turns into
75 million. And
then we get to use the other 25
million split between the
counties and then the municipalities
and counties serving um
indigenous people. So
it grows from
25 million being
spent on these programs
today to a total of
100 million. So it's an increase
of $75
million. Um
based on these amendments,
>> madam Chair and
Representative I disagree.
You're counting the
batch from the federal funding
as growth and that's
really not, it's going
to help with the Medicaid
programs. Um
But that usually goes
through the HM OS and
treatment, you know, if
people, uh
you know, go into those
programs, but it's not
really going to expand
the amount of funding,
going to the local
community programs
in our State. Those are
pretty much staying the same
except by growing
the 2 million
that the
um uh
ad volum
of 23 and 4%
that you're proposing
ads.
Also my concerns.
Well, this isn't on the amendment.
Will madam Chair, will we be going
back to the bill
itself?
Ok.
Well, what
you're proposing as going,
you know, to these different things
is still a
little,
um, of
concern how it's going to
work, but also,
um,
deleting,
uh, the funds that would have
come and gone into these
programs from the
excise tax.
You're going to be giving that
funding that $50
million free
gratis to the
different distributors.
They do not, they will
not give that back
to the people or to the
um hold to the
retailers, they are going
to keep that funding.
And so we are just
gifting by not having
the excise tax
included in this bill
which we, you know, uh
try to have
amended on this
bill. It will make
it. So we are giving a
giveaway to the
alcohol industry,
$50 million.
Thank you madam Chair. That's
all.
>> Thank you. Um
Our analysts brought AAA
concern
in terms of just
um
that
um
that you, that the bee
that's on the
original.
Did you mean to strike
that or is this
be going
to be
um
at the end of that? It,
it just not
sure what to do with B on
page line
13
because it looks
like maybe it should be
struck
and then inserted what
you have in the
amendment or is it
coming after the,
is the amendment coming
after? What's there
already
>> madam
>> page 13.
If you look at your
um
amendment
number
three,
it says
on page 13 strike
line through 11 but then there's a
totally new b but there's
still a B here
madam >> Chair representative.
Um I,
I'm working to follow
that but I believe
that on the back of our amendment,
amendment four rele
the succeeding sub
subsection accordingly
um would change that to
ac
>> mm
I don't know that that's
exactly what, that's
not how I would read
it.
Um
So are you saying
that
the B in the amendment
should, should become
A B and the B
in the bill should become
AC? Ok. I
don't think that's very
clear.
She's saying that this
section B should become,
should be B and this
section should be
C
>> madam
Chair.
I think what that would do is
turn the
existing
section B
line page 13,
line 12. I think that would turn
that E
into
E
into
because the insertion
madam
Chair,
the in
the insertion
occurs at the end
of section
A
and then we're inserting
B
CD.
And so I believe that that
would turn the existing E
into
E. >> Ok. So that's
it.
Ok.
No.
Um
is this clear? I
mean,
do you think it's, it's clear
enough?
Ok.
All right, then never mind on
that. Um
So we will go to Representative
Kate.
>> Thank you madam Chair and
thank you again for
all your hard work
this past weekend and,
and support on that.
I just want to
clarify
your in your proposal in the
bill and the amendment.
Um You are
moving
the excise
tax 100
percent from the wholesale
level and,
and, and taxing
at the, at the retail level.
Is that correct
>> madam? Chair representative.
Yes.
>> So by removing
it and
not having it at the
retail level for our
local micro microbreweries.
Are you stating that our local
microbreweries will be
paying zero
taxes,
>> madam Chair representative, this
is on the bill. So just
um with your
nod and affirmative consent
madam Chair that I um
walk into this conversation
as it stands today,
the small
microbreweries, the m
the small winegrowers and the
small craft distillers
have a significant
differential in their tax
rates. So, while I
did not establish this policy,
what we did was follow that
differential in the wholesale
conversation we're having and then back to the
retail tax.
Um We, we
did not carry
um a tax
forward for those microbrewers.
Should their products be on
someone else's shelf, whether that be
at the gas station or the Albertson's
or a restaurant,
their products will be taxed
at the same level as
any other product. So 4%
for sper is 3% for wine,
2% for beer because
their product was purchased and put
on someone else's shelf.
Um But that component
of the bill was to carry
forward that significant
differential. They, they were basically
paying a nominal almost
minimal tax rate
by policy set
up in a previous
legislature.
>> No, and thank you madam Chair
and thank you so and,
and, and I very much
appreciate you as
the tax expert
in, in the room. And so I
do appreciate your guidance
on this. That's
just what I wanted to
clarify is that we
understand that we want to
support our local
businesses and our local
micro. That's
why this policy
was in place. But in your
proposal, they'll be
paying, they,
the companies themselves
were paying zero
amount of excise
tax.
>> Yes, madam Chair
representative.
>> Thank you. I very much
appreciate also the,
the II I hear
um
um I
hear the
priority and importance
um for how
you are
distributing the
funds equitably.
Um And I know
that I've had communication
from the Association of Counties
as well and they
have advocated that they
feel they know
what is
needed within their individual
counties more. And so I do
appreciate that and I, I
absolutely appreciate
that Medicaid match.
The Medicaid match is not
just um
I just want to clarify as
well. Medicaid match
could be as we are
building behavioral health
uh uh
facilities
for individuals
to seek treatment that are
on Medicaid within our
State. Correct,
>> madam Chair representative.
Yes
>> and, and thank you very
much. So, if we
remove the
Medicaid match
portion from your
proposal,
um you
are, is, is
your proposal collecting
more or less
taxes than
the current
tax structure right
now? Not compared to
any of the proposed
ones out there, but just the
current >> madam
Chair representative
without the Medicaid component
of this amendment.
Um It's expected on
conservative conservative
revenue and revenue
estimates and modeling
that we would have
just a nominal increase in
taxes collected. So
again, this isn't about
an increase in taxes. It's about
using our money with greater
impact. Thank
you. >> Thank
you very much. Um,
I, I,
uh, I, I
kindly and respectfully
disagree as in, I
do agree
that, um,
your, that,
that, that is part of what
this is about, but it's
also connecting
those direct funds to our
behavioral health programs
that have
been ignored for
so long And we have the
opportunity to do some
real investment. That
is my only concern with your
bill is that it
doesn't do enough.
But I
very much
um trust your guidance
on the distribution
and the
idea of equability
and, and local decision
making and, and thank you
very much for your
time.
>> So I am concerned
that it, we,
as we discussed in the,
the meeting that we had
whatever day that was
um
1000 years
ago, um
that the State really
needs more along the lines
of 250
million. So my
fear is that we're gonna
do this and then
we're not gonna be able to
raise any more money
with the taxes for
some years because this body
has a way of saying,
oh, we, you know, we just did
that. So is
there any way that you
can see that
you could get
more, more tax
money in for behavioral
health follow?
I mean, perhaps following some of
the, the um
wholesale some
just I'm worried that
it's not enough money. Well, we all
know it's not enough money
essentially.
>> Um Madam Chair representative
as it stands today, this
is the proposal we brought
forward based on the equity
conversations we've had and,
and being realistic
about not wanting to have those
tax burdens on our low income
families, families, navigating
poverty and substance use
independency. So
potentially a conversation we
can pick up in the future.
Um But for now,
this is the proposal that we
vetted, including with
the impacted entities like the
association of counties who now
stand in support. >> And then just
one more question is I AD
on board.
>> Um madam Chair representative,
we've had early representative
here has had early conversations with
I AD
and part of what we
of course would be looking to
do with, with both D
fa the local governments division
and I AD is making
sure they have the capacity
both um with
the the financial
resources that allow them
to staff up and make sure they could
implement that. So as
always, that's what we hear,
we feel like their appropriate body
and they're curious and
um have some interest and excitement
about it. We just need to make sure they have the
capacity to do it. >> All right.
Thank you. I will entertain a
motion
at Representative
>> Jones.
Thank you madam Chair
and thank you representatives.
Um So by
changing the liquor tax excise
tax from volume at
wholesale to
retail, how
do you know, um
how much money is going to be collected
in taxes,
>> madam Chair representative.
Um that's why our economists are
saying these um
estimates are very conservative
because they did not want to over
project or overinflate how much
revenue New Mexico would collect.
So the data we have today
of course, is based on the
wholesale um
purchase of alcohol.
We don't have a lot of data
ultimately on where it's
consumed. So the
biggest increases in revenue
in this bill is designed will come
from those that are doing on-site
consumption. It will come
from the bars and
restaurants where someone is
driving, having a
drink at a higher price point,
paying a higher tax
and then ultimately leaving the
establishment, it will
not be the same tax burden
on what we imagine to
be rural people who have
less options for being
out and about and for
folks that are buying lower
shelf alcohol
um because
that's what they can afford.
So the
potential
increases are
going to come from the people
consuming on site. We
just don't know enough yet to see
how high that number could go.
But the economist felt certain
that there would not be a drop in
revenue.
>> Ok. Thank you very much. Representative,
thank you madam
Chair
>> Sapanski.
>> Thank you. Thank you madam
Chair. Um
And thank you representatives for
bringing forward this
amendment.
Um I, I see,
I've been looking at the bill
and the amendment together
and I, I think
at its heart, what it's doing is
that it's accomplishing
three things that I
see. Um
And would love your
commentary on this, I
think number one,
it is
adjusting the
existing
tax burden to make it
progressive, changing
the way that
that tax is collected.
I think number two, it's,
it's adding some access
to health care benefits
um through the distribution
to Medicaid for
specifically substance
abuse programs.
Um And three, I see that
it's preserving some of the
economic development benefits
that the initial
uh tax structure I think
was, was attempting to
achieve.
Would you find that
accurate >> madam
Chair? Representative?
Yes.
>> Um
I, I think you've
been trying to thread a
really fine needle here
madam Chair and, and
representative and I
I appreciate that. I
I have a couple
of um suggestions
going forward. I I
echo some
of the comments of
my colleagues on this
Committee madam Chair in terms
of um
looking at
increasing
the tax to
address some of the
price sensitive
individuals
um that are, that are
born out in research,
um particularly youth.
Um I think
that's a, a
really important
consideration for this
Committee and, and for
the
and in grounding this
policy in
the actual research.
Um madam Chair and
representatives, I am
really pleased to
see that research will be conducted
so that we can understand
um what the, what
the impact of this will
be. Um
Number two, I would just
say uh
section C the new
section C on the the
back page of your
amendment, it doesn't
actually specify
what the money shall be
used. For.
And, um,
I, you know, to your earlier
point, madam Jared
and, uh,
Representative
Cadena,
I don't, I, I would hate
to
have this money distributed
and see it only used
for,
um,
I, I don't know, jail based
services or, or
something completely
unrelated. Um,
and I'm sure,
uh, you know, the counties have
been, uh,
very invested
in DW I prevention and
so I'm sure that's not their intention,
but as we know,
uh revenues can
go up and down and
in lean years, there May
be a real demand
to uh you
know, we've dealt with it at the State
State level madam Chair
with
uh different
lean years where we've
had to pull money out of some really
painful places.
And so
that, that, to me, I would
love to see
uh a direction for
that funding to be
toward
addressing substance abuse
pro broadly,
for, for me, I don't know that it
necessarily has to be specifically
alcohol because
multis substance use
is, is
uh it occurs
in the Majority
of people
who have difficulties with,
with substance use in
general.
Um So
I, but I would love to see
that as just
a just another way to
ensure that
um the funding is
not ending up
in places where
we didn't, we didn't envision
at this time.
But I want to thank you
for, for,
um you know, sitting
down and, and in good faith
trying to
uh
address some of the concerns
that the Committee raised on
Friday. And those are just a couple
of additional
suggestions. And if you'd like to
comment, representative,
>> only madam Chair that I thought you
said you had three and I caught
two
madam Chair representative.
So looking at the increasing
address,
>> no madam Chair
and representative I May have
misspoken but there were two
so uh
suggestions going
forward
>> and madam Chair representative,
good catch, I appreciate that
we were very clear in directing the language
in subsection B of the amendment
and we did not do so in
subsection C um
late night on Saturday.
So thank you for that catch
and should we mov'e forward?
That's something we would work
with the Association of counties
to focus in on
clarify. Thank you madam
Chair. Thank you,
>> Representative Vincent.
>> Thank you madam Chair. I just
have one real quick
question
since the memo was brought
forward. Does the restaurant
association, did they have, did you
contact them? Did they like
this or not madam Chair,
>> madam Chair representative, I've
had several conversations
with restaurant owners, fire owners as
well as the restaurant association
um as it
stands, it seems like they're still
watching and engaged
in the process, raising
some questions along the way but
not at this point, standing
in opposition or support just
watching and being engaged.
Thank you madam
Chair.
>> I will entertain
emotion.
>> Uh Madam Chair mov'e, we
adopt the amendment
to house bill
213
>> and the second
is there any opposition
to adopting the
amendment
seeing then you have an
adopted bill
and I
don't know what you
have.
Ok,
go ahead >> madam
Chair. I would mov'e a due pass
without recommendation on house
bill. 213 as
amended.
>> Ok. Will you
take the role
please?
>> Representative
>> Kate.
Yes and I'd like to explain my
vote
afterwards.
>> Representative Chavez.
Yes.
Representative
Ferrari.
Yes.
Representative.
Ok. Representative
Jaramillo.
Representative
Jones.
Yes.
Representative
Sapanski.
Yes,
Representative >> Vincent.
No
>> madam Chair.
Yes.
>> Yeah.
By a vote of 7
to 1, you have a due
pass without
recommendation
and representative
um Kes
and then Ferrari to
explain their votes
>> madam Chair.
I apologize. My
colleagues had to leave to go to
tax and rev but I
will stay.
>> It's that time of
year.
Go ahead. Representative Kate.
>> Thank you madam Chair
and thank you, Representative
um as as we
stated before, I have the
utmost trust on on this
group that is putting
together this new
structure.
It is, I am
um very
disappointed
that they're
not taking the
suggestions of being
able to
uh create a
larger pool of funds for
this behavioral health
program.
And um I
think that New
Mexico is
the loser uh
unless we are able to
mov'e forward on this, but I
do appreciate the hard work
in the in the structure that
was presented today. Thank
you.
>> Go ahead, Representative >> Ferrari. Thank
you madam Chair and
thank you, Representative
Paone. Um
I think it was
important to
include this
bill in the discussion
of how we
negotiate
somewhat of a hybrid
between keeping our
liquor excise tax
as it is now
and possibly
raising it a little bit
or having your point
of sale
um increase.
But it at the 23
and four cents per drink,
it is making it. So we
have
cheaper products
such as beer
and less expensive
distilled spirits,
not taxed at an
amount that will
deter underage
drinking as well as
excessive drinkers
from using those
products. And
we are also
not generating the funds
that need to go to help
those
um
constituents in
those uh
categories
of
overuse.
So,
by supporting this
going forward, I hope
when we, um,
contemplate what
the final bill will look
like that we could do a
hybrid of both
and raise the funding to
at least 200 million.
Um even though we're
not putting funds
into the general fund
that's only
increasing by
25 million
of the program
money that is so desperately
needed. And
so I would
ask that by
having this gesture of
having this go through
with no recommendation
that the tax Committee
understands that
we are concerned
about a lot of the issues in
this bill, but
how to, uh,
blend or to
put together, uh,
the excise
tax that we have now,
so that we at least have
microbrewers contributing
a little bit less
than a penny in most cases
for microbrewers. And
if they sell according
to your bill on their
premises, they will
continue not to pay
anything at all.
So we,
um, we need
to contemplate
the overall
um importance of this
issue to our State as
far above
other states with
our
fatalities year after
year. And how do we
support the people
who need the um
programs and
the support the wraparound
services
that you talk about
as an equitable
means of
addressing this issue.
So thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank you um
Representative Pothan, since
you're here. Do you
want um
I know I I announced
earlier that we are rolling
304, but I'm
in touch with Rep
Chandler asking her
about 268. Let
me
um
So why don't you go ahead with
your, with your
289
but not
Marshall,
you have my
permission.
So we are, we are
skipping ahead to house
Bill 289
LGBT Q
healthcare training.
Go ahead,
representative
>> madam Chair and
Members of the Committee
before you is a bill to
appropriate $250,000
to the Department of Health.
And this bill is
to do two things.
One, the funding will be
used for the Department of Health to
contract with community
partners to offer
training to health care
providers and their staff
on how to be more affirming
and supportive of their
LGBT Q
patients.
Number two, the funding
will help the Department of Health
to contract with community-based
organizations to
deliver crucial
life-changing public health
messaging specifically
around ST I and
HIV prevention,
especially to communities
that have that they already
have existing and trusting
relationships with
what we know is that
LGBT Q people
face vast inequities
in health care outcomes.
In fact, the Kaiser Family
Foundation says
that over 90% of
LGBT Q people
nationally have seen a
doctor in the last two
years, but only
60% of LGBT
Q people have had a regular
checkup or preventative
health visit in the last
two years and in
the realm of HIV prevention,
the CDC says that only
15% of
people who could actually benefit
from taking prep
for HIV prevention
are currently taking it.
And in New Mexico, 71%
of people taking prep
are white men. We
can do better and we know that
the Department of Health wants to
do better. We can all
agree that LGBT Q,
New Mexicans deserve access to
affirming health care that treats us with
dignity. My
expert today with
me is uh
Marshall Martinez, the Executive
director of Equality, New Mexico.
I'll pass it to him to introduce
this bill as
well.
>> I'm scared of these mics.
Good morning, madam.
Good morning madam, Chair Members of the
Committee. I'm Marshall Martinez. I'm the
Executive director of Equality, New
Mexico. And
um, when I
was 16 years old, I
got my first physical
from a primary care physician
in my hometown. And in the
course of that physical, the
physician told me two things,
one that gay people were
not real and two that I was
going to contract A I Ds and
die.
Um Fast
forward to roughly
seven years later when I went
to the emergency room with
severe appendicitis,
thankful to a
boss of mine who refused
to allow me to just
work through it, but rather
ushered me and then called my
father to drag me to the
emergency room.
Um And the reason for
that is because after having a frankly
horrible encounter with the,
with a primary care physician, I
didn't trust the medical system and
I didn't want to go back.
What we know is that the vast
Majority of health care providers
in New Mexico and across the country
don't intend to be
insulting, offensive or
harmful to LGBT Q people
or frankly, anyone, many
of them just don't have the
training, the knowledge,
the vocabulary to be a
welcoming space. What
we're hoping for with this appropriation
is to create a program where
providers who
want to see
LGBT Q patients
and want to engage in
that training can do
so and that this
appropriation would help us build
out a program that is
truly statewide rather than
focused in
Albuquerque, Santa Fe or
Las Cruces where the resources
exist.
>> Thank you madam Chair. We stand for
questions.
>> OK. Let's go to the
audience. If there's anyone
on Zoom who wants to
speak in opposition,
please raise your hand
and we'll come back to you
in the audience. Is there
anyone in
opposition
seeing no hands?
Is there anyone on
Zoom?
Oh, ok.
So we will go to
support. If you are
on Zoom in support,
please raise your hand and we'll go
to the room first. So
in the room, um
if you are in support, raise
your hand,
please
and do either of you
want to make a comment?
No. OK. All
right. We, we will
go to the Committee
representative
Vincent.
OK. Representative
Lord,
>> don't.
Thank you madam Chair.
Uh Thank you Roberson. I'm
sorry, what was your name again? Our expert
over there? Thank
you. >> My name
is Marshall
Martinez.
>> So Marshall, I want to personally
apologize that anybody would
say that to you. That's such a horrible
thing to say. It
really is. And when you said it was like,
what, why in this day and
age? So before
asking questions, because I do have some questions
on this. I just want to say it's
very interesting madam Chair because
my parents were lesbians
and it's almost seems
like we've gone backwards
somehow since then. I
don't, I mean they were
ostracized.
But yet what I loved
about my one adoptive
mom, she,
um,
she was a doctor and she was
very strong. So I remember when
we go to buy a car or
anything, they'd say come
back with your husband and she'd say
go to hell, I, I
can make my own decisions. I'm a very
strong one. So she really stood up and kind of
paved the way.
Um, but
then I hear these things, I'm like, how are
we so far along
since then? She was born
1919 and
how we so far along? But it
seems like it's still
the same in some ways anyways. I
just wanted to make that point that
I apologize. Somebody would say that to
you because,
and you're in the health profession, you
should know better. And that's
why I'm wondering why we have to, why
would we have to mandate things? It should just
be, you should know better. You took an
oath, right?
Anyways. So, off topic
on that. So, um,
madam Chair and Representative
expert, can you explain
to like, what kind of training are they
going to get? Are, can
you just kind of briefly explain to me that what
the training would look like?
>> Thank you, madam Chair representative.
Um So first, I just wanted to
clarify, the trainings will not be
mandatory. Um
This is, this funding is to
provide the option for that.
And the Department of Health would then
contract with an entity, a
community organization
to provide the training. Uh My
expert witness um from
EQ and M New Mexico can
explain a little bit about what's in the
trainings.
>> Yeah. Thank you madam Chair
and Representative. Um And
so this training would
look generally we
hope like explaining
vocabulary, right?
Explaining the difference between sexual
orientation and gender identity
for folks. And there's just sort
of framing for health care
providers, what it's like
to be a queer trans
person in this world and why
we May be intimidated or
nervous to come in to a
doctor's office
and just give them an opportunity
to find to
express empathy,
teach folks how to express
empathy to their patients
so that their patients feel
comfortable. I also
want to point out that the
New Mexico Primary Care
Association supports
this this
appropriation. And our
hope is that the Department
of Health would work with the Primary Care
Association as well
as other LGBT Q
specific organizations to
deliver the training. >> I
hate to do this but two
hands popped
up.
So we're going to go to Zoom
and then we'll come back to you. Thank
you madam Chair representative
Lord.
So who
is
that?
Oh
TC T
BS or
I can't quite see it.
Go ahead unmute yourself
and you can have one
minute
TCB
TS.
If you're there, please
unmute or we will mov'e
on.
Ok.
Ok. So
is there anyone else besides
the initial
person in the?
Ok. The other one I think
was Patsy Romero with
NAMI who said they are in
support of this.
So, and unfortunately,
we are not gonna be able to hear
from
the initial
person.
So give us a second while
we get these passed
out if
we have them.
Um
And while, while we're
taking a little break here,
um
House Bill 268
will also be rolled.
Um Rep Chandler is
in the in
making the sausage
intact. So um
she asked that it be
rolled.
So we will have rep
onion or new after
we finish with this. But let
us get, let us get
the
304 has a was
rolled in the beginning.
Yeah. No, that's
OK. I'm
sorry.
Both of Chandler's both
of
Chandlers.
So hang with us for
a second.
I have it in my
book.
Oh, that's OK.
So does everybody,
has everybody found it
or not
quite?
OK.
Representative Lord will go back
to you. >> Thank you
madam Chair representative.
OK. So let's go back to
vocabulary. Are
we I'm gonna
just say is that
gonna be like teaching them things
like um for
pronouns and also
training that
would it, would it go into anything like with
transgender? How that would be
different for someone who's had surgery or
not? How, what, what kind of vocabulary
are we looking at in
that
>> madam Chair and representative?
So um first, I
would like to just say that this
appropriation is intended for the
Department of Health to put out an
RP. Um The
folks who provide the training
would when they submit for that
contract would give an outline
of what that training looks like
and the oh would make those decisions,
right? But to answer your
question directly. Yeah,
we're talking about teaching
folks the difference between
uh gender identity
and sexual orientation. We're also
talking about teaching folks the
terms that maybe at one
point were accepted, but now
aren't right. And I think
we all know there have been
lots of words used to
describe Members of the LGBT
Q community that were come
practice in the seventies.
Some of them, my parents still
use that. I have to say like,
OK, it's not the seventies anymore.
It's time not to use that word.
So when we talk about vocabulary,
we talk about giving
affirming language to
use and making sure they understand
which words mean. What
things >> OK, thank you
madam Chair. And I appreciate that
because I know the language has
changed and even there's
some things I've got, I'm not really
sure and that we're adding
lots of other things to
that. And
so it makes it even difficult
for me that was raised in the
LGBT Q community to
understand where the words are now. So
I appreciate that.
Um Will
the LGBT Q community
have a seat at the table with the
Department of Health when they talk
about the terminology or who
are they going to use for
that?
>> Um Madam Chair representative.
Yes. >> OK. Thank
you because madam Chair, I, I
would want them to
have somebody who has a full understanding
of what the word he uses and then we're just
trying to guess because it would be
like me trying to do it and messing it up.
So we don't want that. OK,
madam Chair.
So
when and I'm not sure I didn't
Google this. So we talk
about the, the
prep is that the
medication that
you can take to
help prevent getting HIV? Is that
what that you have to say?
Yes, representative.
Yes. Thank you because I had
a bunch of people nodding once and nobody
knew what was happening. And I just kept
asking questions. So
we're Cementos.
So they're gonna include
that. Is that
because right now that
physicians
don't know to recommend
that to someone that comes
in?
Sorry. Gay. I'm
sorry, I don't >> know, madam Chair
representative. Are you referring
to the second part of the funding or
the first part of the funding?
>> I'm, when I looked at that House
Committee analysis
HV prevention,
is that going to be taught
in the training? Because it has some
very specific stuff is that going to
be taught about this >> medication.
Madam Chair representative.
Um the part about
HIV prevention
uh is to ensure
that everyone has equitable access
to that to that
um preventative medicine.
Uh The first part is to ensure that
people that
LGBT Q people that we
want to actually go to the
doctor to even ask for
this medication to be prescribed.
Um If you want
to.
>> Yeah, madam Chair and representative,
I think that's exactly right. We, we
put the two together because this
is an LGBT Q healthcare
equity, you know, issue.
Um prep is
the preventive medication that you take
once a day to prevent HIV.
What we know is that the vast Majority
of folks who are prescribing
it are sexual and reproductive health
care providers, which is
great, but primary care physicians
don't know about it. And a
lot of communities in New Mexico
don't know to ask about it.
So the idea is we
uh create more spaces,
more health care spaces that are LGBT
Q affirming. And we
get community based
organizations
um like the New
Mexico Dream. And these are examples.
These are not, these are not in
the, the I'm just giving up
hypothetical examples, but
the New Mexico Dream team
or a Las Cruces
based sort of
community service organization
to talk about
things like prep then
together, what we do is we create
a space where LGBT Q
people have doctors
to go to and they know to ask
for things that they might not otherwise
know about. >> Ok, thank
you, madam Chair represent expert for
explaining that because that's what I was trying to
figure out if we're doing the training,
it should be
fully encompassing
everything that includes
with that world, every single thing
that could happen along the way.
So madam Chair representative,
I think what I would like to see with
this because I'm gonna support the bill
is I would like to see
it offered, you know, how
doctors have to get training
every year and optional training
course that they could take
for their.
I can't the words not coming from me, continued
education. That's what I was looking
for. Like it's a continued
education course that
they could take. I know it wouldn't
be the full amount but you know, they can
supplement like maybe this one,
they need 200 credits. This one's 150
that would be 50 that might be,
be something that you look at in the future
that all
physicians including
chiropractors. Everybody
could go to that
to have that training
as an option that they would
see everything.
So madam Chair Robson, the last
thing I have when we
um
when we look at the training,
how I imagine this is
probably going to go to doh
you guys will help in the
writing of that. It'll
probably go
to
Presbyterian and things
like that where they say this is a training
you have to have. But how are we gonna
reach
independent primary
care physicians? How are they gonna be
reached
>> madam Chair representative
again, we we will not
mandate the training
for the providers.
But one such way
that we could reach some
of the smaller
healthcare professionals is the
primary health care association and
other Medical Associations
>> representative. And,
and what I was trying
to get to was
we don't want to mandate because
then then people start getting angry
because
and we don't want to make it. You can't get
insurance and you can't be in a plan. I'd
like it that
it's out there.
This is what you should probably
learn about, but that's why I was thinking
the extra credit class
because that would make more people go. Oh,
shoot, I need 50 more to
get my my
credentials for the year
and I would really like to take
this class so I understand how to
do that. So I support
this. Um I think
that's all the questions I have, mana.
Thank you. Thank
you, >> Representative.
Thank you madam Chair and
thank you Representative for
bringing this bill forward.
It is so
important
and uh such a a
wonderfully
simple but yet powerful
mov'e um and
affordable. So,
thank you. Um I
do appreciate that
you've reached out to
the the
primary medical
Providers Association who's
interested in it.
Just um just
a little tiny
clarification
is the funds
uh distributed
to develop a
training like a
program. Uh powerpoint,
a flyer that
is distributed
to medical providers
or are they going to do
actual live
training?
Um I know that I've
used Adrian lawyer
a lot of times for different
companies I've worked with.
I know we have the ability,
we have got good trainers in
the in the State.
Um So
is are we using all the
above? But it's such a
small budget. I want to
find out what is that
training,
>> madam Chair representative. Yes,
it would be an all of the above
approach.
>> Thank you. Very
much
Representative
>> Vincent.
Thank you madam Chair and
thank you, Representative
and Mr. Mar
Martinez.
So
some of the things that you had
mentioned, Mr. Martinez
madam Chair
was
being nervous
about going to the
doctor.
Well, I feel nervous
talking about this issue
just because I'm
unlike Representative Lord,
I, I really haven't been raised
about around that
and not that I'm
not
in the times,
but I just think
people should be treated like
people and
I, I don't disrespect
anybody whether they're
straight
gay
anything. I, I mean, I always treat
people with respect
and I know that it's
hard.
It's, well, it's, it makes me
nervous to talk about this and,
and I hate that people are
treated bad and if you go to the
doctor, you should be
treated like a person.
And they had mentioned the other day
on the, on the
four that
we're all five finger
beings.
And however,
you were brought into this world,
whether you're a biological
male or a biological
female.
If you, if you, if
I say that I'm a
woman,
but I'm biologically a
man. I would say that
they're gonna treat
me at the hospital
like a biological
man.
However,
um
I guess some of the questions that
I have
is
have we spoken with
providers in the State about
the interest of this
training and
who might want, who, who
wants to participate in
it, madam
Chair
>> um Representative
madam Chairman repres
chairwoman
um and
representative,
yes, we have spoken
to primary care providers who
are interested in this training.
Um Even, even just
yourself, right saying that,
um to be able to say, you know, we
don't have all the vocabulary
of how to talk about this.
Um And you
are wanting to
treat everyone with respect.
Um, you know, I think
most providers don't
want to treat
anyone with this respect, but
this funding would
provide, the training would allow
for them to have that training, for them
to feel that comfort. Um
to feel that confidence to be
able to um treat
us.
>> Thank you madam Chair and thank you
representative
who would be providing the
training.
Madam Chair, >> madam
Chair representative, uh
the Department of Health
would contract with a
community-based organization
to provide the
training
and they would use the regular
process, their RFP
process request
for proposal process to find
that that
entity.
>> Thank you madam Chair and
representative.
And
why is this bill even
up? Why is it,
why, why
are we needing to do this training?
Have you, has people been
disrespected in that
manner? Um
So for me
in a as an
example and madam
Chair, I hate to draw this out. I just,
I'm trying to learn
about this.
So
if I see
you
as a biological
man and you
want me to
address you
as a female, is
that the kind of training that we're talking
about madam
Chair,
>> madam, Chair representative,
I too agree. Uh You
know, I ideally these kind of
trainings would have already been offered
to many folks.
Um but the reason
why we're here today is because
there is inequity in the access
to these treatments. There is
discrimination um
intentional or unintentional
that is happening in,
in um healthcare
spaces.
And um if you
want to add to any of that madam
Chair >> representative, anything you say to
educate me, I appreciate it.
Yeah, >> madam Chair representative,
I appreciate the, the question.
And so, um, so
to start with, I'll say absolutely,
the discrimination is still existing,
right? Um, and I could
name dozens
upon dozens of instances. I
worked at a doctor's office
for roughly three
years. I have
friends who check the married
box on their intake form
and then have to have an
argument with the receptionist
at a, at a doctor's office about whether or
not they could be married to another
man. Marriage
equality has been the law of the land
for close to 10 years,
right? Um, and, and I
think that so we have
plenty of examples and the
reason we are asking for this
appropriation to build up this
program, we know
of four entities
that are based in Albuquerque that
are providing this training and we
get asked for the training all the
time. What we also know
is that as small nonprofit
organizations, we don't
have the means to reach the
local primary care
providers in rural communities
to offer the training to them
or let them know they could take
and we don't have the means to bring
folks together to then
provide the training if they
asked for it. So the
idea here again is
it is 100%
voluntary. It's an
opportunity for doh
folks like the primary
care association to use
their network of
providers across the State
and say, hey,
a couple of organizations are gonna
come to Southern New Mexico and
do X training on
X date and time
we'd love for you to come take the
training. It's free to you. It's free to
your staff. Here are the details. Let
us know if you can make it right.
Nothing about this is
again, is mandatory. We're
not asking folks to, to
take training that May be
against their personal
values, religious beliefs,
etcetera. But we know that there's
a, a significant
number of not just primary care
providers but specialists,
folks who work in hospitals, et
cetera around the State who
much like you are
nervous to talk about the topic,
want to treat their patients with
respect and would just like a little
bit of help in getting to that
place. This is designed
entirely to create the opportunity
for them.
>> Thank you madam Chair and thank
you representative
and Mr. Marshall.
Um I guess so. The other
question I had was
um you know,
because I was involved in
the emergency medical
side of things. You know,
we've been, we've been taught
on HIV for
years
and
um
prevention, all
all that kind of stuff.
And um I
heard you mentioned that,
you know, doctors
sometimes don't even know about
the pill that you need to
take for prevention.
Could you explain
that
>> madam Chair and representative, can you
clarify? You're asking me to explain
the pill itself. >> Why
would a physician not
know about
that? Med
>> got it. Thank you
madam Chair and representative.
So, uh, so prep
preexposure prophylactic
medication for HIV prevention
was approved by the FDA
A in 2012.
So we're talking about a
medication that's only
12 years old. The reality
is the vast Majority of primary
care providers have been
working and out of
medical school longer than
that. And so
much like
folks know that there, you know,
there are new treatments all
the time for I'm a survivor
of a stroke. For example, we have new
medical prevention, new medical
treatments for stroke
now versus,
you know, 15 years ago, this
is just about letting medical
providers know
things have changed there's a new
opportunity here. It's a,
it's a prescription you can
write and there's tons of
data and information about it.
It's just a matter of once
you get out of medical school and start
practicing, you can't necessarily
keep up with all of
the protocols without additional
training.
>> Thank you. And thank
you, madam Chair.
The only problem that I have with
this bill here
is that
it, it's exclusively
LGBT Q training
and I think what we've talked
about it should be training
for all.
Um and not
just,
you know, you're just a person,
you're just people.
So anyway,
thank you madam
Chair,
>> madam Chair. I like to make a
motion for due
pass.
Was there somebody else on the list? I'm so
sorry. No, no, she was
gonna make the motion. You
want to arm
wrestle.
I gladly
uh I gladly
yield to
a representative.
Go ahead. Representative, thank
you madam Chair. I'd like to mov'e to pass
on house
Bill 289
and then I'll second it.
Ok.
Is there any
opposition?
Ok.
So go ahead and take the
roll.
>> Representative Kate.
Yes,
Representative Chavez.
Yes. Representative
Ferrari. Yes.
Representative Jaramillo.
Yes.
Representative
Jones.
Representative Lord.
Yes,
Representative Sapanski.
Yes,
Representative >> Vincent.
No, with an explanation.
>> Madam Vice
Chair,
madam Chair.
Yes,
>> by a vote of 8 to
1. You have a due
pass
and we'll go back to Representative
Vincent. >> Thank you madam Chair
and thank you representative and thank
you Mr. Marshall.
Um,
part of my, part of
my, um,
you talked about, I, I'm a Christian
man and I've been
taught to treat
everybody with dignity
no matter what. And
you can go back and look on me
anywhere you want. I've never treated
somebody bad. Even when I
get mad at you, I'll,
I'll still treat you with
dignity and
that's why I
voted against this
because
I'm gonna treat everybody with
dignity and anybody
that's listening to what I'm saying
right now, I
think they should treat people with
dignity including doctors
or whatever. And
um thank you madam >> Chair,
Representative Vincent. I would
like to thank you for
stepping outside of your
comfort
zone.
Uh
ok, we have one
bill left on our agenda.
Um Well, there she
is hiding in the back.
I knew I had seen her
and she disappeared.
Um House Bill
293
as I previously
stated, uh 268
and 304 have
both been rolled.
So 293 is
our last
bill.
Ok. And
representative anya nou do
we have a substitute?
Ok.
Give us a second to get it
passed out and then
we'll.
Ok.
So I will entertain a motion
to discuss the
sub
madam Chair. I make that motion.
Ok? And the 2nd,
2nd
representative, we
have a a trend going
here. Yeah, there
you go. No arm
wrestling.
Ok. Go ahead whenever
you >> thank you so
much um
for approving that
sub and I have a handout for
you all as well. Believe
you. I don't know if you've received
it or not,
but to
begin
house. Bill 293
is madam Chair
representative
is an important piece
of help to address
the housing crisis. It's
very targeted. It's targeted
at a small but important
problem. People
who can afford rent
on an apartment and
financially qualify,
but they don't meet the credit
requirements because they have a less than
perfect credit history or they
have a prior
eviction in
their history and they
struggle to find a home and
often in my district is a
personal point that
usually means gainfully
employed, single mothers after
a split. So this
program run by the M
fa will offer
training and education
to potential tenants,
stressing the importance of
budgeting and credit building
for landlords. It
will be an entirely
voluntary opportunity.
Participating landlords will
agree to waive the
credit score or eviction
requirements. And in
return, the program
will create a fund that will
reimburse participating
landlords and property
managers. If in
the event that a participating
tenant is unable to
pay the rent. Sometime in the 1st
12 months of tenancy,
landlords will be able to seek
reimbursement for unpaid
rent up to
$5000.
And the fund will also provide
reimbursement for property
damage up to
$2500
with total claims
capping at $10,000
a year per participating
landlord or property
manager. This is a
small appropriation
of a quarter of a million dollars
for the year. But the goal of the
program is not to
use the money. The
goal is that the
participating renters
who have,
who are gainfully employed and
want to pay the rent will
not need to have their
landlords tap into that
fund.
We will be offering an incentive
to landlords to expect to
accept a small amount of
risk in return for
giving people who can already
afford a home, the
opportunity to
be in that home. It is a
leg up for those
renters and tenants
and this is not a voucher
program. It is not rent
control, it is not
mandatory and it's not even
eviction prevention.
Those programs address other
concerns and other ways.
There are no penalties for
landlords who don't want to
participate in our program
except that they May miss
out on building good
rental relationships
with a grateful
and financially stable
tenant and
I will let my experts
introduce
themselves.
>> Thank you representative,
you know, new uh to the
Chair
and representatives. My name is Kathryn
mcgill and
I'm the founder and director of the New
Mexico Black leadership
council
>> madam, Chair Members of the Committee.
My name is Stephanie Maez. It's
so wonderful to see you all this
morning. I am working
closely with Kathy and Jack and
a representative on this
particular piece of
Legislation.
>> I'm uh Jack Champagne.
I'm the uh director of
the Uplift Initiative. At New
Mexico Black Leadership Council
and the Vice Chair of the
Albuquerque Human Rights
Board.
>> Thank you madam Chair with that. We stand
for questions. >> OK.
Let's go to the audience
first. And if you are
on Zoom in
opposition, raise your hand
and we'll come back to you. Is there
anyone in the room in
opposition?
OK. Seeing no one. Is
there anyone on
Zoom?
No one period
or?
OK. OK. All
right. So if you
are um in support
on Zoom, please raise your
hand. If you're in the room
and in support, please
raise your hand.
Do you want to
speak?
Yes,
that
Good morning madam, Chair Members
of the Committee. My name is Marne
Silva and I'm the Executive
Director of the New Mexico Coalition
and Homelessness. Um I
actually didn't prepare any remarks
for this morning. Um but
I just wanted to make sure that we
know that um people that are
living um on the
streets or precariously housed
um really do need as
much support as possible. And so
this bill that the New Mexico Black
Leadership Council
and Representative Arno New are
bringing forward um is just
one of those pieces that will help
people um remain
housed and assist
people to not be um
prevented evicted
from from their housing. So
I would recommend
that you support this
bill. Thank you.
>> Thank you. We will
go to Zoom
Barbara, Tew Wald. Hi
Barbara
Chair.
Ok, go ahead.
Barbara,
>> can you hear me? >> Yes, we
can go ahead.
>> Thank you. I'm just so
pleased to hear about this
bill. I think it just
would close
such an important gap
that exists for homeless
people. You know, I I work at
the shelters
and so many people
have um
vouchers but they can't
get an apartment
because you
know, renters won't rent
to them. Landlords won't rent
to them or there's such a
high
deposit to have their
references checked.
So I just
wanted to say that I'm very
supportive of this measure.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Barbara and good to hear
from you
O
H
>> Good morning madam Chair and
representative. My name
is Hongyan with New Mexico
Asian Family Center,
a community based nonprofit
providing culturally and
linguistically specific
programs and services
to the Asian Pacific
Islander and native Hawaiian
lower income
individuals and families,
survivors and victims of
domestic violence and sexual
assault and other
crimes and
limited English proficiency
and anly in New Mexico since
2006, I'm
here to support HB
293
because this
creditworthiness
assistance program is so
needed and helps
those we serve to
better access affordable
housing programs.
Thank you, the sponsors
for bringing this forward.
Thank you madam Chair and
Committee Members for
all your hard work
you do for our State.
Thank you.
>> Thank you very
much
the range.
Ani Anita.
Go
ahead.
>> Good morning. Can you hear
me? Yes, we
can. Excellent.
Thank you very much. My name
is Anita Cordova. I am
the President of the
Albuquerque Affordable Housing
Coalition here to
speak in favor of
House Bill
of the House Bill in front of us.
Today. Housing is out
of reach for so many in
our city and across our State.
Housing insecurity and
homelessness is most
painfully visible in its
inhumane effects in the international
district. It's time to
support the solutions,
especially ones like House
Bill 293 which offers
the opportunity to
pilot a process for getting
people into
affordable housing and
increasing their opportunities
for stability and housing,
greater participation in
economic mobility,
education, healthcare
and so much more. I
urge you to take the opportunity
today to remove the barriers
for rental housing in the international
district. With the
lessons learned, we can then
expand this amazing
pilot project throughout our
cities and states in New
Mexico. Again, I
urge you to adopt this
pilot. It's a small
amount of money that can really
have a deep uh concentric
impact in the way we
address the barriers
to rental housing
in our State and city,
which is out of reach for far
too many people. Thank
you for the cosponsor for bringing
this forward and all
of you who will undoubtedly
support the bill. Have a great
>> day. Thank you,
Anita.
Um
Elise.
You'll
see.
>> Good morning. Um My
name is Ilze, be
I from primarily
volunteer among
Albuquerque
residents who
are still left living
outside.
Um It's devastating
to s to work with the
folks to try and accompany
them and see that there are
no meaningfully
available
resources.
Um I would say
that it is essential. It's beyond
time to make renting
more accessible and
equally so
to also help keep more
people housed. I think
this bill, it's
a pilot. It's not,
not a lot of money.
It's important to just support
this. I most certainly
support HB
293. Thank
you. Thank
you.
>> Ok. Um
Oh, we have
a
kamal. I'm
sorry if I pronounced that wrong.
Go ahead.
>> Oh, it's ok. It's, it's calmo.
Um So I'm actually,
I'm a landlord and I support
this bill. Uh,
no one should be homeless
and everyone should have
true access to
housing. I
believe everyone deserves
to have a new start.
And um
you know, this is also
beneficial to
for landlords as
well.
>> Thank you.
And I think that's the end
of Zoom.
Um
So we, we have
so far we have Kate's
Ferrari
Lorde.
Ok, go ahead.
Representative Kate.
>> Thank you madam Chair and
thank you so much representative
uh and for and and
presenters and, and bringing this
bill forward. II
I just, I love
um the creativity
of this bill that
it provides um
accountability and
opportunity, which
is a, a big
value for myself.
Um I I just wanted
a few uh updated
questions. So on the
$2500
that landlords can
access. Is
this above the
security deposit that
they May also
already require
or is this instead
of a deposit
>> madam Chair? Representative
Kates. Yes, this
is above that amount. Um
I know we discussed this amount uh
previously. So
just to
make it crystal clear for
everyone, this $2500
for property damage
is really designed to
cover
standard property
damage that you would find
um
in a rental situation
as the program
does not require landlords
to accept a
particular tenant.
Um The landlord, the
property manager would
still be able to
do their usual screening
background checks, things of that
nature. Um And
so they don't have to accept
any tenant that they did not
want. This is just
for tenants who do not
meet the credit requirements
or um have a prior
eviction. If the tenant still
feels good about or
sorry if the landlord still feels good
about that tenant, then of course,
they would, you know, then be free to
rent to them. So that
$2500
deposit for property damage
um does go
beyond their
usual security deposit.
Um but it is designed
to cover
standard property damage
that one can expect.
>> Thank you madam Chair. So
this is so impressive. So it
is run by uh M
fa is ma
going to
um distribute.
So, so such as
um and and I'm
sorry, I I hate
being asked operational
questions as well, but
I want to make sure that our property
owners and our and
our landlords know what a
wonderful opportunity this
could be. So
if, if uh
if a deposit is
required and
damages occur and they
exceed the security
deposit and
they have gone
through the training, the financial
literacy um
is it, is it a
program that ma
is running for the distribution
of funds? Or they
contracting out
uh the distribution
to ensure that there
are invoices
and um and
a a simple way to be
able to access those
funds
>> madam Chair. I will let my expert
answer that
question.
>> Sorry, there are a couple of questions
nested in there. Can you kind of
repeat it for me?
>> Thank you very much. So,
the what
you
are
to have up to
$2500
above the security deposit
if damages have
occurred? M fa
is our
subject expert
in our State of lending
and I would understand
that they May be in
training for financial
literacy. And so I really
applaud this model. I know
that we do it in
home sales uh
for first time
homebuyers. So
expanding financial
literacy to rent
renters is
a very innovative.
I love this approach. I'm
sure our State treasurer does
too because she believes
in all things
financial literacy.
Um So I'll go back to my
question, sir. Is
that, is M
fa contracting
with a company
that will oversee
the distribution and
access of
this pot of
this small pot of money
to um
secure
property?
>> Thank you, Representative
Kates. The way the
bill is currently written,
gives M FAA
relative amount of
autonomy in how
it administrates that program.
It gives them the ability to
contract out if that is
more economically
sound and administratively
efficient or it can be
done in house if that is
uh more
desirable. Um
the way that we had conceived
the program is uh
somewhat similar to a
program that Oregon runs in
which they do in fact
contract out for
both the education piece
and the distribution of
funds. Um But
Oregon is of course a different State
with different needs. So
ma being given the autonomy
to administrate the program as they
need, um being the
subject matter expert and with
the ability to study the
problems as they exist
is the best way to approach
that problem.
>> Thank you very much madam Chair
and thank you for that answer.
Um And so um
today you've brought
uh your, your presenters,
your subject to experts, you,
we've had public comment
on support for this.
This is, you know, all
training for financial literacy
can only benefit our
community and
um second chances
and we being able to create
a program that
is
um
opportunity for those
seeking housing and
opportunity for those
who need to protect their property
as well. I really
appreciate that
when
um
oh, I'm so sorry.
Well, when you
are uh
ha have you presented
this bill or shown this
bill to
uh the Greater Albuquerque
Association of Realtors
or the New Mexico
Association of Realtors
or the Property
Association or
the Apartment
Association
>> madam Chair representative, we have not
yet had the
opportunity to present
it as far and wide as we
would like. But when we
have spoken with
um landlords and
property managers around the city. It
has been extremely popular.
Marla Schultz with the, er, a summit
realty is a
very big supporter
of this bill um,
as it has no natural
enemies
and it's mutually beneficial
to both property managers
and tenants alike.
Um, if you want to expand on
that, you've had, you've had it longer
than I >> have. It's all right.
I have, um, on
an individual capacity, spoken
to uh, realtors
and property owners,
uh about what the
bill requires.
And overwhelmingly
the response I've
received is
um a
preference
uh for a bill of this nature
as opposed to things like
rent control. Um
because what it does
is
incentivizes the
ordinary course of economic
activity, private individuals making
financial decisions in a way
that is beneficial to the community
as opposed to imposing
a set of restrictions or simply
giving out money from the State
fund. So,
um just
anecdotally, I believe that
the response has been positive,
but we haven't, uh we haven't
done any sort of
organized uh
outreach to landlords.
>> Well, thank you very much madam
Chair and thank you again.
Um Just to recap,
this program is
not mandatory. It's a
volunteer opportunity.
It is accountability
and incentive
incentivizing
um opportunity
um for and,
and, and, and you know,
educating as
well. Um I very
much appreciate the
care and thoughtfulness
uh you've put in
to this and
I um look
forward to, I know
that in other committees, I had
several large
landlords stand up and
say they had 250
vacancies. So
I hope they're listening now
and they have an
opportunity to be
able to fill
those vacancies. Thank
you.
Thank you >> Representative
Ferrari. Thank you madam
Chair and thank you
representative for bringing this
forward and your great
experts. Um
I think this is a
really a great
idea for us to be able
to um help
people, you know, get
into their um
or to continue having
their apartments if they
or whatever
housing they choose.
Um But
I was, there's no, but
I was just wondering
with the
um
all
inclusion of
uh providing funding
for damages
is that in
consideration of
maybe a domestic
violence situation that
the person who's responsible
is left, you
know, um kind
of in the
responsible
um
area, you
know, to keep their apartment or
even if they have teenage
kids to put holes in walls and
things like that. Um
Like I've gone through.
Um So
I was wondering if you could explain a little bit
more about the damages part
of it.
>> Sure. Thank
you, madam Ferrari.
Um So there
were two considerations
that were made with that
particular provision.
One is that one of the
great barriers to the
availability of temporary
housing is the
um failure of some
temporary tenants to be adequate
stewards of, of
the uh property
that they are living in, but they don't
have any meaningful ties to they
don't own or anything like that.
And that has caused some reluctance
in the provision of housing to
low income tenants
uh because of the great risks
associated with that. So
in an attempt to attenuate the
financial risks associated
with uh
damage to housing
that is not adequately taken care of,
we add that in as
well. Um
And the other aspect of it is
the creation of an incentive
to lower the initial
costs of
uh renting uh through security
deposits and application. Because
part of the reason why
those deposits are
so high is the expectation
that the tenant will do damage
uh outside of what
is normally affordable and
that's in that respect.
So it is part
of a function of
the statute
lowering the
need to
create income threshold requirements
by attenuating the risk
associated with renting uh
by covering damages
a little bit beyond what
the security deposit
normally would. The hope
is that uh
landlords are now incentivized
to lower deposits, which is
itself a barrier
for low income
renters.
>> Thank you madam
Chair and I'm
sorry, I forgot your expert. Your
name, Jack. Oh,
that's
easy.
So this isn't
intended for one person
coming in or going out.
It's just so that the
um uh
landlords would be
able to, I like your
idea of making it so they don't
have to have such
a horrific deposit.
Ok. Thank you madam Chair. That's
all. Thank you
representative Lord.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Thank
you. Hold
on.
Yeah, I, I forget all
the time. MADD. I'm trying to start touching this
thing. Um, some
man experts, I
agree. I, you know, I'm
staying over in Aguri in the historic
district and I see very few people
that are from there living in
those houses and it i
it's very frustrating right now because
house prices have gone through the roof
all over the place, including here in New
Mexico. But with
that, I have questions and sorry, you'll have
to walk me through
this. So I want to
make sure first. So we
had
this bigger bill originally,
but now we're just down to
the substitute.
So can you explain to me madam
Chair representative? So we
not cause before we
had section
6.7 tw
27-3
and of say 1978 and we're
making amendments to
that,
but we stripped that out. So
now it's not applicable to
this. We're just given
an appropriation with no
rules or stipulations
on that or can you explain that to
me? >> Yes, thank you
madam Chair representative Lord.
So in the larger bill that
you see, it
had all the rules involved
because we were creating a
grant program under the Affordable
Housing Act, there were
conflicts with that
method of um
acquiring the
appropriation.
So we stripped
that out. Now, it's just
a straight appropriation from the general
fund and those exact
same rules that you see in the larger
bill will now be done
in rulemaking
under the general appropriation,
the General fund appropriation.
>> Ok. So madam Chair, if I
understand, so this will still
be applicable with the
rules because it's already in statute.
But the part that you added in
wording May or May
not because that didn't get
addressed here, is that what I'm
understanding? I'm sorry, >> I'm
sorry, madam Chair Representative Lord.
Could you
that
>> I just want to make sure I understand.
So we're still going to
use section
6.27 dash
three, but not
with the wording that you had wanted
to change. Is that correct?
>> So without, I'm
sorry, just give me one moment, I'd
have to pull up the
>> like if I look at page two, madam
Chair representative
you know, just on line to
you would change
definition,
creditworthiness
uh to damages
caused by rented residential
property and
all porce unpaid rent.
But then I heard people asking
about deposits and
damages. So is
that, was that already in
this originally
in 6-27
3? Because I
just thought where you were changing
Medi Chair and ribs and the
definition.
But then people started to ask
about
uh damages to the house.
So can you
show me where in section
6 27 3, we already
has that.
>> I am scrolling madam Chair
representative,
>> sorry I'm hard of hearing. I didn't hear
what you said. >> I'm I'm
scrolling
original >> then.
Ok,
>> I think they so,
ok, we've had several
iterations of this bill. So
regarding the
damage deposit,
it is not
in the
22 version ending in
7240.
It was in the original
discussion draft
and it will be included
in the rulemaking process
under this current version
of the bill.
>> Ok. So help me with
this madam Chair representative. So
I have the bill I
have.
This is the newest version, right?
It's just the appropriation,
>> madam, Chair representative.
>> Ok. So madam Chair and
representative,
what I'm trying to say is
and maybe I'm missing the bigger
picture here is
on this original bill
that you had.
We were referring to
this section adding new
language, right? So we had
6-27 dash
three
and that you wanted to add
this new language
into
what creditworthiness
means.
So help
me please to figure
out in that original
portion without your new
wording where
it says in here that this
appropriation
it's repl it's
wrapped around
this. But
I don't see if I were to look
this section up
right now. I don't see where it
says
unpaid rent
and damages.
So it just explain to me the
leap how that's going
to happen
with this if there's no
reference to this original bill.
And in the original part, I don't
see, just
show where does it say it in there is what
I'm trying to get >> to madam Chair
representative Lord. I think
I understand what you're getting at.
Now. That language was
included in the
previous version of the bill
because we were making an amendment
to the Affordable Housing Act. So it
had those definitions
included since we
are now no longer
amending an act, we are just
making an appropriation for the general
fund to create a program.
Those definitions are no
longer
nec nec a
necessity
under statute because
we're creating a program not
amending an act.
>> Ok. All right, madam
Chair. So going
back on that.
So if that is going to
end up being in this the
way this is worded,
can you explain to me? So
let's say I'm a
landlord
and I have two scenarios, I
have
someone who can't
pay their rent.
And then if I'm understanding
that would be
sorry. Hold on,
I got papers everywhere. We love
to kill trees in New
Mexico.
Um On
my analysis, the grant shall
not exceed
$5000
per person, 10,000
per year and then
2500 for property
damage. Is that correct?
>> So,
if you have a
tenant who cannot pay
the rent, they
would not be a
participant in this
program.
So that to address the
first part of your
question,
um that would not apply here
because this program
is just for tenants
who are gainfully employed,
who can afford the rent,
they just don't meet the credit
requirements of the
landlord.
>> Ok, so madam Chair.
So what
because it's hard for me. I'm
I apologize profusely. I'm
trying to make the leap from
just this to
all these other things that we
want. So that's what I'm trying to get
at because with this,
there's money going
somewhere, but I don't
have all the rules that are wrapped
around it.
So
the landlord is the
one that is going to apply
for this or is this just
for creditworthiness?
They, they, they've
moved out of a house, they got
kicked out because they destroyed the house
before, but the
landlord decides
that they want them to
rent the house. Is this what
I'm understanding? Explain to
me,
>> madam Chair representative.
So again,
the landlords who
participate, who choose to
participate in this
program, we are
not going to be
requiring that they make any
changes to their
application process to
their lease agreements or anything like
that. All background
checks that they do
for any tenant remain
the same if they see that
the um tenant
in question, the applicant in question
has a history of
damaging properties
that in itself
is enough of a reason for
them to choose not to rent to
that tenant. What this
program does is if
you receive an application from a
tenant and you
love them, they
are sparkling. They
have a great job.
They have great
references. They
just have, they don't
quite meet your credit standards.
Their credit score isn't great
or maybe they have a prior eviction
for let's say it's for
non-payment or not, but
not for property
damage.
Then that
tenant would go to
the education
training center that well not
center, the education training
program that would be provided by
ma that
landlord would then also
be a willful participant
in the MF
program.
And then at that point,
the landlord would waive the credit
requirements for the
tenant.
>> Ok. So madam Chair representative,
when you say waive
that what
I'm trying to make that leap is
then, so
I'm trying to figure out how everybody gets qualified
in this. So they both take this
training and
then they don't have to pay
the deposit or it's guaranteed
that that deposit
would cover all property
damage. That's the part I need you to >> I
will answer the first part of that
question for you. The tenant
>> and your expert
is also trying to get your attention over
there. >> Absolutely. So the
tenant would
do the training
program. The
landlord would just be
a participant
as being willing
to waive the credit
requirements. And I will let
MS mcgill answer the second
part of that
>> madam Chair and
representative. So
what we're looking at is
for creditworthiness,
it becomes a
barrier to
individuals being able to
rent an apartment.
What we have said is that
this program is for people who have
prioritized paying their
rent, but they are
attempting to rent into a
market where
they have to meet income
eligibility and
creditworthy requirements
of that particular
landlord. Essentially,
the landlord is assessing and
saying you need a
cosigner. So that's
basically, you know what this
program is about.
>> Ok, thank you, ma'am, Trevor. That
makes it. Thank you because I'm
like now because I'm trying to figure out how
this is all playing out.
So
it's like we have
madam Chair and ribs exactly like you said. So
now we have this cosigner that
says
if there's a part in time,
they can't pay the rent or there's
damages that will be
covered if if need
be >> madam
Chair uh
representative. That
is correct. You know, the
the individuals are participating
in the literacy programs
um in order
to ensure
that they are not continuing
to be in a situation where they
couldn't qualify.
So um it
is intended for those
individuals uh to be
in this program for two
years. Um And
then they would cycle off
and what we believe is
that uh we
will not have individual who
are defaulting
on their rent and that we
would have controls in place
to make sure that
we're have a catchment if
if individuals have not
paid their rent, that they
would fall off the program.
>> OK. Thank you madam Chair. And
what I'm trying to get it is I
do better when
everything is all spelled out for
me. Like in the last one, everything was
spelled out this one, I'm struggling
because I'm trying to figure out
this whole process of qualification.
Thank you so much for explaining to me because now
I understand the cosigner thing that
makes sense to me
and then madam Chair. So
who, who is the
oversight for bad actors?
Because I see there's a
limitation.
So somebody because
unfortunately, like I would love
for everybody to be altruistic
and honest, but it doesn't happen that way
in life. So if there is a bad
actor that gets into this program
and there's like, I'm
not gonna pay my rent.
How, I mean, I know
there's an eviction process but how do we
make sure they're no longer applicable?
They can't, they can't
fraud the system? Does that make
sense? >> So
madam Chair representative,
I'll give you a scenario
and, and really it harkens back
to something.
I would say that that is true of
my mother who raised
five Children on a teacher
salary in Oklahoma.
She prioritized paying
rent first,
um because she was not gonna
have her five kids
with no roof over their
head. So
what we find is I have a
71 year old grandmother
who's raising three
grandchildren.
Um, her lease is not
renewed because a private equity
firm has purchased
her apartment and they
are not renewing leases
giving people 30 days
in the dead of winter in
the middle of the school year to
mov'e. She
makes $35,000 a
year. And
um, she's looking for an apartment,
the average cost of
those apartments around
$1900 a
month.
She goes to the person she
can prove that she has prioritized
paying her rent. However,
they say my rules
are that you have to be
creditworthy and
income eligible.
And so what this does
is take that
burden off the table
and also gives
the person that is
renting to this
qualified in all
other ways, renter
some
comfort that, that they're
not gonna be,
um,
there's not gonna be a default or
that they're not gonna be uh
burdened by
having a bunch of defaults. So
those are the people that we're dealing with
in this situation,
those individuals who have
prioritized paying their rent. And
as a representative said
at the beginning, um
those individuals
who
uh all
things being equal
would qualify
except for those
uh barriers that are in
place.
>> And I'm Chair representative, I
totally understand. I
grew up in California and I had to work
five jobs to pay my rent. And it's horrible
because you have no free time and it's absolutely
horrible and you still can't qualify
because it's so outrageous.
But my
original question
is, what
is the oversight?
What is the oversight
in here
that says,
ok, we have somebody who's in this
program and we've
had them on the floor, they're on here and
they're just not paying their rent.
Can you disqualify
them at that point saying, no, you guys
are abusing the system or how is
there something in place for
that
>> madam Chair
representative?
So as we,
you know, work
on those requirements,
what we're saying is
that we want to put safeguards in
place and all
of that is not spelled out in the
bill, however, we have discussed
it and it is a part
of the program as it
will be enacted.
Um, that if an
individual has not paid
the rent for 30 months,
30 days,
that there would
be a notification and
that they will be at risk of
being removed
from the program. >> Ok.
Thank you madam Chair and,
and I'm probably gonna conclude my
questions because
how I work when I vote on
something, I really need
to know something inside and out
before I can make a decision for me.
It's something to some things. I'm an absolute
no. And there's some things I'm an
absolute yes. And then I have your
bill where
I don't have things spelled
out enough for me. So it's probably
going to be no, only because I don't know
what all the details are, but
I will talk to the representative
afterwards because
I'm trying to make
all the connections and the dots
and I don't want to sit here, you know,
for another two hours
asking you questions on this.
So I will talk to you about it later
if you can get with me.
Um And I just
have something real quick. So
persons, so we
have this cosigner over
here
and um
how does a landlord
say, hey, they couldn't
make all the rent this month and
then they go to this
program and then they pay
it and then how long would
that take before they got the
money?
>> Um Excuse me,
madam, Chair representative.
Uh Yes. If at that point,
if the tenant who's
under the program then
skipped out on the rent
was unable to pay,
the landlord would still
follow their
typical steps
that they already have in place
for eviction if that is
required. And then the
M fa or
contracted out um
company, as we mentioned
before, would then pay
the difference of
the remainder of the lease
>> and, and madam Chair. And I see
the expert, I think has an answer
that too because there's, there's
situations I fully understand
where there's situations
where you just don't
have enough money to pay rent and I don't want
those people kicked
out. But what I'm trying to get
at if a
landlord,
like let's say you own a home and you're
the landlord,
I need to know and they have to make
the mortgage payment. I just need to know how
long is it gonna take? Is it gonna get
there in time
to not hurt the
landlord?
How long is it gonna take? Or do we
know if, if not that's fine. If we don't
know the answer to that
>> madam Chair representative, I
really appreciate this line of
questioning like you, I like to
see operationally how things
are going to
unfold, I think
because this is a new program
for our community. We
wanted to make sure that we
had a little bit of
autonomy to experience
experiment with various
models of the program
um and have the
flexibility to do so.
So we have, you know,
some of the parameters that
the representative um
mentioned and that my other
experts uh mentioned.
Um But as far
as the details that you're
specifying, we really want
to be able to work with M FA
and with Bernalillo County
to roll out a
program that is thoughtful and
that we've engaged all of the
stakeholders to develop that
program together.
Um I think the
sponsor and, and all
of us who are supporting this
bill are open to
um putting whatever you
think needs to be put in statute,
in statute, So you feel
comfortable. So we have your support
because that does mean
a lot to us.
>> And if I could just add to that,
um while,
especially while we're setting
up the program, we
May not have the exact
turnaround time for you
because this is the creation of a pilot
program. The, the,
at the end of the day, the point is that
that landlord property manager
will be in invests will, will
be reimbursed for
the balance of the lease as opposed
to losing out on that money
altogether, which is really the crux
of the program. >> And thank
you, I appreciate the answers because I am
I'm a details person as you can
see and I see both
sides having
had to work five jobs to pay the
rent is not fun and sometimes things
happen. But at the same time, I
also was a temporary landlord
and I would never do that again the rest of
my life because I had to evict the person
out who wouldn't pay their
rent, I was selling drugs out
of the house and I had to go through an eviction
process. So I'm trying to make
this equitable right. We want
people who go through a hard
time to be helped,
so they don't end up on the streets.
But at the same time for
me, I want to make sure our
landlords are also protected. So
if you can put something in that,
that we
want to make sure that like if you're a landlord
and you got to make the mortgage payment, like I was
at that time and I couldn't afford to
them not to pay me. I
don't want them to default the mortgage
because then guess what happens?
They could, an unscrupulous
landlord could keep collecting the
money and use this program
as well and then
they default on the loan. Do you
see where I'm going with that? So it's,
it's both sides of the specter I'm
>> looking at? Yes, absolutely.
And um there will also
be safeguards in place
so that for the quarter million
dollars, we are going to make
sure that we do not have
more participants than
we have money
in the fund to cover them.
Should they all default? Which
we do not anticipate
because in Oregon and
Washington where they have these
programs in place
already, they
are actually paying out
very little from
the fund because again,
these are people who have
jobs who are
excited to pay
their rent they are there, they're
ready to pay it, they're willing to pay
it. It's just the
prior eviction
from their
teens, late teens,
early twenties or their
credit history is
prohibitive from them getting
the apartment in the first place. So these
are people who can pay and who want
to pay. So as they are
being put in apartments,
as their um
credit worthiness
is being brought up to speed
for their age
tax bracket, etcetera,
etcetera. The payout
from this fund is
have we have seen in
other programs is very
low. So the
the whole point of this program
is that it is landlord protection.
So they are
assuming
um less risk
because that fund will be
there. Should a tenant
decide to
skip out on their lease
for whatever reason? >> Yeah, and,
and thank you. Thank you, madam. I'm not
gonna ask you more questions. I could sit here all
day and ask you questions, but I'm
just going to tell you now, I'm gonna vote no on it. Not
because of the premise but because I
need more information. So
thank you madam Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Jones.
>> Thank you madam Chair and thank
you representative
and for all the discussion, I appreciate
the details too.
Um One
thing I didn't hear and maybe I missed
it is, is this uh is
this money in the
budget.
>> So we are working with Members of the
Senate right now to get it put in
on the Senate budget. It's
that super fun tight rope
of
it's um
having to go through the committees.
So it gets in the
budget.
So if we don't
get it through committees, it definitely
will not be in the budget. But we
are having those conversations about having
it put in the Senate budget right now
and it looks pretty promising.
>> Ok, thank you very much. Thank
you madam Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
>> Hernden. Thank
you madam Chair and
to the presenters and to
the experts. Thank you for bringing
this program forward.
Uh What I see that
is really in uh exceptional
about this program is sometimes
people just go through a hard
time but they really
are sincere about paying
their rent and by being
responsible and
sometimes they need a hand,
not a handout, but a
hand and what I see
this program doing is providing
that hand. So if I
go and I and verify
this with me, if I go
to rent a
an apartment, but my credit
score is 250
but I really do
want to make sure that I
can pay my
rent. I am working to
that. I just had a
hard time and hitting
up, hit up on a
bad situation.
This program
will help me get
into an apartment. Is that
correct >> madam
Chair Representative Herndon?
Yes. Absolutely. Um
If you have a job and
you are able to prove
that you are gainfully employed
and can afford that
apartment, you are
100% who we are
looking for. You will
benefit from the training
provided by ma
that will help you um
budget
get your uh rent
or not rent. Sorry, excuse me, get
your credit rating to where
it should be. This program
is absolutely made for you.
So thank you. >> Thank
you madam Chair and thank you
madam presenter.
What I also understand is
that everyone going into
this program, anyone who wants
to participate in it will
go through a training. Is that
correct? Because you want to make
sure that people who
go into this program are
sincere about paying their rent.
We're not looking at people who
will not pay their rent
or not be responsible,
but they go into a training
first before they even
admitted to this program. Is
that correct
>> madam Chair representative?
That is correct. Um
We have different
windows about how long
that training will last.
But yes, you will be admitted
to the training before you are
admitted into the apartment.
And this is we talk about
financial literacy
classes in various
forms a lot in this
body. And
um we talk about it a lot in
schools but not
necessarily as like
adult continuing
education. And I think
that's where this program really
shines is that it does offer
that for adults.
>> And Thank you madam Chair and madam
presenters. What I have
learned is that credit
unions throughout the State
absolutely have similar
programs when people are looking
to borrow money, but they
come to come to these
credit unions and
they are uh given
the opportunity to help
find ways to increase their
credit scores if they have fallen
upon hard times.
And this program is like that
they accept is making sure that
they can get into housing
that is better for them and their
families even though their credit
scores are poor. Is that
correct >> madam Chair
representative? That is absolutely
correct. >> Well,
thank you madam Chair and thank
you madam presenters. This is an
excellent program for helping
the people in New Mexico
and sometimes we just fall
on hard times. It's not
about we're gonna destroy
property or we can't pay
the rent. Sometimes
we just need a hand to let us
get our credit scores
back on on track.
I've seen a number of these uh
incidents that occur
throughout the people that I help in my
nonprofit law Center. And
thank you for the work that you're doing
madam Chair. Thank
you
>> madam madam Chair. I
feel like getting up and
cheering.
Where are my
pompoms,
madam? Chair, Representative
Vincent. Did you have
questions
madam Chair? I'd like to mov'e a due
pass.
Ok, let me get a second,
>> a second. >> Ok.
Representative Hernan, go
ahead. Thank
>> you madam Chair and
representative. Just two
questions. I have uh given
the changes that
uh were in the
substitute.
Could
what
>> I can't look at
that
>> is somebody
smoking?
>> Ok. Anyway, I'll just
because I don't hear no alarms
going off.
So,
um why was
this? Uh So
the require
the changes that
was made in the Committee
substitute
could all this
money be spent just
getting the program
going?
>> Um No madam
Chair representative, the
um purpose of the
appropriation is to create
the fund. So since
it will be going through ma and
M already hosts
several education programs,
um we don't need this
money to create
the education piece.
This money just goes into
the fund.
>> Thank you. And madam Chair
and representative,
um if we're
providing money directly
to individual
landlords, will there
be a problem with the
anti donation clause?
>> Thank you very much madam Chair
representative. No,
because this appropriation will
come from the general fund through
D fa to M
fa.
>> That's all I've got. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. And I, I want
to thank you all for working on
this um in the health
and Human Services Committee, we
know that
bankruptcies from
medical debt are
unfortunately
running rampant and
ruining people's credit.
So thank you for bringing
this and I will entertain a
motion madam Chair.
Oh, we
did
and the second and the second
and it's only
Monday.
>> Sorry madam Chair.
The the motion
needs to read that we
will do not pass
on the presented bill and
the pass on the
substitute
>> I accepted >> for
it. And I second
what she said.
>> Ok, Jennifer.
Can you take the role? Yes,
ma'am.
>> Representative Kate.
Yes.

Chavez.
Representative Ferrari.
