Adam chair here.
We have six. We did not finish

Which I would do various
processes they face so as a
rosary inside and seeing how
different things are playing out
at the higher ed level, and a
lot of the students feel that
this system is faded. The things
I have observed viewing
investigations is we're not
trained.
That they and while there may be
paper policies and one of the
the have these policies already,
we're already following federal
law.
They may be serving a role where
there isn't really getting in

and we need over some
So that Victor
Fair modicum of due process in
simply does pass and that we get
beyond window dress. Good
morning, madam Chair members of
the committee. I'll be extremely
brief. My name is Alexandria
Taylor, executive director of
the New Mexico Coalition of
Sexual Assault programs. I think
chair Thompson did a great job
of covering everything.
I will say we're focused on the
higher ed version this year when
we started this work in 2019. We
had a K through 12 portion, and
those young people are now in
college, and they have been
occasions since they were
freshmen in high school, And so
we feel truly accountable to
them to get this policy done for
them.
Um and then I will also just
share in the past years. This
bill has received bipartisan in
the house and so thank you.
Um, we will go to the audience
for those who are in opposition.
Of health home. Is there anyone
on zoom and then we'll go to the
audience. Um, uh, those in
support, and we will take 10
people. You can all raise your
hands. If you're in here and say
okay, and so we have less
intense speakers, so who would
like to speak? We'll start on
this side.
Those in support. They would
like person so this will work.
Um, thank you, madam chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Haley, Southwest Women's
Law Center.
And I was in college. I
admittedly party quite a lot,
and I remember that people would
talk about a certain party house
on campus to stay away from
because you would get in trouble
for drinking, But nobody would
ever get in trouble. Never be
the case and to me. My
experience underscored the need
for a paradigm shift in how
educational institutions address
sexual violence.
It is with this background that
I express my strong support for
HB 151 provision protecting
survivors and bystanders from
punishment, even in the cases
where their behavior may have
violated the student code of
conduct. Um, underscores the
commitment to prioritizing the
well being of those who have
endured trauma and because of
this, we believe it will create
a safer and more accountable
campuses.
And I urge you to support it
today. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Um anyone else on
that side and support okay?
Hi requiring trauma.
Um, And also my name is Lana
Weber Policy advocate with
the
strong support of the spill. Um,
this bill would educated they
need no matter where they live
in creating harmful punishment
regimes. Thank you. Anyone else
on that side? Okay, let's go to
the Your left. My right. Um,
anyone?
You anyone else?
In support that like to speak.
Cute.
What would you like to
First thing that stuck out
It was on Page two.
On When we go to line 13 can
never be given to a reason why
you didn't put this is about
okay. And Madame Carron
Representative, Um
Besides the fact that someone
can't give consent, which is
obvious that they're under
medication.
We also have
Lack of protest is not can be
revoked at any time.
Can you test
Of what you think.
Affirmative consent would be
madam Chair.
Madam Chair representative on
Page five. There's the
definition for affirmative
consent, which means affirmative
conscious and voluntary
agreement engage in sexual
activity. So, um, this bill
accomplishes two things. It's
one the creation of policy that
allows for the training and
education.
Um of people on higher ed
campuses to understand that the
standard is one of affirmative
consent that needs that
definition. Um, what that looks
like in the training that's
that's been developed and his
evidence based is teaching those
things that you named from page
to that someone cannot be
incapacity, incapacity and all
of the other enumerated things
in order to give consent.
Okay, So, Madam Chair
representative, can you
Does that mean?
That they just say.
What I'm trying to get at
Because we all know what sex
involves, and there's a lot of
passion in the moment Do they
have to say Stop and say Yes, I
agree. Affirmative consent.
Look
Madam chair representative and
affirmative consent as a clear,
yes.
Okay?
Madam.
I'm just trying to figure out
Are you?
Because if I go back to this
Silence.
If we're making out
It's passionate.
At some point does somebody have
to say
Yes. Or is it that being silent?
Mean that they didn't get
Madam Chair, representative, Um
So, um
Are there. Colin is so in the
colleges
You're saying that none of this
No one is teaching this. No
one's discussed. Madam Chair
Representative, Um
There are colleges that say they
have there is not a standardized
requirement and policy that all
of our college campuses, all of
our hearts have to abide by and
even those that say they are
already providing this
education.
I hear because of the privilege.
I have to sit in the position
that I am in. I hear all the
time in communities all over the
state people going through, Um,
the reporting process those that
do choose to go through the
reporting process and they tell
me overwhelmingly, it is not
working. It is not trauma
informed. Talk about when they
reported to one representative,
all of the above.
Ford it to a college. Who are
they in healthcare? The
teachers which part of that is
like, I don't know. Um, this is
Madame chair. Um, in response to
your inquiry at, um I don't know
that there is one standardized
procedure for all institutions
of higher learning. But in
general if it is reported to
shin of higher learning
Most campuses, then have a
mandate that that report goes to
Oh, I e or whatever division
Um, the same with law
enforcement. So the my job
There needs to be reporting
forward. So hold their reporting
is also that reporting goes
further.
And that efforts be made serves
And that's that after
So Madam Chen represents so is
it with this bill is that the
goal then?
Everybody in the administration
or who is Who would this be this
because we're trying to get
people raped? Looks like we're
trying to make people who would
this address the most.
Mandatory, Madam Chair
representative. It is for, um
students and faculty and
administrators and contractors
so the schools would be required
Madam Chair representative.
There's an evidence base for
what affirmative consent
policies should include. We have
outlined here that they need to
be trauma elements within the
bill of what they should. They
shall include, um, including the
affirmative consent standard.
Um and then from there on page
two detail Ng what the policy.
So on page
Madam chair that all parties who
participate as complainants or
witnesses of the
Post secondary educational
institutes. And okay, so we're
saying that all parties who
Um it at the very end of second
Um it at the very end of sect of
to enlist the institution
determines that the violation
was egregious, so we don't want
people not reporting because
there was over over over
drinking. Um and that's been the
problem for quite a while as if
it's a party with alcohol.
And something happens. People
don't want to be witnesses or
report because they will get in
trouble and they can report and
not not be. Not Also Princeton,
would they talked about or would
there be their name be put down?
Madam Chair representatives. So
this language specifically
allows to address is the
underside allows for someone,
um, to serve as a witness or to
actually tell what happened to
them without hopefully without
drinking. Um And so this this
without retaliating, perhaps
their behaviors. Um so they
went, would they be
Subject to disciplinary. I can't
do this. We can kick you out
That wouldn't affect them in any
way. Okay? Um, not this is this
chair, Thompson pointed out.
There is the exception unless it
was egregious, um, or including
an
Plagiarism, cheating or academic
in that portion that it's
important witnesses know that
Even though you're saying they
come forward, and they may not
have legal consequences so that
they know so that they don't
come forward and say Oh, I said,
I think that's all they have.
Because I'm I
I love the idea and I have to
say something. Um, there's still
a belief
And it doesn't matter whether
you're a person rape cases. What
we're wearing that when you were
raped, it's almost like you have
to prove it.
And there's always you know,
when you go to court.
They're going to ask you what
you were wearing.
I absolutely agree on the
training part. I do get really
on the affirmative consent
because
If we're saying it's only with
the verbal yes.
I don't want
I'm on both sides of the fence.
You're making out. You're about
If you forget to ask, so I get
really hung up on that
terminology, but at the same
time I understand.
To be coherent. I'm hung up with
this, but there are no criminal
penalties in here. This is not
criminal. This is totally I
mean, if the criminal is chair,
I would. I would disagree on
that because you're making it
very clear line Say yes, every
time and this is where I'm hung
up. Thank you, Madam Chair, man
sure like to make a motion for
do moved and seconded.
For do pass on House Bill one.
Representative Cates.
Yes. Mhm Representative Chavez?

enforcement and exactly what

Thank you, madam Chair.
Members of the committee. Uh
Dias de Larios.
The old way of saying good
morning in Spanish. Um
Uh, one of the yours when I was
growing up the elders,
if you just said when was Diaz
They would kind of, but in and
say
When the asked the foil Diablo
Paquita Adios that to the so
that so So if you didn't say one
of the other areas, which is the
traditional greeting in the
morning
The elders of button and say
that and that means good
morning, said the devil to take
God out of the day. Ach, so we
never said when or the visit the
whole thing. We're not the end
of various Madam chair members
of the committee. Uh, I do have
an amendment, but I would like
to
Present the bill first and also
have my experts present
testimony, then present the
amendment before going to the
audience for comments from the
odd chair. Um
Before I go into my present made
it all the way to the governor's
desk last session as part of the
arm Numbers tax package.
And unfortunately, the governor
line item Madam Chair House.
Bill 163 is a taxpayer that adds
six new categories to our
existing Rural Healthcare
Practitioner Tax Credit Act.
These are pharmacist.
Ah and in many rural communities
The drug store is a pillar.
Of the community.
Uh, I remember when I was going
up the drug store.
Even though there were two other
ones, But the drug store New
York, commit to
Um, I was the only place you
could get a
Cherries, pride.
And Vanilla Coke.
It had to pinball machines also
And when the media are growing
up as teenagers, there was also
an attraction at that drugstore,
And it was a Playboy magazine
that we couldn't get our hands
on because it had a cover and
you have to. You have to contact
the clerk in order to kind of
get her off the shelf. But madam
chair you know Moriarty in 2022.
118 year old Buckland pharmacy
in Berlin close to see these are
institutions that
Are going by the wayside that
stabilized the bill, also as
registered nurses and Madam
Chairman committee.
We know during Covid.
Front line. The nurse registered
nurses, frontline health
workers, But aside from that
They were the only persons in
Holding the hand of patients
that were perishing.
From Covid.
Why
Because members were not allowed
into the time.
Well, also a social workers.
You hear her health counseling
therapist, physical therapist.
And the Tax and Rev. Committee
put our practitioner
Hmm. Bill in the tax bankers
last year.
And added licensed midwives.
That's what the amendment is at
the urging of vice chair
Micaela Cadena.
3000 tax graders applied. This
is the ninth straight year. Four
years ago, the House passed that
finance
And, uh and I always kind of go
by my dad's
Kind of
Words.
Don't quite succeed at something
the first time and you would
always encourage us. We're going
up.
That if at first you don't
succeed.
Pray the rosary and try again.
Where has his words of advice?
And that's your was the first
time that this measure
Made it.
In the tax package German Lent
was is whittling down.
The tax package this year from
last year's 1.1 billion.
German Linton has committed
placing husband 160, madam chair
of the Rural Healthcare
Practitioner Tax Credit Act was
established in two. It's two
tiered. There's a 5000 credit
and the 3000 credit.
The 5000 credit.
Ah, it was intended to retain
Current practitioners in our
room.
But it also is a real also to
reduce work shortages areas and
lastly, to enhance because when
practitioner doing, they set up
shop and buy a home, they shop
in the local retail stores.
And, uh, last year and
presenting the measure before
you this coming, Jones raised an
important issue.
That as originally drafted.
And when it came to qualifying
hours
We limited registered nurses.
Only for the half credit.
So in her language
representative 351.
Get rectified that oversight.
And such language was
incorporated into the last
year's tax bill and is
incorporated into this bill as
well. Also a representative
Jones's
Definition of rural in her.
House Bill 351 was also
incorporated. We also hit a
suggestions by the tax and Rev.
Analysts to upgrade reporting
criteria.
Of the and, uh madam chair.
And there's a great deal right
between
Urban and rural when it comes to
health practitioners.
And the New Mexico Healthcare
Workforce Committee and their
last annual report states. The
following
There are 16,466 90% of
The 16,460 21% of these
practices and 65% of New Mexico
is rural.
Purposes of our tax bill.
Approximately 303,060.
There are 8 8400.
Practitioners in New Mexico.
25% of these practitioners
practice in rural areas. Yet in
Mexico is 60 purposes of our tax
bill.
Alright. 1800 farmers are those
Are in runner 60 pharmacists are
out. There are 1500 physical
therapist in New Mexico.
25% of those PTS are in rural
areas. Yet you Mexico is 60
purposes or a tax bill 380.
In total, with six additional
profit.
With the six
Uh, and the abduction estimate
that 6000 new director brother.
Incorporating run New Mexico.
And incorporating their own New
Mexico initiative in our tax
package is monumental.
I equated to reaching the top of
the night.
It has not been common practice
among the Legislature to
systematically target
Tax packages.
I like to yell to my experts.
Um, they'll tinker with them.
Madam Chair, Madam chair members
of the committee.
I'm Dale Tinker, I'm executive
director of this committee has
has seen me and even before that
it took priority issue with the
health care town.
Pharmacists were included in
Initially included successful in
keeping pharmacy.
As you may have noticed from the
statistics that
Representatives Garcia before
percent of pharmacists in
Worse than we're losing
pharmacies. Three more closed in
the reason they closes because
they can't get them.
Thank you, Dale.
Madam chairman, members of the
Corre. So when this bill first
passed in 2007, it had very few
providers in mentioned and then
over the years we've been able
to add other provider group list
and see our NHS.
And since then I don't think
we've been able to, uh, add
anyone and as you all may have
heard there is a health health
care shortage of all providers.
But if we just look at
registered nurses in the
November
Um, Workforce Solutions report
There were advertisements for
6200 nurses in the state. That
means job openings. And there
should there could be a little
duplication there, But we know
that nurses have synergism of of
shortage, educate more nurses,
but that's another bill.
So when looking at how can we
help?
Nurses go to T or C
Where most of the nurses at the
veteran we I am sure there are
people who live there and that
would a there if there were more
incentives, so this $3000
terraces could be could be
extremely helpful and is
important when I talked to
various providers credit
Really helps in in a rural area
where
Get as much reimbursement for
that facility. So this is a an
important piece of legislation
that creates a little more
equity.
In a bill. Why should only a few
providers and write it?
When there are multiple types of
providers think of every way
possible to attract are
Health care providers to live
immunities. Thank you. Thank
you, Linda.
I'm sure we're at that point
where we like to act on the
amendment.
Oh, okay. Go ahead Amendment for
discussion.
Is there a 2nd 2nd in the
opposition?
Not sure if I could explain the
amount. I'm sorry. I thought you
had
Okay, Madam Chair. Um
In in in drafting
The drafter in that burden on
the amendment chair, Um and and
thank the team. This bill, Um
Representative Cates. We're just
on the amendment. Okay. Okay. I
was
I appreciate you bringing it
forward. Is there a reason why
you did not catch language
Pathologists?
Seven.
And that committee has basically
And aside from that sessions to
this bill,
Because right now we're at and
if we add professions
Thank you, Madam Chair and and
thank you, representative just
to clarify. So the committee
Um, findings were that madam
Chair the New Mexico health
And their determination is to
look at and do an annual report.
And in their annual reports for
the left, and the professions
that you're addressing have not
been prioritized.
Thank you, madam Chair for first
of all taking me down Memory
lane. We do appreciate our local
pharmacist. I love I actually
love all the people that you
have stated here is this on. So,
um
One thing that I was looking
here is
How nurses was holding in my
previous profession.
I was wondering if I would never
want to miss. But what did
Firefighters will fight and they
were the war y they were left
off.
And representative Cates. The
amendment is about midwives. If
you want to speak it in the main
bill about whether whether other
professions were left out, But
let's basically we're adding
midwife. So if the questions
aren't around, midwife practice,
Okay, So is there any more
discussion on the amendment?
Okay?
Representative Cates and
representative Lord was the
second. Is there any opposition
unamended Bill? Thank you, madam
Chair.
Yeah, We are back in the small
room and for everyone I have,
but HDFC needed their room this
morning, which is where two of
our members are. So we will
start with folks if you're on
zoom in opposition, Raise your
hand will go to the room and, um
And if there's anyone here and
you have one minute, So is there
anyone in the just to show of
hands? You don't have to want to
speak in opposition. Okay? I'm
trying to be really specific in
my instructions. Okay, on zoom
If you are in support, you can
go ahead and raise your hand and
we will take the 1st 10 people.
Um, in the room. People in
support. Raise your hand.
So put your hands up.
Okay, So if you have your hand
Oh, she doesn't want to speak.
Okay, We'll start on this side
of the room again. Raise your
hand and you go ahead and just
Madam chair and members of the
committee. My name is I'm a
student pharmacist, you know,
finish.
I stand in support of house Bill
163, because I believe we need
to do everything in our power to
recruit we can actually see
farther than my owner.
Um, this is vital, crucial as
I'm a short guy. Sorry, Manager.
Okay, We will take 61 minute,
please.
Um And if you could
I
It's Dana Gray, madam chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Dana Gray, incoming
executive director of Desert
States Physical Therapy Network.
We'd like to thank
representative Garcia for his
tireless efforts in regard to
this bill and representative
Jones for taking up the cause.
Well. The network is comprised
of 30 independent private
practices of physical therapy
and occupational therapy. 14
clinics are located in rural
areas. Rural clinics struggle to
retain and recruit staff, a tax
credit for rural physical
therapists could provide an
incentive for therapists to
serve in these much underserved
communities.
We stand in full support of
house Bill 163 and urge your
support as well. Thank you.
Thank you, Dana. A couple of us
in our in here raised our
eyebrows when we heard you are
going to be the new executive
director.
Um, So who's next?
Danny. Go ahead, Danny.
Hi. I'm Danny Cross and I'm a
rural practitioner Pharmacist
have owned and operated stores
in southeast New Mexico for 30
years. I ask that you support
this legislation because
anything we can do to recruit
and retain healthcare providers
in this area is essential. Thank
you very much. Thank you, Danny.
Next is
Go ahead.
Hi. My name is Jenna DMSO.
Skidata Rios. I live in
Lovington, New Mexico, or our
pharmacy has been located here
for over 80 years and we are
able to service a lot of low
income and surrounding cities
that are have no, um, pharmacies
about 30 minutes away, And so I
support this bill.
Thank you, Dan Frampton.
Good morning. I thank you for
this time. I'm my name is Dan
Frampton. I'm a leader with
Albuquerque, Interfaith and Co
chair of the A. S. W. In
Mexico's legislative committee.
This is something that I've been
working on.
Around the nine years that
representative Garcia you talked
about?
Um
The N A. S W supported this
issue for a long time. This is a
big issue for a lot of rural
practitioners. Um, the margins
that a lot of people work on are
slim. And so the $3000 which
would apply to social workers
would go a long way for people
to kind of pay their bills and
keep up when they're just
struggling to provide services
to underserved areas.
So thank you, Romero.
Madam Chair. Can you hear me can
go ahead. Taxi.
Madam chair. Can you hear me can
go ahead. Taxi!
Madam chair. Can you hear me can
go ahead. Taxi,
UM, committee members, Madam
chair and members of the
committee Representative Garcia,
Thank you so much for bringing
house Bill 163 forward this
morning. I'm representing the
National Alliance on mental
illness in New Mexico. We stand
in strong support of house Bill
163 Anything that we can do
today in New Mexico to create
equity and
Try to bring in and make things
easier for our providers is
essential to the ongoing
behavioral health services for
the mentally ill and those with
disabilities. Madam Chair
members of the committee, our
National Partners for NAMI,
We're here this past week, and
they are also working on similar
issues across the country. So
this is not only a new issue for
New Mexico it is for the United
States entirely. So
Thank you, representative
Garcia, which is gracias.
Keep up the fight and members of
the committee. Thank you. So
much for supporting house. Bill
163. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Keep up the fight and members of
the committee. Thank you So much
for supporting house. Bill 163.
Thank you, madam. Dear Patsy.
Next we have
Carrie blunder, Go ahead.
Good morning, madam chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Carrie, Robin Bruner and
the registered lobbyists for the
New Mexico Medical Society. We
very much support the expansion
of the types of providers that
can use the rural health care
tax credit positions are part of
a system and they cannot do
their jobs without all of the
support around them. That's
necessary to get could care to
patients.
We also would like to point out
that hours change that's in the
legislation. We think this hours
change in order to be eligible
for the tax credit is very
important as it allows our
clinicians to take vacation
during the year, which is
important to fight against
burnout. So we know that people
are working full time, but we
also want them to be able to
appreciate their families and
take some time off but still
qualify for the credit. So
that's a fix that we've been
waiting for for a long time, and
we very much appreciate it that
it's in the bill. Thank you so
much, Madam Chair.
Thank you anymore on zoom, so
representative, Do you have any
comments before recommendation,
Okay. And representatives since
since you went a little off
topic, So am I just, um, hearing
about the physical therapists
their their program at you,
which I believe has 30.
Um and they're getting
accredited this year and every
they get accredited every 10
years and this is the only time
we can expand the program, but
we need to find $800,000. Too
bad. Our appropriations members
aren't here. But if you can
tweak your your colleague, many
people would be appreciative. So
we'll go to the committee for
questions.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative Garcia. Uh,
Um
Had, uh, look at additional and
And and they put and and so I go
after those recommendations, and
in this particularly, but that's
what got the bill out of tax
committee list their son on that
about to change that that
profession you know, because
it'll probably put up the same
fight if we don't include it in
the bill.
You know, So that's how we've
gotten to this. Thank you, Madam
Chair and I just like to read,
you know
All the way up to the paramedic
level. That's a two year degree.
You know, I think that they
probably should be.
Like that.
My second question, Madam chair
is how do we think this will
effect part time practice?
And will it encourage?
Definitely
You know we have in the so
that's that in itself, and if it
falls in within the new that
that credit category Thank you,
madam.
Lord and then Jones. Anyone
else? Okay, Go ahead,
Representative Lord.
I thank you, representing
Albuquerque.
Um, of we just expect everyone
to very difficult.
Um, I do want to ask this an
overall.
So I remember this that it went
through.
Uh, the changes that you're
making in here is that based on
feedback that we have before US
So that should hopefully be an
indicator to just two
Too bloated.
And that that's why her projects
like the film credits, you know
also, so we're hoping that the
strategy this year
Madam Sharon and I hope that
with the changes that you made
because in all honesty when you
look at
Every time I'm in health, or I
see so I did have I do have some
questions for you.
Online third, we start with a
new language.
And have provided healthcare
during a taxable year with at
least
1000
584 hours of practice. So you're
asking, so that's that's what
we're looking at, right? We're
looking at
The regular credit is that they
work that many hours per taxable
years.
Mm. Chair and representative
Lord
To be, uh, to be allotted, but
that might
What solidified to buy to
qualify. Okay, because the way
we had it in the past
Was we had 1000 and 80.
In that 2080 is what knocked out
the nurse registered nurses
because they're on a different
All right. Thank you. That that
explained it. I was wondering
what and is there a day? This is
their definition. I didn't see
it. Or if you could at least
tell me what
Madam Chair number two. It says
healthcare underserved area,
Okay?
Thank you, Madam Sheriff. I was
looking for under changing that
at all.
Um, okay and then Madam chair
and then said in the park, which
we had all those
For at least 792 hours. Is that
But less is that work work
working hours represent, madam.
I'm sorry. When when you're
talking If you could please give
us page numbers and lines on
page two line nine lining Madam
Chair, Representative Lord, how
those hours work So originally
in the bill, it was 2008 d O h
had created a work around.
Because they knew, you know
people got to have some vacation
some time off, but the state so
that's one of the reasons more
hours than the and middle and
and the, uh, the halftime but a
lot of people will live in an
urban area, but they'll go work
work in an office.
In a rural area and they can get
the tax credit. It's not where
you live. It's where you work,
and so if you're a nurse who
lives in Albuquerque, but you
want to drive to work, then you
will still get the tax credit
based on the number of hours so
this will make it easier for D O
H because you have to
You have to prove your hours to
d O h. They've got a whole
packet. They have to say yes.
You are eligible for submit that
when showing that you are
eligible, and then that form so
Then you fill out that form. Who
does it goes to deal with that
tax credit to you form form that
So I wanted to say on Page five.
Line five F
The department shall completed
annual report that looks like
you're going to hate because
that means they'll have, so I
appreciate so much on Page six
on
We're
I
I didn't see them added back and
we're osteopathic physicians.
Oh, excuse me, Representative
Lord, the osteopathic physicians
are now under the medical
practice Act, so they fall under
the board of Medicine. So they
are covered. Okay. Thank you. I
was. I figured that was
somewhere else. I didn't think
you were crossing them out. I
just figured there were some
Okay?
And then where can I find? I
guess manager at work. Where can
I go and trying to figure out
who makes a decision about rural
areas? Who is the person? Let
him chair. Um, that was
something I asked early in the
rest of that night, rural county
or unincorporated area of
partially rural County as
designated
By the health. Forget Torrance
County because you guys keep
forgetting Torrance County and
thank you, Madam Chair. That's
all the questions
Thank you.
Oh, really? Wow, madam Chair up
on this and for the opportunity
and
Is any different board on House
bill was
Representative Cates Yes.
Representative Ferrari. Yes.
Representative Jones.
Representative Lord
Yes, and good luck.
Representative Vincent Yes.
Madam chair.
Yes.
By a vote of 8 to 0. You have a
do pass on how
Okay. Next, we will go to house
Bill 165. Representative
Armstrong is here. Somehow she
escaped from appropriations.
Was I
Representative Armstrong is
appropriations finished. I
didn't think so.
Great necklace, by the way,
Ready, representative.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Committee members. I can't
say that I missed this
committee. But I I know you all
have heavy lift as we all do
Crazy times today, all of us
being pulled in a lot of
different directions, And so I
have to apologize to
appropriations for not being
there. But
Sometimes our legislative, um
the votes will be what they are
in the appropriation here that
bill on the floor, so I may miss
that boat. So my apologies, but
I really need to be here and
appreciate you scheduling this
madam chair.
So with me, I have, um
Today. Dr Ash, pharmacist,
pharmacist and owner of Care
drug in Bloomfield in Aztec, New
Mexico, Dr. Seyfarth has
executive, um, knowledge in this
field as the chair of the
current president of the New
Mexico Pharmacists Association
and a newly elected vice
president of the national she
has presented to the Federal
Trade Commission.
Regarding a
Of PBMs practices and has worked
with it in Mexico office of the
superintendent of insurance.
To be a point of reference, as
well as presented to the LFC
committee. She also was
appointed to the governor's
prescription drug task force a
couple of years ago, doctors say
fourth
Employees just over 20 people in
her communities where they take
care of thousands of rural
patients.
And are the frontline providers
today, Madam Chair Hospital 165.
The purpose of it is to bring
the Legislature to bring to the
legislatures attention.
Um which I think we've has all
been brought. We've heard this
several times in for sure. Over
the interim, um, the need to
provide support for our
community based pharmacies,
especially in rural New Mexico,
Um, New Mexico. Rural New Mexico
pharmacies that provide
invaluable quality frontline
healthcare services to the
communities that they serve.
And it is also about fairness.
And I think if any of you know
me well, which I think most of
you do, I am all about fairness.
Um, it doesn't to me. It doesn't
matter what side of the aisle
you're on. It's about what's
fair, um, in 2022, New Mexico
had about 70 community based
pharmacies.
Left in the in the state.
Currently we now have 55.
Um, I know we've lost some in
northern New Mexico. I know. I
lost one in Socorro.
And now we have. Walmart is what
we have in Sikora is the closest
one unless you go to Las Lunas,
where there's a Walgreens and
some other choices, But last
Leanness is almost two hours
from my house.
And so that's just bringing to
light. What the issue is. There
are a number of factors pain,
uh, playing into this growing
concern, however, pharmacy
benefit managers or PBMs are the
entities that ultimately dictate
the reimbursement. Focus.
Legislative this
Focused legislation will provide
Continually.
Um
Continuity. Excuse me that will
provide continuity and disperse
dispensing fees with Medicaid.
Managed care contracts, drug
prices and, um for some small
business pharmacists who have
purchased
Who purchased and dispense those
drugs have seen the opposite in
their reimbursement through
Medicaid programs, the result in
compounding losses to their
businesses and add adds to the
current day.
Uh, difficulties of
Adequately serving their
patients medication needs and
keeping their doors open for
long term. And with that, madam
chair I'd like to see if
Doctors say fourth would like to
add anything.
You, Madam chair and members of
the committee. You guys did hear
us last year we tried to get it
through, but we'll see what we
can do this year. Um, always
enough time crunch, right?
This bill is very basically does
gives us fairness in our
contracts when you leave things
up to the PBMs to dictate that
means that we don't get paid as
a business owner. We have to
have some kind of reimbursement
and the losses that we're taking
this bill sets the reimbursement
for the community based
pharmacies, so only the
community based pharmacies.
So we're talking 55 of us.
Um, this sets it at a national
Methodology, so a national
payment
That is tracked through a system
with the feds.
And then it allows for an
adequate dispensing fee that
dispensing fee covers our
overhead. Now granted, profit
has become an awful word in this
world Profits. Our PBMs are in
the top five fortune 500. How
did they're going to pay us?
And so
This sets a a set dispensing fee
that H. S D will be asked to
provide a study ongoing. The
FBI, the F I, R says annually,
but that is not correct every
time they go to renegotiate
current dispensing fee set at
$10.30 right now, the PBMs
within the M C. O s do not have
to abide by that.
And so that's what this is
asking for.
The dispensing fee at right now
at the 1030 was set in 2017
right now from 2007.
Additionally, it just asked that
if them over the last couple of
years cleaned up still a few
pharmacies that are closing that
need to be pulled off of there,
But for the most part, they're
doing it quarterly right now.
Yes, ma'am, We stand for
questions in opposition. And if
you are a who here is in
opposite opposition.
On Zoom, No one on zoom so we
will go to the again on Zoom if
you are want to speak in
support, please raise your hand.
And in the room, we will take
10. People on Zoom five, so
people who are here in support
if even if you don't want to,
um, speak, you raise your hand.
Okay. Thank you. And if you want
to speak in support, we will
start on this side.
Go ahead.
House Bill 165.
Thank you. And I just got a text
that
Focus on Zoom can't hear.
What? Um the person who texted
me. We're working on it.
We know anyone else in the
audience who wants to speak
okay? And hopefully on zoom. You
can hear us. If not, we'll
figure something out. So, uh,
let's go to zoom.
Danny Cross.
Madam chair members of the
committee, uh, as a practicing
pharmacists and business owner
in New Mexico, this
reimbursement equity will be
huge in helping us to continue
to serve our population of
Medicaid patients. This is a
very important time for small
community pharmacies as we are
under tremendous financial
pressure, so
I just ask that you support this
important piece of legislation.
Thank you is
Jenna.
Hi, Madam Chair. This is Jenna
Dumb Czarsky, Rios and
Lovington. New Mexico. Um, we
serve multiple communities
around us that, um are small
communities that have to travel
at least 30 minutes to even get
into town, and we have over 50%
of Medicaid patients, and this
would be a tremendous help to
us. We've also helped to
decrease ER visits by the test
to trade options as well. So,
um, we provide Vinnie services.
For patients to help with
decrease medication fees as
well.
Thank you And I'm in support of
this bill.
Thank you. Next. We have
Jeffrey Stewart, go ahead.
Hello, Manager and members of
the committee just wanted to
show my support for house. But
165 I'm a local pharmacist and
business owner down here in Las
Cruces, New Mexico, and just to
kind of echo everything that
you've heard. Um you know, this
means a lot for us as far as
rule.
Rural, um, independent
pharmacies go. Um And it means a
lot to the patients as well. So
thank you so much for reviewing
it and thank you so much for its
support.
Thank you, Jeremy Jeffrey.
Oh, Patsy, Go ahead.
Madam chair members of the
committee. Patsy Romero. I'm
standing representing the
National Alliance on Mental
illness in New Mexico and for
all of the reasons stated this
morning, Madam chair, we stand
in full support, and we thank
the sponsor for bringing this
legislation forward. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Patsy. Any any
comments, or should we just go
to the committee? Okay,
Representative Vincent Lord.
Okay, go ahead.
Thank you, Madam Chair and and
I've got. I've got one. They're
burning on fumes. And I heard
you say that there was was it
155 was there 100 and 55, and
there's 70 left. No, Madam
Chair. There was 70. There's
about 5555 left and out of that
55. I bet some of them are
burning. So, madam chair.
As a freshman.
Trying to figure out the
complexity of the drug. How it
all works as very much a
challenge for me and fairly
decent now, But I don't know if
I'm but on page two line 22
through 25 of the bill require
HC a D to compile a list of all
community based pharmacy
providers.
In the state and published this
on the website. The purpose of
this and are we trying
Madam Chart.
Thank you, madam Chair
representative, Um, that list
was actually set by our governor
when she took office. Um, the
purpose of it is at the time we
had met with her.
To really advocate for the
independence.
To have an increase in
dispensing that was to figure
out and and create this list.
The list is maintained based on
Um, which is just data that we
submit to the state, and that's
how they track the claims and
where they're coming from. And
so that list specifically was
created by the governor in order
just to
Make sure that our invited at
the time
So while it doesn't specifically
encourage people to utilize
since
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair and you
know for the local pharmacies
that's listened to this webcast.
It looks like, um
There's a bill or
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you Represent. Thank you,
Doctor. Um
I did healthcare building. I
just build a 902 to 1 and I
built it for $100. And if we're
in network we get 70 were always
very frustrated with Medicaid
all the way around. Um, but
If I'm because we
Our analysts made this. It's
just
It's so convoluted need to speak
up a little bit because people
say they can't hear me at home.
Um
So if I understand correctly,
With health care.
The insurance company says this
is what we're going to pay. But
with the pharmaceuticals it's
the PBM that dictates the
reimbursement.
Madam chair I would like to have
My expert witness explained the
process of that.
Yeah, and and French
representative. It's okay if she
just answers. Okay. Thank you.
Whoever takes it
And and for a kindergartner.
Yeah. Um, do my best. Madame
Sherry representative. It's It
is a very complicated system.
Um, but to put the short of it,
we actually don't contract with
the PBMs. Could you say what
PBM? Can you apologize? Yes,
it's the pharmacy benefit
managers. If you see their new
commercials, they're trying to
get rid of that awful name
they've created and that
companies now
But in all reality, they are
still the PBMs.
Um, what they do is they
contract with the pharmacies?
Through a number of mechanisms.
Decide what you pay as a co pay
when you go to the pharmacy.
They decide how much I should
have purchased the drug for they
decide how much they're going to
reimburse me for that drug and
then they also decide whether or
not I should be not, and so when
you leave it to them.
They decide not to pay on a lot
of those factors. And so this is
the piece very hard with HST.
To really educate everybody in
that system, and they they've
heard us and they've really been
very helpful in understanding
now the issues when you leave it
in 2019. I believe when the
governor took office, we were
currently being reimbursed 35
cents as a professional
dispensing fee.
Um, until she heard our stories
of like representative
Vincent said of living off
fumes.
And she gave us a $2 raise. So
for the last four or five years,
however long $2.35
For the mandated community based
pharmacy dispensing fee.
However, CMS states and exempt
states that should be more like
1030. That is what we're asking
for.
So
They dictate pretty much
everything. And so this bill
makes it where not only HST will
have some transparency and the
drug prices and costs.
Because it will be very
straightforward. It's based off
of a national number for that
drug National drug code.
That payment plus a professional
dispensing fee.
Just to make sure it's clear our
professional dispensing fee not
only pays for my staff our time
and educating the patients on
their medications, it also pays
for the lid. The vial, the label
everything that goes into
filling that prescription.
There's no profit, even made up
in that dispensing fee.
We are literally asking.
So
Do you okay? Venture?
Representative doctors. So do
they make the rates different
for if you're Walgreens?
Madam Chair representative. Yes.
Okay. And I'm gonna bet Madam
Chair representative their lives
in the problem, do they?
Give more to they do they,
Izzard.
As we all know, Mom and pop a
way different than corporations.
Corporate Office of a CBS in
Edgewood can afford to take
losses because they're going to
make benefits somewhere else.
Mom and pop. Do not
Do they take that into
consideration that if you're in
Moriarty, this is your only
income 2000 stores across the
United States.
Or how did the PBMs come up with
this formulation of how to
reimburse you?
Madam chair represent their
methodologies and how they do
Um one thing I can say there
have been several studies out
there. I can't quote them off
the top of my head, so I
apologize.
That have shown on the state of
Arkansas, I believe actually has
a clause within their PBM act,
their law that says that they
are not allowed to reimburse
themselves Pharmacy or their
affiliates. We do not have that
in the state of New Mexico.
And so I cannot, but you are
correct.
Most mom and pop independent
pharmacies do not float our
pharmacies with a liquor store.
We don't sell tobacco products
and maybe we're totally ignorant
for not at this point. Totally
honest, um
But we know that you know,
Walmart has even stated that
they bring people into their
stores because they have you
know the losses with their
pharmacies. They have admitted
that their pharmacies lose
money, but they're not in it for
that the contracts that they
have done
Have reciprocated to us who
don't have those big and so yes,
we are only target and affect
the community pharmacies. For
those reasons we are not
situationally the same.
Exactly Thank you. Madam
Chairman said that its exact
point I was getting to doctor
that you guys are not the same.
You don't have coupons and idea
makes more money. But
It's it's not even about these
guys can afford to take losses.
They can afford to lose money
and the pharmacy if they have
to, because that's not what
matters. They're trying to just
bring people into the store to
buy. It's not even about the
equity. It's about the mom and
pop.
Pharmacies should get even more
So with this bill, Madam chair,
Bring equality. Is that what
you're looking for? That we want
to be?
Madam Chair representative. This
bill is there.
Reimbursements. That's pretty
much it. I would argue with you,
Madam Chairperson, Dr. That's
the problem with
Thanks especially in New Mexico,
You know, And now we don't have
a pharmacy. You have to go into
the big box stores that are down
at Albuquerque. Madam Chair. Can
I just add one thing really
quick? You know, it's to me. Um,
I don't want to bash corporate
I don't want to bash anyone. All
I want is fairness.
And so it's It's not about the
big, ugly box store. It's not
about this poor small mom and
pop. What it's about is
fairness County.
Um
So, madam chair.
Okay? I had a question.
It was about okay?
So on Page three line 11.
So what we're looking at for
them to be community. They're
not government owned. They're
not hospital owned.
They're not owned by a
corporation owns hospitals.
They're not extension of that.
And then five owned by a
corporation change pharmacies
with stores outside the state so
that would still mentors and
leave open. If somebody was very
six direct
Madam Chair representative.
That's correct.
Stifle growth. I think the
biggest owner so we really don't
have any more growth other than
that, but we didn't want to
stifle this right and mentorship
and I would I'm I'm glad that
you have that drafted. I'm going
to open a pharmacy similar to
the um making, but it's so
important to me that's
accessible, so having to go all
the way down into the city. Um
and then when you said
And I remember what page was on
that there would be a list of
the prices. Where does that
Madam Chair Representative Lord,
the NATO back pricing structure?
Um
I mean, I converse some, but it
is out there and it is a
national database based system.
Um, but you have to have its
drug code in order to research
it very transparent way. It's
not perfect. There are problems
and issues with it.
But it's the most nationally
recognized, UM, Chairman,
representative doctor, I
wouldn't expect it's a
government thing, and that's how
we roll with stuff.
I think I support this bill I
just had was happening so that
also a lot of times because I
have a lot of people that listen
to ruin was happening in New
Mexico. Great and there's a lot
of arrows. And if that to try to
explain on the price of this, so
thank you very much. Madam
Chair. Thank you for allowing me
to co sponsor this bill, and,
uh, I know that that every world
communities having these
challenges, and this will prove
and and that's really what we're
Um, healthcare, So thank you
again, and I appreciate motion.
Madam chair, like make a motion.
Okay, so pass moved by
representative Chavez.
Is there any opposition?
And you have a do past 90.
Representative and Senator, are
you already?
Go ahead.
And if I could ask the audience
to please, um
Keep down the conversation and
be sure to put your phone
members staff and public to
please put your phone on silent
is House Bill 17 uses
And it's been over two year that
died from alcohol related. We
start a new year to count one
person every four and the number
of the friends and relatives
keeps growing. It doesn't have
to be this way and for a miracle
quarter of drink increased
excise tax. We can raid
treatment programs that will
make a difference.
And the policies. Considerable
research shows it is in itself a
deterrent to underage drinking
and reduces consumption by
excessive and heavy drinkers.
The toll.
One drink has on our state is
$3.74 per drink and healthcare
costs lost wages, damages and
more for a total cost of $2.2
billion annually or over $1000
for every person in New Mexico.
And this isn't a regressive tax
48% of adults don't drink at
all, and those who are excessive
or heavy drinkers by income
levels from $54 for those, and
these are estimates.
$54 for those with an income to
$63 for those with incomes
greater than 70. It would most
importantly, provide more
services for those at the lower
income levels, making it a
progressive. Other policy
changes can be made to but
raising the liquor excise tax,
which hasn't been done for 30
years.
Is the most immediate and
effective solution. We have to
start saving the a small price
to pay. The reduction in
consumption will help reduce
domestic violence, sexual
assault homicides and all the
alcohol related.
Share the mike. I'd like to ask
Senator one of the co sponsors
Senator Pinto to go first, or
are you ready? Or would you want
me to go first? Okay. Sorry. Um,
motion for her to move over and
okay?
Okay, This is, uh this came. Um
So I, um
I think it's really important to
understand New Mexico to deal
with misuse and we are not going
to move the needle in New Mexico
on most, until we get a handle.
on the end, the other addictions
that we have in this state and
good alcohol programs can also
deal with
Um, I want to draw your
attention to page
11 and 12 of the bill.
The very less sentence online
23 line 23 when appropriating
the funds, the Legislature shall
prioritize community based
initiatives that address the
needs of disproportionately
impacted by excessive alcohol
use and are working to reduce
health disparities.
The reason that's important is
because the problems with
alcohol hit more heavily in our
communities that have fewer
resources to deal with them. And
so we think it's really
important to raise the funds.
This bill would raise I believe
that the tax the the F. I
estimate it's going to race
between 202 150, maybe $275
million.
That will make a lot of a big
step in the direction of trying
to deal with the problem in our
state. The primary thing we're
trying to do with this bill is
to raise up programs that will
meet the needs of our state. Um
another and alcohol programs
work.
And these programs will protect
against against so many harms,
including health harms alcohol,
liver disease. Motor vehicle
crashes, trashes, intimate
partner violence, even gun
violence and homicide.
So it's really important that we
have these programs.
Now we have been asked. Oh, we
have so much money now. Well, we
know that the money that we have
with oil and with experience of
the up and down in oil and gas
that we've had over the last few
decades. What we know is these
programs are the first programs
to get cut.
And I think it shows absolutely.
She's problems with that. I'd
like to
You're good with what I said.
Well, I just want to add. I just
want to add that we did. We did
talk to tribes and we
specifically the bill
specifically anagrams. And the
reason that's important is the
tribes told us when you have
these, they're not. They're not
as um, effect Civically included
that in this bill so that parts
of this money would go directly
to the tribes.
And now we'd like to introduce,
our expert says Cindy Stockman.
Thank you, Madam Chair Committee
members. I wanted to thank the
sponsors for bringing this issue
critical issue forward. Um my
name is invisible. O'Neill
Stockelman. I am in any
evaluator with 20 years in the
field, and I'm also the director
and co founder of the New Mexico
tribal behavior, health
providers.
New Mexico has had the highest
alcohol related deaths since
1997 and we've been 1st 2nd or
third since 1981.
And in 2021, we reached our all
time high losing 2276 lives.
And as representative for
already mentioned, that's losing
someone a loved one every four
hours. Women's alcohol related
deaths are also on the rise.
Um, recent CDC study shows that
women are during been shrinking
and heavy drinking at higher
rates, and that gender gap is
closing at a rapid state.
One in five deaths are for are
among those 20 to 64, which are
working aged adults.
In fact, more people die from
alcohol than any other.
Um, substance twice as high.
Alcohol is a silent killer.
It causes physical and mental
health deterioration.
A lot of people think of of
alcohol related harms and they
think
Car crash fatalities.
But in reality, these are
chronic conditions. Long lasting
liver disease, heart conditions.
Intimate partner violence.
Things that really impact not
only the substance, the person
that is addicted to a substance
but also to the family and
community that they reside in.
In 2023, the Department of
Health
Estimated that 73,000 new
Mexicans are not receiving
treatment, but they needed
This cost.
Cost our state billions of
dollars a year.
Our state continues to face the
gap in services from early
prevention through long term
treatment.
We are lacking, so we're living
facilities, which have led many
tribal relatives to be
victimized and take into Arizona
under false preset pretenses and
left to die.
We need a variety of programs to
address this urgent issue.
And we need them across the
state.
We need to get ahead of the
issue through prevention.
We need to implement early
prevention.
To delay the onset of use.
This last year. We had a
grassroots, um
Grassroots effort with public
health advocates and community
providers.
And we were able to come up with
a list when we asked them. What
do you need in your community In
order to address alcohol related
harms?
They gave us a list. We work
with the Department of Health
and the department secretaries
and those, um, and their
considerations are included in
the list of proposed
programming.
And with that I will pass it to
my colleague.
Thank you so much, madam
Chairwoman.
Representatives on the
committee. My distinguished
colleagues.
My name is Marlena Lira. I'm a
substance use researcher and the
director of research at work at
Health.
My M. P. H s and epidemiology
and I'm also a doctoral student
in health policy at Johns
Hopkins today. I'm speaking as a
private citizen and direct
So to build on what
representative Ferrari senator
city of Lopez and Miss Melania
Stockmen were saying.
We have a really big problem,
and it touches on some of the
issues that we have been hearing
from throughout the day with
rural health with sexual
violence, alcohol is connected
to so many important health
conditions.
The good news, though, is that
alcohol policies work?
And my own research has shown
the protective effects of
alcohol policies on health
outcomes, including suicide
homicide, including gun involved
deaths and intimate partner
homicide, motor vehicle crash
fatalities, and even recently, a
new paper came out that I co
authored
On the relationship between
alcohol policies and
disciplinary actions on college
campuses involving alcohol and
sexual assault on college
raising alcohol excise taxes is
a CDC recommended strategy and
one of the most effective
Increasing the price of alcohol
has had success elsewhere.
For example, after Scotland
increased alcohol prices they
saw 13% decrease in mortality
and these effects were
concentrated in low.
HB 179 would increase alcohol to
excise taxes in New Mexico and
as we've heard would generate
over $200 million annually for
dedicated and consistent alcohol
prevention and treatment
services.
So what I'd like to do is
actually walk through two
examples with you to think about
what this might look like in
practice were saying 25 cents a
drink. But what does that mean?
So I'd like to point you to the
packet that you received and I
have two example scenarios. So
the first one and these are
using real prices. I went on
Walmart's website last night.
Um, you can
Buy a six pack of Coronas at the
Santa Fe, WalMart for $9.73.
So let's think just think
through.
What alcohol Excise taxes
currently look like and what
we're proposing. So right now,
the tax on beer comes down to
about four cents per drink.
We're proposing raising it by 25
cents. So four plus nine is 29.
That would bring the total tax
on a six pack of beer up from
measly 24 cents, right now up to
a dollar 74 cents If we assume a
pass through of one and passed
through refers to kind of the
rate that actual consumers see
So we would expect this six pack
of beer to go from $9.73 to
about $11.23. Let's turn it to
the other side. Here's another
example also from WalMart, um
and an expensive bottle of wine
from Oakley. Fin Yeard sits
$3.46.
Right now. The current tax
collected from this bottle is
only 35 cents, and we would be
increasing it by a dollar 25,
bringing the expected price to
496 and similarly, if somebody
bought a bottle of wine in a
restaurant, they would see it.
I'm sorry. A glass of wine they
would see it increase again. 25
cents.
So this very modest increase
could have really wonderful
benefits with that. I think I'm
going to pass it.
I think that's kind of the end
Unless a pass it to the chair.
Thank you.
Thank you, Um, madam Chair with
that will stand for questions.
Thank you first, if you are on
zoom in opposition, please raise
your hands. We will go to the
folks in the room and then come
back to the focus on Zoom one
minute timer on your comments.
So in the room if you are an
opposite
Okay. And if you would like to
speak, we'll start on this side
and just kind of move to your
left.
Our members are hundreds and
hundreds of small business
owners throughout the state.
They have smaller
Fueling stations a lot of them
in rural areas.
Remembers, and our customers are
typically lower income.
Our customers were telling us
they feel like this piece of
legislation penalize them
because they believe 95 90% of
current packs.
Alcohol that goes into the
blue jacket. Okay? You're
members of the committee
representing this
Very responsible adults
Harmoko, what is much less
clear? Yes.
But the bill
Tories will go out of this.
Brent are members of the
commission to this bill. Bill
problem Treasures
I wouldn't think very straight
up, and traditionally New Mexico
has been in that higher range,
if not the highest taxes are
already move forward into the
1%.
Hospital 179 because of it, Um
at a time when the state has
restaurants collect nearly with
extremely high priced at new
Mexicans are already paying. Ah,
um
Our members are committed
spending every dime.
Collected on prevention and
treatment of problem drinking
rather than sending half of it
Thank you. Okay. We'll go to the
back and then Good morning,
madam Chair. Members of the
committee on Pat Block
registered lobbyists for the New
Mexico Alcohol Alliance. It's a
group of business and liquor
license owners. We I rise to
express something Currently
we're generating $50 million a
year for, uh, in alcohol excise
tax. Half of it goes to the
General fund. We feel like that
could be directed to programs
were also concerned that raising
such a substantial amount in
place would lead us to, you
know, in four years or sitting
on a billion dollars, not
working.
If
The programs that don't exist
today are not developed and
implemented by then. So Scott
Okay, so
Okay. No hands raised on zoom.
Okay, So if you are in support
of this bill on zoom, raise your
hand and we will go to the room
and come back to you. So, folks
in the raise your hand.
And I have a little you know
what? Let's uh I have a list of
folks who have signed up and
we'll see how we're doing on
time after that.
Shelly Manne lived.
Members. Video. Thank you so
much for the opportunity to
Steak.
Have to
30 years increase.
Revenues available to provide
programs, prevention, treatment
and support. We have an
incredible opportunity as our
death rate continues to crime.
Over 2000 people now.
Over 2000 serious and meaningful
over two programs prevention
like home visiting
All the helpers. We said local
culturally appropriate and I
really urge you to consider the
The county seat and our own
Department of Health, saying
This is the first
Thank you. Next. We have Cynthia
Lentini on the road.
Oh, not in here because there's
not a chair.
Or okay, we will go on and then
come back to center. Yeah.
Downfalls of this tiny room.
And I apologize creations needed
their room to work on the
budget, and we will also
So while we're waiting for
Cynthia, let's go to Janet
Williams.
Thank you, Maggie McGowan.
Oh, she's okay. Well, Maggie, if
you're on zoom will come back to
you.
Um Chanel Delgado.
Good morning, sheriff.
Identified community members
Thank you.
I'm speaking for the veteran
addiction problems.
More than the general population
For all the reasons stated, Uh,
welcome to the senator, the
representative and I energy.
Yep. Weeks. Thank you. Next. We
have, um Jonathan Juanico.
In my opinion.
The way I see it.
To me.
That's already a high price. And
if you if you are willing to put
that people would still pay that
price, Ah, and also be made
aware of the fact that there are
willing to put that people would
still pay that price. Ah, and
also be made aware of the fact
that their time supporting Thank
you. Thank you.
So we will go to zoom.
Um
12 people. We will take the
first as is our policy, and it's
for one minute. So Judy Williams
go ahead.
Thank you, Madam Chair members
of the committee. My name is
Judy Williams. I represent the
legal women Voters of New
Mexico. We strongly support this
legislation even though it is
not a progressive tax. We can
support of regressive tax if
it's in a social interest, which
we believe this is, among other
things, this would create a
dedicated source of funding for
services, which is sorely needed
in this state.
And with the money I think the
services will come. Thank you
very much.
Thank you.
Next.
Athena. Go ahead.
Hi. Um, thank you, Madam Chair
and committee members. My name
is Athena. Our Huckabee. I hold
a masters in public health
degree. I am in recovery from
alcohol use disorder myself
Since 2012 and I also work in
drug and alcohol treatment here
in New Mexico. Um, I strongly
support HB 179. I want to point
out the fact that the alcohol
tax
This does perhaps to some seem
like a large jump, but these
taxes have not been raised in
over 30 years, and we're needing
to catch up if they had been
raised, you know, every couple
of legislative sessions during
that time, we would already be
here. Um, I work with
individuals, specifically women
in recovery, mentoring them and
struggle always to find adequate
treatment resources.
All of our treatment is
overburdened. Much of it has
long wait lists. Sober living is
difficult to find, especially
for women with Children. And I
believe that this dedicated fund
that I happened would make it
possible to find more treatment
and recovery resources for women
and Children who need it in our
community. And I appreciate you
hearing me. Thank you.
Next. We have
Laurie be Hill.
Hi. Um, my name is Laurie. First
of all.
Thank you, madam chair and
community member Committee
members. My name is I am with
the symbol of substance Abuse
prevention coalition. Um, I'm
from a very rural community and
w elaborate are through the roof
and have been for years I work
with adults and youth that are
very addicted to alcohol. And
Saturday they and their families
are victims to liver disease.
Diabetes and other other
disorders. Alcohol plays a huge
role, um in factors such as, and
that was spoken about child
abuse, sexual assault, mental
health disorders, domestic
violence. Wi crashes, Um, death
due to two d wi crashes and
domestic violence.
If folks do not receive the help
and education, um that is is so
so needed.
Um, then continues. So if the
liquor excise tax is risen, that
in itself will provide funding
for more educational prevention.
And, um, treatment programs for
our elementary Children, our
youth, our families.
Um, that involved in this very,
very vicious struggle. Thank
you, Laurie.
Enrique Go ahead.
Hello. My name is Enrique.
Kardian. Thank you, madam Chair
in
And committee members. I am the
director of the health equity
counselor in Albuquerque,
Bernalillo County.
And I am here in strong support
of this, Um
This needs to happen so that we
can create
The services.
That are required. We don't have
the funds now to get services
off the ground. And so those
funds need to come from
somewhere they need to be
dedicated.
And as someone who outside of my
day job.
Is also a musician. I understand
that
Most places where people pay for
music, uh or places that serve
alcohol. And I think that, uh,
folks who support
Live music and local music
would, um
Be able to withstand the small
increase that is being proposed.
Thank you.
And then and then we will go
back to Maggie McGowan if she's
on because she was okay. So
Alicia and then Maggie and then
Good morning, madam chair and
committee members. My name is Dr
Lisa Sparks. I am the chair of
the U. S. Alcohol Policy
Alliance, which is an actual
nonprofit, committed to reducing
alcohol related harms, and she
is in public health with a focus
specifically on alcohol policy.
I'm here today to speak in
strong support of this bill. We
know alcohol taxes save lives,
particularly critical in New
Mexico, who has the unfortunate
title of the highest rate of
alcohol related deaths in the US
That's how that title for the
past 20 years. As you heard
earlier, alcohol and, um, six of
10 leading causes of death are
related to alcohol in the state.
The proposed tax could reduce
alcohol consumption by 10%,
which I was significant impact
on the death toll. You're going
to hear that this bill is
regressive, but I really want to
reiterate that it is not, um
alcohol taxes are particularly
effective and that they affect
the heaviest drinkers in our
society.
So it's affecting those who
drink women who drink eight or
more drinks per week, and men
who drink more than 15 gigs per
week, and, in fact, alcohol
taxes provide opportunities to
reduce help, reduce health
disparities and fun necessary
program to support communities
Those at risk of harm encouraged
the committee to support this
bill in an effort to save the
lives of thousands of new
Mexicans.
Thank you. Next. We have Maggie
McGowan.
Good morning, madam chair and
members of the committee. I'm
Maggie McAllen. And I am the
executive director of the New
Mexico Behavior Health Providers
Association.
I'd like to think representative
Ferrari, particularly for her.
Continued effort and commitment
to this issue, as well as her
team of experts and advocates.
Um, I couldn't hear every every,
uh, set of comments from the
presenters that are in the room.
So if I repeat myself or they
repeating what they said, I
apologize. Just a couple of
comments to the members of the
committee. We urge passage of
this bill.
I think it without a doubt you
can look around the room and
listen to people and feel like
and understand that new Mexicans
really want this bill. They need
this bill. Everyone who has been
impacted by alcoholism knows
that it is treatable. It is a
disease and I suspect that if we
were in the room talking about
the opportunity we had to wipe
out or really significantly
minimize cancer.
With the kind of investment it's
being made or being requested. I
suspect that there wouldn't be
this kind of opposition. And so
I strongly recommend that you
see this as a disease. It is
treatable and the future is
bright if we can take advantage
of this opportunity on behalf of
the Provider association have 70
organizations Behavioral Health
Organization statewide.
Um, we have probably 10 to 15
that are dedicated solely to
substance Use, or I thank you,
Maggie.
Now any comment
Just being in court on terror.
Thank you will will address some
of the things in question. Okay.
Thank you. So thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you. Okay. So the
first question I have so looking
at the F I R.
It was on Page two. I want to
understand based on based on all
the information that they do,
but it, it said, with the 14th
highest tax rate for alcohol.
And this is going to increase
beer by 600. So if we have the
highest tax rate on alcohol
Where's that money going now?
And can't that be used with?
Um Then I believe that madam
chair we will have a high rate
do not have the highest rate.
Now, um, and when you're
talking and when you, um when
you're talking about half a
penny
Go home. I don't think it's
realistic to 650%. That's it's
meaningless when we and the
average consumer will pay
between 10 and $25. In addition,
I wanted to make the point that
distributors, including an
higher Spencer Bush.
Sell alcohol much more cheaply
in this state than they do in
cost. Distributors know what
they're doing. It is only a tax
that is going to make our
alcohol.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So, uh,
can you on page
So we're gonna put this to the
alcohol harm. Can you tell me
more about this out? Who's
directing it? Where this money
would go to
Madam chair. I'll refer to my
experts from now on you just
whoever grabbed the mic and just
a side note for our committee
assistance. We if we are when we
are in here on Wednesday to mix
for manager representatives, the
Alcohol Harms Alleviation fund
is going to list of programming.
That was that was the grassroots
efforts that I hadn't mentioned
earlier.
So we developed along with
coalitions and community
partners, A list of prevention
and treatment needs across our
state.
And that list was then taken to
the secretary to the secretaries
And to the health care, the
health authority, Um, to develop
a comprehensive list of
programming programming will
include things like home
visitation, early prevention
treatment, sober living
facilities. The list goes on
wraparound services, screening
and brief intervention and
programming like craft, too.
Assist families that are living
in situations with those
addicted to alcohol so that they
can learn what they are doing in
terms of
The substance use but also like
to add that the bill, but Excuse
me, the budget that has been
developed
Through all of these meetings
also includes substantial
funding for an office within the
executive branch to serve as a
control tower for all of these
alcohol related programs to help
coordinate and implement all of
these programs across the state,
including a community advisory
board.
Thank you.
Can I just to act? Go ahead. It
was just
But remind you only have one mic
on it.
For that for that exact reason
And if you are going to touch
your microphone in any way, turn
it off first.
Yes.
I am, too remembers the other
big piece that we have included
in there was funding for tribal
communities, not only through
the grant funding that's going
to happen in those programs and
the programs that we have
mentioned where the funding
would go to each of the
departments, But in addition to
that we have allocated funding
directly for tribal communities
so that they can implement
culturally based programming.
Specific to their needs, because
every single tribal community is
extremely different in our
state, not only Pablo's tribes
and nations. Thanks so
Madam Sheriff. I don't know much
money We pay for these things
going back.
Throw this thing, Madam Terror
said. Okay, so we're gonna make
this alcohol alleviation fund.
Okay, so they're the ones how
many people are going to be?
It's gonna be a board. Who is it
appointed to?
And, um
What will they be experts in the
field where I explain to me how
with this
Thank you. I'm still my head is
still reeling from the last one
with this fund does if you
notice that this creates the
fund
And it is the Legislature that
will
Allocate the funds. The
guardrails are in the last
section of the bill, limiting it
to treatment. Prevention. Um
Treatment prevention and
recovery as well has the harms
cost. So those are the big
guardrails. But the the
intention is the central, um,
organization come from an
individual in the government
Governor's office to ensure that
all of the funds are allocated
to them will and, um the and
there will be the
The review of the funds has his
any other allocation through
Okay, So madam term represents.
So if I'm understanding we're
gonna make this fund
Then it's up to
Who
So we're going to get the money
and then it's going to who is
who is dipping up.
The fund will be, um
Will be collected beginning in
January of 2025, and there will
be a lot of planning going into
effect. Um
Before that.
Of July of 2025 thought it was
January. Okay, um
So anyway, there will be
planning going into effect
before that and then
recommendations will be made
made to the Legislature for how
the Legislature will then, um,
appropriate the money.
Okay, so manager room
If I point like that, I'm not
being rude about making sure we
don't go to the screeching
again. Okay, so we're going to
get the fund. Then there's gonna
be a lot of planning.
So can you tell me because I'm
really concerned about
something.
Can you tell me in the planning?
If we're going for treatment.
Because we've had a lot of
issues like going to facilities
when they're not gonna We did
the car act. Where you get were
we never mandated treatment for
women that were given the baby's
back too. So can you explain to
me
What treatments are we looking
at?
For the types of treatment for
alcohol addiction. We're doing
science base because 12 steps
doesn't cut it. So are we
looking at science based
treatment?
Thank you, Madam Chair
representative. So
Yes, we are looking at many
types of treatment. There are
three FDA approved medications
include naltrexone Campus eight
Isil for em. They're very under
prescribed only 1% of people who
need these medications actually
get them. So yes, of
residential, um, programs,
mutual support groups can be
extremely beneficial to people,
including groups like
12 steps they do not work for
Athens really individual. In
addition, we are very interested
in funding community based
initiatives that are right
communities, so if there are
culturally appropriate practices
that a community would like to
implement, we would like to
reduce the health disparities,
So we're really looking at
A combination of evidence based
practices. Mutual support groups
fall under that bucket as well
as well as knowledge. Madam
Chairman Representative Yeah,
the, um The reason I bring that
up is because there are those
FDA medications. I was brought
up in the first bill for today,
which are under prescribed and
I'm not knocking wildlife
therapy or even equine, which I
fully love. I love those
programs, but they're kind of
more supplements in the are
curative for drug and alcohol.
So that's why I was asking that
specific question.
Would be using, you know,
cognitive behave.
These drugs that are prescribed
because I just don't want to
see. Okay, well, you should go
to 12 steps which may not work
for everybody. And while I love
horses and horse, um it's not a
It's not that it shouldn't be
supplemented. It shouldn't be
the main thing If we're working
with just the drug addiction,
that, um it should be the FDA
approved medications working
with a cognitive behavioral
therapy and less there was a
different cultural approach. So
how are we, Madam Chair
represents. How are we going to
do with the fact that we're
going to do about that?
We don't have
The facilities, which I've been
saying since day One is a huge
issue.
Um um
How are we going to deal with
that issue, And is this going to
be enough to supplement every
single tree? Approximately 200
will be a huge um
We'll go a huge way to moving
the needle.
With regard to those programs
and supplementing them. The way
the bill is written, is not
limited to programs. It can be
used for a variety of things.
Remember, it's up to the
Legislature to appropriate it.
so if the Legislature wants to
take some of this money, um and
use it for capital outlay to
create more programs, that would
be a great expenditure.
Truth is, we need so much more
at first people were saying to
me you can't spend $250 million
in a year and after looking at
the need, and all of the work
that our experts have gone into,
I think
Madam Chair representative leads
to the so another question on
that.
Comorbidities
There's a lot of co co morbidity
in that somebody may be an
alcoholic and also be addicted
to drugs. Are we going to
address that when we move
forward?
Because because there's
different programs for you bring
up a great point. Comorbidities
are very common with alcohol use
disorder, including anxiety
depression, PTSD, um, not to
mention poly substance use. We
want to equip providers to be
able to treat the whole person
that is the
The goal and we would hope that
there would not be limitations
so that providers can only be
treating the alcohol use
disorder. Very important, morbid
conditions that somebody is
stealing. With that really need
to be worked through in order to
make thank you, madam chair,
ribs and experts so
That kind of takes care of what
the preventions looking like, Um
Is there going to be
Oversight and where every single
year we're going to go has has
many, Um, evaluation is a really
important part of any program,
and the Legislature will have
access to those evaluations as
well as the same kind of
evaluations that lfc gives on to
remind her to go through the
chair, Madam chair.
It's late on the day already.
Lost. I was waiting. I was
waiting patiently. Oh, I guess
we work at the answer. So, Madam
chair, so we get the funding and
then I assume there's you said
that who is going to be that
oversight? Who are they
appointed? What does that look
like?
Thank you. I think we are
envisioning. Um, uh, people
This is such a big initiative, a
bold initiative. We want to make
sure that it gets to the people
who need it most that you just
talked about before, so we are
envisioning and coordinate
across the various departments
and success. Um, also just in
reference to your last question.
The budget also includes
Expanded money response division
to expand the valuation of
alcohol in our state and to be
able to see what is the impact
of this program, and are we
starting to see decreases? What,
Really get a handle on this
public health? Press the button.
OK, so going through
The bill.
Um, when I go to
Page two.
Okay, so we're going online to
Okay. We went from 45%. So now
we spell out 2 million
84 monthly.
I'm sorry. Is that going just to
the dy grant from the way that I
read that
Thank you, Madam Chair. That's
correct. No, it's trying not to
touch this thing too much, okay?
So
2,000,084 monthly from the Net
received attribute the liquid
tax shall be made to the D.
So then on
Page two.
67 20,250 monthly from the net
received.
Liquor excise tax shall be made
to a municipality.
Okay?
Used by the beast, probably only
for the provision alcohol
treatment First Street.
Okay?
So these are people. Can you
please explain this to me?
Because I'm like these are
people there need breeding in
the street from municipalities.
I'm not understanding what this
is. Thank you. That is existing
law, and that is an appropriate
been happening, and there's no
chance that I was just curious
about that because I have and
I'm gonna ask them how this is
being applied and what they're
using it for.
Um
So on. I'm paged Madam Chair,
Representative Lord, so
currently the cultural, um,
services within that program to
help folks that are encountering
and substance use addiction
within in the streets, and this
is the way to provide them
shelter and cultural services.
Thank you. That explained a lot
because I was I've never heard
them. Ask me or talk to me about
this.
So, Madam chair on Page two.
Uh, distribution pursuant to
this section, So it was 5% but
dollars monthly.
To the drug court fund. Is that
correct? So we're in? That would
be an increase, right?
Madam Chair. Well, yes.
Thank you.
Um, on page two, Madam chair.
Um
So if I'm understanding
correctly after the distributing
subsections a through C
Distribution pursuant to this
code shall be made to the
alcohol harms leave, So if I'm
understanding correctly
Madam Chair. We have X amount of
dollars.
A gets this against this seat
gets this, and then the rest
goes to the alcohol. Yes, Madam
Chair representative after her
mind because I had people
nodding last time and nobody was
getting that was like
Um, so I have
A question and I'm going to ask
you about this if I understand
correctly after reading through
this bill
Madam Chair, so microbreweries
are exempt from this.
And that also also includes them
serving alcohol. So if there is
a place that makes cider and
they're serving cider, none of
this is applicable to them. Is
that Lord?
Okay, But I'm gonna imagine
somewhere Madam chair ribs and
if they go over X amount of
Making so many barrels than that
is what's going to put them out
of okay to represent how many
barrels
How much is the reason? I'm
asking? This is because on my
land grab I have a very, very
successful uh, cider brewing and
I need to go back and explain to
them.
What keeps them as microbrew.
And then what takes him into
line? 13, Madam chair Microbe
Your thank you. Thank you,
madam. She like I said, I'm my
land route We have, uh, if
anybody should like to go there,
plug, Okay, so
And then Madam chair
represented. I I I'm also
understanding. Just want to say
a small winery is also
1,500,000 L per year based on
Okay, so we go into Page five.
And there's a bunch of stuff
crossed out which I'm not going
to read all that because
But I want to go to eight.
Where we
Okay?
Okay, So here's my question for
clarity on this page eight prior
to July, 1st 2020 the liquor
excise tax imposed on
Spirit liquors is as following
if manufacturing
So can you explain to me what
this means? Are they exempt or
is this craft is still
Thank you, Madam. Chair
representative.
The excise check tax on small
Thank you for that. I want to. I
keep wanting to make sure this
all into this.
So, Madam Chair on Page eight.
Uh, line eight products up to
10% alcohol, So then we start
going into
Different amounts being taxed.
For different
Leaders. Is that correct? So I
don't understand. So eight cents
per liter for the 1st 250,000,
then 28 cents per leader for the
next 250,000 and then 70. Wow,
This takes a big jump, so $7.24
for each leader Thereafter. Is
that so It's going to be an
increment.
Thank you, Madam. Chair
representative. Yes, that's
correct.
And then for this, madam chair
on B.
Product, alcohol. We have the
same thing. It's 32 cents per
leader for the 1st 175 L sold
than
65 cents for a leader in the
next 200, then $7.
And 24 cents.
For each leader sold. They're
after Is that correct?
For those listening. It's that
many thousands. Not that many
dollars. Yes, thank you,
Manager. So can you explain to
me what is their science behind
this or what is the reason for
the increments?
Based on how many leaders sold.
Is there science on that? Or is
it based on what other states
have? Dune can done?
Can you explain this to me?
These are the provisions that
simply hold it to this. Well, um
Crafters harmless.
Until they come into the level
of being a major distributor.
Okay, Madam chair, So I
understand that this is too
Go back to what we said earlier.
What to not penalize them falls.
Okay, so Madam chair and
representatives from
At the bottom 24 manufactured or
produced by a microburst small
wine grower and sold in the
state.
Provided that proof is furnished
to the department and that bears
by microbe or a small grower.
So I'm understanding here on
Page nine, Line four.
With the microbrewers.
It's eight cents per gallon.
For the 1st 30,000 barrels.
Sold.
Is that correct?
Yes, Manager.
If it's in the bill, Um it's
correct. We would assume. Well,
I'm just trying to make sure my
question on that is
Madam chair.
Sold.
What exempt? So what exempts him
in this bill and the serving
portion to show me that I could
tell them that they're not
representative because this is a
excise tax. This is it off, Set
it down, Excise tax it hits. So
this is on the, um so
There's no additional sales tax.
We have tried to keep all the
language.
That was for all of the small
producers, Page seven was for
liquor. I think this is the
same. Okay. Thank you, Madam
Chair. I have a make cider, so I
want to make sure one of the
bill.
That this would be what they
cells.
Explain to me that Madam Chair
representative if
Okay?
They make the alcohol to make
the cider
They're not technically.
Selling it. How it word. What do
you guys collect the tax on the
amount of barrels of cider that
they make each year. Thank you,
Madam Chair representative from
my understanding, and I'm not a
tax and revenue employee. But
there is a form on the tax and
rev. Website that is filled out
each year by all of the
producers and wholesalers in New
Mexico, where they report the
total. I believe it might be out
in thousands of gallons and
thousands. And so they fill out
this form on an annual
Basis and pay excise taxes to
the state through this form, and
we imagine it would stay the
same in
In this new structure, but the
numbers would be revised for all
of the categories other than the
small producer. Thank you for
answering that question. It
gives me most you do and explain
why you, she said.
Um so I guess.
When you guys ran the numbers.
Did you take into consideration
that because
Restaurants. This is still and
that was my I forgot that
question. Madam Chair
restaurants, It's still
applicable right restaurants if
your restaurant server this a
plus sense, I guess a glass of
wine is that correct?
The restaurants don't pay the
excise tax. Only the
distributors do. However, the
distributors will pass it on to
the restaurants and the rest.
Okay. Thank you. I appreciate
that. So what I'm trying to get
at is so let's say we raise
attacks. Dean thing we raised
the tax.
We want less people to be
drinking.
Now there's less money into the
funding. Did you think about
that?
That would be wonderful.
Well, The problem is
If that does happen, but they to
still buy alcohol is the problem
at the end of the day is that
Addicts will still want to be
addicts unless we're making sure
That they're getting the care
that they need.
And that does noise has to go to
care.
So, um
I don't I don't think that I do.
I'm just in my head. Hold on one
second minute. I know there's
one in there. We can think of
right now, Um
I struggle with one anyways. I
think that's all the course I
have. Madam chair. Thank you.
Thank you Next week. Thank you,
Madam Chair and thank you,
representative Senators.
And even the folks in the
audience. I appreciate
everybody's testimony, and I
appreciate it on both sides.
And I always try to find the
middle ground and what's best
for everybody and as a first
responder.
I've seen my fair share of
people getting in Rex represent
the Mescalero Apache
reservation.
And, um, I have had several
talks with them regarding
alcoholism.
And, um
One of my questions. Madam chair
was the amount of money that we
have coming in on the excise tax
now.
Are we doing a good job with
prevention?
And treatment.
That is an excellent question.
Madam chair, and the problem is
I've been seeking for the last
two years. A basic number. How
much money do we spend in this
programs? You can't figure it
out because their budget and
sometimes they're a small part
of a larger thing, so it's very
difficult to evaluate.
I don't whether they're doing a
good job or not given what's
happening in the state. Seems to
me that there's just not enough
resources.
Terra percentage of Vincent my
family's partly muscular Apache,
and so I appreciate the work out
there. Um, I think one of the
main things that we see in
prevention is that it's been
underfunded for over 20 years.
Most communities get about
$100,000 for county level
change, which is very minimal
and there has been no indexing
for inflation. So you know that
the programming that they're
doing they're reaching far and
wide in order to try to
Um, provide the services that
they can and Mescalero actually
has a really amazing prevention
program that offers cultural
services and reintegration of
culture. And so with $100,000 a
year at
In in a patch. Muscular Apaches
are pretty large Apache tribe
compared to some of the bubbles
that we have, Um that's a far
reach. Thank you. Thank you,
Madam Chair and I, You know, I
always like to be razor sharp
efforts and everything that we
can, and I know that a lot of
that d wi money that comes in,
uh,
Our police department locally
does get a lot of that money and
they set up and they
They set up DW I checkpoints and
it's getting harder and harder
and harder to find people that
are driving under the influence,
and I like that, but they still
catch them. They still do it.
And, um
I know that it's a bad decision,
and I don't know. I mean, I know
that it alters and you make
those decisions and I've I've
seen people you know.
I've actually had to go bail
people out and you give them a
couple hours and they're like,
what did I do? Because it
changes your life.
It makes it very complicated and
you go on, you know, ankle
monitors and everything. So
that's that's the main thing.
And with all the testimony
And I don't mean to go off on a
rant. But with all the
testimony, I was blessed not to
get PTSD under
But
You did stir up some memories
today.
And I'm just thinking of all
those memories, and I know that
you want to bring people back.
However.
On the other side. On the flip
side, I do stay in tune with a
lot of my businesses, and they
are still struggling, and some
of our some of them are of our
business is literally were shut
down, and they did not lay off
their employees. They kept their
employees hired. So they're
they're still digging themselves
out right now and for me to put
an extra tax on them.
I think would be criminal for me
right now.
And, um
One other thing is far as the
taxes goes.
So won't this disincentivize
company growth? Because once you
go over that magic number your
tax liability.
He goes high.
And for my entrepreneurs, you
know they are in the wine
industry right now. I think that
I'm hurting them as well. And I
don't want to hurt anybody. I
don't want to hurt one side or
the other. I'm just
Thank you, madam. Chair,
Representative Vincent, it would
only be on the extra above that
so
Madam chair. The last question
that I have is
Do we know how much we're
drawing down on the monies that
we're getting out? Do we do we
actually depleted?
Thank you, madam Chair.
Currently there.
We have about 50 million from
alcohol excise taxes.
25 million or so goes to the
general fund, so it doesn't
actually really do anything with
alcohol.
The other half the other 25
million. So right now, we only
have 25 million.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
If we're not doing a good enough
job with prevention, I sure wish
that that you could double down
and effective.
And that's all I have. Jones.
Oh, centers. I appreciate you
bringing this a lot, and I do
Um, clarifying the amounts of so
so you know, I have this
conflict.
And first I want to. I think
we've all been touched, but like
Representative. I just want to
say that
That the discussions that I
have, I hope that they're taken
in the right way because it
doesn't minimize and anyway,
then the real serious problems
that individuals
So
That said, Um, clarifying where
the money comes from.
But we have identified almost
$300 million worth of programs
that need to be implemented
fully, um, arms. So if just by
doing the extra 25 will only be
Thank you. Um, so I'd like to
look at my I guess we were
hoping that taxes in some way
will be a deterrent to drinking.
Um I don't know that that but,
um
If it is, we will have fewer
attacks more so that's a
problem, but I think that it
won't
Keep drinking people.
Off the roads, at least in my
district and in any district
where you're close enough to
Access. Um
Alcohol that cost 30 miles to
the Mexican border. Where from
where I live, a lot of people
would be driving across. There
was a question in here, Madam
Janeway. Alright, It's my point
that already happens with
medication.
People will drive to get their
alcohol and what they'll do down
there is drink. There'll be a
strict I I just I don't see
anywhere.
So
So, in addition to that,
And the big producers, they
I have to admit, I'm not really
familiar with how many how? How
much they produce. But if they
the way this chart works if
there are local wine grower,
they would, um there's a step
up.
So they would, uh
But the one girl pretense cents
per liter on the 1st 80 over
80,000, but not over 950,000 L.
Oh, I'm page nine of the bill.
Starting on, Starting on What
Or line 16.
Manufacturer produced by a small
wine grower and sold in the
state, and that's the key part
and sold in this state. Um,
provided the proof is furnished
to the department of Wine
Grower.
I'm not filming their large
producer I but
Big operation.
So if they sell over 900 if they
sell over 1,500,000 L, then
their excise tax will go up.
Then the wine will be
Mm hmm. Oh, yes, that was
demonstrated by the by the so
the wine. The the unit price
will be 45 cents.
Per leader.
Yes. $2.14 per dated
It was just pointed out to me.
Thank you, Madam Chair just
pointed out to me that it's says
taxes on larger producers,
including Madam Chair when
you're talking about Penny. Yes,
it's a percentage. But I don't
think that it makes sense to
talk about a percentage when
you're talking like half a cent,
or two cents, or three cents.
That just doesn't make sense.
Yes, the percentage is high, but
the amount is
Hold on Just a minute. Let me
make sure I'm looking the right
It's 98 through 18.
So the rates of liquor excise
tax this is online 11 shall be
rounded down to the nearest
whole scent of multiplied by a
fraction with numerator in case
and so, according to the
denominator equal to the
consumer prices for provided
that the rate of the tax shall
not be led the previous year,
Basically can clarify this for
me, Madam Chair, Um
What we're saying here is that
that yearly this will be
reevaluated every three correct.
That's correct.
I know some people would say
that that is written into the
bill is tax increase. It won't
be approved by the Legislature.
Um, every year the villages so
it is, it will be
representation. So if next year
in year three if they wanted to
do something they could, But
this is to address and that's
that is to solve every 30 years
with a big jump. But instead,
businesses can plan and it'll go
along with their price increase
because they've been ordering
such a low tax.
For the last
Well, thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator. I guess that is an
interesting way to, but I think
the fact that it's written
Potentially without us with
that. Let me check and see if I
got I know I had a lot of
questions. And did you have
something else to say to that? I
think I'm done. Thank you.
You may remember. I remember
starkly. You gotta text that the
son of a dear friend had died
and later to find out he
complications from alcoholism.
And so it really hits me. I grew
up in Crown Point. We lost
friends to suicide car accidents
and for you, so with that I will
entertain emotion. I'm sure I'd
like to make a motive. Chavez
