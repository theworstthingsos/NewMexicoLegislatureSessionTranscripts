Mr chair members of the
committee.
Your.
So what online teacher.
The B..
But what is.
What are.
if you.
And we knew that was a lot of
that was
Thank you Representative thank
you Mr chair order and we I have
an amendment to the bill I would
like to speak on.
That
are yet to two five two two five
numbers two two five PED two
point one.
Our our I love that.
If the proposed amendment is
simply a technical language
speaks out to the committee a
minute of this bill for the
purpose of providing additional
clarity and on the on the on the
on the definition of the of the
diesel of the following adoption
is
Of the renewable diesel or
previous language amendment to
house bill four thirty six and
the house energy committee
US flags issue concerned by some
of the three your advocates
concern was expressed at the
division of renewable diesel was
originally drafted I was just
kind of let up by Legislative
Council Service and adopted by
the house energy committee was
not fully aligned with federal
statutes will study a federal
statutes and for consistency
clarity between the states such
as a macro strategies we updated
the definition on the amendment
of the pro to the proposed
amendment is is merely a
technical fix that that
distinguishes between renewable
diesel and biodiesel.
And that the once again the
lines of the federal statute of
the definition of
Renewable file of renewable
diesel with that Mr chairman and
members the committee with
several questions it was the.
Thank you Mr chair
Can you the.
Thanks for the.
I.
It's been.
More complicated than.
Any money the but can you can
you explain to me the purpose of
the.
Mr chair of Representative
Townsend the purpose of the
amendment was just three to make
sure that that that we keep
claim that the language was
there was some confusion between
renewable diesel and biodiesel I
I believe that that was of the
mixed messages coming through
there two very different things
and what we wanted to do was
clarify that language should
apply to the the federal
definition.
Chair and representative.
The the southern this right.
It's
pretty easy for me.
The company and their teacher.
Purchases about nine thousand
barrels a day.
Of course.
Oil.
The process of the eight.
The bill years ago.
And I want to make sure from a
public policy perspective.
That we realize.
What we're doing.
So with this purchase
A hundred percent I.
The subject to the fifty percent
fifty percent tax credit and.
Mr chair representative I don't
know Mr Vergara's online you can
help me answer out.
Morning helps up.
Thank you morning Mr Chairman
representative
yes I I believe the way the
language has been structured it
would apply to both biodiesel
and renewable diesel at the at
the specified land right.
So chairman I just.
That means that a single company
is going to be getting about
seventy five million.
You realize that.
Mr chair representative we
realize that the that the fifty
cent price tag is going to St
and we've discussed it and or
were willing to to reduce that
amount up to be to make it more
up.
Does the bill the total bit less
bitterness wall.
the.
I know you might.
Appreciate.
This company is my district fact
that workforce for four years.
But policy a policy.
And so I just think the.
Body needs to realize I don't I
didn't see that was your tier
correct.
The.
That all one way that.
When I first read this I thought
it was a young tend to act.
That was captured which.
That.
And I voted for it when I read
it I thought it was purchased.
And then in the middle of the
night I realized something
purchased nine thousand barrels
a day of mourning making
renewable and I thought.
That that much capitalized or
and I thought that seventy three
million dollars.
And so I just though that that
I'm I'm I'm not gonna vote for
it
because I don't think you have a
policy that.
It's it's.
It's one that I probably won't
hear about when I leave here
that's just the way it is policy
problems.
Mr chair representative do have
my intent in the and the intent
of of this whole process is is
to benefit the end user
I have to consider that asked
with the one you that you're the
one that you had mentioned Mr
chair representative but yes the
the goal of this effort is to
benefit the end user.
But I don't have a problem with
that and.
And I believe the.
Probably should the same company
was and two hundred thirty
million dollars a year I and
regions.
Renewable investment credits.
Several years before that and
that was the driving economics
to spend three hundred thirty
five million dollars to build a
new plant so.
One side of me says they ought
to get something back for
spending a heck of a lot of
money but.
Policy goes on forever so Mr
chair at probably said too much
but I just thought it.
That part of the body to realize
exactly.
Thank you thank you.
Okay.
Sure.
This
chair of Representative I like
to defer to Mister Vergara on on
that please.
Anthologies I could barely hear
the question could you repeat
that please.
Let me repeat.
To differentiate between
renewable diesel or plan to
renewable diesel.
Renewable diesel.
The agricultural.
It used to create a new mobile
diesel.
Hi diesel on the other hand uses
of waste products sure.
Rendering from.
Animal.
Questions and.
And bank in Greece and.
Things of that nature to create
a diesel is that distinction
correct.
Mr chair representative
let me clarify for you biodiesel
and renewable diesel are both
drop in fuels that can be used
in virtually all diesel engines
they are made from the same the
stock so taking waste oil and
use clicking on distillers corn
oil from the ethanol production
process rendered animal hello
those sort of feed stocks as
well as
so eating canola and other sort
of oil see byproducts you can
you take all of those the stock
and a burning into either a
priorities or renewable diesel
so there tentatively different
fuels but they can both be using
the same engine in fact many
police are using either of those
two feels for both of them
blended together but I can
certainly make both deals from
the same feedstock biodiesel is
made through a chemical process
called Francis their vacation.
You're reacting it with no hope
all in the presence of a
catalyst and you're turning that
into fatty acid methyl esters a
basically a fancy way of saying
you know oxygenated sort of
compounds along with a valuable
by product called glycerin and
then renewable diesel you take
the same sort of feedstock
basically waste oils and
agricultural products as as you
noted and then you put that
through a basically a
hydrotreating or a refinery type
process and then getting a
renewable diesel out of that but
again both you'll see our
usable in same engines they
complete they can be blind right
and are are in fact landed
together in many cases.
Mr Chairman representative
experts.
The feed stocks for the process
could be identical is that.
Mr chair representative that
that is correct.
Thank you Mr.
Questions on the amendment.
Is that.
All there is to.
Representative our New Mexico.
Representative Castellano.
Yes.
Representative Chandler yes.
Representative Duncan.
Representative guy it goes.
Representative Harper.
Representative Hernandez.
Speaker Martinez.
Representative Ortez.
Representative Scott.
Representative Serrato yes.
Representative Townsend.
Representative condemning.
Chair lamp yes.
Making it to.
So yeah
Representative.
What.
Which yes yes Mr chair all right
thank you so much that's the
audience for all those thank you
for house bill three three six
as amended all those in the room
and online please raise your
hand if you are in support of
this bill.
We have a couple in the room and
those are like you have up Civil
your first.
Morning Mr chairman members of
the committee Republicans also.
These are all out so you and.
New Mexico we see our whole lot
of this is that will
opportunities inside of our
surgeries involved our.
Yes you will Mexico art is very
small issues or.
Seven percent of our total sales
so we see this as an opportunity
The company's in in the past so.
Changes the local.
Very little people and
As I do so.
And this is a test that is easy
is that are not in the are you
is this to.
Use of words Representative
models.
Thank you this is Mrs.
When Mr chairman members of the
committee hi my name is Patrick
Killen registered lobbyists for
chevron chevron supports each
before three six and we think
Representative Lara for bring it
forward chevron believes the
future of energy is lower
carbon.
In June of twenty twenty two we
completed our acquisition of the
renewable energy group or you
need a company that helped to
establish the US biofuels
industry Senator Mary G. we're
working to provide lower carbon
fuel solutions for the
transportation sector to help
reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and assist New Mexico and the
United States with meeting its
climate aspirations
while New Mexico as you may know
has a biodiesel statute mandate
in statute it has never been
implemented in eleven years and
we believe the incentive based
and market based measure like H.
before three six will possibly
affect the renewable fuels
industry in the state where the
unemployment mandate from twenty
twelve has not have that effect
so for those reasons and others
chevron supports HD four three
six thank you thank you Sir and
well I've worked a little light
okay the innovation in the route
on.
Go to the room anyone alive.
Right it's going back to the
committee that questions
comments from committee members
are.
Thank you chairman
Representative Lara good to see
you this morning.
I see.
We all know the.
The.
All see this committee is the
temporary table bills that have
fiscal impact and and see if we
can put them in the tax package
and taxpayers already left that
so so I think we all know that
this could be tabled and.
We can talk about it over the
interim and and but I just want
to let out there that we kind of
fall have the understanding that
this has a.
You know potentially you know.
Sixty.
You know seventy eighty million
dollar hit and that was in the
package but I just have a couple
questions about the substance of
the bill if that's alright
so
Chairman representative this
does have a reporting
requirement and it has a five
year sunset is that correct.
But Mr chair Representative yes
that's correct so Senator great
things thanks for making sure
those were in there.
And this tax credit is on the
personal and corporate income
tax side is not refundable but
you carry it forward is that
correct.
Mr chair representative yes yes
so that's that's good to we we
try not to be refundable credits
but caring for make sense.
Okay so this bill really does
two things and I'm trying to
understand why we're doing.
So there is a gross receipts
tax.
Deduction are forcing of not so
not subject actually at all I
think that deduction this is a
session three there's a
deduction from gross receipts
and compensated tax for blooded
diesel.
And then
sections one and two are also in
addition to that giving a tax
Twelve to fifty cents per gallon
for personal income tax program
tax you.
Explain to me why we're doing
folks.
Mr chair representative the the
idea behind this obviously was
to promote the use of of of the
the fuel add up in addition.
The the intent of this was.
Mainly for for the end user I
should say for the for for the
consumer of the product because
I believe that this will attract
new business and grow existing
business in New Mexico.
And I there's an opportunity
that we can that that that that
we can look at.
Bringing in for example in my
area there is a file fuel
company that has more operations
in taxes of the New Mexico and
the reason behind some of the
some of the slide which is to
track the to come into Mexico to
hire New Mexicans and to bring
your business into Mexico.
Up the second of the second part
Mr chair representative on the
end user was to promote the use
of this type of fuel for our
produce construction use of
transportation as far as
commercial transportation
because I I I I believe in that
and I do that by doing these
type of things so for these type
of incentives we can grow that
type of business in New Mexico
there's there are several
there's a couple large
transportation companies in my
area that I know that would
benefit from from something like
this it they're offered that
that that incident to
temperatures and to use
biodiesel or the renewable
diesel.
Chairman representative
so okay yes I think I'm
understanding a little bit
better where you're coming from
if this was really just a
consumer focused.
Bill I could see.
wanted to move the gross
receipts tax because that might
decrease the cost when someone
is going to the Papen actually
filling up their vehicle
I don't think it many of us
individuals are are corporate
entities so we try one benefit
from income tax and maybe we
have a little benefit on the
personal contacts to if we were
aware that we should be counting
how many gallons were.
We fought and and do that at the
end of the year with when we're
doing our taxes but.
so I don't think the pittance it
really help the consumer but
what you mentioned was that
you're also looking to attract
businesses here and and that
would make sense why you're
wanting to also include.
Incident as part of it if you're
trying to help businesses.
Odyssey we don't have many of
these in our tax code they're
pretty rare and there want to
you know hard to administer
so there's reasons why we don't
have many like this but I guess
I understand where you're coming
from.
In fact chair representative
maybe just a couple other.
Quick observations.
the FIR is actually pretty good
on I have not previously part is
very good on page four in the
pittance twelve section it talks
about how blended biodiesel.
At your currently get special
treatment not just from New
Mexico but from the feds.
And and then if you also go to
page six in the middle.
It kind of has a history of how
New Mexico to attend to the past
was sent by the production and
use of biodiesel
and and they've got I see three
different sections there and
he's really have not been been
claimed or used
And so I just want to.
Point that out that
Sometimes we try to incentivize
things with the tax code and
things just aren't quite there
yet and and and I think this is
probably an example where it
just hasn't been used I mean
there are other ways we can
center by this we want or
but yet the market do its thing
so I I think you know like
electric vehicles biodiesel's
going to actually become more of
a thing.
Like to that chairman and
representative I appreciate the
discussion I I remain and equal
opportunity credit and
exemptions and deductions
here.
yeah I I I we that we just keep
poking more holes in the Swiss
cheese and
that eventually is gonna come
back to bite us so
but I appreciate what you're
doing Chairman representative
thank you thank you Mr chair
thank you Representative taxes
and my forte.
One of our dedicated by trade
and but I've learned a lot and
I've learned how the how I'm
making a change year to year as
an impact in other places and so
what the the the goal behind
this back like I mentioned Mr
chair representative issue is
student center I not only the
the industry but also to
incentivize
Just cleaner air as well yes so
I think we can we can I think we
when it comes to this of the
week and we can Mr chair
representative that we cannot
possible for us we can grow our
business with these but with
these renewable ended with
reason with these renewable
fuels yep you know benefit our
apartment thank you thank you
Representative.
Thank you Mr chairman
Representative as I read this I
thought it was just for the end
user.
Senator I'm not opposed to
company that spends hundreds of
millions of dollars in getting.
The fuel spare tax credit was
aware fifty thousand dollars
when it expired so to get much
more than that.
After spending less work to do
this that's great
I
they don't think that fifty
cents a gallon is going to
incentivize my wife to let me
get the new truck but I would
like.
Thank you that's the only
question was in.
Right.
Thank you Mr chair
representative is great to see
you
since I'm gonna feel experts
what is by it what are what is
an example of a company that we
use by off field do so.
Diesel fuel Mr chair
representative with regard like
to defer to Mister regard for
that.
Thank you Mr chair
representative
as I noted that many fleet
operators of these would be the.
Truck owners and operators of
fleet that transport goods
across the country they use vast
amounts of diesel fuels and many
of them are switching over to
biodiesel and renewable diesel
of the lands a number of them
and a growing number are using a
hundred percent of the lands of
both fuels to significantly
improve their environmental
Department scores angst that
basically reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions and and
air pollution levels so
basically anything we that is is
vehicles that that have diesel
engines so these would be your
freight transport your
construction companies
and the skills can also be used
in rail and you know marine
applications and and back Easter
also used in heating
residential commercial heating
applications so that anywhere
you choose a higher diesel fuel
you can use these fuels.
Thank you Mr chair.
flies a lot for me thank you
thank you no questions or
comments on house bill four
thirty six saying that
membership that.
Thank you just a second that.
If any of that motion.
Thank you for visiting
appreciate these yes the Mr
chairman thank you members of
the committee.
With this attitude.
Next on our agenda we have
Senate Bill that
Thank you thank you I'm just
right here by the door thank you
Mr chairman members of the
committee
I have a bill that I believe you
will agree with.
It is very prudent financial and
fiscal policy for the state of
New Mexico it is nearly
mandating that an annual
transfer for ten years of ninety
two million dollars to the
severance tax permanent fund
will be will be put into the
severance tax permanent fund
what it is Mr chairman and that
shell is the savings that we in
New Mexico are going to save
money not funding this year we
agreed that we would actually do
our capital outlay and so on
with general fund revenues
because we were plentiful with
cash and it was not prudent to
borrow money in bonds to do the
character yeah so this is what
we're going to save by in debt
service by not having to pay the
debt so we're gonna put it into
the severance tax permanent fund
to generate approximately forty
one million per year by the end
of the ten years and will
continue to grow so the state
that's what this election
that's at this point go to the
audience for all those in
support of Senate bills Senator
eight just because of that.
I don't want to look up.
State but.
Thank you Mr chairman my name is
JD Bullington and rest of this
speaking on behalf of greater
occur to chamber of commerce the
chamber supports all the
legislature's various efforts to
strengthen and grow the
severance tax permanent fund
this session including this
legislation sponsored by Senator
Rodriguez it's a wise move to
avoid using severance tax bonds
for capital outlay projects
given our historic surplus which
allows us to keep more money in
the permanent fund experience
larger general fund
distributions over the long haul
this is a very good fiscal
policy in the chamber urges
yourself this legislation except
April's.
Aligns.
What opposition in the wrong.
Signal.
Question what are.
Thank you chairman and
that Senator it's great to see
you here this morning
just making sure I understand
the bill
as as we've got it here.
It was not
It was amended was Committee was
admitted.
I think we have we have one
amendment and let me explain the
amendment that was done in the
Senate of the one of the
committees we wanted to make
sure that schools the the
capacity bonding capacity for
public schools was not impacted
so we we clarified the language
that was all that was done in
the amendment.
Thank you Act chairman Senator
that that helps clear that up so
that that one amendment is just
for this year to make sure that
the public school capital outlay
is not negatively impacted
exactly that by virtue of our
actions to put this money in
savings in this permanent tax
severance money DeBoer talking
about that would impact yes okay
and thank you chairman and
senator I mean obviously I.
being very concerned about our
service tax refund I'm very
supportive very excited about
this bill and there's a nice to
get a great FY are not shows we
actually will be getting greater
distribution to the general fund
from the severance tax refund by
making this move and that's
really the point is that by
strengthening this fund we're
gonna receive more money up to
the general fund so that that's
a great table to see
Does this bill.
all the.
Requires that this ninety two
million goes to the service
experts or is that a things
that.
This amount only or is this a
minimum amount that that would
be the minimum amount because we
could be saving more depending
on the predictions between now
and the ten years usually the
funding framework as we know it
for ten years the time frames
and so this is the estimated
projected amount that far as we
can go but it could be more yes
and it would generate
approximately one hundred eighty
five million dollars back into
the general fund it is
predictions at a minimum again
these predictions do in ten
years.
Chairman you're welcome thank
you this is about the.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
senator for being for the bill I
think at Representative Harper
hit on what I was kind of
getting at but I guess overall
we this is do we hello and we
feel that this will support to
severance
that that the tax plan fund is
the permanent fund how long we
think it will help sustain it
over time thank you very much we
hope that it's forever as long
as we have it in the state of
New Mexico what happens is by
putting more funding into it
every year it continues to grow
and could just to generate more
and more so it's a ripple effect
that is positive continuously so
you know we are actually hoping
to see and I've we we probably
won't be here after twenty five
years of thirty years time but
we're gonna see see it double at
least at a minimum is our help
and the predictions in the
information submitted by the
economy wonderful thank you so
much that is wonderful.
What else was.
That wasn't that may.
Yes the best thank second well
signals.
Representative for New Mexico
yes.
Representative Castellano.
Representative Chandler.
Representative Duncan yes
Representative diet goes.
Representative Harper.
Is.
Representative Hernandez.
Speaker Martinez.
Representative Ortez yes.
Representative Scott.
Representative Serrato yes.
Representative Townsend.
Oil and gas.
One up.
At.
Yes Mr chair.
There is a second also that is
passed out of committee
substitute these special
services.
That out of.
You all have your this.
These are referenced
But as the two five number Mr
chairman the the number is point
two two five eight nine six
point two that's what I have.
Well at this stage.
Number.
In the.
Second.
Lawyers yes thank you very much
Mr chairman members of the
committee.
We're here this morning with
this Committee substitutes what
it essentially does is combine
to house bill's ever introduced
earlier in the session I had a
house bill and I'll talk about
that was first and then I'll
have Representative Scott
explained the portion of the
order that that is that the
origin is his bill.
so Mr chairman and committee
members I I think everyone by
now has heard what the problem
is that the passage of house
bill six in twenty nineteen and
that what into effect since we
enjoyed July twenty one has
actually harmed to
municipalities in the state
Carlsbad and Hobbs both have
been leasing on average about
two million dollars a month in
G. R. T. revenue because of that
the changeover to destination
taxation that we know that Mr
chair that was not the intent of
house bill six was mainly there
to capture internet sales and
pretty much all municipalities
and counties have gained because
of that but the unintended
consequence was some pretty
severe harm to to these two
municipalities so what that's
just section one of the bill
proposes doing is adding and
I'll give you the exact language
it's that the business location
progress receipts would be tied
to a professional services and
that's an existing statute we
add and oil and gas production
services
so that would take it back to
basically origin based taxation
where the where the business is
located that would help maybe
not solve the entire problem of
massive loss of revenue that it
would it would certainly
alleviate a lot of that.
And then
That that's basically what we do
I would also put it Mr chairman
members that there is precedent
in current law for exemptions
that's that's found on page six
of the bill.
The committee substitute where
professional service is actually
called as an exception this so
we're just.
tie that into to that so we're
doing things so now perhaps
Representative just gotten and
Senator Kernan at some point
about to explain a little bit as
well thank you Mr chair your.
Later sections in the bill Mr
chairman members of the
committee.
For a different approach.
Representative Brown brooch the
taxation side.
And the second approach on the.
In order would go a long ways
toward solving problems.
The second approach on the.
Side was formulated.
Distribution of the state
portion of proceeds revenues
back to counties cities.
The waiting secretary supply
distribution.
It's complicated actually it's
not very.
We take all thirty three
counties setting gross receipts
tax to the state.
Portion three percent.
The gross number would come back
to the cities and counties in a
form that weights.
What's coming back those three
tunes.
To what the county made in
contributions to the total and
seventeen inch as to what.
The counties and cities in per
capita population.
So what does because leave Haiti
counties contribute so much
more.
To.
Number coming to the state.
Three transporting factor based
on that contributions will
getting enough extra.
Not to get a whole.
But closer to the reductions
that were affected six.
Thank you very much Mr chair
members of the committee in
addition.
Excuse in addition to that it
would also benefit our
municipalities in we think
that's a fair play in where we
could potentially get back some
of the money that we've lost in
that same time other
municipalities across the state
would also have a budget based
on population and what they
contribute and I know I see many
new faces here and and some of
you may not could have been
present when we have presented
our concerns to both LFC over
the interim as well as revenue
stabilization committee so it
may be a little bit confusing on
on what our issue is and just
stated earlier sales certainly
we've all benefited from the
internet but on the other side
New Mexico unlike many states we
also tax services and when those
services
are done in the county with
destination by sourcing all of
that G. R. T. that the
municipality was previously
getting is now going to
basically to the state because
they're not having to return the
one point two two five back to
our municipality can't is
getting very little new money I
think we're eight point three
percent they're not the real
beneficiaries it's a state and
we know that through if I are in
appreciate Representative
hoppers I think I'm saying it
correctly we know that that the
costs to return that one two two
five back to Hopson Carlsbad is
about fifty million dollars so
we know what we're leasing
because it's basically going to
the staff so that's the original
problem that we're trying to
solve thank you very much.
Mr chairman members of the
committee just one last comment.
The.
The distribution side of this
piece of legislation was an
attempt to.
Let.
Counties and municipalities
participated more in the oil
revenues that are coming out of
Lee in two counties.
It was going to benefit every
municipality every county in the
state not just the southeast.
And.
Question question thanks so much
at this point time that's go to
the audience all those in
support of basically two for
House Bill four thirty nine the
support group.
Opposition.
Of the reason for that in a row.
A lot
of that questions this.
Representative Townsend.
The.
The impact.
large.
Mr Chairman representative
Thompson if we use Albuquerque's
example was the county impact
was about forty million dollars
at eight percent and the.
City of Albuquerque stood to
gain some seventy four million
dollars so yes or two of both
their.
Economic powerhouse in the state
and the population.
Bernalillo county in Albuquerque
major penetration.
There.
And then.
At that scale.
In your.
And
Los.
Smaller than in serving as well
and then Mr Chairman
representative madam correct.
All of your Representative right
I think of.
I.
Yeah.
I.
I can't.
Share.
Sources every county is the
something that we.
We might change the perception.
Thank you thank you Sir.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr chair.
Thank you.
Centers today and I have had to
learn to listen to the ongoing
conversation since the passage
of house bill six which again I
commend for the important piece
of tax policy it was at a high
level and have learned a lesson
about how in this specific area
of concern there's reason to be
in this conversation so thank
you all for bringing this
forward I would love to
understand better the piece
you're saying about how
something like HB thirty four
thirty nine would benefit all
municipalities.
I think I heard a couple of you
see that can you walk me through
what you mean with that
statement.
Mr Chairman.
Representative the.
Formulate distribution.
Of at the eight percent level
that is in this bill.
Results in a total distribution
to all thirty three counties
about three hundred million
dollars just a little over three
hundred million dollars and
that's coming back.
Both as a portion of what Dona
Ana County contributed and it's
coming back.
By servant to ensure.
Formula.
And in per capita.
So because of.
Population and the economic
activities is generated in your
county there would be
significant revenues coming back
and you got that.
On the spreadsheet.
Well maybe yield computer out of
my briefcase I can actually
great to every.
Exactly what the benefits to
your community with the.
Want to purge thank you Mr chair
and Sanchez I do think that.
I would like to see that over
the course of this conversation
that I actually am asking that
because I I think for me the
most compelling argument as you
all have let the conversation to
address this issue is actually
that these two municipalities
who are still responsible for
providing services to the people
who live and work.
in the greater areas need the
right kind of budget to continue
meeting the quality of life and
safety and health and well being
of the people you represent I've
heard you make really compelling
arguments that you still need
roads you still need emergency
response you still need good
schools you still need safe
neighborhoods and that
specifically is mainly that
Carlsbad and Hobbs have felt
this change in policy most
distinctly in most directly so
all that to say I've I've been
pretty convinced over the years
that.
Six should be in the works that
appreciate you for bringing this
bill forward.
in the FIR on page four.
There was a note from TRD.
Creation of oil and gas services
from destination based sourcing
maybe viewed as preferential
treatment of a specific industry
this caught my attention because
if I remember and I am not in
the committee will check me if
I'm wrong there were card
balance other car about that
related to destination based
sourcing
like for attorneys for example
I imagine professional service
services up so I think.
Especially as we talk about
professional services whether it
be in the context of peer many.
Or what happens here that
generally is as a policy and as
a body we decided that some
folks could be exempted out of
what was happening at the
station based sourcing and for
me as a matter of equity in
honesty about where our state
budget is coming from this to me
was a preferential your request
doesn't read as preferential
treatment but actually some
fairness so that as you're
communities continue to
stabilize them and be part of
the foundation of New Mexicos
budget you also have the
revenues.
And your municipalities to take
care of the people doing that
work so of course you know that
process in this committee we
know that our tax package has
moved out of this committee but
I still think this important
conversation that we need to
continue to have in the interim
and really figure out in short
time thank you Mr chair thank
you Representative Harper.
The chair of hymns of Senator
it's gives you this morning I
just wanna make sure I'm
understanding the.
The proposal that's in front of
us
And and really there's kind of
two proposals in front of us
rolled into this this committee
substitute.
those trying to dress the same
problem and so chair and
representative center I just
want to understand this right so
the first section.
What is being proposed
is like by you're getting
mentioned when we.
Determine what we would do for
destination based sourcing.
because we are such an
aberration we tax services
we we determined that
professional services which
keeps their origin base
this.
We we realized this would be a
just a complete nightmare to
administering the change.
And what section one is saying
is.
We're going to essentially now
include
These oil and gas mining
activities.
As part of that I mean
Representative defining them as
a professional service but we're
socially to treat them that way
we're gonna say instead of being
destination based it'll be
origin based so instead of the
county where the secretary is
happening receiving that money
in the state getting.
All state right we're gonna put
it back to where is where.
The activity will be.
In the municipality essentially
so when I see you uniting so
that's that's the first.
I think that's actually a really
clean way to do it.
If if we decide that we should.
And the consequence of that will
be that the county and the state
will lose money but the we'll go
back to the way it was worth the
municipalities getting this
money Chairman representative
centers I get that right.
Mr Chairman representative I I
think you did get that exactly
as as we we see it as well.
At the county is actually up
from the data I'm looking at we
cannot really take much of a hit
on that date.
It stay pretty much where they
are a little bit of an effect
but certainly
that we're not hearing any
complaints from the counties at
all about these proposals in
this bill but the disparities of
course of the ones that are
really asking us to solve this
problem Mr chair.
So generous of Senators yeah so
so the county will lose some
But I I could see were there
maybe not
The open arms about that you
know there but they've also
benefited and lots of other ways
to use our.
Okay so that's option one
Sections two and three are a
different.
Solution a different approach
and
my understanding is we are
starting a new.
Fund and starting a new
distribution.
And this distribution will go to
all cities and all counties.
And how it's
and I appreciate the the
equation actually I I I I I
played with the spreadsheet was
kind of fun but essentially what
we're doing is we're saying
we're gonna act also it is a
counties money.
And the money is gonna be based
off of.
Your population seventy percent.
And thirty percent based off of
how much.
G. R. T. your county and city is
sending to the state.
And of course this budget all
cities and counties because
they're all getting money.
now just so I understand I think
we understand it right Howard
funding this fund.
Is we're taking eight percent of
the gross receipts tax and
putting it every year into this
fund and the distributing it
out.
Is that correct Mr chairman
Representative that is exactly
correct okay and and chairman
and Representative Senators how
much is eight percent of the G.
R. T. today that we're testing
would go this far.
Mr Chairman representative just
a little over three hundred
million dollars works okay
so so just so we understand
and I and I appreciate having to
play again I I I appreciate this
I think this is very interesting
but option number two is just
three hundred million dollar hit
to the general fund.
To put into this fund that is
they gonna spread that three
hundred million dollars out
across all the seasonal jobs.
Mr Chairman representative that
is exactly correct.
It.
To several of us working on this
project to the state right now
this is floating in the ocean of
money cities and counties are
really doing.
And a lot of circumstances and
this was an opportunity to give
back to those local communities
some of that.
Yes.
Revenue string yeah.
So the gentleman Representative
Senators thank you for that hi I
do agree we're we're floating on
an ocean money the state level I
will I will of respectfully
disagree that counties and
cities are not doing well in
fact all of them of seeing that
record increases in the revenue
last three or four years mostly
due to a lot of stuff that this
committee has done to help them
out but I do understand that
that Eddie and I mean
Hobbs and Carlsbad although
there revenues have grown
slightly
Looking at historical trends
based off what the oil and gas
industry does they should be
doing a lot better so I do
acknowledge that that's a
problem
so my I guess my last question
Chairman representative and
senators now that we understand
these two different options are
before us was it your intent
that we adopt both of them.
Or that we just
doing we're right in the in the
session we discussed both of
them so that we can continue to
have a look at these different
options in the future Mr
Chairman representative
realistically given where we are
in the session what we want you
to cease to proposals to
discussion.
If we can get out of here either
or.
The very please to do.
Thank you realistically.
Not much chance.
Yeah yeah Chairman
representative thank you for
that I I I didn't assume that
you want to post because that
was that was that of an
interesting but up I appreciate
the creativity of the and the
discussion this morning thank
you chairman thank you with
Representative Chandler thank
you Mr chair so let's talk about
companies that are from out of
state.
but to work in the state.
What are the implication there
oil and gas Sir I mean I don't
even oil and gas services
production services to have a
definition of oil and gas
production services Mr chairman.
I have one in the substitute
it's on page six.
Just starting at one thirteen.
It's a paragraph long.
Service master.
Okay.
All right so we know that we
have many companies or some
companies from out of state to
do business in your area that
provide oil and gas services.
And under the current period
time.
Their services are taxed in the
location where that the Services
occur that would be most likely
in the county probably you know
if we accept and I do of course
except having your
characterization of how these
things work.
What what happened to those the
tax revenue for the counties who
are getting those out of state
tax services our offices are
somewhere else out of state not
in the city of we Eddie.
What would happen to those
revenue.
I think Mr chair representative
broke the spring they were
compensating tax yes so yeah it
would be collected through the
compensating tax okay so my
understanding here my
understanding and I could be
wrong and I know we have tax
experts in the audience is Mr
chair that that compensating tax
just goes to the state of mind
wrong about this.
Okay so it's a flat fee and it
goes to the state is needed if I
may ask.
stationary Representative
Chandler is the Mike this past.
Mr Chairman Representative
Chandler it could be the
comments in tax it's more likely
that it would state is out of
state G. R. T. L. N. that would
not have a locally COVID and
that would go that would be a
tax rate of just whatever the
state rate is and that would go
straight to the state okay so
those companies like chevron and
Exxon Mr chair
right now they're paying
whatever the tax rate is in the
county so that's not a flat tax
it's not the flat state tax it's
the county tax plus the state
tax I don't know what you're
your number is but let's pretend
that seven percent that would be
cut to four point seven five or
whatever our current state taxes
or giving chevron and Exxon and
I don't know what else tax cut
where is the locals you know if
you're smaller producers are I
know Mr chair you all very much
about.
Probably have offices in Hobbs
or in Carlsbad that maybe I
called you guys know your
business better than I know that
Mr chair
so there are there and more I
guess because they would be
paying.
the state plus the county right
right Mr chair and
Representative.
Mr Chairman representative yes
there is a business location
within the municipality those
folks would be done in local
range that is correct okay so.
The raptors.
Well that is correct so Mr chair
and representative I don't I'm
not an expert on the Commerce
Clause and we can have a chat
about that maybe when we have
this conversation further but it
seems like we're treating our
maybe our local producers.
and businesses a little less
fairly than we might have a
state people because you're
gonna be paying maybe like half
the tax rate than Mr chair of
what the out of state folks
would be paying.
These.
Mr Mr Chairman representative.
Those taxes collected in the in
the counties.
Would still be collected.
To the within the county and
sent to the state.
For those businesses that don't
have the listening and in the
city.
Paying the local.
G. R. T. taxes but.
But in the county.
I think the tax rate in state
and out of state.
Okay approximatelyof.
Well thank you for that and you
know we can answer a set have a
further conversation because I
think we knew you understand
that if I are suggests that out
of state companies would
probably get a tax break and the
question is as a matter of
policy is that what we want to
be doing Mr chair and I'm still
I still have four Representative
Although it would okay so in
terms of the fund what I hear
you saying is
if I got it right is we take
eight percent of G. R. T.
generated in these counties.
The anti in the tire States Mr
chair.
Okay eight eight percent of the
total G. R. T. with the source
and left as it currently stands.
Eight percent of the total G. R.
T. come in to the state okay
and this is distributed back to
counties and cities.
And Mr chair just to so I
understand and what would be the
formula to determine.
Let me give you two extremes and
then.
So we were we come to the.
In the middle on one extreme.
If.
That your team was based solely
on contributions.
Lee County would.
Well with the revenue comes back
to because a hundred percent of
that based on the contributions
thank Leonid County contributed
something like.
Over five hundred dollars per.
To state you take.
If we go the other way and do it
purely on a per capita basis
then to population centers.
Las Cruces Albuquerque.
With the majority business issue
here.
Which they still are.
If it was a hundred percent
direction yeah we don't solve
the problem to G. R. T..
Of reductions in southeast New
Mexico so what we did was we
related.
Thirty percent of their culture
is as of as a consequence of
contributions seventy percent
as a consequence of.
So I'm not sure Mr chair and
representative how this would
work for Los Alamos County but a
significant amount of G. R. T.
is generated from the county
some portion of that would then
go back to the county Mr.
And we think that's an equitable
outcome Mr chair.
Which is until you Mr speaker.
The gentle lady.
So we will.
Well she would receive.
In the county distribution would
be four million.
One hundred and ninety one
thousand dollars.
This.
Three hundred million dollar
distribution okay so Mr chair in
addition to the revenue they get
from their local increments.
They would get an additional
four million.
Mr Chairman representative
that's exactly correct.
Okay well we'll we can talk
further about that I have a
suspicion that some communities
won't think that that's a
particularly fair thing to do
thank you very much Mr chairman
Representative Borrego.
Okay
I think that this is a very
creative idea.
but I do have some.
Concerns
First of all.
I think this state does have a
responsibility to help our
counties when they're struggling
and I do believe that
he's counties have very much
contributed to the state's
coffers over the past few years
and and this is a very creative
way of solving an issue
and it but I do have some
questions about this
redistribution because that's
what it is.
So.
It seems to me like this
legislation at least the first
part of it is tied to.
Land use and what is happening
on that particular property and
how that property is sort of
contributing to you know our tax
base I mean that's the way that
I'm.
I've seen this.
We have a problem in the Eddy
County
from what I've understood and
what has been presented to us.
And we're using sort of the
culmination of the entire state.
Counties to fix that problem.
And and I respect that because I
think what I said earlier is
that we do have a responsibility
to help our.
Hello counties I guess you could
say our fellow cities
But.
In doing that.
This.
This so.
Legislation.
Doesn't have a sense that date I
mean we're doing this in
perpetuity and I'm just
wondering about that first are
we because I don't see a sunset
date and this legislation Mr
chairman I mean this is the
change we did not put the sensor
data on there.
The.
Volatility.
And the revenue that would be
coming back.
To counties and cities.
What the function of the
economic activity in the state.
So.
To the extent the G. R. T. rises
and falls economic activity
these distributions would be
somewhat self regulating that is
if we're if we're in a recession
if.
Revenue streams are are not.
We're at eight percent is
automatically going to be
reduced.
Because of the waiting factor
on.
Contributions that.
Mr Chairman representative this
will allow all of the counties
in the state to participate in
those.
Revenues that urgent the in
generated by the oil and gas
industry and as long as oil
stays high my expectation would
be that state revenues.
Robust.
And just so with the
distributions.
Mr chair and representative
Scott I'm not saying it's a bad
thing I'm just saying that we're
doing this our we're proposing
this legislation to fix the
problem.
When the problem is fixed at
some point in time we hope
then this legislation continues
and I just wonder you know at
some point did we come back and
like re evaluate that.
Or should we redefine our our
distribution and that and that's
just one of the questions in my
mind at this point time the
other question I have Mr chair
and Representative has this idea
of.
Gone to the association of
counties at eight commented on
this Mr chairman I have been in
almost constant contact.
Yes elegies and counties there
is some concern that this could
affect other distributions but I
have not.
Any formal opposition from you.
Okay and and Mr chair and
Representative that's why I
bring up the question about the
sense that date because.
You know.
Things change and people get
back on track hopefully you're
counties or cities get back on
track.
And that's the goal
And and that's why I wonder if
that something and that and all
the pages that leave that
question out on the table Mr
chair and and Representative the
other thing is on page three and
four
of the fiscal impact it says
that tax Representative this
conservative about confusion for
the taxpayer
with this new I guess this new
fund and I'm just wondering what
your comments are on the.
Mr Chairman representative
deputed to assist us.
From the taxpayer standpoint
absolutely nothing changes.
Because what we're doing is
taken eight percent of the gross
revenues that are coming into
state.
With respect to the destination
sourcing origin based forcing
none of that changes.
Respect current law.
And are we sure.
The service for the late
distributions of these revenues
have a lot of pressure.
In past years.
In the state and the one that is
most currently relevant would be
the SCG which funds are will.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Representative I guess the last
thing is that I would like to
sit down with you and take a
look at similar to what
Representative Chandler did
since we are the biggest county
in the biggest city in the state
and see what those revenues
would look like in Mr Chairman
representative because of that
because of the economic power is
generated in our Leo because of
the per capita.
Yeah stand to benefit.
More than anyone else in the
state if this legislation thank
you Mr chair representative
share your your responses
Representative Representative.
Thank you Mr chair.
I just have to promise of change
happens about.
You're more as a state
representative by city is
talking about this is.
Is an actor.
And so they present with me
about that.
I think this is a fair way to do
it at least once policies
throughout house.
Back to the
damages at as a more
And I'm gonna talk for probably
all of the smaller communities
in the state.
We may not generate a lot of
income we don't have a lot of
population.
So if there is money is
distributed as well let me take.
That helps us to maintain loans.
Services we need to find as
well.
Representative regulatory.
Albuquerque and Santa Fe and Los
crucis are going to be a full
coverage foundation because they
generate
I think this is.
I have this conversation get
back to.
Helping those who lost.
As a result of this this is
acting as an unintended
consequence of the piece of
legislation legislation I was.
But the so I do appreciate that
thank.
That was quick thank you seven
thousand.
Get extra points.
This is that.
Million.
Okay thank you question comes to
the committee.
If not being that this does have
a fiscal impact is something
that we like to with that we
would like to probably look at
further in the interim before we
take a.
The motion you want to have
anything to the cubs will just
Mr chairman members just a
couple final thoughts I think
that even if we did not have the
issues we do with the two men
are these loses major amounts of
revenue.
The other party committee
secretary to formulate
distribution to all cities and
counties.
Would it would really be helpful
at you know we we as legislators
we care about everything in our
state government whether it's
state government for state
county city whatever it is.
So I think there's merit in both
but just just to let everyone
know Mr chairman that the
bleeding has been occurring in
terms of lost revenue since July
of twenty twenty one.
We really would like to see
something to help the cities and
counties whether this is major
downturn for them and then
finally Mr chairman.
In members and that the formula
distribution reminds me of how
we set up our national
government we have
we have representation two
senators per state and under
this formula everybody basically
has two senators they all get
the same amount of money that we
also have the other part of the
the other side of it where it's
based on population and that
would be our house of
representatives nationally
Congress where is it's based on
population and so this is really
I think a model that very
elegantly mimics what we do at
the national level and it's both
working together that I think
provide very good
very good deal for everybody.
So that's a also.
Thank you Mr chairman I
appreciate the opportunity to
have your committee has been
very.
I appreciate that.
Thank you and we understand the
process.
Would you may.
Well I will take that very very
professional and very good
questions.
Thank you the second second yeah
this is a motion saying that
thank you again for your
presentation I just want to
apologize because I've never met
these two ladies and I know that
you were in the house and here
in the Senate so I I was I was I
thought you were the expert
witnesses.
So I am very sorry about that
and I look forward to talking
with you
thank you thank you that's the
the show for this agenda around
a little bit let's go to the
issue is she are eleven
Representative what I will.
Everyone has been.
Good morning Mr chair and
committee members
I have before I get started I
just want to introduce my expert
witness who is captain Martin
Salazar with the Albuquerque
risky Department and also with
the you local two forty two
forty four.
so I want to thank you for the
opportunity to present this bill
this is H. K. R. eleven Mr chair
and members I also would like to
tell you a little bit of that
captain Salazar decides what I
said he has been I've known him
for a long time because we work
together at the city and
especially during the COVID we
were
Distributing
boxes to our small businesses
together so I've known him for
quite a long time and he is
really better great guy
but his I just want you to thank
him and I have to say this
because I did work we did work
side by side
I just want to acknowledge his
service to our community of
Albuquerque and the state of New
Mexico is involved in a lot of
other things but today we are
here today to discuss the bill
that will help us to recruit and
retain retrain the first
responders to keep the same all
across New Mexico and
Albuquerque.
and especially here at home fire
departments are struggling to
attract new cadets of and we are
proposing a package of bills
that are designed to help keep
our firefighters and to attract
them to New Mexico with the
changing workforce we've all
seen the fire academy enrollment
drop year after year at the same
time we have firefighters
retiring early and so we're
losing firefighters throughout
the state
a number of emergency calls
continues to rise statewide even
as the rate for New Mexico
firefighters remains low of more
than fifty percent of lower than
the rest of the U. S. and that's
that's a fact is there rate is
low and
and and our numbers are
dwindling
H. A. R. eleven helps to address
the recruiting and pay issue our
state is facing by providing an
incentive of exam teen five
thousand dollars of annual
property taxes for certified
firefighters employed full time
by state or local governments
this bill would be sent to the
voters in twenty twenty four and
it would be on the ballot
initiative and what a way to get
more participation from our
constituents in their local
elections by allowing them to
decide the state H. state are
eleven I strongly encourage you
to consider voting in favor of
H. J. R. eleven I stand for
questions and I believe the
captain Salazar is ready to also
make any statements that you
would like if they had that that
just Mr chair Representative I
just like to talk about would
represent regular spoke about as
far as our P. being fifty
percent less than the national
average.
We are creating several
different bills to attract and
keep our current firefighters
the bill as it's written right
now the five thousand dollars
when you look at the FIR talks
the amount being a savings on
average of about a hundred
thirty five dollars a year
there's only about
twelve hundred firefighters that
would be eligible for in the
state but it helps create those
incentives for it and that
number changes based off of what
municipality if your class one
County as Albuquerque where
which has a higher rate of one
point eight one percent when
you're factoring in the tax rate
compared to party which is zero
point three three so the effects
are different throughout the
state but it helps to keep
our best and brightest in New
Mexico and attract more people
here.
We're not asking for extra or
anything like that just to
incentive packaging to put to
the voters on that
Currently my son works at Rudy's
right now and he's making
seventeen dollars an hour with
the average in Albuquerque is
twelve dollars for firefighters.
And so those are little things
we we don't have the ability
right now to pay more but if we
can attract and keep the
firefighters we have in doing so
it also helps our insurance
rates are so ratings are
factored in by insurance
companies for property tax or
even commercial property for
internally for example about
seventeen dollars a month
premium her million dollar of we
have commercial property values
so just by helping those ratings
which are the amount of
firefighters we have it affects
us in a larger way by
our constituents in our
communities getting money to
keep without having to pay
insurance companies for that
just by having firefighters so
this bill
will help with that and again we
appreciate.
Any support we can get for you
thank you Mr chair
representative for your time
thank you get thank you reserves
and else if not go to the
committee for segment the
committee the public for us
support opposition all the
supporters raise your hand both
in the room in online and then

yes it.
Mr chair members of the
committee.
My name is captain will Martinez
I'm also without pre for rescue
I'd like to share the sentiments
with
Representative Borrego capsules
are is been a major resource for
not only our fire department but
also statewide returns are
firefighters so I'm amazing
gentleman I will say that I am
the captain of alternative
response to really
appropriations and that is also
directly directly related to.
The fact we were short of
firefighters we're trying to be
a little more creative in our
response to our members previous
entirely just the fact that we
need more people were there to
respond to.
You know you're dying from
members but also firefighting as
a Diné.
profession so we got to do
whatever we can to bring the
insisted just bolster our
numbers over there for the
future so thank you for for
Oakland this present because
there.
Next yes Sir.
Mr Chairman representative my
name's a communities I represent
New Mexico professional
firefighters as a vice president
for a district three I stand in
support of this bill and we're
hopeful for your support as
well.
Thank you else in the room and
support.
I want to live.
What opposition in the room or
online.
They noted as go to the
committee that questions
comments from the committee.
Senate Representative Harper.
thank you Mr chairman thank you
Representative
the.
Sure.
captain did you see this average
twelve dollars per hour.
So with that Mr chair
representative on average in New
Mexico that is the the right for
firefighters starting out as
twelve dollars an hour I started
twenty two years ago at six
dollars an hour and the change
in twenty two years from six
forty three an hour to.
Twelve fifteen now with changes
in minimum wage that.
the difference in my son like I
said is seventeen dollars in
these right now the sixteen
years old
Mr Abbas flabbergasted
that's what they start out and.
I don't see small businesses and
I don't ever start mine was
so Chairman representative.
we have thousands of volunteers
all the state of New Mexico that
don't make their hours if this
would've been volunteers I want
to get on board.
But it has nothing nothing at
all of your about volunteers.
If we're trying to attract
people it's it's those guys in
our community
what an amazing.
And so how do we have that we
keep those.
Chair representatives so this is
we're trying to create a package
to actually start those
firefighters of the seven
thousand nine hundred volunteers
in New Mexico they after ten
years actually receive the
patient pension that's not
contributed and some departments
actually there pay per call
based off of that so paid for
qualitative Department
with our other bills this is
come up before and one of the
bills on our federal approve
mint
Three forty five we're looking
at an educational element of
that to educate.
Generations of two pointers in
the average age for volunteer
firefighter in New Mexico right
now sixty three years old so
we're trying to bring more
people in incentivize it or if
the community we can get funding
for example Valencia County has
twenty four paid firefighters if
we can get them two or three
more with at and this is like
this and help the surrounding
communities around once you
County there volunteers
transform into rate
those are goals this is just a
process right now has to go to
ballot but in the meantime we're
working with other agencies
within the state to try to
include volunteers and our other
initiatives we need food and
currently now in training if we
any training posted there
invited there's no charge or
anything like that we provide
lunches and and things because
we all work together at the end
of the day
on average a hundred
firefighters die somewhere in
the country every year.
New Mexico is not immune to that
obviously we had one last year
the year before we have one in
its in its ongoing process and
we're trying to change that and
Mr chair and representative
these are the issues but we are
working on that
there's not an organized stated
point of contact for each one so
we reach out to different
volunteer organizations as far
as firefighters to see about
getting what we can do to get
them together and I in the
interim my goal is now unable in
Reno so there's actually a DMS
conference and a lot of those
will come together and we're
trying to.
Organize and as a whole even if
we can just once a month to talk
about what we can do to help
each other.
and there's not a single answer
to to how we can get him in the
hard part is communication
getting on and we try we're
trying to do it through
conferences we're trying to
reach out to the state fire
marshal's office a lot of times
contacts are updated things like
that so our purpose is to help.
Get as much as we can and bring
people on board and if we have
to later on changing things to
include them we want to we all
as I said we all go through the
same training and they volunteer
their time we just don't have a
point of contact to get that but
we are working on it Mr chair
representative.
Thank you Mr Representative.
I go back to what I said a few
times in this committee okay
another hole and cheese and.
But that we're not somebody else
not that we don't appreciate and
love what you do I love my
volunteers as a more Mr chair.
So.
The answer that I can talk a
little bit about Representative
see we can do that volunteers
thank you Representative
Representative Harper.
Thank you chairman
Representative good to see you
and captain thank you for being
here I just a couple kind of
clarifying questions that I so I
can understand
And I guess offer start by
saying
You know we all love our
firefighters you know who
Senator lie on to run into a
burning burning building right
and I'm actually personally
carried some legislation to top
our firefighters right so we we
are so grateful
So I guess my first question is
you brought up that the starting
salary for it this is an
Bernalillo fire is not always
Representative it's it's an
average throughout the state
because we have outlined yours
like right around our ups are
like Los Alamos and Carlsbad
that are higher rates that
offset it so our small
communities last minute
land and other places are the
twelve fifty an hour and even
with us once our firefighters
come out of tree of training
there at fourteen dollars an
hour internally so those things
those factors so averages twelve
because of minimum wage honestly
is is one reason because of that
yeah so it's a chairman and the
Representative and captain I was
kind of money my order was that
worst socially starting them at
minimum wage which I think we
can all agree is a problem
being someone minimum wage to
run into a burning building is.
Why not right I think we all
agree on the problem
Maybe maybe we can talk about
different solutions that up
before I get there so what is
the we talk about the starting
staff what is like the average
for somebody's been in for like
ten fifteen years what's the
average that we see across the
state Mr chair representative
you're looking at a little above
forty five thousand dollars the
current average right now for
firefighters as per the FIR and
local studies is thirty nine
thousand dollars right
so chair representative captain
thank you for that
So so then I guess the question
is and I I kind of the answer
because I'm actually a really
good friend who was the former
fire chief for the Kirtland
airforce for department but
So.
If we're we're not being paid.
You know but you know that you
know we kind of the median
salary right at the median
income of the household Mexico's
like fifty four thousand dollars
were not there
We have a a hiring.
All right now I mean do you have
it sees right now in your
department.
Mr Chairman representative yes
we do so out of the fire for
example has we're mandate or
we're budgeted for seven hundred
and sixty one we have the seven
hundred and twelve.
We have open enrollment we hire
forty five and we currently have
twenty nine going to the process
we're still short.
On that small and when we talked
about going to county fully
staffed at twenty four and their
short because they don't have a
budget to get anymore it's a
national issue part of the
package we've created
again house bill three forty
five a recruitment fund is to
help with that is bonuses to
bring firefighters on to
statewide departments and all of
our bills are statewide related
they're not
specific differently accounting
our peer support we have orange
appears fourteen.
But other departments don't
we're trying to
bring parity within our
firefighters the state we can't
raise minimum wage just for
firefighters but we can if we
can allow small incentives for
recruitment bonus property tax
exemption in state tuition for
people to move here for their
kids instead of having to wait a
year those are little things
we're trying to do as a whole
tip to bring our firefighters
both rate and eventually
volunteer once we can coordinate
that on there but again our
dilemma is we can't give them a
raise together because it it
affects municipalities as
Representative Duncan said
within in the more there's just
not a lot of money but if we can
help with the extra funds this
year that the state has to give
incentives to keep our people
and bring more people here we
can hopefully work on those
wages later it's just little
steps right now at.
But Representative Harper one
additional thing that we didn't
say up front is that often times
and and for the most part
firefighters to not receive
social security and that is a
federal there was I think back
in right president Reagan's time
there was a a move to accept
firefighters from signing on for
social security my mother is a
window of my father and that's
part of the reason I'm doing
this is because my father was a
thirty year firefighter and in
Los Alamos she does not receive
social security or after his
death and so you know I think
that this is up as the captain
said a parity issue that we need
to solve and this is our move
right now just to try to.
Well some of those.
Gaps that we see that are and we
do have a package I am carrying
about three or four bills and
there's some other people carry
some other bills but we're
looking at insurance we're
looking at how do we attract
firefighters water some
incentives that we could find
on the on the flip side I'm also
talking I sit on the board of
directors of the credit union
and in the past some of the
things that we have done is we
have lowered the interest rate
just a tad to try to help them
with their mortgages and stuff
like that but this is a big
issue and then to add to that
sometimes we have a compression
issue we're talking about
firefighters that have been in
the system for a long time and
then you firefighters coming and
then a little bit higher rate so
then you can see that there is a
compression issue in this
employment so there are a number
of things that need to be
addressed this is really our
start to fixing some of these
issues.
terms of captain thank you for
that I'm and.
So I'll just get quickly to the
point I think for we're going
along here
so.
what I heard the answer to my my
question do we have or hiring
problem is is hello we're we
have authorization for about
seven hundred eighty issue folks
and we're down about forty.
that's a five percent rate and
so why do we have so many I.
They're making not much money
and and the answer is it's a
great job
talking my friend is a fired
former fire chief right I mean
they aren't you get paid to
Sleet right I mean you get to
the year with that amazing group
of people right that you get to
go out and help people right you
it it's a highly desired job you
get paid overtime.
And and so I I think.
There are several issues here
that were raised that we need to
look at I mean the social
security the insurance.
Raising their rate I think these
are all things that we need to
look at but.
We know at the state level.
Right the this is the kind of a
municipality county kind of
issue in my mind when you look
at.
Protect your New Mexico we have
the second lowest property tax
in the US.
it aside from Bernalillo county
you have very low property tax
and I don't hear anyone saying I
move to New Mexico because of
our low property tax rate
it's so I'm I'm just taking this
I agree with the problem and I
think there are several
potential solutions I don't
think this solution would
actually make that big of a
difference I think
it is just is just wrong I'm
coming from.
Yeah and and and again just to
be brief I just want to kind of
I say chairman and committee
members that kind of the policy
of this committee has been
recommend we we continue
You know that we we timetable
these kinds of bills that of a
fiscal impact this is a little
little minor one to the state
but it is a fiscal impact to
counties and to our property
taxes and we did that was a
Representative outcomes bills.
we help them until we put the
tax package together mystery
decided that those two bills
would be part of the package we
don't know into the tax package
is a joint they were built right
there were joint memorials
secretary resolutions and that's
why let's in our individually
chairman I think
there are lots of different ways
that we can fix this problem
and.
Policy wise I'm not sure I agree
with it but also just in our
commitment to not possible thank
you to every comments any other
questions or comments from the
committee it's not
Representative.
I move that we rarely table.
R. thank you very much there's
second.
Representative Harper.
The motion saying that
representative image have to
thank you for your patience
what.
If they want to.
K. to put a substitute for
Senate bill one forty seven as
amended tax changes
Representative Harper and
Senator Shendo acting today.
That right Mrs to that amendment
the.
We've been.
Visit rewriting.
Whatever you folks are ready the
floor is yours.
All right thank you chairman
committee members so.
I've a very much appreciated
that this administration and
this tax secretary has brought
to us tax clean up bills pretty
regularly
and this is something that we as
a committee have encouraged that
the tax department every year
bring us cleanup because folks
are smart and they will find
ways around what we meant
and it's and so we clarified
that also there are legitimate
questions that are practitioners
bring up the business world
brings up and if we can bring
clarity to those things it makes
it easier on them and the
department.
and also there's just some stuff
that to.
All these to be removed from the
code or or some things that to
you know the the secretary she's
and her department working
through that the code are.
Is that that they realize could
be efficiencies that are added
so I'm I very much appreciate
that department has been working
on this bill this was presented
to rest up during the interim
all these items were in there
they were presented to rest up
there are quite a number of
items in here
and I'll turn over to the
secretary who will go through
these one by one because we were
accused on the floor earlier
this session of rushing through
a a description of the tax
cleanup bill from a couple years
ago and I I I remember very
clearly we went through
everything line by line but I
wanna make sure that we just
have everything on the record
here so that to
we don't have any
we stay away from some of being
able to accuse us of that so
with that all the I'll turn over
to my co sponsor the secretary.
The members of the take a look
at the ranking member are
percent they help to be as
comfortable as presenting.
The the thank you Mr chairman
and members of the committee of
us the real rent to owns the you
know.
Yep yeah the you know this is a
claim a bill it makes several
small but significant
administrative changes and then
we'll have the secretary go to
the state board changes.
Thank you Mr chair members of
the committee I was planning on
giving you the highlights not
section by section for your own
time and survival but I I'll go
section by section I can do that
too.
Okay so
I think I'm local dive right and
of section one of this bill
requires tax and Rev to annually
publish a tax expenditure budget
this is something we've been
doing since about twenty twelve
under an executive order but
this would cut a fire
requirement to do that in
statute.
pool was just of the the section
to cannabis excise tax
distribution cleanup it doesn't
change anything about how much
is owed or where it goes but it
does just clean up some of the
language to prevent confusion or
possible inconsistency section
three has to do with the ability
of tax and Representative to
share certain data on the
special fuels tax with the DOT's
so that they can meet their
reporting requirements I believe
it's to federal agencies it
would give them the same
information on the special fuels
tax that they already have on
the gasoline tax
section four has some technical
cleanup to business code
reporting language it again it
doesn't change a tax amount or
who pays that are where it goes
just some technical clean up.
Section five streamlines the
ability for a tax payer to
request a refund for or the
insurance premium tax
long story short there are some
programs where you're allowed to
automatically have request your
refund within amended return
we're adding premium tax to that
otherwise under current law they
have to minute return and
separately request a refund
there's no need for those two
steps
several sections their sections
six seventeen twenty and twenty
four I'll have to do is
standardizing the compliance
checks the taxed Representative
does when various industries
renew their licenses like for
example if you go to renew a
liquor license will check to
make sure that the tax payer is
up to date on their liquor
excise tax payments and the G.
R. T. and so it's just
streamlining our ability to
process those checks by making
the language the same throughout
all the different tax programs.
section seven clarifies the
requirements for tribal members
to have their income exempt from
Pat it has to do with changing
the word lives to domicile to to
better track federal law and the
federal exemption for that
tribal income tax.
section nine make some minor
technical changes to the
definition it disclosed agency
this is follow up on on changes
we made last year it just with
more input from the tax
practitioner community.
I'm sorry skip section eight
eight thank you has to do with
the corporate income tax
language around pass through
entities you could see this as
sort of a companion to the the
bill that's passed out of here
already making changes to the
pastor entity exemption and
credit.
Section ten are prevents the
double taxation of the cannabis
excise tax only no longer
cigarette that was amended out
in the Senate finance it
basically under current law if
your cannabis retailer you have
to collect the cannabis excise
tax rate G. R. T. on what you
collected and then sent the
cannabis excise tax to the state
so there's a very clear double
taxation taxation there that
wasn't intended when that bill
was passed the canvas excise tax
act so just removing that double
taxation section eleven has some
clarification about had services
used by governments also being
exempt from the compensating tax
just like our goods intangibles
we think that has a very minor
if any fiscal impact but it's
good for consistency section
twelve is very minor cleanup two
citations and law that are
repealed are obsolete section
thirteen is similar to a
standalone bill but it exams are
but payments from the fed's that
come through Medicaid to New
Mexico health care providers so
that we're not charging the G.
R. T. in the full amount of the
our payments can be used towards
health care so that has a
nonrecurring fiscal impact
section fourteen makes minor
clarifications about
alternative evidence being used
if you don't have an and TTC and
nontaxable transaction
certificate for us certain
manufacture deduction again it
doesn't expand the deduction or
change what's taxable it just
makes very clear right there in
law that you can submit
alternative evidence to claim
the deduction section fifteen
levels the playing field by with
the way that we treat
ebook licenses at public
libraries currently hard copy
books are not subject to G. R.
T. but if they license out E.
books it is there's no reason in
tax code in this is a benefit to
municipal libraries mainly.
section sixteen is similar to a
bill that was and that was
passed last year but not enacted
it allows tribes to set their
own tribal tax rate with full
sovereignty regardless of what
the neighboring county G. R. T.
right as.
sections there's several
sections here eighteen twenty
seven and twenty eight repeal
obsolete or expired sections of
the tax code just to make these
blue books a little shorter
I can tell you in detail what
those are if you like but I I
won't go through the mall
section nineteen clarifies the
trip tax act to basically
clarify that there's that
there's a credit if you pay the
trip Tax against you what would
otherwise be your weight
distance tax or your motor
vehicle registration fee or off
or making clear that you can't
offset more than you all so that
there's there's not a a loophole
there.
Sections twenty one and twenty
five clarify certain things
about self insured
self procured insurance
providers and that they still of
the premium tax this is
technical cleanup from when the
premium tax moved over from
superintendent of insurance to
tax and Rev section twenty two
makes clear in statute that the
medical insurance pool credit
what's called the new maps
credit for insurance is not
refundable or and it can't be
transferred or carried forward
this is how that credit has
always been implemented and
always been administered it's
just codifying in statute that
that's the case to get it
doesn't raise any revenue or
raise taxes on anyone.
Section twenty three moves the
cannabis excise tax to
destination based sourcing to
match the G. R. T. this was an
oversight in the way that
cannabis excise tax was enacted
and we don't want taxpayers to
have to track two different
things here they pay their G. R.
T. at the destination their
cannabis tax at the origin and
the only time it will matter is
if it's delivered somewhere
different than where your store
is located that that'll be good
for tax payer burden yes the
section twenty six has to do
with
the testing requirements for
CPA's for tax practitioners of
sickly they came to us the CPA
society came and said we're
having trouble we're getting our
test results slowly and the
statute gives us eighteen months
from when we take the test to
pass all parts this would give
them eighteen months from when
they get their test results that
they have the full benefit of
the eighteen months to pass the
test.
And that is all Mr Chairman
questions.
Legislation.

Seven the reason I had an online
started will serve.
