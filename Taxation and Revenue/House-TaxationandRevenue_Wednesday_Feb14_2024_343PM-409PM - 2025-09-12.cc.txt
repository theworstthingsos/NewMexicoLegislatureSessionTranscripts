So matter by ster
and mister chairman we have a
corn
thank you we have a courier I am
not the handsome and amazing
chair went to but I want to
thank him and the vice chair
for.
That said we members we have two
bills on the agenda will go in
order if we have senate bill to
forty six which is the capitally
reauthorization bill they'll be
followed by senator two seventy
five which is the capital of a
project's bill.
And was that madam vice chair
the time is yours thank you.
This is the senate finance.
This.
Projects that were authorized.
Estimated balance on these
projects included in this bill
as.
The.
Mr chair committee i'm kelly
cars well with el.
My name is.
Thank you for being here
we will first go to the audience
anyone here and support this
legislation.
Yeah.
The.
Right anyone in opposition.
Anyone on.
Alright
and any further comments most
year no m.
I got to committee questions.
Represent mr chair
representative
i'm confused about this document
it says
just has a bunch of zeroes does
that mean that they just haven't
spent anything.
Mr chair representative no
essentially since this is a
reauthorization build they just
show up as zeroes because
there's no new appropriate
but the projects presumably were
reatherized because they have
some balance remaining great
thank you that's it mister chair
thank you very much
other questions from the
committee representative
mister just the quick question.
Mr chair
most chair can you tell me how
long of a period of time we're
reauthorizing projects that have
been authorized can you tell me
is ten years we keep up the
authorities
mr chair representative dunkin
so typically the reauthorization
period
is two years for the projects
that are in this bell
the oldest project in this bill
was originally reason was
originally authorized in two
thousand twelve there's only one
of those and then speaking a
little off the cuff here but I
think there's maybe two from
twenty fourteen.
A few from twenty sixteen and
most of the projects that are
reauthorized and the spell were
originally appropriate and
twenty twenty or later
and thank you that's my
question.
Thank you represent dugging.
Represent scott
representative durken stole my
fund.
Oh would appreciate seeing this
aged the next time we go through
this to see where and how much
has been out there to three five
years or longer but that's.
The.
Follow up to
a representative or tes.
You have the zeroes does someone
go into the later on and include
the the mou.
Mrperiod chair representative no
essentially dfa will go through
an administrative process
assuming the bill is passed to
do whatever kind of
reauthorization for every
project is included in the bill
and whatever balance they have
at that time would carry forward
but there's no their essentially
there's no new money being
appropriate at which is why
they're showing that way now and
mister caron and
cabinet secretary right
mr chair representative now
you're giving me way too much
credit there i'm capital outlay
analysis
there's always a career landed
right
so
these are funds that have not
been spent and are being
reappropriate and for how long
mister chair representative yes
so projects can request
reatorization when they have
remaining balances for various
reasons they can do it to extend
time they can do it to expand
the purpose of a project so
maybe the language was too
limiting they can do it to
completely change the purpose of
a project or sometimes technical
fixes like just changing the
administrative agency it goes
to.
Thank you mister.
Okay.
So I I just have a couple quick
comments
first of the.
Capital outway for which council
it's a lot of work to put
capital together and the real
reservation altogether.
But just for for newer members
atification right so when we do
a capital out.
A part of that bill says these
bines will be sold for these
particular projects and there's
a duration.
That those projects have to be
done b.
Four years
and if it's not completed within
those four years you can reason
rise it to extended out.
Two or three more years to fish
the project
that said just as an example
so the last twelve years in rear
rancho the were actual
delegation has been putting
capitalist funds towards the
possible double current road
project.
Very.
Twelve years and we have like
fifteen different line items of
appropriations we've given over
the years and about.
Half of them are spen.
We actually consolidate.
Will go back to you in a moment
here but just for members
atification we really should be
working with all the agencies
that we appropriate these funds
to asking them how are things
going how can I help you are you
spending these funds because we
really don't want to be here in
a real serious ashing bill we'd
would rather not but sometimes
they're valid reasons for that.
And i'll tell you in the past
i've heard
foot legislator senators
represents talk about we should
stop doing the authorization
bills and if you can't spend the
money in the right amount of
time that you just expire and I
was very like in favor of that
until I had a project there was
about to expire
but if we
are more proactive and making
sure that our our folks are
spending down their balances
and will end up having free
projects lasting them our things
going and also making sure that
we're funding projects there
because we really don't want to
be here that said that he
represent rather not sometimes
you know I I totally understand
past having been on the other
side of legislator senators list
my representative and I said
if you can't spend the money in
the right time.
There's in favor of that until I
had a project that need to be
taken
we have complete that project
were active and making sure
example are false restaurants
and a panel where projects seem
to write as we met also make
sure that we're funding
sometimes that I don't want to
be that's not all
an easy represent it's not
always easy
you know
you know having been
reappropriate watch those
you know
if you can't spend
a time to get
a project
we complete their process in
their insurance meeting that
works
but
will end up handling the right
and also make sure thank you
to get something that you all
should do.
Then at some point we have to
find
paperwork.
One more step in the process of.
Manifest your thank you for that
clear.
All right well represent
customer thank you mister
chairman I make a do pass motion
and
send a bill for forty six second
all right so we have
first buyers have caused you
second by everyone else on the
committee substitute for senate
bill to forty six is there any
opposition to that motion
on you have a devastat.
Yeah.
I love these new makes all right
thank you members will move on
to the last item of our agenda
which is senate bill two fifty
seven capital outlay projects
and matter by share you're once
again.
Our next in looks like final
bill of the session in our tax
committee.
It's.
The.
Seventy three point five million
in other state.
More than fourteen hundred
capital project statewide.
The bill includes approximately
four hundred and six million.
And five hundred and twenty six
million for local projects the
severance tax bonding
authorizations.
Projects in fy twenty five.
These appropriations were added
by.
The.
The charts before you list all
the projects in the amounts
included in the bill.
The major projects include
thirty million for the
behaviour.
Yeah.
For water trust board projects
fourteen million f.
Sixty million for improvements
to state parts thirty four
million.
Finally the bill also strikes a
requirement for twenty twenty
three projects funded.
Operations within the first
fiscal year neting back.
No similar requirements.
We'll have the same experts with
us.
The.
They came out of chair.
We'll now go to the audience any
here wishing to speak and
support legislation.
Anyone wishing to speak an
opposition to the legislation.
The.
Either so we will now go to
committee four questions.
Reverse god
at this
house forty east of gala.
Republican bill analysis.
Twenty eight point seven to
thirty point seven mile post for
almost sixty three million
dollars.
Is that really what interstate.
Thirty million dollars a mile.
Mister chair
internally sent a finance so
these numbers that we were
provided were provided to us by
the department of transportation
these are all projects that have
been better by them and are on
the shelf ready to go in
mobilise and unfortunately that
is.
Should in the market today
you're over year inflation.
And this chairman.
Representative expert is there
some federal dollars.
Representative scott so there
are federal dollars available so
with in the senate finance
amendment you are on a finance
proposed to only authorize three
hundred and twenty million
dollars worth of spinach bonds
to be able to supplement federal
dollars and other dollars that
are already in the pike to
complete four hundred.
Quickly for second
think rivers of sky
representative dunkin
thank you mister.
Is this list.
The.
Could there be some mistakes on
this list i'm looking at one of
the projects from my community
and I thought th.
This is an up.
Mr chair representative dunkin
so you're looking at one of the
charts legislative council.
Yes our understanding from
council services this is the
less of projects that is
included in the bell so you know
it's possible that community
requested additional funding and
somebody sponsored that project.
Thank you represent a dunkin.
Yeah.
I have just a few comments.
So I I again want to think
adrian called linda and michelle
for all the ministers.
This is literally the most
complicated bill of the session
and it takes a ton of work and
also
kevin for.
The last.
Ten years as actually gone
through and lined by wire.
She went and verified that
everything was correct
over the last ten years we have
found only one error
so that's pretty amazing so we
have some amazing staff and want
to thank you offer the time.
And work there now there is
something in this bill that is
not normal and I just want to
talk about that for a minute
just so they were all aware.
Normally this bill has the
legislative projects the
executive projects there's a
framework that i'll have sea
puts together and it's
negotiated out and
normally we pay for this bill
out of severance tax bonding
rights revenue we get from
serving taxes we look at how
much is needed for existing
bonding and and leftovers
there's a formula
that I will go into here but
then we decide how much we can
find and that's what funds these
projects because this year
yeah thank you mister speaker
because this year and last year
as well we have so much
one time revenue it makes sense
to spend it on infrastructure
and I think it's been very wise
of the legislature to use
general fund money for capital
out.
And so that's what's
being done here that's that's a
little bit different
but it's a the thing that is
different from last year that I
just wanted to bring attention
to you is we are as reps of
scott mentioned funding some big
road projects and this was part
of a senate finance amendment.
Um and really was in response to
this year there was not a
section nine and house bill
three
house bill three is the
transportation budget and the
last several years you've had a
section three link whose road
projects and this year there was
not a session three and at all a
lot of us on the transportation
committee and elsewhere were
although a little
about guested and trying to
figure out how we could find
some road projects and so what
ended up happening was the
senate added this amendment and
they are using spinach bonds.
And sponge barns is just a fancy
way of saying instead of that
revenue instead of looking at
how much we can bond for ten
years we're just gonna quickly
born it for like a day and turn
it all into cash.
A little more covered in that
protest that just of it
and so
I I guess
manifest share my first question
is if we did not have that in
the bill where with this money
goal.
And maybe your experts can help
you
mister chair so the bill
specifically provides
authorization to the board of
finance to issue those bonds and
afly twenty five upon
certification by the department
of transportation for the need
for those bonds so essentially
it's coming out of FY twenty
five bonding.
So many by chair and cali
thank you for for that
and perhaps i'm I mistaken
but my understand is because we
weren't bonding against those
revenues they would be flowing
into the serious tax permanent
fund
mr chair that would be true if
the authorization was for f by
twenty four but so essentially
if you got if you are using
bonding this year you'd be
bottom and stuff like twenty
four capacity next year if you
are to use funding you would be
finding against I fight twenty
five capacity.
What we think of and how we
appropriate these dollars it's
kind of next year's capacity
okay so
my car I think you probably
understand that I missed that
that new ones I I thought we
were gonna be putting less into
a serious tax permanent fund
because of this provision but
i'm seeing adrian chicken has
had no sort thank you that makes
me that makes me happy to know
that we're still going to see a
big and flow into the service.
Me say several times was in a
really bad place many years ago
getting like zero dollars many
years in a row and paying out
the four point whatever percent
plus being subject to the
fluctuations in the market so I
would like to hear this money is
going in there so then just to
make sure I understand it and
i'm sure calling so
we are sponged binding capacity
for FY twenty five.
And that means when we come back
here next year
for capital outlay
the decision will be again be
doing as general fine money
and if hopefully things are
still going well it will
probably do that but if we were
going to bid anything from
service tax dollars and twenty
five it has to be be reduced by
what we sponged here in my
understand that correctly
mr chair yes and just to kind of
add one more.
Thing to your question the
the avoided debt service from
not doing long term binding
capacity with capital outlay
assuming senate bill to
seventeen what you all.
Past on monday is approved in
the house before the session is
over that money would be
captured to flow to the
permanent find and that will
continue to happen from last
year up to roughly a billion
dollars over the next ten years
as well so there is overall
still significant money flowing
to the permanent fund
yeah thank you manifest year and
calling thank you for that
so
aside from then aside from the
using general fund this year
something is a good thing and
then the sponge bonding of a for
twenty five otherwise this does
essentially identical to the
ones we've seen here many years
in the past
any other questions are from
committee repsy berego
question
so
these are a glomiration of all
of the projects that all of the
representatives put in right
because I was just a kind of
like a representative dunkin
mister chair there was a park
that I didn't see and here that
I
thought i'd put in and I got a
list so I know I did I just
wondered.
What might have happe.
Mister chair representative that
would be a question to take to
legislative council but
yes so the spell shed included
the essentially the state agency
framework
as well as all of the projects
that you all ultimately put on
your funding sheets that went to
legislative council.
Rips up rego maybe just to help
I know sometimes all through the
listing almost something
that it's like in a multi county
project list or you know it
might just be in the right
lumpton
thank you sir
thank you representatives.
Right we have a do pass motion
for actually substitute for
senator two seventy five as
amended firm representative or
tears in a second representative
hernandez any further
discussion.
All right any objection to that
motion.
Seeing none you have a do pass.
Thank you matter vice chair
thank you committee members is
your appropriate term to appoint
a new text
you'll never know
we we stand adjourned.
