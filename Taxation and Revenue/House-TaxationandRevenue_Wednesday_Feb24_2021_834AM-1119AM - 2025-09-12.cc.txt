Is presenting a bill as well and
another committee thank you
Representative Montoya.
Representative Romero.
Representative Scott.
Here
Stansbury.
Your.
Representative Strickler.
Ister Chandler.
Your.
Chairman Martinez.
I'm here we have a quorum
members and we're gonna pick up
right where we left off with
Representative Harper and house
bill two seventy eight.
Take it away Representative.
Thank you chairman
So.
Last time we.
Went over.
How we got to gross receipts tax
differences between the gross
receipts tax a sales tax.
Where we fall in the nation when
it comes to looking at.
the impacts of that tax on
businesses.
talk about Swiss cheese.
The tax code and we talked about
your meeting.
And.
So I want to.
Take up
And then we'll go into that the
meat of the bill.
Is no Representative mccamly and
I when we first came in
together.
No saw this gross receipts tax
problem and we.
We are.
You know he had a small business
use where some of the issues and
you know my dad being an
accountant I was aware of the
issue so we said okay let's see
if we can't do something about
this.
And we met with Richard Anklam.
And the yeah I was meeting with
me my family and my dad Richard
Anklam.
And that we had a long chat
about what the options are.
And the.
Thank you suggested that we
address some of this pyramid
just look at the business to
business professional services.
Permitting.
And the.
I said okay that that sounds
great but I'd fall in love with
another idea.
Tom Taylor and and the bill
share
at this.
Idea to revert back to a pure
gross receipts tax and go to a
to percent.
And I I just thought that was
the.
Really just a just a really cool
idea.
And that so what was it and.
the problem was we don't have
any data.
Sure that was possible.
And the we put some money in the
budget is about twenty million
dollars in the budget I'm sorry
two hundred thousand dollars in
the budget to a study by the
governor line item veto it.
and so I you know got super
frustrated and said well you
know.
First in yonder whoever else.
Doing the study would have to
use our data.
And we have access to our data
and we know how to word excel so
what's your own start your own
analysis.
And that was was a lot of fun it
took about a year put together
frankly sin and a couple people
from TRD reviews helps.
But the long
long and short of it is.
We found you could reduce the
state tax rate to less than two
percent.
What you can do that with the
county and unitas right and I
will going to why is that it's
kind of in the weeds but
essentially the lowest total you
could reduce the tax rate to is
about three and a half percent.
Which sounds awesome except
would be introducing permitting
you know by removing all the
searches actually credits
interesting marketing.
Answering a percentages too
high.
really one percent is where you
should be two percent maybe
three to have is just too high.
So I was really heartbroken you
know if we came to this
conclusion I was actually in
Africa working on the boat
Crisis you know skyping with
police and and we're just I will
for for about two weeks
artistically are broken.
But then came to the realization
well disturbing is the problem.
Let's just address the
permitting.
And and it took me two years to
basically come to what Richard
Engel told me in the family to
do.
The first time that wasn't.
So.
Anyway that's.
We spent the next years than in
the rest up in trump Committee
working together Republicans and
Democrats house and Senate on a
bill to do just that.
It was a house bill for twelve.
Agency for twelve.
And that passed the house
unanimously.
in the Senate are a rare to
joint committee hearing where
they had lined up it was almost
a hundred lobbyists lined up to
speak against the bill.
and in the end there are some
amendment serving drafted is
about to go but due to
A Facebook post by our former
governor.
Basically scared the Senate.
And the the building not
it brought up for the amendments
and take off the floor so that
well my great disappointments
that to.
that we were able to do that
but.
Over these last few years we've
basically taken that bill and
passed pieces of it kind of
piecemeal we've got about two
thirds that bill already.
the other server really kind of
the meaningful staff I would say
is still undone.
And this bill before you does
some of those things.
and and again kind of looking at
well you know big huge bills
don't often do all the
legislature refuses to smell
it takes longer it's more
frustrating but.
There's usually more success we
do it that way.
So
this bill really does two things
now we're getting to the meat of
the bill.
The first will be familiar to
all of you
we had
The investment
tax credit last year.
I needed to be renewed with
sunsetting.
And the the chairman and I work
together to also include
manufacturing equipment duction
as part of that bill and in the
end that ended up
Not making it through again some
some politics there but the
point of this is.
I get addressing permitting not
taxing business imports to the
extent that we can we're the
only state.
Right now that taxes
manufacturing equipment.
There are a handful of states.
That have no income tax this is
laid out our our our I always no
sales tax no tax it and then
there's like forty one states
that specifically don't tax it.
This would be great it would
really make it so that IRB's are
much less needed and are kind of
a weird constructs.
And this would help all small
businesses right now.
If you are a big business a big
guy and you can hire a lawyer
you know to to work with you on
an I. R. B. and you get a local
government to agree to an I. R.
B. then you don't pay for.
Tax on manufacturing equipment
if you're a small pop of
Business and you need to
purchase.
You know our our piece of
equipment you're you're not to
go through the effort to pay a
lawyer to get an I. R. B.
And so this would really help
all small businesses across the
state kind of level the playing
field as well.
So this this is something we
talk about.
Last year.
That's one part of the bill that
the other part is looking at
this business to business
professional services.
Taxation.
So.
When you look at your meeting.
All states have a little bit of
permitting to some extent right
and we we we don't need to get
rid of all right we just don't
want to what we're other states
want to kind of the real attack
so you know in the business goes
and buys a computer or a desk
that's taxed but other states do
that too.
We don't we don't need to fix
that where we really look where
is the professional service so
when the business goes out and
hires an accountant.
to their taxes.
When they hire a lawyer to do
legal services when they
contract out HR payroll.
We tax those things here in New
Mexico and the vast majority of
other states don't.
so looking at those most Regis
forms of permitting.
This bill provides.
A deduction to gross receipts
tax for.
Those are.
We we we selected seven
business to business
professional services.
And in the bill we've got
accounting and bookkeeping HR
payroll I. T. services legal
services.
Engineering temp temporary
services we hired to help staff
person and then financial
management services.
So if I business goes.
out to another business for
these things
They would no longer pay the
gross receipts tax.
Again looking at how the
commerce chain you know the cost
of those services are gonna get
rolled up into the cost of
whatever product you're selling.
And that product will be taxed
the final step.
That's really what we're trying
to do here that's where the
legislature's been moving these
last twenty years is towards a
broad based retail sales tax.
the the other thing I'll mention
in this regard in New Mexico
I'll be ready for for questions.
We want to make sure.
That we're still maintaining a
broad base.
Well except for gross receipts
tax right so a lot of our
economy now is professional
services.
We wanna make sure that we are
taxing everything you've heard
me say I think we should tax
every single right.
So the way this bill structured
it only applies if it's a
business to business
transactions.
So if I go to an accountant
personally I would still be
charged because receipts tax.
Because it's the last stop.
Or if I went to a lawyer and had
some so we'll work god that
still be taxed because that's
the last stop what tax every.
but if.
Business you know if it's
you know K. harbor Inc.
And I go to a.
An account I'm that would not be
taxed because in the end that
cost is rolled up into my final
product which when it sold was
taxed.
So we're still maintaining that
broad based still taxing
professional services just not
with its business to business
transactions.
And and that helps often
represent this people like why
are you giving lawyers a tax
break where you giving accounts
taxpayers anymore you're you're
misunderstanding.
Right now we're not doing that
of what's happening.
Is the small business that can't
higher
no staff attorney on staff HR
payroll on staff accountant.
They.
Small business is now given a
small tax break
but and that
is rolled up to the final cost
of the product.
But it's it's this is really
just a huge help to small
businesses would be contracted
for this work.
I'm putting them on a more level
playing field list was medium
and large size businesses we
have talked with other small
business topics they say this
would be huge you know this you
know the I can hire another
person you know if we're able to
do these kinds of things.
And and again making us more
competitive with our our
neighbors remember I mentioned.
Hey what sector economy here in
your effective tax rate might be
seventeen percent.
Well this could this would be a
huge step in the right direction
to help rectify that.
Okay so Chairman was that thank
you again for the.
Opportunity to continue the
discussion on our happy to stand
for questions.
Thank you Representative Harper
and and thanks for your
continued work on this I I do
remember.
Some of those bills you
mentioned that was early in my
tenure at the legislature and
and I I I remember how difficult
they are I do take a little
exception though when when you
said that it was fun working on
all of those reports.
Jenny was that fun so I'll I'll
take that with a grain of salt
but the you've you've certainly
done a lot of work and we we
appreciate that if I go to
committee I want to go to the
audience and see if there are
any.
Folks who would like to give
their opinion on house bill two
seventy eight.
let's go to those in favor
please raise your hand and I
will call on you.
Thank.
I see one hand up and it's Carla
Sonntag good morning.
Good morning Mr chairman and
members of the committee on
Carlos contact the president of
the New Mexico business
coalition we are the state
affiliate for the national
association of manufacturers.
We strongly support this bill we
think that it corrects all
horrible problem that New Mexico
has had for many years.
It provides us what we have been
looking for in some of the tax
reform that we have been
lobbying for for many many years
the issue of taxing Services has
been a serious detriment to
businesses expanding or coming
to our state and as the sponsors
that it's most harmful to the
smaller businesses.
That taxes never made that and
to have it corrected would not
only make us more competitive
with our surrounding states but
it would help the small business
that really needs that help
right now.
We appreciate all of the work
the sponsor has done for many
many years to correct some of
the problems in our tax system
in New Mexico we want to thank
him for that dedication and hard
work we know it can't always be
fun and we encourage the
committee to support this bill
thank you.
Thank you for being here anyone
else's report of house bill two
seventy eight.
Right let's go to all those in
opposition of house bill two
seventy eight raise your hand.
Okay let's go to Paul Gibson.
Good morning you you caught me
unawares
thank you Mr chairman committee
members my name is Paul Gibson
co founder retake Our Democracy
an all volunteer organization
with twenty five hundred members
statewide.
The checker democracy opposes
this tax giveaway to
corporations as that as the
sector that has enjoyed
bipartisan tax cuts over years
costing the state hundreds of
millions of dollars and
manufactures one of the primary
beneficiaries this bill would
not only cost the state some
eighty two million dollars but
it would also cost studies in
counties eighty one million
dollars in local revenues
something they simply cannot
afford I've sent so many
hearings on wide range of bills
designed to help distressed
communities and suffering
essential workers over and over
again we hear from industry
utilities big business in the
chamber of commerce and in every
instance they cry for how these
bills if they were passed with
the the sky would fall on their
corporate interests all there is
no question that the business
sectors with harm by COVID
recession this is not the way to
address those farms SP three is
just this morning I heard this
the other day I heard
Representative Harper Ramon the
investment of our in SP three it
now this proposing a giveaway
that would cost the state over a
hundred and sixty million
dollars are we take our
democracy they strongly
encourages the committee to
reject this giveaway thank you
very much.
Hi my mute thank you very much
I'm gonna remind to please
refrain from
of
you know be posing as a motive I
I think this is you know let's
keep it to the bill I would
appreciate that Carl Kaiser.
Am I on.
Yes.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
committee my name's Carl Kaiser
a long time Albuquerque resident
and I strongly oppose H. B. two
seventy eight of the bill would
reduce state revenue by at least
eighty million dollars annually
and reduce local government you
signing by an equal amount of
this extremely costly bill would
create a huge role in government
revenue this revenue pays for
schools health care and public
safety Furthermore it is poor
fiscal policy to reduce state
revenue in a pandemic induced
economic crisis when individual
family needs are great
additionally the bill assumes
increased business
competitiveness or expansion to
justify the loss of state
revenue and only later test this
assumption I saw no call back
regions nor sunset clause sound
tax policy cannot rest upon
assumptions.
The easy way to reduce G. R. T.
is to resend the on what I'm
wise tax cuts of two thousand
and three and two thousand
thirteen and re ballots.
For all these reasons the
deduction of services for New
Mexico G. R. T. is a misplaced
idea.
I urge the committee to vote no
on H. B. two seventy eight thank
you.
Thank you Jim Davis.
You're on thank you Mr chair
this is Tim Davis with the New
Mexico Center on Law and Poverty
we need stable sources of
revenue that would generate
funds needed to invest in vital
services such as health
education public safety and
public infrastructure this bill
will provide companies with
unnecessary tax break after they
already received a huge tax cut
in twenty thirteen and cost our
state counties and cities
hundreds of millions that are
needed to support the vital
services I just mentioned for
these reasons the center opposes
this bill thank you Mr chair.
Thank you page nineteen welcome.
Hi good morning Mr chairman
members of the committee my name
is Paige knight and I am here
representing New Mexico voices
for children we understand the
Sanchez intent with this
legislation but we do stand in
strong opposition to house bill
two seventy eight aside from the
enormous cost of the bill to
state government it also takes
tens of millions from local
governments which cannot afford
more lost revenue this
legislation also runs counter to
everything the legislation
legislature has in to do in the
last half dozen years which is
to broaden the base and lower
the rate this is certainly among
the biggest year to tax breaks
ever considered in an
illustrious forgetting something
it is the largest since the food
tax break almost twenty years
ago but this we do more damage
to both the state and local
governments and the food tax
break because at least that
break was paid for and local
governments for hold harmless at
the time.
Since this bill does not propose
a way to pay for this cut it
would be paid for with money
from education health care
public safety and infrastructure
so for these reasons and the
reasons mentioned by the other
folks in opposition we strongly
urge you to reject this
legislation thank you very much.
Thank you very much next we have
the car let crew crew paid for
apologize in advance if I miss
pronounce your name Carla Kerr
had for.
Thank you Mr chair it's totally
fine it's a crew for Kurla crew
have for with the center for
civic policy and Mr chair
members of the committee we sent
in opposition of the legislation
we believe as other have
mentioned that this has an
enormous cost in it comes at the
expense of important programs
that will help our family
survive
it's not only to costly but it
also goes against our believe
that we should the state should
diversify sources of revenue in
with that I think the committee
and urge a do not pass thank
you.
Thank you for being here Michael
Sperber McQueen.
Welcome.
Good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee my name is
Michael for queen I'm a
volunteer with we take our
democracy.
We respectfully oppose this
bill.
Perhaps I have just spent too
many hearings.
Listening to Representative
Harper expound eloquently and
clearly as is his habit on the
problems that are caused when
the tax code has too many
exceptions exclusions deductions
special cases and ad hoc
provisions.
The other day he compare G. R.
T. to a block of Swiss cheese.
If that is a problem it is not
clear to me why drilling another
two inch hole through the block
is going to improve matters
thank you very much.
Thank you for being here.
And last but certainly not least
right here.
Welcome
Good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee my name is Kirk
record on the director of return
advocacy ministry of New Mexico
and for the reasons stated by
previous speakers in opposition
we to oppose strongly oppose H.
B. two seventy eight in urging
members of this committee to do
so as well thank you.
Thank you Kurt and I was looking
at the timer and had you gone
another twenty seconds I was
gonna tell you to keep going
because we didn't start right on
time so hopefully hopefully if
he could come instructors.
Mayo party arguments thank you
all right welcome thank you
thank you all right I believe
that is all public comment we
have still on it's going to
committee members and let me
switch my screen so I can
actually see your hands go up
when you raise your hands.
I'm gonna give you guys a minute
to put your hands up.
All right first on the nation
representative Larry Scott.
Thank you Mr chairman
Representative Harper I have
heard.
Please check your conversations.
From multiple sessions now how.
Understood the very large.
Chair
New Mexico's population lives in
poverty all of the.
Hi folks spoke in opposition.
Representative some form or
another.
People.
The.
Mechanism.
That we could put together to
pull these people out of poverty
would be jobs.
Created by.
Small and large businesses could
you describe sure how our
current.
G. R. T..
A tax system in order.
The formation and development.
These jobs.
Thank you chairman and reserve
stock for the question hi.
I agree with you I think there's
it's clear.
That when you look at
you know employers and job
creation in the state.
That our our tax code has some
good things going for it and has
some bad things going for it.
and and if we're able to address
some of the bad things leverage
some of the good things and
Russell about things.
that would.
That would definitely help
these employers help people
you don't want to go take a
risk.
perhaps those businesses that
are successful would be less
likely to move out of the state.
and and I agree with you I one
of the reasons I really been
passion about tax reforms I
believe that.
Our families have good a high
paying jobs.
not have to worry about you know
no two jobs just to get food on
the table
send that addresses a whole at
the whole issue our whole whole
spectrum social issues to your
parents were able to help their
kids with their homework to to
be home and and spent time with
their kids that's a huge
You know having dinner together
as a families eugenic cater on
how how children turn out.
The the other thing I'll mention
I just I find a ironic.
you know House Bill for twelve
was designed to be revenue
neutral.
there were taxes being raised in
that bill.
as we were lowering taxes as
well.
and it just so happens that over
the years we've passed most of
the tax revenue portions are
generous portions of that bill.
So I think it's just a little
interesting that
But folks you're saying we're
punching another hole in the
Swiss cheese when when actually
we've filled many many holes and
increase the block of cheese
over the last years passing
different opponents of house
bill four twelve the.
Chairman representative.
Representative Harper is here.
When house bill for twelve.
Was first introduced in our.
Considered one of the most
thoughtful pieces of
legislation.
That I've seen in a long time
and.
Now let me turn come back if I
can't to small business.
All these are the folks that
have been significantly.
Acted by the COVID pandemic.
I believe it's true and would
you confirm if you would these
reforms that we're discussing
this bill or particularly
targeted towards small
businesses that have to pay for
these services that larger
corporations may be able to
furnish.
House at.
Eight percent discount if you
will could you describe how
small businesses are most
favorably impacted with this.
Legislation.
Chairman representative thank
you for for the question and and
really look at the two parts
this bill the first is the
manufacturing equipment at
auction and I spoke a little bit
to this earlier your large
businesses
They they will contract with a
lawyer and work with the local
government to get an I. R. B. so
they rarely will pay a gross
receipts tax on on their
equipment.
it's your it's your small
Montauk's your hundred and sixty
thousand small businesses in the
state that no employee
you know the majority of New
Mexicans are the backbone of our
economy that don't have a voice
up your and really in Santa Fe
don't don't hire lobbyists
and don't get special carve outs
that would really benefit from
that manufacturer could
adoption.
The second part of the bill
dealing with the business to
business professional services.
Again you're you're reading the
large size businesses they can
afford to have on staff payroll
H. R. legal you know they I'm
they don't pay the gross
receipts tax for those services
because I can bring it in house
it's your smaller.
your business is not ten people
are lasts that will really see a
big benefit
from this this change so that.
The changes that we're talking
about here
really
to target the the small
business.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Thank you Representative for
your answers very thorough
answers and that concludes my
line of questioning.
Thank you Representative Scott
was good Representative
Strickler.
Thank you Mr chairman and and
thank you Representative Harper.
you know I've had the privilege
of serving on this committee for
a long time and and G. R. T.
reformists is always been in the
forefront
and the and it comes to mind
share bill shares two percent
plant mainly there so many holes
in the Swiss cheese you said
well just to why with all the
exemptions deductions.
Hi credits and then we'll just
let it just charge a flat two
percent and a and that that has
problems to
but it was you know was a good
idea and and ensure got the
discussion going can you
explain.
How how different we are.
Compared to other states
especially our neighboring
states you know we're not an
island we have to compete with
Texas Oklahoma Colorado Utah
Arizona and and just just give
give us a little tutorial on how
different we are I think the
only other state that
that has a a G. R. T. much like
ours is Hawaii and they are an
island they have no you don't
have no competition if you will
and their rights around around
four percent so
I think the public needs to
understand that you know we were
just out of at the we're now
are.
Can you can you go over there
that's yeah.
Yeah chairman and Representative
Strickler thank you for the
question and.
You know I'm I'll keep this
really really short I could go
on for quite a bit here no
external time to time studying
this.
When you look at.
Our tax code as a whole right
I've talked about not looking at
anything in isolation.
We look at our tax code as a
whole.
we have some some good parts in
some parts right so like our
property tax is the lowest or
second lowest in the nation.
if I could be raised to be kind
of more the the mid point right.
our gasoline tax were probably
about five or six cents lower
than the average of our
neighbors you could probably go
up a little bit and dedicate
that to roads to care robots
right.
Those are kind of our low and
taxes we look at taxes there in
the middle our our income tax
for a long time was the exact
average it's bumping up a little
bit now we're starting to get on
the out liar side so that that
could be an issue.
alright if if you're just a
consumer the gross receipts tax
you see as a sales tax it's it's
about the average of all of the
our neighboring states that
that's fine.
What we're really just really
stand out where we have
bad ratings by the different
ballparks and Tax groups and
really where we heard our our
economy is the pair omitting
aspect of our gross receipts
tax.
That turnover of the gross
receipts tax through the
commerce Ching is really what.
Is that the black eyed.
Our tax code and and this is a
no it's not it's not a partisan
issue we need to talk to folks I
mean even even I tapped the left
leaning tax think tank says that
to our the the permitting is a
is an issue.
in our state
so that
chairman would be that the quick
answer to a your your question
Representative.
Thank you Mr chairman and and
thank you Representative Harper
and you know I know a lot of
small businesses and and San
Juan county in our gross
receipts taxes yes risen to
eight point three seven five
percent and we're higher now
than they and Durango in
southwest Colorado yeah we're
big retail trade area you know
we have to you know way of
Lowe's and home depot and target
Sampson and you know and any
other you know the other areas
don't have those facilities so
we bring in a lot of commerce
there
but all is for the small
business owner.
If they have to contract their
all their services for example
bookkeeper.
you know administrator you know
what contracted administrative a
CPA in any engineering services
the architectural services I. T.
services and I'm sure I'm
missing out some they have to
pay that eight point three seven
five percent.
On all those services and and
that you know it hurts.
And and you mentioned earlier
that
you know what is the composite.
A negative impact on on those
businesses did you say sixteen
percent so you could use that
average that that those small
businesses faster next year
sixteen percent in a more they
may or may not be able to pass
those costs of those costs to
their customers and that's.
This kind of what's what's
hurting us and can you elaborate
on that just a little bit.
Speaker I mean Mr chairman and
gentleman.
Yes Representative Strickler
yeah can just very briefly.
because of that turn over.
The tax to the commerce chain.
The the cost.
To develop the product.
is higher than it would be if
you were in a neighboring state
you don't have that turnover tax
just your your cost for permit
producing that product go up.
And yeah of course it depends
what sector the economy here and
right so for example we don't
what comes agriculture there is
No real terminating in that
field chair New Mexico we've
taken that out
it also made some progress on
construction now the last dozen
years or so we've taken
construction permitting out of
construction.
but other sectors the economy
you know the Richard included
the calculation this is probably
a you know several years old now
but you could go up seventeen
sixteen seventy percent is your
effective tax rate
depending on where you're at and
I just makes it you know what
people are like how come
this product you know how come
up with a business ask your
employer ask themselves how come
it in a different state they can
sell this product for less than
I can I'm I'm just barely making
it and and the the answer is
because of those are rolled up
curving costs.
Thank you thank you Mr chairman
and and gentleman you know in
our rankings in our national
rankings you know force economic
you know opportunity and you
know the the the fifteen or so
categories that comparecer
surrounding state were like
thirty fifth and fortieth and
in business you know is our main
business friendly which is not
good because our our surrounding
states thank you to all those
ranks number one almost every
year
you know Colorado's in the top
ten Arizona is a top ten.
I think Texas and and Oklahoma
or the top fifteen and yeah
we're thirty fifth or forty is
so this this would help us a
little bit to be more
competitive also our surrounding
states have grown dramatically
in terms of population.
The ten percent growth and we're
at you know we're in a make one
point four percent growth and it
would like that would be like to
grow I mean it it it's good you
know when eight people and when
a students and you know when a
business so.
With this help kind of maybe
reverse a little bit.
Mr chairman and gentleman.
Chairman and Representative yeah
I would like for there to be
more gross New Mexico besides my
family of four.
yeah yeah.
Going to be shoulder that the
gross effort of the state here
but.
Yeah it's so.
It's hard to say I mean we can
talk about dynamic scoring of of
tax relief bills.
I do believe that there is a
positive impact and that's our
B. growths in business but that
is so hard to quantify and and
so a lot of so I'm you know when
Representative came and I got
together to start working on
this we need a policy that we're
gonna do static scoring that we
were going to here's a look at
the plus and minuses as of
today.
And and if we had business
growth that's right we get more
than we expect.
Just because it's so hard to
calculate but I I do believe we
would see improvements in our
economy and.
But what what what a great help
that would be to New Mexico
families.
Thank you Mr chairman this is
good my last comment gentleman
from
Santa you know my wife and I
have seven kids their their
energy educated and for
Farmington public schools for
more to New Mexico military
institute to one graduated from
UNM one graduate from Mexico
stated I got excellent
education here but unfortunately
all of our gone except for one.
And I left for the opportunities
to to expand here so I get some
more my grandkids here they're
all out of state so.
Anyway thank you Mr chairman it
thank you gentlemen and.
Appreciate all your hard work on
this.
Thank you.
Thank you Representative
Strickler speaker brining up.
Thank you Mr chairman in the
morning.
I just have one area of question
at.
Representative Harper and that
is.
You know I I know you're aware
that for certain.
manufacturers in New Mexico they
have.
The ability to access what I
think you referred to as a bit
of a double dip.
With regard to.
The ability not to pay
compensating tax for
manufacturing equipment to
commend position out of state
and they also have other tax
incentives that Graeser double
benefit effect Mr Chairman
representative harbored are you
familiar with what I'm what I'm
talking about.
Chairman Mr speaker yes that
that's exactly right
And and what.
How that works in New Mexico.
Is there are
to.
statutes that are these folks
can leverage the first is
industrial revenue bond.
Which essentially is a way of.
Not paying taxes on equipment
and how that works is
you work with the a lawyer and
local governments and basically
have a contract that says the
local government will purchase
what will bond or whatever
purchase this equipment because
they're purchasing it it's not
taxable we don't tax those local
governments then they reset back
to you as you work on some
agreement together to make your
payment will tax or you might
pay directly to government
that's that's the first one is
the industrial revenue bond.
The second is what's called our
investment tax credit.
And this was renewed and
extended during the last session
with the investment tax credit
basically has some some
qualifications some thresholds
so you have to meet.
And if you do that you'll get
reimbursed by the state the cost
of the property tax or gross
receipts tax.
So when you put both of these
together
you don't pay the gross receipts
tax accomplishing taxes M. I. R.
B..
And then.
What's really investment tax
credit you get paid back seat
complicated tax receipts tax
that you didn't pay so so it's a
double that you actually end up
not paying the tax and then
getting the equivalent money of
the tax
to you.
Got it.
Does your bill what I should I
should say.
Also
the company in which my wife
has.
Ownership interest did pursue an
industrial revenue bond.
I don't know if you can believe
it anything that's what tax
credit that I I should say that
The is your bill.
The reason I'm aware actually of
the.
The double dip is the folks that
Albuquerque economic development
your time just was executive
director.
That
made me aware of this and and
said that they were particularly
interested in maintaining it is
it was a way for them to
incentivize businesses.
Whether to expand.
Your operations that already
existed in New Mexico where to
get companies to come here yes
one of the things that offsets
some of the other difficulties
caused by our tax structure.
so that's why I first learned
about this and and heard from
them about how they use it to
try to create economic
opportunities does your bill
touch on that.
you to come see tax or the R. B.
he's.
So so great question and the
correct the quick and direct
answer is no it does not.
last year.
During the.
A debate on extending investment
tax credit.
I argued that to this double dip
was not effective and that it's
not good tax policy and we
should have it and we actually
are at one point had an amended
bill that sun said that double
dip we want to make sure that
promises made promises kept.
to those who are already in.
but.
You know we did look at removing
that double that and that yeah I
carried on just my friends at
eighty we're not we're not happy
with me but you know I.
But does the the right tax
policy what this bill does not
touch I abuse it does not touch
that's the tax credit all it
does is provide manufacture
equipment adoption which will
make it so that
The vast majority of Iraqis will
no longer be necessary.
Understood okay thank you for.
Your answers I appreciate thank
chairman.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr chairman and the
Representative Harper
hi I've been a little distracted
with something else going on
here so I hope I'm not being
redundant with this question but
Representative Harper the.
If you look around the the the.
State map and look at all of the
border towns in New Mexico that
how a sister town across the
border or a.
What we might.
Referred to as a as a trade
partner maybe
The services portion of of pure
omitting it is I think more
harmful in those border towns.
I don't know what kind of
economic development is is being
harmed but I know if you're in
Farmington you can get
professional services across the
border not have to pay for
paying.
In New Mexico for for any of
those services so so Cortez
Durango
gross for if you live in a house
to go springs just a hop skip
and a jump away
but you know if you're to
compare you can go or Amarillo
Clovis and Portales you go to
Lubbock in Hobbs you got
middling of just a few and
Los crucis.
Obviously account houses less
than fifty miles away same thing
for in Deming.
in Tucson it is just a short
little drive.
I think this is where we're not
capturing.
the cost.
I don't know if you talked about
that much but could you ex
expand on that I mean we're
talking about.
The static scoring and all we
can look at is what is.
You would think maybe we can
catch with static scoring what
we're losing I mean if there
would be some way to find out
how many of these border towns
are are are purchasing those
Professional services in another
state and held and that's my
only question so I'm gonna
me myself and just was your
answer thank you Mr.
chairman and and Representative
thank you for for that question
it it speaks to the other side
of the coin which which we
haven't really talked about
yourself and what you do briefly
brought this up and obviously
answer we've talked about how
this would help small
businesses.
When it comes to having to pay
the the gross receipts penalty
reckoning small business.
But
we have to talk about how these
professional services you know
accounts you know engineers
lawyers and such in New Mexico
are then.
their service here at a
disadvantage
as you can go outside of the
state perhaps not the the the
gross receipts tax
so I.
I'm not.
I'm not sure how big of an
aspect that is
but I I know that our employers
right now are hurting and if
they can save you know some
thousands of dollars by using.
A firm outside of the state for
work as opposed inside I can
only imagine that there are very
seriously considering that and
that hurts those firms that
exist here in New Mexico.
so.
Yeah I I I agree and thank you
for that that question.
Some of the.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Okay thank you thank you members
I I don't I don't have I don't
questions and got a couple of
comments.
I do wanna Eckel the good work
that's happened since I've been
here this is now my I think six
or seven you're here
and I've followed initially what
will mostly as an observer.
As a representative mccamley and
Anderson Harper they're they're
saying and then more recently as
a as a participant you know and
a partner with you all.
being no working on the tax code
to ensure that it's more fair
more equitable
that it truly incentivizes
succumbing Development.
you know versus.
What it what we know versus what
it it had been up to a few years
ago which was you know credits
deductions and exemptions were
given out like candy
and it is our generation that is
now tasked with fixing it.
I do want to point out and
because no surprise to you
percent Harper there's a.
A pretty major fiscal impact to
this and so will will be will be
doing a gentle tabling motion.
Today and and
Just for kicks maybe you should
do the table that might be a
first for I'd be happy to.
But the you know I I as I said
at the beginning of our meeting
you know this is sort of the
second half of the session I
think a lot of us are getting a
little antsy a little bit
frustrated that's natural that's
normal I think can be
circumstances where we're
sitting and staring at a screen
for sixteen hours a day it's
probably worse
I'm very proud of this committee
I'm very proud of the fact that
we held it together and and you
know understanding that their
political differences in policy
differences we've capped our
arguments to the point and and
we kept each other on task and
treat each of the respect I do
want to extend that same
call if you will to to our
public commenters you know not
only today but in future
meetings.
You know some things were said
in public comment that I don't
believe are are accurate and I
want to correct the record hi I
spent twelve years of my career
on the other side of of the of
the of the diets if you will is
an advocate and I've seen
corporate tax giveaways be given
out I see no my I sat watching
the webcast with a lot of New
Mexicans several years ago
screaming at the screen when you
know when a big corporate tax
giveaway in my opinion that's
you know that's how I saw it
be given out.
and you know it's it's a give or
take right what is a corporate
giveaway for some for other
states economic development tool
and you know most recently the
the the the field tax subsidy
you know I mean I think a lot of
folks on your side of the aisle
Representative would probably
see it as a giveaway a lot of
folks on my side C. is economic
development tool I
Representative downtown
Albuquerque for us it's been
great at any given time you go
downtown and they're filming
something that is good for our
businesses that's good for our
community here but you know it's
it's in the eye of the beholder
anyways right so
I I wanna make sure that we re
center ourselves this bill I
don't see it as a corporate
giveaway I see it as an attempt
to address some of these
inequities that are in the
system and whether or not you
should be done this way is
another story right and I think
they'll be plenty of time to
debate but this is not a massive
corporate give away that you
know.
You cooked up behind seems.
Are you know to to to favor some
corporation are some industries
it just isn't
it's it's the it's a god is
truth from my perspective and
then I will also say that this
is hard work this is very
difficult work I was there for
for twelve I was there for the
line of this coming in everybody
from corporate interest to
nonprofits came out and said
well we don't tax me to put me
at this point.
So.
You know I think that
alternately
We will continue to do this work
and I believe that you know why
I know we had differences on
house bill six two years ago
chairman three years bill but
that was one of those that
really close the loophole that
internet is Jr TE is huge and it
is huge now now that it's legal
but the specially now that once
we people are transacting online
I mean it's it's it's such a
godsend that we're able to do
that when we did it and that's
actually after it was vetoed by
the previous governor a couple
years before that so.
You know as we continue on this
quest this is one piece gross
receipts taxes are one piece
I've got a bill in the docket Is
gonna come up in front is
committee zoom and I'm sure I'll
hear plenty from from the Santo
island that one out but that was
looking at the personal income
tax rates right and and going
back to that conversation of of
of whether or not.
Those need to be
readjusted so I just want to
thank you for work I know it's
not easy I know it comes from
every side and you know that's
why us why constituents in this
hearing to to do the hard work
and you know it almost feels
like as long as everybody's a
little bit I'm happy with you
you're probably doing a good job
so
with that Representative Harper
promotion.
Thank you chairman create your
your words and that the greatly
run this committee.
I would move that we we should
fully in order fully table our
house bill two seventy eight.
Is there a job positions in
motion.
I see none
you name please show
all of us present on the zoom
call as having voted in the
affirmative and who will
continue these discussions are
so Harper and and see you know
see what what can be done in the
next few weeks.
Thank you appreciate thank you
committee.
Thank you Sir
folks I'm gonna I'm gonna remove
myself from this meeting and go
to the Dyess
A long Representative role metal
and I'm gonna hand the gavel to
foster Chandler.
For house bill twelve okay so
good morning everybody and the
chair has virtually native
himself off the diets and is now
in the panelists chair
We are now on house bill twelve
and I understand that there is a
tax committee substitute and
perhaps we might want to
moves to discuss that substitute
is that appropriate chair.
vice chair Chandler that that is
appropriate
and.
If I can move.
house taxation and revenue
committee substitute for House
health and Human Services
Committee substitute for house
bill twelve.
And I will read the number on
the bottom so that you all.
I know which one you're looking
at the number on the bottom is.
Two two zero zero seven zero
point five.
the substitute was in our
committee
Yesterday yesterday morning and
all the analyst.
Should have received it along
with
sheet sheets that we had
prepared to to help support it's
a big bill so we we our team has
put together a set of documents
for all the analysts that every
Canadian stop to be able to.
They just the.
Yes sorry my kid just.
Threw a ball at we.
Clearly not a fan of this bill
Yes.
So you all should have so would
move the substitute for for
discussion purposes.
second.
The house committee substitute
Tax house committee substitute
is now going to be discussed and
please explain the substitute
chairman yes ma'am thank you
madam chair and and before I
dive into some of I I do want to
welcome Michael sponsored seven
that'll metal
this bill is cosponsored by few
other folks they're not here
today Representative Armstrong
and Representative were tests
and probably a few others at
this point we also have miss
Emily Kaltenbach from the drug
policy alliance
Who is an expert witness for us
and I will allow her in since I
have those privileges.
She may be having me into it so
I could just move on explained
the the bill up members in front
of years house bill twelve
committee substitute house bill
twelve regulates the use
production and sale of cannabis
and cannabis products in the
state of New Mexico.
This act creates a responsible
tightly regulated system all
approved licensees with a strict
strict set of rules and
regulations developed by the
state regulation licensing
department members fourteen
other states have already
legalized adult use of cannabis
most recently the state of
Arizona they needed a ballot
initiative in November and
within six weeks they were off
and running.
however only two other states
have legalized three legislative
process and and that's an
important thing to note because
often times what happens with
these ballot initiatives is you
get a blanket legalization
framework and then state
governments have to scramble to
come up with the rules.
New Mexico can become third
state to legalize through
legislative process which in our
opinion is a lot more thought
for a lot more diligent a lot
more nuanced hence why this bill
has been written and re written
over the last five years
Representative McAnally who you
heard earlier was very busy with
tax reform he was also very busy
with adult use cannabis
legalization he was a busy guy
during his time in the
legislature so I inherited this
work from him all those years
ago.
This bill has gone through a
number of different process sees
a version of this bill passed
the state house in twenty
nineteen it passed the Senate
committee in twenty nineteen and
then it died in its final stop
in the in the last hours the
twenty nineteen session.
this bill has also been the
subject of debate and.
The writing if you will through
governor Michelle Lujan
Grisham's cannabis legalization
working group I to group of
experts in public health
industry law enforcement
health care and other
disciplines that came together
in twenty in the introductory
nineteen.
To rework the bill
this is the product of that bill
in this is a product of further
conversations with even more
stakeholders.
This bill has three foundational
principles and you hear about
these today and you know
depending on the will of this
committee should is going of
lawyer you'll hear about this on
the floor first and foremost we
can protect and getting has our
medical cannabis program that
program has been a godsend for
communities and families across
the state particularly those
suffering from
Tronic illness chronic pain PTSD
this has been a godsend for many
of our men and women who are
coming back for more and who you
know through no fault of their
own are suffering from mental
health illnesses this is this
has been you very important tool
for them so whatever
legalization framework
Representative has got to
protect that system and it has
got to protect the supply of
cannabis that is available for
those patients.
two we've got ensure that
whatever legalization framework
we lead with is
Is is is rooted in values of
equity investments the the the
warring drug set for government
has waged for over sixty years
has its roots in very
reprehensible and terrible
racist views there's a fantastic
book but I invite all your all
of your reading it's
it's it's titled
Gosh hearing the scream and it's
about your recovering addict you
journalists you British
journalist who dives into.
They issued a warrant drugs it
is it is a phenomenal phenomenal
history and invite you all to
read it because it explains so
much about the current system
cannabis offenses have been
particularly
punished committees of color and
so this bill what it does is it
ensures that those communities
are able to participate in is
now legal industry and that
they're able to also start their
own businesses and and and
thrive economically in a way
that is targeted in in a way
that is fair
that the third foundational
principle of this bill and the
reason is bill is in this
committee is we have to make
sure that we have a smart.
Regulatory and tax framework as
we get this industry off the
ground.
this is probably the piece that
are most proud of maybe because
I'm becoming a tax nerd as well
as many of you and so you know
that's the piece that we've sort
of worked and reworked in fact
most of the changes in the
substitute deal with that piece
after meetings with
representatives from TRD and and
other attacks experts
does the foundational principles
are key and is what sets our
bill part on a national scale
okay.
So with that let me walk us
through the changes to the
supplement has on to Michael
sponsor for some introductory
remarks and then we'll be right
for questions
our analysts should all have the
cheat sheet that explains the
changes from the previous
substitutes for this one
a lot of is a lot of it is
cleaner a lot of the stuff that
counts service didn't catch the
person around and they have to
address I want to highlight six
places that I think are more
substantive and that I want to I
want to
Kick off the discussion with
first and foremost he was racing
the previous committee that are
built.
imposed fines and fees for
minors that were.
The violation of the act
at the request of members of the
previous committee and at the.
You know and and given the fact
that this country in our state
is slowly but surely moving away
from civil fines for minors who
break the law mostly because it
really hits people in lowincome
communities harder oftentimes
those kids can't pay the fine to
goes to the parents and the
parents can't pay the finance
and it's a snowball effect so we
removed
those fines and fees and created
instead civil infractions so
this means that a kid who is
caught violating any piece of
this act you know would be
subject to disciplinary action
and some continuing education
some sort of process that is
restorative and that is not the
punishment that's one change
another change that we made was
to section thirty eight of the
bill which clarifies language
for employer protection we added
the word impairment to to
possession or use of
intoxicating substances that
work to make it clear that if
you're impaired your employer
can take action against you and
that was at the request of you
know economic development groups
were rightfully concerned about
being able to.
to take that action should an
employee show up.
Work.
sessions for four forty five
also very important
conversations with with many
stakeholders we decided to
remove the year marks that were
in this bill
this bill creates to specific
funds in the state treasury one
of them is a community
reinvestment fund
that would.
Send tax
revenues from cannabis to.
communities most impacted by the
war on drugs is gonna be
communities some of the frontier
communities that some of the oil
speaking about earlier
communities in native American.
communities colonia us down
south you know in Albuquerque
would probably a committee like
the south valley for example
communities most impacted by the
war on drugs would be able to
tap into a small part of funding
but they would be able to use
for things like drug education
for things like economic
development or whatnot
we removed the earmarks because
there's no money to distribute
yet right this isn't going to
effect for a while so it seemed
a little bit you know putting
the the the the the cart before
the horse to be earmarking money
that we don't have but we keep
these funds in place so that
when revenues to come in the
appropriating committees of the
legislature can then fund those
specific funds through these
revenue sources.
Section forty nine
we moved back the date when
cells could begin in two in the
original bill sales could begin
October one twenty twenty one.
For current medical license
holders and for newly licensed
micro businesses those two
entities would have a head start
in adult use sales October one
and then January one you would
have
New.
Sort of normal.
Large scale.
Licensees.
At the request of TRD to give
them more time to get ready we
actually push that back so.
Current medical cannabis
licensees as well as newly
licensed micro businesses will
now be able to begin sales on
January one.
Twenty twenty two and I know
that she she says twenty twenty
one but that's clearly not the
case twenty twenty two and then
nine months later in September
is when all other new licenses
would be able to begin
to sell under this program.
Section fifty two three fifty
four we would just of the state
excise tax from nine percent to
eight percent and we adjusted
the local option tax to a flat
rate of four percent no
increments again at the request
of TRD increments can get really
tricky for them to to administer
and so we decided to a flat four
percent.
For County immunity and the way
it's set up is if you purchase
the product you know in the City
of Albuquerque state of
Albuquerque taxes apply if you
purchase it in the
unincorporated area or really
county would be the best in the
would be the county tax it is my
understanding that counties have
cable using place often times
for some of these local option
taxes to help share the revenue
we're gonna give that up to them
but it's C. flat four percent
local option excise tax.
And then sections we to put that
three fifty four again.
We had an exemption for.
you know for those transactions
that happen between state of a
grower any manufacture to avoid
the issue of current meeting
TRD explain to me to us that in
fact there's already the
deduction in place for
sale so for resale under a
specific section of the code so
what that allows us to do is
those industries that those
licensees that sell for resale
will still account for the tax
and will still reported but then
they'll be able to deduct it
you know at the end at the end
of the process of the end of the
year.
those are what I would consider
the most substantive changes to
the bill obviously the cure may
very happy to.
Answer any questions but that
this one of my president Michael
sponsor for some remarks and
then we'll open it up for you in
a thank you very much.
Thank you Mr chair I thank you
members of the committee I just
wanted to before we get into the
technical sort of taxation
components I did want to just
amplify some of why I think this
is so critical for the state in
twenty twenty one and as we move
forward as a state so just to
key in on some of chairman
Martinez's comments thirty five
states have already legalized
medical cannabis were in that
pool in fifteen states have
legalized recreational cannabis
so we're still at the ground
floor nationally for being able
to tap into this opportunity as
a state of from a very
competitive standpoint in
competing in this market as we
begin it but of course the most
important component as to why
this is you know what is the
best way to do it is because of
how we're trying to reduce the
harm in our communities and
really soundly address the
social justice and access to
justice come components of this
what we're trying to of course
create a new a brand new
industry and for this committee
since we're so interested in the
numbers realistically what we've
seen from the New Mexico
economists the high end of of
new revenue within the state
because of this enterprise would
be around three hundred eighteen
million in the first year alone
creating eleven thousand new
jobs even at an eight percent
excise tax this is estimated to
generate twenty five million and
stabilizing at about fifty
million year by year so when we
look at some of the the new
revenues that we would be
projecting for the state this is
one of the ten new markets that
we're hoping to introduce to
diversify our economy chair
representative and again for it
for these for folks that are are
worried about where their
communities might stand polling
shows the legalization
Has broad community support
ninety four percent among
Democrats seventy three percent
among independents and fifty
four percent among Republicans
and so across communities we're
regardless of demographic on
their strong support for the
legalization of cannabis I'm so
with that I just wanted to offer
some of the data regarding how
we've done this of how we
approach this and why it's so
critical for the state now thank
you Mr chair thank you madam
chair and thank you
Representative.
Great thank you for those
excellent presentations I'd like
to go to the audience now or the
attendees and first just a
reminder we're gonna limit
public comment to one one half
minutes per person and also I'd
like to limit the total public
comment to thirty minutes and so
with that in mind I'm happy to
start a public comment those in
opposition first so if you have
your hand up and you're not in
opposition please take it down
and we'll get to you as soon as
we're done with the opponents to
this bill.
All right Carla Sonntag's.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee on Carlos
contact the president of the New
Mexico business coalition.
Our focus is to make New Mexico
a better place to do business.
So that New Mexicans can have
jobs and provide for their
families.
I want to say that we are not
opposed to marijuana use in fact
we supported decriminalization
of small amounts when it passed
a few years ago I also want to
say that I appreciate the
Sanchez dedication and hard work
to this issue and I know that he
has tried very hard to cover the
issues.
The problems that we see are
based on research that we've
done from other states that have
legalized the use of cannabis.
We sent that report to you it's
a four page report.
And while I fully understand
that this is probably going to
pass I just ask that you take
some time to review that
research there are numerous
sources that we used and it's
all documented there for you so
you can look at the problems
that we may encounter as we've
seen in other states cannabis
use in children twelve years and
older seventy six percent higher
in those states that have
legalized it and that's higher
than the national average
homelessness increases and
employee injury on the job for
those that are using not on the
job has increased significantly
please consider that reports
that you can further protect New
Mexicans thank you for your
consideration.
Thank you miss on tag Paul
Gibson speaking in opposition.
no I let me see any other hands
raised in opposition.
Mister Gibson are you in
opposition.
Mister Gibson.
Who we are Sen.
In various.
All right I'll go to the next
name we can come back to Mister
Gibson.
Your muted madam chair.
Yes yes could you please give
your name for the record yes
good morning madam vice chair
committee members my name is
floor Silva I'm a retired
teacher I taught in New Mexico
for thirty nine years I'm
opposed mainly because of the
health issues involved my
research is based on the
Cleveland Clinic studies there
are some serious memory
impairment issues that need to
be addressed you can't replace
brain cells secondly studies
have been done in Australia and
New Zealand which show that
adolescents who used money want
to regularly were significantly
less likely to finish high
school I've seen that in my own
field work doing business in for
thirty nine years in the schools
and in respect to page seventy
eight of the public school cold
providing substance education
for grades eight through twelve
that's a good start but I do
believe given the situation in
New Mexico you have to start
much earlier with appropriate
learning materials may be
starting a grades five or six
and I'm wondering if that's
going to be a funded or unfunded
mandate of the funds need to be
earmarked for that purpose.
Also in reference to drug free
school zones again because of
the issues relating to so many
drug problems in New Mexico this
needs to be more inclusive by
specifying exactly who you mean
or what you mean by school
phones there are a lot of bad
actors and predators so we need
to include day care centers
athletic fields facilities
playgrounds community recreation
centers a skateboard parks thank

Michael Spurr Representative
McQueen I'm a volunteer with
retake our democracy the
statewide citizen advocacy
network we strongly support this
bill we think prohibition has
worked about as well for
cannabis as it did for alcohol
that is to say it has been an
abject failure and it's time to
change course we like this bill
in comparison to the other
cannabis bills that have been
introduced during this session
for its emphasis on education
and its efforts to begin undoing
some of the damage that the war
on drugs has done to communities
and individuals in New Mexico
and also for its attention to
issues of cooperation with the
nations tribes and pueblos of
the state we have had some
concerns about of what looked
like editorial problems in
earlier versions of the bill but
I'm going to hope that those are
included in what the chairman
described as set cleanup of the
bill.
Thank you very much we hope that
you will move this bill.
Thank you so much Nicole Martin.
Some.
Yeah and then to.
and committee members my name is
Nicole more in I'm gonna include
command which is abundant in a
puddle I reside in finally of
the county
and I just want one I'm also of
leader was forward together
action I just wanted to offer my
support for this bill I
I was just I was a student in
college and in Colorado when
they passed their recreational
use
graduated from college I moved
back to New Mexico and I had
seen the benefits of
The Leising marijuana medically
and recreationally like have
helped community members in
Colorado and they built this
bill has an opportunity to do
the same for New Mexicans.
Yeah I hope people do more
research into the benefits of
using cannabis are using have.
It can bring of bunch of
opportunities
not only financially but for the
X. as well so I just want to ask
for your support and H. B.
twelve thank you.
Thank you miss Martin Jeffrey
Castillo.
Okay good morning madam chair
vice chair members of the
committee my name is Jeffrey to
seal a license general
contractor and licensed hemp
producer and then in an
independent enterprise in both
of our industry.
first off I would like to thanks
committee chair representative
Martinez for his team and his
team for their dedication and
hard work bringing forward this
bill for recommending are for
recreational.
Cannabis a very well thought out
and.
And included just about every
aspect pertaining legalize ation
and our rural state of New
Mexico New Mexico one concern I
do have this pertaining to.
As in this bill it rates
commercial license would have an
unlimited bank account and micro
businesses would only have
ninety nine I would like to see
level playing field for these
new businesses I feel that
players having unlimited
opportunity they will dominate
and thank on dictating the
market price this is what
happens as many industries
across the board in any
enterprise if we could up the
plant down to for Michael
businesses to say maybe four
hundred ninety nine that nine
ninety nine and limit the
commercial the state five
thousand.
my main agenda is building and
supporting micro businesses
throughout the state for success
I believe that this that it is
the micros Business This Is
gonna put more back into our
local local economies I also
believe that personal to see if
you could wrap up.
Yes I also believe that person
will the current cultivation is
a right that every citizen may
choose to have in these times a
semi recession we all facing
many can't afford to purchase
their medicine and should have
the right to grow their own very
respectfully thank you for your
time unless.
Thank you so much Paul Gibson.
Paul Gibson are you there.
R. right Mr Doug fine.
Thank you.
Madam chair system chair and
members of the committee my
name's Doug fine I am a rancher
in Grant County and I'm here to
speak strongly in support of H.
B. twelve thank you so much for
bringing this excellent cannabis
bill forward I've written four
books about cannabis hampers
meant journalist for a living
besides.
Ranching and this is a terrific
bill up for the reasons stated
by others already I want to
emphasize
my appreciation alongside
hundreds of others New Mexicans
thousands of others New Mexicans
for the personal cultivation
provision this is on nearly all
other legalization bills are
going to have to speak a human
right to cultivate for thousands
of New Mexicans this
legalization time is not about
going to a store it's about the
human right to grow cannabis
cultivation is deeply inculcated
in our culture here in New
Mexico Karen dollar tradition
etcetera etcetera and we're
greatly appreciative special in
this time of sequestration for
the provisions of home
cultivation in this bill I also
want to take a few seconds to
speak in support of the previous
speakers such as Jeffrey
Castillo and saying that I
support what the micro
businesses are offering people
based here in New Mexico
providing great quality cannabis
to their community if they're
asking for more plants I support
that but most of all thank you
hugely the legislature for home
cultivation thanks thank you Mr
fine could we speak with the
Chad Lauzon.
Chad are you there.
Okay Adrienne Barboa look I'm
sorry okay once I was a little
short thank you so know what
this sort of I spoke last time
on this bill money shovels on
I've been an advocate for seven
years in New Mexico medical
cannabis program I've held
several veterans and patients
throughout the state you know
and actually helped get laws
changed in the state for the
medical cannabis for the better
I feel each B. twelve is one of
the better bills when it comes
to the cannabis legalization
bills that have been put into
consideration so far I do love
the fact that we have home grows
I do also feel as other
judgments of said the other
gentleman said before.
Rowing is a right and should be
taken away from us we're trying
to legalize the cannabis plant
and not and not have a program
where we criminalize more people
just for doing that I can grow
tobacco I can brew beer wine in
my garage and no one has an
issue with that also a
population density is too small
we have seventeen people per
square mile Colorado has fifty
one in California has to order
fifty three people per square
mile we are just to rule to not
have to not have home grows also
I feel that the Michael licenses
are a little bit too expensive
for the number of plants that
you get for the price you guys
are charging they would they
would actually need more plans
to cover costs keep in mind that
most of these Michael licenses
are going to be in rural areas
and they're going to be in areas
that are less populated the most
places that are gonna have
regular once so if you guys
could keep that in mind that
would be great thank you so much
for your time.
Thank you for your time Adrienne
Barboa.
Hello I'm thank you chair and
members of the committee my name
is Adrienne Barboa and I'm
speaking today as as medical
card holder and someone that has
comes from a family of multi
generational family of medical
marijuana you very I agree with
so many of the statements that
have been fed very appreciative
to the sponsor this bill is
being felt R. O. and making this
probably the best
policy that for cannabis that we
would see in our whole country I
want to I'm super emphasized
that that part I'm local
businesses being able to get
priority and incentives in
license air and and I'm
distribution and growth we
thought with that first medical
the way the medical marijuana
that it was not a lot of local
providers who were given those
licenses if we are that economic
driver of this bill is the one
common denominator across our
across higher political will and
if we are truly looking at this
as an economic driver for our
state we have to prioritize
community of color licensure
rural communities getting
licenses and even getting the
support needed to be able to
start businesses at the local
level with and local people
thank you thank you very much Mr
mark Duran.
Hello madam chair members of the
committee I Representative make
these farmers registered
lobbyist Maggie's farm is a
unique company that exclusively
operates in Colorado finally
growing marijuana outside using
natural sunlight the only
harvest once a year there are
certified green grower which is
the equivalent to organic they
use ninety percent of flour in
their products and the Maggie's
farm team feels that the
cultivation climate in New
Mexico for growing marijuana as
one of the best in the country.
Madam chair mark Maggie's farm
is been involved in the
Colorado adult use program since
its inception
our and the company has also
been involved in New Mexico's
legislation for the last several
years strongly feels that
Representative Martina citizen
Representative Romero house bill
twelve is the most comprehensive
fair and inclusionary bill that
will put The New Mexico program
on the right success of from the
outset and that's important if
you Mexico's program is going to
work
and it won't have a second
chance at a good start it has to
begin with the best
comprehensive legislation
possible such as house bill
twelve we urge your support
thank you madam chair.
Thank you very much Mr Duran we
have two more speakers and then
we'll close public comment
Rikki Lee Chavis.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Ricky
Lee Travis speaking on behalf of
the New Mexico will defense
lawyers association we stand in
support of house bill twelve we
appreciate the Sanchez and their
advocates tireless work on this
provision on this measure we
especially appreciate the
provisions that address criminal
justice and affect criminal pop
I'm sorry positive criminal
justice reform we in our
organization often see the
effects of the war on crime what
it's done to our communities of
color and how ideas of
criminalizing cannabis use can
have negative effects on our
communities especially because
once one finds themselves in the
criminal justice system it is
really difficult to get out so
we appreciate the work that was
put into this bill on that
regard NMCDLA is also a member
organization of NMC and I'm safe
is an organization made up of
associations like ours that
seeks to review policy that
comes before the legislature and
great about policy based off of
the rubric about whether or not
this policy would make our
community safer we did give this
provision AD plus we will make
that report card available to
members of this committee and it
is in the queue to be published
on our website and in state dot
work thank you thank you very
much miss miss Chavez
we just McLaughlin.
Good morning madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Li in the left lane I'm from
McKinley County I am a leader
four together action I support
house bill twelve energy to
support house bill twelve thank
you for your time.
Right thank you very much for
those comments now we'll go back
to the committee.
C..
Alright so I see Representative
Harper's handout Representative
Harper.
Thank you madam chair when the.
Chairman representative
Thank you for bringing this to
us today and
I think we've.
Madam chairman we've you start
on the house floor several times
about this.
Legislation and
And the I believe each time
given the Victor and I've come
up and and the should your hand
graduated you
I.
I do have several.
Our server issues or concerns
socially about.
The impact of this legislation.
I'm not gonna focus on those
here are going to mostly focus
on the tax.
Cations one make sure you got
that right.
and and I do want to say I think
you this bill is a significant
improvement over prior bills
when it comes to the tax portion
so you and you and your team
should be commended for that.
I.
I I do believe that
You know.
Ten years from now.
we'll look back at.
In order.
Affects the Santa Fe New Mexico
and and I just really believe
deeply that we will all regret
doing this.
But maybe maybe I'll just share
one with critical stories and
I'm going to my tax questions
so I I haven't been to too many
and CSL meetings just with
family and work it's it's a
challenge but to I've been a
couple they were really good.
What what one meeting I happen
to spend some time with the
Colorado legislator.
And she was fascinating person
we had a great conversation.
and and I I can't remember what
political party she was so I'm
might even get a gas but.
But she did say that she was
hoping that we would legalize
marijuana so that her homeless
camps would all move to New
Mexico where it's warmer.
So just.
Something.
Something to think about.
Okay so Madam chairman.
looking through the committee so
I just wanna make sure I
understand the tax structure so
I'm gonna repeat back to you
what I've got.
Written down and make sure I
understand it right.
please jump in and interrupt me
if I got something wrong.
so Madam chairman looks like we
have a nine percent state level
excise tax we're creating on our
water.
Madam chair representative we've
actually brought that down to
eight percent okay with this
bill with some all right thank
you okay so eight percent state.
And then there was some
flexibility on the Union County
but what the order it's now four
percent muny.
Four percent County and that
it's a all or nothing right zero
four percent no increments in
between.
Correct.
And the I'm sure chairman the
county portion.
Is that county wide or just
County area
meaning.
Is that the four percent four
percent staff in the city or is
just four percent in the county
and then four percent missing.
Four percent in the county madam
chairman four percent in the
city.
Okay right so County county area
four percent okay.
and then of Madam chairman the
these transactions are also
still
OC's taxable.
That is correct madam chair and
representative all right so.
Madam chairman so we're looking
at really.
If my math is right here a
twenty percent.
Matt kind of total maximum
possible tax on these
transactions is that correct.
That is correct Madam chair
representative.
Not sure and chairman.
We've heard a lot of talk
from experts in the area I think
Joe bishop from the tax
foundation came and gave a
presentation to rest up on
the lessons learned.
from.
The legalization of marijuana
and one of the one of the topics
was.
in regards to how much you tax
it.
and so could you just maybe
speak to how you came to this
twenty percent Max.
Yes thanks for the question
Madam chair representative you
are correct we have the tax
foundation in the restive
meeting a couple of insurance to
go
and based on the research
sticking to that twenty percent
more less total tax on the
product is what was suggested by
them and and and for two reasons
number one you know that there
there are costs associated with
this new industry no doubt about
it you want to be able to
generate enough revenue to not
only cover the cost but also to
hopefully bring extra revenues
to the state but you also don't
want to make it so expensive
that you continue to feed the
less than market because
ultimately that's one of the
goals I think and and uniting
citizens beginning but.
For me on a personal level but
also you know sort of across the
across the board I'm it is
widely accepted that by
legalizing this particular
substance you're really under
cut you know the the bad guys at
the end of the day you know if
you're looking at.
Drug cartels south of the border
many of you know I'm I'm from a
mechanism to that what is we
we've lived is what drugs I mean
since I can remember we've been
you know I'm impacted by.
Over sixty percent of the drug
cartels drug cartels cash crop
is cannabis.
So you don't want to taxes so
high that you keep that market
alive you want to be able to hit
that sweet spot it and that's
twenty percent really I think
it's it is doable in talking to
folks in the industry twenty
percent is to avoid talking to
you know consumer type of groups
that right is doable that's not
to say that in future
legislatures we may not you know
once we increase that are lower
that I mean that some policy
decision for us later but that
twenty percent really is a sweet
spot and that's why we brought
down the rate to eight percent
from the nine percent because
you know the the as we're going
through the process it became
clear that you know we could
what we want to get more money
to the locals but not to do that
and still stick the twenty you
know you have to give somewhere
else so we reduce the state
increase the local and all for
the most part will be right at
about twenty incentives will be
a little over in some cases
it'll be a little under.
Madam chair chairman thank you
for that answer and and I'm I'm
pleased with your answer because
you're really able to both sides
of the coin and my recollection
from.
That's a presentation from tax
foundation was they were saying
roughly the twenty percent mark
was kind of sweet spot.
That they were recommending.
and.
And I.
You know whatever we set a tax
rate you really have to balance
those two things there's more
things developed really after
you're trying to balance okay
what's the revenue I can
generate from this to offset the
social ills are to pay for the
administration of the program.
versus taxing it so much that it
drives
in criminal behavior right.
And and we we have the same
conversation or comes to the
tobacco tax.
we know that we are a little bit
of an ally on the high end now
for our cigarette tax and when
we have those that come before
us to raise that we talk about
well.
Now you're gonna have people
selling cigarettes are back in
their trunk or you're going to
be driving sales to the tribes
and so you actually end up
losing money by raising the tax
rate.
so so I want to say I think
you've done a.
Good jobless following the
council of experts and learning
from other states that have gone
through this process slide
Yes good job there might last
question in this area is when it
does come to our tribal no
foreign governments was in the
state of New Mexico how how does
this.
Bill the fact.
That activity and that taxation.
That's a great question
Representative in in the in the
previous version of this bill we
actually
put in some language to allow
for tribal governments and state
in Mexico to enter into into
animal use into contracts you
know
The trouble and it's it's it's
very tricky as you know this
sovereign land there is this
sort of federal purview over it
that
in many cases I think creates a
great deal of conflict you know
hold number of areas so you know
the best we could do to our bill
was to allow the state to enter
into contracts with those tribal
governments for them to be able
to participate in this industry
in a way that you know is is
fair to both equitable to both
but that is also within the
bounds of any federal
prohibition that might exist on
those lands.
Madam chairman thank you for
that and and that that is an
interesting wrinkle writes that
You know they are sovereign but
they're still you know subject
to federal.
Regulations requirements
statutes and we all know that
the Feds haven't yet legalized.
So I can kind of see where
that's a that's a tough one
to work around.
Okay and then also I saw and but
Madam chairman if this change in
the committee so let me know but
of the total revenue that comes
in from the tennis program.
What's like three percent of
that can be used by the
department.
To administer the program is is
that correct is that still the
case.
madam chair percent of that is
correct.
Okay.
And and the and I'm asking you
to work with the secretary on on
that number and she's confident
that sufficient.
That is correct madam chair
representative.
Also.
Okay and then.
I believe I heard in in the
testimony are Madam chairman
that the total expected tax
revenue.
Is around.
thirty five forty million and
possibly going up to fifty
million is is that correct.
Madam chair representative
conservatively that is correct
we we've seen other numbers as
well that are much higher
conservatively that's that's
probably an accurate number.
One Madam chairman that.
My my understanding is really
that forty million dollar mark
of tax revenue is.
I mean you said it's
conservative I've heard that's
probably the the most we can get
on but I'm just glad to hear
that that's kind of a that's
what the number that we're all
looking at turns out to be more
that's so great
But but I'm glad to hear that
that's kind of number we're
looking at and I think that's
more realistic.
Excuse me our.
Do I guess the.
The other question I have.
And and again is this committee
looks at common ministration of
this program.
we're we're right.
I do have some concerns for for
employers boasts New Mexico
employers and federal employers
what how does this our.
Legislation addressed.
Making marijuana legal and then
addressing employers and
employees that relationship was
using marijuana.
That's the question Madam chair
representative you know that
doesn't change you know if you
if you're drug free workplace
that did not change in fact one
of the changes we made to the
sub
and I forget the exact section
but we added the word
impairments to provide more
protections for employer
employers it does not change of
federal employers federal
contractors there's absolutely
no change if they have a
prohibition today they'll have a
prohibition tomorrow on on their
employees or their
subcontractors or whatever using
any type of substance that they
you know.
Russophile federal law that does
not change and we've gone to
great lengths to ensure that the
language is such that it
provides some level of comfort
for some of the groups that in
the past have actually opposes
bill specifically based on that
issue.
Madam chairman thank you for
that I appreciate you taking
that concern
The you know it's hard as your
your work on this legislation
So I guess maybe a follow up
question to that building.
you know I I work at the labs
and we have random drug tests.
And I know that to the the
constituents the by products of
our.
Marijuana can be picked up in
the.
What are your and you know.
After one is not under the
influence
does this bill speak to that.
situation at all or or not.
Madam chair representative to
speak to that specifically but
you are correct and you know I I
have a you know my cousin who
you know is our neighbor you are
setting as well and you know he
tells me about you know the the
the random drug tests that you
all have to go through and so
you know that doesn't change the
you if if if they send the
employee
you know decides to
to to.
Partake in the consumption of
cannabis and they are drug
tested and if it shows up in
their system a week later
whatever it might be they're
gonna be disciplined the way
they would now that does not
change although the bill doesn't
speak specifically for that.
Chairman thank you for that.
Yes we have come up with this
press better testing message
that would not be to those
kind of false.
Positives that would be very
good but I do appreciate that.
This doesn't Wheatley's conflict
when it comes to you know.
Our our federal institutions and
also.
New Mexico employer I mean there
there are lots of employers
were.
Being impaired it is not just a
nuisance to getting work done
but it's also very dangerous to
wife of employee and other
employees working what's that
that individual so I I think it
is important that we continue.
To allow.
Those those employers to have
safeguards.
So my my last question chairman
Has to do with C..
Our local aspects.
What what is a committed for for
local governments
to do with regards to this
legislation could you could you
address what is in the the such
to before us in that regards.
Yes another great question thank
you madam chair representative
the bill in front of us allows
local governments to who
to use or zoning and land use
policies to ensure that these
activities are conducted in such
a way that the local government
allows them to.
Is versions we had opt out
mechanisms so if you know
Bernalillo county did not want
this industry to.
Exist in their county that they
would be able to do so but at
the request of law enforcement
Sorry madam chairman chairman
and you appear to be frozen.
Chairman chairman Martinez.
Hello.
Well until he gets back madam
chair I'll continue with what we
get and Madam chair
representative
so local control is throughout
this bill and essentially that
was one of the major things that
we wanted to include as far as
how of the the municipality or
county would designate where the
location of these businesses
would be how far who you know
would be able to
access the opportunity and we're
in their municipality and chair
representative but we were also
very cognizant of the fact as he
in hearing from many different
ways to is about ensuring that
there's no concentration in
traditionally
you know the.
Basically economically
challenged areas where typically
you might see a build up of of
what we call you know the the
sort of by businesses that we're
looking at we want to be
cognizant of of creating equity
in that process madam chair
representative and we have
chairman.
So well let him talk about all
the voices that has muted into
the room regarding that local
control the madam chair yes.
Still waiting for that magic
acetylated and better support
proceeds from simply so.
So I'm actually off my my phone
right now so hopefully that's a
little bit less unstable so yes
so so governments can can zone
the heck out of these industries
right as as provided by their
local regulations and whatnot
but at the request of law
enforcement we are not allowing
a total opt out because it just
becomes a nightmare for them.
I'm.
Thank you madam chairman and
chairman she did a great job of
covering your back we were
frozen chairman
and it looks like Representative
Jim I just this is needing to be
let in as a panelist.
So.
So I I understand
The idea that perhaps if we had
a patchwork of counties.
You know right allowing this and
some not that would be a
challenge.
Right to law enforcement so so
I'm I.
That's a fair argument to me I
get that.
But we saw earlier version of
this bill there were.
The limits as to what the local.
Government could do with regards
to zoning like state you know
the our call is like three
hundred feet or more from a
school was the the requirement
for zoning but this legislation
to prevent it a local mystery
from say creasing that to Cerner
fifty or four hundred is that
still the case.
you madam chair and
representative I'm gonna I'm
gonna have Emily address that I
don't I don't know if that's
still the case I I I believe
Lee it's not but Emily do you
wanna jump in while I go to that
section.
Thank you madam chair
representative happy to this is
actually in page forty five this
it does outline various
provisions that a local
jurisdiction shall not do and it
does in fact representative
madam chair mention that three
hundred foot limit it says a
local jurisdiction shall not
require licensed premises or
consumption area to be any more
than three hundred feet three
hundred feet in the reason that
the three hundred feet is in
there is that it's also
tracks with what's currently
under medical cannabis and so a
lot of those businesses are
already located and so the
concern was if a local
jurisdiction increased it to
three hundred fifty or four
hundred those existing
licensees would have to move and
that would be a burden on
business.
Okay madam chair the chairman
and and the.
Emily thank you for that and I
understand that rationale do we
know how many businesses are
medical cannabis businesses are
actually at three hundred feet
from a I'm interested I can't
imagine there's not any.
Madam chair representative I I
don't think there are many I
mean we I don't we we don't have
data to back that up to
disentangle the I've you know
usually these operations are in
commercial
well first of all they've got to
be in a commercially
a commercial zoning.
area right you can have it in a
residential area
I I would assume some schools
might you know maybe charter
schools might be in some of
these commercial areas some of
these us you know storefront
strip malls and so maybe that
would be a little bit within
those three hundred feet but I
can't imagine there being very
many as you know most most
schools are going to be in the
middle of a neighborhood which
restricts any type of for the
most part any type of commercial
activity.
Madam chairman thank you for
that and then if it's a it
should be alright madam chair I
just ask the family could help
go through that section just so
that we understand what are the
limitations on local government
that this bill does.
Ms Columbine.
Madam chair and representative I
would quickly go through one of
local jurisdiction cannot
prevent transportation of drugs
cannabis products through their
local jurisdiction and so that
was important because we there
is a career
license type they also may be
moving drugs from an
agricultural area at two a
retail shop and so in a state
like New Mexico we didn't want
to do that the second one is a
low local jurisdiction cannot
completely prohibit an operation
of the licensee and so those
license C. types are outlined in
the bill a local jurisdiction
cannot prohibit or limit signage
attached to a location
So signage is allowed but also
it in the bill it also talks
about how that has to be
specific zoning and time place
manner requirements but you
can't prohibit prohibit the
signage we talked about the
three hundred feet also.
They can't prohibit or require
an existing licensee at a
licensed premises to re locate
again back to that point about
the capital that many of these
small businesses and put into
their existing locations or
prohibit a person from producing
home grown cannabis which is
allowed under the act thank you
madam chair thank you
Representative.
Thank you madam chair and.
Mr chair and Mr boxing you for
that so.
So there are there are a good
number of limitations I think I
understand the rationale behind
most of them.
Now there are there are are a
good number of limitations on
local government.
Okay I think that is that is all
madam chair and.
Chairman representative thank
you for bring this forward I I
do still.
I believe the the tax portion is
is an improvement over prior
versions I think you're on the
right track there
You know I'm gonna vote no on
this but to I want to thank you
for the time and it's awful this
that and the many years of
effort that you put in this and
and listening to folks from
across the entire state from
industry in those protocols and
against really appreciate that
thank you madam chair thank you
very much Representative thank
you madam chair and and and
Representative we have a we have
a line available as a primary
sponsor if you change your mind.
Right there for the also in turn
is back.
It is back some of the log off
my phone and then okay my
internet is back at home so I'm
gonna log off my phone and turn
it over to make co sponsor and
then I'm gonna reconnect to my
home internet okay very good
chairman Representative Scott.
Thank you madam chair and
representative.
Looking at the financial
projections.
So.
The.
Stabilized gross sales
projections we're going to be
about six hundred and twenty
five million dollars a year is
that accurate.
Madam chair representative re
looking at the FIR specifically
because we have different
projections from many different
sources so I just want to be
accurate and my response to you.
I just took your eight percent
gross sales fifty million
dollars in gross that up to some
gross sales number which that's
correct.
The five million that that's
correct madam chair
representative and that's our
five year projection based on
our accounting for it chair
representative.
And.
Mr Madam chair representative
the projections with respect to
the demographics of the people
that will be purchasing this
material.
Madam chair representative I'm
would believe that it would be a
reflection of our own state
demographic as far as who the
buyer user of the cannabis
product would be I think it's
it's it would be reflective of
our own percentage use of of
based on our our population
madam chair representative.
Madam chair representative I
guess is exactly the point that
I was trying to get to because
don't we have over fifty percent
of the population.
Form of public assistance were
very poor state.
And we're about to pass
legislation that will take
another six hundred and twenty
five million dollars out of
their pockets I guess my
question is how of what budget
is this money going to come for
these folks.
Representative Romero.
There is I wasn't following the
question.
Okay so chair representative you
know I think a great deal of of
of this new industry will be
supported and and this is one
reason really excited about it
the a study that was presented I
believe it was to the role and
economic development committee
over the interim
showed that a great deal of the
new revenue would be new money
coming in from other states
places like Texas and Oklahoma
of course we were counting on
Arizona but now they've got
their own program so we'll take
them off the table but taxes in
Arizona Texas and then Oklahoma
I think you're gonna be two
places where here are going to
have quite a bit new money
coming in
with regard to
you know the domestic market I
mean I think you know New
Mexicans as with any other
industry make decisions all the
time right and you know the the
the the reality is that people
consume whether it's microbrews
or wine or beer entertainment
you know movies once upon a time
member those movie theaters.
you know there's a there's a
host of other things that we
make decisions on and I don't
think that would be any
different you know this is a new
industry and I think people make
decisions based on their income
and based on their priorities.
Mr Chairman madam chair Mister
chair.
Is there any limitation on the
number of plants can be grown by
the individual at home for
personal consumption.
Yes madam chair representative
it is so six mature and six
image here plants for home grow.
And madam chair Mister chair is
that.
A tough to keep someone supplied
for.
A year.
That's a good question.
I don't I don't grow cannabis so
I I don't know my my assumption
is that if you're good at it you
know that might be enough
depending on how much you
consume but my understanding is
that it's actually pretty hard
and and most people are probably
not going to be growing there
all I can tell you an anecdotal
story I tried bring beer once it
smelled really good and I
followed the instructions and
everything was great I was
really excited and I tasted it
was terrible and that was the
last time I ever tried I would
suspect a lot of people are
going to be in my boat.
Madam chair Mister chair ought
to have a Colorado story.
From a legislators one of our.
Okay council meetings.
And as it turns out you can't
really tell the difference.
In quality between taxed
marijuana.
And untaxed marijuana.
And the drug cartels.
I totally had moved to Colorado.
Utilizing their whole grain.
Portion of the legalization.
The fact it was not taxed.
And all of their law enforcement
resources were directed toward
illegal marijuana.
We're now been directed toward
taxed marijuana and I see my.
In my review of the data C.
Colorado.
As a total of a thirty three
percent tax on the substance and
I suppose in your conversation
earlier about twenty percent
sweet spot that was intended to
mitigate some of the effects of
of trying to hunt down the.
Next material is that correct.
That's certainly part of it I
mean I think that as I said
earlier you know we wanna we
wanna make sure that we create a
legal and regulated market for
cannabis and you know the higher
we tax it
the the more space that illicit
cannabis has to to operate.
One more issue that I have madam
chair Mister chair thank you
issues.
Yeah that's a fantastic question
Madam chair representative.
You know there is
there is a process through which
medical cannabis producers can
bank and
with the the few banks well you
know I'll give you that not
everybody allows this but the
few banks that do bank with
these industry currently have to
follow a whole set of federal
regulations and as a result it's
actually a little bit more
expensive for these industries
currently to bank
When we if if we legalize.
Adult use cannabis industry in
New Mexico they would follow the
same process that the medical
cannabis industry follows right
now again it's more expensive
for them and for the bank to
bank with them.
Others and added regulatory
framework that they've got to
follow it and it's very strict
from what I understand but that
process and that system is there
and it does exist the federal
government dating back to the
Obama administration
and then the trump
administration follow this as
well has essentially adopted the
so these rules and that's why
you don't see you know the OJ
coming in and busing up banks
that bank these medical cannabis
and even the fourteen states
that bank adult use cannabis
because they as long as they're
following those rules that that
there okay but it is hard it is
not an easy solution you can
just show up to the bank and
open up an account for your
adult use cannabis company or
your medical cannabis company it
is very difficult.
Sure madam chair Mister chair
could you please listen Kerr
with a credit card.
settlement madam chair and
representative I am not a
medical cannabis patients I
don't hold the chart I don't
purchase I believe you can but
all well I have my experts page
and if she wishes to.
Madam chair and and
representative in some cases
they can often what happens is
that they have special machines
in the stores to secure and
collect all the cash it's paid
but they also often have
cash machines right in the store
so you can use your card to get
cash and then paid for the
product.
Thank you for that while we're
on the subject of of medical
marijuana it looks like we
already have hundreds of.
Thousand prescriptions patients
on medical marijuana in the
state that's a so roughly five
percent of the total population.
What.
Provisions in this bill I'm sure
they have some reservations.
About the.
About this legislation cutting
into their business model what
the.
What considerations in this bill
would address.
Madam chair and and
Representative I'm unclear as to
your question are you talking
about the current medical
cannabis industry and what
reservations they might have
with this particular framework.
Madam chair Mister chair exactly
is slow if R. one is now legal
why would you go.
I was a prescription.
Catch a fantastic question so
first and foremost under this
bill we are exempting medical
cannabis from gross receipts tax
currently they have to be gross
receipts receipts tax under our
bill we would treated the way we
treat any other medicine right
which we don't tax Furthermore
we have created with this bill a
patient subsidy fund for low
income patients and the idea is
for people who are chronically
ill you know dealing with pain
management and the fall within a
certain income threshold that
threshold will be decided in
rural by the department if this
is approved but that those to
incentives really keep the
medical cannabis program not
only intact but that if you know
if you're legitimately.
Medical cannabis patient that
you are continuing to be because
there's more incentive within
this framework than otherwise I
should also note that
In previous iterations of our
bill that there have there has
been opposition to it from
medical cannabis patient
advocacy groups and this year
this is the first time that they
actually jump on board and and
have been pretty outspoken in
their support for the provisions
in this bill in in in in their
in their eyes it really does
protect the program and it's
going to continue to grow for
the people who need medical
cannabis
you know as a as as as a way to
improve their quality of life
and and deal with whatever
elements they might have.
Madam chair Mister chair to hear
you say we're going to
subsidize now to use.
one.
Madam chair.
Answers yes how much of this.
So what is the value of this.
Miss madam chair representative
yes under bill we would
subsidize low income medical
cannabis patients I wanna be
clear this up so this is a
medical cannabis patients not
adult use recreational just
medical under bill we had a
percentage of the revenues of
the excise tax going into I
believe it was twenty per cent
Emily that she's not in it was
twenty percent we've eliminated
the actual your mark from this
bill because there's some money
to appropriate yet but you know
our expectation is that if this
bill passes and the revenues
collected that are
Appropriations Committee and
Senate finance committees can do
their due diligence in the
appropriations process and fund
these funds at a rate that.
Meets the needs of the patients.
So madam chair Mister chair.
Based on the projections of ten
million dollars a year.
Once funds are available.
I mean it depends I mean it it's
it's a percentage of the excess
tax it's not a percentage of the
entire you know twenty percent
tax it's just a percentage of
the excise tax portion the eight
percent and then depending on
the inputs that's the up we're
going to get so I don't know if
it's ten million but you could
be.
Sorry madam chair Mister chair I
have misunderstood that I
thought you were discussing
twenty percent of the eight
percent which would have been
about ten million dollars okay.
Question madam chair.
Mr chair I believe I heard you
state the businesses.
We're clearly going to be able
to maintain their drug free
policies and.
I'm just curious as to what the
definition of impairment is in
the bill.
that's a great question madam
chair and representative I'm not
sure that he the word
impairment is to provide and all
a look at my experts to say no
it's not.
I.
Representative Romero did you do
when chairman I just wanted to
this was a question that we did
receive madam chair
representatives from our from
different folks in our in our
previous committee and we don't
touch the the impairment
provisions that are already on
the books again you know
cannabis is not new to New
Mexico impairment is
unfortunately not new to New
Mexico and so we don't we
actually just keep that all the
same all the statutes remain
intact madam chair
representative.
Madam chair Mr Chairman
representative.
In my community.
The oil field is generally
considered a dangerous place to
work.
Four thousand things that can
hurt you.
Hello the location when your
stone sober I think I would very
much appreciate.
Perhaps more clarification on
exactly.
What would constitute
impairment.
With respect to marijuana use as
it appears as though.
That might be.
Given present technology a bit
ambiguous.
Madam chair Mister chair
representative thank you very
much for your answers.
The that's all I have.
Thank you Sir.
Thank you very much
Representative Scott before we
go on I just like to let
everyone know that I know
there's an eleven o'clock floor
session scheduled but we're
going to we're going to continue
with this meeting until we're
done with this item and the
speaker's office is aware and we
will all be excused until such
time as this committee meetings
over so with that Representative
Strickler.
Thank you madam chair and and
thank you
chairman
You know it is you know I've
I've struggled with this this
issue I have personal experience
with the under age medical
marijuana excuse me
Illegal marijuana use in my
family and I've got friends and
that it recover from drugs and
alcohol and as you know in San
Juan County we're you know we we
have a lot of alcohol abuse we
have a lot of transients we have
a lot of drug abuse mainly
Arconic's and in my concern is
law enforcement and our our
schools.
Being a father seven kids and
having a one on Rulli
The sun that dabble in this it
was a kind of a nightmare for us
I have good I have a good report
though he said he used to.
clean and sober if you well and
he's studying to be a CPA status
undergrad and master's degree at
New Mexico state and county so I
mean there is some hope there
but I I know the homelessness in
our area issue is is acute it's
a real problem
and.
Force the cost benefit.
Madam chair and and the chairman
I think it's going to be a
negative impact and and we we
live right next door to Colorado
got great reports on all the
Colorado experiment other
Katagiri pig.
and Law Enforcement is really
in close cooperation with the
law enforcement folks in
Colorado and the statistics are
good as far as under H. rera
want to choose a pandemic the
rule of sensitive to that that
community on our our school
districts are really concerned
about this and how they're going
to you know they have a very
dynamic.
under age drinking under age
smoking and race drug use
programs to keep these kids
All the straight marrow and
every community our state should
be concerned about this this
isn't about me this isn't a big.
You look at the the the best
case scenario on on revenues
initial drop in the bucket for
at seven point three billion
dollar budget of fifty million
dollars is less and it's point
zero zero six percent so I'm you
know the the revenue source that
relate.
Make me feel better in a and I
appreciate that twenty percent
the I did hear the madam chair
and gentleman I did I did hear
the presentation revenue
stabilization is kind of a one
sided report.
it didn't really go on the
downside all the social cost we
had the let me give an example
madam chair and and gentleman
and and Mr chairman.
We have one regulatory
gentleman that handles alcohol.
Sales and distribution in two
counties.
And that's McKinley County which
has a high
alcohol abuse right and San Juan
counties right behind one guy
that that handles this you're
gonna have to really ramp up the
drug testing right now we have
the
D. W. I'm you know alcohol
testing we've got that down
pretty good we're gonna have to
do a blood test for you know
marijuana is just going to we're
just we're just need to prepare
ourselves that we're made a lot
of funding for law enforcement
and also our schools if you if
you factor that in in your
analysis
madam chair and and Mr Chairman.
Yes madam chair and and
Representative out of those are
excellent points and it is
something that we do need to
think about I would respond by
saying go that.
You know we're not.
Even though we are creating I
keep saying we're creating a new
industry we're creating a newly
regulated and taxed industry
this industry been going on for
many many years and you know my
hope and my expectation that by
legalizing smartly and by
legalizing through a framework
that really takes all of these
issues that have been raised
today that I've been raised last
five years into account you can
create a culture of responsible
use right it's no different than
alcohol and tobacco you know
any fee at any other sort of and
it's put in these terms but any
sort of sin industry right like
up creating a culture of
responsible use should really be
the goal versus prohibition
which I think clearly has not
worked
I think that once this once once
this framework becomes the law
of the land if it's the will of
the legislature and the governor
to make it happen it will give
us the tools and the resources
necessary to.
To to create that culture
responsible use I'm again you
know you know it's it's not like
cannabis use is not happening
right now and even perhaps even
treat medical cannabis program
is allocated as usable young
people wasn't happening it's
been happening for ever
and it certainly has been
happening in the last two years
of probation here's an
opportunity to regulate tax
I delete quarter the illicit
market out and only have a
legally taxed regulated market
again as I said before this does
not legalize use use of cannabis
you've got to be twenty one and
older right now whether or not
young people will continue to
use I mean that's that's a
policy decision that's a
societal issue that we have to
deal with but I believe that
that's independent of what
happens with this bill you know
whether whether this becomes a
law the land or not.
Lastly
you know one of the one of the
bigger concerns we've heard from
from advocates and from
stakeholders is to not your mark
funds out of the pot that's not.
No pun intended out of a pot of
money that is not quite there
yet and so.
In the original form of HB
twelve yes it would and as he
was introduced in the house we
already eliminated I don't know
gosh seven or eight different
your marks and we kept to the
committee re investment fund in
the patient's subsidy Fund in
the substitute in front of you
we're keeping the funds were
limited in the airport and and
that's to allow the probation
folks you know the the
appropriators of money to make
policy decisions as they
allocate the money in future
years and I believe as a member
of what one of those as a member
of the LESC along with some some
of you I believe that funding
for drug education programs and
reinvesting some of these
dollars in our young people to
build that cultural responsible
use.
And to address the risk factors
that lead young people into not
only smoking cannabis but
drinking alcohol and vaping and
you know doing whatever else
you're doing to self medicate
that we begin to mitigate that
and here's another part of money
another source of money that we
can use to do exactly does that
so I totally appreciate and
understand your your your
concerns but.
You know we have taken all of
those things into account as we
build not only is bill but the
last three or four versions of
this bill and as we move them
forward.
Thank you Mr thank you madam
chair thank you Mr chairman
I know there's there's four five
bills circulating right now your
bill has no opt out provision
and and that kind of bothers me.
No Colorado they have an opt out
program.
again it seems to of been pretty
effective up there
the
the banking issue is it is a
concern with local law
enforcement if there is a lot of
cash on hand.
Of these recreational medical.
The dispensaries what if if if
that's the right word we'll be
targets.
For for a warm habre and other
other
Crime issues and I know our law
enforcement really is is
concerned about that
you know again the training that
they're gonna have to ramp up to
handle listen and in the schools
being very concerned about this
as well and you know I know
either rationing king and right
smoking and racetrack uses
highly discouraged in and you
know there's a lot of programs
to to mitigate that but you
still have you know you still
have problems in that area
the
The one I was gonna try to go
over the the report that I have
state gentleman
From from Colorado they there
that that they they're kind of
that now the pioneer nascent
they have a executive summary of
from our law enforcement group
is called the Rocky Mount high
and and tasty drug trafficking
area and I recommend it did they
to review that it's I won't get
into it now but
they they have.
Great studies only impaired
driving if the tallies youth
marijuana use that I'm
especially concerned about the
adult marijuana uses force work
safety reliability and I know
you all talked about that
earlier.
The emergency rural admissions
forgot about health care is
going to be that's going to be a
big issue to in these areas we
already have that issue and San
Juan County for
are alcoholics in our community
and how you see almost daily of
the the the the of medical folks
having to pick up some folks and
and taken to the day talks you
know facility to help I'm so
we're up and and not you know
not not to suffer from exposure
with the cold weather then
there's also
the the version of
The black market that's that's
that I'm sorry I was kind of
loose mind my train of thought
the black market is really
concerned appears well twenty
percent you know there's a lot
opt entrepreneurs out there
that'll grow local marijuana and
and aids and seldom
and save everybody twenty
percent on Mexico were right
next door to Mexico and that
will certainly take advantage of
this opportunity as a are
Colorado what is what is your
remedy.
Ensuring the black market
because you really can't tell
what's been grown in New Mexico
was been grown in Mexico and in.
New Mexico south of the border.
Yeah I know that and that's
another great question soap for
first and foremost the the legal
and regulated cannabis market
also has
a host of.
requirements when it comes to
testing in ensuring that
whatever product they're selling
you know has to meet certain
standards right no different
than other things that we ingest
whether it's beer wine or
distilled spirits or whatever it
might be so there is a big
difference between cannabis
purchased in the legal market
and unregulated cannabis on
regulated cannabis unfortunately
can be full of toxic chemicals
he could be laced with a number
of other hardcore drugs.
You know when we talk about
young people using cannabis my
goodness convene if if young
people
are self medicating for whatever
reason and then again that's a
bigger societal issue
I've I've I don't want them self
medicating with whatever came
out of a cartel's hands up who
knows what's in there that is
dangerous it could be deadly at
the very least with a regulated
cannabis industry you know that
it meets certain standards it's
not going to kill you because
it's full of toxic chemicals
it's not going to kill you
because you would be you know
very technically can really do
on cannabis alone you're more
likely to all of the from our
call consumption just because of
the way the substance works.
So you know I I think that there
is a big difference between the
two.
As far as the illicit market
look you know I think that.
If.
Yes if an individual out there
you said New Mexico is going to
partake in the midst market of
cannabis of they're gonna have a
grow house and we saw it happen
up in you know your nickel
what's our representative madam
chair there's a big story over
the summer of these big caps
that they had out there at the
goes on the Navajo Nation.
Yes whether whether or not we
legalized adult use cannabis
will be relevant to whatever the
bad guys choose or not choose to
do the fact is that as long as
there's a market for in this
it's a cannabis product those
bad guys whether they're south
of the border north of the
border for a long our borders
are gonna do what they do
but I think that if we have a
smart.
Regulated.
taxed.
The legal cannabis industry.
We get a lot further in the
fight against not only listened
cannabis like I said earlier
against drug cartels in general
because this is our biggest cash
crop it's it's easy to grow it's
it's easy to transport you know
to do the other drugs that they
do it you know if you're talking
about cocaine you've got that
you've got to have a source.
Really south of the border in
South America you can grow coca
leaves in the mountains of
northern Mexico if you're doing
you know methamphetamines you
know there's a whole chemical
process that it goes through
cannabis not really so to the
extent that we can undercut that
illicit market I think we all
benefit and look up at the end
of the day I don't think it's
crazy to say that the federal
government will legalize it's
not a matter of if it's a matter
of when and you know it out of
presidents from both parties as
as that person is present trump
and and present violence have
shown openness toward a legalize
cannabis market nationwide so I
think it's gonna happen and I
want New Mexico to be number
fifteen and not number fifty.
One.
If you count the district of
Columbia.
Thank you madam chair thank you
gentlemen
Let me let me just switch gears
would be a little bit you know
I'm chili grower I have a
community garden I have a
regular garden I have irrigation
FY and grind the middle
Farmington in a I'm kind of it's
kind of a fun loving hobby for
me a disordered twelve chili
plants I want to do a little
better job this year fifty
percent are hot fifty percent of
all
it I I'll add your these plants
from a local farmer in our
twelve hundred marijuana plants
and and and replace my chilli
crop with with marijuana.
With this bill.
Matt from a grower be a local
grower well it depends right so
if if you if you want to be able
to sell you've got a you've got
to get a license and you gotta
make a decision as to whether
you want the micro business
license which limits you to
ninety nine plants or if you
want to pull out license for
which there's no plant them in.
Both of those applications for
licensure will require a number
of different things many of
these things will be implemented
the roll but you've got to show
a security plan to your point
earlier about you know you
having Kasher having marijuana
cannabis plants and people
coming in and robbing you gonna
have a security plan in place as
you submit your application for
licensure you've got to prove
that you've got access to water
right in it and that it's your
water we've had issues with
medical producers setting up
shop in rural communities and
tapping into a domestic water
well for example that maybe
didn't have access to a shooter
had access to for commercial.
So through this bill we're gonna
make sure that you prove that in
fact you have access.
now if you are a home grown guy
you know if you just have a few
chili plants near a few tomatoes
and you want to have a little
bit of cannabis for your own
consumption you're limited to
six mature and six mature plants
within that plot of land
and you don't have to get a
license for that but you sure as
heck cannot be selling that
otherwise you will be in big
trouble.
Thank you Mr thank you madam
chair and thank you Mr chairman
and I.
I think I'll stick with my
chili's
but if it A. Y. appreciate that
clarification and and
Yeah we we have a lot of fun at
the farmers market to and that
we don't want to be selling the
illegal marijuana you know to to
under age people but anyway
Think that wraps up my questions
a.
I have a lot of the information
on this issue and and
it'll be interesting to see how
these other five bills are for
built a kind of coalesce so with
that I'm I yield.
