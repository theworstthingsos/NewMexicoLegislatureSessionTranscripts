Anything that benefited our
state with a more revenues even
during the time of COVID.
Mr chair representative

Well when you say revenues yes
we received shares Act from from

big thing
most of the other revenue was.
Traditional type of Roadrunner

it's a good is a great concern
and and destroying really really
wonderful leadership at

Sir regarding that Mr chair you

thank you to the the state
treasurer's office for taking
that on as well in our state
you're doing a wonderful job
thank you for everything you
doing Mr chair thank you for the
opportunity to speak thank you.
Representative thank you very
much we appreciate your comments
and actually did not know you
came from from from that area so
that's what we have an in house
expert on all things treasure Mr
Collins I I just want to make a
couple comments I I loved year.
you're now due to to a center.
We don't want another name ever
and that's certainly been the
case with your office you know
for for a long time you know
that we know that for a period
of time you the that this was in
the news
you know and it was and for good
reasons so I'm I'm I'm glad to
hear that I I'm I'm a little
unclear on on.
On the COVID relief funds on the
the cares Act money so what what
what do you mean by your office
received money from the cares
Act that can you can you expand
on that.
Absolutely when G. R..
The COVID nineteen emergency
mission beach
occurred back in March I think
it was.
The treasury work and send money
to states and certain large
municipalities applied for for
for might.
that those funds came into the
state treasury state treasurer
That was
just a chunk of money that we
have since staff on investor
owned return until it was
distributed works or were you
just and so.
From from that respect
that respect we were able to
benefit from having a
legislative session you're all
holding our breath there's two
however we.
Active during that time thank
goodness it wasn't as bad as we.
I anticipated so we just had a
huge Christian
funding to sit there and go
until.
Decide how these.
Got you got you okay so as the
money flow from the federal
government and state it was your
office actually held the money
until he was ready to be
deployed for the different
government agencies and and
those that that interest earned
as part of the one hundred and
sixty million dollars that you
that you mentioned as revenue.
Mr chairman that's correct.
And that revenue flows square
now does it go into the general
fund for appropriating this
year.
Exactly just.
Very good very good
Thank you Mr Collins.
Get the other question Mr it's a
question or comment again you'll
help me decide your but you know
what one thing that
Representative Maestas and and I
think he's he's on here now.
I'm on the incentives to meeting
she she has been really really
good over the last ten years in
really understanding the nuts
and bolts of our our permanent
funds you all along critically
the the the permanent school
fund.
And he he updates we.
frequently
See if you look at me and all
things college football or
sports but then who also update
we and how the funds are doing
and so I I I.
The last update I got from him
was was you know this is current
school funding is not getting
really close to twenty two
billion dollars I know that the
opposite see treasure holds a
seat on the state investment
council and I don't know if you
can speak to this necessarily
but you know I I I want to
commend the the work of the of
the council and and the way
they've helped us grow this one
to the point where really you
know it it's it's becoming one
of the largest in the in the
world
and and and so it becomes a huge
asset for the people in New
Mexico.
What what can you tell me about
about that process I know that
there are several members of the
S. A. C. not just treasure he he
he happens to be one of
but what what can you tell me
about that process and and I
don't mean I don't want to speak
out of turn here I know it's not
your you know you're not with
yes I see.
But I I would imagine that
there's a great deal of of faith
that's put into what the
treasure has to say as decisions
are made within within that
board.
It's Mr chairman that's that's
correct.
Representative sits on that
board it's not something you'll
receive
I don't I don't get involved in
it do you do to really be able
to speak to the next level so
what's going on yes I see I will
tell you this though the rainy
day fund externalization reserve
fund
that was established in the year
or two ago we pushed our.
I don't have the number from
another
You know billion billion and a
half dollars over that matters
starts.
but yeah we're fortunate to have
that so.
To reserve.
Yeah and and and you know how
much much credit to to the late
representative that I yeah I got
in to our our chair or our
current chairwoman of of
appropriations Representative
Lundstrom you know for for
having the foresight I think
years ago to to create that that
backstop against these economic
downturns thank you so much Mr
because if you don't mind
hanging out with us.
For a little bit longer and and
they will you know might dive
into a few more questions for
you
next up I'd like to invite our
honorable state auditor Mr
Franco long to
to take the virtual Mike
miss Cologne police and and
please introduce your your team
as well.
Thank you Mr chairman and
members of the committee I am
thrilled to be with you this
morning and it is great to have
this opportunity to visit with
you about the incredible work
and the mission and approach
from the New Mexico office of
the state auditor I will begin
as instructed by our incredible
chair and my dear friend this
Martinez by introducing my team
and I have to team members with
me today the very distinguished
highly capable and the one
everybody looks to when they
really walk into the office with
a question it's Natalie court of
a incredible CPA highly
celebrated by her colleagues in
the profession I think at this
point within the last two years
I think Natalie has captured the
attention of her colleagues in a
way that has given her I think
two or three distinguished
achievement awards from
statewide organizations that I
appreciate her leadership in the
CPA secretary so it's great to
have Natalie with us today I'm
also joined by my director of
government accountability office
Stephanie Warner T. is who is
really just an incredible
individual who came with me very
early on I think with my one of
my very first people on the team
Natalie was one of my birthday
presents well I right after I
took office seven hundred and
sixty days ago seven hundred
sixty days of awesome at the
office of the state auditor but
Stephanie even proceeded Natalie
and that was the very first
higher costs the state auditor
she was an auditor and had a
certified fraud examiners
licensure in the private sector
and we were in that enviable
position of being able to bring
someone from the private sector
into civil service and have that
great expertise so I'm grateful
to have her with me today and I
know that that Natalie is
probably working hard to
Show is that beautiful skyline
for a moment and then maybe to
our slide show presentation just
to make sure that meddling know
that that's what we see up it's
great to have been able to sit
through deputy treasurer Collins
a presentation today I have
hosted him as a guest on
property become Cologne which we
shine a spotlight on all things
great in New Mexico on our
Facebook live show and and that
deputy trader Colin did a great
job that they thank you for your
work today as well Sam and
Mistretta I love the picture of
pink we beach makes me feel at
home yes you know we've had some
great reciprocation this year so
I think we'd be student and very
robust and refreshing so we're
excited.
I I really I'm thrilled to be
presenting today because this is
one of those committees treasure
I Kimberly hope all is well with
your family welcome back I
appreciate you wearing the UNM
Lobo red there today in
celebration of our flagships
continued success but it's great
to be with the both you're a
printed on this committee for a
long time like the honorable my
SS and then those who are brand
new like the honorable
representative behind and those
in the middle might be honorable
Representative Chandler I mean
there's so many great thinkers
on this committee I'm really
hoping that this presentation
keep your attention because I
suspect that you actually know a
lot of the work that goes on at
the office of the state auditor
let me begin by saying that we
when I first took office seven
hundred and sixty days ago we
had a long conversation about
what are going to be the pillars
of our office what are going to
be the values touchstones and
focus points as we think about
the work we do on a daily basis
number seven hundred and sixty
days we have embraced three
pillars of the office of state
auditor that's accountability
transparency and excellence and
so when we think about the work
we do when we talk about how are
we going to approach a new
situation or a new set of
circumstances we always think
about are we embracing the three
pillars of the office of the
state auditor that was our
accountability transparency and
excellence so on this side here
it provides a great overview we
talk about the vision of always
say which is to promote
financial accountability
transparency and excellence in
government for all two point one
million New Mexicans you know
the office of the state auditor
is known for accountability but
we have taken and the steps to
take it to the next level when
it comes to transparency in this
third pillar Mr chairman members
of the committee is just as
important and what I've tried to
do is celebrate excellence in
government when governmental
agencies get it right the.
Also the state auditor needs to
stand up and say they've done so
you know in the office of the
treasurer is doing a fine job it
is our position that we should
be celebrating that excellence
in government it is shouldn't be
that every time I walk in the
front door everybody assumes
it's bad news because our job is
also to celebrate that
excellence we've made it a point
to do that that we get our.
Wirth bones of from the audit
act every year and we promulgate
that audit act every year which
gives us the responsibility and
the legislative power as a
constitutional office we are
responsible for examining the
financial affairs and
transactions of about a thousand
governmental agencies and
entities that means everything
from our from our agency level
of departments like the
department of higher education
are at higher education agency
here in New Mexico all the way
down to some of our municipal
agencies and that government
policies and even some quite a
governmental entity so no not
everybody submits to a full
finance audit we have agreed
upon procedures and and
different approaches for
different types of agencies but
we do have that oversight on
each of them so could go to the
next slide.
We'll see the really the
construct of our office which is
we have about thirty eight full
time employees under this
structure you'll see that's my
cute little I love it when I can
have my my team all in
classroom style there and if it
feels like I've really got their
attention which makes me happy
we have these several divisions
we have administrative division
we have a financial audit
division which really oversees
all the audit to take place on
an annual basis we have a
compliance and regulation
Division which does work and a
promulgate and lead the way when
it comes to presenting our audit
rule we have right now six
vacancies I in the financial
division one administrative
services and part of that is
because it becomes very
difficult.
To recruit and retain the highly
credentialed highly skilled
individuals because we have what
every agency have insurance and
you know the state treasurer
experiences this as well but we
have compression right and we
have our ability to recruit with
the finances we have.
With the private sector which
accounts the the private sector
as a very robust sector right
now and the have.
It's it's a it's an account
market not an employers market
out there in the private sector
and so we do have that as well
so that puts you says the
remaining ones are guardianship
and conservatorship when I look
at this committee how is
comprised you know that a couple
years ago you said we want the
office of the state auditor to
provide assistance to the
administrative office of the
courts to make sure the work
properly overseeing those
conservatorship that exist in
New Mexico and guardianships
because we had a problem
historically with these with
these cases in New Mexico so we
were able to create in a
permanent way a compliance
regulation Division and put
under that the guardianship and
conservatorship Division so now
the judiciary can refer cases to
us if they have concerns you the
brought to them by the public or
with their own concerns about
conservatorship behavior we're
optimistic that the next phase
guardianship and conservatorship
two point OO will give us the
ability to provide some random
tests work of conservatorship in
New Mexico that is not where
we're at right now but we hope
to get there in the future now
the next a division of the
special investigation division
this is the one that's out in
front this is the one that
people hear about read about in
the newspapers any given year we
have about three hundred to five
hundred
folks reach out to our hotline
our fraud hotline or go to our
online a complete system to
provide very much
protected and anonymous
complaints and there is a
concern I always talk about the
office of the state auditor with
our thirty FTEs and are almost
one thousand audits and agreed
upon procedures we are still
kind of the needle in the
haystack kind of model because
audits don't look for fraud.
The test work in a test the the
reliability of financial
statements they evaluate
internal controls they do a lot
of things but they're not
looking so to speak for fraud.
We get to do with the special
investigation division as we
take that needle in the haystack
approach and we turn it on its
head we say we have two point
one million New Mexicans who can
all reach out of service going
on in their communities that
they've got a concern we ask
them to reach out to us those
concerns go to the special
investigation division.
We the government accountability
office that's the office of
without a report and inform the
public and each of our agencies
about areas of concern and then
really is that data
clearinghouse for our office of
the state auditor that means it
helps us activate the data and
report out to the public they do
a great job again as you know as
I mentioned we have Stephanie
Warner Taos with us today the
director of the government
accountability office she does a
great job she's been with me
since day one.
So let's see here we have our
next slide here the.
I'm I'm not gonna go through
easily I could actually spoke
about them during that very cool
classroom picture there but as
you see here the financial audit
division it is the primary
function said ensure the
financial affairs of every
agency are thoroughly examined
and audited you give us a few
million dollars and we oversee
eight billion dollars for the
transactions I always thought
that at some.
Time we really ought to consider
models that have a connection
between the size of the budget
and the number of divisions and
agency audit so we have to do
and tying that to our budget.
Improve this the one in my
opinion the one pinch point that
we have in New Mexico in terms
of the office of the state
auditor and the other branches
of government.
And we'll talk a little bit
about that later but let me just
say that on this on this year
the financial audit division we
do do also are property
dispositions we have agencies
that look to dispose of property
we review each and every single
one of those and then we support
our local public bodies with the
investment that you've made to
say that look we want to make
sure that are sick as our our
water authorities all these very
small entities that receive
capital outlay from each of you.
They were providing oversight so
you've given us a little budget
to be able to help them execute
on agreed upon procedures and we
give them grants to do that and
we provide that supports those
local public body so if we can
go to the next slide.
All right so here we have some
of the work of the great
government accountability office
and this is the aggregate data
that I talked about and I think
this is where you might find
some interesting information as
you think about the office of
the state auditor that is the
this is an audit snapshot a
moment in time where we take all
our reports and we and we
compile that data and we report
out how things are looking if
you take a look at the graph of
the bar graph to the left you'll
see that those are the number of
agencies that we legislative
audits for in two thousand
nineteen data and then if you
look to the left or or to to the
right you'll see the left is the
agency that we audited and the
different categories for those
agencies on the right we have
the fiscal year top ten findings
on the top ten findings we have
number one other which is kind
of that cornucopia but really
the next one is most important
we talk about all the time and
that is making sure that our
agencies have internal controls
and policies and procedures to
protect the eight billion
dollars that you allocate on an
annual basis and then we go down
from there moving along let me
take you to the government
accountability office slide but
we have really kind of cover all
of that but it is focused on
bringing those transparency
reports to the public and making
sure that we are lifting up and
holding those agencies and
entities accountable and
informing the public about those
accountability measures measures
we have about three thousand if
I'm not mistaken or maybe it's I
I apologize but we have
thousands of stakeholders on our
distribution list an agency
contact points that we
distribute information to what
our government accountability
office has risk alerts or things
of that nature that means risk
advisories reviews bulletin
transparency reports annual
findings report like I just
highlighted on.
The last slide the Director
there Stephanie Davis I get that
information out to all of our
stakeholders.
Moving on to the next slide here
this really kind of shows you a
couple of examples of what I'm
talking about you see there the
risk advisory in this year since
I was before the committees of
the legislature
last time we had a big risk
advisory about mitigating risk
in the COVID nineteen.
Scenario particularly as it
relates if we be on the next
slide I think that would be
awesome this shows the
mitigating risk an COVID
nineteen related procurements as
you know we did have.
I'm sorry let me let me have you
and Natalie take us to
With a service in New Mexico I
apologize if I got ahead of
myself there I just wanted to
show what these things look like
for our committee members as
they see them come through I
believe that's going to be five
number seven and they'll be able
to see kind of an example of the
risk advisory an example of the
fraud alert.
As we do fraud alerts out of our
office we we also work with the
attorney general's office to
make sure that all of our
stakeholders right there thank
you so much have that
information and that we are
notifying them we have concerns
whether it's about COVID
nineteen scams or whether it's
about cyber security these are
all issues that are of great
concern and we do those reviews
and fought alerts for the
public.
And and what is this a real
quick I'm very pleased with that
picture on the left we were the
only constitutional office in
the state of New Mexico that did
not have a flag pole with our
beautiful flag of the United
States of America and are
beautiful as the flag force in
New Mexico we put that in right
away and now people actually can
provide us which is pretty
doggone cool look to moving on
to the next slide we'll get our
special investigations division
and we'll get ready to start
letting this play Mr chairman
thank you for the ability to
provide this information we talk
about all this this is where we
really dig down on that fraud
waste and abuse mantra that we
have at the office of the state
auditor this educator public but
also give them those engagement
point that we will talk about a
little bit later but that our
product line an online portal
that you helped us build up over
the last couple of years make a
really user friendly but we have
fraud waste and abuse to find
here but this this really gives
us the opportunity to take a
look at and sunlight on any
areas of concern that we may
either want to bring to our
incredible body of a hundred and
twelve citizen provided for the
last in the nation and for those
tuning in we hope that we'll get
that changed here in the years
ahead and make sure that we
start compensating our
legislators for the hard work
they do but we get a report that
out to you on an annual basis we
get to work with all the
prosecutorial agencies in the
state and that could be
everything from the United
States attorney's office.
Down to our local district
attorneys and everything in
between especially our Attorney
General of the state of New
Mexico I work very closely with
them and they've provided some
great opportunities for us to
prosecute waste fraud abuse New
Mexico so here's a snapshot of
our special investigations
division and it shows you that
in two thousand this to your
comparative of two thousand
eighteen versus two thousand
nineteen we have done a lot
better job I think is getting
into the field.
And making sure that the public
knows about our work and knows
that we are the the entry point
when they have concerns in
government over there to the
right you'll see the cases
referred to independent public
accountants we have to evaluate
these concerns and then we can
do one of two things you've
heard about our special audits
at the office of the state
auditor and we can designate
those specialized or we can work
with our independent public
accountants to do additional
tests work while they're already
in the field doing the annual
audit so that shows you that of
those cases that were received I
show you which ones referred to
IPA's which were forty percent
and which ones were not we
evaluated them and determine it
wouldn't be a good use of
taxpayer dollars to engage
independent public accounting
for their work there so moving
on to the next slide there this
shows you the approach that we
have in reaching out and giving
folks an opportunity to engage
and taking us on that needle in
the haystack actually seem.
Mr auditor office the state
auditor there's a bill he ought
to be looking at and for those
you from rural New Mexico you
know what it is to just take
that place right off the front
of the ability and and and move
forward and that's a lot easier
than looking for the needle in
the haystack and so we give them
an opportunity to know that they
can do it anonymously in New
Mexico we do protect our whistle
blowers and the office state
auditor takes that very very
seriously and I'm thankful that
we no longer have national
government leaders saying that
whistle blowers don't need
protection we do need protection
for whistleblowers you've stood
for that in the past we give
them that protection and folks
can actually dial one eight six
six oh is a fraud to provide a
complaint or they can go through
to the online portal at W. W. W.
dot O. SA prod dot org.
I'm moving to the next one the
compliance regulation I've
already talked about that
guardianship and conservatorship
so we can move on from that I
think I've I've covered every
bit of that flight for you on
the front and and so we'll move
to the next slide which really
kind of get to the highlighted
the great investment you've made
in allowing us to communicate
with the public this shows you
are website and it shows where
folks can look up a hundred
percent of the audit for the
been released in New Mexico can
be found by anybody that wants
to get that information anybody
want to about our our rural how
was promulgated can also find
that information here on our
website so I encourage folks to
look for that but let me just
say that.
We are a high touch office I
think our customer service and
our constituent and stakeholder
engagement very very seriously
so folks say well I'd like to
see the audit of the Los Alamos
County or
We don't just say I will call
your good Representative she'll
find it for you we'll just say
go to our website and look it
up.
We actually make sure that we
send that to them via email
along with the link to the
website and the attachment of
the PDF of that audit so this is
a disagree agree I it shows you
the access point and then let's
just close out with this next I
here that talks about the work
that we do in constituents
services look what I became
state auditor of New Mexico
seven hundred and sixty awesome
days ago we opened up a
constituent Services Division
I've got one person in that
division he's also the person
that handles all my scheduling
all my point of contact and gets
me prepared for each and every
day but we take it very
seriously you'll see they're a
little Colfax County open office
hours before COVID we went all
over the state all thirty three
counties to make sure that we're
doing outreach and engagement we
have this constituent services
office we I like to think of
myself as the state's climber if
the drain is clogged I want you
to call you don't have to worry
about whether it's it's in my
office or not my goal is to put
you in the hands of government
civil servants that I trust to
make sure you get from where you
are to where you want to be so
we've done that we worked on
that we focus on it and I want
to just give a quick shout out
to the office of lieutenant
governor because I will say that
I work with all the cabinet
secretaries to give people the
answers they need but if I get
those particularly difficult
situations where we constituents
are versus help I got to tell
you that robin and Martinez to
the Baca at the office
lieutenant governor and Dr how
we might always have done a
phenomenal job assisting me in
getting the drain clog I have
had seven hundred sixty days of
awesome with a phenomenal team
it's a real honor and privilege
to serve New Mexico as the state
auditor and I hope that that
you'll have a few questions for
me although I know I've taken I
think a good amount of my time
but I'm here to be with you for
the duration as long as the
treasure I can Berg and deputy
treasurer Sam.
Are able to to to be here for
their questions and answers I'm
happy to take money there after
thank you Mr chairman and
members of the distinguished
Committee and thanks to Delhi
court of a deputy auditor of New
Mexico for managing those slides
even though I was a little bit
all over the board there thank
you very much and thank you to.
Kelly and Stephanie Taos who
helped prepare that slide
presentation Mr Maris.
Thank you thank you Mr great to
hear from you this morning and
and I always love your energy
and I always love your demeanor
always always always a pleasure
and and welcome Natalie and and
stepping congradulations
Stephanie it's it's I I know
it's the end of the baby's not
so baby anymore but the.
Still I'm sure.
You may not be sleeping as much
yet I know it took us a little
while to get the kids in the
rhythm.
Committee members any questions
for our state auditor it's so
raise your hands I don't see any
right now but please raise your
hands if you have questions.
Okay Mr auditor how your office
I think has a a particularly in
are rather service and
particularly important role
within state government with the
New Mexicans society as the
people's I would describe it to
people the watchdog right the
the the people's safety net
against the you know fraud abuse
and waste.
But it's still a political
entity rated still in elected
office and and and and you know
I'm I'm their political
decisions that have to be made
along the way how do you think
about how do you maintain the
independence of the office.
Mr chairman members of the
committee it's a very important
question I will tell you that
when I took office seven hundred
and sixty days ago
I think a lot of people have
questions
whether it will or whether those
questions in the minds of my
fellow Democrats like the
honorable Melanie A. Stansbury
or whether it was from
Republicans like the audible
Representative Strickland I.
I can tell you that because of
my journey having been a former
chair of one of the major
parties in New Mexico I have
been extremely committed to
ensuring the independence of our
office and make sure that my
actions reflected that
independence I took a philosophy
and I said it when I was on the
road all over New Mexico
particularly when I was in our
beautiful thirty three counties
as you know Mr chairman when you
go into these counties members
of the committee most of New
Mexico counties are rural if
you're gonna go into every one
of the counties the people that
you meet in the vast majority of
our county.
Frankly are going to be
Republicans.
That right thank you get down on
outside of I. twenty five are
you getting the thirty three
counties of New Mexico when I
went to those counties I had
Republicans looking up at me
when I was giving my
presentation and I made it very
clear to folks when I was in
Bernalillo county or whether I
was in catching County I said
look I'm with the office of the
state auditor and as I sit here
today what we know for sure in
government is that waste fraud
and abuse does not have a party
affiliation.
Right now I'm testifying to you
I have a former distinguished
state senator.
Who is no longer a state senator
is convicted felon Democrat.
Here with you today we have a
former secretary of state for a
secretary of state who.
It's no longer a statewide
elected official she's a
convicted felon.
Republican.
We know that Democrats and
Republicans can make bad choices
and be in civil service and when
they do they have to be held
accountable so for me I have
really really taken that message
to all thirty three counties and
said that I take that philosophy
very seriously and the good news
is now I've got seven hundred
and sixty days under my belt and
the work of our office reflect
that philosophy.
I have held democratic countable
who made poor choices and I've
held Republicans accountable
who've made poor choices so for
me I guess what I say it every
day Mr chairman it gets a little
easier because of the work of
the office of the state auditor
speaks very loudly for itself
and I think people have very
much believe that this is not a
political office but instead if
an independent office the really
really I not just to maintain
independence but also I waste
fraud abuse in New Mexico
without political agenda.
And I appreciate the response
you know I think a at a time
when there's so much distrust
government particularly at the
federal level and as we try to
rebuild that trust I think it's
it's of the utmost importance to
have
you know that that independent
body within our our our body
politic to ensure that people
have
you know had I continued face
and and and and that continued
support by essentially a referee
here's how I think of you all
right
and and not really fall.
you know take them to the to the
partisan infighting that can
sometimes take place you know
across across the board.
With regard to to your office
you know working with local
communities.
How how are you all working with
you know I I I've heard that
this particular session in fact
there's some work being done
around
you know small local water to
mistakes that may not be in line
with their audits and whatnot
and and therefore they can't
really access.
You know funds for example from
the the water trust board.
How how do you all work with
those very small often times you
know potentially disorganized
bodies to ensure that they're in
compliance.
I am so glad you asked Mr
chairman members of the
committee let me talk about a
little bit of a program that we
have at the office of state
auditor we give those entities
an opportunity to apply for
grants from our office to come
into compliance in the system so
they can be compliant and
potentially be recipients of the
capital that you actually
allocate now the challenges I'll
just say this and this is not
just buying Cologne and his
administration but also the
prior administration every time
there's a budget crunch.
These are the one to take a
first.
Very very difficult for us to
continue with a robust grant
program so some of the most
important and some of the most
needed organization to get the
help that they that they deserve
and so for me I've tried to have
a high level commitment to that
grant program but I will tell
you during times when you get a
five percent across the board
decreases and mandates it
becomes very difficult because I
don't have I don't have a lot of
flexibility my budget it is it
is a very a very.
Lean mean machine is what I
guess I would say and there's
not a lot of fat to cut I have
no choice but to bring a scalpel
into those meetings every single
time because there's just not a
lot of room for for movement and
I appreciate I I know the
speaker has talked to me about
that in the past and I
appreciate him always being
willing to listen on those
things and and and I appreciate
the work you do but know that we
have that program it's been as
robust as a hundred thousand
dollars annually and that's
always my goal but it is also
come down to as little as
eighteen thousand if I can get a
thumbs up or thumbs down on that
number up top my head madam
deputy is that about right.
On the thank you on on that
grant program so hopefully I Mr
chair members the committee have
a long answer short question but
I wanted to make sure I fully
addresses that I Mr chairman.
Yeah yeah and and you know you
raise an interesting point as
well you know what we have
sometimes is
as as the as the legislature the
appropriators you know we we
have a a great deal of of masks
of of some of our agencies and
some of our statewide offices
about alternately we are
responsible for funding in large
part the work that you all do so
that that thing that that's
certainly a partnership there
that.
You know that has to remain now.
Positive and robust.
You know I'm gonna move on to
one of our members are
temperamental you have your hand
up yup for.
Sorry Mr chairman for going out
of order I was listening and I
had thought of a question so
thank you it Mr auditor for
joining us today and for your
staff hi Stephanie good to see
you all I just yeah I'm new here
so forgive me I keep saying that
but I did have a question
regarding how your office may
work with our legislative
finance and the DFA and just
thinking about how us as
legislators sort of look at your
work and what you're
accomplishing across the state
and and for me I'm thinking
about our budget and how we can
be more efficient in our
dialogue with one another and
how we can take your information
and and the data that you
provide and apply it to us
having a better more robust
budget and how we look at
transparency built into our
system both from a tax
perspective and think about that
so I'm just curious how you work
with some of our other financial
agencies and and and what that
nexus is.
Mr chairman Representative
Romero I thank you very much for
that question excellent question
in fact what we do in our
offices we maintain a riskless
and at risk list and we do
distribute that to to your
committees optically the LFC and
we continue to do everything we
can to provide additional
information.
I will be honest with you and
maybe our.
That let me just say this I
would encourage members of our
incredible legislature to make
sure that you are reviewing are
riskless you're reviewing
agencies that have findings you
are reviewing those agency that
maybe you've heard about in the
press that the office of the
state auditor's concerned about.
And when they come before your
committee for hearing I would
love for you to ask them about
those concerns that we have.
And I I just have to tell you
that having sat through several
hours of hearings this year
Maybe that opportunity for those
things to those questions to be
asked could have been a little
more frequent.
But from my side of that
equation what I'm gonna tell you
is that I'm gonna try increase.
The quality.
Of attention that I give making
sure that on an individual basis
you are getting that information
before you hearing so that makes
sense of the word I get over the
LFC and we have this at risk
losing we publish it but for
goodness sake there are so many
bulletin articles and the the
the amount of paper that you
receive that would make my head
explode so I think I need to do
a better job before you have
these budget hearings to say Hey
don't forget Mr chairman
honorable unable Domingo don't
forget here's my at risk list
don't forget these are the folks
that have had repeat findings
for several years and there are
some people in my office that
might be a little uncomfortable
with that amplification and so
you know they might brought me
back into you know I I just have
to say that my team does a great
job of managing my enthusiasm
for doing my work as I say that
and and and no keep me with a
good independent that I have to
have as a state order which I
appreciate them always doing
that and helping me to that
professional standard of
independence but that's going to
be my commitment to you and your
question allows me to say that
out loud and I haven't said it
out loud before but having sat
through some hearing this week.
With the agency that I'm deeply
concerned about and not having a
single question come up from the
committee about those concerns
I'm wondering if I'm doing a
good job communicating and I I
have to say that I can do
better.
Thank you Mr chairman
Representative Romero.
Thank you so much Mr chairman
thank you honorable auditor that
is absolutely what I would love
to be able to work with and on
I'm still just learning the
budget and how the whole thing
operates and so for us the
earlier the sooner the better as
far as getting that critical
information and to always trying
to find ways to to make our
budgets more efficient and
effective and we're always
looking for for funds that can
be re purposed for the best
interest of New Mexicans so
anyway that we can work together
to do that is is my interest and
I'm so grateful for your
leadership and commitment to
that and and absolutely look
forward to to see more about how
we can do that and I'm looking
at your website if there's a
place to find it at risk list.
I would I'm happy to do again so
I appreciate that thank you Mr
chairman and thank you honorable
auditor and staff.
Mr chairman I know Mr chair I
know we might be running long
and I want to be respectful may
I just add one more thing I
didn't get thank you Mr chair
representative I want to
encourage the members the
hundred and twelve to work with
our office I wanted to say that
Representative Romero you have
actually utilize the the system
that we have in place to express
concerns about transactions and
governmental entities and we've
investigated that you are this
year have finally answered our
call we said look we want to be
able to decrease the amount of
revenue we're required to
generate at the office of state
auditor so that we can do more
work based on risk and not
revenue production in our office
when we conduct the audits in
house and you finally heard that
we and you answered it and so
I'm grateful for it and and I'll
closing that we work on a lot of
projects with the LFC look
there's my deputy deputy state
auditor good morning sunshine
we we work with the LCS the
projects joint projects we can
be that cares Task Force table
where we could answer questions
on cares Act money distribution.
and and and we provided that
kind of information flow and so
I just want to make sure that.
Fully give my team credit for
doing some of those important
items thank you.
Thank you Mr let's go to
Representative low on.
Thank you Mr chair and and I'm
just very happy to see our
honorable
auditor here with us today and
thank you again for your
leadership and everything you
discuss I think you might to
cover some of the things I was
gonna ask but just to follow up
with the set with what
Representative Romero was
talking about with with our
special investigations and all
that the information you give us
do you know how many can you
tell us how many cases that you
found under those investigations
in this last year I can't Mr
chairman honorable
Representative total I will tell
you that we get on any given
year about three hundred to five
hundred points of contact and I
mean through the portal or
through our fraud hotline and we
make those investigations and we
make a determination whether we
refer them out to an independent
public accounting for them to
evaluate whether any concerns or
findings or we actually
designate a a special audit
that the governmental entity has
to pay in addition to their
annual audit.
and we've had a lot to concerns
come out we you saw that graph
that I put up which showed how
many that we refer out and how
many we just try to do the
initial valuation say look you
know.
Limited resources this is the
concerns of the gravity risk
versus reward right now we're
always having to make those
analysis is what's the exposure
and what are we willing to put
in in terms of resources to
mitigate that exposure so every
year you it is very widely and
so I can give you a specific
number on an annual basis but I
can tell you that everyone that
comes in our director special
investigation Sean back works
very closely with our financial
division
led by the next large and and
they make a determination do we
have the auditor in the field at
this moment in time if we do
let's recommend do additional
tests work on this particular
area of concern if not then we
look at either forensic and or a
special audit at that moment in
time you know the best thing
about COVID nineteen is not just
that we have saved New Mexico
hundreds of thousands of dollars
by taking our our rural training
to become virtual which I didn't
talk about but that was awesome
I know so many of you are so
good at this virtual thing but
we actually privative during
COVID we have our rural training
that requires people from all
over the state to travel all
over put themselves up in hotels
get their per diem be away from
the office all that guess what
this year thousand nearly a
thousand over nine hundred
people participated in our other
rule training at no cost to the
state no hotels no per diem no
meals I didn't have to pay for
the coffee out of my pocket last
week for the coffee out of my
pocket because they wanted me to
write a white paper to paper
copy Mrs forget about it I'm
just going to pay for the copy
and donuts I definitely don't
it don't say nothing to anybody
don't it don't it this year but
anyway
we we we this this comment time
has been a great opportunity for
us to have it.
Be able to save taxpayer dollars
and and really be more affected
with our engagement and I'm
grateful to have been able to do
that Mr chair representative on
thanks for the question.
Mr chairman and I don't know I
just thank you thank you for
answering and I just want to say

the opportunities in the access
