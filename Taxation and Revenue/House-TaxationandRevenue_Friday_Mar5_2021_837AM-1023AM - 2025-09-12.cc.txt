Good morning.
Representative Lujan.
Representative Maestas.
Yes.
Representative Andrea.
Representative Romero.
Your morning.
Representative Scott.
The.
Representative Stansbury.
Here good morning this morning
Representative Strickler here.
Right
here.
Chairman Martinez.
And I am here thank you.
Have a quorum members good
morning we're gonna we're gonna
start with.
House Bill.
One seventy two and we have
Representative black and I
believe this ammendment that was
presented.
Representative black.
Then I believe everybody has it.
Is there a motion to move the
amendment for discussion
purposes.
The amendment number ace up
sorry that ciri ciri wants to
help out this morning.
The amendment number is.
Two two zero four three five
point one is what you should
have in front of you.
motion to the.
Amendment for discussion
purposes.
So moved thank you so much to
us.
Representative black thank you
for the for the amendment do you
want to.
You want to just give us a sense
of what it does.
I'm good morning Mr chairman
members of the committee
Basically I hope this ammendment
actually takes care of the
issues that speaker you got had
brought up concerns about the
bill
making it so that law
enforcement can only use this
for that the purpose of
contacting.
In the case of an emergency not
necessarily a relative of
someone committing a crime and
the other issue was to make sure
that this information is not
available to the public
impress.
To protect those that maybe a
domestic situation.
So I am I went directly to
Representative my Estes and he
helped me get this together and.
It was a drafter so I'm hoping
that this takes care of all the
concerns.
you Mr.
Apologies are there is a
discussion or questions on the
amendment.
Discussion.
Discussion thank you Mr chairman
thank you Representative black
and I.
You know the
Speaker had some legitimate
concerns you know when you think
about it in that context of of
giving government this broad
authority of information and
things of that nature
So I I don't have the amendment
in front of me because my from
using an old laptop this morning
recharging the other one but
but we want to make sure that
officers are **** nilly looking
into people's.
You know who their contact
information is and context is a
million dollars for.
Two questions and I want to that
is not approval but to that
officers
are confined NMED officials are
confined I don't know if it gets
is there but this languages is
certainly significantly better
in terms of the of the speakers
on concerns.
The representative
Representative Chandler.
Thank you Mr chairman and thank
you Representative black for I'm
working on this I still have
concerns I I think acting in the
interest of a legitimate law
enforcement purpose is very
broad and very vague and I
frankly don't know how one would
be able to enforce it and what
levels of proof would be
required to show abuse of this
kind of authority another issue
Mr chair and representative that
I have is I I don't know how
data is shared amongst law
enforcement agencies and whether
or not those with agencies could
inflict include federal law
enforcement and how would that
be used in would they be
required to honor this these
kinds of parameters vague as
they are and I still have a lot
of I think it's a it's a fair
attempt to but I I think it
needs work still Mr chair.
Thank you vice chair Chandler
Representative see no one else
on the amendment.
is there is there a motion to to
to adopt the amendment.
I move to a document.
In the second thank you.
Okay their opposition to that
motion.
Okay seeing not yet been amended
bill we're back in the bill as
amended any other comments from
committee members.
all right I'll go there's a
black person thank you for
working with percent Maestas to
sign up the language I I do
think it addresses some of the
issues that were raised by the
speaker I however going to what
some of what vice chancellor by
your Chandler said I do have I
still have a few more concerns I
did a little bit of homework the
last couple of days on this on
its face I think it's a great
concept if my vehicle is found
by law enforcement
you know I I and you know the.
God forbid I mean there I and I
and I'm incapacitated or
diseased I would want law
enforcement to be able to make
that first point of contact
Wheatley and I think it's a
father which I think was the
speakers simple it's even more
so you know I I I want to know
right away I don't want to wait
until there but figured out so I
I I certainly appreciate the
amendment because I think it
really does narrow it down to
specific purpose
but but but here here's my
concerns Representative black.
do you.
Do you know
Do you know how these databases
can or potentially are shared
with agencies outside of of New
Mexico law enforcement agencies
outside of New Mexico.
Thank you Mr chairman
My understanding from at.
Taxed red is is they're not.
In order to have access to this
particular database you have to
be a.
You have to be a.
Part of the department motor
vehicle.
Division in New Mexico
And it's my understanding that
it there's a there's a strict
protocol to actually
Have this access
my office the county treasurer's
office actually we have access
to the Department of vehicle
database and we have a certain
parameter of what we can do in
our office basically we can
access the database and we can
add leans on to mobile homes
that's the only access we have
I'm so the department has a way
of restricting what access
different.
Entities I guess you would say
actually have
you know for instance Mr
chairman.
There are are private at people
that are doing doing that the
motor vehicle I can't remember
what he called it at you know we
go and get your the quick and we
do.
I'm and so those those actually
have a different set of
parameters what information that
they are allowed to view and
edit
so that's my understanding is
that this would just be
available to.
Law enforcement in New Mexico Mr
Chairman.
thank you thank you for that
response Representative black
have you heard the national law
enforcement database and and how
that could tie into to these
resources.
I'm yes Mr chairman I have and
at this would not interface with
that system.
And thank you for that response
and how do we ensure that how do
we ensure that the that that is
not interfacing.
I'm Mr chairman and and I guess
I am going on the on the word of
that secretary of taxed Rav.
and that Jerry result has set as
part of motor vehicle.
I I I I appreciate that
Representative black I I think
the problem for me though is if
these databases to be used by
by law enforcement and with the
amendment for legitimate law
enforcement purpose I don't see
why state immigration and
customs in the pursuit of an
investigation cannot use cannot
acces the database and and keep
in mind you know it the the bill
is is very.
It's it's very B. nine in that
sense I mean it's it's a
voluntary program that you come
in and you find your you know
your why for your partner's name
at the time of registration and
every time you renew your
license or whatever you have the
option to updated or or remove
it so I I get that and I think
that's fine my concern is on the
back end and you know.
The the the distress that I have
certainly not of TRD I think
they're doing a fantastic job
with the distrust that I have of
of some of these rolled federal
agencies would president Biden
to go office he mediate Lee
announced a moratorium on many
of these deportations that they
were pursuing many of those
importation where against people
who have not committed a violent
from a crime their only crime
was being in this country
without documentation and.
Is as the new situation kinda
went rogue and and continued
even post part of the argument
is that that institution has
been stacked with people that
are pretty hardline about
immigration issues and sadly
many of the partitions of
continued so my concern is that
we're creating a database were
telling people to be.
To to that they have the option
to find information emergency
contact information.
But then you know it would be
great if we could just claim it
and say look perhaps under this
administration and its TRD
perhaps the information may not
be shared or maybe not interface
with the national database but
once you get a change in
administration you're gonna have
thousand some names on there
that are going to be.
That are going to be up for
grabs
and I think that that for me is
that a pretty.
Pretty deep concern that I don't
believe and I appreciate you and
Representative just as working
on the wording of the amendment
because I do think it addresses
some of the speakers concerns
but as I dug a little deeper and
the more I read into the
national line for the database
for example.
It just it seems like it seems
like we could really be creating
a big problem that is completely
unintended but a big problem
none the less so I I will not be
able to support your bill Mr
Mr Mr chair Representative on
that point yes so Miss Mister
chairman I understand the law
enforcement databases are with
other law enforcement.
Not with other government
agencies.
I understand that that what was
put in place after nine eleven
was what they found were these
walls between one law
enforcement agency and another
law enforcement agency not not
between law enforcement agency
and other government databases.
so I'm I mean I think that the
the fear that your describing.
doesn't apply I because it those
databases don't include.
Unrelated law enforcement
government agencies so I I I'm
I'm hearing that the the fear on
this but I don't believe that
a legitimate fair because is
there there's nothing about TRD.
That.
Is is law enforcement related at
all and so so for someone to
look for that they would
literally have to.
Come in and and make a request
for and I think that's.
I think that's one step beyond
what what you think could
potentially happen so I'm I'm
listening to the discussion it
just that but it doesn't appear
whether it was the this
administration the previous
governor's administration who as
you know as a hardline DA prior
to but those interactions I
don't believe have taken place
and if you remember I was a
member of that administration.
so I I mean I understand what
you're saying that your fear is
but.
As it is TRD or.
DFA or anyone else who might
have specific information that's
not directly connected to.
To law enforcement so.
I am hearing here your concern I
just don't believe it it it's a
legitimate concern unless law
enforcement this this sharing of
information would also include
non law enforcement agencies so.
That's my opinion thank you
thank thank you Representative I
I appreciate that and and I
think I think import your you
are correct I mean I I think
that you know when we stocks
would talk specifically about a
national enforcement database
and that sort of one example my
concern is the way the bills
written right law enforcement
the the information can be
shared law enforcement for
legitimate law enforcement
purposes I don't see how that
does not include immigration
customs and surely you know
maybe maybe our policy right now
is not to share information with
those folks
but all it takes is another
election and new people coming
in and then sharing the
information with a law
enforcement agency which is
I just for a legitimate law
enforcement purpose which could
be the pursuit of a deportation
order so I I I do have a lot of
hard print in the I I I just
will not be able to support the
bill Representative but thank
you for putting in the work and
I hope I know it's late in the
session so I don't know that you
know should this not get out
today I don't know if there's
time to revive it but certainly
I'd be I'd be more than willing
to to work out these kings with
you in the future to make sure
that we do exactly what needs to
be done without harming people
that we are not intending to
harm
so I'm gonna go to the committee
have got a couple more hand
still good Representative Lujan.
Thank you Mr chair and thank you
sponsors for about bringing this
fortnight and I just want fair I
say I hear an echo so your
concerns Mr chair what you're
talking about and I just have a
quick question on the
part of the amendment banning.
So I understand that this will
enhance the strength is that
this will get quick information
if this database is created to.
emergency contacts to benefit
the public that reduce time
taken away from law enforcement
agencies throughout the New
Mexicans reject them during or
after emergency we can you
speak more to
the quick access to emergency
contact in that situation what
what kind of situations where
the individual would be in
danger or is unable to
communicate how would.
How would that help how would
the utilize this information to
the state division
I just kind of confused with how
that.
With everything else that law
enforcement has to do that they
have the time to go to this
database into to use this type
of information that way I
understand and and the media
emergency but.
I'm just a little confused there
can you elaborate on that.
Sure.
Mr chair and representative I'll
I'll share a brief story with
you actually heard from.
A family in Albuquerque where
their their twenty five year old
son and gone to work.
And just one morning and usually
checked in with his parents
he didn't didn't leave this
parents but he checked in with
them every day or sell
They hadn't heard from him.
About three days so they
reported him missing.
And so they.
There's a missing persons
report.
They he was he was missing for a
week.
Parents we're we're you know
looking for impending provide
you know where it was
someone suggested that they call
the at the office of the medical
investigate.
Well about seven days later they
call the office of the medical
investigator and come to find
out their son had been killed in
a hit and run accident.
And.
His body was at the office of
medical investigator and the
office of medical investigator
had not yet time or the
resources.
To find out who John Doe what.
I'm so that's really one of the
one of the reasons that I'm
bringing this forward is I can't
imagine
my.
Sign or my sister who lives in a
different city for me in New
Mexico I'm.
Laying in the morgue for a week
and me not knowing I'm so that
would be one instance where this
information would Department
I've also been told another
story where at.
It was a college student that
was actually.
It involved in an accident
and no was contacted by when his
mother found out for five hours
after the fact and he had been
transported to the hospital in
that time had passed away I'm.
Had she been contacted sooner
she could actually it took him
for five hours to pass away in
the hospital she could have at
least been there to to rectify
that and and say our goodbyes
so it really that's that's where
this database is going to come
into play I'm from what I'm
understanding from the office
and medical investigator I'm
even from my co sponsor
Representative trusses who owns
mortuary I'm not sure if you all
know that
but that the process that they
have to go through to find next
of kin for someone as they come
in to a house that has a.
A body that's.
And and they try to go through
cellphone they grow through mail
the whole nine yards and so
really that's that's my
reasoning for this is to at
least give loved ones that the
chance if the person is still
alive and and unconscious
perhaps from an accident
to have that opportunity to make
a decision for their loved one
or at least get to say goodbye.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Thank you Mr chairman and and
thank you Representative for
that for that that background
information I I just I still
still kind of confusing for me
to understand that I mean how
how are those parents supposed
to know that that that situation
is even happened in a lot of
ways and I think I do understand
that you know the hardships of
not
Having the information when
you're looking for a loved one
and facing these kind of
consequences but I also.
Don't want to err on the side of
an unintentional consequences
much to what.
Chairman is talking about
So.
I'm still pondering this thank
you so much and I appreciate
your response on this thank you
Mr chair.
Several hundred extremely.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
Representative black.
Representative black this.
You know help me understand
this.
when when
I get my license renewed and and
and and I have the option to put
down and.
Members should contact
information and then it but if
that's so it my my discretion.
Mr Chairman representative yes
that is correct you would have
the choice if you if you would
want to provide that you can if
not there if you have no
obligation to do it okay well
that that helps me that that
gives me a lot of comfort if for
some reason I didn't want to.
With an emergency contact
information then then that be my
my decision but in the event I
was in a car accident and I was
unconscious
you know the authorities could
contact my why for example and
in it you know let her know that
that headed to the hospital and.
You know for a
for emergency medical care and
in in the and I would want that
I would definitely want that
that would that would be a good
thing and
you know I I guess I can kind of
see what the concerns are but if
this is optional
I think it's a good bill and the
thank you appreciate you working
with the Representative Maestas
in the bill drafters to try to
tie this up and thank you for
that clarification.
Thank you thank you
Representative Strickler by your
Chandler.

solid I'm just a little
concerned about the unintended
consequences thank you for being
with us here this morning
members let's move on and I'm
gonna pass the chair to buy
through Chandler for for the the
next few minutes of the meeting
take it away by your
thank you very much Mr chair we
are now on item house bill two
seventy two looks like there is
a committee substitute the
health easy enrollment program
is representative Thompson
amongst us.
I haven't seen her signing yet
madam chair but I called her
opposition.
Check to see what.
Why don't while you're doing
that maybe we could move to the
next item House Bill to ninety
five.
The sponsor is Representative
process and Representative
Hernandez.
Price chair of the blue should
be in just a second.
Why.
I see.
Yep.
Yes thank you very much trying
to juggle a couple.
This.
Now I know how my wife out with
the kids when they were little
and she's trying to keep up with
all of or maybe the state
legislature Representative to
losses you'll get used to it.
But doing all right.
I believe everyone on the
committee is okay a little tired
no doubt if you'd like to
explain the bill that would be
great thank you I can you know
so real quickly because of again
I'm juggling two things.
Honestly I'm gonna turn this
down so you guys can hear I'm
sorry about that bear with me.
We've got three devices going at
the same time.
We.
Just a second so I just wanted
to lower this let me so I can
hear when the low.
Okay.
Thank you madam chair Preciado
very much also Bill two ninety
five we've had some some things
involved since we introduced the
bill and so
we I I want to tell you it was
supposed to be a study to New
Mexico State University where
we're gonna try to see what the
effects would be on on.
retirement
income and trying to exempt that
reduce that for retired veterans
and and just see where that what
what the impact would be but in
the meantime we were able to get
generously Representative black
came forward and and she funded
with our junior money so there's
this bill has is without going
through legislation we've we've
actually been able to
to accomplish our goal.
New Mexico State University was
very proud to do the study and
so we are.
I guess we've we've met what we
wanted to our accomplished what
we wanted to so I'm going to I
don't know if I have to make the
motion to as a sponsor to table
it but that's what that's what I
have to do because there's
there's no sense in going
anywhere because it's it's
already funded.
Okay Mister Representative today
also so what I hear you saying
is you would like us to table
the bill be because you believe
you have it addressed through
another mechanism is that a fair
assessment is very very madam
chair that's exactly right I we
were asking for funding here
fifty thousand dollars for the
study but being that
Representative Representative
black was generous enough to use
for junior money to sponsor that
we have accomplished the goal of
what we want well but we wanted
to do which was to get it funded
and so it's funded already and I
know we've got lots of bills to
here and there's no sense in me
taking your time.
Thank you I do see a hand raised
well
Representative Representative
Montoya did you have anything to
add.
No miss madam chair I was going
to follow the Sanchez wishes and
make a motion to table very good

In the way I wanted to guess for

Representative we're thank you
for thank improving the
efficiency of our thank you very
much I just wanted to thank
everybody for hearing this and I
just wanted formally table it

it's the right thing to do being
that it's already.
Been taking care of thank you so
much for your time and god bless
all the.
And
You got also you are going for a
test thank you very much is
representative Thompson here
we've been able to touch base
with her.
Yes she was in another comedian
was gonna head over but I
haven't seen her log in yet okay
so why don't we then move on to
house bill two ninety nine as
amended Representative small
improvements special assessment
act if you'd like to give us a
brief overview Representative
that would be great madam chair
I'd be delighted to I'll give a
brief overview we also have
Genevieve Sherman as an expert
when we go to the questions if
we could bring her on over madam
chair committee thank you very
much for hearing house bill two
ninety nine as amended this is
both an economic development
tool and an environmental policy
tool madam chair it is voluntary
for
counties to implement the
special assessment opportunity
it does not impose liabilities
upon the state or upon counties
does not inhibit bonding or
other improvement
Programs for the state or
counties what it does do is it
makes commercial and multi
family properties not
residential properties very
importantly commercial multi
phone for multi family
properties eligible for this
sort of long term low rate
financing needed to do many of
the things that are so important
to stimulate our economy support
construction and also to help
with climate resilience with
energy efficiency water
conservation and the like
madam chair committee members
this is a tool that exists on
paper and New Mexico but due to
implementation challenges does
not exist in reality and the
fact that fact means that this
two point five billion dollar
tool available and twenty plus
other states red blue purple and
all colors in between it means
that we have a great opportunity
madam chair to bring this tool
to New Mexico in this targeted
way only for commercial and
multi family properties madam
chair committee briefly
this changes some of the
collection and billing
obligations from the manner of
property taxes that is on the
books now and very difficult to
implement to the matter of other
county improvement assessments
there by we think making some
very significant improvements it
includes industry back best
practices
and it also ensures uniform and
Ebeling ordinance and program
standards that are available
statewide again this is a
voluntary program for counties
but we do want to make sure that
the standards are uniform and we
madam chair I'll just close by.
Saying with there is funding
included in the supplemental
appropriations bill to the
Economic Development Department
in order for them to stand this
up in to fulfill
a a small but nonetheless
important obligation that this
bill would would place upon them
madam chair I would close with
that.
Excited to have this
conversation with you in the
committee thank you very much
for your time.
Madam you're on mute sorry.
Thank you so much Representative
for that explanation of the bill
I think we should go to the
audience now in the attendees
anyone opposed to the
legislation anyone opposed to
the legislation please raise
your hand.
I see no hands raised
proponents of the legislation
please raise your hand.
And.
R. I. C. one hand raised if you
could keep your remarks to one
minute I'd appreciate it and I'm
trying to find the name of the
person who out Nancy Harris
these.
good morning madam chair madam
vice chair and and members of
the committee my name is Nancy
burst I'm
being Bernalillo county
treasurer of as well as in this
capacity representing the
treasures of Philly at of the
New Mexico association of
counties
we've been very
happy to to meet with the bill
sponsor and understand this bill
compared to what's already on
the books and in a few counties
and why it hasn't worked or what
are what our preferences are in
in our counties and those disks
discussions we forward
we only started them you know
yesterday afternoon so we
appreciate Representative small
and his expert to to work with
us I'm just just ironing out
some final details on the bill
but otherwise
I we are we are not opposed to
this and
appreciate this coming forward
to make it workable that's
that's always what we want for
our New Mexicans thank you so
much I stand for any questions.
Thank you very much adjacent
Jason Espinoza.
Madam chair members of the
committee Jason Espinoza
registered lobbyists with the
associated general contractors
New Mexico we stand in support
of the legislation I think
Representative small for
bringing this forward we think
this is going to really help
with these projects and and
before some of the projects with
the construction industry thank
you.
Thank you I see no other hands
raised I think we can go back to
the committee now.
All right.
V..
Representative Montoya.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative small.
so as I will understand this
this would
If if this were adopted and and
this were put in place on a
property.
This would be very similar to a
a two.
special assessment.
that.
That.
If.
A property potentially were
foreclosed on or.
well let's just say for closed
on.
This would be something I would
have to be paid off by the
purchaser.
similar to taxes it would be
elevated above the.
standing of the mortgage holder.
That the lean on this would be
at the same as that.
Of taxes it would be preeminent
it to the mortgage is that
correct the.
Mr speaker and gentleman madam
chair.
Why I would last night then we
are all tired is in the small.
Great thank you very much madam
chair thank you Representative
Montoya the the amount that
would be delinquent on that bill
Madam chair representative would
be collected and and in the
manner of those taxes but the
full amount only the man the
amount that that would be
delinquent not the full amount
of the financing.
So thank you madam chair
representative small the.
Obligation
At the time of.
At the time of transfer to the
new buyer that disclosed to the
buyer at that time.
Thank you madam chair at
Representative my expert again
Mr chairman is telling me that
yes the obligation transfers are
those obligations are disclosed
upon transfer and it would be on
Madam chair representative that
would be part of the land
records.
So thank you madam chair and and
Representative small so the.
So at title at closing
that would be part of
disclosure.
madam chair and representative
at that is my understanding yes.
If Mr Sherman who are madam
chair thank you all for letting
her in if she
If she wants to add anything but
but it would be part of that
closing Matt madam chair Manco
ask Miss if if Mr Chairman once
at anything absolutely.
Mr chairman thank you Madam.
Thank you madam chairman and and
hello other I representatives my
name is Jenny chairman I'll wait
on the screen so my.
Thank you for having me I I I
echo Representative small I'm
there will be a document filed
on the land records to evidence
the existence of a special
assessment of this nature on the
property and it would absolutely
be disclosed at bit conveyance
of the property whether that was
voluntary or involuntary.
I also wanted to know that these
assessments and maybe
voluntarily prepaid at any time
if a purchaser of the property
wishes to pay the remaining
balance of assessments that have
not yet been impose they may do
so but they are not required to
and in the event of an
involuntary transfer the the
ongoing assessment payments
transfer with the property and
on the program so they would
become the application of the
new.
Thank you madam chair and and
Representative small I'm.
Once again I'm a realtor so
I'm looking at this
What I do commercial.
But the bulk of of what I do is
residential.
And
And and to me the problem I see
with this is
At least in residential if you
were to put
So we're for for for.
Or even battery power on
property it's it's kind of like
a so I'm cool
the person who purchases.
they do it in that instance
because it's you know value to
them however.
It's not necessarily value to
the new purchaser.
And so
If someone is is looking at
buying.
A property.
The value of the property in
their minds is the value of the
property.
and.
In the case of eight eight eight
two at the very least Mr chair
and and Representative.
Small is that it is are required
generally to upgrade a whole
network an entire area.
and so in this instance so it
would be a single.
Property and we usually allow
tickets because it's it's to
complete a.
An entire project entire
development.
And then it's passed on to the
people who are in that
development this is for a single
structure or in the case of
multi family maybe at a couple
of structures.
And generally we allow the the.
Assessors.
To to to do this.
in part it's a kind of an
unfunded mandate on them because
we're getting on behalf of the
developer.
So and.
The treasurer's office as well
so I can see with the.
Provision that is voluntary.
I can see why they're not
necessarily taking a trip
they're not against I think was
the the words the traders
association used.
I guess as long as it remains
voluntary to a county.
Because what we're doing here is
we're we're essentially asking
them to play middle man to what
is the equivalent of a second
mortgage.
From the standpoint of of of.
Processing and and and.
Taking care of the the dollars
that come in so.
When we do that for development
that's one thing we do it for
just an individual.
Property owner let's say.
It seems a little bit out of
step with.
How we use that public office I
guess more of a statement I'm
I'm working through this if you
can tell I'm working through
this in my mind thinking about
the practicality of it and it
just doesn't seem that
practical.
but a I guess as long as it
remains if this thing goes into
effect and it remains voluntary
that's one thing but if if if.
If the goal is to begin it again
this program is voluntary and
then come back and make it
mandatory.
I think there would be strong
opposition so.
Okay once again I have allowed
you all into the.
twisted mind of Representative
Montoya and his thoughts and and
that's the best way for me is to
the state to state this I'm
trying to work this through in
my own mind so I will just the
rest debate thank you madam
chair and representative of
small.
Was it scary experience
Representative.
Representative Scott.
Representative up Scott.
Yes.
Technology.
Chair thank you.
Of Representative small just a
couple of questions who is
responsible for collecting
payments here to assist the
government entities as
authorized this special session.
Thank you very much madam chair
thank you Representative this
would be that the
The county treasurer madam chair
representative
they would collect two they
would collect these Madam chair
representative they are able to
outsource that administration
under this program so madam
chair representative if they
choose to outsource the
administration of that
collection they are able to do
so that's one of the features
that that we really like
secondly Madam chair
representative
I'm told by my expert that
delinquent installment
collections
would be by the capital
provider.
But the administration would go
through that county treasurer
and can be outsourced to
another.
That administration could be
outsourced.
So is the advantage of this
program.
To the.
The.
It is doing installation in the
is it elevates they're laying.
Ahead of what.
We would be.
In a mortgage.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Madam chair
representative my understanding
is that they are they're co
equal and that these would be
collected on that on the time
period basically in that time
period would be sent out by as
Representative Montoya noted in
a voluntary manner by the county
Madam chair representative you
are correct that this would be a
lame senior to a mortgage the
same as the county.
P. ID improvement district of
public to use me public
improvement districts similar to
what Representative Montoya
noted with the Ted but
You a sorry long answer I should
have just said madam chair
representative you're correct.
Fulgent.
Thank you madam chair
Representative small okay give
you a hypothetical situation.
And.
Walk through was if you would.
How that would work.
Building it's worth.
Let's say for example in
dollars.
I put there one million dollars
of this special assessed
property that'll tax rules.
The property themselves to a new
owner for one and a half million
dollars with that assessment
still in place.
What questions.
Is the assessment and the
property value declines in
proportion.
Or does it stay in place the
property itself declined by.
The shortfall how can we miss
madam chair Representative how
that would work.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative I would ask madam
chair representative Mr chairman
if she could help illustrate
that scenario thank you for
Sharon and Mr chairman if you
might madam chair.
Absolutely it's proceed
measurement.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Scott.
the simple you find the
assessment and improvement are
not a directly connected to the
property's value per se of the
property will transfer and be
purchased for whatever price the
buyer and the seller have agreed
to but what will happen in that
instance is the assessment
obligation will transfer with
the property at sale unless the
buyer voluntary.
Is to prepay the remaining
balance of assessment charges.
In some instances buyers to use
your prepaid these assessments
in many other instances they
elect to be taxed on the
property and the reason is that
the improvements funded through
this program typically enhance
property value and they help to
reduce operating costs and
increase the property's value.
And it may be beneficial for a
buyer to leave the assessment on
the property.
Hey at the operating expense
fundamentally it's a decision of
the buyer and the seller.
The dictated by this law H. B.
two nine.
Okay.
Your thank all the questions
thank you madam chair sure.
Representative.
Thank you Representative Scott
Representative Strickler.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative small
this this.
It is similar to Representative
the Kiehl's bill I think on
special assessment assessment
for residential.
this is kind of a.
You back on on that
you know special assessment.
Thank you for thank you very
much madam chair and thank you
Representative it's.
Strickler Madam chair
representative Strickler this do
stays entirely away from single
family residential homes Madam
chair representative it actually
repeals some older statute that
has that it dealt with that not
Representative kills Madam chair
representative this would apply
only to the commercial buildings
and multi family.
Apartments basically.
So as a practical matter
Representative small this should
be
A solar rooftop solar
opportunity and can you give me
an example where this you know
how this would work I know
Representative Scott
can throughout some ideas there
I'm still a little bit confused
out hello
you know the practicality of
this and the who would take
advantage of it
in the.
No thanks excuse me Mr small
Representative Ezzell Mr
Strickler Representative
Strickler could you please go
through the chair I will go
through the chair thank you
madam chair.
Madam chair representative thank
you very much for the question
Madam chair representative
there's actually a wider array
of of.
Installations that would be
eligible Madam chair
representative these would
include and probably starting
madam chair representative with
some of the ones that property
owners whether these commercial
properties are multi family
would like to take advantage of
energy efficiency whether that's
in new construction or in
retrofits and madam chair
representative that's a wider
range one of the reasons that
we heard the support from
mistrust being no Sir whether
that's better insulation whether
that's more efficient heating
and cooling
a wide array of energy
efficiency upgrades would be
eligible excuse me.
Water conservation.
Measures
Madam chair representative the
actual energy generation whether
those would be solar wind
geothermal for sure would also
be eligible Madam chair
representative and then finally
there's a category in here for
resiliency which for New Mexico
mainly would have to do with
things like drought so coming
back to water conservation in
some parts of our state that are
prone to forest fire or
vulnerable to that it could also
very much include upgrades meant
to protect against that the
threat of catastrophic wildfire
so Madam chair representative.
Say a building owner of
commercial building owner or a
multifamily owner says I want to
upgrade the H. back system and
also better insulate my building
so I don't have to spend as much
during the the hot summer months
and Madam chair representative
again on a voluntary basis if
the county chooses to do this
then and they're in a district
that's eligible on that part of
the county it's in there to they
said that part of the county is
eligible then that property
owner would be able to go to a
capital provider work to get
that capital staff ready to do
those upgrades
And and then go through the and
and all of this and sorry
mention going along all of this
we're working to make these
standard as the standard and
clear of a process so that again
if a county chooses to do it
there's a very standard clear
process by which they can that
the proposed improvements and
then go through the process for
those improvements to get their
capital to make all of the
agreements there's multiple
disclosures with.
The mortgage the the lien
holders I guess the mortgage
holders for those properties to
consent to doing these
improvements.
So I probably spent more time
than I than was necessary but I
hopefully that gives a little
bit of a sense madam chair and
representative what a potential
example could look like around
our state with this approach.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative small.
So.
You know we so we got a property
owner we had a commercial
owner and he wants to.
not a surely put it rooftop
solar maybe that's not its main
goal but you he wants to upgrade
the heating and air conditioning
and insulation
and
Rather than go through a second
you know like a second mortgage
or home improvement mortgage
Can you say residential example
No construct you know adding a
room addition or you know things
of that nature they would
go through this process I mean
what we want to think it was C.
vantage I may know it normally a
a commercial property owner
the other pretty savvy on on
financing I mean
that that that's what they do
and
the the rants
you know cover their mortgage
plus and if the tenants you know
You know push the owner you know
gosh we we don't have any
insulation in this building for
example and this is a hello very
you know kind of an expensive.
investment that'll help the
tenant reduce you know lower
their their electricity bills
and and their especially during
the summer months when you know
maybe crank up the air
conditioner so.
Maybe give me an example where
this would this would.
The face of all.
Garces a home equity loan or our
our commercial equity loan.
Thank you madam chair thank
Representative and a course of
Mr Chairman wants to add but
madam chair and representative
there is such a there's a wide
array of available upgrades I
know and in the community that I
come from they're saying that
the capitol access afforded
under this for very important
building upgrades or inclusions
of these energy efficiency
primarily measures some water
conservation some energy
generation
they're able to
save their equity Madam chair
representative so put in other
parts of the construction and to
finance the entirety of the is
very important building
improvements upgrades or new or
features to be included at the
new time over this longer term
with this lower annual payment
specifically for those pieces
and so madam chair and
representative.
What I'm being told by some of
the of the property owners and
the folks who want to use this
to on development as they see in
other states they're the they're
saving on equity by financing
through these measures that
these long terms of these low
rates with well established
capital providers and therefore
they're just able to do more
Madam chair representative
they're able to maybe build a
little bit more add another
feature that they wouldn't have
been able to add in in some
cases they're able to actually
get it off the ground as opposed
to
You know kind of been stuck in
the in the in a tough place
where they just can't pull all
the financing together.
Thank you madam chair thank you.
Gentleman I I can I can really
see an opportunity for
geothermal you know it's a
heating and cooling
system and very it's very
feasible
in our climate you know you you
drill a well and and recycle you
know water and and
Really can lower your your
energy and more heating and air
conditioning costs and it didn't
take that much land I may choose
to have a you know if you got an
acre property you got you got
run to to date you thermal
upgrade
and so forth what other states
are doing this madam chair and
and Representative small great
great question madam chair
representative I've go to Mr
chairman but some of the most
interesting examples madam chair
representative the state of
Nebraska the state of Oklahoma
Are just two of the twenty eight
so there's a Madam chair
representative Mr chairman could
you add a few more that are
right here in our neck of the
woods Nebraska and Oklahoma
where some of the ones that are
most interesting to me.
I sure thank you madam chair and
representative small other
states that have active programs
in your part of the United
States would be Colorado they
probably have the longest
standing program at the state of
Utah and most recently the state
of Nevada.
Thank you thank you madam chair
thank you Representative small
thank you thanks for to and this
is an optional program.
Absolutely madam chair
representative so madam chair
and and Representative so what
like at Representative
Representative Kyl's bill that
mainly focus on residential two
counties if they have opted in
with that with that.
The.
Early on I believe Santa Fe
counties is that your
understanding Madam chair
representative yes okay thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative small appreciate

We are now on the last item how
house bill two seventy two
healthy easy enrollment program.
I'm here madam chair are great
and welcome a chairwoman and
representative Thompson do you
have an expert with you I do
it's Gabby Rivera.
Okay if we could let ms Rivera
in.
She in.
Very good Representative
proceeded explained your
spelling your.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee I I
hear you all kind of stumbling
and bumbling this morning I.
It's I think we're all in the
same boat I had I had a bill in
Senate education and I have
health and Human Services and I
got fifty six X. and I phone
calls while I was
in in and and so my brain is.
Going ten thousand directions
but I will try to be quick madam
chair so there are still a lot
of people in New Mexico who are
without health insurance and
that costs all of us are in the
pocket book and so what this
bill is is a way to find some of
those people.
Who have who do not have health
insurance but are qualified for
either for Medicaid perhaps
chair or for a plan on the
exchange and this is a fairly
simple bill madam chair what it
does is it allows you to check a
box on your state income tax
that said I don't have health
insurance when you do that that
gives permission for your
information to be sent to the
health insurance exchange which
at this point is part is kind of
a combination of eight federal
extremes in the state exchange
but we are transitioning to it
to be a totally state exchange
so when they get your
information they'll look at it
and if you qualify for Medicaid
they'll send you in the right
direction and help you get
signed up for Medicaid or if if
you qualify on the exchange they
will help you get qualified for
a free or low cost health
insurance on the exchange and
that's pretty much it and I will
let Gabby adding anything else
you want to thank you madam
chair.
Ms Rivera.
Thank you madam chair and
representatives thank you for
having me and my name's carrier
fair I'm policy analyst that
help actually Mexico I'll speak
a bit more to how this bill
works and why it's needed so we
know that there are about two
hundred fourteen thousand New
Mexicans or about ten percent of
population that currently you do
not have health insurance and
the pandemic has made it clear
that having this many members of
our community go without access
to health care affects and
should concern all of us and you
families USA report estimates
that thirty three thirty three
percent of COVID deaths and
forty percent of infections were
associated with health insurance
gaps and discourage people from
seeking treatment as soon as
they began experiencing
symptoms.
The figure that really inspired
this bill is that of that two
hundred fourteen thousand
uninsured over fifty percent
already qualify for Medicaid or
pre insistence on the exchange
that means affordable coverage
is already available to as many
as two hundred thirteen thousand
New Mexicans you may not know
they qualify or have other
barriers preventing them from
accessing it and that's why
we're proposing easy enrollment
bill.
Easy enrollment we will be
leveraging the income tax system
to reach the uninsured and
connect them with coverage when
a New Mexican pulls out the
personal income tax form there
will be an optional section
where they can indicate which
members of the household or
uninsured if any then there will
be a check box with clear
disclosure language for the
taxpayer can choose to consent
to the release of insurance
relevant information from their
taxes for anyone marches and
shared that taxed rec department
will then send that data it's
the Mexico health insurance
exchange will assess the filer
anyone household qualifies for
coverage or premium assistance
connect them with brokers or
agents and open a special
enrollment period for them to
sign up and they will also refer
people out to HSD for Medicaid
or to New Mexico medical
insurance pool inappropriate.
The legislation all also
provides exchange with the
option if it's feasible within
the new state based exchange or
in the future to allow automatic
enrollment and no cost coverage
in the tax form in this case TRD
would add a separate sandbox to
income tax form for filers for
question consent to automatic
enrollment and no cost coverage
if they are found qualified for.
We did model this legislation
after program in Maryland and I
want to briefly mention that
they had a really promising
results in twenty twenty which
was our first year of
implementation over fifty six
thousand people check the box
allowing their information to be
shared and three thousand five
hundred sixty people enrolled
into coverage and really
exciting data point from
Maryland is that forty percent
of those rules for young people
which improves the risk pool and
restaurant costs for everyone
and we expect this to be just as
effective in our state for more
Sam.
We had incredible community
support we have endorsements
from the New Mexico Public
Health Association southwest
women's Law Center Mexico
conference of churches the
senior citizens law office
blueprint advocacy
administrative and I believe
you'll hear from some of these
groups support today.
We've also produce this bill
through some outstanding
interagency collaboration with
the office of the superintendent
of insurance the Human Services
Department TRD at the exchange
and advocates in Maryland and to
build this program that works
for sponsoring for everyone and
that will have the intended
effect.
With affirmative consent and
each level we believe this
empowers taxpayers get more
utility from the time and effort
they put into their taxes this
will be the simplest entry point
for people that have never
navigated the health insurance
systems and they can finally get
coverage they already qualify
for we see it as an nonpartisan
common sense solution to a
persistent problem and madam
chair committee members we
looking would you pass
recommendation thank you.
Thank you very much Mr there
representative Thompson anything
else before we go to the
audience we are ready for
questions madam chair very good
we will go to the audience
anyone opposed is raise your
hand.
I don't see any hands raised in
opposition those in favor please
raise your hand.
Very good we if I'll go to the
audience you'll get a minute and
a half and I appreciate your the
synchronous directly in.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is
Derek lane and I'm representing
New Mexico voices for children
we like to think sponsor brings
important bill forward we New
Mexico voices are also the
conveners of the New Mexico
Medicaid coalition and we know
that one of the challenges we
face in getting more people
covered either on Medicaid or
the exchange they don't know
they're actually eligible voices
also word governor Gary Johnson
in the early years of the
century to include a letter with
tax refund checks the lead tax
filers know that their children
might be eligible for Medicaid
that effort help to enroll
thousands of children now it's
not just children New Mexico's
uninsured include many working
parents who may not know that
they too can get coverage this
is an innovative program that we
want to think HSD into your do
for their cooperation supporting
if we want to open up our
schools if we want to get this
pandemic under control if we
want all our kids and families
to be healthy getting more of
them health care coverage is an
important part of the public
health effort we urge you to
support this bill thank you.
Thank you very much sharing Sen.
Am I am muted I goes.
Madam chair yes you may proceed
okay madam chair and members of
the committee my name is sherry
dots and and I am a volunteer
advocate for a a RP would like
to thank Representative Thomson
for bringing this bill forward
as a retired nurse I recognize
that access to health care for
all New Mexicans is essential to
healthy workforce that helps to
protect all of us and
contributes to the health care
welfare for families A. A. R. P.
stands in support of a bill to
seventy two thank you.
Thank you very much Mr Sen ms
Bruno please.
Hello madam chair members the
committee Kerry robin brown
registered lobbyists for the New
Mexico Medical Society we
strongly support this
legislation we think it's a
really great idea one of the
things we like most about this
legislation is it truly does
empower the individual taxpayer
can make a choice as to whether
or not they want to have their
information shared with the
health insurance exchange as
soon as that happens we know
that the insurance exchange can
do an excellent job at referring
people to the kinds of insurance
plans that would work for them
and securing insurance under the
exchange or through Medicaid if
they're eligible is one of the
key ways that we know we can
decrease barriers access to
quality healthcare in the state
of New Mexico getting people
enrolled in health insurance is
a great way to make sure that
we're taking care of any kind of
illness they may have before it
becomes emergency an even higher
costs for the state of New
Mexico to take care of and for
those reasons are doctors in the
state of New Mexico really think
that this bill should move
forward we appreciate your
support today thank you so much
madam chair.
Thank you very much miss Brunner
Jeffery Bustamante.
Good morning committee members
and Jeffery Bustamante.
The exchange the exchange
supports this legislation for a
lot of the reasons that you've
already heard today you know in
addition to that this bill is
immensely helpful as we discuss
opportunities and novel
opportunities to support greater
communication between the
exchange New Mexicans to get
them connected to coverage also
most importantly.
Really our allies.
The remaining uninsured and help
expand coverage to all New
Mexico.
Thank you very much Mr
Bustamante Akon up pack.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is a compact and I'm
representing the league of women
voters of New Mexico the league
stands in strong support of this
bill our position is that every
New Mexican residents should
have a comprehensive level of
health care this bill would help
fill in the gaps and cover
people who don't have coverage
yet and haven't managed to
negotiate deliverance and sign
up process.
Thank you for considering this
bill Madam chairman members of
the committee.
Thank you very much miss pack
Andrew
My name is Andrew Baker and I'm
a registered lobbyist with
Health Action New Mexico as well
as a recent graduate of the UNM
college population health.
I'd like to thank the chairman
the committee for allowing me to
speak today.
Really excited to support house
bill two seventy two allowing
more New Mexicans to get low
cost high quality health
insurance echoes across the
health care system.
As Gabby said there's a
substantial portion of people
who came on to this bill in
Maryland who are younger so I
wanted to elaborate on how that
helps lower insurance costs for
everyone.
For me and my friends as young
people most of the reasons that
we go to the hospital or for
individual incidents and not
chronic conditions if one of us
gets into an accident breaks our
arm that's a huge cost insurance
can help pay that could be the
difference between eating Rahman
and working overtime for months
or saving that money and putting
in other parts of the economy.
So it makes sense for us to buy
insurance to cover those major
incidents that might pop up but
for everyone of us that's
cheaper to insure we're also
helping to lower the cost of
insurance for some higher risk
groups that are also buying
insurance the easy we make it
for people to get into the pool
the less it costs everyone else.
So while I've got my individual
complaints about the insurance
industry this bill offers a
common sense solution to help
improve the health of all New
Mexicans with the infrastructure
that we have now so when when
thank you.
Thank you very much all in eight
I ill I'm sure I mispronounce
that sorry Colin I know you very
well.
No worries madam chair thank you
very much.
Madam chair members the
committee it's this column by
with the office of the
superintendent of insurance we
do this legislation is one of
the most important insurance
related bills of the session as
you may know one of our top
schools as an agency is to get
as many people covered with high
quality health coverage as
possible and we know that more
than half of those who are
uninsured our state qualify for
some form of financial
assistance to reduce their costs
either through Medicaid or the
health insurance exchange and of
course having health insurance
not only provides access to care
but it also provides financial
protection for New Mexico's
families and as Mister Baker
noted before improving the risk
pool really has downstream
effects that that help everybody
that's purchasing coverage
through the market place and so
that's why we think it's so
important that we find new and
innovative ways to reach the
uninsured and this was noted
before many people simply just
don't know that they qualify for
coverage for I haven't been able
to connect with someone who can
find that consumers systems
really up to this point our
tools for reaching the uninsured
have been limited to doing
outreach and marketing which
will continue to be important
tools are in the toolbox but
this bill would give us another
tool to really meet people where
they are you know many people
are filing income taxes with the
state's because a required to or
because they're you know trying
to get the working families tax
creditors claim some other tax
credit and this will help them I
be identified and make that
enrollment process easier
getting them connected with
people who really know how to
how to walk them through that
process and so thank you has
been mentioned this bill allow
people to just voluntary check a
box on the tax form to notify
TRD and that they and others in
the householder uninsured and
that they're interested in
getting coverage this bill does
have a strong language on.
Making sure that the taxpayer
has to provide consent to the
Department in order for that
information to be shared with
the New Mexico health insurance
exchange and then the exchange
will provide that initial
assessment about eligibility
contact the individual about
their options and so we're
really glad to see this kind of
creative and forward looking
approach to a problem that's
difficult needs an urgent one
that we need to find more ways
to solve and so we really want
to thank the sponsored advocates
for bringing this bill forward
and hope that you will supported
today thank you.
Thank you very much Nicolas

Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Nicolas
court of a and I'm an attorney
at the New Mexico Center long
poverty with the center support
H. B. two seven two.
We believe that every mixing
should be able to access quality
affordable health care coverage
nice agency prepare alluded to
fifty seven thousand New
Mexicans were eligible for
Medicaid remain uninsured.
And fifty six thousand uninsured
mixes qualify for federal
premium assistance for a plan on
the exchange.
In many of these uninsured New
Mexicans are simply unaware that
they qualify for these programs
indeed over the past four years
the federal government cut
outreach efforts to educate
Americans about their
eligibility for these programs
by ninety percent.
And so H. B. two seven two is a
cost effective way for the state
to take an active role in
helping these New Mexicans get
the coverage they need and
deserve.
This bill is a win for everyone
more patients get access to
coverage providers get more
compensation for their services
the state brings in more federal
dollars that right now are being
left on the table thank you we
urge to pass.
Thank you very much abro Weber.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Barbara
Webber I'm the executive
director of Health Action New
Mexico when I started it Health
Action New Mexico eleven years
ago the uninsured rate in New
Mexico was one and for as we
elected to expand Medicaid to
adults the rate has dropped from
eleven percent to one in ten
that one in ten you're still a
lot of people and the pandemic
show this ways in the ways that
we had particularly maybe
thought about
So having that Lara still a
large group of people without
health insurance.
In New Mexico the study did at
again be related.
alluded to the earlier for New
Mexico it showed that forty
eight percent of those who
acquired COVID where people and
families without health coverage
forty eight percent almost half.
Furthermore.
Forty percent of those who had
comment from the disease who did
not have insurance died from the
disease this is a massive loss
of life that could have been
prevented if we had a totally
insured population.
We think this is an innovative
way to reach more people I going
to where they are tax form and
Bringing them into the system so
we urge your support of two
seventy two thank you.
Thank you ms Webber Tracy make
annual.

being able to deliver care to
the broad population you know we
we have a lot of great services
that are available but they're
being under utilized in really
enrollment is the key so this is
a strong supporter of this you
know it will also give us the
opportunity to continue to
diversify our our patient mixed
in quite frankly something like
this is absolutely necessary in
is the exact way that we need to
increase enrollment in the
public options on so we stand

Thank you Mr weeks Greenup
Klein.
Chair.
In many community members
committee members my name is
Greta Kline are working digital
media and Strickler action with
Health Action New Mexico as part
of my work I have interviewed
several community members about
their experiences and rolling in
Medicaid especially during my
interviews with you and I'm
students and as an undergraduate
student myself I have learned
the process for enrollment is
often very confusing for those
who have not navigated the
health insurance system before
additionally many students and
community members do not even
know that they meet the
requirements for coverage under
Medicaid or other private
options health insurance
coverage is critical for all New
Mexicans and community members
the house bill two from the two
of us setting up to be easier
and I urge all of you to support
this bill as it is a win for
everyone thank you madam chair.

a book Estrada on the coverage
innovation officer for the New
Mexico Human Services Department
we'd like to thank
representative Thompson for
bringing forward this bill the
department's stance is
officially neutral as the
increase of.
Folks in rolling Medicaid will
increase our budget however we
did lead the study on New
Mexico's uninsured with the
urban institute that has been
referenced a variety of times
this morning and as a department
we do want to ensure that every
New Mexican has access to health
care coverage as it is a
critical step in helping to
improve access to care we
believe that house bill two
seventy two is a good bill to
help ease access to coverage

our new insurers in New Mexico
over the last three or four
years and we stand in strong
support of this also as a
participant in the well and are
offering private insurance to
individuals and small groups the
more people that we can get out
there get covered by quality
insurance the better for our
state we know that one in three
people this is a national
average who had COVID had no
insurance coverage and quite
honestly that's unconscionable
so we strongly support this bill
