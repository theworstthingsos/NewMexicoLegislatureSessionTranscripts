Harper you do have a substitute
correct.
That's correct chairman.
should be in your Citrix.
And it is.
The two oh two number.
Is two two zero.
Two five five point three.
And I would move it for
discussion purposes.
All right hold on one second.
You said it's.
I repeat the number again.
Two two zero two five five point
three.
All right hold on a second I I
have the point two version here.
Log in here as well and we sent
it to the.
Committee.
R. red is is anyone else trying
to get this under Citrix if so
let me know when you find it.
Chairman I will
Transferred.
Thanks.
Representative Harper while out
while we get it on the Citrix do
you want to start going through
it maybe some of the high level
background history I'd be happy
to.
Yes who is that sorry Mr chair I
was just letting you know that I
do see that the three version as
and Citrix okay thank you.
Awesome thanks.
Right the third is.
Okay so so members if you recall
I wanted to.
Kind of doubts as to.
how are gross receipts tax kind
of came to the places that.
And.
This bill kind of did two things
to address some of the problems
the first was a manufacturing
equipped with action.
to not tax that business input.
and and look more like other
states which forty one of them
do not the others don't have a
sales tax.
The second saying that did was.
remove terminating.
On
some business to business
professional services so again
kind of the most egregious part
of our permitting aware of
business works with another
business performance service and
that especially hits small
business is hard.
Well
The if we did all of that the
cost to be pretty large I think
it was eighty eight million.
And really I was I think I
mentioned to this is kind of a
menu of options that we're
looking at what could we do
and and kind of the
a step by step.
you know we take piece of this
at out and leave other pieces so
working with our the chairman
and
and missed the committee.
Staff we selected to of the
eight items in this bill.
The manufacturing production and
the our anti permitting for
accounting and bookkeeping type
services.
And the reason we chose those
two.
Just because we wanted to pick
something that would affect all
small businesses.
across the state and also but he
was in kind of the capacity of
what this committee had this
year.
for for tax reform tax.
Type of bills.
And when you look at.
Manufacturing production.
like I mentioned earlier.
really are big businesses the
ones that can afford to get
Arby's there or not paying it
this would really help all of
your mom and pop small
businesses that you know don't
have a lawyer don't get an I. R.
B..
so there on eleven twelve a
playing field.
And then the other one
accounting we had like H. R. we
had engineering we had a
temporary services but there are
really two analysts that
impacted every single business
accounting.
And
I. T. information technology.
And information technology was
just too expensive it was like
twenty million dollars by
itself.
And so we decided we'll just
we'll go forward with yet the
accounting at this time but
every single small business.
You know just to keep track of
their expenses and go to an
accountant.
So those are the two that we
chose I really like to thank
secretary Schardin Clarke in her
department did a great job of
getting the fiscal and packed
report
giving us a score.
And and how great comments on
the bill and your.
but to
the bottom line is these
provisions go into effect
January first of twenty twenty
two.
And so for next year the total
impact of this bill will be
about seven point three million
dollars.
And then in FY twenty three
the full impact.
will occur because it won't just
be the first six months it'll be
before July to July and and then
it'll be a fifteen million
dollar.
Affects all right within our our
capacity so.
that's that's the brief
description of what it does
chairman.
Thank you Representative but is
there a motion to approve a the
committee substitute for
discussion purposes I I made a
motion out of the did you I
didn't catch it at each other
all right okay good
okay members of the committee.
Right I have a okay we have
Google has come up that's going
Representative Strickler.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
Representative Harper so it let
me get this straight so a small
business owner that has to
use a CPA.
you know account you know.
Has to use a bookkeeper
Services.
And maybe an administrative you
know assistant one nine and and
that particular business owner
pays gross receipts tax.
On on those outside services to
take care of that small
businesses tax accounting and
and this would get low relief.
So so I Chairman representative
Strickler that's that's right if
it's a small business.
Does not have an in house
accountant or bookkeeper.
and this is all defined in the
bill what what accounting
services means I don't think
it's administrative services but
its bookkeeping and accounting.
then they would not be charged
G. R. T. but also I'll just
mention for the the committee
because we're we're trying to be
very precise here will also very
clearly says that if this is for
an individual regardless of
where that individual as a
business owner.
It's still G. R. T. because we
want this just to be a business
to business transactions.
if if I goes individual to an
accountant to do my taxes
that'll still be G. R. T..
Thank you thank you
Mr chairman thank you thank you
gentlemen.
Thank you Representative
Strickler Representative role
metal.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Representative I'm I I did get a
lot of feedback on this for many
constituents just in the wonder
about how this makes us more
competitive as a state and in
particularly how this sort of
supports the entirety of our
infrastructure of tax we do
often hear that tax deductions
benefit business but we have the
data doesn't necessarily reflect
that we get any more business
because of it that businesses
are moving are producing anymore
because of this kind of
deduction so can you just
describe why manufacturers are
singled out here Mr speaker yeah
that's that's a great question
and and and all agree with you
that that the data is all over
the place when it comes to
whether
you know a targeted tax break
really helps right the but if
for question is one that
it is really hard to answer
right if we give a special break
to Facebook.
You know did they come here
because a special break for the
coming here anyway and we just
gave away money right we it's a
really tough question to answer.
but what we do know is where our
gross receipts tax is really
just a strangler on especially
small business is that it keeps
taxed the business inputs over
and over Representative talk
about that pyramid and you want
to go to page it the different
times at its tax and how that
can we to you know seventeen
percent effective tax.
So.
We're doing here.
Is over the years
we've taken care of permitting
in some sectors of our economy
why construction right now
there's almost no chairman again
and construction made a
concerted effort to take care of
that manufacturer you also may
fashion engineering of also done
a lot of.
Sure it our work over the last
several years to ensure that.
So manufacture equipment is
really kinda last step this
legislation is to take to check
the box for manufacturing.
And it also makes it so we're
less likely to need IRB's.
Which are kind of that weird
saying that we're kind of
fiction that we've put together.
so that that really does help.
to to lower the costs the
internal business costs
manufacture Sliq and more
competitive with other states
which don't have this same you
know that we don't tax
manufacturing equipment so our
businesses or do start off at
seven eight percent
disadvantage.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Representative I guess.
When we think about the
manufacturing industry in New
Mexico of course it's been
something that we wanted to grow
for decades I think in different
forms whether it be in the food
industry I guess I'm just also
sort of thinking about the the
universe of manufacturing in my
community you know lots and lots
of folks are very concerned
about the environment and so
with this I mean as far as just
thinking about the externalities
that are produced by different
forms of manufacturing you know
what what we possibly be giving
away and what we get came from
certain tax because I'm thinking
about pollution I'm thinking
about some of the additional
externalities that manufacture
certain types of manufacturing
may yield and and putting
everything under that umbrella.
Really gives a lot of hard
earned my constituents who are
very concerned about why would
we do that when we're already
not paying for some of the
damage that has been done Mr
chair representative so is there
any nuance there is far as what
we're what we're actually trying
to do here yeah of Mr chair
representative that's a an
excellent question very good and
I I didn't.
I did mention it here so I I was
hoping people's eyes were
getting glazed over as I was
explaining the bill
but we actually put in the
language here an exclusion
that manufacture equipment
that's used for natural
resources or hydrocarbon
processing are not included that
kind of language is really
replete through our tax code.
it would so
I think the speaker mentioned
that's a you know his his wife
has a food business and they
just bought a sterilizer.
And and they did that through an
I RB.
with Santa Fe
but that would qualify for for
this manufacturing conduction so
you can have food seems like
that qualify.
I'm and this does not sing
to affect our current.
Rules when it comes to you know
clean air and water permitting
in those kinds of things that
really address the pollution.
and try to put put a handle on
those things we have we have
those safeguards in place we're
not touching those with this
bill.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Representative then just
thinking about some of the
incidents of how this would work
in practice you know we do
already have and T. T. C. forms
with investment credits that we
have through that process in
order not to double tax how does
this work with the NTC process
yeah that's that's another great
question
chair and representative I'm I'm
impressed thank you
so so this would require.
I just actually I'm in the bill
we put a provision in here that
would not allow a double debt.
If they're using this provision
so I didn't want to do anything
with the current you know
someone gets an I RB and the
qualify for investment tax
credit that doubled up.
K. that we we re we renew that
for ten years last year if you
want to come back and revisit
that that's just fine.
but if someone takes venture
this new manufacturing
production we put language in
here saying they could not also
then qualify for the best tax
credit so you can't double dip
if you take measure this new
ones here some try to what way
the groundwork.
No for the future that we have
some good tax policy.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Representative that that's
helpful I I do have a few
concerns are looking forward to
the continued discussion I do
hope this helps bring in more B.
to be professionals the the
they need an opportunity is
absolutely that how to make
business run more effectively it
is the accountants it is the
careers it's the suppliers all
of that in between work that we
are lacking a lot of like you
said I do it secretary of this
to that's not included because
we do want to try to figure
those things out but I'm also
just worried that it might
create more of an independent
contractor relationship versus
hiring I'm I'm so I'm trying to
wrestle with some of the the new
wants with how business would
want to tap into this but then
looking at equity and and and
some of the other principles
that we have here and just
because of the concerns that we
did it for my community so I
look forward to the you can
please comment if you if you.
Yeah yes thank you Chairman
representative again great
comment and I saw that in the
FIR that there was a comments
that perhaps this will encourage
businesses to shed their in
house.
and contract out and and I
thought about that and I.
And I will say that that might
not be an outcome but yes I'm a
business owner and I have a in
house account that knows my
business and knows how it works.
I don't think I'm gonna save a
lot of liking that person out
and saving space on saving money
on space and budget versus now
trying to work with to an
outside account most honest not
intimately aware of.
My work.
I have to get them up to speed
and and make sure they
understand you know my nuances
so.
Possibly happen yes but.
I think that's probably not very
likely.
Yeah I agree I know that a lot
of business owners here already
outsource a lot of that and if
they have an in house they've
already made room for it so I'm
not too concerned about that I'm
just trying to think of you know
the different sort of elements
of of what folks might be
tapping into and then just
thinking about the equity piece
I think more than anything on
singling out you know this this
component because it fits well
with our fiscal opportunity this
year but not and and I and you
know how to prioritize that so I
look forward to the continued
discussion I appreciate you
bringing four thank you Mr chair
thank you Representative.
Thank you thank thank you
Representative next we have vice
chair Chandler.
Thank you very much Mr chair and
thank you Representative Harper
for bringing this bill forward I
just want to understand a little
bit better and about how one
To find a business that is
entitled to this so let me give
you an example Mr chair and
representative
I'm Chris Chandler doing
business as Piggly wiggly I'm
selling food groceries and but
I'm not incorporated and a DBA
doing business as Piggly wiggly
can I take advantage of this
provision.
Our great great question Mr
chair and vice chair.
We we gave a lot of thought to
how do we define it's and what
we have in here is essentially
up to part yes and it's not a
one or two it's a one and two.
And it's on page eleven the bill
the test says the sale is made
to a business that has a New
Mexico tax ID number or an
equivalent in another state.
So first off it has to be a
business that is registered and
has an identification number you
can't just be.
I'm I'm I'm I'm Harper
enterprises you know don't
charge me tax right now I have
to be registered with the state
now tax identification.
the second is that the purchaser
has to present a nontaxable
transaction certificate.
And this is really a big
protection.
in in our statutes.
These are mistreated our
administered by the department
and
only given by that part I just
again as hardware prices I can't
just go out and make my own into
to see.
Right so to get centers receive
you have to show that you are
qualified are you are you are a
business and it says in there
that language that if you are a
business going for this business
to business transactions then
you are qualified to use a study
to see.
And there's also an audit
process right that if.
perforator prize gets audited.
or or my account gets audited.
for these transactions we have
to show the entity sees or
alternative evidence that we met
the requirements to to see.
So
those are I think those are very
good protections and and again
it's you have to folks.
So thanks for that answer Mr
chair and Representative just as
a follow up so Chris Chandler
doing business as Piggly wiggly
what I qualify for New Mexico
tax ID number.
Not my social not using my
social what I qualify as a tax
ID for a tax ID number yeah so
so Mr chair and Representative
Chandler
we're just just in full
disclosure are getting into the
area where I'm not you know the
PAC expert
but I know there is a process
that you have to go through to
register with the state to have
a business and receive federal
Romero nodding your head I know
she does this area much better
than I do perhaps
Mr chair I ask Representative
Romero to talk about that
process yes.
Thank you Mr chair
representative and
representative yes so if you
have a if you want to do
business in the state you must
apply for a tax ID number.
Yes the IRS code and in order to
be able to pay your G. R. T. so
you as soon as you want to be
able to do that and.
And it's argumentative are you
know there's argument as to who
and at what point and you know
everybody worries but if you are
getting income in any sort of
form you must have a tax ID and
it's it's a very simple process
but you do need your you know
information is tied to your
either your social or your E. I
and number.
Thank you Mr Chairman
representative and
representative for those answers
can I just ask you a follow up
Representative Harper and and Mr
chair again other follow up.
So this year we're doing
accounting services and next
year are we going to be doing
lawn services and next year the
following year Mr chair a lawyer
services and the year after that
Mr chair cleaning services
when what what's your long term
plan your ideas for that Mr
Chairman representative
Chairman representative vice
chair that is a really a
question I'm so glad you asked
that again one of the things I
wanted to mention in the
introduction but they want
people's eyes to glaze over.
So.
we could say our goal is to
remove all chairman.
Right and I'd be a great W.
laudable goal that be great
right and then we really know
just taxing and inflict.
But that's that's not the goal
here the goal the goal here is
to
remove the most egregious forms
that make us look weird that
make us look different that make
us be uncompetitive.
Not removal Committee because
there are states that do care of
it actually every state
tournaments
the simple I like to use is a
but like office equipment.
we tax computers we tax yes
right that's clearly a business
employee.
But so does every other state.
So why would it why would we do
that New Mexico
when every other state taxes at
right we're just trying to we're
trying not to be the outlook on
things.
And so those are seven.
Permitting items that we haven't
Original Bill the kind of menu.
Those are the ones that we
selected very.
deliberately it was Richard
ankle Helen hacked you know
Janet peacock you know the
experts Jim o'neill those are
the ones that we selected New
Mexico really stands out most of
the ones we want to fix.
so so those you know I to
directly answer a question in
the future I think we should
come back and look at
information technology services
we should look at legal we
should look at those that were
in that west.
but then that's.
That's that's that's where we
would now not be an outline and
so it would be up to this this
committee though to push back on
people that come and say we
shouldn't pass computers you
shouldn't taxed yes you should
taxed cleaning services we just
say thank you but other states
do and and and we're gonna
continue as well.
And the so I I do agree there's
there's the slippery slope
argument but we are very
deliberate here and and I think
we have the will to push back on
in other states.
Okay okay Mister chair and
Representative so I think what I
heard you state is yes the plan
is to come back for a sweep in
some of these other services
that you have identified
originally.
A week or so ago okay thank you
very much Mr chairman thank you
Representative.
Thank you great questions.
Yes.
Representative Maestas you are
next on the list.
Going once going twice.
All right we'll we'll come back
to semi says anyone else with
I'm here.
Okay good Representative no of
policies I it with your
permission Mr chairman of.
Just be a voice is so I can read
the things on my device read the
up the sub Mr Chairman
representative are pretty are we
looking at we're looking at two
fifty five point two correct the
the little number on the left
hand corner of the document.
Mr Chairman representative my
apologies it's point three I see
I see okay that's fine that's
fine it it shouldn't be too I
think I could get my point
across.
Appreciate what you said just
now because that the the
argument of care meeting has not
been persuasive to me
to me every single transaction
should be taxed equal to the
next and that's just life if a
particular.
You know widget so to speak is
is is passed on.
But I am persuaded with regards
to our surrounding states we we
we have an economic reality we
live in a highly competitive
world and and businesses are so
large you have so much power
that.
Have the ability to not
necessarily pit states against
one another but to just make
investment decisions based on
what different states are doing
site.
I agree with you when and not
being an out liar.
and so so I thank you for
coming.
We're coming through with this
language because I'm reading I'm
reading the ten page bill and
it.
And it kind of reads six one
half dozen a dozen of the other
but it's but it doesn't it does
it does certain things so if you
can explain to me on on page
three.
What we do Mr Chairman
representative herbal we we
change the definition of
manufacturing and then we create
a definition of manufacturing
services.
I'm glad you mentioned the
leadership attacks and
Representative because I'm sure
they were key in developing this
language but.
Are you confident that this
language up.
Captures what we want to capture
and isn't too broad that it just
captures those manufacturing.
Yes Representative components
yes so so chairman and the
person I just this
great question and again I.
I would love to dive into this
in the in trouble not trying to
glaze eyes over so in our
statutes we currently to provide
manufacturing in three different
places.
And they really did not
Our job I well with each other.
And so as part of this bill
we're kind of doing a little bit
cleanup
so on page three you'll see like
you mentioned.
We we clarify the manufacturing.
Does not include like electric
power generation crossing
natural resources hydrocarbons.
And meals for immediate
consumption.
And we also had a manufacturing
service.
which is the service of doing
these things.
And if you work with a.
This page eight.
Are yes starts on page seven and
goes to page eight you see or or
actually striking here the
definition
That was put in kind of a
manufacturing consumable Mrs
well as areas where it's kind of
conflicting and we're here to
say I'm a fashion consumable to
manufacture manufacturer service
provider can be deducted
so so again some some cleanup
here but.
Session we're doing making sure
that we're we have this to
provide our statutes in three
different places they now jive
together are consistent with
each other.
And yeah working was all the tax
screws
yeah this languages and look out
for for several years so I'm I'm
I'm confident we've got it right
thank you know I see Mr thank
you so to chapter one is just a
really good clean up.
Section one rather section two
on the bottom of page seven.
Page eight is is kind of the
crux of the bill would you say.
That's that's correct it's a
little more clean up and then
that's the manufacturing
equipment deduction okay thank
you Mr rose harbor the
What's also persuasive to me is
the the large companies versus
the small companies in terms of
what can be in house or not
obviously if you're very large
jobs in house counsel but even a
medium sized firm company has.
Accountants and things that in
house as opposed to purchasing
accounting services and then
paying that G. R. T. does this
bill deal with that you
mentioned in your opening
comments.
Yeah chairman and Representative
that's that's exactly right the
the provisions of this bill are
really I'm not going to help
large businesses they might help
medium a little bit but it's
your small businesses that we
know that make up the backbone
of the economy and have been
struggling
during the pandemic that will
benefit from this bill and then
and that that that's a parent by
the fiscal impact right if this
was a big business bill the
first would be much higher rate.
I see thank you Mr chairman
Representative are just a quick
comment
You know the ability for for
multinational corporations and
and various economic interest to
go from state to state an
advocate for certain tax.
Tax breaks tax deductions is is
tremendous.
And so you reach that tipping
point you know where I don't
know if it's fifteen states
twenty states that maybe twenty
six states but we have forty one
states that do this and I think
it should have been done in the
first place but here we are you
know here we are trying to
compete you know.
On the shoulder of our sister
state Texas which is one of the
largest economies and the in the
country.
And other surrounding states
that are going faster than we
are and and you know dealt with
the Great Recession better than
we did.
But.
But I just want to make that
point I mean if.
Never done the first place in my
opinion I'm I'm glad that we
we're gonna prepare to hold the
line on desks and computers if
and when that wave hits but I
just want to draw the
committee's attention Mr
Chairman representative
Representative on on the point
two version top of page nine.
It's subsection do.
Subsection is great because it
says the department shall annual
report two revenue stabilization
and tax policy committee each
year and course revenue
stabilization tax policy is in
statute because it's it's in
statute it's it's.
It's literally a statutory
interim committee but paragraphs
do says the purpose of this of
the deductions find and this is
current law Mr chairman the
purpose of the deductions
provided in this section is to
encourage manufacturing
businesses to locate in New
Mexico.
And that's you know that's good
public policy manufacturing is
less than two percent of our
economy so my friends in the
Albuquerque business community
are just all about incentivizing
manufacturing you know if and
when manufacturing does return
to the to the great old US of a
I think we could capture.
Our fair share of it and and
more but this notion of tax
policy to to recruit businesses
tax policy as a means of
economic development should not
dominate our conversation should
not dominate the way we do
things and I believe it has in
the past ten years somewhat in
terms of public policy thinking
and and billing.
Amazon did come to the west of
Albuquerque because of IRB's
lead tax breaks they came
because there's gonna be a high
we built.
It came because we're in the
geographic center of the of the
mom Westwood with trains planes
cars you know because trains can
go from LA to have the city
without going through New Mexico
so I just want to make that
point as well that this is good
tax policy I'm gonna supported
you've been working hard on this
and I think you've captured you
practically if the bulls eye.
It's not very close to the bulls
eye on this on this issue and I
am.
Menu but we really just have to
get away from you know bringing
jobs as opposed to growing
existing jobs and keeping
existing entrepreneurs home.
Thank you Mr thank you
Representative Harper.
Thank you so much yes any other
questions or comments from
committee members.
Okay
Representative Harper thanks for
the work on this certainly I
think we we we appreciate your
willingness to.
You know to to tackle the big
thick tough issues and and
really you know to to having an
open mind.
as we you know as we look at
your bill and that your bill and
obviously I mean as as you said
right it's a menu options and
you know we we as a committee
have to be very diligent and
very disciplined and and looking
at those options.
Let me let me explain you know
for the for the public and and
members or committee sort of
where I'm at with this
you know I I think that
You know as we.
As as we have these broader
discussions about tax policy
reform and and you know I want
to be very clear that
and we're gonna see this with
the next election.
There's some very like this
differences in ideology when it
comes to this
and you know we what both sides
we're gonna have our our our
troops and and we're gonna have
our.
are believes read and what this
tax system.
how the tax system can influence
social policy right and we got
laid to two schools of thought
of that at least on this
committee.
when it comes to making are
COVID it just a little bit
better rate in and sort of
tinkering with it and and
bringing a little bit more
nuanced would I you know I I
think there's general agreement
that things need to be tinkered
with and things need to be
Addressed and I want to use
would fix because I don't want
to you know assume that
everything is broken and and and
and not working because clearly
it is working but I think that
things need to evolve and and
and the COVID is is is certainly
one of.
manufacturing so you know last
year there was a big push by the
executive a big push by business
groups big business groups to to
extend this and then factor
investment tax credit and this
committee actually in my opinion
voted to fix.
That bill is he came out of the
Senate.
particularly around the double
dipping right because you have
these big companies that get
nine RB don't pay the G. R. T.
on the equipment and then get
the value of that G. R. T. back
from the state.
and this applies to the biggest
of the companies these are not
the mom and pops in our
communities these are the big
big boys and B. girls.
For whatever reason once it got
back to the Senate the thank you
for that again and then we were
sort of at a time at that point
so
you know in my opinion
not very good tax policy
that are committee tried fix but
ultimately you know the the the
the Senate and and the set up
over there kind of do their
thing and and and we read that
time.
I view this manufacturing tax
deduction.
As as
Sort of as a logical next step
right how do we is that maybe
size too small size
manufacturing.
Venture.
and you know many factors we are
great like my grandparents they
both worked in a bustle at the
McKee last and they were like
stitching the back pocket of
Levi jeans for like forty years
I like to me that's
manufacturing.
Obviously that's most of them
effective that doesn't happen
anymore this country it's off
off shore.
but there are still
opportunities for manufacturing
that I think we can we can grab
onto case in point you know
cannabis.
There's a great deal of
manufacturing that happens in
the in the cannabis industry
right it's not just growing the
plant and then lighting it up
there's a whole lot of
manufacturing that potentially
can happen it happens with
medical cannabis already you
know that's value added
agriculture right you take the
plant in turn it into a cream
for pain and you slap another
ten Bucks to the price tag and
people buy it helps with the
pain.
you know that's one industry
that I'm really excited about
that I think and and these
companies are relatively small
compared to the inTaos of the
world.
there are other manufacturing
operations in the state that are
sort of a throwback to the
stitching example that I gave
earlier where you know you have
local spots for example.
Contracting with local
manufacturers to put together
their robes and their towels and
whatever else the use and all of
that goes to the business model
right if I'm going to a spot in
Santa Fe.
And I know that the roads in the
towels and whatever else they
have there is all locally
sourced including the
manufacturing.
I'm gonna go there right this is
something that's really cool
about that and I think that this
is this this
this this legislation in front
of us really goes to address and
and.
Make a case for those made to
small size appropriations to
also tap into the same type of
benefit that the big players tap
into I agree with Representative
Maestas this is not about.
You know attracting some outside
corporation to come in and set
up shop like I mean be cool if
they did but quite frankly
they'll probably get the R. B.
in double dip anyway
this is to me about you know the
small operation that could set
up shop in questa or in the
inside value Albuquerque or down
a job but I.
and allow folks to deduct the
the the the gross receipts tax
from that equipment that the
purchase to to make your
business run.
As far as accounting and you
know this is a place where I I
I'm gonna disagree with with
Representative Harper little bit
I I believe that you know it is
is I was going to my thought
process right and I'm thinking
of the small businesses in my
district.
Most of the small businesses are
not going to have an in house
account very few.
Some are gonna do their own
bookkeeping and they sort of
just.
You know get it done to save
themselves some money but most
of them are gonna be contracting
out to especially like was it
again it's tax season they're
gonna be contracting out to an
outside firm
As I look at the menu options
between that and I. T. I T. was
the other one that I was really
interested in but I tease is way
too expensive it was way outside
of the capacity but I can
imagine a lot a lot of
businesses particularly this day
and age are tapping those I. T.
services to get there you know
to get the drugs out
accounting though for me.
The price tag was comfortable
enough.
and the.
Widespread use of those services
I think really goes to the heart
of of why I'm supporting this
right and again that's thinking
of all the small and medium size
businesses that have to contract
out for this service.
and you know whether or not
know what whether or not as a
policy we want to.
Allow them to not have to pay
that now I get I get the I get
the push pull certain factors
here right I I agree with
illustrious traveler right
what's to stop all these other
professions Nixon from coming in
and saying Hey I deserve a I
deserve a.
I do serve the incentive to.
I can tell you is is as long as
I'm as as long as I'm chair this
committee you know to me.
I don't believe that that should
be the case not everybody's
legal services that everybody
uses engineering services that
everybody uses you know Tampa
Services which was something
else on the menu of options
accounting to me makes sense
because most everybody's gonna
use them at some point during
the tax year.
These other services you know I
I can't think of the last time a
local coffee shop have to use
legal services honestly I mean
probably not very often
engineering services probably
not very often.
if they ever do expanding have a
patio attached to their indoor
coffee shop they might have to
hire the architect for that
that's going to be like a one
and done accounting and
bookkeeping I.
Safely assume the use all the
time.
and so to me if we're gonna take
one of those business to
business transactions out.
This is
You know
I I I I cannot say that this
should be a blank check for the
others to come in and say well
wait a minute she does that the
accounts.
I just don't see.
a good policy reason for doing
so
so with that thank you
Representative Harper for for
working with us and and and our
team to you know pare this down
to a place where to me make
sense.
and for your willingness to work
with us we really appreciate it
is there anyone else before we
go to able.
All right all right what is one
of the you.
Would you pass.
We have to pass a motion from
Representative Montoya is that
how it was.
Yes Sir.
Okay there is.
And second by land this so the
motion is a I would alternatives
that.
Although that's under most.
Go ahead no thank you Mister you
you you stated what was gonna be
my alternative motion.
Got it so the motion should be a
do not pass on house bill two
seventy eight.
and they do pass motion on house
taxation and revenue committee
substitute for house bill two
seventy eight.
That's what I thought I said
this second.
And seconded

Chairman Martinez yes.
Representative twelve in the
affirmative they're on the
negative cable level twelve zero
you have to pass reserve Harper
Representative Chandler to
explain her vote
thank you very much Mr chair I
really struggled with how I was
going to vote on on this
particular item because I really
concerned about
the trickle effect and so we can
trickle just out so every fiscal
impact doesn't appear all that
significant and I will be very
reluctant Mr chair in the future
to be looking at these and I
also think Mr chair that it's
incumbent on folks who are
getting our offering what
amounts to a tax expenditure.
You were revenues coming in the
state
there should be an obligation on
that person to
propose a way to make up those
residents and I did not see that
in this bill and should future
bills come down the line we
looking very carefully for those
kinds of things thank you very
much Mr chair.
Thank you last year we
appreciate that
Graduations let's move on to
House Bill to ninety one.
But you're Chandler you take
over the chair.
Wait before you do that I'm
sorry before you do that one
remind everybody there's an
interpretation but on the
bottom.
M. but those laws gonna suck
when buying an additional
million up but I laughed placed
I I to be those knowing that you
know.
A moment at the net only
interpret them a similar Daniel
EAP ways and what bonding good
practices that give a whole this
but they yeah they they soon.
A lot.
Representative Chandler by had
like it buy a model number is
Representative Chandler will be
the one calling for public
comment.
Let's see what else before
before I hand over the chair
yes committee members for the
sake of interpreter please if
you can try to try to speak
slowly I mean you know trying to
speak too fast it makes it
harder an interpreter so just
just be mindful that if you can
appreciate it
Lester Chandler.
Thank you very much Mr chair we
are now on house bill two ninety
one I believe the Mr chair you
may have a committee substitute
is that right.
I do madam chair and that
committee substitute is in
Citrix and it is the one eight
six point four version.
Okay very good I I Mister chair
I do see that in Citrix.
And and madam chair if we can
allow in
I have a I have an expert
Representative I have an expert
I was gonna say representative
amber Wallin but she's
Representative as a
representative of the New Mexico
voices and so I'd like to
promote her to panelists.
Your grades and then I believe
Representative Matthew McQueen
who is one of our cool Sanchez
is also going to be joining us
I do not see him.
On our list there was texting me
earlier Mr chair with charming
little comments so.
I'm I'm ready when you are
committee.
All right and it has ms well and
and I see Representative McQueen
and I'm assuming ms wall and as
been allowed in as well proceed
Mr chair with an explanation of
your I just summon wish to
Move for discussion the
committee sub.
Their second thank you.
Okay Mr chair proceed.
All right.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee House
Bill to ninety one this
substitute for House Bill to
ninety one is the continuation
of you know more than more than
two years I think
of tax reform.
in in our legislature I'd like
to my the body of the the good
work that we all did with house
bill six years ago at chairman
Jim Trujillo carried that that
bill to the finish line that was
an important and much needed
reform of the tax system one
that had been many years in the
making.
Let me let me direct the
attention of the committee to
Valentine's day two thousand
three.
Then democratic governor with
the democratic legislature
told the people in New Mexico
that they were delivering the
biggest tax the the the biggest.
Valentine's day here.
they'd ever seen and it was a
tax cut
quite a large tax cut we took
our top income tax rates and
essentially created a flat
income tax rate
Guiding over five hundred
million dollars out of our
general fund I also would like
to remind the committee that
that same legislative session.
Are you asking Legislature were
entry to tap into the land grant
permanent fund and so you know
one folks have asked what that
what did we get for tapping the
land grant permanent fund in two
thousand three well we got a
legal tax cut.
Little is known about the
positive impacts of that massive
tax.
Quite frankly yeah I think we
would be hard pressed to find
too much benefits of the state
or the people of New Mexico and
in fact I think what it did is
it really just put added
pressure on our general fund and
on the entire system
Unfortunately over the last
several years I think
Republicans and Democrats have
agreed that reform is needed in
their tax code.
and so this bill in front of you
is the continuation of that
work.
and chairman of the committee
the bill in front of you does
five things.
Number one it provides tax
benefits.
Tax relief.
For working people across the
state.
The bill.
Increases.
the low income comprehensive tax
rebate.
In it and yes and and it
provides for an adjustment to
keep up with the cost of living.
moving forward.
As a reminder.
The lowincome comprehensive tax
rebate is claimed by one in
every five tax filers this is
crucial support from families
who need it the most.
Something that is not really
well known doctor Lichter though
is that low income seniors over
the age of sixty five.
Actually get to additional
exemptions and receiving higher
amounts of the rebate because of
their age this is important
because for the last two
sessions we've heard a lot about
exempting social security
benefits from income tax I'd
like to remind the committee
that.
Sorcery benefits are exempted I
believe up to about twenty five
thousand dollars a year I'm not
mistaken I mean it is only above
that that a percentage of that
benefit is taxed
Lichter I think is a much better
way to support those low income
seniors and put more money in
their pocket.
Lichter in its inception was
really designed to offset the
great red receiving your prose
receipts tax.
What's the it has not been
updated since nineteen ninety
eight and while those rebates
have remained flat the the G. R.
T. rates as we all know have
only increased since that.
Section two of this bill
increases elector to account for
that rising cost of living.
Increases the level at which
residents can qualify predictor
right now that that Nimet is
twenty two thousand dollars this
would raise thirty seven
thousand dollars and madam chair
this is all taken from your bill
actually the bill that you
presented to this committee a
few weeks ago and that we had
some pre table so all the good
questions that come my way
elector I'm gonna pass along to
you chair.
The other thing this bill does
is that it increases the working
families tax credit from
seventeen percent.
Twenty percent if you'll recall
in two thousand nineteen
legislative session we.
Our house of representatives
Passed a increase from ten
percent to twenty percent and
then in negotiations with the
Senate was brought down to
seventeen percent.
Working families tax credit he
backs off the federal earned
income tax credit the budget
wanted for New Mexicans
including fourteen thousand of
veteran families in New Mexico.
ninety seven percent of these
benefits and I'm going to
families with children at home.
the earned income tax credit is
actually a Republican concept
and although many.
Many people think it was Ronald
Reagan who who brought this at
the national level is actually
president Ford.
but it is one of the best
tax policies one of the most
efficient and impactful tax
policies and and our is our
version of it you're at the
statement and said he backs off
of that federal one.
the bill as I said increases the
Reddit from seventeen twenty
percent but it also does two
very important things.
In order to qualify for working
families tax credit because of
the way the federal credit is
set up you have to file your
taxes with the social security
number.
that is a problem for a lot of
MC Mexico there are many fans
New Mexico we don't file their
taxes with the social security
number instead of the news an
individual taxpayer ID number
these are families who work for
a living these are families who
are filing their taxes are
families were paying their taxes
many of these families have
young children at home and yet
they cannot claim the credit
this legislation would allow
those families to be able to
claim New Mexico's version of
the credit with in nineteen and
not require social security
number.
Lastly
the working families tax credit
would be would end the exclusion
for young workers without
children ages eighteen to twenty
four currently.
The way it works is unless you
have children you have to be
twenty five year old years old
from secret credits and again
that's because this be backing
off of federal credit.
We have a lot of young people in
New Mexico particularly those
that are aging out of foster
care system it'll be what
happens is you know those those
young workers you know they they
they could be twenty two and
three years old working not have
children they're not going to
qualify this would allow them to
qualify for the working families
tax credit.
Now the big question is how do
we pay for needs to increases
of tax relief for working
families and low income families
New Mexico well I'm proposing we
are proposing to this bill
the creation of three new income
tax brackets.
One would be five and a half
percent the other one would be
six point two percent in the
third will be six point five
percent.
To give you a sense of where
these rates fall for a single
individual
for somebody filing single they
would be that would be at the
five point five percent tax rate
if they are making between a
hundred and thirty five thousand
two hundred and ten thousand
dollars
for married couples filing joint
returns the five and a half
percent tax rate would apply to
incomes from two hundred
thousand three hundred fifteen
thousand.
The six point two rate would
apply to single earners make
between two hundred eighty four
hundred fifteen thousand and
married couples filing jointly
between four hundred fifteen
thousand six hundred twenty two
thousand
we are proposing the creation of
a new top rate of six and a
half.
Which would be an increase from
the top right that is five point
nine at this point any would
apply to single earners making
more than four hundred and
fifteen thousand and married
couples filing jointly over six
hundred and twenty two thousand
dollars still much much less
than the pre Richard St top tax
rate which was eight point two
percent
prior to two thousand three.
The.
Thought process behind these new
brackets is two fold number one
you know it has been widely
reported that people in the top
income brackets income levels
are have been just fine here in
this pandemic income once work
wise many of us have been
allowed to work from home to
telecommute we haven't had to
visit work and we're we're just
fine.
The folks we intend to benefit
from that during working
families tax credit these are
the essential workers in many
cases or the workers who working
ninety central blue collar jobs
that have been laid off because
there's no work for them.
So in a way we're asking for
those of us who can afford to
pay a little bit more and again
this is a little bit more we're
not tripling or don't even
doubling your income tax rate
we're asking you to pay a little
bit more in order to help
support
in order to help.
The those working families that
that are not doing as well as as
most of us might be.
I also want to add that with
regard to to
to income tax return New Mexico
unit the one we argue as might
be that business owners might
fall within the state two
hundred thousand three hundred
fifteen thousand a year bracket
well keep in mind right this
goes into effect in January of
twenty twenty two
if the twenty twenty if the
twenty twenty one tax year is
bad for you as a business owner
because this pandemic maybe is
not under control yet you're not
going to be earning that much
money right.
So you're not going to be paying
that tax that tax rate in in in
all in all reality right
I think if you look at the next
year or two who's gonna be
making of course going to be
paying at those rates it's going
to be the people again who are
probably telecommuting and whose
jobs are just fine and their
incomes are just fine for small
business owners this probably
will really kick in until
they're back on all eight
cylinders and and hopefully that
sooner rather than later but
that's something to think about
as we as we as we.
The other way in which we
propose that we pay for these
tax relief measures is by.
Taking a look at our capital
gains the Dutch.
And we're proposing.
Is that we limit.
The twenty percent deduction
that is in the books right now.
Only on the sale of a business.
up to a certain amount million
dollars.
As we were looking at repealing
the capital gains deduction we
were being very mindful of you
know somebody.
Opening up mechanic shop in our
repair shop twenty years ago.
and working hard in building a
business and then selling it.
We were trying to ensure that
that family is not penalized for
by these induction and so we
allow for that forty percent
capital gains deductions remain
for those specific examples for
everyone else we are proposing
the repeal
this would bring to the state
over forty million dollars a
year that we can use to help
offset the cost of increasing
working families tax credit and
low income comprehensive tax
rebate.
Finally section five of the
bill.
section five of the bill of the
substantive front of you would
limit the three percent property
tax.
Cap on owner occupied residences
and and Representative McQueen
has been diligently working on
this issue for many years and so
we brought him on board to help
us I sure that you with this
bill and hopefully the
legislature so he'll he'll be
he'll be here joining us for
questions on on the intricacies
of of that piece of the bill but
what we're trying to do is
really capture that tax
liability of folks who might
have the second or third home in
Albuquerque here in Santa Fe and
you know they come here be
creation during the winter maybe
and their tax rate is in the
property tax rate is capped at
three percent the same way that
it's cap for the lower income
senior living right next to that
person
I think it's really inequity
issue and it's to ensure that we
protect those those lower income
folks who live in their home and
and you know we want to protect
them from the property tax going
up.
Too high too fast but we don't
want we there's no need to
extend that same benefits to
somebody who again has the
second or third home in Santa Fe
I think we can afford to pay
you know the the the property
tax as as is now.
In terms of the differences
between two ninety one on the
website and the substitute
overview the tax rates the
income tax brackets have change
we had originally to and we have
three are the property tax
section tools probably about
half a dozen times between the
time we wrote the original bill
in this up there are different
factors playing in we're trying
to figure out exactly how to
frame it the third piece was
section five of the original
bill where we were providing for
the corporate income tax single
sales factor framework but
they're way too many questions
coming in from LFC and TRD that
we weren't able to answer and so
I'm at this point we decided to
pull that section out we re
wrote the property tax section
and we added eight their income
tax brackets those are the three
main differences in the
subsequent primary.
With that and chair and members
the committee I'd like to have
ms and Waller from New Mexico
voices C. G. as in the opening
remarks and Representative
McQueen if he has any opening
remarks.
And then we will be open for
questions thank you very much ms
Walland proceed.
Good morning madam chair good
morning members of the committee
good to see you all this morning
and I'll make my remarks just
very brief and then we're gonna
be pressed on time a lot of good
discussion state I'm sure but
just want to say that we are
completely on board with house
bill two ninety one we think it
is just really key for
diversifying revenue in our
state for ensuring we can help
us get off a bit of the revenue
roller coaster of oil and gas
and we also know that it really
goes a long way towards
improving equity and fairness in
our tax code it's going to lift
thousands of New Mexico families
out of poverty and provide
relief for those who need it
right now and we're strong
support and I'm happy to answer
any questions and support the
chairs well thank you.
Thank you very much miss well
enough Representative McQueen.
Thank you madam chair us
pleasure to be here I just like
to add.
Two percent more chairman
Martinez's presentation I would
note that we were talking about
lifting the cap on non owner
occupied primary residence
properties we're talking about
is letting them go back to the
current and correct valley so
we're not talking about raising
people's taxes from the
viewpoint of the taxing them
higher than we would normally
tax and that the point here is
that we decide we want to
protect the people living in
their primary residence it we're
trying to keep that protection
in the bill Wall allowing
investment properties and second
homes and things like that to
actually be taxed at the current
and correct.
Thank you.
Yes I see that thank you very
much Mr chair would you get any
concluding are any additional
comments before I go to the
public.
No madam chair
please go to the public well
actually there there might be
I'm I have I have Hamre from our
team that there might be a typo
on on page eleven that will
hopefully we can address during
the committee
but I please proceed with with
public comment.
Right thank thank you very much
we are going to be running a
timer everyone will be asked to
limit their comments to a minute
and thirty seconds and I will
interrupt if if you do go over
the time I'd like to first hear
from anyone who opposes the bill
so if your hand is up because
you support the bill please put
it down.
Anyone who opposes the bill
okay.
There's are translating services
are they working.
Yes madam chair great okay so
right now we are on opposition
to the bill flora Mendoza.
Miss Mendoza are you opposing
the bill.
Miss Mendoza.
All right I'll go on to the next
person ms Gallup are you
opposing the bill.
Steven I am.
In opposition.
Yeah.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is Steven I
and CEO of the New Mexico
association of realtors and not
we have an issue with the
property tax provision of the
law House Bill law the two
ninety one
or its owner occupied only we
have a lot of.
Areas where people do have
second homes but also of parents
end up by and their houses for
their kids in certain areas and
we're actually having a scene
were kids by.
How's this for their parents and
now why should these people be
penalized so we would stand in
opposition to house bill two
ninety one on the particularly
the property tax component thank
you.
Great let me see
Randy trainer Mr trainer.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee Randy trainer
representing the apartment
association of New Mexico I have
not seen this but I believe my
comments are still valid I want
to address the property tax
portion of this far reaching
legislation the effect of the
property tax changes will be
significant upon housing
specifically affordable housing
House Bill to ninety one is for
you at a time it is just it is
widely accepted we have a
homelessness and housing crisis.
I'm not referring to the blue
you were or larger multi family
complexes those properties are
functionally not impacted
they are newer intend to change
ownership were forty three.
Therefore are valued at work
currently correct values.
What is impacted or the smaller
lower income rental properties
which are essential for those
struggling to locate in four
houses.
These properties are the front
frontline in a dressing
homelessness and affordability.
People of lower income and those
less fortunate will carry the
burden of section five of house
bill two ninety one thank you.
Thank you very much Mr trainer
JD Bullington please.
Thank you madam chair members
the committee this is JD
Bullington speaking on behalf of
the greater Albuquerque chamber
of commerce we have also not
seen the substitute bill so all
limit my comments to what was
outlined by the bill sponsor
specifically want to address the
proposed increases and personal
personal income tax as has been
noted our small businesses in
the state do pay taxes based on
the personal income tax rate
because they file as sole
proprietors or single entity
has to L. L. C. and what makes
this approach questionable at
this time is that our state is
not in a dire fiscal position
raising taxes right now in any
capacity is just unnecessary and
our state economists have stated
repeatedly they expect the
economy to recover fairly
quickly starting as early as
this summer and that
automatically means more state
revenue for the purpose in this
bill that the sponsor is
specifically addressing to
enhance so the best way to
strengthen the state revenue
basis to diversify the economy
in the best way to diversify the
economy is to make the state as
competitive as possible for new
jobs new investment new
businesses and new industries
that's what meaningful tax
reform should do thank you.
Thank you very much Mr
Billington I see John Garcia.
Madam chair and members the
committee my name is John Garcia
executive vice president of the
home builders association of
central New Mexico
Our concern is with section by
the owner occupied or excuse me
owner occupied in putting the
tax on those that can afford it
just we don't want to discourage
people from coming here
especially retirees were second
home owners that the.
Their discretionary spending
would more than offset and
contribute to the to the economy
rather than and you know
unlimited tax or or at least an
expanded tax on on their
property we stand opposed madam
chair thank you.
Thank you very much Mr Garcia
Jason Espinoza.
Madam chair members the
committee Jason Espinoza state
director with the national
federation of independent
business and we are concerned
about the personal income tax
rate increases as business in
stated before and also put some
numbers to it eighty five
percent of small employers
defined as having more than a
hundred thousand in annual gross
receipts but less than fifty
million are structured as pass
through entities so they pay
taxes on the business side
income at the individual rate
not the corporate tax rate
additionally one of the things
that this pandemic has really
taught small business owners is
the need to have a larger
reserves in order to whether
unexpected events however this
last legislation actually
disincentive ISIS that because
it would tax.
The business owners for saving
those monies and creating larger
reserves at the higher rates
because of the of the tax
structure that would mean less
money less dollars for small
business owners to re invest in
their business whether would be
and through increased wages
expanding their business.
The new jobs which would not
only be detrimental that small
business but the entire economy
Mexico thank you madam chair.
Thank you very much Mr Espinoza
ms Carla Sonntag.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee I'm car less
contact the president of the New
Mexico business coalition we
oppose house bill two ninety one
for a most of the reasons
already stated we have some
other concerns as well one is
that when you are looking at
owner occupied premises you're
getting into rental properties
that may be inhabited by lower
income people.
If you raise these taxes that's
going to affect the very people
that you are saying that you
want to help it's going to cause
housing to go up for them and
make it even more unaffordable
and we just don't think that is
a good move for New Mexico we
have a lot of people that fall
into that area that need help
and not further increase costs
the other thing is I just
reviewed a report from our man
line that is.
Related to people leaving the
state.
One of our biggest outlook
people right now is income
levels over a hundred thousand
dollars that is also taking with
it the small businesses as we've
already discussed with the
passed through so you're gonna
have a smaller net you're going
to drive more people out of the
state and we just think this is
wrong direction to go thank you
for your consideration.
Thank you very much miss Sonntag
I think that's those are all the
attendees who are in opposition
is put your hand up if you are
in support of these this.
Legislation great I see some
names.
All right annual were once
please.
Hi thank you and you pronounce
my name correctly which is
really Representative my name's
Daniel were what they were gonna
for table housing basically
Santa Fe all over the state.
I
why do have reservations about
the impact on the rental housing
component of this all in all you
know we're essentially
subsidizing the property tax of
wealthy second home owners who
strongly destabilize our economy
we've heard excuses that it'll
keep people from moving here
it'll hurt people who buy houses
for their children
second homes there about their
little over ten thousand second
homes in the Santa Fe market
it's probably the single largest
contributor to negative housing
affordability
subsidizing these taxes also
hurts the local community
because we Fund list of our
services with G. R. T. and
despite the long held trope that
rich people with second homes
spend lots of money if you're
not here you're not spending
money and we're forcing workers
out of the community this has a
huge impact on local funding and
this is a loophole we need to
close and have needed to for a
long time so I hope that we will
work through the difficulties
but stop protecting the housing
secure in the people who
destabilize our local housing
market thank you.
Thank you Mr Stewart was
Tim Davis.
Thank you madam chair this is
Tim Davis with the New Mexico
Center on poverty we must seek
stable sources of revenue that

family tax credit would be
available and it's important for
all for working families it is
important to include families

their taxes not just those with
social security numbers the low
income tax rebate is finally
being updated after twenty years
seven it more reflects what
property is in New Mexico you
finally adding the tax records
for the wealthiest whether it be
to block out the property taxes
or that tax structure on that on
the New Mexico income tax is an
important way to pay for these
changes so please go to pass for
house bill two ninety one and
help those that are most
valuable in our state thank you
very much madam chair committee.
Thank you Karluk crew Hafer.
Your name correctly was perfect
thank you madam chair Mister
chair members of the committee
my name is Carla creating hope
for with the center for civic
policy and we sentence support
of H. B. two ninety one we fully
commend the approach of this
bill we believe that raising we
we agree with raising revenue by
including over two categories
for high earners we believe that
this approach is connected to
the diversification of our
economy and benefits are working
families additionally we commend
the improvements to the working
family tax credit in elector and
we think the sponsor and we are
tied to pass thank you.
Thank you very much tools for a
net cash and I apologize if I
mispronounce your name.
Good morning madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Secora Nefish and I am the
registered lobbyist for New
Mexico thrives the state
nonprofit association New Mexico
thrive supports H. B. two ninety
one.
Because it will left thousands
of New Mexicans out of poverty
and move them toward
selfsufficiency thank you.
Thank you very much of Bill
Jordan.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee of Bill
Jordan with New Mexico voices
for children I really want to
thank the members of the
committee for your thoughtful
work this session to craft what
we believe is a really
transformational tax bill It
dresses racial equity it makes
our tax code more fair and it
begins to raise revenue in a way
that will help us diversify our
revenue sources is essential
that we begin to diversify
revenue now before we hit the
next economic crisis this bill
will not only help struggling
families with children but the
updating of elector also helps
our retirees and seniors by
targeting those most in need the
expansion of eligibility for the
working families tax credit puts
a uniquely New Mexico fix to
some of the more discriminatory
exclusions in the federal E. I.
T. C..
With the elector and the working
families tax credit we've taken
our best most targeted tax
credits and made them even more
effective.
We've often said we need
additional revenue for the
budget but it's been a problem
because we're collecting revenue
in a way that disadvantages low
income workers and families of
color this bill goes a long way
to addressing the racial
inequities in our tax code and
we're very grateful to the
committee for your conscientious
work in crafting this bill thank
you.
Thank you very much Mr Jordan
Joseph Montoya.
Madam chair members of community
thank you very much for allowing
me to speak today my name is
just a fun toy and work for the
county of Santa thanks for the
housing and economic development
just a little history on this
particular bill when it was
written I was in charge of
housing economic to the cities.
The better than the speaker of
the house yes maybe come up with
something that would protect all
folks would been here for
multiple generations of from
getting kicked out of the house
because of rising property taxes
you have mortgages on their
house but they literally could
not afford the property taxes so
So that's how this bill actually
came to be created in the first
place was portion of the
integrated in first place
when I went in writing it though
I I made it right I didn't I
didn't address this to specific
issue in terms of this but
specifically to people who are
owning and in their homes this
bill just brings it back to its
original intent and allows us
for those people doesn't rise
property taxes for the rest of
the folks simply bring them back
to the property tax that they
should be paying for other true
and right property taxes it's as
a social.
So with that I just want to let
you it will better crack and
then that information let you
know that the county is that
face from the behind the stop
thank you very much thank you so
much Mr Montoya rich whiner we
need pointer.
Yes thank you madam chair
members of the committee my name
is rich we are I'm with
indivisible not bill I support
the bill over also and the it's
a fairly the personal income tax
changes.
Our great step in the and and
the direction of the equity
income tax structure more
equitable and I Madam chair
Martinez for putting this
package together and also for
explaining what the governor
ridge since a Valentine's day
forget exactly how we put it
gift I think to the very wealthy
and and and two thousand three
reduced our our revenue by huge
amount after billion dollars a
year and I think I would like to
see us go even further than we
are going today its activities
committee can further I would be
very happy to see more income
tax brackets produce more
revenue sufficiency I also want
to point out that the gross
receipts tax has gone way up in
the time that the income tax is
gone down this very regressive
I'm worried I'd like to see the
G. R. to go much further down
not just for manufacturing
remitting.
And that would take even further
revenue to offset this the the
FIR for the original H. B. two
ninety one was revenue neutral.
it's more more better revenue
positive now but I'd like to see
it be even more positive let's
get back towards and half
billion dollars lost here thank

Members of the committee I'm
Carl Kaiser an Albuquerque
resident and I strongly support
H. B. two ninety one the bill
promotes both revenue stability
and tax equity it mitigates a
portion of the disastrous two
thousand three Richards and Tax
Policy the P. I. T. and capital
gains sections raise revenue
from higher orders and add this
is sherry programs to the to our
tax code the low income
comprehensive tax credit workers
family tax credit.
I'll provide relief to Mexico
residents.
Especially seniors including
seniors who need it now and in
fact these credits also help to
offset the higher percentage of
of state and local taxes paid by
lower income people.
This is a good bill and I urge
you do past for H. B. two ninety
one.
Thank you.
Thank you very much toll gate.
Thank you Mr chairman and
committee members my name is
Paul Gibson co founder retake
Our Democracy an all volunteer
organization with twenty five
hundred member statewide with
some we had some concerns with
H. B. two ninety one before it
was amended in order but we
strongly support the substitute
bill as it implements three
important taxed revenue
strategies and brace for a
recheck increasing revenue by
eliminating tax give it'll
giveaways to the corporate
sector making the personal
income tax more progressive and
putting money more money into
the pockets of working for New
Mexicans we take use tax and
revenue decisions as moral
decisions as those decisions
define how much revenue our
government has to address the
pressing needs of our
communities and people what and
from whom they get that revenue
for the three prior
administrations the
legislature's district be stowed
on proven ineffective tax
giveaways to the wealthiest new
Mexicans to interstates with
roundhouse connections and two
out of state industries we were
trying to lure here instead of
generating the revenue we need
to build our own sustainable
economy that was a moral choice
hundreds of thousands of New
Mexicans and many small
businesses are reeling from
COVID misspoke bill puts more
money in the state treasury to
help to rebuild our economy and
puts more money in the pockets
of the neediest New Mexicans so
they can put for food on their
tables and the rebates and
credits going to working
families will be spent in
recirculated in the local
economy having a multiplier
effect we take our democracy
strongly supports passage of HB

Microsoft on the CEO of of home
wise which works throughout the
state this year will help six
hundred were nonprofit well over
six hundred Mexico families
purchase their first home so I
care deeply about affordable
housing issues no the house
around on this the property tax
cap which first passage of some
input talked about the whole
argument for this is Joseph said
was that we wanted to cap the
property taxes on owner
occupancy may be pushed out of
their homes because they can't
afford the property taxes at the
time we call this the weather on
canyon road issue
I was surprised most of which I
did hear that but this cap cap
applied to second homes and
investment properties and and
rental properties already
enjoy a lot of tax benefits they
don't they can appreciate the
value of their home I don't know
I'm a mom called landlord on one
home or for some of the paid a
hundred thirty six thousand four
now worth over three hundred
fifty our branch park see the
mortgage payment and expenses
because of the depreciation
deduction I don't pay any income
taxes on that income and then
with this property tax cap.
I don't pay property tax on the
full value of the home it seems
pretty unfair to people who are
struggling to keep their their
own home
the other thing I'm concerned
about with cap with the property
tax thing for a captain on
rental properties is this a
gives investing rental property
a competitive disadvantages the
new at the house in which we pay
less taxes paid more taxes than
existing we don't want to
discourage the development of
new rental housing thank you.
Thank you very much
there is a Lucy Hernandez.
For more the taxes yes yes but
as which hadn't.
Thank you very much ms Hernandez
Danny's done needs seo and if
you could give us your full name
that would be great thank you.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is
David the second I'm the policy
director at nonprofit
organization build futures as an
organization by and for women
and people of color we think
that share the vice chair and
all of the committee for putting
forth the tax proposal that is
really based in equity that
really centers are most impacted
families of our state to address
low income tax credit to working
families tax credit is exactly
where we need to be centered in
addressing young workers
eighteen through twenty four the
chairman lifted up systems
impacted young people young
people who are aging out of
foster care or juvenile justice
systems and that's incredibly
important young LGBTQ people
also it may take time to for
more families and may not be
parents at that age so we think
this tax credit will also
benefit them and again we think
the chairman and the vice chair
for bringing forth this proposal
and encourage your support thank
you.
Thank you very much Robert more
Lino.
I thank you for having the
I I.
Want to encourage you to please
passed H. B. two ninety one a
lot of other speakers at a great
point so I won't belabor them
too much but I just think this
would be an important step I'm
sorry and I'm I'm a for the
housing at arching director wise
and member of the Santa Fe
housing action coalition I think
this would be important steps
towards diversifying our economy
for too long we put all our eggs
in only a couple of baskets I do
not think this bill would limit
investment we're second
homeowners moving to St I just
simply don't think that.
Additive national housing market
that this represents enough of
a burden are increased burden
and just one other point I want
to reiterate that was not
previously was that I think this
bill brings up the tax matter
tax burden to a fair.
Did a fair amount of the actual
value of the property in the
case of investment properties I
think that home that was bought
twenty years ago deserves to pay
its fair share even if it's
being especially if it's being
used to generate income from
tenants there this doesn't seem
to present a large target.
To that either thank you so much
for the time and I appreciate
your consideration.
Thank you very much Kurt
greater.
Good morning madam chairman
chairwoman and members of the
committee my name is director on
the director of listening
advocacy ministry New Mexico we
also speak on behalf of New
Mexico conference of churches
and I'm here today to state our
strong support for H. B. two
ninety one S. have been alluded
by Representative Martinez and
others we know that government
tax policy can certainly harms
the common good and especially
the most vulnerable in our New
Mexico communities and this is
certainly been the case the last
twenty plus years H. B. two
ninety one makes great strides
in addressing the regressive tax
structure that currently exists
in New Mexico and moves us
towards a system where people
are taxed progressively in
relation to the ability to eight
for these reasons and for those
previously stated by proponents
before me I urge your support
for H. B. two ninety one and
thank you for the opportunity to
speak.
Thank you very much Mr Reiter
we're at our last speaker a
person namely Cerro and if you
could please give us your full
name.
Hello the Serra.
The number.
Thank you so this almost action
of any system at amendment this
solution will need.
The baking Act eagle most of
them are are handled that
incident that allegedly those so
that the looking meaning it did
when it happened and yet the
flip when asked that as part of
me is closely on it and most of
how the bottom just annual
simply must finally in place
those yep hello miss me that the
dentist second piece is getting
what happened you know for the
most happy got to buy this item
built need double to see most of
check in and check it is the
model for that also throws
in ways those going Domingo
eighteen multiple pointed one
siempre most see the screen you
know they've been if he still
bicycle skills that is on the
list and act like you know that
I mean like when we start at
this was those in place does it
then it when I check is to the
NMED can lap and then you have
enough sat or necklaces economic
up and acted so those those they
don't have I would be in the
to provide media school and
you're done that'll sample test
but part of that is what we have
to look at least so this castle
in a pool you'll what about that
it will be enough for the that
is low but okay let's be looking
up will you let me set the
ventilate activate does not mean
that you know but I can last
from yes that hello yes yes is
the ways those one one eighteen
Senate leaders in is the
committee don't voice it just.
Thank you very much Mr zero we
do have one more speaker Linda.
Good morning madam chair can you
hear me I can't thank you thank
you very much my name is Linda
Kay goes and I'm the affiliate
chair for the assessors
affiliate and
The assessors affiliate of at
this point is not in opposition
nor do we support this bill
regarding section six and
limitation in value
that is set out on that and and
and here's the reasoning
number one the assessors offices
always been of the opinion that
we like to see our values
current and correct and fair and
equitable and we we have for
years hope that there would be a
way that that we could get to
that point we do appreciate of.
Important you know current
representatives and Sanchez
bringing this forward our
concern is an item that and I'm
I'm not saying that that we're
opposing this because a third of
our assessors have concerns so
the other two thirds to have a
voice their opinion weight one
way or the other and that is the
implementation of trying to
figure out how to determine if
through the latest a discussion
draft that we received whether
however going to determine short
term versus long term of because
of the wording that is set out
in in that discussing discussion
draft paragraph C. and D. on
page two of that discussion
draft I have not seen the
amended us or the substitution
but but that's where we stand on
that
not in support of not in in
opposition of the we we haven't
figured out how if this
legislation was passed regarding
section six how we would
effectively implement this
without
Without.
Asking for more resources hiring
another person to do to make
that determination regarding
classification on the long term
versus short term.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you very much we're going
to go back to the committee and
the sponsors would you like to
add any additional comments
chairman Martinez or
Representative Matthew McQueen
before we go to the committee.
Two quick comments madam chair
up to the last comment short
term versus long term rentals is
no longer in the bill that was
part of the change that we made
in the substitute bill the
second point I want to make is
I've had delivered to all the
committee members a point five
version of this substitute which
fixes the title on page eleven
line twenty.
as I reflected discrepancy there
that that needed to be fixed so
the point five version is is
that true and accurate version
of this bill.
Thank you so much Representative
McQueen did you want to add
anything Madam chair if I if I
could I appreciate the the
chairman Martinez pointing out
of the the assessors were
looking at a discussion draft
that didn't make it into the
bill so so we don't have that
language regarding some of the
comments you know for the
realtors with with the property
changes hands it goes to current
and correct anyway so there's
that that that step up in
valuation
so what I've heard anecdotal the
from individual realtors is that
people who are in the market for
second home if you're coming
from California or Texas they're
kind of astonishing how lower
taxes are they're not worried
about future tax increases the
new home construction of course
that would be current and
correct so that should be a
problem in the apartment
association would be there would
be an adjustment there but one
of the kids made the point that
our current system is
essentially a disincentive to
building new apartment housing
stock because they have to
compete against existing stock
that is getting a subsidized tax
rate.
Actively finally we just note
that we heard from a number of
housing advocates all of whom
are in support of so thank you
Madam.
Madam chair you're needed.
Thank thank you very much
Representative McQueen.
Any comments from the committee
questions.
I see Representative Romero.
Thank you madam chair thank you
chairman and Representative
McQueen our chairman and
chairman I should.
I just want to thank you both
for the creativity the thought
process the the many many minds
that went into this to really
modernize and look at the
opportunity in our tax structure
for improvement for New Mexico
families I have got a lot of the
feedback public comments myself
through a phone calls through
emails
throughout our committee I'm
sorry throughout our community
and from folks that you know far
and wide both in the industry
and out I think that are
affected by housing affected by
how our tax rates and structures
are are functioning and of
course just the wanted to thank
the voices in in the public
comment gallery for for really
stating what the purpose of this
was and I just I think that all
of that taken together as as
we've heard it just makes so
much sense for the future of New
Mexico and continuing to improve
upon it and and as we're trying
to give back to the folks who
need at the very most you know
whether we're in a pandemic or
hat or pre or post I think this
just makes such good sense for
us and I just I want to thank
you all for for the the hard
work that's been put into this
and in particular I think the
the the housing one is very very
creative and an exciting to
think about how we can create
better access it's something
that myself Representative Rubio
and and others have been working
on since since March and and
trying to focus that effort and
energy so I just so appreciate
just figuring this out and I'm
grateful to cast a yes vote and
thank you I wish I had some
questions but I feel like it's
been so much done to this and so
much figure so much tweaking and
working through the issues
but I just appreciate your.
So thank you this is a this is
an appreciation.

correctly Representative and
madam chair but my mic
statements at the beginning or
that the
two thousand three tax cuts
didn't really do much to you
know bring economic development
and economic opportunity and I
believe your question was if I
believed if there may be other
factors involved is that
accurate.
Yes sure that's accurate and I
don't want it all with you
turning your video walls are
yesterday on the floor you were
particularly choppy with the
some of that discussion.
So by all means carry on.
I.
We we don't have very good
broadband unfortunately in
downtown Albuquerque but I I
think you're right I mean I
think I think it is a number of
different factors that that led
to you know that what many call
the the lost decade you know I
think certainly taking out you
know for five hundred million
dollars out of the general fund.
did not help you know I think we
had to make some some serious
budget cuts particularly ones
economy tanked posed two
thousand eight recession and
then once you know when when oil
and gas industry kind of fell
back in twenty sixteen to twenty
seventeen I think that pulling
out that much money out of the
general fund and not a not being
able to invest in those critical
services in those critical
programs in those critical areas
all of that blue LED I think
that lost decade.
but I think that you know when
it comes to those tax cuts you
know I've heard over and over
again from Democrats and
Republicans.
There is no mechanism to measure
the impact whether it was the
income tax cuts are capital
gains and fast forward twenty
years later and you know that
money still out of the general
fund I mean we we made up a
little bit for it in two
thousand nineteen but that money
is still out and quite frankly
I'm not sure we've got a whole
lot for it.
Thank you madam chair Mister
chair is all recall that the top
tax rate at the time.
No scratch wanted to also was.
I somewhere around eight percent
off heard.
Representative Harper.
On many many occasions.
It is important.
For New Mexico not to be an
outline that is how tax policy
should comport with our
neighboring states at least.
Because that's the folks that we
are competing with us four
investment dollars.
Could you tell me how well for
example with hers over Colorado
Oklahoma Texas how we would
compare.
If you're legislation becomes
law.
With.
Thanks.
Mr.
Madam chair and representative
Scott the tax rates in those
three states
are are lower would be lower you
know Texas for example doesn't
have a personal income tax
But they do have a pretty high
property tax much higher than
what we have here you know I I I
agree with the I agree with the
notion that we don't want to be
an out liar necessarily and I
think that would apply
in many different areas of tax
policy however you know in in
those other communities.
where.
You know we think of Colorado
for example you know there's so
many different industries at
play you know oil and gas being
one of them but also
recreational cannabis is another
one.
you know tourism I think they've
really done a good job of of you
know leveraging those different
industries to to grow their
economy here in New Mexico were
as as you know and members the
committee no Madam chair
representative were overly
reliant on one industry and the
way that industry goes goes the
state of New Mexico
with regard to Arizona you know
they they do have a new top rate
of eight percent so in that case
we would probably be more line
with them although I would
submit to you we would still be
lower of the proposed six point
five tax rate is certainly lower
than Arizona's top tax rate.
Mr Chairman.
Madam chair Mister chair with
respect to capital gains.
For.
In our tax committee on many
occasions
Is
Significant shortage.
Of capital Mexico.
To provide for business for
formation of business
development.
To provide for businesses to
grow I think we've provided.
X. relief and benefits to folks
since I've been here.
Attempting to remedy the lack of
capital that's available in the
state do you believe this
legislation would.
It would have any further
negative effects on not having
money available for business
formation and growth.
Mr speaker Mr I madam chair and
you know Representative.
The capital gains deduction was
another Valentine's day gift in
two thousand three
and again you know the question
I think is do we have has that
deduction allowed for more
capital to be invested in New
Mexico and I I just don't think
we know and and quite frankly I
I don't think it has I mean at
least not in a way that is
measurable and that we can see
and benefit from that's why
under this proposal you know we
are going back to the pre two
thousand three capital gains
deduction although we are
carving out those situations
where hard working New Mexican
might establish a business you
know twenty years ago and
they're ready to retire and they
want to sell it we wanna make
sure that they can tap into the
deduction but with you with
regard to just having a full out
deduction for any type of
capital gains I'm not sure we've
had any benefit from it but we
do know that if we review it we
stand to gain about forty
million dollars in those dollars
can go into providing for those
two other
The tax incentive programs for
low income earners and working
families we do know that those
two particular you know that
rebate in that credit is money
that gets rejected right back
into the economy it is not sent
off shortage not sent to some
bank in some other country
working families will get that
credit we'll get that rebate and
they will go to home depot and
buy construction materials to
fix up their house bill go buy
that new car they'll go by you
know but perhaps they might buy
that first home you know that's
the that's the power I think of
that particular created in that
particular rebate and with
capital gains we just don't see
the same benefits you know
someone who might stay here I
suppose in some money but I
might be invested I suppose but
for the most part it seems like
it it it doesn't.
Madam chair Mister chair are
completely agree with you to to
use of the funds that you're
generating.
With this legislation are being
put to good use those.
Those tax credits.
Have in the past proven to be.
Is but.
The source of the funds is is
real concern and debate.
And that is.
Folks would be subject to this
capital gains provisions are the
very folks.
The ability to.
That have the ability to reduce
their tax liability user with a
tax planning or relocation or.
We had a number of things and
those are particularly.
The folks we've made here in the
state.
To help build.
So
madam chair Mister chair I do
appreciate the conversation and
I'll look forward to the rest of
the questions thank you that's
all I have thank you.
Thank you Representative Scott
with
Representative Strickler is
indulgence may I go back to
Representative Harper.
Representative thank you madam
chair and I I very much
appreciate your Highness and
latitude
I was able to get another bill
passed out of committee quickly
So thank you for that.
Madam chair and Mr chair
I love or a love hate
relationship with sometimes
have.
I wish I could see your face I
know you've got internet issues
so I'm just imagine that you
were smiling and laughing with
me
madam chair and and
Representative about I am I am
and yeah I'm a I'm I'm even on
the extender and it's it's it's
really choppy I think it's
because both my kids from there
is no right now so understood
understood.
You'll have to look at my
smiling portrait.
Also will do.
So.
I I I do agree with one of the
comments that was raised in the
audience that
We're looking at our gross
receipts tax.
we need to not just addressed
chairman but we also need to
lower the rate.
and folks have been around for a
lot of know that I I say those
both are are very critical
The morning right especially
helps what's the regressivity
are but also also chairman of
problem is it costs money to do
that.
the so hopefully we can do that
the in the near future.
so I just wanted to make that
quick point.
Madam chair representative just
walks through the bill a little
bit because there's a lot of
good in this bill.
So.
The elector.
Portion Mr chair the madam chair
Mister chair.
your house bill four twelve the
big tax reform bill that almost
got through had a update to
elector.
I really.
Has been but twentieth.
Years since the last update
So
I have no problem was was
updating elector and our madam
chair and Mr chair I know that
Earlier
during this session we we
temporarily tabled essentially
this version of the bill and we
had some discussion around that.
and I and I asked what was the.
On a rational basis behind the
numbers that were chosen and and
I believe chair Mister chair if
I remember right I was pleased
with the answer but I was really
based off of.
One of the inflation indexes
indexing the that
Older value to present value I
remember that correctly.
Representative madam chair yes.
So so I I think I think this is
a good thing
I I madam chair and Mr chair I
believe in this bill is it this
committee sub do we have it also
indexed automatically server
your gross was inflation.
Madam chair and representative
yeah the amount of the rebate
would would would be indexed.
And our madam chair Mister chair
your number which inflation
index we're we're gonna use for
that there's there's several.
Yeah I think it's the consumer
price index if I'm not mistaken
madam chair representing.
Okay
Chair Mister chair thank you for
that I.
That one
So they all have their pros and
cons that would has waited a
little bit differently than
others
I don't think we'll get wrapped
around the axle on which one you
should pick.
I think the only real point I
wanted to make their is that.
You know this.
You know if that's the policy
decision we we want to make to
index that that's fine.
But
need to be careful because.
We have.
Out a lot of the revenue streams
in our state budget that rise
with inflation.
And we have many questions of
our budget that rise.
the costs rise faster than the
rate of inflation.
I'm thinking specifically of
health care.
Medicaid which makes up about a
sixth of our budget health care
costs raised faster than
inflation and then also.
education especially higher at.
costs rise higher than inflation
now that we're adding inflation
to to lecture.
nursing on the other side of the
appropriation point we're gonna
start seeing.
squeezing in our other budgets.
As a result if by continuing to
add sings
that are and are us that rise
with inflation and I'd love to
just hear.
Comments on on that order chair
Mister chair.
Madam chair representative yeah
I mean I think I think this this
rebate which would increase you
know arguably every year.
is taking money out
of our of our budget
That's why it for me it was
extremely important that in fact
when madam chair when when.
Madam chair Chandler had this
bill early on.
You know not having a way to pay
for it I think was was really
going to cost a great deal of
Hartman for a lot of us.
And so in this bill we have some
provisions to ensure that we are
able to pay that bill.
and you know essentially shift
resources from those who can
afford to pay a little bit more
to help support those who
cannot.
and I I think that that's one of
the.
that that's one of the
highlights of the bill in also
look coming if you look at the
and and we heard this in public
comment like this is not a.
You know windfall for the state
I mean the the it's it's
essentially revenue neutral in
there it's it's positive.
in the out years but it's
relatively minimal compared to
the size of the state budget and
that was important to us as well
you know I think we are in a.
Yeah we're living in a time
where you know everybody's got
to make do with what they have
and I believe this bill strikes
that balance and it ensures that
people who have as you mentioned
for twenty years not seen an
increase in a program that was
in a tax program that was
developed to ensure a little bit
more precipitate.
they get a little bit more
benefit.
In my opinion twenty years too
late I mean they should be index
back in ninety eight we would be
here having this discussion
but at the very least now we
have the ability to provide this
is relief for these working
families many of homework or
exams workers.
Madam chair and and Mr chair
thank you for your comments on
that I I just in general.
Legislature which you know is
not.
I would describe far right as
has not
That right that has not included
inflation indexes so I just
wanna make sure we understand
we're going this with our eyes
wide open.
So the.
So moving on to the next
provision I want talk about the.
Working families tax credit.
You're you're you're exactly
right madam chair Mister chair
this was start during the Reagan
administration and there are
lots of pros to this credit one
is that it encourages folks to
work.
which is what.
We all really want I mean I I
don't know if you want someone
to
stay at home and just receive
benefits and.
never contribute
in a way that can lead to have a
great feeling of self worse
that we we know that
being employed and contributing
that's wonderful things to to
people's emotional states are
there there there will be.
so I I think all the I don't
think I'm you know going on a
bridge too far to say that all
of us want good jobs and folks
to be able to.
Lift themselves out of bad
circumstances.
So.
Garcia.
We talked a little bit about the
pros and cons of ordinary tax
credit as well as our there is
some.
fraud was twelve it is run by
the feds not by us.
But okay I'm I get my my my
biggest concern here.
Is that even though this is a
good credits encourages people
to work.
That we're not taking this a
holistic.
R. wholistic approach and I
think a very top of this once
this year and I apologize if I'm
repeating myself but we have
lots of different programs for
folks who are needing help to
get back on their feet.
We have
which which we talk about right
now you have to working families
tax credit would come on now we
also have tennis which helps
people who are looking for a job
we have Medicaid to help folks
who need our health
coverage cover the cost of
recovering their health Kerr
care costs we have which
which helps with food for for
low income women and children.
We have section eight housing
which can cover the cost of
housing for folks who are in a
tight spot.
We have other how did the
programs and we also have an
employment the insurance
and these are just what off the
top of my head so I I'm I don't
know if I'm leaving something
out.
What we're trying to make is.
We have a real saying call cliff
effects.
Where people who are you know in
in getting on their feet and
trying to climb out of a bad
situation.
that extra dollar earned
actually result in them losing
benefits.
Happening in my life with your
kids in college.
and and I heard from a friend
recently who have had an amazing
lady actually hired that she
came in and told him I'm sorry I
have you know I have to stop
working now one more paycheck I
was my budget.
So so this really happens.
So so chairman I guess my
question is.
I swear raising the working
families tax credit from fifteen
to twenty percent we're also
creasing worker as we really
looked holistically to make sure
that we don't have a bunch of
clips of facts that we're
working to to level these things
out maybe the right thing is to
double the working towards tax
credit and only increase elector
by fifty percent are doing here
or maybe it's the other way
around but have we looked at
this holistically.
Madam chair and representative
that that's a great question
and you know it's it's something
that you'll be you've heard me
say over and over again in fact
the thing we had a a big bill in
commerce committee not too long
ago where raise that same point
you know include thanked Israel.
you know I I think we we have a
look holistically and and I
think it is.
Important for us is as policy
makers to do so.
you know with regard to these
two well first of all what with
regard to the to the Senator
very worthwhile programs you
mentioned and then I'm gonna
pass this on to my experts here
for her comments specific to the
config but I do want to make the
point you know many of these
programs
you know were conceived as part
of the great society you know
President Johnson forty fifty
years ago
Unfortunately unfortunately I
think it is as government we
have not done a good job of
working to involve those
programs.
and you know it's sort of
It's sort of a
You know given to Haiti feels
like right with
you know maybe people on my side
of the aisle wanting to put more
money to grow those programs and
maybe people on your side of the
aisle looking for ways to save
money and maybe fund those
programs a little bit less floor
or put more requirements of I
think personally.
You know the future of this
country
that needs to really really look
and and and reassess how we view
public benefits and there's some
really cool concepts out there
that I don't think our
legislature is necessary you
ready for a but there's some
really interesting concepts out
there that are looking at not
only providing is sitting at the
safety net always has to be
there right people are going to
fall on hard times and we need
to be able to have a safety net
but we also need to be looking
at ways to to to help
incentivize that entrepreneurial
spirit that we as human beings.
Inherently have you know I am
and not to get too far into the
weeds of this but you know
concepts of a universal basic
income are not too far fetched
for me speaking just for myself
they're not that crazy there's
something to that
obviously there's you know as a
society there's a lot of work
that needs to happen first
before we get to a point like
that but we do need to reimagine
how are public benefits systems
work otherwise we're we're sort
of.
You know what what we're sort of
spinning wheels right we can
never really have a true
conversation about raising the
minimum wage.
Because on the other side of
that are cliff effects right and
then of course that leads us to
maybe we need to discuss the
concept of a living wage right
not just the minimum wage but a
living wage because if you're
making a living wage then you
were arguably should be the
effect should not you shouldn't
need public benefits but then
that sort of opens up a whole
other can of worms right should
you know the ice cream shop down
the street you know are they are
they gonna be able to afford you
know a ten dollar other ice
cream scoop to pay the living
wage I mean I I those are policy
questions we got to have a but I
I do want is Mrs Wallen who has
a great deal of expertise with
Cleve effects to to give give us
some insight.
Thank you Mr chair Madam chair
representative Harper I think
that's a great question and and
you know we've talked about it
over the years and you've
brought it up many times over
the years is a very in a real
issue for a lot of our families
and so like to kind of maybe
address that in two parts in the
idea of overlapping benefit
programs and social safety net
programs and how those work and
so wanted to lift up the most
recipients of public safety net
programs are seniors and
children.
And so that's the majority of
people who are actually
receiving a bit of support from
these programs that we know many
of them are are still inadequate
but those are mostly children
and seniors and of those that
are of working age most live in
working households so we know
these are workers we know these
are working families we know
that New Mexico has the highest
rate of working but still poor
families in the nation so we
know people who received
budget resources social safety
net programs are to your point
really working hard to improve
opportunities for them their
families and I also would add to
that most people who receive
public benefits do so
temporarily and so something to
lift up about one of the purpose
of this bill seventy percent of
recipients of New Mexicos
working families tax credit only
get it for one to two years
that's one of the best things
about this program it's helping
people move in so you know
higher economic opportunities
and create opportunities for
their families and you know
that's the case across the
different different social
safety net programs but
specifically for working
families very temporarily
because of different
requirements applying for
receiving different types of
benefits most people did not
receive benefits from a lot of
different public programs so for
example you brought up the
supplemental nutrition
assistance program and tenants
so only ten percent of people
who receive snap also get
tenants so it's actually a
smaller population that gets
more than one of these programs
and of working families tax
credit elector actually targeted
to different segments of New
Mexicans they really kind of
have different people in our
state who need a little bit more
assistance to get by and to the
fiscal cliff which I think it's
a great it's which are really
great point one that we should
consider with all of our
programs I would also say that
working families tax credit
elector are really very both
very well structure to combat
the cliff effect because both
increases income increases to a
certain type of.
and then they begin to gradually
decrease with increasing incomes
until they phase out so when we
talk about the cliff effect
these are exactly the type of
programs that we want to see
because there's not just a point
where people fall off you know
it's say it incentivizes work
incentivizes increases income
and then it slowly phases out so
that's exactly what we like to
see you know we say that the
best way to address that cliff
affect is really to enforce well
structured programs just like
working families and elector
that help address those issues
by helping people meet their
basic needs while they're
incomes grow and then they need
less and less support from the
social social safety net
programs and so these are
exactly the type of programs
that are the ones that we should
be investing more in.
Madam chair Mister chairman miss
one thank you.
Thank you for that yes I know
you and I have talked about this
you can share a little bit of
your data.
was me which I'm I was grateful
for I'm.
And and yeah I I agree that
these
are structured at in a way that
as income grows the credit
slowly falls instead of a big
cliff.
So yes these two are structured
well.
My.
My concern is just that when we
add all the other eight
programs that you and I just
mentioned on top of each other.
Where do those Colfax occur and
what I really would just love
I've I've asked for this I don't
think it's too hard you know it
would be nice just to have a
plot that on one axis is income.
On the other access our number
of dependents because always
benefits the.
Depend on our budget.
If you have these kind of
rotated like this and your
little bars that come up.
And each bar shows how much
total they get it and there's
like a little color for each
Vargas is this Matt this is the
tenants this is that working
families tax credit this is one
of a certain reimbursement in
federal income tax and then you
can very clearly see just
looking up the surface where the
holes are.
I'm and that's what I meant by
well yeah maybe maybe what
you're structured really well by
itself.
But there's a couple pulls over
here and maybe we just need to
use elector push those those
holes are.
So that everything is level
we put it all together.
Thank you would see yes not been
intent if they really help at
this point here but then they're
gonna go to this section first.
So data driven approach I would
just be much more comfortable
with Spanish servicing and we're
going to go from seventeen
percent to twenty percent and
Pat ourselves on the back and so
did a good job.
So I'm that that's that's where
I would like to see us go.
Okay so I I think I've I've.
Maybe that point and I'll move
on to the next one but thank you
all for your thoughts on that
and I I believe we're on the
same page I would just like to
see that.
Okay going to tax lightning
madam chair and representative
claim.
Thank you
so so this clearly needs to be
fixed.
and again it was part of the
original version of for twelve
to address this weird.
cap we have on our property
valuations and and just again
just very briefly I'm not going
to the eight year but we have
something called yield control.
That is actually a formula in
our statutes that actually took
care of this problem already
what it said was that when
housing values go up.
It pushes the rate of tax do you
know so that the counties and
cities in all school districts
get about the same amount of tax
was maybe some inflation.
When it goes the other way when
housing does go down.
That pushes the tax rate up so
that again you have roughly
level revenues so when housing
market does this your tax
revenue to counties and school
districts no it is it's
essentially level so is already
there.
When we put on this weird three
percent cap on on property
values it just really messed the
system up.
What to this unforeseen kind of
tax lightning problem where you
can have someone living right
next door but to someone who's
not paying half for less the
property tax that you're paying
for your home I don't think I
think we can all talk about
whether it should be higher
lower the property tax rate
should be but I think we can all
agree.
But having two neighbors was
essentially the same property
paying very different property
tax amounts it's not fair that's
not right it's probably actually
against our constitution.
So I I agree with you that this
needs to be fixed
Matt madam chair and and I.
The queen apparently did you
talk about how you came to this
particular six and and why you
think this is appropriate.
Madam chair representative
Herbert I I guess I I don't
think of this bill as a tax
lightning fix bills
and I I and I I I think it would
preserve the
Situation you just described you
know it is really interesting we
had we comments from two members
of the public who were involved
in the drafting of the regional
built in two thousand twenty
years ago.
And that they the intent of the
bill was to protect.
Homeowners who were facing
rapidly escalating values I
think I think of Michael often
refer to it as the like the
Santa Fe window affect I I've
called it the little old lady on
canyon road so if you're
familiar with canyon road you
know it was
very Sir traditional place to
live and.
Their families who live there
literally for generations and
it's also very high in real
estate right now and so that was
a problem and so we thought that
this three percent cap and I I
don't have any qualms with three
percent cap in protecting
homeowners.
The unfortunately the when a.
After the bill is just want to
is that they didn't really think
about the breadth of the bill in
it also includes residential
properties that are second homes
are very education homes are
investment properties are owned
by corporations are you have
basically properties where.
In my opinion fairness would
dictate they pay tax on the
current and correct value of the
property and this this gets us
there and and I would know the
there's there's two provisions
that it bears the provision
preserving the three percent cap
of four owner occupied primary
residences and then the next
provision it actually is that
ten percent cap and this is
something that you and I
discussed a couple years ago and
it was actually requested by the
apartment association and others
that when we bring these other
properties back to current and
correct we don't do it all at
once in one year.
And so that ten percent cap is
actually in their for their
protection and it will provide a
soft landing for properties are
no longer eligible for the three
percent.
Madam chair and chair cleaned
thank you for that that makes
sense to me because this really
is not a tax lightning fixed and
so I'm I'm glad you were not
believing are framing it as
such.
And and a ten percent number I.
I think it's interesting
So what one of the.
Solutions that you and I I we've
talked about was.
just increasing that cap to a
point where it's just a little
bit ahead of the normal
inflation amount so it seems
kind of slow in wine.
And the the number that I was
able to come up with us I'm
looking at the historical data
is that values of property New
Mexico rise by about five
percent annually historically
over the last thirty years so
thinking something like seven
percent.
to be just kind of head of that.
Would allow the market to settle
to where it should be over about
twenty years.
and so going to ten percent
obviously would accelerate that.
do you know.
Madam chair representative about
how long was a ten percent.
Would it take for most values
current correct.
Madam chair Representative
Harper creek question
the answer that you gave me
which I've been telling everyone
else so I hope it's correct is
seven years so based on our
conversation couple years ago
that was that was your
calculation I could not tell you
what that you used but that's
the number that stuck in my head
for the past couple.
Chair of New York we thank you
for that that that was the
number I remembered but I
haven't done the masts on that
for a few years so I don't know
if that I don't there's a big
change to that because we we
base thirty years of data.
To get that number so require
about right so.
Seven seven years maybe a little
maybe a little fast for some but
I think
this that's better than three
years or something you know
really kind of breakneck speed.
Okay so.
I guess last question have in
regards to this approach
For you chairman queen and Mr
madam chair.
So I think one of the reasons
the original bill ritual
legislation that type of the
state percent cap on captured so
many folks is that in our
constitution we very
specifically state that you
can't treat.
Different property.
Tax folks.
I'm sorry different.
Properties differently.
I'm and I know that you made Mr
chair and Madam chairman you
made some changes in the
committee sought to address some
of that.
could you talk about just the
constitutionality and why you
believe that this approach would
Stand up to it a constitutional
challenge.
Representative Harper you know
we we look at whether we could
do something about rentals
and and specifically we are
looking at like that the Airbnb
kind rentals but you know that
you know that this the small
maybe the small house or maybe
some of these older apartment
buildings
and you know can the owners of
this property.
Those properties pass the tax on
to their tenants you know to
some extent probably of the does
you know the that's probably a
factor supply and demand but we
look at that and we decided we
couldn't do that for these
constitutional reasons
but Madam chair representative
Parker under our constitution
some looking at the M. in
addition to the current
statutes.
zao the monthly at the.
We're limited to the three
enumerated characteristics based
on age income and when our
occupancy so this.
Bill is based on owner occupancy
and we think it passes
constitutional muster because of
that.
Yeah.
Madam chair and and are
currently in I. eight.
I can understand that argument
I'm not a constitutional lawyer
you know I'm a research
engineer.
so I can understand the
arguments I'm I'm not sure.
if that's sufficient I'm still a
little concerned there.
I.
I'm I'm just you know looking at
how do we solve the problem that
we're trying to solve.
It maybe there are different
ways we can do it
no for really trying to protect
the the widow in Santa Fe
County.
No do we not do something like
I mean we're we have on the
books a deduction for folks over
a certain age on their property
taxes that are household.
Right are there are there other
ways that we can you know make
this loaf of bread.
And then just
you know on wind slowly gently
but on one this this this mess
that we're in it just feels
like.
We may be making it slightly
worse making it even more Hodge
podge by going this direction
and I just love to hear your
thoughts on that.
Representative Harper I
appreciate the question and I
want to tie it back to to
something you said earlier.
So you know a couple different
for this year one is I don't
think this fixes the tax
lightning thing and I think we
have accepted as a policy that
we want to protect owners so
that I I'm not messing with that
policy.
So that what can we do for
homeowners well you you brought
up a great point yield control
so you'll control is still there
and you know the basic idea as
you said value overall
valuations go up rates good
thank right this is allowed
overall valuations go up so
those homeowners that we're
trying to protect might actually
see their rates for them so this
is a tax cut.
For owner occupied primary
residence homeowners.
Yeah Madam and and zero point I
I agree that may actually be the
case with probably a very small
one but yeah the yield control.
Of function will work that way
that has these other property
values increased that means will
push the right down generally
speaking for for everyone else
so that bill there may be a
small impact there's I
appreciate you you mentioned
that yeah I just.
You know I'm I've been trying to
make things more uniformed was
Hodge podge G. and
I understand what you're trying
to do here latest.
okay I'll express my concern
thank you.
Okay I want to just talk about
the last two portions of this
bill and and again say that
really is first three that have
talked about.
Generally I'm on the same page
right I think we can be a little
more data driven.
let's Hodge podge G. that's a
phrase but generally I'm I'm I I
to support these things.
The the the the concerns I have
with some of the last two parts
of of the bill.
so we're.
I'm making a big change to the
capital gains deduction.
And the and this changes even
something that I've thought
about really the and I
appreciate that we're not just
completely repealing the capital
gains deduction.
because really
where this really hurts is if
you've got a small mom and pop
business you know like.
Former chairman for CIOS
convenience store.
Right
know that folks have put their
for time and love and effort
into overall the many years and
then no they don't have a four
one Kerry you know how they how
they retire as they sell that
boosts.
so I really appreciate that
we're leaving in that
CEO of a small business
the inner child instruction
that's that's really important.
now the other part
There are there are still lots
of places where small businesses
take advantage of that capital
gains deduction.
It's not just folks you have a
huge retirement
income that you know are.
Are a you know benefiting from
this.
and and I right here all the
time people saying that that was
promised that this will bring
all kinds of capital investment
in New Mexico in Richardson did
this.
I never heard that promise I I
don't whatever when you look at
good tax policy.
we try not to taxes over and
over again in the capital gains
as it is another tax on top of
an income tax.
so to me it makes sense in
almost all the other states and
you have some kind of capital
gains deduction for that very
reason.
So.
Madam chairman and chairman can
you.
Explain to me why
You believe that this forty six
million dollar increase in taxes
that will no really hit small
businesses.
Why you think this is okay slash
justified.
Especially in light of the
current situation rent.
Thank you madam chair and
representative great question.
you know first of all based on
the IRS data that we you know
that that we've seen that that
our our team has seen
of almost half of the value is
claimed by less than one percent
of New Mexicans
you know that tells me is that
you have a very small number of
people
that are.
Claiming and
making benefit of this
deduction.
I think that the.
Exemption if you will with the
bill that allows that small
business owner to sell their
business and be and still be
able to make use of the
deduction it is an important one
because we do we we don't want
to punish.
People who have you know laid
roots planted seeds here in New
Mexico started a business you
know to your to the example of
former chair through he you know
and and his convenience store
and you worked for forty years
and now you're ready to retire
you want to sell it we want to.
protect as much as we can that
investment and and and and you
know allow you to keep as much
as as as as possible.
but I think that when when you
start thinking about who the
other beneficiaries of the is of
this deduction you know.
What type of investment for
example what type of capital
gain
there there.
You know they're securing you
know these are folks who
probably can afford to pay a
little bit more.
in a forty six million dollar
tax benefits.
For which we really have no
data.
as to whether or not it's been
beneficial I mean we just don't
know
I'm sure there are examples of
people who have used the money
that they received and they've
invested
you know in New Mexico I'm sure
there are examples of that but
like I said at the beginning I
don't think this I don't think
it's enough for us to be able
to.
to legitimize this level of of
Of of of benefit of deduction.
you know when we talk about New
Mexico not being an out liar
We gotta remember forty one.
Other states forty one of the
state's tax capital gains at the
same rate as early wages
we're definitely not live here
now.
I would be so supposed to be an
out liar maybe in this situation
if New Mexico was brimming with
investments.
But I don't see that.
I don't see that in the data I
don't see that in the reports
that we get from TRD I don't see
that in rest up in the interim I
have not seen that in six years
in the legislature and as a
regular good old dude in the
north value Albuquerque I don't
see that either you know
and so.
You know again if we're gonna
afford it increase in Victor and
increasing working families tax
credit we've got to find a way
to pay for it.
and short of blowing another
hole in our general fund
I think this is a responsible
path forward we would be joining
well not we would at least move
in the direction of forty one
other states we still keep the
deduction for those homegrown
businesses for those folks that
are here and and have built a
business over thirty years and
the cell that we want to protect
them but we still make sure that
those who can afford can pay a
little bit more.
Madam chairman thank you for
your answer again I.
I'm grateful that we leave the.
Sale of New Mexico small
business that's important
I wonder if we might run into
some issues with the federal
constitution treating.
Mexico small businesses
differently than out of state
small businesses we've seen that
seem a couple times already the
session about limiting stuff
just New Mexico businesses.
So I still out there.
I'm I'm I'm I'm just I guess I'm
surprised to hear the forty one
St number
you know very much that I I'm
very much I believe that New
Mexico should not be an out
liar.
and last I checked most states
have some form of deduction for
for capital gains that actually
near the federal deduction.
so I I need to look up that
number of forty one states have
something slightly different
than the federal
but my my understanding is.
That most states have some kind
of deduction.
But.
All do some homework Madam
chairman.
So.
I just going on to the second
our I guess the last items here
and then some some discussion on
it.
we're creating three new
brackets and that and the income
tax.
And I just I want to first say
that
When you're here folks say that
we don't have a progressive tax
code.
I guess that's in the eye of the
beholder
But when we had a study done by
Ernst and young here just a
couple years ago looking at a
couple different proposed tax
policies they had a very awesome
slot and wish I could show it to
hear but I.
Not
I basically they they had a plot
that show the percent of income
that folks pay.
when you include all of our
programs not just income tax
dollar rebate programs.
And what we saw is that a low
and there's actually a negative.
Percent income tax people on the
low and actually get money back.
and that that inflection point
where you start going to above
zero percent.
actually doesn't happen until
about twenty five thousand I
think it's H. E. R..
and then that's very I think
it's out to about thirty five
thousand for our individuals and
and that one is pretty it's got
a pretty good spoke to it.
and then it and then it doesn't
bend over when you get about to
a four point no new cost of four
point nine percent that was our
current cap and and maybe maybe
that's what you're talking about
abi progressive maybe want to
raise that that bar up more.
The truth is the the folks on
the lower income spectrum a
negative income tax when you
look at that plot.
So.
Looking at.
These new brackets and you know
try not to be an out wire and
and comparing our state our.
Current tax rate to those around
us.
I think I think we are.
creating a big problem with this
with this current.
Legislation.
so house bill six last year
brought us up from four point
five I'm sorry for point nine
which was really the average of
all the states in our area
that's where we came up with
that weird number.
two I believe it was five point
nine.
Which which is a little high
you're not so great but at least
it was consistent with our
corporate income tax rate our
corporate affects our personal
contacts Representative level so
I can discretion was that.
But here we're seeing some
pretty high.
Bracket increases.
And I just to kind of go around
our neighboring states you know
Utah has a flat tax rate of four
point nine five percent.
Colorado has a flat income tax
rate of four point five five
percent.
Oklahoma where top bracket is
five percent.
Texas doesn't have income tax
but they have high property tax
that's already.
Our kids at that revenue.
Arizona this year
has a new top bracket of eighty
percent.
Okay so that they are definitely
not wired.
But you look at how we structure
that.
That eight percent six million
for incomes greater than five
hundred thousand.
You don't pay over four and a
half percent Arizona until
you're making over three hundred
and twenty seven thousand.
So how we structure this year in
New Mexico.
When you start feeling impact
at.
Two hundred thousand.
Income.
And who is who is two hundred
thousand I'm right those those
rich cats nope that to our live
in large right we we don't have
many of those security Mexico
that's why we had to to generate
the money needed to pay for
these great programs we had a
dive dive down into the middle
class.
No these are your your doctors.
Your your small business owners.
you know lawyers maybe we don't
care so much about lawyers
I'm sorry Mr speaker
But.
You know just you're going to
that this again was our our eyes
wide open you know this is.
could hurt people that we're
actually trying to help right
now.
we know how hard it is to get
rural doctors.
we know that our small
businesses or hurting right now
that's why we're giving them in
all of our no few hundreds of
millions of dollars of help.
But that help is really going to
help about five percent of the
businesses that are out there.
And and to me it was more like.
We're handing them a fish.
And then if we pass this we're
taking away their fishing pole.
You know we really need to be
cognizant of what we're doing
with.
Both hands here right we're
we're trying to give them some
stimulus to stay alive.
But then we're going to.
Significantly increase the taxes
that thirty paying.
So.
I guess I've talked here for for
for a little bit long I
apologize madam chair Mister
chair I I love to hear spots.
Thank you madam chair
representative I appreciate the
discussion you know look I I
think that.
tax policy is is everybody on
this committee knows is very
nuanced and there are a lot of
moving parts.
but I I just want to step back
from it
We what house bill two ninety
one is
hoping to do is to bring a
little bit more progressively
into the tax code and and you
know you we mention to Ernst and
young and and there is the most
recent the PFM report you know
we've got to start diversifying
our revenue streams of data
start diversifying or are
So that we're not so over
reliant on any street.
Look at the end of the day
We want to make sure.
That.
New Mexico businesses.
R. back to work.
And running on all eight
cylinders or if it's an electric
vehicle running at one hundred
percent Max battery.
and in order for us to do that I
believe we've got to have a tax
system that is more fair a tax
system that rewards hard work a
tax system that is equitable and
for the last twenty years it
hasn't been.
For the last twenty years I
think what we've done is we've.
Shot in the dark hoping for
something miss and you know
we've had
You know proper prior to this
governor and and I believe this
governor has been very strategic
in in in tax policy.
As we've seen the last two three
years but the previous two
governors I fuel and one from
each party I feel they were sort
of maybe they were thinking
about higher office I don't know
but they were throwing some
stuff out there hoping to stick
and it stuck you know we and and
we got stuck with
the tax bill at the end of
twenty thirteen that drastically
reduced corporate income tax
again have we seen a benefit I
don't know I think that's up for
debate in prior to that we had a
big giant tax cut that not sure
was good for us.
Was it working for us before
then I mean we had an eight
point two percent top tax rate.
You know I couldn't tell you you
know maybe a little research I
could but right now I can tell
you where that a point to
content but fact of the matter
is we had a point to tax rate.
We got rid of that.
Indeed we see a budget.
What we know for sure happen as
we pulled five hundred million
dollars a year out of the
economy out of the general fund
that's what we don't have it.
But we can't I cannot point to
an example of how it benefits so
up you know if if this was
merely a you know democratic
ploy to.
You know take from the rich and
give to the poor are you know we
this would be structured
differently I probably would go
back to the eight point two
percent then I probably would've
gotten rid of all capital
construction but we know that
it's not that way it's it's much
more nuanced and then we've got
to be tactical and surgical in
our approach and I believe that
this is tactical and surgical I
can tell you I heard from people
who hate this bill for the
opposite reasons I've heard for
I heard people who hate this
bill because the income you know
we're just raising taxes and
then I heard from people hate
this bill because they don't
think it went far enough.
And when that happened I said
should I got a good bill here.
I have a really good bill I got
the left then got the right man
this must be a good bit so so
those are my thoughts and chair
and representative I I I think
that the this is the surgical
approach to tax reform.
it's one small piece is you know
tax reform is much more than
this but I'm I'm happy with
where it's at and and I
appreciate the discussion and I
appreciate the debate.
The madam chair chairman I'd
appreciate a discussion to I
appreciate that.
You and I can.
Talk about issues like this and
and not to resort to name
calling and
sound bites that we can have a
intellectual discussion and
respect each other's
differences.
I and I think when those
differences is you know when we
talk about diversifying revenue.
What what comes to my mind.
Is having a an environment where
we encourage folks were here to
grow the courage folks who are
here to take a rest could start
a new business and we're not
environment that discourages
folks from moving in and trying
out New Mexico.
I'm again I'm not trying to miss
characterized okay correct me if
I'm wrong madam chair and
chairman when when I hear you
talk about diversifying our
revenue streams.
Really you're talking about
changing how we tax.
And.
And I just think we need to be
careful because at this point
and our economy our three
biggest actors are.
Government when you count
federal and state local that's
our largest sector.
Health care is our largest non
government.
Employer industry in the state
and then you look at tax
generations extractive
industries.
Point to those other industries.
And so.
No no Utah did something a
couple years ago I just have so
much respect for.
Do you remember madam chair and
chairman when yes what was
trying to shop around all the
states and in this area and
trying to get us to give him a
sweet deals for the builder a
they did build a battery plant
here remember that yeah yeah.
and this goes back to something
Representative Maestas said
earlier.
You know some some businesses do
stick around to try to get a
sweet deal and and that.
And.
Utah.
unlike New Mexico every other
business
basically said.
No thank you I'm we have a good
tax code here.
And it's friendly to all
businesses.
If you want to come here come
here we're not gonna give you a
sweetheart deal.
I think they did the same thing
with Facebook here recently.
I had a total respect for.
I I really believe that
the best way we grow our economy
and attract good jobs here is we
just have a good basic tax code.
And and people look around will
sail to Mexico is it's a
beautiful place so many fun
things to their culture is
amazing the food is amazing.
you know we have a couple things
that don't.
You know score well right
schools in Albuquerque
Time and.
What I worry is that
By making these changes to pay
for what I think we all agree
are good things.
now to look at our tax code and
and in addition to that you're
cheating.
We're not gonna say twelve that
income tax to and.
And and I worry I worry about
that
You know just to be
intellectually honest our
property tax used to be right
next to a.
I was watching the constitution
and how to get people to go for
that.
That we can make these changes
to elector thank you changes the
working families tax credit.
Perhaps address the the property
tax issue.
Without.
Making these right we were
harmful changes to the tax code.
Madam chair representative I I
disagree with the notion that
these are harmful changes to the
tax code in digging around here
for some numbers pre two
thousand three that top tax rate
kicked in at a hundred thousand
dollars I mean this is nowhere
near to what it used to be it is
very surgical is very tactical
you know you'd go you'd go from
you know I I I you know I point.
Six point two six point five I
mean these are not drastic
changes I mean people people who
are earning four hundred fifteen
thousand dollars
are gonna go up from five nine
two six two I mean it's it's
it's it's relatively minimal in
the grand scheme of things I
don't think these changes are
going to drive out any business
personality Mexico any serious
business percent at least if
you're if you're a business
person just looking for the
cheapest place to do business
and you know you planning to go
elsewhere but I don't think any
of these changes are harmed.
ideologically they might be
disagreeable but I don't think
they are harmful.
So so chairman Madam chairman I
I so I I can respect your answer
and I hope you can respect my
position to.
I'm just asking all.
You know it is there some room
for common ground.
I believe I've.
You know come to the fifty yard
line is here.
maybe even further so there's
only one sort of Austin two
thirds of you actually going to
the sixty six yard line.
We can do this in tap into our
reserves a little bit
You know is there a way we can
do this without.
Making all these changes just.
Knowing that your brother here
from another mother since that
this could be a problem for our
state.
and madam chair and and
Representative is there another
way up absolutely I mean you
probably could just take the
reserves and and pay for these
are but I don't think that I
think that assumes that these
changes are
are harmful to the state of New
Mexico that these changes are
fatal to the future of the state
and I just don't believe that I
believe that these changes
actually need to be made I
believe that these very tactical
surgical minimal increases the
server to be made and so you
know if if we're gonna
if if if we're gonna
If we're gonna take the approach
that any tax increase in over
gonna take the
you know the the
You know that nineteen ninety
for Newt Gingrich you know we
will never race attacks in our
lives approach I mean I just
don't think that's that's the
right approach I I do think that
these increases are are there
anymore Madam chair
representative they really are
again if we want if if nothing
would have stopped me to you
know from going back to the a
point two I mean that's that's I
mean you go to drafters you tell
him to go a point.
But I just didn't think that was
the right approach you know we
need to have something that
makes sense and to me this makes
sense.
You madam chair chairman you you
know that I'm not the.
Yeah I've never signed the no
tax pledge and you know that I
think all the numbers on my
committee I've never signed that
pledge and we told them why
which is when you do real tax
reform you have to sometimes
raised some taxes you have to
sometimes tax things that were
taxed before.
If it's done in a in a
comprehensive way that also
Direction.
And it pained me it really pains
me
to vote against house bill six.
Because.
A lot of the good stuff in there
was actually.
So I worked on was lifted right
out of my bill some of the some
of the cleanup we've done these
last two years was because that
language is actually copied and
pasted and contracted with.
Stuff that ended up not being
passed and so had a cleaned up.
so it was really not dropping
tears as voting against house
bill six.
And I'm just a I'm sat here to
I'd maybe dropping even more
tears in our voting against this
is by a state elector of working
families and that was that was
in my.
Now my my reforms here I I just
I wish we are looking at
different ways to take care of
that.
so so madam chair Representative
I'm those are the thoughts I
wanted to share I'm happy to
hear that you're other comments
but I'm I've I've used my time
so thank you thank you.
Thank you very much
Representative Harper
Representative Strickler.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Mr chairman
Yeah I I think Representative
Scott Representative Harper
really touched on on many items
I was
wanting discussed so I won't I
won't repeat what they've said I
think
you working families tax credit
To
expand the eligibility is we're
we're an out liar there I don't
think that was mentioned us only
three states that expand the
eligibility there
and then the cost of living
adjustment for elector is
and that's kind of New and
I have a concern about that I
also have a concern about
raising
Or income tax rates and and I'll
and I'll tell you why New Mexico
where you know everybody knows
were poor state and
Are a.
State treasurer Tim Eichenberg.
Representative mentioned to me
that of the lady studies on our
our high income folks in New
Mexico we don't have very many
high income folks in New Mexico
even our high income folks or
poor yeah I never I never really
understood that we we need more
high income earners in our state
in our station a growing.
and and we're trying to get
through this pandemic and we're
trying to open up for businesses
and is we do that I think we're
gonna we're gonna see some
recovery rather quickly but to
raise income tax at this point
time to play for this elector
working families tax credit I
would much rather us consider.
the G. R. T..
Gross receipts tax on food.
We laminated that.
that that created a huge hole in
our tax base we had to raise our
gross receipts tax to it well in
in Farmington San Juan County Mr
chairman madam chair
it's eight point three seven
five percent higher than a.
Our neighbors in southwest
Colorado and
Our low income tax folks they
don't pay.
The gross receipts tax on food
for the most part that's why we
have elector to help offset some
of those costs and the city of
former tennis as advocated doing
some sort of recapturing of the
food tax on food.
The G. R. T. tax on food to help
the short their budgets and it
to me that's a that's a smart
thing to do we can.
raise the gross receipts tax on
food maybe the five percent
whatever it is not a point two
five percent of that would bring
in a lot more revenue than than
this this bill which would bring
in and it's something we should
think about I don't like.
Taxes on food but that's that
was a big part of our tax base
and and that we sense doubled
R. R. a G. R. T. since since
that occurred you also mentioned
Madam chairman and and Mr
chairman that we you know the
the representative tax cuts it
was a fiveyear phase in.
So it wasn't it wasn't immediate
it was graduated and then we we
eliminate the food tax and and
and and in this place we raise
the G. R. T. on everybody.
We raise the taxes on on very
sad Ms spirits up lately
eliminate the deduction on on
property taxes may so we've
raised taxes in other areas to
make up.
for the
reduction and and personal
income tax and and the long term
capital gains so when I hear
that I I have to remind myself
that we we price other taxes
dramatically this twenty
nineteen rice taxes additionally
on cigarettes and I believe on
the vehicle excise tax raise the
personal income tax I mean so
you know we give us and that we
take it away so
we need to remember that the
history there so what are your
thoughts uh gentleman of raising
taxes in this in this we can
economy.
madam chair and and Mr Chairman.
Mr madam chair and and
Representative Eli thanks for
the question I mean I think that
as you know and as you mentioned
in your comments New Mexico's.
Entire tax code is in need of a
revamped.
whether it's gross receipts
whether it's personal income
tax.
Whether it's corporate tax
there's just a lot of work that
needs to be done.
you know I think that the
that the promises made.
for twenty years of guiding the
tax code
have not been delivered.
And I believe that it has been
those working families that we
all speak about.
Frequently in our legislature
are the ones that have to carry
the weight and I think we've
heard from many of them on this
call during public comment
families who are low wage
earners
many of them don't even qualify
for those public benefit
programs that we spoke about
earlier and not because they are
too much money it's because they
don't have a piece of paper from
the federal government saying
there's here
you know in authorise quote on
quote to work.
and so you know if we're gonna
make our economy.
A more vibrant.
Sarah equitable economy.
We're gonna need to ensure that
those of us.
Those of us who can afford to
pay a little more again we're
asking to pay a little bit more
not a whole lot more.
Remember that what we end up
with a big house bill six wasn't
what left the house what we
ended up.
After the Senate.
did its work on the bill we
ended up with a five point nine
percent top rate and even that
was contingent upon other
factors
what is in front of us here
today is a very modest income
tax increase to those who can
afford it.
this is not gonna break the bank
no one bank
and we've made sure.
To protect.
you know those small businesses
with that capital gains
exemption and we made sure to
to to you know not Jack to be
per income tax rates so high
that it becomes some sort of
about life here.
my thoughts on doing this in a
weakened economy I think this is
pry the best time to do this I
think this is a time when we
need to re inject money back
into our economy I think he's
increases select Lichter and
working families tax credit
those are dollars eighty and
they're gonna recirculate right
back no doubt in my mind.
and you know I think that if we
can get this done this year.
this is not the end of it I mean
you raise some important points
about the gross receipts tax
you're right some important
points about the food tax.
you know Representative Harper
and I have had lengthy
conversations about the gas tax
I mean there's so many places
and it's in this tax code word
sore regressive because we've.
Got it different areas with
promises of.
You know economic development in
jobs that never materialized.
And it's been not one party at
fault it's been both quite
frankly
and you know thank goodness for.
Our type of tax committee which
is nuanced in its debate in in
the way we create policy.
And at the end of the day what
we may not agree on what that
final policy looks like I think
we all work hard to be as data
driven as we could possibly be
as we propose as we make these
proposals to the body.
so I feel very comfortable with
this bill I feel very
comfortable in the weights
drafted and I feel very
comfortable in terms of the
timing.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Mr chairman of.
You know.
Why Terry this is tough this is
to a phone for may and
thank all the small businesses
out there and you know we're
struggling and and all our
surrounding states are back in
business schools are open and
we're heading that direction so
which I'm I'm glad that
I think you're getting better
New Mexico with our state's not
growing there's a lot of reasons
for that
people are just not flocking to
our state.
because we're not very business
friendly
that that's you know and again
we've we've got poor education
and high crime that that kind of
compounds the situation those
areas need to be addressed as
well so this is a very difficult
time for for for the state of
Mexico and and for people and
then
You know I pre appreciate what
you've a of yet your explanation
and you're rationing
and the.
I think we need to really work
on the G. R. J. and work on that
food tax us much as I don't like
it but I think that's the that's
our only alternative and I think
it's a better alternative.
to to go that route so thank you
Mr chairman thank you madam

person.
