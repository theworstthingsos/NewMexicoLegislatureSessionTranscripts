Representative Duncan.
Representative Gallegos.
Representative Henry.
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lindstrom.
Representative Martinez.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Pajon, here.
Representative Silva.
Representative Terasas.
Representative Madam Chair
Kadina.
Thank you.
Looks like we have a quorum.
Yes. So for today, uh, we will
be rolling over House Bill 342
and rolling over House Bill 211,
um, 2:11 looks like it has an
amendment that was received late
last afternoon, so that will
show up on Monday's agenda. So
for today, we'll be
Working through hospital 176, it
looks like we have our sponsors
here, followed by HB 213.
Uh, Representative Vincent
Interraas when you're ready.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you committee.
Um, sorry.
Excuse me, I just ran up the
stairs cause.
We're at an education breakfast
this morning and I tried to get
out of there and get here to do
this.
Uh, this bill.
Is the, it's creating the backup
power generator income tax
credit.
And what inspired this bill, uh,
madam chair, members of the
committee is uh we have.
A
P&M is doing a they're they're
working on getting a a public
safety power shut off.
So when the um in like
especially in Lincoln County
we've had a very dry weather we
have overgrown forest, and then
when you add a little bit of
Uh, spark and wind of that.
And it gets into a power line
what what PNMs want to do is
possibly start shutting the
power off on these 60 and 70
mile an hour windy days.
Well, um, as I'm working through
that with them.
The, the problem that's on my
mind is I, I represent
Mescalero, uh, you know, Terrell
County as well as some folks in
Lincoln County and a lot of
those people are on durable
medical equipment.
And I'm talking about not just
oxygen generators but I'm
talking things like a home
dialysis where they have to get
their blood cleaned and um.
What I was thinking is when we
when we drafted this bill is if
we could figure out a way.
To help people.
Uh, if, if a generator was gonna
cost $10,000 and we could at
least give them half of that
back.
Then um what this bill does is
it puts a cap on who can.
Ask for the the voucher, so if
you wanna do the voucher, madam
chair.
Um, you would go through energy,
minerals and natural resources,
and they would give you a
voucher as long as we have an
exceeded the $5 million cap that
they put on it yearly.
Once it gets to $5 million then
it nobody's and this will go on
for 4 years.
And um whenever you call in and
they've met the threshold of the
$5 million they'll just you'll
have to wait till the following
the following year.
So with that, Madam Chair.
I would stand for questions.
My esteemed colleague here would
like to say something.
Madam Chair and in committee
again you know I was gonna cover
for him because I saw him
huffing and puffing up those
stairs, but uh you know this is
a great uh way to help those
people who are exactly what he
said. I don't want to repeat
everything, but we have a
similar situation down in in
Silver City with the Gila
National Forest, uh, and PNM is
trying to do the uh similar uh
deal there and so I think this
would help our constituents
and sponsors will first go to
the public for comment.
Uh, we'll go to Zoom first.
Please raise your hand if you'd
like to speak in support or
opposition to HB 17.
Please raise your hand if you'd
like to.
We'll go next to those joining
us in person.
Please line up if you're
interested in speaking in
support or opposition to HB 176.
Please line up, we'll have an
attendant.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Kim
Lagant. I'm the registered
lobbyist from Mescalero Apache
Tribe. I want to thank the
sponsors for bringing this
forward. Um, this is important
for not only Mescalero tribal
members and our elders, but also
for all New Mexicans to ensure
that uh during uh
Uh, time of crisis that they in
an outage that they um have
their um healthcare needs and
can and can meet those. Thank
you.
Good morning, uh, Madam Chair.
My name is Bernard Treat. I'm a
registered lobbyist for Xcel
Energy in particular
Southwestern Public Service SPS,
um, we serve uh power to the
east side of New Mexico and the
panhandle of, of uh Texas.
I, I come with kind of two
messages uh here today
supporting the sponsor, uh, from
Roswell grew up in the Honda
Valley in Ridoso. I've seen uh
the devastation, the outages
that occur.
And um
Just having witnessed it, I've,
I've greatly value the
importance of legislation like
this.
From the electrical utility uh
aspect. Is we stand in support,
you know, because of the fires
that, that we've experienced.
Uh, the utilities.
Now, uh, most of them.
Uh, we, we do, we exercise what
we call uh safety power shut
off. And that's if the winds are
forecasted to exceed a certain
amount of uh velocity.
We, we shut down the power to
certain areas and we don't lift
that until the wind has
subsided.
And you know, in that part of
the state, it can be 8, 10.
20 hours, it varies, and that's
a long time for some people that
are, that need uh need power to
be without. So we stand in
support. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Any others?
OK, uh, sponsors, any final
comments before we go to
committee?
Madam Chair, one more comment
that I might share during the
fires in June in Lincoln and
Otero counties. I can't tell you
how much food was lost as well,
and we all know what eggs are
costing these days.
And groceries.
And um, not only does this help
the people on the durable
medical equipment, it's also
gonna, you know, help save food
and whenever I talk about this,
this uh backup power generator.
I'm not saying that I want it to
run to electrify everybody's.
Every component in your house,
you're gonna have to pick and
choose, and you might only get
to run the washing machine.
But not the microwave.
And you might get to run your
freezer.
And not your blow dryer. You're
gonna have to pick and choose,
but you do have alternative
power until. Thank you. We'll go
to the committee.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Duncan, I saw you
first. Thank you. um, thank you,
presenters, I appreciate, uh, I
appreciate this bill and um I
had a couple of questions on
page 3, line 2.
It says, uh, in which the
taxpayer purchases and
permanently installs a backup
power generator. What what does
permanently install mean? Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you,
Madam Chair and thank you
Representative Silva, so.
I
I'm one of those people that I
don't want there to be, I got to
thinking and if we don't make it
fixed and permanent.
Then what's going to keep people
from taking their generators to
the lake and running their RVs
with them and, and having, you
know, recreation time, so, um,
in order to keep the, the waste
and abuse down to where it needs
to be it has to be a fixed
generator.
And the way they have the fixed
generators is there's a switch
that's connected to your house
and its senses whenever the
power goes off and then the
generator, it it turns on
automatically.
And you can set these
generators, and I don't endorse
one over the other, but if you
notice some of the um the
commercials that have the
generators on there these things
are designed to, if you want it
to exercise itself.
Every Sunday it'll exercise
itself for 15 or 20 minutes and
um.
My, my thinking is I'm not
saying that it can't be any kind
of alternative fuel, but in my
mind as a fire chief in my
previous life, all of our
emergency communications was it
had backup generators so we
could talk, but everything was
on propane or natural gas, so it
ran clean, it burned clean and
the carburetor stay clean so
that they have maintenance to go
up and do.
Thank you Madam Chair.
Thank you.
I'll just, madam chair, uh.
Pretty much what uh uh.
Representative Vincent said I
I've got one at my home runs on
propane.
Uh, so
Plus it it helps that you don't
have fuel that goes bad.
So if you probably would prefer,
especially if it's fixed and
that's why I like the way this
bill is written is it has to be
fixed. You can't just throw this
in the back of your car and run
around for recreational
purposes. It's more for, because
what are you gonna do when when
when it happens it's gonna
happen and it could happen in
the middle of the night. It can
happen anytime but you're gonna
go out there trying to get this
thing and run chords and all
that. I think this is you want
it fixed so that it um so that
it's prepared in that in that uh
um I can't remember what it's
called it's a switch anyway.
I just just like call it but it
it switches onto uh uh.
From, from regular power to
generating power and exactly
what he says it exercises you
can program it you can run it
remote you can do all kinds of
stuff that's really good. Thank
you.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. Uh, one more question
with this include, um, energy
storage systems like we heard
with HB 51, um, like batteries,
uh, since the definition on page
4, line 5 backup power generator
means a device that
automatically provides temporary
or permanent power when the main
power source fails. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Representative Silva, that,
that question was brought up and
I think it's an outstanding
question in my mind, I wasn't
thinking about solar.
Because for a for a couple of
reasons.
Um, I
I have 3 bass boat.
And um the batteries, the
lithium batteries, I can buy
one.
From my boat it's.
$150 or I can buy.
So I don't know and and the
backup generator, you know, uh,
a generator that's gonna run a
household is gonna be about so
does it include solar?
It says generated power.
So I don't know why it wouldn't.
Now I'm not saying it will.
But we could cut hairs and see
if we could make it work and,
and I would, I would if if it
makes the bill better.
I'm all about, you know, getting
some solar put on it.
Yeah, I, I would appreciate that
clarification because if it does
include solar and it's
refundable tax credit. I think
it, um, it would just hit
multiple.
People that might need this, and
I have both a solar generator
and um old fashioned, um.
diesel generator and both are
great and they serve different
purposes, um, and so I just
think that it would hit a larger
population of people too. Thank
you, presenters.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
Thank you, presenters, um, I
also have a propane.
Generator and
just for specific purposes like
this.
My question is, this is for
residential properties only, is
that correct?
Mister or Madam Chair
Representative Duncan.
We didn't block anybody out.
So it could be commercial, it
can be residential.
Because what I was thinking is
um our hospitals, they do, they
are back, they do have backup
generators, but you know, if
they could get some credit on it
or my, my main reasonings was
hospitals and grocery stores.
And making sure that our growth
power goes.
Thank you very much. Thank you,
uh, Representative. I, I assume
that the hospitals had this, but
I was um wondering about
clinics.
Most clinics that
That I'm aware of anyway, don't
have.
Anything and so I assume that
they may need some of this at
some point in time and so I was
just wondering about that if uh
if they would be eligible. So if
they are.
Ha
Thank you, ma'am. Sure.
Representative Chandler, um, uh,
thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representatives. Um, I
guess I do wanna like make sure
we understand the bill also
includes solar and that actually
does involve making sure the
language is clear, so if this
does come back, um, Madam Chair,
through our, our tax package. I
would like to make sure it's,
it's modified to clarify that
point, um.
So if the sponsors aren't sure,
that means we're not sure um it
means we need to adjust for
that, um, Madam Chair and
Representative.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative Chandler, so.
My intent on this bill was
backup generators that are
combustion engines.
And in the energy committee when
it went through.
I believe it was Representative
Montoya asked me that question
which.
Spark my thought process and I
thought, you know what a what a
great idea that would be.
And um if if somebody wanted to.
And you want me to add the
language to it, I would be glad
to add solar to this as well,
um, Madam Chair, and that I, we
really appreciate that
willingness and we can take care
of that if this is included in
the tax package because this as
the chair will say it's gonna be
rolled because it has a fiscal
impact.
Thank you Madam.
Other committee members.
Representative Montoya.
Yes, uh, Madam Chair, on, on
that point, you, you really have
two routes you could either
Roll the bill, fix it, bring it
back.
unnecessary. It's going to be
tabled today anyway, just
because it has a fiscal impact
and
Anything that is going to end up
in a single tax package.
We have time between now and
when that tax package gets
prepared, you can then fix it.
And then we would pull it off
the table, we'd rehear it.
I would go back on the table.
So, you have a couple of options
there. I just wanted.
Let
You hadn't served on tax. I just
want to make clear how you could
Receipt
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Representative Montoya.
Whatever I can do to make this
bill right.
So people can have durable
medical equipment. I'm 100% in
on that and if that if that is
the best option for us to do to
where it can be heard again, I
would be more than willing to do
that, Madam Chair.
Thank you
Presentative Henry. Thank you,
Madam Chair Representatives. The
one thing I would add, and I
added it in energy as well.
The big use I see for this.
Being raised in Clacroft and I
know we've talked about this.
There was a number of times
growing up and still to this day
we're winning, it snows a lot,
um, those power lines will go
down.
In those back canyons can be out
of power for a week.
5 days
Quite a few days. So my fear
would be.
I want to balance that solar to
combustion because I do see that
the folks in in those mountain
canyons, they don't have the
opportunity to have the solar
plus if you're, if we're out
because of a snowstorm.
I don't, I don't know a ton
about solar, but I'm assuming if
they're under snow, they're
probably not.
Gathering the energy that we
need. So I'd like, I agree 100%.
I would love this bill if we
need to add that, that's great.
But I also want to make sure
that that the intent
Um, for some of those others,
not just windy days, but, but
those those snow days are.
Great havoc in those back
canyons and and in these
mountain villages. So that's
just my two cents.
Madam Chair and Representative
Henry, that's, that's actually a
good, uh, perspective to have.
I'm not against the solar, but.
The times that I am the most
concerned is windy days, which
is probably gonna have sun.
And if they do the public safety
power shut off then we're we're
square.
On the other days for so I serve
Cloudcroft as well as timberron
and its super rural areas and
those super rural areas when you
don't have power for a week and
there's snow.
You're exactly right that, uh,
the.
The solar is not gonna hold up.
It might get you a couple of
days.
But it's not going to get you a
week.
So
if, if that's the way that the
committee.
Uh, Representative Silva.
Representative Montoya, if you
want me to go that route and
representative Chandler on the
solar, if you think it would
make this bill better, I don't
want to limit.
Anyone but for the people that
are on.
The oxygen generators and um.
dialysis machine, that's that's
the intent of this bill, madam.
Thank you, Representative Silva
for the for the 2nd time.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair, I
appreciate the additional time,
um, yes, I completely agree. I
think um this bill could be
better with that amendment, and
I, I think it would give us some
data about what our New Mexicans
getting tax credits for in terms
of battery power generators. I
think this was a question we had
in in another bill that we were
hearing, um, and so, and we just
don't know. And I don't want to
limit folks, um, because like
you said, I think um.
Propane and and gasoline
generators do have um a, a
necessity for very specific
types of homes and places and,
um, I don't want to discount
that, so, um, I just think it
would be good data for us to
collect if we were to include
it, but not prioritize as a
representative Henry named, so
thank you so much. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Representative
Montoya for the 2nd time.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you for indulging me as well.
Um, the reality, I think, uh,
the, the needs.
Uh, in Lincoln County, uh, or
heavily mountainous areas. I'm
sure.
Folks, if they're given the
opportunity, will choose what's
best for them.
However, uh, if let's say
somebody wanted get backup
generation.
In, in Las Cruces.
Where it's sunny most of the
time, very little snow. That
might be an option for them. I,
I think that's why this bill
works if it's agnostic as to
what the source is and people
who need the backup are able to
Uh
To, uh,
choose for themselves. I think
that's
You allow people to make the
decisions best for their family.
I think that's the best thing we
can do. So I, I don't see a
problem with adding that in. I,
I don't see somebody up in
Cloudcroft choosing solar for
the very reason that you
described that that it wouldn't
help them if the solar panels
are covered. However, if it's uh
Let's say windy day, you lose
power in Las Cruces because the
power line went down, they're
likely going to be able to get
that power line back up in a day
or two because it's not going to
be hampered by weather.
So, I think you just leave it
agnostic and as open as
possible.
And make it available to as many
New Mexicans as possible. I
think this is a great idea.
Thank you.
And I'm sure, uh, Representative
Montoya and so, uh, um, the only
thing that I was thinking that
would possibly be important for
us to recognize this since we're
making sure we're cleaning up
the language is that if we have
solar power, it's only going to
work during the day, right?
what happens if we, if
somebody's running their oxygen
at night, so I think it needs to
be coupled or or with um a
backup battery.
Uh, because I mean you, you're
not gonna have power at night.
Or or if they have wind power,
if they want to do wind power,
that's fine.
But they have to have a battery
backup or they can have a
generator that does it on
demand, whatever, whatever works
for them.
But I think if
If we just stick to if the
language is a little too loose
like uh Representative Chandler
said we, we may find ourselves
where someone just says hey I
just want to have a solar. I'm
gonna go
I'll so her in my home. I get
50% of that and and be done.
and lose the intent of of of the
legislation. Thank you, madam
chair.
Madam chair, just one thing that
I like what represented Montoya
said we need to let people
choose what's best for them and.
This bill right here is the
reason I'm here at the
legislature because we've got a
bipartisan bill that we're all
making better and whenever I
bring it back to you.
I think it'll be shiny and
pretty and you'll like it. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you committee for such a
respectful and vigorous
discussion and debate, um, just
before we go to the will of the
committee. I have a couple of
clarifying questions as I read
this bill, it is actually about
personal income tax. So the
conversation and questions
raised about other potential
eligible entities at this point,
as I read this bill are not
covered by the tax credit, so
certainly I think that's a
conversation worth having and
something that we can follow up
with and um learn more about.
showed interest in this effort
move forward.
I also wanted to clarify.
Um
sponsors.
As we've had this kind of
conversation and discussion with
other legislators, including
around.
The backup battery storage that
is built out for other solar and
renewable systems. Um, what's
what I've wanted to share is
that I appreciate and hear your
intention and I am with you
1,000%, especially when we're
talking about the durable
durable medical equipment. It,
it makes a lot of sense to me
that especially for families
that don't have the means to
make this kind of significant
investment in a system that we'd
be proactively considering how
to get them closer to access to
this kind of backup.
So,
The part of your bill attempts
to do that with the
refundability, but this bill
does not have what I would call
like an income test or a cap on
the other way. So for instance,
if we only have.
As it's drafted 5 million to
spend or like when you talk
about tax, tax capacity, right?
We, it would be a spend.
Um
There could be the first people
that have the capital to go get
the systems, go in, go in, get
these systems permanently
installed.
Wait for the the drop on their
tax liability, right? So if you,
if you owe taxes, what we'd be
doing is, um, dropping the taxes
you owe by half the amount of
the system is extra drafted, but
as it's drafted, it could go to
all people who were gonna afford
that system and not have the
financial need, otherwise, it
could all go to people that are
have a gross income of over
250,000 a year.
So I, I what I would say reading
the room is that there's many
people here interested in this
idea, and we can potentially
have follow-up conversations to
see without overburdening the
tax and rev department, what it
would look like to focus in and
really point these um tax
dollars or whether it's
liability or refundable credit
where it's the families that
need it most. So, um, I'll just
leave you with those thoughts,
and yeah, we look forward to the
conversation.
I don't know if you want to jump
in. We're about to go to
committee on this. OK, thank
you, sponsors.
Representative Duncan Madam
Chair, I think I wanted to move
the table before we even start.
moved the table.
Thank you, Representative
Montoya, um.
Do we have a second on that?
OK. No opposition. This bill has
been tabled. Thank you,
representatives. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
And thank you committee thank
you very much and welcome Chair
Lindy.
Thank you, Madam Vice Chair for
running the show. We are now on
House Bill 213, school solar tax
credits.
The floor is yours whenever
you're ready to begin.
For
6, yeah. Give us a quick second.
We just lost forum.
We will, that, that way we're
not holding up anybody. No, no,
that, that, that's a great
suggestion. So why don't we do
this, um, since these will be
this date will be tabled
anyways. We're here, we're here
in a subcommittee that we don't
need an entire quorum that you
may proceed.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you committee um.
HB 213.
is a really great opportunity
for our state and our schools to
save.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
and um.
And um
I think you have before you, um,
this packet.
And the great part of it is it
has no budget impact in 25 and
then it goes on to have um.
A maximum budget impact of 100
million from 26 to 28, and the
um.
New Mexico's
got solar tax credit.
Of 40% saves 40% of of that
project.
I'm going to, once you have this
handed out, um, let my expert,
uh Mr. Rocky Bacchus explained
this, it's um something that um.
I really believe will help our
schools to save.
A lot of money and also.
Make it better environment for
us too. Looks like we got the
handouts. Please proceed.
Mr. Chair, uh, representatives.
My name is Rocky Bacchus, and
I'm gonna go through this
handout, uh, very summarily so
it won't take very long, but if
you go to the 2nd page, which
looks like this.
Um, it hits the primary school
benefits first off.
Uh, schools will save
approximately 70% of their
current electric bills.
And that frees up up to $130,000
per school per year.
There is zero cost share. The
schools do not have to put up
any money at all.
And because there's batteries
involved, it provides a local
shelter situation where the
schools can be off grid for an
extended period of time.
And then it also creates local
jobs, permanent local jobs, not
just temporary jobs.
I'll go further into that.
The next page looks like this,
and it lists all the school
districts in New Mexico, so
every school district in New
Mexico received state funds
would be eligible.
I'm gonna skip to the next page,
and this just has.
A number of the amounts to
schools in various districts.
And what the effect would be on
them, so that, for example,
Bernalillo would save 379,000 a
year. Central Consolidated
664,000 a year.
Gadsden, 1.6 million a year.
Um, Carlsbad 1.1 million a year.
Gallup 1.6 million a year.
Uh, etc. of course the largest
is Albuquerque, which would save
$10 million a year.
And you can look at the ones
that may be in your exact
districts.
Within the next page looks like
this.
And it uh goes over the school's
financial benefits, so again
zero cost share.
And they're only buying
electricity on a power purchase
agreement. They're not buying
any equipment, no capital
purchase. they're only buying
the electricity, so unless the
electricity is provided, they
don't pay anything, but it's
offsetting electricity they
would buy from their regular
utility.
The Provider of the PPA provides
the payment for the installation
using local contractors, is all
maintenance, all insurance and
all of that.
There are multiple PPA providers
in New Mexico now that compete
so that the schools get the best
prices. They're just showing two
possible ones here, son wealth
is a public benefits.
Provider out of Boston area and
next era is the largest.
Solar provider in the world, and
they already have projects in
New Mexico.
Of 100 megawatts of.
When 220 megawatts of solar and
50 megawatts of battery. So
these people are here now.
Uh, next year is about 40 times
the size of P&M just as a point
of reference.
The next page is benefits to the
state.
And so that's, that's the next
page.
So historically
PSFA, the public school.
Facilities Authority has offered
to provide.
Solar two schools typically
offering 90% of the cost.
But the schools had to pay 10%
and they have always said we
have higher priorities, teachers
and other things.
And so they have not done it in
any great numbers. There are a
few that have done some, but
not.
Widespread
With HB 213, the state would pay
40% of the costs in a refundable
tax credit or a transferable tax
credit rather.
Uh, the federal 30% tax credit
is still available.
And I'll I'll speak to that
later, that can be safe harbor
under IRS rules.
And the PPA provider provides
30% of the cost.
If all the schools in New
Mexico, which are on that prior
page.
Converted to solar and
batteries, they would save $42
million per year.
42 million per year for the
next.
I think the state can think of
this in terms of it's an
investment.
If oil prices change or other
revenue things happen, it's
insulating the schools against
costs in the future for a long
time.
In general, they will say
between 4 and 7 times what the
New Mexico tax credit is over
that time period.
The next page looks like this.
It's looking at local jobs.
PPA providers do not bring in
teams of people when you do
solar farms like the utilities
do these big farms that are.
hundreds of acres you may have
seen the one south of
Albuquerque.
Um
They bring in out of state
people they hire temps, they
don't create local jobs, but
when solar goes on schools, it's
done as carports.
Every school I've talked to
doesn't want something on the
roof, they're all wanting to go
carport, so they also get shade.
But that's done by local people,
local GB 98 contractors global
E98 contractors is who that work
goes to because they're doing
the work on the schools now.
Part of the problem is that they
need training.
And so there's gotten a lot
easier, it's gotten more.
Developed, but I, I've just
pointed out one trainer water
solar that does train the
trainers, so we, we met with the
Navajo Nation. They want their
training to be on their
facilities and the trainers will
train their people so then they
can continue training with their
own people that could be the
same for community colleges or
technical training schools or
things of that nature.
That's a way to create local
jobs that continue long term.
The reason their permanent local
jobs is because.
Even 200 megawatts.
Of solar on schools to do all of
them would be less than 10% of
what the energy transition Act
calls for, so there's a lot of
follow on that's gonna be needed
so that they can have continuing
for local businesses and other
things that are there locally.
The next page.
Looks at utility increases.
This is
and uh.
In excuse me, in June of last
year, June of 24 pin and filed
for 30.94% increase.
They in the stipulation have
backed that down to 19.85%
increase right now.
That's a huge increase.
And they then filed for another.
$77 million increase in November
last year, so those are built
still pending before the PRC.
That's a lot of money.
If all implemented in the next.
3 to 4 years that's gonna be a
45% increase on our residential
customers.
They need some relief and this
bill enables the best efforts of
the ETA to happen the Transition
Act.
Because it'll save money
directly for the customers that
do this.
question that then always comes
up, and that's the next example
page here is what about all the
people that don't get solar,
isn't it going to be transferred
from the ones that do get solar
to the ones that don't.
The answer to that is no.
If you look at
Schools putting solar in and
batteries in, and you compare it
just to the $77 million and
that's the revenue request, the
actual capital is about 700
million.
And I'm on the committee, the
pricing committee for P&M, so
I'm I'm directly telling you
what's being discussed.
So
At 77 million, if you reduce it
by not by having schools put in
solar.
It would reduce their revenue by
about 19.
But that offsets.
$24 million.
Of revenue requirement for that
for the utility to build all
this additional amount, which
means that the school's doing
the favor would save everybody
else about an extra 4 million.
So it saves both the people to
do the solar and
So to summarize the bill itself
is this page.
So the solar tax credit would be
40% of the project appraised
value.
The reason we use a praise value
is because that's what the
federal tax credit is used for
large projects because you want
a third party to say what this
was worth, you don't want the
individuals themselves to say
this is what it was worth. So
that's the way the federal does
it and so using the same
methodology, I think is the best
way to eliminate.
Problems
Uh, it's a
Transferable tracks credit. It
has no fiscal impact in 25
because they have to be
installed and then apply for the
tax credit, which means that the
earliest it'll be 26.
And then, and based on the just
the construction schedule we're
probably looking at about 50
million in 26 and then going
maximum credit is 100 million
per year is what's into the bill
right now.
And then the final
Age
Which is this one
Uh, the urgency.
Um,
Not wanting to be political at
all, but the, but the Biden tax
credits.
Of 20% maxed out last year if it
was done last year, there have
been 20% more federal input than
there will be now.
Um
The new administration may cut
the incentive, so there's a lot
of different information we
don't know for sure what's gonna
happen.
But we do know it is school's
contract and 5% of the projects
are started in 25, they're safe
harbored under IRS rules so that
we can lock that in and have
that match, so that's a reason
we want to get.
two schools and I can tell you
that every school district in
New Mexico is in the process of
being contacted now to make sure
they're all aware of this and so
that they can take advantage of.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, um,
The presentations, can we go to
the audience?
Yeah, OK, thank you for the
presentation. Is there anyone
online support or opposition of
this bill?
There's one person online.
Hello, are you there?
Longstone, good morning.
Yes, good morning. My name is
Jean Watson. Good morning, Chair
and members of the committee. I
represent the League of Women
Voters of New Mexico. We support
this bill because of our
position on climate change. We
believe that it's a win-win
situation for schools, as noted
by the uh uh sponsors and
expert, um, and also for those
who contribute to providing this
solar, um, this is
A good time to do this because
uh we need some momentum to
ensure that we are able to
achieve our climate goals. Thank
you very much for bringing this
bill sponsor and expert. Thank
you.
Anyone else?
Someone else is here.
Morning.
Camilla Bibleman.
Mm
Good morning, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee, I hope
you can hear me OK? I'm here in
support of this legislation as a
way to facilitate the
construction of solar on
schools.
Saving schools money on their
utility bills and helping us
transition to a more renewable
grid. Also moving us towards a
way of generating our
electricity that doesn't create
indoor air quality issues for
our kids. Thank you.
Thank you. Anyone else?
Oh, they keep coming through,
OK.
Daniel
Daniel Pritchard.
Good morning, Mr. Chair,
committee members.
Uh, my name is Danielle
Pritchard, and I live in Taos.
I am on the executive board of
renewables, a nonprofit
organization supporting
renewable energy and economic
development here in northern New
Mexico.
Um, on behalf of our
organization here. We fully
support um the uh continued
development and deployment of
solar and support this, support
this bill as an example, the
Penasco Independent School
District is currently undergoing
a complete redesign of their
campus and this kind of
opportunity with help uh that
small community become more
independent on fossil fuels and
and improve the health and
economics of the entire school
district, so, uh, fully support
this bill. Thank you for your
attention.
Thank you Daniel?
All right.
No, nobody in opposition or no
one else stumb line.
OK, very good. Anyone in the
room and up in support, excuse
me, of House Bill 213. Yes, sir.
We have a microphone here and
you can.
Up there. OK, sir. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Um,
members of the committee, Al
Park registered lobbyist on
behalf of the New Mexico Tax
Credit Alliance. Uh, we
appreciate the work of the
sponsor, um, and Rocky on this
legislation and we stand in
strong support of the bill.
Thank you very much, we
appreciate the transferability
clause in the work and we
believe that that will lead to
the economic investment that
will actually drive um the goals
that you heard from the other
folks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, members.
Thank you. Appreciate you being
here. Anyone here else in
opposition of House Bill 13.
Seeing no one that's come back
to the committee. Questions,
comments from the committee.
Uh, represented Lindstrom.
uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
do have a couple questions and
I'm, I'm looking on the page it
says 24 sample school districts.
Mr. Chairman and presenters.
I guess I need to have a better
understanding of how this would
work and we'll use my school
district as the example.
My understanding is is that
there would be a savings of over
$1.5 million to Gal McKinley.
So let me just ask you, sir, who
is the actual likely taxpayer
for that school district.
I, I'm trying to understand your
question, excuse me, Mr. Chair,
Madam Representative of the
likely taxpayers.
For the school district that
would be applying for this.
Who's who's who gets the tax
benefit?
Mr. Chair, Madam, thank you, um.
Or some school districts that
have already committed to this
and signed.
PPA contracts.
Um
Sun wealth, which is one of the
ones that's on the sheet here
would get the tax credits, both
the federal and the state and
then they applied that into a
much lower rate than they would
have without those incentives.
No, I understand that, but my
question, Mister Chairman, is
for the my school district,
which is probably the largest
geographic school district in
the state of New Mexico.
Who has more than one utility
provider, I'd like to understand
how you get $1.6 million.
I mean, where does that come
from except from their utility
bill. Is that where it comes
from or?
Mr. Chair, uh, Madam
Representative, yes, the
reduction from the school
districts cost is the net of
what their utility bill is
reduced by.
Lest the amount of the PPA
payment they would pay. OK, so
Mr. Chairman.
The
Taxpayer that would be
receiving.
This initial discount then could
pass it on to the school
district.
would be Gallup.
Uh, Navajo, uh.
Uh, NTUA.
Uh, the co op, I mean, this is a
very large school district and
has lots of satellite schools
throughout the county.
With lots of um utility
providers. I'm trying to get my
head around who actually would
be the group that comes forth.
Or were they individually have
to do that?
Mr. Chair, Madam Representative.
If I can use dimming as an
example, they have a co op and
they have P&M, so there are
multiple utilities that are
serving multiple schools and
each individual meter.
Is is a separate contract so I
think they had about 24 actual
contracts that add up to the
total for their district, so
their district would save about,
but a portion of it is down in
Columbus, which is 30 miles
south right on the border, then
there's a school in Demming that
are both on Columbus Electric
and then most of all the rest of
them were on EM and so it's
aggregating all that, but each
meter is a separate contract.
Mr. Chairman each meter, I
assume, is for each building or
each different school.
inside the district.
Mr. Chair, madam,
Representative, um,
What we find is that there can
be multiple meters on a given
school, especially high school,
so they may have 1 m on the gym,
they may have a main education
area and another meeting on a
separate building, so if they
have multiple buildings,
typically there's multiple
meters and, and they don't cross
over and but some of them
they're uh.
There's some areas where they
have temporary, uh.
Structures for construction and
so forth, which you're gonna be
there for 30 years, but they
have separate meters, so it's a
per meter basis is the way it's
being done, but there could be
multiple meters even on
relatively small facilities.
Well, Mr. Chairman, as I think
about my own school district,
and I think about how school
budgets work.
The um utility pieces part of
operational costs.
So if madam, uh, Mr. Chairman,
if in our case we got 160 or
1600 and so forth dollars, does
that create disequalization
inside the um.
Budget
For public schools.
Mr. Chairman, Madam
Representative from both.
Um
The
Navajo Nation people that we've
already met with and that
they've reviewed the law and I'm
not an attorney, so I can't give
you a legal opinion, but from
what they've reviewed from what
the attorneys in Deming School
District, Cory School, the
utility bills comes out of
operating funds. It does not get
redistributed back to the state,
so this stays locally and in the
FIR M nerds evaluation part of
what it said was that it could
add 2 to 3 teachers' salaries
that the school district could
then hire with that freed up
money or however they
individually decide Chairman,
how long is this?
Bill is just got a sunset on it?
Is it 10 years or how many in
act.
Mr. Chair, Madam Representative,
the, the bill has assented, as I
recall of uh.
It's it's January 1, 2037 is the
sunset.
I expect that most of the
schools will uh have completed
this work within 5 years.
Mr. Chairman, my point is, is
that inside you're familiar
being part of the education
budget process.
That
Even
A discount
Of
5 $10 million.
Inside
The uh instructional budget.
An operating budget.
For school districts creates
disequalization.
So I'm, I'm trying to understand
then how it doesn't, I mean, I,
I understand savings.
But uh I'm just.
I know the other side of this,
and I understand how the
budgeting piece works and I'm
trying to figure out how we
don't create disequalization.
By providing that kind of a
savings. I'm talking about my
own district here, Mr. Chairman.
Um, over
15 years.
Um
And we fought very hard to keep
that formula in place.
I just try to get my head around
it, Mr. Chairman, I, I can.
Ask these folks offline, but I'm
just curious as to how it
actually works. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you. Your questions
are appreciated
this um.
It is open to all the different
schools just to pay a lower.
Um, utility bill.
So if it's open to everyone and
they are able to make these
savings just like they would if
they were trying to buy um
textbooks at a place that was
less expensive or, you know,
other things this.
Wouldn't, you know, change the
equalization.
Mr. Chairman, I would disagree
with that. It sounds like it's
very complicated for school
district like mine and the
school district you used as an
example with 2 or 2 or 3
different power sources. That
means that each one of them are
gonna have to have a purchase
agreement for each one of those
facilities.
And that means that if you don't
have the manpower to do that the
first people to provide the
oversight, you're probably not
gonna do it.
And I think at the end of the
day it's gonna be, it's gonna be
hard to set up, at least for
some of these school districts.
Thank you. Thank you. Let's move
on. Let's move on from that to
uh represent Montoya.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
Representative, um, we did hear
this bill in uh energy.
And I would kind of like to uh
go back to some of the
Discussion there. Um,
And, and the question is,
Does this
Um
tax break or this uh um
Yes, since tax break, is it
necessary?
For schools.
Um
Is there not savings already.
If they were to go and do
Solar and just just to jump to
the, the end.
The, I believe the answer that
we got to was without the tax
break.
Schools that have tried this
have not seen a, a reduction.
From that time until now,
Uh
And looking at the bill a little
closer.
I don't see any guaranteed
savings for the school.
Um, there's nothing written into
the, the bill that says
That the school has to receive
the savings. It appears as if
that's not in the bill.
But that the school.
Has to negotiate for those
savings.
That if if a
Whoever it is, and, and I, I
also understand it doesn't have
to be an in-state taxpayer who
does this. It can be
Company out of
Virginia.
That claims the tax break.
There's no guarantee that the
savings are passed on.
to the school district.
It's not guaranteed in the bill.
It doesn't appear as if
This happens and then that
total amount of that tax break.
Has to be transferred to the
schools. I don't see that in the
bill.
Am I missing that, or is this,
or is it expected?
That each of the schools have to
negotiate this.
And at that point.
One company
That goes out and and and and
does this and negotiates with
the school could negotiate.
half of the amount of the tax
break.
I passed on in savings 25% of
the tax break is passed on in
savings to the school, 3
quarters, it, it, it appears as
if
That, that, that, that
negotiating and and and and I
just in in what I just heard
from uh Representative
Lundstrom, we're expecting
school districts who may not
have that expertise in doing so.
And they're dealing with a
company that comes in to
negotiate with them.
would have the advantage in the
negotiation over that, and then
we would have have unequal.
application from school district
to school district or from
school to school within the
school district.
So
How do we guarantee with this
bill?
equal application
Of the savings to the school
districts.
Or that all of that savings,
which is what I would prefer,
otherwise we're giving
New Mexico taxpayer dollars to
an out of state company.
A non-taxpayer in New Mexico.
How do we guarantee that the
full amount
Of that savings.
Goes to the schools cause that's
what we're asking the taxpayer
to pay for.
Mr. Chair in Montoya.
Um
There's a couple of questions
you ask in there so I'm to try
to answer all of them. So first
off, um.
Electric utilities don't have
the same rates across the state,
there's basically, in my view,
for utilities, PNM, SPS, El Paso
Electric, and Tri-State.
Tri-State serves virtually all
of the co-ops who then
distribute, but those are the
because they have different
rates and different rate
structures in different
anti-competitive practices.
In some districts
Solar only is great in other
districts it needs to be a small
amount of solar and a lot of
batteries and what they're doing
and that's why the incentive.
Needed to be substantial in
order to make it work
everywhere.
That was one question. The
second question I heard was, um,
you want to know how you make it
equal everywhere and make sure
that the savings get passed on.
There's two answers to that.
First off.
The legislative.
Legal, and I may get working
with an attorney here in the
legislature and he's been doing
the updates to the bills.
So last year we wanted to have a
certain minimum savings amount
in the bill they told us that
wasn't going to pass legal
muster that that, you know,
competition issues and whatever
that we couldn't put a specific
savings amount in there.
So that was one issue. The
second is that uh how does
competition happen to get the
schools the best situation and
how do they get the paperwork
all done.
So let me get the initials
wrong, but I think it's CES
provides.
All kinds of things on it and a
statewide.
Competition basis in the effort
to all their members, and I had
a meeting with their head guy
yesterday and he said that as
soon as this.
I passed they'll send out notice
to everyone they already have, I
mean, they do everything from
pens and papers to air
conditioning equipment and
solar. I think they have 5
different solar companies that
are on their list they've
already done competitive bidding
with they provide all the
contracting, all the
information, so all the school
has to do, say yes, we want to
do this. Here's what this vendor
says their savings are gonna be,
it's all in writing, they have a
30 year pricing all.
Put into the contracts are about
23 pages, but.
They have their attorneys or
whoever review it or they trust
CES to review it.
a statewide basis, so even the
smallest of.
Schools that may only have.
10 students
And do this in its practical
form, especially using CES and
using CES's review to make sure
they've gotten the best prices.
So thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative and Mr. Bacchus.
So,
So you were told there was no
way to put in.
The bill that all of the savings
that the
Bender or the provider.
would receive
That all of that savings, there
was no way to guarantee all that
savings could go back.
To the school district.
Is that
What you just said, Mr. Chair
Representative.
I said that the legal people
told me that.
They
Exceedingly strongly opposed
trying to do something of that
nature, I can't, I'm not an
attorney, I can't tell you that.
Legally, that's correct, I know
that they posed it so strongly
that we took it out.
OK, thank you. um, um, Mr.
Chairman and Representative,
yeah, that's a concern for me,
um, the concern being we take
New Mexico taxpayer dollars.
The beneficiary of that.
Doesn't even have to be a New
Mexico taxpayer.
And
There's no guarantee.
Of what the return would be to
the school district.
That coupled with the state
equalization.
Um
Uh
Issues that we have.
There might not be any incentive
when it's all said and done to
the school district to even care
whether or not they're getting a
good deal.
Because
They might see one year, but by
the next year, the state
equalization.
Uh
Uh
Comparisons will take place and
then it'll be
So I, I'm not exactly sure.
If the intent is to benefit.
A school. I don't know that we
will have that guaranteed that
that school will get that.
Maybe the state eventually
might, if all if if if everybody
does it.
But
I
I'm just very concerned in the
end that it doesn't even have to
be a New Mexico taxpayer.
That's, that's very concerning.
We're gonna do tax breaks. We
need to make sure that New
Mexicans benefit from the tax.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Montoya. Anyone else, uh,
questions or comments from the
committee.
Sarah Duncan.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've just
got a couple of questions for
you.
Um
Let's let's just tell you this,
this becomes law.
And next January.
Um, and
30% goes away totally.
How does that impact the school
district?
It's already put the.
Mr. Chair, Representative
Duncan.
If the school district's already
put it into place, they have a
contract with a third party PPA
provider and that PPA provider
takes all the risk on any tax
incentives or so forth. The
school already has a locked in
price, so it would not affect
them at all if the tax.
Situation changed. It would
affect future contracts that
might be done later who would
then say, OK, we don't have that
anymore, so we're not gonna
discount it as much as we did.
Previously when we did have a
30% federal tax credit.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So,
That's a guarantee that
contracts in place for the next
how many years did you say that
was?
Representative 30 years is
typically what we see.
OK. Thank you. I think that's
great. Um.
The other question on the
Example impact on P&M.
What sure what if PNM continues
to build this huge solar fields.
Um, and let's just say they
build another 5.
Acres and
I'll, I'll take my school
district, for example.
Uh, 500 acres in my school
district.
So
This then will change.
Am I correct in saying that?
Mr. Chair Representative, um,
P&M has to get permission
through the public regulatory
commission to build those assets
to have them guaranteed.
They are constantly looking at,
OK, what else is happening, what
is required for P&M to build as
opposed to someone else.
If a school district has a
interconnections from whatever
you tell whether it's P&M or El
Paso Electric or whoever, but
they requested interconnection
and that interconnection fact
will go into their planning
schedule.
And I'm on their rate.
Committee as a as a volunteer,
but.
All of that information comes in
on a continuous basis in order
to apply for additional.
Uh, projects to be built.
They're
Roughly gonna be at 40% in the
next two years of needing to be
100% non-carbon. So there's a
long ways to go, so if this is
done over the next 5 years, it
absolutely is going to be taken
into account because there's no
benefit to overbuild or to build
something that someone else is
taking care of.
It's much less expensive for
the, for the ratepayers if it's
done privately than if it's done
by P&M.
Or the utility. Thank you, Mr.
Chair and thank you for that
answer, but you didn't answer my
question. Well, let's just say
that P&M bills 500 acres in CCSD
district 500 acres in in
McKinley County 500 acres in
Silver City, 500 acres in
Artesia.
This is going to change the
numbers on this sheet. Am I
correct?
Based on the amounts you just
gave me, no, it would not. It'd
have to be a lot more than that.
OK. Thank you, Mrs. I'm not sure
that
Not sure that that's accurate.
Thank you for that.
One last question, Mr. Chair.
Um, I believe charter schools
are included in this, is that
correct?
Mr. Chair Ibsen if, yes, they
are. OK.
Um
What about private schools?
We have, we have parents who pay
taxes.
The fund public schools.
They choose to put their kids in
private school, so we're trying
to benefit those kids.
Why did we leave private schools
out of it?
Mr. Chair Representative, uh, we
spoke with the state education
department and all the schools
that they are currently funding,
which included the charter
schools if a private school is
getting state funding.
Um, well, let me step back my
list only includes what's on the
state's website for charter
schools and for public schools
as far as the bill is concerned,
there is not a limitation that
says a private school couldn't,
it says any school.
And then also there's a separate
designation for any higher
education within the city, they
have to be buildings located in
the state of New Mexico, but it
does not prohibit a private
school.
From applying.
It says public school.
It was a private school, a
public school.
There's a couple of designations
there.
Mr. I'm just curious.
If, if private schools, if they
chose to do this, if they came
in contracted with your company
and said, would you do this on
our school as well?
That's the only
On
Mr. Chair Representative, um,
I don't do the works I'm a
consultant to a number of
companies that do, but I don't
do it myself just to
clarification, uh, if a.
If a private school came to to
me and asked for consultation on
it, I would check with the
attorneys to determine if they
would qualify as a public school
or not and if they could have
this incentive or use some other
incentives that are also
available.
Um, I don't believe there was
any intent to exclude.
Private schools, but this is the
way it was written and based on
the input at the time and based
on the fact that the state
publicly funded schools
absolutely affect everyone in
the state and the taxes they
pay, so there's a benefit to
everyone in the state at the
public schools are benefiting.
Thank you, Mr. Sharon and like
has been said before, words
matter.
And then they're not included in
this, so I was just curious
about.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Duncan. Let's go to represent
Parajun.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh,
representative and expert,
thanks for bringing this bill. I
have a just to clarifying
questions, uh, the first is
about priorities and um if you
could explain some of the
information that you've provided
here and then also in our FIR
why schools have such expensive
electric bills, um, in the in
the FIR uh from.
The bill analysis from tax and
Rev, they say that APS expenses
$50,000 a day on um on
electricity.
Mr. Chair.
Uh, Mr. Chair, um.
Madam Representative.
Um
I have almost a 50 year history
in utilities across the United
States, California Public
utility, etc.
And
The way that.
Electric bills get divided up
and I've been doing this for
over 10 years as a as a uh
intervener on.
New Mexico utilities, the way,
in my opinion, that rates get
divided up is whoever doesn't
speak up gets charged more.
That's not how it should be, but
that's how I believe it is.
The school districts have not
been intervening in the raid
cases. They're not showing up to
the table when it the pie is
divided on who pays what.
And
We're working to change that
with at least a few school
districts that we expect to have
joined in the current rape case
which still has an opportunity
for them to participate in the
the rape case.
is closed, but the one for the
77 million is still open for
another few weeks.
The way it's divided up is he
who does not speak up gets
charged more.
Um, Mr. Chair and um Oxford,
thank you for that answer, um,
so I mean, it sounds like there
there are some issues with the
rate negotiations are not
showing up. I asked this
question more because um, I'm
wondering.
About the electricity
consumption and I sat on
education before for um uh a a
year and then now I'm here, but
one of the things that I did in
my district is I went to all the
middle schools, um, and some of
the elementary schools and um
the reason why they're
electricity bills are so high is
because like they don't have a
roof.
And I wish that like actually
some of the middle schools in my
district, um, are in really,
really dire need of repairing
their roofs, and they showed me
areas uh part of where the roof
attaches to the walls where they
are air conditioning their
rooms, but that air is just
escaping, and so.
Um, I appreciate like the
bringing this bill, and I think
also there's there's other
pieces too that need to be built
out before that, um, you know,
before we're we're spending all
this money for solar in order to
um to provide electricity to
buildings that can't, I mean,
some definitely can, the newer
ones can, right? Um, but to some
of those buildings that can't
even hold um the HVAC systems
that hold the um the electricity
used to uh in their, in their
system.
I mean,
Mr. Chair, frame.
Praying, um, wires in in my
schools and um.
Buildings built too long ago and
not updated, um, enough.
I have a question, Mr. Chair,
and um representative if.
tax and reg recommends that
there would be a requirement,
um, put into the bill that would
um, be a a requirement.
Asking for an agreement uh to
purchase to install the system,
uh, between the taxpayer and the
school is it are there?
Problems with an amendment like
that, uh, Mister Chair and
Representative.
Mr. Chair, madam, uh,
Representative, if I understood
your question correctly, what
you're saying is, could you
leave out the third party that's
funding it and have just the
state do the work instead.
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, Mister Chair and expert
says here on um page 3 of the
tax and rebbe IR that they
suggest that there should be a
requirement for an agreement
between the school and the
taxpayer to purchase and install
the system, uh, so there would.
Sort of what folks have been
talking about here just how uh
an amendment like that would
work, Mister Chair.
Mr. Chair Representative, um,
there is an when the when a PPA
is signed that is an agreement.
It
Includes having to have permits
locally and interconnections
locally. The school is agreeing
to have the system there to
provide the electricity. The
main thing that the PPA provides
is the money, so the school
doesn't have to take it out of
or find somewhere to come up
with a matching amount so that
ultimately this is.
In simplest terms, it's saying
you have another utility
providing electricity to the
school at a lower price and they
don't have to involve any more
than they are with their current
utility. They're just buying the
electricity, which in almost all
cases looks like it's gonna be
on carports.
And then connected into their
power system.
And if you have a school that
you you were mentioned that has
an open roof or something where
HVAC is being wasted and that's
later corrected.
And that electricity can go back
into the grid and be sold to the
utilities. It varies by
utilities to how much they pay
they pay more for some months
than other months but that can
be additional revenue back to
the school if they wind up
fixing those other issues.
Mr. Chair and an expert, this
will be my last question.
It sounds like.
We're building and, and this was
one of the questions I also had
for the battery storage. It
sounds like you're building out
infrastructure.
Based on each school, and I
think it's already been
mentioned rather than building
out infrastructure that um would
be serving like the whole city,
for instance, it sounds like a
utility that we're making.
Like
You're essentially, I think Mr.
Chair and, and I think what
you're saying expert is you're
moving that school from.
The broader utility spectrum and
allowing them to create their
own utilities on the camper.
Uh, Mr. Chair and Representative
Potter, um, the.
school will become
self-sufficient and which is
really great because if
something happens to the other
utilities within the community,
they could always have the
schools a safe harbor, because
they will have the backup and
storage and things like that, so
it's actually,
you know, good safety also.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative.
Thank you represent Parajon. We
do have another comment from or
question from represent.
Short I almost call you Zamora.
I just saw him a while ago.
Sorry, that's terrasas. Thank
you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
committee, real quick, just, I
mean, just listening to the
discussion, you hear a lot of
things and, and, and I
appreciate the discussion. Thank
you for bringing the bill, but
I, I think
to me after all this discussion,
there's some issues, but
You know, it could be as simply
as uh as simple as this as PD or
the school's going to negotiate
their rates, do a little bit
better job doing that, and I
don't know if this has been
done, uh, Mr. Chair.
Uh, and, and representative just
change uh all the fixtures and
I'd, I'd love to see a bill
that.
Reduce power by just changing
the fixtures and putting them
LEDs, did that on all my big
buildings and.
It really made a uh
One time expense is done.
That there and there's very
little maintenance, so.
I thought I'd say that real
quick. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Representative uh Tarasas, uh,
any other questions or comments?
Looks like there's none. We
appreciate your presentation
this afternoon. I, I think
there's a number of questions
that are very valid that this
committee asks and uh and and
and one that I think that I
think of in regards to
Something that represented part
of home brings up in regards to
their our our disarray in some
cases are, are.
Our schools themselves are are
falling apart and I think I
heard this in LFC this past
summer, the beginning of the
school year where uh the school
classroom just too hot, right?
And so they were coming to the
legisl like we need to do.
Air conditioners
And then we come to find out and
we look at the reserves and how
much money they have in
reserves. It's, it's a problem
that we have in this school in
the school districts, so I
would, I would call upon them to
really look at what they can
provide for for themselves and
in regards to what they can
provide for themselves, but I
would also encourage that we
also look at the public school
capital outlay as, as an option
too in terms of kind of do
things that we have already
things set up in that way to
address these types of issues.
So that being said, Madam Vice
Chairwoman, would you please?
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move to
the table.
2:13
He seconded by Representative
Duncan, uh, you know,
opposition, we appreciate again
your presentation. I appreciate
you committee members. We'll see
