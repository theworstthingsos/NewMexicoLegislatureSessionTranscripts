back to the building of the
pensive.
the housekeeping before we begin
at the Sanchez requests we have
House Bill three fifty three at
Bill B. but the ones that have
been rolled into one.
Which means the day we have a
repeated gender
and and with with the hospitals
thirty eight house bill one
twenty four for the people we
begin with thirty eight I do
want to brag on this committee
that on Wednesday we apparently
broke the world record
for bills heard in one sitting
in this committee so I want to
thank all of you for work for
really your your hard work we do
up up the road at seven well
I don't know that there would be
jobs to get in the future but
that's something that I will
probably I think it goes to the
point where we can do a lot of
the work collectively and
hopefully without stifling
discussion or comments or
anything like that in a way we
can still come back and in it
discuss business three thanks
for the state so I want to just
mention that thank you for the
committee's work on that date
that included today I want to
get with house bill thirty eight
rural health care practitioner
additions if you recall of of
this is that this is the bill
that we had for earlier on in
the session and after great
build discussion the sponsor was
amenable to taking some ideas
back meeting with the folks at
preparing a new bill of the
steps to protect we have here
this morning with us and I want
to just first thank that the the
committee supply the sponsor of
this piece of legislation for
your your your diligence and you
commitment to to this initiative
for for doing the work that I
think this committee asked if
you and I think it's only fair
that what what people do that we
obviously bring it back as soon
as you can so that we can give
it another day another hearing
where you can explain to us
exactly you do it differently
that we can feel comfortable
about it mostly C. as part of
the greater tax tax package so
with that we have a committee
substance of elector.
The second okay second
Representative you have a
committee substitute can you
like to do that you have to
register you identified the two
to the number.
it's
two two four seven nine six
point one okay and that right
now.
And it's been moved and
seconded.
So whenever we whenever
everybody has a population of.
You can see that the bill okay.
Okay.
Thank you Mr chair members of
the committee it truly is an
honor to to be here this morning
in terms of presenting the
substitute bill for House Bill
the committee's upper house bill
thirty eight and I think it's a
testimony testament is the most
chair to
Kind of the.
The new direction that this
legislators season going forward
in terms of dealing with the
needs and the issues of our
rural communities especially in
this particular case Mr chair
the rural health care
practitioners in rural New
Mexico and Mr chair as we know
house bill thirty eight adds up
provide you categories the real
health care practitioner tax
credit act in these new
categories are pharmacists
registered nurses social workers
here health counselor and
therapists and physical
therapists and the Mr chair
in the first hearing on this
bill
we did pass an amendment.
And also the committee through a
very and heightened and vigorous
debate make some recommendations
and those recommendations were
that that we incorporate the
suggestions Mr chair in the
analysis regarding and hence the
reporting
both the health department in
the Jacksonville Department
regarding the the credit and the
applicants for the press and the
other a point Mr chair was the
need to read the fine rural.
And so if we go to our.
page three
on page three of this
in the lines five through
fourteen we incorporate that
issue that came up regarding
registered nurses and because of
their thirty six because of
their
thirty six hour work week three
days on four days off
of the original bill did not
qualify registered nurses for
the full credit so we came in
with an amendment that the
committee adopted but that I
appropriated into this up and
that's where we see that
language regarding the hours
necessary for the full credit
for the registered nurses and
also the hours required for the
half credit and again that's on
lines four through fifteen on
page three and Mr chair also
if we go to
page for the lines ten through
eighteen we look at the the
amendment that was recommended
in the analysis regarding the
additional reporting
requirements and we will
incorporate all those suggested
items in that
it in in the in on that page in
those lines just not chairman
and then lastly.
Mr chair we go to our the last
page and this is where on the on
the item for eight seven
we we deal with the.
With the recommendation that the
committee yes those with which
was redefining rural to where we
make it more relevant to the.
To the rural health conditions
or the role conditions in New
Mexico and for that Mr chair I'd
like to yield to the sequel with
the nurses association to
explain to you the research that
you did and how we came up with
this new definition of rural to
meet the the suggests a proposal
by the committee.
Thank you representative Garcia
Mister chair members Linda
Siegel for the New Mexico nurses
association and and other health
care providers that are in this
act and what we do during the.
Thank you for with that is there
somebody's already been our
alarm clock.
The gate shut up.
sorry probably.
Proceeds.
It's a breeze are.
I try to.
Jobs we know that during the
course of this bill that
dear Rajan and the tax
department changed what the
determination of what was urban
what was real and who qualified
they went to a federal standard
when we had had a state standard
and so a lot of people that
lived in what we consider non
urban areas were no longer
qualify so.
You know we don't have health
care infrastructure outside of
the big cities so even if you
were in Los Lunas or but land
you're driving along what you're
driving over an hour to get to
Albuquerque and a lot of our
providers that try to serve
those areas they still need to
be considered
one zero as far as the tax
credit goes because they are not
practicing with them now a large
municipalities so we have
suggested that
That rural that the definition
change so that Albuquerque Rio
Rancho Farmington was basically
runs well in a ten mile zone
around those areas are
considered urban there pretty
much everywhere else except Los
Alamos would be
our rural areas.
I'm not sure exactly yep that's
the language you use ten miles
outside of the city.
Thank you and that.
I
there
are a few special
Mr chairman that's that's pretty
much it in terms of of this up
and well we've been tasked to do
regarding those concerns okay
very good thank you again this
this up you know I.
That it would look at the
audience for for I don't I don't
and I don't okay alright alright
I'm tough and.
The time.
We could probably do it but
I I think since we've already
heard it depicts lanes less that
we've got to that process I will
get without doing that but I
thank you for what you've done
is dedicated your the subject is
one that we can be right it is
so that being said first on my
list we have Representative
Chandler.
Thank you right here is perfect
up when we started talking about
the new definition for.
So Mr chair I'm trying to
understand first of all what is
a city.
Well there's more.
Representative city with a
population greater than fifty
thousand.
According to the most recent.
Yes I this isn't like a trick
question the reason I'm bringing
it up is.
What's the definition of a CV.
You know we have municipalities
the you know on this and that so
I'm trying to understand in this
in terms of static so I'm not
trying to be tricky I really I'm
not Mr chair I mean in the world
of our world we things are
defined.
And city is like a common word
not necessarily a legal
description.
Yeah so I'm just concerned that
confusing.
So that's one issue and then hi
you listed off a bunch of
cities.
could you repeat those Mr
Chairman representative.
Mr chair.
So those with the population of
the greater the barrels and.
Number of times in the last.
Okay so anything.
With that that are fifty miles
at least ten miles outside of
those.
Areas would count as rural.
Mr chair researcher.
In this definition.
Okay I guess all of this of
those places that Mr chair that
you've decided actually
municipalities I think.
It just in terms of you know I'm
not trying to meet the need that
I think that some more correct
term Mr chair just those are my
that's my comment.
That's the very opposite of.
Thank and then Mr chair up with
some women this I'm not Russell
also is under fifty thousand in
the latest census.
What we find out we will tells
us with us with your questions
on this but to do Representative
point that so if your definition
of.
Rural being.
anybody that is at least ten
miles outside of the city with a
population within fifty
thousand.
And and so Albuquerque the state
Albuquerque for for instance and
and I guess my reference point
would be out of all the.
Right that that that is rural my
consideration it's less than ten
miles away from Albuquerque what
they need to be part of this.
what is that mission at this
point but Mr chair
Bernalillo of light the the
south valley.
Is considered underserved.
So this legislation applies to
both rural and underserved
areas.
So that's where these these kind
of.
Townsend communities
that are within the the
municipality would also fall
under that category of
underserved okay.
I understand thank you.
Yeah
that's why we did the fifty
thousand because we wanted to
capture Farmington wonder
capture Russell as well okay
okay any other questions
Representative just got.
We should.
you Mr chairman and
representative Scott yes it is
in the in the federal
definition.
We're we're we're using
underserved in regards as to
what the the CDC the CDC.
Use as as underserved.
But it is it is it is a federal
statute in terms of the
definition of underserved.
Well and Mister chair I think
that that we're we're capturing
the federal definition in the
way that that.
that under service identified as
but it's not it's not defined.
In in the legislation
It's.
You're in the service area eight
seven
right into health care
underserved area means of your
graphic area factors location in
which it has been the term by
the German now through the use
of and this is another standards
set by the department of health
the sufficient health care
services are not being provided.
So that's where we capture that
definition of under served.
Representative what this.
Thank you to have a look at.
Okay anybody else the questions
and comments correct I would.
Thank you Mr chair
representative so on page seven
it says any part of the state
that is at least ten miles
outside of the city with a
population greater than fifty
thousand so my concern is that
if you're talking about the self
valley.
the south valley is not ten
miles outside the city limits.
it's adjacent to the city
limits.
Mr chair Senator Randall.
At what I stated earlier that's
something that is considered
underserved yes so so is there a
place in here that says or
underserved areas yes it is.
Chair
And the.
Your from each one of text files
into the to the mix of tax
return was not anything no other
individual.
Was eligible was ineligible
healthcare practitioner and this
provided health care services in
New Mexico in a rural health
care underserved area.
In a taxable year may claim a
credit against the tax
liability.
I
Mr chair and representative that
maybe it needs to be added.
In this area as well somewhere
because.
You're defining your role is and
you're you're creating a
disturbance requirements.
Mr chair and.
And I don't know that that.
That definition on page two is
going to translate to the actual
distance requirement.
Mr chair representative off but
there is.
The civic language in terms of
of on that page that I don't.
Capture every is like the cell
phone.
and and okay let me let me just
take a quick look here.
health care underserved area
means a geographic area
practice.
I'm just worried that when they
interpret Act it doesn't it's
not specific.
Mr chair and representative this
is that this is the.
The
this is what the hell Department
of our state is determined to be
active determine the self value
to be an underserved area.
and and the language that we
have in the bill in the some
kind of conforms
right to that
wants to that would you consider
maybe and page seven.
Adding something that says up
with the exception of
underserved areas because there
might be other areas besides the
staff allocate.
that are within not within that
ten mile radius.
I'm just wondering if you would
at if you would consider adding
additional friendly amendment in
there that says
With with with the exception of
underserved areas and then it
would be eating inclusive.
To me that the Representative
and.
So that yeah I guess that we ask
that up.
What exactly are you trying to
get at this point.
It seems to me in regards to
what what the sponsor presented
addresses I think a lot of our
concern that we had already that
this point and but I asked the
question about rural and then
you give the the explanation
about Walt whether it Bernalillo
the stock values Anders
underserved right
he he pointed to get page seven
line seven through.
Right section to that you can
almost see the fines that
captures it all so I I I would
be worried to do to amend this
on the fly to do that and and
it's not capture the intent that
the sponsor once but I'm often
that if your bills are.
Okay Mr chair if if he thinks
it's fine but I just worry that
when people are attributing it
that they know that there are
underserved areas in Albuquerque
and it may not just be the south
valley it maybe places like the
south east.
Area of town that are
underserved
it maybe places like some places
in the valley that are
underserved.
Mr chair Senator thought of all
the health.
Our state has declined those
areas.
Okay so they're already the
update over that I'm I was that
Mr chair thank designated
Areas in our state at this point
Representative Townsend
something that yeah Mr chairman
provided the.
The health of their website.
In the definition for vulnerable
and underserved populations.
The broad it is the department
of health and Human Services
characterizes underserved
honorable and special needs
population as community.
That included members of
minority populations for
individuals who have experienced
health disparities.
Latino population African
American populations eight five
slash eight in populations I'm
not sure what that is.
Refugees individuals with
limited English proficiency and
others and postsecondary
graduating students who did not
have coverage options to have
parents plans student plan or an
employer plan.
No mothers and women with
children individuals with
disabilities Medicaid eligible
consumers who are not enrolled
in despite being eligible for
Medicaid.
I don't know the weakest we did
capture.
Mr chair and representative
Johnson and that's exactly what
we capture on page seven except
in the in the in a condensed
version of the you know what
eight I slash eight in
populations are Mr chair bill
within the dean of the American
Indian and the other.
What.
American idol.
But it sounds like a very
comprehensive based on the
definition of that thousand
provided then how you captured
within your bill of so I I would
hope that that would be able to
create
certainty within your within
your bills that there's no
ambiguity came here so
Representative Townsend Mr chair
Hey with that I just want to
make sure that because there are
populations in south Broadway
Martinez to have X. that are
that are within the city limits
that are underserved thank you
you anyone else question to
comment on this bill.
If not I get that I I appreciate
you you're going back to the
drawing board taking into
account the comments that we
offered here this committee
because obviously we want to do
things for rural New Mexico just
as well as we wanted to do for
the New Mexico as well but the
fact the to get back in the work
of this need to keep operated
comments or concerns that we had
as well and brought it back and
we we can now
So we have this list now and we
can add to it and then we can
see how it fits into the package
we appreciate it but obviously
it doesn't pass the HSA because
people to back to the left of
the table to see all the
corporate into the tax package
but what you've done it is
fantastic and I appreciate that
thanks committee which the
receipt to do so at this point
the kids make a motion to be
tabled education.
The table second by
Representative.
any opposition to that motion
saying that Representative thank

And Representative there are a
lot of other things to pay for.
Keep it keep it handy.
Thank you Mr chairman of the
committee thank you Sir thank
thank.
Okay let's move on up to
Representative
It's either that have.
House bill one twenty four that
would tax rates and definition.
Representative whenever you are
ready the floor is yours.
Thank you Mr chair members of
the committee
Kind of an intimidating
Committee I've.
so one twenty four I know you
heard bill one twenty three a
few weeks ago which is similar
that was going to raise the tax
on all nicotine products this is
a this is a bill that
essentially raises the taxes on
everything but cigarettes
because cigarettes are taxed
much higher than other nicotine
products and the reason I I I
served for several years as the
chair of the tobacco revenue
Madam oversight committee and we
have learned through the years
that
that kids the one thing that
will keep kids from starting its
price
so what this tries to do to
prevent our kids from becoming
addicted to nicotine.
So
It it improves the definition of
E. cigarette in the since I've
been here since two thousand
thirteen we we passed the bill
and then big tobacco comes along
with it with that loophole and
so we're trying to tighten
things up so that that whether
it's a new path
natural or synthetic nicotine it
would be captured under this act
it improved the definition to
reflect the current array of
products and to better withstand
changes over time it raises
excise tax for the position
acquisition just about tobacco
products from twenty five to
thirty one percent of the
wholesale price.
And it does not raise cigarette
taxes all but requires all other
products to come up to the left
to the current cigarette right
and we we those of you I don't
know if any of you are on health
and Human Services interim we
had doctors the donors who is
that new Paul Ross thank you and
am I don't know exactly hit of
the mid school essentially in
he's an addiction knowledges and
he told us repeatedly that the
gateway drug to all other drugs
is nicotine so we're trying to
protect our kids with this and I
have to experts and they can
present very shortly very
briefly and then the.
And then we'll be done and ready
for questions.
Thank you madam chair merit Mr
chair and members of the
committee Linda Siegel for the
American cancer society cancer
action network and we just want
to.
Talk about how we tax other
tobacco products first of all as
you know we don't tax synthetic
nicotine and so my hash is
gathered all of these tobacco
other tobacco products and this
one is synthetic nicotine little
pouches.
We don't there's no tax on this
except gross receipts tax no
tobacco tax no twenty five
percent of the product value
nothing zero tax on this product
which is used quite quite a bit
because of the high nicotine
content.
So yes this is an E. cigarette
in a elector E. cigarette that
has like twenty five hundred
pops of.
This chair this is like to use
the microphone so yes.
Mr chair this is called the
disposables I mean one time use
and
this has about five thousand
hits and it's
It's got to it's it's about
fifteen to twenty five dollars
and at the current rate this is
charged only fifty cents.
Four five thousand.
so.
Almost every other state I have
a list of how how all the other
states tax other tobacco
products we are the only state
that uses the language.
Value everybody else charges on
the hand wholesale almost
everybody charges on the
wholesale and some charge from
the manufacturer's price
whatever that whatever the
wholesalers and then factor
price yes and so we're proposing
thirty one percent of the
transaction price.
also try some sorry on on these
products these are E. cigarettes
twelve point five percent cap.
On these excise tax is another.
This is actually tobacco so so
the twelve point five percent no
that would be to twenty five
percent of the product value so
we're sort of all over the map
with these E. cigarettes other
tobacco products some are not
taxed at all with the excise tax
there's no uniformity and the
whole the whole idea is to why
is the price of cigarettes
equalize the price of other
tobacco products to those of
cigarettes so that people don't
go I think since cigarettes cost
so much I think I'll buy one of
these and get five thousand hits
of nicotine.
For only twenty two dollars plus
a fifty cent tax.
So you heard you heard our
reasoning and.
It's just irrational how we
Townsend other tobacco products
with such inconsistency we know
you've heard from us before that
these products are the ones used
by kids.
And they don't always find
themselves because we have the
we didn't raise the age to
twenty one and so they get these
drugs from their friends to find
the or or other ways.
Thank you the US.
Mr chair I'll be really brief on
you know met many E. cigarette
makers have been using like what
what do you call.
non tobacco.
nicotine which is like a
synthetic nicotine products to
circumvent the FDA rules so and
twenty in March last year the
Congress passed a law
clarifying FDA's authority to
regulate tobacco products you
know containing nicotine
nicotine from any source
including the synthetic nicotine
products and and currently you
know no and T. and which is like
non tobacco nicotine products
have received marketing
authorization from the FDA and
STA also issued you know seventy
five warning letters to
manufacturers to January
twentieth of this year and I'll
and fifty also issued five
hundred and eighty four warning
letters to retailers for sale of
non tobacco nicotine products to
underage persons years so I mean
the these are still in the
market and and will one of one
of the proposals in the bill is
to amend the tobacco products
act to include you know the
synthetic nicotine products
which will be complying with the
federal law and taxing them as
such thank you Mr chairman Mr
chair just have a couple of
things to add so ten percent of
adults smoke cigarettes thirty
four percent of high school
students use E. cigarettes the
costs to Medicaid related to
smoking is two hundred and
twenty two million dollars
annually.
With that was that for questions
very good thank you for your
presentation let's move to the

As.
Want to speak about that the
easy state devices the state
basically at this number eight

sound like it's water vapor.
Anything but it's actually
probably a guy called Sliq ran
up a trillion drugs being fair
saliva.
Entering the lan.
Along with a whole host of
carcinogens and most importantly
nicotine incredibly addictive
substance.
We're teaching young people.
They should be dealing with
their mental health issues.
by turning to the substances.
I have a turning to addictive
substances creating circles of
addiction dependency.
the relief that's well when
you're hitting the cigarette
vape is not a legitimate one it
is it is artificial one created
by the substance itself.
And then it's solving its own
issue.
Creating that.
The cycle of dependency
As for these definitions we
fully support these definitions
it is it is ridiculous that that
certain products are not being
taught at all.
the industry is very if nothing
else it's very innovative it
keeps coming up with new
products and that is why the
federal.
The federation of tax
administrators suggest.
That at definitions of tobacco
products be very loud enough to
account for the new innovations
that come in to the market with
that awful stands thank you very
much if you Sir if the jury
members committee Charles Walker
for introducing action funded
through reason star while stated
everybody is.
Jurors.
Thank you Sir anyone else in the

save resources or cigars for the
the main.
entry points now we're seeing.
Many of our use way too many
starting with their nicotine
addiction with the cigarettes
and other nicotine devices.
We know that raising the price
of tobacco nicotine products as
one of the most effective ways
we have to decrease of taken of
smoking in the teen initiation
and to decrease use.
We also know that
People living in poverty and
under Representative groups have
much higher rates of smoking and
nicotine use and they suffer
disproportionately
the adverse health consequences
so this bill would help
decreases the inequities and
disparities in tobacco nicotine
addiction thank you.
Dr next.
Are are good morning you would.
Good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee my name is
Laura McCloskey and executive
director of the chronic disease
prevention council and I work
with the New Mexico alley
Council tobacco and we are in
support of this bill as stated
before due to levels of news
consumption when there's
flavored tobacco E. cigarettes
it's marketed to young people
you pick up the cigarettes and
that leads to conventional
cigarette use ninety percent of
smokers start interviews and
this leads to health
complications increased health
care costs later on in life and
by taxing them at the same rate
E. cigarette to cigarettes and
make it less affordable and less
accessible to minors and it's
stated before this is a gateway
drug leads to a lot of the
issues interstate compacts in so
there in support of this bill to
reduce youth consumption rates
and prevent nicotine addiction
an early age thank you very much
laurel next.
Officials for the Fisher good
morning.
Mr chair and members of the
committee Tricia toward here is
that the eight day eight one
twenty four
I can personally attest as a
parent that.
Increasing tax rates on any
nicotine product absolutely
encourage people to either quit
or to
Do not start and I have a son
who the last time there was a
raise on the on the back of
drugs he was smoking very have
a.
And he quit because of the
greatest in the in the taxes so
I am very passionate about this
in keeping our youth.
To help thank you not to start
those who started to quit and
the same thing that would go for
adults as well.
I encourage you all Mr chair and
members of the committee to pass
the to the one twenty four.
Thank you.
Next.
Of the.
We.
Thank you.
Good morning my name is Lee
hospitality course ventures and
house district seventeen in
understanding the tax bill is
regressive doesn't really serve
a public health solutions in my
understanding a bill raising the
tax on tobacco products
including smoke free that the
FDA and numerous scientific
studies have found to be less
harmful than cigarettes for back
pain the FTEs since all nine
said the regulatory authority to
grant modified risk tobacco
product M. R. T. P. to those
programs to people's lower
health risks and traditional
combustible cigarettes not to
say that safety that's important
that's less harmful personally I
would recommend that this be
opposed because increasing the
price of drugs smokers could
switch to those that are deemed
less by raising the price of
those potential drugs you are
removing incentives for search
engines to switch less harmful
alternatives.
Thank you for taking this thank
you.
Plus but does opposition.
Okay let's then go anywhere else
online.
Support okay anyone else in the
room seeing that anyone in
opposition in the room and
online please begin by raising
your hand online and in the room
so that's a yes also because
that.
The back and forth.
Operation guys.
Second registered lobbyist all
three of and we stand in
opposition to this bill you know
we have some alternative
language that we floated around
that that we're be more than
happy to to talk to the
legislature about on how to work
the tax of some other tobacco
products
but in terms of this bill we're
just we're just in opposition to
it but also I sat in the health
committee of last week and heard
CYFD
testify on cannabis that
cannabis is what you are using
the state is the the the
increases in cannabis and those
single hit.
Thanks a lot of it is is
cannabis so I think it was gonna
have a discussion about taxing
adult products all the products
need to be discussed thank you
Mr chair thank you next.
Thank you Mr chairman and
members of the committee moved
over here Representative Wright
also back over each of much of
what Mr scallop just said.
This is what we've been a part
of as well we think we have a.
A reasonable.
Position for all of you to
consider and we hope that during
you we could do this
Bring everything together I just
try to piecemeal this is a whole
solution once and for all thank
you Mr thank you yes.
Sure meeting when John Thompson
operation of this servers and
trace issues in the local
independents are present like to
state people that I represent a
big sign of this issue cannot
the store unless you're twenty
one years I think that's
important to note Mr chairman I
also like to point out on the
FIR page six you'll see it once
agree states during that window
taxation.
Tax.
In this country tax you tax like
act like those that percentage
and then also tax lightning
action level I would.
This is that a few years ago
advocates and industry all work
together to pass the HSA back of
products which is that was these
executive recommendation
question to work together Mr
chairman that's in here we
implemented the tax rate for the
state that right now together
we.
Have a lasting all the state.
Generous tax four point five
percent thank you.
Thank you.
This Mr Chairman planning or
Representative to this is that a
low.
Our situation American.
And I'm speaking on behalf of
against this bill.
The guards sure.
Product we are back on.
We've gone through this before
of that fact just a few years
back.
we should through a deal.
At.
I need to I want to use.
I don't do that I can call it
receive just running around ten
dollars on.
And and I don't think you're
gonna find of these.
What this does the industry and
the people in the business had
no real problem.
This is this and and now they're
going to come back.
Go through this again.
Sh what you're doing is you're
destroying the general process
and the people out of this.
The reason we went that way with
all.
Because the one we don't have
that many of the state have up
to that was.
Which is the.
One year.
Of the three sure there's a but
they were they were being put
out of business because people
were ordering there are.
Chicago.
For every place
they were going out of this so
but but we have all yes.
What to.
In the affirmative.
We are along the way is yes.
We.
That thank you Sir next thank
you Mr chairman the jurors are.
I will touch on regressive tax
ID that last.
A couple weeks ago we are not
into that tax bill she is run
there is the live on.
Problem in New Mexico
people will go to lack market.
Although the the bill is well
intentioned.
Thank you.
Yeah one.
You Mr chairman members
commitments keep Gartner rest of
this for awful occurs tobacco
number of the major distributor
for she chair in the tobacco
products in again as some of the
other.
Individuals that this bill
captures everything except for
cigarettes which you know she's
in in the use of hookah tobacco
you don't see young kids
modeling three foot tall
Water drugs into school to be
used for other things it's it's
a culturally used product that
is for social reasons much like
a man the other at the groups to
use some of these products for
social in other reasons and so
it it captures folks who really
are doing this because this is
part of a tradition part of who
they are and so we think it
unfairly hits those phones and
stops that activity in a state
where we tend to celebrate the
diversity of cultures try to
punish the diversity of our
culture's best we stand strong
opposition.
Thank you anyone else in the
room right now that's go online
still at the.
That.
That's a good morning.
Committee members claims method
works here and my two sisters
and Senator mansion in
Albuquerque we're third
generation business established
by my grandfather in nineteen
seventy six.
There are five premium cigar
shops currently left in the city
New Mexico this bill would in
that we would be done
we don't sell cigarettes we
don't celebrate we sell premium
handcrafted cigars and pipe
tobacco they take years to
produce no additives
Natural like I said children do
not smoke these you're not gonna
high school or walking down the
street with a twenty dollar cab
it just doesn't happen people
are not addicted to premium
cigars it doesn't happen this
tax would push all that business
out of state online we're seeing
an increase in purchases from
Australia Japan several other
countries in Europe where they
don't have to pay any tax at all
if it's shipped into the state
this within that segment and
strong opposition I don't think
anyone who's willing and able to
come visit us
where you know again third
generation we have a wealth of
knowledge if you want to go to
Nicaragua with me to see this
whole process from beginning and
I'd be happy to arrange that.
Just come see us again in strong
opposition thank you.
Thank you madam let's go that.
That's a good morning.
Good morning chairman and
members of the committee thank
you for your time today my
name's Linji Stratojet rector
the consumer center at the
taxpayers protection alliance
and a visiting fellow at the
independent women's forum like
many other states policies that
taxed cigarettes I'll I'll stick
to address the so called baby
academic there is no academic
status for the CDC and FDA's
national tobacco survey use they
can decreased by fifty three
percent from twenty percent of
middle and high school students
in twenty nineteen to nine point
four percent and twenty twenty
two and four years from one in
five American youth using E.
cigarettes less than one in ten
using them last year great CDC's
youth risk behavior survey which
we still don't have New Mexico
data for nationally baby right
among high school students
decreased by forty five percent
from thirty two point seven
percent of the students in
twenty nineteen to eighteen
percent twenty twenty one now
organizations are downplaying
these reductions in point some
pandemic yet you think you
decrease in states like Florida
and in Washington DC both of our
different pandemic policies we
should refrain from increasing
taxes on vapor products until we
have the full scope of how many
New Mexico these are vaping I
thank you for your time today.
You next.
What were you in the morning.
Mr chairman and members of the
committee my name is Li levels
are represented New Mexico
probably markers our members are
small business owners in every
city in New Mexico and I can
promise you they work very hard
to make sure tobacco products
don't give into the hands of
minors.
That being said your your
customers are were in New
Mexicans and the challenges our
customers have faced over the
past three years have been have
been very difficult the use of
the pandemic inflation at a
forty year high interest rates
at a twenty year high and now it
won't increase taxes on them.
As I testified on the system
bill one twenty three we believe
this legislation house bill one
twenty four parks and utilizes
those New Mexicans that can
least afford.
So for those reasons we oppose
house bill one twenty four thank
you the that.
Right.
It.
She.
Good morning.
Thank you Mr chairman and
committee members for the
opportunity to comment my name
is Adam Hoffman and the director
excise tax policy with the tax
foundation my comments ARE
interested providing additional
information and should not be
construed as support of or
opposition of any bill or
motion.
Most recently been taxes there
for some years partially
motivated motivated by revenues
increasing taxes on Baker also
the loss of cigarette tax
revenue for us they are
partially public health measure
intended to display the
technical vapor products
particularly with you increase
in taxes will decrease baby
products services which is
desirable when it comes to non
smokers but is generally
regarded as undesirable if they
for users are switching from
more combustible tobacco
products studies for Texas
discourage smokers from
switching and that preferential
rates and papers as opposed to
Busselton background or
consistent with harm reduction.
One of them study published in
twenty twenty explored were
ninety five percent of the tax
in Minnesota and found that that
tax because more than thirty
thousand fewer people to switch
from smoking combustible
cigarettes to E. cigarettes
because a higher post tax
breaks.
The building remains one of the
most popular tools for helping
smokers quit smoking struggling
right balance is also difficult
task which legislators are
talking with lawmakers often
simultaneously seeking to
discourage the new products are
non smokers to accord  with
smokers switching to vaping
products into raise enough
revenue to fund smoking
cessation and other public
health programs as you consider
these matters your resources and
would be delighted to provide
you with more research on the
top thank you for your time this
morning you are last person
alright the morning.
Good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee it's Leri
Sonntag here I oppose this bill
and for reasons that were well
articulated by previous speakers
Mr leader in gold meticulous
pointed out that this bill will
particularly hurt lower income
people and as a small business
owner myself I especially stand
with comments from Matt Monday
pointing out that this bill is a
garage does not take into any
account of small shops and small
businesses that will be impacted
like like Matthew monthly
mentioned the maintain that I do
not understand is there this is
a tax increase there's tax
increases being proposed on
gasoline on alcohol on
corporations on I can't even
keep track of how many tax
increases are being proposed
this is another one in the midst
of a three point five billion
dollar tax surplus finally
commented this is really all
about hello.
This legislative body but passed
you know legalizing cannabis as
a whole nother conversation but
this is a tax increase bill I
strongly oppose thank you Sir
the thing that no one else on
the line to fund to the group
that this point we can come back
ready for debate.
You want questions what's
Representative is that what on
the line.
Thank you Mr chairman
representative Thompson miss
weaver.
Another.
That increased patient
legislation just a couple weeks
ago.
And the representations made.
That.
So what is.
Leicester city associated.
With the price that is press one
of consumption went down most
kids and.
Representative Harper
commissioned scatterplot.
To.
What.
Thank you to clients or the
consumption percentages kids as
opposed to taxes imposed in all
fifty states and Mr chairman.
Representative.
Sh
one issue could.
So.
Do you know any.
Up with you the.
Mr Chairman representative.
That would indicate otherwise
for these top.
Mr Chairman representative of
Scott there is a bunch of Infor
American heart association
American cancer society FDA
Statistics can say whatever you
want them to say but that
American pulmonology Association
long as the all those people
have found that an increase in
price is the best way to keep
you from starting and and my two
experts to give you more than
you could read about that.
Mr Chairman representative.
Could you address the issue of.
He was brought up on several
occasions you're specifically.
With respect to internet sales
and perhaps sales of these
products on tribal sure
okay Mr Chairman representative
that in terms of tribal lands
their sovereign nations they can
do what they want to do but what
has happened through the years
is that generally they follow
the state policy maybe not as
high but the last time we did
increase all the tribal sellers
also did and the first part of
the question was
you know that I think it's kind
of a boogeyman I'm I've sat on
the tobacco committee for nine
years I've never we've never
heard from anyone with any proof
of bootlegging
and and if there is bootlegging
or or internet sales she is do
you use that nicotine kind of
spur of the moment they're not
the type that will drive to just
let at to buy tobacco and they
are not you know order it online
when it's going to get here in a
week it's when they get off of
when they finish school they're
hanging around the state let's
go get something and so they do
so where we are targeting you I
mean if course we can't just say
if you're not legal to buy you
pay more taxes so we are
targeting the help of of you and
I will say Mr chair that this
bill is not about raising
revenues this bill is about
saving kids from starting
nicotine use and saving the
state money in health care costs
particularly in Medicaid.
Representative R. L. come before
coming up to.
This legislative session.
Rounds of the school systems in
my district.
Home computer.
Was.
Share.
I want to use.
So Mr Chairman representative
would you compare.
Hi tech church on one of sources
days proposed.
Tax regs consequence of this
legislation Mr Mr chair and
representative Scott we are not
talking about cannabis this is
purely about nicotine I I'm not
going to weigh in on whether and
to be perfectly honest if
anybody believes that kids were
not using cannabis before we
legalized it I'm I have a bridge
over the Rio Grande to sell you.
So.
Mr Chairman representative.
That's the answer to the
question is marijuana taxed at a
lower rate would it be taxed.
Is this piece of legislation.
Mr chair and representative
Scott I'm I'm not up to date on
that that taxes on cannabis.
Thank you Mr corruption.
Those that are set up.
Thank you Mr chairman
Representative I am so grateful
that I never wired that have
that addiction should say that
is horrible
I am all for taxing cannabis at
the same level as we're talking
about here as well as just
mention this twelve and a half
percent I think that's fair.
And so I just I just put that
out there.
My question that I think I think
I heard it where you'd stated
that some drugs were taxed at
all and other drugs were taxed
higher than the twenty five
percent.
Representative Duncan synthetic
tobacco which is being sold
Oliver New Mexico this is a
little will snap act.
No tax no exercise so gross
receipts tax so any synthetic
tobacco product is not being
taxed at all in the realm of the
twenty five percent product
value that the statute currently
says we tax other tobacco
products so chewing tobacco
those other tobacco products of
a tax to twenty twenty five
percent of the products that.
Thank thank you Mr thank you
expert so following that line of
questioning and why did we just
raise it to the twenty five
percent for those that were
taxed and public good instead of
raising it Mr Chairman
representative dumping so right
now I think arrests traditional
cigarettes are taxed at a higher
rate than most other products so
what this bill does is to bring
up all tobacco nicotine products
not tobacco of the same rate as
cigarettes.
And I thank you Mr and I knew
that Representative I just.
You know I.
I like tobacco products that are
like taxes either one
Was there any was there any
thought of putting the revenue
that's being generated by this
tax if this goes into programs
to target our young people if
you're you're saying this is the
epidemic Mr chair representative
Duncan we would love that
we.
We what we didn't put it in this
bill because we feel like it's
important to get this bill
passed to protect are you but we
would be more than a hundred
percent in favor of all of that
money going directly to
prevention because I don't have
the numbers but New Mexico.
Have you talked about what the
recommended is that yes Mr chair
representative right now New
Mexico the department of health
is allocated about five point
two million dollars ninety five
point four four prevention and
cessation services also some of
that money from the tobacco
settlement goes into Medicaid to
help pay for the two hundred and
twenty four million you're not
tobacco related health care
costs so we would we would love
to see this year and as I
testified before the tobacco
industry spends over thirty
million dollars in advertising
in New Mexico and we spend five
million dollars on prevention we
need more prevention but we're
not going to get that prevention
money
unless we work this which would
be a wonderful.
Thank you for our state.
Thank.
I'm sorry the federal
recommendations for.
Mention money is at twelve.
Twenty two million is a
recommendation for New Mexico
that we should be spending on
prevention and we're spending Mr
chair little over five.
Thank you Mr thank you
Representative I would love to
see you back here next year
with cannabis tax equal the
tobacco products if you really
for really talking about helping
our young people and stopping
love to see it back next year
thank you.
There is Mr chair I will add
that cannabis products are sold
in stores where people under
twenty one cannot even enter so
there's a slight difference
there should you for
clarification that are.
It's just to have a phone
number.
I thought I thought and then.
Thank you Mr Jack
acts of a question for your
expert a quick so that little
disposable.
Earlier the Sekibo bar on it
determine how much you purchased
that for here in the state.
Mr chair Representative
Hernandez I think this cost
about I think I had that one of
our folks by it I think it's
Representative ranges from
fifteen to twenty two at I don't
know exactly how much this was
paid but on that point me that
this this is disposable and that
this is the the one that was
turned away and ran by car so
we're we're also creating like
in a toxic waste as but.
That's great with that but
that's not what.
okay so real quick Google
search.
Found the same drugs for ten
dollars and twenty five cents
I was a smoker since I entered
fifteen I went to pay drugs to
help me quit and now have not
had a cigarette in over ten
years
And I'll tell you that I went
and bought all of my products
online because it was
significantly cheaper and I'm
worried that if we continue to
taxes especially the younger
generation my age as an elder
millennial and younger is gonna
go online we buy everything
online Amazon is our first stop
for everything
And the the I hope one thing
straight back in next center for
public policy and the tax
foundation to pretty reputable
sources put together a report
last year that said over forty
three percent of the tobacco in
our state has been smuggled in
and it's probably for that
reason we keep raising it and it
keeps becoming easier and easier
to purchase online
It's cheaper it's easier it gets
delivered to your house I don't
see a problem with that the the.
This in packets that you have to
do in your
In your back over there average
of five dollars here and online
you can get that for three
dollars and twenty five cents I
don't know what the budget and
not going online at this point
Mr chair of hello I'm I'm sort
of please Representative
Hernandez.
Most kids don't have credit
cards and that's how you have to
buy things online and if you go
through if you go through your
parents Amazon account it will
show up as the purchase and
hopefully your parents will get
that in the bud and we have not
done a lot of racing we've had
many bills to raise taxes on
tobacco products Mr chair but.
We have not done a lot of racing
of that and as I said before you
are more impulse buyers I mean
once they're addicted yes but
the ones who are starting it's
more like they're hanging around
at the circle K. like I used to
do in Crown Point and get an
urgent say let's do something
wild and crazy and they go in
and buy are they have someone go
in and buy for them.
Mr chair and Representative I
would I would agree with that
that's actually I started way
back in the day before it was
you know what it was still a
teen device cigarettes but
The only other question I have
is I went on RLD's website and
looked at the minimum age to
sell cigarettes or alcohol we
have a minimum age of eighteen
that was twenty at one point I
believe
there is I think this is
something else we should look at
and I just wanted to be kind of
on the record is that there is
not the minimum age to sell
tobacco products in our state
according I have the screenshot
of RLD's website
but it's not explicitly.
It says both the state statutes
and the rules are silent on
minimum age of employee that
sells tobacco and tobacco
products something else we
should look at because.
I would imagine that I don't
know what the percentage would
be that but that that is
something else we can look at
what sixteen year old the
selling tobacco products to his
friends or two other under age
people
And if we do it for alcohol we
should probably also do it for
tobacco just to per whatever
percentage even if it's ten
percent that's still ten percent
of that that doesn't get out so
just a COVID of something that
we look at it if you do chair I
can't remember the bill or when
but we didn't have as part of a
bill at one point and the and
part I believe it was
representative Armstrong who
asked us to remove it because
she had a convenience store pay
model or something and said you
know we we can't get older P. so
at one point we did try to do
that but at the request of.
Small businesses we remove it
yeah and I need to start with Mr
chair I totally get that and
that's something that we're
gonna have to figure out what
that looks like as we go along
but probably something we should
also look at some I know it's
not technically part of this
bill goes towards that the over
arching thank you Mr chair our
government is.
What other questions or comments
from the committee.
Available okay
to table to share your
presentation do you understand
the process here
when it again but the thank you
for your presentation and that
can I get a motion these people.
Then press down ocean.
