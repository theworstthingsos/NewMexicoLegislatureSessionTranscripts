He
By Madame Cardina.
And a chair representative. I'm
here. Thank you. Yeah, we have a
quorum again, good morning,
everybody. Let's move now to our
first agenda item, which is HB
295 tax on real on property
owned by NM Rita. Recall last
Friday you guys had a thorough
debate on this and, and a full
discussion, uh, both, uh, by the
audience and those joining us
online as well as in the
committee. So I don't want to
spend a whole lot of time on
rehashing everything that was
discussed.
Since that point, and I'll give,
I'll give the mic and, and the
attention to Chairman Small here
in a minute, but since that
point there's been a few FIRs
updated and some things going
on, so uh that being stated.
Representatives of Chairman
Jos. Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, committee, uh, Mr.
Chair, committee, thank you very
much for having us here today,
uh, in the updated analysis from
TRD they uh cite a, uh, and I'm
of course not a lawyer, Mr.
Chair. They cite a concurrence
in cutter flying service. Um,
who, uh, concurred that the, um,
essentially with our uh
perspective.
chair of the Savanage 6 of the
updated um analysis of the
fiscal impact report, uh,
analysis from TRD, uh, Mr.
Chair, um, we think that that um
the updated analysis showing
that uh this is um
Uh, sort of in line with other
exemptions that are granted in
the statute, along with Mr.
Chair, committee, the very real
interest that New Mexico has in
continuing transmission
projects, even as those
transmission projects face a
much more difficult federal uh
atmosphere, um, for us to
continue building out our
transmission and therefore
building out our generation, uh,
we're excited to bring the bill
back today, Mr. Chair, um, if
the two
experts have anything brief to
add to help clarify that for the
committee, uh, I would go to
them and then we'd stand.
Folks,
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, just to add, um, uh,
text and res analysis in
addition to the, the cutter
special concurring cites a
number of other provisions in
the uh property tax code that
indicate that uh property is
assessed to the owner of the
property and how that's defined
what would include Rita, but not
it's lessees. That's all I have
to add. Thank you.
Thank you Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee,
nothing down. Thank you. Very
well. As mentioned before is
that uh I I know you had a
thorough hearing last, last
Friday. I don't want to have to
rehash everything that was
mentioned. So I told the sponsor
that I was gonna go straight to
a uh
Request of the of the committee
and then go from there.

House Bill 3:30.
Is a monumental piece of
legislation.
That places are centuries old
Spanish land grants.
And Aseca communities.
On a sound footing and
addressing much needed.
Infrastructure projects.
And such improvements will
enhance the public safety.
Public welfare and public health
of these entities.
This legislation is a priority
legislation for both our land
grant and ase communities of the
session.
Mr. Chair, House Bill 330.
Places of land grants and Osea
infrastructure fund in the same
pie chart.
Uh, for all capital projects.
Where on January 15th of each
year, the state Board of
Finance.
We estimate
The amount
Of bonding capacity available
for severance tax bonds.
be authorized by us, the
legislature.
And Mister Chair.
Currently, the division
allocates.
9% of the estimated bonding
capacity.
Each year for water projects.
Uh, water trust board.
In the amount of 160.
Um, a million dollars.
Of which the legislature will
authorize the state Board of
Finance.
To issue severance tax bonds for
the amount to be used for water
projects.
And Mr. Chair likewise.
The division has allocated um
1.5%
For tribal infrastructure fund,
and 4.5%.
For the colonial's
infrastructure fund.
$80 million.
The division also allocates.
2.5 body capacity for the
housing trust one.
Mr. Cha, in that same process.
House Bill 30 has a division
allocating.
For the first time.
1.1% of the bonding capacity.
For the land grant
infrastructure fund.
approximately 19 million.
And 1.1% of the bonding
capacity.
the infrastructure fund.
Approximately 19 million.
Mr. Chair.
Hospital 3:30.
As the land grant Council.
Which is a standalone commission
under the DFA.
Verdi and prioritizing capital
projects by individual land
grants.
And also Mr. Chair, House Bill
3:30, has the Osea bureau.
Of the interstate string
commission.
Vetting projects by individual
seass with prior prioritization
following within the IOC.
Mr. Chair, before I go to my
experts.
To further elaborate on the
scope and.
needs for this initiative.
I would like to, uh, before I
yield to them, I'd like to state
that uh.
There is no fiscal impact.
0 3:30.
With that I yield to my experts
and they can introduce
themselves.
And proceed to identify the roll
and need.
For this initiative, please.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee. My
name is Paula Garcia and I'm the
executive director of the New
Mexicose Association, a
statewide organization of Asekis
and community ditches.
I'm here to talk to you about
the reason, uh, the, the need
for this funding for a second
infrastructure, um,
Our purpose is is to um
Um, have a reliable recurring
funding source for a second
infrastructure through a
programmatic approach in
administering funding that
insurance project completion in
a timely manner. The needs of
asecas across the state are
tremendous. There are 700
Hasekes and 23 different
counties across the state.
They support the agricultural
economy and the livelihoods of
thousands of families.
We have completed a list of
unmet needs from the recent uh 2
or 2 to 3 years.
And those include a compilation
of capital outlay and ICIPs,
disaster recovery, um, cost
share and also the ISCSI Bureau
program.
And that has totaled about $75
million just in the last two
years.
The fund would be managed by the
interstate stream Commission in
conjunction with the Department
of Finance Administration.
The ISC has administered these
projects since the 1980s, but
recently formalized the Asea
Bureau.
In the most recently completed
fiscal year, they have a 90%
completion rate for a second
infrastructure projects, um, we
strongly support this initiative
because we feel that it would
improve outcomes for a second in
terms of uh fully funding
projects meeting unmet needs and
completing projects in a timely
manner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
and no guilt. Thank you.
I yield to my other expert and
he can introduce himself.
Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of
the committee. My name is Arturo
Archeneta. I am the director of
the New Mexico Land Grant
Council, uh, here today to just
talk a little bit about the
needs of our land grant
communities as Representative
Garcia mentioned, um, our land
grant communities are centuries
old, um, where there were once
hundreds of communities today we
only have 27 community land
grants that are recognized
political subdivisions of the
state.
In 11 counties.
these communities, um, as a
result of action by the
territorial government and then
the the state government, um,
lost a lot of their land base
and and their sort of economic
abilities, and today those
communities that remain
oftentimes are the only, uh,
units of government, local units
of government in their region,
and they provide much needed
services, uh, that are in need
of these capital dollars, just
to give you some examples of the
type of uh programs and, and
where this funding would go
towards um we have many land
grants that have uh
multi-purpose centers that are
in need of um construction,
renovations and improvements.
Uh, we have communities that do
it affordable housing
initiatives and they need the
infrastructure uh to continue
those efforts, um, as well as
community parks and playgrounds,
construction and improvements,
uh, community fire department
construction and improvements.
As well as uh economic
development opportunities um
with some of the uh facilities
that they run, um, community
drinking water systems as well
as community wastewater systems,
uh, preservation of historic
community buildings, uh,
including cultural museums. Um,
we also have land grants that
are in need of dam repairs and
improvements, as well as heavy
equipment needs and storage
facilities for those, uh, and so
with that, Mr. Chairman, um,
I'll stand for any questions or
yield.
And Mr. Chara, um, we'd like to
move the amendment. Thank you.
Some move the amendment.
I will
Please proceed, OK, uh, Mr.
Chair, you have
Um
Amendment, um
231142.1.
Uh, Mr. Chair, um,
Amendments number 2 and 3 relate
to concerns by the SIC State
Investment Council, uh, in the
FIR.
And the amendment basically
delays disbursements.
From the trust fund for 5 years,
so that the SIC can see what the
five-year balance was before
disbursement.
Uh, the SIC also raised concerns
about the timing and making
distributions from the trust
fund at the start of the fiscal
year.
Uh, which is what we had
originally in the bill. The
amendment basically pushes.
Back the timing to August 1st as
SIC recommended.
And Mr. Chair, lastly,
amendments 1 and 4 relate to
increasing the bonding capacity
of the tribal infrastructure
fund from 4.5 to 6.5%.
This amendment came to us by his
son of Shandon.
Who has fought for years.
To correct the wrong by the
legislature.
In which the tribal
infrastructure fund bonding
capacity was lowered from 6.5 to
4.5.
During the 2015, 2016 economic
downturn.
As follow traditional land-based
people are land grant and a
secular community who endorsed
this increase in our
infrastructure legislation.
With that we stand for questions
on the amendment, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative. Any
questions on the amendment,
Representative.
And the amendment, Mister
Chairman, when we're increasing
the tribal infrastructure
project fund to 6.5%. What does
that mean in money?
Uh, Mr. Chair, um,
What would be the value in terms
of the total amount and
increase.
Mr. Chair, uh, we don't have
current accurate uh estimate.
But uh
I think uh Arturo can kind of
reflect in terms of what the 1%
margin equals, so I yield to
Arturo.
Mr. Chair Representative
Lustrom, uh, we know that the
1.1% uh estimate was, was about
19 million for the uh land grant
and the second set aside. So I'm
looking at the 2% increase,
that's probably likely around 16
million per 1%, 16 to 17
million. So, um, roughly 34
million is what I'd be looking
at. So, Mr. Chairman, you know
that we've got
The tribal infrastructure fund,
and then what is that program
for the
The colonius one also, so would
you
Continue to keep the colonious
fund at 4.5 in this bill.
A Mister Chair, we're, we're uh
not touching the other
infrastructure funds that
basically rely on severance
taxes, that severance tax
bonding.
Um, for their projects.
We're just dealing with the
Osaka and grants and
The amendment kind of just deals
exclusively with the tribal.
But Mr. Chairman, those are.
Immediate
Um
Programs that are funded right
off the top of the severance tax
package.
Including the colonnius fund.
Um, and they went through the
same downturn, I know in 2015.
Uh, and we had to do that,
Mister Chaton, because of our
problems with uh
With the economy at the time.
So you, you're saying, Mr.
Chairman Representative, that
would bring in an additional 34.
Marian to the tribal
infrastructure Project Fund. I,
I'm curious also, Mr. Chairman,
is there a balance in that fund
currently? Are they spending
what they got, what they're
getting? Do you all know, Mister
Cherubiner Lindstrom, I'm not.
I'm not uh current in terms of
that particular
Um, estimate, yeah.
I'm just curious because I'm
pretty close to that fund.
from my part of the state.
And I'm just curious if.
All the funds have been spent
and
Anyway, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Representative. Other
questions on the amendment,
Representative Duncan.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um
I guess, I guess to me this just
muddies it up a little bit more.
I have no problem correcting a
wrong, uh, that was done in 2015
at all, but why was it tied to
this bill.
Mr. Chair, um, Duncan, um, um,
you know, uh, Senator Shado.
It's kind of the ranking.
Native American senator in the
legislature.
Um, approached, um,
You know our second night
communities and uh
Um, and basically offered.
Uh, if we would
Include
An increase to the tribal
infrastructure.
based on his many years of
trying to um
Make that happen.
And uh so we accommodated.
His request.
As a fellow tribal.
As a fellow kind of land based
community peoples, we felt it
was appropriate.
Basically accept his request.
And uh
And that's why it's in the in
the amendment and that's why we
want to see and also become part
of the.
The legislation as a whole, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you for representing for that.
I, I just think it muddies the
water on what we're trying to
accomplish with one item with
another item, and I think it
would have been a cleaner uh
bill um to my uh colleagues uh
point, um.
And I wasn't here in 2015, so
I'm hoping that I can be
educated, but when you're, when
you're uh portion is up here
before everybody else is. Tell
me what happens when we go into
a downturn.
Mr.
Chair
and uh Representative Duncan.
2015 and 2016 was a story.
For one.
The Republicans for the first
time in 50 some years.
Assumed a leadership role in the
House.
Secondly,
In 2015, 2016.
We saw
cost of a barrel of oil.
Go from $106 to $32 in a matter
of months.
That rod, austerity measures on
the part of the legislature, and
unfortunately.
You know these newly formed
Republicans as leaders of the
House.
It was chaotic.
Soul, LFC.
Went into airy fund.
imaginable.
And either scrapped off part of
it or took all of it.
kind of balance the budget.
Uh
On the general on that side.
So that's what happened in 2015
and 2016.
And unfortunately,
infrastructure fund was on the
cutting board in terms of.
Doing their body capacity to
percentage points.
You know, so I hope that
answered your question, Mr.
Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative, uh,
the Republicans didn't have
anything to do with the price of
oil.
And I I guess I'm not exactly
happy about uh thinking that
perhaps that's what you were
insinuating that the Republicans
were the cause of 2015 and 2016.
Um, so I still have problems
with this because you've muddied
the water now and uh but I think
you've answered my question.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative.
Anyone else questions on the
amendment, Representative, uh,
true. OK, on the amendment,
anyone else?
But the pleasure of the of the
committee for the amendment.
On the amendment
Moved to a doctor.
would reduct the amendments
there a second.
Second, please call the roll in
the amendment to the adopt the
amendment. 231142.1.
Representative Chandler.
On the bill, Mr. Chair.
Oh, yes.
Representative Duncan.
No.
Representative Gallegos.
Representative Henry.
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Lindstrom.
I guess on the amendment.
Representative Martinez.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Parajuan.
Representative Silva.
Yes.
Representative Trasas.
That vice chair Kadina.
Yes, on the amendment.
Che, Linda.
Yes, and the amendment.
about a 123.
7 to 36 to 3, uh, your amendment
to your bill has been amended
on the bill itself that we stand
for questions. OK, thank you
very much and, and just for
clarification, uh, before we go
to the audience, you made the
statement that there is no
fiscal impact, which is for the
committee's sake, there
absolutely is a physical impact,
uh, to the bonding capacity of
our state, and so when we affect
these funds this way, it affects
our body capacity, therefore
reducing our bonding capacity
for capital outlay and so
there's some other advantages to
it.
So that being said, just so
we're on the same page. And with
that being said, let's go to the
internet first. Anyone online in
support of House of the amended
House Bill 330 is twice amended

Support.
Hello, Miss Sherman, members of
the committee, I'm Harold
Trujillo, president of the New
Mexico Ase Association. I'm also
president of the sequela Ila in
Mora County. Uh, one of the
things I'd like to point out is
that this process will help our
capital outlay process in terms
of accomplishing good
construction in a good time. Uh,
I have over 15 years of
experience requesting funding
through the legislature and
there was one project that took
me 10 years to complete.
complete and currently I have a
little project where I've been
getting like 18,000, 10,000,
5000. So this process is
expected, you know, to help us
complete our projects. One thing
too, I'd like to point out is
that this hunts will be
monitored very closely. In fact,
there will be double audited,
you know, they are going through
a state agency, you know, so
they're state agency, of course,
you know, receives them very
carefully and then also the
asecas themselves, you know,
need to get.
it on their own, so the funds
will be carefully monitored. I'd
like to also point out that this
communities are really the
backbone to our rural
communities in New Mexico. OK,
so I appreciate your support and
thank you very much.
Thank you. Next.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee. My
name is Drew Sutter, registered
lobbyist for the publics of his
letterta San Felipe Owga, Santa
Clara and Zuni, and we support
the bill as amended. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you for your
brevity.
Next, good morning, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. I am
here on behalf of Agricultura
Network, uh, agricultural stands
in support of HB 330 and urges
the members to pass this
important legislation. Thank
you. Thank you. Next.
Good morning, Mr. Chair. Members
of the committee. My name is
Juan Sanchez. I am president of
the Chitty Lee Land Grant, and
we support of Bill 330, its
amendment. It's an important
piece of legislation, uh, we are
now on our 3rd affordable
housing project that we funded
with capital outlay and with our
own money and this fund would be
greatly uh a good improvement
for land grants in a second.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Next.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, um, thank you for the
opportunity to speak in support
of House Bill 3:30.
Um, my name's Alfredo Montoya in
in rural villages like ours, so
we double up and multitask
sometimes where a caretaker for
a cemetery catcher, but we also
volunteer on other issues and
the vice president of the
Mexicose Association and a
member of the New Mexico Oseca
Commission.
I like to speak on behalf of a
secus and land grants, a secus
many times are thought that it's
just an irrigation ditch. Asecas
are not just an irrigation, this
they're actually an entire
community, and there are
hundreds of these communities
and dozens of language
communities are in desperate
need of some stability in terms
of uh funding for
infrastructure.
These are takes and languages
are no different than county
series municipalities, uh,
tribal entities, colonials, the
only difference is that Rosecas
and land grants have not been
fortunate enough to have a, a
funding stream or stable funding
stream.
Some of your colleagues have uh
encouraged us to go after this
uh funding on Col Bill 3:30
because it would give an
opportunity.
Uh, for them to concentrate on
other projects and we wouldn't
have to be bothering so much for
capital only.
Uh, another thing, uh, Mr.
Chairman and members of the
committee,
Uh
Any folks think that a secas are
only in northern New Mexico, and
yes, there are many of them, but
there I I guess in Lincoln
Grant,
Luna Sierra, Otero
County and I mentioned a while
ago in 23 counties in the state.
Thank you very much for the time
and we appreciate your support
of Bill 3:30.
Thank you, sir. Thanks.
Mr. Cha representative, my
name's Antonio Gudule, and I am
uh a chair on um se deed delva
de Penasco. Also, I sit on the
commission for the regional
sectors of the Santa Barbara
drainage. We are one of 18
Osecas.
Uh, that predate 1874, and uh
like many communities, uh, you
know, we realized that the water
is very precious, but we also
realized that uh a lot of the uh
community wells are are being
compromised because of, of the
lack of water, me with the, to
get water out on fields, so this
infrastructure bill would uh
definitely would go through a, a
lot to help us out to, to, uh,
uh, improve our ir and be able
to get.
Uh, water up there to the fields
and improve uh the community.
Thank you very much. I
appreciate your support.
Thank you. Next.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members

Rick Martinez. I'm a member of
Northern New Mexico, a second
member and treasurer for both
Los Salazares, Community ditch,

I have experienced firsthand the
need for increased funding to
support state agencies that
support these bills, that this
bill supports. Early in our sea
FEMA claim are uh Sea, it became
clear to me that how uh broken
FEMA is and with what's
happening in Washington, uh, the
need is now at the state level.
people that understand the Aseos
and what the Esequis bring to
New Mexico. They are the veins
that bring the life to the land
and that's why land grants and
asseass need support now.
Please, uh, and thank you for
your support and I hope you
support this bill.
Thank you, sir. Yes, ma'am. Good

As amended.
A second land grants and tribe
infrastructure projects have
tangible and visible um results
that will strengthen our rural
and agricultural communities,
they ensure verdant riparian
ecology, and they recharge our
aquifer. Additionally, it will
improve our public safety and
our public welfare by
maintaining cultural and
traditional practices. La

As political subdivisions of the
state, land grants and asseki
serve as the most local
government. We have the
capacity, the professionalism,
and the guardrails in place
through New Mexico Ase
Association, the ISC Aseki
bureau, and the New Mexico land
grant Council to ensure projects
are managed well from start to
end. The professional planning

important to land grant
communities and Oseass, uh, and
so we stand in full support of
this bill.
And I want to thank
Representative Garcia for always
being mindful of uh land grant
communities and Oakia
communities, and lastly, I just
want to say many times you as
legislators don't get thanked
enough, so thank you for the
hard work that you do and the
many tough decisions that are in
front of you daily. Thank you so
much and have a great day.
Thank you, sir.
Seeing no one else is anyone in
opposition of House Bill 330 has
twice amended.
Nobody? OK, let's come back to
the committee for questions,
comments on this bill.
Representative Lindstrom.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you presenters and welcome
everybody to our Capitol today.
I'm glad to see you. I wanted to
ask the
Mr. Chairman, why do we have two
different program funds.
I, I, I'm not, I don't
understand that, Mr. Chairman,
when I, I understand the kind of
the corpus.
But it states that there is um
Two funds that would be set up
for programming. Is that
correct?
Mr. Chair and um,
yes, um, there will be a
Uh, yeah.
Um
Infrastructure project fund.
Which will basically be funded
through the sale of the
severance tax bonds.
Um, and there will be also um
In separate statues.
separate section in the 330,
also a
The left Marse,
um.
infrastructure of Project fund.
Which would be
I see, which are getting funding
also from the sale of the uh
several tax funds.
OK, so Mr. Chairman, because
there are two different kinds of
programs or projects. Uh,
they're not just, it couldn't be
by, because most of our, most of
our funds have one project fund
to it, you know, you've got the
corpus and then you've got the
project fund and then the scope
of work and the eligible
initiatives are put in there, so
I, I guess I'm not clear why we
have to have 2.
Mr. Chair, Nordstrom.
There's basically two entities
that the bill addresses.
Um
Ice, which are
A unit of government, let's say
in New Mexico, Mr. Chair, and
also Aseass.
traditional seconds, which are
also in its government say New
Mexico for two different
entities.
That are basically two different
types of superstructures.
In terms of how they uh function
and the support mechanisms.
to assist the land grants.
And they're doing the
operations.
That's why in the legislation,
Mister Chair, we have the land
grant council.
Being the entity which is a
standalone.
Um, commission under the DFA.
And as a staffing,
Uh, that basically deals, Mr.
Chair, with issues of
governance.
With issues of procurement.
With issues of uh requirements
for meeting audits.
Uh, which provides assistance to
land grants on a daily basis.
Uh, that will basically
The
pass, Mister Chair, with
accepting applications from
different land grants.
Uh, that will be applying for um
capital initiatives in their
specific land grants and
likewise, Mister Chair, we have
the asseka.
entity. And the second entity in
regards to this legislation.
Uh, has a bureau.
The second bureau within the
Interstate stream commission.
That basically will look at the
applications that come before it
regarding.
The new project funds that will
be available through this 1 1.1
bonding capacity.
And
The
Se bureau, uh,
We kind of review the
applications, a final
determination on what gets
prioritized and funded will lie
with the Interstate commission.
That's why we've separated the
two because they're two
different entities that that
kind of have two separate
different functions in terms of
The legislation before us.
Uh, in terms of applying the
service tax bonding.
Uh, funding
More specific
Uh, projects of the two
entities.
So Mr. Chairman,
If, uh, and representative if
the Asania Bureau underneath the
Interstate stream Commission
manages that process. We would
be able to use funds that go to
them.
Also, as stock stacked.
to match the dollars that come
through.
this bonding process.
Mr. Chair, to uh Palma to kind
of.
Respond to that.
Mr. Chairman and Representative
Lustrom, the, the Interstate
Street Commission would
Um, operate through the SI
bureau and and I wanna make sure
I understand your question, and
they um operate a current
program that's been there since
the 1980s, um, but they would,
uh, select the projects that
would um be um prioritized in
order to
So the, the tax bonds.
Excuse me, and what they, what
they do is they
Manage a grant cycle currently
where um a secus can apply
either for engineering design or
construction, and they have to
um upfront, make sure that those
kids are ready to proceed. They
have to be financially
compliant, um, they have to, um,
have
The easements in place, uh, all
of the things that are necessary
for the project to, to proceed
and um they have a, a completion
rate where um if they, they're
funded for uh fiscal year, they
are um expected to complete that
project within that fiscal year.
OK, so Mr. Chairman, basically
all I'm asking is that
Are we gonna be able to leverage
ISC dollars with this bond
money. That's all I'm asking,
um.
Mr. Chairman and Representative,
yes, because
that's exactly Mr. Chairman,
what we do with water trust
funds. They go through a whole
big planning process from the
Water Trust board.
And then, um, the priorities
are, are then identified.
For bigger water projects, so I,
I'm understanding that's how
this one would work. Is that, is
that correct, Mr. Chairman? The
answer is yes, the ISC leverages
federal funds, other state
funds. All right. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Thank you, Representative's
question and comments.
Representative so I'm sorry.
Thank you, chair. Uh, thank you,
Representative and presenters.
Um, I'm just trying to
understand.
Some of the language here, so,
and thank you to Representative
Lustrom for your questions too.
That would help clarifying. Um,
First, the uh state investment
council has some guidance for
the legislation, um, currently,
the bill structure for trust
fund distributions is to send
the percentage of the current
fund value as of July 1st of any
given year.
And the SIC says, uh, states in
the FIR that it's not standard
and might create some more and,
and will create more volatile
distribution levels year over
year, especially during times of
market volatility.
Uh, and so I'm wondering why.
Uh, the bill.
chose to uh do fund
distributions in this way,
rather than in other ways that
other funds have distributed,
um, their funds, um, based on 3
and 5 market uh fund valuations.
Thank you, chair.
Mr. Chair, um, and
representative Sima, um, I like
toy of Arturo, but.
Um
I want to state that
The reason that the SIC chimes
in on this legislation is
because of the trust fund.
We're starting out to trust fund
with $0.
Uh, but the land grants has
wanted to create a trust fund.
Uh
In foreseeing that possibility
in future years, there might be
contributions from.
From the legislature, there
might be grants from federal
government there might be
contributions by individuals,
entities, etc.
Um, we did address the concerns
that the SIC has in the
amendment.
But I like for Arturo to further
elaborate on.
What you're addressing.
And
Mr. Chair Representative Silva,
um, is, is Representative Garcia
mentioned the sort of the, what
this bill does is it has sort of
two different potential pots and
uh the trust fund is sort of the
long term vision immediately
what happens is it'll be getting
funding off of that bonding
capacity of the severance tax
bond, uh, and then the hope is
that we can sort of create um
over time, the ability to have
the trust fund in the event that
there's ever a downturn from
severance tax bonding capacity,
uh, and so the um
The fund itself, the trust fund,
wouldn't even go into effect for
5 years, so it's not till till
2031, um, and the
recommendations of the SIC made
um we considered in this
amendment to try to sort of make
that a little bit clearer for
them in terms of the
distributions and and match it
on par with what other other uh
current programs do.
Thank you, chair, and thank you,
um, representative. And so
there's 2.
There's 2 funds being created
with this legislation, and
there's already currently a fund
for Aseka, there's a Asean
community ditch fund. Is that
correct?
Mr. Chair, Representative
address that.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman and Representative
Silva, I can address questions
about the Energy stream
commission, there, there is a,
as I mentioned, the interstate
commission has operated in a
secu construction program since
1980s. It used to be funded
through a year to year
appropriation and House Bill 2,
and that was codified in 2019 as
the asse Community ditch
infrastructure Fund.
That gets to $0.5 million per
year from the irrigation works
construction fund, um, and
that's a trust fund that um is
attached to the Innerse stream
commission. The 2.5 million is,
is a good start, but it's, it's
not enough, and it's, it's part,
it's attached to that trust fund
and the reason that that was
kept separate is that the
reversions go back to the trust
fund. They don't stay in the
fund, and that it's a, it's a,
it's a successful project. It's
been in place,
Since fiscal year 22, um, fiscal
year 23 and 24, uh, they've had,
um good success in completing
projects. They've leveraged
federal funding from USDA, um,
they have a 90% completion rate
in the last fiscal year. Um,
however, the need is much
greater than can be met with a
2.5 million, and because of the
reversions and the complexity it
was deemed uh better to have a
project fund that's that's
attached to the severance tax
bond capacity.
Thank you, chair, uh, and thank
you, uh, Representative, and so
So there's that's fund.
Through the interstate stream
commission and then
This bill is asking for 2
additional funds that come out
of the severance tax bond. Is
that correct, Mr. Chairman.
That's correct.
OK. So,
Mr. Chair, representatives, so
my question is why not just
expand on the existing funds.
Um
Rather than creating two
Other funds.
Mr. Chair Representative.
Mr. Chairman and Representative
Silva.
As Representative Garcia
mentioned, the land grant has a
separate fund because the, the
needs are, are different and the
scope of the projects is
different and they're different
entities. And the Aseki side,
there is the, the irrigation, I
mean the um a second comedic
infrastructure fund that is
getting a 2.5 million
distribution or allocation from
the irrigation works
construction fund.
One of the first options we
explored was potentially um
Attaching the servants tax bond
capacity to an existing fund
and, and we, it was explained to
us that that wasn't
Um
Possible in the way it was
structured because we're dealing
with bonding capacity and, and
this fund had to be structured
around bonding capacity, whereas
that one is receiving a transfer
out of a trust fund, and we
can't increase that one.
Because the, the that trust fund
is
Um, does not have the capacity
to accommodate more secure
funding at this time. The, the
irrigation works construction
fund is being used to fund the
OSC ISC agency operations, and
so, um, we collaborate with the
agency, we want them to have
staff capacity, and so we, we
aren't able to.
Increase that 2.5 in that fund
to do that, so that's, that's
why we're looking for other ways
to fund a second infrastructure,
and because that 2.5 is, is uh,
not, not adequate.
It's a good start and it helps
us leverage and that that fund
is also used in part to fund
staff, and that was another
reason we had to have separate
funds because severance tax
funds.
Um, are more restricted.
OK.
Thank you, chair, and thank you,
Representative. Um,
Another question, uh, in the
bill, and this is another like
technical question, just talks
about uh July 1st disbursement
is impossible, um, because
Of the reconciliation process
that the SIC uses in terms of
evaluation and dispersing with
other funds, uh, and then so the
earliest, a June 30th evaluation
could be determined, which is
typically the cycle, the SIC
takes um based on unaudited
totals would be roughly July
21st, making a July 1st
distribution.
Impossible, and so, um, not sure
if the bill or the, if you all
have considered that.
Uh, in terms of amending that
technical piece of it for the
SIC
uh chair uh representative.
Uh, that was corrected in the
amendment.
Uh, in terms of
Following the advice of the SIC.
Excellent. Thank you. Sorry.
Trying to
Keep a lot in my head right now,
um, and then I think.
I think that's all my questions.
Thank you, Chair. Thank you,
Representative. Thank you,
Representative. Let's go to
Representative Terazas.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative.
Um
I'm Listening to this, and this
is um Mr. Chair, something very
similar to colonia's funding.
Um, structure, right?
And so,
Um, I know what you're trying to
accomplish and I understand it
because it, it does help you,
uh, because cos helps, you know,
those communities down there and
in southern New Mexico with
exactly very similar things that
you're, you're wanting to do up
in your area.
And, and so, um,
A couple of questions. One of
the, one of the reasons that I
didn't vote for the amendment
and I know we're not, we're on
an amendment bill amended bill,
is that I, I was, it changes the
FIR.
And I thought I was trying to
get, I was hoping we'd ease this
in.
Then taking such a big bite.
It, it almost doubles the FIR
and I could be wrong.
Um, and so I was trying to see
if we could get in, and I know
there's some language cleanup,
but I think when we went from 4
to 6.
I, I didn't know how to, you
know, how, how that would.
Um
Move forward and and rather than
just taking steps and moving you
in that direction, that's just
my own personal opinion. Mr.
Chair. Um, how would this be,
how is the structure different
than colonia's just so that I
can get a fair understanding,
um, or is it mirrored almost
like colonius Mr. Chair, um.
We have a lot of similarities.
In terms of uh
Uh, the Sea and uh
That buter infrastructure funds.
Um
We
We, uh, copy some of the
very beneficial aspects of the
colonial Infrastructure Fund.
Um
And there are some kind of
Um, um,
Other elements Mr. Chair, that
we can incorporate.
From the tribal
Um
And uh
I'm not sure in terms of the
water trust.
But
In terms of the binding
capacity, we're all like.
In terms of the bonding capacity
we're all alike, and by that I
mean that
Uh
There are two types of severance
tax bonds.
There's the, the long term.
Then your loan, and there's the,
the short term pond.
All infrastructure funds.
Uh, that I mentioned, uh, the
water trusts, the tribal
colonia, the housing Trust.
Basically fall under the short
term bun.
And so we're familiar, we're
similar in regards to that.
And um
Uh
And the reasons why we fall into
the short term.
Pond
Mainly because of the nature of
the disbursement for projects.
Um
And also, um,
And the, the 10 year life.
Uh, that the long term.
Um
One,
And caps on it.
But I'd like to yield to Arturo
if he has anything.
E to address in terms of
similarities and
And uh differences in the
legislation.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
Representative Tarazos, uh, yet
as Representative Garcia
mentioned, uh, land grant
communities, um, and the
communities, uh, similar to
colonials also have unmet
infrastructure needs, um, the
Current process for the land
grants is we have to sort of
piecemeal by going to individual
legislators and trying to sort
of create a full project and and
rarely have we ever been able to
fund a full project, uh, in any
one given, uh, fiscal year,
usually it takes several years
and it also takes getting um buy
in from legislators or even
outside of those land grants
districts because those rule
legislators don't have enough
capacity in terms of their
capitality to provide those
funds, um, directly for those
projects. So, um, you know, we
are fortunate that we work with
the land grant interim committee
and have been.
to get sometimes some of those
members to pull funds together
in order to sort of fund a
project, but it's still never a
full project. It's usually
phases of a project, um, which
is very similar to uh Colonias
communities prior to them.
feeding the infrastructure fund,
uh, similar to that fund and to
the other funds that were
mentioned.
As this would create a mechanism
where it would have an oversight
of a body with the land grant
council and then with the with
the interstate the commission
that would actually take those
applications, um, sort of vet
those projects and ensure that
their project ready before
funding so that we can get
completed projects out of those,
um, applications that come in
and and are approved. Um, so
it'll be very similar to the
colonia Infrastructure Fund in
that way, uh, and the
would also alleviate um the
legislator legislators from
having to go out and fund these
projects because we can then
direct our communities to this
fund only and not have to, um,
hassle along with you all to try
to fund these, these uh
infrastructure projects, um,
over time, uh, with that, Mr.
Chair. The other questions Mr.
Speaker, uh, representative, and
you've been a warrior for your,
for the land grants. You always
have been and I appreciate that
and I understand what you're
doing.
I understand exactly what you're
saying, Mr. Speaker Arturo, uh,
when, um,
Because it's hard, we don't get
enough, uh, uh.
Um, Ca hotly.
for the request.
And it takes a long time to to
fund some of that stuff, and
that's what I mean, I understand
exactly what you're trying to
do, and I, we appreciate it down
there.
In in southwestern Mexico having
colonials because it does help
us, uh, I just didn't, um, I I
don't wanna.
Keep going on and on, but I
Wondering how you, you know,
it's important. I'll, I'll make
the statement and I'll ask you a
question. Um, I think it's
important to have sol ready
projects.
Um, it's so important because,
you know, it one of the things,
and I don't know if you're gonna
work through a cog or I didn't,
I don't want to get that deep
into it, but um it's important
to be ready. Um, I think it's
helps, helpful to the
legislators in your area because
then you can leverage.
Um, the capital outly and a
little different way and in
plant design.
In the beginning, right?
So that you can just get you
that, just that little small leg
and it doesn't leverage all of
our funds where we can at least
help, but not be.
Harmful
Overburdened. I, I'll use that
so we can help more people.
So I think the important if this
is all work out for you guys,
Mr. Speaker. I think what's
important is
I don't know how you're gonna
categorize priorities. I think
that's, that's the next big
thing because everybody wants
their project done first, right?
Everybody, everybody's in need,
and I think that's a, that's,
that's, that's a big deal. So,
um, real quick and that's the
only question I think I'm gonna
ask you cause I, I could go on
and on about this, but having
those, those shovel ready
products you have projects, do
you have any that are already
in, in order, ready to roll, and
how are you gonna
Prioritize those, how is the how
is the system gonna work to say
this one's gonna be done first
before this one, and agreement
from all your grads and stuff.
Um
Charon.
I'd like to yie to Arturo, but
first of all, um,
Mr. Chair, um,
You know, land grants have been
coming to legislature, um.
For Ali request.
Um
Ever since they were granted
the, uh, you know, the
government status in 2004.
And
Uh
Um
15%
Uh, all of the, uh.
Of the projects that um
Land grants have brought forth.
Average around
700 to $900,000.
And these are reliable
initiatives, community centers,
wastewater water treatments.
Um
And uh
The thing is that
This year in particular, Mr.
Chair.
It just so happened
coincidentally.
The total request amounted to
$19 million.
And if we follow the
The pattern of past years.
Um
Only 15% of that will get
funded.
Mainly because we have no
capacity within the legislative
body to make
To, to kind of meet that big
demand, especially with these
high dollar projects.
So, uh, but I'd like to use to
Arturo to kind of go into the
process of the prioritization
because it is in the statute
that's in the House Bill 30.
Uh, the guidelines as to how we
proceed with that initiative.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman
Representative Tarazas, uh, yes,
so the, the bill itself requires
um for the rules to be
promulgated in terms of the how
this is going to be rolled out,
so that's something that on the
land grant side, the council's
going to be doing, um, should
the bill pass over the next
year, we'll make sure that we
get all that sort of in order
actually quicker than a year.
Um, Langrant's currently do, uh,
participate in the ICIP process,
so we do have uh a list of
projects, not only projects that
are sort of currently um looking
for.
funding but also projects down
the road on the horizon that are
sort of next in line. Uh, and
one of the beauties of, uh, this
fund is it will also allow for
um planning and design work, so
we'll be able to actually uh get
those projects that are down the
road and start working on those
engineering and and planning
design works, uh, in order for
them to sort of be ready when
they come for full funding, um,
uh, knowing that all the
planning work has been done in
advance, um, and that should
make the process more efficient
uh for funding projects and
getting them complete.
And Mr. Speaker, um, gentlemen.
Its drainage included here
because I in in that case excuse
me and colonials we have
drainage. Does that fall under
any category here that you've
listed.
Because I think some of you guys
may have some drainage issues.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, based on fires
and stuff like that that caused
any problems for any of you and,
and so is that included in your
bill? I see major water systems,
but that to me is.
Waterways, clean water, maybe
um.
I don't know, riprap stuff like
that, but I don't see drainage
and it, it, it just
That's, that was my last
question.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Representative Duncan.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um,
I'm gonna ask you to educate me
if you would, and I'll ask you
in a question for him so you can
educate me.
Um
Tell me what the difference is
between a land grant and an
unincorporated part of the
county.
If you would, Mister Chair.
Um
Mr. Cherson of Duncan, uh,
As of 2004, we passed the
milestone legislation.
That uh
Uh, it was a major reform.
piece of legislation.
Um
That established.
Uh, land grants.
And uh you know the government.
And um
Soul
La grants.
Since 2004.
Um
Um
Have the same political status
as a municipality.
The county government, a school
board.
Conservancy District, etc. etc.
The only difference is that
And grants don't have.
Um, taxation authority or
bonding authority.
And uh
Um
Unincorporated areas have no
local government status.
While land grants have local
government status.
So thusgras are able to
Seek
Capital outlay funding.
Uh, from the legislature.
Um
And also uh that milestone
legislation 2004.
Also kind of um
Um, modernized.
Uh, the governance structures of
land grants.
In terms of like how they elect
the board of trustees.
In terms of the election itself.
In terms of the Meetings Act.
Uh, etc. etc.
And uh so that is the
fundamental difference between
an unincorporated body.
And the land grant as a unit of
government.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So,
Why wouldn't you bring a bill
forward that says you can tax
and you can bond as opposed to
bringing this forward and taking
off the top of the state.
Mr. Chara to Arturo.
Um, Mr. Chairman, Representative
Duncan, uh, that has sort of
been an issue for land grant
communities in terms of uh not
having um that taxing authority
and I guess the the question
there would be the, the type of
taxing authority, um, again,
most of these communities are
within those rural areas, so we
know that, um, for example, the,
um, most of them don't have uh
small businesses within them.
They're, they're very small
towns, so they wouldn't benefit
from a um grocery receipts tax
would wouldn't really make
sense. And then in terms of
property taxes, um, land grants.
Currently, most migrants don't
pay property taxes, uh, on their
parcels of land, um, so they are
taxpayers, but they, they, they
don't have taxing authority, um,
and I, I don't know that, uh,
you know, part of the issue for
language communities is that
their original boundaries have
shrunk over time based on uh
encroachments and land losses
from a variety of different
reasons, uh, and so, you know,
the question would be then what
would those boundaries be in
terms of what would that tax
base be for who would be
actually paying taxes, um, as to
whether or not that could
generate revenue.
It's something that we have not
explored, Mr. Chairman.
OK. Thank you Mr. Cha, um, and,
and witness, did you just state
that um land grants don't pay
property taxes.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, can, uh, we do
have some land grants that have
gotten some of their properties
exempted for example those that
are um for communal purposes, so
those that are using um
community centers and those type
of functions, um, but we still
have land grants in some of the
counties that still tax those
like the common lands that that
are vacant.
OK, so,
Miss Chair and Representative,
so all the farmland is, is taxed
at the farm land rate, I assume.
Mr. Chairman, uh,
Representative, uh, for the most
part, but they don't really, uh,
for those, it's kind of a
difficult thing though because
it'll be an agricultural
exemption, um, if they have, um,
for example, cattle operations,
but they're owned by individual
sort of heirs and so there's a,
it's the land grant is the
entity who sort of has the
property but then those cattle
are sort of tax different and so
there's different counties do it
differently, but yeah, uh,
essentially, um, most land
grants do get uh like
agricultural exemption.
In his chair and and expert and
why wouldn't you come back and
try to change the taxing on that
so that you can have a tax base.
Mr. Chairman, uh, Representative
Duncan, we, uh, we have in the
past, uh, through the interim
committee tried to address sort
of looking at the tax base and
how it sort of works for
language communities, um, and
because of the ductation issues,
to my understanding, part of the
issue is that that goes back to
um
A constitutional question,
constitutional issues, um that
would that I don't even know
that the the body itself could
do all of that in terms of what
the needs are for the Laing
communities.
Thank you, Mr. Thank you for
that answer. I, I, I certainly
don't know much about land
grants at all. Um, and, and so
I'm, I'm just trying to wrap my
mind around this, uh, this
issue.
I think,
I think the bill is muddy first
off. I'll state that right now.
I have no problem correcting a
wrong.
No problem.
Um, where I have a problem is
when this bill takes it off the
top and and then the state has
to take 2nd place, um, on this
project, I would much rather
have seen a bill that said we're
going to give you $5 million
this year. We're going to give
you $5 million next year.
Come back, we're gonna give you
another $5 million non-recurring
funding.
For this.
Um
But I think you've answered it.
um.
Your needs are great. There's no
doubt about it.
But we could listen for the next
30 days or
15 days, however many days we
have left to everybody else
whose needs are great as well.
And I don't think this is the
right way to do it.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative.
by McGinn.
Good morning, Representative and
sponsors. I really appreciate
this conversation. Um, I was
grateful to have the opportunity
to check in with both of your
experts uh representative Garcia
before this debate, so I've had
some of those conversations, but
we'll ask some of those same
questions again, um, like it's
been said, you, uh, certainly
have demonstrated that your
needs are expensive and they're
expensive as well. Um, the
question I have, Mr. Chair, uh,
relate back to what
The, the redistribution of the
bonding capacity or the
direction of the bonding
capacity towards these new
funds, what impact that would
have on the bonding capacity.
Right
Other parts of the state and
including the capital outlay
dollars that um we traditionally
then allocate towards needs
overwhelmingly in our
communities, but can we speak to
that? What, what impact would
this have on the bonding
capacity, the remaining bonding
capacity and in particular for
capital outlay dollars.
Mister Chair and
Um, Representative vice chair,
um,
When I stated at the beginning,
um, the presentation that there
was no fiscal impact.
I was basically alluding to the
impact on the general fund.
And, uh, but the chairman was
correct that there is an impact
in terms of
The Sara bonding capacity.
What we're doing with this
legislation in terms of the.
Infrastructure fund and the
Then Grant Mercer infrastructure
fund.
is that we're putting it on the
pie chart.
Putting it on the pie chart of
Sarah sex bonding capacity.
And I mentioned that
That we already have
infrastructure funds.
That um pull from the bond
sales, uh, for their
Capital projects.
The water trust fund at 9%, um.
Trial at 4.5 now with the
amendment at 6.5.
Colonia 4.5, the housing trust
run at 2.5, and the
Aseka and the Mercer 1.1.
And
Um
We don't know
Mr. Chair, you know what?
boredominance.
We calculate.
In terms of the dollar amount.
For the bonding capacity.
Until that happens.
You know, we do have
Some estimates from the 2014.
Um
And um
Um
The thing is, with the body
capacity, um,
There will be
And an impact, and I'll be.
Straight up with you that there
will be an impact.
Especially regarding the.
And the um
On the infrastructure funds.
But again
What is also key with this
legislation is legislative
intent.
I mean, we, we deal with these
issues all the time.
And kind of kind of come to this
bridge in terms of impact.
But
A lot of us
approaches from a common sense
basis, need basis, and we make
these changes.
And that's what we're bringing
forth with this legislation.
But also keep in mind, manager,
Mr. Jason and vice chair.
That
In years
Where we use general fund.
to fund local projects.
You know, uh,
That amount.
Uh, does not come off of Temer's
tax parts.
So that amount that would that
would
In the regular year where we're
using similar tech bonds.
That amount will go to local
projects goes into the permanent
texts.
The severance tax permanent
fund.
So there's a, there's a game in
terms of that type of scenario.
And uh in our
And I'm not calling it measly
because it is an impact 1.1, 190
million.
1.1, 194 said cousin.
Ourselves
But in the overall scheme of
things, Madam chair.
Um
I think it's our investment in
the impact.
will be well
Served
And while addressed in terms of
enhancing.
All your life.
economic development,
prosperity.
You know, in our 9 rand and in
our communities.
No, Arturo all that wants to
also.
Address.
But, uh, so to make sure I'm
understanding this, with that
estimated 40 million be 40
million that wasn't available
for the capital outlay bonding
capacity.
Uh
I like to address that.
Or we also have LFC economists
here that could maybe speak to
that. I just want to make sure
I'm understanding this. Brendan,
if you would please.
Good morning, uh, Mr. Chair,
committee members. My name is
Brendan Gray, economist at LFC,
um, your question, Madam Vice
Chair.
was whether this bill would
reduce uh the current uh bonding
capacity. The answer is yes. Uh,
this is not in the framework.
Um, and so the current capacity
that's been identified by
legislators would be reduced
proportional to.
Uh, the 40 million that's in the
FAR plus about 35 million um
from the amendment.
75.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I
understand that um these numbers
change because it's Severance
tax bonds, so we're looking at
estimates and of course that
depends on the volatility of the
oil and gas market. Um, so I, I
Appreciate that clarity. I also
want a name that what I
appreciate most about your bill
is that it gets us to have a
conversation about
Thinking through how we use this
bonding capacity to improve
equity in particular for rural
New Mexico. Um, certainly, I
think this, the context and the
backdrop for this bill is our
capital outlay process and, um,
Mr. Chair, so when I, when I
look at the list of
For instance, uh, projects being
requested for our members in
Albuquerque, that looks very
different than the kind of
expensive, wide ranging requests
that we can hardly ever meet um
for real New Mexico and, and I
sort of sit in between that
because I represent a district
that's pretty urban and in one
of New Mexico's biggest cities.
Uh, so I appreciate that this
lends us to a conversation about
how we think.
It's appropriate to fund those
needs in real New Mexico. What
is coming up for me, um, Mr.
Chair, is that we aren't yet
Talking about reforms to capital
outlay that might be needed to
distribute those dollars more
equitably. I think this could be
part of the conversation. Um, I
think the last thing I would
say, Mr. Chair is the
distinction for me and what's
being proposed here and the
water trust board, the waterru
board applies to all the state.
And those water systems, whether
they're in my district, Mr.
Chair, or any of our districts
could go forward to the water
trust board with potentially
eligible projects. Um, I've
asked your experts already about
this, um, Mr. Representative
Representative Garcia, but can,
can you explain why the Aseki
Association can't go to the
water trust board, for instance,
like the mutual water domestic
systems that I represent.
material to Paul to address
that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and vice
chairwoman but then uh.
The
Asecas have, uh, for decades.
primarily to the interstate
stream Commission for
Infrastructure funding in part
because that program is tailored
to how the Asekis operate.
And um even though I said kids
are eligible for the Water Trust
port, they tend to not go to the
water trusts board, uh, only a
handful have been funded by the
Water Transport and and in part
it's because the secondcus are
operated by uh they're governed
by volunteers and the
application process is uh vastly
more difficult for the water
trusts board compared to
interstate stream commission,
uh, sometimes it's a loan grant
combination, and a seconds don't
have the, the capacity to, to uh
manage.
problems of those sizes, uh, for
larger projects in particular,
they don't have uh taxing
authority, um, they don't have a
rate structure like mutual
domestics, uh, where people pay
a monthly rate. Um, they have a
small assessments, they're
balances for a typical sick care
probably under $5000 per year in
revenue, um, in some sectors
don't even collect uh um
assessments regularly unless uh
they have a special need that
they're collecting for. So the,
the ISC
program does not require a
cashier, although they're
incentivized to provide a local
cost share. Um, so I think
that's the reason, but we looked
at the data since 2020, which
was online for water trusts
board and there hasn't been a
single Asea project funded by
them, and when a when a secus
have applied, it's, it's very
competitive. They're competing
with cities and even mutual
domestics even though they're
small and they're like our
sister organizations, um, they
often have more access to um um
engineers and
And uh
They, they are uh even have more
capacity than a sick, even
though they don't have as much
capacity as a city.
That, that's my answer. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman and
Representative.
Thank you. My last point, um,
just the distinction I
appreciate and I think it's
certainly my New Mexico values,
values that we've set aside the
money we have for the tribal
infrastructure fund, and I like
that you're trying to um bring
back up those levels that were
dropped before. My last point is
that distinctly in the colonial
Development Fund, um, of course,
that difference matters. The
colonias are not eligible to
come to the state for capital
LA. So my understanding of that
fund was that we are creating a
different mechanism.
Because they are not recognized
as government entities and did
not have capacity to come to the
state to request dollars like
the land grants and seos do. So
I think this is a conversation
we should be having and I hope
we keep having it in the context
of capital labor reform
generally. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Madam Vice
Chairwoman. Uh, there was a
couple of comments that I wanted
to make to wrap this all up, uh,
but I have to get to another
committee, so I want to be able
to call for a vote, but uh I
appreciate your your time this
morning and, and really because
of the impact it does have, we
recognize that and we recognize
that to your point,
Representative Vice Chairman of
the
capital Ali system is, is, uh,
it's broken. I mean, there,
there, there's no doubt about it
that when people say that uh
those local communities don't
get the benefit that the urban
communities receive. that's,
that's not a surprise. I mean,
when you have
15 uh representatives, you know,
in Albuquerque, for instance,
right? They're, they're gonna
pull their money and they're
gonna have tens of millions of
dollars to work on. And again,
this is not to be offensive, um.
beautification programs, right?
and stuff like that. So when
those are going on, people in
more rural communities are in
land grants or CAS are, are
looking at rehabbing their lands
or providing electricity or or
digging out ditches that have
been long um.
Overrun by by by invasive
species, right? So there's a lot
of issues that are that are
going on today that we recognize
that if, if we intend to
Do something that, that's
That's important, you know, this
is, this is important, at least
for, for one legislator that is
a rancher and a farmer, and I
take that extremely uh seriously
because when I know that um
other people are taking care of
their, of their lands and their
ditches and their sacs. That
means the water can get to me
faster and then I can get it to
downstream faster so it's it's,
it's a cycle and it it's, it's
honestly a partnership that we
all share in this, in this
state. And so that being said,
I, I can appreciate this, uh,
Representative Duncan, ranking
member Duncan, we went through
the
practice and with Representative
Gallegos of negotiating the,
the, the text or the capital
outlay package this year and we
recognize that there's a lot of
discrepancies. We recognize the
faults, we recognize that
there's a lot of things that can
be done differently, uh,
recognizing that back in 2005
when TIFF was created, that was
uh
Uh, a change in priorities and
that was meaningful for those
tribal infrastructure fund
recipients back in 2010 when
they followed up with the
colonies infrastructure fund,
again, following the same kind
of note in 15 years later, here
we are. So I recognize the need.
I recognize that, that, uh, you
know, 75 million is 75 million,
but at the end of the day, um,
you know, I, I'm, I'm one vote
on this committee and I want to
just bring it up to the
committee as that in terms of
how you all want to handle this
and how it, how it proceeds or
doesn't so.
That being said, what's the
pleasure of the community? Will
we do that.
second.
There's a movie do pass by
representative Speaker Martinez,
seconded by Representative
Chandler. Please call the rule.
Representative Chandler, yes.
Representative Duncan. No, I
like to explain my vote.
Representative Cabos.
Yes.
Representative Henry.
Pass.
Representative Hernandez.
And
Representative Henry, did you
say OK.
Representative Lindstrom.
Yes
Representative Martinez.
Yes. Representative Montoya.
Representative Pajuan.
No, and I'd like to explain my
book.
Will continue.
Represented.
Representative Silva.
Uh, no, and I'd like to explain
my book.
Representative Terazas.
Representative Carina, vice
chair.
Yes.
Representative Chairman.
We got 10 to 3.
Although, yes.
Yes.
OK.
do that.
No, it's 03.
I have Duncan,
no.
OK, committee, I'm just gonna
read these notes out loud to
make sure we got them right.
Representative Chandler was a
yes.
OK.
Or extra confusion, she is no
longer see. Representative
Duncan was a no.
Representative Gallego, Henry,
yes, Hernandez, yes, Lindstrom,
yes. Speaker Martinez, yes.
Representative Montoya, no.
Representative Paramon yes,
Rev Silva, no.
Representative Therasas, yes,
myself, yes, Chair Linte, yes.
So we have a dures a vote of 10
to 3. Uh, we have a few members
that would like to explain their
vote, starting with
Representative Silva.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, presenters. Um, I just felt
that legislation was a little
messy and could have been
cleaner, um.
And um,
I think I take responsibility
for also I should have taken
more time with this piece of
legislation, um, but it was just
a lot to wrap my head around,
uh, fiscally and uh the impacts
to the state Investment council,
so, um, and I also echo all the
comments made in terms of the,
the needs, so thank you. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you, uh,
representative. Thank you,
Representative Montoya.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
I, there's definitely need that
we've had this discussion. I, I
believe that as uh uh Chairman L
Lente stated, I think that there
has to be comprehensive.
reform to how we do capital
outlay. Um, it, it, I believe
for far too long, the big needs
and the great land mass across
the state of New Mexico is
ignored, um, just because of the
concentration and the greater
concentration that will continue
to happen as migration goes to
our bigger communities. So I
think this is a this is an
answer. I don't believe it was
the right answer. Um, I think we
need to fix that process, um,
and I, I do believe that uh
If this would have been in a
smaller amount, I probably would
have voted for it. I think it
was a, this is a big ask from
the front end of the budget,
which uh I I think that that
just represents uh
too many taxpayers across the
state of New Mexico. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Representative
Duncan.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
One, I thought the bill was.
Cloudy
The way it was, the amendment
was put on. Second thing, and I
asked the question over and over
and over about taxation.
It's easy to help my kids when
they're helping themselves.
When you're not, when you don't
have tax base, that's the first
thing that um unincorporated
parts of the county look at,
say, OK, if I want to be a city,
I want to act like a city, and I
need to work on my tax base. You
didn't work on your tax base,
and that's one of the reasons I
voted against this.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you committee. Next we're
going to House Bill 357. Thank
you, Representative Garcia.
OK, OK.
Representative Cates, when
you're ready.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you committee. I'm here to
present a house Bill 357. Um,
it's uh for me uh GRT waiver.
So, um, let me walk you around
what what media is. So, uh, the
developmental disability waiver
is way our state uh provides and
pays for services for
individuals with disabilities,
uh, using a 4, sometimes 5 time
match with Medicaid funds.
Witness uh waiver was put into
place, um, we had a, a media
product, but in the 2014, 15,
2016 at a time period, our
federal government, um, started
requiring such services to have
an option for more independent
individuals. They just needed
support so that they can live a
more independent life. We took
um the media services which were
already in place.
Kind of define them, hone them,
um, at that time period, and so,
uh, at that time period, then
all of a sudden we had uh all
not just nonprofits, but we had
privately owned businesses who
wanted to provide me via
services to provide OTPTSOP, but
other sorts of support services
for that.
They um have to charge GRT. So,
if it's a set budget for the
media services.
The individuals who are choosing
a company, a private company to
provide those services are
getting less services than those
who have chosen a nonprofit due
to taking the GRT out.
This makes an equitability for
uh healthcare for the same um uh
person as well, um, and just so
you know, a lot of uh people uh
a lot of individuals on the
waiver who are picking services
in rural areas or smaller areas,
they have less to choose from,
and really those private
companies are the only options
for that. Today I have two
expert witnesses, um, I have
Joel Davis.
here who will introduce you and,
and he's gonna be your new
favorite presenter cause he has
lots of great numbers for you,
and then um I have Tracy Perry,
who is president of one of these
uh privately owned companies to
provide me services across the
state. And so if I could uh hand
it over for a brief statement to
my expert witnesses. Thank you.
Good morning, chairwoman,
members of the committee. My
name is Joel Davis. I'm the vice
president of Elevate the
Spectrum, and I'll volunteer
nonprofit made up of family
members, self advocates, and
professionals.
We are here to support this
bill.
Um
This helps to fix an inequity
that has happened because of the
way the system was created.
Um, in the past when we first
created this system, the state
was providing all the services,
so there was no GRT going out.
Uh, the previous administration
towards the end changed it so
that there were more private
contractors coming in, um, and
that made it so that uh we could
expand into more rural areas and
the for-profit companies are
being the ones that are
expanding to the more rural
areas.
So somewhere in the mix, they
were working on this. We had
overturn, uh, one of the
directors got sick and now we
switched over to a new system,
and so this inequity is kind of
just stayed there as a result of
How the bureaucracy has worked
over the years.
Um
Just for an example, uh, and,
and kind of how the complexity
works is.
Take away whether it's a
nonprofit or a for-profit.
Each individual is in a
different county and they get a
different gross receipts tax. So
if you're in Las Cruces where
the gross receipts tax is
8.065%. They deduct $6,914.71
from your budget, and that's
taken away from services. So
those folks get $7 almost $7000
less of services. If you're in
hatch where the grocery receipt
tax is a little lower. Your
budget's about $500 higher, and
this is how it is across the
state, and then these people are
expected also to keep track of
these gross receipts, budgets
and how much they're spending.
And it does cause overages here
and there because of that
complication with the system,
you know, we're not expecting
these families to be experts.
Um
If you look at the numbers on
this, uh, we do want the gross
receipts tax paid here. We, we
make a net gain in the state
from this, um.
Or what this bill would cost as
far as an investment to the
state would be $7.2 million in
fiscal year 26, but that would
bring us $18.3 million in
federal revenue, uh, for the
federal match at 72%.
Um
If you look at your
From, yes, for Medicaid funds.
Um,
The physical implications, there
are some increased costs uh of
implementing this about uh
$60,000 that's HCA could absorb.
Uh, but importantly, uh, this
also increases gross receipts
tax to the rural areas too and
and local grocery receipts
taxes. These folks are in every
county, every municipality in
the state, uh, for the general
fund, we're looking at an
increased impact of 13.1 million
over FY 26, uh, growing to 14.5
million by 2029 to the general
fund and our local government
funds that will go from 12 12.6
million FY 26 to 14.
Million uh in FY 29, it's about
a half a million dollars dollar
increase each year thereafter.
I'm so sorry. Just to make sure
that we're all on the same
plate, so this that's how it the
the the bill would waive the GRT
but we would increase the
Medicaid funds, and you
understand, uh, they, they, they
are much better than I, but
thank you very much. I just
wanna make sure that you
understand the buckets. Thanks
by pulling out the, the, the,
the money from the budget, it
will cost the state $7.5 million
in a, in a investment towards
the federal government, but we
do get that match back.
Actually, just to be clear, your
bill's not
GRT waiver. It's with directing
them to charge for the GRT. So
yes, there's a cost to the
state. It would be an increase
to the Medicaid program budget,
but it's not a DRT waiver
exemption just to make sure
we're clear with the tax
committee, um, but yes, um,
presenters and experts, yeah,
because if that happens, we're
having a different conversation
and you're getting table today
for sure. So this is not a DRT
exemption.
I would just ask as you wrap up
your presentation at least.
my sake.
You started a few steps ahead of
me. I don't understand the media
waiver program and how it's
distinct from the DD waiver, so
just as you wrap up your
presentation, if you could make
sure in 2 minutes that you help
us understand what this is and
how it's actually a program that
New Mexicans are, are eligible
for, so if we could go back to
the beginning of that part, um,
and then I think we'll be able
to debate your, your bill, but
that part would be helpful.
Thank you, madam, or Madam
representative. OK, thank you so
much, man. Thank you very much
for that clarification.
my chair and and it. So uh are
we provide um through uh our our
the federal government requires
us to provide uh uh disability
services, um, but each state
gets to do it a little
differently. So we have DD
waiver, which you usually are
high or higher needs individuals
that may require some kinds of
services 24 hours a day. Then we
have individuals who can live
mostly independent lives with.
supports job coaching, OTPT
maybe some residential interrupt
you one more time. So we aren't
the health committee. I think
I'm following you, but um, can
we say those things out.
What is the
therapy, speech language
pathology may be nutrition
classes. These are supports, so
individuals can live more
independent lives.
This became, uh, we, we've,
that's always been a goal of
ours, but this became a further
requirement by the federal
government during this time
period in 1415, 16, and so our
state decided to take the via
program and kind of refine it to
meet that independent um support
need for the waiver program.
This was, is that clear? If I
can ask one more question
because this isn't on the bill
just to make sure our committee.
an understanding. New Mexicans
that have these needs go to
apply to who and get accepted
into either DD waiver program or
the MA waiver program. I am so
sorry, Madam Chair and
representatives. So the DD
waiver program is program how
state provides disability
services, you can register as
early as birth if uh your child,
uh it is one of the requirements
to be on the waiver is to I've
been born with a disability, so
it's not all.
Disabilities. They're very
specific disabilities. Um, and
that, but there are several ways
that they implement these
programs that can help res uh it
can be medical attention, it
could be residential, it can be
life skills so that they can
maintain jobs and be able to to
help with their independence.
Um,
The higher needs.
Individuals receive waiver,
traditional waiver services uh
we also have something even
super higher need for children
called medically fragile, but
the, the majority are in that DB
waiver, but we do have
individuals with disabilities
who are able to maintain jobs,
maybe live independently as long
as somebody's helping them with
grocery shopping or or
maintaining things, and that is
our individuals that we're
talking about in this movie
program. Was that clear?
Just very quickly, I just want
to know how they get into that
program. How do New Mexicans get
into this program and then we'll
wrap your presentation and go to
the public comments, but yes,
thank you Madam,
you've applied to DDSD, uh, you
have to show that is DDSD I'm
just
disability services division.
They've changed, they've merged
everything into the healthcare
authority at this point, but you
have to have extensive
evaluations, uh, medical, uh,
you have to show a long term uh
issue that you're not gonna.
to be self-sufficient throughout
your life, for instance, my
daughter's on the waiver. She's
always going to be with us or
with the caregiver. It's those
folks who are getting these, the
traditional waiver, there's more
service providers involved. They
have a care manager and a lot
more costs. It's a higher cost
service. This one's about
$40,000 more. Families or
guardians can take those
individuals and get the services
they need more quickly without
all the, the, the middle people
and they can also, um, it's a
lot cheaper than the stadium.
Thank you.
You, Madam Representative, are
you ready to go to the public,
public comment. I am chair.
Thank you very much and to
confirm and clarify, you don't
have any amendments or committee
subs today.
That is correct. OK, we will
start with doom. If you are
online joining us over Zoom and
would like to speak in support
of opposition to HB 357. Please
raise your hand. Jill will begin
with you, and you have one
minute. Thank you.
Hi, my name is Jill Mart.
I am on this waiver.
Um, just happened to be on the
akait watching it and noticed
that this came up next. This is
very important for us. I live in
a rural community. It is very
hard for us to find the services
we need, um.
And especially caregivers, it's
just almost impossible, um, I've
gone more than half a year at
times without care because I
can't find a caregiver in this
area. Um, we also have problems
accessing other services like OT
and PT is mentioned before, um,
this is, this is very important
to us as a community.
And I would very much appreciate
you passing this. Thank you.
Thank you for staying on Jill,
and providing your insight. Do
you have anyone else online that
would like to speak in support
our opposition.
We will now go to the room. Is
there anyone here that would
like to speak in support or
opposition to this bill, please
line up.
Uh, Santa Fe City Council Clar
Faulkner, uh, my district has a
large population of
high risk and high need, um,
constituents in this legislation
will definitely help them access
the services they need.
Thank you. We now go to
committee.
For
Representative Duncan.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I think
the only question I had, I
understand what you're doing,
um, and I have no problem with
that at all. Um, the local
communities will love it.
Um, and I just wanted to know
what service and I think you
kind of hit on those and, and so
that's what I was curious about
what type of services you
provide, so.
Thank you, madam chair and thank
you committee. I, I would like
to have um Tracy Perry answer
that since she uh runs the
company that provides those
services that you just.
Yeah
The heightened
amount of chair, members of the
committee. My name is Tracy
Perry. Um, I work for a direct
care provider down in Las
Cruces, and the media program
has the residential supports,
there are therapies, there's
massage therapy, um, employment,
um, they have services where
they can go with groups with
other individuals, they have the
um uh community individual where
they
The one on one out in the
community with a, a staff or
Whoever they choose. Um, it is a
self-directed program. Um, I do
want to add in real quick that
we do see a lot of the
individuals, they will get the
in-home living service and that
takes up a majority of their
budget, and they will get this,
the day hab services and go out
in the community, but there is
not enough left for the therapy
support due to the financial
burden of the GRT taken out of
the budget, so this would be
very beneficial.
That's great. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
And Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Duncan, uh,
there's like representative case
that was speech language
therapy, there's occupational
therapy. It could be, um,
Daytime or nighttime underwear
for folks that are incontinent.
It can be respite services for
families so that they can work
and be viable members of the
community. There's a number of
services that are qualified and
it's, it's very important to
these folks.
Any other questions
representative? Oh, OK, let's
then go to a representative
lunch.
When you're ready, Mr. Chairman,
I just moved for to pass.
Yeah
Very good. We have a motion and
the second by Representative uh
Gallegos before that, let's go
to Representative Cadena.
Just quickly, thank you, Mr.
Terry. I wanted to make sure I
was understanding this program.
I'm not familiar with it, so a
New Mexican apply that has these
demonstrated needs applies to
this program, they are
evaluated, they are um accepted
into this program and what
you're telling us is that right
now, they may be in a different
part of New Mexico. We all know
they are facing different GRT
rates and so even though the
program is designed to make sure
that they get the same budget to
spend on services, no matter
where they are because the GRT
is not um being accounted for.
They are in fact receiving a
disparate amounts which changes
their access to service. So what
you're asking for here, and I
see lots of nodding, is that
we're actually not changing tax
structure, but we're directing
ACA or attempting to direct to
direct the healthcare authority
to um include the GRT for those
services after the individual
receives their allotted amount
that we've already deemed
they're eligible for. OK, I see
lots of yeses. I wanted to make
sure I understand that we saw
some nodding.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
And man I have one more thing,
and then that that amount that
was taken up by JRT becomes
eligible for the matching funds
of the federal, so it actually
generates money. Thank you very
much Mr. Chair.
Thank you. Any anybody else? If
not, we have a motion for the
second, uh, please call.
Representative Chandler.
Representative Duncan, yes.
Representative C Gallegos, yes.
Representative Henry.
Representative Hernandez.
Representative Munstrom.
Represent
Yes, ma'am. Representative
Martinez.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Baron.
Representative Silva, yes.
Representative Terazas.
Representative Madam Vice Chair
Kavina,
and
Representative Madam Vice Chair
Kavina yes and
chair. Yes ma'am.
You vote.
You do best. Thank you both and
thank you all.
Moving on to House Bill 477
lodgers tax exemption for
legislators, Representative
Lustrom.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and good
morning, everyone. I bring to
you House Bill 477 and boy, it
really, it's really uh hard for
me to hear the title on this and
I, I can tell you that when uh
And that was drafted in that
way. There was lots of very
direct conversations with
legislative council about that.
Because it looks like and when
you read the the fiscal uh
report about how this is
compromised and it's an ethics
issue and all this other stuff,
It really sent me through the
ceiling because this bill
actually, Mr. Chairman and
members, the and we fixed it in
uh.
In the last committee is a
committee substitute, that ties
back to the 2nd session of 2020.
The house tax and revenue
Committee substitute for House
Bill 117 amended the lodgers
tax. So what I have is the bill
that actually changed what we've
always had and that is after a
30 day period of time in any
hotel anywhere you are uh not
responsible then for paying
lodgers tax, so I had
legislative council actually do
some research and pulled this
out for us.
So
Uh, I know exactly where it was
removed, uh, in 2020, Mr.
Chairman.
So what the substitute does is
it provides for um
The ability of not having to pay
lodger's tax after 30 days.
And that does in full disclosure
affect legislators that live in
hotels.
Oh, that's me. I'm one of those
legislators, but there's a whole
bunch of other people that tie
into this and.
When you think about things like
fire evacuees.
You think about what happens
with domestic violence shelters
when those shelters are full or
they put people.
You think about and I've learned
this recently.
My school district, if they have
unhoused, the term used to be
called homeless high school
kids. Guess where they put them,
put them in hotels.
Uh, so there's a whole bunch of
different instances where um 30
day and longer stays are done.
The other thing that I'm, I'm
concerned about, Mr. uh Mr.
Chairman and committee is how
these, how this FIR was done.
When I look at page 4.
Attachment A and it says
lodger's tax receipt for New
Mexico municipalities and
counties.
2022 fiscal year lodger's tax
report.
This is the total for each
community.
This is not what represents a
thirty-day consecutive period.
So this is misleading. So what
this does is when you read it,
it's like, oh my God, my
community is gonna lose $2
million.
When in reality, that's not what
this bill does.
I, I think that because of the
title of the bill, Mr. Chairman.
The fact that there was 0
research done by the Legislative
council drafter.
Um
It's probably, it probably be
tabled anyway, but I just feel
that when you look at these FIR
reports and I'm looking at the
first page of the Episcopal
impact report and it says FY 26.
And uh for municipalities, it
was $7 million but it's $7
million for every year. That's a
stagnant number.
How can that be the projection
for every year.
For all municipalities.
So I questioned the information
that's here.
I questioned the fact that there
was poor drafting here.
My intent here is to try to
correct what was picked up in a
bill that was done in 2020.
When the speaker was the
chairman of this committee, we
had to, you know, we had to, we
were doing a lot in those, in
those days to try to get this.
But um I mean at this point,
well, all I was trying to do was
to correct.
What we had done in 2020 and to,
you know, just make everybody
aware that these 30-day stays
are not just for legislators.
Uh, for everybody, and it's not
just for the capital city.
If you read the, if you read the
committee substitute. So, um, I,
I hope that we just roll this
bill, Mr. Chairman, or table it
because I think just having the
title alone, and I, I tell you
when I saw that, and this was
right before our deadline to
submit legislation.
There's some direct conversation
with that drafter.
Because it makes it sound like,
you know, here's Patty
Blundstrom trying to get a, you
know, rebate on lodger's tax
because I spent, I spent 60 days
up here. I, I actually spent 62
days up here during a 60-day
session, and I stay in a hotel,
but anyway, I think it is
something that hopefully we can
talk about in the interim, Mr.
Chairman. I think it's an
important thing to think about.
I don't think that what LFC put
in here is correct. This is just
total numbers.
It doesn't really get into.
What was an actual hit to a
community. How many communities
actually have residents that
stay 30 days. Now we did during
the pandemic, Mr. Chairman and
Gallup, because our community
was shut down.
Nobody in and nobody out. You
might remember that.
So a lot and we don't neatly
have all the employees that work
in Gallup live in Gallup. They
live right outside the city, so
they're moving in to hotels
because they weren't allowed to
go in and out.
For a period of time. So there's
some unique situations, Mr.
Chairman, like that throughout
the state, but
I, I think we ought to, you
know, to take this kind of thing
up in the interim, and I, I
Feel like some of the, some of
this analysis just
Isn't correct, and it and it
gives a misleading impression of
what the bill does.
Thank you, Representative
Lindstrom, uh, at your request,
we will roll this bill, but
appreciate you recognizing that
and we worked the interim on
this matter.
All right, thank you. Thank you
for all the members, thank you
for your work today.
Every day.
