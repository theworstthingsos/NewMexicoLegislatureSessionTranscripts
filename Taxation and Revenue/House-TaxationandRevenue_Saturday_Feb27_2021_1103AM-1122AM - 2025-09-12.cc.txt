even at late we're rolling we

Members of Representative Harper
and I have been working with the
staff over the last.
Couple of days but certainly
over the last few hours trying
to figure out
the
the table bills that I think we
want to start getting out
we're a little bit under a time
crunch is you know we've got to
get start getting things off to
the floor and and over the
Senate so today we're gonna I'm
gonna propose that we.
In two bills off the table
both of these we heard in the
last few days one of this house
bill fifteen.
A committee substitute for House
Bill fifteen and the other one
is house bill two sixty two
thank.
Representative Harper and I are
working on it.
Thank you your in Santa Fe buddy
again as a meeting.
I've gotta get rules of which is
here Representative Strickler.
The state had fed force.
It's it's it's it's the the the
growing pains of the anyway so
reserve Harper and I are working
with with staff on he's to
seventy eight and to kind of
build a package around that as
well yes really good ideas in
that bill but as we know it was
it was pretty pretty expensive
you know to to start with so I
think Representative Harper
right feeding a sub was
delivered this morning and and
I'm hoping to give our analyst
and the LESC folks and TRD folks
you know the next two days to
score it as accurately as they
can and then the plan will be to
bring whatever version of that
comes out on Monday for us to
consider and
of course I still have vice
chair Chandler night we still
have our.
Our tax bill house bill two
ninety I think it is that we
will probably here on Monday and
and that's you know that that
should probably conclude most of
these committees
Business in terms of tax package
so so that's the plan for today
House Bill fifteen and to
succeed foo and then Monday the
plan is to take up a version of
two seventy eight.
Members
is there a motion to remove.
House Bill Committee substitute
for House the fifteen off the
table and I believe the receipt
another substitute that was
submitted well in advance with
some technical changes some
fixes that needed to happen is
there a motion to remove fifteen
off the table and make it the
next order of business so moved.
Okay thank you for the motion
Representative Maestas and for
the double second spy
representative Cadena and
Harper.

difference is between the
current sub in the previous one

nine point five.
Okay can everybody see that

an email.
Yes.
Okay.
Perfect walk us through it
Representative Ortez please
thank you Mr chair members of
the committee
this site has mostly technical
technical language cleanup the
attacks and Revenue Department
let us know that we didn't
change the date fan that twenty
fifteen section of this bill for
consistency so we did that we
also work with the home builders
and agreed to extend the page
issues we extend the date by
which the project it must be
completed to qualify for the
twenty fifteen credit that's on
page two it was originally
January one twenty twenty two
and now it is April first twenty
twenty two.
At the at the technical camp it
is to change the date on page
six nine nine to the same that
again is that that the date by
which the project must receive
certification to receive the
twenty fifteen credit on the
dates now on page two and six
match on the same table cleanup
was made on page thirty eight
line three which is that
corporate income tax section of
the bill.
I
thank you Representative Ortez
and just before we got a
committee this does not change
the fiscal impact that we have
on file.
It is.
Members of the committee
questions.
Okay questions.
About the date is it in order to
get a credit is that the state
that the new tax revenue
department must approve it.
The application or just the
application here is that the but
which the project has to be
completed Warren said.
The date by which one must have
applied.
For the.
Credit.
The M. Mr chair I'm I'm sorry
who I did I did not to ask that
question.
I was picking up speed.
Heard me speaker of the answer
lies in your answer or or there
will not be lunch delivered.
Receive the speaker.
two Mr chair to to you or to it
to me I don't want to me to me.
Mr chair when I was covering
lunch this this afternoon
speakers request.
That is right you're correct all
over chat you my my home address
you can send.
Excellent.
Mr chair Mr speaker as I
understand it the project must
be completed and certified by
the by that date of April first
twenty twenty second.
Thank you Mr chairman
Representative the reason I ask
is.
The tax department gets backed
up in processing applications I
wouldn't want taxpayers to lose
out on the.
Benefit from your bill because
of a backlog in the department
so we just make sure that that's
not a risk if we need to we need
to do with the affirmative.
We're certainly happy to support
your bills just one make sure
that about what is the tax
department will
jeopardize.
Experience ability to receive
the credit thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker
Representative Maestas.
Thank you Mr Chairman
representative or yes the up
some look at one of the.
Paragraphs and there's a.
I love the way you changed the
word new to two thousand fifteen
but anyway it's as a Mr Chairman
representative worked as on page
six for example land line it
will say you know honor honor
after January one two thousand
seventeen but prior to April one
twenty twenty two.
You know I see a lot of dates in
our statutes but they're usually
January one July one.
Why the April first twenty
twenty two and it does that show
up elsewhere in the in the bill.
Mr chair of Representative
Maestas but that is a very very
good question I would like to
know if my expert witness can
pop over here is that possible
absolutely and my apologies for
not allowing her in earlier let
me find your it's ms Cole corn
right well she's coming in Mr
Chairman others take a gas I
think it's essentially gives
folks a year like a year of
economic transition from when
the bill is.
We've got to be signed until it.
So it's affected on a.
Mr chair representative
management that's a that's a
really that's a great gas let's.
It sounds excellent mislabeled
well welcome good morning good
morning Sir I apologize I was
being switched over so I did not
hear the into the question from
Representative Maestas.
No thank you Mr chairman
Representative Ortez missile
corn so they there's a date
there's a date I was going to
the bill and on page six line
nine.
That's after January one two
thousand seventeen but before
April one twenty twenty two and
I'm just wondering why the one
is white why is there a date
there and then why that date.
thank you gentleman Martinez
Representative Maestas we did
have that in the original such
substitute that came to you as
January first
that home builders pointed out
that they might have some
projects that are in progress
and having then completed the so
now it's that they have to be
started by the time the new
state co target takes effect but
it might take them up to about
April first to finish that
project and so we wanted to make
sure that we were cutting anyone
off prematurely if they have a
project started we want to be
able to let them get certified
and approved under the old
credits.
Thank you madam thank you Mr
chairman thank you of sorts as
miss people should.
That's all I have.
Representative Cadena.
