Alright. OK, we have a quorum,
folks. Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, those joining us
online and those in the room,
thanks for making it up this
morning. Uh, we do have a
condensed agenda today at the
request of the sponsors, we will
be rolling House Bill 202, as
well as House Bill 275, uh, both
of those sponsors did request
that and we will bring those up,
uh, at their request. So let's
move forward now on House Bill
46 real property from
health-related equipment we have
with us.
Representative Chavez,
represented Chavez, whenever
you're ready, the floor is
yours, man.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. um,
house, uh, we have a committee
subs substitute.
Um, house Bill 46.
OK, we move the, the house
substitute for discussion, you
have those?
Puppies.
I
46.
46, they're not injured.
We will get those passed out.
Please bear with us while we get
those passed out.
Oh yeah. We, we owe her a copy
back.
You can have my copy.
Now I'll get one.
But you can pass them on. I'll
get one.
I'll give it to me.
Representative Chavez, if you
would please read the 202 number
off the bottom.
You can substitute?
Uh, Mr. Chair, the 202 number
is.
0.230606.1. Very good, that's
what we all have in front of us
right now, and please proceed
with the committee substitute.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. The
committee substitute for House
Bill 46 intends to define real
property in section 7-36-3, and
with that I'm gonna turn it over
to my expert witness and ask him
to dive deeper into.
Thank you, possessor.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee, the
committee substitute, um.
Oh
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Damian
Lara. I am the vice chair for
the uh New Mexico assessors
affiliate and I'm also on the
board of the New Mexico, uh,
counties uh board.
Um
The committee substitute um
takes into account some concerns
from the previous committee
about hospitals and clinics,
being able to seek funding for
construction of real property
and so that will continue to
happen through the health
equipment loan council, the
committee substitute here will
nonetheless make it very clear
that real property.
Um, built with those bonds and
financing would not be abated
from property taxes.
And with that I'm happy to stand
for questions.
Well, sorry.
Anything else I can substitute
representative.
No, Mr. Chair. OK.
Any discussion from the
committee real quick on the
committee substitute before we
go to the audience. OK, OK. That
being said, your substant motion
and, and, and moved, so we'll
discuss the committee
substitute. We will now go to
the audience for questions and
comments. Uh, let's begin with
those that are online, you could
please.
Any
No. Nobody online.
Those in the room.
Discussion on House Bill 40, the
committee substitute the House
Bill 46, excuse me, all those in
favor.
The committee substitute 4 all
those in opposition to House
Bill 46 to substitute to.
Please form a line.
And make public comments.
You will have the attendant hold
a mic for us.
Yes.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, Jason Weeks,
registered lobbyist from the
Mexico Hospital Association. We
do stand in opposition of this
bill. We appreciate the efforts
that we have undertaken with the
sponsor and Mr. A lotta in terms
of discussing the bill, we
currently still stand opposed,
real property, used for
charitable purposes in New
Mexico is exempt from property
tax under the Mexico State
Constitution, we do feel that
this exemption should be applied
to real property that hospitals
own. It allows us to reinvest in
other aspects of our operations.
So that we can actually do this
process also allows us to
streamline those investments so
that we can get them, uh,
implemented more quickly. Um, so
for those reasons, we stand in
opposition. Thank you.
Thank you. Next,
Good morning. My name is Kevin
Noel. I am a New Mexico CPA and
tax director for Presbyterian
Healthcare Services.
Um, we stand in opposition to
this bill.
It, um, it will serve as a
disincentive.
For future construction or
remodeling of much needed health
care facilities.
Um, it is a cost increase. I
know much of it will be borne by
the, by the state, but
A lot of it will still be borne
by our customers, and they just
Um, the substitute bill in
particular.
Abs, um, multi-million dollar um
additional tax expense to us
starting.
And and we of course worked in
previous years to obtain as they
were, and I don't think it's
equitable now after we've
budgeted and planned for for
this expense. Finally, I would
just note that I think that this
bill is inequitable.
It strikes 7:363-C, relating to
hospital equipment loan bonds,
but it, but it leaves, um,
Industrial revenue bonds alone,
so our for-profit enterprises in
the state.
Still gain much we are now
losing.
This passes.
Thank you for your comments,
sir. Appreciate you being here.
Next.
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, my name is Tom
Harran.
I'm here as not as a lobby I
was, my son was supposed to be
home in bed or watching his wife
was ill, but he's here.
I'm here primarily I was uh
Remember of the legislature like
50 years ago and a lobbyist for
40 some
And up
We passed this bill, Dan Weeks.
I, I the 80s or 90s.
And what it did was we just.
Removed the bill from
But, uh, county commission, the
hospital equipment alone was
going to be easier to get stuff
through and not quite as.
Voluminous because each, each
effort we had made before the
counties.
They had approved them without
question.
Because it's in the
I think it's
Article 8, Section 3 that bonds
issued by
Uh, health care, uh, I mean, not
a charitable organizations.
is not only is permitted but
shall be granted.
Uh, that's Article
8 section some uh legal issues
in this bill with
Effective dates and
retroactivity, etc. that.
ought to be examined, um.
Several of the County San Juan
County.
In Albuquerque Presbyterian of
issued bonds through the
charitable loan.
I mean, uh, equipment loan
committee.
And we just did that for ease of
operation and change our.
Uh, charitable, uh.
Make up in any way no.
Impair or have any uh impact.
Uh, my understanding is from.
Mr. Know is the the Berlio
counties and others have have
supported these.
So I think what we're doing is
we're using a statute to impair.
A constitutional.
Right.
I don't think that's correct,
um.
And I think it ought to be
looked at. Secondly,
All the bondholders, I know that
San Juan County and uh
Presbyterian issued bonds years
ago.
But the understand they would be
tax exempt, so somebody who
would buy the bonds.
But take them in a lesser rate
than they would get from a
taxable bond.
Because it would have in Mexico
exemption on it.
So that's either gonna have to
be made up.
It could be litigation over that
as to the underwriters or the
issuers of the bond or
Or there could be a legislation
brought by several, several
different ways. I think you need
to look at that.
And um
This, I don't think there's ever
been a question that these.
Uh, use of these facilities.
was a hospitals, etc. should be
anything but tax exempt.
So just
If you could look at it, I
appreciate it.
And, and I had a little trouble
reading the bill. I think there
are some.
drafting ways.
I couldn't find where it was on
new material searching through
that a little bit, but I so I
appreciate your.
consideration. This
And if I, if there's a mistake,
it was mine and Dan Weeks.
Jason's dad long ago, not
theirs, and or my son.
Thank you. Anyone else?
If not to the committee,
Representative Lunon.
Mr. Chairman, thank you, Mr.
Chairman and thank you
Representative.
So I can get my uh arms around
this bill. I understand it
correctly.
property bonds
no longer be tax exempt under
the hospital equipment loan act
for nonprofit hospitals.
Mr. Chair, uh, Representative
Estrom, no, not quite correct.
So the.
Bill will clarify.
That
Simply financing.
Real property construction.
Though the issuance of bonds,
through the health.
Doesn't automatically give you a
property tax abatement.
Mr. Chairman, explain to me how
refinancing would work.
Particularly let's take Hobu
McKinley Christian Hospital,
small rural hospital hanging on
by its fingernails, so to speak,
to stay open. I know in the last
couple of years, this
legislatures work very hard to
help hospitals. Explain to me,
since that's a nonprofit, how
refinancing would work.
For a dialysis unit, they're
they're trying to repair. So for
a dialysis unit, this bill would
not affect it at all. This, this
bill only deals with real
property.
Correct.
So that's
For a dialysis unit, they're
they're trying to repair. So for
a dialysis unit, this bill would
not affect it at all. This, this
bill only deals with real
property.
Correct. So,
OK, so the the the facility
would still be be able to be
refinanced. They can still go
before the council. They can get
refinancing. They can remodel,
they can reconstruct, they can
do all of those things on that
bond.
So it would depend.
If the use of the hospital is a
charitable use, then because it
is a non-governmental exemption,
they would need to file an
exemption like any other.
Uh, charitable organization that
provides a substantial public
benefit.
Or the statute, the Constitution
and Sisters of Charity, um,
Supreme Court decisions if
they're providing a substantial
public benefit in McKenna
County, then they would receive
that exemption off of their
property tax for the buildings
that are being used to provide
those services. Mr. Chairman,
with there already be a listing
of those hospitals, um, in the
state of New Mexico currently
that you would immediately
identify for charitable use,
aren't they?
all that way. Most of them
aren't so, Mr. Chair, uh.
Representative Lundstrom, so
let, let's take the example in
San Juan, um, that the comments
were being brought up, OK San
Juan Regional right now the main
hospital.
is owned by the county. So that
is automatically exempt because
the county owns the building.
They, um, parking lots,
administrative business, uh,
offices and all of those things.
They have 33 accounts.
They are have been currently and
in past years been assessed at.
15.3 million. They have 13
vacant lots that have been
assessed at 6.
$165,000 and they've paid
property taxes on that for many,
many years.
Um
And, and as well as for uh
personal accounts that they
have.
PBS
Um, which also has a hospital
downtown is partially exempt
because they're providing a
substantial public benefit, not
based on the health financing,
but on the actual services that
are being provided in San Juan,
the county assessor in San Juan
County has provided them with a
charitable exemption pursuant to
the Constitution based on their
um.
Services that are provided in
that in that in that county by
that hospital. So similarly, all
of those um charitable uses that
you're talking about in all 33
counties would continue to
receive charitable use.
Uh, exemptions based on Article
3 section, I'm sorry, yeah,
section 8 of the Constitution
for charitable uses, but they
would not receive an automatic
exemption simply because.
The financed um through the
issuance of bonds.
Um, similarly, um, the
industrial revenue bonds that
were mentioned that are in here
uh as as you.
are probably more familiar than
most. Lida, as well as other
acts require that those
companies put the real property
in the name of the authorizing
entity, whether that's the
county or the uh.
Municipality in exchange for
doing certain things, paying
gross receipts, hiring a certain
amount of employees at a certain
rate, all of those things are
seen as an exchange for
providing those services and for
why they would receive an
abatement. That's all we're
trying to clear up here that a
hospital, a clinic or any other
qualifying facility actually has
to provide a public substantial
benefit or services before they
automatically receive that uh
property tax.
Mr. Chairman, it's not clear to
me that that's what it's doing.
I mean, it seems like it's much
more convoluted in when when I'm
reading the and actually came in
15 minutes early so I could read
this, so I had some grip on what
we were talking about.
So, um,
Just curious, Mr. Chairman, Mr.
Laura.
Is this a position of the New
Mexico assessors, I mean, do
they support this bill?
Um, Mr. Chair Representative
Lustrom, this was voted by the
assessor's affiliate, I believe
29 in in favor of this bill. It
was also taken before the New
Mexico, uh, board of of.
Directors
Um, Joey Sparsa and uh New
Mexico County's board has voted
to endorse this bill as well, so
yes, it is both the affiliate
chair. I'm sorry assessors
affiliate, uh, endorsed bill as
well as a New Mexico counties's
endorsed bill.
OK
Mr. Chairman, I haven't heard
peep out of my assessor on this
bill.
Um, but I assume that you're
representing all of them, it'd
be good if they text me and tell
me they think this is a good
deal.
Uh, particularly in light of the
situation that our hospital, I
don't know, Mr. Chairman, I need
to keep a
closer eye on some of this,
especially as the um.
Looking at the bill analysis
regarding the potential
constitutional conflicts, so
turned to my lawyer friend
sitting next to my right to help
me understand that, but I, I am
a little concerned about that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Representative. Let's
go to that lawyer friend of
yours, Speaker Martinez.
Thank you Mr. Chair
Representative, Mr. Assessor,
uh.
What is the problem we're trying
to fix here?
So, um,
Currently in in a couple of
counties, uh.
Hospitals like Presbyterian have
refused to provide information
about the type of services that
their hospitals are providing.
Um, to receive a charitable
exemption, um, and relies
exclusively on health, um, to
say that the health includes
real property that they've
bonded in Bernalillo and
particularly for example a $30
million parking garage, let's
say that is automatically exempt
because they used a portion of
their health bond issuances to
build that parking garage.
Um
Santa Fe County is similar, um,
and so we're simply trying to
say.
That
If you build real property.
With
Bonds
That you're not automatically
exempt.
You actually have to apply for a
charitable use.
Exemption, if you want to be
exempt based on the substantial
public benefit that you're being
provided. The equipment, um, the
legislature can um through
statute exempt.
Dialysis machines, CAT scans,
MRI machines, all of those
things. So, so simply we're
saying that it is the personal
property.
That is not real property that
is purchased acquired, financed,
refinanced, um, all of those
things will be abated from
taxes, just not the real
property.
The same way that San Juan
Regional currently pays for
their parking garages for their
administrative business.
That's all we're trying to do is
is trying to make sure that
Everybody is treated fairly and
equitably throughout the state,
whether you're
In San Juan is San Juan Regional
or whether you're Presbyterian
and Burtino County. So Mr.
Chair, is this sounds like this
is focused on Presbyterian. It
seems like it's focused on one
entity,
there's a couple of other um.
Large
Hospital corporations, um, that
feel that they don't have to pay
real property taxes simply
because they've financed the
construction of their real
property assets through uh the
health bonding issues
understood.
Mr. Chair, I've, I've got, I've
got some concerns, and here's
why, um, just looking at the
fiscal impact, the, the, the
positive impact is minimal.
From, from what I can tell.
So it's not like we're leaving
30 million a year on the table.
Mr. Chair, Representative, Mr.
Assessor.
Um
And I'm particularly concerned
at a time when healthcare is so.
You know,
Obvious as an issue.
Uh, you know, we're talking
about a lot of other good
reforms including staffing and
other things that I think people
are, are really interested in.
And this seems like we're
You know, we're, we're, we're
hitting a
I don't know, a pinata with a
baseball bat instead of a
broomstick, you know, I, I, I
get what you're trying to do. I
don't, I, I just don't
understand.
fully understand
But the real problem is, um, and
again, if we're looking at, I
mean this fiscal impact is
minimal. I I just.
We're not leaving 30 million on
the table that we can reinvest
in Medicaid, um.
And I'm just not sure, um, and
maybe it's me, maybe I just
don't fully understand or grasp
what you're trying to do here.
Um, but I do have
Some concerns, let me, let me
ask you, uh,
I'm gonna turn to my other
lawyer friend over there, uh Mr.
Mr. Chair, um.
In our analysis, there's a
possible constitutional conflict
that's raised.
And I don't know if you have
this in front of you.
Um,
But it's it's like a retirement
residences versus Martinez 2017.
Um
Do you, can you speak to that
potential conflict?
Mr. Chair, uh, Representative
Speaker Martinez, um, so.
The, the constitutional
exemption.
Uh, in the section that was.
Pre spot is for charitable use.
There is no constitutional
exemption.
For
Um
Bond issuance
So the conflict here is actually
that the legislature.
should not be able to and, and
cannot.
Unilaterally exempt real
property.
Of a hospital simply because it
is a hospital.
It has to rely on the actual use
of the property.
So
If, if a hospital hasn't
submitted a non-governmental
exemption form saying we are
providing a substantial public
benefit.
Then they cannot just be in the
same category as a county or as
a municipality or the state of
New Mexico where the real
property is automatically
exempt.
So the conflict actually arises
from a statute that that reports
or that a property owner
believes and exempt them
automatically without having to
file a non um governmental
exemption application with the
county assessor's office. So I
would argue that the the
conflict is in the statute
currently.
With the Constitution, not the
other way around. Got it.
Um, let, let me, let me dig a
little deeper then, uh, Mr.
Chair and Representative and Mr.
Assessor.
Um
Wouldn't it be safe to say that?
Every hospital
In New Mexico provides.
Charitable service has a
charitable mission.
I could not make that
assumption. I think that would
be an assumption. I think many
of them do.
But not all of them. Um, and
certainly.
I, I, you know, would defer.
Um, to each county assessor to
evaluate whether or not.
A $30 million parking garage is
providing a substantial public
benefit.
Um, or whether or not like the
county assessor in San Juan.
Um, thinks that the parking lots
of San Juan Regional who have
paid property taxes for many
years should continue to pay
property taxes or not, um, so
that, that's, that's the
question, um, if.
There are documentations that
they're provided to say that
that is providing a substantial
public benefit.
Um, and they meet that burden,
then.
Those hospitals would receive
and can currently apply for and
receive exemptions like many
hospitals have throughout the
state of New Mexico. That's
really all that this bill is
trying to do is if the hospital
a
Clinic or community facility
believes that they are
providing, as you mentioned, Mr.
Speaker, a charitable use, all
they have to do is submit the
application and provide that
information, um, if the county
assessor disagrees with them,
then they're always welcome to
file a protest with the with
their county's protest board.
And then an independent
quasi-judicial body would review
that information and decide
whether or not in fact the
facility that the real property
is being used as a charitable
use and then the protest board
would grant them the charitable
exemption. Understood, Mister
Chair Representative Mr.
Assessor.
Um, is, is this uh?
So what I'm hearing you say is
if, if a hospital is building a
park under your bill.
They can still apply.
For the, for the
To be treated as tax exempt.
But in the process of applying
now they've got to prove that in
fact that's the case versus it
being automatic.
Which is the current law.
Mr. Chair, Speaker Martinez,
that is correct, yes sir.
Um, is this, is, is, does this
legislation come from colleagues
questions here, does it, is it
something that the assessors
just want to clean up and
clarify, is, is that where this
is?
Coming from
Mr. Chair, uh, Speaker Martinez,
that, that is correct we we.
do see this more as cleanup
language. Again, we are not.
Removing any of the financing
that.
Any hospital or clinic would
need to actually have the the
money to build.
Um, they would still be able to
purchase and finance any type of
equipment, personal property
that would automatically be
exempt.
Um, but if they want to exempt
the real property, then they
simply need to file a charitable
use application, um again, PMS
in San Juan has already done
that. The assessor has already
granted it to them. It's just
clarifying going forward has
been indicated here that.
Um
Large hospitals that have relied
on the statute to say that it's
automatic would actually need to
demonstrate that there is a a a
public I'm sorry, a substantial
public benefit to the county
because
Uh, you know,
The the federal government
doesn't provide this money the
state um doesn't provide this
money, the money for these
exemptions comes from the
neighbors, the small business
owners that are in and around
the county they have to make up
the.
Yield control and the taxes that
the counties, municipalities,
the hospital districts which if
they really need that, they have
the authority to issue um a
hospital district and pose those
um school districts, all of
those things end up having to
pay up the burden, and if it's a
true public benefit and they
should be automatically or or
through the application, the
exempt, but if not,
Then they, they can protest that
if they if they disagree with
their county assessor.
Mr. Chair, not to believe the
point, but
Um, you know, I was in a meeting
last night, um.
on housing, right?
The big problem is his
permitting local governments
take forever.
Um, how convoluted
Is the application.
Um
To, to be treated as tax exempt
and how.
Chair of Speaker Martinez, our
application is 3 pages long.
Most of it is fill in the blank,
um, there is a short narrative
section where we ask the um
The the the property owner to
say what is their substantial
public benefit that they're
being provided, that can be as
long or as short as the property
owner wants to do that, then we
have a list of Chekhov that they
should provide, including a 990,
most of these are.
Uh, nonprofits at the federal
government um they provide their
articles of incorporation they
provide either a mission
statement or something like
that, and then uh whatever they
believe is what they have, so.
Uh, in, in the.
Let let's take um first choice
community centers is one that
that comes to mind, right? They,
they provide free services or uh
low and moderate income on a
sliding scale. They provide that
they show that their finances
come my majority from grants and
Medicaid, Medicare, uh, and that
None of their CEOs are making
more than 3 digits, you know,
like less than $100,000 and that
they are filling a, a well
established need. The
application was maybe 10 pages
long for Bernalillo County, and
they received an exemption or
providing that substantial
public benefit of healthcare to
a particular population that is
unable to pay for that.
Um, UNMH automatically exempt
because they're the state's
indigent hospital.
Um, and they're owned by the
regions of New Mexico, so some
of those are already taken and
we, we try to make it as.
Unburdensome as possible. Chair.
Um, and I think that again begs
the question, like, you know, I
think of Presbyterian in in my
community.
Um, a lot of people go there
too, right? And, and they do
have
Uh, some pretty robust.
Financial
Support programs for
Uninsured or underinsured
people.
Um
And I, I get what you're doing.
I mean, you, you're basically
just saying, OK, if you guys are
gonna build a parking garage or
another wing to your building.
Just come and submit the
application.
And it seems to me that more
than likely.
Um
Those applications would
probably be approved. I mean, I,
I
I'm a little concerned with what
you just stated about like the
CEO pay, like, trust me, I'm not
one to excuse CEOs making a
killing.
Uh, but I hope that that
wouldn't be the automatic cutoff
because.
That compared to like Casa de
Salud or or first choice.
Yeah, you're right. I mean, the
the first choice directors, not
making a whole lot of money
compared to the.
You know, CEO of Loveless.
Um
But it seems to me that
That process really, you know,
hopefully it's.
As transparent as could be,
right? Um.
And Mr. Chair Speaker Martinez,
um.
I, I, I guess I would be remiss
to say.
That the Presbyterian currently
does have for their main
hospital in Bernalillo County.
They do have a charitable
exemption based on the things
that you've just mentioned.
OK, uh, Mr. Chair, we might
wanna
One of the audience on this one,
because the
You say you do not, you, you can
just walk up here.
State your name again for the
record and, and, and don't,
don't speak out from the
audience in regards to this
conversation going on here.
Give us a second to get the
microphone to you.
Presbyterian, um,
Hospital does have an exemption
currently under the hospital
Equipment Loan Act.
For bonds that we issued in
remodeling and building the
facility over the years.
We do not have a charitable
exemption.
I don't think
Anywhere in Borneo County that
I'm aware of.
Um, we have applied, we have
been um denied on every case.
We recently built a large
hospital in Santa Fe County.
We applied for the GELA
exemption, the charitable
exemption.
We were denied on both of those.
And, and we are appealing for
decision.
On that. So
We're not seeing
Um, we, we are going through the
charitable application process.
We're just, we're not being
recognized as charitable.
Is a charitable, the Attorney
General recognizes us as
charitable.
But in my history of 20 years of
Presbyterian.
Burn.
OK.
This is getting muddier by the
minute, so you just said you
applied, but Mr. Chair, but
didn't get the exemptions.
I thought you automatically got
the exemptions and these folks
are trying to get you to apply,
Mister Chair. We, we um
Automatically get the HeLA
exemptions or we are supposed
to.
Um, but Santa Fe County, um.
actually denied our application
for that HELA exemption.
We protested
Um, we're waiting for protests
on the parking garage in
question.
In Bernalillo County.
We applied for the hospital
criminal loan exemption could be
built the garage with it was
denied, we went to the protest
board.
Presbyterian one at the protest
board.
The assessor's office then
appealed our protest board
victory.
So Mr. Chair and thank you,
thank you for that. I'll go back
to the assessor, Mr. Chair, is,
is, uh,
Sounds like counties are already
based on what we just heard.
Denying these exemptions, so.
Is what was just described.
You're seeking to do with this
bill.
Mr. Chair, uh, Speaker Martinez,
so I was not aware that the
hospital.
Building itself was being exempt
because it was under GILA.
Or a health, um, I'll have to
take a look at that.
The parking garage, he did
summarize correctly to, to the
best of my knowledge, um, they
did ask that it was that it
should be automatically exempt
through health.
And we did deny that. I did deny
that they did protest it. We are
in district court, um.
It's to my knowledge, I don't
know about Santa Fe County. I
believe Santa Fe Countysessor is
here and he can speak to what's
going on in Santa Fe County, but
We did not remove the
Exemption
From the hospital, I did remove
the exemption from the parking
garage, and that is in district
court understood, Mr. Chair. So
Am I the only one confused you
guys confused too? OK, I, I
don't, I, I never do this, so I
apologize, um.
It seems like you already have
the power to do with.
This would do.
And
If you're in court now, is it
because?
Well, let me just start with the
first part.
You are already denied it in
that case, Mr. Chair. So why do
you need House Bill 46?
I think it's just to clarify.
What
County assessors believe is the
the constitutional and the
application of the statute Mr.
Chair, Mrs, don't we have the
same problem? So let's say this
bill passes and, and these folks
go and apply and you deny it
because it's a parking garage,
for example, they can still
protest, and they can still go
to court because they cannot
argue that they are a charitable
operation.
So they, they can um as the
gentleman indicated it is the
lack of submitting that
application and saying that it
should be automatic, that is
what we're trying to clarify.
And and that is a policy
decision for the legislature. If
you want them to have an
automatic.
Um
Property tax, real property tax
exemption simply because they
paid for that construction with
bonds.
Rather than submitting an
application, then you're right,
we don't need to do anything
else, but if you want them to
submit an application and not
have an argument to say that
simply because they.
Wild and paid for, uh, bonds.
Then we would want to clean that
distinction up, so it's, it's
that one distinction.
Whether they feel that.
They shouldn't have to file an
exemption, or file an exemption
application.
Or whether they should.
If you want them to file a
charitable application and this
is what we're trying to do with
this bill. If you don't, then
you don't, you're right, then
you don't want to pass the bill.
But, but Mr. Chair, Mr.
Assessor, what we just heard now
was that these folks submitted
the application. I'm assuming
they assumed it was automatic.
They went to you and you said
this is not automatic, this is a
parking garage, it doesn't, it
doesn't qualify.
For the exemption and then you
said.
You don't get it and then they
appeal, right? so.
The status quo seems to me.
It's not automatic.
You still can deny it.
They might feel like it should
be automatic.
But you, the duly elected asssor
of our county and deny it.
And then they go through an
appeals process, which is the
same process that would exist
under.
OK.
That is correct, Mr. Chair.
Clear, clear as mud. Thank you.
I appreciate it. This is
helpful. I didn't sleep very
well last night. foggy.
There's no reason to apologize
and, and for the committee. I
mean, feel free to take up as
much time as you need to to
clarify the question that you
might have, so we will continue
this dialogue with the next on
our list is Representative
Chandler.
I'll be very brief, um, Mr.
Chair, I think, um, the Speaker.
Questioning illuminated us. It
strikes me as a bill that's
really not necessary.
So I would prefer to chair
around.
And I'm, I'm a little
disappointed that we're making
hospitals, um.
to justify.
These kinds of things. You're
not my assessor, so you don't,
you don't react to me, but your
voters may kind of um hoops that
these poor folks are being
pushed, put through, you know,
cost of healthcare and.
All those sorts of things, so um
I'm not going to support this
bill.
Thank you, Representative. Let's
go to Representative Silva.
Um, my questions were more than
answered. Thank you, sir.
OK, very good. Let's go to
represent Razas.
I think I've, I've been, this is
all.
Because
Are we afraid to ask questions.
To do it oh no I'm not afraid. I
think it was just it was
clarified really, really well.
OK, we'll go to Roman Cadena and
then and then to.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
appreciated the debate we've had
so far. I just had two
clarifying questions on this
idea that you're.
Reviewing and determining or
making a decision on somebody's
terrible purpose, like what
metrics and standards are you
using for that? And they are,
and are they consistent across
county to county.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair Representative Cadena,
uh, we do so the the baseline
currently is Sisters of Charity,
which is also a very similar
case um where a rule uh county
had a um
Long term health care facility
that normally isn't um la
vidalena is another case that
sort of clarifies that in in
Bernalo County and so while
there is flexibility, so for
example, um an unmet need in a
rural county may qualify for a
substantial public benefit, but
perhaps in an area where.
You have as Mr. Speaker
indicated.
Other, um, avenues like an
indigent hospital, um, a, uh,
first choice in other places,
um, where there is not a target
population that is being met,
um, then maybe you don't, but.
Aside from those flexibilities
that each um county assessor has
to evaluate in their population.
there is the the specific um
Factors that are provided in
those cases is about, you know,
what is the use of the property,
how is that being used and how
is that providing that
substantial public benefit to,
to the entire community, um, and
those are the criteria that we
use to evaluate um how much, um,
you know, the, the example that
they gave was, you know, it is a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich
sufficient.
And they say, you know, probably
not, and you have to evaluate on
a spectrum, how much is being
provided. The, the law also
provides that as in the case of
PMS that the county assessor can
provide a partial exemption
saying maybe not the entire
facility is used specifically
for charitable use and maybe for
profit use, but if we can divide
that up, then they receive a
partial exemption and so it does
allow that flexibility, um, but
all of that is predicated on, on
a
on an application and supporting
documentation to actually verify
um the use of the property.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, but just
to clarify so.
tax-related purposes, we
understand the consistency in
the IRS tax standards, we
understand what comes out of the
New Mexico Attorney General
around different tax purposes or
nonprofit status. But what
you're saying here is based on.
This
case, the Sisters of Charity
case that you all are on an
individual basis deciding
whether the argument for for
public benefit has merit and to
what percentage it has merit.
Mr. She, uh, representative,
that is correct,
So, I have one more question. So
in one response, you said.
Something about the true public
benefit, can you provide
examples of what would not be a
true public benefit or when
you're reviewing these
applications.
What are some of the examples of
what are not a true public
benefit for you. So it's a
substantial public benefit is
the language that is
misrepresentative is the
language that they use in in the
case laws that we look at.
So, so that's why I'm asking.
Thank you,
thank you for uh for clarifying
that. So we want to make sure
that it's.
That
What that is is actually being
applied and so for example, um.
Let's um
We look at um one distinction,
let's say for example, goodwill.
And thrifters or sabers.
Um
Mr. Chair, for the purposes,
could we keep it a hospital
example. I'd I'd like to keep in
this realm of conversation and
debate we're having,
what are hospitals doing out
there today that is not a true
public benefit that you're
concerned with,
so hospitals that um would not
um take indigent.
People, for example, people uh
who are being turned away
because they're unable to pay,
um, hospitals that are.
Providing a fee for service, so
you come in and you provide a
service for fee and then you use
those profits to.
Uh, to give to your
shareholders.
Um, those would be examples of
a, a hospital that would not be
providing a substantial public
benefit because all that is
being done is providing a
service for a fee, then
Trying to make a profit and that
profit goes to the shareholders
rather than being put back into
the community. That would be an
example of a hospital that would
not receive a charitable. Thank
you, Mr. Chair. I, I also am
having some hesitation, I think
like Speaker Martinez on some of
the ways that we're wrapping in
these business models of yes,
these corporate hospitals, but
they are also in our communities
every day, providing access to
healthcare that our communities
need and deserve. So I'm getting
a little nervous that
We're having a much bigger
conversation about what it means
to be corporate healthcare, um,
when we're actually talking
about individual assessors
having the authority that you
already have today to make
individualized decisions upon a
thorough review of what that
hospital is doing in your
community. So, like others, I, I
have some hesitation around
whether or not this bill is
needed, um.
And some anxiety about what it
means that we're making unique
decisions based on whatever
assessor you're in front of and,
and whether or not they, they
have the capacity to
Consistently evaluate whether a
hospital is providing a public
benefit or not. So I also.
with those concerns. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you, Vice
Chairman. Let's go to
Representative Montoya.
Uh, thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman,
uh, Representative and uh Mr.
Latta, um.
I
I'm just, uh, from the
standpoint.
Of the conversation. I've been
listening to it, it appears as
if
distinction that that we're
hearing is
In particular, parking
facilities.
that health care
is not taking place necessarily
in the parking facility.
That I
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
It seems like we're talking,
we're separating.
I heard parking lot or parking
structure a couple of times.
I'm not sure how any of our
hospitals would exist without
parking lots.
So I, I don't know how you
separate that from.
I mean, if I have a business and
I don't have parking in front of
my business, I'm not going to
have a very successful business.
So I, I'm not exactly sure how
we're.
It seems to me that the
discussion is around the
substantial public benefit.
If it's not
If I'm missing this and you're
not separating.
Parking structures and isolating
that as as the discussion point.
Please let me know where I'm
missing the point. That's,
that's what I'm hearing.
chair of
Uh, Representative Montoya that.
I think it's because I used that
as an example, um, but no, that,
that.
You know, if it's necessary if
this is, you know, patient and
it's providing something, yeah,
then it would.
Theoretically, um, be included
uh as any other.
Use of a of a facility that
requires um.
Parking and, and, and access to
it. I mean, if, if you don't
have resi res, you're absolutely
right. The the business would
would go under people wouldn't
be able to get it. I was just
using it as an example because.
From at least my perspective,
and again, I, I don't believe
that that's the example in Santa
Fe County and, and uh as
accessor American speak to to
that here uh as well as other
county assessors in their
particular cases, it is that.
And, and again, um, if I, I'll
I'll review, I believed that the
hospital um in Bernalillo
County, the building itself was
receiving a charitable
exemption, but if they're
receiving a health exemption,
then I may have to go back and
review that, um.
To make sure that that is so all
we're trying to, all I'm trying
to do in my county is to verify.
That that the.
property owner is in fact
providing a substantial public
benefit to the residents of the
county.
And this bill I believe will
help do that. So, Mr. Chair,
and, and
Representative of Mr. Lara.
Um
San Juan County was brought up a
couple of times. I know we've
had some discussions, I think
myself and Representative Duncan
have talked to our assessor.
Um, it's not a non-issue in San
Juan County because we are a
We're, we're a, a, a community
hospital.
But we have a very unique
situation there, which is
The land that the hospital is on
is donated by the county, not
exactly a straight donation.
They pay $1 a year.
to collect anything on, so I
think
Parking there and the other,
other land they have.
I think it's just never been
discussed because we're already
being overly generous.
In San Juan County, providing, I
don't think any of these other
hospitals.
Are getting land for free.
For $1 rent a year. So I, I, I.
I'd like to take Salon County
kind of out of the discussion
because I, I don't
We're talking apples and
oranges, but even with that,
even with that exemption.
Our hospitals holding on by a
thread.
I think that's the case with
hospitals across the state in
particular.
In rural parts of the state.
This really appears to be a
Santa Fe, Albuquerque.
Problem.
And I'm afraid we do something
here. I don't know what the
unintended consequences would
be.
For instances and representative
Henry's district where they're
looking to build.
I don't, I'm not sure if that
doesn't shut this project down
if there's
Not some sort of guarantee that
they're, you know, they'll have
to add that into their potential
cost, potentially.
So
Um, I, I'm very nervous about
this, but I think the the
biggest thing I'm nervous about,
and I'm just kind of unwilling
to jump in the middle of it.
I, I don't like it when
Litigation is going on.
And then legislation is brought
forward in the middle of that,
that could tilt the litigation
one way or the other. I think
that makes us unfair arbiters on
this side.
Um, I, I would be much more
inclined to hear this.
And, and vote for something like
this, if you weren't in
litigation.
But I think if you're in
litigation, I think that I think
that's unfair for, for
this body to step in.
And, and put our thumbs on the
scale.
And so I, I can't support this
for that, for that one reason.
I, I'm uncomfortable with
getting in, in, in the way of
what is going through the legal
process right now. So thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative Moto. Let's go to
Representative ranking member
Duncan.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I'm, I'll be a little bit like a
few other folks on this. I'm,
this is about as clear as mud to
me.
When uh when, when I, uh,
When I get a little nervous is
when government.
Walks up to I'm here to help.
This is what this bill sounds a
little.
So let me, let me ask you a
question, Mr. Chair.
Let's say our kids play on the
same.
different
My kid just beats that that ear.
Yes
And it's so bad, 50.
And there's some more, you sit
on the board.
Barely hanging on.
Thank you, Representative
Duncan. No one else on our list.
Anyone else, other questions or
comments?
If not, what's the pleasure of
this committee?
Do not pass or
OK. Motion for a do not motion
for a do not pass by
Representative Montoya.
I think you probably just wanna,
I think the motion if.
That's what you want to do, you
probably want a table.
Instead of a
Motion to table by
Representative Montoy is their
2nd.
Representative Hernandez seconds
that. Let's take the role in
that, please.
then it
Presentative Chandler, yes.
Representative Duncan.
Representative Gallegos.
Representative Henry.
Yes
Representative Hernandez.
Representative, Representative
Martinez.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Parajon.
Yes.
Representative Silva, yes.
Representative Tarazas.
Vice chair Kadena.
Mr. Chair.
Yeah, your bill has been tabled.
Thank you for the
presentationessor and
representative.
Thank you for coming out.
OK.
Yeah.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, we're
ready for House Bill 198. Thank
you.
I'm a little bit nervous now to
see that.
This is the continuation
of our discussion of last week,
Madam Chairwoman and committee
members. This is House Bill 198,
which continues the work on
behalf of the taxation and
revenue Department and cleaning
up uh what happens every 60 day
session, uh, and, and this House
Bill 198 contains section of the
of the tax code to clean up.
That are related to penalties
and remedies such as they are
typically referred to in the
judiciary committees.
To highlight a few themes of
House Bill 198, the bill will
one just several penalties
contained in the tax code for
inflation that has occurred over
several decades.
The second one is elevate
unlawful disclosure of
confidential tax information
from misdemeanor to felony to
match what is now in the federal
code.
Tax revenue compile these
changes over the 2024 interim uh
time frame by reviewing the
entirety of chapter 7, the tax
code.
were presented to the interim
revenue stabilization and Tax
Policy Committee back in October
of 2024, uh, thereafter the
department now appreciates the
committee's consideration of
these changes that will help to
ensure penalties in the tax code
are relevant to today's dollars
and fair to both taxpayers and
to the state.
Department and LFC FIRs contain
a section by section summary of
changes to assist the members in
reviewing this bill. And with
that, I would like to introduce
my experts today. We have
Secretary Sergeant Clark from
the Tax and Revenue Committee or
department, excuse me and uh and
a friend.
That
Good morning, members of the
committee. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Thank you, Vice Chair.
Uh, also with me is a friend,
but also the deputy secretary
for administration, Aishamora,
and so, um, usually Mark Chaikin
is here with me, um, but.
been with the department for 19
years, has worked everywhere
from IT and data warehouse, uh,
up to the audit and compliance
secretary. So when we talk more
about and the disclosure
obligations taxpayer
confidentiality. Is a great
resource to have before you.
Thank you.
Thank you Madam Chair. With that
we stand for questions.
Thank you, will go to the
audience on Zoom first. Please
raise your hand if you'd like to
speak in support or opposition
to.
HB 198 saying no hands on Zoom,
we'll go to the room.
Please line up if you're
interested in speaking and
supporter opposition to HB 198.
Um, any other comments before we
go to committee, Mr. Chair? No,
madam.
Committee questions.
Representative Lindstrom.
Thank, thank you, Mr. uh, Madam
Chair, I'm looking at the House
committee analysis report and
thank you very much, uh, Mr.
Chairman for having all this
broken down so we can easily
understand what's happening
here.
Um, my, my question though is
for the tax secretary, what are
your current collections look
like?
What percentage are you
collecting?
a representative Lindstrom, are
you asking a collections in
terms of assessments. I just
want to be very specific about
that madam chair, what I'm
talking about in general tax
department has a major role in
collecting taxes, whether it's
personal income tax, whatever it
is.
And I know a couple of years ago
we tried to provide funding into
this department, so it would be
smoother.
And be able to um.
what's due to the state, so I'm,
I'm curious, Madam Chair, what's
happening?
Chairman, kind, great question.
We recently implemented a fast
collection services using the
C2, I believe that's what you're
referring to, and we are over
our percentage of clear.
OK. So, Madam Chair, you have
collected 190 million, and you
remind me what what that.
Gap was at one time, I know it
was Chairman Representative
Lindstrom, um, yes, the, I
believe you're referring to the
gap that LFC $1.2 billion at way
higher than we anticipated. I
can provide the detailed
information. Yeah, Madam Chair,
I think it's appropriate
because.
If we're missing and $2 billion
in tax revenue.
And now we're looking at
increasing for certain
penalties.
Are we gonna be able to collect
it? I mean, it doesn't matter
what the level is if we can't
collect it, so I'm just curious.
Senator Lindstrom and Madam
Chair, Vice Vice Chair, um, kind
of the
6 or so you're back to realizing
that the.
through C2 requests, the
department got much more mature.
So what was happening is the
department became able to assess
unpaid tax, much more effective
on those assessments. But now
we've kind of concluded that
project with the collection, um,
analytics project that elections
are way up, um.
And the tax gap general, um, but
we do know that the assessments
we have on the book firm now to,
I also wanna say though that
taxpayers are allowed um certain
tools to example, every
assessment that
My question then, uh, Madam
Chair, when we're talking about.
Um, all of these new penalties
were not that they're slightly
negative, at least from this
chart I'm looking at, Madam
Chair, maybe.
It's the House committee.
Anyway, it's just a slightly
negative, so I wasn't sure what
we were increasing there.
My final question, uh, Madam
Chair.
Do you have a, a sense, uh,
Madam Secretary, what our tax
gap.
Madam Vice Chair and
Representative, we do have
information we can provide on
that and, and actually we were
just going through that um for
purposes of different
legislation, um, it depends on
the tax program and so GRT and
personal income tax are the main
taxes we collect that have a
significant tax gap, we do feel
really good about our ability to
um an income tax, we also have
very good data where we share um
a lot of accounts receivable
balance, the assessment, other
highly um.
Visible tax gaps, you know,
where we really have good data,
uh, would be things like the
cannabis tax, the healthcare
quality, highly compliant.
the only reason I raise it is.
This is the revenue that is used
in projected standard.
So if we don't really have it.
If it's not real,
In other words,
And we're not sure exactly how
much we're gonna be collecting,
we're spending against that
amount.
I think you're saying, Madam
Chair and Representative
Lordstrom, I would say that the,
the amount of collection of
immaterial to anyone revenue we
might want to look at the
grocery receipts piece though.
Because that is the largest
portion.
And I'd like to know what that
tax gap is.
Thank you.
miniature, um.
Mr. Chairman, um, just one quick
question for you.
Um, on this, the increased fines
for various criminal acts are
not consistent with
Uh
Perhaps the law in Section 10,
page 18, the fine for assault
battery on a department
employee, which is a petty
misdemeanor, is increased to
5000.
Under the criminal sentencing
laws that maximum penalty for a
petty misdemeanor is only 500 or
are we gonna
Fix that.
Um
Madam Vice Chair and
Representative Duncan, thanks
for that question. Um,
Well, in our, uh, proposed
changes to penalties and and an
approach of sort of looking at
when the current amount was set
in statute and then roughly
adjusting it for inflation
that's occurred sometimes over
60 years. It is fine uh legally
speaking for those to be
different in the tax code than
in other areas, but they
certainly can match to it's,
it's just sort of a matter of
preference, but we really looked
at inflating those over time
just to what they were.
Thank you, Madam Chair, that was
my question. I didn't know if
that was a department.
Or
You have to get in. We we had to
change the law.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Representative, um, Chairman
Linder and tax secretary. I have
um.
Uh, secretary, Madam Chair,
secretary, we've been in some
conversations about the, the GRT
tax assessed on um revenues, um.
On
On folks who are independent
contractors and who
Uh, submit the 1099.
But then we have to wait 3 years
to get information back from,
um, the federal level to know
how much GRT2 assess, is that
correct, um, Madam Chair and
secretary
and representative Parejon, it's
18 months between the time um.
That's how long it takes for us
to.
And
Um
Madam Sharon, uh.
Secretary, I, I've had a few
really good friends who are
independent contractors who
didn't realize that they had to
pay this DRT tax, um, because
they considered what some of
what they were making,
especially when it's under um
when we're talking under 60,000
or 25,000, um, to be that, that
is their income, so they're
paying their personal income tax
on that amount, but then there
are also assessed um for the GRT
for that amount.
And, um, I was curious, Madam
Chair and represented it uh
secretary that.
For section 2B.
Where it's talking about how no
interest shall be assessed
against the taxpayer of the
failure to pay is on mistake a
law made in good faith or
reasonable grounds would uh
mistake like that, like not
realizing that you had to pay
GRT, um, and then put on a
payment plan, which I've had uh
some good friends. The on
payment plans having to pay
back, you know, up to $10,000 of
GRT assessments.
Um, would something like that
qualify.
Manure and secretary.
Madam Vice Chair and
Representative Parejon, um,
just, just sort of say to the
beginning of, of, of, of your
statement, um, you know, the
department really does take
seriously our role in trying to
provide outreach to taxpayers,
educational information and our
tax programs, um, and so I, I
think the issue that you and I
have discussed, outreach, um,
you know, in New Mexico and in
most states, most states have an
income tax, so it's not unusual
for a business to
A sales tax or GRT on their
business activity, the business
owner, so that's sort of the the
issue that you're describing.
Um, as far as section 2 of the
bill and B, yes, the, the
language basically says that we
shall not fear if the failure to
pay uh results from a
mistakeable grounds. So we're
trying to avoid there basically
is is the department as ever,
um, ever shifting protest
backlog and a lot I can do. And
it, when it's a small amount and
they can basically substantiate
that they didn't do.
we would like to do this the
easy and secretary and chairman.
Representative Terasa.
Thank you, ma'am.
Vice chair.
Relented.
Secretary, the, the uh question
I just wanted to clarification.
Um, Mr. uh, Madam Chair and
Representative Tarasis, um
2, there's, there's not a
definition there, and it's not
linked to a dollar amount
threshold, giving the.
for the first time, the ability
to waive penalty.
And interest protest, uh, when
there's no willful intent to to
evade it, and that's under $50.
Again, like.
often we'll get a protest where
a person is protesting tax
penalty and interest, and they
go ahead and pay the tax because
they realize that
interest, maybe they
underreported, um, but when it's
just penalty and interest due,
we would department it seems
reasonable under $50 because you
can imagine that the the cost to
the department and the taxpayer
is pretty high too.
get $50.
Thank you Madam.
Thank you, Mr. Tay, I just have
a couple of questions to wrap us
up, um, I think, as you all know
and understand me, I'm not one
that typically votes for
increased criminal penalties.
And I see that you've increased
criminal penalties here.
For the public and committee
that means they also went to
House Judiciary before they
landed in tax, which Madam
Secretary, I don't imagine
that's something that you do
often. I did have um just, I, I
didn't know this looking at
section 10.
Um
There
Seems to be an existing crime
for the assault and battery of a
TRD employee, and then you've
Increased or this proposes that
you increase the fee uh the
fine, not a fee, fine associated
with that, right, from $1000 to
$5000 and I would just now like
to know more, like what is the,
how is this happening, what is
the criminal penalty for this?
What does it mean for you all to
imagine safety, um, in your
bureaucratic jobs administering
New Mexico's tax code.
Uh, Madam Vice Chair, thank you
for that question. Yes, Section
10, uh, it, it's a sad thing
that we have to have a specific
section about the assault or
battery of a department
employee, and I'm glad to say
this hasn't happened in the 6
years I've been with the, the
department, a lot of these
things are deterrents that
aren't invoked and, you know,
very often in real life, but um.
We do, uh,
Fairly often have.
Between MVD and tax, you know,
which are not popular, these
are, you know, things you have
to deal with is is living in a
civilized society, but folks
don't like it, uh, it comes to
mind that uh.
Within the last year, for
example, we received a pro a pro
se.
Leading from a a tax resister
who just sort of said, I never
agreed to be taxed just cause I
live in this country, signed
with their blood.
You know, these things do happen
and it can be kind of scary
every couple months, uh,
something will happen where
someone in a protest or hearing
makes threats against the
department and we have to look
out for this person and
potentially trespass.
Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr.
Chair. What's the pleasure of
the
Who do pass.
Is there any opposition to this
motion?
Madam Secretary, you have a due
pass on House Bill 198.
Thank you so much. Thank you so
much. Thank you for the work
today. Uh, we will resume again
on Friday where we have a full
agenda.
We'll talk then thank you all
have a good day.
