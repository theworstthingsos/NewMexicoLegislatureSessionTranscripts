everyone before one of the
audience and those dinner
turning in on think for joining
us this morning that's get right
to work this morning and so
first an hour agenda we have
house bill thirty seven limit
income tax capital gains
deduction represent channel
german channel yeah the floor
make you so much mister chair
and good morning committee good
to see you on our kind of first
substantive discussion about tax
policy this bill is essentially
the same bill I actually not not
essentially it is the same bill
that was included in the tax
package last year mister chair
so you recall we filed the bill
center.
Middle the capital.
Point five hundred dollars and
through the you know it a roof
process that we follow we added
to that the ability of someone
to claim a capital gains
deduction of up to forty percent
optim one million dollars if it
involves the sale of a new
mexico business and that as I
said mister tear was part of the
tax package they still think
it's good policy we are one of
the few states in the country
that does not tax capital gains
at the ordinary income rate so
without happy to discuss the
bill for.
Thank you
a representative we should
your bill this first now go to
the audience or those in support
of house bill thirty seven
show hands please get it's going
here first bill
what mr chairman was the
committee of bill jordan with
the next voices for children and
I want to have take this
opportunity to all of the
session in the committee I want
to take this opportunity to
thank you and to congratulately
because just
I
think many of you know they buy
many times in the interim I
tepped put out a report that
showed that mexico as made the
most progress on tax equally of
any state in the nation in the
last few years
and I I just think it is a test
of it to your commitment to tax
justice and making a fair tax
system
that
that we got that on
it's really your work
I want to point out that almost
all of those improvements at the
low
worst
we hear most of our
rateful for that they also
pointed out that we haven't
addressed the top in and the
back and still remains quite
and particularly because of the
capital games and so we
appreciate your support for this
thank you
thanks sir next year sir.
I had time reading my hand my
shoulders
mr chairman members of committee
my name is mates and
and with the board of the lead
away with others of new mexico
um we did do I don't know what
you have yet yeah
has a policy that center
progressive inequitable
taxation taking the
consideration relevant
differences and annual income.
And
we think limiting the cat
capital games with that position
he was capital games are mainly
received by those with the
highest income.
And the limit on capital gains
deduction
mainly goes to those higher
income people I also want to
mention when when governor
richardson cut this bill had to
tax it's it's deduction of
raised.
The promise was that it would
bring more
back to go that has never been
realized and as a formal
corporate plan who used to do
platform location studies.
I never remember capital games
reduction coming up in the
evaluation of a plan for clevery
location.

that will create the record and
then that way you'll continue to
be participating in in that way
until we get the bugs worked o.
That being said we've come to
the end of the public comment
period for both people in the
room and online at this point we
can open up to those that are on
with me so anyone should make
comic representative in this
thank you mister german
representative the one question
I ask is kind of more of a
statement than anything is.
In a small businesses in new
mexico and and throughout the
united states.
We sometimes work as the owners
of the.
And so at the end of you know
forty years of only good company
to sell it for a mo.
And be able to last.
The.
Where did where do the million
come up with.
Mr chair and representative
thank you for that question in
in in a sense all different
perhaps to represent harper and
the chairman if if I may I
believe that was the result of
kind of consultation amongst
members on the negotiating
committee that worked through
this item when it was part of
our package.
Thank you so is that negotiable
item then at this point
i'll defer to the chairman
actually thank you thank you
representative and and to give
some background is if we would
call and I don't remember the
exact number last year but when
it passed out of this warning
this video contains flashes in
moving images.
The.
The.
The.
The.
Yeah.
This.
The.
It's not a surprise that you
know.
The.
Moving the goal post.
Would properties sold.
A located outside of the state
of new mexico.
The subject to n.
Mister chair and representative
I believe.
That if the owner the person
receiving the income is a
taxpayer in new mexico then it
would be
taxable in the state and leave
that's correct i'm getting nods
from various people who are.
Okay.
Anyone else with questions or
comments representative real.
Madam chair just in light of
understanding this better
so I have a property let's just
say.
And it was worth.
I'm reading that but i'm not
totally understanding and then I
don't want to make a bad
decision.
Well thank you for keeping your
question kind of in a nice round
numbers cause helps me a lot
so what you would be able to
deduct of that million dollars
sale is forty percent of it so
that's what four hundred
thousand dollars.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well
question it would be all capital
gains so it would not be taxed
at
your ordinary income rate.
Except for
fifteen hundred dollars.
The difference between now and
does proposal.
Mister chair and representative
we are keeping it the same as it
would be under criminal.
Because that's for the sale of a
business but if it were other
kinds of capital gain we are
changing.
If it's a business
mister chair and madame.
In doing this and i'm just.
The.
We're changing the nature of the
tax I guess you could say from a
capital gains tax to ordinary to
tax on ordinary gift.
Anyone else questioned the
comments from the committee.
Okay that being said as the
usual process in this committee
those that have this.
I will be temporary table and
then brought back up.
The emotions are second.
Opposition to that motion
they're being then thank you
representative as
it's move on to.
Representative scott in
presenting
creation of all cities and
counties fund.
Represents going over your ready
to flow as yours
thank you for terminal members
many house bill fifty four.
Version of the hold cities and
counties fund
is it attempt to remedy.
The situation would developed.
As a consequence of
attempts in house bill six
several sessions ago you capture
sales.
One of the unintended
consequences of this legislation
was that all crossed with switch
taxes are now collected at the
point of sale and communities in
the south east because all of
that economic activity is
outside of said limits.
Severely impacted uh cities
and hopes
in our teasing because that tax
base went away.
Very simply.
Asked for fifty four.
Captures eight percent.
Of the gross receipts coming to
the state after all other
obligations are met.
And them distributes that back
to the that eight percent
actual first at the county
and then at the mere musical and
other governmental entity levels
but per capital.
With that distribution new
launched.
I
waiting factor that the.
That uh.
Really takes into account.
The.
Gross receipts tax that will to
the state from the count.
It think it's well established
at me and any counties in
selfish new mexico
I huge net contributions
crossed at the states were six
tax income and
there's a consequence of the
work received slightly more
distribution then they might
otherwise I think you have an
appendix one of your financial
impact report the impact on all
of the local communities and the
state and with that mister
chairman I will stand.
Thank you representatives got
its first go to the audience in
the room all those in favor of
house bill fifty four please
raise your hand.
Yeah.
We support the
distribution and counties we
understand that you can economy
and support system
funds throughout all.
Thank you mr chairman
i'm the registered consider
representative of
this this
proposal is equal cost state not
just in certain sections
everyone benefits with this
determined.
What.
The secure members of what
obviously we stand it's we
appreciate the concept of
representative brought forward
right.
You know all your cities much
better than I I travel to state
but we have challenges to keep
up with the state has.
I can deal right state police
alone with that fourteen percent
increased having the same pull
the higher or cost of the catch
up with the state because of the
money this is also keep up just
a little bit yeah even though
it's used to have the or the
house we still struggle every
time we see businesses about
this potential as they apply
manufacturing conductions
everyone's at risk of not.
The.
Anyone else in the room support
bill fifty four.
Those are not.
We're still having still have
technical difficulties with the
system here so folks online we
apologize I apologize but we're
working through this so what i'm
gonna ask again is that for
those that are either in support
or an opposition of hospital
fifty four on line these feel
free to put it in the chat
arrival take no option at that
to the record so that you will
so that your voices will.
That being said again apologies
for not being able to have you
join us you're in the room.
Now in the committee question
thank you.
As the mayor from the small town
the lost power plan.
As mayor I would like to keep
the tax.
Mr german.
I don't know if.
Yeah.
Represent representative
channels and they will go to
representative
thank you.
The.
The.
Are getting even more.
Mr chairman.
The.
The a percent is a gross from
all thirty three.
The distribution that comes back
to
each individual county is
seventy percent a consequence of
per capital and thirty percent
consequence of the revenues that
count
true the state so it is waited
to work those counties that made
the biggest contribution.
Now once the revenue gets back
to the country.
Yeah it's distributed to
munitipalities and governmental
entities
what's left over is the only
phone that stays in.
The.
Mr chair you know I am open to
trying to support.
Favors that.
Yeah.
Where we talked about equal.
Counties.
More real dust crash
so unless this formula is
changed i'm happy to create a
fun but unless the formula.
Supporting those but lower
revenues you know I want the
inverse to happen that we're
supporting those.
Under this form.
Yeah.
The.
Fund and would be lowing to work
on the formula that what in my
opinion is.
The.
Thank you representative ten
it's going to representative.
This morning.
Really apprecia.
Sure.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Representative.
We can all.
This.
Yeah.
Apparently.
Because of destination
right because we want to.
The.
And distributing.
So we can talk about how much
three hundred and twenty.
And how.
Yeah.
Do you want to.
The.
The.
The change from destination
source.
Cost my community
about somewhere between eighteen
and twenty billion dollars.
Now my community is responsible.
Remaintaining roads services.
Yeah.
Police fire.
For all of that economic
activity
that is a current outside of the
community but comes back into
the community.
The.
The.
The.
From any other
way this thirty seventy
way attempted to do was get us
not fully home.
But hell with
their circumstance and as I call
it made up that may be ten to
eleven million dollars of
shortfall that our communities
are experienced and the other
southeast communities aren't.
I know that we all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Recognize.
Yeah.
Thank you mister chair
representative scott I think
that you're on the right track.
When I was reading the bill and
then reading the.
I noticed and I don't represent
that I was born in race there
and I know that representative
satches brought this up that are
committing
you know there are communities
that are
just proportionately
effective.
By our task system and I you
know I I would support a bill
that
raises the floor.
And las vegas and you know
smaller communities like jail
places like that that.
Probably are disproportionately.
I'm i'm reading the impact
analysis and I just saw on page
seven
you mentioned
the indian jurisdictions which I
ended up here I mean that's
probably.
But it also says okay
to me
I know having grown up there and
my family still lives there and
you know.
I guess it's not it's I don't I
don't confuse as to whether it's
included or not because on your
chart is included
so.
Mr chairman representative that
money will come back into this
account.
And then distributed to all of
the local communities.
Some
the numbers are ten appendix
once a year I believe it's
correct
and i'm i'm still not clear.
I mean whether or not this is
the right formula I mean I
think.
I want to vote on something that
does.
Yeah.
You know um.
So I i'm struggling with that
and i'm not a tax person I did
work and tax a long time ago I
was nineteen at the time but.
I just don't know I mean I it's
really
i'm struggling so maybe I need
to be convinced
mr chairman representative.
The state.
Here's over the last four years
with increase.
Six billion dollars up into the
ten million dollars sixty six.
Oh representative of very
very few local communities that
have been able to even order
study little home
increase the way to state
this legislation attempt to do
is take a portion of the gas
and discribing it back out in
the local communities so that
they might.
This.
Have some penalty from the
activity that it's correct.
The.
Thank you very question the
colours.
The the question that uh I can
appreciate.
The concept.
Been nice to see something like
this and maybe you h.
Even five years ago when the
beginning of the book and gas.
He felt r.
When we look at the forecasts
point to.
If there is an essential on this
gas were still ascending within
the next two maybe three years
it's forecasted who knows who
knows that there's going to be a
plate
and so when that happens then
how do you then begin to just
make sure that what we.
Continues and or as it ceased to
make sure that there.
Budget are balanced.
I guess the other response that
I could make to that commute is
that
the distribution being a big
percent we all recognize that.
The commodity industry and
patrolling administration is odd
and most revenue
maybe place currently we don't
know.
But at the end of the day that
eight percent distribution will
rise and folk.
With the grt private
account
so.
I could make the case that is a
self regular.
Areas
we take public policy.
As.
Two to eliminate the
portrayment.
Yeah trt revenues precipitously.
The eight percent distribution
would also draw precipi.
Thank you.
If not.
Okay.
Thank you position.
Let's go up to house bill what
eighteen.
Electric generation tax
we have eighteen months both
more representative.
Yeah.
Who is the big team
thank you mr chairman of the
committee thank you for the
present house will one eighteen
I want to start with a quick
background on
what I think happened
at that
the reason why we'll bring in
this bill now
current law states that
manufacturers and certain
headquarter companies can elect
a single sales factor of portion
in determining their corporate
income taxes in twenty nineteen
HB c added an up and computer
processing facility as an as an
activity qualifying for their
single sales factor election
there was no sunset
for it for any of those are
manufacturers including the
computer processing facility
except for
it eliminated the independent
power producers.
Those are you know companies
that produce power and sell that
through powerful disagreements
to utilities so we'll limit the
ability of those independent
power producers to elect the
single sales factor.
We came back in twenty twenty
and you are coming back many of
you came back in twenty twenty
because I was not here yet to
have reinstate the seal single
sales factor election for
independent power producers so
there was a mistake that fixed
but at that time there was a
sunset imposed on the
independent power producers for
gang first twenty twenty four
which is just a few weeks ago.
That sounds like only applied to
the independent power producers.
Yeah.
It will negatively that since
that will negatively impact the
independent power producers they
are producing solar and wind
renewable energy as per eta
they're bringing billions of
dollars into the state and now
they are subject to the sunset
which happened a few weeks ago
so what this will would do would
be to eliminate the sunset on
the independent power producers
to select to elect the single
sales factor which would be
effective on january first so
retroactive and they will be
treated like all the other
manufacturers are in the s.
It will and for some of my
colleagues this is very exciting
support the the goals of the
energy transition act.
Will bring business to.
And it will bring in lots and
lots more revenue.
Here they liters we need this
and it will maintain the status
quote and I would like to
defer to.
Representative harper would like
to see anything else
thank you chairman committee
members of
the same at a very high.
But we have several
businesses that can allow single
sales right now and we decided
as a committee that all the time
for everyone.
Our businesses.
To hire new mexican workers.
Is that.
And so it seems here is for the
for one second they have this
election is being sunset away.
Which will make it we have to
and so that's why i'm supporting
this right now trying to be
intellectually honest here even
though you know I might not be
on the energy transition bad
wagon I think this is just fair
that we treat all businesses.
And also just to be clear.
Um the attention right now was
not to get this bill out of the
committee.
Depending on how packages.
Continue with the single sales
factor portion that was.
Thank you both presenters at
this
at this point will go to the ice
all those in favor of house bill
who's raised your hands.
Thank you thank you mister chair
members of the committee and
then representing the real grand
it.

treated equally and legislation

bringing industrial scare

Thank you chairman my name is

state's two thousand and
nineteen energy transition act

investment and create jobs
