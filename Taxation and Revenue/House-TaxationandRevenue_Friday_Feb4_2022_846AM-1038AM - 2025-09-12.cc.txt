Yes we do I'll call the meeting
to order yes Representative

I am here madam chair.
Right.
Good to see you this morning
chairman sorry about the
confusion with the internet
you are here for H. J. R. six
and H. A. R. seven do you have
any expert witnesses that you'd
like to have admitted chairman
no ma'am I sure do not.
Okay all right some people
speaking on or about for your
hopefully here on behalf of but.
So that's.
Very good so the floor is you Mr
chairman.
Okay Madam chair on okay.
A state are six your lan
everybody has heard this is the
third time that okay with this
myself.
It's one to the house both times
I'll three titles and maybe
somehow I don't know what
happens the Senate side but the
last year that awaited second
committee.
And
Further what.
Disillusioned us is somebody
under pursuit
example I will use myself okay.
It one hundred percent disabled
veteran I do not pay property
taxes on my home my house.
However what we're trying to do
is that if somebody is eighty
percent disabled sixty percent
disabled we're trying to make it
to where that person can be up.
The the taxes will be a pro
rated just for the disability of
the of the year veteran.
So with that that Aaron looked
at with questions or questions.
Very good.
Let's go to the audience
Let me see here just give me one
second.
Madam chair this is
Representative Pettigrew you
will know spherical sponsor
would you like to add anything
I'm sorry I would recognize.
you're fine with the.
With your hand Representative
about post leisure I would like
to say something on this.
Absolutely.
Madam chair representative I you
know I had the pleasure of
sitting on
Military and Veterans Affairs
interim committee and
As we all are aware we don't
there are things that.
We don't all agree on.
The blessing of this committee
is is is the center of the
committee is you know the
focus is on.
Our military and our veterans
and.
As as we got close to the end of
the interim session.
Different bills were brought
forward to for to have the
committee
Sign on to and say yes we
support this total of six we all
agreed.
That
Was really good for our veterans
and enfermo Terry.
I appreciate the efforts the
representative of the outcome as
as a put forth in this in the
last three times.
Last year this is house bill two
house joint resolution two and
it passes committee on the on
with no opposition and I
appreciate that I appreciate
what you can instill of like to
see and make it all the way to
the house for this year
hopefully we have time for that.
I did want to call out the.
Fourteen of the of the.
Fourteen members on this
committee.
Twenty eight you yes
Representative twenty percent of
our house.
Top of that you represent sixty
six percent of the veterans in
the state of New Mexico.
And and
This truly does affect them.
Help them many of our military
and veterans many many of our
retired military.
Live on a fixed income.
Yes if you look at this from a
total loss that we're talking
about a fourteen dollar increase
to to the other taxpayers to
offset what.
We are retired military people
have done and protecting our our
constitution and our and our
state.
Our country and I just think
that this is critical and it's
important for us to turn around
and show our military does it
again some.
Because they gave all our
respect.
For what they did.
Once again I'd like to thank you
for the opportunity to speak on
behalf of the bill on a like to
thank Representative outcome for

Yes ma'am good morning madam
chair members committee.
My name is Richard moody I am
the CD one vice chair for the
New Mexico veterans and military

the rural caucus
we stand in strong support of
both HR six and seven for for
the benefit of veterans
throughout Mexico thank you
ma'am.
Thank you Mr moody Laura
Montoya.
Misprint toyon good morning
madam chair members of the
committee
I am more Montoya and I I wanted
to make my comments plus for
each day are six and seven right
away because we're gonna be
doing a walk from the deposit
for indigenous women for H. T.
R. six
it's changed every time a
disability percentage changes
and the veterans bring in bring
it in until the thirty days
after the noticed a value goes
out from a budget perspective
for counties it would be
challenging to know how much it
would be impacting the budget
and yield control would be
impacted it can only be used on
a primary home
more value added to the tax will
help reduce the overall mill
rate to funded jurisdiction but
if there is no new value added
to the value based for example
in rural communities this could
potentially increase the mill
rate only up to the cap any
reduction in valuation
maintenance attributed to this
expanded exemption will serve to
increase the yield control
provision applied to modify any
reduction it also serves to
transfer the cost of the
proposal to non disabled
veterans with H. G. R. seven I
wanted to remind this body we
went from four thousand now it
will be ten thousand this is
really helpful to our veterans
it's actually thirty thousand
dollars a full value and when we
did the senior value freeze we
did not upgrade or update the
veterans exemption and so if you
recall two or three years ago we
put the cap for senior value
fees from thirty two to thirty
five thousand an added incentive
I at your time is up.
Thank you I support the bill.
Thank you.
Let's see I believe we've heard
from Martin guy goes already I
see no other hands in favor
those in opposition please raise
your hand.
I see no hands in opposition.
Okay let's go back to the
panelists.
Impacted chairman I'll come on
do you have any including
remarks before we go to the
committee chairman the only
thing I'd like to add madam
chair is the question that was
asked to it will have to go to
the Veterans Services just like
the other important to us at a
hundred percent to get the
certificate to take to the.
County assessors office
everything will follow the same
procedure thank you madam chair
with that idea I'm ready for
questions great thank you on
chairman Representative Harper.
Thank you madam chair
terminal called judge it's good
to see you here this morning
again during the because
forward.
I have a just a couple technical
professionals want to make sure.
I under I understand
The implications of this and
then also may go to start madam
chair channel called.
you mentioned that this bill has
last session maybe it's true
the the committee passed the
house for into the Senate.
so I'm trying to call we was was
this part of the at the the
handful of bills that the
committee led out at the end
after I found out what our
capacity was or how to you have
to remember that no sure this
bill was probably like the
number five for the number six
bill that went through the house
and went to the Senate and
that's why that do committee
assignments last year the bills
that later went on that Act that
got passed through the house but
they would do this said that
after this bill only got one
committee assignment.
Loaded up with you.
Gotcha so so you want to hold on
to this little longer is out
your.
No just joking I I ask because
I mean you're aware chairman of
twenty been this committee for
those that have a fiscal impact
we temporarily table and then
went out.
This one has like a very small
fiscal impact of the state I
think it really only affects
the capacity for general
obligation bonds and that's
that's interesting New Mexico's
different that I think every
other state and that way were at
the state level we don't really
benefit from property taxes.
we really get all of our revenue
from income and gross receipts
and an excise taxes we don't we
don't really get any revenue at
the stable for property tax just
the the every other year general
obligation bond.
But it does have you know a an
impact on Mr county school board
those kind of things so.
Thanks for helping me remember
that
Yeah so that that's kind of a
little gray area where where we
decide to table or not table
temporarily.
Okay I have another question
so right now in our constitution
Madam chair on cone we have
this provision that says for a.
Veteran.
Who is one hundred percent
permanent we need to say thank
you not have
property taxes correct chair and
and chairman.
Under.
Yeah.
Yes Representative Madam chair.
Thank you very much and so I can
see why we would want to say
well what what are some of
eighty percent disabled I don't
have any benefit right that
doesn't seem very fair so I I I
took it to the the reason behind
it and of course you know my my
grandfather was a.
You know disabled World War two
vet one of my very best friends
in my district is a hundred
percent disabled that.
and so I just got some questions
that are are just
pointed at tax policy you know
I'm I'm trying to take you know
obviously we all are so grateful
for veterans let's just talk
about the tax policy.
And and and how to how you would
implement this if we decided to
so chair and and chairman the
way this is structured and I
appreciate how you want your but
the percent of the disability.
Would be the percentage
That the exemption on on the.
Disabled veterans home would be
from the property tax so for
example if I'm reading this
right Mr chairman.
If it's a fifty percent
disabled.
Then fifty percent of the total
value of that residence would
now not be subject to tax my
reading that correctly thank
you.
I thank you madam chair and
Representative I don't think
we're on this we're going on the
value we're going on the total
tax of the whole.
The other one is the value okay
the total tax.
Yes thank you for that
expression on that I I I
appreciate.
Exempt from taxation of
property.
The amount of the exemption
shall be a percentage equal to.
Okay yes I so I think that's
right so my my question is I'm
chairman at Madam chairman.
I'm.
Tatian of this how often does
that percentage change over the
course of of time I'm just
trying to see how how we would
implement this what are the what
are the implications.
Well it's
that simple madam chair and
representative okay my first
application you know I got out
of the military in nineteen
seventy one of course I'd never
been to get to do anything I was
living life and everything was
fantastic.
And I didn't do anything at all
until about the mid the mid
eighties that's what I started
realizing that I was eligible
for some.
About eighty four I did in my
first application
at the VA about five years to
make a decision and they gave me
a forty percent.
A little long.
I get bad were again are you I
don't know how many years later
I got to sixty and then the.
In two thousand eight.
I got to the one hundred
percent.
One hundred percent.
It was dated effective back to
two thousand three however
because I know that's next
question you're going to come up
with however when I went to the
Veterans I could not get that I
there's just no way that we can
that.
There's just no way that we can
go back and get our taxes back
from two thousand three but it
just the date that that that
that that the eligibility for
you know that.
They gave me the one hundred
percent back to a selected only
staff getting my percentage are
my property tax exemption of the
two thousand eight forward.
Yeah yeah madam chair and
journal called thank you great
great answer and and really did
lead into exactly my next
question which was okay how
stable is this our our port
county assessors going to be
you know in our our treasures
and such you have to be changing
this all the time.
Sounds like it's pretty stable I
mean it might change a little
bit over time but I'm pretty
stable but then also like you
mentioned madam chair chairman
retroactively we don't want to
put our.
Counties are school districts
and other folks in a position
where.
If but if it's retroactive ten
years although some they're
having to pay out a lot of money
that they were expecting to hurt
their budget so I appreciate you
saying that yeah we
perhaps enabling language this
this because the voters in this
past we want to make sure.
That is not retroactive
So.
I guess.
We talked a little about it
As well I guess that the next.
Point I wanted to make we talked
about earlier but going back to
yield control.
We talked about this in this
committee
We just described what what
you'll control dust especially
make sure that counties and
school board a school districts
instruction roughly the same
attacks even though property
values go up and down.
I appreciate the FIR speaks to
this it says that.
We're really doing here is we're
shifting the because of your
controller shifting the tax
burden I just want to make sure
people understand this that
we're not just in providing an
exemption that our service folks
will benefit from but on page
four of the FIR thing is the the
last paragraph talks about
because of yield control.
Making sure that we're still in
a similar tax revenue if one
group of folks is paying less
than other folks are going to
pay more.
And so what that says here is
the average benefit.
You know the these are rough
numbers so LFC staff and here it
is got to sharpen our pencils on
this with rough estimate is this
could be a seven hundred seventy
dollar benefits to these
Veterans.
and then because there's more
folks who are not veterans their
tax increase would not be the
same they're they're looking at
roughly a fourteen dollar
increase on everyone else's
taxes I just make sure we
understand that this is a
shifting.
and
and when we're making a decision
as to say is that fourteen
dollar budget our make our forty
dollar cost everyone else worse
that the benefit to the the
veterans and and maybe just
maybe it isn't I just want to
sure we understand that that's
how our process how our system
works.
Any.
Any questions thoughts on that
Senator co owner or I see
Representative editor has this
pandemic as well.
Representative madam chair.
What the the the the part that
you're talking about mostly is
on the that basically covers the
next bill more than this one.
Is on the next bill there is
the.
There is the information that
the other three basically at the
hundred thousand dollar home
the cost to somebody unit three
hundred thousand dollar what
we're that at home that is
valued at three hundred thousand
dollars would be about fourteen
dollars okay that's more on our
the house don't disillusion six
of the seven on house joint
resolution six I have not seen
those statistics.
Madam chair Akan I appreciate
that I.
And and and you're right he sure
seven may have a higher impact
on on folks who are not the
state are not veterans and then
this bill does but because of
yield control which again is
very simply if property values
go up it pushes the right down
through to the semi Tax and
values go down pushes the right
up so we get the same amount of
tax and this would effectively
for a group of people lower
their value.
And so for everyone else.
there have to pay more to make
up for that.
and and here is not very much
more but just just so you're
aware of that this is it is a
shifting of of who pays property
tax.
Representative Harper if I may
please
And please recognize the chair
Mister Representative
Thank you madam chair I have
called my apologies
You you hit this right on target
and I skimmed over in the very
beginning it does have an impact
of around fourteen dollars of
the taxpayers.
And then this one in in the
example in the FIR.
We would take a hundred if we
took a hundred thousand dollar
home there's not a matter four
thousand dollars sentient it
would be would be taxed off of
the the ninety six thousand in
full disclosure this does tacked
on two two H. J. R. seven to
that passes well we're that
number would go from four
thousand would go to the ten
thousand so now we would be done
with tax base for the ninety
thousand dollar home.
Tax base based on ninety
thousand and then it would be
added to with the with the
percent disability as well and
so that would reduce the the
more.
Taking that full disclosure a
little bit further veterans are
also eligible for two thousand
dollar Head of Family exemption
as well so everything is
additive and it is the base also
yield control it would have an
increase on on the general
population with respect to
taxpayers one of the reasons why
I made the okay the statistics
with respect to.
The the committee members here
because you guys this this
committee does madam chair
representative have
the lion's share of our veterans
when you look at the seven
counties that the represented by
this committee thanks of sixty
six percent of.
The veterans here in.
You know from statistical
standpoint we're about thirty
four percent.
But thirty four percent over
sixty two thousand plus.
Veterans.
Do.
Qualify for some level of
disability so I hope that that's
some clarification you're you're
your numbers are on target and
and you know based off of the
conceptual way that this would
lay out from from legislative
finance thank you very much
madam chair.
Thank you Representative.
You still have the floor I
believe Representative Harper
thank you madam chair
yes that was the extent of my my
discussion just want to make
sure that we understood what are
the implications what's really
gonna happen
and madam chair I you know I I
understand we we pass this out
you unanimously last last time I
mean that's I mean obviously we.
this is a hole in our our our
Swiss cheese that doesn't really
affect the state so much as it
affects locals and we're we're
making a whole little bit
bigger.
So just tax policy wise and and
I I try to be an equal
opportunity tax credit hater.
but at the same time
I I I do understand it makes
sense that.
I mean if we're gonna have a
percent disabled folks a
complete exemption.
Why would not give some.
Exemption to someone with an
eighty percent disability so.
thank you madam chair thank you.
In a cone and Representative
Pettigrew.
Thank you Representative Harper
and I would never call you later
your are Mister Rogers.
We love having you on this
committee.
After our Representative by us
is thank you madam chair thank
you Representative Alcon
Representative Pettigrew just
wanted to continue the
conversation thank you for
clarity madam chair with this is
a one seven correct we're on six
actually Representative Mr
Chairman asked us six they have
been bringing in conversations
about seven because there's some
overlap and common I guess.
Okay thank you madam sorry
last general questions because I
was okay and just begun six but
Madam chair Senator going up
why.
Why do this in our constitution
what what can we just do it in
statute.
I.
Madam chair representative I
really don't know that that's
the way it was done to begin
with when they did the first
when they did it at a hundred
percent they did through the
constitution I really have no
idea why.
And I'm not sure if I might.
I am sure.
Yes so so we're interestingly
during our last constitutional
convention in the seventies.
folks took our property tax code
and essentially put the
constitution to protect it.
And and that is one of the main
reasons if you look at like that
the tax foundation's like state
rating index.
New Mexico is always like number
one or number two best property
tax in the in the US
And and one of the reasons that
the site is because we put such
strong protections on it that we
can't change most of it in
statute most of it you have to
go to the constitution and here
in the bill I mean we're we're
actually.
Mending a section of the
constitution to make this work.
Thank you madam chair thank you
simple going no thank you
Representative Harper that was
one of the points I want to
mention is that if in a perfect
world in my mind.
Property taxes wouldn't be
anywhere near the state's
constitution.
tax policy you know unless
you're gonna have fundamental
principles shouldn't be in our
constitution.
I have a map I'm assuming from
home but I have a map up on my
office wall madam chair from the
State Land Office.
And you see these huge swaths of
the state of Mexico that are.
Not not that are on taxable
because they're either owned by.
Seven entities federal
government or state government
and so our property taxes are
ability to to build revenue
based on property taxes are
significantly depleted just from
the get go.
so I just want to make that
point the and then also madam
chair representative welcome the
these provisions are currently
in the constitution but it
doesn't state.
But I don't think if we were to
do it in statute I don't it
would be unconstitutional it
would be consistent with.
and be much easier to adjust and
much easier to.
to look at
if it's statute statutorily
madam chair the up.
What is the obligation
Of the federal government of.
With regards to disabled
veterans.
We are.
Yeah go ahead that gentleman.
Share a Representative I just
has that I the obligation is
basically our federal government
is supposed to take care of a
disabled veterans.
There is our basically once you
become a veteran
Very long.
The the the federal government
belongs to you.
Thank you madam chair of
silicone and thank thank you for
for all you.
Grow your years of service but
to me it's
There's so much of a distinction
in my mind between folks who.
Who served involuntarily who are
we who were drafted and
recruited and forced to serve.
In foreign wars and then those
who voluntarily you know since
nineteen seventy five those who.
Signed up voluntarily you know I
think
I think that the that these
these constitutional limits
don't don't draw that
distinction.
And then also the.
No there's certain families
there's a small percentage of
families in this country that
have a that have a the majority
of the veterans of this country
my family happens to be one of
them.
Close to a dozen folks in my
family have served my family is
actually a a gold star family
unfortunately twice.
So I think the I think it's sad
that the states have to pick up
the slack from the federal
government.
That that the federal
government.
Drafted them recruited them sign
them up said the mob.
And the federal government
amendment has the sole
responsibility to to make sure
that their lives are as of sept
high quality and high quality
health care high quality mental
health high quality economic
health that that they can be but
we we've we've stepped up as a
state we have a department of
military affairs.
that deals with the National
Guard and other things we have a
department of Veterans Affairs
which which complements and
picks up a lot of slack from
from the federal Veterans
Affairs so.
I think the best thing we do for
veterans is have a functional
government that
It has a robust you know Tax
base lower taxes for everybody
and provide the best services
for war veterans so that's kind
of where I'm coming from thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative Alcon.
Representative.
Other member questions or
comments.
Okay
I have a few questions and
comments.
One idea I wanted to propose to
chairman and Representative is
the idea that I understand the
purpose of this is to assist
veterans who are homeowners.
with their tax liability I mean
I I get that and I'm not opposed
to that but could there be
another way for example could we
set up a fund where veterans
could apply for to for
assistance to pay for their
taxes as opposed to from the
state for example I'm just I'm
I'm trying to come up with an
idea that
I want to say it is less
impactful than going through the
constitution and permanently.
It you know having impact on how
property values are adjusted and
so on and so forth and so I
wanted to to throw that out as
an idea for both of you and hear
your your reaction to it.
Madam chair I I really have
never thought of going anywhere
else
I just don't know how.
I don't I just don't know how we
would do it I we've gone through
this like I said over and over
again this is the first of all
that we've been heard the
thought that I'd be in another
way to do it yeah I mean this is
where I like I said this is my
third year at at this one and
that we have had no thought like
this so I I do answer that
question.
Yeah I hear ya it just I'm just
a little concerned because you
know we had this Representative
Harper very clearly delineated
what happens when we start
creating these kinds of carve
about that the card about
through the tax system have
affects that
reverberate frankly throughout
all the other taxpayers who are
dealing you know who having who
own their homes the other point
that was made in and some of the
FIR is that we were you know
reading in response to these
bills is that it benefits
veterans who are homeowners it
does not have any any benefits
to veterans who are are renters
so on and I would imagine all
the certainly I don't have any
empirical evidence at this point
that
the probably the lower income
veterans are probably the ones
that are ranchers you know I and
I know that's not an absolute
and that's not a hundred percent
and it is a generalization but
you know that you know for for
trying to help
lower income veterans
this is it this is only a
partial assistance there so
I just wanted to raise those
concerns I'm happy to hear from
other members of the committee
if there's anyone else who wants
to weigh on this bill.
I don't see any hands raised.
Yes Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you in and in your your
comments are thoughtful and and
I appreciate that it wasn't
until I read.
Some of the reports in the FIR
that that I started looking at
that are we are we truly
impacting everybody.
Then and and.
Correct and what you you have to
say no this this.
Truly goes specifically with the
property tax exemption and so
I would be interested in in
furthering those conversations
with respect to how do we help
people and and and homes or that
are renters and I think they do
have to have that the madam
chair and in response to
Representative last issues
comments you know we talk about.
You I think one of his famous is
a state has to pick up the slack
from the federal government
we're one of the eight states
That actually.
Tax our our our military
the way that we do
In thinking this through I look
at it I can Bernalillo county
there's almost forty eight
thousand veterans in Bernalillo
county.
The Bernalillo county gets the
benefit of the gross receipts
for those for those veterans
that
Go out spend their spend their
dollars that way so it's it's
it's not.
Yes there is a pay for there is
an office that that that
because of yield control we end
up with.
With others paying a higher
percentage because of this
reduction because of the way
yield control works.
The
We get our our our communities
get so much more benefit from
from our our military and as we
look at this we have all and
then we have Kirkland we have
can an airforce base we have so
many other things New Mexico has
done such a.
Great job.
Supporting our military and
being and having our bases as
part of our communities there is
a mutual benefit that we receive
from from the US and.
Money to my hope is that as
people leave the military from
anyone of those spaces.
That we give them.
The desire to stay in New
Mexico.
We show we provide them some of
those benefits we receive.
We we will actually receive in
my opinion the way that I do my
calculations and and
Representative Harper may may
disagree with this but we
received so much more with
respect to gross receipts sells
gas tax so many other things
that are veterans add to our
communities.
And I think this is pretty
minimal.
When we look at the grand scheme
of things with how our veterans
and our military support the
state thank you madam chair for
the opportunity to to.
To talk about that.
Thank you Representative I see
no other hands raised amongst
the committee members is there
what's the pleasure of the
committee.
Madam chair moved to gently
table this.
That's okay.
All right thank you there's a
motion to gently temporary
tables of this bill is there a
second.
Second.
Is there opposition.
I'm going down the list I see no
opposition
your your bill Representative is
temporary tables per our general
practice.
We are now on house joint
resolution seven.
Madam chair representative again
Stay with us.
House joint resolution seven is
already being discussed and we
can discuss that with the along
with the previous bill that just
that able to.
I.
I'm sorry I just.
You were in that.
Takes the.
In today's world.
There is an.
I don't remember or somebody
that is discharged from the
military.
R. yes an exemption on the tax
value of their home of up to
four thousand dollars what we're
doing this legislation as we are
bringing this up your ten
thousand dollars
and that we are adding the to
the just for inflation.
This bill madam chair made it
all the way to the second floor
last year and died for lack.
I wish he would act very able I
wish you would go ahead and do
that right away to that can go
have breakfast.
The last two bills a bit of both
the through there and I just
don't see yeah I I I just don't
understand what happened okay
but are you I am not the.
I don't know of anybody can
explain that to me but that's.
Sure I'm let's go to
Representative Pettigrew to want
to add anything on H. J. R.
seven.
Madam chair representative about
Colin's been able to get through
this through every committee
that every year without my help
I think I'm gonna sit back
because if if anything that I
just added on H. J. R. six is is
the reason why that got tabled I
don't want to be the cause of
that on seven.
Okay
Let's go to the attendees in the
audience.
Those in favor please raise your
hands again we're gonna limit
discussion on each side to ten
minutes one minute per person.
So these are in favor.
Representative of Laura Montoya.
Madam chair members of the
committee I need the full
support of this bill and I ask
all of you to please supported
this ten thousand it might not
sound like a lot for veterans
but it really is because it's
thirty thousand when you look at
the full value and this helps
all veterans and helps with
empty houses property tax that
helps business tax so please
this is the way up much more
fair way and the body wanted
this before we just haven't
updated it in many many years so
with installation and everything
else it would be great I would
just say avid consumer price
index instead of the word
inflation so that it can't match
the senior value free so we can
continue to help veterans every
year thank you so much for the
sponsor for always taking care
of our veterans.
Thank you Mr Toyota Gary
Williams.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee Gary Williams

Thank you Mr Williams Martin guy
Ecosse.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee of representatives
of the corner Representative
Pettigrew thank you very much

As a veteran of full disclosure
I would actually benefit from
this bill I'm a retired master
sergeant of the New Mexico
National Guard I'm also the
legislative chair for the
military of veterans leadership
council and I represent several
BSO's and military
organizations.
I want to bring one point and
this is information from the of
New Mexico department of
workforce solutions New Mexico
seven point three percent of
veterans live below the poverty
line that's eleven thousand
veterans in our state compared
to the seventeen point one
percent of non veterans
additionally the median annual
income of the New Mexico veteran
is about fifty thousand dollars
this is higher than the median
annual income of New Mexico.
Of the non veterans my twenty
five of twenty five thousand six
hundred seventy eight this bill
would go a long way to helping
veterans their families and
allowing them to stay in their
homes we urge that you support
this legislation thank you thank
you Steve Hogan.
Yes good morning madam chairman
and committee members again I
want to thank Representative
Alcon Representative Pettigrew

Hello yes yes we can you Mr
chairman members of.
Madam chair and members of the
committee then the guy goes of
New Mexico counties of assessors
affiliate chair and I just want
to reiterate as I did on the
previous joint resolution we
support our veterans we are
happy to do so
we realize and we understand
that this will create a slight
shift in the tax base which we
have
no problem with implementing and
that's what I just wanted to
reiterate that this particular
joint resolution if passed is
more easily implemented through
the assessors office then the
percentage and.
To the way that we can and in
assisting this.
Is this legislation it and.
Property owners thank you thank
you and I see one last hand it's
Steve overman are you able to
get in nasty yes can you hear me
yes my name is Steve Alterman
I'm retired military veteran
forty years of service not been
a resident New Mexico for last
thirty eight years I'm a member
of several military
organizations in the City of
Albuquerque mayor.
Part of this issue for the last
ten to twelve years up I just
received my W. two for from a
military target and I made less
than twenty six thousand dollars
last year as a retired E. nine
sergeant major let's just pull
above poverty level so I'm all
for H. J. R. Senator any bill
that would help with tax
exemptions for military veterans
with property taxes if I would
have to live off his income I'd
be in.
Big trouble so I believe H. G.
R. seven should be passed.
And not tabled.
Thank you Mr over men I see no
other hands anyone in opposition
please raise your hands.
I see no hands raised so we'll
go back to the committee.
Committee questions or comments
Representative Maestas your
hands up thank you madam chair
thank you Representative both
gone Representative Pettigrew
I know Representative Alcon has
a wonderful well as I mentioned
is waiting for us in this world
but to cook couple quick
comments if I may madam chair
one is
And I kind of alluded to it
yesterday during debate on house
bill two but.
I don't know when this was
passed but I noticed it has a it
went from three thousand to
three thousand five hundred in
two thousand three two thousand
for if you recall at that time
of the entire country was
slashing taxes.
Or
Was all at that time was all
about cutting taxes cut the
personal income tax tremendously
The food tax for cities and
counties and then and then of
course to this tax exemption and
then lo and behold five years
later the bank's crashed and and
the chief executives of our
largest city and our entire
state government.
Took an ideological no tax
pledge and and and it in my
opinion contributed tremendously
to our inability to overcome.
The Great Recession were the
last statement country to
overcome it
that created in my eye my mind
psychology to the legislature
us.
That that the only thing we can
do for for folks that we love
folks that we want to help is to
give them tax breaks.
And so some tax breaks are to
try to spur economic growth they
may or may not do that some tax
breaks or to leave a party.
But the hopefully they do that
and some taxes you just because
we love them and let's just
help.
This price falls into that third
category but now we have to flip
the switch we are no longer
constrained economically we're
no longer slashing budgets in
the middle of fiscal years were
no longer you know pinching
pennies to get by in rating
funds we have overwhelming
economic resources to help.
Those we love to spur economic
growth to do this or that and so
I would just ask
You know and I think we're ready
we're ready to do that in twenty
twenty three and beyond we've
got to get through twenty twenty
two.
Without creating more the holes
in our in our tax code so so if
folks if this doesn't reach the
finish line please understand
that that's kind of where some
of the folks are coming from we
can.
This does not help us mention
veterans that don't own homes
are presumably when you sign
that mortgage you can afford
that home the you're not paying
G. R. T. from a checkbook like
small businesses like I do which
is way more brutal than just
having having your escrow you
know peel off peel off a
percentage to pay taxes and so I
think we can get creative and
help our veterans help widows of
veterans in much more creative
ways
than than than with that then
with the tax tax break
and if we do do the tax break I
think we should do it in
statute.
Of.
Because we can adjusted you know
he over time is just way easier
to manage thank you madam chair
thank you.
Representative welcomes thank
you Representative Maestas
Representative Harper.
Thank you madam chair and
Gentleman I called on.
So I have a question a
suggestion of a COVID
So first on page two of the bill
and I'm I just I'm just curious
I'm trying to understand this
online I.
You know we talked during the
last bill discussion about being
retroactive.
And here online I it says.
Starting in two thousand six and
two thousand twenty two.
Four thousand dollar.
Exemption and and I'm just
trying to understand.
madam chair why why we're going
retroactive to two thousand six
there or my mic misunderstanding
that.
The
chair representative Harper I
don't understand your question
because basically what it is is
basically saying that the last
time it changed was in two
thousand six and that was four
thousand and it is at four
thousand dollars so it will.
And six to two thousand twenty
two so I have no idea what your
question is no thank you I was I
was reading it wrong thank you
for correcting me I was saying
that we had three thousand in
two thousand four and thirty
five hundred and two thousand
five.
But then I didn't read past that
use the the language that says
two to four thousand four after
two thousand five so so that
that really is just clean up
language that they've added
right there so so thank you that
that answers that question.
second
of COVID here this this is
really I think just a suggestion
online a Levin.
Of page two where we're staying
here that were adjusting for
inflation.
sore indexing of this exemption.
and and and madam chair
and members of the committee and
introspection oh we don't index
tax credits exemptions
deductions
I'm just in general that's
that's not a good tax policy but
last year.
or your before I can't remember
when we renewed the exemption
for seniors.
There was an indexing added.
But was that a little bit
differently and so this this
would be the suggestion I'm
saying it's just the for
information.
inflation is really something
that's calculated Daly and and
just over the year and and it's
If we just sort of flotation
that could be vacant and cost
some issues I would I would
recommend to you that we more
the same language the same.
Process we did for the the
senior exemption and I believe
that was tied to the consumer
price index which is only
calculated once a year.
so that that would be a
suggestion
that that perhaps you your man
that you know is viewed as this
continues the you know whatever
the part of me is our this goes
to the process any any thoughts
on that suggestion chairman
madam chair Madam chair
representative however what do
we talk about the adjusted for
inflation with the drafters and
everybody else they're really
saying that this covers the Cola
the cost of living adjustment
but in other words the governor
the federal government those of
us on social security at a five
point nine percent increase this
year this bill would have passed
last year the agency that it
died on the Senate floor.
it would have been adjusted that
that by what nine percent this
year.
Or I'll that so you know that's
what I'm saying that that's what
I understood it I am not a tax
man so it is not I I don't know
how else to explain yeah yeah so
so madam chair and and internal
count thank you for that and I'm
not I'm not saying you're you're
doing something wrong here I
understand you're doing what I'm
saying is there are several ways
to calculate inflation.
There are several indexes that
are calculated and and depending
on which one you choose.
It could be a different number
for the same here.
And depending on which one you
choose their updated not just
yearly but.
Actually every day and so I'm
just suggesting to you that you
choose one of those indices.
And and I I I recommend that we
more the one that we chose for
the senior US service an
exemption for property tax so
that we're not.
We're not using two different
ways to measure and and adjust
for inflation that we're being
consistent across our state
statutes that.
That that's the suggestion madam
chair and chairman.
all right and then and then just
the last comment again it's
going to yield control and I and
I appreciate you FIR.
Again just so I understand we
are shifting.
tax burden and at the bottom of
page two for this bill LFC and
and and TRD or saying that it's
about a thirty four dollar
increase for everyone else's
property tax and they have a
nice break down to by county and
and my County central county of
the a forty three dollar
increase on everyone's property
taxes just so folks are aware
how this how this would work
thank you madam chair thank
chairman.
Thank you are there other
members who wish to speak.
Like to share some thoughts on
how this could be done
and it they kind of echo echo
what Representative my us to
say.
We have the ability to do this.
to adjust the laws through
legislation as opposed to a
constitutional amendment.
It's a little odd and unique
maybe in I guess I haven't read
that every provision of the
constitution have such specific
language often constitutional
provisions permit something with
the understanding that there may
be implementing legislation and
in fact I'm carrying a bill that
does just that it sets
parameters generally but the
specifics are set by by
legislation and that allows the
state greater flexibility in
when situations change there's
times of need and so on so I
would be happy to work with the
Sanchez on crafting such
legislation moving forward but I
think there is a sufficient
concern here that I it was that
I believe it's what this bill
will likely be tabled as well
but I'm interested in hearing
now what is the pleasure of the
committee.
Representative Harper you want
to help us with the motion.
Our manager I'll move that we
actually lovingly
temporarily to table and and
perhaps we can work these next
few days
maybe some amendments maybe some
other ways
maybe this becomes part of our
tax package that we the
committee releases this year.
Thank you very much is there a
second.
It's just starting college you
is.
Down from.
Madam chair okay.
I can't see who's speaking but
somebody needs to mute
themselves so it motion made by
Representative Harper's second
by Representative current in is
there any opposition to the
motion to gently temporarily
table.
I see no opposition
chairman and Representative
Pettigrew thank you for
presenting before us these are
very important issues and I know
every member of the committee is
very interested in working with
you going forward to find a way
to address this perhaps through
legislation or other ways so
that we can supporter our
veterans moving forward in terms
of property taxes thank you.
Thank you madam chair the
committee.
Thank you
I am texting chairwoman
Thompson.
Madam chair I am here okay very
good thank you for coming so
promptly so representative
Thompson has house bill ninety
five health easy enrollment act
the floor is yours madam chair.
Give me one second to let my
committee know that I'm leaving
them okay and do you have
experts maybe we could let them
in.
I do I have Colin bio.
and I believe Gabby Rivera.
Okay.
I'm.
Analyst.
Right.
Chair Thompson are you back with
us yes I am I'm and also
secretary.
Secretary Schardin Clarke is an
expert okay great great.
the floor is yours chairwoman
Thompson thank you madam chair
and.
But I'm I'm not so good at
sharing a meeting and presenting
a bill so we.
so H. B. ninety five we have you
we had last year and it is it's
called the easy enrollment bill
and essentially what it does is
I stop you one second I'm one
yes for your other meeting do I
we're hearing some background
okay is that you.
I think so okay I'm sorry.
No I haven't done this this yet
this way this year so I'm it is
it is basically what it says is
that when you file your tax your
state taxes you could check a
box that will state someone you
or someone in your household
does not have health insurance
and we hopefully we all know
that anyone who is uninsured
costs us all essentially in
uncompensated care and in higher
insurance rates for us so when
you check the box that the text
the text people will look
forward it to Human Services
will then take a look at your
tax returns and all of this is
with the permission of the tax
filer this doesn't happen
automatically
And so when you checked the box
you as I said it goes to it goes
to I'm so sorry I'm being told
to turn off my my camera on my
other one and I don't know how
to that so I'm gonna just do
something different so anyway
join the club where all the
trouble is that I am not a
juggler by.
and so that Human Services
Department will look at the tax
file and decide if if a person
our family is eligible for
Medicaid they will help them
sign up if they are not but they
are eligible for the exchange
they will forward the
information to the exchange
So that that that people can get
their insurance and this will
all be the people will be
assisted with this along the way
so with that madam chair I will
turn it over first I think two
more two out Colin bio for few
words and then we'll go to
secretary.
I'm sorry thank you Gabby and
then to secretary secretary
Schardin Clarke thank you madam
chair you're welcome madam chair
if if the presenters could keep
their comments as brief as
possible we have a pretty full
agenda happy to hear from you.
Thank you madam chair members
the committee column by with the
opposite superintendent of
insurance and I will be sure to
keep this brief
just I just really want to
commend representative on in
career introducing this we think
that it's going to be an
important tool for reaching
people that we haven't been able
to reach and making sure that
there's a way to connect them
with health coverage we know
that about half of those who are
uninsured qualify for some form
of financial assistance to help
them with their health coverage
and so we just need to get that
information to people and get
them the resources to to connect
with coverage and understand
their options and we think this
is a great way to leverage the
state income tax it then to find
a better entry point for those
individuals who are uninsured to
make sure that that they are
getting the coverage that they
need to stay healthy and with
that I will turn it over to
Gabby's going to come with that
yet thank you madam chair thank
you Mr Vera.
Thank you madam chair thank you
committee members and I'm sorry
my cameras not working right now
but I am the opposing
communications coordinator with
Health Action New Mexico I'll
just add really briefly Health
Action has been the lead
advocacy organization on this
for over three years and we just
want to instill a sense of
urgency around passing this bill
this session on the public
health emergency and success
maybe that over eighty thousand
New Mexicans will lose their
Medicaid coverage will have to
move to exchange many others
have lost jobs and state
insurance that goes with it and
may need to review their
coverage options the first time
in years so we need passes
enrollment now to create a new
at our starting point for these
individuals and for all New
Mexicans to enroll in coverage
thank you.
Thank you Mr Vera and did
secretary Schardin Clarke wish
to address this bill thank you
madam chair and members of the
committee I'll be really brief I
think are sponsoring the other
speakers have said a lot of that
I agree with wholeheartedly I
just want to emphasize that
house bill ninety five really
represents good government in
action item taxed Representative
is here to support and we will
be able to implement this bill
very seamlessly with existing
resources this is a unique
opportunity for government to
work together on a common sense
solution that'll remove
obstacles to health insurance
very vulnerable New Mexicans and
with that also stand for any
questions thank you thank you
madam secretary
The chairwoman Thompson did you
have any other comments you'd
like to make before I go to the

Association so I I speak on
behalf of myself as well as the
New Mexico Public Health
Association and strong support
and easy enrollment.
With the current pandemic of
affordable health coverage is
more important than ever
approximately one hundred and
thirteen thousand New Mexicans
are eligible for Medicaid or tax
credits for the portable health
coverage yet they're not rules
very soon rolling can include
language barriers literacy
barriers and time constraints
any income tax returns as an
entry point to access healthcare
makes good sense our public
health worker.
Public health workers are
overburdened many uninsured rely
on healthcare delivery workforce
for assistance with health care
coverage enrollment easy
enrollment is one simple way
that we can reduce some of the
burden on our healthcare
workforce.
Reducing this added burden will
allow healthcare workers to
better treat their clients and
improve overall health options.
I just want to add one more
thing that easy enrollment is
already been successful in
Maryland specially among young
people which improves a restful
and bring down rates and this
will help to towards our
uncompensated care costs in the
state of over one hundred
million dollars each year thank
you.
Thank you well I just learned
something room three seventeen
is our room where there's a live
person I believe so Kimberly is
that being a range so that the
person in room three seventeen
can speak.
I yes I'm gonna try and use them
one more time I think that
having Mike issues we did call I
see
yourself from three seventeen.
And just be aware we're
beginning to bump up against the
ten minute mark I'll allow for a
little bit more time but
we recognize there's certainly a
lot of support in the audience
for this seventeen a showing as
an muted
can you try saying something.
I'm going to have a person from
your seventeen make a statement
on my computer if you don't
mind.
Well sure but I'm gonna go to
the next person while we're
waiting for that to happen
categories most mostly.
Kathleen.
Thank you German chancellor
members of the committee and
representative Thompson thank
you for bringing this bill
forward I'm also writing is a.
He's retired retired registered
nurse masters in preventive
medicine and member of the New
Mexico Public Health
Association.
We understand that Merioles do
try this enrollment approach and
found that about ten percent of
those responding or four
thousand did enroll and they
found that the majority rules in
to medicate two thirds were
younger than thirty four and
half were from households with
incomes less than one hundred
percent of the property poverty
level so this would be an
important approach to reach of
vulnerable group in New Mexico
not over one of our budget and
it will bring in federal
matching funds this is priority
bills are in G. HA please vote
do packs thank you very much.
Thank you if we could have the
individual from three seventeen
please identify him or herself.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you for having
me my name is Brooke weekends
and I am and and turn for Julie
on a crew planned parenthood
boats New Mexico supports this
bill because we believe access
to health care is a basic human
right all New Mexicans are
deserve the benefit of we
respectfully ask the committee
for it to pass on this important
legislation thank you.
Thank you I'm gonna take two
more individuals and then we'll
go back to the committee
contact.
Madam chair members of the
committee the league of women
voters of New Mexico strongly
supports H. B. ninety five our
position is that every New
Mexicans should have a
comprehensive local of health
care simplified administration
and seamless coverage on a
personal note every year when
spending hours going through my
tax records to try to fill out
the exchange website I wonder
how someone with a full time job
and a computer at home could
possibly manage it why can't the
strange just get the information
it needs from the tax form V.
ninety five sounds like a good
first step it will help a lot of
people get enrolled in the
league of women voters and I
stand in strong support thank
you.
Thank you miss pack Ellen pines.
Ellen.
Ellen.
I just knew Allen thank you I I
just got the on mute and did
that thank you madam chair and
members of the committee
Ellen pines representing the
disability coalition and we
stand in support of this bill.
Health insurance or health
coverage is only one factor in
good health but it's a very
important one and unfortunately
a significant number of New
Mexicans who are uninsured would
qualify to get either low cost
or no cost health coverage but
either don't realize it or don't
know how to navigate the system
to get it this is a way to help
connect them to that coverage
it's voluntary it will help them
lead healthier lives it's good
for the entire society as has
been described by earlier
commenters and we urge your
support of the bill thank you
madam chair.
Thank you thank you for the
attendees participation I'd like
to go back to the committee now
Chair Thompson did you have any
concluding words speak for we go
back to committee and also I
noticed Senator Stefano ex was
on the panel and I believe she's
a co sponsor if you'd like to
say a few words about the bill
I'd be happy to permitted to do
that I have nothing further I'm
just just listen to the audience
and vote for this.
Senator Stefanics and safety.
Thank you madam chair.
I just in my on yes you are
thank you so much madam chair
members of the committee I and
several other senators are here
to support this in the Senate if
it does pass your committee and
the house floor we feel it's
very important for every New
Mexicans that have the
opportunity for health care
coverage in excess and I know
this will only deal with the
health insurance side but we
want to keep on working for
everyone to get their care that
they need thank you so much this
morning thank you Senator
Stefanics now let's go to the
committee up I see floor leader
Martinez says the Santa.
Thank you madam chair when
appropriate I'd like to move it
to pass okay Representative
Strickler.
Thank you thank you madam chair
thank you representative
Thompson and I guess this is
kind of a new approach balance
the only states done this
they were very poor state so
you know we would probably have
greater needs than anybody else.
For the are there any other
states.
That fallen RK at a gory we
should we have such a high
poverty rates were forty seventh
in per capita income.
How about the the poor states in
the country at Alabama
Mississippi West Virginia
Arkansas they're in the same
boat that we're and we know what
they're doing to sign up folks
for Medicaid.
Madam chair and Representative
Strickler I'm this is an
innovative program and I I think
we're ahead of the curve
actually in terms of this so I I
don't know with Colin or Gabby
have information about other
states but I know that that the
folks who have been working with
on this I have been working
closely with the folks from
Maryland and and in Maryland
it's been quite successful but
Connor Gabby do you have more.
Madam chair and and
Representative
In addition to Maryland both
Virginia and Colorado have
passed legislation enacting a
similar program I I'm not sure
about the date that that you
mentioned Gabby may have may
have a little bit more
information but I do know that
more and more states across the
country are considering that the
prosje because it is a unique
and and new way to reach folks
that we have been able to reach.
And the only other state that
wasn't mentioned as
Pennsylvania's doing it
administratively rather than in
legislation that Agari nothing
non among the states you
mentioned Representative.
Okay thank you madam chair and
and representative Thompson so
this is kind of a new thing and
we we've got some money for
folks in the state just
Doesn't make sense they don't
sign up for Medicaid I have a
lot of.
A lot of friends that are on the
Medicaid program they're very
low income and I need all the
help they can get so this is a
very
interesting coming and animated
for a program thank you madam
chair at all I.
Okay thank you Representative
Strickler

Very good you madam chair woman
Thompson of a do pass thank you
for attending our meeting today
thank you madam chair and
members.
And madam chair can I.
When my.
Oh I'm sorry please do.
So thank you madam chair I I was
very supportive of this measure
and tell her that Planned
Parenthood was supporting it and
then I had to really think hard
about continuing that yes so I
just wanted to let you know
that.
Good deal thank you.
Thank you Representative we're
on to house bill one oh two
Representative Cadena.
Do you like to present please.
Yes I would like to present
this.
madam chair of before I get
started if I might have my
experts pop it in case there's
some technical questions this
morning we have Richard Anklam
the president Executive Director
of The New Mexico tax research
institute as well as John
Travis.
The treasurer and CFO for Sandia
peak tram and ski company thank
you madam chair.
Welcome and as we do that I'll
get started I am honored to
present this somewhat complex
tax bill that I've described in
previous committees as a unicorn
because house bill one oh two a
pass through entity tax will
have no impact on the state of
New Mexico revenue yes create
and economic development
opportunity for potentially are
small and medium business owners
to continue to you to use
equitable and forward thinking
tax policy to bring it back
economic development development
dollars into New Mexico so in a
straightforward way what this
legislation does is allow
businesses that function as pass
through entities including
partnerships LLCs and S.
corporations are the option to
decide whether they'd like to
pay their business entity pay
tax on the income they earn or
continue as as they do currently
having the individual partners
are owners pay on their share of
the business income for those
entities that elect to pay that
tax at the entity level it will
then remove that amount of tax
paid from the inclusion at the
individual of filer level when
they go on to the federal system
and approach their salts their
state and local tax deduction
amount which today is capped at
ten thousand dollars for most
tax filers it will also that in
turn provided tax deduction
amount on the businesses federal
taxes again this legislation
will have no hit no impact on
New Mexico's revenue stream I'll
just wrap with saying that this
legislation is timely in that
federal tax law changes went
into effect several years ago
and and twenty seventeen and
that's when the the federal
government or the in this role
limited the itemized deduction
for the SALT deductions two five
thousand for maybe percent with
separate returns and ten
thousand for all other.
tax filers so as such that's why
The New Mexico chamber of
commerce with other supporters
is interested in this bill and
for now madam chair I will I
think we'll go to public comment
if you like and then we have our
incredible experts on hand to
add to the debate as we get to
the questions from committee.
Representative today and I think
you may also have an amendment
do not.
Madam chair thank you for that.
What many explain the amendment
that we go to the audience if
that was the most most men and
for discussion the amendment is
connected to somewhat of the
rhythm and patterns of how tax
filing happens and honoring and
recognizing that it's it happens
pretty often that small
businesses file an extension
but for our a request an
extension before filing their
taxes so are amendment here just
allows for that instead of
having a hard date on the filing
that would come should someone
elective thousand entities so it
it's it's working to match in
case that they need that
extension of the could still
elects to do this at the entity
level right and the amendment
number that I have is two two
two four six zero point one is
that correct Representative yes
it looks like it thank you madam
chair you're welcome we'll go to
the audience will then discuss
the amendment briefly and
hopefully get that attached and
then we'll talk about the the
bill itself so
members of the audience those in
favor please raise your hand.
Having trouble finding the
attendees here.
Kimberly could you
These call on those work with
raised hands while I try to get
back into the attendee list
madam chair I'm first on the
list I have when Lopez.
The meters are.
Madam chair members the
committee are we support this
bill any you know the answer to
I will issues are are the key
issue that makes it very
complicated in a lot of
different context was specially
when you have introduce versus
actually individuals from our
tax payers and providers and and
whatnot so we support this bill
if if it clarifies those issues
and commend the sponsor for
bringing forward thank you thank
you Kimberly are back now so
bill Lee.
Thank you madam chairman members
of the committee bill Lee
chairman are a bit CEO and
president of the calculation of
the chamber of commerce we stand
firmly in support of this bill
we think that the option of
having you to business and to be
paid tax on the income it earns
are having individual partners
or owners pay their share the
business in income makes a lot
of sense plus this bill is a big
boost for small businesses in
New Mexico increase the federal
tax savings for New Mexico small
businesses without costing you
revenue to the state for those
reasons we are in full support
thank you madam chair and
members thank you thank you Mr
Lee rob black.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is rob
black and I'm the president and
CEO of the New Mexico chamber of
commerce here in support of HB
want to most businesses in New
Mexico operate as pass through
entities such as partnerships
limited liability corporations
companies and escorts think
about people who jointly own a
restaurant food truck rather
small business currently they
split the net revenue the
business and paste state taxes
on it as individuals the
business doesn't pay that state
tax this bill would give the
option of paying state income
tax at the entity or business
level rather than at the
individual level this would not
change the amount of income tax
the state collects but would
allow these businesses on
business owners to maximize the
federal itemized individual
state and local tax deduction
and would give them a business
tax amount to deduct from their
federal business taxes having
misdirection would decrease
their federal taxes and give
them more money to invest in our
business many states have
already made this change so make
sense for New Mexico to private
provide this option for our
local small businesses.
To remain competitive thank you.
Thank you Mr black Jason
Espinoza.
Madam chair members of the
committee Jason Espinoza state
director with the national
federation of independent
business be solely
representative.
All independent businesses
across the country I was gonna
transported legislation for all
the reasons stated and thank the

Good morning madam chairman.

looks like you're muted.
And now here I am unit now go
ahead.
Madam chairman members of the
committee and demonio.
This is a member of the.
Mexico chamber of commerce sure
there text many and we have been
working on this stuff two years
Mr Chavez is been quite
instrumental on this and I
would.
Can you help this because it is
like the Sanchez said you record
it it's good for our taxpayers
and it doesn't cost a stated
that.
Thank you for.
Thank you Mr o'neill now going
to those in opposition anyone
wishing to speak in opposition.
Currently not okay that go back
to the sponsor I believe I move
the amendment for discussion
purposes is there any discussion
on the amendment now go to the
bill.
I see two hands racer is are
those on the amendment Harper
Representative Harper and Scott
or on bill itself.
Bill self manager okay all right
so any questions chair thank you
Representative Scott.
I see no questions or comments
on the amendment.
Any opposition to the amendment.
Okay I see I'm assuming
Representative Scott and the
Hartford do not propose is that
correct.
That's correct very good so you
have an amended bill
Representative.
Madam chair what is the member
do I don't have a copy the
amendment sorry okay I'm pretty
sure it's in the share file it
on page I'll be happy just to
read it's a one line amendment
Representative Strickler on page
two lines thirteen before the
word do do you do insert
original or extended.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you so I saw no opposition
to the amendment you have an
amended bill Representative now
let's go to the bill itself
Representative Harper.
Thank you madam chair
representative Cadena
thank you for bringing this
forward I I just want to spend
just like.
Just talk about what this bill
is actually doing because I I
think it's a great education
to talk to perhaps are are you
on this committee are or are not
familiar.
So
first what is introduce me and
and what are we talking about
income tax but what what is this
and.
what what was what I think is
interesting New Mexico and the
vast majority of other states
and and US.
we have you know an income tax.
but that income tax does not
just by you know individual
families like me paying it it's
also business income.
And and what this is it it
happens through what we call a
pass through entity so if you
have a business like an LLC or a
partnership.
that's not a structured as a
corporation
they don't pay
income taxes at the business and
entity level they pay that's a
personal income tax level.
What that means is at the end of
the year
the income that the business had
a subtract off all the expenses
and whatever they you know they
do their their their their
accounting bookkeeping and then
the profit is slow down to the
partners or to the individual
owners and they pay tax on that
profit as per at as income tax.
so
The secretary in the prior
secretary before that can you
please give us a break down of
our state what percent of our
income taxes business income
versus personal income.
And it's really hard
both ministrations most I just
said we we can try to this is
really challenge so anyway I
just want to understand that's
that's how the vast majority of
our our business income is taxed
we only have a handful of
corporations in the state.
So what happened recently was
the TCGA Hey what is that the
tax cuts and jobs act the
federal government did a few
years ago.
They change something.
and if you remember when you
when you file your federal
income taxes.
You have there's a line item in
there for how much state tax
that you pay.
Local tax you pay and you can
deduct that.
that that to those tax you pay
from the.
The money that's that is taxed
at the federal level.
Well the Feds they saw that
there are a lot of states that
have high tax rates and lots of
folks claiming a lot of state
taxes and there are they decided
that they didn't like that that
the federal government is
essentially subsidizing state
taxation.
And so they pass this change
that there's a ten thousand
dollar cap now you can't deduct
from your federal taxes more
than ten thousand dollars of
your state and local taxes.
Stable back to order.
Okay so that that's been the
practice for the last couple
years.
Several states that have tried
to creatively do things to kind
of get away around some of these
changes and the irises
disallowed many of these these
workarounds but interestingly
they have allowed this what.
I'm and nineteen other states
have gone for with this this
change here and and so there we
are just kind of quietly just
allowing this one to happen.
And all this bill does.
Is
instead of that income in past
to the personal.
You know disbursement I'm sorry
instead of that part of that tax
being accounted for as a
personal income tax level it's
allowing the entity part when
they're doing all that
bookkeeping in removing all the
options it's allowing the taxes
to be included as part of that.
And so what this does it really
I I love care to set to set and
I think was secretary o'neill so
this is really a unicorn because
it.
It helps
our small businesses our New
Mexico taxpayers.
Actually slightly increases our
New Mexico tax revenue.
But it decreases our our small
businesses small business owners
federal tax so there net.
the net taxes actually lower for
that so I mean I I don't know
how often we see something like
this I think it's I think it's a
great move we should only do it
it helps New Mexico taxpayers it
helps Mexico's coffers and if
the federal government is
allowing this to happen we
should do it so anyway I just
wanna say thank you for for
caring this and the strongly
supported thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative
Representative Scott.
Thank you madam chair.
Just a little bit of confusion
what part.
Course circumventing the.
Thousand dollars state tax
deduction going to the.
Federal tax forms.
Is there any limitation.
On.
The.
With respect to.
Just confused as to.
As to how.
To to to follow federal tax form
separately.
Madam chair representative and I
yes Mr right.
Thank you madam chair
representative I am gonna turn
that question state to these tax
experts with me today so whether
I'm John Richard are are Mr
allowed like to handle that when
I'll turn it over.
Richard are you available.
Yes Representative all those
entities filed different returns
as it is
Is is Representative Harper was
explaining
that the ten thousand dollar
limitation is is at the
individual level and this just
allows them these existing
entities to to to remit the tax
at that as an entity
and then exempted at the
individual level so that the
same or more taxes paid with
that slightly higher maximum
rate being imposed
but the the ten thousand dollar
limitation on state and local
tax deductions is rendered
inapplicable because it's an
added through before it flows to
the individual.
Does that answer the question
Representative.
Chair hysterectomy I think there
is.
There's no limitation on state
and local taxes that get paid by
the entity is that what I'm
hearing.
Madam chair representative
that's correct.
Yes it's expensive the entity
so they write the check instead
of the individual in many cases
it's actually for their
convenience not technical thank
you.
Okay thank you Mr
Representative madam chair
that's the only question.
Thank you Representative Scott
let me see if there are any
other representatives who wish
to ask a question or speak I do
not see anyone else with their
hand raised so happy to
entertain a motion.
Madam chair but he passed on as
amended.

Harper and is there a second.
