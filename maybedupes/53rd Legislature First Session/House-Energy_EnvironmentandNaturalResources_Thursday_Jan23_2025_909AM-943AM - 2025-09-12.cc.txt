Good morning. My name is Mark

The northern half of Roswell
West to the Chavis County line.
I started as an oil field worker
when I was a 17 years old.
I, uh, eventually was able to
put together my own company,
have a small.
Independent company based in
Roswelle, um 22 employees.
I've served as an advisory
advisor on energy matters to
Um, under, under President
Clinton, the Secretary Hazel
O'Leary.
Under President Bush, uh to
Secretary Manuel Lujan, on
public lands issues, um, my
philosophy is basically
If we get good science and we
get good financial um impact
statements, we can probably make
the right decision.
So hopefully, science will drive
good policy. Thank you.
Got a good morning, everyone.
Thank you for being here. My
name is Michelle Paulina Bea,
and I am representing District
69 in the counties of
Bernalillo, Cibola, McKinley,
San Juan, Socorro, and Valencia.
I'm from Torilla, New Mexico.
Great to be here in my other

on is judiciary. Thank you.
Good morning, everybody. Thank
you for being here. My name is
John Henry.
I'm from Artesia, New Mexico,
uh, I serve any County, a little
bit of Chavez and go down into
Taro County, uh, a little bit. I
was at Eddie County commissioner

It was small.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. My name is
Nathan Small. I'm proud to

Good morning, everyone. My name
is Elaine Senna-Cortez and I
represent the beautiful people
of District 62. I live in Hobbs,
New Mexico, um, in my day job, I
own a consulting business and
I'm a professor at University of
the Southwest and Eastern New
Mexico University. My husband is
a 5th judicial district judge in
Lake County and all of that
sounds like really impressive,
right, but both of us grew up
really poor. We had humble
beginnings. Um, I could have
been a statistic.
As a matter of fact, I should
have been a statistic, and I'm
here today because I represent
the power of choice, and you get
to choose the life that you want
by the choices that you make and
after I told you those great
impressive things, my, my
husband actually started off in
pipeline construction and thank
God because it helps support his
family and put food on the
table, and so, well, I'm
grateful for where we are and
even more grateful for our
humble beginnings, and I'm
really
decided to serve. Thank you so
much.
Buenos
Um, state rep Miguel Garcia.
House District 14.
Um
I, uh, I'm the
The longest serving state rep.
In the House of Representatives
on 28 years.
So the rookies need to kind of
take heed.
In terms of the wisdom that I
carry.
And if I'm voting yes on the
piece of legislation that comes,
that decision comes with a lot
of wisdom and a lot of
experience.
rookies kind of take into
consideration.
And uh
Uh, yeah.
I started off on this committee,
the Energy committee, when I
first got elected.
My first year was a
1997.
Um
And I stayed on this committee
for about 10 years and then
moved on to.
Chair of another committee.
Um
So I'm kind of glad to be back.
The saddle
On this committee, uh, my
district is kind of a historical
district that includes portions
of the city of Abuera.
And the unincorporated area of
um.
Earnio County
Um
My district starts off on uh
South Broadway community.
South Broadway community is kind
of a tri-cultural community.
Made up by Afro-Americans,
Mexican immigrants.
And native New Mexican uh.
Picanos
Um, first African-Americans to
come into the urban area.
Settled in South Broadway.
And some of the most outstanding
families and American families
originated from there.
Um
Uh, also, I crossed the railroad
tracks and I'm in uh Barrela.
I realize it's an old
traditional land-based Hispanic
community.
Established in the 1750s as
A beer.
From people from La Frisco right
and from old town.
Then we crossed the Rio Grande
and we're on O Arisco.
On the rico was first settled by
my great grandpa.
Uh, to the
Uh, 8th hour.
A knife power, Pedro the Rai
Chavez in the 1640s.
And then re-established as a
Spanish land grant.
1690 by my great grandpa to the.
8
And um
Then we cross uh
Old course, and I get some blue
collar Chicano neighborhoods on
the West Central area of my
district.
Alamosa Stinson Tower.
Stinson Tower, uh,
Uh, neighborhood is where the
answers set up shop.
Early on
And they're all uh
Homestead and their old garage
is still standing there on
Central and uncertain.
So I,
I have a real proud district,
uh.
Out of traditional families and
uh.
Uh, and I wouldn't trade her for
the world.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Get a real bad ring if we have 2
of those on at once. So, uh, uh,
good morning, Mr. Chair.
Uh, members of the committee.
A different look to us this
year, uh, pretty dramatic, uh,
face lift that we've taken on.
Um
I'm Representative Montoya. I'm
from San Juan County, um.
I, uh,
This is my 10th year here in the
legislature.
Served uh uh in the
Previous governor's
administration. I was chief of
staff for Lieutenant Governor
John Sanchez.
Um
I
Have representative uh San Juan
County.
Uh, from the Plata community to
the Aztec community.
Um, and I represent
Most folks say an oil and gas
community, but I
A better description would be a
gas and oil community up in San
Juan County.
Um, and I do that as a
Coal miner.
32 years as in the coal mining
industry, coal electric uh
generation.
And uh
My, my wife, I'm, I'm a, my wife
and I have been married. It will
be 40 years here in
May that.
We got married at 11.
Um
Uh, I, I have 4 grown sons and 6
grandchildren, um.
My, my wife is uh Navajo and so
we have a mixed family of the
reason I was able to get the job
at the mine was I was supporting
a native household.
Um
I
Come to this as a lifelong blue
collar.
Person
And so I will generally look at
things from the middle class
people who are struggling to
pay.
Uh, their way, I will be looking
at it from the standpoint of
Uh, how, how does this affect
the bottom line? How does this
affect the pocketbook,
especially of middle class New
Mexico, which
is really who's paying the bills
here, um.
You hear probably a lot about
the, the rich.
There's just not that many rich
in New Mexico.
Um, so the reality is the
policies that we pass.
Pretty much affect
Uh, middle class New Mexicans
cause they're the ones paying
the bills. So, um,
I look forward to.
Maybe a little bit more
congenial relationship than in
the past. I'm hoping for that.
Um, hoping for.
Not working so many Saturdays, I
think everybody in this room
would appreciate that.
And uh at the same time, I do
look for
Uh, there to be differences and
for us to have a a robust debate
on the issues.
And realizing when you've heard
people talk today, everybody
comes from a different
perspective.
And uh I'd like to end with
this. If I were to
Take a new person who had never
been to the Roundhouse before
and I put somebody outside of
the Secretary of State's office.
I put somebody in the bathroom.
I put somebody.
the chief clerk's office.
And then I put somebody in the
rotunda, and I asked him to
describe.
This building and what happens
here.
I guarantee you, everybody would
have a different story.
And a different perspective.
And that's what happens with
people who come to serve in this
legislature as they come from
different parts of the country.
Different parts of it maybe from
the country, but different parts
of the state.
They uh have different.
Households and everyone else.
Uh, the idea is how do we pass
legislation that benefits most
of the people of New Mexico.
Uh, how do we not harm people?
How do we, how do we help
people?
raise their families, um, and,
and, and if we can do that,
maybe we can come together with
uh
Best practices, best policies,
um,
And uh and I hope that's what we
do. I hope that when the debate
takes place, people
are not just talking to hear to,
to, to say what they believe but
maybe listen.
Because everyone here is
representing roughly the same
amount of people.
And, and if you've been elected
here multiple years, those
people
Believe in what you're trying to
do, so, uh.
I, I would love to see us get
back to that where we hear each
other.
And uh we come together with the
answer that benefits most people
and
And does the least amount of
harm.
Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Montoya. Representative Montoya,
with all due respect.
Verry said one thing that's
incorrect.

year, this, this 60 days.
I'm Debbie Serignon. I represent
House District 21 in Bernalillo
County. It's the Northeast
Southeast quadrant of
Albuquerque right next.
Representative Dixon, um, the
Mazano High School area, if you
know where that is. I come from
uh Air Force.
Computer programmer high school
math teacher, and I ended up
here in Energy 9 years ago, and,
and, and I've loved every, every
bit of it. It's a huge learning
process, but um this has been my
favorite committee for the last
9 years and next to this guy for
4 years, been really good.
Um, it has, it really has, um.
I, um, we have a lot of great,
we hear a lot of great bills, we
hear a lot of very, um,
interesting topics. It does get
heated a bit, um, there's a lot
of passion here, but um, I think
you'll enjoy this going on it
and uh like.
Senator Montoya said we just
listen to each other.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you and I'm representing
Matthew McQueen. I represent
House District 50, District 50
is the southern half of Santa Fe
County, uh, in the Placitas area
of Sandoval County.
This is my 11th year in the
legislature and that's how I
know San Montonio's been here 11
years because we came in
together. Uh, this is my 11th
year on this committee. Uh, this
was my first choice as a
freshman. I've always been on
this committee. This is my 9th
year chairing this committee.
Um, so it's a pleasure to be
here. Uh, I'm a lawyer by
training, uh, I have always had
an interest in natural resource
issues.
Uh, Representative Carrillo,
would you like to introduce
yourself?
Hey good morning
I apologize for being late. Uh,
I have the wrong time.
Um, Yanita Gurola.
Um, I'm a teacher as a, as a
main day job, a math teacher
mostly a bilingual teacher. This
is my 3rd year in the session.
I'm very honored to be in
energy, my first degree before
being a teacher's electronic
engineer many years before ILT
the technologies that we have
right now, so.
Everything is new for me, but
I'm excited to be here. I'm
enjoying to be here. I attended
most of the inner communities
that I could put energy, so.
It's exciting for me to be here.
I represent District 16, We
Albuquerque.
Part of the river too um so
thank you and nice being here.
Thank you.
OK, now I'd like to have the
staff, uh,
Um, introducing themselves,
we'll start with uh Jaden uh our
committee assistant is Nina
Regio, I think. Um, and she got
food poisoning last night, so
she's not with us today. Uh, so
we have Jaden, uh, who's a
voter, but please go ahead and
introduce yourself.
Hi, yes, I'm uh Jaden Casilla.
I'm the uh committee assistant
floater. Um, this is my first
time at the legislature, so
first session, and um you're
getting acquainted with the
place and uh meeting new faces
and it's nice to meet all of
you, and I, uh, look forward to
my role here and doing the best
that I can and uh
And um seeing, you know.
Representatives working for the
people.
OK, I think, I think that's
everyone the same one.
OK.
Um, so I'm just gonna go over
some of the sort of operational
things of the uh committee, um,
and the first thing I wanna talk
about are the mics, um, mics are
super sensitive.
Uh, so, uh,
If you don't turn on your mic.
You will not be heard on the
webcast, but you really need to
turn on when you're done, you
really need to turn off.
Uh, and if, if everyone could
help their neighbors, uh,
remember that, but they're also,
as I recall, they're really
sensitive to noises on the
table, on the desk.
So be careful about
Dropping things, shuffling
papers, things like that. Um,
they're just, they're really
touchy, and we had some.
Uh, incidents last year about
jumped down my seat there, the
feedback was so loud, um, so, so
that's first thing.
The 2nd, secondly, uh, I had a
good conversation with the
ranking member, uh, Rosa
Montoya.
Yesterday, about
The committee and I'm, I'm
optimist, uh, so in the past,
this committee has been a bit of
a grind.
Uh, we
Uh, we hear our bills. We took a
long time, and a lot of
Saturdays, like, you know,
pretty much all day Saturday,
uh, as a means of just like
getting through the agenda.
And
Like it, I feel like it's my
responsibility to give the bills
a hearing.
Um, and since.
Uh, we were taking a long time
on this bill, we started adding
meetings that we're clear it
Tuesday, Thursday committee and
we became a 3 day a week
committee because we just start
scheduling every Saturday.
Um
If we are efficient in the way
we address bills, we don't have
to do that.
Yeah, I'm not gonna um.
Pull you in here on a Saturday
if I don't have to.
Um, uh, we will not meet this
coming Saturday.
Um, you know,
At crunch time, you know, that
I'm not saying there won't be
Saturday meetings.
Um, you know, we'll just, we'll
just see how it goes, uh, for
again through the agendas and
and timely manner.
Um
That would be great. Uh, that
being said, you know, I
Invite you to to be Bills, um,
uh, ask questions, uh, you know,
get answers, um.
You know, I, I would encourage
you not to be redundant, not to,
uh, spend too much time
pontificating or specifying and
things like that. Uh, we're
careful not to attack each
other, uh, in our debate, um,
but, you know, I, I'm not saying
don't beat the bills. I'm just
saying let's be efficient. I
will say we have a um
I was telling her I told you
this we had in the interim
committee.
Our last
Uh, in our meeting in November,
we went over bills.
And it was, it was just really,
um, uh
Effective. People ask questions.
Uh, they expressed concerns, you
might want to look at this, you
might wanna um look at that.
Um, it was a little easier
because
Um, we weren't voting on the
bills.
So I guess that was a little
superficial in that sense, but
Um
Uh, it can be done.
Um
We do, uh, as all committees
would go through the chair.
Uh, and that's, uh, for new
people that might be a little
awkward. So if there's a witness
and you're asking questions, you
address me first or whoever,
whoever is chairing that day,
um, and that's kind of a weird
practice in the legislature, I
think, and yet it also is kind
of effective.
You know, in terms of, of
preventing
The, the back and forth from
sort of evolving, um, and so if,
so I asked you to do that, uh,
if you don't do that, I'll, I'll
remind you periodically.
Um, generally,
You know, I'm happy to recognize
it, anyone who wants to speak on
the bill, I'd rather not
recognize people twice on the
same bill just in the interest
of time and, and to avoid sort
of uh, you know, the tit for tat
back and forth.
Um, this is my prerogative to go
last on the bill?
So if I want to ask questions on
Bill or make a comment on Bill.
um, I will, I will typically
look to the committee and see if
anyone else wants to be on the
list.
We keep a list
Um, if I go ahead and make a
comment and then you want to be
recognized, you, you might not
get recognized at that point.
Just be aware of that.
Um, I do make mistakes.
Uh, I this is something, you
know, you do it a lot for 30
days or 60 days and you know,
don't do it for a year. I get
rusty, uh, one thing I typically
do is um.
We, we hear a presentation that
I immediately want to go to the
committee and I, I forget to go
to the public. Um, so if I'm
making a mistake, just let me
know, uh, I actually appreciate
that.
Uh, we do have, um, this uh
hybrid capacity.
So the public, we will take
public comments on bills.
We will take some from the
audience, we will take some
online.
Uh, depending on the nature of
the bill, um, we won't spend
hours and hours on public
comment.
So we want, if there are 50
people that want to talk to a
bill, um, we will.
I will pick a number, um, uh,
you know, a number of minutes.
And we will hear that many
minutes on each side.
Um, just because, just again the
interest of time.
Uh, the public comments can end
up being uh uh repetitive.
Uh, and I will set, will set
time limits on, um, you know,
each public commentary.
Um
Would you like to start on time,
uh, and I will start as soon as
we have a corum.
Um, so I encourage you to be
here. I think we'll typically
start at 8:30, uh, and if you
can be in your seat at 8:30,
that'd be great.
Um, bones. So we all have, we
all have phones, we all
communicate with our phones.
I don't have a problem with
that. We ask that you turn off
the little chirps and beeps and
things when you get a text.
Um, the ranking member last year
was Representative Scott,
Senator Scott now.
Uh, and his phone was just like
beeping nonstop.
Um, which, you know, I, I know
there's discussions going on
between the members, so, um,
that's fine.
Um, the, the
For the new people, you know, a
um a committee report uh lists
about.
And it lists um.
The number of people that voted
yes.
Who voted no.
Who was absent.
Uh, and who was excused.
Excuse meaning, obviously,
excuse absence. Um, a couple of
things about that. First,
Uh, I'm working on a rule change
to list the people who vote yes.
Cause right now we just list the
number. We don't list the names.
And I realized this because I
was going back and looking at
some bill that passed a couple
of years ago.
And if you don't know who's on
the committee, you don't know
who voted for the bill.
And I don't know why we ever
started doing it that way, but
that's been the practice, so
that's something we should
change.
Um
I am happy to show you as
excused.
If you, uh, you tell me.
You're not gonna be here.
I mean, I just, I just want you
to tell me or you, you know, for
the Republicans, you can tell
your ranking member and you can
tell me um if I don't know where
you are, I'll, I'll show you his
absent.
Um
People often have to be out of
the room.
Uh, we have other meetings, we
have other bills.
Um
A couple of things on that.
Certainly if you're out of the
room, uh, let me know and, and
that's excused.
Um, but also we've had a
practice in the past where we,
where I will not, uh, take a
vote.
If I think a temporary absence
will change the outcome of the
vote.
Like if we're missing a couple
of members, and I think that's
gonna um affect the outcome.
You know, we'll either hold off
on the boat or we'll hold the
boat open until those people can
come back in the room.
Um, that's for temporary
absences.
If you're out sick,
Um, we gotta just move forward,
that kind of thing.
Um, but that's just
Uh
can be a little hectic when
you're running around like maybe
you you gotta be over in the
Senate committee.
Um, I don't want that to
prejudice a bill one way or the
other.
And that's, yeah, I, I will do
that for both sides.
Um
Uh, conducted meetings. So, um,
We recognize we generally abide
by what we call the 24 hour
rule, uh, the 24 hour rule is
not a rule. It's a practice, uh,
and that is if you have a, an
amendment.
Or see, I touched the table,
hear that. If you have an
amendment um or a committee
said.
That you need to submit that 24
hours in advance.
Uh, and we'll send that out to
the committee.
Um
We will do amendments on the
fly, like if we're working on a
bill and you know we think of a
word is wrong or something needs
to be tweaked. If it's a minor
amendment, I'm OK doing that on
the fly. That doesn't have to be
submitted ahead of time.
Um, but otherwise, the 24 hour
rule will generally hold.
I, I'm being told our
Sound is going in and out, um.
One changed this year.
Uh, on the 24 hour rule, uh,
Representative Scott and I had
uh got a rule passed uh.
Couple years ago.
To publish those amendments and
publish those committee subs and
what was happening is you would
have.
Provision in the bill that was
controversial.
And you would have 100 people
lined up to talk.
And the sponsor's bill has
already taken it out.
And no one knew
And so you calling them talking
that that either complaining
about the provision that was no
longer in there or not know what
to say, um, and so the, the
rule which actually applies to
both chambers, although
Um, I'm not sure the senate is
enforcing it yet.
Um, says that, uh, committee
subs and amendments will be put
on the legislative website when
they're made available to the
committee.
And that when we're when they're
made available to the committee,
language is when they're emailed
out to the committee.
So those should be available 24
hours in advance, and that's um
There was some resistance to
that because
You might have an amendment
drafted and then not actually
offer it.
But, you know, that's, I think
that's OK.
Um, so that's, that's gonna be a
new rule, um for the entire
house. It should be for the
entire legislature, but we'll
see what happens.
Um, and I think that was all the
sort of procedural stuff I
wanted to cover. Does anyone
have any questions?
Represent Montoya.
Uh, yes, Mr. Chair, more, more
of a comment, and that is uh
Uh, Representative McQueen,
Chairman McQueen, and I have,
once again, we came in together.
Uh
Be surprising to a lot of folks
to, to know that uh as far as
the way we conduct business in
this building.
And
Um, just different views of, uh,
what, what, how good policy
policy should be made, we
generally agree.
Uh, we have, so the
conversations we have, even
though most of you, most of you
see the other conversations take
place in front of you, um,
Uh, good governance, uh, so I
appreciate.
Uh, that, uh, that
As chair, uh, that you don't.
You don't break your own rules,
and that's been something that,
that since I've been on this
committee, and I've appreciated.
Um, I would like to clarify one
thing though too for um your, as
I understand your policy on
speaking twice, generally it's.
Potentially, if there's time,
and if there, if it's not a
redundant question if it's a
new, maybe somebody brought
something up and it brings up
something new.
Generally, I've seen you allow
that. I also
So you give it usually with an
instruction, which is
Keep it short.
Uh
And I've also seen that as long
as we do that,
Um, that you generally allow for
a second question as long as we
are not.
Flagrantly violating that. So,
um, I am looking forward to
What
Potentially could be less
contention.
And maybe, I think, I think some
of the contention in the past
has closed ears.
Um, I think that if we are able
to
Here, I think a piece of
legislation can get better.
By more voices.
Uh, helping that legislation get
better. Um, some, a lot of times
it's we've I've seen in other
committees and even on the
floor, just resistance to what
is a good idea just because.
It wasn't brought by our team
and I think that.
I think, I think the public
really wants to see us.
Find a way
You get to the piece of
legislation we can and I think
having more
This is one place where I think
more cooks in the kitchen is
better than less.
And representing Montoya is
correct, um.
You know, if we're doing debate
and you've
Taking some time to ask some
questions, you think of
something, some question that
hasn't been answered.
Um
I, I generally, uh, if we're
doing OK on time, we'll
recognize you. I will ask you to
keep it brief and not open like.
A new round of questioning just
like you know some detail that
got admitted.
Um
We will have a committee dinner.
Uh, I was hoping to have some
possible dates for that today,
um, but with, with Nina's
absence, uh, we don't.
Um, we will be looking for
sponsors.
Um
