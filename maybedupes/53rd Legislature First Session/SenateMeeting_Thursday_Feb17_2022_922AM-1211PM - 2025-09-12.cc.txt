Bipartisan effort here.
What we don't know it wasn't so
beautiful before that I thought
there were people in here that
wanted to beat me with a stick
I'm sure there were people who
There were efforts from all
sides here there were efforts
from the house and the Senate.
From to put the Democrats and

out of that and I was so proud
of the way that we alternately

that I never voted with most you
all on a tax package ever in my
life.
And I thought it was beautiful
Came together hard negotiations

members who consistently tell me
no.
They know who they are.
So you know I say I want this.
And then they'll say well here's
the constitutional problem with
that or we don't have a place in
We have serious tax problems.
And so I try to figure this out.
And I came up with a two percent
system it really made a big
difference there.
And as we started that that's
when the first staff member
started to tell me no.
it wasn't just that they did
told me no they told me no but
have you thought about this or
no can you go that direction.
And that's what.
times I was told no.
But ultimately we figured it
out.
And I think that was largely due
to the staff.
the staff with Senate finance
committee.
They work hard to try to figure
out how to accomplish.
What we all wanted to accomplish
not just me.
beautiful bipartisan effort.
When it came to the floor.
But like most of the sausage
that's made when you're told no
This whole place couldn't run
without the staff.
So I want to make sure I thank
them.
But also yesterday in our tax
there we get some rebates to
people certainly we did some
things for our social security
recipients.
One of the things that that Mr
present I've been trying to do
We got that done last night.
We got that done.
And I know many people don't
think that this was an important
deal.

forty two forty three forty

They have plenty of life left in
them.
So my brother in law spent I
think it was twenty one years in
the U. S. marine corps.
But he was a communications guy.
That's what he did now every
Everyone's a rifleman first.
And then you do whatever else
they do they might work on
helicopters.
They Might Be doctors They Might
There's at least five other
soldiers sailors airmen behind
them.
Somebody has to take care of all
of the equipment and somebody
they all have skills just like
my brother in law.
Who is a communications guy for
twenty one years and when he
retired from the U. S. marine
corps.
But I promise you if you hadn't
had deep family roots if he'd
just been assigned here for us
last permanent duty station.
He would have left.
Deep family roots is the only
reason.
The state.
But with this bill that we
passed yesterday.
Now we can take all of those
folks.
That helps our economy.
Because all of a sudden all of
the other things that need the
skills.
Now come here because we have a
and then by us welcoming them.
When we welcome those people to
New Mexico we strength in New
Mexico.
And last night Mr president we
welcome to.
The service members who are here
in New Mexico today.
But for financial reasons they
chose they choose to leave.
But last night.
We also last night work with
the.
With the retirees national

These are folks that can go.
They stay.
Some of them go because they say
you know what I can I can take
my R. V. and register to vote in
But last night again in a very
very partisan way.
We invited the retirees to stay
not only retirees to stay.
diversifying our economy we talk
about.
Recreational efforts so you get.
People are on social security.
the union and I mean that
officer and sincerity New Mexico
is great.
And so now we have these
retirees that we've welcomed
into our family and you know
what they're gonna do Mister
president.
A bigger economy it most people
around the gives people jobs.
And it contributes to our tax
We need to do that yeah we did
some other things there we gave
some solar tax credits.
And we gave some sustainable
building credits and I. I
sincerely hope those things work
are out there now.
And hopefully that really helps.
We also gave a child tax credit.
about different things in the
world.
Helping.
Parents with children.
I think it's a valuable valuable
thing for us in New Mexico.
did in there we'd we did some

Any of these industries do.
The state of.
They look around and they see
Mexico before they even see the
beauty of New Mexicans.
They see the ugly of our taxes.
And it's not so much that our
may go holy cow.
What is in this big old book.
This is just an amazing Pyle.
diversifying our economy one of
the things we really really need
to do Mr president.
This figure out how to make our
tax code.
Attractive.
important one the one that
people wanted to be me what a
step over.
That was actually rebates to
people.
And I think this is one of the
this year.
Plus we had money from the
federal government in our book
which was a lot this year.
All that money came into our
coffers.
Taxpayer money and hand it back
to them.
Safe thank you for your efforts
to help us we love you here's
some of your money back.
And so you know all of those
things together.
Helped.
But we still have a tax problem.
But I'm saying oh my gosh what
if we're right.
The future is for the bold
letters be bold.
First it's kind of be simple.
Simple.
It's got to be simple enough for
me to understand.
we have now that we need her to
attorneys and her to CPA's and
herds of lobbyists to try to
figure out.
How to do business in New
Mexico.
To hiring attorneys mmhm
sometimes.
I'm certainly not opposed to
hiring CPA's the problem is when
these corporations in these
industries look at us they're
They might hire New Mexico
lobbyists or they might not.
Usually when they're hiring New
Mexico lobbyist it's just
All of that does not help us.
All of that that helped so more

holes in the cheese.
outside of this building can
understand and all of the folks
that are looking to re locate
businesses.
If it's simple enough they'll
take a second look.
have to Mr president.
Take care of public education.
That's part of our state
constitution not in every
constitution but that's also
Because there's just fairness in
it does the right thing for our
students.
Can we improve it certainly but
care of our health care systems
there's lots of things where
there is a legitimate use in in
in my libertarian point of view
there's a legitimate.
It needs to raise enough money.
And so no there's people jump
he's a Republican he just wants
to cut taxes.
No we need to raise enough
money.
Tax burden on Californians and
new Yorkers is crushing but in
New Mexico or tax burden isn't
that isn't that bad.
If you got the confusion out of
it.

We need to encourage people to
come here we need to encourage
new businesses and we don't
welcomes them we encourage them
because we have a system that is
simple.
The sea change just do a simple.
Enough.
An attractive and if we're ever
going to.
in states that are stable we
need industry that'll be here
when it's hot when it's cold.
We need industry that will be
here.
No matter what's going on in the
world economy.
We need we need industry that'll
be here level out our revenue
welcome them to our state
have the staff we have some of
the greatest staff in the world
here that can do that.
Between between legislative
finance committee.
works and Senate finance
committee.
I know if we sit down with them
and we talk things through and
we just all our ideas out on the
table.
Ideas going in our head.
Then we can find this tax
policy.
That is simple.
We can do that but we have to be
able to talk to each other.
And it's got to be bi partisan.
And and and and we need to let
In fact when I started I thought
gross receipts tax was the worst
thing that we could possibly do.
I spent years trying to figure
we fix our tax system and get to
like them.
But slowly I came to realize
that the gross receipts tax.
a two percent now I I readily
admit the two percent was just
snatched out of the year.
But after I started doing the
math of this is a pretty good
I moved from one position to
another I move from one position
to another in other areas.
And so Mister president if we
can get ourselves.
We really can have.
This whole system.
Where it's simple enough.
It raises enough money and it is
Then they get to look at New
Mexico.
And see what New Mexico really
is.
Thank you Mr president you've
heard this but maybe some of the
besides everything Mr president.
Everything is beautiful.
We have beautiful mountains we
You go to white sands and you
see that that beautiful sand out
there that beautiful beautiful
sand.
That's amazing you look at the
organ mountains.
mountain it's a forest.
Well.
The beauty of New Mexico is
beyond compare.
All of the volcanic mountains
that we have out there and just
looking at the at the geography
that we have where there's been
lifts over time tectonic listed
The power of the earth beneath
our feet.
Is amazing.
It's amazing and so if we can
get these corporations to just
This is heaven.
This is heaven.
If you want to go fishing we

The fishing there is amazing.
But then we have other places if
you want to go down into the

have places to hike they have
natural beauty.
I particularly like the
mountains around reserve.
Then we can go to the east side
of the state where we have all

The food basket of the world
Mister president.

Or actually.
We have to have that one

there's so much part of New
Mexico.
down immediately when they start
looking but we fix that with
Garcia change.
And then we come into the beauty
of New Mexico proper the land.
Mexicans are a unique people.
We can start thousands of years
ago.
With the people that were here
Then I look at those pueblos
today.
In all.
In absolute all.
How did they build.
But they build something
amazing.
In the bills that without going
to U. N. M..
And it's amazing.
But not only is the structures
themselves amazing and still
standing after all of these deck
after all these centuries.
that we are just now seeing.
The brilliance that was put into
that.
Is amazing you Mr president we
are just now finding out.
Efforts
health things have lined up.
With the stars.
How things have lined up with
They were lined up with this.
Every day for centuries and we
don't know why.
Mexico this is where it
happened.
Right here we standing is part
of that.
These structures amaze me.
And you know when we when we if
you go to taco canyon Mr
president.
are lined up window after window
after window.
How did somebody do that.
With no old.
Bipartisan love is beautiful.
So we.
So what we can do here is when
we look at all of that we go
while today that is part of New
Then we think what happened so
then you have the Spanish that
came through.
And yes we can talk about the
fights in the battles in in the
the pueblo revolt right here.
humans have a tendency to be
ugly to each other.
Even the pueblos tribes and
nations.
They were here before any
European.
They set out into an unknown
world to them they had no idea
where they were going.
And they walked in they hiked
and explored and they searched.
there's a lot of that heritage
in what we do.
A lot of that.
And that really became part of
I am proud that that that both
the pueblos and the tribes in
the nation's.
Or in my heart as well as those
Interesting Mister president.
So then we think that the the
third stage was was what at the
time were called north
Americans.
They were immigrants from all
over the world.
In the American army they came
here under general Kearney.
And they were touch Nover
Belgians.
But they're also.
Middle easterners.
And you know what Mr president
general Kearney showed up here.
When he showed up here in Santa
Fe.
no fight was because the people
that were here had already done
trading they were already
friends and some of them were
already relatives with what was
known then as the north
And while the Mexican government
was trying to consolidate this
huge mass of land mass that they
had.
They were struggling with the
bureaucracy of making that
we were already family.
We were all ready family.
The Santa Fe Trail which is the
name of the road goes right by
The Spaniards would become
Mexicans were here and they were
already related to the north
Americans that came here.
So when we say.
That's what it was because we
were already family.
Now can we point to to two
things again absolutely because
well humans humans are like
that.
Mexico the best state in the
union.
Because.
We became family slowly over a
couple hundred years.
more peaceful the entire world
would be if we could figure out
how to sell the idea.
That we.
Our family.
Can see the beauty of the
landscape.
And then see.
The people of New Mexico.
But then New Mexico continue to
grow now it was part of the
union.
Not officially we want our
state.
And right here in New Mexico we
were a major part of that almost

New Mexicans once again stepped
up.

sometimes.
We would be the richest state in
the union as well.
The most diverse state.
You Mr president when when
general Kearney showed up here
and in Santa Fe since I'm still
talking about taxes because
taxes are what this is all about
today.
The tax code for here and I
forgot to bring it today Mr
president because I really
wasn't prepared to to take this
this time on the on New Mexico
history.
But his tax code.
Twenty one census.
That was the tax code for New
Mexico.
That was kind of interesting he
would tax.

little bit more tax if you were

Thank you fifteen.
own tax code.
That's amazing that's totally
amazing.
And so then Mr president.
When we built our own tax code.
What tax collectors we're not
allowed to do.
Now that tax code didn't last
very long.
It was almost pure property tax.
And it was quite different than
the way we work things today.
And so they would proportionally
send that to the various
counties and say okay County
eight you owe twenty dollars
County be you a hundred.
Can you see you all three
hundred.
But then the depression came.
And people literally were
selling their property because
they couldn't pay the property
tax.
various people we started to
monkey around with it until we
come up with this this tax
system that nobody understands
and why we cannot diversify our
Terrible.
It compare all of that to last
night when we had a bipartisan
unanimous tax package.
tax package Mr president can we
do that again can we go out
there and can we look at history
can we view the various cultures
that we have.
Right that includes real tax
reform real tax reform that's
what we need.
Real tax reform is the key to
everything else we have to do
here.
thinking a total see change.
I hope we can do that Mr present
I hope that we can sit down.
Really and economists in.
Because you know Mr president we
also have some of the smartest
economists in the world.
The difference is when the staff
continues to tell me no.
I listen.
Try to fix it.
As we all did yesterday.
And we need the people in the
world not to get all weird it
out when somebody throws out a
weird idea.
That sparks another idea until
we come to the right solution.
So when we have people in the
press for on Twitter or whatever
we're doing there you got to
And allow those sparks of
imagination to kick in allow
those sparks of imagination to
figure out the tax code that is
It would be amazing.
It would be amazing.
But that means allowing
ourselves that includes all.
Because it's that ingenuity that
we have been suppressing the
ingenuity that has been here
since the tacos bills.
That long ago we have had these
beautiful sparks.
With the smartest people than
and the smartest people now.

feel bad about not not focusing
a little bit more.
On on one of the things that we
really neglected yesterday and

For the local communities.
In in in in that really saddens
me that saddens me so much Mr

If we cannot help our cities and
towns we cannot help the state.
We've got to figure that out
that has to be part of the broad
feel bad that we did not include
Senator Kernan says.
Senator currents plan and all of
that.
Last night even though was a
brilliant bill because we missed
one little thing.
We just missed it.
with just one little tiny tweak.
Could have been so much better.
We talk about diversifying our
economy.
Yeah we also got to work on
regulations because sometimes
our regulators get little hand.
They'll need to do well.
But they're not thinking about
the economy the thinking about
that balance.
And so we need to work on our
taxes we need to work on a

I don't think we particularly

environment how we're gonna do
them for the environment.
I think in in in many misguided
ways Mister president.
We have harmed ourselves.
We do not manage them properly.
And what I mean by management.
Isn't clear cutting forests we
don't want to do that.
Are forced should have tall
majestic trees.
And other trees that are along
the way.
And then the grass is down
below.
And the grass and get down into
what I have been calling the
great water tank which is the
mountain.
We're doing bad things to the
forced.
Terrible things to the forced
because now it's so overgrown
with all of the brush down
there.
the big trees in the little
trees and scrub that's down
there.
To absorb that water because.
Those plants are thirsty.
And then there.
sometimes through nature you
have a forest fire that would
start and it didn't blow out of
control because it was only
burning a little bit of scrub on
the bottom and the big majestic
trees stood.
because we don't do that the
other thing Mr president which I
find interesting.
Is the people that lived here.
Intentionally burned sometimes.

Feed the majestic trees water
the grass and fill.
The giant water tank.
affecting us right now when we
talk about empty rivers and
empty lakes and we cannot feed
our families because this thank
you Sir try.
That doesn't cost tax money.
But we can deal with tax money
but we'll do it poorly because
we don't have enough folks to do
it for one thing.
We could clear out all of that
underbrush we could make it the
way nature intended to.
But when you have all that brush
right now.
and grasses that are there.
What all of that happens.
It's so overgrown.
The small fires of the past are
now consumed.
By the colossal.
Fires of now.

But they can't be the primary

Let's talk about where solar

Because I think we could come to
an agreement in here just like
we did last night in a very
bipartisan way I think we can
find that path because we are
New Mexicans.
But I would like to point out a
couple of things here.
That that have bugged me for a
while.
What are rules look like.
America understands baseball now
they might not know all of the
nuances of baseball.
But they understand safer now
Now they may not be able to wipe
the rules of baseball.
But they clearly can go out
there in the field all these ten
year olds.
what a home run is they know
what fair and fell as they know
what strikes and balls are they
know what's safe and out is they
know that and that's really the
way our government is supposed
to work right now.
nation is about the same size as
the rule book for any time.
Of baseball league it's about
the same size.
So.
Mr.
It doesn't matter what league
we're talking about any late
we're talking about.
They'll have a couple of things
up the you'll see what the rules
are you going to have.
Are you gonna have things that
are you going to measure the
basis based on the the size of
the players that have sixty foot
between the bases are ninety
Then they'll be some kind of
executive to make sure things
happen you know just kind of run
the day to day kind of stuff
make sure that all of the things
and strikes in the safe and out
you have them on the field you
Mr president if we think about
that the original rule book of
the nation and we book of Major
League Baseball team.
And that's.
That's how we set up
our government here in the state
of New Mexico and that's the way
it ought to be.
And the governing body don't
have anything to do with
individual games they set it up
so the games can be fair.
It's the umpires to make sure
I want to tell you the story Mr
president about this particular
game completely shocked me.
Well everybody knows that three
strikes you're out.
Every ten year old knows that.
But in this particular but came.
There are already two out.
knows what's supposed to go on
because everybody knows three
structural three outs in the
inning so the team that's in the
field is ready to go into a team
that's in the dugouts ready go
out the number goes no no no no
Doesn't matter if the umpire had
a great reason to do that or if
he was drunk it doesn't matter
why.
three strikes you're out three
three outs in the inning it's
right here in the rule book we
don't have to go over every ten
year old in America knows that
what are you doing.
So what are you going to do I
mean the umpires there on the
field to make things happen.
What are the coach is going to
do one of the players going to
do.
Well they're going to play ball
It doesn't matter whether the
fourth strike meant anything or
not.
Could be called out then doesn't
matter whatever happened
happened.
Go to the governing body they go
to the executive they're jumping
up and down and rant and rave
and probably flowing hands
around.
Is the executive says you don't
have any authority over that.
That's not my that's not what I
do this no one there.
So I go to the governing body.
should do that we should give
the empire that that leeway all
the time.
Third of the body does not all
three strikes you're out it's in
And of course to make anything
happen.
You have to have a majority of
votes.
Nothing happens because nobody
Some people are calling empires
crazy some people think this
right.
But they keep on playing the
game.
So now with that.
knows exactly what she's looking
for.
Exactly where he wanted.
So the first one comes across
the plate he knows is going to
be called a strike you can see
he's got a great all right but
Again he knows what he wants.
He knows the next page coming
down is again not the pitch he
wants but it's okay to get
What strikes.
The coach comes running out.
Three strikes what do you do an
empire.
Days ago on prior calls said you
could have for.
Today I'm doing to for this
matter.
So again it doesn't matter why
Anything to do with the games
that matter for change the
outcome of the game or not.
It's now set.
The umpire gets to decide every
to swing away when you go to
move the infield in.
You don't.
All of the things that every ten
year old also while the window.
go to the governing body the
governing body doesn't know what
to do they can't figure it out.
So there we are you got to keep
playing ball because that's what
they do.
But something happened.
Now.
Well all of this is going on.
But different things starts to
brew.
you they're up there and they
say you know what we need a
break we need something to help
us stay open because people
aren't buying enough stuff.
And we won't be able to stay
Decided the only way to keep the
concessionaires there.
Is to make everybody by a twenty
dollar hot dog when they come in
the stadium.
what they really want freedom hi
on hot dogs.
Especially a twenty dollar hot
dog because you can bring your
own hot dogs for just a few
cents.
But the governing body since
hot dog before you can go sit
down.
And so there's some people crazy
they're going what is going on
here the concessionaires of
course love it because now
they're making money.
It's important to important for
the game.
Nobody understands what's going
on there the people on the field
don't care if there's a twenty
dollar hot dog thing going on
But then one day.
Very interesting.
The manager of one team to team
they go up to the to the home
plate umpire they're turning in
We're here to play baseball not
a hot dog.
Part of baseball.
Specially twenty dollar hot dog
People are going to be all
upset.
But you can't play without hot
dogs so they go by hot dogs for
everybody they buy hot dogs for
has a hot dog couple hundred
dollars hot dogs.
Now they can play ball.
What's the what's the I'm part
there the the the citizens that
are sitting in the stands the
the the the.
The people are there to watch
baseball.
They're confused.
But.
Something interesting happens.
There's a spot right out in
front of first base gets a lot
of traffic right there by first
say Hey we need to get that
fixed they go to the to the
executive so we need to fix this
we need to fix it now.
So the governing body then.
So the infield protection
Association they go out there in
a fixed at that spot they do a
great job it's beautiful the
grant is beautiful.
Everything works.
And after the infield protection
agency finishes their job
are to strike Sir I strikes is
out there they finally got
something right the infield
protection agency has done
something good.
But then.
There's a shot out to the center
field the runners shooting for
third base.
Just a Haaland.
There's a throw from the
outfield to third base it's
An empire calls about.
Everybody saw he safe.
In person yeah he beats tech
though that one problem the
problem was the in field
Do you feel protection agency
doesn't want people destroy in
the field.
People are up in arms again wait
because somebody wiped out the
white line as he slid around
third base and grabbed onto it.
The way baseball yes.
That's not to say for now.
But the infield protection
agency has written a rule
because the governing body told
them right rules.
They don't know what's going on
with the white lines.
One of the one of the coolest
place in baseball it's very
rare.
baseman you have the wrong or
all converging right there at
home plate.
Everybody is wiping out the
white lines.
Everybody's right there the
there he slid in.
And he was called out.
One of the plays that make.
Baseball truly exciting.
It's a great way and so people
go to the governing.
Body again is what you can't do
this you have to do you have to
right in the infield protection
agency they can't just be crazy
know we spent an awful lot of
money on those white lines.
It's probably fiscally
responsible for us.
To try to maintain those white
that's not baseball the white
lives don't matter in baseball
to that level so now we have
this twenty dollar hot dog thing
was there to fix the in field.
Not create hazards to the game.
They weren't there to stop the
game they were just there to
help the game.
else so here's what happens
next.
People stop coming to the game.
What if people stop coming to
the game because they don't want
to pay for a twenty dollar hot
So as people could come into the
game.
There's a new set of people out
there we don't know who these
people are because they clearly
There's a pop flights going out
to left field near the near the
foul line switch near the near
the spectators.
What's going on.
Well it turns out that these
people or people for eating
tasteless food and they do not
kind of tasteless recycle
cardboard or something but still
have to pay twenty dollars for.
Well.
Things have just really really
They don't like the idea that
people are called out for
stepping on a white line that's
irrelevant.
It's so confusing.
We get the governing body all
together they talk about it they
brainstorm and decide let's
raise ticket prices because we
have to have enough money.
You Mr president I fear that is
what we have done to ourselves.
What we have done to ourselves
is we have moved ourselves.
And in an effort to change
things for the better I admit
that with all the changes we've
somebody thought were for the
better.
All of these things for the
better suddenly destroyed the
What we really need.
This for some guard rails.
The umpires need to know that
they don't get to decide.
That's what I was trying to do
had nothing to do with the bill
itself voted for the bill.
I was always gonna vote for the
bill.
Our authority.
And our purpose to judge.
Just like the empire the decided
to call the game differently.
But that was the deal.
How are we ever going to get
ourselves back in the game when
we don't know.
How many strikes it takes to get
gotten all up in our way we
can't tell anymore.
And when we want to diversify
our economy.
The ball players that are
the rules of the game a little
again we're not going there we
don't play that stadium.
They're crazy and so they don't
they don't come here.
And then come here.

they did a good job.
Until they went too far.
Most empires just want to be on
Sometimes we give breaks to
organizations.
That we think are going to help
us.
Just like this weird baseball
story I told.
This baseball stories happening
right here in New Mexico right
now.
about.
A variety of electric vehicles
and how we're going to do that
and how we're going to give
people breaks to buy new
electric vehicles we've done all
that kind of thing and I know
Well again if we would just open
up we would see.
That there are some important
things here if we're going to
replace all of our internal

We need more but we're going out

plants instead of trying to make
those power plants battery

This doesn't have to be counter

come together.
We need it all.
We need oil we need gas we need

That's a big move to how long it

Otherwise would be able to keep
those vehicles on the road they
just won't be able to go
anywhere.
Because we need power.
In that bipartisan effort that
we had last night and let's talk
about these things.
Let's talk about how we fill up
the water tank let's talk about
how we have enough.
Because we know.
Our own power company has told
us they do not have enough
power.
And yet somehow we can't seem to
broaden our font we can't have
that that brilliant spark on how
we fix it.
There are lots of things that we
can do there are lots of ways
that we can make them happen.
But for some reason we get in

In a manner that's peaceful and

In a manner that's respectful to
