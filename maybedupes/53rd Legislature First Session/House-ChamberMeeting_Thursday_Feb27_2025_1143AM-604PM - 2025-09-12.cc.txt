that? OK, very good, um.
It's my honor to welcome my
guests who who are also my
constituents and friends, um,
for Hidalgo County Day, um, I'm
so pleased to recognize and
honor what I believe is one of
the most remarkable places in
our great state. Hidalgo County
sits in the far southwest corner
of New Mexico, a rugged and
breathtaking landscape where the
sky meets the mountains. we have
the sunniest skies by day and
the brightest stars at night. It
is a place for explorers and
adventurers.
Paradise for hunters, hikers,
and anyone who appreciates the
great outdoors. Some of my own
most challenging and rewarding
hikes have been on the
continental Divide Trail, which
terminates down in the boot heel
of Hidalgo County, but beyond
this natural beauty, Hidalgo
County is a place of both
history and innovation exploring
Hidalgo County, you'll find
ghost towns that whisper stories
of the past.
And cutting edge technology
shaping the future at New Mexico
Tech Research and techno uh and
training facility. Hidalgo
County is home to New Mexico's
only geothermal power plant
providing clean dispatchable
energy around the clock.
It's a hub of agricultural
ranching and tourism where
traditions run deep and yet
progress never stands still.
But with all that said, what
truly makes Hidalgo County
special, isn't just the land, it
is without a doubt the people
resilient, independent, and
resourceful, the people of
Hidalgo County embody that
pioneer spirit that built the
West.
There are problem solvers.
Innovators and hardworking
individuals who think outside
the box as evidenced by this
morning and our trip so far.
They cherish family tradition,
and freedom. They honor their
veterans, never forgetting the
sacrifices made for our nation.
And the values they hold dear.
They're young people who are in
our gallery right now are
prepared, they're bright and
they're engaged, they're
actively reaching out to
legislators and working to
preserve our rural way of life.
In Hidalgo County neighbors
still look out for one another
and a handshake still means
something. So today as we
celebrate Hidalgo County here in
the house, let us not only
acknowledge its beauty and
potential but also recognize the
character of its people. So to
all of you who traveled from
Hidalgo County to be here today
again, welcome. It's my honor to
represent you and I look forward
to working alongside you to
ensure that Hidalgo County
thrives for generations to come.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Welcome
to the house.

about 3100 miles. It ends right
there near Animus and and goes
all the way up to Canada so I
got a quick story to tell you
about that, Mr. Speaker, on the
way up, one time I was I was
having a funeral in in
Lordsburg.
I'm leaving and I'm driving the
hearse and as I'm driving up
there's a spot there that this
guy has to get off. He's walking
up the trail and he gets up on
the highway because there's just
no water, so he, he's looking
for a ride. Well, I stopped in
the hearse.
And
you can imagine that guy's face
and not loaded, by the way, Mr.
Speaker, all of our, just to let
you know there was no one in
there except for myself uh
because we had already had the
funeral and the guy was very
surprised to get a ride for me

The New Mexico Philharmonic is
the state's largest professional
classical symphony orchestra and

Second only to the Santa Fe

classical music organization in
New Mexico performing for 40,000

It is also an important economic
driver as a key cultural asset
that helps to create the quality
of life that attracts and keeps
businesses and individuals in
the community.
Um, Mr. Speaker, it is my
distinct honor, and I would like
to introduce our guests who are
sitting right over here to my

meet a lot of these wonderful
individuals and, and uh here
their stories and how they maybe

Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker,
and I think you have one more
announcement for me. I do as
part of this celebration, we
also have in the gallery, please
rise to be recognized. The young
musicians initiative. Welcome to
the house.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Gently from Donana Socorro
Valenz, uh, no, sorry.
Donana Sierra Socorro
Representative down. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to
rise and add on to the
celebration of Hidalgo Day, uh,
for 6 years, I was a
representative and for those of
you in metropolitan areas, that
my last precinct in Verdon, New
Mexico. Hidalgo in the gallery
there is 4 hours from my house.
So I would get over there and
try to, you know, knock as many
doors as I could. These are
agriculture producers, they work
in the mines, they
farm and ranch mostly and um so
it's, it's a beautiful community
and I would go to the door and
they wouldn't let me leave
without giving me a drink and a
watermelon.
And the next place they'd give
me a pumpkin, and the next place
they'd give me jam and pies and
cookies. So I got home my first
trip from Hidalgo, and my
husband goes, Did you stop at
the farmers' market? I was like,
I was just, I was painting
inverted.
It is a it is a beautiful
community. They are so family
focused, and one of the things
that I think is really unique,
uh, especially about Verdon,
they're on the border of
Arizona, like you can put 1 ft
in New Mexico, 1 ft in Arizona,
and we have worked out through
the Department of Public
Education, it's an hour, it's an
hour to Lordsburg School
District and it's an hour and a
half to Animas. So those, those
students attend Duncan, Arizona
school, and we, we, uh, transfer
the dollars to Arizona so that
those kids can, can go to school
where they.
work and live and play and have
church and community, which I
think is a beautiful thing.
Every school district in uh in
Hidalgo is on a 4 day school
week and so I think um we like
to have affordable, reliable
food on the table, and they do a
great job of it. They have a lot
of adversities. There are border
county, but they are, it's a
special kind of faith and a
special kind of family.
That tills that ground and
plants the seed and puts up with
the adversity they do, they
don't know what the weather's
gonna be. They don't know if
their families are safe from day
to day and they had a smile on
their face and hostility,
hostility, I mean.
al ity in their heart for
everyone they meet and it's,
it's, it was such an honor and
it's great to see friends uh
that, that.
Welcome to the house once again.
Good people of Hidalgo County.
I'll go, you guys know where
that word comes from. I'll go
Miguel Hidalgo heosilla was
actually the, the, the father of
Mexican independence. He was a
priest turned independence
fighter, Miguel Hidalgo. There's
a state too in Mexico, um,
Hidalgo state, um, so I wonder
if Hidalgo County comes from
that same.
Same name, um, all right,
Ruanates, lady from Berillo
Sandoval, you're gonna have to
help me, so I'm trying to figure
out how to say.
The word I think it's, I wanna

I feel very dumb.
Mr. Speaker.
Thank you. Uh, could you, uh,

special guests in the gallery,

not that clever, Mr. Speaker.

texted me the following Hidalgo
County was formed from Grant
County in 1919.

Lordsburg, it was named in honor
of Miguel Dolores Hidalgo, who

1810 which eventually led to its
independence from Spain.
The county towns are Verdon,
Lordsburg, Cotton City, Animas,
and Rodeo.

canceling that day, but today

Mr. Speaker, I move we go to

See, no objection. It is so

Gentle lady from Bern Leo, are
you ready on item number 10.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, um, let
the record reflect that all
action necessary for replacing
House Bill 111 on final passage
has been taken, and it is now
subject to debate, amendment or
substitution generally to
explain the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Um, I do have some experts that
are being brought in, um, but if
that's fine you can take your
time if you wanna start
explaining the bill while your
experts make their way, I will
do that.
Um, HB.
Excuse me, HB 111 arises out of
a water main explosion on a
street in Albuquerque that was
adjacent to the home of Rose
Romero.
Rose is blind and for 11 years
was helped by her faithful
seeing eye dog Ivy.
After the explosion, Rose was
desperately trying to find Ivy
telling the first responders
that her service dog was
missing.
It took 11 days before Ivy was
found dead in the garage of her
home.
The federal ADA and other laws
recognize that service animals
are not pets but are trained to
perform a set of tasks that
provides independence to
individuals with a disability.
HB 111 recognizes the special
status of service to animals and
a man's New Mexico's existing
service Animal Act to provide
guidelines for first responders
when aware that a service animal
is at the scene.
And my experts today.
Give me just a moment to move
the chair.
My experts today are Rose
Romero.
And Bree Pritchard.
Uh, Bree is with service dogs of
New Mexico and Rose Romero is
the lady who um
who worked with Ivy for 11 years
and uh once she began to lose
her eyesight, uh, she became a.
She worked as a school
disability coordinator with
other people who had
disabilities, um, and I would
also note that today is service
dog Day at the Roundhouse and
with that I stand for questions.
There is debate, gentleman from
Creed, debaca, Guadalupe,
Roosevelt, and San Miguel,
Representative Samora.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well,
the gentle lady yield.
Uh, I yield to the gentleman
from
Clovis, that's not counting.
Thank you. Thank you, gentle
lady, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
Curry, Curry is, is close and,
and there's some other counties
in there. My district's pretty
big gentle lady.
So gentle lady, we heard this
bill in committee.
And my concerns were.
About the, the duties that were
placing on the first responders.
As, as you probably remember the
debate in committee, uh, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Uh
I think there's, there's a few
things that will have to be
fixed.
Or worked on as this bill moves.
Forward and, and part of it is.
On how
How a first responder, I, I
believe if those first
responders there that day would
have known.
That the dog
Should have been attached to the
owner.
They, they
Things might have worked out
different, uh, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, do you agree on
that?
Uh
Yeah
Um
I
In this case, uh,
Representative
Um, generally, I'm sorry,
gentleman from Curry County. In
this case, uh.
The notice was there, uh,
Roseman told them.
When they arrived, did she had a
service dog, and in many cases
that's exactly what will happen
is that someone at the scene
will advise someone that there
is a service dog present and
then in addition, and I'll ask
uh my understanding from my
expert uh with service dogs in
New Mexico is that there is a
911 let me get the information
correct.
There's a, uh, system in the
state in which if you have a
service dog, you can register
that on the 911 numbers and
whenever there's an emergency
that comes in that that system
is accessed and the res and the
information goes immediately to
the first responders.
And, and Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, that's exactly what I
wanted to tag on.
Is, is we need those systems in
place.
Because if, if the patient that
gets picked up isn't responsive
or something, you know, we can't
hold the first responsers the
res uh.
Uh, libel.
For
For this, for this, uh.
Animal because, because it
doesn't just.
Involve dogs. Am I correct,
gentle lady, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
Uh
Uh, gentlemen, it, uh
From Curry County it uh the only
official service dogs or I'm
sorry, service dogs, service
animals in in New Mexico under
the uh service animalal Act are
dogs and miniature ponies.
Miniature horses.
And, and Mr. Speaker, and, and,
and gentle lady.
I think that's interesting,
interesting for the public to
hear because before we ever
heard this bill in committee, I
wasn't aware that the, the
miniature ponies were involved
in that.
And Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
I guess there's, there's certain
criteria that a horse has to
meet.
To, to be considered a miniature
pony, is that correct, gentle
lady?
Um
Gentlemen, um.
I assume that the uh the act
does have some definition of
that and I would assume that in
the world of miniature ponies
there is criteria for the type
of animal that fits that.
And Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
when, when you, when you were
working on this bill and, and
with your constituents.
How was, how was the amount of
time.
That it will be taken up.
Mm
Of the first responders.
How was, was that considered
into the drafting of this bill
and, and, and trying to solve
this, the, the problem, gentle
lady.
Gentlemen, uh, the bill was
drafted to make it so it would
not be um would not delay their
work. I would like to read what
the criteria are.
Um
It's very specific.
Um
So what it requires is that.
Let me grab the right.
piece of paper here if a first
responder at an emergency
situation is made aware.
First of all, they have to be
made aware that an owner,
trainer or handlers qualified
service animal is missing.
Then what happens is the first
responder.
To the extent practicable and
while prioritizing human safety
and security shall make a
reasonable effort to search for
the qualified service animal.
So it requires knowledge.
That the that the uh uh first
responder have knowledge. It
requires that what they that to
the extent it's practicable and
they always prioritize human
safety, so it's a guideline and
as we live in a world of
increasing number of fires and,
and, and terrible things
happening in the world because
of climate change and other
causes, uh, it's just a
guideline that says humans
first.
Animals 2nd.
And that's all this does and
makes it.
So that it's practicable and
human life is always first. And,
and Mr. Speaker and gentle lady
and, and that's I, I like that
about the bill.
But, but in a sense.
I can see where it doesn't put a
whole lot of teeth into, into
what we're.
Into
I believe what you're trying to
do here.
But, but I do like Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady.
That it that it's written this
way and, and I'll tell you why
gentle lady and, and Mr.
Speaker, is because
I believe
That our first responder
responders primary duty.
Is
to, to get that patient taken
care of, looked at, taken care
of, get him to the hospital or
whatever needs to be done with
the patient.
But I don't want to take up the
first responders' time.
In looking
For a dog,
That may be
Maybe, uh,
Could be attended by by some
other people, maybe family
members or something. My
concerns are, are the first
responders need to take care of
their job.
And, and they're in an emergency
situation to get a patient to
the hospital.
Or, or to go to another scene
and I don't want that.
To be affected in any way.
By this bill.
And, and, and I look
I look forward to supporting
your bill. I just wanted to
state my concerns.
On the House floor
And, and
That we don't tie first
responders.
To something
That, uh,
Make could be taken care of in a
different in a different manner,
um, Mr. Mr. Speaker and, and
gentle lady, would you like to
respond to that?
Uh, yes, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, um,
We didn't want that either and
that's why we put in the
language about
It being practical and we put in
the language about human life
always being first and in
addition.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Um, no first responders oppose
this bill at any point during
its passage, um, I talked
specifically with the fire
department representative, uh,
they didn't have a problem with
the bill.
They are, they appreciate, uh, I
don't want to put words in their
mouth, but Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, they appreciate
having some guidance.
As to
How, what
How to decide priorities in this
kind of a situation and that's
all we're doing.
Is we're giving a priority, not
the first priority, but the 2nd
priority to service animals. Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
I, I really appreciate your
bill. I look forward to
supporting it. I just wanted my
concerns heard on the, on the
House floor and on the record
that.
And, and hopefully and, and.
That we don't come back in a few
years and say, first responders
shouldn't be, uh,
Held to this because they, their
duties are
are of more importance with the
human.
Uh, part of it and, but, but I
can see the needs of the service
dogs and, and, and the
attachment to their, to their
owners.
And I look forward to supporting
your bill and, and, uh, see how
everything moves forward with
it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
thank you, gentle lady.
There is further debate. The
gentleman from Lincoln and Otero
Representative Vincent.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
yield?
Uh, yes, so you know.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
what, what certifies or what
qualifies an animal to be a
service animal.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, um,
it's defined in the service.
Animal Act.
Which is existing law in New
Mexico.
And if you give me just a second
here, I can read that to you.
Um
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
qualified service, there's two
animals that qualify, qualified
service dog and qualified
service miniature horse and the
definition is it means does not
include a pet.
does not include an emotional
support animal, a comfort animal
or a therapy animal.
And Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, a
qualified service dog means a
dog that has been trained or is
being trained to work or perform
tasks for the benefit of an
individual with a disability who
has a physical or mental
impairment that substantially
limits one or more major life
activities.
And uh Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
the qualified service miniature
horse, um.
And
tracks that same definition.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you, gentle lady from Bernna
Leo.
As a former first responder, I'm
just wondering why something,
why we have to have legislation
for this because I can't imagine
especially listening to your
testimony.
That a first responder would
have a problem trying to find
A service animal anyways.
Uh
Mr.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh, we
didn't go through all the
details of what happened at Mr.
Romero's house that day. It was
certainly an emergency
situation, uh, she made them,
uh, made the first responders
aware that I first of all that
she was, she was blind, uh, that
Ivy was her service dog, um, she
told them, uh, that, uh, Ivy was
most likely in the garage and
asked them to
Cut some holes to see if
determine where Ivy was and um
they initially refused and then
they cut a couple of small
holes, and she said, well, you
know, that's not big enough,
we're not going to be able to
tell and they would do nothing
else.
That shouldn't have happened.
Um, and it was, as I say, it was
11 days.
Before
There was uh
Before the dog was found in the
garage.
Uh, and there's no reason that
should have taken 11 days.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you, gentle lady from Bernna
Leo, and I agree with that.
If I'm a first responder and I
and I have an emergency and I go
to the house. How, how do I know
that that's a service animal,
and I, you know, just being in
the public, I see that if you
put a vest on your dog and put
service animal. A lot of times
they don't even check to see if
it is a certified.
Animal
So if I'm a first responder,
How do I know that that's a
legit service animal.
Uh,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
because
When someone who is obviously
blind carrying a white cane
tells you that they have a
service animal that is helping
them with their vision, uh, I, I
think that you would be pretty
safe in assuming that that was
correct information.
I agree with that gentle lady,
Mr. Speaker.
What are other people that don't
have a white cane that will have
service animals.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, the
statute applies to service dogs
and service miniature horses,
and that's all it applies to.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. What I'm
asking you, gentle lady, is how
are you going to prove that that
is a service animal, do they
have a license? Do they have a
certificate? How do I know that,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, let me
ask my expert.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh, it
is actually a crime in New
Mexico under the act to
represent a that your animal is
a qualified service animal if it
is not, and they would be if
that occurred, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, they would be
violating the law.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady from
Bern Leo, so there's no proof if
I'm a first responder, that that
is a legitimate certified
service animal.
Mr.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I don't
think that's what I said at all,
and I think it's a little far
fetched to expect it to assume
that if somebody tells you,
somebody who has an obvious
disability, for example, tells
you that their service dog that
they've had for 11 years is
missing in the middle of an
emergency situation that you
should necessarily assume that
they are lying to you.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, I,
I would say that's false. I've
been to houses, and I mean
that's the first thing that we
do if, if there's a house on
fire or whatever may be, and
somebody tells us that they have
a pet in there, of course, we're
gonna try to go in there and
find it, but now we have
legislation and anyone can say
anything. Would you agree with
that?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
A service animal is not a pet
and the people are telling you
they have pets, and that is not
going to be a service animal.
Because service animals play a
much bigger role than that. They
are service animals.
And that's how people who have
them referred to them seeing eye
dog or whatever the particular
characteristic will be.
Um,
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you, gentle lady. Moving on, are
there penalties assessed.
If a first responder does not
Assist in finding the pet.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, there
are no penalties.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, gentle lady.
Seeing no further debate
generally to close.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, um.
Let's see.
Yeah, I moved that House Bill
111.
Be now passed.
We are on final passage of House
What about clothes?
Did everybody get a chance to
vote?
The vote is now closed by a vote
of 59 in the affirmative, 8 in
the negative. House Bill 111 has
duly passed this House.
Gentlemen from
Sandoval and Santa Fe McQueen.
Are you ready on item number 4?
Mr. Speaker, would you get me to
that point? necessary for
placing House joint resolution 2
as amended on final passage has
been taken and it is now subject
to debate amendment or
substitution. The gentleman to
explain the bill
resolution 2 proposes a
constitutional amendment to
eliminate the pocket veto. It
does not in any way limit the
governor's ability to veto a
bill. It just asks for an
explanation.
This is an important
transparency measure for us and
the public. Seeing no debate,
gentlemen, close
that there are 2 as amended do
not pass on final passage of
House Joint Resolution 2 as
amended. The vote is now open.
The vote's about to close.
The vote is not closed by a vote
of 66 in the affirmative, 0 in
the negative. How's joint
resolution 2 as amended has duly
passed this House.
Gentle lady from Bern Lee
Corola, are you ready on item
number 25?
Mr. Speaker,
Uh, will you get me to that
point the record reflect that a
necessary for placing House Bill
260 as amended on final passage
has been taken and it is not
subject to debate amendment or
substitution the general lady to
explain the bill.
Mr. Speaker, um, House Bill 260
seeks to establish clear
definitions and regulations
regarding the use of restraint
and seclusion schools ensuring
student safety while providing
clarity for educators, the the
bill explicitly prohibits
seclusion, says the conditions
on the use of restraint and
strengthens reporting and
training requirements to prevent
unnecessary or harmful
interventions.
And with this, uh, um, I have my
uh experts with me, John, uh,
Senna, who is the director of
LESC and Merit Andrews, who is
senior policy analyst with us in
LESC too with this, uh, Mr.
Speaker we stand for questions.
There is the gentleman from
Valencia Representative Baca.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you. Does the gentle lady from
generally and my friend from
Berley, please yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
Valencia.
County.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. uh, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I, I was
not in committee when the spill,
um, was presented.
And so, uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I'll be asking questions.
Uh, regarding the bill in some
of the areas that I think that
um may may actually complicate
this so, uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, uh, for House Bill 260,
um, what does this bill hope to
address and, uh, what process
was followed to in the creation
of this bill.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, this
bill came from a house memorial
if I remember correctly 68, so
uh after that house memorial,
Mr. Speaker, uh, a working group
was created, uh, work on the
inner committee that included um
advocates, parents, teachers,
community members, and that bill
was drafted out of that, um, out
of that uh working group.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady, and again, I
do, I do know that this did take
place during the interim and
through the LEgacy, which I, I
definitely think is the proper
process when we're looking at
legislation like this.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
As part of this work group.
Um, was there any kind of report
that was generated based upon
the stakeholder meeting.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, yes,
uh, this report was presented in
July.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady for
the, for the
For the information of the body,
would you please highlight some
of the key findings that from
this report, uh, and where can
we reference the report?
The the report is in the EEC um.
Study report um manual.
Uh, July 9, 2024 and um where
the community was asking and the
advocates uh and the information
that came out of this working
group was clear definitions of
what is seclusion restraining
what is uh what is the community
asking and the advocates see as
a need to clarify and also
teachers to understand what we
can as teachers do and it's
allowed for us to do and to have
a clear understanding of how can
we create a safer environment
for our students.
The Speaker.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. Uh, Mr.
Speaker, generally, what, what
type of data, what, what did
this report in this group find
out as far as the prevalence or
numbers of restraints and
seclusions in New Mexico.
So that last year was 11
incidents but PD doesn't collect
the data, so we actually need
more uh more uh uh uh process to
be able to collect and have that
information, Mr. Speaker.
So thank you, Mr. Speaker and
thank you gentle lady, if I, did
I understand that the number was
11, uh, that we are known that
we know over how many how many
reports we have Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, gentlemen, um,
that's what the information that
we have, but we know it's not
all of them are reported, so 11
is the information that we have,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, but uh
we know for there probably is
more than that it's just the
only information that we were
able to acquire, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady, and that's
kind of one of the first
problems that I've identified,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, is
that what we're talking about
the number of incidents that is
reported that we know of, um,
creating a policy around that,
Mr. Speaker, general, can
actually have, um, some
unintended and kind of adverse
effects.
That um that may be brought
about that so the fact, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, that we do
not collect the current data,
we're not sure how prevalent
this problem and so we're not
sure.
You know, some of the later
documents will point out.
Uh, they're referring to
national data and not
necessarily New Mexico data, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
I
No, I can, I you you kind lady.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
this, uh, bill will actually
help to process and get more
data, so that's one of the
intents, Mr. Speaker.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
and I, again, and that's why, as
I said, and I will say, Mr.
Speaker, generally, just like
with other bills that have come
before this body, um, and as you
know, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I don't, I don't speak often,
but I do speak.
When I do see the unintended
consequences of this, so.
Uh, I do see some challenges
with this, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady and um.
I will point to page 1 of the
bill, um.
Mr. Speaker, uh, a number one.
Um, Mr. Speaker, generally,
chemical restraint, um, can you
talk about the prevalence or use
of this, I, in my 32 years, I'm
not actually aware of.
Any instance of chemical
restraint.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, this
is not really prevalent in New
Mexico, but we are aligning this
uh with this prac practices.
In the US Department of
Education.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
when we talk about it and I, I
am referencing and I will be
getting to the, the different
analysis and we're going to talk
about it.
But nationwide, if we're talking
about basing this legislation
based upon national data. Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, what is
the national data? What's the
number on chemical restraint.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, we don't
have that, but again this is
best practices. I don't think um
anyone who work in schools wants
to see some like this happening,
so we are just aligned with best
practices to to have clear clear
uh in the um guidelines what is
uh the best conductive learning
environment for our students.
And thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady, and I also
agree. I mean, that's why I say,
Mr. Speaker, generally, I agree
in the premise or the thought
behind this bill.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, in my
32 years as an administrator, 12
as a teacher, 20 is an
administrator.
I've only had to apply something
like this 3 times.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, so I
definitely am very supportive of
the concept and the idea.
Mr. Speaker, the gentle lady
that we should be using these
very rarely, but I, I think Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, as we get
into the bill, you're gonna, I'm
gonna point out some areas that
But also some more potential
litigation, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Um
Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I'm on
page 2 and I'm gonna look at
item number 6, OK, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Uh, this is we're dealing with
mechanical restraint.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, on the
The last line of those of that,
you know, that kind of a run on
sentences my teacher kind of
came out right there. Uh, it
talks about Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
It talks about safety of
Australians, devices or objects
that are prescribed by a
healthcare provider or
authorized by parental consent
for a student, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, so does that mean?
That consent by a parent may
actually um overturn and not
make this applicable, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, this
will be, uh, clearly indicated
in IP and as you and I know as
educators, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, this type of, uh, um,
uh.
Uh
I
Exceptions are actually
including the students learning
plan.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady, and, and, and
Mr. Speaker, general lady, I
also, there's, there's other
groups of students that are.
Covered under the umbrella of
IDEA.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
students that may be involved in
these student assistant team
process, and Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I'll, I'll kind of
move ahead to one of the other
things is, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, one group that is not
addressed in here, which also
has these issues that students
covered under a 504, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, that may
also have a broader definition
and a larger impact and
percentage of students on a 504,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
because the, the standard for
that is it only needs
To acquire or impact the um.
As far as a regular life
activity, Mr. Speaker,
generally, so is, does this law
also applicable for um students
on a 504, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, uh, gentlemen, this
applied to all students.
Speaker, gentle lady in the bill
itself, um, it does, I, I do
reference as far as IDEA. I do
see it covers students under
sat. I do see that it covers
students under their behavior
intervention plan.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
don't see anywhere that it
addresses or names 504.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
the specifics of using specific
um interventions or objects or
restraining is on for the IEPs
when they are including the IPs
for the rest is all the students
are included in in whatever is
definitions and guidelines in
this bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you
gentlemen, and I'll, and I'll
leave this for now because it
will come uh appropriate when we
can talk to them about the
discipline.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, uh,
page 3.
Um, of this, uh, item number 11.
Talks about seclusion.
In the seclusion as defined here
means the involuntary
confinement of student loaner
room or area for which um egress
is prevented and without
continuous line of sight.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
Could a sensory room also fit
this definition and could it be
problematic as far as a sentry
room or a social emotional SEL
room, Mr. Speaker, General Lee.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, this is
only if you cannot leave the
room so in this case it does not
apply.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you
gentle lady.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
as, as, as part of many people's
uh safety plans right now, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, if we have
a student that is in an
escalated or elevated state and
is in a classroom and maybe
causing a disruption and or
danger throwing things, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Many times the students that are
not involved in this are
actually escorted from the room,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, which
would leave a student in a room,
um, and, and could fall under
this definition of
seclusion, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
it would allow for a seclusion
with continuous life supervision
when the students are in danger
when the people around the
students there is imminent
danger and it should end as soon
as the situation deescalate.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I, I
agree with that, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, is that we during
this thing we do want to take as
far as intervention and we do
want to make sure that, you
know, safety of the student to
anyone involved is part of it,
Mr. Speaker, General Lee.
If this action is contained
within a classroom, then under
this that the student, you know,
if they're trying to, which gets
into another point that I'm
gonna be bringing up elopement,
so we have a situation, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
We have a student that has
escalated um.
Again, for the safety of the
student, others people are there
and the student, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, may actually, as
far as try to leave.
That classroom and so by this
definition, it could be
contained as a seclusion or
confinement, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Uh, another instance that I
think that this may be somewhat.
This could this also be like um
for a principal's office if we
are doing to giving the due
process of a student.
Could this, uh, Mr. Speaker,
generally fall under that
definition if a student does not
want to be in the in the
principal's office and is
attempting to leave. Could this
also be under
Seclusion or confinement, Mr.
Speaker, generally.
Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen, as
long as the students have um are
in a place where it's a
continuous line of supervision
this, this will be allowed.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, so
I'm gonna go down and I, I, I
appreciate that. I'm not again
and, and I, I'm not gonna go
every point that hypothetical
point will never get there, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
But the last line of that
sentence, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, could be a little bit
confusing.
And it says that the behavior
plan or individual program that
involves a student separation
from a larger group for the
purposes of calming the student.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, if
it's part of the students IEP
that that student have access.
And can, you know, as far as
time out to remove themselves
from this or part of this, could
this also be a political and not
allowed based upon this
definition, Mr. Speaker, General
Ley.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
seclusion does not mean this and
is why is the reason that we
have the definition here, so
seclusion does not mean the use
of voluntary behavior management
techniques and so on like that.
Mr. Speaker, generally, and I
agree, but as a, as you'll, I'll
point out down in this, uh,
later on is that by these
definitions and by this, we may
actually be expanding the
umbrella and it'd be applicable
to more students which could
somewhere be problematic, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, page
4.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, on
section C number 1.
The student's behavior presents
an eminent danger of physical
harm to the student and others.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
what is that definition of
imminent danger.
And Mr. Speaker, uh, gentle
lady, when, uh, we walk up on a
fight which as we deal with many
times in our school days.
Um
How, how, how would that handle
or fall into or fall under the
umbrella of this uh of this
definition right here of
imminent danger.
Thank you Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, this is actually uh
one of my favorite parts of the
bill as a teacher sometimes we
are not so sure what is our best
response and we all have
intervening situations like
that. I mean, I'm a middle
school teacher, so definitely
I've been around these
situations so the bill actually
um allow us to follow some clear
protocols and guidelines, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, it's OK to
stop a fight. It's OK when we
see imminent danger for our
students or adults to to
intervene and this bill is
actually given.
as a tool as teachers to on how
to respond and it's impressive
that it was not here before.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you, gentle lady, for your
answer.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, page
5.
Item number, I guess it probably
needs to be renumbered item
number 3.
The student is eloping and the
conditions in paragraphs 1 and 2
of the subsection are also met.
For the elopement that falls
short of conditions in paragraph
1 or 2 of the subsection
physical restraint is not
authorized, but physical escort
may be appropriate, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, my, my concern with
this is that it actually when
we're referring to different
subsections in the bill and
we're talking about definitions
that this could also be very
problematic.
Uh, when they stop is responding
to an issue or an incident of
concern.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen
through the whole um bill here
we clarify that when students is
student or students around
adults I mean imminent danger
it's OK to intervene. We are not
restraining.
Uh, escorting the students,
grabbing the hand of the
students so he can cross the
street, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
so as long as we are supporting
the student safety we we are, we
are providing clear guidelines
in in this bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you. And unlike the definition
that I talked about before of E
and a Dameer which again I do
would say that a fight, a
physical fight altercation could
be imminent danger for the risk
of injury. Ooping may or may not
be considered imminent danger.
So when we're talking about
meeting certain criteria, how do
we respond to this lesser
standard but still applicable to
the rest of the um as far as the
restraint and or um
percent of a student.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, OK,
um, letter D on page 5.
Schools shall establish policies
and procedures for training and
the use of positive behavior
intervention and supports.
De-escalation physical
restraint.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, is
there an approved program that
all schools must be trained in,
or is it up to the individual
school?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, we uh we
know our state is diverse and
that they should have their own
um needs so we are actually
leaving it to the schools and
the districts to see their own
needs and apply to whatever it
fits best for for each one of
our our communities, um,
providing clear guidelines but
leaving the local control be uh
implemented in this area.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank
you and I, I definitely know
that the, that, that right
there, the acronym is PBIS,
right? And so Mr. Speaker,
gentle ladies, so if I'm a
school district and I do not
have PBIS, which is a good
program, but is also very costly
for the training of the staff
who then approves the programs
that um.
That will be used for this uh
policy development.
Mr. Speaker, um, gentlemen, PED
will approve it.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
which department within PED
will, will be approving these,
and Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, the
follow-up question of that is
who covers the cost of the, the
training and or additional costs
for this, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Mr. Speaker, um, gentlemen, at
the, the school saved and held
safe and healthy school
department, um, I think that's
the that's the per who actually
apply appro approve the school
safety plans in the district.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you gentle lady.
Um
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, on
page 5, I guess it would be now
number 3.
It says that the the it talks
about the plan of the drafting
and again Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady,
There are some uh.
Some terms in there or maybe
some qualifications or who was a
part of that, that may be a
little bit unclear, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
So it says that the should be
drafted by a planning team one
person trained and certified in
positive behavior intervention
supports. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady right here, it is saying
that PBS is a requirement.
Of this plan, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, is that correct?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
training requirements exist in
the district but didn't have
this specific guidelines.
And every district will do
differently. I know APS have
some trainings when I was there
every 3 years and not with the
specifics like this, so we now
are providing guidelines and
more specifics on on how uh best
practice could be just in our
school community, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Well thank you Mr. Speaker and
then then just as I, as I told
you before that when we're
talking about PBIS and we're
talking about districts that may
not currently have PBIS
according to this definition
right here.
Uh, it questions, it brings the
question whether this plan would
be valid, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
In that same, uh, line, uh, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, it talks
about one special education
expert, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, can you please tell me
what the criteria or
qualification is to be
considered a special education
expert.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, the
school and the district will
decide who will be this, uh,
expert, um, it should be part of
the special ed department
ideally, um, we, uh, one of the
things that I also love about
this bill is administration is
also included in these
guidelines and we know as
teachers, um, I could have all
my procedures, all my, my, um,
protocols to deal and the
escalate situations, but I do
need the support of the adults
in the.
Mr. Speaker.
Yeah, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
because one of the other things,
and I'll, I'll cover this in a
little bit.
My concern, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, is that when we're talking
about the reporting and others
that this actually may trigger
some legal ramifications,
qualifications, due process
lawsuits. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I do think that at some
point.
If I was an attorney for a
family, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I was listed as a just
because I'm a special ed
teacher, I would say, what would
that make that person an expert
and then qualified to then make
this plan dealing with restraint
and seclusion.
Um, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, part
of the guidelines here is
certification on this training
so I will assume that that will
make the person the ideal person
to deal with this situation and
we call them the expert.
And it's just one, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, one of the persons
doing the plan again in the
ideal world, and the school and
educator we know that more than
one person would be ideal to
have these teams, but uh we are
asking for a minimum of one Mr.
Speaker, generally, and again,
I, I do believe that you should
have somebody special education
teacher like when we do have an
IEP when we do have these
meetings, I think the word
expert is what tricks me up
right there because Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, I as a certified
special education teacher.
I, to one, I may be an expert
and, and I think that it's not
clear, and if I was Mr.
litigating a case, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, which again I'm
not, but I did watch, uh, as far
as, uh, you know, last show last
night, um, that, that definition
could be problematic for, for
district and what would make me
just because I'm a special ed
teacher, an expert in that, but
I'll, I'll move on, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, that's
existing language in the bill
that's not part of the new
material.
And, and thank you Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and I think that's
kind of, you know, and I'm going
to be highlighting understanding
that some of this language, this
is the first time I've seen this
bill and just like other bills,
when we, when we legislate bills
and when we talk about bills,
you know, my job, Mr. Speaker,
generally, is I've already said,
is not that I disagree with the
premise of the bill, but areas
that could be problematic in the
in the creation of this bill
because got problems for
Both our schools, our staff and
our families.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady on page
6, number 2.
Mr. Speaker, generally, I am
familiar with with LRE, least
restrictive, um, interventions,
but Mr. Speaker generally on
bullet or number 2, hypothetical
situational training for
triaging use of least
restrictive interventions in
physical.
Mr. Speaker, generally, what is
meant by that? What, what, what,
what is the intent and what?
In layman's terms, what does
that mean, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, when I'm
talking to like special ed
teachers who have gone to this
training, uh, the training is
very theoretical lecturing kind,
so we are trying to get best
practices and have the the uh
educators and the people in the
school best prepared and so this
um language, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, is to have the, the
personnel, the staff who is
gonna respond to this situations
training the best way possible.
Yeah, Mr. Speaker, generally and
just like I can tell you that it
would be very difficult to, to
train or to um
Every situation is different and
in the 32 years and in the tens
of thousands of situations that
I've dealt with. I, I think that
this happiness and there would
also be somewhat pro uh
problematic.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, bullet
number 3 of that page.
Mr. Speaker, generally, is there
an approved program for the
physical restraint techniques.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
again this is um um we are not
indicating to any district or
school or any approved program
we are leaving it to the schools
and districts to decide what
fits best best for their
communities, uh, it has to be
approved by ED.
But Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, it
is up to uh the locals, um,
districts and schools.
Well thank you Mr. Speaker.
Thank you gentle lady, but just
like this is that when we talk
about the different trainings,
at one point I was meant
training, mat training, and then
I was now I was CPI trained at
one point.
And Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
when we're looking at this and
we're looking at.
The type of training that is not
only approved by PED those, the,
the requirements, the
techniques, the
For CPI and for Matt are very
different. So, Mr. Speaker, John
lady is the department going to
be talking about a recommended
plan or a technique or something
that all schools for consistency
will be required to follow.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, we
don't have that info here. I
mean that would be really PD
that would be the
recommendations and in dialogue
with the schools and districts
I'm assuming Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
And thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, gentle lady, and, uh,
again, when we talk about the
FIR which we'll get to, we're
also talking about a different.
As far as additional costs to
school districts.
Uh, to get certified in this
preferred training.
Mr. Speaker, General lady, we
kind of touched on this earlier,
but page 7.
Item number 3.
He said, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, the physical restraint
techniques shall be used only by
school employees who are
trained.
In a safe, effective use of
restraint techniques unless an
emergency situation does not
allow sufficient time.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
When we talk about, we talk
about the definition of a
restraint. If I am walking up on
a situation.
Um, and it is a fight or
something that I do not know
the, you know, the proceeding
or.
The as far as what preceded this
altercation, uh, Mr. Speaker,
generally, one of my fears is
that because I'm not that person
that's been identified on this
plan that if I do have to put or
touch the student or intervent
physically, Mister Speaker,
gentle lady, that that could be
a problem for me as an employee
and possibly opening up to um
Um, for their adverse action.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, this
is actually one of the um
situations that teachers
actually were more concerned
about we don't know how to act
and it's actually what is going
on right now, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, when we saw students
in a danger we are responding
because we're educators and we
like to protect our students but
we are always concerned about
our reaction so this bill
actually is a tool for the
teachers, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, because he gave us,
gave us the answer it's OK if
it's an imminent danger for our
students.
are the or any people around the
school it's OK for us to
intervene, um, we as an
educators, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, we always.
Responding but.
I, as an educator, I can tell
you from experience I was always
concerned like it's OK for me to
stop a fight but now with these
guidelines it is the students
are in danger and when I
intervene and um this bill is
telling me you're OK, Mr.
Speaker, May.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you
gentlelani, and just like I said
before, I understand.
But when we're talking about,
you know, training there. I
mean, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
2 out of my 3 times that I've
ever had to use this. It was to
fight or gain control of a
weapon, Mr. Speaker General. So
the fact is that there was no
Technique or certification, but
there was a need to um
de-escalate the situation, so
Mr. Speaker, generally, I, I do,
one of my concerns in this, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, is that we
would have staff that would see
an instance and would walk away
and there could be further
injury.
To both uh combatants and those
that were in the area, Mr.
Speaker, General lady.
Mr. Speaker, General Lady Page
8.
Very top of the page letter G.
Timeout should not be used as a
punishment.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
What we're talking about sensory
room we're talking about taking
breaks. I mean that those are as
far as, uh,
You know, you know, trying for
students to become.
Um, overstimulated students
become very irritated.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
I'm not sure what, you know,
time out would be in punishment
if I, if I take a student and I
remove them or there when the
working of the group and I'm
moving to another part of the,
of the room, would that be
considered a time out?
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, it.
I can't speak but as as an
educator for my student needs
time out is for me to have a
conversation for them to reflect
in their actions, not to punish
them for or having consequences
being used seclusion as a
consequence of their actions,
uh, I have that answer the
question, Mr. Speaker. You tell
me.
Mr. Speaker, generally, and the
confusion is what is the time
out, time out just to try to get
students to self-regulate and
when it's time out a punishment
and who makes that
determination, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, on page
3, it has a definition of time
out.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you
gentle lady.
Um
Number one on that, uh, when
we're talking about this is
we're talking about reporting.
And this, Mr. Speaker,
generally, is where I think that
we have some areas that I think
are a little bit concerning, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
It says here say school
employees shall provide the
student's parent.
Uh, with written oral notice the
same day that in its incident
has occurred, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, uh, is, is that, is
that a designated person or who,
who is making the, who should be
making the the uh reports to the
or notice to the parents, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, this
is already in the safety school
plan we are just adding some
specific uh language but uh it's
already in the safety uh safety
plan from the schools, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, in
the, in the plan, so it doesn't
say who.
That person was that would be
responsible, would it be me as a
person who has intervened in
this situation, it's me as the
administrator, me as the person
in charge of the plan or me as
far as a witness and I just, Mr.
Speaker, generally, I, I don't
think it's very clear about who
would be responsible for making
the notice, Mr. Speaker
Generallini.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, your
school will decide decide this
if you were the person assigned
in the safety plan, then it will
be you, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, General lady, um.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, and
we're on towards the bottom of
that page, Mr. Speaker,
generally.
Um
letter A
Any known precursors that may be
true or that have triggered the
behavior such as specific
persons, locations, activities,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
How would we be getting that
information, Mr. Speaker, gentle
ladies, and would.
Would we be having to gather,
uh, witness statements,
statements from students,
students from staff, um, in
order to fulfill this
requirement, Mr. Speaker, gentle
ladies, and
You so would those also be uh
open to records request.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um.
I
When I have a situation in the
school that I have to document I
write down all the information
that I can remember recall it is
is part of our teachers duties
already so this will be part of
the same information reporting
and writing all the information
that could give us a clear
understanding of the situation,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you
gentle lady.
But when we talk about
generating writing down these
notes with those, uh, notes
information and reports would
they also be subject to
discovery.
Um, by as far as, um,
Either advocates or or outside
legal counsel.
Mr. Speaker, generally, I do,
did you, I'm sorry if I didn't
make that clear.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, and
again, I do believe
documentation or documenting
what you've seen, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, would those be a
part of the report process and
would they be discoverable, um,
from parents and or other
outside agencies.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um
probably yes like the everything
that uh is in the best interest
of the students is available for
the families and parents, this
will be applied to the same
situation, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
based upon that and based upon
the number of um
Cases that I think that this
could, could potentially uh
create.
I think that Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I think there's another
incident where.
Staff may not want to be
involved because of what they
have observed may be actual
discover and potentially cause
further for them to be further
involvement and possible
litigation, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, on
page 9 still.
Um, what I.
Bottom page.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, when
we talk about letter A, the
instances me in, in, in the
incident in which a straintteans
were used and analysis of how
future incidents may be avoided.
That the student may be eligible
for special education.
Will require a functional
behavior assessment, Mr.
Speaker, uh, gentle lady, um.
Again, if this is existing
language, what this is saying,
Mr. Speaker General Lady.
Is that if a student is involved
in this restraint that they
could
or could be on an IEP.
Mr. Speaker, generally, and
currently,
any parent can recommend for an
evaluation.
But Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
with this language right here is
basically saying that if we have
such a situation that they
actually may be on an IEP, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, and
I think this applied to
situations in the school
academically like the same in in
this situation when we see a
recurring situation where we
suspect that the student needs
some specialized plan that's
when we will refer him to that
like the sam sad plants or
specific interventions that will
be pretty much the same, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you
gentlemen or gentle lady on B of
that same thing, and here's what
we're going to talk about, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady about the
groups that it covers and and
some of the uh concerns that it
may trigger, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
If the student has an individual
education um team program team,
behavior intervention plan.
A student assistance team.
Um
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I would
also assert that 504 is missing
from this.
But Mr. and also students that
are identified as gifted, uh, on
an IEP.
Um, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Are you, are you aware of the
Behavioral requirements of that
this covers and what is required
of this um students that are
covered under this section, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, could
you, um, refrain your um explain
your question, um, I'm not so
sure you are talking about
students within individualized
education plan or um sad
interventions could you explain
your question, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, gentle lady, yes,
ma'am. I will explain this. My
question, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, is that when you talk
about the students, this covers
students on an IEP.
Students that have a behavior
intervention plan because Mr.
Speaker, generally do not every
kid on a behavior intervention
plan is on an IEP, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
A student assistant team, which
may be a student that is.
Uh, under the process for
identification or this a student
with a 504.
A student that is identified as
gifted.
This, um,
This covers a lot of folks, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Do you know, and again, if you
don't know, Mr. Speaker,
generally, um, that's OK, but
what percentage of students do
we have currently right now on
an IEP in New Mexico, Mr.
Speaker, General.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, is an
average of 17%.
I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
7, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, 17%.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady almost
1 out of 5.
And when we talk about students
that are um as far as on a dip.
Or Mr. Speaker, students that
are on a sat students that are
gifted or students on a 504.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, do we,
do we agree that that number
would be much higher? And do we
have any idea what that number
would be, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, that the
number will be higher, we agree,
um.
We don't, we don't have the
exact number, but every school
like being in intervention sad
intervention, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, it will be really up
to the schools. At one point my
school have half of my students
population in sad folders so
with sad folders so it really
depends on the schools
you gentle lady and so under
that umbrella there because all
those students are covered under
the umbrella of IDEA.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, for
the, for the benefit of the
body, can you tell me what are
some of the behavior
requirements for students that
uh that are covered under IDEA
or they're covered under those
protected groups, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, I
need a little more follow up on
on your question but just to
clarify this only applies if
this is a recurrence on physical
restraining and seclusion more
than 2 occasions. That's when we
see a pattern and we need to
have a plan for the student.
This is when apply only on on
those situations, but could you
um um explain your question Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, and, and I'll help
you out, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, OK. Students that are on
an IEP students are on your
side, which again is still
covered under the brella of
IDEA.
We have to have the as far as
the manifestation determination
to see if this is in fact a part
of their disability.
The number of days it may may be
suspended or that constitutes a
change of placement.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, my,
my point to that is by when we,
when we look at this group,
We extend this umbrella so not
only are we adapting
requirements as far as uh uh
manifestation determination as
far as every time we go beyond
the 10 days.
Every time we have this
situation and review I behavior
metro plan.
Mr. Speaker, it's, it's going to
be affected a large part of the
school district which causes,
you know, each of those have
different triggers and each of
those have different
requirements and if not follow
the trigger as far as uh process
for school districts and
possible due process taken
complaints, Mr. Speaker, General
Lady.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, I, I
understand the concern that this
could add but this is just when
it's a pattern when the
education plan for the students
when the the intervention when
the escalation and the training
and everything that we do in
school for our students is not
working so it shouldn't be a
burden in that extent it should
be just, uh, in, in occasions
when Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
when that when it's a pattern
that is uh something that we are
doing in the school is not
working for our students.
Mr. Speaker, generally, and
that's, you know, my, my point
for that is saying is that once
we have a student involved in
one of those processes.
Then technically it's just like
the as far as an IEP man, so 22
instances.
If I'm involved in a situation
in August and just like the
student on IP.
The way the laws written and
covered under federal law, it
would trigger the same type of
response for all those students
that I have uh listed.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I'll go
on.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, page
10.
Mr. Speaker, generally, as far
as number 4,
A parent has a right to request
an individual education program
team.
VIP.
Or student assistant teams meet
after an incident of physical
restraint.
Mr. Speaker, generally, did you
see how that is somewhat
contrary to what we just
discussed in this other one as
far as when we have this
restraint.
We've taught, you know, we, we
just basically say that the
parents, which is, I believe,
new language.
For that is problematic to those
groups I've identified before,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh.
Why is this different again, um.
What is this different um of
what we are you're talking about
here Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
why is it different? I'm, I'm
not saying what I'm saying is
that when a parent has a request
that can they request those
programs.
It goes then back to those
groups that I just asked about.
My line of questioning how we're
talking about many more students
are going to be covered under
this umbrella and have the
requirements for IDA because
once a parent requests
evaluation,
Or so process they are covered
and triggered under the umbrella
of IDEA.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, this
will only require the parents to
request a meeting and access to
the information of the incident
if the student already has an
IEP or or intervention plan,
then it could complement that,
but this is only um asking that
the parents have a uh can have
access and and the school have a
protocol and guidelines on how
parents could have access to the
information of an incident that
may have happened at school.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. uh Mr. Speaker
and kind lady, my friend.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, we're
now looking at, I believe it's
I.
And I'll read, Mr. Speaker,
General lady from FA school
summons law enforcement instead
of using a physical restraint
technique on a student.
The school shall comply with the
reporting documentation and and
review procedures establishing
pursuant to this section.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, does
this apply to school resource
officers?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, this is
current language so this is part
of what um it already exists, so
I, I in, in my experience, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, uh, we have
a reporting documentations.
Part of our the response.
And it will apply to the school
resource officers, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, what
if the school resource officers
are certified police officers.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, it's
fine. It's, yes.
Mr. Speaker
Gentle lady, it is fine. It is
fine to as far as going back to
the mechanical restraints or, or
those requirements and, and Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, I'm
going to complicate it just a
little bit further, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, could
you repeat that question? Sorry.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady, my friend, um.
When we talk about so school
resource officers, I wasn't
quite sure.
But what about
Um
certified campus security
officers that are school
employees and Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, many of the schools
in the area.
Use outside security companies
to provide security for their
schools, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, how does this apply to
them?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
this, uh, clarifies that even if
it's a school employee staff or
somebody from outside the school
the reporting requirements are
um are to follow are the same
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, and going back to I
again, if it's summons law
enforcement instead of using
physical restraints, I guess
we're talking about school
resource officers also being in
law enforcement if they're
certified officers.
Yes, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I do
have an amendment that I would
like to um bring before the
body, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Gentlemen, if you will kindly
bring it to the chief clerk and
then we'll go from there. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, and I would
respectfully request a roll call
vote, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady
respectfully granted, gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Gentlemen, while the amendment
gets passed out, will you kindly
read the number on the bottom
left.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Make sure my reading glasses are
working here, but um as far as I
can see, Mr. Speaker, the
numbers.
231487.2.
Perfect. That's what I have as
well. Thank you. We'll get it
passed out and post it online.
It looks like the amendment has
been passed out and it is posted
online, gentlemen, to explain
the amendment.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This
amendment, um,
It attempts to to clarify as far
as behavior. So on page 1 line
13.
We're strike prohibiting and
insert the lieu of limiting.
On page 3, line 24, insert
except as provided in subsection
of this, um, subsection D of
this section.
Page 5 between lines 9 and 10.
Insert the new subsection. It's
called the public school may
allow the use of mechanical.
Restraining prone restraint by
school resource officers or
security officers who are
trained in restraint techniques
and only under circumstances
delineated in subsection C of
this section.
And uh also for is just letting
of the succeeding subsections
accordingly.
Right, gentle lady, let's go
back to you. Is this a friendly
amendment.
Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen,
thank you for, uh, trying, uh,
for, for providing your
expertise on this, we feel it's
not it's unfriendly, um, schools
still have the tools and the
language in this bill to uh
respond on um um situations who
are outside of our normal
classroom or class academic
environment. There is a debate
on the amendment. The young lady
from Valencia, Representative
Mirabal Moya.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Would
the gentleman from Valencia
yield.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I kindly
yield to the gentle lady from
Valencia County. Mr. Speaker,
um, I, I, I really like this
amendment, um, mostly because
one of my biggest, uh, issues
with this bill was completely
prohibiting, um.
prone restraint, not that I ever
condone it or, or want it to be
your first instance, but
there's, for those of us
teaching in a in a high school
when you have a 64, uh, very
strong gentleman that is enraged
and, and hurting other people at
that point and other adults
sometimes that is the only
restraint that you can use. And
so prohibiting this is just it's
gonna be detrimental to
everybody else, so would this
allow our school resource
officer who is usually on campus
or anyone.
to be able to restrain this so
he cannot further hurt him or
other adults and, and students.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle, and that's what it
attempts to do. It basically
attempts to define a school, um,
SRO as the same and treat them
the same as if we had outside
law enforcement come into our
campuses, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, that was, uh, what we're
saying is these are certified
police officers who have gone
through extensive training and I
have a.
Um, our trained in these
techniques and also school
security who have also been
trained in these, um,
Techniques and restraints and
are certified to to use them,
Mr. Speaker, generally.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and, and
gentlemen, would this include,
and I know several districts. I
wish mine did, but I believe
yours does have a campus police,
would include them?
Mr. Speaker, generally, that is
what this is trying to do when
we talk about our school
districts, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady that have school police as
far as, uh, APS.
While some schools and other
school districts around the
state, basically this is saying,
Mr. Speaker, generally that at
the school resource officer felt
that it was necessary to use
mechanical restraints or.
For the purposes of the imminent
danger or to secure safety.
First brief periods of time we
have a prone restraint. That's
what this amendment is intended
to do, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, uh, thank
you, gentlemen. I, I definitely
support this amendment.
There's further debate,
gentlemen from Burnley
Presentative Romero.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well,
the gentleman from Valencia
yield.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield
to the kind gentleman from
Berlio.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, could
you tell me what
How your amendment does not
Include um.
Or how your amendment does
include uh security officers and
school resource officers.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen from
Berlio what it's saying is that
when we talk about Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, that only a law
enforcement responding agency or
first responder could be using
these um restraints or support,
and Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, this
my amendment is saying, because
I did ask specifically Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
Do school resource officers if
they are trained and certified
and are currently have their
certification through the DPS,
are they also uh able to perform
this if it need be, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen. Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, um, in the actual
bill, who does the bill pertain
to?
So who's having to um
Prohibit restraint and
seclusion.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, we're
talking about school staff, but
if the school staff, Mr.
Speaker, our school resource
officers are hired and our
employees of the school
district, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Then this would say because they
are school staff, you would
prohibit them from this this
use, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
And Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
what's the purpose of trying to
include our
um, school security and school
resources officers and excluding
them from using such techniques.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, my, my
amendment is quite the opposite,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, it's
saying that if need be a school
resource officer would be able
to use this kind of restraint,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, Mr.
Speaker, um, and gentlemen, I'm
sorry, so let me rephrase that.
So why do you think this
amendment is necessary then.
Because Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
when I asked earlier, because of
the definition of being a school
employee.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, that the
SR school resource officer would
not be allowed because they are
school employee.
Um,
To, to have that protection.
Of using this if deemed
necessary, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Speaker and gentlemen, and I
appreciate that answer, but why
the use of specifically
mechanical or prone restraint.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, because
it was actually talked about
when we talked, we were first
responders coming to school if
in lieu of that, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, that the school
called outside agencies.
Those outside agencies would not
be um.
Under this bill, and they could
use that if deemed necessary,
and Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
I'm just trying to say that our
school resource officers who are
also certified police officers.
Many of them were tired. Many of
them with many years of law
enforcement.
That this, Mister Speaker,
gentlemen also provides them
that if they are responding to
an incident within your school.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so some
of the language in the bill says
imminent danger unless there's
imminent danger.
Could you talk about that a
little bit?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I'm not
sure what you mean by, we, we
did, Mr. Speaker, talk about
imminent danger. Um, there was a
line of question Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Of who's that definition but Mr.
Speaker John, the purpose really
the, the amendment is really to
say that our schools resource
officers could, if need be.
Respond as if any other law
enforcement agent would be able
to respond, and Mr. Speaker,
gentleman would say that they
would know the students and
would have that relationship
with the student and again, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, only in that
case where it was imminent
danger would have the same
protections and or ability to
apply these techniques if it was
deemed necessary for imminent
danger, Mister Speaker,
gentlemen.
And Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
because the bill does talk about
how some of these techniques
could be used if there is an
imminent danger or dangers
within the school, um, so I
don't understand why your
amendment might be necessary.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Let me find, let me point you
directly to the bill, Mr.
Speaker Jo.
Mr. Speaker, General, uh,
gentleman from Berino who we're
talking about that we, the, the
bill currently says only
physical restraint, not
mechanical restraint, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen. And Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, so why
mechanical restraint. Why are
you so interested in having
mechanical restraint as a part
of this piece of legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I, I don't.
Know that that is the priority
for this, Mr. Speaker, what it's
saying, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Is that the school resource
officer is a
Law enforcement or certified
police officer and just like
every time I was uh police
officer or outside responding
doesn't handcuff unless it's
necessary.
The school resource officer, if
it were deemed necessary.
Could apply that if necessary. I
do not see this as being
widespread, but it does provide
them the same opportunity or
otherwise our school resource
officer we'll just call.
Our local responding agencies
which are maybe not on campus in
the respond time could be longer
to deal with the situation that
could be of imminent danger, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
And Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I
guess that's what I'm trying to
find out and what I see is
frustrating is I don't see when
these techniques might be
absolutely necessary within the
bill if physical restraint is
already a part of the bill in
order to restrain students and
to protect school personnel from
those techniques, but with that,
Mr. Speaker, thank you.
Right, there's further debate.
The gentleman from
Colfax, scurry Harding Que San
Miguel and Union Representative
Chatfield. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
Does a gentleman yield?
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield
to the kind gentleman.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
I want to start with page one.
Line 13.
Using
Limiting instead of prohibiting.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
Do you think this increases or
decreases liability to the
teacher involved.
Mr. Speaker, I would say that it
increases liabilities with the
teacher involved.
You believe it increases the
liability?
Mr. Speaker
When we, when we talk about
these definitions, we talk about
the training and the premise of
this bill and the requirements
is for to be certified in these
techniques. I do think that.
And the reporting that this
could increase liability of
anyone who would be responding
and thus therefore most people
would not want to intervene
because of these requirements,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
So the word limiting instead of
the word prohibiting would
reduce the liability. Is that
true? Yes, sir, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle,
gentlemen.
Um
The, the last section down
there, uh, about, uh, physical
restraint.
Uh, many of these kids are on
Zoloft, a variety of other, uh,
Things, is there a reason that
you did not, uh,
Mention that you did not mention
maybe a child's off their meds
and, and how, why is that not a
part of, of your amendment that,
that they could be given those
meds to help them return to a
more normal state, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, I would say that the
use of, you know, we talked
about medicine for restraint,
Mr. Speaker, those of me under
doctor's orders and would
require as far as medical.
As far as, um, for the nurse or
someone to apply this in, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, that's what
I talked about is the prevalence
of using medicine for restraint
medical restraint. I don't
believe that that should be it,
and I'm not aware of many
instances where these are done.
If the student is not on their
meds, although uh concerning.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I
would not, I don't think this
sort of appropriate to give them
those meds under without the
supervision of a doctor or a
parent.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I, I
agree with you. I, I would say
that many, many of our, of our
CYSD kids are on Zoloft and a
variety of meds, but I don't
think, I think it prevents them
from learning good behavior,
just on their own and in their
self, self regulation.
Um, the other thing that I
didn't ask a minute ago was, we,
we've decided that you're change
does reduce the liability of the
teacher. How about the liability
of the school is, will it help
reduce the liability of the
school.
Mr. Speaker, when we talk about
again, and I, I, I started out
my debate saying that
The premise of this bill and the
use of this in a limited
circumstances I totally support.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, but
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
I said that when we are not able
to use certain things.
And my amendment basically
saying, you know, um, that it
does allow these and those um
special circumstances.
It does reduce the liability for
the school, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, one
of the things that I know is
that when you go to put a CPI
hold on a child, you might wind
up not in the position that you
intended when you start, uh,
how, how is that affected by
your amendment, you know, it
says not face down. It says, uh,
a variety of things, but do we
always have a choice about that
and, and, uh, how does your
amendment affect that?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, my
amendment really talks about and
it was really directed towards
school resource officers that
recognize him as police
officers, as certified police
officers.
If and uh Mr. Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, if a police officer
that was called in to intervene
in this situation. If that
police officer, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, felt that it was
necessary to
I use mechanical restraints,
they would be allowed. That's
not covered. It says they are
not covered.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
Also, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
that if the students were
detained and were in a prone
position for a time.
It would also be allowed, and
Mr. Speaker, the, the just of my
amendment was just to say that
school resource officers
Would also be covered uh and be
able to do that if the situation
called for it, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, our
school resource officers trained
in de-escalation.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, yes,
they are. It is a requirement
from PED that they do have
training and de-escalation, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, if
they call the police, just the
regular city police, the state
police, are they trained in the
escalation?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I would
say that they are, but I think
that the training would be
different for those agencies and
the standard would be different,
sir.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, a
lot of our schools do not have
school resource officers. We
just call the sheriff, we call,
uh, whoever we can get to help,
uh,
So I guess it would be important
that, that all those people be
trained in de-escalation. Are
they trained in CPI?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, and, and
that was a question that I asked
earlier is what is the approved
program? I, I've been CPI as far
as Matt, uh, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, I do not know as far
as the training that would be
for responding outside agency
for training or what the name of
their training is that they
would be responding to Mr.
Speaker, gentleman.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I thank
you for taking my questions.
That's all I have.
There's further debate. There's
a lady from Bern Leo
Representative Thompson. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, a gentleman
from, um.
Valencia yield.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield
to the kind gentle lady.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So I'm
wondering school resource
officers how much training do
they get regarding specific
disabilities.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I, I,
I would say they would vary
between the school district as
you, as Mr. Speaker talks about
it that each school district.
And PD defines training, so Mr.
Speaker, I, I could not speak
for
Uh, training that each agency
must have. I do know, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen that our, our
school resource officers are
trained, um, in many of these
areas.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
that's a concern for me because
things that work with
neurotypical people maybe just
the opposite of what would work
and I will use my own son for an
example he does explode, but the
worst thing you can do is put
your hands on him. He's 6'7,
he's strong as an ox and.
It could go from a situation of
you could de-escalate him by
giving him a little space, a
little time.
But if you touch him,
He is going to explode, bite,
kicks, scratch anything. So it
concerns me that we are having
people who have no specific
training around how to deal with
specific disabilities. Let's say
we have a a child with
osteogenesis imperfecta, whose
bones break very easily and if
I, I school resource officers
would not necessarily know that
so I, I, this really concerns
me. Can you, can you talk to
that?
Mr. Speaker, generally, I'm not
quite sure how this, uh, with my
amendment, uh, the talks
basically to cover that, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I will
contend that if these these
students are outside and they're
in public that the officer that
is responding would not have
that knowledge as well or
information as well, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady. Speaker
and gentlemen, but if they were
if they were with uh staff who
and, and the staff was trying to
tell the officers, look, this
kid has autism hands off and,
and
I will give you a prime example.
One of my missions used to be to
get law enforcement, all law
enforcement, but particularly
school law enforcement to
understand that autism is not a,
I heard someone say about
learning self-control,
neurologically, that's not
possible. So we did a half-day
training on autism and what
things could be escalating, um,
how, how they should be handled
and then we did, we did some um.
Scenarios afterwards where we
had a student playing a student
with autism who had a knife
under the desk, not, not
bothering anybody and the first
officer, we, we had come and try
and do something his what he
said was I'd take him out. I
take out my gun and I take him
out. So that kind of really
worried me that um that that
training that we did for half a
day didn't sink in at all. Um,
and, and I do know.
Families whose kids have PTSD
from recurring restraint, um,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, law
enforcement agencies across the
country are looking at their
prone restraint because people
die in prone restraint. So I, I
find your amendment very
troubling, um, in 21 states, Mr.
Speaker, including Iowa,
Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, and
Texas limit the types of
restraints that can be used.
On uh students with
disabilities.
And it's
And Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, you
talked about there being uh.
Uh, reduction in liability. Do
you have data on that? Do you
have numbers or is that your
feeling?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, as far
as data, when we talked about
earlier in our conversation, we
don't have the data, but when
we're saying that certain
behaviors would not be allowed,
and this is saying that it could
be allowed should the situation,
um.
Required, it would reduce
liability when um we're saying
that it would not be allowed at
all, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
again.
You don't have data, so it's
your opinion that liability will
be decreased.
Mr. Speaker, generally, it's
also your opinion as far as this
as well.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, um.
So
I guess I'll leave it at that,
but I urge the body to vote no
against this because we have um.
We have these are some of our
most vulnerable people who have.
Disabilities. It's not that
they're bad kids, it's not that
they're lawbreakers, so please
vote against this. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen. There
is further debate. The gentleman
from Lincoln and Otero,
Representative Vincent.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does my
friend from Valencia County.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield
to the kind gentleman from
Lincoln and Otero.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
I fully support your amendment,
and I would say that, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, that law
enforcement have way more
training.
Then school teachers do and I
know the school teachers do the
best they can, but, uh, law
enforcement have advanced
training in that as well as
mental illness training. It was
told to me that the other day on
this floor.
And Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
Our teachers
With this, with this school
resource officer handling some
of the hard work would it, would
it, uh, keep our teachers from
having to get involved.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, yes, it
would, and just as I'm saying,
Mr. Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I,
I, I need to be clear that the
school resource officers that
were that this amendment
attempts to address our
certified law enforcement that
have gone in are required to go
through the same biennium
training and to get updated
training every year, not only
from PEB but also from DPS. So
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, all my,
my amendment intends to do is
basically saying that if a
school resource officer.
was in a situation like this
that they would that could they
could use that if the situation
deemed necessary. Now, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady or
gentlemen, no officer wants to
do that when we're talking about
kids.
But when we're talking about
just like the bill talked about
imminent danger in the, in the
or the um.
In the name of safety, they may
be required for that. So, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, uh, yes, the
training that they have is
extensive our officers, many of
them with 2025 years experience,
have received that training and
also have the experience of, of
working out, um.
Before they came to our school
district.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen.
I wish every school had a
resource officer.
I wish they had a couple of
them.
And it would be so much easier
for them to be able to take care
of this kind of work. And, you
know, it's, it's not like we
want.
You know, kids that misbehave in
school, you know, when do we,
when do we start protecting our
teachers.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
Mr. Mr. Speaker, and uh, and
gentlemen, we all have the
responsibility to protect not
only our students and our staff
and provide them with the, with
the best learning environment.
So,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, and
that's what my concern is that
By, by this bill, it actually
limits and it basically that
it's going to be hard to just
fund any students, not just in
the area of restraint or this if
it attempts to which I again
will say I think it needs to be
limited.
But as far as the suspensions,
out of source suspension, it's
going to a limited and effective
school personnel's ability to
maintain safety in our schools.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen, I support your
bill.
There is further debate. The
gentle lady from Santa Fe,
Representative Lujan. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, the gentlemen, my
good friend from Valencia
County. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield to my friend and, and
the gentle lady from Santa Fe
County. Thank you, gentlemen, as
I'm, I'm.
Looking at your amendments and
uh 0.1 on your amendments
striking prohibiting and
inserting in uh limiting. Can
you
Give me the, the basis of
through the definition as to why
you would want that change.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, the,
when we talked about prohibited
means that these could never be
used in any situation, and Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, when we
talked about that the.
The situations are as unique and
numerous as the students that we
have in our school districts, so
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, when
we say they shall not, and we're
saying in my language basically
says in certain situations if
the need arise, they could be
used, but Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, that's, that, that's the
reason for, for the line one.
So Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen,
uh, I do understand that thank
you for that, um, and that makes
sense to me, um, but, however,
through the, through the
language and through the
Uh, the, the bill itself, does
it not provide limiting, um,
events or situations.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, um, gentle lady.
Just as I pointed out that the
conflicting language and how
many of the subset of the
sections do not align with
others. This just attempts to
clarify that on this amendment,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you
gentlemen for that answer, um,
moving on to the your next uh
um.
Your 3rd, um.
Amendment here in insertion of
the section, subsection D of
public school may allow the use
of mechanical or prone or
straight.
Techniques by school resource
officers or security officers
who are trained in restraint
techniques.
And only under circumstances
delineated in subsection C of
this section, um, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, I'm through this
debate and I'm really grateful
for this debate because Mr.
Speaker, uh, gentlemen, I am a,
a parent of a child who had to
be restrained.
Not once or twice, but several
times and
Because I was there volunteering
in his classroom, I was, I was a
person that learned and was
trained on how to restrain him.
Um, granted, he was a young
child at the time and uh.
Through interventions and and
such he grew out of needing to
have um physical restraints, but
I was prepared for that as a
parent, um, so I'm so grateful
for this bill that's
representative, uh,
Gurola and Chavez have put
before us, but on this
amendment.
When we do have these certain
types of um officers as you
said, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
um, who have their own
Type of restraining techniques
that concerns me because are
they then not going, are they
not then trained as um our
teachers and other staff members
in the school on the same type
of of.
Of restraints that that will not
harm the child, Mister Speaker,
gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
would say that the school
resource officers received more
training than the regular staff
because Mr. Speaker general,
along with the required training
that the school staff because
they are school employees, they
also have to receive the
training from the DPS in order
to maintain their certificates
and their, their law
enforcement. So Mr. Speaker,
the, the, these folks that this
attempts to address receive more
training than your average
school employee.
Thank you Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, so would you would,
you would say that
Dependent upon the the
individual and the circumstance
much as.
And I'll go back to the bill in
which from which you're um
Amending that has the provisions
from the different for the
different different
circumstances.
Uh, your main concern, Mr.
Speaker, with this amendment is
to have an allowance for just
these type of, of individuals in
our schools to have the ability
to use this, this restraining um
techniques that they have, is
that correct Mr. Speaker, that
is exactly what I'm trying to
say. It's just say these school
resource officers who are
certified licensed police
officers.
Would have the same protections
and the same ability as if I
called in an outside agency
because if I call in Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, an outside
law enforcement agency, whether
it be Santa Fe County, Santa Fe
Police, and if they deemed that
it was necessary to apply one of
these techniques, my, my
amendment, Mr. Speaker, John is
just saying that a school
resource officer that has the
same training and is a certified
police officer could also use
those restraints or those
techniques if the situation.
And as Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
now knowing the student would
actually, I believe actually
make this an even a lesser
occurrence because they know the
students and they are trained in
de-escalation. So, uh, that's,
that's the point of this Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I, I do
understand your amendment, um,
however, I do see that um.
That there could there is a
provision in here that if things
do escalate to that that point
where
The there are, there is a need
for a different type of
restraining that that is allowed
in this bill do you not see
that, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, and
again, just as I say, and I'll
say this.
But, you know
That I, I support the premise of
the bill, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
My, my, my reason for the
debates and for question is to
provide clarity and some ideas
that may be conflicting and
create further liability for
parties involved. So Mr.
Speaker, I, I will say this, I
support the premise of the bill.
It's some of the language and
definitions that may be somewhat
problematic, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, thank you for that.
I, I think we hear that from you
and your, your earnestness as as
we're having this debate.
And I just feel like maybe
there's more to to this uh this
issue you have along with the
sponsors to be maybe debated or
decided later I think that this
is an important bill.
Um, as I mentioned, as a parent,
um, who had to go through this
and have the concerns. I also,
um,
had to um address an issue with
my son when he was just in the
2nd grade and the teacher was
afraid to even go touch him at
one point where I had to remove
him from his school. um, do you
think that this amendment that
this would
This would curate anything in
that nature for our
professionals in our classrooms
are educators that.
That that that this would this
amendment would change anything
for them to have more confidence
in in in the issues that they
have to uh deal with with
certain types of uh situations
with students, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, again,
this bill, the, the language in
the bill may address as my
minute, Mr. Speaker generally,
is only geared towards school
resource officers.
And I think that's really what
the distinction is.
I do think that the bill does
outline some of the
requirements, certain reporting,
and, and it does provide
definition. My bill, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady would just
say that school resource
officers.
would have the same ability to
use
Uh, a technique if deemed
necessary as as Santa Fe police
or uh state police or whomever.
And again, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I don't think any law
enforcement and police officer.
Sheriff's deputy want to ever do
that with a child, and I will
say that in school resource
officers probably have less of a
But when we talk about imminent
danger and we talk about the
situations that
I was divi, you know, was
involved in where we're fighting
for a controllable weapon.
Mr. Speaker, generally, they do,
they do occur.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, General,
I again, I do hear you and I, I,
I hope that there is room for
further debates and
understanding. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you, gentlemen.
There is for the debate
generally from Berlin and
Torrens, Representative Lord.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well,
the kind gentleman from
Valencia, please yield your
time.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank
you. I do y to the kind, uh,
gentle lady from uh Berlin and
Torrance. Thank you. I just have
some questions, some
explanations that I want on this
bill, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
so when we're talking about the
school resource officers because
I know quite a few we have them
in the charter schools. Usually
they're retired law enforcement
and can you give me a little bit
of understanding of what their
training is before they come
into work at a school, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, many
of these folks that we have and,
and we have, we represent most
agencies. They're, they're
certified police officers that
have 20 to 25 years of
experience.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
these come with the same
experience as the officers that
are currently out patrolling
our, our streets, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
In addition to them, these,
these uh school employees then
received the school district and
state training under PED so not
only do they have
The same training as any other
agency, they have more training
as a school employee, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen. So
things can happen that are very
extreme. I mean, we, we hope
not, but sometimes things do
happen. Let's say if a child had
some sort of dangerous weapon.
They had a knife, they had a
firearm that is something that
an SRO would be able to handle
because they have the training.
Is that correct, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen?
Mr. Speaker, generally, yes.
So Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, if
somebody had a firearm in the
school, we would want them to
restrained at every means
possible. Is that correct, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen?
Mr. Speaker, generally I do
believe this is addressed as
imminent danger and imminent
danger we do want to reduce the
Um, as far as the risk and
safety to those uh all those
involved. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Yes, in those situations they
may be applied. Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, when I'm looking at
is imminent danger, a child
says, I'm gonna hurt you. He
pulls out a farm, which God
forbid that ever happens, but at
that time we need more than just
physical restraint. We need
people to have far more
experience who may have to use
um.
A mechanical prone restraint. Is
that correct, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen?
Yes, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, and that's why I'm saying
that the school resource officer
that is on campus would not be
covered, so we would actually
have to wait or could possibly
wait for an officer off campus
to come on there and then be
covered under this because under
the current law, and that's why
amendment chooses to say is a
school resource officer could
respond in that matter and under
the current bill and the way
it's written as a school
employee, they would not be able
to. We would be waiting for
outside law enforcement
officers.
To respond and do what our
school resource officer has been
trained and is capable of doing,
Mister Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely
horrifying.
Mr. Speaker dumb. That's
absolutely horrifying like in
some of our rural districts
anywhere actually, it takes a
while for law enforcement to get
there so for me what I'm looking
at we have these men and women
who have the training, have the
ability, know how to handle the
situation, and we're not talking
about de-escalating, we're
talking about somebody who's
gonna do imminent danger.
They're about to stab another
student they're about to stab a
teacher they're about to harm
somebody in a way that could
cause death.
And so we're asking for Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, is uh
give them the ability for SROs
to be able to restrain somebody
with a mechanical strain because
we don't have time to wait for
law enforcement. Is that
correct, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen?
Mr. Speaker, that's a gentleman,
that gentle lady, that's what my
bill basically said is that if
they, they would have to be
trained and certified in those
techniques and because of their
training and certification in
those techniques, they would use
those if absolutely necessary,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady and
thank you Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, I just want to say
one more time, this is for an
imminent dangerous situation
where somebody needs to be
restrained quickly. They're
about to harm somebody. We don't
have time for law enforcement,
and we need to make sure that we
have men and women who are
trained like a law enforcement
officer who know how to handle
the situation.
to
stop the threat, right? This is
what we're trying to do, we're
trying to stop the threat or
even in the fact if a child was
about to commit suicide, Mr.
Speaker, we had a child in the
class who was about to commit
suicide. We need to have a way
to get that whatever they were
going to use the tool away from
them and I would rather have
somebody who's trained. I don't
want to wait for something
horrific to happen. So Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, I
completely understand your
amendment and thank you so much
for bringing that forward.
further debate, gentle lady from
Bertin Leo, representative
Torres Velasquez.
Um, Mr. Speaker, will the
gentleman from Valencia County
Yield.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield
the kind gentle lady.
Thank you, um, kind, gentle man.
Um
I, uh, first of all, I want to
thank
Representative of Gurola for
taking on this this bill.
Um
In my many years as a professor
in special education as a parent
advocate, um, as a teacher.
Many parents have come to me.
Um, for advocacy, uh,
voluntarily I support them. I
advise them, I helped them.
And, um,
One of the things that I
continue to hear decade after
decade after decade after
decade.
Is that
Often
Parents don't know when their
child has been restrained.
And the behavior of some of our
students in special education.
Um, includes not being able to
have the words to communicate to
anyone what is going on, but
they use their behavior as
communication, is that not true?
Um, um, gentleman from Valencia
County.
In your experience with some
students with disabilities.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
again from
thank you Tara Mr. Speaker
gentle lady, again, my, my
amendment and I think that's
what we're debating here is not
the bill itself. I'm not the,
the, um.
Sponsor of the bill, my
amendment basically just says
that a school resource officer
if need be.
Would have the same ability that
they are trained in to respond
to an imminent threat.
Mr. Speaker, that, that's,
that's what my amendment is and
that's what the, the questions
are, uh, Mr. Speaker, um, gentle
lady, but I, I, I don't know,
um, as far as the bills and
reporting, uh, Mr. Speaker,
generally, I would think we've
kind of covered that, but my
understanding, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, is that it's really
about the amendment which just
basically.
Um, says that a school resource
officer could do this at the
situation arise, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
And Mr. Speaker, gentlemen from
Valencia County, um, isn't it
true that if a child cannot
communicate and a parent is not
told that their child has been
restrained, they could very well
have been restrained by a police
officer or security officer,
someone at the school, um, in,
in ways that they could not
communicate to to their family.
Um, and, and in fact, Mr.
Speaker.
Uh, Jehoman, um, I have received
similar reports from many
counties, um, I live in Berlio
County and I can tell you that
surrounding counties this is
this is not a surprise and so I
am contacted on a regular basis
by people in my district or
people in other districts, um.
About such incidents and in
fact, um, one of my constituents
wrote thanking uh Representative
Gurola, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
for this bill and her son even
contributed and said no one
should be treated the way he was
treated and, and so Mr. Speaker,
whether and Mr. Gentleman,
whether we are looking at police
officers or the practice of.
Prohibiting or limiting or any
other language.
Um, I think foremost we need to
think of our students with
disabilities for whom this was
written.
Um
I had some questions and I had
pulled this up, but I had some
questions and, and they may have
been answered when I stepped out
of the room, Mr. Speaker, and
gentleman from Valencia County,
but, um, it says on page 5,
section D, um,
that, uh, police a public school
may allow the use of mechanical
or prone restraint techniques by
school resource officers or
security officers who are
trained in restraint techniques
and only under circumstances
delineated in subsection C of
this section and I, and I
imagine that you explained that
to someone else already, but if
there's anything you'd like to
add to that section, I would
really be interested, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen from
Valencia.
the county.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, again,
what my amendment does and what
the basic of this debate is, is
like it's, it really boils down
to his school resource officers
that are school employees, do
they have are able to to deal
with this as far as in the bill.
Um,
you know, that those, those are
questions that I've raised, but
my, my amendment basically says
that a school resource officer
if the situation.
Was it was necessary.
could use mechanical restraints
and or prone position for a
period of time to gain control
and to stop the threat.
And so I'm wondering, Mr.
Speaker, uh, gentlemen, um, in
the bill, it actually says a
public school may allow the use
of restraint techniques.
On student only if.
The students' behavior presents
an imminent danger, and I think
I heard an example about
imminent danger in the
commentary, Mr. Speaker, and
gentlemen, um, imminent danger,
serious harm to the student or
others or two less restrictive
interventions are insufficient
to mitigate the imminent danger
of serious physical harm, um.
I, I'm just wondering if that
addresses, um, some of these
amendments, Mr. Speaker and kind
gentleman from Valencia County
where I love to visit and, um,
you all have so many wonderful
resources, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen.
Love your land, um, our land.
Um, so,
So I'm just wondering why that
changed.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
again, my, my bill or my
amendment attempts to address
this section of the bill. It's
on page 10.
And yet, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
I'm seeing this language on the
proposed amendment.
And, um, I'm confused.
Miss um.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Line 11 page 10. If a school
summons law enforcement instead
of using phys.
Using a physical street
technique I'm a student at the
school shall comply with
reporting document procedures.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, my
whole bill, my whole amendments
basically wants to include
certified school resource
officers.
As in the same category as
responding law enforcement, Mr.
Speaker, because under this, uh,
law enforcement officer could
use those restraints if it
deemed necessary.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, gentlemen
from Valencia County, um, I've
worked with, uh, teachers, um,
who
Our special ed teachers and have
students and have resource
officers in their classrooms and
I, I understand your concern.
I'm just concerned about um
potential and past legal.
ramifications in these changes
because I do know that numerous
lawsuits have been brought
against the state for these
issues.
Um, one last question, Mr.
Speaker, and I'm not trying to
put you on the spot here. I
seriously am wanting to learn.
I'm a brand new representative.
I serve on the House Education
Committee.
There was a memorial written.
For a working group.
For this effort.
Um
A working group was created and
wondering how we as members of
the House Education Committee
are allowed to participate in
these working groups is it
exclusive only to community or
do members of the House
Education Committee, get to work
on such issues with the working
group, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen from Lorenza here at
we, we were debating the
amendment, um, which is the 4,
bullet points in front of us,
uh, so I'm not gonna you Mr.
Speaker. I'm, I'm, I'm done.
OK, thank you very much, gentle
lady, uh, general lady from
Santa Barbara Center Collin.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Will the
My friend gentleman from
Valencia Yield.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield
to the kind gentle lady from
Sandoval.
Thank you.
Um, Mr. Speaker, um, gentleman
from Valencia, I just, uh, I
have a different take on this. I
am fully support this amendment.
Um
As you know that.
I'm from Rio Rancho and we had a
shooting at Cleveland High
School.
And
I was driving up as the res as
the police officers were coming
in.
And I was able to take my
daughter home and then I had to
come back and pick up more
children that ended up being
evacuated later on in the day,
so I have seen.
Personally,
What it happens in severe cases
at our schools.
And Mr. Speaker.
Mr. gentleman from Valencia.
Um, I have also seen some
horrific fights that go on into
the schools. They're uploaded on
social media if you haven't seen
them, or TikTok and all these
type of things, things that are
completely brutal that you could
not imagine what happens in bits
nowadays. They're not just
little fist fights anymore that
way you might have had when we
were in school.
We are seeing things that can
cause hospitalization, some
severe injuries.
And Mr. Speaker, Mr. gentleman.
For me, we have a great security
team at our school district we
are lucky that a lot of our
security and resource officers
are retired military and police
officers, and they're highly
trained.
Mr. Speaker, I cannot imagine.
If I lived in a rural area.
And the response time and Mr.
Speaker and.
Um, kind gentleman from
Valencia, could you tell me? I
don't know, I don't live in a
rural area. I've always lived in
an urban area and we're very
fortunate to have quick response
time with our police officers,
but would you be able to tell me
approximately in some rural
areas, how long it takes for a
sheriff to arrive.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
um, in my school district, we
have a S at every school site.
So, uh, Mr. Speaker, generally
in rural areas.
Uh, depending upon the
proximity, it could be.
It could be several minutes, um,
up to half an hour, right? And
so I, I don't, I live in, I live
in the metro, so just like you
guys, I, I do have the benefit
of
Of having response fairly
quickly, but I would assume
gentle lady, although I don't
know how long it would take for
law enforcement to respond in a
on a school uh in a rural area.
And Mr. Speaker, gentleman from
Valencia, what I will say is
that time is of the essence.
We're not only protecting our
students but also our teachers
and our staff members.
What we have seen has escalated
over the years and it's gotten
into abuse as well as.
Potential death
On our schools
So I want to make sure that our
resource officers and our
security officers are able to
restrain.
Those children
And they're not small. If you
look at middle school and high
schoolers.
There's a lot of people,
especially some teachers if if
there was if I was a teacher
there would no way that I can
handle somebody that was.
6 ft or high uh taller.
With uh
You know, somebody like you
maybe when you were in high
school, I can't even imagine me
being able able to restrict you
know.
Defend myself.
So I just wanna say that I'm
full support of this amendment
and I need you to, and I hope
that you will as well.
This isn't about just one issue
this is a lot of issues and
there's our lives are at stake.
Thank you.
There is for the debate, the
gentleman from Sandoval,
Martinez.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, will the
kind gentleman from Valencia
you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield
to the kind gentleman from
Sandoval.
Thank you, kind gentlemen. Um, I
just have a quick question.
You're, your amendment.
Um, would this keep both.
The
teach the res the, the resource
officer and the student safe.
Mr. Speaker kind gentleman, I,
I, I think what it does, my
amendment really is saying that
a school resource officer.
If the situation deemed could
use these techniques for the
Um, purpose of safety and in
fact could de-escalate the
situation and make it safe for
all instead of waiting for a
response from outside entities
or agencies.
kind gentlemen, that's the thing
that we need to keep in mind. Is
this amendment will keep
everybody safer, and I encourage
the body to vote for it. Thank
you kind gentlemen. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. There's the gentle
lady from McKinley,
Representative Lindstrom. Thank
you Mr. Speaker, the gentleman
yield, please?
Yes, thank you Mr. Speaker. I
yield to the kind gentle lady.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, um, I know we're
talking about the amendment, but
I'm trying to tie the amendment
back into page 10, line 21, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen of the bill,
and I'll, I'll just read it to
you. It says the provisions of
this section shall not be
interpreted as addressing the
conduct of law enforcement or
first responders, so does this,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, your
amendment affect this section.
Now, uh, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
thank you, kind gentle lady. My
amendment actually just includes
school resource officers that
responding agencies.
So it doesn't limit the ability
of those other agencies. It just
includes school resource
officers, give them the ability
if the situation arose.
Alrighty, thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you, gentlemen.
Gentle lady from Santa Fe.
Mr. Speaker, I move to Table
House for Amendment number 1 to
House Bill 260 as amended.
tabling motion to house floor
amendment number 1 to House Bill
260 as amended.
There's a roll call vote, 32nd
vote clock, a vote of yes, and
we would have tabled the
amendment the vote of no, we're
back on the amendment.
The vote is now open.
The vote's about to close. The
vote is not closed by a vote of
34 in the affirmative, 27 in the
negative. House floor amendment
number 1 to House Bill 260 as
amended has been tabled.
Who had
Oh, gentleman from Valencia, you
still have the floor. I forgot
who had the floor. Apologies,
gentleman from Valencia, you
still have the floor. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. It's just because I
don't speak on the floor, so you
forgot about me.
Mr. Speaker, General, uh, and,
and as far as colleagues, uh, my
amendment, Mr. Speaker, actually
is because of the uh
recommendation of NIMSI. If you
look at your the FIR, the
recommendation from the public
school insurance authority
recommends as far as the school
resource officers being
included. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, the amendment really was
trying to stay in line with the
recommendation.
From the New Mexico school uh
intern authority, so I do thank
you for the healthy debate, uh,
Mr. Speaker, and body.
There is further debate. We're
back on the bill, where there's
further debate. The young lady
from Bern Leo, Representative
Eleanor Chavez.
I thank you Mr. Speaker. Will
the gentle lady yield.
Mr. Speaker, I'll yield to that
co-sponsor of the bill, the uh
uh gentle lady from Bernardillo.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. um, I
signed on to this bill, um,
because I'm concerned as a
parent I've got.
Actually 4 kids who have gone
through the public school system
and what I wanted to do was make
sure that school staff have the
tools necessary to keep our
classrooms safe.
So Mr. Speaker, Representative,
my one of my question is around,
you know, if there's a fight
occurring in the classroom and
we know that sometimes that
happens. Does this bill allow um
teachers.
school staff to break up the
fight to intervene to break up
the fight.
Mr. Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
uh, yes, actually, um, I
mentioned it is this is a great
tool for teachers. I'm a teacher
and we always second doubting
ourselves, uh, when we see the
students in danger, we will
react, but we only want if this
is OK for me to do it, so Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, uh, in the
working group during the
intercom committee teachers
actually asked for this language
and this guidelines to be placed
in in the in the bill.
Um, this bill will um gives
clear language and guidelines
and indications of when a
student is in a danger what is a
uh uh a loud response.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, uh,
Representative, um, so then, um,
Representative Mr. Mr. Speaker,
Representative, so then do you
think that the clarifications um
around the restraint in this
bill, make it easier for school
staff, uh, to keep a classrooms
uh safe, especially in the
conversations that you've had
with teachers, uh.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentle lady,
yes, um, we, uh, part of the,
uh, language and guidelines in
this bill is the training on the
escalation and less restrictive
interventions to prevent
situations where physical
restraining is needed, um, less
restrictive interventions are
sufficient sometimes to mitigate
imminent danger, um.
In addition to this above
conditions that students living
at designated areas or without
permission, so we, we need to
intervene when we see our
students in in in a in a
dangerous situation so the bill
is a tool for teachers so we can
feel comfortable in our actions
and and we know what we are
doing is for the best of our
students, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, um,
gentle lady, we've heard
discussion about um prone.
Prone restraint, um, Mr.
Speaker, General lady, can you
describe what that looks like.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, when
you put a child face down and
physically uh with their arms
and could be restraining their
breeding. It could restraining
their way to communicate, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, um.
And they could really cause
fatalities and and trauma um in
our students, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, um, can you talk a little
bit more about what chemical
restraint looks like, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
chemical restraint, uh, as
sustained on the bill is
medication or to just control
behavior or include um
Providing
medication to the students.
To control their behavior, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Thank you, um, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and in, in, in
terms of chemical restraint,
would that be something that is
forced upon a student.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, yes,
like an injection.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, General
Lady.
Also included is among the
activities that are prohibited
is uh seclusion, uh, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, can you,
can you speak to that a little
bit more and talk about what
that looks like and how that
impacts um children who um who
that is applied to.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, uh,
seclusion should be only used uh
when it's imminent danger for
the students and always with a
line of supervision and it
should end uh in the moment of
the the situation has escalated
or the intervention the proper
intervention has taken place so
any place where the student
could be as long as somebody's
always in constantly super
somebody's constantly
supervising the student, um, any
room with a window or or the
person with the student.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
and so can you tell me the
impact not only on the student
who might experience these
different kinds of restraints,
but also on the other students
in the classroom who are uh
viewing this happening to one of
their classmates.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, this
is very traumatic, especially
for the student, but also for
the family and for the students
who had to witness this, um,
some of the students with a
special needs have a less
resilient and less resources to
recover from this trauma, so
this is an addition of uh of
whatever they are already
experiencing, so the traumatic
situation could this traumatic
situation could be uh cause an
impact in anybody around but
specifically on the students
who.
are experiencing this
situations, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
General lady. So then if I'm,
I'm to understand this
correctly, what this bill is
doing is trying to limit the
manner in which students are
restrained, be it chemical, be
it prone, be it mechanical, um,
be it seclusion so as not to
traumatize them, but so that
other methods um of intervention
are utilized instead, is that
correct, Mr. Speaker, General
lady?
Speaker lady, yes, um, we're,
we're trying to make really
clear that this type of uh
physical restraining or
seclusion should only use when
is um in a situation where the
students is in danger and we
keep repeating this when it's in
danger should be the last
resource as a as a teacher
myself and I think any educators
here in the room will have a
protocol in our classrooms that
we follow and when the adults
around us are not uh enough to
to respond to the situation of
the student.
That's physical restraint takes
place or seclusion, but with a
specific guidelines here uh
prone restriction is not allowed
chemical restriction is not
allowed, and the other uh
responses only as last resources
and should end as soon as the
situation has escalated, Mr.
Speaker, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
General lady, I see this as a uh
bill to give our teachers
additional tools, uh, to keep
the classroom safe, to keep our
kids safe, and to also.
Um, protect our, our school
staff. Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. There is the debate
the gentle lady from Dona Anna
Sokoro and Sierra Representative
Doo.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will a
gentle lady yo please.
I, Mr. Speer, I, I yelled to the
lady from um
Dona Anna Sierra Socorro. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Um,
so I, most of the conversation
has been focused on what we'll
do with juveniles and folks who
are large and my background is
an early childhood and schools
currently serve 3 years and up,
depending on the needs, they
could transition earlier out of
fit at 2.5, and many schools
have grads programs and they've
added um even 6 weeks and up. So
I'm, I'm wondering.
If you have um in on page 2 in
the definition of mechanical
restraint restraints. It
specifically addresses vehicle
safety restraints. What about
the other types of restraints
that are used with early
childhood, particularly
children, um, I, I'm thinking
of, these are, this isn't
allowed at a, at an early
childhood program in the ECECDD
side that's licensed, but are
you familiar with the term top
lock, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Mr. Speakerlano.
A top lock is a chair that I
have seen used in public schools
that it latches to the,
sometimes parents have it, you
might call it a trolley, a
traveling portable um high chair
so it attaches to the table and
children, it does have a safety
lock on it. Also for diaper
changing stations, different.
defined as a mechanical
restraint or
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies,
sorry, uh, would you repeat your
question?
The only in
The in mechanical restraints, it
does describe a vehicle safety
restraint, um, but not other.
not other objects, not other
types of restraints that would
be used with early childhood
children. I'm thinking of, um,
he, it's a portable highchair.
I've seen it used to separate
children during circle time in
public schools. They'll put
children, 3s and 4 year olds, 1
year olds, I mean, first
graders, kindergartners, they'll
put them in these chairs to do
circle time.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um, if
there is a mechanical restraint
that is prescribed by a health
care provider or authorized by a
parental consent or for a
student that is on page 2 and
number 6, that's allowed,
um,
hold on a second, let's not talk
over each other because then no
one can understand what anyone's
saying, so proceed and then
we'll go back to you, young lady
from Donana Speaker, gentle
ladies, so if this is something
that is uh the student needs
for.
For his well or her wellbeing,
so uh and it's prescribed and
parts have a con consent on this
is allowed and is part of this
bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle ladies. So I'm thinking
that the, the programs that have
DD programs, they have 3 and 4
year old programs, not all
children are potty trained. They
are now going to have to get a
separate form to give permission
for assisting with diaper
changing or putting, these
aren't prescribed by a
healthcare provider.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, uh,
here in number 6 it says does
not include adaptive devices.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, I'm
sorry, what line?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, 17.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So all
adaptive devices are able to be
used. OK, thank you for that.
Um, and then,
I, I'm confused when I'm reading
this on page 3.
Section 12 line 19, the time
out, um,
Which is a management technique
designed to address
inappropriate student. I, I'm
wondering what that definition
inappropriate means?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um, PD
has a whole paper my list a
document on list, uh, with this,
um, guidelines, but it's also
used as a teacher's discretion,
um, uh, me as a teacher, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, when my
student was I could sit and
couldn't focus, couldn't
concentrate. I will ask him to
step out aside while I would
have time to talk to him or to
her this time out is just to
redirect the student to focus
again um it's it's allowed.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle ladies. So it's very,
very specific definitions and
until we get to the word
inappropriate. Um, Mr. Speaker
and, and gentle lady, I, I
didn't quite understand where
the 504 plans come in place, uh,
Yeah, I hear the reference to
IEPs, but some children don't
have IEPs because they, it
especially when they're older,
if it's not having an impact on
their academic performance and
they're not low performing, so
they may not have an IEP but
they still may have behavioral
issues and disabilities. I, uh,
where's the clarification on
504? I, I would like to know
that.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
they, they used to have an uh a
plan set to through a sad
process and intervention listed
that is actually included in the
language in this bill. So Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, you're
saying through the SAP process
that those usually take, how
long does this process usually
take? Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I guess it depends on the
situation. I have students who
went through the process where
in the school year I have
students who were in the sad
process through 2 years I guess
it depends on the individual
needs.
of the student, Mister Speaker,
gentle lady. Thank you Mr.
Speaker, and, and thank you
gentle ladies. So in the case of
a child that doesn't have an IEP
and doesn't qualify for an IEP,
then the SAP process is, is
there going to be an update to
the rules so that this could go
quicker. I'm used to it taking
at least a semester or longer,
um, so, so does this, how would
we speed up that process, Mr.
Speaker, generally?
Me
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, uh,
there is not a set time for that
process, um, um as a teacher I
did a I was actually the sad
sharing my um to my great my
school it depends really of the
needs of the student, the
situation where we are talking
about is really not is the
resources around us and which
type of uh needs we are trying
to um help the students with Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and outside of what
you're directing in this bill,
how often is there an IEP
meeting for families?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, uh, I
think it's twice a year and I'm
gonna refer to my co-sponsor on
this bill. Give me a second, Mr.
Speaker and the lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, at
least once a year, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady, once a year is
my understanding. I know parents
who have strong advocacy skills
and are able to request more,
they, they might get to a year,
but it's my understanding, it's,
it's usually around one a year
and then this requires the team
to meet within 10 days after
every restraint. Uh, any sort of
intervention is, is that
correct, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, uh,
this is when it's a pattern when
it's more than once when it's
happening so we wanna make sure
that this is not being used as a
response to our students with
special needs is not like that
to go answer when we wanted to
respond to some specific needs
of our students, Mr. Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, so that's
when we want them to meet so
again uh this type of uh um
responses to our students should
be the last resource to address
their needs, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
And, and thank you, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady, and that's
regardless of whether the IEP
exists every incident will have
a meeting, whether an IEP exists
directing this, uh, I, I'm
thinking of like a child who has
a weighted vest or a child who
it so even if it's in their IEP
that they'll be restrained
mechanically, um, that there
will be some sort of approved um
child protective hold that's
used to cover and, you know, to
help them self-regulate that
there's still going to be this
team meeting.
Even when it's directed in the
IEP.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, when
it's part of the IP we will
refer to the I. Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, can you show, so
the, so you're saying that the
med, well, you can only have an
IP meeting if a child has an
IEP, so I'm assuming that the
meeting after the incident is
with the IEP team.
Because no other children would
have an IEP at that point.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I'm,
I'm not sure that I understand
your question when when this is
a pattern for students we wanna
make sure that we are not and we
hear in that working group there
were students who were uh in
seclusion every single day of a
school day, uh, isolated no line
of supervision as a response to
address their special needs so
this is not something that we
wanna use as a tool to to to
deal with the special needs of
our students as a res.
So when, when it's more than
once, when it's more than once
that is happening frequently
when it's a pattern that's when
we wanna make sure that his
address and find a solution for
the students, uh, so I don't,
I'm not so sure that I, I, I
respond to your question, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, so I,
children who have an IEP who
have
needs that are especially when
they're in the early childhood
stage.
Um, positive redirection and I,
I, I, and first of all, let me
just acknowledge, I think that
just the the incident you
described is absolutely
unacceptable, and I hear the
intent of preventing that. My, I
am trying to process what it
would be like at the early
childhood educator to, to put
this in
when there is a child who is not
verbal.
And is young and chooses to
bite.
Who has an IEP then we've come
to an agreement that this is the
way we will redirect them, and
it may require the teacher to
put them in like a child
protective hold to help them
self regulate and not just put
them in isolation and put them
in time out, but to hold them
and redirect them, that that
would be a physical restraint
that is in the IEP as I read it,
the parent, the IEP plan, you do
have to meet 10 days after the
incident.
And a pattern is more than one
time. I'm, that's how I'm
reading this.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, thank
you for the explanation. So if
this is a response that is
included in the IEP then it's
perfectly correct is is is is
this guidelines are clear and is
following protocol. There is no
need for a meeting. It's
following the response that it
was established to deal with the
needs special needs of the
student.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, can
you show me? I'm on page, the
bottom of page 9, 23, section B,
through um 10 lines 1 through 6.
Can you explain to me where it
says that that IEP isn't after
every incident, after the first
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, on
page 10.
Um
This actually a part when it
went more than.
with more than one or just a
occurs within a school year.
This is when this kick in. This
is not talking about um uh
responses uh IEP responses of
protocols. This is a physical
restraining and seclusion that
is not included in the IEP and
when it's more than one that's
when this this is gonna actually
uh happen.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, I,
I hear your intent. I'm not
reading it. I'm not seeing it in
the bill where it's saying that
More than one event, it was a 3
year or 4 year old when you're
teaching.
Uh, when you're working on a
redirection and a child is
developing a social-emotional
skills, an incident could occur
multiple times in a day, in a
week, while they learn a better
response as we coach them
through that. And I, I do not
see that. I see that if the
student has the individualized
education plan and an incident
occurs more than one time in a
year. I'm, that, that they are
to meet.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, so
basically if this happens and
there is a meeting with the
parents and the parents uh
consent that this is the best
way to deal with this situation
then uh there is no need for
more meetings and it talked the
bill talks about uh parents
consent so if that happens there
is a meeting and they agree that
this is the best way to follow
this uh type of incidents then
there's no need for another
meeting because it will become
part of the plans for with the
students, Mr. Speak.
gentle lady.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you, gentle ladies. So after the
2nd incident, there would be
another meeting and in the
written recommendations by the
parent, we would go back to the
earlier section where we talk.
I'm gonna go, I could see that a
parent can give permission for a
mechanical.
Accommodation.
So the parent could give an
accommodation for any.
type of
They can request a weighted vest
or I'm, I'm, and by, by the way,
I'm still focused on preschool
or something I think I'm
suggesting, or maybe a high
schooler would want that if they
have sensory integration. So the
parent is going to give written
permission, but as I read it on
page 10, each time an incident
occurs, a parent will be
notified and each time an
incident occurs, a parent can
request a meeting.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, a
parent consult can always
request a meeting, yes. Well,
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, a
parent can't always request an
IEP meeting. I mean, they can
request it, but I'd say for the
most majority of the time it's
denied. So, but my, but my
question comes to being in a
rural community where a lot of
these folks who are part of the
team, they live out of town and
so the team will come and meet
and these adaptions will be
made. Um, I'm, I'm thinking
about the cost to the district.
Really, what it looks like to
put this into application. Um,
so,
I'm wondering on page 10, on
line 24K. Why are we exempting
Juvenile detention centers or
state operated juvenile
facilities. Do we want, do we
not want these children treated
the same way. Speaker, this is
existing law. We are not
changing nothing in this area.
Mr. Speaker and gentle ladies,
so
We're going to allow um those
things to occur in those
facilities because we are
lawmakers, we change laws. Why
did you choose not to change the
law in this section for these
children.
Mr. Speaker and lady.
Uh, we are focusing on the
schools.
Uh, K to 12 schools and this is
um outside of that, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady
doesn't PED provide schooling
for the students in these
facilities?
It's just a gentle la you know.
Mr. Speaker, and Lea, they don't
have PED schools inside our
juvenile.
Facilities.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, they
are run by a different agencies.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. Um,
OK. So,
Do we know?
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, do
you know what the 10 years is of
the average superintendent?
Mr.
Lady, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
uh, 3 to 5 years. 3 to 5 years
and about 30% or less than 2
years, um, when we go to our,
our, I think the principals are
5 years, and that number is
dropping pretty steadily. Uh, is
that correct, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um.
We don't have the data, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, is it
still true that we have 700
unfilled teaching positions.
Mr. uh Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
that was the the number in
October I guess.
And Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
about um 50% of new teachers
choose to leave the field, um,
within, we have about a 50%
turnover in our new teachers is
that, what is the current
turnover rate in the new
teachers and how long they stay
in the field.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
forget I don't have to guess
because you're an expert witness
probably knows this.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, uh,
that was, uh, a trend national
trend we don't have a specific
data for our state.
So thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, but also, um, I, I,
I guess what my concern is that
we're putting in place the
mandate for an evidence-based
model with, um, a very high
vacancy rate, very high turnover
teachers on waivers and what I
think is the solution, what best
practices so shows as a solution
is this comprehensive system,
um, where we, the systems
approach. So I, I, I think about
um public education.
department and our federal
obligation to serve children in
the most restrictive or the
least restrictive, most
inclusive setting. And that
would be their typical setting.
And when I dealt with a lot of
these incidents where I felt
children were at risk of harming
themselves and others were being
transported on buses back and
forth between programs and um it
it when they get off the bus, so
that, so these children who have
an IEP who are 3 and 4 are often
bussed back and forth between a
childcare center or an ECEC.
preschool program, and they
would have to have two sets,
they do have two sets of
classrooms, 2 sets of rules, 2
sets of peers, 2 sets of
everything, and, and a lot of
times,
Because they're not able to
verbalize as other people have
said, when they get off the bus,
they run.
And so, um, what would
What would be better is if they
weren't transported between two
programs. It's a, it's a
systems, it's a comprehensive
systems change that we need to
approach. I, I see,
are children now with IEPs being
served in the least restrictive,
most inclusive setting now with
3 and 4 year olds.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
I'm not so sure how that applies
to this bill could you, um,
expand on your question, Mr.
Speaker and applies because
children are being bussed from a
childcare center where they
should receive PED early
intervention services in their
IEP to a public school, and when
they are young and they're not
able to verbalize themselves and
many times on the spectrum or
nonverbal, they, they act out by
running when they get off the
bus.
And, and, and here we're going
to put a liability and a burden
on the district whether than
doing the systems change.
And doing best practice and
serving children in the least
restrictive setting and not
making them bust back and forth.
So in, in essence, I've been
using this analogy again, it's
if it's predictable, it's
preventable and to avoid the
restraint is what the intent of
the bill is, but at a higher
level, especially with 3 and 4
year olds, we should stop
transporting them between
multiple programs when all best
practices say to serve them
where they're at.
Mr. Speaker and the lady, um, I
really don't understand how this
relate to this, uh, our bill is
actually giving tools to the
teachers saying if the student
comes out of the bus and wants
to run and I wanna protect the
student to keep him safe. I can
actually hold his hand and hold
him and it's OK, uh, some
teachers reporting the working
group that they were actually
concerned that that was OK or
not to do it, so this bill is
actually uh giving clear
guidelines to say it's OK to do
that so I'm.
not sure that I'm answering your
question, but if a student is
going from one environment to
another one and it's reacting to
this environment we are giving
clear guidelines and tools to
the teachers to say yeah you can
actually protect the kid keep
him safe by doing this.
Um, this type of, um, responses
and lady, I, I, I guess from my
perspective and where I'm having
a hard time is that we have
situations where we create the
environment where the chaos and
overstimulation can occur and
then the teacher now, and, and
by the way, um, depending on
what, how many weeks of paid
leave they have long term subs
who will not have this
evidence-based intervention and
not be allowed to do these
things where we're setting
the school district's up for
failure, and I'm putting the
numbers in my head and it seems
like a pretty huge price tag,
evidence-based interventions
costs a lot of money and they
have to be, there's a
certification involved, there's
a fee per person involved and in
rural communities, you might
spend a really high price tag to
bring this person in to provide
the, the training, and you may
have a 20-30% turnover and who
had that in the following year,
especially when we're talking
about subs.
Long term subs, 12 week subs,
um, people who are on waivers
and long-term waivers and, and
it creates an unfunded mandate
in, in my opinion, um, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, thank
you so much for your intent on
this bill. Thank you.
Seeing no further debate.
Is there more debate?
So you know for the debate and
later to close.
Thank you for the uh debate, Mr.
Speaker, uh, how's Bill 260
reflects our commitment to
fostering a safe, inclusive and
supportive learning environment
for all students recognizing the
diverse needs of our school
communities so Mr. Speaker I
move that House bill to 60 do
now pass.
We are on final passage of House
Bill 260 as amended 32nd clock
nor running in the chambers. The
vote is now open.
Well it's about to close.
Vote's not closed by a vote of
40 in the affirmative, 26 in the
negative. House Bill 260 as
amended has duly passed this
House.
Gentle lady from
Sandoval Santa Fe Towers
Representative Herrera, are you
ready? On item number 41, Mr.
Speaker, will you get me to that
point that all action necessary
for placing House Bill 252 as
amended with an emergency class
on final passage has been taken.
It is not subject to debate.
Amendment or substitution
generally to explain the bill.
Um
Uh, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Um,
this bill, uh will create in the
Department of Aging, um, uh, a,
a mechanism for helping um
kinship guardians or
grandparents raising
grandchildren, um, it will help
them navigate through the
process of how they go about,
um,
Gathering, uh, federal, state,
and local benefits that that
they are entitled to. It will
also, um.
Uh, it was also help them
navigate those structural
provide staff to help them do
that.
And um and to know what's
available, you know, a lot of
times here's what happens in our
state, uh, CIFD will call a
parent and say, uh, if you don't
find somebody tomorrow we're
gonna come and we're gonna take
your kids into foster care, so
who do they call? They call the
grandparents and the
grandparents say, of course
we'll take them and they take
them in and and all of a sudden
they have these kids and they're
trying to raise them and they're
trying to raise them on minimum
salaries. Many of them are.
Living on Social Security and,
and they're trying to do the
best job that they can, so this
was set up we set up this
program to help grandparents,
um, uh, navigate the systems and
know what's available to them.
We ran this, uh, we're running
this program through uh the
Department of Aging and we're
not running it through CYD
because nobody trusts
grandparents don't trust CYFD.
They trust the Department of
Aging and that's who they want
to, uh.
feel like they'll be comfortable
working with that department and
I worked closely with uh uh the
Secretary of Aging, uh, um,
Emily Kallenbach to design this
legislation so that it would,
would work over uh a three-year
period.
What we will do in this program
is not only provide navigators
to help them go through these
systems but we will also provide
legal counsel. A lot of these
grandparents don't know what it
means to enter into a custodial
arrangement, how much will that
cost, whether or not they'll be
eligible for uh uh a benefits
and so we will help them
navigate through that process
with legal counsel, um, uh, they
will also provide monthly
training.
Programs for these uh uh for
these grandparents or kinships
or fictive kin and let me
explain that, uh, sometimes
grandparents take these kids in
sometimes relatives take them in
their kids and sometimes it's a
neighbor or a good friend that
knows her family situation that
takes them in and say, yeah,
we'll take care of you, but they
need help they need help in
managing this and I've been
working on this, Mr. Speaker,
for about 2 years, but I could
never get.
around the anti-donation clause.
So what we did is we worked with
um uh foundations in this state
to come in and also they would
set up programs to provide a
monthly stipend for these, uh,
grandparents or kinship, uh,
relationships who are watching
over these kids and we would try
to get and they would give them
$500 a month for 3 years, so
that's, that's kind of how we've
developed this public private
partnership.
Uh, to, to create, to create
income for these, for these
people that really desperately
need it and um and um Mr.
Speaker, that pretty much uh
sums up the bill and in kind of
a nutshell, but I would like to
call on my, my co-sponsor, uh,
the representative from hm all
those counties. Let me get them
straight, uh.
Bernalio uh Cibola McKinley San
Juan Zaccorro, and Valencia, uh
representative.
Thank you Speaker. Thank you,
Representative Herrera. I'm so
proud to be co-sponsoring this
bill with you, and it's so
important. That story that you
just shared was me. I was that
kid who was raised by my
grandmother and my grandmother
could have used these resources,
but she held out for fam.
Family reunification.
Family reunification is always
our first choice. We want
children to be with their
families, their parents
specifically, and grow up in
that family unit for me
unfortunately that did not
happen. Years later, my
grandmother found the help of a
local community advocate who
helped her navigate through the
guardianship system within the
court.
I think my grandmother for
raising me because that changed
my life. That's why I'm here
with you today, passing this
bill so that so many New
Mexicans who are raising their
grandchildren who are kinship
caregivers or fit of kin
caregivers can have these
resources. Additionally, I think
that this pilot program is just
the start of something that will
expand across the state and
we'll be able to help other
counties, but for now I'm very
proud to stand alongside you and
support this initiative because
while we were out.
They're talking with our
communities, this was a huge
concern that was always brought
to our attention by almost every
representative in this building
today. Thank you,
Representative.
General Ledy from all from all
those counties back to you. Uh,
thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you, uh, um, um, uh
representative. I, what I'd like
to say is it it wasn't until I
realized a way to get around the
anti-donation clause that I came
up with this idea, so having the
foundations give out that
monthly stipend. We hold $500
that's what we're planning on
$500 a month for 3 years will
help stabilize some of these
families and.
these, uh these grandparents and
other kin that are raising these
kids in a meaningful way and uh
that's why I'm putting this uh
bill forward and uh my expert
witness today, uh, for this body
is the secretary our secretary
of aging, uh, Emily Katenbach,
and uh with that, Mr. Speaker, I
stand for questions. There is
lady from Berlin and Torrens,
Representative Lord. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, the gentle lady
from Rio Riba Sandoval, Santa
Fe, and Taos, please yield. Yes,
I, I yield to the kind lady.
Thank you.
Uh, I do have some questions,
uh, about this, so Mr. Speaker
gentleman, when
What we're saying we're making
an appropriation he struck that
out is that because it is in the
budget summary, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
yes, it has already been, it's
already in the House Bill 2 at
$4 million.
OK, so go back here to page 5.
It's also been
It's been I'm, I'm looking at
the amendments in context
because I have to look at it
that way. So Mr. Joya, I thought
that's what it was, but I just
went to the last page.
Of the amendments and contexts,
and it shows there it struck out
the whole appropriation part on
this,
like, can you show me where it's
at with.
The
A
house built 252 and I'm looking
at the amendments in context.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
it's, it's not in the bill
because it's in the House bill
to budget.
OK, Mr. Speaker, but there's no,
I'm sorry, I'm just asking, but
I'm not totally against your
bill. What I, what I'm trying to
get some clarification on, when
I look at the last page of
amendments in context and maybe
I misunderstanding the whole
part of the amount is struck
out. It shows 4,500,000 is
appropriate in the gender fund
that's also been stricken out,
Mr. Speaker Den later, or am I
looking at the wrong thing and
the, uh, amendments and context,
uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
as I understand it, it's because
it's already been approved by
this house and it.
is contained in House Bill 2.
OK, Mr. Speaker Julie, and I
understand that would just be
nice if it had, because when you
look at this, it actually
doesn't show the amount. So Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, is that
for one year, what is the time
frame in that, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, uh, Mr. Speaker,
and, uh, gentle lady, uh, the
time frame is for 3 years. It's
a pilot program, uh, under the
Grow fund, uh, and, uh, and, uh,
it's for 3 years because we
wanted to give kind of a
stability to these families and
so that's why we decided to do
it for a 3 year period.
And Mr. Speaker and gentle lady
at the end of 3 years is that
when they're going to come back
and say this program had some
issues or it was a success
they're gonna come back to the
legislators and ask us we'd like
more funding for this based on
data is that when that's gonna
happen, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
that's exactly what will happen
the, the advantage of being in
the growth fund is that you have
a built-in evaluation process
that's, that's very important
because this is this is an idea
it will provide a proof of
concept, how
Well, does this work, uh, we'll
be learning things as we go
along, uh, the, the idea, of
course, uh, if we could expand
it to all the families that
needed, that'd be great, but we
don't know that yet and so, so
it really is a pilot project,
uh, with the best intentions
under the real program to to see
how this will work will it make
a significant difference in the
lives of families. That's what
we wanna know, Mr. Jolie, that's
a great answer. I understand
completely we're trying to get
out with this with the money
that's been appropriated.
Can you explain to me, so that
is for.
The employees and employees that
are handling this are only hired
for 3 years, Mr. Speaker
Delaney.
Um, uh, Mr. Speaker, kind lady,
uh, right now it's only for 3
years, um, it is my intention
hopefully this body will uh like
this concept, like, like the
evaluation process see good
things come out of it and then
hopefully we'll expand it.
There's also legislation before
this body to do away with the
anti-donation clause. I don't
know what will happen with that,
but there's a lot of things in
action here, but the most
important thing is that families
need help right now.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, uh,
would that, is there going to
be, are they gonna use an office
space or is it gonna be a new
building built for them? How
does that play out, Mr. Speaker
Dell, or is it done internally?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, and kind lady,
I, I think they're, you know,
aging has offices all over in
every county, so I, I don't
think we'll be building new
buildings at this point. I, I
think we can use existing
resources. You're talking about
probably 3 staff people in, in,
in these areas we're told we're
trying to serve uh 50 families
in each of these communities and
so it's a total of 250 families,
so I don't think anybody's gonna
need a new building. I think
they can find office space that
exists.
Mr. Speakerilley, I'm glad to
hear that. um, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, um, could you, so
that everybody knows we're
talking about because um not a
lot of people understand fictive
kin. Would you like to explain
that a little bit, Mr. Speaker
Delaney? Uh, it, Mr. Speaker,
yes, thank you for that
question.ictive kin would be um
maybe these kids have a um a
close family um neighbor who
really kind of is watching over
them too at the same time and
and I think we all know.
the worst day in a kid's life
who's in foster care is being
taken to a foster care system
that it's, it's terrible. So if
a if a friend of the family
knows that they have problems
and would be willing to take
these kids and, and they often
do, they often do that that
those people, uh, these kids
would be placed with a so-called
fictive chem so they're not
really their kin, but, but they
act like they're almost, you
know, we all have friends that
are probably like family, so
that's what I'm talking about.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentle lady,
and thank you for explaining
that because it was something I
learned going through the whole
CYFD process is what Vic can it
could be a neighbor, somebody
who somehow is some sort of
relationship to the child and so
what we're saying what you're
seeing in this bill because the
kinship, I don't see
anything that has any
restrictions, so it could be
theicive can, it could be the
grandparent, uh, and a kinship
caregiver means a grandparent,
next kin or anyone who's raising
the person and next of kin. So
all of those.
the following people that could
be raising the child, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, kind lady, yes.
Mr. Speaker, lady that, uh, that
I don't have any issues with
that because anything that keeps
kids out of CYFDA is always a
good thing, Mr. Speaker, that
lady.
So Mr. Speaker Delaney, on page
3.
Development and implement a
pilot program communities
located in Rio Riba Santa Fe
Tows McKinley, and Dona Anna.
Was there data? do you have data
for that or why were those 5
particular counties or why were
my counties left out too, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, uh, Mr.
Speaker, kind lady, that is
everybody's question. I totally
get it, uh, if I could have done
every county, I would. I, I was
working on a timeline. I had 5
foundations that kind of stepped
up to the to the plate and
sometimes foundations have.
Service areas that they serve
and, and they agreed to do it in
these counties if I ran out of
time and uh the bill is before
you now.
Mr. Speaker, generally, so who
is going to be the people that
are in charge of making sure.
Uh, where this child is going
to, is that still refer back to
CFD, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Uh, right now foundations work
with nonprofits in their
communities and they were and
the there's already kind of a, I
don't know uh.
I don't know how to call a
network I guess an informal
network of, of, uh, grandparents
raising grandkids and they try
to help each other out but they
really have very little
resources and foundations were
really kind of looking for a way
to help them, uh, uh, but they
didn't have a program to do it
with. So, so this is really kind
of formalizing uh that network,
uh, they will each foundation
will work with their community.
It might run through a community
nonprofit.
It might run through a
foundation. It just depends on
the on the local um community
involved.
OK, Mr. Speaker Julian, I wanna
make sure I understood so I
didn't quite understand that, so
we have a child and we quickly
need to get them out of the
household for whatever situation
is happening and then they're
not going to CUFD so now there's
gonna be other organizations
that's gonna determine where to
place this child, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady.
Um, I, Mr. Speaker, kind lady, I
really want you to understand
it's separate from CYFD. These
are not CYFD referrals. These
are referrals in the local
community. They will contact the
Department of Aging or the aging
department might hear about it
or a foundation or a community
organization nonprofit might
hear about a family like this
and refer them to the Department
of Aging. It does not have
anything to do with CYFD.
OK, Mr. Speaker, generally, uh,
and that's fine. I, I don't want
CYFD involved in most anything,
sorry. uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, but what is the criteria?
So if we have people, we have a
child and we're trying to
connect them is there anybody
that is doing a background check
on these people. I want to make
sure they're not a sexual
predator. Is there anybody
looking to see if they ever
harmed children their arrest
records, who is looking into
their background, Mr. Speaker,
young lady, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I'd, I'd like to say most
of the.
these kids are already in a
kinship relationship or they're
already with the grandparent,
they're just not receiving any
money from CYD or they're not
receiving any money or any
benefits at all because they
just took these kids in so
they're already raising these
children and they do it at no
cost to the state and they're
just doing it by themselves, so
they, so um no, these kids went
over to a grandparent or a tin
or a family friend of their of
their own free will with the
parent.
Probably asking them to do that
and so they've already taken on
these responsibilities.
Mr. Speaker, generally, I, I
understand that. I, I just see a
slight problem with that and
that, uh, even with COYFD
referral, we had CYFD give a
child back to a sexual predator,
and that was a horrific
situation for the child for 3
days. That's why I'm always
trying to make sure, even though
it could be a grammar gram, it
doesn't mean that there are
necessarily the best person they
are because they're trying to
raise a child, but for me, I
would like to see at least
somebody doing some sort of
background check on this person,
checking the house making sure
it's, it's, it's a good
establishment.
So Mr. Speaker, generally, is
there anybody going to the house
to make sure everything is OK at
that house, young lady.
Mr. Speaker, kind lady, thank
you for asking that question.
Yes, in the program we're gonna
have monthly home visits. We're
gonna have monthly seminars
where they get training and help
and guidance and legal
consultation, um, so again we
aren't placing kids. These kids
have already gone to the into
these relationships with the
consent mostly of their parents
or mostly they just came in and
took them because no one was
taking care of them.
And Mr. Speaker Jolene, I'm
gonna assume the next question
would be that if there was a
situation where there was
neglect or abuse happening and
then that next step would be a,
a CFD referral. Is that correct,
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, Mr.
Speaker and Kalani, although
that's not in the legislation,
that's certainly the purpose of
monthly home visits, you know,
sometimes you see things that
shouldn't be there. Yeah, Mr.
Lady, we actually have a, a bill
later on to that talks about
neglect and whatnot so I
familiarize myself with that and
how law enforcement when they
enter a house or.
looking for a certain criteria
of things, so there is at least
a, a guard rail there or someone
could at least say, hey, we went
to this home visit, we need
somebody to check on it, so
that's not an issue. I just, of
course, go back to I'd like to
have the background check done a
little bit. So Mr. Speaker and
John lady, um, we're developing
a criteria for consideration
shall include a kinship
caregiver current household
income and needs for the child
or children. Can you tell me a
little bit more about how we are
going to decide which families
are gonna get help and which
families are not.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, and, uh, kind
lady, I, you know, I think we'll
probably the the local
communities and the local
foundations, it's, it's my, it's
my uh experience that they will
probably start with the uh
grandparents or kinship parents
or fictive parents that are, uh,
probably in the most in need. I,
I think it'll start there and
then they'll they'll work their
way out. I, you know, this isn't
very many placements in each
community. It's, it's 50
placements.
And what I have seen with these,
I've spent a lot of time with
these grandparents raising
grandkids and I'm always amazed
if, if we ever try to give them
any help they will say.
Susan, if somebody needs this
more than me, give it to them.
Even though they may need it
desperately, they always ask
that question, so, so I hope,
you know, it's, it's my hope
that we'll reach out to the
people in the most need to begin
with.
And Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
I have an amendment that I'm
really hoping that you will
think is friendly. It actually
does with that exact thing that
we're looking for families that
are very low income and that
children that are that are need
the most, uh, to be put first
and foremost. So Mr. Speaker, I
have an amendment I'd like to
present lady, please bring it to
the well, uh, make sure it is
signed and then uh as soon as I
have it, we'll go through the
number and get it passed out. I
think I like a role.
Thank you.
Gentle lady, what is that number
on the bottom left?
Mr. Speaker, it is 231-489.1.
That's what I've got. We'll get
the sergeants to pass the
amendment out and we'll post it
online, stand by. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
Yeah, it looks like the
amendments been passed out,
young lady, and it is online,
the gentle lady to explain the
amendment. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. All in this amendment,
I'm hoping that you might find
it friendly. All I'm trying to
say is let's
Take the families that are below
200% of the federal poverty
level and that would be for a
grandma and a child, 21,150 and
let's prioritize the children
who have been through protective
custody hearings and based on
allegations, so I'm looking for
kids who've been abused,
neglected, and our poorest
families just to be at the first
of the line that's all I'm
asking for, Mr. Speaker, and
gentle lady back to the sponsors
is this a friendly amendment?
Speaker, this is not a friendly
amendment. I would like to
reply.
Um, if you look at page 3,
section 3 line 1 it says develop
and implement processes and
eligibility criteria for our
kinship caregivers, uh, to apply
to and become participants in
the pilot program criteria for
consideration shall include a
kinship caregiver's current
household income, and the needs
of the children are children
that are or will be cared for
and supported by the kinship
caregiver, so I think we've
taken care of this already, Mr.
Speaker, and kind lady
and Mr. S.
Is there a debate on the
amendment, gentlemen from Otero
on the amendment.
Thank you gentle lady from
Torrance and Bernard Leo, please
yield. Maybe no. Yes, Mr.
Speaker.
tell him and I will yield.
Oh wow, Mr. Speaker. OK, so Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I, I
understand the amendment and I
do have some questions because.
When I'm, when I'm making policy
here, which is
Rare if a bill doesn't get
tabled immediately, but if it
does get through, which some of
them do, Mr. Speaker.
I do try to, to limit my 11.
I know, Mr. Speaker, I have
what? A lot of, a lot of days. I
have like over
40 something days, 49 days. So
Mr. Speaker, that does give me
some hope actually.
But when it comes to this bill
and this amendment, so we're
we're specifically saying that
the department shall prioritize
participation by kinship
caregivers. And so from what I
heard, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady from the gentle lady from
Ri Riba and all those other
beautiful amazing counties was.
That the department was already
going to be promulgating rules.
This just kind of guides those
rules. Is that what I
understand, Mr. Speaker
generally. Yes, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, that's exactly what I
do because I like to see some
very specific guardrails in
there. So we have in here
current household income with no
definition of what that means
and the needs of the child that
will be cared for and I'm
looking at kids who have already
been through a traumatic
experience, kids involving abuse
and neglect, I think those
should be the kids that we want
to put in.
The front of the line. That's
all I'm asking for in this, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and I appreciate
that, and I think that's
something that we all want. We
wanna make sure that kids are
safe and protected. And so when
it comes to being the subject of
a protective custody hearing.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, what
this language then veer into the
CYFD realm because Mr. Speaker,
General lady, I know we're
talking about aging. This is the
department of aging. Wouldn't
this kind of veer into that
realm in any way? No, I'm being
gentle lady, I try to do
everything
to bear anywhere near CYFD. So
what this would do is a
protective custody hearing.
Children that have already
suffered from abuse and neglect,
and there's a long, I mean, I
have all the definitions for
neglect because it's actually
one of the bills that we're
hearing later today in CPAC, and
there's a lot of definitions in
there, including abandonment,
uh, child who suffered serious
harm, physical abuse, emotional
abuse, psychological abuse, and
this is under 34.
4 - 2 NMSA. These are the
definitions a child who's been
left for so many time alone, a
child who has suffered sexual
abuse or sexual exploitation,
um, anyone who intends or
negligently place the child in a
situation to endanger their
life, uh, torture, rape, all of
those things would fall under
that, and I feel that those kids
are the most in need, um,
because there's different types
of neglect. There is passive
neglect, passive neglect means
somebody
has got addicted to drugs and
they're not taking care of a
child as well as they should and
they're not getting consistent
meals. I feel that those
children are just as important,
however, a child that has um
direct neglect is a child who's
been beaten, abused, tortured,
raped, all of the following. I
feel that those children should
be at the front of the line for
this pilot project, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I don't know if you
know the numbers, but how many
kids?
Or could be in that.
Bucket of kids who have had
these horrific experiences, as
you said, sexual exploitation,
uh, abandonment, uh, other kinds
of terrible things, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, do we, do we know
if that's a large part of the
population who are in this
kinship care or I just don't
know much about it. So I'm just
trying to get some more
information on that, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady. Mr.
Speaker and, and gentlemen, that
that's a great question, which
I'll look for you later, but
here's the deal it doesn't
matter if it's 500 or it's 1. If
a county they have a, a
grandparent or anybody who's
taking care of the child and
they're making less than 20,000,
$21,150 a year and they have a
child that's been through a
horrific situation. I'm just
asking for that one out of the
25 others that they'd be put at
the front of the line and put in
this pilot study, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. I, I think that's
interesting, um, I like, I like
your amendment. I don't, I
actually don't love it. I'm
sorry, I must you speaker,
gentle lady. I actually, I'm
inclined not to support it, to
be honest with you, because
I, I find it kind of
discriminatory to
Do it based on income.
And how could you alleviate
those concerns for me, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, if you
move to table my bill, I will
never speak to you for the rest
of my life.
I'm just saying that right out
in the public. The reason, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, I'm gonna
use my grown-up voice is because
this is to give people money
that need the money to help
raise a child is to incentivize
people to instead of allowing
the child to go into CYFD.
To instead keep that child in
the family.
Did that answer your question,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen?
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. It did actually, I think
it actually alleviated some of
those concerns really quickly.
But Mr. Speaker, uh, so I get
it, you know, we want, we want
these families to be helped and
unfortunately the government is
the one doing that, which I
don't agree with, but at least
if it's going to have to do it,
I think the people most in need
probably should be at the front
of the line, which I guess is
probably the point, Mr. Speaker,
General lady. Yeah, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, you can be back
on my friends list.
Um, so what I'm trying to say is
this whole bill is to encourage
families to keep the culture
with the child. If a child is
raised in a certain culture, the
family's gonna have that same
culture. We're trying to keep
that child in the culture with
people that they know with
people they feel comfortable
with. We're trying to keep them
in a household that is safe and
sane and not put them into the
CYFD program when they may end
up sleeping in offices, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Generally, I
think we all agree on that one.
We don't want any kids to be
sleeping in offices, we
definitely want to be putting
these people in.
Families where they are more
comfortable and I think that
that could be something.
They could be beneficial in your
amendment. So I think your
amendment makes the bill better,
and I really hope that it does
go through.
With the amendment
So thank you, Mr. Speaker, I
guess that's all I had.
There's more debate on the
amendment, lady from Donana
Sierra Secora Representative
down. Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
the gentle lady yield?
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I'm a little
hesitant after representative
block's reports, yes, I rene my
time, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, I was so excited about
this bill. I was excited about
to see where it went and hope
that it went statewide. You
brought up some concerns that,
that, that I want to go a little
bit deeper with you in. Um, you
mentioned
that, what was your concern
about someone who may have a
criminal background, uh, being
eligible for this. Can you
explain that a little more? Oh
yeah, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, uh, one of the
Bills that actually have drafted
right now is to, before we give
a child to anybody, we should
just be checking to see that
this person is not somebody who
has abused a child in any way
has ever been arrested for
neglect and isn't on the um
sexual predator list, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, gentle
lady, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, if your bill was
incorporated into this bill,
what would that, what would that
look like? Would it be a
background check? Yes, Mr. would
just be a basic, I mean, you can
get that information, the
money's in the budget it.
doesn't take that long, Mr.
Speaker, gentle ladies, to go
into the computer system, do a
background check on this person
or if they're gonna be using all
this money to allot it so that
somebody else can debt is a
professional can do the
background check. We're looking
for any time they've been
arrested for neglect or abuse of
a child, which I listed all the
things out. It can be passive or
it can be uh a very direct abuse
case and what we're trying to
see is is this person fit? Is
this person OK to raise the
child. I mean, we already know
that there's an issue with
income because they need
assistance.
And that is not the issue at
all. It's how they ever abused a
child, have they ever sexually
assaulted a child and are they
on the sexual, um, assault list,
I mean the sexual predator list,
Mr. Speaker, thank you, gentle
lady. So on the, the income
eligibility, do you, did you
I, I heard a statistic around
26% of children in New Mexico
are being raised by their
grandparents.
Mr. Speaker, I would not be
surprised by that at all, and I
know that and being on Social
Security, you have a fixed
income, you only have so many
dollars to deal with and even in
that case we want to make sure
we do something to supplement
these people so that they can
keep the children in the family
or at least close to the family,
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, and
so I, I, I feel like the
priority, you may not need the
priority in some of these
counties when you look at the
income level, but by including
Santa Fe and having
not income-based, then you could
see, I mean, I don't know what
the average income is in Santa
Fe, but it's much higher. So, I
mean, but even, even that, even
at that point, it's almost like.
I mean, there's some pretty
wealthy families in Santa Fe,
and there would be probably more
than 50 children with the, the
number that they have here,
that, I mean, there are
unincorporated areas that would
need it most, but even in that
case, like, let's say a family
is able to provide, this seems
to be kind of in trend with the
behavior of this body in
prioritizing folks who are low
income. I wonder, you know,
Mr. Speaker Jo may understand
what you're saying. What I want
to make sure is when they just
have current household income, I
don't know what that means is
that 50,000, 60,000, you know,
are we just in for Santa Fe?
What I'm saying is we want
people who are way below the
poverty line who need it the
most to be at the top of the
line, the people that really
deserve it and really need the
help, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, I,
I see what you're saying, and,
um,
It makes sense. So is, is the
part of your bill, is it all
about income level?
No, Mr. Speaker, and gentle
lady, it also has to do with
making sure that our children
who have been through protective
custody hearings that involve
abuse and neglect, and I went
through all the list of neglect
and what that means that those
children that have been in
neglected are the ones are the
first and foremost at the top of
the list, Mr. Speaker, gentle
Lady. Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, and I, I don't know that
it's, I have seen substantiated
cases of abuse and neglect, even
when it substantiated
the children were never removed
from the home. And even when it
was substantiated, they were not
in state custody. I'm with you.
I mean, I, I'm thinking of
several families that stepped up
when children needed help and
CYFD was never called. I think
Representative Armstrong has
given her personal story, but
there's many, many like that.
And I definitely want to support
those types of families, um, and
help them avoid a CYFD
intervention in the courts, of
course, um, at all.
Possible, but that may not be
based on income. So, um, is it
an either or is it a both and?
Mr. Speed and Delay, it's an and
we're looking for children that
have been abused and families
that are the lowest income that
need that money per month and
need all those resources to help
them get by to keep that child
within the family unit and an
extension but in within the
family unit. Yeah, so I think
that um this makes sense in for
the, for the metropolitan area.
I don't even know how they're
going to reach 50 families in
one year. Maybe, maybe there are
a lot more of this going on than
we know of, and
the rural areas, um,
That's a, that's a high number
of folks.
I guess if you add kinship care
and relative care and especially
if you add a fictive care, those
could be temporary situations.
So, um, it makes sense to me for
the, for Santa Fe for sure, and
Donana where the pop, you know,
Joanna is the 2nd most populated
county in the state, you can get
to 50 quick, um, even in
programs where a service
provider covers several
counties, um, you can see, for
example, let's say a home
visiting provider covers 4
counties.
But they're contracted for 500.
Children, they could use all
those 500 slots just in Donana
or when they have multiple
counties and, and they cover a
Bernalo or Santa Fe, they could
use all those slots in one
metropolitan area that we see
that with veteran services, we
see it with housing, access to
housing assistance, and all
different types of programs
where workforce Investment Act,
those dollars get used in the
metropolitan area. So there's a
benefit of doing it by county,
but your idea of looking at
income levels.
is what I see on trend in this
body, where you get it to the
kids who need it most first.
Right, Mr. Speaker, generally,
this what this whole bill is
about the whole bill in here I'm
not digressing way from it. I'm
just saying you want to make
sure that you're getting these
people that need the help, more
than likely on a fixed income,
how can we help them financially
and how can we make sure these
kids are put in a safe situation
and with that comes looking at
some sort of guide rails that
say, OK, the, this is a
household.
low income and these child these
children are being abused and
neglected, so we want to make
sure that those are put up at
the very, very top of the list
so they get the care that they
need, which I feel should be a
priority, Mr. Speaker,
generally, because otherwise, to
be honest, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, I have no idea what
the criteria is gonna be for
this. We don't know. I have no
idea how this is gonna work out,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen
gentle lady, thank you.
There's further debate on the
amendment, lady from Santa Fe,
Representative Romero. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, the gentle
lady yield?
Uh, yes, I do, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. Uh, thank you, Mr.
Speaker. I'm just trying to get
my head wrapped around the
process that is, um, provided
here mostly on the uh firstly, I
just, I disagree with the
federal poverty level, I think
when we're trying to look at a
pilot, and we know that 75% of
children are born into poverty
in New Mexico, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, we need to just
understand that everyone's
pretty much essentially
potentially, um,
Falling in the category of a
need, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
without having to make a
determination in statute, um, so
I'm just gonna disagree with
that one, but Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady on page 3 line 7
when you bring in this, um,
Second Amendment around um
protective custody hearings in
the process that 1 may go
through, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, um, are you aware that the
current, um, bill is talking
about aging and long-term
services, and you're now
bringing CYFD into this bill,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, to address
your first question, this is not
mandated. It's not saying you
can only take this income. What
I'm saying is, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, that this is a step
to say when we look.
all of these kids, let's say
there's 20 children that they're
looking at. I want the income
that is the lowest income and
the people who need the most
help just be at the top of the
list. It's not an only.
Secondly, when someone goes,
when there is a protective
custody order, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, because I've
learned this a lot with CFD.
There's an option for placement
for a child. They do not have to
stay within the CYFD program and
that's where I don't want them
to be anyways, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, so I would hope
that a uh.
Victive relation uh kinfective
relationship would be somewhere
we could put the child into a
family, uh, Mr. Speaker,
generally, just like they do
with any child that is who was
born like let's say the Navajo
Nation they try to keep that
within the family, and I would
rather have them stay where
they're from then keeping them
in CYFD and this is an incentive
to for the family to say OK, I'm
gonna get some help. I can take
this child into my life, Mr.
Speaker and John lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
think that's the point of the
pilot that we're trying to get
out with the folks that are
already in that kinship care,
already in that kinship
situation already.
Essentially in that space of
having that protection, having
that ability to understand
what's going on. This is about
grandparents raising
grandchildren, something that
happens in my family at the
moment. So when we look at what
we're trying to pilot here, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, CYFD
already has a process that's
very separate from this as to
abuse and neglect and and in
bringing in even the, the
process that the hearing process
that, um, I had to look up
within.
32A3B7, there's a whole process
for that. It doesn't provide a
determination. It doesn't
provide a background check,
bringing in CYFD into this
process models essentially the
entire pilot that we're trying
to propose here, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and essentially
removes the ability for aging
and long-term services to have
that authority over this in
placement and now brings CYFD
into it, which again, is not at
all the intent of this bill, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, and maybe
log rolling as to even the
authority, we're going to have
to change the title of this as
well. I think without, um,
including the Department of CYFD
into this bill as well, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, was
that a questioner I kind of
reply to that.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
think the question is, was it
your intent to, to try to bring
multiple, um, agencies into this
bill when it was very clearly
stated by the gentle lady from,
um, Rio Reba that this was about
kinship, guardianship within the
realm of aging and long-term
services. Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, uh, like I said before, I
don't want CFD involved in
anything and we didn't have a
lawyer's look at this and it's
not log rolling. What we're
saying is it's not mandated it's
saying that this child you know.
have a child, you're doing your
study, OK, this child is living
in a very.
I would say poverty stricken
situation where they need the
most help and they come forward
and they say this child has been
abused and neglected. It has
nothing to do with CYFD at that
point, especially if they're
already under the care of their
grandparents, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, if you
look at the protective,
protective custody hearing that
is required of what you're
bringing into this bill with
kinship guardians, when we're
looking at placement and we're
looking at the, the hearing
itself, and I think your intent,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, was
about background checks, was
about, um, going through this
process of this protective
custody hearing, and yet, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, the
hearing itself is a, is a
provision that helps CYFD make
the.
determinations, not aging and
long-term services and is
certainly far removed from that.
But Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
just disagree with the amendment
and I would encourage the body
to vote it down.
Mr. Speaker, I moved to Table
House floor amendment number 1
to House Bill 252 as amended. We
have a motion to table amendment
number 1 to House Bill 252 as
amended with an emergency
clause, a vote of yes, and the
amendment would have been tabled
a vote of no, we're back on the
amendment 32nd clock. The vote.
is now open.
Well, it's about to close.
The vote is not closed my vote
of 40 in the affirmative, 21 in
the negative house floor
amendment number 1 to House Bill
252 as amended with an emergency
clause has been tabled.
Gentle lady from Berlin and
Torrance, you still have the
floor. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
So, um.
Gentlelani, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, so what we've discovered
in this is that there is no
criteria, Mr. Speaker and gentle
ladies, just whatever anybody
comes up with, there's no
criteria, there's nothing
specific, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
of course there's criteria, and
we've outlined in this bill that
the Department of Aging will do
the following things and you may
not agree with it, but everybody
else is in uh agreement with how
this should be developed and how
it should be run as a pilot
program.
You're absolutely correct, Mr.
Speaker and generally I do not
agree with this because there is
no criteria. It says they're
going to look at household
income, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, can you tell me what that
household income is?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
it will be set uh by uh criteria
developed by the uh Department
of Aging.
And Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
what is our criteria going to
be?
Mr. Speaker and uh lady, uh, I
think their criteria will be
set, uh, within the states, uh,
census information and local
community information, and I
think it's very clear. I don't
think this is a difficult
decision to make.
It's just being Delaney, I
disagree. I think this is a very
difficult situation to make
because you're asking us to pass
a bill or I don't know what the
household income is going to be
and what the requirements are
going to be. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, even if they look
at stats and data, can you give
me some sort of idea of what
this household income is going
to be set at and if there's
gonna be a priority for people
who make less income versus
people who make more income,
just basic questions, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
think I've answered that and the
question is, I feel confident
that the Department of Aging can
do this.
Well, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, I would definitely
disagree with you because I
don't know what that is. So Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, what
does it mean by the needs of the
child, Mr. Singelli, and how are
they going to determine that?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, and kind lady,
I think they will do an
assessment of the these are
already kids that are living
with their grandparents are
living with their kids. They
haven't gone through the CYFD
process. These are kids that are
already in placement and they
need help and we're gonna try
and give them help by giving
them a monthly stipend of $500 a
month for 3 years. It's a pilot
project and the department of
aging will work with local
communities and local
As who know a lot about what the
state of childhood is in this in
New Mexico and they will help
develop those criteria.
So Mr. Speaker and young lady,
somebody could be eligible for
$500 a month, Mr. Spier and
gentle lady, if they made
$100,000 a year, what's the
cutoff for the income, Mr.
Speaker and John Lady?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
I'm, I'm sure there will be a
cutoff, and I'm sure it won't be
$100,000 a year. I think you're
getting to a ridiculous
assumption in this. Well, Mr.
Speaker, generally I'd say it's
ridiculous that we don't know
what that amount is going to be.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
when we move forward with this,
since we don't have any
guardrails, we don't know what's
happening on this pilot project,
so they're gonna identify and
coordinate access to federal and
state and local programs, Mr.
Speaker and Johnny, what federal
programs are they available and
how much could.
they'd be making off of these
federal programs, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady.
I'm sorry, would you repeat that
question?
Absolutely, Mr. Speaker, young
lady. It's on page 3, number 3.
I'm looking at amendments and
context, identify and coordinate
access to federal programs also
state and local, so with the
federal programs, what kind of
federal programs would they be
eligible for and that would be,
and would that be something that
would be assisting them
financially and how much would
that be, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
most of these kids were probably
eligible for Medicaid, uh, and,
and some grandparents might know
that right now, uh, what you
should know is that uh you can
apply uh to be a kinship
caregiver and get a notary to
authorize this and then you
would be eligible for rights to
uh decisions at the school and
you would be eligible for
Medicaid, so but a lot of
grandparents don't know that and
so part of this process is.
To to educate them about what
benefits would be available to
these children, uh, through this
process that's why we're doing
this pilot program.
And Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
with that person, which looks
like they're almost acting like
an ombudsman. Are they going to
sit with them and help them fill
that paperwork out or just tell
him about it, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
I'm sorry, uh, repeat that
question please, Mr. Speaker,
kind lady. So Mr. Speaker
Delaney, so the person that will
be helping them, they're kind of
like an ombudsman. They're
trying to plug them in all these
programs, so are they going to
sit down with them, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady, when it comes
to new faith, uh, federal or
state and local programs, Mr.
Silly and sit with them and show
them how to fill it out, fill it
out for them, or they're just
going to tell them about them,
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady, I
think they'll help them to the
degree of help that they need
they'll work with them, they'll
see what they need, they'll tell
them what their options are, uh,
it's needed they'll provide
legal help so yes, the whole
point is to is to have them have
a relationship with this person
that they trust within the
department of aging, which is a
department they usually trust
and they will help them navigate
them through these different
programs that we have at the
federal at the state and.
At the local level there's a lot
there's a foundation in in my
area that if anybody needs a
bed, they just give them a bed
so it's, it's, it's, it's
gathering those local those
resources that we have for for
people who need help and we want
them to know how to access them
and how to how to get the things
that they desperately need.
So Mr. Speaker and John Lee, so
we go to the next page of page
4, it says determines the
requirements necessary to use
federal assistance, which you
just talked about our resources
including tidal 6, no 543 E of
the Federal Social Security Act.
I'm gonna go with Roma numbers.
So, um.
Mr. Speaker Deli, can you please
explain this title act of the
Federal Social Security Act and
funding and how much that would
give them.
It, uh, Mr. uh Mr. Speaker and
kind lady, if they're, if
they're getting a Social
Security income if they're a
legal guardian there are
benefits that are, are given to
them.
that they have to go through
that process, fill out the
application, fill out the form,
and that's what these people
would help them do.
Oh, hi, you, Mr. Speaker. um,
Mr. Speaker and Dana lady, um,
can you tell me, so is it a
would they get an increase in
social security or they're
applying for SSI or what are
they applying for that would
give them this extra income, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, and, uh, lady,
the child can get um benefits if
their grandparent is a legal
guardian.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
can you give me an estimate of
how much that child would be
receiving every month for
benefits from Social Security,
Mr. Speaker John Laney.
Uh, Mr. uh, Speaker, and, uh,
kind lady, it really depends on
the household income that's how
that's distributed and I would
have to get back to you on the
form that laid that out.
So Mr. Speaker, and young lady,
can you give me any sort of idea
because I'm trying to figure out
if this person is eligible and
they apply for this thing that I
have no idea what it is, and
they get money from the Federal
Social Security Act. I'd like to
know a range is it like $25? Is
it $2500? How much is it that
the child's gonna be getting
that you would anticipate based
on some sort of range.
Mr. Speaker, I'd have to get
kind lady. I just have to get
back with you on that. I don't
know that offhand.
Mr. Speaker Dela, it's your
bill, and I'm trying to figure
out if we're gonna give this
family an extra $500. I'd kind
of like to know what they're
going to get, um, on the federal
level, Mr. Speaker, because if
it's a big chunk of money, then
I'm gonna question why we're
giving this extra $500
especially if it takes them far
beyond the um.
poverty level, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. uh, Mr. Speaker,
and, uh.
And kind lady, uh, we're not
giving them the money. The
foundations are giving them the
money, so that's what you need
to understand. We are providing
the service, the foundations are
giving the money. This is no
cost to New Mexico taxpayers.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady
with this foundation, how are
they gonna take that into
consideration if I have got 10
children and let's say one of
the counties and one of the
families is making $2150 a month
in this poverty level, but the
other family is getting the
Social Security and they're
making an extra 1000 so you're
saying that both are on the same
playing field. They're both
eligible for this program, Mr.
Speaker and gentle ladies, is
that what I'm understanding?
Mr. Speaker and kind lady, what,
what you need to understand is
that they will make the
decisions at the local level
with the foundations and the
Department of Aging and they'll
set up a set of criteria.
Mr. Speaker, all I'm trying to
say with this bill, I'm not
disagreeing with the whole
concept, but I think it's a
great idea, but the problem is I
need to know how that criteria
plays out and now I don't know
where there's poverty level and
now I have this other federal
Social Security Act that is now
saying I don't know how much
they're getting, which now
muddles the whole idea of we're
trying to help people, there
should be some sort of
guidelines, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
So, um, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, when we go down here on
page 4 develop and improve a
budget for the salaries and
benefits for staff to assist
participants. Do we know, are
these gonna be full time
employees that are getting para
health insurance, etc. Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and um kind
lady, yes.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
they're gonna be full-time
employees and what is their base
salary going to be, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady?
A
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
you know, it depends but the
the.
Hay band is around anywhere from
65 to 70,000. OK, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady, and that's Para
Health Insurance. Uh, Mr. Fio
Deellini.
When we go down, it, it what
happens when a pilot project
finishes, are those people then
laid off? Is that what happens,
Mr. Speaker, and young lady, if
it doesn't continue forward?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady, I
think I answered this, but
hopefully, hopefully we have a
good evaluation, hopefully it
will prove um um um fruitful for
the people of New Mexico and
hopefully we'll extend this, but
I, I can't dictate into the
future. I can just, I just know
this is a, a good, uh, pilot
project to have and then we can
examine it and see if it works.
Mr. Speaker generally, I was
just asking if they get laid off
and I would assume that's going
to be answers. So Mr. Speaker,
gentlelady, when you talk about
legal.
assistant who is paying for this
legal assistance, where is this
gonna be done? Is this a
taxpayer money who's giving this
free legal assistance, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
the Department of Aging.
I'm just kidding
We would
Yes, Mr. Speaker.
Oh yes.
Oh, I think back to the gentle
lady, Mr. Speaker, the
Department of Aging already does
this. They, they hire
contractors, they hire legal
assistance to not legal
assistance they her law firms to
come in and to uh to help people
with benefit packages to give
them advice. It's something that
they commonly do. It's being
done under Pegasus right now,
um, they already do a lot of
these services at the Department
of Aging. That's what you should
know, Mr. Speaker, and, uh, kind
lady, the, the difference.
Here is uh that we're gonna
actually able to be able to give
them money through the
foundation, uh, part of this
bill, so Mr. Speaker, and young
ladies, so.
The department already uses
people and we'll probably have
to hire people for more legal
assistance. So is that out of
the 4 million in the budget or
where is that coming from, Mr.
Speaker Delaney?
Uh, the fact that they already
do it, they have that in the
budget already, the fact that
they'll do it within this will
come out of the 4 million that
we've appropriated for this
already.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
so I, I've already outlined my
issues on this. Uh, I never said
that CYFD has to be evolved. My
point is to keep kids out of
CYFD and especially keep them in
their families and in their
communities. All I wanted to do
was make sure that our children
that are abused and neglected,
go to the top of the list,
that's it. You have a list we
have 20 people. Let's take the
kids who are living in the uh
who are living in poverty and
let's take the kids have been
neglected, abused, and put them
at the top. That's I was asking.
For. So unfortunately, uh, you
do have a good idea, but you
lost me on that, so I will not
be supporting this bill. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Thank you, gentle lady. There is
further debate. The gentle lady
from Taos, Representative Ortez.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is
a gentle lady from all those
counties yield.
I kindly yield to my friend from
Taos. Uh, thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, um, I
wanna get back to kind of the,
the heart of why, uh, we're
doing this and uh understand
from you, um.
I think we got lost a little bit
in um these other some of these
technical details that will be
sorted out.
Um, but tell me why the five
places, why the 5 counties that
you've chosen.
What's so special about them,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady. Um,
Mr. Speaker, and a kind lady,
there's really nothing special
about these counties really we
could have picked any 5
counties, I think in the state
of New Mexico and done this
program the fact was I had
funders, I had foundations who
were willing to step up in these
particular counties and that's
why I did it and um again it's a
pilot project, uh, it would
we're, we're doing a proof of
concept here.
Will this work? Will this make a
significant a significant
difference in these families'
lives and that's what we're
trying to look for but really I
think every county, every single
county in this, uh, in this
state could use this program and
hopefully at the end of 3 years
we might be able to expand it to
every single county in the
state.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, do
you think it's possible that we
can expand it uh before those 3
years are up.
or will we have reporting from
these counties and from um the
participants and from you know
the the department to
potentially expand earlier.
Uh, I have said this personally
to a number of representatives,
yeah, I, I will keep trying to
raise more money in different
counties throughout the state.
If we bring in, if we bring in
more funders, I will be here
next year asking to expand this
program. I think that's what we
should do. I think that's what
everybody should do, and I've
had different members of this uh
of this uh body including
Republicans and Democrats
saying, hey, can you get it in
my county and I, I'd love to
help you do that. I really.
would, so I, I can see us coming
back next year with maybe, you
know, 5, 10 more funders.
Remember this is a pretty new
concept, pretty new idea. I can
see it's coming back next year
and expanding this program.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, thank
you for that, um, I do
understand though that right now
uh there are there's at least
one foundation that supports
some, you know, sort of a
little, little bit of this kind
of program, um, in Rio River
County. Can you tell me a little
bit about what that program
looks like.
Uh, I think the Lano Foundation
maybe I was gonna say, Mr.
Speaker and kind lady, yes
Solano Foundation has been
running a grandparents raising
grandchildren, uh, program for
some time.
Uh, in the past, they have given
out, you know, $300 stipends at
Christmas or different places or
if the family was really in need
they gave them money but they
really hadn't had a
They didn't have a program that
they could expand it to, and,
and they didn't have the the
capacity to do all of the all of
the work that the Department of
Aging will do, we'll take this
over so it's really, it's really
combining a program that that
suits the needs of a foundation
and and is is uh placed under uh
a state department agency who
already does his work and is
willing to carry out more work,
uh, that, that, uh, is close to.
this endeavor.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle Leni. So just to be
perfectly clear there will be no
state money paid out to a
grandparent.
Who participates in this
program.
Mr. Speaker, kind lady,
absolutely all of this, this
stipend money will all come from
foundations, and that's because
we couldn't come up with a way
of getting around the
anti-donation clause. Everybody
wanted to help these people, but
we couldn't do it, so this is a
way of getting around it,
proving a concept and then
seeing if you know if other
things happened and other things
change that maybe in the future
we can have this in every county
in the state. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you, gentle lady,
and the funding that's in the
budget, um.
Um, we'll go to the department
to to to really build up the
program determine what the needs
are, um, find, uh, you know, uh,
additional legal assistance or
other technical assistance for
the purposes of establishing
these pilot programs in each of
the counties that you've chosen,
uh, Mr. Speaker and kind lady,
yes.
OK, thank you so much. I know
that in my district, um, I get
asked a lot from um from
agencies, um, non-state
agencies, non-political
subdivisions, agencies, but
nonprofits who are doing this
kind of work, what can we do at
the state level to help them,
um, how can we bring more um
sort of shed more light on, on
what is happening um with
grandparents raising
grandchildren and what and what
we can do to help and you know I
have felt very um limited in my
ability.
To help just Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, you know, referring them
to other foundations who might,
who have, you know, many
foundations have said no, we're
not gonna do this kind of, we're
not gonna give people money
directly, uh, so I think it's a
real, um.
It's a remarkable feat that you
have accomplished thus far,
getting the foundations that
you've talked to uh to agree to
this funding, uh, getting this
funding on the in the state
level so that we can really
develop um.
A program that meets the needs
of these of these communities
and they're, they are different,
right? And I think that's, I
think that's why this language
is as
Um, I wouldn't call it vague,
Mr. Speaker, generally, I think
it's, you know, I think it, it,
it's, it gives the leeway for
the department to really
understand um what each of those
communities might need, um, and
what those guidelines will, the
guidelines will come from the
needs of the community and I
think that's really important,
Mr. Speaker, and, and gentle
lady, um, lastly I'll, I'll just
say, you know, I'm, I'm.
I'm just really grateful that
you have put this together. I'm
really excited that it's going
to happen in Taos, uh, and I, I
can't wait to, I hope this
passes and I can't wait to work
with you on this. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, General lady. Thank
you, kind lady. Thank you,
gentle lady. There is further
debate. The gentleman from Otero
representative block.
Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker.
Uh, you've changed. No, just
kidding. Uh, with the kind
gentle lady from all those
beautiful counties that include
Awesome counties that are in our
state which include cool
counties, and I'm trying to find
your, your counties. OK, Ri Riva
Sandoval, Santaanta, please
yield.
Uh yes, I yield to the kind
gentleman. You do have a lot of
cool counties though, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, and I did
have some questions and I wanted
to start off. We keep talking
about HB 2 and we say that it's
in the budget, uh, for the
department at Department of
Aging. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, can you tell me where in
the budget? Do you have a page
number on there? I'm at HB2
right now.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, uh, kind
gentlemen, it's in section 5. I
don't know the exact page
number, but I'll see if I can
get somebody to find it.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Generally, I'm just wondering
because I was, I was looking
here and I had a question, does
this go through the keyki Saedra
senior fund in any way?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentleman,
yes.
OK, OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Generally, I think I found it.
It's on page.
91, I believe. OK, and so I'm
wondering, I, I hear that this
bill would not give money from
the state to.
Foster or for to to grandparents
and, and kin. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, I'm wondering what
that money in the kikisa wager
fund than does.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
the money in that fund will go
to the Department of Aging to
operate this program. OK, thank
you, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
OK, so the program, we kind of
went into it a little bit about
what it, what it would do. And
so I think we said it would be.
Seminars, it would be legal
help.
And I believe that the gentle
lady may have asked previously
how many people we would be
employing. Can you tell me how
many were projecting to employ
at least with this $4.5 million
dollar figure that we have.
Uh, uh, Mr. Speaker, kind
gentleman, probably in total
about 7 people, uh, and then,
uh, legal counsel will be uh in
contract, a contract, uh,
relationship with the Department
of Aging and so we're not
talking about.
Huge numbers of people, but we
wanna, we wanna source it and we
wanna do it so that so that the
um so that the grandparents get
the help they need.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. And so when we're
hiring people, would there be a
new executive director position
and then a deputy director and
then one person per county since
I believe it's 5 counties, and
that would be 7 people or how
are we gonna divvy that up? Um.
Mr. Speaker, and a kind
gentlemen, they'd probably be
one person, uh, per county, uh,
kind of running the whole
program and then another maybe
with program manager, uh,
program management
responsibilities and then and
then they would contract out for
legal services.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. That, that helps me
on that one. And then when it
comes to the actual
Foundations I heard Lano
Foundation. I didn't hear any
others specifically, but I'm
wondering, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, since we did mention that
one in the previous questions.
Why is it that we're not
including Los Alamos County
since it is the Los Alamos
National Labs Foundation.
Well, the Los Alamos National
Laboratory Foundation is located
in Espanola, um, and, um, they
service Reba County.
Uh, for those of you in the body
who don't know, I spent a lot of
time in the foundation world. I
started the northern New Mexico,
uh, college foundation and then
I was hired as the founding
director of the Los Alamos
National Laboratory Foundation.
I worked in the foundation world
for 20 years. I raised a total
of 150 million over a seven year
period, uh, 17-year period, uh,
we gave 70 million out to
communities and I left an
endowment of 80 million when I
left the.
I was also the president of the
New Mexico Association of Grant
Makers, so we all bring
different skill sets to this
body, a kind gentlemen, I have a
foundation background, so it was
kind of natural that I would
turn to those bodies to ask them
to help us do this work.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. That does help me
on that. And then when it comes
to the actual $500 checks or
sums of money that we're putting
out in different forms. How do
we ensure that that money gets
to those families from the
foundation since they're all
different. I'm just wondering
how do we oversee that transfer?
And is there some kind of of uh
agreement made or a contract
written up with each foundation
to guarantee that those those
funds.
We're going to go to each
550 of those people in the
counties.
Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
there will be a memorandum of
understanding between the, uh,
you know, the agency, uh, on
aging, uh, with the foundations.
I think they're really not
talking about handing out a cash
or check. It'll probably be uh
uh maybe uh a gift card from
Walmart, uh, which if they
needed money to pay the rent or
to pay the utility bill they
could cash that and so I, I
think it will be handled in that
way, but again that's, that will
be developed as we implement
this.
Project, but that's pretty much
the glowing idea right now as we
discussed in committee.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gently. OK, I appreciate that.
And I, I'm sorry, I'm trying to
recollect all the things that
happened in committee. It feels
like it was a really long time
ago, even though I think it was
last week, so Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, thank you for that.
Uh, so next year, I had a
question about.
The what specific policy gaps
will the bill aim to address
regarding kinship, caregiving in
New Mexico and how, how does
kinship caregiving work
currently and how does this aim
to try to supplement that in
some way.
There's, there's kind of a catch
22, uh, in, in our, in our state
policies so what you should know
about um
Abused children or children who
have been neglected, uh, if.
If you have say a child, a baby
born with fentanyl, OK, and he's
in the hospital or she's in the
hospital.
If a parent steps forward or a
grandparents steps forward and
said, I will take that child.
I'm gonna take that child home
with me and I'm gonna care for
them and they do that they get
no money from CYFD for taking
care of that child because 3
quarter of our money that we
give to uh foster care parents
comes from the federal
government and the federal
government laws say that if a
child, a child has to be.
Abused before you can give them
that foster care money so if
they've taken that child out and
they're not abused, they're not
eligible for that program, which
is why we need this program so
much that they're just not
eligible. I'm trying to work on
legislation to see if we can't
rectify that, but that is the
existing law, so if you in fact
step forward and save a baby and
take them they're not abused
therefore they can't get any
funding and.
And so that's kind of the catch
22 that all these families are
left in, uh, they, they won't
get any money because the child
has never been abused.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady from all those
beautiful counties. So,
We're talking about federal
funds and I, I didn't know
specifically which federal funds
we were referring to in, in this
case when it comes to the
guardianship or or being the
sole guardian, I guess it would
be a guardian of some kind or.
Whoever is in charge of that
child. So we're talking about a
4E funds as well in the bill I
believe and I just was checking
if that's any way tied to those
funds that we were discussing
earlier when we said there were
some speed bumps.
I, I think you may be talking
about 4E of the Social Security
Act, which is TANA funding and
that's a different source of
funding.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. OK, so I, I did
have a question about that and I
was just wondering if you could
just detail the requirements and
processes that the department
has to implement to integrate so
available federal funds.
Such as Title fore funds into
the program. How would, how
would those just be gauged, I
suppose, if they are at all.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
this bill really isn't about
that, but I'm just gonna tell
you we're not integrating any of
that funding with.
With the current legislation
that we're carrying forward what
we're doing, what we have done
is approved for 4 million in the
House Bill 2 under the Kiquia
Vedra Fund to give to the
Department of Aging to run this
program, but we're not bringing
TANF money. We're not bringing
any other federal money and the,
the stipends or the monies that
will go out to the families on a
monthly basis all come from
foundation funds.
All right, thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, and I, I
guess I found that probably on
page. I'm on the original bill,
not the updated one, so I
apologize, but on the original
bill that wasn't updated in
committee. I think on page 3, it
said, determine requirements
necessary to use federal
assistance or resources,
including 4E of the Federal
Social Security Act funds if
available. So I was just
wondering if that was some kind
of provision that was added in
there.
Um, Mr. Speaker, thank you for
asking that question. That's
just a referral that we'd make
we would we might refer these
parents if they are these
kinship parents or grandparents
if they were eligible for that
funding, we would refer them
there.
All right, thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady that helped
me on that one and then what
else did I have? I wrote up all
kinds of stuff here, fun. OK,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
I believe.
I'm wondering what trends are
indicate are being indicated.
To
Need this bill due to increases
in kinship caregiving in New
Mexico. I think we had a
statistic earlier and I didn't
jot jot it down. So I'm just
wondering,
What statistics do we have to
show that we we need this.
We, uh, Mr. Chair and uh kind
gentlemen, we probably have the
highest percentage of kinship
caregivers in the country. I, I
haven't been able to do a huge
research plan on the whole
state. I did in my schools. I
called up all the schools in my
district about 6 different, uh,
um uh school superintendents. I
asked him what was the
percentage because they know
what are the percentage of uh
kids in their, in their schools
that are being raised by
either grandparents or kids, and
they said for the most part in
my district it is between 10 and
18%, uh, trauma on the kind of
the high side, uh, Espanella was
about 10%.
All right. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady. And
then I, I think that's
definitely something worth
noting for sure, just to see
which counties have more need,
things like that, which is also
why I was wondering why, why the
specific counties were chosen,
but I know that that was based
upon the foundation. So, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, my next
question is,
Wondering about ECECD, the early
childhood.
department I'm just gonna call
it that because it's easier than
saying the full thing, ECECD. So
what role will they play in this
new initiative.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, and, um, kind
gentlemen, they might make
referrals to this program again,
uh, we're working with an
anti-donation clause, uh, that's
why I didn't go there, um, um,
the department and, and look for
funding because they couldn't
have done it at this point, you
know, I hope we, I hope we.
You know, disallow the
anti-donation clause. I think
this could be a very good place
to put this program in the
future, but right now we can't
do it.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and then I was
trying to, to.
Think about your predicament in
the bill, and I was wondering,
Mr. Speaker, generally, if it
would, let's just say the bill
dies or whatever. Hopefully it
doesn't, right? But if it did,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, would
maybe there be a potential for
the Department of Aging.
To contract.
Out for services.
In each individual case for each
child and make it a very
specific contract that would
only essentially give that award
to the grandparent, and that
could technically.
Go around the anti-donation
clause like the, the grandparent
would technically be a
contractor of the state. Has
that been something considered?
I, I've been just trying to find
an answer to your problem, and I
was thinking that could actually
work if this, if this doesn't.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, um, kind
gentlemen, I don't think it'll
work. I mean, uh, everybody who,
who's kind of an expert on this
doesn't see any way of doing
that.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and I was trying to
think outside the box and I
guess that box was definitely
not um.
Didn't work. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, next question here.
I have um.
So will kinship caregivers
automatically qualify for state
health programs such as
Medicaid. I believe I got that
somewhere off of the healthcare
authority's report on the bill.
They may have referenced that,
and I'm wondering if that could
be something.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen.
I would say usually yes. OK,
thank you Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady. And then I think in my
next question regarding the
eligibility.
I think the good representative
from Bernao and Torrance asked
about this, and I see the, the
eligibility requirements in the
bill, but I feel like they're
kind of in my opinion, very
broad and they could be
tightened up somehow, such as
with income or with other kinds
of, of established norms. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I'm just
wondering how, how did we
develop the current language to
allow the the department to
promulgate the rules for the
eligibility of the program.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
we were very closely with the
Department of Aging, uh, and,
uh, the governor's office was
involved in this, and we tried
to make the, the language fit
the need and that's what we did.
All right, thank you, Mr.
Speaker, and generally, because
I, I, and I'm on the original
bill. I apologize, I don't have
the, the substitute or the
amendments in context, but what
I hear, I read here is criteria
for consideration shall include
kinship caregivers, current
household income, and the need
of the child or children that
are that are.
Or will be cared for child that
are, I don't know if that needs
to be who, but um.
be cared for and supported by
the kinship caregiver. I'm
wondering, uh, what if the
The grandparent has a.
An IRA or a 401k and
They take out every, every month
or annually from that, but some,
what if they chose not to and
they just let that money sit
there. Would that be included in
their income in any way, or
would it just be actual income
that they have to report on
taxes,
uh, Speaker and kind gentleman
that will be decided when we
develop the criteria.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
General Lee, because I was just
wondering because I know some
people have, have those, I know
I have mine and it's.
Don't buy Nvidia, by the way,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady right
now, but, um, maybe do. I, I
have them in my portfolio, but,
uh, so I'm just thinking, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, if 401ks
and IRAs are not factored into
that, I guess it would be just
based on whatever is taken out
of that would be, could be
income and I just don't know how
often people usually do that.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm just wondering if you could.
Just give me a little more
information on that because if
it, if they did take out some
more money then it could bump
them up.
From, from being eligible, like
halfway through the program and
I'm wondering if the eligibility
requirement would be at the
beginning of the program, or
could it change based upon the
income one year in 2 years in,
cause it's 3 years.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
we hope that um some of these uh
grandparents will consider
taking full custody of their
kids and then they would be
eligible, uh, for, uh, foster
care money from the state, but
again that's a legal process
we're giving them the advice and
as as far as the other
questions, I think again that's
uh that will be developed in the
criteria.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and I'm sorry for
the confusing question. I just,
sometimes I, I have like two
questions that come out at once,
and I think, oh, that, that's
interesting, and then, you know,
you know how that goes. But Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, since the
criteria will be developed by
the department, I'm just very
interested in seeing that
because I don't see very
concrete this needs to happen,
that needs to happen. So I just
would hate for anything to to be
uh.
Not equal when it comes to the
administration of it, so Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I do also
see that we're talking about
legal services that could be
added to help these people
contract wise. Can you tell me
what services those, those could
include and are they specific to
just the kinship care programs
or is it just seniors in general
because they like to, you know,
they need to write wills, they
need to uh do factors regarding
Social Security, they may have
to, to do legal stuff.
In that regard. So I'm wondering
what that would extend to.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
it's really specific to the
nature of being a kinship
guardian, uh, that's what the
legal services will provide and
um uh.
Just helping them navigate
through all these uh systems.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
General Lee. And then I did see
in the bill.
Which actually kind of gave me a
little bit of a concern was the
emergency clause on this and the
time frame for promulgation of
rules and it says administered
by the first of June of this
year. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, how will that work to
ensure that those rules are
indeed in place by that short
time frame.
Um, uh, Mr. Speaker, kind
gentlemen, uh, as you can
imagine they're looking at this
right now in the department of
aging, so we wanted to start
helping people as soon as we
could, so, uh, that's why we put
that clause in.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and then when it
comes to the actual rules
themselves.
Is there gonna be any
disqualification criteria that
could happen halfway through the
program. So if, if, uh, an elder
who was taking care of their
grandkid.
Somehow violated any of these
set forth rules that may be in
the bill or the spirit of the
bill, but not necessarily in the
rules because I know the rules
can be really long and, and very
intricate. How would that work?
clawing back money if necessary.
Would, would the department have
any enforcement in that since
the money is technically the
foundation's money, how would
that work?
Uh, again, Mr. Speaker, kind
gentlemen, I think that will be
developed in the MOU with the
foundations that's the
foundations money. I doubt that
they would claw back, but that
remains to be seen, uh, I think
I would hope.
That when there's a change in
status, it's because that
grandparent has decided to take
over legal custody and then they
would be eligible for funds from
the state.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. OK, so I, I just
have really kind of have
concerns about just saying, OK,
we're gonna make it in
rulemaking because I.
I do fear for what what could or
could be left out when it comes
to rulemaking, but
My next question is regarding my
own district in Otero County. I
know we're not in the bill, but
Mr. Speaker General waiting,
let's just say by June 1st of
next year or this year I get a
foundation to pledge that amount
of money to help since the
language in the bill, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, is
specifically saying Rebu Santa
Fe to McKinley, and Donny Anna.
Could they be included or would
they have to wait 3 years?
Until this sunsets or.
Falls off to be included in
this.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
if we got more money, you got a
foundation. I think we do
everything we could to try and
include you.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady and uh.
I will work with you on that to
try to get that because I think
it's great. Yeah, we have a
foundation in Otero, and I think
that they probably have that
kind of money that they could do
to help, but I also have some
concerns, at least with the
rulemaking, so I definitely have
to see how that rulemaking goes
forward before getting them on
board. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Regarding that.
I know that some foundations
have different bylaws and
things, and I know we're gonna
do the MOU, but Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, would these be MOUs
that are specific to the actual
foundation, or would it be kind
of a like a a copy paste cookie
cutter kind of.
Contract that each one of them
would have to abide by to make
sure that the rules were
followed and everything was, was
going above board. Um.
I assume it would be with the
foundation, uh, uh, there'd be
MOU with each foundation, but it
could be it, it could be a set
of guidelines that would work
for all of them, and I think
that would make it easier
beginning because again, uh, Mr.
Speaker, kind gentlemen, it's,
it's a pilot program, so we want
to try and keep things as steady
as we can or as uniform as we
can so that we can get uh a good
evaluation and, and know what
we're evaluating.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. I, I think that's,
that's good and so my next
question actually I'm gonna go
back to the budget, the 4.5
million. Does that, is that for
all three years? Or is it just
for now?
Oh no, Mr. Speaker, kind
gentlemen, that's for 3 years
and it's 4 million.
Oh yeah, 4 million, pardon me.
4.5, I believe. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, so I, I just wanna
make sure because I believe we
established these people could
be para, these people that are
working full time and so if the
program ends and the state is
not inclined to continue the
program 3 years after that, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, would this
office just close and how would
that work in that case?
Mr. Chair and Mr uh kind
gentleman. It's, it's just like
any grant that you would enter
into, uh, and, and typically
state agencies enter into grants
uh for federal funds or whatever
and uh when that grant period
ends, the money's over and the
people know it's they're hired
on a grant situation and it
could possibly end at the end of
a grab, so that's how this would
work.
OK, perfect. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady. Yeah, I,
you, I will, I will defer to you
when it comes to grants because
you have that experience, so I
appreciate that. And then Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I'm
wondering what percentage of
that 4.5 million will directly
go to the legal assistance for
guardianship cases. Do we have
uh an amount for what we're
setting in that 4.5 for that.
Um, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
I, you know, we, we really can't
tell you because we haven't
implemented it and we don't know
what the best we're we're
estimating probably 100,000 a
year in each of the five, you
know, counties.
And that's an estimate. OK,
thank you Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. It's just good to see
what, how, how we're making the
budget because I know that when
we put a bunch of money in HB 2,
it's not very, very specific.
It's kind of specific, but it's
not granular. So, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and I'm wondering,
has, has any other state done
something like this and how did
the program costs in this
compared to other existing
kinship support programs in
other states if they do.
Actually, uh, Mr. Speaker, kind
gentlemen, yes, uh, uh, uh, the
District of Columbia was the
first state to do this, um, and
we reviewed our program, uh,
when we were talking about it,
we reviewed, we met with the
director of um aging and that in
the District of Columbia we laid
out our plans, told her what we
intended to do. She said, well,
you guys have come up with a
solution that took us about 5
years to get to, so you've come
up with all the major uh cri.
material that we look for and uh
what you're doing is the right
direction and uh they, they were
surprised that we were able to
put this together.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. I did not know that the
District of Columbia had that,
so do they have an anti-donation
clause by chance in that state
or I'm sorry, not that state,
that district. It's not a state,
won't be a state.
Ah
Uh, Mr. Chair, uh, kind
gentlemen, I really don't know.
I couldn't tell you. I know they
worked with the local community
organizations though who were
trusted by their grandparents
and kinships and, and those
local organizations had their
trust of the community and they
worked through them to help
these families.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. All right, that's
just interesting to, to just
look at other places, what
they're doing, what's working
well, and so, Mr. Speaker,
General Lady, since their
program was put forward, has
there
have their metrics improved in
regard to child wellbeing.
In kinship care.
Uh, Mr. Chair, kind gentlemen,
yes.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and then how are we
going to track these in this
program. Do we have specific
guidelines that say, OK, well,
after 3 years if these counties
have a certain percentage
increase in child well-being or,
or decrease in the need exact or
things like that, what kind of
metrics are we trying to look
for? I know it may not be in the
bill, but in the long run, what,
what's the thought process on
this? Uh, the beauty of this
bill, Mr. Speaker and kind
gentleman is that all the grill
projects.
These pilot promising projects,
uh, have an evaluation built
into them and that's a huge
savings because if you go
outside for around to evaluate,
you know, a RAND study or
something it's, it's in the
millions, so the fact that that
the state has already worked in
evaluation that's covered in
this contract, I think, uh,
makes it, um, very doable and uh
they will, they will set the
parameters and we'll follow
through with that on a quarterly
basis.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. So the, would,
would that be uh the interviews
when we interview the parents. I
I or the grandparents, I believe
we spoke a little bit about that
in previous debate on that when
we're checking in, you said it
would be quarterly, is that
correct?
I, as I understand it, it's a
quarterly uh evaluation, yes.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and then I'm
wondering if this also could
include, because I know that
taking care of anybody is, it
could be trying, right? It could
be a, a difficult process,
especially if it's younger or
teenagers. I know I was quite a
tear when I was a teenager. So
Mr. Speaker, generally, people
could make the case. I'm not
quite a terror now, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I'm just
wondering, uh, is there any kind
of mental health resources for
caregivers who may experience
high levels of stress when it
comes to uh.
doing this very important uh
work.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
well, what we also hope to build
in this in these uh groups of 25
people are a group of, uh, you
know, a cohort.
Because, because grandparents
can vent with other grandparents
they can make friendships and
they might when you know they
just can't take their kids
anymore they might take them for
a weekend and vice versa. So the
whole point of developing uh
these cohorts is to build a
network of friends really and
supporters who can help them
through this process so you not
only have state agency workers
but you also have a group of
friends that will get together
in these cohorts and.
Hopefully help each other out,
which I'm sure they will.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and that, that's a
good point to make. I think
hopefully they work together and
so when it comes to that, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I know
that the, the money goes through
the, the foundations and I'm
wondering when it comes to these
other folks who are in the
program as well, the 50 or so in
the, in the county. Mr. Speaker,
General Lady, could you tell me
a little bit about the
liability.
And insurance and what what
liabilities will the state be
taking on when it comes to this
program.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentlemen,
the, the, the Department of
Aging already does its work, so,
uh there it's not something new,
it's not something they haven't
done before and um they're
deeply involved in it and I
don't think it's been a problem.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. I just am thinking
since we're adding more, more
steps to it, a lot more things,
checks and balances. I'm just
wondering if, if there would be
any kind of liability when it
comes to these, these groups of
grandparents and what if
something happened under
someone's care and I'm just
wondering, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, would that.
Could that fall on the
foundation maybe?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentleman,
no.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So it would be
completely falling if it did on
Department of Aging and
Long-term Services if we still
call it that.
Uh, we're just providing, uh,
Mr. Speaker, we're just
providing and kind gentlemen,
we're just providing navigating
resources and legal help if they
need it, so I, I just can't see
that happening.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and then I'm just,
I'm also wondering, I know we
talked a little bit about
federal funding when it comes to
federal funding, are there any
kinship programs on the federal
level that we have in the
country.
Uh, Mr.
Mr. Speaker and kind gentlemen,
I, you know, I, we're just
working with state agencies now
I wouldn't be able to answer
that question.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and yeah, I, I
wouldn't want to get off the top
of the of the bill or anything,
but I know that we said we want
to utilize some federal funding.
So I just was wondering if there
may have been some, some kind of
thing on the federal level
because I know that they're
always creating new fun programs
that we just don't even know
about. So, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, uh, I'll just continue
here on a few more questions
that I have and so when it comes
to this program, I'm just
wondering.
There, there's federal federal
programs maybe, which we don't
know about, but the private
funding sources, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, are we getting
these?
These, let's just say something
happens in the foundation two
years in, they go bankrupt. Hope
it doesn't happen, but in the
3rd year of the program, if
there's no funds.
What do we do?
If, if somehow they couldn't
fulfill their MOU with the
government because it just went
bankrupt, for example, which
wouldn't hopefully wouldn't
happen, but if it did.
Uh
Mr. Chair and um kind gentleman,
if the, if the stock market
crashed and everybody's, you
know, went down. I mean, there
would, there would be a problem
with that, but there would be a
lot bigger problems than that, I
can tell you, and, uh, you know,
most foundations, uh, do a 5
year rolling average of their,
of their, um, payout, uh, so
they, they're pretty
conservative about how they give
their money out and then when
they make a promise, uh, they
keep it.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, so in the MOU,
would it, could it require them
to put a specific new bank
account with the funds for all 3
years now.
For the payments, I mean, is
that something that's best
practices. I, I don't know. I
don't work in the foundation
world. I've worked in nonprofits
before, but nothing at this
magnitude, Mr. Speaker, General
lady.
Uh, Mr. Chair and, uh, kind
gentlemen, I can't speak for
every foundation, but when they
make a commitment, they usually
sit that's, that's I, I forget
the.
counting term, but it's set
aside in their uh financial
statement that they've made that
commitment and it'll carry out
over a 3 year period.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. All right, so.
You know, I, I, I like the idea
of your bill. I really do. I
still have a little concern when
it comes to my county not being
in the statute when this is
passed, because I would like to
help and I, I'm
I believe we said it could work,
but I, I do want to make sure
that that's a firm, firm thing.
And then Mr. Speaker, General
Lady, I just did have some
concerns as well, just about
the, the lack of clarity when it
comes to what the rules are, and
I guess it would all just depend
on what those rules say, so
that's pretty much what, where
I'm coming from, but I
definitely want to continue to
listening to some of our
colleagues on debate, and I
thank you for the.
The very well thought out out
outside of the box kind of idea,
because I like those kind of
ideas to make sure that, OK, if
we have a law that's in place
that is kind of a barrier to
what we're trying to do. Let's
see how we can work around it.
So I think that the inventive
aspects of the bill are very
something that I, I find good
and
Quite frankly, refreshing. So
thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you gentle lady for the bill and
I will continue listening to the
debate before I make my
decision.
For the debate, gentle lady from
Santa Fe Presentative Lujan.
For the debate, gentlemen from
Le San F Pettigroup. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, the gentle lady
yield?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, I yelled to the
gentleman.
Uh, from
I should know this, uh, uh, to
the south. Let me find a
relevant uh Lee County.
Yes, gentle lady, and uh I
should have said it correctly
the first time. Well, the gentle
lady from Rio Riva Sandoval,
Santa Fe and Tao, please show.
Uh, I kindly yield to the gentle
and thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
You had some of the most
beautiful country in the state.
Um
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, we
talked about this the other
night and I'm sure everybody can
see from
From the
Their analysis that I voted
against this the other night and
I'd like to talk through some of
that.
Uh, I, I don't feel like house
approprians hope house
appropriations is a proper place
to debate some of these things.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
Would you clarify
How, and with your professional
witness there, hopefully we can
get through this.
How aging and long term.
Feels like they can make monthly
home visits and the monthly
seminars with the local assets.
Um, Mr. Mr. Speaker and kind
gentlemen, uh, through local
assets I they will hire staff to
do this with the 4 million that
has been given to them and the
staff will provide those
services to the local community.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
the um, the staff that you're
talking about would be the
additional FTEs, and they would
be housed within the senior
centers facilities, wherever a
senior center is.
Yeah, um, Mr. Speaker and kind
gentlemen, aging has different
offices and we have offices
available in the state. I, I
don't think there's gonna be a
huge need for that. I, I think
there is plenty of available
space where they could locate
these offices.
OK, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
um,
Still a little bit confused
about that, and I know there's a
lot of things that have to
happen in rulemaking, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, and I
understand that the reason why
the emergency clauses on this
bill is because you have to be
aging and long term has to be
set up and ready to go by June 1
of this year, correct?
Well, we're trying to, Mr.
Speaker and kind gentlemen,
we're trying to get set up so
that yeah we're ready to go by
July 1st, uh, the beginning of
the fiscal year for state
agencies. OK, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, I heard July 1st,
but I think the documents show
that they have to be set up by
June 1st.
So, um, at least according to
the FIR, no, actually, on page
4, line 19, no later than June 1
rules have to be promulgated and
ready to go for the pilot
program.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind
gentlemen, aging really already
does a lot of this work, uh,
assisting, uh, seniors in
different communities throughout
the state, so they're kind of
already set up to do this it'll
just bring bringing on more
staff to um uh start this
process.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, that brings up the
next question. We, we look, you
know, where this bill to pass
within just say another week
from here through both houses
get signed with the emergency
clause.
You're still
Um, 3 months out in the typical
timeline to hire people within
state government is exceeds that
3 months. We're all aware of
that, right, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady?
Um, Mr. Speaker and kind
gentlemen, I, I actually think
this is a, a pretty attractive
job that people would be
attracted to. I, I, we don't
anticipate a big problem and
some of these offices would also
be run through the um.
The the family resource centers
we also have those in some
counties and so they, they could
work with the family resource
centers that are also
established, uh, to provide, uh,
offices and, and, uh, uh,
outreach to the community.
I appreciate that answer. Thank
you very much.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, I,
I believe I heard and I'm gonna
try my very hardest not to
repeat questions, but I wanna
clarify, I believe I heard that
in so many of the cases that
you're looking at within the
five counties, um.
We've, you've already identified
or the foundation or somebody
has already identified.
Many of the grandparents that
have a child living with them.
Would that be correct?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind
gentlemen, yes.
So Mr. Speaker, and, and gentle
lady, would you please kind of
elaborate on that, how, how that
process worked.
Uh, through the, uh, family
resource centers, Mr. Speaker
and kind gentlemen, they're
already reaching out to people
and seeing, you know, what they
need, uh, so they, so they're
already working with a number of
grandparents raising kids in
some cases they put together,
you know, a food storage a place
center, a place where you can
check out toys they're already
doing a lot of this work in the
family resource centers and um
and again we're working with
foundations and foundations.
work in their service area and
they know the nonprofits that
are working with these families
they know the the um problems
they have and so it will be
working through the the the um
the network of a foundation who
works with nonprofits to find
and reach out to these uh
grandparents or kids raising
kids.
Thank you very much for that
answer. So,
Uh and it kind of helped me on
my next question. It leads right
into we identified and according
to what I've read and what we
talked about the other day,
you've identified 5 counties
that have foundations that are
willing to donate to, to the
this effort, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, I understand that
each of those foundations have,
have committed a million
dollars. Is that number correct?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentleman,
yes, about 900,000 over a 3 year
period.
OK, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
just shy of that of the million
then. So with that, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady.
How does the
We this to get signed between
the 4.5 million, the 900 and
divide that by 5,
and then add that to the
900,000. Who's the fiscal agent
with respect to that is the
foundation gonna be issuing the,
the monthly checks.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind gentleman,
I think I referred to this
before. What, what will happen
is just the foundations will be
in charge of issuing the monthly
stipends, that's their job. The
state agency will be in charge
of helping them navigate what
resources are available to them,
uh, giving them legal help if
they need it and doing the staff
work of this of this uh project.
Thank you very much. So just for
my clarification and
understanding.
The
Money that's appropriated to
this, we'll deal with the
full-time employees and uh the
implementation side of this, the
foundations will be responsible
for issuing the checks to the
individuals and that, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, is how
we bypass some of the antitrust
issues or anti.
Donation. Yes, Mr. Speaker, yes,
kind gentlemen, that's how we
get around the anti-donation
clause.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. So,
As this continues to grow and as
I read the bill and I read the
FIR, the agency analysis.
I think you had 4 different
aging analysis or, um, uh,
agency analysis on this, um,
each of them suggests that.
There, there needs to be a solid
attempt with respect to
See seeking federal funds, can
we, can you elaborate a little
bit more for me.
Have those federal funds been
identified and if so, what do
you think the options are with
respect to this for getting
those funds.
Um
You know
I'm not sure, Mr. Speaker, and,
um, kind gentleman if under the
current climate we're gonna see
a lot of federal funds coming
down this way, but you know, I
would hope we would, uh, and,
and foundations, uh, are very
good at leveraging what money
they have, and yes, we keep an
eye on federal funds, uh, and if
it fits what we're doing, we
collectively go after that and
likewise, as you know, we, we,
we funded the cogs
inappropriate.
too, so we have local entities
that are also could do grant
writing for the Department of
Aging, uh, in a local area if we
saw uh federal funds that were
available, we'd certainly go
after that.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you gentle lady, um, page 3
column or um.
Item C1, which starts on line 9.
Can you?
This question really rotates
around the words develop and
implement processes and
eligibility criteria.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, do
you envision as a secretary
envision, even though this
starts with 5 counties is is
another county came in with the
foundation, do you envision a
way does the agency envision a
way to find a way to assist with
that on top of just these 5
counties within the 1st 3 years.
Um, Mr. Speaker, and kind
gentlemen, I, I, I certainly
hope we could, uh, we would try
our best, uh, you know, by that
time I, I mean after the first
year I think we'll know what the
costs are for the first year of
operation in each of these
places will have a better idea
and, uh, you know, I hope we can
if if somebody finds another
funder, uh, we would try to do
our best to see if we could do
it.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, I
would like to see
Irregardless of how I vote
tonight.
Relatively very confident that
that this is going to pass
through this chamber.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, as
you, as you work through the
Senate, I would like to see some
language changes within item or
page 3 that kind of opens that
door for that.
And makes it more clear that the
agency is willing to look at
some of those different options.
If, if the need grows outside
those 5 counties within the
first year to 3 years of that
and, and that's just a thought
for you to work on on your side
at your bill, um,
I'm gonna have some
conversations with you offline
with respect to the legal and
assistance work on this. 11
comment that I
There's 2 comments, Mr. Speaker,
I'd like to close with.
And
Not only in house appropriations
and then today when, when you
let into this.
He made a
Comment that I think the body
should listen very closely to.
And that comment
was that the grandparents
are scared of working with us
CYFD.
And I think the body should take
that into account. We've made
some decisions and we've funded
CYFD in some ways this year that
go against that.
We're funding an agency right
now.
That people in the state are
scared to work with.
Because of the retaliation piece
of that. So that concerns me a
little bit.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, one
of the other things said that
there's no state money, part of
your testimony in response to
one of the people that debated
this with you, was it that, you
know, there's no state money in
there and I would agree, Mr.
Speaker, and gentle lady that
there is no general fund money
in there, but it is important to
understand that the Kikis
and I'm gonna say this wrong.
Sevira fund.
Um
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
that $4.5 million comes from
state funds, comes from taxpayer
money, so there is state funds
involved in this.
Um, Mr. Mr. Speaker and kind
gentlemen, I said there's state
money involved for the agency,
but there's not state money
involved in paying the stipends
to grandparents.
And I understand that and I
appreciate that, that
clarification and that
separation, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, I, I wish you the
best of luck. I'll listen to
whatever's left and we'll see
where we go from there. Thank
you. Thank you, kind gentlemen.
So you know, for the debate
generally close.
So you know for the debate

said McQueen, are you ready on
item number 3
will get to that point the
record reflect that all action
has served for place in House
resolution 1 as amended on final
passage has been taken and is
not subject to debate. Aendment
or substitution, the gentleman
to explain the joint resolution.
Mr. Speaker, resolution one

amendment to even out our 60-30
legislative cycle to 245 day

removes the germaneness.

lady from Santa Fe, you're ready
on item 12. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Can you get me to that
point the record reflect that
action necessary for placing
House Bill 220 on final passage
has been taken and it is not
subject to debate. Amendment or
substitution generally to
explain the bill, Mr. Speaker,
House Bill 220 as amended, uh

in the negative. House Bill 220
has really passed his house.
Gentle lady from.
Chavezy Roosevelt, are you ready
on item 22. Yes, thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Will you get me to that
point is placing House Bill 104
and final passage has been
taken. It is not subject to
debate amendment or
substitution, the general lady
to explain the bill. House Bill
104 basically allows the victims
of Crime Act to include peace
officers as enumerated victims
when a crime is committed
against them to ensure they have
the same rights as any other
victim.
There is debate lady from
Berlin, Representative Anaya.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentle lady yield? I'll yield.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will
make this quick, um, but I have
a few questions, uh, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady, um, under the
definition of peace officer,
would that also include ice as
well.
That's a federal agent, so it
would be um under the definition
of peace officer be a law
enforcement certified law
enforcement officer.
OK, um, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, my understanding was that
they are included in this
definition. I can also look up
that section of law, um, really
quickly, but, uh, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady, given, um,
what's happening at the federal
level also the fact that we just
had an ICE raid on one of our
school buses makes it really
hard to vote for something like
this, um, but, uh, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady before I was
here elected in office, I also
did a lot of advocating.
For sexual assault programs and
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, if I'm
not mistaken, this would
Add
Peace officers to VOA.
In which case they would have
access to compensation that is
typically used for domestic
violence and sexual assault
survivors is that correct, Mr.
Speaker? Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, um,
Yes, somewhat, but what this
does is allow peace officers,
um, when they are battered or
shot or any um type of injury
that occurs to them to be an
enumerated victim, which means
they will get the same rights as
any other victims. They get to
be notified of their hearing.
They get to have a say in what
their plea agreement is to
actually get to make a statement
to the court. They don't, um,
just so you know, the, uh, CBRC
is totally is 100% in support of
this bill. They get workers'
comp when they're injured and so
they would.
actually get workers'
compensation um through their
employment and then if there's
anything extra they could apply
for that. But in addition, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, it allows
them and their family members to
apply for counseling if let's
say their family member um is
injured or shot in the line of
duty, um, in those
circumstances. So it would not
impact the crime victim's
reparation fund, um, and they
actually have a, they're very
big support of this and are not
concerned about that, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you, uh, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, is
there anything that prevents
These peace officers from
getting help right now.
The, they are, this bill isn't
about getting help, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. It's about allowing
them to have the same rights as
any other victim, so the only
time under the laws that they're
murdered, their family will get
the right to have a say in their
sentence, be notified of a court
hearing right now if an officer
is a victim of a crime, um,
let's say they're shot in
paralyzed, they don't even get a
notice of their hearing like any
other victim would get. They
don't get the right to speak at
a hearing. They don't get a
right to any of the, the listed,
I believe there are 12 victims'
rights and 31264, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and these are the
people that are going out every
day risking their lives for us,
and we cannot as a legislature
say, hey, you need to be an
enumerated victim so that you
have the same rights as anybody
else, sure, madam Chair, uh sir,
uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
they can go to counseling if
they want, but that would not be
covered for them.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
gentle lady. I am just concerned
because we are pretty
chronically um underfunding the
compensation money, uh, for, uh,
victims of violence and so I
wanted to bring awareness to
that, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, um, adding folks to this
would also add to the amount
that we need to be funding
victim compensation services,
and so thank you gentle lady and
Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, General. I just say
that that we don't need, it will
not impact the victim's
reparation fund according to
CBRC.
See no further debate, generally
close.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, um, I asked
that House Bill 104 do now
passage of House Bill 104, the
vote is now open.
What about the clothes?
The boat is now closed by a vote
of 57 in the affirmative 6 and
the negative. House Bill 104 has
duly passed this house. Your
lady from Santa Fe.
Mr. Speaker, and we go to that
order of business announcements
and miscellaneous business.
