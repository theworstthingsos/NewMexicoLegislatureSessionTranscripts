Medicaid we have a two hundred
fifty million dollar increase in
Medicaid this year due to the to
the F. map and we boosted things
along the way the most important
thing that I think we talk about
that DD waiver list there's talk
about more money but that is a
priority for this body and
everyone the state New Mexico

Thank you very much Mr
president.
page one seventy one down at the
bottom of the page it talks
about yeah four percent salary
increase which I believe it's my
understanding that that will
Senator Munoz.
Mr president and etcetera so in
section eight of the bill we
talked about a seven percent
increase across the state in New
language and then the next year
in July in our budgeting your
begins they'll get another four
percent and that's why you see a
differentiate in the in the
senator so there's no
requirement for the three
percent that
the teacher or the school
participate in extended learning
and can get it done and so if
they want an increase in pay and
they want to have the extended
learning they'll get another
three percent on top of that so
on top Mr present on top of the
school week and I know that's
been kind of a sore topic and
and I appreciate the fact that
you change the year because I
know we had about three school
districts that moved into the
change the the year and for two
twenty twenty one to twenty two
so I appreciate that I do think
that at some point we're going
to have to change in statute the
sure that that we are very
careful about any school
district moving to a four day
which I think we should be we
need to make sure that's done in
statute and so just want to make
Can somebody stop Senator from
running.
What is the Senator run that
fast it'll go to Senator was to
catch his breath Senator Woods.
for a question or two Senator
need of this present yes I will.
I've got a.
I'm not sure where it is in the
appropriations act right here
it's on page eleven.
And it makes a statement about
Mr president Senator us.
Mr presence there yes that is
contingent on house bill thirty
seven.
Okay and and right above it it
it from the Senate amendments
that means that right now we
struck out that money.
Off to game and fish to acquire
How much continued to language
do we have in here do we have
Sir I know that we have several
bills that.
That haven't got to a should
package that we haven't passed
yet.
it and this is off the top of my
head Mr president so Senator I
and it's kind of a round number.
is Mr president and senators
that kind of the numbers we have
been there for tax package.
this bill for tax packages and
reoccurring expenses in the
budget.
And again of that's contingent
contingency also Mr president.
Mr presence in there's no
contingency language in the
budget on the four hundred
million it just left us rural
And then under the same thought
the same thought of line a line
of thought we we have a hundred
and twenty five million in there
hydrogen hub bill or is that
just if we don't come up with
the hydrogen of that money will
disregard back to reserves Mr
Okay Mister president senator
that's that's.
All the questions I have thank
you Mr president thank you Sir
He completely gave me permission
to talk about this for another
twelve hours so.
I thought you know this is a
good bill
is two hundred some pages long
I can not only talk about the
trial you tales of the
diminutive swine.
But I can also ask what the heck
is in this damn thing.
So.
I know there's there's there's
some very good things in here.
There's there's things in here
that I would absolutely vote for
I would encourage everybody on
both sides and I'll vote for.
Is this the worst budget I ever
saw no.
No.
But I am concerned.
I don't know few minutes before
we come in here to vote on it.
And and and and and two hundred
and forty page document.
Having this one page of high
Or hundreds of thousands of
dollars little amounts compared
to eight and a half billion.
Their stuff in there.
There's there's just a handful
of people in the state that
actually know where any of that
stuff this.
And they've hidden it from all
of you all.
In the department of health
under the epidemiology thing.
To study gun violence it's not
violence.
In their it's.
In fact it's so well hidden that
you can't even find reference to
it in here you have to look it
Really really really tried hard
to understand what's going on in
this budget we've tried very
hard to figure it out.
And I have to I have to
And the amazing thing to me is
when I say thank Charles can you
show me this.
He'll probably open he might not
even open it he'll tell me to
This is the biggest thing we do
all year.
This is the biggest thing that
happens in the state of New
Mexico.
This.
year has really tried.
To make things a little more
open and and and accessible the
house bill two junior I think
that was great so instead of
everybody lining up in front of
with that in in and I applaud
that process.
And I think that actually help
our communities and helped us
individually.
A direct question they will show
you exactly where it is in
there.
Would have to ask Miss Iglesias
I'm torn because quite literally
the other day.
I opened up.
The page here and I read one of
these paragraphs this was two
hundred nine thousand dollars
for mortgage regulatory fund.
What a mortgage regulatory fund
is.
And I can do this on page after
page after page.
It's one paragraph I can read
understand that one.
How many feel of read this
document.
The whole thing.
I've read big chunks of it and
I've read those big chunks
because I wanted to know about
the department of health or
education or whatever it was I
This is a big deal this is
something that we should have
discussed.
A lot more often.
Bits and pieces of it even if it
up there how long Here gonna
talk is going to be one hour
seven hours in okay somebody up
there has been already this is
that somebody will interfere
with mental shut me off after
two.
So.
So the question really is.
We want to support this budget.
Fourteen percent is a lot.
And I know I've been told I even
understand that a lot of this is
to back fill things where we had
recurring revenue that I think
could be nonrecurring revenue.
For example.
We have.
Why is that.
What doesn't make complete sense
to me.
Because the only reason we're
hitting those kind of Medicaid
levels today.
on Medicaid that would stay on
Medicaid until the pandemic was
over.
we know today that there are
about eighty thousand people
that are ready to come off of
they have good jobs are doing
okay.
Other tax payers.
We should consider the other tax
And I believe we could do that
because we do have the
obligation we promise the Feds.
We could go two hundred fifty
million dollars as nonrecurring
And we might even be able to
study this thing because we won
be sucked our own carbon dioxide
back in your head.
That brings our.
Our increase down around eight
or nine percent.
Our reserves are going to be
colossal here and I promise you
as soon as a Russian tank
crosses you recruit training
border.
Barrel of oil will go to a
reserves on this that's huge and
what does it do to you.
Thank your life absolutely
miserable you won't be able to
drive to the grocery store much
less to Santa Fe.
that our budget still has a
healthy increase.
Eight or nine percent.
But we also know that inflation
is at least seven probably
We
And I think that's a good thing.
I think that's a great thing.
just have a seven percent
because inflation again.
It will be a lot more money.
Because of the thing that they
call compounding.
If it's nonrecurring.
That brings that whole thing
down to what I believe is a
increase for our department of
public safety.
I think that's important.
Those are those are folks that
are out there the quite
The problem is most people don't
know what's in it.
You've heard snippets.
You've heard some Republicans
talk about the bad stuff in
there we certainly heard
Democrats talk about the good
stuff in there.
Neither one of more alliance.
decisions we're making here not
just how much money we gonna
spend.
These are policy decisions.
And so some of these decisions
That's what this asks.
How much you gonna spend on
housing are you going to buy a
new car this year is it going to
decisions that you make for your
house and we're making here.
And what we making these
decisions on that piece of paper
right there.
Really important things.
Because even if you're making
eighty five thousand dollars a
year.
Do you have people that you want
to put through college.
Are you trying to start your own
small business how much of a
loan can you get off of that.
Similar number in the house.
Half of which I don't know we're
consider germane half of those
are going to make it to the
floor.
People are going to be all
And any of you all about reading
it right now while I'm babbling
on you're taking an opportunity
you're wasting an opportunity.
So we had to go to the section
for I'm not sure exactly that
starts here.
For read more.
long enough to let everybody
read this thing in the what's in
it.
Absolutely NO you ought to
highlight some things are
certain some things and then you
ought to ask the gentleman is
What that tells me is.
well.
I know.
policy decisions that all of the
for folks to vote on.
We're little focused on yep I
needed that.
In or out and I got it done.
You'll find that some counties.
Some counties have made out
quite well.
Why is it there what we doing.
What we do.
Mr president.
And that brings down the percent
increase.
And I think all of us can go
home and say Hey.
We did good things for the state
of New Mexico we did good things
for the people of New Mexico.
And we always have been.
And it in we've got most got a
thirty to twenty eight percent
The tax this four hundred
million for tax reform haha
that's not really tax reform in
fact there's nothing about the
tax reform packages that I've
give money to but we gonna give
solar tax credit so that people
have a really nice house can put
solar panels on it.
Seems like we might do that
that's what tax reform.
G. R. T. if that gets here a
quarter percent year one quarter
of one percent one quarter of
one now think about this.
We would see that it's not tax
reform.
Not even close to tax reform we
have four hundred million
dollars in there.
For decade I've been trying to
do tax reform and for a decade
we have shown our cow weirdly
side but not even getting close
to talking about it.
Because we're all afraid what if
we screw it up.
Eight thirty.
On Valentine's night.
Hope you all love each other a
lot.
numbers and everything else
we've done in this building this
year's been twenty six fifteen.
And I know people say well LESC
got to look at it.
I would like to point out to the
president pro tem the people on
Senate finance we're not on LESC
so we didn't get to look at it.
I wish that there were things
that we could do here.
I wish that I was is gentlemanly
and Senator Ortiz the penal of
But we need to figure out.
What policies were putting in
here.
know what we don't have a clue
what we're finding that you
don't want to fund.
The process I believe.
All of us understand things.
But I also know.
So what am I gonna do Mister
chair Mister president.
I don't know yet.
I don't know yeah.
things I don't want to cut
Medicaid but I do want to book
it differently.
Our department of health.
Their numbers in here are pretty
big.
Most of us don't even know that
the whole yeah I did for one
match what does that mean well
it means twenty one billion
dollars that's what it means for
interesting is Senator Woods
Becker he's asked for contracts
because they'll say we you know
got ten billion dollars whatever
contracts and they're.
But anybody in here making money
off of those contracts.
Or is a relative of yours making
money off of those kind we don't
know.
We don't know we still don't
know.
Now fortunately I believe we
took that out.
What did we want to buy land.
There's a whole bunch of weird
stories out there but it appears
to hunt on that land and didn't
want to have to pay the ranch
owner.
Wow if that story is true and I
don't know if it's true or not.
And I'm glad for that that's one
of those things that that we
stumbled on.
What the hell is that about.
This is really so one legislator
can hunt in peace.
Sure felt like that.
Somewhere in here.
All we have to have not yet
We gave our teachers seven we
gave our police officers fifty
sixteen.
And we're talking about giving
the governor forty.
And as much as I love you Mr
president.
I want to give you forty either.
I would be in favor of giving
you sixteen percent because
that's we gave police officers.
And in one case I think it's P.
Garcia fifty five percent
increase.
Forty percent for you.
Well we pretending we love.
The teachers.
before that why.
Because we are still forty eight
forty nine fifty if in every
good list.
Our economic development
opportunities of always failed
some of them are going to fail
right here in this room probably
tonight.
Only forty percent raises I know
somebody's got all know was only
thirty eight point seven okay
fine.
Robust debate about.
You don't need me up here.
There are bad things in this
bill.
There are policy issue bad
things in this bill.
Policy issue things.
know Mister president no budget
no budget is perfect I know that
the budget that I have at my
house isn't perfect I think I
know what I'm gonna do and then
all my gosh you know the roof
I know in my own house.
We're I think I've got things
laid out.
Well that that those those are
policy decisions.
It inside my house my wife and I
have to make.
But certainly better to make
those policy decisions.
What's really important to us.
Is a trip to Europe really
important to us.
Maybe.
Maybe that's the most important
thing.
Or do we want to downsize our
house.
Or do we want a new car.
things that we're doing here.
What policy are we talking about
here.
decisions already made in caucus
we shall not.
Do whatever it is we're not
going to do.
We will never consider this.
We will not do hydrogen why
because fossil fuels when we are
going to die.
help us if it's going to put our
folks back to work if they're
going to have good high paying
jobs.
Then we at least think about it.
Well no we're not.
But if that's a real concern how
do we how do we deal with that
concern.
Can we do both.
In all of history.
Both.
But we've made policy decisions
ramifications good in that.
One of the interesting things
is.
You put hydrogen in those big
over the road.
Trucks.
Environmentally.
I would think that would be a
great thing.
But we've decided never.
And in this particular case.
Economic development that takes
us off of this roller coaster.
It levels things out.
It makes things smoother.
Because we have to wait to we
have the F. revenue estimate on
the price of oil and gas.
yeah there's a few other things
out there to pay the bills.
But we have to wait for that
We could make it level
We made a policy decision that
we made it right here.
We're gonna talk about doing tax
reform.
Willett you Mr president.
Pay bracket because well.
I don't yet have your forty
percent raise.
Dollar eighty four for the
lieutenant governor that's how
much is going to save in gross
But we have the money right
here.
Four hundred million dollars
plus a hundred twenty five
million dollars for the hydrogen
actually give people a thousand
dollars back.
That's about a third of what
what the taxpayers gave us we
can give individual people money
back.
We can put in some guard rails
up and down make some things
make sense for everybody.
But we can give people money
Leaving with the governor signed
it just like from scientists
thank.
But a thousand dollars back
versus two dollars.
back then we won't have to spend
on these really useful things we
have to spend it on all of the
services that we have to give
people.
actually paid the taxes in a
little of it back.
What I'm talking about is not
big corporate tax rebates for
corporate welfare I'm talking
about individual human beings
The firefighters in the in the
police officers.
The small business owner this
struggling through all of this
comment in these masks and
Can we give them some money back
right now there's room for that
in this budget.
There's room to do that.
dollars to get a check for five
hundred dollars what are they
going to do they're going to
spend it.
They're going to put it back in
the economy and they're going to
help create jobs and they're
We can give them a thousand
dollars there's room in this
budget to do that.
We can still.
Help those on social security.
We can still help those military
families.
Did we shouldn't be taxed right
now.
Because those are a great group
Out of an eight point five
billion dollar budget.
We can do all of that.
people to put new windows in
people's houses.
Another policy decision it's in
here.
We're going to pay landlords to
Landlords are happy about that
why not why not give a tax break
to the rich already.
We have a policy decision in
here about solar tax credits
the poor the right there are two
gigantic tax breaks for the
rich.
And yet for whatever reason.
Rebates are immoral.
Those really are the blue collar
jobs.
Those really are the small
business.
That's the small restaurant tour
who's been struggling and
manage to stay alive through
this.
And we've made a policy
decision.
That they don't deserve help.
given the oil companies any
money.
That's not my plan.
We've made those decisions.
In this budget.
Turn me up Mr president.
Vote against the department of
public safety.
Vote against the public
employees although I will tell
him to vote against you if I
could do that just individually
but not you personally just to
raise.
Tax breaks for the rich.
Which one this side of the aisle
to put those in.
Not this site ask for tax breaks
How do I tell them.
That's why this is so difficult
for me Mr president.
There's a lot of really good
stuff in here.
Its policy on roads.
Both good and bad.
This isn't just the money
the back and say Hey that's
what's all going to go.
You had an hour to ask
questions.
I have not given you an hour to
That tears my heart out.
In a thirty day session we have
one job.
what we just did were going to
do right now.
We don't even know.
Yes I did some of the highlights
bill heard the highlights to.
I find this is struggling with
this one too.
It's in here.
I personally believe because I
It's exactly what it's worth
exactly what you paid.
It's worth nothing if you don't
have some skin in the game I
think we should have some skin
in the game.
But if you don't pay for
anything if it's free to you.
That's exactly what you will
treated.
But if you had to put something
I'm also all the we we we thanks
to Senator Pirtle.
We finally got away.
To help pay for.
These important certificates.
Welding you can make more money
as a welder then you can just a
there's a family practice doctor
in New Mexico.
got that we got that in there.
That's huge.
There's all kinds of things.
Yes they did.
Some of those things.
It didn't go through committee
at least not the way you thought
What more to that bill.
The money is.
But the policy decision is why
should the welder.
Because that's what this.
This isn't just for for poor or
middle class people this for
everybody.
Pay for somebody else to go to
college when they in fact could
use that money.
For their own family.
But huge break to the rich to go
to college.
yeah we'll pay for the welder
now.
But it's going to cost a
work in a couple of months and
start paying taxes in a couple
of months and probably is going
to make more money than the
psychologist for the rest of the
Wilder's life.
Because again soon as I shut up
we're gonna vote.
Twenty six fifteen.
But I want to find a way to to
for this.
One simple thing is to do.
Tax rebates instead of giving
you all two dollars.
know maybe one of those small
restaurants for Valentine's day
maybe you can buy your your
spouse or significant other or
your mom.
Where you can save two Bucks
Walmart big box stores.
But apparently I was told today
I don't know if you lever for
don't I'm confused was actually
trying to help her out.
So confused.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What I know I'm not going to do
Because I'm I literally am
heartbroken literally.
Mr president.
And I was told.
We will not consider those we
will not consider economic
diversity we will not consider
And I know those aren't
wrestling this bill but they're
indirectly in this bill.
Craft the budget.
It was good.
And I think the budget itself is
not that.
that are impaired veterans one
two three four lines.
Most of them a forty six lines.
For all those cute little policy
I might vote for Mr president
because I can't vote against the
teachers and I can't vote
against police officers I might
vote against it because I can
vote against a range for the
And talk about some of the stuff
some time.
We still don't even do that.
We can talk about things without
people going off until may not
we can't do it.
Why.
We can't do that then what can
we do.
economic diversity plan comes
before us we tear it down.
Year after year after year we
talk about tax reform year after

serious economic state.
It's time for us to be step out
there and say.
Everybody in New Mexico has to

Those words that he could use
all the time versus the three
thousand that we use.
That was an education poem or
story.
Try to do it in fund.
People.
They are not native speaking
English speakers learn to be
fully literate in English.
because all they don't teach
they don't teach Spanish over
here they don't teach the NMAA
over there and we should okay.
I'm not opposed to that.
you want to see people skate on
fake snow.
It was built by slaves.
Their traffic controller to

Because it makes sense that you
have one language.
That all of the pilots in all of

Three one three point nine
billion dollars for education.
That's what we say their book
but we're not encouraging
anybody to go out there and
figure out how to teach
We have enough money to do that.
But we don't have enough
intestinal fortitude to go out
there and do that.
I mean what we by the way.
We can do those things.
the climate and water will run
out of water level about what we
do about it well nothing we're
piddling around the edges of
that.
Mr president I want you to think
can get through the the four
station and get down into the
ground it fills up that water

while I must say that it's at a
great disadvantage that many of
the members on Senate finance
were not appointed to LFC those
of us who wanted to remain
conservative there are two key
provisions but I would look at
one building this budget.
One is reserves.
That is a gigantic piggy bank.
And it allows us to responsibly
govern if our revenues decrease.

bank and for that we should be
appreciative as it follows

did in this budget and

And we're looking at the numbers
right now and the nonrecurring

or so if it's enough to actually
address their needs but it is
it's an issue where they
continually have to go into
like to ask about is
instructional materials funding.
it was brought to my attention
early on and so I don't know if
have you had any feedback from
districts about that and if so
what's being done about it.
Yes thank you Mr president
center I have not heard that
that the instructional materials
short in anyway.
Thank you Mr president thank you
senator says the funding the
same that was last year because
to be something that's going to
be a shortfall
We tend to try to fund at the
same every year even not really
need to think about that a
little bit more.
This presents inner I more
trying together numbers quickly
is can't may made a mistake it's
an eight million dollars that
then for she eight in the area
it I think we just need to work
a little better with our
districts.
and entrust with they're not
trying to make money out of it
they just want to pay for the
instructional materials that we
require on the other question I
have is throughout the budget
page just a as an example in
page ninety eight.
Under the department of health
budget and I I find this fall
contract contractual services.
I believe this twenty million
one hundred ninety seven
thousand in the general fund
dollars but if you look at the
contractual services water those
services and I know you don't
have a direct answer for that
because I popped it on you but
that's only really helped me in
the future as I'm looking at
having to use the the roving
arses this year analysts know
what they're called but the
travelling nurses there's a
right turn
the house what what is that I I
fifty nine those those a lot of
those are the real health
clinics that serve and they
contract out D. O. H. with the
rural health clinics that they
have And match federal funds

you have fifty nine million for
contractual services and eighty

actually it's even larger here
the dollar amount that you have
for personnel services seven
that for me especially not being
on the finance committee would
really be helpful to just kind
of have you here's an idea at
least of of what these
is there someone in this
building that's contracting is
there someone whose family but
we don't know because we just
have a line that says
contractual services since that
Mr chairman of the committee I I
do think that you've done some
things to improve the process.
but I also think there's a lot
of room to go you know I I heard
the committee the language have
been changed.
Where the legislators we get to
write the language is the
language is being changed it
needs to be approved by the
to be kept that way and not
coming into next committee
meeting that's not transparent
so I I just I asked the in the
future.
It's a ton of money.
And we just need to make sure
that that.
the I I want to Senator this
year when they were up here in
Santa Fe and I will continue to
try to do that it did help.
and I appreciate the amount of
concern is the recurring amount
I hope we're going to be a live
up to it a couple years.
we have some bills that passed
this floor that I'm not sure
dollars to education like we had
to do in the past thank you Mr
president thank you Center
appreciate your work on it and
I'll continue to listen to the
bank.
Senator for that you know we
have a lot of discussion during
the special around the art of
funds and you know I had a bill
this year that would have funded
some money to highway three
see a specific line item for
that but do we have some
language somewhere if you could
point me to it where the DOT
you know it's it's it's one of
those were you better say a
couple Vigil merry's before you
head that way it's being
truthful it's it's a very
dangerous stretch of highway and
it's something that we really
need to address especially now
could point me Mr president and
and Mr chair and for the my all
of my constituents and other all
watching at home on the edge of
their seats so if you could
point you to page two twenty of
of the budget and if you look at
language in the second line and
maybe use for their some
language for roads and they're
not name the all of them listed.
looking at it there's an
additional fifty million dollars
a maintenance repair and that
can be used they have federal
funding the have a new hundred
million dollars in the federal
words as may and instead of you
shall because everybody wants
their road paved to their house
and they want to make sure that
they have the funds to do that
but the big issue with DOT the
I think DOT has the flexibility
with that language in may the
road needs to be planned in
their step and I think that road
is in their five year plan to
input they'll be able place a
hundred million there.
And thank you Mr president thank
you Mr chair for for putting
that out there you know I was I
was really hoping we could get
it a little bit more specified
public safety issue especially
on that stretch of road and now
especially now that people have
options to go to other states
we've been locked down so long
Sunday evenings and Monday
mornings that's probably one of
the most dangerous stretches of
highway in New Mexico so you
know I appreciate on the five
year plan but it really needs to
be on let's get it done now we
is definitely a stretch of
highway that although the the
condition of the road is is
quite nice without passing lanes
people are are driving
ridiculous and dangerously and
so hopefully part of
transportation will take that
little bit of money that we have
there I know to a large projects
of the mountain gods and other
places yeah that's a good thing
Mr president bringing in new
money as opposed to recycling
and it's it's a real important
thing for southeastern New
reserves up a little bit but
when you look at other states.
It's that that also have oil and
gas dependence like we do
Wyoming's at one of their lowest
rates in a long time and I think
responsibly in a state like ours
where we are so dependent on the
price of oil price of natural
gas but I do appreciate that the
work to at least get to twenty
three percent because there's
with the come up with a system
that that hopefully works best
for everybody so I do appreciate
that now granted I I would like
it to be higher
but you know hopefully the DOT
of Ross will that we really need
and for really does so in
surrounding cities thank you Mr
president.
Thank you center Pirtle we have
further debate center by the.
some really unusual ideas here
to the Senate and I wondered why
in the heck did in those things
get funded and provide affecting
those things happen Mr present
you are often coaching me on
some of those projects and
trying to begin to bring a lot
more transparency to the
budgeting process I feel very
good about that and I I was very
worried about it I thought my
goodness my going to the
committee my gonna have to be
sitting there for ten or fifteen
thank us Senator Diamond and
Senator Woods Senator share
Senator Burt I think that when
it was time to speak up in the
but I don't think that we should
negate then we should forget
about a few wonderful things
that are going to happen because
of this budget and and I just
took to determine which is yield
I want us just a few questions
so I do want to ask you know Mr
chairman is is is other members
the democratic members of the
committee fought clawed and
tried really hard to get a lot
of different things done you we
is the range of raises for state
employees this year word is what
what's the lowest raise if you
could tell us and what's the
highest rates than anyone else.
wage and and to avoid compaction
so those are what's gonna flow
through and it depends if you're
state general employee or how
that how that system works and
end would you say is the the
high percentage for races.
Mr president center there there
is no pay increases in this
budget.
and sold us the bill that you
see on the floor is for other
elected officials that is not in
the budget there's no pay
increases for elected officials
but you're gonna see anywhere
bands and compaction and how do
you keep employees that have
been there five years to new
high difference from new hires
and it's a very hard system
toward.
And so.
couple months making a base pay
of fifteen and somebody that's
been there for five years given
that thirty three percent
difference on top of that so
they can avoid compaction.
Sentiment yes.
Mr presence inter a one percent
and I'm pretty sure I think I
know this off the top of my head
but they're they're double
checking it.
level one two and three teachers
we did school districts across
the board.
And so those pay increases are
calculated differently in every
compaction that one percent is
equal to about.
For.
Forty.
Forty million dollars.
economy all over the state we
have teachers in every community
every nook and cranny in hamlet
and village and we in every town
every city here in New Mexico so
that's a really exciting thing I
think we're going to see some
back into the economy so I'm I'm
really happy about that
if you talk a little bit about
tax cuts to to the tune of what
amount did you say Mr chairman
we're going to see tax cuts
across New Mexico and what
reduction tax rebates tax cuts
for social security tax cuts for
veterans there's a lot of ideas
I haven't looked at the house
happening and so the four
hundred million that we have in
there in capacity can committee
for merry many things in
including rebates and tax cuts I
appreciate that Mr president so
negative six hundred eighty
million dollars the could
potentially be moving right back
into the New Mexico economy that
that's also something that we
should rejoice and we should be
celebrating Mr president we saw
transportation and roads package
what's gonna look like.
In terms of dollars.
Mr presence seven Senator about
additional fifty million
maintenance repairs and plus we
have no idea what the hundred
million the feds are going to
eighty million dollars in wages
four hundred million dollars
possibly with this tax package
another four hundred million
dollars with regard to
transportation projects and and
and ideally these are all over
economic development I know that
that's sort of the other side of
the column but that but what
what we gonna do for economic
development in the areas of lead
J. tip the specs base that you
were talking about Mr chairman
for about fifty million dollars
including their unexpended
balances of about seventy
million and some need to be
revert and and need to be taken
care plus J. tips about another
they're claiming that the film
academy which is a forty million
dollar investment
should help stimulate the
economy.
I appreciate that Mr president I
together Mr president so even
after all of that and even after
this you know this budget that
we have this year which is of
historic proportions for the
state of New Mexico we're still
fluctuate revenue forecast for
Health flat during the session
we see that oil and gas is it
about ninety today and that
we're watching that reserve
thirty one thirty thirty one
percent depending on the market
in the economy so that that
number is is a moving target but
we're gonna see what happens
the high reserve level we have
to have any New Mexico we know
we ride that roller coaster.
I can tell you in twenty
seventeen I think center Brandt
mentioned something about that
paychecks because we were dead
broke.
Dead broke.
And so as people complain about
having a high reserve it's

Thank you Mr president are we
addresses that issue by doing
two things one it makes it so
that testing supplies which
would allow someone to use a
testing strip to see if there's
behavior in response to it the
other thing it would do is make
sure that the harm reduction
program that is administered by
the department of health has the
the current federal crisis by
other issues they're likely to
come up in the future because
new drugs like this are being
created literally every day I my
couple of numbers Mr president
is that the centers for disease
control counted about seventy
thousand six hundred and thirty
substance abuse overdose deaths
the nation's average Mr
president since then opioid use
often contaminated with Sentinel
and I know Mister president this
has many different communities
the bill that we are discussing
truly will help make a
difference for all of us in the
state of New Mexico.
I know you'll back to Senator
Duhigg Senator Lopez Senator
know since version this bill was
introduced last year and they
didn't make it to the finish
line but you know since that
time I believe two hundred and
been worked out really well
within all the issues you know
it's kind of complicated but not
really on a certain level is
just common sense
for doing a stellar job
Representative on on bringing
this to our Senate floor thank
you.
Senator Rodriguez thank you Mr
can do something different with
the real problem that has gotten
so bad that we need to step up
to the plate and do something
different this is a very good
we have center would serve on
Senator Woods.
I'm sorry I didn't get to hear
this bill in committee agency
president so if I could just ask
supplying of this drug drug
paraphernalia.
Will occurred substance abuse Mr
president Senator.
Before I mentioned that though
the overall point of harm
reduction isn't necessarily to
and substance use it's too it's
it also does is it's a hook to
get people on a path to
treatment because when they come
to get the supplies they're also
getting set up Mr president with
they want to pursue treatment
there's a path there for them to
do so they have support of
connections around them they're
going to help them do so so
while harm reduction isn't
is that when folks.
Have information that they're
spending on the substance that
they are intending to consume
New Mexico two different
they tend to have people around
them to reduce the chances of
them overdosing and dying but
also think about.
addicts but perhaps there is
this drug available to them and
their figure that if they're
going to experiment with that or
not and they get the information
that that has spent on it that
that is probably going to kill
you don't have statistics but.
You've got a strong belief.
Mr president.
provided to me by the the policy
folks at the department of
health who brought this bill.
Senator Woods in and Mister
president how much training will
have to go into our Law
To do illegal things for our
cell a legal drugs or or do any
of that thing because we are now
don't understand that miss
present maybe maybe that
explanation of what I need
Senator Senator.
and Mister president senator so
member of the or if you're not a
participant in harm reduction
program Mr president then that
you this exception to the
paraphernalia definition
really robust training already
with overdose prevention that
they are provided to officers so
this will just be included in
the existing curriculum they
Say no we do have for the debate
center how to mail Mr president
I just stand in support of this
legislation in district five we
have an opioid epidemic and
us and ensuring that we have a
path forward and I stand in
support of this legislation
thank you thanks and have a
meal.
Since we do have for the debate
will have Senator goes followed
so I apologize what is your
tongue center would you brought
up the twenty last points that
you're already doing this if so
the big problem in New Mexico
was black tar heroin and so it
was set up in order to to
provide clean needles to folks.
people are primarily smoking
not shooting off and so that as
the harm reduction act stands
now the department of health
now so that's why we need this
bill to address the problem that
we have now.
Mr president center then will
not have after April fools day
the paraphernalia and in in the
just regular joint would that
not be.
Harder thing to stop the growth
of of federal.
be seen fennel laced marijuana
they're absolutely on the black
market has been fentanyl laced
marijuana I then that's what
that's that will probably
cannabis from and stat.
Representative center I hope
you're correct that it's not
welcome to Colorado thank you.
If you have further debate we
have Senator Brandt.
Thank you Mr president Senator
so I have just a.
I'm a little bit confused on
page
And then the the new areas that
you have your.
So I'm not sure if I'm reading
this right this is the
participation in this harm
reduction act so that means that
if you.
Can show that your participants
do have a card on that's a
that's an existing practice of
the harm reduction program we
also just codify that in this
You're allowed to have.
Everything in section a or just
the hypodermic syringes and
needles.
were given to you I harm
reduction program and then you
would also under this bill be
able to have other supplies that
were given again you got through
given to reduce overdose and
prevent the spread of infectious
disease
and you can have those testing
strips that again you get
through the harm reduction
So I'm just looking in this
section and I'm not seeing I see
Wirth says supplies are devices
obtained pursuant.
maybe it's in other sections.
by the harm reduction act.
that program so is that gonna be
marked in some special way if I
get a syringe from the harm
Senator thank you Mr president
and actually I have an expert
who I'd like to bring in at this
point to answer that question if
And also Josh this waste
wasteful Stross swapped Water
Act from the department of
so if you this or are we marking
in some way.
These.
Mister president senator no I
don't believe they are marked it
would be prohibitively expensive
to do so this presents that's
Then it would not be illegal for
them to have them.
But there's no way for us to
know whether they're getting
from that program Senator is
there.
Senator thank you Mr president
center so as part of the
training that's that will happen
something that is not among that
list has been provided to them
things are handing out then
that's probably not going to
qualify as something you got
under the harm reduction
program.
Provided under the program but
not that specific you are saying
is is the item class not the
specific item because we don't
mark the specific item.
for syringes they bought on
their own.
And Mister president etcetera so
that's already the case for as
far syringes go and it's not
It the the pair familiar part of
this that's just for the testing
strips the other things that are
already in given out harm
reduction kits everywhere is
choosing to smoke from a pipe
they're not there's not cutting
up their mouths and then sharing
that with someone else and
spreading disease that way.
because in a list all these
items.
Are those items that are listed
in a which our state the
prohibited here.
this would also expand that to
things like fentanyl test
strips.
Other and and I'm sorry Mr
come under that subsection eight
that you're referring to.
Look at starting at line twenty
one all of these things have to
harm by promoting reduced use of
non sterile items that's that's
to cover the odd things like
test strips that things apart
from hypodermic needles.
Thank you Mr president and and
then if we if we go past.
I've I've gone away from it so
I guess it was already that so.
What what's the change in three
section three of the two
thousand nineteen act as now
been compiled as.
Thirty one dash nineteen a dash
one.
Thank you Mr president.
Senator Duhigg close on the
bill.
Thank you Mr president I move
that house bill fifty to do now
pass and I ask unanimous consent
of the Senate that the record
If you wish to vote no please
raise your hand.
We have Senator gave us voting
no Senator Woods voting no.
By a vote of thirty two in the
affirmative three in the
next bill.
On final passage has been taken
and it is now subject to debate

entire section of showing water
rights or access and with that
Mr president I will.
A unanimous consent if I also
could Mr president to have two
I'd like to of.
Expert witnesses Kristin
Thompson who serves as the
director for the cannabis
control division and also the
Senator Lopez Mr president I
will stand for questions thank
will have the reader read first
and then we'll go right to you.
Sir Senate floor amendment
number one to Senate tax
business and transportation
members of the Senate as I
mentioned in my brief remarks
there was an amendment that
stripped out of of the bill
during our hearing and Senate
What I would call it a
compromise looking as to what we
can do to make sure that there
is still
source of water sufficient to
meet the water needs that's
related to the license that they
are applying for
so with that Mr president I will
stand for questions on the
amendment.
Office STO Mr president yes.
And thank you Mr president thank
you senator you know the
concerns in committee the reason
that the amendment flew through
regard to water does this
somehow alleviate some of the
concerns Mister president
senator that that many of us on
the committee regardless of
Senator Lopez I'm Mr president
Senator this is part of the
process of course of we're the
licensee has to come and and of
is asking that the applicant can
demonstrate but of course it's
still will fall on the division
of also just to make sure and
and clarify but you don't have
what I believe with this
senator with your expert there
how do they envision this
process going moving forward is
it just a simple question that
do you have a legal right to
and senator that you know I
don't have to prove up water
right to grow corn because I
just I have a legal right to
pump the water and it's already
cattle or something along those
lines are growing a small garden
so with this allow and make it
simpler for a farmer to just
check a box saying I have a
Mr president Senator Pirtle this
will help to simplify of a
process that currently is within
they have but at least at again
allows C.
The applicant to be able to do
that instead of having to go
through the process with the
see that going moving forward
would they simply say I've I've
leased a water rate three and a
half acre feet on five acres or
would they have to specifically
intent was to make it much more
simpler for for farmers to farm
as opposed to putting something
on the front into giving the
department or the division
Senator Lopez Mr president of
what we have here in front of us
that has a the potential of
course if it's adopted is with
that will happen when the
applicant comes in front of the
division so it is a combined
Senator Pirtle and thank you Mr
president center can we get an
idea though what that will look
like what what specific
information Mister president
senator well they have to
letter from the assessor from
the county in which the person
entity exists.
Senator Pirtle and Mister
grown indoors and and mostly
within urban settings but when
you get out in the rural parts
of the state and they don't have
a water provider there there
looking like to to to satisfy
the division.
Senator Lopez Mr president again
as has been as I previously
And Mister president center we
go back to the same thing if
somebody's renting or really if
there's a crop share situation
in the Ag industry they don't
have a legal right to the water
but they are sharing one person
is bringing the water in the
land and the other is bringing
the investment in product they
can't prove a legal right to the
check the box I have access to
Water Rights or I have least
water as opposed to coming up
with some
paperwork situation where
Mr president Senator if there's
an agreement and the agreement
is shown that will be accepted.
Pirtle and so Mister president
sometimes that's that's
difficult to do a lot of times
Water right is mortgage to a
bank and so they don't
technically own it there's a
out to somebody in a cannabis
related business.
Mr president my expert witnesses
to say that that would be
accepted and of course you know
Senator Pirtle.
So Mister president senator if
if there's another business in
the middle would they have to
per acre we've leased five acres
which is I would think adequate
to grow cannabis would that
suffice with the language that's
being proposed Senator Lopez.
Thank you Mr president
The details can be worked out
with all of the stakeholders
getting back to the to the same
the same issue is is what's
going to be asked because the
issue with the paragraph in the
reason it was stricken is
it just be check a box saying
that you have a legal right to
so many acre feet of water
through a lease without giving
too many specifics that it's B.
shows what they have on the
availability of the water
with their property and other
such they should have a copy of
what water rights are available
if they don't have that
we keep going back they don't
own the land they don't own the
water right they're leasing it
or they've created a crop share
situation.
How are they going to prove that
feet per acre or are we going to
make them prove it up find
onerous documentation which is
what we're doing now or can they
situation that we already have
that is quite onerous and hard
to say prove up.
Senator Lopez Mr president
centers I briefly seized
that verifies that you were
there that is part of the
demonstration that is required
in the amendment that we are
discussing.
So as part of the process and
part of that check off but you
that that's how it's going to be
interpreted this doesn't do what
the intent was with striking the
paragraph
it does alleviate some of the
of the issues out in our rural
parts of the state we're we're
just talking about I want to
grow different crops compared to
say corn or cotton or some other
you know and and I think it's an
important point Mr president
members of the body is when it's
on the front in like this you
can prove up that you have water
right but then there's nothing
domestic water some other water
to water their crops and then
they would be perfectly within
their right in within their
permit to do so so I understand
the goal here is to ensure that
and other things and there's
just a lack of enforcement and
really this with as we've
learned throughout the years
that any law without any
the road and so I think this on
its face yes it looks like we're
trying to do something that
really just lip service and I
think that was the point of
striking the.
farmers right that's what the
the point of this legislation
has supposedly been put out in
and claim to be that this is for
the small farmers but there's a
me that it's not going to be had
handled in the way that we
discussed in the committee where
you simply check a box saying I
have a legal right to water and
I swear to firms to that fact
especially with liability
of businesses and and how you do
that with LLC's that this is not
going to provide the protection
that they need and then it could
and affirm that they do have
either a lease or they own water
right and the number the amount
of acre feet per acre that they
is Mister president senator as
I've explained previously there
is a process of paperwork that
been meaning mentioning with
those who are leasing the
property
if you do have again show a
letter from the local assessor
from whoever it may be in the
will also mention that for
enforcement purposes of course
every
Entity that receives a license
still has to come back on a
farmer leases water to a M. R.
B. America marijuana related
business and then their name
pops up on here because they
they lease this water to a
marijuana related business and
parcel of land that they've that
they've put this lease to
because that's the biggest issue
is because it's a public record
there's no longer a plausible
that they do have access to
water that why would that
suffice and why don't we want
that to be sufficient that if
they do have access to add water
holders that then would show up
in a public records request.
Mr president Senator
the fence the federal government
can come in with regards to any
and everything else that you
have available for leasing again
as part of the recognition that
the department Division will
will give a grant that the Feds
the water it's about the fact
that they have a loan against
the land and against the water
rate
that they could call the notes
due because they are doing
business could the Feds then
call their notes do not I know
the answer is yes and so that's
where the concern comes in that
if we're wanting to allow people
because the landlord can't take
the risk of the federal
government calling the note do
and so I think that's the
biggest issue here is that they
do have access to the water they
so we're increasing the input
cost for people that are wanting
to get involved in this industry
on a small scale so that's one
of the reasons why we did the
amendment in Judiciary Committee
businesses that are trying to
get into this industry.
Senator Lopez.
I'm Mr president Senator and
speaking of course with my two
happen but when it still comes
back to what we're discussing
Mister president senator is
still making sure that those who
have the license that are
granted have do access to the
in you know I don't know that's
gonna make a lot of landowners
and people that have money
borrowed against land and water
rights feel really comfortable
that all they're not going to
come in
marijuana related business why
would we just make it.
Simpler just like anything else
it's just an act product the
waters there I think there's
why don't we just allow
businesses to get started grow
crops that there
leave that we've we've allowed
in made legal to do so and not
That that's not necessary Mr
president and senator the this
isn't necessary it's just
something that's going to
prevent people from getting in
that would like to get in it's
and it's going to prevent people
from being able to lease water
right because you're going to
create a situation where they
can't prove that they have a
legal right to it even though
they've leased it so again
For ex number of acres of water
on so many acres.
amendment this point in time is
at the applicants will contract
off the box on the list getting
information from the division as
to show again what they have
what the availability of the
water that they have and of
course whether is to to be used
permit simply checking a box and
saying I have a lease for ex
number of acres on X. X. number
of acres of land with X. number
Mister president senator are we
going to be able to have it as
simple as possible just a
statement saying I I've least X.
number of acres and X. X. number
stating as you have mentioned
but there again has to be a
demonstration a copy of the
lease whatever that is available
Hello Mr president center why it
why does the division need that.
I don't have to prove to anybody
For any other purpose than what
you have a right to do so why
are we putting this up front in
creating such a barrier for
witnesses they are taking notes
to see as to how after it this
is a adopted of course
to make sure that the process is
be as simple as possible and
possibly include Mr president
and senator simply checking a
box and putting the amount of
water one will have because I
understand the concern that
somebody will not have enough
concern is a moot point it's a
little bit of a chicken little
the sky is falling type
situation and so I want a verbal
commitment Mister president
senator that it is going to be a
Senator Lopez Mr Pratt Mister
president Senator as I
previously mentioned both the
division director and.
again taking into mind the
stakeholders who are part of the
process with regards for water
so there there's still I think
Mr president Senator some work
Representatives and
superintendent of course will
make sure that it is a
simplified it as best as
possible.
Senator.
there's such a a push back on
this I don't know.
What is to be gained by the
Either you have a commercial
right somebody Albuquerque you
have a meter those guys are
gonna be okay is gonna be simple
you get a simple letter.
in trying to prove up who has
the water we're creating a
situation that makes it almost
impossible to even get started.
And so I I think everybody in
the body should have concern
to or the what is being put out
is that that's what the intent
of this is to do but essentially
what we're creating is a
going to be indoor is there
gonna have an advantage.
In our larger corporations that
are gonna come in with all the
all the money are gonna have an
advantage but are small farmers
are gonna be at a disadvantage
were using water illegally
because all you have to do now
is prove that you have a water
right we can still pump water
illegally either out of a
domestic well or out of a ditch
alter your motives were of the
groups that are pushing back on
this it really doesn't make
sense to me having a and an
understanding of how Water
Rights work
from what these farmers are
going to be growing
but you know if somebody is in
charge of a ditch they're in
charge of how much water people
get regardless of what crop they
with it when you have
somebody that's in charge of the
head gates and in charge of the
dates for the water how is it
going to get out of hand if if
why is the division fulfill the
desire to be in the middle of
the of those types of disputes.
with the water demonstration of
water rights there are many
others across the state and it's
not just again those who may be
in northern New Mexico but there
of course to do use much more
water.
But I think in the drought
situation that we are Mister
president senator this is
have access to the rights to the
water
that can be used for this this
product that they are growing at
this point in time Mr president
of those who are of producing
cannabis and if they do break
the law in any way shape or form
the Division Department can
a simple light a simple
application process is something
a requirement that should and
can be met.
state that sometimes it's not
that simple as I just carry
around a paper showing that I I
have a water right and and
really how situations like this
make the the additional product
in any of of the applications
that I put in even though that
is a very water intense
some of these groups that are
pushing for for verbiage that's
not necessary that's going to
prevent people from from getting
into the industry that we
supposedly say up front that we
this because I have to use a lot
of water to grow the corn that
then goes into the essentially
the beers that I additional into
Bourbon but yet on this product
Senator Lopez.
Mister president senator again
systems in the state also so I
at this is much more
comprehensive than just
targeting one particular group
and as I've mentioned Mister
president some of the
and how we are working within a
smaller
Communities with regards to
access for water so again Mr
president my argument still
So Mister president senator the
three hundred emails I have all
from us acequia related
multiple times and and the
concerns weren't really
justified.
I I really want to try to
understand Mr president Senator
somebody could abuse this if if
they're in charge of ensuring
that the only those that have
water rights are using the water
rights why do we need R. L. D.
water.
Mister president senator you
know there's an example
growers who are buying a
residential lot that is served
by a small water system they
connect to the system plant
their crop and use the community
Have of certain availability and
this puts that small system and
violation of their their permit
that they have so as as I say
Mister president what this is
accessing water in different
communities have adequate water
to grow the product.
Mr president center I appreciate
that but that's a simple letter
association and so that's simple
that's a simple letter but even
that Mr president Senator
doesn't actually limit the water
user to a specific amount.
get by if you use a thousand
gallons a month.
That doesn't then limit the
person to use less than or up to
a thousand gallons per month you
just act asking that they
ammendment use more water than
what can be
I guess legally provided without
them going over so what in this
ammendment what in the
application process is going to
protect that now that we've kind
accountable to the amount of
water that they feel that can be
sustained.

A licensee of.
Is using more water that is
allocated for that particular
small water system just asking
again that gives notice in the
community is much more aware and
again again that brings the
stakeholders together to
determine so that the permit for
this is a part of what we're
trying to do is to make sure
that there's in in asking for
the demonstration is that all
the stakeholders and the
community are aware
So Mister president center
simple no would have sufficed
that they don't have the ability
to hold them accountable to how
much water they use so this does
water then there there isn't
anything there to hold them
accountable for over using the
the allocated amount or the
amount that was estimated so
what we gonna do Mr president
that they're going to use or
that they have available.
Senator Lopez.
I'm Mr president Senator
Mr president Senator then of
course the supplier of them

Senator Pirtle.
Mr Browde I guess.
the industry that we want in the
industry so I guess in New
Mexico will continue to be last
and everything and continue to
pass ridiculous laws that
just we're not going to to do
what we say we're going to do
and it's just unfortunate to me
that that we have you know
amendments like this we fix the
eight out of nine members that
agreed with with that change
because of the roadblock of that
paragraph and yet we're going to
put that roadblocks right back
in place and and there's a lack
We do have further debate on the
amendment Senator heck.
Thank you Mr president I just
before the body before we take
have any financial interest in
this piece of legislation either
directly or indirectly.
Thank you we have further debate
on the amendment will have
senator Neville full by Senator
concerned about to I was not
sure exactly why those those
that section was struck in the
during a visit by the judiciary
I believe right and I wasn't
quite sure what we're putting
can tell you is that the
assessor will not give you are
the county clerk will not tell
you how much water anybody has
so just for your information of
I got only have answers that I
for questions I had from the
previous discussion thank you Mr
president.
Thank you senator Senator
Sedillo Lopez.
the state in which water is
going to be the most scarce
resource that we're going to
have to deal with over the next
of.
Dozens of years of my
transfer a water right from a
domestic water right but to to a
commercial of water right and to
do that paperwork and so what
this ammendment does is it
applicant demonstrate that
requires some evidence of and
and so whether it's going to be
I would be unhappy with this is
what was just check the box
pump water with a should not be
pumping water at the surface of
the ditches and and that needs
to be stopped it is up to the
state engineer to monitor the
application is to make sure that
this new industry all these
people who are newly going into
the industry have the water and
are not interfering with water
appropriate as actually shocked
when I heard that that Judiciary
stripped off a whole section
dealing with the protection of
our water rights and that would
have opened it up to big users
water to do this thus putting
our traditional ways of life are
a second as prior users.
And all the rest of us at risk
of inappropriate uses of water
working out of this ammendment
To both address the problem that
was identified in Judiciary but
doing it without throwing the
Thank you Mr president is
present I want to begin by
saying something I said
committee will to superintendent
to heal which is she's earned my
again tonight because I I do
trust your judgment even very
straight very honest in a job is
very difficult for you I'm sure.
Any work very hard in.
Which version of the bill.
Either the version that came out
of Judiciary or the version that
would be created by the a floor
amendment which in your opinion
Mr president Senator the
small business would have to
show as we have been discussing
this evening will actually have
an intent of saving of that
And it's it's something that she
is a has said that she will work
with very closely to make sure
on the oversight how this is
implemented but again for her
If they would have to close and
then again a waste of money.
Members present center and I
appreciate the answer but
that came out of Judiciary or
the bill that would be amended
from for which would make it
easier for small growers of
marijuana to get a license from
the department.
Mr president Senator serve on
But but she also mentions to is
that it with the amendment
placed on the bill it also
sure that of up front that they
do have access to the water
required to grow the crop and
again Mr president of we as we
have discussed during special
session as we have been
this is a big chunk of change
and this is with the amendment
helps to to guide it's a
guidance in a safety net.
gestures you're still being
honest and the honest answer to
the question after struggling I
think with the question is the
bill that came out of Judiciary
amendment on the floor will make
it harder for small growers.
And that's why I think perhaps
my colleagues so you're in the
chamber sometimes struggle with
the groups who have opposed the
purport to be those looking out
for I think generally believe
they're looking out for small
growers in New Mexico.
But really there misinterpret
out of Judiciary a licensee a
person who wants a license would
not have to go through trying to
prove the state engineer or
somebody else they have a water
right.
Now by this ammendment.
division to know how much water
it takes to grow a crop in
plants and production which
division may or may not have on
on a grower in the former it's
And this chambers to familiar
with us lawyers making a big
deal about hands on course and
if someone gets in shells and
So Mister president senator.
If I may the water could be
right on mutual domestic could
cut it.
Mr president Senator yes for a
letter from the Albuquerque
Bernalillo county water
authority that could cut it.
Mr president Senator yes and I
want to find a could be the
Carlsbad irrigation district.
Mr president if they are a
define who water provider is so
I'm trying to figure out who is
water provided they can
authorize a license from growing
marijuana in the state.
controls the growth in controls
a great deal of our society and
so in this case here she who
controls what is going to
control the licenses.
In this case now the division
authority for water use of
Bernalillo county.
They could approve the granting
of a licence or they could deny
the granting of a licence that
district PVA CD and any number
of irrigation districts in the
state because they will argue
that their water providers.
And they can then authorized the
oftentimes provided by a private
water company.
We have what private water
providers in my minorities
removed a water company
privately on.
I'm sorry Senator Mr president
Senator could you repeat your
question yeah sure and I
appreciate again really do
appreciate the superintendents
role in this discussion.
the city lobsters but they used
to for many years they're very
private water company I presume
Senator my correct that the
private water company would meet
the definition of a water
engineers office months ago.
Well I'm not sure what that
would mean the cleared by the
state engineers office as the
state insurance office I have a
definition for what is a water
Incentives are clear the
submitted that would include a
private company private company
that sells Water.
Mr president center yes and that
would include I presume parts
And so what I appreciate the
spirit of the amendment I think
that of the earlier answers my
question is the the bill that
came out of Judiciary helps
small growers in New Mexico.
determine whether a license is
gonna be granted by whether they
usual letter saying that that
there's water.
Not include private companies
private water companies
Albuquerque Bernalillo water
control because let's be Frank.
There are probably five or six
growers who already control half
the market.
And we go to the top ten growers
ship has sailed.
And the big growers already have
their water rights and they've
already got their licenses never
got their applications.
I appreciate the efforts trying
compromise and try to find
something good but more than
that I appreciate the
superintendents forthright
work makes it easier for small
growers to get into the
marijuana business and the
member on the floor today makes
it hard.
Thank you Mr president.
just reiterate that and they're
not some of the concerns were
eight of nine concerns I'm not
going to go through anymore
analysis I think of my fellow
committee and in answering the
questions poster here today.

accept the amendment that came
For the second time we have
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Thank you I appreciate the
explanation of by the chair of
Judiciary but yes the question
It would make it if I may Mr
president Senator it makes it
easier for small growers but
also the big growers to.
water and not have any kind of
examination up front is of
concern to me has we and the
issue of whether of who's going
provide water and this person
has access to water or no it
isn't it would be inappropriate
and probably subject to then
some level of protection and
it's up to the state engineers
office to monitor whether people
are
using water of consistent with
putting at least this level of
protection of all of the people
in New Mexico who are not
growers in who are not
interested in getting the
business but protecting their
