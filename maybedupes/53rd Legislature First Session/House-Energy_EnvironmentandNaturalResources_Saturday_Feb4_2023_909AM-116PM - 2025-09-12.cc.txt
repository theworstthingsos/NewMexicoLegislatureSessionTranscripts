People it is four of our members
are expropriations.
we have one here three missing.
Yeah that was awesome.
so.
It's it's not ideal the best
speaker off speakers this year.
At the.
Coordinating we've been seeing
so that it.
we also.
That is the practice of this
committee to to not
take those four people are
temporarily out of.
If that absence will thank them.
which is not.
Voice.
so we may get to a point where
we need to vote if we're gonna
positive or gas people to come
to the right to the.
Which is is not ideal.
Course Idaho all of the members
I I I don't think anyone's out
sick.
Everyone in the building stuff.
Alright.
I haven't heard otherwise in the
end we separately present.
Yeah.
It's a small provisions Dixon is
appropriations in Rubio's in.
Roads here they're just that.
So that's the first and second
is first first two bills today
has committee sept.
in the Representative stock.
This rule change to publish
the committee says offline there
in the bill and we do try this
last year seven if you go past
this year there's been a lot of
hand wringing about all wells
since the more we can do that
whenever you do that.
Yeah so there are.
The Serbs for House Bill one
forty one ninety one for us.
Which is.
So the reason I mention that the
is there for fairly substantial
reacts.
so if you are checked into
language that is.
What we do here ninety one I
really encourage you to go up to
the legislature's website
portability and see if that
language is still in the bill.
Because why not and this is part
of the reason why it's important
for us I think the policies that
is so we don't.
in public testimony about these
are the longer.
So if you're listening at all if
you're not is members of the
committee just just be aware
that that's going on
there should be for members of
we anticipate this.
For you to pass out the ninety
one this is return to the
island.
Although if you wanted to do
that.
The questions.
Investments.
Basically saying that
The first we have to do is
hospital and for to generate
facility in minor mediation
this is a chance to rewrite our
leader this bill.
it's a public comment we also
think
we're not doing public comment
we're gonna go straight to the
committee set up
in we'll discuss that.
so with that region all.
Of the four years but perhaps it
should do the the set for
discussion.
The.
Question for this yes the
committee said is there any.
Action.
Representative Allison he
Representative so we can go and
I think you did so hello we
would you like to go over the
changes in the committee so.
This.
Thank you very much here and
madam chair and.
Distinguished members of this
committee.
Thank you for hearing us this
morning.
I'd like to thank you chairman
cream for evaluation to rule the
field last Saturday and hi along
with my co sponsor and experts
almost immediately went to work
with the this suggests that
people that we meet with he met
with of in that in him there to
revise the bill the committee
substitute before you is the
product of that fruitful
discussion.
Additionally I believe that we
resolved all the specific issues
that you chairman between race
as well.
Very quickly I'd like to address
the important provisions of the
bill but before I do I want to
remind my colleagues that the
San Juan generating station at
the seven one money recently
closed after fifty years of
operation.
Last week you learned that the
San Juan generating station have
produced more than fifty nine
million tons of coal ash and
other toxic contaminants to be
disposed of in online pits.
As I shared the purpose of this
bill is prevention.
The analysis and cleanup plan
required in this bill will
ensure that toxic metal
contaminants don't leach into
the groundwater and leak into
waterways or otherwise harm
public animals or agriculture
and costs negative public health
consequences for the people of
San Juan County and beyond.
If we fail to act in a timely
manner this very serious injury
to our health land and water is
foreseeable.
The committee substitute
authorizes in math and EMNRD to
hire outside consultants
environmental engineers
hydrologists geochemist and
other professionals who have
experience with coal plant and
money closer to perform an
independent comprehensive
assessment and report back to
the legislature legislature the
results of the assessment will
be posted online.
The elegance of this bill is
that it does not prescribe.
Is to be done therefore there
after but it does require
oversight and enforcement to be
determined based on the findings
of the independent assessments.
No later than June or July first
of twenty twenty five in men and
EMNRD shall provide a copy of
remediation restoration study to
the legislature can present
specific measurable steps
informed by input from impacted
communities to oversee and
enforce for remediation and
restoration plans including to
the extent possible the cleanup
of the generating facility and
money and prioritizing for
employment workers who were
previously employed generation
generating facility in mind and
workers residing in New Mexico.
Presentation of the studies show
up to current the meeting of the
Legislative interim committee
dealing with water and natural
resources and shell detail how
the minerals and natural
resource department and the
department of environment shall
ensure timely environmental
compliance with the owners of
the generating facility and
money to protect public health
and welfare.
This is the heart of the bill
the bill also requires yearly
updates to the legislature we
are present for questions for
future wishes to proceed with a
vote.
Thank you very much and I share.
thank you it also.
Thank.
Senator.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Into that.
Yes this question.
Bill we could go but.
Okay modifications.
Concerns have risen this piece
of legislation would conflict
with existing mine reclamation.
statutes.
And that was a concern as to the
committee supposed to do to
change that
potential conflict.
The question to my experts thank
you.
Chairman McQueen and
representative Scott merry one
Massey for the record
this bill I think does do that
it'll at Ford's the flexibility
and that's one and that the it.
Changes I would say in this bill
what happens is there's an
assessment and then EMNRD and
and then together coordinate and
present a plan to you all after
reviewing and assessing both the
evaluation that's done as well
as the plan going forward and
then determines what to do
and that and that's based on
both the permits state permits
and the federal permits and I
understand that there's going to
be other changes that are
they're coming down the rate
from from the federal government
around specially mine cleanup
and and and Collett of those
will be incorporated
based on the evidence what that
what the evaluation
demonstrates.
And Mr chairman miss Massey is.
True to all this group decision.
Just confused.
There's been some.
That's the truth of it and but
there's others that's what the
point of this bill is just
further deep dive in an
assessment an independent
assessment that's the point of
the bill.
And to present that evidence
before you.
Mr mission ask could you
elaborate in your position
that's been done so for.
And then what this bill will
accomplish in addition to what's
happened there has been
yes I'm sorry excuse me I'm
sorry Mr chairman with green
Representative Scott
Yes there had been continue with
reporting to and made it and and
over the years
what is now common because
there's so many coal closures in
the United States is a re visit
like okay well what's happened
in the last fifty years and
further assessment of that of
that situation.
And so that the combination of
both what they have been
reporting and what the new
assessment demonstrates is how
they're going to proceed forward
that's what that's what the
point of the bill is to protect
public health.
This message just a question is
constituents we looking to
characterize that haven't
already been investigated.
Specifically what is metal
waters contained.
What specifically will we will
we be looking for if this
legislation becomes law.
Mr chair representative of Scott
the purpose of my bill is that.
Through all the years that I've
been a representative I've heard
people from my district of share
with me the results of the
uranium mines that were
abandoned and how it is there
expecting very livelihood to the
state seventy five seventy plus
years later we do not want a
repeat of that.
That is the main reason for my
bill and as far as my
expectation for of the
reclamation is that I was in the
mining industry for thirty seven
and a half years and hi help to
close the plant of my.
We did the full recommendations
that apply to mine is now a
world class reclamation for a
introduced that you'll deal
system of of reclamation and we
have visitors from all over the
world check in to see how we've
done it what what the results
were of our mediation and
reclamation that is what I
expect out of this of the in
working with all the entities to
be the final result we're.
The trees started grow in the
animal started coming back we
even had a lot to go back into
the region and area along with
the deer and the antelope and
the LFC that is our final wish
for this.
Mr chair Mr Chairman
representative at your opinion
that under the existing
regulations.
That we're all one closures.
This effort with respect San
Juan.
The.
I'm sure you will not be would
would not be world class.
We wish for it to be world
class.
The existing regulations that
we're for the.
Well we we attain world class
because of exist some of the
existing regulations yes.
Okay Mr chairman and
Representative for their
constituents.
The solid state flash in
particular.
That for me.
In the feedstocks of the
process.
Thank you can you question I
don't understand what.
Two weeks and he's going to
learning that whole that course
in the whole region.
Mr chair I don't believe so.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Thank you Representative thank
you Representative Garcia.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Yes.
Chennai.
The.
Mr chair
Percent of allicin
I was kind of a genocide by side
of the original bill.
And
on the subject.
And unfortunately I wasn't here
last week.
I have to tend to an emergency.
which is kind of pretty much
we treat these before the last
season kind of sits in.
A larger
but I do notice that.
That this sub doesn't include.
Some rules of staff to.
Pieces of
material.
In the original and I kind of
wanted you Mister chair
representative that just briefly
kind of summarize
What were the reasons that led
to the deletion of these
sections
and the first one Mr chair is on
H. five section five so criminal
actions.
What was kind of briefly what
was the nature of the debate on
that particular point and why
did you remove the.
Mr Chairman representative
Garcia homeowners for the
question to my experts.
Chairman claim representative
Garcia thank you for that
question
really what we were told was
that it already exists.
It the the it's already already
exist and that we it was
superfluous so that's why I
removed it okay thank you for
that the summary also Mr chair
six of them page six section six
of the of the original bill no
longer.
Are not included in this is
unemployment workers and section
seven authorization additional
professionals the system like
need nation restoration it's
always a purpose there.
What what was the points in the
debate and then what was the
reason for the meeting those two
sections.
Mr chair my expertise Mr chair
representative Garcia it's
actually still in there but in a
different way so if you could
look at these at section
three and three C. and it's
actually a page for in the
middle of approximately at page
for line exceed the four through
seven it specifically does
include the cleanup of the
generating and and my right yes
prioritizing for employment
workers who were previously
employed at the plant I see that
Mr chair.
Representative Allison so thank
you for that lastly Mr chair
the new bill section a page
seven the new material under
liability.
Was a reasonable is the issues
of the day and that was a reason
why you eliminated that section.
Or did you read into that that
and just a Mr Mr chair
representative Garcia thank you
for that question
well I think that chairman queen
correctly pointed out that
The law which is that even if
there was a Clint purchaser of
the money the former owners
would still be responsible and
so we do want to remove that
liability for the former owners.
Thank you for that Mr chair
that's all I have.
Thank you Senator see if.
Mr chair
Mr chair and representative
At the.
Bill and was wondering if the
work line.
What is the the fire.
I see it specific to that
generating facility correct.
Mr chair representative Nibert
yes it's defined on page two
inspection to be and it.
that was one of the issues of
the last bill that specifically
the mining association and
raised with us that they one
eight the definition of the
money and also that there to be
an associate.
In one generation generate on to
that money and that's what's in
this bill.
So in all respects whenever the
worst money is used in this
bill.
It is only referring to the law
and associated with this
generating facilities correct Mr
chair representative Nibert yes.
Mr chair representative of.
I appreciate that one hand on
the other hand it leads me to a
concern and and that is.
When we create wall.
So that
supposed to create losses.
Affect the whole state if you
will.
Raise the issue.
Whether or not.
This.
Legislation.
Impassable
it is.
Very specific contracted so as
can only includes one generating
facility at one money.
That's so something for you all
to wrestle with that.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
Representative Townsend
Here thank you thank you.
I was of age.
The point that did you.
That is a lot of money the.
Yes.
Chair representative that being
the case.
All.
What makes this those in the.
Special all.
Your Representative.
Council members for the question
to my experts.
Mr chair and and Representative
Townsend to be perfectly honest
It's about the
Force oversight and enforcement
and the need for a special
independent assessment in the
look lot of money and situation
there was
As as representatives both
so for me have said there there
was Care taken
and we are requesting from you
this body to have that same kind
of care and oversight and
enforcement and actually come
back before the legislature and
report back to you and and have
you all decide and if if if that
if you are satisfied then it
will then nothing else will go
further but if you're not and
the health and welfare are at
stake which we believe there
might be than extra care must
happen and that's what the bill
is about.
Let it no nasty thank you Mr
chair up I.
That's my my issue is we don't
get this legislative body
doesn't get a second chance to
look at.
The
chief State Land Office sure.
Certainly not the Supreme Court
or any other agency.
Quite frankly this cleanup is
not technical.
I don't think this legislative
body has the capacity.
Just say this is good or bad.
I think we have the capacity to
be influenced by an option.
Whether it's good or bad.
But.
Capacity might I'm in to look at
the money clean up and say it's
better not I mean I think
Representative
Perfectly said it Mr chairman
that little part of money was
cleaned up and and they did a
great job well like this move
back.
And.
I have a problem with this whole
process Mr chair representative
by the the money and the
generating plant are still be
run of the day.
I don't think what we did was in
the best interest of New Mexico.
But with that said as my
colleague Mister chair.
Pointed out that our
constitution.
Tells us that the laws that we
create should be for the people.
And to isolate the.
Particularly in to dig.
In a particular County.
In a particular way.
Is going to cause us problems
down the road because I don't
believe it's constitutional I
think it'll be a challenge.
This money and it it is.
It is not at the end PNM is
responsible for this Mr chairman
Representative there on the.
That was part of the deal they
got they put three hundred
million dollars on the the rate
payers in Albuquerque in the
rest of their deal with them and
they're all the clean this place
up to standards.
Can I read that pretty pretty
Pretty thoroughly at one time
and I see.
They are not contracted.
To make sure that your country
is is cleaned up but the other
thing that was that the.
I.
I think we're.
I want the money I won't the
process putting the I want to I
wanted the I don't think the
parents special interest groups.
Come in that are
environmentally leaning.
Want to.
and industry or push on a
process to show their their
their moxie
I don't see Mr chair and
representative.
I don't think that's in the best
interest.
I thank the people of San Juan
that every rights.
And we is the legislature should
strongly supports and and making
sure the money is cleaned up.
I think we have agencies that
have the capacity to the we have
an Attorney General that can
read the the the bills that have
been drafted and Mr chairman.
I I honestly don't believe bring
it back to this legislative body
ends and you think this is good
or not.
Many of which that round here
that have.
real experiencing cleanup
linings.
But we could be influenced by an
emotional playing all this is
better this is good.
I think that the status of.
For the most part will staff Mr
chairman and and I hear all
testimony that you say they have
done a good job historically and
that's my only issue with this
it's not that I don't want the
money to the the it's not that I
don't want.
The people of San Juan protected
I just need to going out and
starting the process of.
Picking a specific person this
this that are specific company
in a specific area drafted
legislation it brings it back to
this body and start come via
it's.
What the state agency has done
well.
I don't I just at the I don't
think you'll be well served I
think you're gonna get caught up
in politics and religion you are
remediation and for that I I
have problems with the but I
wish you well and get the plate
that in the.
Opted to yes thank you thank.
Representatives of right.
Thank you Mr chairman
the little different take than
Representative Townsend
I well I don't have experience
with mine cleanup I do have
experience with Superfund sites
in creating them I see this bill
as a study and I don't know that
Mr chair that the
the applicants have an idea of
everything that's involved in
terms of the the cleanup I think
that's the purpose of this study
is to determine what in fact
has been affected know what
remediation needs to occur and
so I have a little different
take Mr chair I think that
that's.
Why
but there is a process involved
in and I did talk with the
applicant Mr chair earlier about
the south Broadway Superfund
site which I was involved with
And the cleanup that occurred
with General Electric and the
the water contamination
and and the involvement with the
jets so there is the
coordination process and I think
that this is simply a study that
would come back to the
legislature that would kind of
determine what exactly is
involved in a claim if if it
were to occur.
And that's how I see it right
now Mr chair so thank you for
that time and appreciate it.
Thank you Representative
Percent also like to.
Thank you.
We're doing the actual work in
the bill.
I think this is a better bill
but the product.
to the closing comments before
we start the.
For that to my.
Spurs chairman of queen I know
that you raise this and so did
other representatives I just
have one quick thing that I'd
like to share with you all
because I think it's important
it goes to the heart of the one
that some the issues that were
raised by Representative Nibert
and Townsend and I just want to
read to you two lines from this
the New Mexico Supreme Court in
this is a decision made in
twenty twenty two so just last
year around this time.
The constitution does not
exclude special legislation when
a law is required in general
legislation cannot apply.
There is nothing in the
constitution which would
invalidate a legislative act
merely because it is special one
character provided a local
situation exists which under
particular facts make a general
law and applicables and I just
wanted to share that with you so
that you could feel a little bit
more comfortable but I have done
the research on that so thank
you so much Sir.
Okay
thank you just pleasure the
committee Mr chairman thank.
To to pass House Energy
Environment and natural
resources subcommittee to.
So just for clarification not
subcommittee but Canadian
subsidies.
We have a second okay so what.
We're gonna do is we're gonna
we're gonna start the vote for
you see how it's going.
And like we might finish we
might pull that open depending
on how it's going zero one Sir
clear on that.
Okay so.
Whether you want.
thank you.
Representative very go.
Yes.
Representative Dixon.
Representative Garcia yeah.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Nibert our.
Representative Rubio.
Representative Scott.
Representative small.
Representative Townsend.
Okay so we can we're gonna
finish this this without what
what we'll do in the future is.
As the to pause before the chair
Mister health services and I I
do it is my commitment that you
know if we have see someone's
out sick and there's going to be
in New you have a it's gonna be
a type of in front of the room
Representative to the
representatives of the room I
will wait for him to come back
to tie that but I I I mean I
will do the same for all sides
of the aisle that.
Okay.
With disabilities we are you.
Baster Sarnia.
Chairman Greene yes.
Right.
It
five of five three of us and
freezers.
Thank you.
Mr chair in order.
The state that there was a place
up on ninety one as we I don't
have it if you
she the.
This.
Since we do not.
The.
Wind and each of our.
So again I I know this is you
the.
our next bills house bill ninety
one this resources trustee
changes the bill's been
substantially written.
The bill as it is officially
introduced so if you're not into
for online
Look at the revised Committee
substitute for probably
we for discussion just a moment.
Yes it is.
Eight
two is on.
So I noticed that it's I don't
know why there are two tabs
issues to the website there's
committees of want to be sent to
there's only one committees.
so
Four percent ability to pass on
the to the base up for
discussion.
And
Representative center if you
read that to the number of the
committee so.
Two two four five six seven
point four.
So the two two four five six
seven point four if you pull the
bill up online the school go to
into numbers that will number in
the lower left corner.
It is that one person that
members of.
Everyone's on the same page so
we are on the committees
the representative of the
center.
Looking up these present.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
committee
The committee.
Just makes a few changes that
were needed as we went through
the process
and got feedback from like the
attorney general's office and
other.
Departments things that came up
so we wanted to be sure that we
could satisfy the concerns of
everyone before we brought it
before you.
Thank you Mr chair I got started
I got involved with this is over
the summer during the interim
hearings when the natural the
natural resources trustee made
excellent presentations about
what the trustee had done around
the state and as I recall.
Sorry.
Never mind Mr chair I apologize
I launched into the bill.
I launched into the bill.
They about the stuff like co
sponsors at everything that
needs to be said about this up.
So.
Was a little bit on this we
listen to me suffer discussion
do we need to talk to from the
central for we continue or is it
sufficient that were on the
committee legislation.
I.
I believe you present.
Okay.
I think it's supposed to be
adopted.
We usually adopt them before but
I I defer to your prior to the
motion we will do not yes
okay thank you Mr chair well
thirty years ago the New Mexico
legislature passed the natural
resources trustee Act and the
act created the office of
natural resources trustee better
known as and party and empower
the natural resource trustee to
pursue natural resource damages
claims on behalf of the state
under specific federal enabling
laws in under the act natural
resources are defined broadly to
include land fish wildlife I
know that your water ground
water drinking water supplies
and other resources.
in the way this works
is
Excuse me.
I taking medication.
Does that money.
on the in R. T. settlements
compensate communities that have
been adversely affected by
pollution by restoring the
natural resources that are vital
to read recreation farming
tourism health safety cultural
practices and livelihoods and
since its creation the office of
the natural resources trustee
has brought more than forty five
million dollars into New Mexico
and use thank you.
Use that funding to initiate and
or complete more than fifty
restoration projects around the
state in the past three years in
R. T. has settled claims for
more than fourteen million
dollars handling.
Providing funding for
restoration projects along the
Animas and San Juan rivers and
for this soon and Navajo tribes
in on the simmer Cimarron river.
HB ninety one passed.
As the.
The.
Committee substitute will grant
the natural resources trustee
the authority and stand on the
trustee and in R. T. need to
adequately
protect all of New Mexico's
natural resources and this law
makes clear that New Mexico to
hold all of its natural
resources trust and it gives so
in R. T. the authority needed to
ensure their protection and the
restoration.
So with that
All of us.
Thank you the lotus thank you Mr
chair I got involved with this
during the I first got involved
with this during the water
natural resources interim
committees when the denture
research trustee made an
excellent presentation about the
kind of a community restoration
work that it happened around the
state and I'll never forget
Senator Woods asked a question
and said why up why is a state
financial resources trustee not
addressing the P. fast in in the
area near your Clovis in
Carlsbad and the answer was very
simple she did not have to do
that she did not have authority
to work on it and that is really
what got the conversation
started so Senator Woods and I
have have been talking we
continue to talk about this and
in reaching out to the to the
trustee the trustee was open to
expanding the jurisdiction and
so is the attorney general's
office to deal to help
communities I believe very
strongly that polluters must pay
and communities need to be
restored and so this is a bill
that that does that for the
communities in our.
in our beautiful but
environmentally fragile state
and so we stand for questions we
have here a representative from
the attorney general's office
who is here to answer any
questions and actually I'd like
to have him speak and then we
also have members of the office
of natural resources trustee who
are here and available to answer
any questions.
Okay
Sir you might want to use the
word it might.
And as always if you could be.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you Mr chair.
My name is bill grant them I'm
an assistant Attorney General
with the New Mexico attorney
general's office I serve as
counsel to the
This is a resource officer not
resource trustee and
I have had a little bit of input
on the bill and I've also done
some of that.
Analyses of it so I'm just here
to answer any questions you may
have thank you.
And also.
It's.
I'm sorry Mr chair I should also
note that
Our chief of staff John Taylor
who is here and
Sure he wishes to speak to this
but that our office to support
this bill.
If that's sufficient.
Thank.
And we have
maybe Mr Stephens who is with
them.
Director for the and R. T. and
to get cancel keep our.
But I will take it is a given
that the support the.
Yes.

I just want to make the
governor's office.
Mr chairman members of the
committee my name is Maggie Hart
Stebbins I serve as the state's
natural resources trustee I just
wanna make it clear that the

there's not a lot of space and
we have Sanchez there

the left to the right of the
desk.
But I are on you also we're not
doing more than a half hour on
the side.
And so sisters the kids can keep
track of all that to to ring the
changes to.
you can just.
Okay so opposition was picking
up this is.
Please go for just yeah we we
can't do this one and timing for
the line thank you German the
queen and members of the
committee my name is Chris
nicely registered lobbyist for
chevron.
Before my current role I
supported chevron's economic
development efforts with the
village of questa Intel's County
following twenty fourteen mine
closure.
As part of this effort chevron
has worked with the natural
resources trustee and others on
key projects including trout
habitat restoration along the
Red River renewable solar power
generation and municipal well
construction for the village
of questa alarmingly these
projects could not be
jeopardized by HB ninety one
section for the bill
incorporates language from the
so called green amendment which
if passed will expose our quest
to projects to name the lawsuits
section seventy creates a
citizen suit provision which
could be used in the courts
different misli stock or block
important restoration projects
in questa this will create
significant regulatory
uncertainty and potentially
impact local jobs in questa
chevron therefore opposes H. B.
ninety one thank you.
good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee my name is JD
Bullington and I'm speaking to
you today on behalf of the
greater Albuquerque chamber of
commerce which opposes this
legislation because it
represents unnecessary expansion
of the role of the natural
resources trustee other state
agencies can and do serve as
regulators to enforce various
environmental statutes the
greater Albuquerque chamber of
commerce believes this bill is
duplicative and would result in
more litigation and regulation
creating less certainty and
predictability for industry
across the state thank you.
Mr chair members of the
committee my name is Jim
Winchester with independent
petroleum association of New
Mexico we do stand in respectful
opposition due to the depleted
nature of the authorities that
would be granted to the natural
resource trustee there are rules
on record right now both within
the environment department as
well as the energy minerals
natural resources department
that handle of these issues is
specifically in terms of
compliance so for those reasons
and several others we do stand
in a respectful opposition thank
you.
Good morning chairman the queen
committee members Carlos Mr with
Public Service Company New
Mexico PNM opposes house bill
ninety one this you know could
affect or effect you know the
the number of remaining
remediation projects that are
underway New Mexico also the
uncertainty of these additional
regulations and restrictions
could impact the pro the
renewable energy projects so we
see in the state such as wind
and solar so for these reasons
we oppose house bill ninety one
thank you.
Good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee my name is Tony
Trujillo of the register Lopez
for a three four but more.
TriplePoint opposes this
legislation for the same reasons
as already been stated by many
ahead of me.
We also have a specific reason
to oppose this legislation which
could under by Pat settlements
of guttural resource damage
claims Freeport McMoRan
participated in a cooperative
assessment of natural resource
damages claims concerning this
mines in southwestern Mexico
which were conducted over a
period of several years of which
has concluded which concluded in
a settlement over ten years ago.
This bill establishes new
natural resource claims under
state law.
And it is possible that the
state but argue that this
legislation is grounds for re
opening the so it's for now it
is very important D. spent to
accompany to gauge and some of
process legislation that could
undermine the finality of Paso
little budget will not encourage
companies to participate in
cooperative settlement process
for that reason was that
propose.
Good morning Mr chairman members
the committee Mike Miller
Permian basin petroleum
association most of our
opposition reasons have already
been stated I would like to
stress something maybe Mr
Trujillo pointed out just now
that we feel that this could
this legislation could creates a
certain if you will double
jeopardy exposure for those and
other reasons we oppose thank
you.
Chairman members of the
committee Jason Espinoza on
behalf The New Mexico coalition
and conservation districts as
well as New Mexico idea the
statewide professional economic
development professional
association of both
organizations stand in
opposition to the legislation
really I from the economic
development side the duplication
in the on certainty that's
created with this legislation
really does incentivizes
investment in terms of
relocation and business
expansion in the state we have a
lot of activity going down
especially in southern New
Mexico with our border
communities we're really feel
that this uncertainty could
impact the economic development
initiatives going thank you.
Thank you Mr chair.
Members of the committee Jason
Weaks speaking in opposition.
it's on switch sorry Mr chair
representative images weeks
begin opposition this bill for
the Albuquerque Hispanic chamber
of commerce we think that this
is even going to because
negative impacts to responsible
economic development you have to
walk a line you have to be open
for development in the state in
New Mexico you got to do we can
try to attract businesses that
are going to grow our economy
help diversify our economy we
think this will do the opposite
it also does from a technical
standpoint point from our
perspective cause some concern
it leaves the decision for the
students in the hand of hands of
one administrative official we
understand that you know what
the intent is but respectfully
stand opposition feel that this
opens the door could lead to
really negative consequences in
terms of attracting new business
in New Mexico and facilitating
growth internally with the New
Mexico business.
Good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee it was my what
The New Mexico rural electric
cooperative association and for
reasons already stated we
oppose this legislation and the
potential that it could have in
rural areas that are
economically challenged we
oppose this legislation thank
you.
Good morning Mr chairman of
Vince Martinez of tri state
generation and transmission
association we respectfully
recoup our stand in opposition
of house bill ninety one
although tristate enjoys an
impeccable reputation for
environmental compliance we
believe this bill could stifle
business expansion into Turner
businesses for Committee New
Mexico thank you.
Hi my name is Chelsea Canada and
I'm the director of public
policy at the New Mexico chamber
of commerce we respectfully
oppose H. B. ninety one we
believe this bill is not needed
because this is duplicative to
current state law and the
trustee already has the ability
Interstate Lara teen awards for
damages to the natural resources
of the state this legislation
creates uncertainty which will
stifle economic development this
would work counter intuitive to
the efforts to diversify our
economy for example this would
affect industry essential to the
energy transition act like
they're renewable energy sector
we respectfully oppose this
legislation thank you.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee my name is Mike my
Estes and I'm the director of
governmental affairs firm that I
rise in opposition to house bill
ninety one the legislation
grants new with already to the
natural resource trustee
Authority that largely exist
under state law we think that
the legislation would create
uncertainty for businesses in
New Mexico by creating
additional regulatory framework
for these reasons we oppose has
been the one thank you.
Chairman committee members my
name is Raj according with the
New Mexico cattle growers we are
standing in opposition to this
bill as well for many of the
reasons that worry been stated
one of the things that also was
going to directly affect us is
on the water quality side of
things we we already have a lot
of industries that rely upon
lagoons and this is being pulled
into that as well the the reason
for the lagoons is to stop any
of the.
Overflow from pushing these
things into the contaminants
into the water sources and that
this is going to directly affect
that as well along with the
duplicity of of the agency so
with that we stand in opposition
to this bill as well thank you.
Okay we're gonna go online do
opposition.
First I will come back to reduce
for.
so if you'd like to speak in
opposition please raise your
hand if you would like to speak
in support.
so the first person to take its
Carla Sonntag's.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee I'm car less on
tech with the New Mexico
business coalition we are
respectfully oppose house bill
ninety one.
New Mexico has already strong
environmental laws that protect
human life and the environment.
But this bill is creating a new
enforcement agency.
Which also under this creates a
private right of action which
will up in any sense of
regulatory structure or
certainty in New Mexico this is
going to make it even harder to
recruit and retain retain
businesses to grow and diversify
the state economy.
It's broadly drafted best
significant authority in one
person and for all of these
reasons we think this is going
to be even more of a deterrent
to business and we would
encourage you not to do this
we're trying to attract business
to the state not detract from
what we already are offering so
we urge you to say no thank you.
Thank you the the.
The Rivera.
Good morning Mr chairman and
members of the committee to
you're very registered lobbyists
for New Mexico farm and
livestock bureau today stand and
respectful opposition to house
bill ninety one we appreciate
the Sanchez work on the bill
however we are concerned how the
extension of the authority to
the natural resource trustee may
affect our state's agricultural
producers specifically we're
concerned with the lack of
action in the bill for producers
when it comes to P. fost we're
also curious about the provision
in the bill which allows office
to replace or acquire natural
resources where will the
resources be acquired from and
how will monetary value baseline
to these resources lastly we're
concerned with the overall
increase potential for
litigation that could come from
this bill in addition this
morning I've been asked to
report respectful opposition on
behalf of elephant Butte
irrigation district as their
lobbyist is hopping on a flight
now so with that thank you for
the opportunity and we stand and
respectful opposition.
Thank you that's that there
really is.
The.
Great thank you Mr chairman
members committee will look into
it seconded director of dairy
producers of New Mexico we
respectively send in opposition
to this bill due to unintended
consequences the P. five matter
as mentioned in eastern New
Mexico could potentially affect
those producers that were
negatively impacted by it those
are the unintended consequences
I'm speaking up it could harm
them even though this
contamination was through no
fault of their own and for this
reason and the others mentioned
we respectfully oppose hate
house bill ninety one thank you.
thank you Michael the interview.
Morning Gerry McQueen members
committee Mike Antonio with Xcel
energy we do business in New
Mexico at southwestern public
service company server provided
that a hundred forty thousand
customers on the eastern side of
the state we do respectfully
close this legislation grams of
economic development and
attachments.
We believe that the existing law
already exists to handle this is
kind of a perceived piling on
businesses and because we serve
apple sites in the state of New
Texas New Mexico we since we see
laws like this actually driving
businesses to Texas and so we
and we we don't get capital
investment will get the jobs in
New Mexico so for those reasons
we we oppose thank you.
Right on the.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Frank Underwood in New Mexico
building trades council up with
all due respect to the sponsors
of this legislation and the
comments that were cited by
other entities opposing this
bill or we stand in opposition
to house bill ninety one thank
you.
Thank you I think that does it
for the opposition certainly
come back to the room but if
you'd like to speak in support
of the.
We'll start on my left this.
So that that might so if you
want to speak in support of that
my
first
begin to make money you need to
use.
Good morning this sure I think
you need to turn on.
You.
Good morning Mr chairman this by
of the madam vice chair my name
is Jane E. on I'm and then and
our mental justice activist and
retired government regulatory
attorney and all I'm here to
speak in support of this bill
from an attorney's perspective
these amendments are needed
because they update the intent
and of of litigating a case the
intent of the legislature is
primary is very important to
update that intent it also
pins liability on owners and
prior owners and on intentional
and unintentional emissions
those are important from the
community's perspective this
bill is important because it
lays the foundation for
meaningful consultation with the
communities that lays the
foundation for the communities
to work with government agencies
and other aptitudes to make sure
that corporations are
accountable.
Accountable for all of the harm
that they have done to our
communities for all the profits
the super profits that they have
made at the expense of our
communities when will we be
repaid
this bill is a step in that
direction thank you.
Good morning Mr chair and
representative this is Marilyn
messing and with new energy
economy and we are in stand in
support of this bill and thank
the sponsors for bringing it
thank you.
X..
Good morning Mr chair members of
the committee good to see you
all again my name is Charles to
sail and and although I am a
registered lobbyist I and here
speaking on this bill as a
private but I never the less
knowledgeable individual thirty
years ago I came to New Mexico
to work for the New Mexico
attorney general's office and my
primary responsibility at the at
the office was representing the
natural resources tristate so
I'm quite familiar with how it
works I support this bill I've
reviewed the bill and the the
substitute and there are a few
key points that I want to make
about this bill that I think are
are worthwhile provisions
first of all it allows The New
Mexico trustee and natural
resources trustee to bring an
action under state law so the
trustee's office does not need
to rely exclusively on federal
law which is the case right now
second of all it allows the
trustee to attain damages for
per and poly fluorinated alkyl
substances otherwise known as P.
fights which under current law
the the the trustee does not
have the authority to address
so for those reasons and and
many others that I won't go into
in the time that I have I
support house bill ninety one
thank you very much.
Good morning Mr chair members of
the committee my name is Douglas
Michael Chen registered lobbyist
for conservation voters New
Mexico for the reasons that have
already been stated by the
sponsors and other speakers
particularly Mr disabling who
has experience representing the
office of natural resources
trust the conservation voters
urges you to support this bill
and to give it a do pass
recommendation thank you.
Certainly go like you be sure to
off.
Yeah.
So we did some people up there
needs of online this is for
support
so if you're in support first up
to million if you don't mind.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the for both the opportunity to
speak and to do it remotely with
the little kids on a Saturday
morning I represent the Rio
Grande chapter of the Sierra
Club and R. thirty five thousand
members and supporters we stand
in support of the bill which
amends the natural resource
trustee Act it would allow the
trustee to join civil actions
pursuant the water quality act
their quality act the hazardous
waste act in addition to the act
under which the trustee always
already has that power it would
allow for adoption of rules for
the assessment and collection of
fines related to the release of
pollutants that are already
covered by New Mexico
environmental laws in addition
to the federal laws.
And authorizes the trustee to
bring suit for damages caused by
the release of an injurious
substance this bill also fills
gaps in our state and federal
environmental protection
statutes to address damages
resulting from the contamination
of our precious groundwater
resources for all these reasons
we stand and support thank you.
I think that this Lucas for the.
Yes thank you Mr chair thank you
to the committee and thank you
to the Sanchez for bringing this
bill my name is Lucas Herndon I
am a registered lobbyist with
progress now New Mexico but as
stated by Mister to sail and I
am coming you to you today as a.
Private citizen who is
knowledgeable on the subject
because one of the things it's
clear to me is.
There are plenty of advocates in
the state that represent the
various industries we've heard
from them this morning
they have all of the power and
money to to be in Santa Fe and
to lobby on behalf of their
industry which is their right
and having somebody in the
office the the like the trustee
they represent me and represent
the rest of us here in the
public and I can't think of
something more important than
having that kind of authority in
the state and making sure that
it that authorities expanded to
Representative new things that
we didn't clearly have written
in the law before so again I
fully and strongly support this
bill and thank the sponsors are
bringing it forward and did you
pass thank you.
Thank you so if you live at.
Good morning chairman clean and
members of the committee then it
is a feeling about I'm a member
leader with use United for
climate crisis action or yep yep
has members and supporters
throughout northern and central
New Mexico we are strong
supporters of HB ninety one
because we believe it's critical
that communities and the
democratically elected
governments that represent us
have the ability to hold
polluters accountable in New
Mexico we know the environmental
racism has led for indigenous
and low income communities of
color very disproportionate
burdens when it comes to the
pollution and contamination
caused by extractive industries
and dirty energy some of our
members have been directly
harmed by living in areas where
industry seems to call the shots
and regular seem to be blind to
the real and present danger
posed by polluters this law on
her community members to sound
the alarm and demand government
action as we face daily spills
infants flaring accidents and a
public health crisis that is
exacerbated for frontline
communities speaking toxic air
and contaminated water this is
an important step to right these
wrongs and increase
accountability and action.
Thank you to the sponsors for
bringing this bill and the
members of the communities for
listening to our voices we ask
you to support H. B. ninety one
thank you.
Thank you Mr we have jasmine.
Good morning queen in the
members of the committee my name
is this I'm speaking on behalf
of earth care and environmental
justice organization based on
the south side Santa Fe on youth
and families of thousands of
organization based on members
and supporters we Sierra support
H. Payne anyone because we
believe that our communities are
clean air clean water and clean
land and the we know that we
have the right to see some
firemen and the opportunity for
healthy fulfilling life those
words are not you realize
interstate and we need the laws
of enforcement accountability
that four this protect ourselves
on the south side of sanity were
are were organizations based or
my family this is what my family
has always lived we see a
concentration of polluting
industries and it's no
coincidence that this is also
our low income and communities
of condiments environmental
racism is a reality and then on
for community initiatives should
not be allowed to the timing of
that should not be left to the
committee our water and without
recourse and this bill would
require government with an
important tool to prevent
further harm Representative our
health and environment thank you
for supporting H. being
anywhere.
Thank you.
That we have barbecue of.
Good morning chairman claim
committee members I'm Barbara
Calif speaking for the league of
women voters of New Mexico the
legal eight that government
should promote and ensure
responsible stewardship of our
natural human and cultural
resources particularly in the
face to face and grow growth and
development we support of HB
ninety one thank you.
Thank you that's that same five
or.
Thank you Mr.
Or it is ninety one I occurred
very muffled.
The technical difficulty of this
element in our comments in.
So perhaps you could just the.
We we can't hear you so sorry
about that remove on the next up
the list the can the guy or.
Thank you chairman Green members
of the committee and the LESC
any other resident of Santa Fe a
member of the Sierra Club Rio
Grande chapter with thirty five
thousand people and also a board
member and CEO national caucus
of environmental legislators
which does not endorse any kinds
of bills but provides great
resources to legislators across
the country I am in support of
this bill because I believe that
the trustees office should have
the power to pursue fees against
polluters in every form in our
state especially in the area
DFA's and this bill would allow
that authority thank you.
Thank you
that brings us to the end of the
public displays with the
sponsors like to address
anything before positivity yes
Mr chair
We're sorry did there wasn't
access for the committee
substitute to the public because
a lot of the comments were not
true
and.
Yes if they were based on the
old bill
and we're
Do not this bill does not create
a private right of action that
does not duplicate and it does
not regulate anything
because Spencer
thank you Mr chair we would like
to ask the office of natural
resource trustees and we would
like to ask the attorney
general's office because
unfortunately a lot of the
comments were based on as as my
coach co sponsors that earlier
versions of the bill or just out
and out misinterpretations and
not a correct analysis of the
bill so with that I'd like to
yield if if with your permission
to miss Mr of the of the office
of natural resources trustee.
Yes.
Thank you.
Sanchez thank you Mr chairman.
I share my name's cage right on
the executive director of the
office of natural resources
trustee I'm also a licensed
practicing attorney and with
that principle we constitutional
rights I in response to I I
believe I capture most of the
comments and I and I hope I can
respond
fifty two that in terms of this
being duplicitous indeed there
is often times confusion between
what all our T. does this is
what our sister agencies NMED
and EMNRD do we do not to the
regulatory remediation of
cleanups what the opportunity is
risky as the authority to do and
has for thirty years at the
authority to do is to pursue
natural resource damage claims
when there is a release of a
federally regulated substance
those federal laws which are are
neatly Law Center slated to
under current state trustee Act
impose some limitations which
are detrimental to the state for
example I there was a the one of
the comments was from a prior.
Harding which will act to
successfully settled just posted
Act double jeopardy cannot apply
there will be no pre opening of
settlements there's that's just
not possible this is the only
about the ability to expand
certain things which includes
right now I'm a trustee cannot
pursue damages when oil and gas
fall into anything other than
waters of the United States.
Is there point eight all of our
water in all the service for
which the service course in New
Mexico.
It also excludes for example P.
fuss as as noted we do we know
that there is land is been
condemned contaminated by PFOS
buyer by the specifically in
Clovis here is not just Clovis
but that is the one that is no
these because of our for states
to natural resources upon which
those cattle and that rancher
allies we do not have a remedy
for that and this would provide
that remedy it is actually very
difficult question to figure out
how do we restore that and how
do we replace it if we need to
but without the authority to
figure that out.
Be able to figure that out there
is a very complex federal
regulatory process that we must
follow and I I that allows us to
work cooperatively with all of
the state parties to determine
those things I think there's
also unfortunately in the
the current Chasey is done an
amazing job in making our office
more ways to Mexico but this is
for thirty years and we thank
you for that comment and we do
doing this work for three years
this is not a vast expansion is
not well we're doing anything
this is really just to allow us
to do in the state law that was
federal law does not allow.
Then I don't know if my.
My council.
The we have some additional
states.
Mr chair members of the
committee at I would defer to
the offices responses to the
public comment and less of it
you are members of the committee
have specific questions.
Representative center are you
ready to go to.
Yes we are thank you for that we
just placed here sorry.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
for.
I said on that hazardous waste
interim committee and we've
heard about all of the hazardous
waste of their it can be really
we work are completed because of
the limitations.
Now this gives you the.
The state of the measure
resources
the last just two to three cases
and.
The state law and we look at
what's out there we have Los
Alamos we came home and we have
gas royalty king
Zero to methane and they will
stick into the ground what we
have
you radiant from hope to happen.
To.
We have the jet fuel we can
Albuquerque we have
our we have
Thanks for being former Air
Force cannon and we need to
clean those up and we need to do
a better job of federal
government is allowing us to do
I need to bring to the state lab
where they can actually enforce
do the things that need to be
done.
There's just so much out there
in during through the committee
we were an eighty in Roswell I
believe
Representatives and senators and
rivers and woods Representative
Chatfield asked why the state
can't do with their constituents
well this will help their
constituents I believe it will
allow the state to do that
Question.
What would house bill ninety one
to to address PFAS contamination
like focus around the state and
like to be specific.
Thank you I I will defer to the
trustee but I think that that
very issue is why we got
involved with that with pushing
this bill and that working with
the trustees office too
Representative to expand their
authority.
This chart.
Thank you senator.
I'm chairman where and vice
chair and members of the
committee up.
The very specific example is can
yeah one of the things are a lot
of the federal law that our
state law is near to the federal
law so that this is not
something that is new we just
need to bring to the state level
like you said I appreciate
comments about bringing this the
state level so we can protect
our State Land our state natural
resources up one of the the
limitations imposed by this news
committee substitute is that
from the moment if it's passed
and more from the blue it is
signed.
The trustee will have five years
to pursue natural resource
damage claims against when she
has the authority to do so for
example for P. fuss which would
give us five years to assess and
determine and bring suit for the
the any any P. five
contamination or any other that
we we you know we need to bring
against for surface waters for
example for oil spills that have
occurred within our ground and
surface waters
but can it is a specific example
that we have been looking at we
know we follow closely what is
the work the really great work
of NMED and and and and right in
their efforts to two regulate P.
foss with the our forces my
council over here who is also
involved in that can say it's
been very difficult and this is
we hope would be an additional
self step to make sure that New
Mexico receives
The remedy it is entitled to
thank you.
Tension will affect someone who
purchases property that is being
contaminated in the past but not
disclosed or discovered prior.
Thank you Sanchez thank you Mr
chairman and madam vice chair no
it will not there is actually we
have limited liability to
include sovereign immunity for
all state and local public
agencies also for publicly
traded water treatment
facilities sovereign nations and
tribes of public of course and
also for innocent landowners and
so the now your thank you for
raising the question I
appreciate it.
Again thank you for reading this

Mr chairman and members of the
committee my expert witnesses
since the late Stuart thank you
Mr chairman house bill ninety
five minutes the State Land
Office create and maintain a
renewable energy office to
advance the production and
development of renewable energy
the bill also modernizes archaic
language in the statute on the
duties of the office
a lot is not been updated since
nineteen twelve with that I will
defer to my expert witness Mr
chairman members of the
committee this is a fairly
straightforward bill but it's
very meaningful hi it basically
just updates the duties of land
commissioner to ensure that
renewable energy is part of that
mandate
that we created in the office
the commissioner of public the
public lands in office in twenty
nineteen it's being operated and
maintained and has had
tremendous success and we want
to maintain
you know looking around the room
in terms of the counties.
The members on this committee we
have a project in every single
members County with the
exception of the chairman
colleges Mr Chairman will work
on that but these are statewide
impacted here generate a lot of
revenue for the State Land
Office I it does not affect in
any way or other streams of
revenue hi and it's something
that we think is will be
beneficial in the long term.
With that.
To answer any questions you may
have.
Committees.
The.
This is like speaking
opposition.
Is there anyone online.
Opposition to the reason.
Is there anyone in the audience.
Every come up I thought that.
For one hundred.
if you could the.
I don't think we have a few
weeks time you would please be.
Good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee my name is
Marco Gonzales on the Richard
this for pattern energy and
energy grid United plus power
and a few others we understand
very much in support of this
bill today we appreciate the
sponsor for creative forward and
look forward to the committees
support thank you Mr chairman
and members of the committee.
Good morning Mr chair and this
Madam vice chair sorry on.
And the committee members my
name is Jane E. and I am an
environmental justice activist
and retired of government
regulatory attorney I am
speaking in support of this bill
house bill ninety.
Ninety five.
because of
For two reasons from a
government perspective from the
a former government workers
perspective is important the
government agencies are.
Efficient and effective from
what they do and are focused in
their mission and this
of this bill will we'll have
that and from a communities
activists from the community
activists point of view of this
bill will help the community
have meaningful consultation
because the if the agency will
be more efficient and effective
and I want to thank you for that
corporations and industries are
very interested in economic
development and I'm here to say
that the important thing is
economic development of benefits
everyone in our communities not
just corporations and it's very
important for government
agencies to be efficient to make
sure that happens and of course
with community activists to
stand up and speak out when
necessary to push of for that of
comical thank you.
Good morning Mr chair members of
the committee share our you to
turn the Mike.
Good morning Mr chair members of
the committee registered
lobbyists and PNM I'm sure grown
our we stand in support of the
bill A. as we move our state
toward clean sustainable energy
future
this is the right path to go to
support this thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr chairman members the
committee talked with Freeport
continue to maintain that
renewable energy efforts in New
Mexico what up without the use
of copper so this is certainly a
effort that we what is supported
and so we see
need to support this.
Okay we do have some some people
online first up is Camilla
people in.
Good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee and Camilla I
amend with the Rio Grande
chapter of the Sierra Club we
strongly support making the
renewable energy office
permanent at the State Land
Office thanks to the existing
the existence of this office and
the leadership of commissioner
Garcia Richard over the last
four years the agency has
increased renewable energy
revenue by fourteen hundred
percent more than tripled the
number of active leases and
grown the megawatts under lease
by about two hundred and fifty
percent these leases will amount
to hundreds of millions of
dollars of income to the state
land maintenance fund and their
associated inefficiencies this
bill makes permanent this very
wise diversification of the
economy and we thank you for
your support.
Thank you next up is the field
level.
Hello again chairman McQueen and
members of the committee again
my name is available with yucca
you see noted for climate crisis
action I'm seventeen years old
and like other young people
coming into adulthood and
fishing and uncertain future I'm
deeply concerned about climate
change yes this is a strong
supporter of the Trinity I
because beginning the work of
transitioning our economy and
energy system away from fossil
fuels to renewables the only
chances got the global
scientific community tells us
that in order to give humanity
if fifty percent chance of
keeping global temperature rises
below one point five degrees
Celsius no no fossil fuel
infrastructure can be approved
and all existing infrastructure
must be phased out by twenty
three four transition is no
small task place of also feel
inner structure we need to begin
investing in large scale of the
project ology of renewables our
public lands can help facilitate
this transition we applaud the
current land commissioner for
commitment to adjust transition
creating the renewable energy
office just succeeded in
tripling the number of renewable
energy leases on public lands
and increase revenue for new
renewables but more than one
thousand percent we want to see
this work continued regardless
if we would who is running State
Land Office solar and wind are
proven technologies investment
is resources is in the public
interest and critical at this
time I believe in innovation New
Mexico and as a resident this
office would be super comforting
to me thank you for supporting
HB ninety five.
Thank you the next step we have
sent cap.
So I think the yes right.
Thank you chairman of the
committee my name is Danny
County Climent Energy advocate
with conservation voters Mexico
it's for reasons already
mentioned we are also in strong
support of this bill thank you.
Thank you next up Gen the heard
and.
Needed okay I think I'm good up
good morning Mr chairman miss
madam vice chairman members of
the committee my name is Jim
days ago and I represent
renewable energy industry
association of New Mexico we
have about sixty diverse members
have been around since two
thousand and four the state
lands commission renewable
energy offices been instrumental
in the development of large wind
and solar projects and also
community solar projects in New
Mexico.
The sense of these projects has
brought new revenue to the state
and local communities making
this a permanent office will
help to ensure that this could
work continues we strongly
support this bill thank you very
much.
Thank you for that September
conduct.
If we lose that right.
With the jazz.
It I'm sorry as if they were
just in our L..
Hello again chairman and members
of the committee my name is yes
ma'am and I the silver screen
right now and again you know
behalf of repair Environment
just certainly ciation be some
subset of Santa Fe New Mexico is
a C. with more than three
hundred days of sunshine and
right now only six point four of
all of our electricity is
generated by solar and meanwhile
we're facing catastrophic
climate disruption fueled in
part by and then just outside
contribution to global carbon
emissions and we all experienced
the devastating fires of this
last year we have family members
who were displeased lost their
homes lost their livelihoods and
I'm sure that we're also
grieving the loss of our forests
but we watch helplessly as he
drugs and deepening and
lengthening but we're not
helpless and we can't accept any
function to reduce our emissions
if we invest now improving
renewable technologies in this
now in transition the creation
of the renewable energy office
we have seen this transition you
get Interstate transplants and
we bought this effort so please
continue it by voting yes on HB
ninety five thank you.
Thank you that's that was
Charles good doctor.
Mr Mr chairman members of the
committee thank you for this
opportunity that's Charles good
markers we in behalf of natural
resources defense council
constructs for this bill for so
many reasons previously spoken
the plot the sponsor and the
state land office for their
excellent work thank you.
Thank you next up.
Is Mike d'antoni.
Good morning chairman members of
the committee my Cantoni with
Xcel energy we support this.
Legislation.
Really to continue the good work
that that renewable the that
offices are you with regards to
the new levels excel we are
leaders in renewable energy over
forty percent or approximately
forty percent of our generation
comes from renewables in New
Mexico so we are very supportive
of this type of legislation
thank you.
Next up is barbecue of.
Good morning chairman and
members of the committee I'm
Barbara Calif speaking for the
league of women voters of New
Mexico the league supports
policies that will reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by
developing clean renewable
energy sources the creation of a
renewable energy office will
confirm the significance of
renewable energy for the New
Mexico economy and ensure that
future on state land
commissioners will continue the
good work of our current
commissioner to do the the and
developing renewable energy
sources on state trust lands
please support the bill thank
you.
Thank you next up is different
conduct.
Senator you're muted on your
and.
If ever you still needed we're
gonna go the right time.
Mr chair members of the
committee this is Deborah Condit
acts.
I'm sorry I don't know why I was
having issues with my computer
number Condit with Interwest
Energy Alliance weird trade
association that represents wind
solar transmission and storage
and we work in six western
states we stand in strong
support of this bill we and
appreciate the commissioner
she's taught since day one about
codifying renewable energy
options we've been at the
statement Commission and we've
always appreciated her
willingness to work with us in
our members on I was on energy
at bringing renewable energy
industry to the state so we
stand strong support pay thank
you.
Thank you so I I think we're
done is I think it's different
right.
so R. Sanchez fact.
Features stories presented bill
heard public testimony as or
anything like that.
Mr chair and committee members I
just want to thank you for
putting of listening to the bill
and to my co sponsor
Representative Sarinana for
putting the bill on this is an
important bill that we need to
codify into law and is I'm sure
mention it exemplifies all the
efforts of our land commission
and the production and economic
development that this this
office is already performing and
adding to our state so I just
ask for that you're you're
voting and the committee members
vote on this bill thank you Mr
chair the.
Sure that might cost you
probably don't need to use it is
here to make money if you can
try the one on the officers.
Thank you.
members of the committee
representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr chair.
You know I hate it when I.
That appeared ask questions when
all my friends speak in favor of
sulfate with this bill falls
into the same category the three
bills that we heard yesterday
into the issue and follow up to
and I think this bill needs some
more work and not sure what.
Mr.
Chair.
Probably Representative mosque
by questions of probably before
we madam speaker if you don't
mind.
Like you look at page two.
And if you would read the
sentence beginning online form.
Through the end of that sentence
and then tell me what that says
here works.
Mr Chairman representative I'm
sorry the the beginning of page
two line one starting the other
instruments always is H. two one
on sure absolutely and in Mr
chairman of the.
Representative just projects.
There is stylistic changes that
were made by eight council but
the only substantive provision
is on page three but I'll go
ahead and share and Mr Stewart
you said this was you lot of the
changes were to clean it up and
I'll point out what was.
Mr Chairman representative all
leases deeds contracts and
grants executed shall be
entitled to
record without acknowledgement
in record of the education in
the county in which the land
described education is situated
shop.
Described in the education is
situated show.
Be constructive notice to all
persons of the concerns there of
this Mr Chairman representative
of this language was drafted in
the twenties
and it is I think we could do an
entire re write honestly that
would be we didn't try to do
entirely right we try to keep it
focused but I would agree there
is some language that is.
Modernizing Mister chair Mister
street you would agree you.
Reporter we cleaned up the
center.
Mr Chairman representative these
were let's councils
that were put for that they
thought would make it.
With greater clarity okay
Mister chair Mister we can point
fingers but basically there was
some effort made to clean up the
language this specific set of.
Mr Chairman representative yes.
Technical teams so.
Mr Mr chair and Mr Stewart the
state land office ever recorded
Mimi instrument in the county
records Mr Chairman
representative yes so we are the
the record holder of all State
Land Office
instruments but it is very
common especially in the
renewable energy context that
folks will essentially put a
memo on here and different
instruments of the lease in the
county and that's important but
folks on notice and and a lot of
companies do that routinely.
Mister chair Mister chair lost
my questions and those of State
Land Office record any
instruments in the characters Mr
Chairman representative we
generally do not it's usually
are legacies that would do that.
Yeah would you agree that this
particular provision cost
opportunities of the committee.
Mr Chairman representative that
is the Act heading in a session
with the overall duties of the
land commission.
Mr chair Mr Stewart
I was very aware of the office
and it's very leases right away
and other documents often times
the.
What's the.
Permit the whatever will
reportedly County records but
not required Mr chair you Mr
Stewart is a.
Mr Chairman representative it's
it's not required so so Mister
chairman Mr Stewart I I would
suggest that you claim this
paragraph because number one I
think I think what this is
trying to say is of the leases
can be executed what Mr measure
that need the knowledge there's
its signature.
And that.
I would even take out the
portable recording rig count
because you have other statutes
that say your records provide
constructive notice to the.
So last four that sentences is
is not a necessary
because you have another statute
elsewhere that provide for
constructive notice of State
Land Office records so I would
encourage you to claim that soon
set up so that people understand
it today what the duties of the
committee that is to execute the
instruments and get them.
According to your records up to
the counter records in the state
can be recorded without
knowledge then you do need that
for is generally very very
to report instruments.
Overall page three.
This is the gaps of the.
The bill.
We're establishing a new office.
Mr chair you Mr Stewart.
This certain office.
In statute for.
Raising concern office for
minerals is there an office for
rights of way.
The statutes Mr Chairman
representative no we do not have
all of our offices listed Act we
do have in this if you look at
page four for example talk about
a mandate to employ a petroleum
engineer and you know there's
reference in here.
With regard to the scene of
lands gaunt lands belonging to
the state and gas purposes so
there there are other areas Mr
Chairman representative you know
this was drafted at a very
different time
and you know like I said there
were different approaches we
could have re written this
entire.
And and had a modernized overall
we did try to just take a more
defined and direct approach with
regard to renewable energies to
to add that to mandate
but there are references to oil
and gas and but it does the
offices.
Mr chairman Mr Stewart.
This falls under the duties of
the commissioner this whole
section.
At least requiring the statue
correctly
So.
Wondering whether the placement
of this office.
Is.
It seems like.
Further on in the statute
there's a lot of discussion
about
how we scissors uses a lot of
discussion right of course right
after you have other sections of
the statute that are dedicated
to those.
Renewable energy seems to be
more can to those things them to
the specific duties of the
commissioner yeah and so it
seems to be.
State would want to to reflect.
Is a disease of the commissioner
if you want to establish his
office I don't have a it
junction overstaffed with
minimal office that's what you
want.
But the placement of it seems
really ought to.
And it could be further down
into sub section like you have
the we've seen you have the
grazing you have the number you
have other things that are done
by your office
those things are under the
duties of the land commissioner
thank you Mr pretty prescribed
to use so I just encourage you
to look at this think there's a
better way to handle it you
probably give you all for the
supporters she cleaned up that
first part with the the office
of body cells I I can't support
going forward with something
that that makes sense chapter
paragraph and trying.
Metal this.
Under the duties of the
commissioner so I just think
that promise to you.
Certainly like to see you guys
changes were impacted.
It's going.
Well it's not going anywhere but
to the floor passes the
ready so I don't know what.
Hi I would like to see cleaned
up Mr chair thank.
Thank you Representative numbers
other members of the committee.
That's that's got.
Thank you Mr chairman if you
really wanted to see Mr.
The prime directive.
Mr Chairman representative at
the.
By the enabling act and you know
the did a great meant that we
had with the federal government
and enquiring minds is to
generate revenue for our
beneficiaries twenty one of them
primarily public education so
you know I often say to make
money for the school kids.
Mr chairman Mr which.
All of you the statement also.
Is this piece of legislation.
The prime directive or does
Madam chair representative it
does not and the language in the
duties of land commissioner you
know with regard to managing
controlling except for none of
that has changed it maintains
broad discretion it's not
micromanaging future land
commissioners and and how they
would carry out those
responsibilities and it
complements it greatly you know
we're looking at just from the
pattern energy projects three
hundred sixty million dollars we
are going to be seeing hundreds
and hundreds of millions of
dollars in additional revenue
we're not taking away from other
areas where the land
commissioner can do leasing and
we think that that revenue
generation it's added benefit
that it is clean energy from our
perspective but it is about
making money and we can make a
lot of money doing renewable
energy projects serving the
school can to New Mexico.
Mr Chairman had
The last four years the agency
has increased renewable energy
revenue by fourteen hundred
percent.
And the more than triple the
number of the act leases and
grounded you what made you want
to do the least by about two
hundred fifty percent so.
To your question.
This this this office now
through their programs is doing
what they say they are meant to
do.
Mr Chairman representative Mr
Stewart I don't see.
In this section not sure.
My colleagues concern.
In this section.
Officers found which.
Lance.
Reduction willing it's.
I don't see.
In office to strap which.
It just raising opportunities
for us wanting to.
This.
To.
You Mr chairman Mr Stewart.
And one of the.
Lance's.
Revenues will.
We brought.
The office.
The actors.
The this revenues still.
The small greens Mr chair
Representative yes I would say
yes and I comparison of those
numbers but what it does is it
gives the opportunity for the
advancement of renewable
energies this bill has no impact
impact on oil and gas leasing.
It actually insured that
renewable energy is part of the
land office offices mission it
does not take away from modify
any we existing legal
requirements are practices
pertaining to oil and gas
development.
Mr Chairman representative also
just for context you know this
is about making more money in
different areas
if you compared with the two
point four billion vast majority
from this last year in our
Revenue keeping one tax but if
you look at other areas I think
we all agree culturally six
eight very important activity
the state land office we bring
an eight to nine million a year
we brought in twelve million
from renewable we're going to be
bringing in hundreds of millions
so we view it as an additional
aspect that we can generate
money and then I would also you
know just point you to page four
because you know when when the
law was originally drafted it
does talk about oil and gas it
does talk about complete and it
you know petroleum engineer and
those are things that you would
see an office and we have an
office of oil and gas that is
very established so
you know there's not really that
we wanted to make it clear this
was a duty of the land
commissioner to establish this.
And that was important to us but
I think there are some changes
at the we can do a quicker and
friends to address the issue
that was raised previously
doesn't help with placement
to the language as well.
Thank you Mr thank you thank
you.
I
thank you present Representative
Townsend.
Yes thank you Mr chair.
Thank you Representative can you
explain to.
K. right to me this new office
will enhance state engineers
ability to make.
Which may ask the.
That are.
It just it stated thank you.
Can you explain to me how this
bill will help the State Land
Office make more money.
Yes Mister chair I it already
has I think that what I just
said earlier on regards to that
a hundred and forty up fourteen
hundred percent increase in
revenues with it renewal at
renewable energies from the
office and and the triple number
of active leases and make a
what's under the lease by two
hundred fifty percent.
So there are currently thirty
thirty nine active long term
leases twenty nine wind twelve
or solar and thirty three least
applications six wind and
thirteen solar and fourteen to
conduct due diligence on the
liability issues so what
projects so the map I.
With over the map maybe little
bit will choose to increase.
How this projects are growing
where they are growing Mr chair.
In.
Representative.
My question to us.
Hello this office allow them to
make more money than they're
doing now with the records it's
just spoke up very good Mr chair
I'll defer to Mr Chairman
representative I think by having
it in statute by having it as a
duty of the land commission our
it helps ensure that it's
actually budgeted for its
resources and their person as we
all know nothing happens in
state government unless you got
budgeted people and hi by
creating the statutory form work
like this it helps make sure
that that's a reality you know
we did so many projects this
last four years that frankly you
know may not have occurred had
we not staffed up that office
you know in your neck of the
woods for example in Chavis
Senator did a great project
added fifty five thousand solar.
panels for twenty minutes it's
going to expand into phase two.
On we we gas.
and so this is a broad area it's
hitting and and hi forgive me I
didn't end up the maps with the
permission of the commissioner
we are the commission the
chairman happy to if you'd like
that show the the solar and wind
projects around the state that
we have but it's that capacity
building that's really important
and having a statutory framework
really allows us to go to the
legislature and others and say
this is a real thing.
So Mr Chairman.
Representative one.
Is it your testimony that if you
had these offices for
agriculture and.
All and gas and for all of these
other entities that you that
your office
supervises and in exploits.
That they would be in they would
in turn see benefits.
Mr Chairman representative we've
been doing agricultural lease
and for over a hundred years
we've been doing oil and gas for
well over a hundred years I
commercial development in
different capacities those are
well established that aspects
Division you know that's why you
see so much of the statutory I I
envision down the road we're
going to see a a section of law
on renewable energy just like
was was mentioned previously
about why the other areas have
have more activity
they're they're established and
so we didn't feel like it was
necessary to put those in
statute this is something that
is new and merging and we want
to maintain it for the long run
but it didn't it didn't have
that same dynamic in terms of
you know not having that
institution all our resources
behind.
Chairman representative I I'm
kind of like my colleague just
really doesn't bother me.
A lot other than it's just to
make me feel good kind of the
bill you have the ability to
ramp up for your own gas
activity you have the ability to
wrap up Ag ability you certainly
have the ability to ramp up for
your renewable portfolio I don't
see the need to bring another.
And codified
in another office.
In two inches your current view
of responsibility when you have
and you have shown the state the
state land office has shown the
ability to ramp up to all of
these challenges.
For over a hundred years.
Mr Chairman representative I I I
think that's a very legitimate
point what I would say it is hi
we are trying to ensure that
with regard to the future.
There is no doubt that we've
been doing it and we can do it
without statute and when I say
we the commissioner of public
lands Stephanie Garcia Richard
they want this to be around for
the future that we're not gonna
be around we think we will
energy should be part of the
mandate of the office and that's
why we think it's important hi
very you know it's in elected
office commissioners come and go
they have different priorities
and it is important to us not to
micromanage for that reason in
here.
But the broad proposition that.
There is renewable energy we
should be capturing it from a
beneficiary standpoint from a
revenue standpoint from the
clean energy standpoint that was
important to us to try to
preserve for the future so I I
don't disagree with what you're
saying in terms of today
we're doing it whether we have
this legislation or not it's
it's a matter of the future.
Representative I appreciate
those chapters of.
I thank you.
Yes eight the less topical
approach of the current lan
Committee Mr the cost of by a
particular industry or other
industries.
Give them a heads up.
To get them.
Treatment.
To.
To.
To identify it as the State Bank
group a specific industry they
get special treatment.
Over all of the other ones.
And that's why out of that is
because.
It is eight.
Philosophical it's not
necessarily.
What is good for New Mexico it's
budgets.
This commissioner believes is
our in our opinion is good for
New Mexico.
And I think she has all of the
ability in the world reach out
and touch any of these
industries she can ramp up she
can do anything.
And for that reason I just think
this is something that's not
needed.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
Representative Townsend for
those comments I just say that
we are we're in a different
place and time now in over the
hundred years of the prior to
prioritizing oil and gas I think
that this is the timing of and
investment that we need to take
into consideration and to look
to the future with what we have
We're going to have future land
commissioners in place and to
their discretion they could
remove this office in these
projects going forward we're
also under the energy transition
act which is which is which is
taking place wealth of this this
lends itself to it was prior
tort prioritized
Energy act
Goals that we have to meet so I
say that just puts us in a place
we get to those goals we need
those we need to the challenge
where it is and this is why
we're doing this Mr chair thank
you.
The gap on the.
Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr chairman
Representative.
I think.
Representative Nibert I think
Describe my my thought process
probably about.
Probably the best which is.
It appears that walks section.
Of lost.
the the the law.
And in the way that the the
question between.
The office and.
Representative Scott.
Was.
This section.
Is really about the produce here
responsibility of the office.
It seems awkward to say.
Here's the shared responsibility
of the land commission.
We want to create a new office
and shove it into the section of
law.
Where it just basically says
that the land office needs to
raise money for kids.
I I I I think I.
I kind of agree with
Representative fiber I think you
would get more support.
Maybe even maybe even five part
is over.
If we just moved back for the
other responsibilities
concerning raising concerning
oil and gas for its already
Representative Representative.
Discussion between Avenue
between.
Representative Scott office was.
That.
This mean establishing more full
time.
Staff.
But I think if that were placed
in that other section.
I think it would justify it
would do the same thing as
currently exists for grazing is
currently exists for so logging
is currently exists for oil and
gas
But I think to the to to
Representative Townsend I I I
passing all that for you can get
everything that the offices they
they want.
And what do you suggest that you
want out of this is for to be
built in as a as at least
similar ground is what
everything is that's existed for
a hundred years would continue.
It just seems like trying to
shove a square peg into the
round to around for for the this
they do share the
responsibilities existed on
rather than.
Back.
Where you would get everything
else that you want to and at
this time
Secretary and our priorities are
so I I mean.
You understand.
Because I I at this point I
can't for children.
Or it's just it's not in the
right place sure I will take
you.
Your comments into consideration
with a feel that this is with
the place where need to be in
the function of this office and
where it's it's already been
established and just move
forward this is this is where
consistency check thank you for
those comments.
Thank you Mr chairman and I I
will for the which is to it.
It appears.
Once again that what we're doing
is just making a.
If you could be done somewhere
else and achieve everything that
you're wanting to this just
appears maybe the part of a.
More of.
So a sophomore political.
Statement that there rather than
someone else especially since we
have the energy transition at
the office will have no choice
but to do that going forward so
if this is not just to provide
more full time staff and
codifying it through an effort
and actually having an office
exists that is just something
Chairman.
Thank you so much so yeah
Representative Scott for second
time.
Appreciate the diligence and
will be able to just.
It is the state land office
manage its own finances it is.
Are you subject to the
appropriation Mr Chairman
representative we are subject to
your will we are funded a
hundred percent off of the
revenue that we generate.
And
Right of that two billion we
don't just get to take it ****
nilly we come to you we ask for.
To use a percentage of that in
our budget is allocated by the
legislature.
And Mr chairman you.
Currently allocations
researchers up to current.
Sure
Mr Chairman representative hi
subject to the normal budget
process and purpose and
categories and contract lines
you know we put that forward hi
DFA our budget request DFA
sometimes agrees LFC sometimes
agrees that putting their
recommendation and then
despondent provides us with the
deem appropriate so we have the
ability to request but not
Mr Mr last question.
The population just language
and.
Location.
You'll be attempting to I.
Future.
Land commissions public policy
or commission policy is
currently being managed by the
current.
Commission.
Mr Chairman representative that
would be accurate just as this
section of long Page four lines
the land commissioner of higher
petroleum engineer to do oil and
gas leasing for oil and gas
purposes to to hire clerks
inspectors to do maps it is a
weird section of the law it has
the fiduciary management side
that's been discussed but then
it is this other stuff that goes
to something that you would
normally see in a whole
different sections so I I I
understand the committee's
questions on the placement but
definitely would encourage you
to you know look at that line
there and there's there's a lot
there that would.
That has and continues to
provide commissioners but that's
our objective we we want for
renewable energy for the future
and will be up front about.
Thank you Mr.
So seeing of further debate from
the committee was will which
chairman of the past I.
Three of the past we have nots
then that this.
It
Representative greater.
Yes.
Senator Dixon yes.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Nibert.
The
governor like to support with
those.
Representative Rubio yes.
Representative stop.
Representative small.
Representative Johnson yep.
I sure Sarinana.
Chairman queen yes.
So the six forty of the best
thank you Mr thank you.
I'm sorry Representative I would
like to explain so my apologies
thank you Mr chair
I think it's very important for
us to pass legislation.
That is cool.
There is a provision that was
altered that takes a fairly
unclear provision that makes it
even less clear.
And we voted to pass.
In the US the provision in this
bill and I think these things
are being fixed before they move
on it's not be addicts and
therefore photo now the if you
make those changes probably
would have a unanimous vote but
I can't support passing stuff on
down the line that does not make
any sense and people can't make
heads or tails of the and nobody
in this room including
Representative from the State
Land Office could tell what that
means so thank you Mr thank you
Representative Nibert.
Next up is Bill two for two
private right of action certain
statutes.
by your sorry on the.
Thank you madam chair
Madam chair members of the
committee house bill two forty
two creates a private right of
action.
For our middle us.
Your call the control act
hazardous waste act.
The water quality at the San
waste.
Through a private landowners
private people excuse me per
private individuals to sue to
enforce existing law.
It creates no new obligations to
comply with existing law it just
lets private individuals to to
enforce that law.
Any penalties collected.
Would be turned over to the
state very state funds.
So no private recovery.
Attorney's fees maybe awarded.
Or may not be.
So there's no guarantee of
attorney's fees entrance fees
could be awarded to either part.
So as a result of that the
penalty provisions in the few
provisions.
This is a bill that the use.
For a personal or private
windfall.
There is no incentive to sue
under this act other than.
Forcing.
In you know there's there's
always the concern about
civilised suits.
I will assure you that the
possibility of the award of
attorney's fees is a
disincentive to file a frivolous
lawsuits.
because Tracey's as we although
get quite expensive.
Quite quickly.
In those files to the list
they're pretty sure.
That they're correct.
Madam chair members of the
committee.
There's a reasonable argument to
be made that we should fully
fund our state agencies so they
can do this for.
And the answer is that's right
we should.
The historically we haven't.
And you know I think our current
funding levels
I hear makes things.
I certainly here
frequent complaints for our
state agencies that they don't
have the manpower.
They don't have the resources to
do their job.
This allows private individuals
when their suffering are not
just **** nilly they have to
suffer are.
To step in and protect
themselves under existing law.
So if you this is really a very
modest step forward
I'm joined today by Mister
Charles to sailing to like turn
over it's like to make a few
comments he has much more
experience in this area that I
do
in he has a.
He can explain to you that.
Laws like these do not result in
the delusion of litigation this
is the second.
Thank you Representative McQueen
madam chair members of the
committee good afternoon R. I
think it's afternoon now
I just well good morning David I
just want to make a few comments
here letting you know that as as
Representative McQueen indicated
this bill if it is passed is not
going to result in a daily wage
of litigation or or opening up
the floodgates there are a
number of limitations that are
in the bill that will.
Certainly reduce the incentive
in the ability of plaintiffs to
bring lawsuits first of all
there has to be a violation
there isn't a violation of
current law then there's no
cause of action here.
Second of all the plaintiff has
to have standing in other words
is the the plaintiff has to have
a concrete interest in the
outcome of the of the
litigation.
Third there has to be notice so
before a.
A prospective plaintiffs can
bring an action here she asked
to notify the the agency the
regulatory agency which is the
environment department after
regular we have to notify the
Attorney General and they have
to notify the violator
allows an opportunity for the
regulatory agency or the agency
to step in and bring into force
in action
and it also gives the violator
an opportunity to correct the
problem.
then there's also a provision at
eight and action is barred if
the the regulatory agency or the
term the general is already
brought
and is diligently prosecuting a
an action
a civil action to address the
violations.
finally the cause of action here
would be subject to the three
year statute of limitations
provision date existing in
current law offered towards
so
and and and and in my experience
and and I worked for the New
Mexico environment department
for about fourteen years
and I looked at that one of my
responsibilities was looking at
lawsuits citizen suits that were
brought under federal law in all
of the federal environmental
statutes you include citizen to
provisions such as this one
and I spent may be
twenty hours in that fourteen
years of reviewing notices
reviewing status into to meeting
with plaintiffs
one of my former colleagues at
the attorney general's office
tenants fox's here and I she
could represent she in the
thirteen years that you worked
at the environment department
she spent zero hours dealing
with with citizens to issues
and I would also point out that
the mining act in New Mexico
mining act has had citizen suit
provision in it since nineteen
ninety three
since then there have been
exactly two lawsuits to citizen
suits brought under the mining
act
there's also a a somewhat
rudimentary and an archaic
citizen suit provision in the
oil and gas that doesn't allow
for penalties but it does allow
for for
for injunctive relief and that's
been there for decades it's
never been used so you know some
of the some of the concerns that
people have that this is going
to result in in a whole lot of
litigation are are not.
Supported by what our actual
experiences
so thank you members the
committee madam chair I'll be
happy to to assist in answering
questions.
Thank you madam chair.
Audience so first this raise
your hand if you are in support
of the bill.
And those opposed.
All right.
Let's start with the opposition
so we're gonna get in the line
use the.
you have two minutes I'm only
gonna go for thirty minutes.
Hello.
good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is JD
Bullington and I'm speaking on
behalf today on the greater
Albuquerque chamber of commerce
which is which is opposing this
legislation because it believes
it will undermine the regulatory
framework that we have in place
to objectively enforce the
various acts to which this
legislation applies and a stable
and predictable regulatory
environment is key to business
development and growth the
greater Albuquerque chamber of
commerce does believe this what
was result in a string of
lawsuits and those would present
challenges to state agencies
settle businesses in our state
with enormous costs and send a
message to companies outside New
Mexico that this is not an easy
place to do business so stable
and predictable regulation and
oversight by state agencies is
the best way for businesses to
be treated fairly while
addressing public concerns thank
you.
Okay good morning madam chair
committee members Christianizing
registered lobbyist for chevron
we respectfully but strongly
oppose H. B. two forty two
chevron is committed to
responsible energy development
in New Mexico however review
this bill is an attempt to halt
our development efforts in New
Mexico on a blanket basis since
restraining orders or
injunctions filed in state court
under the provisions of this
bill maybe immediate chevron's
activities could become subject
to interruptions and downtime
caused by individuals making
baseless and frivolous claims
this will create significant
regulatory and operational
uncertainty for chevron's future
operations in Southeast New
Mexico lastly I will speak based
on my experience from the former
quest of mine where I supported
community economic development
efforts this included affordable
housing like manufacturing and
agriculture this bill will
enable and encourage frivolous
litigation against project
developers and farmers and those
have a chilling effect on
efforts to promote economic
development and poverty
reduction throughout the state
for these reasons chevron
opposes H. B. two forty two
thank you for your time.
You.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is
Marco Gonzales and I'm the
Richard this for Invenergy it
gives us no pleasure today to
have to propose a chairman's
bill he has been a supporter of
many renewable of of programs in
New Mexico but here's where we
must part company today many of
our projects come under the same
permits and certificates that
require they are under these
various acts and so we're very
concerned about the ability for
projects for us in a timely
fashion we're getting ready to
build at about a three hundred
mile transmission line across
New Mexico at the about over two
billion dollars and so we're
concerned about being able to
get these this project done in a
timely fashion I'm I would like
to point out in the F. I. R.
that that up both the
environment department and the
energy department stated
significant legal resources are
going to be required to do this
they're already short for
attorneys at Environment
Department this man require at
least four more and and in
particular in the performance
applications or implications
there isn't a note that says
that this might have no
consequences on immediate New
Mexico environment department's
privacy in various programs
programs granted by the US and
EPA so what that's saying is
that
the EPA will look unfavorably
upon of many of the applications
we purport forward for federal
money because of the fact that
we don't have enough resources
already within the department to
be able to do the job that
they're already doing so I would
like the committee to take note
of that and if this bill should
moving forward it really does
need to go to House
Appropriations of finance to
address the fiscal implications
clearly thank you madam chair
members of the committee.
Thank you.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name's Jeremy
Turner I am the director of New
Mexico project development for
pattern energy we are about to
be the largest energy generator
in the state we're investing
eight billion dollars in New
Mexico's economy later on this
year three twenty twenty six
these projects already take over
a decade to complete and we are
very seriously concerned about
the additional time that could
be created with this additional
of litigation and cause further
delay in the ability to actually
build out our clean energy
economy this is a disincentive
for businesses that locate here
and so we respectfully stand in
opposition of the legislation
thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is Chelsea
Canada and I'm the director of
public policy at the New Mexico
chamber of commerce we
respectfully oppose H. B. two
forty two our reserves out of
our economic competitive
analysis driving New Mexico's
future found that New Mexico's
regulations are viewed as
complex and confusing and I miss
it so thoroughly time consuming
compared to our neighboring
states.
We support legislation that will
recruit and retain business in
the state this proposal will
work against the aim creating
additional regulatory
uncertainty The New Mexico
chamber of commerce opposes
authorizing private citizens to
bring actions on their own
behalf on behalf of the state to
enforce.
State environmental regulations
or permit conditions it is the
job of state agencies to enforce
current laws and regulations and
said N. M. C. C. supports our
protective regulatory framework
dealing with environmental
issues in New Mexico the
uncertainty created by this
legislation will affect the
ability to retain and attract
investment of private capital to
grow industries and expand job
growth in the state of New
Mexico chamber of commerce
believes the Economic
Development diversifying our
economy can unlock the quality
of opportunity for the next
generation of New Mexicans for
these reasons we respectfully
oppose this piece of legislation
thank you.
Chairman committee members my
name is Bronson corn on with the
New Mexico cattle growers we're
here to stand in opposition of
house bill two forty two this
bill is going to give like it's
been said it's going to get the
right to for anybody to super
any infraction that they deem is
hazardous to their health I
understand that that through the
air quality and water quality
acts that that set standards but
there's a lot of laws that are
going on right now that if you
feel a certain way.
It takes a lot of presidents.
Who's going up through the
environmental Department how
willing are they going to be to
add additional lawyers for two
four hundred dollars an hour for
all these additional claims are
gonna be coming forward the oil
and gas and that agriculture and
oil and gas industry going to be
most affected by this with even
though we are two of the largest
segments of the budget that
comes into the state of New
Mexico.
Not all people
and this is that I'm not all
people are inherently good and
whatever you have laws that
state that me driving down
county road kicking up a bunch
of dirt is going to be hazardous
to their health that that brings
an entirely new light on things
and if you look under the
equality act us also looks at
their under the equality act
dirt and dust is a injures
substance so I ask you to to
reconsider and the bank and to
stand in opposition of house
bill two forty two thank you.
Let's get the trying to.
Thank you.
Madam chair committee my name is
Laura Riley I'm a lobbyist with
gavel land solutions Catalan
solutions represents a operated
businesses including select
energy which has and celery well
and gas services as well as a
lot of very which is a large
group of agriculturists
throughout the state I will not
repeat mostly because we've
heard from both of those groups
but we we do have concerns about
the regulatory uncertainty of
this thank you.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee Jason Weaks I'm
representing two clients on this
and they both stand out in
opposition to this measure with
all due respect to the chairman
Albuquerque's been a chamber of
commerce's first client that we
feel like this is the anti
development bill even
responsible development could be
challenged by a private citizen
and it could cause
the developments not happen this
could lead to negative economic
packs probably and quite frankly
even to affordable housing
developments somebody built
apartment complex is going to
sprout up and hasn't and
negative impact to the
environment that they experience
they could challenges in a court
of law on more that and and and
because it not happen the other
client that I have is target
targets a gas processor they
move gas from point a to point
B. the points have already been
made so I stand in opposition to
this measure from targets
perspective as well thank you.
Madam chair members the
committee this is the other
Jason speaking on behalf of
speaking on behalf of the
associated general contractors
in New Mexico as well as the
Mexico City of the professional
economic developers association
I just wanted to know to in fall
of twenty twenty the state
economic development department
published a twenty year
strategic plan for economic
development in New Mexico which
many businesses across the state
as well as economic development
organizations participated in
the plan states that aside from
taxes The New Mexico
stakeholders noted it generally
burdensome regulatory
environment that is highly
fractured we really do believe
that this bill would frack would
even attract more fracture the
regulatory environment we four
are given the increased
competition that we see from
other states in terms of
learning economic development
projects in the state we really
cannot afford to pass this
legislation because it would
chill potential investment in
New Mexico we state in
opposition.
Thank you madam chair the
opportunity speak right now our
Permian basin petroleum
association
the question was posed to bring
is a case a person who was
injured in fact economically or
otherwise or is imminently
threatened with injury so could
a.
You bring suit even if you do
not live close to the site if
you were worried about the
mission more pollutants did
someone in Raton bring a suit
against operation and gel.
Another point would like to make
is that all four enforcement
rights expressly allow for inter
claim stacking.
What is unclear what the purpose
that might serve it represents a
troubling to trend where
plaintiffs in Clinton's
appointments are repeatedly
provided the opportunity to
again by the apple thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee make my Estes within
America
So reasons already stated
departments and agencies
currently have the ability to
enforce their own regulation and
policies so this would tie up
our court systems and further
burden our state departments
which are substantially
understaffed as it is again that
last is with no that we oppose
this bill.
Good morning madam chair members
the committee Kerry robin
printer registered lobbyists for
advanced energy United we're
trade association of over a
hundred companies that represent
the full range of advanced
energy technologies and services
both grid scale and distributed
our mission is a hundred percent
clean electricity and our
companies are engaged in a
variety of project development
manufacturing and technology
installations to move us toward
closer to that goal I'm our
members share the concerns of
the chairman about the
environment in his commitment to
protecting air and water we
agree that the air quality
control lack hazardous waste act
the water quality act and the
solid waste act our bedrock laws
that help us live in a healthy
environment and those agency
should be fully funded to
enforce those laws however we
believe that this bill hands a
tool to people who don't share
our goals the bill will make it
harder to build out new clean
energy electricity and
transportation infrastructure
and that is what we needed to in
order to achieve future goals of
our state for that reason we
pose thank you.
Chair members the committee Tony
trivial.
Excuse me with Freeport and are
also Representative in the New
Mexico Bynum Association.
we stand in the position of this
bill which would expose
businesses in New Mexico two
additional liabilities and
litigation all of the reasons
have already been stated but I
will say that many seven or
built up been introduced in the
past but for good reasons of not
been enacted just let me overall
it's it's been our experience
that state agencies do good job
in enforcing environmental laws
without the need for this type
of legislation so was that in
that position.
Madam chair members of the
committee Carl's looser with
public service company New
Mexico we respectfully oppose
house bill two forty two is on
the huge cost of litigations.
it is a concern at all levels
and for other previous
statements we we also oppose
this bill thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee Jim Winchester with
the independent petroleum
association of New Mexico we do
have about three hundred fifty
members and association and
quite a few of them are smaller
operators in so there is a real
major concern with smaller
operators that lawsuits will
come into place that will
basically cost so much to
litigate that it would take them
out of business but I also know
that it's very much a
disincentive to do business in
the oil and gas industry for
small operators with the sort of
rule in place we do definitely
support environmental protection
in the rules that are in place
with the regulators and we hope
that they it should be the ones
that would be
The getting on these thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee had Roose model of the
New Mexico rural electric
cooperative association rural
electric cooperative right
greatly to our rural areas by
providing of many jobs what this
bill will do will Stifel and
economic growth or perhaps even
stop economic growth so in areas
that are greatly hurt to begin
with so we stand in opposition
to this bill thank you.
Good morning madam chair with a
tri state respectfully read.
Opposes house bill two forty two
for the reasons that been stated
thank you very.
Vince Martinez.
Right extenuating to go for
those who are in favor of the
bill.
These come up if you are is
there anybody different.
Excuse me thank you madam chair
my name is Panos fox and I'm a
senior lawyer was western
environmental law center and I
also have done I practiced
environmental law for over
twenty years mostly with the
state of New Mexico through the
state environment department and
the attorney general's office
and a few actual facts that I'd
like to let you know about
in terms of the worries about
this mountain of lawsuits that
will result as a result of this
bill and the state resources
that will it will take many of
you are probably familiar with
the mining act that is over
forty years old and that has a
citizen suit provision in it and
there has been one citizen suit
provision brought in the over
forty years of that act that
citizen suit provision is
actually broader than the one
before you in that
citizens may sue the state which
is not allowed under this
particular bill and
administrative enforcement
actions preempt a citizen
lawsuit which is not the case
here so that's a broader act
it's been around forty years
there's been one suit the wind
gas act also has a citizen suit
provision in it that has been
around for decades and there
have been no lawsuits brought to
that citizen suit provision when
I was at the Environment
Department Mr state Mr Salem oh
we all all the already reference
the fact that I spent no time at
all on working on any kind of
citizen suit provision citizen
suit suits that were brought we
would've been brought under
federal law and I can remember
you know a handful of those
suits brought under the clean
air act for the clean water act
my time during NMED.
But but that's it so I think the
idea that there's going to be
this raft of lawsuits as a
result of this legislation is
belied by the actual facts here
the ground
in New Mexico
but two forty two HB two forty
two would do is give the state
an additional tool to protect
New Mexico communities and could
add to the state treasury
through the imposition of
penalties so we urge you very
strongly to pass two forty two
at this committee thank you very
much.
Madam chair members of the
committee Douglas Michael John
registered lobbyist for
conservation voters New Mexico
it's been pointed out to you
that under the The New Mexico
mining act in into the federal
laws that allow for citizen
suits New Mexico has not been
deluged by a flood of litigation
I would also point out to you
that in other states where
citizens who provisions have
been enacted there has not been
a flood implication the most
comprehensive study that was
done about the effect of
enacting citizen suit
legislation was done in Michigan
and the up experience there or
indicates that in New Mexico
there will be few citizen suit
of lawsuits filed they are
however an appropriate and
necessary tools for people they
have to protect themselves if I
am polluting the air and the
pollution in the air is
adversely affecting Mr dis a one
Mr disable them ought to be able
to require me to comply with the
state error Act that's what this
bill would allow to happen
conservation voters New Mexico
urges strongly the to support
this legislation thank you.
Madam of vice chair of the ferry
down.
And
Mr chair
The twenty if you hold Mike.
So this is sharing the and I am
an environmental justice at
activist and retired of
government attorney so I would
like to address the comments by
industry
that the regular price
regulatory process is an option.
I always say
I would like to comment on that
because I was in the regulatory
process of what the government
or and I would say that of
government workers work
government workers work very
hard I worked.
Constantly fifty to sixty hours
a week but.
There's there's just not enough
resources enough time to make
that regulatory process work the
way it should work so I disagree
with the industry that of the
regulatory processes of working
fine and dandy it it really is
on the regulatory process is
dominated by industry
representatives there are
resources greatly towards the
consumer insurance and consumer
advocates in the regulatory
process
and this is not to up a little
or put down the consumer
advocates in the regulatory
process they are brave just to
government lawyers
and yeah.
It's not enough and this is why
I stand here today in support of
of this bill house bill two
forty two because it will add to
the toolbox that we still need
to achieve economic
environmental justice and to
avert Department of prices.
I've mentioned meaningful
consultation today already and
also of equitable economic
development I'm gonna say that
again of those two principles
are so important to everything
but this committee has address
today including this bill two
forty two we need this tool to
bring the community center have
a platform for the communities
to engage in that process to
make sure eleven of the the
playing field level renewable
energy of is a reality that that
is not to match down by oil and
gas and PNM and
so for those reasons.
For those reasons I support to
forty two thank you thank you
all right run going on ritual
site we're gonna start with
those propose in opposition
please leave your hand up
otherwise.
Start with opposition.
All right we're gonna start with
Tiffany Rivera.
Madam.
Are you there Tiffany.
Now Tiffany.
All right we're gonna.
Here choppy can try again.
Can you hear me yes we can hear
you.
Thank you I'm more of a
registered lobbyist for New
Mexico farm and livestock bureau
I'll keep it quick for the
record we stand in opposition to
the bill thank you thank you.
Exes Bernalillo treat.
Madam chair.
Members of the committee
Bernalillo treat manager
government affairs rectilinear
G. for reasons already stated we
do stand
respectfully in opposition to
this bill thank you ma'am.
Thank you exes Beverly I just
think that.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee I'm
Beverly it's in good executive
director of dairy producers of
New Mexico we respectfully stand
in opposition to house bill two
forty two in the past we've had
out of state attorney groups
that have come to New Mexico to
attack animal agriculture mainly
dairies and they've done this in
other states as well this was in
part due to our state's weak
right to farm act we have since
fixed that but we believe this
unintended consequence of this
legislation would attract those
same types of students to come
to New Mexico to attack our
family farms again so for this
and other reasons stated
respectfully oppose house bill
two forty two thank you thank
you next is barely came.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee on is early
came state director for
Americans for prosperity we have
our activist across New Mexico
if the New Mexico urged you to
vote no on house bill two forty
two private right of action for
certain statutes well model
actresses citizen suit
provisions that are federal
environmental laws house bill
two forty two would actually
create unnecessary an
unprecedented private right of
action and remove accountability
house bill two forty two would
devastate small businesses
encouraged in this litigation
exacerbate energy poverty and
set back environmental progress
we ask you to vote no thank you
for your time.
Thank you next is Leri Sonntag.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee representing
the New Mexico business
coalition this morning an
organization of hundreds of
businesses and thousands of New
Mexicans we respectfully oppose
house bill two forty two.
New Mexico currently has four
agencies that are have been
created and funded with taxpayer
dollars to handle environmental
issues of concern.
While individual should have the
right to bring concerns or
issues to one of the four
agencies for investigation and
prosecution house bill two forty
to create a new environmental
private right of action making
it even harder to recruit and
retain businesses.
In addition to the COVID you
already are this bill would
create an unfriendly business
environment the potential for
out side lawsuits creates undue
hardship on our four agencies as
well we're charged with taking
care of the environment we urge
you to say no to house bill two
forty two thank you thank you
and different content.
Good morning madam chair Deborah
Condit register lobbyist for an
interested Energy Alliance and
we respectfully oppose house
bill two forty two we feel that
potential for house bill two
forty two to to create a series
of legal challenges makes
investments in utility scale
renewable projects
unpredictable which impedes on
the future of clean entered at
clean energy into thank you for
hearing our concerns about this
bill.
Thank you yeah we're gonna go to
those in support you raise your
hand if you're into.
Gonna start with Lucas turned
in.
Thank you madam chair once again
my name is a concern and I am a
registered lobbyist for progress
now New Mexico but on this
particular bill I am once again
coming as a private citizen who
after watching the proceedings
all morning find it extremely
clear.
That those who already have the
means to address issues like
this with paid legal
representation are clearly able
to do so as they have shown up
in force today to oppose this
bill however citizens like
myself and the millions of New
Mexicans who don't have that
opportunity if the state is
unable to continue to protect us
from the environmental
degradation of extraction
industry should have the right
to defend ourselves legally in
court and I strongly support
this bill energy do pass thank
you.
Thank you next is developed the
woman.
Tammy feeble corn and Camilla I.
Thank you everybody this is
Camilla I amend with the Rio
Grande chapter of the Sierra
Club.
Our environmental agencies are
steeply under funded our
oversight and regulatory
agencies have to fight for
income that comes into the state
from private profit off are
publicly held public resources
if this body cannot properly
fund oversight agencies to do
the job to oversee private
industry that profits hand over
fist while doing harm to our air
water children and communities
citizen should have that right
regulatory certainty industry is
counting on the certainty that
our agencies don't have the
resources they need to oversee
their at activities who pays for
that again our air our water our
kids and our families lawsuits
are expensive groups like mine
do not take such actions lightly
and we only carry them forward
and less we have exhausted every
other remedy.
Only when agencies can't do
their jobs do we take this type
of action as you can see from
the actual record of lawsuits
this is an additional tool in
the state's toolbox to protect
the environment and public
health this does not supplant
the compliments States
enforcement authority it has a
provisions that will effectively
prevent lawsuits without merit
thank you for your
consideration.
Thank you X. descent Johnson.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is
Sierra Sierra reader books yet
to use United for climate crisis
action we support eighty two
forty two because we think it's
critical that community members
have the ability to hold
polluters accountable I really
do wish there was stronger and
are perfect for a few minutes to
to the oil and gas action force
remember additionally you wish
the bill included more community
consultation about those recent
changes particularly funds in
the consultations in New Mexico
we know that environmental
racism has led to our indigenous
and low income communities of
color bearing disproportionate
burdens when it comes to the
pollution and contamination
because I extractive industries
and dirty energy some of our
members have been directly
harm is highly impacted
extraction this law will empower
community members to sound the
alarms on demand action thank
you to sponsors to bring this
bill.
yes you all to support and
strengthen H. B. two forty two.
Thank you next is Oscar since.
Thank you madam chair.
Members of the members of the
committee I represent Rio Grande
indivisible.
We are in support of house bill
two forty two because as already
stated the state does not have
the staffing and resources to
protect the health environment
and wildlife in New Mexico.
This is critical I used to work
for the state and I witnessed
this for over thirty years
dealing with contamination and
turning a blind eye and or not
having the resources to
regulate.
And stop pollution so I urge you
to support.
House bill two forty two thank
you very much Mr maclean for
bring in this bill thank you
thank you next is Mary Feldblum.
A good morning or good afternoon
madam chair members of the
committee my name is Mary
Feldblum and I represent
first works oil and gas
accountability project we urge
you to support this bill for so
many reasons I don't know how
many of you have ever tried to
go to court over an issue but it
is a very very argue with
costly and and emotionally
stressful of midway to resolve
the problem and you know I do
not understand if all these all
those in opposition for
following the law if they are
good actors what they are afraid
of it you know the challenge to
go to court over someone who has
broken the law is these are
enormous and it is unfair to ex
expect citizens to wait until
the these agencies have the
staff eventually to address
their problems they have to be
able to deal with these problems
immediately and I am struck by a
report that to secretary Kenny
made in December about
enforcement all and the
environmental enforcement and he
what he in testimony said our
compliance rates for oil and gas
facilities in southeast New
Mexico has historically not been
great and there is significant
leaks happening as well as Texas
blowing in their emissions well
as.
Time is up thank you.
All right that is everyone.
No one working on the issue.
Hello my name is Kaley Shipman
I'm a community organizer with
citizens caring for the future
based in Carlsbad New Mexico in
the heart of the Permian basin
where some of the most powerful
corporations the world such as
chevron have come into our
community to mine our resources
with little regard for the
people living there just a week
ago I was out in the field with
the young community members ex
works we were by a community one
of her family members houses and
we received clear violations of
the clean air act and we had to
tell her that we weren't even
going to bother somebody these
are my best agencies because
they do not have the resources
to follow up on those complaints
this is unacceptable citizens
must have a way to fight back
especially somewhere like in the
Permian basin and this is one
way to do so and it's very
mentioned a way that no one
really wants to take so we
really strongly urge you to
support this bill thank you.
Thank you Mr that is the end of
the bridge of COVID I want to go
back to the sponsor for
additional come.
Right steep sorry Weisberg.
Madam chair and committee
members I live in a rural area
my representatives.
Never respond to my emails
so I effectively have no
representation I rely on well
water
so I have no government agency
protecting my water
I think everyone here has spoken
so eloquently about the need for
citizens to be able to have some
power when there are bad actors
polluting and luckily I haven't
had that personally affect me
but I if that were to happen who
do I turn to and so I strongly
urge you to vote for H. B. two
forty two thank you very much.
Active sponsor partition.
Thank you madam chair then chair
members of the committee we we
heard a lot of comments
including a lot opposition in in
listening to the comments.
To me this sort of the the
opposition pounced on the three
buckets.
The first are sort of the usual
suspects the usual claims.
Frivolous litigation analyst
litigation.
Excessive expense.
Despite the fact that we have
experience with Susan to
provisions.
And that hasn't happened in any
of the other areas so it's the
standard claim but it's not
borne out by experience.
Second bucket is that.
This bill would send the wrong
message B. disincentive to
locate here.
And when I hear that.
I I I mean I I'm just so shocked
because to me it's saying that
it's a disincentive to locate
your.
That we would expect a business
here to comply with our laws.
That's all this is it's
enforcement existing loss.
And.
If that's an incentive to
locating here.
I.
Some companies come here they
should comply with our laws.
The third bucket route I think
simply some disingenuous
comments of this bill is a
threat to affordable housing to
family farms and small business.
That's true
it would stop economic growth.
Simply false my favorite was we
should adopt this bill because
it would put a burden on our
understaffed agencies.
Which is really interesting
because we're also told that we
don't need this bill because we
fully funded or agencies.
So madam chair members of the
committee what what I ask is
that.
You focus on what the bill
actually does.
Not all of the pundits claim it
might.
Thank you madam chair thank you
are we going to committee the
first person to speak is a
Representative night which.
Thank you madam chair Mr chair.
So let's focus on what it does.
Madam chair Mister chair.
Right now if someone is.
Directly impacted.
By.
This call pollution.
They do have a cause of action
that they can have a judicata
the courts family.
Madam chair the reserve line
we're not being a litigator I'm
gonna rely expert Heffley in
this discussion.
This is thank you madam chair Mr
are to be representative Nibert
here there is the possibility
bring it toward K. yes this is a
little bit different tort case
the plaintiff is seeking damages
in this citizens to the
plaintiff is seeking compliance
compliance with the law so that
is is really a difference in the
in the quality of the lawsuit.
Representative madam chair and
Mr this.
The the fact remains that people
who are directly injure.
Have a good to see recovery for
their injuries under existing
law.
Madam chair and.
Representative Nibert yes that's
correct okay so so madam chair
and and Mr chair getting back to
what this law does.
What this law does is create.
Okay separate.
Avenue for private citizens to
pursue that does not currently
exist under existing laws that.
madam chair Representative night
that's correct.
Under existing law.
These types of actions.
Can still be maintained it's
just who.
Is capable of bringing such
actions is that correct and
chair representative Nibert yes
that's correct currently the the
environment department can bring
an action to enforce the law.
And the actual insurance and
Mr chair.
This the HSD but I would suggest
maybe the Attorney General will
be another one second for sucess
plants can chair of the turning
to the.
And then Madam chair
representative Nibert
that is true if they're
representing.
HSD yes no I worked at the
invite the attorney general's
office we actually brought to
citizen suits under federal law
to enforce the law
as the Attorney General on
behalf of the state of New
Mexico
in one of those cases the
receipt we issued a notice
letter to a facility that was in
violation of the clean water act
and the the entity recognized
the problem corrected the
problem came into compliance and
we never brought a lawsuit and I
think that is a very good
example of how the citizen suit
provisions can work and this was
an action that was
threatened
but not a private party but by
the Attorney General of New
Mexico.
The madam chair Mr chair back to
my question the Attorney General
generally has jurisdiction to
bring in a for.
Ms even without an agency
Promoting that the maybe you can
do it on its own accord  act
that office not
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
In my experience that's not been
the case the the Attorney
General said has had to have it
is sort of a separate basis for
bringing a lawsuit you can't
just bring a lawsuit to in to
enforce any law less
representing one of the
agencies.
At the.
Constitution in the statutes.
That deal with the Attorney
General it seems to be turning
general has wide discretion for
the to protect the interest of
the citizens of New Mexico and
so I would I would suggest that
hi speed internet general
independently bring such actions
in addition to at a restaurant
bonding you side to pursue
litigation will move on ma'am.
The.
The the real concern that I
have.
Is that.
This does create.
An additional class of people.
Two million plus in this case.
Your.
Plaintiffs that compares to
actions that here for.
Would be pursued by the state or
one of its subdivisions one of
its agencies.
The statements made that are.
That may not have a chilling
effect although I.
Sympathize with those who spoke
against.
Because dealing with businesses
they look at a variety of one of
the things they look at when
deciding where to employ their
capital.
This litigation is.
They look at what the potential
risk of implying that capital is
going to entail when they decide
to.
Slide.
At the factory.
Side of the business side of
transmission line side of
whatever it is you want them to
slide one of the things that
they look at is litigation risk.
And so well.
Madam chair Mister chair you may
discount that the.
Focusing on a chilling effect of
for just simply complying with
the laws were.
Not comply with the laws would
have a chilling effect it's
really not.
Their desire to comply with the
laws it's the fact that there
can be brought litigation.
Whether warranted for I've found
that.
Avenue to pursue litigation that
does not exist today so that
factor.
Will be one of the components
that.
Businesses or individuals decide
when they decide to wait capital
in the state of New Mexico.
And so if there's telling us
that we will have a chilling
effect that I think you're I
think they're right because I've
been involved in those
discussions as to what risks.
Companies.
Have to consider when bringing.
Basis so the operation of the
project everyone called it to
the state of New Mexico and
additional of potential for
additional of lawsuits would
would be one of those factors.
I do not believe that.
Any legitimate businesses intend
to locate New Mexico and just
like early I like the wall
Hi.
Representative oil and gas
companies and I can tell you
that the state skip may things
happen we have to as a society
we have to factor in those
groups but I I don't think there
is the the the that.
After the responsible ones or
maybe a few out waters of the
don't care yeah and engage in
such activities and there's
avenues take care of.
But.
If we're going to provide
opportunities.
For future generations we're
provides the ability to.
Sustained.
Our economy to provide.
Jobs and employment
opportunities for our children
and grandchildren.
I think it's incumbent upon us
as policy makers to start moving
in.
Another direction and that is
becoming more.
Friendly I see legislation like
this as setting up that what it
says.
New Mexico.
You better consider some
additional rest when you decide
to locate that project that
factory that.
Business that transmission line
wind farm housing project
whatever it may be in the state
of New Mexico and so I
sympathize with those that are
worried about about that I do
believe that it would have a
chilling effect I don't have any
further questions.
Mr chair would like to comment
on that the that's fine I think
we would agree to probably
disagree on this but I do.
I feel very
CERN about that impact because
I.
I know what goes into the
discussions with people decide
to employee.
Their capital all projects that
come into our state.
Madam chair representative
Nibert
Just a couple of points
Yeah we can agree to disagree I
would accept that
I.
I think the chilling effect.
I would expect the business
making a large investment to
consider the environment that
they're making the best.
Are the reason we get businesses
making investments in New Mexico
is because we have resources in
New Mexico that they want to
happen to.
So to that extent.
They don't have the option of
just going somewhere else.
I think the chilling effect.
His height.
and they might be hiding in
their own the process you know
that if you if you just listen
to the parade of opposition.
Then absolutely the sky's
falling.
But if you look at the history.
And and how these Susan suits
have worked in other statutes
and federal law that's simply
not the case.
So I think that's important to
keep in mind and I would just
say.
One other perhaps more point
there is in there you suggested
there were two million potential
plaintiffs.
If there are two to two million
people in New Mexico Mexico
who're injured and factor
imminently threatened I'd be
concerned about that.
Yeah I certainly think.
I don't think the numbers nearly
a hi of course the to the sense
someone is injured in fact for
it mainly threatened I think
they should every course yeah
the tort claims tort lawsuit.
Is I don't believe is
adequately.
Well madam chair Mister chair us
I didn't see that
They had to show a direct
Injuries to themselves research
and action.
It looked to me like you could
bring in action.
If you.
Suspected war.
Maybe have information that.
One of those federal statutes or
state suppose of this are being
violated.
Madam chair representative
Nibert direct your attention to
page one point twenty one to two
person is injured but in fact
economically or otherwise were
used imminently threatened with
such in your.
that's that frees you all need
it appears in each of the four
sections under each of the four
lost.
And madam chair Mister chair
with would you agree that's
pretty broad.
That we.
Showing that.
Really exposes one to
potential threat of litigation
from.
A large.
The Madam chair representative
Nibert no.
I don't think it's that brought
it's new to me economically or
otherwise includes health X..
and I recognized the X.
significant.
Barrier to entry if you will
that the cost of filing a
lawsuit.
Is substantial so.
You too the opposition comment
that someone could be sued for
driving the truck down the dirt
road.
It's not.
Madam chair Mister chair.
I think we all recognize that
the citizen suits are going to
be brought by John Q. public.
They're going to be brought by
entity that has a very
significant legal staff already
under their wills would that be.
A more plausible scenario for
this type of to.
Madam chair representative
Nibert I don't know
How much experience you have in
the nonprofit world I have some.
and it's.
You know struggling to pay rent
these aren't deep pockets.
They're very careful.
I know of one nonprofit
organization and this is
Seven probably thirty forty
years ago it was a
When trust.
File a lawsuit
based on certain questionable
language in the the covenant.
Lost.
The defendant was a torque
reported fees.
They went out of business they
did not survive that.
Nonprofit organizations.
Work hard to get the nation's.
They operate on slim budgets.
They're not in a position to
take risks.
They're not going to file Madam
chair is in the average for the
lawsuits.
They're not gonna expose
themselves to that the downside
because in almost all cases the
people that they're suing gonna
have deeper pockets.
To the extent that there is
litigation if if there was a
report of attorney's fees weird
weird chevron.
The post this bill I assure you
chevron has deeper pockets than
any of the non profits in the
state.
And madam chair Mr chair we
certainly agree to disagree hi.
Again will not be able supported
for variety of reasons but I I
do think go.
This bill does create avenues
for litigation that did not
currently exist and that is a
concern thank you.
Representative next is
representative.
Thank you madam chair Mister
chairman homeland.
All.
Twenty two.
In fact which they.
Directed to review canonical.
This for.
She.
True could you describe for
Children changes might trigger.
Madam chair representative got I
would certainly expect that or
otherwise within the include
health impacts.
But perhaps Mister to sail in
the something else you'd like
that.
madam chair Mister
Representative Scott
the yes certainly health effects
what you might be getting at is
a static effects and under the.
the law of expanding somebody
can usually bring a lawsuit
for static effects for example
the use of a wilderness area or
they the swim in a river or they
can do in a river in that river
becomes polluted that's an area
where they would have a
significant interest and injury.
With that too motion district.
Madam chair representative Scott
I am not aware of any cases
either in New Mexico for under
the federal statutes that have
allow the party to assert
standing based on emotional
injury so my answer to that is
no Madam chair representative go
like that and Mr disabled
correct me if I'm wrong on the
is pathetic impacts.
The ones that we're talking
about are not laws that address
is that the compact so.
To have a cause of action you
have to have a violation.
So madam chair.
Mr Chairman otherwise the.
Health issues.
Madam chair representative got I
would.
Put health issues as primary as
probably the.
most important I have to think
if there could be others other
plans.
Mr chair
Placed locations.
Under in fact.
So.
No.
For reasons.
My.
Madam chair representative got
if the freeze the the person who
is injured or is imminently
threatened with injury that
would be brought.
The free services set up by the
COVID as who is injured in fact
economically or otherwise or is
imminently threatened with such
injury so in that sense it is
perhaps even a little narrower
than any injury.
Chair Mister chairman could you
describe the injuries and.
Yes.
Madam chair
presents got the pollutants in
emitted from the plant which
violate the law travel on to
your property and contaminated
they flowed into your house
increase them and you get sick
those are injuries impact.
But I do otherwise as we just
discussed.
madam chair.
Representative Scott I believe
if you're properties
contaminated that's a
substantial economic injury that
may not affect your health.
Sure all what we want on the
thank you to.
She used to work deal which.
Given.
The tractor.
Of
of these questions.
Fund diligent.
Madam chair representative
cutting in addition to civil
correct me if I'm wrong but.
Litigation does take time
Diligently
it's going to be a facts and
circumstances valuation.
Is it progressing me if if
you're waiting ninety days for
status conference or a trial the
it's coming up or whatever it is
that's gonna fall under diligent
as you know because that's just
the way it process because if
there was a claim filed and then
simply no action was taken.
Then then maybe that's not
diligent but if the.
A private plane for to come come
forward and say.
This is intelligence agencies as
well here we did we we had this
meeting we had this negotiation
we're we're sent out this
letter.
I think it would be just fine.
That to me Madam chair
representative got the were
diligently is in there just so.
If the litigation is not being
pursued it sometimes litigation
is dismissed for failure to
keep the process going
that's what that's getting and
it's it's not getting at the you
know the delay given the court
calendar or scheduling conflict.
Mr chair last question.
It was Representative
testimony thank you for.
Sure rural places in statute for
these Roch already exist.
And yet you so were never.
Yes.
One of the need for this
legislation to change that sure.
Madam chair representative got
that that's another one of those
issues like it's interesting
because this bill on the one
hand which resulted day Lujan
litigation and on the other hand
would be seldom use.
So so which is it I think the
experience we've seen in other
areas which Mr to say on this
more experience in it's it's
used occasionally to good
effect.
And that's I think appropriate.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you for listening to.
Next Representative Dixon.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative have to clean and
Mr saying.
Thank you I just wanted to focus
in on some questions that I have
based primarily on the different
agency analyses.
The first question though
actually
Is about the difference is that
in types of legislation the
civil action for that citizen.
Going this route verses the
tort.
At the were discussing earlier
and I'm not need training so
When you mentioned that that in
the tort cases
There is the difference between
damages and compliance in sort
of the result thank
If the court awards.
Damages up just compliance also
have to be at a result as well
photo.
If a company.
Is sued for damages and found
liable.
And they are ordered to pay
damages okay also then have to
comply for now.
madam chair Representative Dixon
it kind of depends on what the
lawsuit is is that what the
basis of the lawsuit is if the
if the plaintiff is simply
asking for damages and that's
all they get if they're asking
for for damages and they're
asking for an injunction to stop
the the the cause of the damages
then
fear there could be an
injunction that that would you
know require the company to stop
the pollution or whatever
so that's that's a possible
scenario it's not a necessary.
Thank you madam chair
In the agency analysis from
EMNRD starting their
Chairman
in the.
And I'll just read it the
provisions of the bills drafted
which direct the penalties
collected would be deposited in
the treasury ignores OCD's role
and deprive it of revenue.
Madam chair and chairman what
sort of what is your response to
that.
Concern that they brought up.
Madam chair representative sent
gonna defer to Mister Madam
that's okay thank well first of
all I point out that the
that the bill as currently
drafted does not include any
Provisions that affect the
energy minerals and natural
resources department immense
only statutes that are
administered by the environment
department
so the way that this that the
bill is strapped it
the penalties that might be
assessed in a citizen suit
would go to the state the
treasury and for the most part
they go to specific
funds that are administered by
the agencies.
Madam chair and.
And hello the following that the
then Alice's says in terms of
impacts to the OCD would likely
still have to intervene as a
party in any suit filed against
regulated entity under the laws
establishing OCD authority so I
think my concern is is that.
EMNRD and CD do see a role that
affects them in this process.
Madam chair representative Dixon
here under this bill there is no
role for energy minerals and
natural resources department
your earlier versions of bills
that included a provision under
the New Mexico oil and gas act
that is not part of this bill
we're currently in discussions
with the energy minerals and
natural resources department
because they're statute is a
little bit different as we
discussed earlier there's
already a citizen to provision
and more
it's just.
It needs to be worked out of
that
so we're we're if there are some
complicating factors I guess
with that bill with that part of
the bill and so that was taken
out and.
This bill does not include
energy as an actor resources.
Madam chair if I may well Mr to
said one reason that comic
is exactly right there used to
be a fifth
statute was the oil and gas act
due to concerns expressed by
EMNRD
which we're still discussing
with them we we took that out of
the bill is structured to
provide notice to the agencies
so the idea is that we
assistance to this file the
agency should know what.
Should have the ability to.
Review the any settlement a
consent decree things like that
be involved if they want to be.
It doesn't require them to do
so.
And I'm.
I have looked at this now
madam chair Representative Dixon
and I apologize I forgot there
is a
There is an extent to which the
energy minerals and natural
resources department is affected
here because that department is
a constituent agency of the
water quality control commission
and it does issue groundwater
discharge permits within the oil
and gas industry under the water
quality act so energy minerals
would be affected
you know that's mostly what well
act is mostly implemented by the
environment department but there
is a piece of the energy
department has.
Thank you madam chair and
chairman.
Yeah I appreciate that they have
a couple other items in there
that I I can review and get a
better understanding of
Another.
In in the analysis on the the
next page is individuals may
currently uses provisions
applicable these provisions
contained clauses that do not
restrict other rates these
individuals to seek enforcement
under any other statute HB two
forty two may be interpreted to
limit these other options.
Madam chair and chairman I'm
just wondering if you can
respond to that as well.
To clarify
What I'm sort of interested in
is that there are other
mechanisms for individuals.
When they have these concerns.
Your reserve Dixon just give me
a second while I read this.
Madam chair representative.
I'm open clear on what they're
trying to get us are I do not
think there is anything in this
act makes the exclusive remedy
of an individual for example.
It never brought up the
possibility with the tort action
I don't think this precludes a
tort action so I'm not really
sure what the analyst is getting
at with that language.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you chairman
The analysis from the
environment department I think
at some similar concerns with
regard to that resources and
capacity that are shared between
the environment department in
minerals and natural resources
that specifically under the
significant issues section madam
chair chairman
The last in a sentence is house
bill two forty two does not
contemplate alternative actions
and maybe draw already limited
resources legal resources away
from enforcement actions in
order to demonstrate the NMED's
diligently pursuing enforcement
of so madam chair and chairman
I'm just wondering if you can
respond to that concern.
Representative Dixon
It's the intent of the bill to.
Involve the agencies to the
extent they want.
That involvement necessarily
include some yes staff on if
they're notified of a lawsuit
someone's gonna read into this I
mean we understand that there
there is an impact there.
It's not we're we're not
requiring them to intervene to
take over the lawsuit to
prosecute the lawsuit.
It's it's really left to their
discretion.
That's I think it appropriate
role for the for those agencies
and I think that's.
That's.
Preferable to having this being
the sort of done.
Out of sight out of mind the
agencies I think the agencies
should at least be aware of
these actions.
To the extent of filed.
Thank you madam chair and
gentleman I think
Trying to balance sort of
The concerns of the agency and
potential.
Additional implications and
consequences
and so you know the.
Thank you know that.
While the fiscal implications
are unclear they would still
likely have to intervene as a
party in any suit filed against
a regulated entity
under the laws establishing
NMED's at thirty
So.
It just gives me some pause and
some concern madam chair and
gentleman I think the overall
issue of whether or not we're
funding our agency sufficiently
to be able to enforce the
regulations that we have.
Already authorized them with
their ask them to manage.
Is something that absolutely
should be dealt with
and you know hopefully through
the appropriations process that
can be achieved I would also
note that.
And I think perhaps
representative Nibert brought
this up earlier that there is no
appropriation in this page I do
think that there is going to be
some.
There is I think that there is
going to be some fiscal
implications so I just want to
fly back and madam chair and
chairman the only other thing
that I would say in terms of my.
concern would be
that as we progress on this
energy transition I do share
some of the concerns that were
brought up
by companies that are engaged in
transmission lines renewable
energy project project and all
of the things that
Able us to meet our climate
goals and so my fundamental
concern is that we may be
creating an additional obstacle
to getting that done
So with that Madam chair and
chairman that's all I have any
other questions thank you
Representative says
shared Mr chair and Mr the
salient
First I think one of sort of
overall perspective I think I've
shared with the previous
question
Energy development in sort of
sustainability efforts are more
focused statewide from the
renewable energy perspective
that is to say there's renewable
energy basically every county in
the state of New Mexico all
thirty three counties there is
fossil fuels oil and gas really
in three maybe four primarily
So so that's the the the
contacts of some quick questions
chair Mister chair
The effects then on some of the
energy transition efforts are.
More potentially Phelps
statewide.
And so I just have a few
examples to ask of you some of
the energy related some more
sustainability related madam
chair Mister chair
if this were to pass and to be
able to implemented in Los
crucis the waste water treatment
plant takes in effluent and then
treats that affluent releases
back into the Rio Grande
actually a cleaner standard than
what the river flowing by is but
would this if someone were
concerned downstream with this
open up an opportunity for them
to sue over that practice.
Chair of the small thank Mr Zuma
nature's questions well but I I
go back to the issue of to have
a cause of action you have to
have a violation.
So if the waste water treatment
plant is discharging wastewater
that is between can we see this
all along the Rio Grande
because.
You take water out user you
clean it you put back in the
clothes downstream someone else
takes that that same water we
see it all over the down the
river on the if there's no
violation there's no cause of
action so.
For some amount the effort to
file a lawsuit.
I I I don't see it happening
because they think.
There might be a violation yeah
I don't see it happening because
they think that it's not clean
enough.
Because it it needs to be
cleaned to the standards of the
law if it's not clean to this it
is cleaned to the standards of
the law that correct.
We need if it is filed which
seems unlikely what last very
long.
This challenging the thing that
the yes thank you Representative
McQueen the the only thing that
I would add to that is that the
wastewater discharge or the
waste water treatment plant
would have a discharge permit
probably an NPDES permit issued
under the clean water act in
that permit the would be
effluent limits
for the discharge and the only
way that somebody could bring a
lawsuit is if the effluent
limits are being seated if
they're not being exceeded even
though people might not be happy
with how we're those effluent
limits are sacked
you don't have a lawsuit and
less those effluent limits are
being exceeded thank you madam
chair thank you Mr chair thank
you Mr Sen for future for future
nemeses permits and I I see the
I don't know exactly the.
Accurately for future permits
at this if that how what this
that you make
Factor into those permits so if
a permit exists I get that what
you stand for future permit
requests what effect would this
that you have on those.
Mentors as well I think you
might be addressing Mr Salem
but.
You know offer that.
There's a there's a process to
apply for permanent department
is subject to certain guidelines
from state law.
If the permit was issued.
In violation of those risk seems
unlikely hoping on maybe there's
a claim but if the permits
issued in compliance with state
law in the emitter.
Complies with the permanent.
Again there's really no cause of
action.
I think that thank you madam
chair thank you Mr chair moving
them to to
Destruction of transmission
lines construction of renewable
energy drilling of geo thermal
Wells for for energy what this
statute have any effect on those
That was.
Madam chair is a small so the
statute.
Quarterbacks their quality
control to hazardous waste that
the water quality act and some
of the stuff.
I'm not intimately familiar
with.
The mechanics of those four
acts.
The dough these are things that
directly strike me as things
that directly affect its
activities.
And I I don't want to be too
long Madam Mr chair I think.
Following up more on those and
I'll certainly work to bring
more information to understand
which how how and if they
integrate but in the same vein
madam chair Mister chair we talk
about landfill waste to energy.
That seems likely then that
would likely be covered under
this and so there
Is that so I mean the regular
bills.
Converting landfills waste to
energy
that may be subject to this and.
What would that be accurate.
The mentors as small of the
prior issue if I may just of the
offer the example of there
there's a proposed a utility
scale solar plant in my district
in Santa Fe County there is some
local opposition to that.
I certainly haven't heard the
local opposition site any of
these provisions I think that's
a the county land use issue and
that's where the opposition will
have a voice as to whether we
still energy would be covered by
the the perhaps this all we
stacked or possibly their
quality control act with us
Mister to sail in the if you
know etcetera that
Thank you Representative McQueen
Madam chair representative small
I don't know I guess I'm not
familiar enough with the the
waste to energy
projects
the solid waste act does
regulate landfills
but I'm not I'm not aware of how
the solid waste act which would
regulate
you know using the waste to to
generate energy
The actor Mister chair Mister
the state and thank you
state awesome I appreciate very
much the answers it seems to me
that this there there has been.
Respecting the work in the
constraints that have gone into
this effort
nonetheless I regretfully I'm
gonna close today mainly because
We're in a five to ten years
sort of window where we need to
build more than we ever have in
different sorts of ways to sort
of decarbonise and and I
I think it's incumbent upon me
to look and see how those
potential of proposed investment
efforts some of whom we've seen
here today in opposition to this
if in fact a conflict and if in
fact they do not because there
is none the less that just to
sort of explain where I'm coming
from thank you very much Mr
chairman thank.
Madam.
Thank you Mr.
Thank you madam chair which J..
State.
Still.
Austin this is just.
And
insurers and Townsend it's to
Salem I think it like still both
the state thank you.
I have a couple questions
Under the definition that is on
Care asked on a table
Nine through twenty.
I.
Going forward.
Is there anyone in the Mexico
that could not.
On almost any project state that
I have state in the I mean does
it that does not is very broad
and includes almost PED one.
Madam chair representative town
center as far as the parties
they can be sued
it would have to be a party that
is regulated by wanted the
statutes either by regulations
or by the statute or through a
permit.
and second of all it would have
to be somebody who is in
violation of the statute or the
regulations are permits.
So are Madam chair I I believe
the question was about standing
to sue not who would be sent up
okay I I apologize I
misunderstood the question madam
chair representative Thompson
it would apply to any person who
has standing to sue and as we
discussed earlier a person who
had standing to sue is one who
it has been
injured in fact were imminently
threatened with injury in fact
those are the people that would
have standing.
And madam chair and.
Mr Chairman state of.
As as I think about having been
having had some experience with
building.
Just over.
Large areas.
We had a we had a huge wind farm
And bond.
The
people in.
there northeast of there maybe
twenty or thirty or forty or
fifty miles.
With our prevailing winds up
in the southwest if they did not
have right dust control.
I can.
I think I could have stayed in
the don't you I mean I have that
and I have problems with I have
standing
Madam chair representative
Representative Townsend
Potentially but again you would
have to be an injury so just the
fact that you're breathing in
dust and you don't like it very
much that's not enough to create
an injury you have to you have
to have to show us some kind of
health issue or
some other kind of harm.
maybe to your environment
but it would all you would also
have to show if there's a
violation.
And if the permit I think if
this facility has an air permit
there would be some standards
for this is what you do to dust
for dust control and if the
facility is in compliance with
that permit then there wouldn't
be a loss there wouldn't be it a
claim if the facilities out of
compliance with that permit then
there might be a claim.
And appropriately so.
I appreciate that
Madam chair.
Mr chair was silent I.
I have seen yes.
And I in you will if the if we
pass this we will see this
weaponized I promise you.
Because for example if I'm if
there's a project as of
Representative small refer to if
there is a big of.
With current projects.
Addition out there.
And
someone doesn't like that.
All they have to do is go to
that down we own side.
Find a person that has.
As.
Stand behind them with a pot
full of money.
In those guys that are built in
that winter and farmers are in
trouble.
It can happen with.
A farmer.
It could happen with the
pipeline company can happen with
the road company it can happen
almost anything I've I've been
I've seen it firsthand.
And that is the that's kind of
what bothers me if you look.
In that definition.
After the COVID it says board
who is imminently threatened.
With that injury.
I thank the lawyers they can
make a great case that I am
imminently threatened.
When I'm driving down I. forty
downwind of such projects it was
going to cost me problem the
second problem that we have is I
believe on.
Page two.
Line fourteen.
It says the part the no action
may be brought under this
section if the department has
commenced and is diligently
prosecute.
So what if the what yeah.
That.
That scenario I have.
Described.
Occurs.
And the environmental Department
says the.
J..
I don't think that this is
getting to you.
I don't think it's something you
need to be worried about we
don't want to spend any money to
prosecute.
They're definitely yes dust
being.
Produced.
It probably or may be in
violation of the.
The.
Yes Representative federal dust
regulations.
It's not in the one.
But I don't like what those guys
your so madam chair today.
And I'm a thousand Here hill.
Trying to.
That my asthma is not activated
by that the state is twenty five
miles from.
I promise it's going to happen
is going to happen to the
rancher because of water trough
in the course of the past year
and on the draft date he turns a
hundred hit the spears and after
they all take off running for
the water from.
Yeah it does and I'm the only
one thing.
I don't like that.
I don't think a lot of the
update.
I I have standing.
And I have a deposit.
Because they have.
Maybe violated the dust control.
in the in the issue.
I'm gonna use that because I
don't like those guys.
It will be used whether it's a
we turban or type wind or a
subdivision or anything else
I've seen I felt that.
The other thing
If you go on page.
Yeah we're the issue.
Damages
attorney Paul attorney fees.
Can the judge ruled that that
person
that has rocked a loss.
There are these are covered.
Madam chair representative
Tenzin the judge can Ortiz the
judge can award fees to either
side.
Madam chair representative I
would add
I think it award is fees it's a
typical some statutes make it
mandatory if you prefer it
prevail this is not one of those
bills.
My point madam chair Mister
chair Mister state and is it.
We live in a very Erin state.
Southwest but we're very or the
state.
And almost any construction
project.
Whether your bills houses.
Yeah.
One of our cities are your
bills.
I wonder whatever you're doing
you're gonna create yes and you
have no idea.
But the cost of control in that
needs.
No idea.
It's huge.
And it's ongoing and it will be
detrimental to the development
of housing.
Power lines.
What you're doing it's a big
problem your point about is to
it in violation of a statute.
It probably has some violation
and the federal statute on dust
control but it should be
applied to that area.
I have watched on projects
we're.
You would have environmentalists
go out take to opacity meters.
But one of the clear blue sky
Act get one reading and focus
the other one on the piece of
truck going down the road and
catch it violations there you go
that's the way it works.
And I just think it'll be
weaponized I can't support it I.
In many ways I don't have a
problem with with what you're.
Philosophically trying to do.
But.
This is not the right mechanism
and I think.
You'll see industry finding
people that they can have state
that have standing they will
fund their losses and opted even
for something else for this
extracting money from for
another project that I want I'll
be able to drop a lawsuit if
they bring them if they if they
pay me or they go do something
so so Madam chair
representative.
I think it's a problem we don't
need thank you.
More questions.
Madam chair
Listening to my colleagues
the first thing and for you know
a fact which you're trying to do
here chairman claim we do
but I think that there are some
the intended consequences to
this bill
I think having run a.
You madam chair for the city and
working and twenty eight years
and development
And working with developers Mr
chair and and madam chair
I've seen a lot of things over
the years and the first thing
that comes to my mind is
The responsibility of government
to and and tell me if you agree
or not is to ensure our the
health safety and welfare of the
general public and I think that
Mr chair do you agree with that.
Madam chair is a very good I do
agree with that statement and I
think we have seen a.
and unfortunately of them
falling short.
So you know the fifth and final
losses that we have passed.
Should just be aspiration.
They should be enforced it is
the government lacks the
resources to enforces
environmental laws it's not
unreasonable to empower people
who are suffering the
consequences to enforces thank
you Mr chair appreciate that
response madam chair the issue
that I have Mr chair is that if
that is truly the responsibility
of government then we should be
adequately funding our agencies
to ensure compliance and if we
are not doing that that we are
not doing our job.
S. legislators and I think that
is the point that I'm trying to
make is that maybe we need to be
looking at all of our
departments across the board to
ensure that they are adequately
funded to ensure that
regulations are being
Matt and that people are being
protected and I understand what
you're doing here I do Mr chair
and madam chair but I do also
think that we need to be looking
as a government agency which we
are
or government form of the
government rather to ensure that
our agencies are feeling like or
are not feeling but they're
actually.
They have the resources to meet
their obligations whatever the
that department is so for that
reason
but that's not the only reason
madam chair Mister chair I also
want to say that having served
as an elected official on the
Flood control board I also know
that we cannot always pinpoint
who is causing the damage and so
you know especially when I've
seen with up our water
sometimes somebody can pollute
the water and I I just would
like to know what your thoughts
are regarding Napster chair.
Madam chair Representative
Griego.
I think that's true
if however is.
To bring it back to to this
proposal.
If you can identify the
polluter.
You can file a lawsuit.
So you know that the first up
with of course would be to
identify a leader if there's
pollution in the in the the the
flow of the river or in the air
and soil thank you
can identify you that's the
first investigation.
If if you can't trace it to a
particular emitter and often you
can but if you can't.
Then you there's just no one to
sue.
So I I I guess if that's an I
guess I'm not clear what that's
a concern thank you madam chair
and I guess you my concern is
that there might be and I was as
I mentioned earlier than
intended consequences that
somebody maybe soon and I
believe that there's madam chair
already a process whereby people
can sue and so I just feel like
we're kind of putting another
layer
in an area where
Attorney General and the
departments have a
responsibility already so that
reason those reasons Mr chair I
respectfully
to not agree with this
legislation as it is written
thank you.
just one question do you believe
there's gonna be mountains of
Las.
You madam chair absolutely not.
Mr Chairman because.
commitment chair
Members of the committee thank
you you know I I can.
they can get the votes
I I would say.
I'm frustrated because I think
there is fear mongering going on
about what's going to happen and
it's not borne out by past
experience.
In that I don't see it in in the
language of this bill.
yes this if the feeding this
bill would ensure adequate
funding for state agencies I was
up against.
They're two separate issues.
Should we fund our state
agencies absolutely.
Does this passing this bill.
Affect on.
It doesn't there's a process.
People should have the right.
To protect themselves into
insist.
The system computers complying
with the law.
That's what this bill.
Thank you Mr.
I'm trying.
Representative.
Yes.
Representative Dixon.
Representative Garcia of.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Nibert yes.
Representative Rubio noted to.
Representative Scott.

down on the bill which is why I
voted no to table thank you.
Four of.
