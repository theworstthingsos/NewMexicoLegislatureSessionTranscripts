The taxable.

Of mv.
Thirty five percent of the st.
Yeah.
Question.
Questions we begin with.
I'm sorry i'm sorry.
Opposition
we have some time today so I
think we're going to give those
supporters a couple of minutes
to.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee i'm all the same
support this bill because.
To reiterate what the sponsor
sitting.
Even if.
The.
Good morning madame chairman
members many my name is rick on
the executive director for
transportation we want to think
a sponsor for bringing us
forward I think.
That for most transportation
will be for definitely in favor
of
what I think would be remissive
we didn't mention that you know
some of that money that's good.
But other than that I know you
want to think response.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I like to say.
Yeah.
The.
Thank you very execute record
associated
but what mike said on behalf of
the contractors we believe that
this is a great perfect time for
us to.
The.
And i'm sorry we did not.
Sir madam.
Good morning that i'm chairing
members of the committee i'm to
the west fall executive vice
president of the greater
albuquerque chamber of commerce
and I stand today and strong
supported HB one forty six i've
watched the legislative process
for years and for decades I
wrote about new mexico's roads
for the albuquerque journal it
is a sad fact that you know you
have crossed state line because
the quality of the road changes
bunding our roads his always
been a challenge a couple
together system that never
really catches up with the
backlog of maintenance and
construction needs an HB one
forty six can finally change
that it's going to invest that
four hundred million in the
state's extraordinary revenues
in a trust find a help insure a
healthy stream of revenue for
the foreseeable future
lawmakers have wisely done this
for other pressing needs in its
time to do it for our roads
especially with the gas tax
revenue estimated to decline as
the use of electric vehicles
rises good roads are key to
economic development tourism and
safety and we urge you to pass
one forty six thank you.
And now we will go to community.
Thank you matter mike which I
was actually.
I think they're supporting.
Next representative
thinking on chair and.
Hopefully we can.
Maybe the common.
Gasoline tax is a great model of
attacks.
We're breaking that now with
what your vehicles
and we've been wrestling w.
Money they would.
Another
is to.
Yeah.
Pros and c.
Yeah.
Had a new idea.
Charge.
I'm guessing this.
And then we're gonna have a a
motion from mister western where
I see it but representative of
round you and I have always I
think seen in eye on this
particular issue as being.
Faces and is going to face and
we are char.
Not just now but well in the
future provide one of the most
important.
So I think this is a fantastic
bill I
we brought the same bill last
year every single member of this
committee signed on.
The powers that be have been
listening I think it's one of
those things that we have to
just like we did with grant
permit fund in.
Until we're finally heard this
bill is a is a great improvement
on the on the bill that I
introduced and I I thank you
very much for your ideas I asked
someone recognize representative
pedegro who has been working on
this issue quite awhile and has
had some of the great ideas that
it kind of added to the spell so
and just have a couple questions
per fine questions and just
for my own notification from the
application of the audience
explain the little bit more how
the early children education
trust fund was funded in how
this model will duplicate that
some that we can see the same.
It started with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A fair.
I think matter sharing members
are the.
Is probable.
We know that.
And so there's been a lot of
talk here in the.
Some incentive.
Yeah.
There may be some people.
And what I like to.
And where did the idea to.
Yeah.
You've touched on it a little
bit this committee we all know
that we have the e v.
That we are all going to have to
deal with if not this session
very soon and so I like the the
way your bill interacts with
that particular issue is do you
foresee
your bill working with one model
over another model or just
working in synchronic and
whatever other what whatever
model.
Tax electric vehicle.
Yeah.
On that yet there are a lot of
diff.
But I know that.
That with all th.
Again commend you I love this
bill your bill actually made it
further than mine did mind the
stacked rules because on.
I hope you would allow me to
sign on to it I actually hope
that every single member of this
committee would consider signing
on to this bill I think that if
we could get something like this
done.
One of the greatest like
legacies that we all could you
know hang our house on wall
during.
A single person.
I think it could absolutely be a
part of the future of dealt so
thank you very much for bringing
this bill and that might just.
So I I looked at.
And.
And then.
Yeah.
And they're suggesting.
Okay.
Thank you president and and
these federal matching funds I
mean they're always going to ask
for state match the tallies
programs I was working on
setting up a recurring mechanism
for that would be a really smart
thing for the same to do so
again think.
Thank you madame jeer before you
do that motion representative
this is a good visa legislation
because you know mine deal with
always roach boat vote cause
it's a safely approach the seat
factor is the niconamic driver
or kids are not devoted every
day and you know education.
And now we are not second day we
rolled whatever we can use it
for that it's a good deal than
but you know i'm applied to even
but in here.
Look at it.
And make a motion of a two pass
a.
As the men.
I'm.
The.
Representative brown
representative day like cruise
representative harper yes
representative jones
representative yes
representative madrid yes
representative pedegroup yes
representative.
Mister
madam chair yes.
Now you have a passport.
Okay.
And morning modern
thank you for hearing this very
very important field today
any else bill one one fifty
three it has to do with us
highway three eighty leaving
gross going east through tadam
on it to texas matter chair we
are asking an appropriation of
three hundred and fifty m.
We are asking this is because
that road has deteriorated to.
It is what it the three projects
for the district to
do t at the top of their
priority madame cheer US three
eighty
is
greatly needed because we have
school bus is going down that
particular stretch a highway we
have.
The egg community that's
involved whether it's holling
our fell for whether it's moving
farm equipment whether it's.
We also have the oil feel using
that road we know how cameras
and those.
Along the highway they often
turn in people are being they
get frustrated trying to
find a place to pass because
it's almost impossible.
Way through today to me to texas
transporting patience to the
hospitals and look
oh
the thing that's been a
concerned we have had lots of
people tell me that are involved
in the racing community whenever
they're holiday horses from redo
so restrict
either to dallas or.
That it at the horses are just
their overcome with thing
anxiety it's a reference I will
hold all my house.
Members of the commit.
I hoped all of the old.
All of the.
All sorts of.
We are expecting whatever this
does happen between s.
Your members of the committee
as it stated over.
In one of the analysis from
francisco sanchez of the
district to offers he does
breakdown but all that road it
will not.
It eases this burden that these
drivers are experiencing by
miles and miles of traffic
backed up due to a vehicle in
the very front that is not
driving.
We have frustrated drivers which
is has caused lots of accidents.
That this will give the
district.
Ants you start the process it
will take about three years to
get this done
but it is greatly needed in.
Representative
thank you matter chairman
members so we don't notice
uh the bill asked for.
And I believe that's.
I just.
This is the commerce.
Yeah.
Thank you very much at this
point we will go to the audience
to see if we.
Yeah.
Thank you morning madam chair
again right right
transportation and i'm not sure
you know any in like I said he
issued any bill that were most
transportation and definitely
were all for I think that
is really what it comes down to
and you know we've been throwing
everything including the kitchen
sink interpret unit just really
hard to put up a number to that
it is a plus mile along we I I
try to re have the first twenty
miles earlier this year and you
know I need to go back and make
sure I think.
So there would all fix that
what is well
that would be face one thirty to
thirty five million dollars and
they will start working on face
too much of the next lot twenty
two miles and we're hoping to
see that wouldn't go.
Here so that's good news that
the outside is we need the money
right.
Thank you mister I have a quick
question for you actually I
don't believe i'm cisco's here
in the district two engineers.
Would be possible to ask cisco
cisco in terms of the
prioritizations of three eighty
and district to can you speak a
little bit to that and where is
that fall on your price.
I'm sure he is on the road this
morning I can
sure you can absolutely give the
answer if you h.
Okay next we have jump right.
Thank you manage here she let us
have the time to talk.
I
think that
revenue source to fund projects
so the public.
Is there anybody else in the
opposition to the world.
Get closer to the mike by the
way.
I've heard complaints.
So I encourage everybody to get
a closer to their mikes
manager right i'm very familiar
with.
For a number of reasons but
nonetheless I think it's a good
project the only concern that I
have is that hundred no.
But more than the ot's
recommending that.
And represented a pedegra I
believe he's been put on the
spot if you don't mind can give
us a more history
on this project thank you madame
chairing thank you ville
sponsors for bringing this floor
in the past had signed under
this but I felt very very
strongly that it's it's out it's
just.
And so I do appreciate the the
legislation I will put a plug in
I think one twenty eight a
higher priority but I understand
the DO t's means a methods and
with three eighty it it is it is
very critical that we do this
and and i'm chair what's respect
to this
and said this yesterday and
committee we we continually on
every bill or every FIR talk.
One of the things.
It would be remissed with not
saying is that this would the
feeder.
The major revenue stream for th.
With that whole area.
Representative result with cycle
with the with the ra.
How does to mash together to
bring
tourism dollars.
This critical with respect just
to the survival of redosa
lincoln ca.
One thing texts and hate was
driving on bad roads
and they're the ones that come
over here and spend the majority
of the tourists.
Both locations the risk tracks
and
the the mascular of tribe.
Madame support
and presenter.
Two hundred I know some of the
new answers that are dealt he's
going to have to deal with with
respect.
Expanding the expending that
those cuts to where we have
more
have the ability.
Make make a safe road with
respect to that
I agree with the the passing
lane concept with respect to
this I drive that road probably.
And I will say
this defense don't think it was
a bad idea I don't think it was
a mistake I think there were
some things that would probably
could have dended.
We've had that conversation the
the the interest of what the de
tried to do with.
Was critical just.
To do that and so I applied to
for the effort.
In so in a and I understand what
they're going to do to work on
that that they're that hundred
million separation is going to
get us hopefully to th.
Thirty percent inflation values
for.
And where the fallba.
All complete and then done with
respect to the s.
Where we were out with the
original numbers on two hundred
and f.
Mister britier could talk ab.
One critical question and and
for the bill sponsors with
respect to this and it may be
best for for mr predear to
answer this
within the bill we talk about
this coming from general fund
inside the FIR it talks about
coming from the
appropriate what is the
appropriations contingency fund
and I would like to know what
the sep.
Fortunately do the fire this
bill but I get the information
for you i'm not too sure i'll.
It's hoping the answer was we're
going to do it through the
preparations on because then
that way we don't have to deal
with hac
I was truly helping that was
going to be the answer to that
and so I would like to know that
I am strong support of this
what's this does for economic
development not only for lincoln
must or terror in the masculoral
tribes.
But with respect to the impact
of that road has on the town of
the
in the city of rose is.
I love the fact that we're
talking about getting that show
moved over here and I think
representative of the cell I
signed on with that yesterday
because.
Everything we do should have
some impact on how.
So I stand and strong.
Keep in good every year until we
get there thank you
very other members who would
like to.
Can I have a motion on the.
Absolutely representative thank
you.
Is the turn off to the oldest
state park in the state of new
mexico and that is automost
likes as well we have been
working on this p.
The difference that you see
between the request we are
making and we did this whenever
there I think representative.
All the wrist office when it.
I note that it was okay you were
in.
This year it was representative
not now senator nibert as
represented townsend scott
myself and there was one of the
next member was that met with
the dot personnel and their
request was the three hundred
and fifty m.
Where the two fifty came from
was another
elected official from my area
that was.
And done right so we're not
having.
Patch to redo it again so madame
charges wanted to clarify those
things in I hope to tell we'll
support it when.
Thank you madame chair thank you
representatives and also just a
quick comment.
For all members of this
committee because of what the
difficulties we.
Issues who seem a section nine I
actually encourage any in all of
you to bring free standing
bills.
Anything it brings attention to
these issues that need to be
brought to gives that a forum
for us to discuss and again it
brings it in front of our
appropriate.
To bring them to their attention
so i.
With that.
This.

Okay house twenty eight
representative garrett hello.
I feel like this is my town.
So it's great to see everybody
it's good to.
We have read from
today i'm here to talk about
house bill twenty eight it's the
public project revolving fund
projects my expert witness is
john brooks he's the uh mexican
finance authority.
House bill twenty eight is the
new mexican finance authorities
public project rebobbing fan
projects.
Station behalf.
The bill authorizes to provide
loans from the
public project revolving fund to
one hundred separate state and
local.
Firms and conditions established
by the
ppr legislat.
All the projects.
You know the p p rf enjoys a
triple a rating from s n p and
passes that benefit of that
reading along to the p p r f
bars.
Two thousand two hundred and
fifty p p r
totally more than four point
seventy five billion.
Then chair committee members
thank you for your time I have
my name is john brooks chief of
programs at the finance
authorities as a representative
garrett has pointed out this is
our flagship feel this is a bill
that works in everyone of your
communities in terms of projects
that we do throughout.
We support this.
And with that man of chairman
where you stand for questions.
Do you have anyone in the
audience and favor of house bill
twenty.
Yeah.
It really helps.
They can manage here again we
appreciate any other review
sources that we can get and you.
It would get some of the money
for some projects so.
The.
Anybody in opposition.
Okay let's go to the committee
we have.
Thank you madame chairman thank
you representative or bring in
the bill for I have two manner
chairs
one and
the first one is like with
normal with the capital outlay
project are communities that the
the go after those go through
their annual audits.
Random chair and my question is
as their process with.
Manager representative will we
work with communities that have
audit findings we make note
those are.
Require a contra.
Thank you for that answer soon
specifically to that.
When i'm chering
the
negative tiny may not stop from
receipt in the ppr of funds can
you talk a little bit about the
requirement for.
Chair.
Yes
because they have automatic
doesn't mean that they would be
in.
We still work with those.
There.
In there by.
Our security for most part is
either some type of g o t.
During revenue stream that at
that local community.
Perfect thank you for that
answer some who process worked
madame chair my last question
this bill has a an emergency
class on it and I don't recall
these reatorizations bills in
the pa.
Medical chair of representative
every field that we have with.
In the reason is because
sometimes there is a project
that is set force for approval
by the intermediate board and we
cannot find that project.
And therefore.
Emergency in.
And i'm sure that's all my
questions I do.
They have a couple of question.
But it looks like.
America
as far as I know we are
statutory I think.
I don't know the answer to the
questions so I would say that
it's as far as I know where they
stay
and madame chairman
representative.
The tea in nineteen ninety two
to coordinate and facilit.
I've stayed in local capital
projects and new mexico as the
non governmental.
That's a little bit more.
It takes a while to unders.
It depends on a couple of fact.
Disadvantage of funding so some
incidents could get uh zero
percent financing.
Five hundred thousand dollars or
they could get.
The.
But the the interest is there
received finding it the same
interest rates we would get on
the open market as a trip.
Compared to a commercial bake it
is typical.
Anywhere between one hundred.
Next week president of her.
And matter chair representative
qualify to tears it.
And those are state
and public bodies and any tribal
entity as well.
That's correct representative.
And I don't chair representative
they are what in the same.
Medical chair represented it so
we look at the make child that
could be ready and so if they
reach I is a.
This event is community then
they can qualify for
disadvantage rates depending on
high disadvantage they are they
would get between zero party
percent.
Representative that is correct
so if that means household
income in that area is less
didn't stays average than a qu.
Matter which hair representative
I would say at least
forty to fifty percent of the.
There are some is this is when
when this advance funding
doesn't work for a financial
because either they've exhausted
all their alliable disadvantage
funding for the year or the
project is so large that it
does.
On the interest rate and we we
hold that back and use it for
another project that they
community.
Thank you very much next to go
to vice jersey.
How about these small water.
I got to my district that are
struggling and honourably
qualified for us
here iced chair
disadvantaged water systems or
water systems do qualify for the
p p r f but we were probably
recommend for a different
program because that program
would offer
either owned forgiveness or
something.
The p p r is purely a long
program and depending on their
situation we would make
recommendations.
Thank you matter because
back to the question of
representative who asked was
how do they hoping you get alone
if you have added.
You could get to lovely if you
have a problem against you you
get each car use the money in
the how you how do you have
right but kept the loud can do
or not.
And manager
mister vice chair so what we do
is take a look at the article
needs and depending on the idea
of say we have to do a correct
it corrective action plan and
that corrective actually planned
is set for them and there and
approval and then we work with
that community to work.
Because that the revenue street
in the financing most of those
reverse streets are in
intercepted before the
communities receive it and so
therefore there is no issues
with
any misuse of files.
Thank you
did you say somebody had some
other finding in the up my phone
and you go and give it to him
and have steps to follow the
correct the problem what happens
in the process that they don't
gr.
How do you address that is
veteran chair mister vice chair
so what we do is ill detail to
work with them and hopefully
they they don't buy themselves
in a repeat situation if they
are you repeat
if it's a repeat audit finding
that we step but the art
are due diligence with.
If they do default what what
steps you take on that
manager and mister west chair we
will work with their community
to either restructure on home or
to figure out some type of
payment plan that will help them
to get.
And the the reason asking that
because some of these power
communities are all
they're not pay their own what
he called more
they don't need to time though
to bound tears and they don't
have much about funding source
in.
The getting funding and then not
be able to fit it back and then
at the end of the day
when they do apply for capital
lovely they have bigger problems
now they ever did have because
you know there's communities
after they just can't get a
writing on it to be good
struggle for and I think.
Do we have any other questi.
Can I have a motion.
The.
The.
Representative
representative day lookers
